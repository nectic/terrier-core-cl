They'd throw this back at you if you served it up at a Burns Supper.
Are you sure this was made in Scotland
As regular performers at Burns Suppers, piping instructors were a
logical choice to give an opinion on haggis. Deedee Cuddihy reports on
their findings
HAVING been asked to organise and report on a haggis tasting, it came
to me in a flash that the best guinea pig in the world for this
particular job would be instructors from the College of Piping in
Glasgow. After all, as regular performers at Burns Suppers, they
probably eat more haggis in a lifetime than some of us have the
proverbial hot dinners.
I like to think, as well, that I'm no slouch when it comes to haggis.
I eat it much more often than once a year. Although, nowadays, I prefer
to slice it up and fry it which is quicker and less messy than the
traditional simmer-in-a-saucepan method and leaves a nice layer of
crunch on the haggis.
I've had some disasters in the past, when the skin has burst and half
the haggis has been poured away with the water. Then my friendly,
neighbourhood butcher told me that you can avoid this by simmering the
haggis in a mere half-inch or so of liquid, rather than submerging it. A
wrapping of aluminium foil also helps.
For The Herald's taste test which was held at the College of Piping on
January 25, I chose five brands of haggis: Macsween's Traditional,
Macsween's Vegetarian, Grant's tinned, Marks &amp; Spencer, and a butcher's
own make. All weighed approximately one pound each and prices ranged
from #1.09 for the tinned haggis to #1.90 for the Macsween's traditional
which was the only one which came in a proper skin.
The testers were Jeannie Campbell, a piping instructor and head of the
college's mail order department; Rona Macdonald, instructor and head of
the subscriptions department; Jim Maclean, an instructor; and John
Hardie who, although not an instructor, is a piper and a chef, normally
based in Finland where he recently made 120 pounds of haggis for an
international whisky event.
All four have performed at numerous Burns Suppers over the years and
between them must have sampled well over 100 haggis.
Jeannie has even tasted some oriental-style haggis which was prepared
for her by a visiting Chinese piper.
''He stir fried it with lots of different vegetables,'' she explained,
''And it made a refreshing change from the usual potatoes and turnip.''
All four pipers said they would be performing at Burns Suppers
stretching well into next month. So if you have haggis only once a year,
there's no shame in waiting until after you've read The Herald Taste
Test results to partake of Scotland's national dish. According to these
experts, a Burns Supper is very much a movable feast.
The first sample to be spooned into the hygenic, heavy duty, paper
plates was the butcher's own make (purchased from John Stewart's on
Byres Road). This was judged as ''Quite good'' by all the testers
although they all said it was a bit too dry and rather heavy on the
oatmeal.
Next was the tinned haggis which was also well received despite being
on the greasy side, they all agreed, with two of the testers saying it
was better than the first sample.
The vegetarian haggis did not go down well at all, with John declaring
it was like hot coleslaw, Jim saying it was ''Totally unlike a haggis''
and he didn't see the point of it, Jeannie just plain not liking it, and
Rona unable to eat it because she's allergic to nuts. (It also contained
lentils, kidney beans, and turnip).
Surprisingly, the Marks &amp; Spencer haggis -- ''Made to a traditional
Scottish recipe'' -- was even less well received than the veggie one.
''The worst I've ever tasted,'' said Jim, who added, ''It's like warm,
liver pate.''
The unusually smooth texture of this haggis put all the testers off.
None was able to finish their portion and, as Jeannie scraped the rest
of hers back into the scraping bowl, she pronounced it ''Horrible.
They'd throw this back at you if you served it up at a Burns Supper''.
''Are you sure this was made in Scotland?'' they all wanted to know.
Last was the Macsween's traditional haggis which was much more to the
pipers' liking.
John said it was the best of the bunch although he would have
preferred more spices ''vindaloo strength, preferably,'' he added. Jim
had no complaints apart from there being ''maybe a bit too much oatmeal,
an opinion that Jeannie agreed with. Rona reckoned it was marginally
better than the tinned haggis, neither of which she declared was a patch
on the haggis from Blackadder the butcher on Maryhill Road or the haggis
she's had at an SNP Burns Supper the previous week.
So the results were: one vote for the tinned haggis, one for John
Stewart's, and two for Macsween's Traditional.

GREAT Britain, having won the two unofficial hockey tests against the
USA as easy as the 2-1 and 6-0 scoreline suggests, are still bracing
themselves for a higher level of competition from their opponents in the
three official internationals tonight in San Deigo.
The heavy rains of recent days has now given way to conditions more
readily associated with Southern California and the American girls could
be a different proposition.
The British girls are ready for a renewed challenge. Their form had
exceeded all expectations and there is chance of a place in the squad
for the Olympic qualifying tournament in Cape Town in November.
Sue Slocombe, the British coach, has all her squad playing well.The
six Scottish players are all in contention, but realistically, four
could be the top line with Pauline Robertson, Diana Renilson and Susan
Fraser, provided she's recovered from a groin injury, virtual
certainties.
The fourth Scottish selection will be between Susan MacDonald and
Janet Jack.

Washington, Friday
THE House of Representatives passed the balanced budget amendment last
night by a comfortable margin after rejecting a more stringent version
offered by the Republican party.
If the measure passes the Senate and is ratified by the states, it
will, in theory, oblige the federal government to balance the books by
2002.
This will involve cutting about $1.5 trillion from estimated
expenditures over the next seven years. Congress is already
contemplating the task with trepidation.
The Bill passed by 300 votes to 132, 12 more than the two-thirds
majority needed. Seventy-two Democrats voted for the measure and two
Republicans voted against.
The tougher version of the proposal was defeated despite the best
efforts of Newt Gingrich, Richard Armey, and other conservative
Republicans. It would have provided that no taxes could be raised
without a two-thirds majority in both houses.
The version adopted has been debated for the past 10 years, and got
within two votes of passing three years ago.
It provides that the budget must be balanced unless a two-thirds
majority declares there is a national emergency, or in time of war.
Taxes may be raised to balance the budget by a simple majority of both
houses.
The amendment now goes to the Senate, where its chances are unclear. A
majority of Senators certainly supports it, but perhaps not the 67
needed, out of 100, for the two-thirds requirement.
Furthermore, it is much easier for the opposition to delay and
filibuster proposals in the Senate than in the House.

AS far back as last October, Stirling County officials were worried
about the break in the league programme.
''It has happened to us before. We go well in the first half of the
season, then comes the district and Five Nations' championships, and the
team loses its sharpness,'' I was told.
True to form, Stirling surrended their first two points at Hawick when
the leagues resumed a fortnight ago. They cannot afford a similar
slip-up when GHK visit Bridgehaugh this afternoon.
Skipper Stewart Hamilton leads a full-strength County side, which
includes the Scotland pair, Ian Jardine and Kenny Logan, plus reserve
international hooker Kevin McKenzie. GHK have not looked too sharp of
late themselves. I do not anticipate a shock result, but it could be a
tense affair.
The first result the Stirling supporters will wish to know will be
from Myreside. This is where Watsonians take on near-neighbours
Boroughmuir and, should they win and County lose, Gavin Hastings and co
would go to the top of the table on points differential.
Today's all-Edinburgh clash presents a mouth-watering prospect as
Scott Hastings continues his rehabilitation in direct opposition to his
former Scotland partner, Sean Lineen.
Out on the Boroughmuir wing is Derek Stark, the fastest man in
Scottish rugby, whose 25 tries so far this season have persuaded the
selectors he is worth recalling to the A team to face Ireland.
These are not teams who like to play it tight, so Stark may be given
the opportunity to show his paces. One wonders if the Boroughmuir pack,
in which the rejuvenated Peter Wright plays such a prominent role, might
just be the stronger. The boys on the scoreboard may be looking for
overtime.
In the run-in, Watsonians play Heriot's (a), West of Scotland (h), and
Dundee High (a). Stirling face Stewart's Melville (a), Boroughmuir (h),
and Heriot's (a).
Tony Stanger, another with his eyes on a World Cup place, is looking
forward to Hawick's home clash with Gala. ''We have been a different
side since Derek Turnbull came back into the pack. This is a key game --
it could decide which division either of us plays in next season,'' he
told me.
These old rivals never need an excuse for a battle royal; my money
would be on Hawick.
Melrose, for whom Doddie Weir is listed, will be out to halt a slide
as Heriot's come to the Greenyards. The Scotland half-back pairing of
Craig Chalmers and Bryan Redpath should have a big influence.
Edinburgh Academicals are expected to maintain their challenge by
overcoming relegation-doomed Stewart's Melville at Raeburn Place.
Accies' flanker David McIvor must wonder where he has gone wrong -- he
was first choice for his country against South Africa, yet cannot now
find a place in either of the sides to meet the Irish.
Another scratching his head might be Dundee High prop John Manson,
discarded by both the A team and his own club selectors in the space of
a week. His place against Jed-Forest at Riverside goes to Tom Smith.
West might pick up a couple of points at Currie, but Malleny Park,
like others, may require an inspection.

NOT that he needed any reminding, but Alex Ferguson this week has
endured an action replay of an old football maxim -- when you hold the
trophy aloft in triumph, the chances are it will fall on your head.
The man who has steered Manchester United back to the top of the
English football charts was yesterday contemplating a new year that
began with a CBE, and followed up with the order of the boot for his
star turn.
In his time, Ferguson has been laid pretty low -- by the sacking from
St Mirren, for instance, numerous defeats when he was primed for
victory, and the early days at Old Trafford when the tabloid vultures
were hovering over his head. But he has probably never been as depressed
as he was yesterday, contemplating the disgrace his French star had
brought to the club.
He was in no mood for lengthy deliberations but admitted to being very
down and, for someone of his resilience, that was revealing enough.
Ferguson has been accused in the past, with some justification, of
defending Eric Cantona when there seemed little evidence to back him,
but perhaps in his own mind was the need to be supportive when his
temperamental Gallic player was most in need of it.
This time, even the father-figure was hard pushed to help. Cantona's
behaviour since he became a United player, it would have to said, might
have taxed the patience of a younger Fergie, but, with maturity, he has
learned to be more tolerant of the volatile footballers.
When Cantona was sent off at Ibrox in the pre-season tournament,
Ferguson steadfastly refused to acknowledge his culpability. He has
maintained a similar stance through all of the Frenchman's
capriciousness, insisting privately that the man has often been the
victim of his own brilliance.
It is known, too, that behind the scenes yesterday, United were
furious at the referee in the match with Crystal Palace for his
ineffectiveness which, some United players believe, led directly to the
frustrations that inevitably turn Eric the Red into Eric the Mad.
Ferguson has never been slow to offer his views on bad refereeing but,
if he felt there were any such failings this time, he has kept is
counsel, and that would seem to be a wise decision. There was much more
than adverse decisions and inexplicable inconsistency in the make-up of
front page headlines this week, and Ferguson, like the Manchester United
board, were well aware of the immense damage to the club's image that
the events of Wednesday night brought.
Ferguson made up his mind that the Frenchman would not be in the team
at the weekend, before the decision was taken to ban him for rest of the
season.
Yet, in the midst of all the furore, the manager still took time off
yesterday to phone his friend at Cove Rangers, chairman Alan McRae, to
wish him good luck before their cup match with Dunfermline.
He could use some of the good fortune himself as he now faces one of
the most difficult tasks of his career as a manager. He has to inspire
his players to put all of the publicity behind them and play football.
''We have to do our business on the park,'' was his final comment and,
if his renowned motivating powers were ever required, this is the hour.
He believed, and still does, that Eric Cantona is the best player he
has ever had under his supervision. That has made it all the harder to
take.
Not many people have let him down over the years. It is a pity his
favourite player has gone and done it. And how.

NOT for the first time, the January round of the Scottish Cup is
seriously threatened by bad weather, writes Ian Paul. The snow came down
yesterday all over the country, resulting in two games going off, three
more organising inspections, and most of the others saying their
prayers.
Postponed yesterday were the ties between Clydebank and Hearts and St
Johnstone and Stenhousemuir, while there will be inspections at Huntly
(v Burntisland Shipyard), Montrose (v Hibs), and Meadowbank (v Berwick).
The word from the SFA was that most clubs were putting inspection
plans on stand-by and it might be wise to delay your trip until news is
available.
Celtic will have everybody available for their first game since 10,000
subscribers bought shares in the club. The importance of the new deal
has not been lost on manager Tommy Burns, who has the task of using some
of the money to lead the club into a new era. ''It is an exciting
prospect, but it is also one with a great responsibility,'' he said.
Burns knows that his side will need to be on their toes at Hampden
against an unpredictable, youthful St Mirren team.
Rangers travel to Firhill to meet Hamilton Accies, aware that the home
side will be dreaming of repeating that 1987 win in the same competition
at Ibrox.
Rangers will be without the suspended Alan McLaren, but Davie
Robertson returns after his ban. Ian Ferguson is out because of a groin
injury, but Mark Hateley comes back and almost certainly will be
partnered by Gordon Durie. Hamilton manager Iain Munro has Paul Chalmers
back.
Dundee United welcome back Scott Crabbe to their pool for the tie with
Clyde after 11 months out with a broken leg, but Andy McLaren has been
put up for sale because of ''disciplinary problems''.
Jerren Nixon will come in from the start after replacing Brazilian
Sergio during the 6-1 win over Motherwell. Sergio was not signed in time
to play in the competition.
If Links Park is playable Montrose will meet a Hibs team minus their
star man of the season, Michael O'Neill, and Gordon Hunter is doubtful.
Brockville could stage a thriller between the only two premier sides
in opposition, Falkirk and Motherwell. Neither has been in winning form
for a while but each knows how much a victory could mean this time.
It is ironic in the conditions that two teams from opposite ends of
the country, Aberdeen and Stranraer, meet at Pittodrie. The Dons have
Stephen Wright back after injury.
Dundee, top of the first division, and Partick Thistle, bottom of the
premier division, will have the field to themselves tomorrow when they
meet at Dens Park.

IAN PAUL reports on yesterday's swift moves to isolate Manchester
United's 'bad boy' from the English football scene
MANCHESTER United yesterday did their best to limit the damage done to
their club's reputation by banning Eric Cantona for the remainder of the
season and, although the club suspension only applies to first-team
games, that effectively means that the French player is out of football
until next season.
United have also fined him ''the maximum allowed'' under his contract,
believed to be #20,000, but the fact that he cannot kick a ball in
earnest will be of much more significance.
United may have still left the way clear for him to resume his career
in England, but Cantona does not have an impressive record at playing
patience. He walked out of France when he was banned for two months on
top of a three-game suspension after calling each of the discipinary
committee ''idiots.''
It is difficult to imagine the arrogant Eric contentedly sitting in
the stand for six months while he waits to thrill the world again.
But despite the reports that Italian and Spanish clubs would be
interested in securing his services, it is equally hard to envisage any
club investing excessive amounts in a player who has managed to disgrace
himself in two EC countries.
The FA had called on United to take responsibility for their wayward
star after his karate-style clash with a supporter at Crystal Palace on
Wednesday. They did not duck the challenge.
The club statement said: ''In reaching this decision, which the player
fully accepts, Manchester United have had regard to its responsibilities
both to the club itself, and to the game as a whole.
''The club and the player regret the circumstances which have led to
this punishment. In view of other pending inquiries, no other statement
will be made.''
The other inquiries involve the FA and the police. He still has 14
days to respond to the FA charge of bringing the game into disrepute,
but the hearing may be delayed until the police action is decided.
Cantona could face criminal charges when interviewed by South Norwood
police next week in relation to the incident involving 20-year-old fan
Matthew Simmons, himself yesterday banned by Crystal Palace for the
remainder of the season.
Cantona, capped 45 times for his country is also likely to be stripped
of the French captaincy and dropped from their European Championship
campaign.
United chairman Martin Edwards said that the possibility of sacking
Cantona had been considered by the board before they came to the
decision, which he conceded could damage the club's hopes of winning
honours this season.
Asked about the abuse Cantona has suffered at the hands of opposing
supporters, Edwards added: ''We don't want to condone what Eric did
because clearly it was regrettable. But yes, I think one has to feel
sorry for him and I'm sure he regrets what he did.''
Edwards had indicated that the player could take part in junior
matches, but the FA's chief executive, Graham Kelly, reckoned that was
unlikely.
''He will be suspended by the FA automatically because of his
sending-off. I presume that will be for three matches,'' he said, ''and
there will be an extra penalty, because it was his second dismissal of
the season. He misses four from February 8.
''I don't really think there is any prospect, given that we have been
in close contact with Manchester United for the last 24 hours, that he
will be playing for Manchester United reserves, 'A' team or anyone else
between now and the date of the commission hearing.''
It seems inevitable that the FA will make sure at least that he is
prevented from playing any football from that point onwards until the
end of the season.
Kelly was pleased with United's action and also the ''expression of
regret and apology from both the club and Canotna,'' but he refused to
say whether the FA would consider the action sufficent.
''I can't express a view on that. It would be wrong to do so.''
What has surprised many people is the pre-emptive action taken by
United as court proceedings could be forthcoming. The SFA did ban Duncan
Ferguson of Rangers for 12 matches in advance of a court case, but on
appeal, have held the suspension in abeyance until the legal action is
completed.
The FA seem to be hanging fire until the player states his case, which
will also give them time to know if the police are going ahead with a
charge.

IT IS the biggest banking scandal in French history, and one about
which the government is struggling, understandably, to remain as
discreet as possible.
Credit Lyonnais the world's ninth largest bank -- employing 70,000
people worldwide and 38,000 in France -- is reported to have chalked up
a #6 bn overdraft.
The bank, which has yet to publish its 1994 accounts, admitted
yesterday that it was in serious difficulty but said the figure was
exaggerated. Because the institution is nationalised, taxpayers, not
shareholders, will have to make good the loss. This works out, on
average, and on the basis of #6 bn, at #240 per taxpayer.
Financiers to international mavericks such as Robert Maxwell and
Bernard Tapie, and holders of hundreds of thousands of private French
accounts, the Credit Lyonnais was one of the five strong banking
consortia behind the #180m private hospital Health Care International at
Clydebank.
The HCI project was forced into receivership last November, after the
Credit Lyonnais lost patience with an Abu Dhabi finance scheme to save
it, and withdrew.
The French bank was first reported to be badly in the red last March,
when the government bailed them out to the tune of #600m. The bank sold
off #1.2bn of investments and announced it would be shedding 3800 jobs
over the next few years.
However, its losses are reported to have worsened dramatically. The
scandal becomes public this weekend with the publication of a book,
Crazy Lyonnais, (the nickname American financiers invented for the bank)
by a journalist from Le Monde, Eric Leser, plus a devastating report in
the magazine Le Point.
They describe the grandee habits of the bank's former director,
Jean-Yves Haberer and relate how his predecessor form 1986-1988
Jean-Maxime Leveque, became involved with Robert Maxwell. They claim
that Bernard Tapie, recently declared bankrupt, owes the bank about
#150m, which will have to be written off and, like the rest, paid off by
the taxpayer.
For most people, #6 bn is a highly abstract concept. Taxpayers are
learning, to their disbelief, that it is equivalent to any of the
following: the cost of 100,000 council flats, one year's deficit of the
nation's deeply indebted health service, four nuclear aircraft carriers,
creche facilities for 500,000 toddlers, the gross industrial product of
Luxembourg or half a Channel Tunnel.
Credit Lyonnais new director Jean Peyrelevade, representatives of the
ministry of the budget, the treasury, and the Lazard and Paribas banks,
chosen as referees, have until March 31 to hammer out the second
agreement in less than a year to save the bank.
Desperately anxious for discretion, the government has a bad hand. Mr
Peyrelevade, although appointed last year by Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur, intends to wring as much as he can from them, and has rather a
good one. Consernation is rife in the entourage of the Premier, who is
also candidate at the presidential election in May.
Various reasons are quoted for the bank's misfortunes.
Huge investments in the international property market, when the latter
was booming in the 1980s came to grief.
The former Socialist government often relied on the Credit Lyonnais to
finance nationalised companies in difficulty: former director Mr Haberer
embarked on an ambitiously expansionist programme, apparently unchecked
either by control inside the bank or Ministry of Finance supervision.
The Credit Lyonnais empire stretched too far and Paris headquarters
seems to have exercised little or no control over subsidiaries -- --
with dramatic consequences.
The Dutch Credit Lyonnais, for example loaned money to Italian
financier Giancarlo Parretti to buy the MGM film company. When he proved
incapable of paying them back, the Credit Lyonnais repossessed him and
now owns quite a lot of Hollywood it could do without.
Over the coming weeks, Mr Peyrelevade will be pressured by the
Ministry of Finance, in turn pressured by other banks, to sell of
outside investments.
He, on the other hand, will push for maximum government help. Either
way, the taxpayer will end up picking up a sizeable tab. And, with his
eyes on the presidential election, Mr Balladur, Finance Minister from
1986-1988, will be hoping for as clean and as quiet a deal as possible.

THE contrasting experiences of the wingers in the three internationals
a week ago underlined the wider obligations falling to that endangered
species and the pressure situations under which they have to operate.
Long since gone are the days when wingers could stay on their beats in
the sure knowledge that the ball would be served to them with space in
which to display their pace and arts of deception. They would be even
more likely candidates for hypothermia if they did that nowadays. The
ball so seldom ripples along the line to wingers now because of drifting
and augmented defences so that they have to go looking for other ways in
which to make an attack contribution either in planned moves or with
licence to pop up in the most profitable areas.
Remember how left wing Kenny Logan caused anxiety in South African
ranks at Murrayfield when he appeared unexpectedly at pace in augmenting
the attack line as an extra outside centre? It was a thrilling intrusion
and Logan is ideal for the key role with good hands, an extra yard of
pace this season, and a relish for tilting his lance.
Tony Underwood seems to have freedom to pop up for England when and
where he judges it most productive. Against Ireland in Dublin he once
deserted his right wing to hover in lee of a ruck near the Ireland
twenty-two. On delivery he shot straight up the left side with arms
welcoming a pass. He didn't get it. Instead the ball went wider to Will
Carling and his full back got over but couldn't ground the ball. The
younger Underwood thus provided England with an extra option and
momentarily checked Ireland's lateral cover with benefit to his
colleagues. His later surprise appearance brought a typical modern type
score. Once again he hovered well away from his beat while two of his
forwards made consecutive dents. Then he accelerated on to quickly
presented ball, linked to flanker Tim Rodber, and looped him for a try
that owed everything to freedom of choice, initiative, judgment, and
execution at pace and quick subsequent phase ball.
That segment also provided a good example of a defending wing's need
to be aware of where his rival is liable to turn up. Underwood's marker,
Niall Woods, tracked him all the way across field and actually got hands
on him but the Underwood pace rendered the attempted tackle ineffective.
Underwood selected strong attack situations for his surprise intrusion
forays so that if things did go wrong the opposition had a long way to
go to turn the tables. It also was to Underwood's advantage that his
pack not only provided sumptuous ball onto which he could make his
choice of entry but, in addition, had fractured the opposing defence
line before inviting the girls, as Mickey Skinner calls them, to provide
the classy touch.
Auxiliary full back operations as member of a back three defence unit
also have become part and parcel of the wingers' role for which they
have had to take on special skills applicable to retreat defence work.
Such skills have to hold up under the keenest strain. Scotland are
fortunate in that Logan, now established as left wing, has rich
experience as a full back.
Ireland clearly reasoned that the Underwood brothers might be
vulnerable in cover duty. Twice they sought, with angled punts, to send
Simon Geoghegan rocketing at Rory Underwood. The older Underwood has
endured some quaky moments in defence but he is now an old soldier who
doesn't flap. When the Irish popped one over the head of Tony Underwood
he did guddle it but had time to recover. Hopefully, with Logan in hot
pursuit of a Craig Chalmers placement, he won't.
It was a surprise when Craig Joiner failed to deal competently with
one Canadian punt at Murrayfield and, I believe, with another. Whenever
I have seen Joiner play in Melrose or South colours he has been rock
solid in catch and clearance even when on retreat and having to look
upwards and over a shoulder in the process. Yet he mishandled what
seemed, even in the difficult conditions, a relatively straightforward
catch. Perhaps in the excitement of a first cap appearance at
Murrayfield he forgot his technical points in being too square on and so
not providing a welcoming sideways cradle. That, however, is all part of
the learning experience which will benefit this talented young player.
Experience counts for so much on the big occasion when error can prove
so costly. Gavin Hastings later in the Canada game gave the impression
that catching an evil high ball with red jerseys and hot breath in the
vicinity simply is all in the day's work, his technique sure through
frequent repetitions over the years and his wide stance providing a
solid base with which to take the first shock of opposition engagement.
There are times too when their full back has ventured upfield when
wings have to travel wide or deep to retrieve ball and feel very alone
in the process. Logan shot latterly against the South Africans to make a
copybook fall and gather before spoofing the first opponent and
threatening breakout as prelude to a safe clearance.
At Lansdowne Road on Saturday winger Woods covered back almost to his
dead ball line and, bird alone, decided to run it -- against the gale
too. It was a bold, and should have been a wise, decision for he got
some pace on before delivering a good pass to Geoghegan but the darling
boy mishandled with empty prairie in front and his full back in support.
If Geoghegan had latched on the English might have been at panic
stations.
All of which suggests that there is a lot more to a winger's role than
standing out there, chittering, waiting for a pass.

LIFE has been tough for Steve Young, the man with the golden arm,
living as he has been in the shadow of Joe Montana, the man who took the
San Francisco 49ers to four Super Bowls in the eighties and won the lot.
Young replaced Montana in 1991 and had failed to emulate the man --
until now.
Young, 33, has eclipsed almost every passing record Montana set with
San Francisco. He has been named NFL MVP for an unprecedented fourth
consecutive year. But he knows that none of it will count unless he
destroys the San Diego Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX at Joe Robbie
Stadium, Miami, tomorrow.
Three times in five years he has led his team to the National
Conference Championship game -- a step away from the glory game. Each
time they have failed.
On the last two occasions the Dallas Cowboys beat them and went on to
Super Bowl triumph. Two weeks ago Young inspired a classic revenge,
throwing two touchdown passes and running for another score in a
comprehensive 38-28 win.
Now only the AFS champion Chargers stand between him and catharsis.
There has never been a bigger underdog in the Super Bowl than San
Diego. The points spread is 19 -- that is by how much they are expected
to lose.
They were nobody's choice to get to Miami, but veteran coach Bobby
Ross found a way to motivate them. Stan Humphries, the quarterback,
running back Natrone Means -- the ''Natrone Bomb'' -- and receiver Tony
Martin are the offensive stars.
This season the Chargers clinched games six times in the final
seconds. That is their hallmark, to struggle early on but outgut their
opponents at the death.
But can they afford to give the 49ers a start? They couldn't in week
15 when San Francisco roasted them 38-15 in San Diego.
Young has a cast of glitterati around him . . . Jerry Rice, the NFL's
all time touchdown leader, fellow receiver John Taylor, running backs
Ricky Watters and rookie William Floyd, tight end Brent Jones. And when
he is not on the field, the 49ers bring on their custom-built defence --
the one they assembled a year ago just to beat Dallas and get to this
game.
Lineman Bryant Young, linebackers Ken Norton and Gary Plummer,
safeties Tim McDonald and Merton Hanks, cornerbacks Deion Sanders and
Eric Davis.
It is accepted that the final piece of the San Francisco Super Bowl
jigsaw came in the shape of Sanders. He is one of those rare athletes
whose talent spans two of America's professional sports -- major league
baseball and the NFL.
A strike deprived him of his fat pay cheque from baseball this year,
and football free agency prized him away from the Atlanta Falcons and
allowed him to offer his wares around the rest of the 27 clubs.
Few of them thought they could fit his requirements beneath the NFL's
salary cap of $34.6m per club. Eventually he had to choose between
earning $17.1m over four years with the New Orleans Saints . . . $12m
($4m up front) over four years with the Miami Dolphins . . . or $1.1m
for one year with the 49ers.
''I want to win a Super Bowl ring,'' was how Sanders explained his
decision. San Francisco is my best shot.''
He has picked up a $500,000 bonus for helping them to get to the big
game with seven interceptions and many defensive plays. When he trots
out onto the field tomorrow he will pick up another $250,000.
Another gambler was linebacker Rickey Jackson. He accepted the base
veteran minimum pay of $162,000. After the victory over Dallas he
pocketed a $838,000 bonus.
You will hear their names called often if you are part of the TV
audience in what will again be the year's most watched single sporting
event.
Stan Humphries should take heart. The last time an AFC team were so
badly rated, that legendary playboy quarterback, Joe Namath, guaranteed
his sceptical New York Jet fans a victory in 1969's Super Bowl III.
Instead of losing by the anticipated 18 points, the Jets beat
Baltimore 16-7. Miracles do happen.

FATE has dealt Mike Gatting some rough cards over the years and did so
again in Adelaide yesterday, despite the fact that the England batsman
scored a Test century after seven-and-a-half barren years.
Anyone who expected to see a beaming former Test captain against
Australia was disappointed. For the death of one important figure in his
career and the funeral being held for another meant Gatting's day was
tinged with sadness.
Fred Bennett, who persuaded Gatting to spend three enjoyable and
educational winters with the Sydney club, Balmain, during the late 1970s
has died. ''I heard about Fred's death last night,'' said Gatting. ''He
introduced me to Balmain and the time I spent there was an important
part of my early career.''
Gatting's thoughts also drifted back to England at various times as
former Middlesex scorer Harry Sharp, who ''kept the books'' at Lord's,
was being buried.
''I'm delighted to have scored a hundred but it's a bit of a sad day
for me,'' he said.
Many had written off Gatting's international career several times
throughout this Ashes tour. But no-one other than the Australian players
seemed keen to deny him a hundred yesterday -- and even the home side
applauded when it finally arrived. But didn't Gatting make his
well-wishers sweat?
With Craig McDermott bowling well and Shane Warne giving little away,
11 runs from 89 to 100 took nearly 90 minutes.
He faced 17 deliveries on 99 and, when the vital single was attempted,
partner Phillip DeFreitas would have been stranded by yards had Steve
Waugh hit the stumps from gully.
That was lucky. And of course but for England's long injury list
Gatting would not have played at the Adelaide Oval after having made
just 57 from five innings this series.
This time Gatting hung around for nearly seven hours -- and repaid
some of his debt to captain Mike Atherton by making 117. But even with
that contribution England could only total 353 -- seemingly a modest
figure as Mark Taylor and Michael Slater led Australia to 81 without
loss by close on the second day.

COLIN Jackson, invincible in his last 36 hurdles races, should extend
the sequence today by taking the flat 60 metres for Britain against
Russia in Birmingham.
Jackson should provide one of limited UK highlights at the McDonald's
International, though there is a blistering 800m duel in prospect
between world champion Tom McKean and fast-finishing Andrey Loginov, who
ran him to within three hundredths of a second in the corresponding
match last year.
In the 400m, Brian Whittle faces the infamous Dmitriy Golovastov, the
man who was allowed to run 44 paces in the wrong lane without being
disqualified -- a blatantly political decision which took Russia to the
World Cup final in Cuba at Britain's expense.
''It would be nice to win, given the history,'' says Whittle, who also
runs in the relay. Fellow-Scot Mel Neef -- the sole UK women's winner
last year -- is down only for the relay.
Edinburgh student Phil Mowbray was forced out yesterday by flu. He is
replaced by Tony Whiteman, runner-up to him in the Durham cross-country.

BERT Paton has been called a few things in his time -- many of them he
chuckles at -- but the Dunfermline manager sits slightly uneasily with a
tag of headmaster.
Give him full marks, though, for doing his homework. Cove Rangers take
the place in the Scottish Cup today of the normal battle for promotion
to the premier division.
The trip to just outside Aberdeen, though, has just as many perils --
the main one being the Allan Park pitch.
The wily Paton has his pupils well prepared for a layout which is 10
metres narrower -- mathematicians will have noted by now that is 32[1/2]
feet -- than East End Park, and 10 metres shorter.
Practice, therefore, has been on a local primary school ground. All
that Paton could not generate was the racket that a sell-out 2300 crowd
will make so close to the pitch.
Cove were hopeful the game would go ahead, but there is an 8am
inspection.
Otherwise, they fancy their chances -- especially with New Zealander
Glen Walker in the side. When he was going through growing pains,
Dunfermline's results were always of interest. Now the former New
Zealand under-21 captain pitches in for real.
The Fifers have skipper Norrie McCathie back after suspension and,
striker Hamish French fit.
Davie Cooper's chance of running out for Clydebank against Hearts at
Kilbowie was put on hold after the blizzards of yesterday evening put
the match out of reach.
Raith Rovers coach Martin Harvey has the typical Irish forward-looking
attitude -- full of good hope. Before their match at Stark's Park today
against Ayr United, subject to a 9am inspection, Harvey said: ''Going
for a cup double? Of course we are. Let's face it, we're the only team
who can do it this season.''
The Coca-Cola Cup-holders have Ally Graham back after suspension, but
defender David Narey is doubtful. Ayr manager Simond Stainrod sticks by
his improving side.
St Johnstone's home game against Stenhousemuir is also off.
Sieb Dykstra, the former Motherwell keeper now with Queen's Park
Rangers, could be on the move again. Manager Ray Wilkins said: ''I'll
listen to any reasonable offer.''

JIM REYNOLDS shares the dream of a works side that lived on when a
shipyard closed 25 years ago
THE romance of the cup for most means a trip to Ibrox or an away match
with Celtic, or one of the other big names in Scottish football. For the
giants themselves it means going all the way to Hampden and the final in
May.
But for Burntisland Shipyard, the romance of the cup means a long
journey north this morning and a date with Highland League club Huntly
in a third-round tie at Christie Park -- a match which is subject to an
8am inspection. Jim Anderson, the club secretary, has been involved with
the shipyard for the past 40 years, and if and when the tie goes ahead
it will bring him a personal highlight.
''This is a piece of history for the club,'' he said proudly. ''We
have never reached the third round before and, although we are only an
amateur side, we will give it our best shot and who knows what might
happen.''
The bookmakers, however, have already made up their minds as to what
will happen. One in the north makes Huntly 9-1 on to win this afternoon,
while Ladbrokes offer 500-1 against the amateurs from Fife reaching the
semi-finals of the tournament.
Is Jim Anderson, once a shipyard worker and the last remaining link
between the team and the yard, tempted to have a flutter? ''I'll have to
think about that,'' said the man who has served the club as player,
committee man, treasurer, vice-chairman, and secretary.
''Our best run in the cup was back in season 1971-72 when we beat
Coldstream to get to the second round, but we then drew Elgin City at
home and lost 4-1.''
In their own little corner of Fife, more famous for its summer
hospitality towards the visitors who picnic on the huge expanse of grass
near the beach than its football, the shipyard lads are as dedicated and
serious as anyone else when it comes to the Scottish Cup. And, on their
own little patch of grass at the Recreation Ground, they have done
themselves proud.
Now represented by engineers, firemen, ambulancemen, blacksmiths etc,
and watched by only around 100 enthusiastic fans every home game, they
began this season's cup campaign back in September with a win over
Annan. Girvan, Civil Service Strollers, and Gala then fell before
Burntisland themselves lost to Whitehill Welfare in the Qualifying Cup
final at Stirling.
They had achieved their aim, however -- the first round proper in
which they received a bye. Then in the second round St Cuthbert's
Wanderers travelled to the Kingdom and were thrashed 6-2, with Rabbie
Matthew scoring a hat trick for the home side before a ''massive'' crowd
of 650.
Jim Anderson worked in the yard from 1950 until 1969 when it finally
closed and told of the struggle to keep the team alive. ''I remember we
were left with just #80 to run the side,'' he said. ''Before that we had
been kept going by subscriptions from the work and when it closed we had
a meeting to decide what to do. It seemed a shame to let the club die,
too, so some of us decided to carry on. The players don't get paid and
we have got by with raffles and things like that. This season we have
the Bank of Scotland as our shirt sponsors.
''I was only ever tempted to give up once and that was a few years ago
when my wife had problems with her health. She persuaded me to carry on,
and I'm still here, enjoying it all. We've had our ups and downs and for
the moment we are savouring being in the third round of the Scottish
Cup.''
So, how does he see the Huntly tie? ''They will have to watch Rabbie
Matthew,'' he said. ''He's good for about 50 goals a season. Huntly
certainly shouldn't underestimate us.''
When you think of all the nastiness and controversy, the whingeing and
criticism which has become a part of everyday life at the top end of
football, it was a privilege to talk to Jim Anderson, who exudes a
genuine love for the game in general and the shipyard in particular.
The only Huntly player who knows anything about Burntisland Shipyard
is club captain Steve Lennox. The taxi driver played against them once
in a Fife Cup tie during his days with East Fife.
He said: ''Burntisland were always in the Fife Cup, but we only drew
them once when I was at Bayview. It was on a Sunday and we beat them
5-2. They were not that bad a side -- about junior standard.
''It was quite an amateur set-up at that time, but they were far
better than an amateur side. They were quite big and physical and if
that's anything to go by we should not be too over-confident. We should
win, but there's no way we can be complacent.''
Huntly manager Steve Paterson faces a defensive re-shuffle as Doug
Rougvie is abroad on holiday, Arthur Murphy is injured, and former
Aberdeen player Alan Selbie is suspended.

SPAIN'S Arantxa Sanchez Vicario finally can fulfil her dream by taking
the World No.1 tennis crown away from Steffi Graf with victory in
today's Australian Open final. And that, despite major flooding problems
after a freak thunderstorm yesterday, still had the organisers saying
the match would go ahead.
Standing in Vicario's way is France's Mary Pierce, only 20, and in
irresistible form in her progress to the year's first Grand Slam final.
Neither fourth seed Pierce nor top seed Sanchez Vicario has dropped a
set in six matches at the Melbourne tournament.
Pierce, whose defeat in Paris marked her first Grand Slam final
appearance, is playing as aggressively and arguably more consistently
than seven months ago. She has dropped only 25 games on the way to the
final and her semi-final opponent -- World No 3 Conchita Martinez -- was
blitzed 6-3, 6-1.
Both finalists have been suffering with niggling injuries, with Pierce
receiving on-court treatment for a right shoulder strain against
Martinez while Sanchez Vicario has been suffering from slight tendinitis
in her right arm.
Meanwhile, Graf has been forced to postpone her comeback from injury
and will not compete at next week's women's tournament in Tokyo. Graf is
still struggling with the calf injury which kept her out of the
Australian event.
Finals, however, took second place yesterday as officials were
involved in a frantic mopping-up operation in a bid to get the centre
court fit for the climax of the tournament.
The modern Flinders Park complex, including the locker-rooms and media
area, was left ankle deep in water after its drainage system was unable
to cope with the volume of water generated by a freak thunderstorm.
World No.2 Andre Agassi was almost literally swept into the men's
final and fellow American Aaron Krickstein undoubtedly saved organisers
from major embarrassment by retiring from their semi-final with a
strained groin when trailing 6-4, 6-4, 3-0.
Had the match, which went ahead only after the retractable roof over
the main court had been closed, gone on any longer, the players would
have had to return to finish it today.
As it was, by the time Agassi reached his locker, the room was already
flooded and a power failure moments later plunged the entire basement
region of the stadium into darkness.
All the excitement completely overshadowed Agassi's achievement at
reaching a sixth Grand Slam final, completing a full set of all the four
major venues but the fiasco at least added to his reputation for playing
world-class tennis in any conditions.
Night and day, inside and out, the 24-year-old Las Vegan has proved
the master of all he has surveyed in Melbourne and is still in with a
chance of becoming the first player to win a Grand Slam title without
dropping a set since Bjorn Borg in 1980.

A SPOT of honest self-criticism and the power of positive thinking
helped Dominic Cork put England A in control of the second Test in
Calcutta.
The news, too, of Chris Lewis playing for England in the Adelaide Test
may have put some extra nip into Cork's bowling as India A crashed
initially to 47 for four.
Glen Chapple and Richard Stemp then made sure an Indian late-order
recovery, led by Utpal Chatterjee's brave unbeaten 72, produced only a
modest total of 216.
Chapple's three for 37 from 20 unwavering overs of controlled swing
and the under-used Stemp's two for 33 were vital factors, but it was
Cork's new-ball burst of three for 22 that lit the touchpaper.
England A begin their first innings knowing that a good lead will
almost certainly mean a series-clinching victory on a pitch likely to
take more spin as it wears.

FORMER Barcelona striker Steve Archibald could be in action today
against a team from the Highlands -- playing in defence for East Fife in
their home Tennents Scottish Cup tie against Ross County.
The Methil club's player-manager already has contemplated playing in
the back four this season in an emergency, but he has used himself
sparingly as a striker let alone as a defender.
Suspensions have brought about a near emergency situation for the Fife
club, who have two central defenders ruled out. Sweeper Willie Burns
already was suspended and he was joined on the sidelines when David
Beaton was sent off last week against his old club, Stenhousemuir.
The Fifers are a division above the Scottish League newcomers from
Dingwall, but they know better than to under-estimate them. The score
was only 2-1 in the Fifers' favour when the clubs met this season in the
B&amp;Q Cup.
Ross County beat Alloa to earn this tie and manager Bobby Wilson has
happy memories of the East Fife stars of the post-war years.
He hails from Windygates, a couple of miles from Methil, and as a boy
he watched his local favourites become the first club to win the League
Cup three times. Today he wants the Scottish Cup's most famous
giant-killers -- they won the trophy 1938 as a second division side --
to become the victims.
Kilmarnock defender Derek Anderson is available again and has a point
to prove against his old club Morton, who let him leave three years ago
after an off-the-field indiscretion. But the premier division side will
be without suspended defender Neil Whitworth.
With midfielder Alan Mahood suspended, Morton manager Allan McGraw
will look to his Finnish imports, striker Marko Rajanaki and midfielder
Jan Lindberg -- to upset the Ayrshire men.
Stirling, Albion are hosts today to first division Airdrie, while
Berwick Rangers have Alan Banks back for their visit to Meadowbank.
Graeme Hogg has joined Notts County from Hearts for #75,000. The
Scottish defender recently served a 10-match ban after a punch-up with
teammate Craig Levein.

Manila
NICK Price, celebrates his thirty-eighth birthday today as leader of
the Johnnie Walker Classic here at the Orchard Club, and the world No.1
is hoping The Fat Lady continues to sing for him.
That is the brand name of the putter Price used to harvest eight
birdies in yesterday's round of 67, for a six-under-par aggregate of 138
which edged him a stroke ahead of American Fred Couples, winner of the
Desert Classic on Sunday and also round in 67, and tall Swede Robert
Karlsson, who birdied five of the last seven holes for a course-record
65.
Colin Montgomerie, runner-up in Dubai, and fully recovered from his
back problems of the first day caused by a violent sneeze, shot 68 to
move alongside Ulsterman Darren Clarke (69), who has had only 53 putts
in two rounds with a #150 Scottie Cameron putter he bought in the
pro-shop here, and Australian Robert Allenby (70) on 141.
With defending champion Greg Norman shooting 70, despite being on a
self-imposed bread-and-water diet because of a stomach bug, ending a
stroke further back with Scots Sam Torrance (71) and Andrew Coltart (72)
the scene is set for another battle royal between golf's big guns.
Open champion Price, who says, not surprisingly, the ideal birthday
present would be a 12-stroke lead, switched to his large headed Fat Lady
putter the week after winning the Open in July, the club he used at
Turnberry to coax in that monster eagle effort at the seventy-first
having been consigned to his trophy cupboard.
The new one swiftly earned its keep by helping him to his second US
PGA title five weeks later.
Yesterday the amiable Zimbabwean holed five times from between 12 feet
and 30 feet for birdies before ironically three putting the short
sixteenth to drop his third stroke of the day.
Coltart birdied two of the first three holes and added two more birdie
3s, courtesy of 12-foot putts, to reach the turn in 33 to be five under
par.
He offset two bogeys with an eagle 3 with a 25-foot putt to be five
under with three to play -- the short seventh, eighth and ninth -- but
bogeyed them all.
Torrance who has taken to dowsing his head in a bucket of ice two or
three times in a round to cool himself down, opened with two 5s and
missed a three-foot birdie putt at the next. But he collected three
birdie 4s thereafter.
His father, Bob, can take some of the credit for the 69 for 143 of
Steve McAllister who followed a six at the second with a run of five
birdies in seven holes from the seventh.
The Paisley man has been working on his game with Torrance Sr and has
also greatly benefited from several sessions with Stirling sports
psychologist Joe McIlroy.

THE reigning European champions Hammy McMillan, of Stranraer, and his
team of Roger McIntyre, Mike Hay, and Norman Brown, got off to a fine
start in this year's Macallan Scottish Curling Championships with three
wins in their playdown section at Perth.
McMillan opened with a 12-3 win over Andrew Stevenson, of Glasgow's
Summit Centre, and followed that up with a 7-4 victory over Dan Stark,
of Forfar, and then a 10-6 win over Mark Fraser, of Inverness, late last
night.
However, Aberdeen's David Smith lost out by 10-9 after an extra end to
Graham Shaw, of Forfar, then went down by 7-2 to Simon Hartley, of
Murrayfield.
Defending Scottish champion Colin Hamilton, of Livingston, had two
victories yesterday, at Glasgow's Summit Centre.
The district qualifiers for the Royal Bank of Scotland Ladies'
championships are also being staged this weekend and in these, both
Kirsty Hay, of Perth, and Jackie Lockhart, of Aberdeen, finished
yesterday's play unbeaten at Forfar with three wins each.

STEPHEN Hendry flew back to Scotland last night pondering where his
bid to win a fourth successive snooker title went wrong.
In a stunning upset at the Newport Centre, fellow-Scot Chris Small
overcame pre-match odds of 7-1 on to overwhelm the world champion 5-1 in
the Regal Welsh Open.
It was the first defeat in 21 matches for the UK and European Open
title-holder and he had no complaints. ''I missed a black off its spot
early on and from then on never really got going,'' he explained.
Small served notice of his intent with an opening frame break of 59
and never looked back.
Hendry eventually won the fifth frame to prevent a whitewash, but the
former bank clerk's break of 41 in the sixth proved decisive.
John Higgins clinched victory on the black in the final frame to beat
Ronnie O'Sullivan 5-4 and earn a place in the last four.
The Scot raced into a 3-0 lead but O'Sullivan hit back to level the
match.
The next two frames were shared but Higgins had a clearance of 69
after O'Sullivan had missed a simple red while leading 68-0 which would
have left Higgins needing snookers.

NICK Faldo scored five birdies in his last 11 holes to make the cut
with a second-round 69 in the $1.3m Phoenix Open in Arizona yesterday.
The former Open champion played poorly at first and at three over par
overall after seven holes was well above the expected qualifying total.
He started his revival by rolling in a birdie 18-footer at the eighth
and four more birdies in an inward run of 32 got him home safely.
Hal Irwin, three times US Open champion, Ben Crenshaw, and five times
Open winner Tom Watson vied for the lead late in the day while Ulsterman
David Feherty made a welcome return to form with a a fine 66. Leading
early scores (Americans unless stated):
132 -- H Irwin 66, 66.
134 -- J Carter 70, 64.

MASTER Oats and Barton Bank, the two market leaders for the Gold Cup
in April, clash for the first time in an exciting contest for
Cheltenham's Pillar Property Chase this afternoon.
Since heading off Bradbury Star in last season's King George VI Chase
at Kempton on Boxing Day, Barton Bank has been talked of as the most
classy jumper in training. Surprisingly, his jumping is, at best,
erratic and it has cost him three races to date, including this season's
King George.
However, Master Oats is made of sterner stuff. Over the last two
years, he has shown improved form with every outing, and his most recent
victim, Earth Summit, beat some good horses to win next time out at
Haydock.
Arenice, the French challenger, beat The Fellow in June and may be
worth hedging on.
Reigning champion hurdler Flakey Dove, a half sister to Master Oats,
can win for the first time since March in the Cleeve Hurdle.
Although she has recently lacked the pace of Atours and Relkeel over
the minimum distance, today's extended trip is in her favour, and she
gets weight from all her rivals.
Southolt should prove the strongest in the Steve Smith Eccles Chase
and can confirm December form with top-weight Katabatic.
At Ayr, Ninfa looks the firm choice for the Mason Organisation Chase.
Gordon Richards' consistent mare has finished in the frame in all her
completed runs, and last time out won convincingly on soft going
(Sheelin Lad and Uron V held).
Northern Squire finished a neck in front of the smart Toogood To Be
True in the Dipper Chase, but faces a harder test of stamina in humping
top weight in this going.
A bigger danger may be Brave Buccaneer, but his win at Carlisle was a
touch slower than Ninfa's victory over course and distance on the same
day.
Ceilidh Boy has produced only one poor run all season and is worth
support for the Harcross Chase. He beat the impressive Brackenfield last
time out (Hudson Bay and Persian House behind), and came out on top of
Kushbaloo when they met in October.
Eastern Oasis may well prove to be the main danger if the going gets
tough.
* JOCKEY Dean McKeown yesterday chose snowy Wolverhampton to highlight
his comeback from injury with a win on Letsbeonestaboutit.
''Last year was a nightmare with just 31 winners when I came back from
Hong Kong in March and then I broke my right wrist and was concussed at
Lingfield early in November,'' said McKeown.
He returned to action four days ago, the same afternoon as
Letsbeonestaboutit, the horse who suffered with him on November 11, also
returned to action.
And it was the veteran sprinter who gave McKeown his first winner of
the season with a hard-fought victory in the second division of the
Annesley Stakes.

THE World Boxing Association championship committee have voted
unanimously to deny George Foreman's request to defend his heavyweight
title against Axel Schulz, of Germany, on April 22, threatening to strip
him of the crown.
At an open hearing yesterday, at which neither Foreman nor his
promoter, Bob Arum, appeared, the vote was 5-0 in favour of denying the
request.
Under WBA rules, Foreman now has until March 5 to fight No.1 contender
Tony Tucker.
If he goes ahead with the Schulz fight in Las Vegas, the WBA portion
of the heavyweight title would be stripped from Foreman, and Tucker and
No.2 contender Bruce Seldon would fight to fill the vacancy.
Foreman also holds the title of the International Boxing Federation,
which is not expected to take action against the fighter. The World
Boxing Council portion of the championship is held by Oliver McCall.

NO-ONE has been given a more bewildering ride on the managerial
merry-go-round than Alex Smith but, if he can never forget the
injustices, he has proved strong enough to throw them into the dustbin
of bad experience.
Smith recently celebrated 25 years as a manager, a feat of endurance
and dedication that some might call foolish but he would describe as a
privilege.
Club directors have sacked him, fans have berated him, and critics
have upset him but, all the way through, Smith has dusted himself down
and started all over again.
The man who will take Clyde to Tannadice this afternoon for another
tilt at a tournament, the Scottish Cup, which he has won twice with
different teams, is indestructible for one simple reason.
Smith is first and foremost a football nut. And faced with that
impregnable devotion, the slings and arrows can do him no serious
damage.
Deep inside there is a resentment at being sacked by both St Mirren
and Aberdeen, teams who have not matched the success achieved under his
stewardship since he was sent packing, but he works very hard at leaving
the fires unstoked.
This week, as he sat in his bright new office at the bright new
Broadwood Stadium in Cumbernauld where Clyde, the gypsy rovers of the
game after leaving Shawfield, settled in almost exactly a year ago,
Smith was much happier to look ahead.
Yet, he must have experienced a huge contrast when he took over
homeless Clyde two-and-a-half years ago.
His previous club, Aberdeen, were as big-time as you can get outwith
the Old Firm, the premier-division was his beat and full-time
application by players and management was the way of life.
''It was difficult to adjust, right enough,'' he said in that low-key
style that has become familiar to an army of young footballers. ''There
was no training ground and it was back to part-time work-outs on public
parks.
''That was hard to accept again but the one thing that kept me going
was the knowledge I was working with a very ambitious club.''
For an inherently shy man, Smith enjoyed the media attention when he
was at Pittodrie. The interviews, the build-up to big games, the whole
paraphernalia that goes with the top teams was fun to a man who had done
his share of backwood work with Stenhousemuir and Stirling Albion.
No-one paid much attention once he got down to work with Clyde, but
Smith's first thing to do was to win the second division title, as it
was then.
''In a sense, it was like going back in time to when I started but the
big difference was the ambitions of the chairman here. At my second
meeting with him, he pulled out the plans for this stadium, told me
about the history of this club and I knew then there was something
special for me here.
''I went to see the supporters in Glasgow and that convicned me even
more.''
Now, of course, one part of the great dream has been realised.
Broadwood is a beautiful little stadium and, typically, Smith points out
that he had only a short time with Clyde in their displaced times.
''If you think of John Clark, Willie Munro, John Cushley, and others
who had to live out of a mini-bus for three years, I cannot complain.''
Now, Clyde, remarkably, have 21 full-time players and are plotting the
course towards restoring the club's name to the major role it once
played in Scottish football.
''Our next aim is to get into the first division because we were
relegated through no fault of our own by reconstruction.
''This year would have been one to start progressing in that league
but now we have to get back into it.''
His team are only four points off the lead at the moment, but Smith
does not worry about the pressures of that requirement. He has embarked
upon a programme to give the club a broad base from which to rise and,
maybe more important, to stay in the higher echelon.
''The ultimate aim is to make this a premier division club.'' The man
who won the Scottish Cup with Aberdeen and finished second three times
in the premier division is once again absorbed in his club.
''This is a totally different challenge. It is about being able to
help a club with a great history, run by lovely people, and with a loyal
support. To take them back into the mainstream would be very
satisfying.''
He believes if he makes it, it will be a far greater achievement than
anything he has done yet, although he does not belittle the cup win with
St Mirren, their first for 30 years.
''That was special because it brought families and relations from all
over the world back to see the final and relive old times. Children who
had never seen St Mirren win anything like that were able to watch
them.''
At Aberdeen, the satisfaction came in getting them to win trophies
again but maybe even more rewarding was the sight of young players
coming through to first-team level. ''But, here, at Clyde this is a real
football challenge. The new stadium demands that we succeed. It sets the
standard that we have to match.
The stands behind both goals are expected to be started soon and
Broadwood then will be an enclosed unit.
''We couldn't possibly be the club we were a few years back when we
were promoted, relegated, then promoted. The stadium does not allow
that.''
The park holds 6000 but, in this division, Clyde attract an average of
1500 as against the 3000 when they were in the higher division.
Gate money, sponsorship by OKI, and backing from Clyde's long-time
benefactors, Joseph Dunn, provide the finances to fuel these ambitions.
''They are always very supportive. It really is a like a family
concern. The chairman has held things together. The manager is allowed
to manage and is involved in all the financial discussions inside the
club.''
This all sounds a touch bizarre, coming from a man who has twice been
shown the door by club directors. But he would not agree.
''Provided you work hard and get on with the job, you should have no
worries. At Stirling, there was a lot of stability, but there wasn't
really any at St Mirren.
''Certain members of the board would have run the club in a stable way
but there were others looking for change.
''They are much better now but I think what happened was reflected in
the way the club progressed afterwards.''
He has nothing but praise for the man who took him to Aberdeen, whom
he calls ''Mr'' Donald. The late chairman, Dick Donald, ruled in a board
which, Smith says, had total stability.
He does not wish to expand on that observation, but he has said often
enough that, in his view, a section of fans at Pittodrie got their way
and Willie Miller was promoted.
''I believe Willie needed a bit longer working with me before he would
have been ready to become a manager.''
People like Craig Brown, a former Clyde manager, gave him some
encouragement to go to the former Rutherglen club and he has not
regretted it.
Clyde, in fact, are the first club in Britain to have established a
football school, the Broadwood Soccer Academy, now a registered company.
''We have approximately 300 kids coming through from Monday to
Saturday. They work after school during the week and on a Saturday
morning. It is for enthusiastic kids of both sexes and also includes our
own selected kids for our own future.''
The man heading that is Bill Munro, who was once manager of Clydebank
and is now the local SFA community coach. The project is financed by
sponsors and Dumbartonshire Enterprise, but Clyde would like to think
more help will be forthcoming from sports groups.
Smith reckons that besides the chance of a few players for the future
and the enjoyment given to all the children interested, there is every
prospect that they are also creating supporters.
''It is the way forward for all clubs. They must be seen to be part of
the community.''
Smith and his wee team will travel to Tannadice without a serious
care.
''It is a fundamental difference between what it was like with
Aberdeen. Then you were expected to win the cup, never mind the tie,
whereas, with Clyde, you hope to do well but there is no pressure at
all. If you do win, something special will come out of it.
''I have never gone into any game thinking we couldn't win and, if we
organise our defence properly, we have some exceptional players who can
do things in the opposition penalty box.''
Three of his side -- George McCluskey, Ian Angus, and Graeme Watson --
have each scored in cup finals, for Celtic, Motherwell, and Aberdeen,
while keeper Les Fridge was in the St Mirren squad that won the cup in
1987.
''There used to be a big imbalance between teams in these ties because
the full-time side had an advantage.
''That gap is narrowing. Many of the smaller sides are full-time
now.''
He might be tempted to worry if his team do cause an upset. Winning
cup-ties, even the trophy itself, has not done him a great deal of good
over the years. But Smith has never lost faith in his own ability to
manage well.
Despite the fact that he has been dismissed twice when he had no
contract, he has no intention of having one with Clyde.
Nothing is forever in football but Alex and the ambitious club in the
new town seem a natural combination.
It will take a while yet, but he might well be a winning gaffer third
time round.

<HEADLINE>Crofters urged to fight against unfair areas in land control</HEADLINE>

CROFTERS must be prepared to fight against injustice which could leave
them as the party which benefits least when land and mineral
developments occur on their holding, the director of the Scottish
Crofters Union told a meeting of the union's Argyll mainland branch.
Dr Fraser MacLeod said there were many unfair areas in land control
which warranted major changes in the law. He pointed to the situation
with land and mineral ownership. Although the landowner might sell the
land, he often retained the mineral rights.
The union was encountering a number of problems in that area.
''Towards the end of last year we submitted evidence to the Lingerbay
public inquiry into a super-quarry proposal. Following a legal decision
in the Court of Session, crofters have no right to share in the value of
the mineral development -- their only right is to the agricultural value
of the land.
''The crofters in Lingerbay will lose a third of their common grazing,
and they will get a one-off payment of #6000. The estimated development
value or profits from the Lingerbay super-quarry is going to be in the
region of #360m.
''The landlords will make #42m, the owner of the mineral rights
perhaps #30m, the Crown Estate Commissioners #18m, and the crofters get
#6000.''
There was currently another planning application in front of the
Western Isles council for a second super-quarry proposal, he said. There
were also suggestions that there could be another in north-west
Sutherland, and yet another in Shetland.
''These are all crofting areas yet, at the moment, the crofters have
little right to benefit from that,'' he said. In order to remedy that
situation there would require to be a change in the law of the land.
However, the debate over crofters rights was hotting up, and many people
were suggesting that the Crofters Union had a big part to play in it.
''I firmly believe that we cannot shy away from that debate,'' said Dr
MacLeod. ''We have got to come to some decision on where we stand on
this.''
In England, the Country Landowners' Association is adopting a
different tack in a campaign to reform the compulsory purchase system.
They have recently cited the case of a 40-acre market garden which was
compulsorily acquired in 1965 for a water works.
The water works was never built, but in the 1980s Thames Water began
extracting gravel worth more than #lm from the site. The CLA are calling
for an amendment to compulsory purchase rules so that a purchaser would
be obliged to use any land acquired within five years, and only for the
purpose for which it was acquired.
They also propose that the original owner should share in any
commercial value of the rights acquired.
* THE Government have decided that the Meat and Livestock Commission
should continue to be funded by a statutory levy. That was the main
recommendation of the review of the MLC, which concluded that the
Commission has a useful job to do.
Following a consultation with industry representatives, it has also
been decided that two independent commissioner posts should be
established. The number of producer and slaughterer-processor
representatives will be reduced from four to three each, and an
additional place will be established for an auctioneer.
The total number of commissioners will increase by one to 14.
The MLC has been asked to review the role and effectiveness of its
committees with a view to simplification, and the statutory requirement
for a consumers' committee will be removed as soon as primary
legislation can be amended.

DOUG GILLONtracks down one of the fast Trotters
PHIL Mowbray brushes aside the invitation to a pleasant lunch in the
same cavalier way he plays down the label of Britain's fastest under-23
metric miler, which is how he begins the 1995 season.
''Restaurant? No, a student boozer will do fine -- I'm a Trotter, for
heaven's sake. Fastest guy under-23? Well, you're only up there to be
shot down. It doesn't really mean that much to me.''
The Edinburgh University maths student has already observed that
paranoid intensity is the lowest common denominator among international
athletes, and it is a factor which he does not wish to exemplify.
Though forced to withdraw, because of flu, from his scheduled Great
Britain debut today against Russia in Birmingham, his significant impact
on the sport is unlikely to be long delayed.
''My main target this year has always been the British Universities'
cross-country title next week,'' he says. ''Indoor selection came out of
the blue, for I've never raced indoors in my life.''
The laid-back approach is not for show. It is the fundamental
principle of his club, the Trotters -- Hunters Bog Trotters, to dignify
them with their full, rarely-used title. Anti-elitism and a
down-to-earth nature are pre-requisites of membership. So, too, is a
taste for real ale. Enrollment is normally completed on a beermat.
His club has its roots in the late seventies, when its co-founder,
Robin Thomas, and some kindred spirits, mainly from Glasgow University,
were pre-season training on the Isle of Arran. Running 100 miles between
Monday and Saturday was the formidable target, but the hidden agenda was
even more daunting: downing 100 pints. ''The company included several
internationalists, and a future Commonwealth marathon runner. It was not
just student pissheads on the rampage,'' insists Thomas. ''It was hard
work, back in the days of 10pm closing.''
Venue for the manic venture the following year was the Isle of Man
Easter Athletics Festival, a long-time focus for the lighter side of the
sport. Phoney clubs, such as the dubiously acronymic Paisley Harriers
Unathletic Club, remain a feature.
There, the Trotters were spawned after a committed band had reached
the ton, in miles and pints, in just four days. ''A log book was kept by
independent witnesses,'' recalls Thomas. ''Strictly no spillage, and no
throwing up.''
Mowbray began running aged 10, jogging with his father, Ken, the
former Kirkcaldy rugby XV captain and district back-row forward. ''I ran
a couple of half marathons in my mid teens, then was selected to run the
World Mountain Racing Championships in Zermatt, on the strength of
winning just one race,'' he says.
Afterwards, the competitors retired to the North Wall Bar. Who should
be there but a couple of Trotters. ''I was suitably impressed,'' he
recalls.
On arrival in Edinburgh, fresh from Balwearie High School, he was
unsure whether he wanted to remain in a sport which until then, had
meant solitary training. Then he fell into the company of Thomas,
re-discovered the sociable Trotters, named after an area in the
capital's Holyrood Park.
He has never looked back. ''I usually have a few pints on a Thursday,
even before races. It's part of the club culture. I like to be around
people who keep the sport in perspective,  But two Scottish junior
cross-country titles, the junior track 5000m title, and three Scottish
universities' victories showed his talent. The scalps of Steve Cram,
John Mayock, Mark Rowland, and Matt Yates, in his most recent race,
earned his today's thwarted UK call. But a consolation offer of an
indoor race against France at the Kelvin Hall in a fortnight would
present problems. It is the day before the Scottish cross-country
championships for which he is a title contender.
In the long term, he sees his future at 5000 -- that's metres, not
litres. It would be a mistake to write off Phil Mowbray as only here for
the beer.

EUROPEAN farm aids designed to curb crop production and regulate the
market are causing serious side effects, it was claimed yesterday.
Buoyed up by substantial subsidy cheques in the autumn, cereal growers
now no longer feel any urgent need to take part in the orderly marketing
of their crop during the rest of the year. They are holding on to
stocks, particularly wheat, in the hope of pushing up prices.
Counter measures operated by the European Commission, such as offering
intervention stocks onto the internal market and restricting export
licences, have so far failed to bring prices down.
While this has brought down the level of intervention stocks from 18
million tonnes at the beginning of the season to under 10 million tonnes
now, it has meant exports lagging some five million tonnes behind this
time last year.
This will make the Commission export target of 30 million tonnes
difficult to achieve, according to Andrew Barnard, UK crop marketing
manager for Dalgety Agriculture.
Britain had only exported 1.2 million tonnes of its estimated
exportable surplus of 2.8 million tonnes by the end of last year. ''This
means we have a long way to go to achieve our targets.
''Farmers are holding on to an estimated 20% to 25% of their crop in
the south, and up to 40% in the north and Scotland. Area aid payments
are certainly not helping, in terms of creating a regular marketing
plan.
The current area aid payments of around #190 per hectare make up
almost one-fifth of current total returns of #928 per hectare. This is
expected to jump to over #250 of next season's projected total of #938.
But Mr Barnard warned that as EU prices approached world values, more
variables would become apparent in an already volatile market. These
would demand more accurate knowledge of production costs, and the
increasing use of market hedges or contracts. Store hygiene would also
have to be improved, as buyers took a hard line on contamination.
Growers would also be well advised to make their fertiliser purchases
earlier, according to Gary White, the company's regional fertiliser
product manager. This was partly due to high volatility in the market
and changes in the world marketplace, and partly to huge rationalisation
of the industry.
''We are in for a period of generally higher prices,'' he told a news
conference at the company's Essex trials centre. ''The market for both
nitrogen and phosphates has gradually moved towards supply and demand
equilibrium during the last decade as a result of plant closures and
lack of new investment.''
* THE policy group established by Agriculture Minister William
Waldegrave to advise him on future UK attitudes towards the Common
Agricultural Policy has had its first meeting.
The composition of the group was criticised last year, when its
membership was shown to have no representation from Scotland. The
Ministry of Agriculture has acknowledged that the Secretaries of State
for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are jointly responsible, with
Mr Waldegrave, for UK agricultural policy, and has indicated that the
Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Ireland Ministers will be associated with
any policy developments emerging from the group's discussions.
Topics considered at the inaugural meeting included the type of
agricultural policy the UK should be pursuing as a long-term aim;
realistic ways to achieve a ''greener'' CAP; and ways of encouraging
change in Brussels.
Mr Waldegrave said he was confident the group would make a significant
impact on the development of the Government's policy towards the CAP.
''It will help me to develop new thinking on these issues, which I can
take to my colleagues for collective Government approval,'' he said.
The Minister plans to announce the outcome of the group's discussions
in a major speech this summer.

COULD it be that Scotland went their own way on Saturday as far as
centre play is concerned, a way that might need changed?
If you speak to punters, they have little knowledge about the ins and
outs of centre play. In fact, although we call our back line stand-off,
inside centre, and outside centre, the New Zealanders call them first
five-eighth, second five-eighth, and then centre.
They only have one centre, so their definition assumes a more
specialised role for what we would call the outside centre, and
acknowledges the similarity in role of the other two midfielders.
Their outside centre is usually the bigger man. And to think that we
used to play, in Britain, with left and right centres, fudging the
roles.
To try to clear my fuddled mind as to the difference, I spoke to
Gregor Townsend, who played outside centre against the Canadians,
although smaller than Ian Jardine.
''The roles are quite strange,'' said Townsend, ''in that in our
rugby, the outside centre, me last Saturday, sees less of the ball. The
inside centre takes more of the ball up to the advantage line, like Ian
Jardine did, to get into the pocket behind their stand off to give the
forwards a target.
''The inside-centre roll is more like stand-off in that he is running
man on man and trying to get through gaps. He is not expected to put too
much pace on the ball, that's something the outside centre does as he
tries to go outside his opposite man if possible, or the full back.''
Continue, Gregor, before this quizzical look disappears from my face.
From what he was saying it was then logical for the inside centre to be
the bigger of the two, if there needed to be a size difference.
''In defence,'' said Townsend, ''the inside centre is a stopper when
the opposing forwards get rumbling. At outside centre I was trying not
to get caught in midfield in defence so that I could drift out onto the
full back if he was coming into the line.''
But each man's job is more complicated than that. Outside centres have
to have superb hands, as most of the attacking moves that are designed
to get the likes of Gavin Hastings in space involve missing out the
inside centre altogether, and require the outside centre to take and
give an accurate pass in a blink.
The truth is that Scotland were trying to get their big inside centre,
Ian Jardine, as quickly as possible to the gain line to provide good,
second-phase ball so that Townsend could then run.
There would be less passes to get the ball to Jardine. From, say,
quick ball at the lineout, Jardine was almost taking the ball like a
bull in a stand-off position.
What we forget is that Jardine plays outside centre at Stirling County
to Matt McGrandles at inside, and one of their best tries was scored
against Hawick, when Jardine provided the threat at outside, McGrandles
the pace and hands on the loop, and Logan the dagger to finish.
The beauty of having a big guy on the outside is that he is a threat
at coming back on the crash, and so the defence leaves its drift out to
nab the full back until he has passed the ball. I don't think that
Townsend offers that threat. From set-piece ball, the threat that
Townsend offers is the outside break, which only needs one route of
defence.
Personally, I wonder if the New Zealanders and South Africans have it
right after all. Their ''second five eighth'' -- our inside centre -- is
inevitably a bloke that has the stand-off's skills in that he can be a
kicker if need be, and a blitzer of a runner if it's all hands to the
pump. Their centre -- our outside centre -- is the big bloke who stops
the opposition drift and comes back on the switch, leaving a trail of
bodies in his wake.
Townsend has no doubts as to where he wants to play. ''I'd like to be
stand off, and if in the centre I suppose I'd prefer inside centre,'' he
says.
Maybe his time will come. Maybe Scotland have their centre play inside
out at the moment. But I'm still confused.

CITY of Edinburgh RC could lose their top riders to England because
the Meadowbank-based club do not have a roof over their heads. Club
officials fear that riders such as Olympian Anthony Stirrat and sprint
specialist Stewart Brydon could go to Manchester, where there is an
indoor velodrome.
Now the club, which celebrated new sponsorship deals yesterday, want
to come in from the cold. Club chairman Brian Annable hopes that money
from the National Lottery will help provide a roof over the Meadowbank
velodrome so they can match the facilities in England.

HOW are all you business ''fat cats'' out there this jolly weekend?
Looking forward to the usual Concorde trip to New York with the
girlfriend? Or are you staying at home, struggling to choose the right
Merc for your daughter?
As we all know, life is really tough when you have the twin problems
of running a company and working flat out to dispose of all the cash
that keeps flooding in. Somehow there are never enough hours in the day
for all that spending.
The worst part is that you don't really want this large amount of
money and the inevitable recognition it brings. It's just that those
loyal non-executives on your remuneration committee keep increasing the
salary and bonuses package, sometimes without as much as a
by-your-leave.
If only . . .
Seriously, we do have a major difficulty in this country about
boardroom pay, thanks to the crass insensitivity of some major companies
and utilities headquartered in England. Executive pay is now a political
issue, becoming so progressively over the last five years.
The drive of the electricity and water companies to ramp up directors'
salaries from public sector levels to quoted company heights, together
with the unjustified pay-offs handed out by major plcs to failed
executives, have combined to create a compellingly simple image for the
general public.
All the emotive symbols are there: snouts in the trough, deals behind
closed doors, bosses prospering while workers' pay is cut -- it revives
all the traditional them-and-us images of our class ridden society, at
the very time when competitive pressure requires the closest of
relationships between management and staff.
It is made all the worse by the seemingly unstoppable flow of ex-Tory
ministers to the boardrooms of the very City institutions that benefited
from their past policies. When this abundant evidence of political
sleaze is somehow mixed in by the media to the executive pay
controversy, the result is yet another blackening of the reputation of
business people across the country.
Make no mistake: the coverage of the past week alone has further set
back the claim of business for wider recognition as our country's
acceptable means of generating national wealth. This is happening at the
very time when much effort is going into changing our culture to make
people warmer towards the concept of starting businesses for themselves.
And it is happening as the CBI gets to grips with a national agenda for
business to show to the politicians the conditions our companies require
if they are to be internationally competitive.
All of this means that it is no longer enough for the top salaries in
our major companies to be fixed purely on the basis of performance and
profit. The risk of becoming a political football, of ''doing a Cedric''
with consequent damage to the reputation of the organisation, must now
be seriously considered by directors when setting remuneration levels.
Our frustration in Scotland must be that the ''fat cat'' syndrome
hardly applies here. I can think of remarkably few quoted company
chairmen or chief executives here who have received over-the-odds pay
rises in the recent past.
Yes, there have been private company owners and partners in
professional firms who managed to trouser six or even seven-figure sums
between salary, bonus and dividend. But our research finds less than a
handful each year. In any case, if it's your own business, you are not
accountable to a gang of shareholders, and you just had a brilliant
year, why not reap the benefit? The tax man certainly does.
I suppose I am most concerned that once again the world of business
seems incapable of defending itself from attacks on this issue. We must
differentiate the Scottish business community from the genuine ''fat
cats'' that regrettably flourish in London and the South-east. It's not
like that here, we can prove it and we need to say so publicly.
Business leaders and lobby groups must become less afraid about
tackling politicians when they jump on populist bandwagons brandishing
inaccurate information. We need articulate ambassadors to communicate
the reality of life for those at the very top -- the extreme pressure
and sheer graft that prevent them enjoying the fruits of their
achievement.
Right, that's that off my chest. Now I must just go and check the
Swiss bank accounts . . .

MUCH has been written about how the bulk of the Scottish coalfield
ended up, on December 29, back in private hands, trading as the Scottish
Coal Company.
After more than two years of jockeying, lobbying, negotiating and
competing, the Longannet deep mine and nine major opencast sites were
bought by a rainbow consortium, its shareholders ranging from individual
miners and their union, the NUM, to the prominent Scottish Tory lawyer
Professor Ross Harper, and from former British Coal executives to
venture capitalist Murray Johnstone.
A great deal has also been written about this rare blend of political
consensus and market realism. But the details of the long march to the
creation of the Scottish Coal Company are so complicated that much of
the story remains untold.
I have heard some cynical observers describe it as a Janus-faced
venture, a worker-led buy-out of a state industry from one perspective,
a commercial business effectively run by old English fishing pals of
Professor Harper, from the other. Neither view is an accurate picture.
So what is the Scottish Coal Company and its parent Mining (Scotland),
and what can we expect of it in the years ahead? To find out more I
turned to one player who has lived with its evolution from the outset,
Nick Parker of Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Parker started off as adviser to the Consortium Coal Company, the
vehicle launched by the unions, the STUC, and George McAlpine, former
director of the Scottish Area of British Coal, back in 1992, to ensure
that, if coal were to be privatised, it would stay in Scottish hands.
Parker was, in one sense, a suitably symbolic choice. His father was
one of the team at the Ministry of Fuel and Power which after the Second
World War helped nationalise coal. He joined the industry in 1947 and
stayed until 1968, when he joined Scottish Gas. From 1954 to 1968,
Parker's father, now 85, was chairman of state-owned Scottish Coal. The
fact that Parker junior is a partner in a major accountancy firm perhaps
says something about the then attitude of venture capitalists and
merchant bankers to the proposed deal.
Parker's initial advice to the consortium was simple: ''Find yourself
a trade player.'' The main issue for the union/McAlpine axis, as it was
to remain throughout, was finding adequate sources of funding to mount a
credible bid. The final price paid, just over #45m, bears testimony to
that.
Two potential sources of funding were already in the frame. British
Coal's former marketing director Malcolm Edwards was acting as
consultant to the consortium. He had created the quoted vehicle Coal
Investments, but was initially more interested in bidding for parts of
the core English coalfields. The other potential source was Professor
Harper, who did indeed have a couple of fishing pals, Colin Cornes and
Malcolm Wood, with private coal interests.
Cornes had sold the Clay Colliery Company to Leigh Investments, which
was run by Wood. Around the end of 1992, Parker helped bring the
consortium and the Harper group together, to see if what they could do
together would add up to more than the sum of the parts.
For some time, while Ross Harper led the lobbying offensive to
persuade the Government to break up British Coal before selling it off,
it looked as if the consortium had found its trade partner in Leigh
Investments. Then, in October 1993, Malcolm Wood died and the running of
Leigh was taken over by Paddy Custis, a former GKN executive.
Custis reviewed everything at Leigh, including the commitment to the
Scottish coal bid. He decided there were better ways of investing most
of what had been pencilled in for the Scottish venture. ''We found our
trade player was no longer the big banker we had hoped,'' Parker
recalls.
Over the following 12 months, until September 14 last year, the
funding package was painstakingly put together again as a series of
smaller contributions. Harper, Cornes, Leigh Investments (on a smaller
scale), John Saville (a Midlands property developer) and Sir William
Francis (a former Tarmac and Trafalgar House director) regrouped under
the umbrella Northern Natural Resources (NNR), but eventually, for tax
reasons, invested individually.
Malcolm Edwards became more excited by the Scottish coalfield's
potential and Coal Investments eventually emerged as the biggest single
investor. Late in the day a Murray Johnstone syndicate and
Edinburgh-based Waverley Mining Finance, which had already backed the
Monktonhall miners, came in too.
Currently the 1000-plus workforce of the Scottish Coal Company --
essentially the workers at the Longannet deep mine, as the opencast
sites are mined under contract -- have 220,000 free shares among them
and the opportunity to subscribe for just over 13% of the remaining
equity. Until they take some or all of these up, the NUM holds under 1%,
Coal Investments has 33%, Waverley 26%, Murray Johnstone 17%, and the
individuals and groups previously grouped under NNR 22%. Banking support
came from the Royal Bank and the Clydesdale.
Raising the money was critical. But it was far from the whole story.
Making sense of what was on offer and doing it to an incredibly tight
timetable was nearly as daunting. ''There couldn't have been a more
difficult or complicated way of privatising this industry,'' Parker
judges with hindsight.
The prospectus was published in May last year. The shortlist for the
Scottish coalfield, including Mining (Scotland), was selected in early
June. Bids had to be in by September 14. Mining (Scotland) was told it
was preferred bidder on October 11. The deal was signed on December 29.
''The timetable was brutually short. Up until we knew we were
successful everyone was working on a sad-or-glad basis. The whole
preparations were done on a shoestring,'' Parker says.
AT the outset, potential bidders were given access to three data rooms
British Coal opened up across the UK. In the Yorkshire room, the nearest
to Scotland, there were 55,000 documents stored on two-and-a-half miles
of shelving.
''To prepare the bid we had to get through all that data and
understand the parts which mattered. The Government had taken the view
that coal was a problem to be disposed of. We were buying as seen. It
was very much like doing a hostile acquisition of a public company,'' he
comments. ''The hardest work for our team was the due diligence.''
At peak there were nine teams of advisers covering areas such as
geology, deep mines, opencast, marketing and sales, contract claims,
assets and liabilities, and so on. Upwards of 2000 documents had to be
copied, some to as many as 39 separate parties.
In effect the Coopers team project-led the bid process. Ross Harper's
firm, Harper Macleod, handled the legal workload. But part of the
problem was that, up until the handover in December, Mining (Scotland)
was essentially a shell company, surrounded by several potential
backers, but with no core management and largely part-time directors.
Somebody had to provide the glue to keep it all moving forward.
Scottish Enterprise made its contribution by paying for Brian
MacDonald, former Turner Group chief executive, to act as Mining
(Scotland)'s chief executive from September 1993 until the deal went
through 16 months later. MacDonald has now moved on to projects new.
Much of the rest of that glue had to come from Parker and his team, led
by Paul Brewer.
It was always clear that the Mining (Scotland) bid would be up against
rival offers. The Government had hoped that major corporates such as
Hanson would enter the race. In the end in Scotland, it is thought,
there were just a handful of seriously interested parties -- Mining
(Scotland), Scotcoal (a joint venture between Ryan Mining and the Miller
Group), and RJB Mining.
At bottom, apart from the highly unusual nature of the Mining
(Scotland) consortium bid, two other things distinguished it from its
rivals. One was its commitment to the longer term potential of the
Longannet deep mine. The other was the large claims the opposing groups,
particularly Ryan, had outstanding against British Coal.
Scotcoal was primarily interested in the opencast side of the Scottish
coalfield. Existing deep mine supply contracts with ScottishPower run
out in 1998. British Coal had secret plans to shut Longannet by the end
of the century. Scotcoal had to calculate, in its bid, the cost of
turning its back on deep mining north of the border and paying off some
890 miners by the end of the century.
''It's central to Mining (Scotland)'s strategy that it develops the
Longannet complex and targets new reserves in the Airth/Kincardine
coalfield,'' Parker explains. ''By building a new drift mine, it can
open up another 30 million tonnes of proven reserves and parallel the
life of the Longannet power station up to 2020.
''If you can get into those reserves and not pay too much to do it,
it's the cheapest coal to go for, including opencast. That's Mining
(Scotland)'s agreed strategy with shareholders, some of whom are
hard-nosed opencasters.''
He believes that the inclusion of trade players in the Mining
(Scotland) line-up allowed everyone ''to stretch to the full vision of
the business''. They are, he maintains, less mean up front, and
essentially more realistic valuers of businesses than development
capitalists.
Targeting a longer life for the Longannet deep mine allowed the
consortium to offer a higher price than either Scotcoal or RJB, some say
as much as #10m more. But the other big determinant of the offer price
was outstanding claims against British Coal.
These totalled #129m, up to #90m of them lodged by Ryan, one of the
partners in Scotcoal. That could have told against Parker's clients. The
various bits of British Coal were being sold warts and all. How could
you hope to set up a company from scratch which might, very early in its
existence, face a #100m claim?
''All the bidders had to say what they would pay both before and after
the claims,'' Paul Brewer explains. ''So, effectively, the others had to
show their hands.''
Parker adds: ''I think the claims served them ill in the end.''
And how did he, Brewer and the rest of the team get on dealing with
Rothschilds, the Government's adviser on the privatisation? ''They
harrowed our collective souls,'' Parker whispers. ''It was a good,
rough, tough barn fight. We let them score all the early goals.''
And whither Mining (Scotland) and the Scottish Coal Company? With a
turnover in the #150m to #200m range, ventures Parker, it is large
enough to float in due course. If and when new supply contracts have
been put in place for the post-1998 period, the expanded electricity
interconnector with England is fully functional, and the faith in the
Airth/Kincardine reserves is shown to be justified, the time might be
ripe.
''That would be a good time to invite a new investing public to come
in,'' he concludes.

ONCE upon a time there was a famous architect who built his very own
Gingerbread House in the midst of West Lothian. But the bad fairies must
have put a spell on it, because the house became sad, forlorn, and
neglected. However, if a modern Hansel and Gretel are prepared to roll
up their sleeves and get down to some serious restoration work, they
could live happily ever after in one of central Scotland's more unusual
homes.
The A-listed house was built around 1840 and is part of a complex of
cottages, smithy, dairy stables and cart shed situated around a central
courtyard. The whole complex was designed by Sir James Gowans. Born in
West Lothian, he was an architect with a particular interest in the
design, structure and texture of buildings.
Both a quarry master and master mason he became Edinburgh's Lord Dean
of Guild and organised and designed the 1886 International Exhibition on
the Meadows. Sadly, very few of his architectural contributions still
exist.
Gowans was also closely involved in the eradication of cholera from
the tenements of Edinburgh. His revolutionary design for Artisans Houses
still stands at Rosebank Cottages, in Edinburgh.
The Gingerbread House forms part of the steading at Gowans Country
Residence, Gowanbank. It stands in a rural location, two miles from
Avonbridge, 16 miles from Edinburgh, 22 miles from Glasgow and a
10-minute drive from Bathgate.
The selling agent says that the visual strangeness of the buildings
shows Gowans' obsession with geology and masonry work. The sheer quality
of the stonework has preserved the exterior of the Gingerbread House in
remarkable condition. But the property now requires total refurbishment
and comes with detailed planning consent, including listed building
consent, and detailed plans.
The vendors would be happy to show interested parties around the
exterior of the cottages which have already been converted and sold to
third parties, and round the interior of the converted properties still
remaining in the ownership.
On completion, the Gingerbread House could provide the following
accommodation: large open-plan room, with dining area, kitchen and
lounge area, gallery/occasional bed space, study/bedroom, two further
bedrooms, lounge with two fireplaces, bathroom, shower room,
cloakroom/wc, oil-fired central heating, gardens.
J M Construction, the contractors who completed The Barn (the property
still remaining in the ownership of the vendors), are in a position to
tender for the restoration of the Gingerbread House and, over the years,
claim to have acquired considerable expertise in dealing with the
idiosyncratic architecture of Gowans -- and to have established a good
working relationship with the grants authorities, in particular Historic
Scotland.
Gowans' work is undergoing sympathetic re-appraisal. This is a rare
opportunity to protect and restore a unique part of Scotland's
architectural heritage. Considerable interest in the progress of the
renovation can be expected from those with an interest in architecture.
The completion of the Gingerbread House will largely finalise the
refurbishment of the steading area from virtual dereliction to the
creation of a small by vibrant community within easy reach of Edinburgh
and Glasgow yet in a tranquil, rural setting.
Selling agents Henderson Boyd Jackson of Edinburgh are quoting a price
of #100,000.

TALK of holidays is in the air again. More people are taking winter
breaks than ever before and now is a prime time for booking summer
holidays as well. If you are still looking for a late winter holiday or
already planning your trip to sunnier climes, there are an increasing
number of financial institutions ready to assist you, be it with the
booking, the insurance or your foreign currency.
The TSB, for example, has extended its Cosmos holiday discount offer.
For the first 20,000 people to spend #250 or more on a TSB credit card
before February 28 and book a Cosmos holiday by March 31 there is the
chance of an 18% discount.
The Leeds Permanent Building Society is also giving discounts on
holidays booked through its newly launched travel service. It has set up
a telephone-based booking service and is currently offering discounts of
up to 15% on bookings from selected tour operators. They are available
to customers who use its service before the end of February and depart
between May 1 and October 31. Discounts of up to 10% are available on
all other holidays booked through the service.
Leeds points out that while other leading travel companies are also
trying to tempt sun seekers with attractive discount deals, there is
usually a catch. Customers have to take out the company's own holiday
insurance to qualify for the discount.
Norman Turner, head of insurance and investment services at the Leeds,
said: ''The additional cost of taking out a travel agent's own insurance
can reduce significantly the discount being offered. With our new
service customers can book a summer or winter holiday without leaving
their armchair, get up to a 15% discount and be offered competitive
Leeds Travel Insurance.
''Unlike some holiday firms, Leeds Travel Insurance also provides a
50% discount for children, which can make a substantial saving on a
family holiday.''
Travel insurance is certainly not something to be left off your
shopping list when you are booking a holiday, especially if your are
going skiing. According to Home &amp; Overseas, a specialist subsidiary of
Eagle Star and Britain's largest travel insurer, British skiers are
having to pay dearly for injuries they sustain on the slopes. Charges
levied by clinics in the major ski resorts are typically rising at 10%
or more a year, with Switzerland and the US by far the most expensive.
Most European countries have reciprocal health agreements but the E111
arrangement only covers treatment through the local health system. A
study by Home &amp; Overseas found that some European resorts -- such as
Sauze D'Oulx in Italy and Zell-am-See in Austria -- have no local state
hospital which means injured skiers are obliged to be treated at private
clinics where even a bandage can cost #40.
The cost of private treatment varies considerably from country to
country. For example, breaking a leg is cheap in France -- only #300 to
#400 -- compared with between #300 and #800 in Austria, and anything
from #7000 to #10,000 for a six day stay as an in-patient in
Switzerland.
Sarah Joannides, marketing manager of Home &amp; Overseas, commented:
''Breaking a leg can be an expensive business on a skiing holiday. While
skiers may find their treatment is covered under the E111 arrangement,
in practice many find they are still faced with huge bills. Trying to
gauge what will and won't be covered can be as tricky as skiing through
a mogul field. Travel insurance will cover you for both state and
private medical treatment, so could save you an arm and a leg.''
If you do take more than one holiday a year, you may find an annual
travel insurance policy will save you money. A new one launched by the
Frizzell Group automatically includes winter sports cover for up to 17
days. Two other main features of the policy are medical cover of up to
#5m and a 24-hour English speaking helpline. The cost of a basic annual
policy for Europe is #47.20 per person over 16 years old. You could pay
more than this for 17 days of winter sports cover alone.
Those over 65 can find themselves penalised by holiday insurers,
sometimes being charged double or even treble the standard premium. They
might consider Age Concern Insurance Service's new travel insurance
policy for those aged 55 or over. This has no loading for age,
irrespective of your health, providing your doctor allows you to travel.
It offers up to #2m of cover for medical and emergency expenses,
including repatriation to the UK.
An increasing number of holidaymakers now rely on their credit cards
for foreign cash when they go on holiday, according to the latest Gallup
holiday research commissioned by Visa International. For a free booklet
providing information on using your credit card abroad, as well as
practical advice on the UK's top 10 winter sun and ski destinations,

Money Travel Guide.

SCOTLAND was well represented in this year's Lambert Smith Hampton ski
event in Courmeyeur in the Alps. There were 27 Scots among the 300
surveyors, architects, solicitors and developers who made up the 61
teams in the downhill slalom.
Maclay Murray &amp; Spens came sixth overall and won the cup for the
fastest time for a non-surveying firm.
Other Scottish teams included Burns &amp; Partners, Comprehensive Design,
Ryden, and Noble &amp; Co.
Mike Ryder and Jack Thoms (above) from Lambert Smith Hampton's Glasgow
office were among those taking part, and they admit that the three-day
break was a test of stamina -- the apres ski went on until anytime
between 3.30 and 5.30am. With a starting time of 9.30, they were halfway
down the hill before they woke up.
Courmeyeur is obviously too cold for animal rights demonstrators for
it seems the village was treated most evenings to a parade of rich
Italians wrapped in full-length mink, fox and leopard skin coats.
Petroluem fuels
Botha's visit
THE West of Scotland Institute of Petroleum branch has once again
landed a top name to address it -- Pic Botha, the South African Minister
for Energy.
Mr Botha is probably better remembered as South Africa's longest
serving Foreign Minister when he had the unenviable, and impossible
task, of explaining his government's apartheid policy to countries
around the world.
Heinz Rothermund, managing director of Shell UK, will reply to Mr
Botha's speech which will be given to 1000 diners in the Hospitality Inn
on March 9.
The evening will be chaired by Bill Beaton, chairman of the West of
Scotland Institute of Petroleum, and other speakers will include
solicitor Len Murray and Robbie Glen, deputy governor of Barlinnie.
High-speed way
to fly the flag
I AM sure that you will agree only the best people read Business
Diary. In which case I have an item of news which should interest all of
you -- except those who do not want to ruin the sleek lines of their
Mini.
The Swedish company Nova World AB from Bromma is looking for Scottish
companies interested in importing its magnetic flag ''Flag It'', which
it tells us is capable of hanging on to the Rolls even when it is
travelling at 150 km/h.
Nova World says in its promotional literature: ''Government officials,
high-ranking officers, diplomats and other prominent people who wish to
fly flags on their cars at speeds up to 150km/h may use this Swedish
invention.''
Nova World even explains how such rapid flag flying works. ''In order
to make it possible to drive at high speeds, we have decreased the
friction caused by the fluttering, by perforating the fabric of the flag
whereby air resistance is reduced.''
Clever stuff. I wonder if it was tested in the Shetlands with the car
standing still? PS, to save you working it out, 150km/h is equivalent to
90mph.
Fun and games at
Duck's dinner
THERE was plenty of humour behind the scenes at a dinner earlier this
week for the British Incoming Tour Operators' Association which is
holding its annual conference in Edinburgh.
Lord Provost Norman Irons was host to the 270 guests in the City
Chambers, while the Edinburgh Restaurateurs' Association prepared and
served the food.
Overseeing the eats was association chairman Malcolm Duck, who owns
the Le Marche Noir, and James Thomson owner of the Witchery.
Duck pointed out to Thomson that he was taking the ''P'' out of him
all night, as his briefing notes had spelled his surname with a P.
Not to be outdown, Thomson presented Duck with a photograph of two
ducks with the inscription: ''Always behave like a duck. Keep calm and
unruffled on the surface but paddle like heck underneath.''
Duck was completely unruffled by this reference to his second name, as
his family is accustomed to having its legs pulled over it.
His father, a retired GP in Mallaig, is actually Donald Duck. ''He was
christened long before Walt Disney invented the other one.''
And, no, Duck a l'Orange was not on the City Chambers' menu!
Top hole plan
to raise funds
FANCY life membership of a golf club for #50? This is the offer being
made to non-islanders by the Harris Golf Club. The club is at present
raising funds to upgrade the nine-hole course overlooking the Atlantic
Ocean at Scarista.
The club has ambitious plans to develop the tiny course at a cost of
more than #50,000. Western Isles Enterprise has agreed to pay 50% of the
cost, while it is hoped the local Community Education department will
meet a further 30%.
To raise the remainder the club has already sold 104 life memberships
to non-islanders from faraway places such as Kuwait, South Africa, the
US, Sweden and Holland.
It is also offering businesses the opportunity to sponsor a hole for
#500. A local butcher has invested, while a local bank is also
considering sponsoring one, which could bring another meaning to the
expression hole in the wall.
Getting in touch
about tontines
BUSINESS Diary reader Winifred Duncan of Jordanhill, Glasgow, spotted
our item about Tony Burton, director of The Planning Exchange, who is
looking for information about Tontine Houses.
She contacted us to say she has in her possession a book called From
Glasgow's Treasure Chest by James Cowan, which gives details of Tontine
Houses in the city, including two which were situated in Buchanan Street
and another in the Gorbals.
Burton was delighted when he heard the news. ''We have a tontine face
outside our building on the corner of Gordon Street and Buchanan Street,
and perhaps Mrs Duncan will be able to throw some light on it. We will
certainly be in touch with her.''
Runaway success
called to account
EVERY student at today's Institute of Chartered Accountants of
Scotland's annual prize-giving ceremony in Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall
deserves a cheer, but Business Diary hopes the clapometer registers a
little higher when Vikki McPherson goes forward to receive her prize.
McPherson is the Commonwealth Games athlete who came fifth in the
women's 10,000 metres race in Victoria. Despite being exhausted, she
stayed at the finishing line to greet every competitor finishing behind
her with a smile and a hug.
Since the games, McPherson, who was Scotland's Commonwealth athletics
team captain, has been awarded the George Dallas Memorial Trophy for
services to sport in Glasgow.
One of the prize winners among the 160 new CAs is Kenneth Robb. He is
one of the first students to graduate outwith a chartered accountancy
practice.
Robb trained with ScottishPower and he picks up the Women in ICAS
prize, which could perhaps be better named. It is donated by the women
of the ICAS and can be awarded to either sex.
Gesture ensures
good relations
PUBLIC relations people have their uses after all. Jim Dow of FMS told
me recently that he was having a meal in the Roxburgh Hotel in
Edinburgh, owned by David Murray, when he asked the head waiter if he
could book for February 4.
The waiter, looking rather doubtful, said: ''Yes, but you can't stay
in the hotel.''
That was all right by Dow, but the head waiter then went on to explain
how he had been forced to tell a couple celebrating their thirtieth
wedding anniversary that they could have dinner in the hotel, but there
was no room at the inn, as it were, because of the Scotland versus
Ireland rugby match being played that day at Murrayfield.
The couple were very disappointed, as on their wedding night 30 years
ago they had stayed in the Roxburgh and they had promised themselves
they would spend their anniversary in the hotel.
I related the sad tale to Malcolm Brown of Carnegie PR, another David
Murray company, who said: ''Let me speak to Michael Paterson, the
manager of the Roxburgh.''
A few minutes later he came back to say: ''It's true the hotel is
fully booked on the fourth, but if the couple want their anniversary to
go into extra time, the manager would be glad to offer them a
complimentary overnight stay the following evening.''

IT'S not really time to start working in the garden yet. A bit chilly
still. But it is about time to be making up your mind on what seeds you
will be sowing, writes IAN WALLS.
Faced with one or two disasters in the past, you may decide to go for
seedlings. The tricky part of getting things growing is already taken
care of, by firms offering this service.
On top of this, you also have the choice of buying primed seed. This
is a very important new technique for gardeners. It is the results of
years of research.
The seed is germinated and then arrested. You must take your seed at a
specific time, usually around mid-February.
If you don't want to move into this area, of course, you can go for
coated seeds. This is a technique which is particularly useful for those
small and difficult seeds like lobelia and begonia. At all events, you
should be seriously thinking right now about your requirements.
Even ordinary seed needs some thought. Some plants take a long time to
grow, geranium being typical. To produce decent size plants, for setting
out in late April or May, they should be sown by the middle of January.
I haven't made up my own mind yet. Tradition dies hard, and for more
years than I care to remember, I have been faithfully sowing seeds and
pricking out seedlings .
Looking at the lists from Dobies and Suttons, I find it difficult to
make up my mind. The choice is vast . . . but the pleasure enormous.

IF you are completely fed up with your mediocre lawn, now is a good
time to do something about it.
Unfriendly weather and lack of enthusiasm may mean that all you will
do in the next week or two is a serious bit of planning. Putting your
lawn to rights is something which cannot be put off indefinitely.
What with moss, coarse grasses, weeds, and a build-up of that spongy
mat on the surface over many years, your lawn may well seem to have
reached a point of no return.
If all you are looking for is something recognisably green and
reasonably pleasant to look at, treatments will perk up the lawn.
Otherwise, it is time to do something about it. First, make sure that
overall drainage is reasonably good. If so, this is a bonus. If not, you
will have to face up to improving matters.
You need suitable drains and a suitable outlet. This can be a problem.
It may more be a question of severe compaction over many years.
That causes the lawn to be soggy but is something you can do a lot
about, with cultivation and adding large quantities of gritty sand if
necessary.
You have to decide what to do about the existing turf. It might be
possible by a programme of rotary cultivation, to turn it in and loosen
up the top 6-7in of soil.
I do emphasis you would need an intensive programme to achieve this,
and you would still have the problem of coarse grasses and weeds
breaking through by early summer. This could, however, be taken care of
by using chemical weedkillers. I am often asked whether a weed-killing
programme would kill off a poor lawn.
Apart from surviving moss, however, you still have to do a
considerable amount of cultivation to prepare the surface for re-seeding
or turfing.
Lifting the existing turf and stacking this in an out-of-the-way
corner as a rich source of potential potting soil can be a horrendous
task.
And you still have to cultivate the underlying soil, and improve
texture with sand. You may also need to resort to chemical weedkillers.
At any event, you want to end up with a weed-free soil, well drained,
well raked, firmed and levelled -- by mid-April to May, if not before
that.
Then, you decide whether to use turf or re-seed. There is a range of
turf around. You can expect to pay #1.50/#2 per square yard. Quality
grass seed will cost around #3-#4 per pound. At sowing rates of about
2oz per sq yd, the seeding costs will be from 40p per sq yd.
Before turfing or sowing, you will want to scatter on a balanced
fertiliser, such as National Growmore. Some gardeners prefer a
fertiliser with higher nitrogen content.
I cannot stress too strongly the need for making sure the surface is
really well firmed and consolidated. If in doubt, it may be better to
wait a month or two into early summer, to allow consolidation to take
place.
With drier summer weather, both turf and seed would require a watering
programme also.
If the thought of all the work involved leaves you cold, shop around
for estimates from contractors. Be sure they will do the job properly.
They could lift the existing turf and relay quickly, but you have to
be sure work is not skimped with regard to the pitfalls mentioned.

CLOSING down sales always bring out the bargain hunters, but it's
easy, in a rush, to buy something that doesn't really suit you.
National Savings is making a big fuss just now about its Yearly Plan.
To have any chance of investing in it you should get your application
form (available from post offices) off today. It has got to reach
National Savings in Durham by Tuesday, when the plan is due to be
withdrawn from sale.
But is it worth rushing to buy while stocks last? Well, unless you are
a higher rate taxpayer -- and that could include elderly folk caught in
the age allowance trap -- the answer is almost certainly no.
Pressure is growing for yet another interest rate increase, so an
improvement in other National Savings products together with bank and
building society savings rates could be on the cards. If you invest now
in the Yearly Plan, you'll be stuck with the current return for five
years.
The Yearly Plan is a rather strange combination of monthly savings and
fixed-term investment. It guarantees to pay a tax-free 5.85% a year if
you make 12 monthly payments of between #20 and #400 and then leave your
accumulated savings alone for a further four years.
Investing the maximum amount would mean building up #4800 in the first
12 months, which would grow to be worth #6217 at the end of the
following four years.
Tax-free investments are, of course, particularly appealing to higher
rate taxpayers. They need a guaranteed 9.75% before tax for the next
five years to end up with the same growth offered by the Yearly Plan --
most higher rate bank and building society accounts are now paying in
the region of 6.5% to 7%.
Pensioners who find their age allowance in jeopardy because of the
level of their taxable income might include the Yearly Plan in their
financial planning too. The interest does not count towards the #14,200
limit at which age allowance starts to be cut and your tax bill begins
to increase.
That said, better tax-free opportunities for your money could be just
around the corner. An expected further increase in bank base rates could
well spawn new issues of both index linked and fixed-rate National
Savings certificates which are, of course, both tax free.
Savers looking for tax-free accounts without facing the stock market
risks associated with a Personal Equity Plan might also take a look at
the Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts (Tessas) available from banks
and building societies.
It is possible to earn a tax-free 7% from current Tessas -- at the TSB
and Bristol &amp; West, for instance -- and those rates should move up in
line with any general increase in savings rates. The Dunfermline
Building Society is paying 7.25%.
If you are happy to fix a rate for the next five years, a new Tessa
from the Britannia Building Society (minimum investment #8200) looks
very attractive at 9.25%. Barclays' new Tessa account (minimum #1000)
promises 7.5% fixed for the first 18 months with a variable rate after
that.
This month is the fourth anniversary of the launch of the first
Tessas. A maximum investment of #9000 could be put in, spread over five
years.
This #9000 can be rolled over into a new Tessa next January, while the
accumulated tax-free interest will have to be withdrawn.
It is impossible to predict which Tessa will do best, although savers
in the most successful schemes can expect to come out with a tax-free
profit of more than #3000.
Not only do interest rates vary from one Tessa to another, but the
total return is often made up of extra bonuses too. These may be paid to
those who invested early in a Tessa, or who put in the maximum allowed
each year, or at the end of the five-year term.
With four years now gone, charts showing the peformance of Tessas have
been appearing, but these need to be interpreted with care.
In a recently published table the Royal Bank of Scotland suffered the
ignominy of apparently being second from bottom. The performance of its
Tessa so far was shown at #9970, well below the top figure of #10,846
from a small society, the Melton Mowbray. Both figures assumed savers
put in the maximum amount allowed each year.
The figure for the Royal Bank, however, made no allowance for the
substantial 5% maturity bonus due to be paid when the first Tessas start
to mature next January. That together with interest and another bonus
due to those who invested back in 1991 should lift the value of a Royal
Bank Tessa to #11,667 by the fifth anniversary, based on current rates,
which is well in line with other major savings organisations.
The Bank of Scotland's fifth anniversary figure is estimated at
#11,244.
But both banks look like being upstaged by a smaller Scottish rival,
the Dunfermline Building Society. Someone putting the maximum investment
allowed each year into its Tessa is sitting on a fund worth #10,725 at
the fourth anniversary.
That could mean a potential maturity value next January of just over
#12,300, based on current interest rates.

ONE of the first things people notice in a room is the floorcovering;
it makes an immediate impact. There are many things to take into account
when deciding what to put on the floor, perhaps the most important being
the kind of use the covering will have. Does it need to be especially
hardwearing, what is the likelihood of food being spilled on it?
Whichever room you have in mind, vinyl is an increasingly popular
alternative to carpeting or other materials. One of the major names in
vinyl floorcoverings is Amtico. The company is part of the Courtaulds
group and has been manufacturing vinyl flooring for some 30 years. Their
designs replicate a wide range of natural materials, from granite,
marble, and clay, to every kind of wood. Amtico will supply floors for
any room in the house, from bedrooms and bathrooms to kitchens and
conservatories.
''Each floor is designed and cut to the customer's own requirements
and they really are 'works of art you can walk on','' says John Harris,
the company's chief executive. ''Individuality can be created just by
the imaginative use of key squares or borders, or by highlighting
designs using narrow bands of gold, bronze, copper or brass stripping.''
Amtico floors come in a wide range of effects, tones and textures. You
can choose a simple floor in one material or opt for a complex design
made from a combination of products to complement particular features of
your home. There is an enormous variety of finishes to choose from and
each one can be combined with any other. Being made from extremely
durable vinyl, the flooring is light and easy to maintain, having none
of the problems which might be associated with its natural counterpart.
If you want to achieve a specific effect, Amtico has a Design Service,
available through local retailers. Once the retailer has the
measurements of the room, and the customer has decided on the product,
Amtico can produce a detailed working plan showing the complete floor
design. This is then sent to the customer for final approval, following
which the floor is cut to these exact specifications.
''We can do virtually any design the customer wishes -- should you
want your coat of arms reproduced at regular intervals in your hall, for
example, contact your local retailer and he will take the appropriate
details. These will be sent to our design team who, with the help of the
latest computer aided design, will do the rest,'' says John Harris.
As well as creating special effects for different projects, Amtico
also produce a range of standard designs, which can be customised by
choosing from over 160 different colourways, by increasing or reducing
the scale of the pattern to suit the size of room, or by choosing an
alternative border or a feature strip.
To help you decide on your colour scheme, Amtico provide a reference
system of complementary product and colour groups, which are detailed in
their Product Guide brochure.
Amtico stress that their floors must be laid by professionals. ''The
combination of precision manufacturing and the care and craftsmanship of
the installer will ensure that the end result will fit perfectly and
look wonderful,'' says John Harris.
''Our floors offer all the advantages of natural materials without any
of the drawbacks: they are warm and comfortable to walk on, light in
weight and easy to care for. You can have a marble-effect floor laid
upstairs without worrying about the weight factor!'' he adds.
''In short, we offer an extremely versatile flooring product and one
of the widest ranges available, which can be designed to suit individual
requirements and which is hard-wearing and long-lasting.''
Prices start at around #32.89 per sq metre, which does not include VAT
or installation. For brochures about Amtico's products and services and
details of your nearest stockist, call Freephone 0800 667766.

WITH most endowment mortgages coming under the shadow of such things
as cuts in bonuses there may be increased interest in the idea of term
assurance.
Endowment mortgages, where the borrower takes out a policy to protect
and support the mortgage loan, have been and probably still are the most
popular way of financing the purchase of a home. Increasingly, however,
people are starting to ask if they are necessarily the best, and the
disclosure of commission and other costs may increase their hesitation.
The straight no-frills repayment mortgage has its appeal, but if the
wage earner dies before it is paid off the family is left with a nasty
debt problem.
The Personal Equity Plan is beginning to make headway, the attraction
there being that while you pay only interest on your loan, your
subscription to the PEP gives you a direct stake in the share market. A
PEP mortgage is more flexible because if it goes well enough you may be
able to pay off the debt faster than with a fixed-term endowment policy.
Some lenders will allow you to put together a cocktail mixing
repayment, PEP and endowment arrangements.
With endowment mortgages the drop in bonuses, due to the poor
investment climate in the past year or two, has meant some borrowers
finding their endowments now look as if they may not provide enough to
pay off the whole mortgage.
Mortgage lenders work out how much you would need to subscribe into a
PEP by projecting expected profits to estimate what it might be worth at
the end of the intended period of the loan. It is only a guess, of
course, and depends on stock market performance just as endowments do,
although the insurance companies do tend to apply some ''smoothing'' to
even out good and and bad investment years in their bonus decisions.
An average growth projection for a PEP is around 7[1/2]%, not a lot
different from the average projection of endowment growth.
The Halifax Building Society said it was seeing a ''slight increase''
in the number of PEP mortgages being taken out. There has also been a
slight rise in the number of its borrowers going for repayment only
mortgages. Around 35% now have these.
The rest are paying interest only, and most are still relying on
endowment policies to pay off the loan when they mature. Interestingly,
only 45% to 50% of people going direct to the Halifax take endowment
mortgages, but 70% of those introduced by outside advisers do so.
Halifax spokesman Mark Hemingway said: ''Endowment is still a good way
to repay a mortgage.''
He estimated that about 60% of people taking out repayment mortgages
arranged term assurance to protect their families. Similarly, people
with PEP mortgages can buy protection through term assurance to pay
whatever figure is agreed if they die during the term of the policy.
Hemingway said that for borrowers without endowment policies the
society recommended this type of protection but did not insist on it.
''The number who do take out term insurance is growing because the whole
issue of having protection is at the forefront of peoples' minds these
days,'' he said.
Some borrowers feel they do not need this insurance as they already
have cover, perhaps through their employment. However, Hemingway
cautioned: ''That may well be, but that protection is not meant to pay
off the mortgage but to give their families something to live on.''
According to one study, nine out of ten people questioned agreed that
they needed term assurance but less than a third had actually bought
cover.
Most insurance companies offer term assurance policies, but the idea
of cheaper ''preferred lives'' policies is now beginning to catch on.
The latest challenge to the companies already in this market comes
from Swiss Life, the Zurich-based mutual company which claims to be
Europe's largest mutual insurance company -- although Standard Life
might dispute this.
The idea started in America in the early 1980s and more than half the
companies in the US market now offer a preferred lives contract. The
simple purpose of this is to reduce the risk to the company by targeting
the fittest customers and offering them a cheaper rate, giving the
insurer more customers but less risk.
Swiss Life said the normal process in term assurance was to accept 90%
of applicants at ordinary rates, but it pointed out that this meant the
healthier ones were effectively subsidising those whose expected
mortality was worse.
It is now offering, through independent financial advisers, a ''select
lives'' plan which it claims will ''offer significantly reduced rates,
rewarding those who lead healthy lifestyles''. This is available to
people wanting cover for #100,000 or more.
David Kneeshaw, the company's head of marketing, said: ''The trend to
preferred lives is the order of the day for the term market. It means
that if you pass the medical test you get a cheaper rate.''
To compete with companies already in this sector of the market, such
as Sun Alliance, he said it would accept people as non-smokers if they
had given up all forms of tobacco for at least two years. That compares
with five years for a rival company, but he said: ''We feel that if
you've given up for two years you have made the commitment.''
To qualify for the cheaper rates, the customer is checked on a points
system with 85 out of a possible 120 needed for the best rates.
Contrasting that with another company which, he said, failed applicants
if they missed out on any one of 10 questions, he added: ''If you are
too tough you do not get the business. We want to get a 50% pass rate.''
That, he said, compared to a 20% to 30% rate with at least one other
company.
The medical, which includes such things as blood pressure, pulse and
saliva checks but not a blood test, is carried out by a paramedic

A DETAILED guide to pensions is to be published by John Wiley &amp; Sons.
Entitled Pension Power -- Understand And Control Your Most Valuable
Asset, the book explains all aspects of pensions, including topping up a
company pension, transfers, retiring abroad, executive plans and pension
fund investment. It will be published on February 9 at a cost of #9.99.
Author Debbie Harrison commented: ''Lack of understanding of the
working of pension schemes, combined with a fear of legal action if a
mistake occurs, leaves employees, employers and pension fund trustees
highly dependent on expensive, sometimes unreliable, professional
advice.''
Stepped income
THE Royal Bank of Scotland is offering a stepped income account, with
gross interest paid annually starting at 7%, rising to 11.5% in the
fifth year. Monthly income rates are slightly less. Minimum and maximum
investments are #5000 and #200,000 respectively.
Investment trust
JUPITER Tyndall is launching a new investment trust which will invest
in other trusts. Called the Investment Trust of Investment Trusts, it
will be managed by Martin Hamilton-Sharp who was responsible until
recently for running Equitable Life's unit trust of investment trusts.
This achieved growth since launch in 1984 of 274% against 156% for the
All-Share Index.
The offer of shares will include warrants in the ratio of one-for-five
and, as an unusual feature, they will receive an annual dividend of
4.4p. Up to 12 million units will be the subject of a placing and public
offer.

The property at 78 Derngate, Northampton, was Charles Rennie
Mackintosh's last major design project, and features many items and
furniture which display his genius in full flight. Yet the property is
unlikely to sell for much more than #100,000.
Eileen Crone found out why.
WHEN you consider that a Charles Rennie Mackintosh watercolour, Yellow
Tulips, sold for #160,000 at a Christie's sale in Edinburgh recently,
and that a Mackintosh writing desk was bought at auction for #793,500
last February, it is reasonable to imagine that one of the very few
houses with the authentic Mackintosh stamp would be worth a substantial
sum.
Why then, has No.78 Derngate come on to the market without avid
collectors bidding to snap it up?
The conversion in 1916 of the simple nineteenth-century terrace house
in the centre of Northampton for famous model locomotive maker Wenman J
Basset-Lowke was Mackinitosh's last major design project. It once
contained many gems of architecture, furniture design and interior
decoration, and original features such as fireplaces, the lattice
stairscreen and the front door, still remain.
A great deal of the furniture was taken on to New Ways, the next home
of CRM's patron, W J Bassett-Lowke, and what has been saved went to
museums in Glasgow, Northampton, Brighton and London.
No one who has seen it will forget CRM's striking striped bedroom on
display at Glasgow University's Hunterian Art Gallery. This is a replica
of his revised design for the guest bedroom in 78 Derngate.
At the time of the conversion, Mackintosh was living in London and
Basset-Lowke was a committed Modernist and a founder member of the
Design and Industries Association. He also proved to be a demanding
client with his own strong ideas on design. The outcome was an amazing
collaboration between the two men.
As Patricia Douglas, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society
in Glasgow, says: ''No.78 Derngate presents schemes unparalleled in
Charles Rennie Mackintosh's oeuvre.
''He made a great use of space, using every square inch in an exciting
way. Goodness knows what he would have created if he had gone on to a
larger commission.''
In this tiny domestic setting, the colour was predominantly black,
stencils were geometric triangles and squares in bright colours, and the
furniture design was of a higher quality than Charles Rennie
Mackintosh's Glasgow pieces, made by professional furniture makers as
opposed to joiners.
The guest bedroom and the newly constructed lounge-hall were
particularly stunning.
No.78's front door would have been the only clue to what lay behind.
It was painted black with glass triangles and had a stepped architrave,
reminiscent of the west elevation of the Glasgow School of Art. Once
over the threshold, the lounge-hall would have been startling to the
first-time visitor.
A small room, it was painted black -- even the ceiling -- with a
dramatic, deep stencil frieze and lattice stair screen inlaid with glass
and an early plastic called Erinoid.
There were brilliant colours of vermillion, yellow, blue, emerald
green and grey. Yellow was one of the few colours Bassett-Lowke, who was
thought to be colour blind, could see.
The revised guest bedroom (1919) was a striking note on which to end a
brilliant career. It was on the top floor of the tall, narrow house and
incorporated 12 pieces of furniture in a room 12ft square.
There were two single beds, a wardrobe, cheval mirror, two chairs,
luggage stool, dressing table and mirror, bedside cabinet and stool. The
timber furniture was in unstained oak with edgings of black with blue
squares. A stunning canopy-effect was created with striped
black-and-white and ultramarine ribbon.
The many articles on the design of 78 Derngate never mentioned
Mackintosh's name, and lacking wider recognition and further designs
commissions, he and his wife Margaret went off to France in 1920 to
concentrate on painting.
The Northampton property is one of a number of buildings on a 4.5 acre
site in a conservation area in the city centre left vacant two years ago
when Northampton High School for Girls moved to its new site at
Hardingstone.
Geoff Davey, of chartered surveyors Montagu Evans, advises that a
typical value for a property in that area is around #50,000, and though
he hopes No.78 will attract a considerable premium, he does not expect
the price to go much above double that.
The property requires a lot of work, is in a conservation area, and it
carries the burden of Grade II listing. The interiors have recently been
given star status, which means that no alterations are allowed and no
removal of the remaining fixtures and fittings.
Mr Davey says: ''While there has been a lot of interest, the private
collector cannot purchase a fireplace or a hall screen and take it home
to admire. This is a difficult concept: a collectable item that is
immovable.
''It is also an unusual notion for a domestic purchaser -- the
property is in a very cramped space over four levels. It would not be
easy to live in.''
One brave buyer could be the Northampton Borough Council, who would
like to acquire the property as part of its programme of city centre
regeneration. The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society in Glasgow has been
advising the council on the possibilities of developing No.78 and the
adjacent No.80 as a heritage centre, and the problem has been one of
funding rather than ideas and support.
Rodger Alder, Northampton's planning committee chairman, says: ''We
have to achieve a balancing act. The council has to try and purchase
No.78 and No.80 (for the support services needed by a heritage centre)
for the cheapest price, and the school's trust is legally bound to try
to get the best price possible.
''We are hopeful that we can reach a compromise in the near future.''
The Mackintosh curator at the Hunterian Art Gallery, Pamela Robertson,
says: ''Monetary value aside, the immediate problem for the borough
council is to secure ownership, so that the property can be restored.
There are a number of options as to funding for the restoration.''

* My wife and I have a range of investments in PEPs, investment bonds,
shares, building society accounts and National Savings. Due to some poor
performances, particularly with the Henderson PEPs, I feel I could do
much better. I am 68 and my wife 64. Apart from company dividends no
income has been taken. I am in receipt of pensions, including the State
retirement pension, of #7500 and my wife #1770. We do not have a
mortgage and our house is worth about #80,000.
We are now thinking of taking some income from our investments, but
are also interested in maintaining reasonable capital growth.
We each have a Henderson PEP, valued in October at #6156 from an
investment of #5076 in January 1990. I also have a Gartmore PEP, valued
at #5659 in October from an investment of #6000 in March.
We have three investment bonds in joint names -- M&amp;G Flexible Bonds,
worth #26,366 in March from an investment of #20,000 in January 1990;
Sun Life Flexible Bonds, worth #22,771 in March from an investment of
#15,000 in January 1990; and Sun Life Distribution, worth #18,633 in
March from an investment of #17,000 in March 1993.
In addition, I have 1180 British Telecom, 1180 Hydro Electric and 960
Highland Distilleries shares; my wife has 400 British Gas and 720
Highland. She also has #7738 in a Woolwich Tessa and I have #4979. She
has #15,628 in Woolwich Premier 90, #10,850 in Prime Gold, and #6150 in
National Savings (35th issue).
* A substantial part of your capital was invested in January 1990 when
the stock market was relatively strong, but it dropped back sharply as
the recession took hold and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait upset global
markets. The market peaked in early February last year, but then fell
away as first the US and then the UK raised interest rates.
Between January 1990 and March 1994 the FTSE-100 rose by about
one-third and between January 1990 and October 1994 by about 25%. So it
has not been a good period for capital growth. But you have not taken
any income from your PEPs and investment bonds, most of which,
therefore, seem to have turned in rather unexciting performances.
Your desire to supplement your modest pensions by taking income from
your investments is understandable. Indeed, the main purpose of invested
capital is to provide extra income in retirement.
We estimate that you have assets of around #145,000 in addition to
your house. This is a substantial sum which deserves to be well
invested. It is capable of providing a decent income. The average return
on equities is 4%, and on Government stocks over 8%, rather more than
can be obtained from building societies.
It is for you to decide how much extra income you would like, but your
capital is sufficient to generate #6000 or #7000 before tax and still
leave scope for growth.
We are not happy about your dependence on three investment bonds,
which account for 45% of your total capital. Over one-third is in
Tessas, other building society deposits, and National Savings, from
which you have not been taking an income. This seems too high.
You have only a small proportion of your funds in equities, and we
would strongly recommend you consult a good stockbroker about putting
your funds to better use. He or she will review your existing
investments and suggest changes in the light of your desire to enjoy
some income while leaving scope for growth.
If necessary, the Stock Exchange in Glasgow will provide a list of
stockbrokers.

HAS the wrong man gone at Kingfisher? The departure of Alan Smith from
the chief executive's post is the last thing the City wanted to hear
from Kingfisher, the retail conglomerate whose trading formats include B
&amp;Q, Woolworths and Comet.
In addition to Alan Smith's departure, finance director James
Kerr-Muir is also leaving the group on 30 April, about the time of the
publication of the 1994/95 report and accounts. He was appointed finance
director in 1992 after a career at Tate &amp; Lyle.
Mr Smith only joined Kingfisher in April 1993 from Marks &amp; Spencer
where he was a director, holding a variety of responsibilities in the UK
and overseas. He can expect to receive a generous compensation package
for his loss of office. Mr Smith's renumeration package last year is
thought to have been around #1m.
Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy has relinquished his duties as chairman and is to
become chief executive. The board is seeking a new non-executive
chairman from outside the company.
Kingfisher's deputy chairman Sir Nigel Mobbs, who is to become
chairman until an outsider is appointed, said that the non-executive
directors had been concerned about the falling Kingfisher share price --
it has halved in less than 15 months -- for some time.
The decision to act was prompted by last week's publication of a
dismal trading statement showing mounting problems within the group and
a warning that dealing with these problems may require an exceptional
charge of up to #100m.
Although Kingfisher denied that a personality clash was behind the
boardroom departures the approach of Sir Geoffrey and Alan Smith to
running the business was very different. Following Mr Smith's departure
no doubt the remaining Kingfisher will reconfirm their commitment to the
trading stategy of ''Every Day Low Prices'', (EDLP), a business school
theory imported from the US which has not even proved its worth over
there.
Kingfisher's recent lacklustre record speaks for itself. In its recent
trading statement the group reported sales growth of 4.1% in its retail
operations although that masked a 10.6% decline at its Comet electrical
retailer, number two in the UK to Dixons.
Woolworths was again caught out at Christmas and its sales were
static.
Sir Geoffrey is overseeing the thorough review of Woolworth and
Comet's trading strategies and will be taking additional measures
designed to improve their performance. Sir Nigel Mobbs dismissed
speculation about a possible sale of the loss-making Comet chain and
talk of a bid for Darty, its successful French electricals business
acquired in May 1993.
B &amp; Q, arguably the flagship of the group, as market leader in UK DIY
with 15% market share, showed like-for-like growth of just 1.8%. This
even before the Texas Homecare takeover by Sainsbury's Homebase.
Sainsbury's superior systems and products will give B &amp; Q a serious run
for its money.
The poor trading statement had City analysts rushing to downgrade
their profit forecasts. In the current financial year it is expected to
make pre-tax profits of #280m compared with #310.6m in 1994.
Undoutedly Sir Geoffrey and his team were the right people to lead
Kingfisher during the 1980s but the time has now come for a new team to
come in and try to deliver the goods that Kingfisher has patently failed
to deliver in recent times.
Yesterday's surprise boardroom changes prompted speculation in the
City that Kingfisher could be a bid target. Home Depot, the US DIY chain
and Costco, the US warehouse club, have been mooted as potential
suitors.
There was even talk of Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, and a
former finance director of Kingfisher, being enticed back to Kingfisher.
Asda's retail strategy is also geared towards offering exceptional value
for money including competitive prices.
However talk of Archie Norman moving to Kingfisher was dismissed by an
Asda insider who said ''we don't see where the gap is''. Indeed with
lots of work still to do running the ship at Asda it is difficult to see
what role Mr Norman would assume at Kingfisher. He is hardly likely to
want to return to the role of finance director and Sir Geoffrey is
unlikely to sanction his appointment as non-executive chairman.
Only bid speculation will support Kingfisher shares in the short term.
(They were one of the worst performing FTSE stocks last year). Therefore
investors seeking exposure to the retail sector should invest in
companies such as M &amp; S, Boots or Storehouse who know what they are
doing and have already proved that they can deliver the goods in terms
of superior financial performance.
The CBI has long called for boardroom pay to reflect corporate
performance. It will be interesting to see whether this year's
renumeration of Kingfisher board members is reduced in line with the
company's poor performance.
Yesterday's boardroom developments and ensuing bid speculation
propelled Kingfisher shares up 19p to 408p.

* I am a sole trader with a small business. Due to a discrepancy in my
VAT returns, my tax inspector has refused to accept my accounts for the
year 1992/93. While he has all the paperwork relating to the business
for that year he has asked me to provide him with my personal current
account and Barclaycard statements for that year.
Since I have never kept them I have asked the bank and Barclaycard for
copies. The charge for this service is #120 which I can ill afford.
Since the tax inspector wants them, am I justified in asking him to pay
the cost?
* In cases of Inland Revenue investigation, the Inspector is entitled
to ask you to produce all business and personal financial records to
support the figures in the accounts submitted by you.
From what you have said it appears that the Revenue is seeking to
establish whether or not your personal lifestyle can be supported by
your declared income in the accounts, and that none of the business
income has been diverted through your personal bank accounts.
You are not entitled to recover from the Revenue the costs of
supplying the information requested. In fact, if you do not supply the
details the Inspector can take the case before the Inland Revenue
Commissioners to obtain an order for the information to be supplied. If
you do not provide this or cause the information to be delayed penalties
will be charged to you.
However, in the event you can demonstrate that the Inland Revenue's
suspicions are without foundation, you would be entitled to seek to
recover the costs incurred.
* I would be obliged if you could advise me on my ''personal pensions
maze''. At present I am making the following monthly contributions: #50
to Target Life Managed Fund (commenced 1986); #20 to Scottish Amicable
Managed Fund (commenced 1986); #30 to Equitable Life (from 1990), split
40% in the managed fund and the balance divided equally between
investment trusts, high income and special situations. I also have a
plan from when I worked offshore which has a transfer value of #5214.
My first questions is should I continue with the Target Life plan? I
understand it is now a closed fund. Where should I transfer the money
from the offshore plan? I no longer work offshore and hope to retire in
10 years when I shall be 60.
* The Target fund has a poor track record and it is probably wise to
consider transferring the value of the investment to another personal
pension policy despite the penalty of so doing.
For a combination of low cost and good performance there is little to
beat the new pension plans based on investment trusts. Foreign &amp;
Colonial was first in the field. It is the largest investment trust and
has a good long-term record. Dunedin has recently launched a plan which
allows investment in its range of investment trusts as well as switching
between them. One of these plans would also be a suitable home for the
lump sum.
* Over the last 20 years I have invested in the shares of 19 public
companies. My first was the flotation of Scottish Television. In some
cases I have invested more than once in a company. Now that I am
retired, I am considering selling some of my earliest investments, but I
find that I have failed to retain an accurate record of the prices paid.
With the capital gains tax situation in mind, will you please advise
me how I can establish the purchase price of these earlier deals without
involving a stockbroker at this stage.
* In the absence of accurate records, the simplest way of finding out
the original cost of your investments is to consult the broker acting
for you at the time of purchase. You should find that if the information
is available it will be provided to you at little or no cost.
In the case of flotation issues, the broker will certainly have
details of the date and price the shares were offered for sale, and
these records will also provide information on subsequent amendments to
the price. Scottish Television shares, for example, were originally
issued in October 1965 at #1.10 per share, but there was a repayment of
15p a share in July 1968 which would have to be taken into account in
your capital gains calculation. The records will also provide details of
the March 1982 value of the shares.
In other cases you may be able to establish an average price for the
month or year of purchase which may be acceptable to the Inland Revenue
in the circumstances. This is particularly so if the shares were
purchased before March 1982 and you can establish that the price paid
was less than the March 1982 value which can then be used in your
capital gains calculation.
Again your broker will be able to supply average share prices, or you
can obtain this information direct from the companies involved or from
records held in a specialist library such as the Mitchell in Glasgow.
You should remember that detailed calculations are not required if
your capital gains are within the annual exemption limit, currently
#5800, and the proceeds received are less than twice this amount, that
is #11,600. A statement to this effect is a sufficient return unless the
Inspector requires otherwise.
* I have a mortgage with the Halifax Building Society which should be
paid off by April 1996. I believe the offer of shares, if it comes, will
be made later that year. I do not have any other accounts with the
Halifax, and am unlikely to require to extend the mortgage or take an
additional loan. Am I likely, therefore, to lose out on the share offer?
* It is too early to say what form the merger with the Leeds and
conversion to a quoted PLC will take and how it would affect you. The
package is still being fomulated and is an exceedingly complex process.
The Halifax will be writing to all borrowers and savers with more
information when it becomes available, probably in the spring. It has
suggested that it might treat borrowers and investors differently,
relating the number of free shares to the length of relationship or the
money in an investor's account.
The society will have to satisfy the Building Societies Commission
that what is proposed is legal under the 1986 legislation covering
building societies. After that, the two societies' 10 million members
will have to vote on the merger. This is likely to be in the spring
provided there are no legal hold-ups.
* A year ago I inherited approximately #35,000 and at the age of 50 I
wished to invest it to help secure my future. My husband is a small
farmer and rarely pays tax and I occasionally teach part-time. We
invested #12,000 in a Perpetual PEP -- #6000 in a growth fund and #6000
in a high income fund. The remainder was placed in a Dunfermline
Building Society Tessa at 7.25% and a little for ready access in a gold
account at 4.4%.
Did I place too much in the PEP? Since the #12,000 was invested in
April 1994 its value has dropped by nearly #1000, including the initial
charges. In view of the poor stock market performance would you advise
me to alter this investment and place more in a Tessa-type investment?
* The stock market has fallen by about 5% since April, so there is no
obvious reason for suspecting that your Perpetual PEPs are
under-performers. Equity-type investments are for the long-term and they
need to be given time to fructify.
It is unfortunate that your investment has coincided with a period of
sustained weakness in stock markets. Fortunately you only allocated
about one-third of your capital to the PEPs. The balance you struck
represents a very cautious investment stance.
It would be wrong to reduce or dispose of your PEPs at this stage.
Many private investors make the mistake of buying equities at the top of
the market and selling out at the bottom.
In view of what you say about your husband's tax position and your own
part-time working status, it is not clear why you have been so attracted
to tax-free investments such as PEPs and Tessas.
In your circumstances we would have preferred to see your funds
building up in investment trust savings schemes. You might now like to
divert some of the income from your building society accounts into
monthly subscriptions to an investment trust scheme.
Buying shares monthly has the effect of ironing out the vagaries of
the stock market over time. Keep your PEPs until they have been given a
chance to generate some capital growth for you and your husband.
The low-level of the stock market indicates an opportunity to buy
equities rather than dispose of them.

MONEY market rates moved up in London yesterday in anticipation of an
increase in base rates after the meeting on Thursday between the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the
Bank of England, Eddie George.
Three-month rates are already fully discounting a half-point rise in
rates to 6.75%, and in the afternoon the Treasury Bill rate jumped from
5.8761% to 6.1368%.
Rates were last increased in December when the two men decided against
delaying a rise until January because financial markets were already
expecting the move.
The latest economic indicators have heightened expectations of an
early rise in rates. Inflation at the retail and factory gate levels has
been higher than expected, while gross domestic product, retail sales,
and unemployment figures have all pointed to robust levels of activity.
The CBI industrial trends survey confirmed the dangers of the economy
overheating, though the captains of industry argued that it was too
early to increase rates.
But the Chancellor would risk a bloodbath in financial markets if they
suspected that he had vetoed demands by the Governor for higher rates to
slow the pace of economic activity. Even waiting until publication of
the Bank's inflation report on the morning of Wednesday, February 8,
would be hazardous.
On the other side of the Atlantic the Federal Reserve Board is also
expected to raise rates next week because the US economy is growing too
strongly for comfort.
Further confirmation of this emerged yesterday when GDP figures for
the final quarter showed annualised growth of 4.5%, bang in line with
Wall Street expectations. The American economy grew at an annualised
3.3% in the first quarter, 4.1% in the second, and 4% in the third.
The economy grew at 4% throughout the whole of last year against 3.1%
in 1993. It was the strongest growth rate since 1984's 6.2%.
Inflation fears were partially reassured by the fixed-weight price
index rising at an annualised 2.6% in the final quarter against 3% in
the third.
''Growth is strong enough to get the Fed to tighten but inflation is
weak enough that the markets don't feel the Fed is tightening for any
immediate inflationary reason,'' said Bob Bannon, a bond market
strategist in New York.
Economists at James Capel in London said that that the fixed-weight
price index was not a good short-term inflation indicator and that
Government consumption had been weak in the final quarter, while all the
private sector components were very strong.
The Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. Wall
Street expects the Fed funds rate to be raised for the seventh time in a
year from 5.5% to 6%. The discount rate is forecast to rise in line from
4.75% to 5.25%.

THE Ivory &amp; Sime managers of the Continental Assets investment trust
have underlined their confidence in the future by gearing up the company
through a #10m foreign currency loan.
''This should be regarded as a long-term structural measure rather
than an opportunistic device to boost short-term performance,'' Ivory &amp;
Sime's Gordon Neilly said yesterday.
Prospects rather than past performance have been the order of the day
in most investment trusts over the past year as markets throughout the
world stagnated, or worse, leaving managements little to crow about.
Continental proved no different, reporting a 5% fall in net asset
value per share to 217.8p, almost twice the rate of the 2.9% decline in
the benchmark FT World Index for Europe.
Earnings per share for the 1994 calendar year fell from 3.26p to
2.67p, forcing the Edinburgh-based company to dip into its revenue
reserves to maintain the 3p final dividend from the previous year.
The #47m trust, which now has a gearing level of some 17%, took
#73,000 from its reserves compared to a #56,000 inflow the previous
year.
In geographical asset terms, Germany and France remained the big
players with around 20% each of the portfolio. Sweden jumped from
virtually nil to 10% while Italy doubled to about 8%. The gearing
provided most of the boost and Switzerland was the only loser with a #1m
drop to #5.4m.
''Although 1994 was a difficult year, the longer-term performance
remains satisfactory and we believe that the gearing will bring enhanced
benefits to the shareholders,'' Mr Neilly said.

<HEADLINE>EFT to issue new shares in #9m deal for Haydock</HEADLINE>

GLASGOW-based EFT yesterday announced a #9m raid south of the Border,
by far the most ambitious acquisition in the asset finance group's
history.
EFT, which forecast a surge of at least 60% in 1994 pre-tax profits to
#3.25m, will finance the purchase of Blackburn-based Haydock Finance by
the issue of #7.19m worth of new shares, paying another #1.48m in cash.
An additional consideration of up to #350,000 could be payable,
depending on the Lancashire consumer finance company's profits for the
15 months to end-December this year, taking the total purchase price to
as much as #9.02m.
The group, which grew out of Edinburgh Financial Trust but has changed
its name and ceased its corporate finance and fund management operations
in recent years, made two small acquisitions in 1993.
However, emphasising the importance of the latest deal, managing
director Ted Black said: ''This is a very substantial move for us. The
previous ones have been interesting. They have extended our interest
down south. This one is serious.''
The City appeared happy with the purchase and, unperturbed by the new
issue, shares ended up [1/2]p on 63[1/2]p.
EFT, which principally finances the purchase by small or medium-sized
companies of anything from cars and printing equipment to light
aircraft, generates more than #60m of new business annually.
With Haydock generating nearly #30m in its last financial year,
focusing on the purchase by consumers of second-hand cars, the enlarged
EFT Group will generate almost #100m of new business each year.
Strong growth of its deals book, maintenance of margins, contributions
from its 1993 acquisitions and a major improvement in the default
problem, which EFT escaped the worst of anyway, are behind the group's
confident profit estimate.
The group witnessed a substantial reduction in receiverships and the
number of companies under pressure in 1994. EFT, which reckons it has
between 3% and 4% of the Scottish asset finance market, is now seeing
more investment emerging.
Mr Black said: ''We have had a very consistent growth pattern. We are,
I think, unique in that we came through the recession with, on the asset
finance side, straight-line progression in turnover, while everybody
else was writing off enormous sums of money. We were just writing a
little off.''
The latest foray is EFT's third into England, with the company having
spent #500,000 on the businesses which now comprise Midlands-based
commercial vehicle contract hire company Alltruck and #392,000 on 80% of
Bournemouth-based consumer finance business LHE Finance.
Haydock managing director Jon Wilkinson, who founded the Lancashire
company in 1980, will join the board of EFT, receiving an annual salary
of #75,000. His company generated #1.55m in pre-tax profits in the year
to September 1994.

IT'S still the same, even 30-odd years after the first time. The
thrill of seeing a loved one after a three-month absence, that first
early-morning glance at the liquid feel as she coolly cossets you from
the ankles up. I speak, of course, of the first day of a new season of
salmon fishing on the River Tay.
Normally, the 15th is the opening day but being a Sunday this year
there was an extra day of delicious expectation. Sunday evening was
spent in a lather wondering what to fish. The forecast was for rain and
high winds in the morning with a colder, calmer afternoon. It had been
raining for a day or two anyway, so I guessed the river might be fairly
full and decided to opt for the ''no-fly, spinning and flotation-jacket
option''. Everything was looked out and put neatly into the car book in
the garage, ready for a quick start.
The rain battered the windows and the wind was howling round the house
but by 7.20am the motorway was beckoning. I only need the wipers at
super-fast now and again. Just when I'm passing another vehicle and when
I'm not. The weather forecast on the radio confirms that it is wet. ''We
advise you not to travel unless your journey is really necessary.''
Well, mine is. A huge hold-up near Cumbernauld added about 15 minutes
to the journey and when I crossed the swollen Forth near Stirling and
the even fatter Earn, near Auchterarder, I knew that the temptress, the
Tay, might be unfishable.
At the top of Cairnie Brae, though, the clouds eased, there was a
brightness in the sky to the north and by Luncarty, it was positively
balmy . . . or was it me that was barmy? I got to Benchil and met Dougie
the Gillie/Boatman, Ian the Retired Journalist, Eric the Polis, Lawson
the Builder, and a big river, running clear.
That's the nice thing about opening day. Meeting old friends. There
was a lot of that tacky male banter about almost everything, including
the whereabouts of the other two fishers. Ricky the Producer had gone to
pastures more glamorous and it was not usual for John the Lucky Man That
Had Just Returned From a Fishing Trip Round the World to be late.
Perhaps the antipodean sunshine had melted the marrow in his bones.
(This was always what my granny warned would happen to me if I sat too
near the fire.) But no, the wet-weather equivalent of a cloud of dust
saw John arrive, also mentioning a place called Cumbernauld.
We drew straws for who should be first in the boat and Lawson and I
got first whack. We dropped Eric and Ian on the far bank and aimed for
Aitkenhead Dub. The wind was whipping spume off the tops of the waves,
but it wasn't a cold wind and it was great to be out on this wonderful
water again as Dougie laid the boat on to the harl. It was 9.35am on
opening day, and we were fishing.
It was difficult to get the boat working at its best with the wind
pushing it where Dougie didn't want it to go, but Dougie's not Dougie
for nothing. By 9.55am my rod slammed over and we were into a fish. The
boat was beached as was the fish shortly after . . . an unspawned hen
fish, a baggott. I slipped it back into the water, slipped down Lawson's
celebratory dram, and we were back out on the water. There was a rota
for the boat and Ian and Eric were just on thir way to take over when
Lawson landed a large silver kelt, about 12 pounds. So, no morning
springers; those fresh fish coming into the river to spawn later in the
year, but a bend in the rod to be welcomed on the first day.
Ian had taken a kelt at the foot of the beat and Lawson then proceeded
to catch a rainbow trout of over four pounds and a small finnock on a
minnow about the same length as the fish.
Lunch was convivial. We managed to sully the characters of every
angler who had caught more than us the previous season, thereby
blackening the names of almost every angler in Scotland. As we came out
of the hut for the afternoon session, some so-called friends arrived to
see how we were doing and to laugh at our lack of success.
The afternoon was only saved by another kelt that took my blue and
silver spoon in the Ship Linn where you cast upstream into a huge
backwater. It was now cold and the river was rising fast and we called
it a day.
So, another season is open, and like many a fickle mistress the Tay
gave a glimpse of the delights she has in store for us for another year.
She will not give her pleasures or favours readily, but when you do win
them, they are the greater for that.

ELECTRICITY regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild has thrown a small
spanner into the smooth build-up towards the forthcoming electricity
sale, to the intense irritation of the army of bankers and others
working on it.
Comments he made have forced a delay in the publication of the
pathfinder prospectus for the sale of the Government's remaining holding
in Powergen and National Power.
The Treasury said the pathfinder prospectus had been put back a week
to enable Mr Littlechild's remarks to be reflected in it. It added that
the overall sale timetable had not been affected, with the full
prospectus due in mid-February.
The regulator has turned down requests from industry for changes in
the working of the electricity pool or wholesale market to reduce sharp
fluctuations in pool prices.
The pathfinder was all set to be completed yesterday, for publication
on Monday when the hold-up came and there was intense irritation in the
sell-off team. But the regulator's supporters pointed out he was only
doing his job.
Mr Littlechild's comments came after pool prices hit a record 63.3p a
unit last Monday. Domestic consumers are not affected by the pool which
provides the pricing mechanism for large scale industrial users.
ICI for example has protested bitterly about the ''discredited''
system which it believes places UK firms at a competitive disadvantage
against European companies with access to cheaper power. ICI claims it
fails to take account of cheaper supplies from new generating plant.
The two English generators have agreed to keep average pool prices at
about 2.4p a unit over 1994/95 and 1995/96 and so far in the current
financial year the average has been 2.55p. Mr Littlechild reminded the
generators that he was monitoring the situation closely

THE FRENCH franc traded at its lowest level against the German mark in
more than a year yesterday, following rumours of possible dubious
financing deals which may surface as the French presidential campiagn
hots up.
Elsewhere the dollar fell back in late European currency dealings
although the US authorities are expected to raise US interest rates by
half a point next week.
Sterling had a weaker tone, dropping over 0.25 of a cent against the
dollar to $1.5890 and almost 0.25 of a pfennig versus the mark

A SILVER-SPRAYED Tarzan who has become detached from Out of the Jungle
and is dancing among the hypnotic gyrations of Worshippers of the Cat
asks: ''You'ze havin' a good jump-up man?'' I nod. I am indeed having
the jump-up of my life.
I had not intended to dance but then I had not known what to expect.
When you find yourself held captive by 75 steel bands who play tune-boom
and ping-pong pans at three beats per second for 14 hours without a
break; when you find yourself in an endless chain of cross-armed spins,
being passed from one partner to the next in the frolic of 100,000
outrageous costumes; when your eyes travel up from street level to
balconies thronging with spectators, and everyone of them is dancing;
when you are absorbed by that wonderful sense of rhythm inherent among
West Indians and nurtured by them from birth; you have no choice. You
dance. And you dance with total abandon. And you love it.
I'm surrounded by hot-brick cats. There are thousands of them in
identical costumes and at their centre is the steel band which powers
them. Sixty pan players are being pushed along in frameworks on wheels
like Fred Flintstone cars. Their hands are a constant blur of motion,
sweat streaks their faces, and taut sinews bulge in their necks. Energy
pulses through the atmosphere and the transfer from music to dance is
instantaneous.
Suddenly I'm out of the streets and among Devils and Demons, crossing
Savannah Park. We're kicking up a cloud of dust which rises above our
heads. They turn and mount the judging stage and their movements become
more violent spasms in their efforts to minimise contact with the
platform and stay airborne for the longest time.
Their boiling frenzy moves over the stage, bringing with it the
nebulous dust which sinks to their knees, and it is an awesome
spectacle, sinister and satanic, as hundreds of skeletons, white bones
painted on grey bodies and wearing leering skull masks, convulse in that
creeping dust. I look for the judges but they are hard to distinguish
for most of them are dancing too.
The highlight of the year for the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and
Tobago is the annual carnival which occupies the two days leading up to
Ash Wednesday, usually in late February or early March. Carnival is
serious frivolity. The islands close for business and no-one in their
right mind does anything which isn't fun.
It is said that crime rates drop astonishingly in the weeks leading up
to carnival because no-one wants to risk being inside for the
celebrations. While many towns have small carnivals, the largest takes
place in the delightfully ramshackle capital, Port of Spain.
Carnival jargon is simple. If you wear a costume in the procession you
are ''playing mas'' (short for masquerade). If you are dancing along
accompanying it you are ''jumping up''. ''Spectating'' does not enter
their lexicon.
Events begin with the Panorama Finals where the elite among steel
bands compete for honours which will lead to tours across the globe,
followed by a day of children's processions. But the last day is the
greatest, a glorious free-for-all. Steel bands gather from every part of
the country with their retinue of followers -- sometimes up to
5000-strong -- dressed in matching costumes on a chosen theme.
Preparations last the whole year. When one carnival ends, work begins
on the next. The costumes are beautifully crafted and result from hours
of painstaking work. There is a spirituality about carnival, the
integrity with which is pursued and the bonding of very diverse
cultures. For Trinidad is remarkable for the ethnic mix found within its
shores; an old Dutch, French, and British sugar plantation recipe of
African slaves and 150,000 immigrants from India, China, and Madeira.
(Scarcely surprising then that 20% of Trinidadians are diabetics.)
For three days few people sleep. Long before dawn the streets are
busy. At 4am the snow-cone vendors are setting up shop, planing off
slivers from a block of ice and splashing on syrup in garish colours.
Roti sellers are swirling elastic pancakes, filling them with curry and
stockpiling them like a flock of deflated haggis. Bottles of rum bulge
from trousers. Women sell coconuts, opening them with three slashes of a
machete like clumsy attempts at the sign of the cross.
And I watch a dinosaur with the legs of a small girl run out from one
doorway closely followed by another in the embrace of her smaller
brother, and together they disappear into the adjacent doorway, where I
assume a disabled dinosaur is waiting.
Dancing in the sun is hot work. Each day two gallons of me evaporates.
By the third morning I'm totally jumped out. Here and there the odd
group of diehard merry-makers sing and stumble their way through the
wreckage of the streets piled deep with litter: empty bottles of Old Oak
Rum, coconut shells, fallen butterfly wings, discarded feathers of the
Army for World Peace and other fragments of costumes which had been one
year in the making, and have served their purpose.
Two relics of When Rains Came lie on the ground in tattered streamers
of cheerfully coloured polythene, one spread-eagled and his stomach
acting as a pillow for the other who still clutches the ravaged frame of
a windswept umbrella. The desolation does not seem as such because my
mind is full of bright images that caused it. A laughing, dancing
assimilation of humanity.
Then I left Port of Spain. I simply wanted to find a quiet place to
recover lost sleep. I drove to Maracas Bay over hills of dense green
foliage studded with the orange blossom of immortelle. Maracas Bay was
an idyll of curved coconut palms and an aquamarine ocean. On a deserted
stretch of sand I slept and slept.

STATUES in the open air are for pigeons, are they not? Or else, when
put in public places, they get likened to lumpy lampposts. Both clutter
the ground. Each in its own way obstructs the free passage of the
lieges.
Every day, though, lamp-standards come into their own. They shed
light. Stookies just stand there, and forever. Insofar as they are paid
attention to at all, seldom are they seen as beacons of culture. Their
creating is not commonly rated with doing poetry, making music, or
daubing.
''People often ask if I do art as well,'' Sandy Stoddart said. Here
and there he is repopulating the land with his sculptures.
Kilmarnock at its renewed town centre will be introduced again to
Robert Burns. Also this year, Edinburgh in the High Street is due at
last to pull out a chair for David Hume, the eighteenth-century
philosopher, to sit learnedly on. With good luck -- possibly next year
-- Stirling could receive James IV (l473-l513) who hammered a fractious
kingdom into one piece, won it a place in Europe, then fell at Flodden.
Glasgow may most feel Sandy Stoddart's hand. For the city's Trongate
where robed tobacco lords once hogged the plainstanes he has a vision of
two bestriding figures. Each will stand on a bronze base lofty as a
double-decker bus. ''Nothing can be too big for them,'' Sandy Stoddart
suggested.
On the one hand will be Robert Adam, the bumptious Fifer who for his
style was the greatest British architect of his time or, perhaps, of all
time. On the other hand will be introduced Giambattista Piranesi, whose
landing at Glasgow Cross is trickier to explain. Did he invent Macallum
ice creams, or what?
To Robert Adam, Glasgow's indebtedness appears light. Much of the
architecture which he left has been removed. Parts of the Trades House
are his. In Charlotte Street one Adam's townhouse was spared by
planners. A surviving arch of the city's former assembly rooms has been
flitted across Glasgow Green to offset the High Court.
Most of Adam's re-creation of the area now called the Merchant City
existed only on paper. His most restorative activity in the Trongate was
to sleep there. When in Glasgow, he took his bed and breakfast at the
old Tontine Hotel.
When in Rome, he visited Giambattista Piranesi (l720-1778).
For a youngish (aged 27) Scot on the make it was not easy for Adam to
intrude on Piranesi's presence. His Rome studio was customarily besieged
by admirers whom he'd rather not invite to see his etchings. Adam jumped
the queue by the quality of some drawings he sent in.
According to Sandy Stoddart, Piranesi embraced the Kirkcaldy man. ''We
are equals,'' he cried.
Twin commanding statues are envisaged for them -- l5ft classical
figures atop l5ft plinths on the roof of the underground rail tunnel and
facing along Argyle Street. Tourist snapshots will show the pair arising
out of the city's East End as from a new dawn.
From its dawn Glasgow's story has been a series of upheavals. It is a
place that has kept reinventing itself. With the closing of its
engineering chapter, the page is turning for a new adventure. And
because a future could be founded on the city's treasury of
architecture, Sandy Stoddart's vision -- at a cost of around #250,000 --
is being assessed benignly.
Stoddart's concept can be grasped in Scotland only by think-big
Glasgow, in the opinion of his assistant, John Macfarlane, an architect.
''What we mean to do is monumentualise Robert Adam and Piranesi,'' he
said.
It matters not that Piranesi seems to have put up only a part of one
building. His architectural imagination is his enduring bequest to the
world enshrined in his urban landscapes and in engravings of classical
Roman ruins and Greek temples. When he agreed to see Robert Adam,
swaggering young social climber that he was, they had one of the great
meetings of minds of modern times.
No man creates his own memorial. ''There is no such thing as a DIY
monument,'' John Macfarlane said. Next century to pay public tribute to
Piranesi the world will find him in Glasgow.
''We are about to do what has never been done,'' Sandy Stoddart, 35,
said. He paused as if to allow his grandiose claim to return to him.
When the echo came, he caught it. ''My life,'' he mused, ''has just been
a series of dawns.''
One early ''conversional moment'' (he called it) happened when he was
a wayward student at Glasgow School of Art. In a corridor inhabited by
godly plaster casts of classical sculptures his eyes opened as if for
the first time to a statue of Apollo. ''It had been around so long it
knew how to speak,'' he recalled. What it said to him was that somebody
should try matching the masters. Did he have the bottle?
He has since refined his thinking about the phenomena of ancient
Greece and old Rome. Civilisations, he conceded, are supposed to die.
They crumble. They go. ''But do they really?'' he asked. ''Think of
yourself,'' he suggested.
''We find we perpetually refer back to our own youth right through our
lives. ''I'm 30-whateveritis, and I'm increasingly thinking about when I
was l5.
''This is what the Western world does. It thinks fondly back to its
youth. So what you have got is a constant presence of classicism right
through all the most modern, up-to-date salient developments. It is as
if the world had been experienced before. Greece is the youth of all of
us.
''It is not a geographical or even a chronological thing. It is a
cultural thing. And it is on the move. It is like the gipsy of the West.
It travels about, ending up in Edinburgh, or Berlin, or Munich, or
Paris.
''Edinburgh is called the Athens of the North not because it looks
Athenian or because it has got a couple of rocks, but because in the
mid-eighteenth century it had as many great minds and men of genius in
it as Athens at it high peak had.''
His lowest depression at art school came with creating bits of this or
that out of railway sleepers or welding metal scraps. ''In here when we
need some welding done,'' he said, ''we get in a welder.''
''In here'' is an anonymous shed at a Paisley engineering works where
Robert Burns and David Hume, along with a miniature Adam and Piranesi,
have taken shape. Behind a sliding green door the artist's chaotic
workshop might be a cement cemetery where nothing gets thrown away.
The shack feels air-conditioned for ice sculpture. Against the chill
Sandy Stoddart works in five layers of clothes. For a heat he and John
Macfarlane go outside to kick about a football in the cobbled factory
yard.
Yet the premises are palatial compared with a previous base in a
ropeworks at another end of Paisley. One wall was made urinal by the
leaking roof.
But he would be loath to leave Paisley. He thinks an artist should
stick to where he belongs. Besides, Paisley meets Aristotle's definition
of a polis, a place where everybody knows everybody else to look at
although not to talk to.
Somehow the cold bare walls of their birthplace make his statues look
already acclimatised to Scottish streets.
His Kilmarnock edition of Burns gives equal standing to John Wilson,
his local first publisher. The bookseller appears more abundantly
coiffed than in most likenesses. ''It is a privilege of the sculptor to
complete what nature left undone,'' Sandy Stoddart agreed.
In that regard David Hume brings worse problems. He was fat and ugly.
''His physiognomy was unpleasant,'' was the sculptor's gentle
correction. ''You would not want to look like Hume,'' he admitted.
Some Edinburgh voices have already agonised that Hume's statue will
not look like Hume because the sculptor has stripped him of the clothes
he wore.
Sandy Stoddart prefers not to use the buckles and buttons of fickle
fashion. ''Our clothing is ridiculous. I mean, look at it,'' he said,
not meaning his own five layers. ''No matter how well-dressed we are, we
all look ridiculous. We look craven, whereas a statute has got to stand
there for centuries. It can't have a costume going rapidly out of
fashion.''
By contrast, antique drapery changed little. Ancient Rome altered its
togas only four times and then only a little. And they have the
practical value to a sculpture of giving it authority and weight.
''Statues in trousers look very airy around their lower parts. They look
spindly,'' he said. It reduces their effect.
Whether in Kilmarnock, at Glasgow Cross, or even along Edinburgh High
Street, when ordinary mortals walk under a statue they should receive a
true idea of their own size and even a sense of shame about how puny it
is.
Sandy Stoddart said: ''I think it is very exciting and good to know
that there are people who will never do anything mighty in their lives
walking about underneath the images of the heroic dead. It is almost
like a threat. It is like a chastening influence.
''Greatness stands there and looks down and says: And what have you
done?''

AGE cannot wither the truest old rock'n'rollers, the ones who have
plenty of art left in their wizened knapsacks. Consider the following
three recent news stories and then tell me that God doesn't actively
bestow his benison of good health on seasoned musicians who are in it
for love rather than money.
Them ol' whinin' Eagles had to cut short last year's reunion tour of
the States -- for which tickets were costing seventies-fixated suckers
upwards of #76 a throw -- when guitar-player Glenn Frey needed
gastro-intestinal surgery. Dreary forty-something rock balladeer John
Mellencamp had to cancel shows because of a clogged artery and the
after-effects of a heart attack.
And the creatively-bankrupt trio of Crosby, Stills, and Nash were
forced to abandon plans for a mega-bucks US tour when David Crosby
required a liver transplant. Naturally, you'll already be aware that
there was never any prospect of CSN returning to their deepest roots by
re-forming as CSNY. Unlike his former partners, the ever-evolving Neil
Young hasn't simply stood still since 1969.
And neither have John Mayall and Peter Perrett, both of whom are more
than alive and bound to thrive in '95, and that's no jive.
Now aged 61, Mayall formed his first band, the Powerhouse Four, 40
years ago. That was before he went to Korea to experience something
which has thankfully been denied to most post-war rockers: military
conscription, or National Service as it was known.
Mayall has long been portrayed as the great pedagogue of British
blues. Indeed, during a hectic three-year spell in the mid-sixties, John
Mayall's Bluesbreakers acted as home to many musicians who went on to
become titled gents in the Brit-rock aristocracy. Eric Clapton, Mick
Fleetwood, John McVie, Peter Green, Aynsley Dunbar, Mick Taylor, Jack
Bruce, Andy Fraser . . .
One listen to John Mayall's forthcoming album on the Silvertone label,
Spinning Coin, his forty-fourth since 1965, shows the ongoing strength
of Mayall's voice, keyboards, and musical vision. Judged on its most
basic level, Spinning Coin is 11 knock-out rockaboogie tunes delivered
with jaunty fruitfulness. On a deeper level, it testifies to one man's
undying love of the blues.
''I haven't come to within a million miles of finding an end to the
inspiration I take from the tradition of the blues. It can never get
stale. One of the songs on the new album is by one of my original
heroes, J B Lenoir, and he still has a certain magic that's valid today.
I was very glad to have met J B Lenoir before he died in 1967.''
Did he proffer words of wisdom?
''No. Musicians don't do that. They play and turn other musicians on
by their playing. No handing out of advice -- although Sonny Boy
Williamson did tell me that I'd never make it because he was the best!''
Despite Peter Perrett's 13-year absence from live performance, there's
a current generation of bands -- Therapy? and Manic Street Preachers to
name but two -- who insist that he is one of Britain's best songwriters.
Peter Perrett was the prime force in the Only Ones until that band's
demise in March, 1981. A rolling programme of re-issues of the band's
three albums, as well as numerous anthologies and live semi-bootleg
releases, kept Peter's songs of ironic disaffection in circulation until
their creator returned to public life with a new band, The One, in
January last year.
Gazing admiringly at his wiry frame and timeless tousled mane, I would
never have guessed that Peter has children aged 15 and 11, and in fact
celebrated his silver wedding anniversary this month. But his palpable
air of strung-out restlessness provided a clue to his prolonged absence.
''Too many drugs,'' says Peter simply.
''Drugs became more important than music . . . Sometimes I think: 'All
those wasted years and all those great songs that I never wrote'. But
you have to be positive. If I'd been doing music for 20 years, I
wouldn't be as enthusiastic about it as I am now.''
But how disabling was your drug addiction?
Peter grins a death's-head grin. ''Disabled . . . that's the word. You
lose all your interests, in music and sex. Being in bed seemed a waste
of time. Any time spent not taking drugs was a waste of time. But it's a
boring subject, and it made me boring.
''My catalyst was a spell in hospital in 1985 when I was clean for a
month, and it put a seed in my head. I only managed to stay clean for
another month, but in that time I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed music, I
had sex. Gradually, I gave up drugs.''
But it wasn't easy.
''At first my wife, who's also my manager, was very anti-drugs. But my
music was her life, and so she'd put up with it. And with all the
different girlfriends I had virtually every day, and then with my
live-in girlfriends. But when the band broke up, ending her raison
d'etre, my wife started drugs, too.
''Today I know I want to live until I'm 70, and be able to do music
until the end of my life. In addition, while my wife has always been my
best friend, I've also gained enough maturity to realise that being best
friends is what love is about, rather than the excitement of a constant
infatuation with new people.''
His four fellow band-members are the only new people with whom Peter
Perrett is presently infatuated, for their musical energy and ability.
This is high praise considering that in the past Peter has played with
such notables -- all deceased -- as Johnny Thunders, Stevie Marriott and
Phil Lynott. And er, Sid Vicious.
''Only for one gig, in the Living Dead with Johnny, because Johnny was
Sid's idol. Sid was at the height of his fame yet couldn't play a note.
He was like a 12-year-old, really. Johnny insisted we unplug his bass
after the first two songs. Sid never noticed until it was too late.''
Over the next few months, Peter Perrett will be seeking to convince
the British music business that he hasn't left it too late. ''They all
want to see that I'm going to be around for a while, after having been
away for so long.''
There's been one excellent four-track EP so far, with another due next
month. The critics' verdict on Peter's comeback record has been
favourable. ''Still innovating; still writing lyrics that reviewers like
to quote.''
Meanwhile, Peter's quote about Johnny Thunders -- ''more charisma than
talent, but such charisma'' -- could apply to him, too. Only Peter
Perrett has both talent and charisma in large and equal measure.
John Mayall's Spinning Coin is released on February 13; The One's
Cultured Palate EP is still available on the Dwarf label.
* Late newsflash: Mick Jagger, Tina Turner, Bryan Ferry, and Diana
Ross all need emergency hip replacement operations -- heck, but you all
knew how unhip they'd made themselves anyway.

Between The Lines (Silva Screen)
* 'ARRY? 'Ave you 'eard wot they've done to our tune? Deakin's got an
'and in this, I'll wager.
Wot, guv? Wot's 'e on abaht, Mo?
Here we are then. A compilation of 22 title tracks from UK primetime
TV series, taking its name from the best cop drama ever (I refer to the
first series only, of course, and barring Hill Street Blues). Grouped by
category on the disc, the set includes The Bill (Police), LA Law
(Courtroom), Casualty and St Elsewhere (Medical) and just about
everything from The Man from UNCLE to Baywatch (which latter series has
recently devoured all the Tumelty children). More classily, it includes
themes from The Chronicles of Narnia, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and
Brideshead Revisited, all featuring the elegant music of Geoffrey
Burgon. Note, with one exception, they are not original soundtracks, but
re-records.
Martin Chuzzlewit, music from the BBC drama (Destiny Music)
* MORE from the pen of the ubiquitous and prolific Geoffrey Burgon,
this time in pastoral mode, who has the disc to himself in 18 tracks of
titles and incidental music to the BBC series. The trouble with this
charming disc is that if you separate incidental music from its
televisual context, it loses part of its character. In that sense much
of Burgon's music for Martin Chuzzlewit seems a bit innocuous. Still,
for those with vivid recollections of the BBC's recent dramatisation,
this collection will doubtless evoke memories.
Classic Creepies, Various artists, (Teldec)
* C'MON now. Hammer House of Horrors this ain't, but an oddball
collection of classical music extracts. Slotting a bunch of classics
with sometimes not the remotest trace of ghoulishness into a supposedly
''horror'' format is something of a Procrustean job -- a wee touch of
the Frankenstein, if you catch my bag of bits. Still, good extracts
(from Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, Stravinsky's Firebird, Holst's
Planets, Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, and many others. And
some good bands, including the Cleveland Orchestra (stunning) the
Philharmonia, New York Phil, Vienna Symphony, Brodsky Quartet et al.
Dope On Plastic, various (React)
* ''DON'T call it trip hop'' is the injunction on the back cover of
this purple-vinyl double-album. So what to call it? Looped hip bop?
Sampled thrive jive? Blurred ambient funk dub? Or digital jazz vibed up
with an analogue intent? Best call it what it is: a totally tip top
blend of funky jazziness from a largely unknown bunch of names. Thumbs
mightily aloft to The Grassy Knoll, The Woodshed, 9Lazy9, and Men With
Sticks. Don't be a dope: this compilation of philosophic pulsings will
set your intellect throbbing as surely as your feet.
The Best Punk Album In The World . . . Ever, various (Virgin)
* OH NO, it's not, because it's got Uncle Tom Robinson's 2-4-6-8
Motorway on it -- and Tom Robinson wasn't punk. And neither were Killing
Joke, Talking Heads, Joe Jackson, Dr Feelgood, the Motors or the Tubes.
And there's no Slaughter and the Dogs. Or the Sploited. So oi-oi-oi, Mr
Corporate Toothy Grin Branson, us Old Kids Who Used To Be On The Street
In Safety Pins But Now We Live In A Nice Cul De Sac, you can't fool us
(although it is rather nice to hear the Rezillos' Top Of The Pops again,
and XTC and the Pistols). So be aware that while punk's not entirely
dead yet, this album offers itself as its tombstone.
Funky Little Demons, the Wolfgang Press (4AD)
* GRAVELLY whispers and sinuous soul rhythms are united on Bolanesque
songs of laconic discontent crafted by the veteran art-rock noiseniks.
Unexpectedly irresistible.
Blue Break Beats Volume 2, various (Blue Note)
* ACID Jazz beat-pilot Dean Rudland offers informed clubbers more
pithy and propulsive funk fusions from the early seventies. Get hip to
the trip with Donald Byrd, Grant Green, Lou Donaldson, Jimmy McGriff and
Bobby Hutcherson. Best of all, follow Eddie Henderson's advice and
become a Kumquat Kid.
Jewel in the Crown, Fairport Convention (Woodworm)
* FAIRPORT'S 26th album in 28 years features a formula that has hardly
changed since 1969's Liege &amp; Lief: damnably catchy jigs; imaginatively
updated traditional songs; and contributions from singer/songwriters
(Clive Gregson, Jez Lowe and, more unexpectedly, Leonard Cohen on this
occasion) -- all matily sung and meatily played. Long-term fans wouldn't
have them any other way and although it's a solidly dependable rather
than a wildly inspired affair, it's no less enjoyable for that.
Freedom is a Constant Struggle, Various Artists (Folk Era)
* A TRIBUTE to 1964's Mississippi Freedom Summer campaign for social
reforms for black people in America's South, this double CD brings
together contemporary performances by many of the most vocal protesters
of the time, including Phil Ochs, Eric Andersen, Bob Dylan, Judy Collins
and Tom Paxton. Add some specially recorded material by, among others,
Nanci Griffith mentor Carolyn Hester, and sterling contributions from a
Capella Quintet Sweet Honey in the Rock and you have both a historical
document and a collection whose message still resonates 30 years on.
Symbiosis, Bill Evans (Verve)
* RECORDED in 1974 when Evans was playing some of the best jazz piano
to be heard, Symbiosis features his trio with the athletic Eddie Gomez
(bass) and the subtle Marty Morrell (drums) in an orchestral setting by
German composer Claus Ogerman. The dry, economic arrangements foreshadow
Ogerman's acclaimed Cityscape composition for saxophonist Michael
Brecker and although even Evans can't help sounding dated on the brief
Fender Rhodes piano movement, his beautifully manicured acoustic work
bears comparison with anything you will hear today.
Scampi Fritti, Marc Beacco (Verve)
* TAKING his cue from Bobby McFerrin, Take Six, and Manhattan Transfer
at their more adventurous, Paris-based Beacco cleverly multi-layers his
own voice into doo-wapping, scatting choirs. Songs such as The Pasta
Dance are humorously eccentric and it might all become a bit samey but
for the wide variety of individually featured soloists, including both
Brecker brothers, guitarist Steve Lukather and -- the two which work the
best -- bandoneoniste Juan-Jose Mosalini and super drummer Dennis
Chambers.
The Gershwin Songbook: Jazz Variations, Dick Hyman (Music Masters
Jazz)
* THE Gershwin Songbook emerged in 1932, containing not only the great
man's hits as previously published, but also his own variations on them.
On this new CD, Hyman -- a master of jazz piano styles -- plays two
versions of each of the 18 tunes. First versions are as originally
written; second versions are improvisations based on the composer's
notes. Thus a boogie-woogie Sweet and Lowdown and a stride Fascinatin'
Rhythm, but the highlight of an intriguing collection is Do, Do, Do with
its evocation of Bix Beiderbecke's sublime In a Mist.
Swingin' Down in New Orleans, Doc Cheatham (Jazzology JCD 233)
* THE eternally-youthful 89-year-old trumpeter is in great, energetic
form throughout this 17-course feast, with a competitive edge to his
duetting with clarinettist Brian O'Connell. His singing is as charming
as ever, notably on the quaintly chauvinistic I Want a Little Girl
(something of a theme tune for him), and the sentimental Love Will Find
a Way on which he is tastefully accompanied by one of his pianistic
partners from last year's jazz festival, Butch Thompson.

PERSONAL log: red letter day -- January 28, 1995. I am stationed
across the street from the City Art Centre in Edinburgh. Within those
walls lies the history of the Star Ship Enterprise and her voyages
across our screens to international fame.
My mission is to seek out the facts and faces behind Star Trek: the
Exhibition.
With no Spock on hand to tap into the ship's computer, I turn instead
to Bob McLean of Edinburgh District Council's marketing unit. It's like
a trial run for Mastermind with Star Trek: The Phenomenon as his
specialist subject. And he wasn't even a Trekkie -- as fully paid-up
fans are generally known -- before getting involved with the project.
With Bob as my communications officer, I find myself going back, back
in time. Back to the 1960s and a low-budget American television series
dreamed up by a one-time airline pilot turned scriptwriter, Gene
Roddenberry.
At the start of the decade, President John F Kennedy had raised the
eyes -- and aspirations -- of the American people towards space. Here
was the new frontier, the focus for those pioneering energies that had
previously won the West. Yee-haw! And instead of those pesky Redskins,
there were pesky Ruskies in them thar moonshadows . . .
Around the same time the writer Arthur C. Clarke produced a
non-fiction vision of the future which dealt in notions of space drive,
warped space, instantaneous transportation. Roddenberry, on the lookout
for a new story-line, saw a window of opportunity. He locked on to the
concept of a Wagon Train to the Stars -- basically Western-style
adventures in a cosmic settting -- and Star Trek came into being.
September 1966 -- and 400 years in the future -- Captain James T Kirk
and the crew of the USS Enterprise boldly went where no man had gone
before. Deep into shooting, and not only were there Klingons on the
starboard bow -- there were terrestrial troubles ahead too.
Tri-corder readings -- all right, audience ratings -- for the original
series failed to convince NBC (which was scheduling it) that there was a
sizeable viewing public out there. A vast and vehement letter campaign
from disappointed fans brought reprieve of a kind. But the
powers-that-programmed didn't share this mailbag enthusiasm and Star
Trek was shelved after its third series. Less than six weeks after the
final episode was transmitted, television audiences watched in
wonderment as a grainy, gawky figure planted an American flag on a patch
of dusty ground: the first man had landed on the moon. Nice timing, NBC.
But, back to earth, and the present day. Manned moonshots have
themselves been shelved, while Star Trek has risen from canned doom to
become a worldwide success on television, cinema screen and
merchandising stall. And soon in Edinburgh, there will be the first-ever
Star Trek Exhibition to be mounted outside America.
Bob doesn't demean himself by crowing about this coup. The City Art
Centre has housed major -- and highly popular -- exhibitions before. But
this one promises to be particularly special. Visitors will be able to
see, close-to, some of ''the stuff that dreams are made of'' -- as
Captain Picard of the Next Generation series might say in one of his
Shakespearean moments.
There, in the lived-in fabric, is the minutely-skirted red uniform
once worh by Uhuru. And here is Kirk's own costume, first donned by
William Shatner in the sixties, as week after week, the crew of the
Enterprise confronted problems strangely reminiscent of situations here
on earth -- political chicanery, war, greed and corruption, but not
racial discrimination . . . Apparently the first inter-racial kiss ever
screened on American television was a close encounter between Kirk and
Uhuru in 1967!
My own sentimantal journey through the memorabilia -- it fills almost
the entire City Art Centre -- is guided by Sandy Topp, the centre's
design officer, and Gillis Johnson, project manager for Paramount, the
company that bought up the initial series and subsequently developed it
both on television and on film.
We stand in front of the bridge -- Paramount has actually re-created
the set as was in the original Enterprise -- and even as the voice of
commonsense says ''hardboard, grey paint, flashing lights'', the
affectionate memory sees and hears ghosts of crises past. Spock's
quizzical eyebrow -- ''The readings do not compute, Captain.'' Scotty's
worried jowls -- ''It's the dylithium crrr-ystals. I don't think I can
hold herrr!''
For those of us who still have our Spock posters (and the pointy
Vulcan ears from off the back of a cereal packet) there's every
incentive to linger here, in the twenty-fourth century. Just looking at
the large scale model of the A-series Enterprise makes the imagination
go WHOOOSH! And the heart yearn to purchase one of the 6ft replicas on
sale in another part of the galaxy -- gallery.
But the spirit of Kirk demands that, really, we should venture into
the future -- and here that includes glimpses of series yet unseen on UK
terrestial television channels. So -- on, through the sector dealing
with the hugely successful feature films, and on towards the Next
Generation . . . where the set of the Transporter Room stops one in
mid-track. A sudden image of Riker or Picard, turning into a shimmer of
molecular soup -- and of wee wifies jokily using the catchphrase ''Beam
Me Up, Scottie!'' in queues where bags weigh heavy and home feels light
years away.
Elsewhere, among the costumes and hardware, alien heads -- Ferengi,
Borg, Cardassian -- act as markers, not just of Federation expansion,
but of the increasingly sophisticated techniques and materials now used
in the making of the latest Star Trek series. And yes, the shape of
things to come is also on display: Deep Space Nine -- a twenty-fourth
century space station where life is not unlike that of a Wild West
frontier town -- and Voyager
Star Trek: the Exhibition is surely seventh heaven for all fans. But
it's more than a jamboree of illustrated story boards, choice video
clips, model space ships, covetable hand-props (phasers and
communicators) and souvenirs. It's a carefully selected, caringly
presented document of something Time magazine has identified as ''the
most enduring pop phenomenon of our time''.
Personal log supplemental: I am standing once again in Market Street.
I seem to have lost all track of time. Have I been transported? You
betcha -- and I'm still beaming, Scottie.
* Star Trek: The Exhibition opens next Saturday and runs through to
May 7. Events planned include link-ups with Edinburgh's Science Festival
in the spring.

SEMANTICS reappeared in the science-fiction television series that
blessed its audience with the world's most famous split infinitive. In
Voyager, the fourth regeneration of Star Trek to ''boldly go where no
man has gone before'' a crewman asked actress Kate Mulgrew if she should
be addressed as ''sir'' or ''ma'am''. Her reply was cool. ''Captain will
do nicely.''
As Captain Kirk of the original sixties series and Captain Picard of
The Next Generation are beamed on to the big screen next month in the
latest motion picture Generations, there is at last room, on television
at least, for the twenty-fourth century to embrace sexual equality. The
launch of Captain Kathryn Janeway, played by Miss Mulgrew, into the
stars is going boldly against the male grain.
In America, where the pilot episode entitled The Caretaker was
broadcast last week, the response has been mixed. For every flag-waving
feminist applauding equal opportunities in space, there seems to be a
male mourning the crossing of the final frontier. ''Why, oh why, put a
woman in charge?'' mourned one Trekkie on the Internet. ''Do you want
the ship to sink? They need a Kirk type . . . strong, ambitious and full
of testosterone.''
Such a description, however, aptly describes Voyager's executive
producer Jeri Taylor, the woman who made the decision to break with
tradition and cast females in the roles of captain and chief engineer,
the job Scotty handled so long ago.
''This was a decision we made because we felt we needed a fresh
approach to the captaincy. If we choose a male how could he be different
from the men who have already served so valiantly? It just seemed that
the time was right to take this step to make it a woman. No-one will
question her authority . . . Janeway will get involved in her crew's
lives. She'll get down and dirty,'' said Ms Taylor.
Ironically it was the completion of an idea Gene Roddenberry was
forced to discard. The role of First Officer in the original series was
given to Leonard Nimoy as Mr Spock after the television studios vetoed a
female as too controversial. Instead Uhuru handled the woman's role of
communications and part-time belly dancing.
Early reports on Captain Kathryn Janeway describe her dancing only on
the toes of those who cross her. Coming over as a cross between Hillary
Clinton and Katharine Hepburn, she riles her crew with a controversial
choice of seconds but brings them round to follow her lead.
Joining her on the intergalactic pedestal for womankind is chief
engineer B'Elanna Torres, an alien Maquis who is chosen over a starfleet
officer. Like the lead in a contemporary morality play, B'Elanna has
doubts which lead to temper tantrums.
''B'Elanna is at war with herself. She represents that person that so
many of us can identify with, who has what she considers to be a
failing, a character trait that she wishes she didn't have. B'Elanna
wishes she didn't have any Klingon in her, only Latin blood. What she'll
learn over the series is that you can't elimate what you are. You must
come to terms and peace with it.''
Voyager's journey through the new age space-ways is completed with the
first black Vulcan and a Native American outlaw whose spiritual guide is
a timber wolf. The whole series will swing on the theme of bigotry and
prejudice as the humans must work with the alien Maquis to find a way
home.
John Bonella of the Scottish branch of Klingons Unite said: ''I think
they have picked a female captain because she is going to have to deal
with all this racial bigotry between the Maquis. It's been said that
women aren't as prone to racism as men. She's going to have to control
her crew and I think it's a good choice.''
Actress Kate Mulgrew wasn't first choice. Genevieve Bujold, who was
Oscar-nominated for Anne Of A Thousand Faces, said she was interested in
the part but refused to audition. However, a day-and-a-half into filming
she quit, saying she couldn't cope with the brisk pace of weekly
television.
Despite intense interest from Patsy Kensit, Kate Mulgrew, who played
the wife of Peter Falk's rumpled detective in the TV series Mrs Columbo
and Heartbeat, captured the role. Interviewed at the time she said: ''We
do not want a butch, screaming tough broad. We want an excellent human
being running this ship, one who's sexy, alive, and who is completely in
control of what she's doing on that ship.''
Female fans of previous incarnations of Gene Roddenderry's vision,
Star Trek, The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine now make up more than
half the members of global tribute clubs like Klingons Unite. Scots fans
will be able to see the pilot episode soon when the Away Team hold their
regular meeting in Glasgow's Hospitality Inn.
At one point the series producers, Paramount Television, insisted that
Jeri Taylor audition male captains should the orignal idea falter, but
it was her push that drove it through. She has already admitted that she
moulded the captain with her own experiences.
''I am a woman of authority, unique in the Star Trek annals. There has
never been a woman who has had the title of executive producer besides
myself . . . The successful running of a TV series is, at least in part,
up to me. There are many pressures and a lot of stress. So I bring my
personality to bear on this job. Naturally, it is those sensibilities I
tap into when I write Janeway.''
Despite its cosmetic sociological changes it's the dialogue which
shows Voyager remains cracking cartoon-strip fun. In space, whatever
your sex, someone will always say: ''You're not thinking of going back
in there?'' They were and they will.

ROMANTIC comedies are scarce enough these days for one not to want to
look a gift horse in the mouth too closely, but Only You (PG), directed
by Norman Jewison, has a pretty dicey set of wallies. Jewison, a very
versatile director, was responsible for Moonstruck, which won three
Oscars in 1987 and was one of the better romantic comedies of recent
years. Cher got best actress, best supporting actress went to Olympia
Dukakis, and the writer, John Patrick Shanley, got the best screenplay
award. But Jewison, whose best remembered film is probably In The Heat
of the Night, made in 1967, which won five Academy Awards, including
best picture, comes a cropper with this sloppy love story.
Only You is one of those pictures they don't make any more which
demonstrates why they don't. The principal reason for this sorry state
of affairs is there are few stars around who can play light romantic
comedy -- and those who can tend to be too old to do so.
The story opens in Pittsburgh with an off-screen conversation which
sounds as if a couple are engaged in a bizarre sexual practice. This is
a very old joke, which I am not spoiling in revealing because it is so
old.
In fact 11-year-old Faith Corvatch and her brother Larry are playing
not with one another, but with an Ouija board. She believes in Fate,
True Love, and all the things little girls believe in, so when the board
spells out the name of the man who is fated to be her true love -- Damon
Bradley -- she is convinced that it is telling the truth.
The possiblity that her brother is manipulating the thing never
crosses her mind. Her belief is reinforced when she visits a
fortune-teller at the local fair and the lady looks into her crystal
ball and comes up with the name -- Damon Bradley.
The years pass and Faith (Marisa Tomei), now in her early twenties and
a very bad schoolteacher judging by the classroom scene where we are
introduced to the fact that she still believes in Fate and the One-ness
of twin souls, is engaged to a chiropodist called Dwayne (John Benjamin
Hickey), who is one of the world's great big jessies.
The fiance always is a nerd in films like this, a state of affairs
which contradicts the fact that the heroine is witty, charming, and
intelligent. If she were any of these things she would run a mile from
the Dwaynes of this world. Stuffed shirt is one thing, nerd another.
Faith is still wondering about Damon. On the eve of her wedding, while
she is modelling a truly ghastly wedding dress Dwayne's mother wore at
her own wedding and wants her future daughter-in-law to wear, one of his
friends telephones to wish him good luck. Dwayne is doing someone's
toes, so Faith takes the call.
Guess who the caller is -- Damon Bradley. He cannot stop, because he
is on his way to Venice, so Faith, still in mother-in-law to be's
wedding gown, leaps into a cab to find him.
She is followed by her plain Jane sister-in-law Kate (Bonnie Hunt) --
another stereotype role, although Miss Hunt is actually very good in it
-- who believes her husband Larry (Fisher Stevens), the boy with the
Ouija board, is cheating on her.
And so we leave dreary old Pittsburgh behind and fly off to Italia,
land of romance and lounge-lizard Latin Lovers who seduce American
ladies with a roguish twinkle, a kiss on the hand, and a glass of vino.
The photography is lovely, the cliches of Italian holiday-brochure
scenery gliding before our eyes are immensely pleasurable, and the
sound-track erupts with all those one cornetto songs that spell Italy.
If you are wondering where to go on holiday this year it should give
you a few ideas. But don't believe all that you see, because this is one
of those films where people arrive at B by travelling via A, X, M, and H
instead of taking a straight line from A to B.
Not since Katherine Hepburn sailed up and down the Grand Canal
backwards, forwards, and sideways in David Lean's Summer Madness has a
boat trip from Venice Airport to the Hotel Danieli taken such a peculiar
route. Not since Rossano Brazzi has there been an Italian seducer as
smooth as Joaquim De Almeida makes Giovanni, the Roman shop-owner the
girls collect as they pursue the elusive Damon who is always one tourist
town ahead of them.
Naturally Giovanni does not succeed in seducing Kate. This is a film
about true love so she has to remain true to Larry, her gruesome
blue-collar husband, a roofing contractor. In real life Kate would have
done a Mrs Wentworth Brewster, cried finiculi, finicula, and got on with
enjoying herself.
In Rome the girls at last meet Damon (Robert Downey Jr), and he falls
in love at first sight with Faith. After they have toured several pretty
bits of Rome and unwisely parodied the famous Bocca della Verita scene
from Roman Holiday -- somebody, somewhere, against all the evidence
thinks Ms Tomei is a latter-day Audrey Hepburn, probably because she is
equally thin -- they are about to consummate their passion when he
reveals that his name is not Damon Bradley, but Peter Wright. He lied
for love. Naturally Faith is furious and off they all go to Positano to
meet the real Damon.
You can pretty well take it from there. Jewison has one nice surprise
to spring in Positano, which Billy Zane springs to considerable effect,
but one surprise is not enough to save the film.
As an advertisement for holidaying in the more familiar parts of
Italy, like San Gimignano or the Piazza Navona, it is both very pretty
to look at and quite persuasive, but neither Tomei -- irritatingly fey
-- nor Downey -- who has the longest lashes known to man and bats them
endearingly -- are up to the demands placed on them by this kind of
frothy comedy.
She comes across as brainless, when she should be endearingly dizzy,
while I suspect his problem is that he is not one of nature's leading
men. Young ladies under the age of 25 still looking for Mr Right
apparently adore the film -- but souffles must rise if they are to be
successful, and this one has fallen very flat indeed.
It is the only new film this week, so a reminder of a couple of films
well worth catching that are still around -- Ang Lee's tale of family
life and food, Eat Drink Man Woman (PG) and Hal Hartley's quirky
thriller about pornography, violence, and identity, Amateur (15).
Lee's film is a heart-warming story set in Taipei about a family,
widowed father and three daughters, disintegrating and then, as the
girls gain their freedom, coming together again as a new family with
husbands and second wives and grandchildren is formed. It is very funny
in the most gentle way and the plot leads to a totally unexpected
conclusion.
The Hartley is his most accesible film to date. In the past his
offbeat approach to present-day American life has tended to the
inconsequential, but this is a well-told story about an amnesiac
pornographer, pursued by his past, and an ex-nun, who fall in love. He
uses the elements of the film noir thriller genre to fresh effect.

THE FINAL CUT
By Michael Dobbs
HarperCollins, #14.99 (pp 378)
IN the previous two books of this trilogy, Michael Dobbs has exhibited
an uncanny ability to foretell that which then transpires -- at least to
some extent -- in political reality. It is a brilliant skill for a
novelist and, thanks to the television serialisation that has made his
name and fame, also a very rewarding one. It does, however mean that a
new Dobbs thriller is bound to make somewhat uncomfortable reading for
any politician and, in particular, the Prime Minister.
Dobbs himself tells the story of how John Major took him genially by
the elbow at some social function and inquired cheerfully as to the plot
of this book. The author had to tell him that it was about how an
unpopular Prime Minister, facing certain defeat at the next General
Election, contemplated how to manage the remainder of his career.
There is, of course, little personal similarity between the odious
Francis Urquhart and the current incumbent and yet there are many echoes
throughout this book, as with its predecessors, of the realities of life
at Westminster.
This is not just a matter of the authenticity which Dobbs manages to
achieve, thanks, of course, to his own knowledge as a former
Conservative Party official, of the way the machinery of government
works. For although there is a fantastic aspect to all the books, death
and dirty dealing being exaggerated beyond expectation, Dobbs does
manage to convey the impression that it is all not quite so far beyond
the bounds of possibility. And he is, let us not forget, a man who knows
both where the oil cans are kept and those parts of the government and
Whitehall machine which most need oiling.
The main criticism I would make of the plot, and to some extent the
action, of this book is that it betrays a sense that it was written for
television. We know already that Ian Richardson is to star in the BBC
adaptation this coming autumn and the setting and story is such that it
should make as popular a series as its predecessors. But reading the
novel is rather like reading a rough draft of the script: you can feel
Dobbs thinking what this will look like on the screen.
There is death and dirty dealing a-plenty. The story mostly revolves
around Urquhart's own dilemma after his sixty-fifth birthday -- it opens
at a performance of Julius Caesar at Stratford (sponsored by a Japanese
car manufacturer) at which there is a conversation between the editor of
The Times and the Foreign Secretary about how ''he should have gone on
his tenth anniversary. Ten bloody years at the top is enough for anyone
isn't it ?''
But there is another plot woven through the book about the pursuit of
peace in Cyprus, where, we learn F U was a young officer during the
troubles of 1956.
I will not go further for fear of ruining the surprises, save to
commend again Dobbs's very good feel for the way politicians speak to
each other, to their enemies, to the press. There is one scene where an
errant minister comes to confess his threatened exposure over an affair
to F U who comments: ''In this business it's always either women or
money -- at least in our party . . .'' And there is considerable humour,
too, and a lovely appreciation of irony.
One delightful idea, which deserves great celebration, is his (or F
U's) observation about how politicians come to resemble their
constituencies: there is the one woman member of the Cabinet, Annita
Burke, ''an unplanned Jewish suburb full of entangling one-way
systems''; Richard Grieve, ''a seedy run-down seafront''; Colin
Cathchpole, the member for the City of Westminster, ''a ruddy face with
the red-brick architectural style of the Cathedral, while other parts of
his anatomy were rumoured to linger in the backstreets of Soho.''
It is sure of success this book, but can the same be said of poor
Dobbs? His reward when he explained the outline of this story to the
real-life Prime Minister was to be appointed deputy chairman of the
Conservative Party. And that is exactly the sort of thing that happens
in his books so it just serves him right.

Explorer-writer Benedict Allen bumped into some exotic
Amazon wild life. It was human, says Deirdre Chapman
BUMBLING about southern Ecuador on a borrowed llama in search of the
source of an Amazon tributary, fresh-faced explorer Benedict Allen
decides to digress before he has begun. His plan is to cross the Amazon
basin's broadest point, but first he makes this side-trip with a drunken
shaman to a remote healing lake where, as his horse bolts on a cliff
path, he is thrown to the ground clutching his video recorder -- and
breaks three ribs. There are moments of tranquillity, but most of this
adrenalin-spattered account has danger coming from every quarter but the
Amazon tribes.
He next points the camera from a trading boat plying the Putumayo, a
river which marks the border between Columbia and Peru and which is, as
everyone but Allen knows, a major crossing point for Peruvian-grown coca
leaves to the processing labs of Columbia. Soon he is being hunted and
shot at, finally escaping on foot through the rainforest to the next
tributary south, which brings him to at the riverside township of
Iquitos.
It is buzzing with crooks, touts, and jungle guides. As a 31-year-old,
four-publication connoisseur of remote tribes, it is Allen's plan to
travel light and solo, without map or compass, but broken ribs soften
him up just enough to be talked into an equipped expedition -- canoes,
outboards, porters, guides -- by two almost Runyanesque jungle con-men,
one Chinese and one Mestizo. They have a plan of their own, of course --
to hijack the expedition into the realm of the dread Remo-Aucas, a tribe
that American missionaries are willing to pay dollars to meet. This
sub-plot has a rich cast of walk-on characters such as The Two Harriets,
Americans who run a jungle mission. Whole Amazon villages have been
founded by escapees from their compound and local tribesmen with a
wife-stealing tradition regularly pluck brides out of the mission
hammocks.
The cry of ''Evangelista'' equals only the approach of the jaguar in
its power to make tribespeople melt into the trees as these bespectacled
enthusiasts canoe up croc-infested tributaries waving gospel tapes.
Benedict Allen has a quality of innocence that puts the reader in the
role of pantomime audience. ''Behind you!'' you want to shout whenever
he gets close to people. When he finally makes contact with the Metses,
the Jaguar People who stick palm-spine whiskers into their lips and
noses, and learns jungle craft from their children, it is this, after
all, that saves him from a succession of murderous, thieving and
double-crossing rogues who infest this awful place and give his book its
unputdownability.
Some of the best travel books of recent years are reappearing under
the new Picador Travel Classics imprint, a few at a time, in affordable
hardback editions, on good paper and inside designer jackets. In a
century of exceptional travel writing and shifting boundaries, they have
some of the status of antiques.
Norman Douglas, Scottish by family but pan-European in education and
diplomatic calling, was fascinated by Europe's wild corners at the
beginning of this century. Old Calabria (1915) is scholarly, convivial,
and shamelessly waspish. ''They are unquestionably a repulsive crowd,''
he writes of the pilgrims to the Grotto of St Michael; while commercial
gentlemen from north Italy are ''worse than malaria''.
Robert Byron's 1937 classic, The Road To Oxiana, combines sardonic wit
and hilariously-rendered dialogue with a passion for the Islamic
architecture of Persia and Afghanistan. ''Here at last,'' he says of
Herat in Afghanistan, ''is Asia without an inferiority complex.''
The Great Railway Bazaar is Paul Theroux's account of a train journey
across Asia 20 years ago. He is at his most splendidly poker-faced with
the lunatic and the macabre. In a Burmese station buffet he is served
three skewered sparrows wrapped in a palm leaf, and on the southern tip
of India he is shown the identical ''tombs of Cain and Abel''. ''Cain?''
he demands, pointing to one. ''Abel?''

SOMETHING critics often forget when discussing the art status of
cinema in general or individual movies in particular is this: movies are
a medium of entertainment. That's not a comment on greedy Hollywood
philistines conspiring to brainwash the masses, just an elementary fact:
no-one deliberately pays over their money to have a bad time.
Therefore (QED and quid pro quo, etc -- and wake up at the back, we'll
be asking questions later), no matter how noble, challenging, or
downright disturbing a movie may be, if it succeeds at all it succeeds
because it gives people some kind of emotional payback for the time and
money invested in watching it. The nobility and all that is the sizzle
that sells the steak that you actually eat.
All of which gives Couch Potato furiously to think about what dark
mental pleasures account for even the small-scale cult popularity of
films like Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer -- an admittedly highly
skilful and even artistic movie that we wouldn't watch again for less
than #100 cash (let's face it, we're cheap) and a handy place to get
sick in.
And here's the problem with Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List
(rental, cert 15). Here's a movie whose subject, painfully and
unflinchingly portrayed, is the atrocity of all time: the Nazi murder
campaign against the Jewish race and other Untermensch minorities. It
did very well with the critics and the Academy, and respectably if not
record-breakingly well at the box office. So a lot of people must have
found it, in some very broad sense of the word, entertaining. So was it
justifiable to make it, to show it, to go and see it -- or is it all
just what those underrated moralists The Sex Pistols call a cheap
holiday in someone else's misery?
Couch Potato's opinion, for what it's worth and with one or two minor
reservations, is that Schindler's List is not only a justifiable but a
fine and even a valuable film. It's not Spielberg's fault that a small
minority of morally illiterate morons -- sad to report, the film played
to laughter from some black inner-city audiences in the States -- will
get the same kind of cheap thrills from it as the porn connoisseurs of
Soho got from Lord Russell's 1961 atrocity expose The Scourge Of The
Swastika. The subject matter makes that inescapable.
For most ordinary people, though, the entertainment qualities of
Schindler's List are innocent: catharsis, pity, and (most commercially
im-portant) uplift. It may not be as important an undertaking as Claude
Lanzmann's nine-hour memory documentary Shoah, or as effective upon its
audience as the concentration-camp footage screened by the Allies for
compulsory viewing in Germany after the war, but as a commercial cinema
film that has been seen by millions rather than thousands -- which is
its greatest virtue, really -- it is as good as it possibly could be.
The story through which Spielberg personalises the Holocaust has the
advantages of being true, remarkable, and morally ambiguous. Oskar
Schindler, the vain, egotistical German industrialist who used
concentration-camp labour to make money but did his best -- including
spending that money -- to keep as many of his workers out of the gas
chambers as he could, was clearly a man who supped with the devil and at
times even used the same spoon; but Liam Neeson's rivetingly underplayed
performance reminds us of the mysterious moral contradictions that exist
in even the best and the worst of men.
Along with its implied exploration of the problem of altruism -- do we
do good for its own sake or to make ourselves feel good, and does it
matter anyway? -- this, as much as the horror and the pity, is what
makes Schindler's List a truly humane and humanist film, one that might
even do that very rare thing -- change your life, or at least change
your attitudes. As E M Forster said: we must love one another or die.
It would be unfair to leave the subject without mentioning three other
things: Ralph Fiennes's highly sophisticated performance as Amon Goeth,
the psychopathic SS officer with whom Schindler conducts his traffic in
souls; the plangently melancholy original music score; and the stark
black-and-white photography that does so much to create the true lie of
emotional realism.
And finally: David Mamet, the distinguished American playwright and
screenwriter, whose brilliant cop thriller Homicide is a superb drama
about what is means to be Jewish, has said that Schindler's List is only
Uncle Tom's Cabin with Jews instead of blacks. It's the most acute
criticism of the film Couch Potato's yet heard; but then, Uncle Tom's
Cabin was a very progressive and worthwhile book in its day.

SCOTTISHNESS, they say, is a broad church; and it can never have
sounded much broader than it did by the end of Thursday evening, when
Radio 3 wound up what it termed its ''Glasgow Night'', the first in a
series of courtesy visits designed to acknowledge the contribution of
''regional centres'' to the music of this Fairest Isle, currently being
celebrated in a year-long season. A very odd programme called De A Nis
-- What Now? was bafflingly billed as ''the closest Radio 3 is ever
likely to get to a traditional ceilidh''. It wasn't remotely
like a ceilidh; nobody danced, nobody drank, nobody joined in the
singing, nobody laughed, nobody clapped, in fact nobody seemed to be
there, apart from Janice Forsyth, the presenter, and a queue of very
polite classical musicians, coming forward to warble a few French
folk-songs, or twangle innocuously on their electric clarsachs.
But perhaps Radio 3 was just trying, belatedly, to correct the balance
of a late evening schedule that might otherwise have been calculated to
drive the network's more conventional fans to distraction; for
immediately after the non-ceilidh, Joe Farrell was to be heard
marshalling a group of Scottish artists through an edition of the
discussion programme Night Waves that sounded like a lot of naughty
post-modern puppies fighting in a bag, cordially agreeing that
Scottishness was beyond definition, impossibly diverse, and all the
better for that, and rounding off with a doleful rendition of the Dundee
mill song, Oh Dear Me, delivered live in the studio by Michael Marra and
Pat Kane. Which was fine by me, although I couldn't help considering
that this Fairest Isle is full of people who have measured their own
social achievement by the fact that they have moved from the world of Oh
Dear Me to the world of more conventional Radio 3 favourites like Byrd,
Delius, Haydn and Bloch; and are liable to start gibbering with rage if
the stuff of popular culture intrudes much further into their sacred
grove.
On Clyde 2, on Wednesday evening, Radio Clyde's favourite Scottish
singer, Peter Mallan, presented a tribute to Robert Burns, a pattern of
music and song by a wide range of artists pieced around episodes from
John Cairney's famous version of Burns' life; and I was struck again by
the extraordinary erotic sweetness of Burns' poetry and his very being,
by the way in which some kind of pure energy of life seemed to bubble
through him, out of the hard earth of Ayrshire, into the lives of the
women he loved, the children he fathered, the verses and songs he left
when he died, burned out at only 37.
For what could possibly be less Scottish, in a way, than this
terrific, uninhibited outpouring of erotic and lyrical energy? What
happened to the crabbed spirit of Holy Willie Calvinism that crouched
over Burns'
community, dragged him and Jean Armour to the cutty stool, and doused
generations of Scottish lives with a suspicion of sensual pleasure that
tinged every joy with a sneer and a warning? And why, if Burns' brave
escape into a world of sweetness and lyricism was so rare in Scottish
life -- and it still seems to me almost unique -- do we feel that he
expresses some essential, generous spirit of the place more truly than
any other poet?
On Radio 4's Book at Bedtime, George MacDonald Fraser, author of
Flashman and former Glasgow newsman, has been reading his own memoir of
the Burmese campaign of 1945, Quartered Safe Out Here; and it's an
honest testament to the values our culture has more traditionally
associated with masculinity, a dour and defensive apologia for the
warrior virtues of stoicism, emotional inarticulacy, loyalty to tribe
and race, contempt for lesser breeds, and unspoken but passionate
attachment to comrades in arms, shading into contempt for the modern
milksop Britain of social workers and the European Union.
But you only need to glance at the life of Burns to see that Fraser's
image of manhood is a sadly limited one, perhaps even dangerously
perverted from the arts of life, which Burns so loved, towards an
introverted all-male love-affair with the business of death. Fraser's
frankness about the strange appeal of battle is valuable and
thought-provoking. But on Wednesday I heard some Rwandan women on
Woman's Hour standing over the mass graves of their parents, sisters,
children, talking of war as a horror without mitigation, tribal hatred
as a nightmare beyond excuse. If Robert Burns had been with us now, he
would have been, in every sense, with the women.

WHAT is news? News, by definition, is something new; something which
has just happened. What are news values? News values are the informal
system of evaluation by which -- out of their experience, instincts,
prejudices, and deference to market expectations -- programme and
newspaper editors assess the significance of new stories and identify
their running order on bulletin or their position on front page.
Much as we might like them to have their own code of ethics, news
values operate in a moral vacuum. Much as we might want to howl with
despair for the values of editors who, on the eve of the anniversary of
the liberation of Auschwitz, headlined the network bulletins with the
furore surrounding one impulsive moment of football violence, the system
was being true to its own chilly code. Cantona has just happened, is
still happening. Auschwitz happened 50 years ago. An anniversary is a
news feature, but it isn't headline news.
It still seems bonkers, doesn't it? Just as it seems bonkers to go on
playing and re-playing Eric's acrobatic assault on his unlovely
tormentor to the sound of pundits and commentators lamenting its example
to the young. But let's be honest -- didn't we all rather enjoy this
exciting piece of ''infotainment''? As we could never enjoy, indeed
barely endure, the memories of the survivors of Auschwitz?
In the main, the BBC and ITN ''news features'' on the anniversary did
the only possible thing with an enormity which few of us can get our
heads round in any useful way. They restrained their reporters and let
the survivors speak. The survivors' words, straight from hell 50 years
on, are among the few that have any validity. Words from the rest of us
are just noises, ''stains on silence''. What can we say that goes
without saying?
Unless we were there . . . like the survivors and like the liberators,
whose testimony if anything is even more crucial. In Sunday's
documentary, Liberation (C4), veteran servicemen from Poland, Russia,
Britain, and America described their experience of the camps as they
reached Auschwitz, Dachau, Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen and the rest, and
its lifelong impact. One was an American soldier of German descent; his
brothers, one American and one German, still refuse to believe that any
of it happened.
It isn't only neo-fascists who try to manipulate the truth about the
Holocaust. The ''denial'' syndrome is complex; some disbelievers can't
deal with the guilt; the seriously ingenuous can't accept that human
beings are capable of evil on this scale. Such ingenuousness is every
bit as dangerous as the propaganda of racial supremacists.
At the other end of the television spectrum Reputations have been up
for grabs: A J P Taylor's in BBC2's eponymous series, Robert Burns's on
Burns Night (as ever), Lady Hester Stanhope's in BBC1's new Heroes and
Villains, John Thaw's in the final part of Kavanagh QC (Central), and
Mark McManus's in Scottish Television's tribute to Jim Taggart's alter
ego.
Some reputations were grabbed more tenderly than others. In Scotland
we don't speak ill of the recently dead, and Mark McManus -- the Taggart
Years was a programme in mourning for Cowcaddens' lost star, not so much
a tribute as a televised wake. It was also a promo video for Taggarts
past and future -- the commercial imperative at Scottish is
death-defying when there's a product to be sold -- and I wish Jim's
young colleagues well, but you won't find me playing the Holy Willie
over Taggart.
It's well-known I didn't like all the hacking and slashing in the
series (although I don't deny the Glenn Chandler scripts are inventively
Gothic) and didn't rate McManus as an actor. ''The lobotomised school of
acting'', I think I called his style. But you don't have to be a good
actor to become a television personality and there's no doubt old DCI
Miseryguts earned his niche in the broadcasting Hall of McFame. Besides,
he made a great exit in Wednesday's final part of his final series, the
little, grudging smile curling into pure mischief, as if he knew
something we didn't know.
What's a poor broadcaster to do? Every year, almost ''as soon as the
black bun boak has congealed'', it's Burns Night again, and every year
arts producers are required to find some way to celebrate it. On
Scottish's new late-night arts magazine Don't Look Down (crazy name,
crazy hour) Janice Forsyth chaired a spirited discussion of the state of
the Scots language, but BBC Scotland came up with the most imaginative
response to the '95 challenge: Burns on the Box, which had Jimmy
Chisholm's bard satirising himself and his industry on a daunder through
the archives with some immortal memories from television and film.
Here were early Suppers BC (''before Cairney'') with folks like
Jameson Clark; magic moments with ''Rabbie's representatives on air''
between the sixties and eighties, Anderson, McKellar, and Cairney; Jean
Redpath's profound sympathy for both classical and folk influences in
the songs. And here was a literate, ironic, but affectionate script from
Daniel O'Rourke, who had Burns musing: ''I must be one of the only
middle-aged Masons in Scotland who's never attended a Burns Supper''.
O'Rourke, who also produced and directed this witty little show, was a
loss to Cowcaddens when he crossed town to Queen Margaret Drive. He's
now left BBC Scotland, disaffected with interference from London.
Perhaps, like many creative people, he's just one of life's natural
mavericks.
A J P Taylor is to television presentation what Chippendale is to
furniture manufacture: a vanished craft. And he didn't even learn it. Is
it possible we all sat down in our millions in the sixties to watch a
speccy little swot in a suit pontificating about the Russian Revolution
-- alone and exposed without benefit of studio design initiatives,
computer graphics, or even archive film? Reputations called him ''an
unusual kind of star'' and concluded, as many have done, that his
delight in performance compromised his career as historian.
Would his television lectures work today? Not, perhaps, to the tune of
four million-plus, which was the kind of audience he pulled at his best.
As I'm always telling those whose nostalgia for ''the golden age of
television'' is excessive, there was a lot less telly around in the
sixties, and fewer programmes meant larger shares of the audience. But
if the medium loves you it will always love you. Take the example of
John Thaw, who has made Kavanagh QC a ratings success. This
crudely-conceived drama series was unworthy of him, but the pained
nobility of Thaw's face, the weight of his presence, and the power of
his craftsmanship transcended its mediocrity.
What of Lady Hester Stanhope's reputation? Patrick Barlow's burlesque
treatment of ''the Queen of the East'' turned the story of this
magnificent eccentric into something more akin to Eddy and Patsy's trip
to Morocco; not unexpectedly, with Jennifer Saunders playing the wayward
adventuress who, like other English travellers in North Africa, found
her destiny in the desert. Saunders can't escape her Absolutely Fabulous
persona quite so easily, and certainly not through such a script. Her
Lady Hester even looked as though La Croix had run up her burnous for a
fashion shoot in Palmyra.

EDWARD LEAR: A Biography
By Peter Levi
Macmillan, #20 (pp 362)
IN his odd way, Edward Lear was a Victorian version of a Renaissance
man. Twentieth child of a stockbroker, he worked as zoological
illustrator in London, gave drawing lessons to Queen Victoria, painted
landscapes on tours that took him from Italy to India. A prolific writer
of prose and verse, he was also a composer and photographer.
He devoted his time to his various talents. He never married though he
made the eccentric gesture of proposing to a woman 46 years his junior.
Moreover, according to Peter Levi who is painfully aware of the current
fashion and passion for disclosing guilty secrets, ''there is no
evidence whatever of homosexuality in **[Lear's]** life.''
How pleasantly surprising, in these days of biographical
character-assassination, to know Levi loves a character who famously
wrote: ''How pleasant to know Mr Lear!/Who has written such volumes of
stuff!/Some think him ill-tempered and queer,/But a few think him
pleasant enough.'' Levi thinks Lear was more than merely pleasant. Lear
created ''great poems'' says Levi. Lear was ''a great artist''.
It would be easy to dismiss such praise as nonsense given a list of
Lear's popular books -- such stuff as A Book of Nonsense (1846) and More
Nonsense (1872) -- and a glance at Lear's illustrated limericks about
the daft Old Man who did this and the dotty Young Lady who did that.
Fortunately, Lear was able to rise above the banal level of his
limericks.
Take ''The Owl and the Pussy-Cat'', which Lear wrote in 1867. It can
be read as a nursery rhyme or as a ''sweet romance'' (Levi's opinion) or
even as a fable looking forward to a Freudian interpretation. It has the
complexity that comes from a positively lyrical use of language. Like
the Owl, Lear could sing a ''charmingly sweet'' song capable of seducing
the senses.
Take ''The Dong with a Luminous Nose'', the first poem in Laughable
Lyrics (1877). No less a critic than T S Eliot -- who paid Lear the
compliment of parody in a minor poem (''How unpleasant to meet Mr
Eliot!/With his features of clerical cut'') -- read this apparently
absurd opus as a poignant expression of unrequited passion. And so it
is. The Dong should not be despised for his bright light of a nose as,
night after night, he goes after his Jumbly Girl.
Levi gives a biographical gloss to the luminous nose of the Dong. As a
boy, Lear was conscious of his own large nose so the poem is a profile
of the artist as a young Dong. Levi always interprets important poems
biographically, enthusing over ''such mature, sad lyrics as the
Yonghy-Bongonghy-Bo, who of course is Lear, and Uncle Arly, who is also
Lear''. There is a simple logic to Levi's simplistic approach. Lear is a
fascinating poet because he was a fascinating person.
A fascinating person who had an intense relationship with his sister
Ann, 22 years his senior. She taught him to draw and drew closer to him
as his parents moved around in an attempt to escape financial problems.
Under Ann's influence, Levi reckons, Lear ''grew up with a girl's
accomplishments'', knowing how to draw and sing but not how to fish or
shoot. Ann never married and spent most of her life in London doting on
the adventures of a brother who doted over her. Ann is identified by
Levi as a dotty Young Lady of Lear's limericks.
After Ann's death in 1860, Lear described himself as ''shockingly
miserable and ill, body and mind'' and many a modern biographer could
ask leading questions about two siblings who remained single and
emotionally dependent on one another until the day one of them died.
Levi, however, has no desire to dwell on the implications of Lear's love
for Ann or vice versa. Levi is too much of an old-fashioned gentleman
for that.
As a result of Levi's hands-off attitude, readers are kept at a
respectable distance from Lear. We learn that Lear adored such eminent
Victorians as William Holman Hunt (unfairly criticised by Levi as a bad
artistic example to Lear) and Emily Tennyson (Ann's replacement as
Lear's surrogate mother) but are firmly assured ''none of these
friendships was remotely sexual''. Levi is so sure of this he is certain
to raise doubts in the minds of his readers.
Once a Catholic priest, Levi is not willing to pry into the privacy of
his subject. He claims Lear was sexually inexperienced which contradicts
Lear's own confession that he once ''had every sort of syphilitic
disease''. Now best known as a poet, Levi writes intelligently of Lear's
poetry but he overpraises Lear's paintings and overprotects Lear's
personality.

THE RISE AND FALL OF POPULAR MUSIC
By Donald Clarke Viking
#22.50 (pp 620)
FROM the long sweet song of popular music the most-quoted confection
remains Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay. Even most solemn tomes of reference give a
line to it. Nobody knows its creator.
Such circumstances of an apparently flimsy and ephemeral subject with
so flighty a stroke of genius at its core make arduous the writing of a
learned formal history. Donald Clarke does manfully. Profound is his
scholarship. Much affection has gone into his thesis. His opinions are
lively.
It is a little problem, however, to wonder who he thinks his readers
will be. They may be BBC Radio 2 fans who like to whistle happy tunes
and rhyme June with moon, while earnestly they have in mind a PhD
degree. Not only for his title is the author indebted to Edward Gibbon
but for a love of length as well.
Although his work is encyclopedic, he treats it as narrative. It is a
tricky arrangement to handle that runs the risk of ''overproduction'', a
favourite word he uses a lot about the latest output of noisy studio
music.
In the quiet detail of the story are rare little joys.
He reveals the anonymous origins of more than a century ago in a St
Louis brothel of what became Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay. He knows who invented
tap dancing. With a light glance he notes in the passing that it was the
novelist Theodore Dreiser who wrote the words of On the Banks of the
Wabash. And Daisy, Daisy echoes how Harry Daire, a songwriter from
England, had to pay Customs duty on a bike he took into America. ''Lucky
for you it wasn't a bicycle for two,'' a friend said. A song was born.
Make a request for a favourite performer and the chances are good that
a reference has been indexed. George Chisholm? In l938 his trombone
accompanied some pipe-organ recordings by Fats Waller. (Edmundo Ros
played the drums.) Although a brief nod to Alma Cogan has escaped the
indexer, she is in the book: ''She is remembered as much for her gowns
as for her voice,'' it dismisses her.
There are even little tartan patches. In an off-beat remark Benny
Carter, alto saxophone player and music arranger, explained why he liked
to have some Scots among his jazz players. ''Wherever they are, there's
happiness,'' he said, presumably not entirely alluding to how they drank
so much than even the other quick white learners of jazz, Jews and
Italians especially, noticed Scottish drouths.
And Cole Porter imperishably rhymed Daddy with finnan haddie.
Donald Clarke, an American who lives in rural Norfolk, takes his opus
from the top. He begins at the beginning. Henry Purcell is credited with
the first pop hit, a tune from an operatic piece.
From there and after 250 years or so on the up and up came the fall.
It happened in l958 precisely, according to the author. He takes the
collapse personally. At the time he was l8.
Frankie Avalon, a former child trumpet player with the Paul Whiteman
band hogged into the top l0 a ditty entitled Dede Dinah. Donald Clarke
writes: ''It mattered to me, deeply mattered, that he could not sing at
all; already a lifelong music fan, the same age as Avalon, I could not
figure out where this junk was coming from, and I was ashamed for my
generation.''
From Henry Purcell onwards and downwards what made the music go round
was money. But while the music business has always been greedy and
stupid (like any business), the industry in its young days was in the
hands of people who also liked music: not now, the author finds. So
totally has technology taken over in the recording studios that kids
don't know what they are listening to any more. Meanwhile, advertising
jingles have made mush of the language of love and of every other
language.
What the author cannot hide up his sleeve-notes is his pedigree, not
to say his age. His own distaste, even despair, becomes a bonus for his
book. Chronicling the collapse, as he hears it, of pop makes his
narrative crackle.
So British television pop shows have come to celebrate, not music, but
children prancing in fancy clothes. Elvis's Heartbreak Hotel (l956)
''sounds like it was made underwater in a breadbox''. Anything goes so
long as it is plugged hard and played loud. Undeserving ditties ''ooze
up the charts like castor oil through a pig''.

BOYFRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS
By Douglas Dunn.
Faber, #14.99 (pp 262)
THESE stories echo many of the themes and concerns expressed in
Douglas Dunn's previous collection, Secret Villages. He continues to
examine the accepted cliches of Scottish life, exploring the realism
behind the pretence.
The stories are mostly set in imaginary small-town locations, places
which reflect their inhabitants desires and preoccupations. He ignores
most recent trends in Scottish writing, occupying a timeless present,
where villagers seek security in their collective and individual pasts,
guarding their memories against the ravages of the world outside their
experience, against a contemporary society which is filled with
political and social horrors they do not understand.
There is the same melancholy edge to his prose, coupled with a
surprising sense of humour and the attention to detail we have come to
expect from his poetry. Initially, his style appears bland; he has a
fondness for adjectives and uses a dialogue that is generally free of
accent or inflection. But his prose is beautifully judged and though the
tone is often formal, it is perfectly suited to Dunn's intentions and
conveys a message that is more cerebral than direct.
Many lives seem unimportant. People are locked in their pasts.
Patterns and intentions were set long before these stories started and
rather than showing a moment of resolution, Dunn often displays the ways
in which characters are locked in their personalities, trapped in
themselves. He shows how their paths are set, thereby making the
characters more tragic, the inevitability of their loneliness and
disappointment all the more revealing.
The first story is a model of stealth and skill, achieving almost
seamlessly the most difficult contrivance for any short story, the
passage of time, something many writers choose to ignore. Dunn makes it
the centre, constructs his action around it, creating the effect almost
by disguise.
Orr Mount is a big house ''400 yards off the road, at the end of its
own private lane''. It is in disrepair. The garden, literally, hides the
house. It is bought by a civil servant, Henderson and his wife, who
share the house with their blind son. They are obvious incomers to the
area.
The house is lovingly restored by Monty Gault, a local handyman.
Henderson pays Gault to do what neither he nor his wife can do for
themselves. Though they had trouble with a previous, larger contractor,
the work is doled out piecemeal the way the Hendersons want rather than
what would be good for the house. Gault is the hired hand. They ignore
his advice, though he anticipates the entire restoration, garden and
all.
Henderson's wife sees the garden as her husband's concern and it soon
becomes obvious it will never be done, that the couple are locked in
their position and the hopelessness of their marriage. The untidy garden
surrounds more than the house.
In the end, when the place is finished and furnished to Mrs
Henderson's specifications, Gault pleads to do the ground, finally
observing they have the swankiest house and the nastiest garden.
In many ways it is the story of the men's wives, Mrs Henderson set and
nervous, intent on control, on getting her way through correct
procedures. She is beautifully contrasted with Mrs Gault, who is a
reflection of her husband's concerns.
Buildings and property feature in many stories and the underlying
violence of wealth and status is a continuing theme. Loss and
loneliness, absence and longing, the condition of memory control many
actions.
''The Political Piano'' brings a European past to the Scottish
Borders, where a freelance television producer confronts a Czech
composer with Nazi collaboration. There's no such thing as fair play in
the twentieth century, Hanka tells the producer. If we talk for a week
you will not understand, says his wife to the producer's girlfriend.
Dunn is a gentle, unexpected writer who is not afraid to use your
expectations against you, to carry you beyond narrative into
psychological areas where choice and morality give way to more
realistic, everyday concerns.

SACRED GAMES
By Gerald Jacobs
Hamish Hamilton, #16.99 (pp 271)
EVEN after so many decades there are no easy ways to think or write
about the Holocaust and yet, perhaps for that very reason, the black
hole at the century's heart still seems to demand words. As in early
Beckett or early Wittgenstein, there is a compulsion to articulate what
seems beyond speech, to comprehend what seems incomprehensible. There
is, not least for the survivors, a duty to speak.
Perhaps because we understand what happened only too well, but
understand its reasons not at all, the Nazis' industrialisation of mass
murder will never cease to have this effect. Time passes, but as the
recent Auschwitz commemorations have shown, this subject has so many
moral and spiritual dimensions as to be all but inexhaustible. We are
obliged to remember; we are obliged to warn; most of all we are obliged
to remind ourselves of the nature of a species that can display its
sentience by rendering its own kind to ashes and smoke.
For all that, the Holocaust breeds inhibitions. The scum of humanity
persist in denying its reality. Others, Germans not least, have believed
that amnesia is a kind of healing process. Some of us, meanwhile, might
argue that art is so dwarfed by what happened in the camps that any
recourse to the stories and images of the slaughter by anyone other than
a survivor is an impertinence and an insult.
The poet who deploys Belsen as a metaphor, or the novelist who finds a
plot in the ineradicable trauma of Dachau, are guilty, in other words,
of misappropriation. Steven Spielberg, Jewish as he is, seems not to
have comprehended the argument that he had no right, moral or artistic,
to turn the story of Schindler's Ark into an Oscar-winning Hollywood
production, no matter how honest or illuminating his work might be. He
was not qualified.
Miklos Hammer has more qualifications than he ever sought. Raised the
son of a rabbi in Hungary; trained as a medical student; conscripted in
1941 into a forced labour brigade; transported to Birkenau when the
Germans took Budapest; transferred to Auschwitz; then (near the war's
end, with the Russian's approaching) shuttled through the circles of
hell from camp to camp before assuming the identity of a dead Englishman
and finding his way to Britain.
That might have been an end to it, but the bureaucracy that was second
cousin to the Nazis obsession with order did not take kindly to his
deception when it was discovered. Thus, this survivor of the final
solution, one of the war's indisputable heroes, was interned by the
liberators for eight months alongside several leading Nazis until a
campaign led by the MP Sidney Silverman won him the right to stay in
Britain. If Miklos Hammer has any faith left in human nature, he has a
larger spirit than any of his captors ever had.
Like many of those who lived when they should have died, Hammer vowed
to himself that one day he would tell his story. In Gerald Jacobs,
features and literary editor of the Jewish Chronicle, who spent four
years recording this extraordinary life before composing Sacred Games,
he has found something more than an amanuensis.
This is neither a biography nor a novel. You might call it a
chronicle. It has the prose style of fiction and the grinding,
matter-of-fact understatements of history. It is artful, in other words,
but art is given a subordinate place to the dramas and images which
spring from simple, ineluctable truths. More than anything else, Sacred
Games reminds you how the Holocaust has become its own higher art, an
art of fact and unadorned description: Jews died; Nazis killed them; the
number and the manner of the deaths is all that anyone really needs to
know.
Hammer had more luck than anyone has the right to expect, but he also
possessed powers of endurance so rare as to seem freakish.
Anyone who knows anything about the Final Solution will find little
that is new in this account. That isn't the point. This is one subject
of which enough is never said and of which nothing can really be said.
Jacobs and Hammer have given unforgettable, heartbreaking life to that
human paradox.

THESE past few days, Americans have appeared obsessed, to the
exclusion of everything else, by the O J Simpson case. CNN, the news
network, has been carrying every last, tedious twist of procedural
disputes between lawyers, live, for months. They have a series of
correspondents whose only duty is to stand outside the courthouse to
give us a summary of the situation every half hour.
Usually they have nothing new to report, but the network broadcasts
their ramblings all the same.
But now that the trial has really begun, CNN has gone into overdrive.
On Thursday, the House of Representatives was debating amendment of the
Constitution to force the federal budget into balance. If it passes and
is ratified, it will change everything in America, radically.
CNN ignored the story completely, but gave, live, a long press
conference by doctors in a Los Angeles hospital who had been treating
one of the O J prosecutors (he is not seriously ill).
CNN is, in fact, a thoroughly second-rate news channel, with a very
imperfect news sense. On non-O J days, half the day is spent in female
chat shows, whatever is happening in the world. But on O J, it merely
carries the national obsession to ludicrous extreme. The fascination
with the trial is genuine and remarkable.
Partly, it is the usual interest in celebrity. People Magazine
recently had Princess Diana on its cover every week for 12 weeks.
That appeared to editors to be quite enough, so they dropped her the
following week -- and circulation fell 25% immediately.
O J was a famous football player in his day, and was then recycled as
star of Hertz rent-a-car commercials, and as straight man in the Naked
Gun comedies. These were not great roles, though they brought in the
money, and he would have peacefully faded away, like all other sporting
stars, remembered only by ageing fanatics who can recite the statistics
at the drop of a hat.
But he had not faded far when his wife and a friend of hers were
murdered last June. We have often noted that he is the most celebrated
defendant in a murder trial since the movie star Fatty Arbuckle in the
early 20s, and that's a large part of the interest of the case.
There have been others (all called ''The Trial of the Century'') that
aroused the same public frenzy, notably the trial of Bruno Hauptmann,
who had kidnapped and murdered the baby son of Charles Lindbergh, the
first man to fly the Atlantic from New York to Paris. Indeed, CNN, the
National Enquirer, the Star and all the rest are behaving with sedate
propriety compared with the press at the Hauptmann trial 60 years ago.
When the prosecution opened its case on Tuesday, the scene was carried
on just about every television set in the country. The major networks
and all the specialised news services scrapped their normal programming.
Several of them set up emergency hotlines for people desperate to know
what was happening in the soap operas.
Race is an issue. Johnnie Cochran, the highly skilled defence
attorney, who is black, says: ''There is a conspiracy against black
males. If this can happen to Michael Jackson and to O J Simpson, it can
happen to all of us.''
He is talking nonsense, of course, and he is also talking to the jury,
which includes eight blacks. It only needs one of them to decide that Mr
Simpson is being framed, whatever the evidence, to get an acquittal --
or at least a mistrial.
That is how Marion Barry escaped conviction on the major drug use
charges against him, and was found guilty on one, trivial count alone.
One of the jurors was sure that he had been framed and refused even to
discuss the possibility that he might be guilty.
Mr Barry is, therefore, now mayor of Washington again. It is entirely
possible that Mr Simpson will be out on the streets in a few months, for
that same reason (though one may doubt that Hertz or Hollywood will
offer him work again).
Another reason for our morbid fascination is the nature of the crime.
It was a particularly-brutal double murder. Whoever killed Nicole
Simpson and Ron Goldman nearly hacked their heads off, and stabbed
Goldman 20 or 30 times. This, of course, is the best argument the
defence has: would not the murderer have been soaked in blood, and, if
it was O J, would not his car have been filled with blood, not spotted
here and there, as the police allege?
There was the melodramatic story of the discovery of the bodies,
prompted by a dog howling and sniffing at the pathway where the bodies
lay. The cast of characters is pure California: the witnesses can time
their movements precisely because they were watching their favourite
television shows, and made telephone calls or went out for walks when
the shows ended.
Mr Simpson has a half-dozen lead attorneys and a reserve army of
others. He must be spending four or five thousand dollars an hour on
legal talent alone. They can make wonderful television, meaning
entertainment -- even when they are just arguing with the prosecution
over the admissibility of evidence.
And that's the heart of it. This is entertainment, this is a story,
and everyone is riveted by its twists and turns.
America is a very violent country. Horrible murders are committed
every day. Washington, a city with a population of 570,000, has about
400 murders a year. One teenager shot and killed another at school the
other day.
A Supreme Court justice, out for an evening run at a Navy base on the
river, heard a string of shots one evening, and asked the guard at the
gate what had happened. It was just a gun battle between two drug gangs,
he was told, nothing out of the ordinary.
People are now being executed for murder almost every day, sometimes
more than one a day, and the event scarcely merits a mention in the
papers. This is a country whose politics sometimes seem to be driven by
fear of crime more than any other emotion.
The O J Simpson trial is different. It is not the usual case of
teenage violence, or a drug dispute. If O J is guilty, it was a crime
passionel, committed by a celebrity, a sports hero, a strange, secretly
violent man who offered a smiling, friendly face to the world.
The trial, paradoxically, about blood and violence, is really
entertainment, allowing people to escape from the far worse reality of
the streets.

Michael Fry reports how Scotland has not only survived the recession
remarkably well but is making the most of the recovery and defying its
'invalid economy' tag
THE old saw said that when the British economy caught a cold, the
Scottish economy caught pneumonia, of which the main symptom was the
withering of jobs. Recently, the invalid's health appears to have
improved. If 11 years of Thatcherism effectively completed, on one view,
the deindustrialisation of Scotland, it may not be altogether clear how
he kept himself alive at all. It is, therefore, even stranger that he
should now in some ways be showing greater strength than before the Iron
Lady's rigorous cure of cold douches and starvation diets.
The earliest sign of convalescence was the patient's ability to resist
the recession that set in at the end of the 1980s. The test of it will
come as the recovery gets under way, when we shall see if the Scottish
economy can keep up the good performance, especially by the
traditionally unflattering comparison with its healthier neighbour in
the south.
The first indications are not bad. Last week brought a crop of
economic statistics showing that, if anything, the recovery may be a bit
too rapid. Inflation suddenly rose, while unemployment suddenly dropped
faster than expected.
For Scotland, unemployment remains the measure of measures. During the
recession, the rate of unemployment fell, for the first time in
three-quarters of a century, below the average for the UK.
The difference is small but significant, or perhaps not. It may be
that only passing, special circumstances let the Scottish economy
achieve this improvement. Activity picked up in the North Sea for
reasons outside our control, and since Scotland had had no housing boom
it followed that there could be no housing slump. It would have been
mere arithmetical illusion for the numbers to look better merely because
the economy suddenly got worse in England, while in Scotland it remained
as bad as it had ever been.
This is why it is worth keeping a close eye on the numbers from now
on. If, deep down, things have not changed, we would expect the apparent
improvement to vanish during the recovery. The two economies would move
back into their familiar relationship, the English one clearly outdoing
the Scottish one, and the numbers would show it.
That, however, is not happening, at any rate not yet. When the UK as a
whole last month notched up one of the biggest falls in unemployment on
record, Scotland went right along with it. We have unemployment lower
than anywhere outside the South of England and the East Midlands, lower
too than a few places below a line from the Severn to the Wash. Greater
London has a rate of 10.1%, for exampled, against Scotland's rate of
8.5%.
If we break down the figures within Scotland, we find spots with some
of the lowest rates in all of Britain: in Lothian, Grampian and the
Northern Isles. We can cap this with an international comparison, and
say that unemployment in Scotland is below the average for the G7
countries, the world's leading industrial powers.
So it must be time at least to pose the question whether something has
happened deep down to the Scottish economy. The 1980s saw more of the
big changes that had been going on for at least two decades.
Deindustrialisation was one way of describing them, and the sudden death
of old industrial communities was certainly one of their more obvious
features.
Yet completion of the process -- if that is what it was -- has
actually brought more Scots into work. By 1991, at the latest census of
employment, there were, for the first time, just over two million people
employed in Scotland. The number had grown by about 100,000 during the
1980s. There were besides about 250,000 self-employed, a figure risen by
more than 70,000 over the decade. And there were another 40,000 or so on
official schemes of work-related training. Given that the population
remained more or less stable, all this added up to a slow but steady
increase in the proportion of it which we can define as belonging to the
workforce. In other words, whatever happened to unemployment, there were
more Scots in jobs than ever before.
Of course, they were often different types of jobs from the
traditional ones. Of the two million employees in 1991, 500,000 worked
only part-time. Of these, 420,000 were women. And of these 390,000
worked in services. Scotland has become an economy based on services,
which now account for 70% of all employment.
Professor Lawrie Hunter of Glasgow University has investigated whether
the combination of these trends gives a more flexible labour force,
which might be a plausible explanation of improved economic performance.
The increase in ''non-contractual employment'', in part-time working,
temporary working and self-employment could offer some measure of this
flexibility. But it remains to be proved whether that is the true
explanation of speedy recovery from recession, of ''greater business
dynamism'' and of the containment of wage inflation at the same time.
Professor Grant Baird, head of Scottish Financial Enterprise, sees a
more specific link. Pointing out that the financial sector in Scotland
almost tripled in size during the 1980s, he comments: ''The pace of
change has been such that the industry has often found itself faced with
temporary demands for workers on new products or to put new structures
in place. Non-contractual employment has been the sensible way of
dealing with that. Deregulation of the financial markets and
deregulation of the labour markets have in that sense gone hand in
hand.''

Nicola Reeves reports how the Kingfisher retail chain is hoping that a
boardroom reshuffle and strategy revamp will help it catch more
customers
THE climate for retailing in the 1990s is very much harsher than in
the heady days of the late 1980s consumer boom. Consumer confidence
remains fragile after the depths of the recession and the prospect of
further rises in interest rates in the coming months will do nothing to
change sentiment.
Low inflation makes it doubly hard for retailers to push up their
prices and therefore profit margins. In any case, the recession prompted
consumers to become more value-conscious in its widest sense. Good
service and low prices are essential offerings these days if retailers
are to prosper.
If profitability in-store is to rise then retailers have either to cut
their operating costs in areas such as distribution or else sell
significant volume to offset the impact of lower mark-ups on prices.
Kingfisher, the retail chain whose trading formats include B&amp;Q,
Woolworths, Comet and Superdrug, was one of the first retailers to
recognise which way the retail wind was blowing.
Companies such as Boots and W H Smith have invested heavily in retail
computer systems in recent years which has led to a steady increase in
productivity and resultant fall in operating costs. Kingfisher has
chosen to follow a different strategy by offering ''Every Day Low
Prices'', (EDLP), since the beginning of 1993.
In the past, in the case of B&amp;Q and Superdrug, this has led to serious
price cutting which has boosted their market share, albeit at the
expense of profits. It takes time for an EDLP strategy to feed through
to the bottom line, and in the case of Kingfisher this has yet to
happen.
Borrowed from the US, the retail theory of EDLP relies on striving for
market leadership in key sectors at the expense of margins if necessary.
However, EDLP is complex to operate and requires investment in
sophisticated systems, an area in which Kingfisher has only recently
started to invest. Comprehensive merchandise ranges are also vital to
attract shoppers through the door and encourage them to part with their
cash.
City impatience with the poor trading performance of Kingfisher was
behind yesterday's boardroom reshuffle which saw the departure of
Kingfisher's chief executive Alan Smith and finance director James
Kerr-Muir. Mr Smith was poached from Marks and Spencer in 1993 on a
remuneration package rumoured be about #1m per annum. One of his roles
at Kingfisher was to help improve Kingfisher's systems and distribution.
Recently Kingfisher warned that profits in the current financial year
could be hit by exceptional costs of up to #100m associated with
revamping the business. A review of the Comet and Woolworths business is
underway, supervised by Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, who has stepped down from
the chairmanship of Kingfisher to become chief executive. He was one of
the founders of the group in 1982 via a buy-out of the Woolworths chain
from its parent company in the US.
Although the company has said it has no plans to dispose of the two
businesses they are expected to be significantly overhauled. In both
cases Kingfisher has missed the boat in terms of product ranges. For the
second consecutive year Woolworths experienced distribution problems
with its Christmas stock which hit sales and pushed up costs. There are
serious competitive pressures facing Woolworths in many of its key
product ranges. In home entertainment, for example, children's videos,
food superstores such as Sainsbury and Asda are an emerging force whose
market share looks set to grow. In toys, rapid store-opening programmes
by the two market leaders Argos and Toys R Us, is putting considerable
pressure on Woolworths.
The UK electrical retailing market is intensely competitive following
the growth of out-of-town superstores owned by the privatised regional
electricity companies. To a lesser extent US-style warehouse clubs such
as Costco are also putting pressure on electrical profit margins.
Technology changes so rapidly that retailers have to keep abreast of
developments if they are to increase their sales and profits. This
Christmas was a multimedia one in terms of demand for electrical goods
with personal computers and mobile phones top of the popularity league.
Comet, Britain's second largest electrical retailer, failed to spot this
trend and subsequently lost market share to Dixons, the market leader.
In many of its chosen markets Kingfisher has a commanding position,
but in these days of consumer caution that is not enough to guarantee
profits growth. Following the boardroom changes the City was awash with
bid speculation with overseas retailers from both the Continent and the
US mentioned as possible suitors of Kingfisher.

I would be grateful if you would allow me to draw to the attention of
readers the support of this college for Terry Lewis's Private Members'
Bill on tobacco products labelling. The success of this Bill has
particular relevance to the health of Scots as we have an unenviable
record of smoking-related illnesses.
Thirty-four per cent of Scottish men and women smoke -- the comparable
figures for Great Britain being 29% of men and 28% of women. Smoking
causes around 30 deaths per day in Scotland and 92 Scots are admitted to
hospital each day because they have an illness caused by smoking,
unsually lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, or coronary
heart disease.
Scotland has the unfortunate distinction of having one of the highest
rates in the world for each of these lethal diseases. The scale of the
problem can perhaps be best appreciated by looking at the cause of death
in 1000 young 20-a-day smokers: one will be murdered, six will die in
road traffic accidents, and 250 will die prematurely as a result of
smoking.
This health message is not getting through as 32% of young men and 36%
of young women in the 16-24 year age group in Scotland smoke.
Smoking also causes fires and around 50% of deaths from house fires
are attributable to smoking. In addition, passive smoking harms babies
and children, causing decreased growth and increased cough, wheeze, and
ear problems.
Tobacco may be the most dangerous consumer product currently on sale
in Scotland. This college has been concerned by recent marketing
promotions which appear designed both to increase smoking in children
and minimise the visibility of existing health warnings.
Such marketing devices must be made illegal: hence our strong support
of Mr Lewis's Bill, which requires warnings and health information
carried on packets containing tobacco products to be displayed more
prominently.

I would like to correct Anne Johnstone on one point in her article on
the job seeker's allowance to replace unemployment benefit (January 11).
She states: ''Unemployment benefit, which it replaces, is currently
payable, without being means-tested, for a year.''
Unemployment benefit is means-tested. If you are over 55 and made
redundant your unemployment benefit will be deducted by 10p per week for
every 10p over #35 per week your occupational pension pays.
This means if you have an occupational pension of #70 per week or more
you will receive no unemployment benefit at all.
If you are under 55 you will receive full unemployment benefit for a
year regardless of how much pension you receive.

We would like to endorse the sentiments expressed in The Herald
regarding Sir Alexander Gibson. We would like to think that there would
be some permanent memorial which everyone would be aware of (not only
classical music lovers), for example the Sir Alex Gibson Hall or the
Gibson Concert Hall.
With the concert hall renamed and Buchanan Street made into the
Champs-Elysees of Glasgow, a statue of Sir Alexander Gibson somewhere in
the vicinity would be splendid. This statue could be unveiled during the
City of Architecture year and would be a fitting tribute to the
architect of the musical life of Scotland.

We have all been deeply saddened by the passing of Sir Alexander
Gibson. During the past week or so, Conrad Wilson's excellent biography
Alex apart, his tremendous contribution towards the cultural life of
Scotland in general, and Glasgow in particular, has been properly
acknowledged and articulated.
The legacy which he left will undoubtedly live on, but it has been
suggested that the city of Glasgow should find a way of permanently
commemorating him.
When I visited Austria last autumn with the Royal SNO, the orchestra
that Sir Alex shepherded for a quarter of a century, I was struck by the
fact that they take their music so seriously there that they name
streets and squares after conductors and orchestras (for example Herbert
von Karajan Platz and Wiener Philharmoniker Gasse).
I think Sir Alexander Gibson Street or Square would sound equally
attractive and appropriate, especially if the location was in the
vicinity of the Theatre Royal, RSAMD, and the City and Royal concert
halls, where he spent so much of his (musical) life.
During his lifetime he never sought the limelight. Let us not deny him
it now. And may he rest in peace.

Quite good, Michael Kelly, but not good enough (January 26).
There still wasn't a piece of music commissioned in the name of the
city in 1975, when I suggested it and when Glasgow could have had the
support and involvement of someone of the stature of Sir Alexander
Gibson.
And of course it was Michael Kelly who commissioned the Glasgow
Overture nine years later.
Now that I have successfully caused the unearthing of three works
named for the city, perhaps someone will promote them rather more
efficiently so that knowledgeable people like my researchers, and a
great many others, will be aware of their existence.

Nicholas Light suggests that Sir Alexander Gibson might have been the
first president of an independent Scotland, saying: ''A few years ago,
in another small European state, there were those who thought that the
very idea of having a mere author as president was quite ludicrous.''
I can't remember any such objection to Vaclav Havel in Czechoslovakia.
But then, there is nothing new in a musician presiding over a large
nation. Am I the only person left who knows who Jan Paderewski was, and
where Poland is? I still have all his recordings.

Chris Green's determination to sustain the current ScotRail network
represents the sort of leadership of which we can be proud (January 12).
His comments will have public support across the broad political
spectrum as timely rebuke to this Government which postures its belief
in the value of Britain's rail assets yet systematically destroys and
denies management's ability to deliver a system worthy of current and
future expectations.
Perhaps even more weight would have attached to Chris Green's
interview if he had used the ''deferment'' of the much required Dornoch
rail bridge on the Inverness-Thurso/Wick line to drive home the brutal
truth of railway investment starvation which, unless reversed, will lead
to irrelevance, decline, and closure.
It has become Britain's most vulnerable line solely because of the
Scottish Office's irrational and vindictive refusal to give the relative
crumbs of investment required for upgrading and improvement via the
Dornoch bridge route. This still offers the prospect of a more
efficient, more competitive, better used route between Inverness and
ScotRail's main customer base in Caithness and Orkney.
Although Chris Green's earlier attempts to get equality of treatment
for rail and road at Dornoch have seen the wilderness years, the design
of the Dornoch road bridge does at least provide for a future parallel
rail crossing.
This, and the current availability of EU Objective One Highland
funding, surely offers a new window of opportunity for a revitalised
North Highland Line.
There is every reason to believe this sort of application for European
assistance would receive approval if Railtrack were willing to help
ScotRail fight its corner in the way outlined by Chris Green.
Gaining approval for the Dornoch Line improvement not only offers the
only real safeguard of a long-term future for the line to Caithness and
its Orkney connection, it also represents for us in the Highlands a test
case of whether this Government has the courage and commitment to
respond to the climate of expectation for a better and more enduring
rail system.

In my letter (Paying double, January 24) the following sentence was
omitted: ''I would like to draw attention to a route by which taxpayers'

For ScottishPower to charge charities the industrial rate for

David Marsh criticises the station locations on the Glasgow Cross rail
link recently accepted by Strathclyde Regional Council (January 18).
The revised station site south-west of Saltmarket was suggested by the
Scottish Association for Public Transport after detailed study of the
area and is the best site for serving shopping areas both at Glasgow
Cross and the St Enoch Centre.
The prime purpose of this station is to give rail travellers access to
as wide a shopping and business area as is possible and, while arguments
can be made for a number of locations, the St Enoch Centre surely cannot
be ignored as a legitimate destination for rail travellers from
Glasgow's South Side.
The proposed travelator walkway to the busy Argyle Street station area
will further extend the range of city centre shops and offices
accessible from the Cross Rail link and will provide interchange with
the Argyle line.
The Glasgow Cross Rail link deserves full support as a strategic
public transport development overcoming the historical divide between
Glasgow's South Side and north Clyde rail networks, and offering a rail
alternative to the congested M8. With the design of this link now
completed, securing Government funding for this project is now the main
priority.

Jesus Christ was cheerful and gay but definitely not ''gay'' as
allegedly told by an Iona Community guide to a group of visitors
(January 7). The guide's alleged comment that Jesus was a homosexual is
appalling and nothing short of blasphemy. It is very sad that such
remarks should come from Iona Abbey, which is renowned as a focus for
understanding of Christianity and now should turn into the epicentre of
reaction to the ''gay Christ'' claim.
It is most disappointing and surprising that no priest, minister,
mullah, guru, or even the ''defender of the faith'' has taken note of
the guide's highly derogatory and blasphemous remarks as if they all
have lost respect for Jesus Christ, their Lord.
Such comments, as alleged, are out of character of the prophets. They
are all sinless and a model for their nation. Only a pervert can imagine
and associate such things with prophets.

For space reasons, one assumes, a key paragraph was cut from my
article on Robert Burns right after my observation that he had to have
some inducement to take on a bad farm like Ellisland (January 21). It
occurred directly above the paragraph pointing out that Adam Smith, in
contrast, was given an indoor excise sinecure which allowed him to live
in near luxury, and read:
''Burns was given the local excise job, which somehow fell vacant, and
was forced to ride 200 miles a week with a crippled leg and do four sets
of books a night while trying to run his farm, and was broken in health.
His remaining money was leached into the River Nith, he was decanted
into Dumfries and could not move from his post without written
permission. He died in poverty on July 21, 1796, four years later.''
I also wrote, ''Never cowpt a 'hint nor drew a feerin', and worse
still . . .'' Finally I pointed out ''if they'' (meaning the Burns
girns) ''could ever write Burns preferred Standard Habbie, they have
surely been ower blate to tell us . . .'', meaning if they could in fact
write Standard Habbie they've kept somewhat quiet about it.
Perhaps this will satisfy the many phone callers, few of whom were
inquiring after my health.

It is only right that a bank employee replies to Jim Thompson's letter
(January 17).
Banks are not charitable organisations. They are profit-making
businesses, providing a vast range of high-quality services to their
customers, many of whom enjoy free banking. These accounts actually cost
the banks money.
As a result of public pressure, unlike other service-orientated
businesses, our charges are very well documented and reflect very fairly
the complexity of the facility being provided to the customer.
While banks may be guilty of ''keeping'' customers' money for two or
three days this pales into insignificance compared to the average seven
days building societies like to hang on to clients' money.
Mr Thompson should approach his bank manager should he require
financial assistance. It will be cheaper than not approaching him and
going into the red. It may actually save him money.

THE latest social trends survey confirms that we are healthier and
wealthier than never before. Despite this fact, the ''born to fail''
bores were at it again last week. You may have caught the Scottish
Reporters programme which revisited the children who were dubbed ''born
to fail'' 21 years ago or seen the newspaper spread that featured
Blackhill, where the loan sharks are apparently going out of business
because the youngsters can earn more from a life of crime.
It was the usual dismal jimmy stuff. ''The relentless growth of deep
poverty has created a social timebomb in Scottish society. It is forcing
the desperately poor into the jaws of evil moneylenders and driving
young people to drink, drugs, and a life of crime.'' The way it is
presented, it seems an inexorable process, rather like ducks bobbing
helplessly in the rapids as they are swept towards Niagara Falls. No-one
mentions that the alternative of flapping their wings and rising above
disaster may be open to them.
If the big fallacy of right-wing political theory is that the free
market will solve all ills if simply left to get on with it, the big
fallacy of socialism is that these self-same ills can be eliminated by
providing more amenities and by anti-poverty measures. Both are so naive
and wrong that you sometimes wonder whether the people who advance them
live in the real world.
The free market is not a level playing field and the referee is
occasionally bribed to see it the way of the most powerful players. But
let us not jump to the opposite and equally daft conclusion that all it
needs is to level the field, pay both teams equally and justice will
abound. For a start there can be no such thing as human equality. The
sooner we realise it, the better for all concerned. We should be
striving to be better people rather than to create a mirage of equality
which will soon disappear.
If you think that is a trifle harsh, let me refer you to the teachings
of Jesus, who was fond of parables about the somewhat different talents
which we possess, about more being demanded from those who had more, and
that the first would be last, that the poor would always be around etc
etc. He was also (unfortunately for those who like thinking of him as a
kind of patron saint of socialism) rather fond of placing personal
responsibility upon people's shoulders and there is no mention in his
teaching about social conditions creating sin. It is people who do that.
Jesus had compassion for sinners but did not mouth platitudes about
bad housing ''forcing'' youth to turn to mugging travellers on the road
to Jericho as a means of earning a living. He gave a body swerve to
attempts to pin him down to a particular course of political action. Why
should we start manipulating his teaching 2000 years later to give
credence to a political philosophy that is fast being abandoned all
around the world (including by our very own Labour Party)?
The problems of Blackhill are not about lack of money, they are
poverty of spirit. All around Glasgow we see communities that tell the
same story. In every one religion has been abandoned by the vast
majority. They have relied on a clapped-out philosophy which told them
that new tower blocks were a more realistic way to heaven and look where
it has got them.
I am not one of these people who deride our social security system. It
was and is providing care, security, and a minimum financial level for
millions of people who would have been callously cast aside by our
pre-war society when everyone was running up and down tenement stairs
being good neighbours. Yet today's toddlers have better health care,
better family allowances, and possess gadgets and luxuries as
necessities which were the stuff of science fiction but a few decades
ago.
Why then all the dismal jimmy stuff, why the high crime rate, why the
wish to portray our standard of living as that of a Third World country?
Partly because we are hung up on the idea of material benefits and
egalitarianism as the parameters by which we judge our degree of
civilisation. That leads to moaning that whatever is available to the
richest must be available to the poorest . . . or else the terrible sin
of INEQUALITY will have been committed.
Humility, contentment, charity have a hard job fitting into this
picture. These are qualities that accept inequality in material terms
and do not girn about it. They are qualities that my grandparents and
their generation possessed in abundance, yet their generation never knew
proper sanitation, never mind video-recorders and freezers. Charity is
not mentioned in surveys of social trends but one indicator of its
presence is the number of people who turn out to profess their belief in
God in public and we all know what the social trend has been in that
area. Could they be by any chance related?

THE Northern Ireland peace process is moving ahead, if slowly. This is
the only sensible way to proceed; a series of interlocked issues of the
complexity of those which have bedevilled Ireland cannot be unravelled
at a stroke. Leaving aside the Gordian knot solution, the only hope of
success is for the current process of detailed discussion of position
papers by both the British and Irish governments to continue with as
much care and goodwill as can be summoned. That said, it would take
superhuman control to avoid irritation at the many problems which are
scattered across the path to peace. The RUC Chief Constable Sir Hugh
Annesley said yesterday that it was inconceivable that paramilitary
prisoners convicted of terrorist outrages could be released early from
jail. This is so incontrovertibly true that he should not have needed to
say it. Despite the problems of the Diplock courts it is not thought
that there are large numbers of victims of miscarriages of justice among
the terrorist prisoners from both sides of the argument. Many of them
have been convicted of the most despicable crimes and must serve the
sentences they have been given. To suggest anything else would cause
extreme and unjustifiable upset to those of their victims who survived
and to the families of those who did not.
None of this has stopped the issue of the early release from jail of
terrorists being used by propagandists. As we reported yesterday, the
Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, is uneasy about the
campaign to release the jailed paratrooper, Private Lee Clegg, because
he fears it may be used by others to damage the wider peace process. It
was picked up quickly by Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuinness, who
protested initially at the anger that would be caused if Private Clegg
was released. Having sat down and thought about it, or more likely
contacted the infinitely more subtle Gerry Adams (who cynically
supported the release of Clegg), Mr McGuinness changed tack and said
that it was inconceivable that prisoners of war should not be released
at the end of a conflict.
By prisoners of war, Mr McGuinness and Mr Adams mean those IRA men
detained in prison for terrorist-related offences, precisely the people
Sir Hugh Annesley insists should not be released early from their jail
sentences. Nor does Sir Hugh consider Private Clegg a prisoner of war.
Sensibly, he believes both Clegg and Karen Reilly, the girl he was
convicted of murdering, to be victims of terrorism. The offence, and it
is a considerable one, is caused by the persistent equation of
terrorists with soldiers. If the IRA or loyalist terrorists believe
themselves to be soldiers they must face the fact that the vast majority
of their victims have been civilians. They are not soldiers, but
murderers. To confuse the two is to pervert truth and damage the best
chance of peace in generations.

WHEN Nigeria will return to civilian and democratic rule is still
anybody's guess, though preliminary negotiations took place this week.
General Abacha, the military ruler who seized power less than two years
ago, is committed to returning it to the people, but what he means by
that is far from clear since it was never clear entirely why he took it
up, except that the man he ousted had not been elected to office
himself. The general has at least conceded the need to have an agreed
plan of action for the return and a constitution which will come into
force with it. He has, however, not managed to inject any sense of
urgency into the constitutional conference which is considering this
strategy at his command. It is several months behind schedule and could
easily become a semi-permanent feature of the political landscape. It
enjoys no authority, little public respect, and is entirely under the
thumb of the Army, which General Abacha heads.
The original source of contention was the outcome of the country's
1993 presidential election. It had been sanctioned by General Babangida,
General Abacha's predecessor. Like every nationwide Nigerian process,
including censuses, the outcome of the election was hotly disputed, but
most outside observers, as well as most Nigerians, seemed content with
awarding victory to Moshood Abiola, a millionaire businessman. General
Babangida could simply not accept that outcome and, carrying his
officers with him, replaced Mr Abiola with another business figure,
Ernest Shonekan. It was he who was rejected in turn by General Abacha,
who did not want Mr Abiola either. Mr Abiola is in jail (where he is
thought to be ill) charged with treason for declaring the presidential
result to be what it appeared to be, his own election. General Abacha
was able to crush weeks of demonstration and disturbance as well as a
strike in the country's vital oil industry.
His actions have paralysed the political process. The Army simply runs
things: it is the decisive force in the country's political life, having
been more in power than elected governments since 1960. Yet a succession
of army leaders which included General Babangida, and may even include
General Abacha, has been forced to admit that military men are far from
adept at managing public affairs, especially where these are affected by
a widely fluctuating public opinion rather than a predictable and
controllable command structure. Just possibly the Army, and certainly
some of its middle-ranking officers, have become too accustomed to a
governmental role that they have abandoned their quite different
function. This week's negotiations, with representatives of the main
opposition grouping, were secret, and spokesmen for the Government would
not discuss them. Some concessions were offered but the main aim, Mr
Abiola's release, remains distant. A straightforward way out would
decree new parliamentary and presidential elections freeing Mr Abiola to
contest them. The elected body could become a constituent assembly with
an elected president. It may not the best solution but it would be an
improvement on the present position by bringing Government back to the
popular vote and putting the Army back in barracks.

FEW of us, receiving even a parking ticket, do not toy with the idea
of conducting our own defence. ''As a legal precedent, Your Honour, we
offer a Perry Mason case, repeated on television recently, in which . .
.'' Such thoughts may not have been in the mind of Mr Graham Gregory
when he rose in Colchester County Court last week to defend himself
against a #6000 judgment over an unpaid bill, but he undoubtedly wished
to sparkle. Just as he began to speak, however, the sound of loud canine
snoring came from under the judge's bench, and continued until the
hearing was ended. Judge Nicholas Brandt then snapped his fingers, and
left the court with his 12-year-old springer spaniel Barty.
''I was completely distracted,'' said Mr Graham. ''It was like
something out of Monty Python.'' He is considering an appeal, and wants
the judgment to be set aside. As Judge Brandt explained to his local
paper, however, if the dog were left in a nearby room, where it could
still hear his voice, it tended to howl and whine. It is difficult not
to feel sympathy for both sides. No animal lover could resent a dog
accompanying its master. Legal historians would also point out that Mr
Graham was lucky in being able to criticise a court at all. In Scotland,
until it was abolished in 1973, the murmuring of a judge was a serious
offence, and this would certainly have included disparaging his dog, or
likening his court to a flying circus.
In such circumstances, only the most professional of advocates are
able to retaliate. In Ireland, where most lawyers once owned dogs, it
was quite common for them to accompany judges to court. During one High
Court trial in Dublin, the lawyer John Philpot Curran began putting
forward a long and complicated legal argument, at which the judge bent
down and began ostentatiously to pat his pet, clearly implying that the
plea was not worth attention. Curran stopped speaking, at which the
judge looked up. ''I beg pardon, my lord,'' said Curran. ''I thought
your lordships were in consultation.''

STEPHEN McGINTY provides a winning 'systems analysis' on losing
lottery formulas which have -- so far -- failed to fulfil the ultimate
fantasy
ALTHOUGH there are millions of different ways of picking six numbers
between one and 49, National Lottery punters prefer just a few --
birthdays being the most popular.
It is as if we think Lady Luck will favour us by right of birth --
like our entry date is the combination that will crack the code and
drown us in pounds.
The cause is a flood of arrogance or a dearth of imagination. We
either look around the shop queue thinking 'what fools', safe in the
nonsense knowlege that we hold the only Wonka bar with the gold ticket.
Or else, we are stuck with the pen poised thinking what comes after 42?
Forty two! Don't you get it? If that's the answer to the question of
life, the universe and everything, in the lottery it must mean
something.
It did to Douglas Adams, now what is his date of birth? What year did
the series start on the radio?
Others dismiss birthdays with logic, restricting themselves to the
higher numbers above 31 in the belief that, if they win the jackpot,
they'll just be damned if they have to share it with someone whose
parents also decided that there was nothing on television.
It's all right saying: ''What a coincidence,' in a bus queue -- but
it's a different matter handing them hundreds of thousands of pounds.
It's the familiar we feel comfortable with, like vital statistics and
house numbers, army dog tags or revered satirist Peter Cook's date of
death, but these are all random.
What about a system? There are lucky star numbers, arithmetic
averages, the mystic chart of the alphabet, lucky banknotes.
In Ellin Dodge's book, Win The Lottery, the former model and
grandmother urges us to remember that numerology traces it's origins to
cavemen.
As four sticks made a fire, the number four must be dependable. One
physicist urged people to pick numbers which add up to 135 or 185.
A mathematician devised a system called 'wheeling' which involved
picking numbers from a limited set and buying multiple lottery numbers
to cover all the combinations.
And then there's the Monte Carlo fallacy, the simple assumption that,
if you continue to lose, then, eventually, you will win -- when each
person buying a ticket is just as likely to lose every time they enter.
But we assume there must be a pattern in the sand, Leslie Haynes does,
and the 70-year-old retired auctioneer from Greenock has spend nine-hour
days ''footering'' on his IBM and analysing past lottery numbers. Now
that there have been 10 draws, he believes the data exists to narrow our
selection.
The numbers three, five, six, 16, 17, 31, 32, 38, are hot, having all
appeared three times in previous draws. The numbers 30, 44 could be
red-hot as they've appeared four times.
Cold numbers such as one, eight, 18, 19, 24, 33, 34, 41 and 45 haven't
yet been picked.
''All I have done is write a simple programme that will analysis the
numbers that the computer has picked. The results are indicated that it
is favouring some numbers more than others,'' he said.
''After 10 draws, what amounts to 70 numbers have been drawn. If it
was completely even-handed, you would expect it would have picked all 49
numbers.''
Mr Haynes believes that, to increase the chances of collecting a #10
prize, the numbers should be picked one from each section of 10 -- i.e.
pick a number from between one to nine, then from 10-19 and so on. The
bonus number he favours this week is from the range 29-39.
His wife Mary isn't interested. She prefers using her sons' birthdays,
and she's already won a tenner.
Mr Haynes is yet to find success with his system, but is betting that
it's just a matter of time. He is not alone in using microchip
technology in 'boosting the odds.'
Prior to the November launch, a computer company released a software
programme called Lotto Factory which, at #89.50, gave you little more
chance than if you spend the money on tickets.
Declan Diver is a lecturer in the department of Physics and Astronomy
at Glasgow University. He said: ''It's random. Analysing past numbers
will do absolutely no good because one weeks draw is completely
unrelated to the following week. If there was a pattern what, you would
have to ask yourself, is influencing it?
''The only way that numbers would appear would be if certain balls
were heavier than others. And that isn't the case.''
Also, to assume a pattern is to assume a personality which can
generate a pattern which can be interpreted. Have you ever tried holding
a conversation with 49 rubber balls rattling round a overgrown spin
dryer?
For style, however, the winner in true lottery legend style must be
American Peter Mandel who won $27 in the Virginia state lottery.
Success was achieved by investing seven-million dollars and employing
a team of ticket buyers who covered every possible option.
But then that isn't manipulating chance -- it is eliminating it!

NEXT Friday the Jauncey Brothers, those talented musical sons of Lord
Jauncey by Lady Polwarth, his first wife, will be providing midwinter
therapy for those who want to shake off the February blues. The dancing
is to take place at Meikleour Village Hall in Perthshire, the dress is
informal, and the tickets are #10 each, bookable in advance, but
available at the door.
Last year Jamie and Simon Jauncey with Gillian Duncan, lead singer,
and Pete Clark on fiddle, provided a similar energetic diversion at
Kirriemuir Town Hall, a splendid occasion. Some 30 or more of those
present had dined beforehand at Meigle with the late Lord Elphinstone
and Lady Elphinstone, and it is a happy memory to treasure of Jamie
Elphinstone, resplendent in his tartan smoking jacket.
Nowadays, Jamie Jauncey is mostly preoccupied with writing the sequel
to his novel, The Mapmaker, published last year by Andre Deutsch, while
Simon is building up a reputation as a commercial photographer. Such has
been the success of their band, however, that they are now popping up at
almost every smart wedding reception or twenty-first party I go to.
Of course, Meikleour village, on the fringe of Lord Lansdowne's
Perthshire estate, is home ground for them, redolent of all those
unforgettable evenings in our youth. Happily, most of the younger
generation seem to share the same enthusiasm for Scottish country
dancing.
Furthermore, one can count on all those long-standing Perthshire/Angus
double-barrels being represented: the Stirling-Airds, the
Stormonth-Darlings, the Ogilvy-Wedderburns and, without doubt, the last
of those inimitable professional gentleman bachelors, Malcolm Gomme
Duncan, without whom any social gathering in Scotland would be
unthinkable.
LADY LUCINDA Mackay, the Earl of Inchcape's artistic sister, tells me
she is having an exhibition of her paintings at the Torrance Gallery in
Edinburgh with a private view next Saturday.
Lucy, who rejected the London Season and defied her family to become
an artist, trained at Edinburgh College of Art. The late Sir Robin
Philipson, at the time president of the Royal Scottish Academy, once
said to me that he considered her one of his most talented pupils.
Unfortunately, being a painter and having an hereditary title, as Earl
Haig has often discovered, means that those who know no better tend to
dismiss you as merely dabbling.
In recent years Lucy has painted portraits of, among others, Lionel
Daiches QC and Lord Dervaird. Her most recent sitter has been Tinsley
Lockhart, whose husband Hugh is the brother of Cranstoun of that Ilk who
lives at Corehouse, that wonderfully romantic house which sits directly
above the Falls of Clyde in Lanarkshire. This current exhibition, Lucy
says, was inspired by her travels in Italy.
WHOOPS! IN my diary last week, I wrote that Lady Kennedy, better known
as the actress Moira Shearer, would be unveiling a stained-glass window
next Thursday in Dunfermline. I now discover that this stained-glass
window, designed by Liz Rowley, is not, in fact, located at the
fourteenth-century Abbot House, but is to be a feature of the splendid
new headquarters of the Dunfermline Building Society. My apologies to
David Smith, the Dunfermline Building Society's handsome chief
executive, who has been such a stalwart supporter of the Abbot House
project.
ALAS, all good things must come to an end. It is now close on three
years since I first began writing this weekend column in The Herald,
confiding the little excitements and encounters of my everyday
existence. Understandably, however, Camperdown has never approved of his
ancient family name appearing in the press on such a regular basis. His
generation, and those from his background, were brought up in the belief
that one's name should only appear in the newspapers on three occasions
-- on one's birth, one's marriage, and on one's death.
Furthermore, what with members of the royal family all so desperately
wanting to climb on to the publicity bandwagon, members of the old
aristocracy are becoming increasingly unnerved. Whereas I find many of
my closest chums going out of their way to feed me gossip, and then
being deeply offended when I don't mention them, by far the greater
proportion have started to avoid me.
Camperdown has insisted I call a halt before my reputation starts to
affect the social acceptability of our children. Besides, it is not as
if we need the money.
Today, therefore, I write as a chastened woman. Thank you all from the
bottom of my heart for the invitations, the poems, and the many letters
of encouragement. If, over the past 36 months, I have brought just a few
of you some entertainment, some enlightenment, and, above all, some
amusement, then it will all have been worthwhile.
I must close now as Camperdown is waiting with Dawkins, our chauffeur,
in the Bentley Mulsanne Turbo, and we will shortly be departing for
London and our little flat in Trollops Mews. In the immediate future I
shall be preoccupied with the arrangements for our daughter Fiona's
forthcoming wedding reception at the House of Lords. In the course of
time, many of you will be able to share this happy occasion with us in
the social pages of Hello, Harpers &amp; Queen, and Tatler, but until then,
goodbye, and God bless you all!

Prices for couture creations unveiled in Paris this week hover around
the #20,000 mark -- but a girl can dream, can't she. Francesca Fearon
reports on designers paying homage to women and their feminity
IN the harsh realities of the modern world, haute couture is a dream
factory of sparkly rocks, exquisite fabrics, delicate beading and
sensuous dresses to fantasise about.
Nowhere is this fantasy more apparent than in the evening wear. Chic,
crisply-tailored suits bring a sense of order to daywear, but at night
the French couturiers escape to a magical world of fragile mousseline
whipped into delicate draping, and liquid satin cut on bias to cling to
every curve. Couture is a homage to women and their feminity.
More than half the designs in every couture collection is devoted to
cocktail and dramatic gala gowns. Designers conjure heavenly sheaths of
satin and stencilled lace that curl sensuously around the hips and pour
to the floor, or gala gowns that make a dramatic entrance.
For impact in their spring collection, Lacroix, Ungaro, Dior, and
Oscar de la Renta at Balmain create tiny encrusted corsets with huge
skirts whisked into bustles and panniers that weave together images of
Gone With the Wind and la belle epoque era. It is only in the couture
ateliers you can find the craftsman who can stitch such luxurious
handwork. Hundreds of hours can be spent on beaded lace embroideries
that artfully decorate a bustier or edge baroque crinoline.
Lacroix and Ungaro are connoisseurs of the art form. Lacroix's
waist-cinching corsets are a patchwork of appliqued lace and delicate
floral beading emerging from a meringue of pastel silk skirts. While
Ungaro beads a wasp waist making it the focal point of a bustled and
bowed ballgown straight out of la belle epoque.
Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel, Valentino and Versace skilfully splice
together satin and chiffon on the bias so they insinuate themselves to
the figure, then trail black lace across the shoulders. At Chanel, lace
and crepe de chine dresses are lightly suspended on ribbons and end in a
flutter of chiffon at the heels. Thousands of black seed pearls --
little pearls of caviar, as Lagerfeld refers to them -- subtley garnish
the dresses to create a luxurious texture. It was an understated effect
he used again to create matelot stripes on embroidered T-shirts. Devoid
of the usual Chanel gimmickry these hour-glass dresses are an apparition
of sensuality.
Yves St Laurent is a master of understated evening glamour with the
smoking suit (a feminine tuxedo look) cited as one of his greatest
achievements. The success of this impeccably chic look dates back to the
seventies when he first put a woman in a man's suit. Over the years he
has honed the look into elegant halter-neck gowns and set a trend which
landed the American designer Ralph Lauren in court for breach of
copyright -- St Lauren received substantial damages.
For spring the couturier has totally reinvented the look, wittily
slipping the jacket to the hips so the dress emerges from its clasp like
a butterfly from a chrysalis. The technique is complex, but couture is
about making dreams come true. However, with prices hovering around the
#20,000, you would soon wake up.

THE row over BBC Scotland's decision not to proceed with a film of the
award-winning novel Swing Hammer Swing flared again yesterday.
Mr Colin Cameron, head of television at BBC Scotland, was incensed by
suggestions his drama department had no clout and was ''utterly
answerable to London''. He dismissed those who voiced criticism as
''whingeing Jocks''.
The latter remark, in particular, has aroused a chorus of disapproval
from some of the best known creative talents in the country.
Among those disturbed by the decision to axe Swing Hammer Swing,
although a script had already been commissioned and completed by Mr
Peter McDougall, was actor Robbie Coltrane.
''I was stunned when I learned that the film was not going to be
made,'' he said yesterday. ''If someone with Peter McDougall's past
record, reputation, and talent cannot get his work made by BBC Scotland
then what hope does it hold for the future?
''If the choice is between being a whingeing Jock, or a
sit-in-the-corner-and-do-as-you're-told Jock, or an
I'm-away-to-London-to-make-a-living Jock . . . where does that leave
us?''
Other leading talents in Scottish theatre and television expressed
fears that BBC Scotland's power to make independent decisions of any
consequence had been eroded by the BBC in London.
Last week, award-winning TV writer Trevor Preston, who scripted the
BBC Scotland-produced film The Negotiator and follow-up scripts, was
told the series had been cancelled.
Speaking from America last night, Maurice Roeves, who co-starred with
Brian Cox in the pilot film, said: ''One wonders what Scotland has to
produce to be recognised.
''It seems as if London doesn't expect us to produce good stuff -- and
when we do they don't like it.
''I had great hopes for The Negotiator. It had a good team and a good
story. I thought they were looking to fill the Taggart spot.
''To buy a book like Swing Hammer Swing and then not make it sounds
like crass stupidity.''
One reason given by Mr Cameron for not making Swing Hammer Swing was
that the BBC was now looking for ''more contemporary original drama''.
''To purchase the rights to a book set in the sixties and then say
they don't want to make it because it is set in the sixties, doesn't
make sense,'' Mr Roeves said.
''I don't know what goes on in their heads. I don't know if anything
goes on in their heads.''
Other Scottish actors, writers, directors, and technicians are
seriously concerned about BBC Scotland's loss of autonomy. However, they
say fear of being ruled out from any future BBC employment prevents them
from speaking out publicly.
In response to opinions voiced in The Herald last Saturday, Mr Cameron
claimed that under his new head of drama, Ms Andrea Calderwood, BBC
Scotland has quadrupled its output and criticism ''simply confirms
everyone's view of Scots as whingeing Jocks''.
He explained that the #1.6m budget for Swing Hammer Swing was too high
and the BBC was looking for more drama of a more contemporary nature.

<HEADLINE>Woman tells of anguish as judge rules that case over forceps birth is time-barred after 18 years Mother's action over death of baby dismissed</HEADLINE>

A WOMAN who -- in a case which made Scottish legal history -- tried to
sue a health board after the death of her newly-born son 18 years ago,
spoke last night of her anguish after her action was dismissed. A judge
ruled that the case was time-barred.
Mrs Audrey Hamilton said: ''I have never had a satisfactory
explanation about the death of my child, and I cannot have another in
the future.''
Mrs Hamilton went to the Court of Session in Edinburgh to sue Fife
Health Board for #100,000 damages after the death of her son David, who
was born in August 1976.
Mrs Hamilton, of Kennoway Road, Windygates, in Fife, sued the board
for #80,0000 stemming from injuries she received during the birth by
forceps delivery and a further #20,000 for the loss of her son.
The baby's father and Mrs Hamilton's former husband, Mr John Watson,
of Simpson Court, Crail, in Fife, also claimed #20,000 damages over the
death.
The case first made news in 1991 when Lord Prosser rejected the
parents' damages claim against the health board. He ruled that an unborn
baby was not a person in terms of the relevant legislation.
Lord Prosser's ruling was subsequently overturned by three appeal
judges who said that an action could proceed on the basis of injuries
inflicted before birth which had a continuing affect on the child.
The case returned to court after Fife Health Board claimed that the
action for personal injuries and over the death of the child should be
dismissed as time-barred.
The normal time-bar for bringing a case of this kind is three years,
but a judge can exercise his discretion to allow it to go ahead.
However, in a written judgment issued yesterday, temporary judge Mr
Gordon Coutts, QC, said he did not consider it fair to allow the action
to proceed after the lapse of time.
Mrs Hamilton, 37, who works as a laboratory technician for the health
board, said at her home last night she was distraught at the outcome for
two reasons.
First, she felt she had never received a satisfactory explanation for
the death of her child.
The second reason was that she had had to have a hysterectomy last
summer, and could never have a child again.
Mrs Hamilton said: ''I started this seven years ago, and I regret that
it has taken so long.
''I understand that the courts cannot always accept the situation of
litigants, but I felt that in my case, it was ongoing because I was
still attending hospital at the time.''
Mrs Hamilton said that because the case was the first of its kind in
Scotland, she had hoped a successful outcome might have had
ramifications for other women in the future.
She said: '''It is the end of the line, and we have to get on with our
lives.''
Temporary judge Mr Coutts was told that Mrs Hamilton was 18 when her
son David was born at Craigtoun Maternity Hospital, in St Andrews, in
August 1976.
The child was delivered by forceps but died three days after birth
after a cut and cranial haemorrhage. The baby also showed signs of
severe asphyxia.
Mrs Hamilton said that at a 1987 consultation she was told she would
never be able to have children.
She claimed that it was not until that consultation that she became
aware that her contraction of chronic pelvic inflammatory disease was
attributable to the injuries sustained in the course of the birth of the
baby.
Mr Coutts said he was satisfied that Mrs Hamilton and her family were
''actively considering'' a claim against the health board in 1976 and
1977.
He said in his written judgment: ''They were plainly of the view that
there had been negligence on the part of specified doctors. The
solicitor instructed by them had gone to the extent of obtaining a
factual report and a death certificate and had spoken to them about
pursuing matters but nothing was done.''
The present action was raised in May 1989.
Mr Coutts said that after the lapse of time, he did not consider it
fair to allow the action to proceed. ''The doctors blamed would have had
no reason to believe that their conduct would be called in question
after 1979 and it appears to me that there is an unfairness to them in
allowing that to be done so long after the events.''

SAFEWAY poison case accused Dr Paul Agutter told a turnkey that he was
guilty and felt no remorse, it was alleged yesterday.
Dr Agutter made his confession after being beaten up in the cells by
fellow- prisoners, a jury was told at the High Court in Edinurgh.
Mr David Hill, a turnkey in the cell complex at the sheriff court,
said that after his arrest Dr Agutter had been placed in a cell along
with five other prisoners waiting to appear before the sheriff on
September 6 last year. At that time, he was uninjured.
Later, he saw Dr Agutter sitting on a bench, holding a handkerchief to
his mouth, which had a trickle of blood coming from it. He also had a
shadow, like a bruise, under one of his eyes.
Mr Hill said he took the accused from the cell so that he could be
placed in a cell on his own. ''As I was taking him out, he said he was
guilty and had no remorse. He did not want any charges against people in
the cell. He had no resentment towards them.''
Mr Hill admitted he had not taken a note of what Dr Agutter had said,
but insisted that he remembered the exact words used by him as ''I am
guilty and have no remorse''.
Mr Neil Murray, QC, defence counsel, suggested to the turnkey that
what Dr Agutter had actually said was that if the people who had beaten
him up in the cells genuinely believed he was guilty of the poisoning
charges, they were justified in what they had done and he did not want
proceedings taken against them.
Mr Hill said that Mr Murray would be ''quite wrong'' in suggesting
that.
Asked about the manner in which Dr Agutter had spoken, Mr Hill
replied: ''It was said very pitifully.''
Dr Agutter, 48, denies trying to murder his wife Alex, 39, by
poisoning her gin and tonic with atropine at their home in
Athelstaneford, East Lothian, on August 28 last year. He also denies
putting bottles contaminated with atropine on the shelves of Safeway at
Swanston in Edinburgh on August 24.
The jury also heard details of a taped interview between Dr Agutter
and detectives at Haddington police station on September 5, during which
he was accused of ''acting'' and of breaking down without shedding a
single tear.
Dr Agutter told police he had poured his wife a gin and tonic on the
evening of Sunday, August 28. The tonic came from a bottle he had bought
at Safeway the previous Wednesday and which had a broken seal.
He had drunk a tonic from the remains of an old bottle which he hadn't
wished to give to his wife because it was flat.
After he explained that he had opened the bottle with the broken seal
first because he was frightened it would go flat, he was asked: ''You do
appreciate how illogical what you're saying is?''
''It sounds absolutely ridiculous, doesn't it?'' replied Dr Agutter.
''Yes, I appreciate just how it must sound.''
At one point in the tape, Detective Inspector William Manson said:
''Can I just say to clarify things, you've broken down on two or three
oaccasions. I've not seen a single tear yet.''
He was then asked about different levels of atropine found in the
bottle of tonic he had bought at Safeway and in the drink he had poured
for his wife.
Dr Agutter, a lecturer in biochemistry at Edinburgh's Napier
University, said he would have anticipated the concentration levels to
be very similar.
Asked for his reaction if tests showed the concentration of atropine
in his wife's gin and tonic was ''much, much higher,'' Dr Agutter
replied: ''My first question has to be, how certain are you of that
result?''
Detective Chief Inspector Brian Doneghan then put it to the accused:
''Doctor, you really should think less about the acting and more about
just telling what really happened. How about the truth doctor, that's
all we're really interested in.''
The DCI added: ''We're suggesting that you contaminated your wife's
gin and tonic with atropine . . . and you contaminated the other bottles
to cover that action.''
After a pause, DCI Doneghan added: ''I don't hear any denials
doctor.''
Dr Agutter replied: ''I did not do it. I did not do that.''
He then agreed that his marriage was unhappy and added: ''I understand
exactly why you are so convinced that I'm guilty. Am I right in thinking
that you suppose me to have been trying to poison my wife?''
DI Manson replied: ''Without any other explanation that we can only
get from yourself, yes.''
Dr Agutter said: ''I'm going to be stuck for another explanation but,
point number one, a divorce is certainly on the cards. I'm quite happy
to go through that.''
The trial continues.

<HEADLINE>Adams voices support for release of Private Clegg</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>980140220</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SINN Fein leader Gerry Adams yesterday backed calls for the release of
Lee Clegg, the paratrooper jailed for murdering a girl during a
joy-riding shooting incident in Belfast.
Mr Adams, in Dublin for his first formal talks with new Irish Prime
Minister John Bruton, said the campaign to free 26-year-old Clegg
''proves once again that there is no justice for Irish people, but it is
OK for a paratrooper to kill an Irish citizen''.
However, he added: ''We think it is time to release all prisoners,
including Clegg.''
Mr Adams said the mounting of a campaign on Clegg's behalf in a few
short weeks contrasted sharply with the lack of media attention on the
issue of Irish prisoners.
Mr Adams added that the remarks by Royal Ulster Constabulary Chief
Constable Sir Hugh Annesley that no recently-jailed prisoners should be
released had been ''negative''.
Sir Hugh said yesterday it was ''inconceivable'' that paramilitary
prisoners convicted of terrorist outrages could be released early from
jail.
The RUC would have its say in any proper debate on prisoners, but the
time was not yet right for a proper discussion on the early release of
inmates. Long and careful thought would have to be given to victims and
families.
In the second part of an interview published yesterday, in the mainly
nationalist Belfast-based Irish News, the chief constable said he did
not really think early release was an issue.
''It is inconceivable that those responsible for Greysteel, Teebane,
Lower Ormeau Road, or Loughinisland should be released''.
Sir Hugh said he saw Private Lee Clegg and Karen Reilly -- the
teenager he was convicted of murdering -- as both victims of terrorism.
He was sorry that a soldier who did not go out to do any harm while on
duty, found himself in the position he was in.
However, he pointed out that Private Clegg had been convicted by three
different courts.
Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuinness, asked about Sir Hugh's comments as
he arrived at the Irish embassy in London ysterday, said: ''It's
inconceivable that prisoners of war should not be released at the end of
the conflict, and I think in his heart of hearts Hugh Annesley knows
that.''
As Mr McGuinness continued a three-day visit to Britain to press the
Government for a start to all-party peace talks, Mr Adams led a
four-strong Sinn Fein delegation to Dublin's Government Buildings for
discussions with Mr Bruton and deputy premier and Foreign Minister Dick
Spring.
His previous meetings with Mr Bruton, who took over as head of a new
coalition government in Dublin last month, had been restricted to brief
occasions with little chance for substantive exchanges.
The meeting was expected to concentrate on the progress of continuing
efforts by the British and Irish governments to draft a framework
document to permit fresh inter-party talks in Northern Ireland.
Ministerial talks in London on Wednesday between Mr Spring and Ulster
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew failed to make an anticipated breakthrough
towards completing the document.
Irish opposition leader Bertie Ahern yesterday asked to be up-dated on
the bid to find a framework for a new political dialogue in Northern
Ireland.
Mr Ahern, the Fianna Fail party leader, said the move was neccessary
to ensure a bi-partisan approach to the currrent peace process in the
Dail, the Dublin parliament.
Mr Bruton later disclosed he had asked for a report on the Clegg case.
After 90 minutes of talks in Dublin with Mr Adams, Mr Bruton made no
further comment on the Clegg affair, or the campaign to free him.
He said his meeting with Mr Adams and other Sinn Feins leaders had
been one of a series with the party, adding: ''There will be more as
time goes on.''
Mr Adams said it had been a good meeting, which demonstrated the
commitment of the Irish Governnment to the Northern Ireland peace
process.
He added: ''We took the opportunity to express our concern on a number
of issues and presented a detailed assessment about the on-going
situation.''
Mr Bruton, asked about an apparent lack of progress by the British and
Irish governments towards completion of a framework document for fresh
political dialogue in Northern Ireland, said only that he would be
getting a full report from Mr Spring about his discussions in London
with Sir Patrick.

AN IRA bomber was jailed for 25 years yesterday for causing the
explosion which resulted in the ''wanton slaughter'' of nine people in a
Shankill Road fish shop.
At Belfast Crown Court, Lord Justice MacDermott also gave Sean Kelly,
21 -- who refused to get to his feet as he was sentenced -- nine life
sentences, one for each of the people killed in the attack.
However, after hearing the sentence, angry relatives of those killed
in the bombing left court feeling they had not seen justice.
The judge, who told Kelly that the victims of the atrocity must never
be forgotten, said: ''The wanton slaughter of so many innocent people
must rank as one of the most outrageous atrocities endured by the people
of this province in the last quarter of a century.''
Kelly was one of two IRA men in a hijacked car, disguised as meat
delivery men, who walked into Frizzell's fishmongers on Belfast's
Shankill Road in October 1993.
As his accomplice, Thomas Begley, 21 -- who was mutilated beyond
recognition in the blast -- was about to hang a 5lb bomb on a meat hook
above a refrigeration unit at the back of the shop, the device went off.
It killed Begley, the shop owner, his daughter, five customers -- one a
seven-year-old girl -- and two people who had been standing outside the
shop.
Kelly, a near neighbour of Begley's, from Brompton Park in the
neighbouring district of Ardoyne, was blown into the street and found as
he struggled to get to his feet. The shop and the floors above were
demolished.
During the trial he refused to recognise the court and put forward no
defence after the Crown had made its opening remarks. He never spoke
throughout, but is understood to have told friends: ''It was a mistake.
It was not meant to happen.''
The victims of the explosion were: Michelle Baird, aged seven; her
mother Ms Evelyn Baird, 27, and her father Mr Michael Morrison, 27;
Leanne Murray, 13; Mr George Williamson, 63, and his wife Gillian, 49;
Ms Wilma McKee, 38; Ms Sharon McBride, 29, and her father Mr John
Frizzell, the 63-year-old shop owner. Fifty-eight people were treated
for injuries.
The trial, two weeks ago, lasted just hours. Kelly, heavily scarred
from injuries received in the explosion in which he lost his left eye,
sat pale-faced and expressionless as the judge delivered his verdict.
Wearing a pale grey sweatshirt, he refused to stand when ordered to do
so when the judge began his judgment.
As he was led from the dock, one relative screamed from the public
gallery: ''I hope you die in prison, you bastard.''
The judge told Kelly it was clear the device was intended to kill and
seriously injure people in the vicinity of the shop, which was below
former offices used by the Protestant paramilitary Ulster Defence
Association.
He said: ''The cold facts of this case make clear the awfulness of
what you did. Nine innocent people were killed. Families and friends
have been subjected to lasting anguish. The suffering of the victims of
this atrocity must, of course, never be forgotten.''
Kelly's jail sentence is five years more than he anticipated. While in
hospital recovering from his injuries, he told staff he would get 20
years. He told them: ''I'll do my time in Long Kesh. I'll say nothing.''
Speaking for the victims' relatives, Mr Charles Butler, an uncle of
Michelle Baird, said: ''We came here expecting and wanting justice for
the nine murdered in the Shankill Road, and we believe we haven't got
it.
''He took nine innocent lives and he is going to serve just over 14
months per life.
''When the Republican movement says it doesn't get British justice, I
think it got more than its fair share today -- we don't think we got
it.''
Mr Butler said the Republican movement had spoken about apologising
for the deaths over the past 25 years.
''We didn't hear Sean Kelly apologise or show any remorse, but we
didn't really expect it,'' he added.
Ms April Brown, sister of Mr Morrison who died with his girlfriend and
their daughter, said Kelly should serve his entire life in prison.
''The sentence is a disgrace -- he should serve his whole lifetime in
prison. I would love to see hanging brought back. I would be there in
the front row.''

From DAVID STAMP
Oswiecim, Friday
A VICTIM of Nazi Germany's perverted medical experiments walked arm in
arm with a former Auschwitz doctor into the death camp's gas chamber
today and publicly forgave her tormenters.
Mrs Eva Mozes Kor, 70, an identical twin who underwent experiments
conducted by Dr Josef Mengele, the Angel of Death, declared a personal
amnesty for all Nazi criminals.
It was a rare, if not unprecedented, display of Jewish forgiveness for
their Second World War persecutors.
Mrs Mozes Kor, who was transported to Auschwitz from Romania in 1944,
chose the 50th anniversary of the camp's liberation to make the gesture
with former Waffen SS doctor Hans Muench, one of a group of German
physicians who experimented on Jews there.
She issued a written ''Declaration of Amnesty'' to Nazi war criminals
and said that gave her relief from half a century of torment. ''I am
relieving myself from pain. It is gone, it is healed,'' she told
reporters after signing the declaration.
''I am letting them off. I am not going to bother with what happened
50 years ago. I can't. I have to get on with my life. I have to let go
of that pain. I am doing it more for myself than for them.''
Mrs Mozes Kor, who lives in the US, had sought out Mr Muench, 84, who
conducted experiments in bacteriology at Auschwitz, and lives near the
Bavarian town of Fuessen.
He was tried in Poland after the war, but was acquitted after inmates
testified that he had tried to save them from starvation and the gas
chambers.
The two walked slowly under the camp entrance gate which perversely
proclaims Arbeit macht frei -- Work makes you free -- and passed the
barbed wire fences and barrack blocks where Jews and other enemies of
Hitler's Third Reich were imprisoned.
Mrs Mozes Kor took Mr Muench's arm and together they walked into the
dank gas chamber, the most infamous instrument in the Nazi plan to wipe
out European Jewry.
Mrs Mozes Kor, who lost her parents and two elder sisters in
Auschwitz, admitted she was alone among Jews in forgiving the Nazis for
their crimes. ''I am strictly on my own,'' she said.--Reuter

THE Royal Bank of Scotland confirmed yesterday that it plans to create
400 jobs in the Greenock area by establishing a new mortgage
administration centre.
Bank officials said the move followed major growth in its mortage
business in recent years, and a wish to improve the quality of service.
Work currently done within the branch network will be transferred to
the centre, but there will be no redundancies.
The announcement received an enthusiastic welcome in Greenock, which
has been badly hit by the run-down of heavy engineering and suffers
large-scale unemployment.
Inverclyde Provost Allan Robertson said he was delighted at the
prospect of attracting 400 quality jobs to the area.
''It is a clear indication that the work being done by various
agencies to attract employment to Inverclyde is starting to bear
fruit.''
Renfrewshire Enterprise, which was involved in the negotiations to
locate the centre in Greenock, said in a statement: ''It is obviously a
major boost for the area to have a financial base such as the Royal
Bank.''
A pilot team of 40 staff has established a temporary base in offices
on the town's waterfront, which is the focus for a #60m development by
the private and public sectors.
However, a bank spokesman said negotiations about a permanent site in
the Greenock area had not yet been completed. The town had been chosen
for its excellent communications, substantial labour market, training
facilities, and the financial package available for inward investment.
''The new centre will centralise and speed up our mortgage service,
while allowing our branch staff to concentrate further on their
relationships with customers,'' added the spokesman.
Recruitment is expected to begin soon, with the workforce expanding to
400 as the bank's mortgage business continues to grow. It increased by
about 25% last year, and the Royal is now firmly established as a major
UK lender, with mortgage loans totalling about #5000m.

THE tragic deaths of 23 Britons in the Waco compound of the Branch
Davidians in Texas had to be laid at the door of the fanatical cult
leader David Koresh, a coroner said yesterday.
Manchester coroner Leonard Gorodkin said despite the action by the FBI
outside the Mount Carmel ranch, self-styled Messiah Koresh could have
saved those inside.
At the end of a five-day inquest, the coroner recorded open verdicts
on all the Britons except one -- six-year-old Melissa Morrison from
Manchester who, he said, had been unlawfully killed because her age
meant she could not possibly have consented to what was happening.
Mr Gorodkin told the court, packed with relatives of the dead, that by
the final raid on the compound on April 19, 1993, at the end of a 51-day
siege, Koresh had possibly decided his death was coming.
''I believe all the deaths that occurred on April 19 were his decision
and must be laid at his door, and despite what went on outside he could
have saved them.
''It was as a result of his personality and his hold over those people
that they died on that day,'' he said.
He said the building had been set fire to deliberately during the FBI
tank and gas assault at the end of the siege.
''I believe it would be distorting the facts to consider any reason
other than the intention was to burn down the building and everyone
inside it,'' said Mr Gorodkin.
''I firmly believe only one person could have made that decision to
set fire and burn the building and the people and that was David Koresh.
Mr Gorodkin said the raid on February 28 by the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms had been shown to be ''badly planned, ill conceived
and doomed to failure''.
He also spoke of ''bullying tactics'' during the siege that followed
and what was a ''simplistic'' plan by the FBI to end it.
He said all families of the deceased had said they were not the sort
to contemplate suicide.
''However, we do hear of mass suicides and who knows what people will
do when they are under the mental influence of a man like David
Koresh?''
The open verdicts included those on brothers Phillip and Stephen
Henry, from Manchester who both had gunshot wounds, although they were
alive when the fire started.
In the case of Winston Blake, 27, from Nottingham, who was shot at
close range with a high velocity weapon on the day of the initial raid,
there also had to be an open verdict. It was impossible to say how any
of these events had happened.
The inquest had heard earlier that all the other victims died from the
effects of inhaling smoke as the compound turned into an inferno.
The American lawyer representing 19 of the UK victims of Waco and five
survivors said the real work would begin on his $500m claim against the
US authorities after yesterday's verdicts.
Attorney Kirk Lyons said: ''We have a hell of a lot of work ahead of
us.
''I consider the end of this inquest as the beginning of our inquiry,
because obviously with all these open verdicts there are many questions
and information which is not available to the investigation team and to
the coroner that need to be addressed, and will have to be answered by a
judge and jury in the USA.''
Relatives of the victims had mixed views after hearing the verdicts.
Robert Fagan, whose mother Doris, 60, and sister Yvette, from
Nottingham, died in the tragedy, said: ''I am fairly happy with the
verdict. In my own mind, I am sure it was not a suicide pact.''
The twin brother of victim Livingstone Malcolm, said the FBI had
played into Koresh's hands.
Solomon Malcolm said: ''The blame is on the United States authorities
for starting the siege and ending it.''
Paul Horslen, brother-in-law of Winston Blake, said: ''We came here to
find out who shot Winston and why.
''We still haven't answered those questions, and at the end of the day
now we just can't rest until somehow we've found out who is responsible
and made them answer to the law.''
Geoffrey Sellors, father of victim Cliff Sellors, said: ''We would
still like to see justice done. They were forced into that situation in
that camp and we are hoping for a Congressional hearing on the matter.''

<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday accused the Conservatives of embarking on a vendetta
against Tony Blair's family after a right-wing organisation urged the
Bar Council to investigate his barrister wife, Cherie.
The Freedom Association wrote to the Bar Council asking them to look
into allegations that Mrs Blair, also known by her maiden name of Booth,
had taken on a pupil called Mr Buster Cox.
He is the son of former London Weekend Television director Barry Cox,
who raised more than #70,000 for Mr Blair's leadership campaign.
The association's chairman, Mr Norris McWhirter, claimed Ms Booth has
violated the Bar's code of conduct and equality code for chambers which
lay down guidelines for fair admission of pupils.
He also alleged Ms Booth's chambers require pupils to have an
excellent academic record and all pupils were vetted by a pupillage
committee.
Mr Cox's qualifications were unknown to him, he said, but he had not
been considered by the pupillage committee.
He asked the Bar Council to probe a matter which ''risks bringing the
Bar into disrepute''.
Labour reacted angrily to the renewal of allegations first raised last
Autumn.
A spokeswoman said: ''It's clear the Tory party is embarking on a
strategy of attacking Tony Blair's family.''
A statement from Mr Blair's office said Mr Cox was not employed by Ms
Booth's chambers but directly by her as part of his continuing law
training.
''This is a private arrangement, separate from the pupil scheme run by
Ms Booth's chambers and Mr Cox draws no remuneration from chambers.
''He will not remain with Ms Booth when his six-month stint expires.
''As a self-employed barrister, Ms Booth is fully entitled to employ
whomsoever she likes. She has acted with complete propriety and any
suggestion otherwise is actionable.''

MANY a letter appeared at the lost porch of the department's letterbox
concerning the enquiry the other week about who wrote Stardust. It was
of course Mitchell and not Maxwell Parish.
The lost porches reference is to a poem by an American poet who
appeared, to some effect, on British telly the other week. Who he? His
chums included Gregory Corso, a chap called Ferlinghetti, and a writer
called Kerouac. The Beeb interviewee has survived them all.
But this is not a quiz. Reader M. Martin, of Martin's Music Dunoon, (a
weel-kent figure on the music scene as he does stringed instrument
repairs), tells me that there is another Maxwell in popular music
history.
''In the late 50's there was a hit called Ebb Tide recorded by a
peculiar character called Jerry Colona. The song is ascribed to a writer
called Robert Maxwell. Some plans take a long time to come to fruition
but, . . . surely not''?
Surely yes, Mr Martin. Jerry Colona sported a handlebar moustache and
obtruding eye-balls. Robert Maxwell was a well-known lyricist and
Broadway producer whose later efforts included Mame, Annie Get Your Gun,
and West Side Story.
The only other song your editor knows he co-wrote was a nifty little
number which Doris Day sang and is oft given a rendition at parties in
the South Side of Glasgow. Please, Please, Don't Eat the Daisies.
It will not bother the first Robert Maxwell for he has been pushing
them up since 1971. The other Maxwell has been more attuned with
seaweed. It is said his death displaced oceans . . . and certainly
pension funds.
But here we have another question which comes out of, shall we say,
the blue? Why are Rangers called The Light Blues, asked J. Sherrif of
Potten End, London. He wants to know because down in London he is
constantly reminded by those cockney sparrers that Glasgow Rangers have
a royal blue strip.
They are called that because Rangers was wont to play a team called
Benburb, now a Junior League team, and that team sported a dark blue
jersey, though they now play in the hue of the big Rangers.
But more footy questions. Asks George Smith of the Elcho Bar,
Strathbungo, Glasgow. ''What football team is mentioned in the Bible?''
Good yin, George. We found out. None other than this blatt's own Jim
Reynolds answered it in seconds.
''Queen of the South,'' quoth he immediately. ''The queen of the south
shall rise up again . . .'' he quoted, and said it came from Matthew 12,
verse 2. Your editor knows this not to be true for Matthew is one of the
most famous and spoken chapters of the New Testament.
It is the origin of the Sabbatarian movement, though it got a bit of
knock-back when it was proved that Jesus was permitted to heal even on a

A CHILD died of thirst after his parents were killed by apparent drug
abuse in their flat, an inquest was told today.
The tragedy is believed to have happened just before Christmas,
although the bodies of the young family, surrounded by Christmas
decorations and presents, were only discovered when the landlord forced
his way into the flat on Wednesday.
Detective Sergeant Philip Welsh told the inquest at Prestatyn, Clwyd,
that the bodies of part-time postman Tony Walker, 28, his wife
Elizabeth, 23, and their 18-month-old son Michael were found in the
lounge of the first-floor flat in Kinmel Street, Rhyl, Clwyd.
''The bodies were in some state of putrefaction and decay, and there
was evidence at the scene of probable drug abuse,'' he said.
''Syringes were scattered about the floor and there were powders and
items we would usually associate with the drugs scene.''
A postmortem on Michael Walker revealed he had died of
cardio-respiratory failure due to dehydration caused by lack of care and
neglect.
Examinations of his parents had proved inconclusive, and Home Office
pathologist Dr Donald Waite had asked for further forensic tests
It was revealed yesterday that the couple were found kneeling side by
side in the flat -- their son lay dead nearby. Det Sgt Welsh said today
that unopened presents and cards were also found in the lounge.
''There was no sign of violence to any of the three bodies involved
and we are not looking for any other person in connection with this,''
he told the inquest. ''Another pointer to us was the fact that the
premises were locked from the inside.''
He said the flat had been in good order apart from some small items
which were out of place. He said: ''I can only assume that the child had
been playing with some items. There were a few toys on the floor.''
Coroner Mr David Jones adjourned the inquest to await a further police
report on the outcome of forensic tests.

CASUALTY services will be retained at Ayr Hospital following a public
outcry over proposals to scrap them which were contained in a health
board discussion document.
While local MPs yesterday welcomed the news they are angry that
Ayrshire and Arran Health Board is now maintaining it had no intention
of withdrawing cover.
The row began last year when it emerged that the health board was
exploring three options for future accident and emergency cover in
Ayrshire -- two of which involved the closure of the new unit at Ayr.
Politicians and the public were incensed and petitions with more than
30,000 signatures were handed in and 133 people responded as part of the
consultation process.
Now the health board has confirmed the status quo -- with fully
equipped A&amp;E units at Ayr and Crosshouse, near Kilmarnock, -- for at
least the next six years.
Dr Drew Walker, director of public health, said: ''The public concern
that arose was unnecessary. It was never, ever, board policy to close
Ayr Hospital's A&amp;E department. The fact is that the board's professional
advisers favoured the status quo.
''I explained then, and I repeat now, that the working group looked at
all three options and a majority, including this board's officers,
believed that the status quo option should be supported. But we also
believed that the public who use the services deserved a say in this
matter and that is why we put the options out to public consultation.''
Mr George Foulkes, many of whose constituents would have been
affected, said he was delighted with the decision.
But he added: ''What I find astounding is the health board's
contention that they never intended any change in cover. Why, then, did
they put forward the options in the first place and cause concern and
upset to patients and staff alike?''

THE last time you saw American musician Joseph Swensen in this neck of
the woods he was probably playing the violin and looking trim. Now he's
dumped the fiddle, grown long hair and a beard, and looks like a refugee
from a heavy metal band. Oh yes, and he's taken up conducting.
And he has to be one of the most exciting talents for years in one of
the most dodgy aspects of the business: hats off, a real conductor.
Advance sales had been high for his appearance with the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra last night. The Siberian weather left the ranks depleted and
the start of the concert was delayed. A shame, because a supercharged
performance of Beethoven's Eroica Symphony provided a blistering finale
to a superb concert. (Same show, Queen's Hall, tonight.)
Swensen is from the whole body school of conducting: he dances,
twirls, sways, minces, stomps his feet -- an extremely well-sprung chap.
And in his musical rhythms too. His Eroica for the most part went like
the wind, and the band played like stars: Swensen was extremely lucky to
have an orchestra that could articulate so well at such speed. The slow
movement was odd, such a massive edifice that it shifted the centre of
gravity of the symphony; but an absorbing interpretation, grippingly
performed.
Another of today's stars, Dutch violinist Isabelle van Keulen, earlier
gave a stunning performance of Mendelssohn's early Violin Concerto (not
the famous one). She tends to rush a bit, but is an enormous talent and
played the engaging finale so characterfully, with such elan, that she
had the audience grinning.
The opener was a gem, Takemitsu's How Slow the Wind, as ravishing as
Debussy, with the precision of a Japanese line drawing.

SCOTTISH councils have gained a six-month reprieve from the Government
over restarting compulsory competitive tendering for services after the
creation of the new single-tier authorities.
But Scottish Secretary Ian Lang warned yesterday the pressure will be
on the new authorities to undertake more extensive market testing.
Mr Lang accused many of the present regional and district councils of
''turning a blind eye'' to alternative ways of providing services.
He told a local government conference in Glasgow he wanted to see the
new authorities looking undogmatically at who could best deliver a
frontline or an internal service.
''Of course in many cases the answer will be their own employees, but
in some it will be another authority or the voluntary sector -- an
under-exploited resource in my opinion, or the private sector. That is
the approach increasingly being adopted in central government,'' he
said.
The public services union Unison dismissed the six-month delay over
CCT as ''a sham'' and claimed new services were to be thrown open
quickly ''to the predators of the private sector''.
Cosla president Rosemary McKenna welcomed the Government's move but
warned the timetable was still too tight and could adversely affect
service delivery.
The process of CCT will be suspended during the changeover to unitary
councils.
Tendering for services already subject to CCT is now to be phased back
in between July 1997 and July 1998 with the planned extension to a range
of white collar sevices beginning in April 1998 and being phased in over
a year.
Cosla had argued for a delay until 1998 for current services and 1999
for the extension.
Addressing the conference jointly organised by the Chartered Institute
of Public Finance and Accountancy and the Society of Local Authority
Chief Executives, Mr Lang stressed the need for increased efficency and
effectiveness in providing council services.
He said the removal of a whole tier of local government was an
opportunity to cut out the wasteful duplication of activities and to
streamline the overall running of the remaining 32 councils.
Delegates were also left in no doubt that there would be no let-up in
the spending squeeze which had left councils warning of hundreds of job
losses and big rises in council tax.
Mr Lang said spending by Scottish councils was already significantly
higher than in England and Wales.
The Government remained determined to continue to reduce the
proportion of the gross national product taken by public spending.

SCOTTISH Labour MPs warned yesterday that Rolls-Royce's decision to
close part of its East Kilbride plant, with the loss of 600 jobs, could
have serious consequences for the company's commercial future.
A group of 14 MPs met union leaders at the factory yesterday to
discuss plans for the campaign against the transfer of the aero-engine
design and research facility to Derby.
Later, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said the proposed
closure at East Kilbride could affect Rolls-Royce's development of new
engines, especially in its partnership with BMW in Germany.
''Our message to the Rolls-Royce board is that closing down can mean
slowing down for the competitive position of the whole company. They are
taking a risk, and I think they know it,'' he said.
''In the field of aero-engines, commercial relationships are
absolutely pivotal. Goodwill could well be destroyed by the precipitate
closure of this centre of excellence.''
Mr Graham Irvine, senior works steward, welcomed the presence of so
many MPs at yesterday's talks, and the support they had given to the
staff.
East Kilbride MP Adam Ingram said he expected widespread backing for
next week's lobby of Parliament, which will be attended by MPs and
workers from Rolls-Royce factories across the UK.

THERE appeared to be more than a hint of irony in the visit to New
Lanark yesterday of the deputy Opposition leader, Mr John Prescott,
coming as Labour's Clause 4 debate about social justice and equality
gathers momentum.
The award-winning heritage village owes much of its success to
socialist entrepreneur Robert Owen, a Welsh mill owner who came to
manage the New Lanark Mills in 1800.
Owen, recognised as a socialist pioneer, introduced many new ideas to
improve the quality of life for his workforce, including free education
and medical care. His operation differed greatly from the majority of
employers at the time.
New Lanark was recognised as a model village in the early nineteenth
century.
Although it went into decline in the early part of this century, with
the last mill closing in 1968, it has been carefully restored, with a
mix of private and public funding from the Government and Europe, and is
now claimed to one of Europe's most prestigious tourist attractions.
Mr Prescott, on a membership recruiting campaign in Scotland
yesterday, denied that he had come to New Lanark in search of Utopia or
that there was a brand of Owenite socialism in the new style Clause 4,
opposed by several Labour MPs and party members in Scotland.
Accompanied by Clydesdale Labour MP Jimmy Hood and other senior
members of the local Labour Party, he said: ''What we say about Clause 4
is living up to the time we live. The time we live at the moment is
looking to the partnership, recognising that the community and the state
have a role to play.
''It was really about all this value for social justice that Owen was
concerned about. It is typical that this Government did not learn the
lessons. We have and we want to see them implemented.''
The deputy leader of the Labour Party would not be drawn on whether
the heritage village was a lesson mostly for capitalists rather than
socialists.
But he did concede that one lesson for capitalists was that they
should look after their workers and treat them decently; another, that
the community still had a role to play.
Mr Prescott also met Labour activists in Edinburgh last night to press
for the amendment modernising Clause 4 and to campaign for his
recruitment drive, which he claimed had doubled the rate of new
membership applications to the party.
He said the new #3 fee for affiliated trade union members, with people
opting to pay this directly from their wages in local authorities was
proving a great success.
At the meeting in Lothian Regional Council chambers he demonstrated
the breadth of new membership by welcoming into the party fold
97-year-old Mrs Mary Finlay, from Prestonfield in Edinburgh, and
17-year-old Emma Clater, from Morningside.
Mrs Finlay said she had been a Labour Parry supporter all her life but
had never taken the plunge and joined.
''It's now time we all did our bit,'' she said. Emma said she had been
studying politics at St Thomas's School and had decided to put this into
practice by joining the Labour Party.

THE Government looks set to steer a more Euro-sceptical course in next
year's negotiations on the future of the European Union.
The Foreign Secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, yesterday ridiculed the idea
that he, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, were ''closet federalists, all the time longing to put
more power into Brussels''.
He and Downing Street dismissed a press report that the Cabinet had
delivered a ''devastating rebuff'' to him on Thursday by rejecting many
of his ideas in a paper suggesting what Britain's stance should be at
the next inter-governmental conference in 1996 on the future of the EU.
Meanwhile, Mr Major faced further problems on Europe when a
controversial report yesterday called for more defence co-operation
among EU states and more majority voting to facilitate quick
decision-making for military action.
With Mr Major sounding ever more hostile to any extension of qualified
majority voting in next year's Maastricht 2 talks, the trend of EU
thinking on defence seems set to worry the Government.
It could also sharpen the fears among Tory Euro-sceptics about greater
EU integration at a time when Mr Major is striving hard to find a
formula for peace within the party.
On a tour of Suffolk yesterday, Mr Major said the Cabinet had
supported the position on Europe he set out in his speech in Leiden last
September. He believed it would bring together all but a very few within
the Conservative Party.
The suggestion that Mr Hurd had been rebuked at Cabinet was ''a
travesty'', Mr Major said.
His Leiden speech was a careful balancing act containing phrases like
''Britain is irrevocably part of Europe but it must be the right sort of
Europe''.
He looked forward to a Europe of ''increasing diversity'' and
continued to reserve Britain's position on issues like monetary union.
Mr Hurd pointed out in a BBC Radio 4 interview that he will chair the
Cabinet committee of 15 which is to prepare a detailed strategy position
for the 1996 summit.
The membership, which includes Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, is heavily
weighted with pro-Europeans, although this only reflects the balance in
the Cabinet of 23 as a whole.
Only two Euro-sceptics likely to rock the boat are included, the
Employment Secretary, Mr Michael Portillo, and Welsh Secretary John
Redwood. Two more -- the Social Security Secretary, Mr Peter Lilley, and
the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Jonathan Aitken -- are not
members.
It looks like a committee which will only be as Euro-sceptic as it
feels it has to be to try to keep the party together and seek to
represent Labour as over-enthusiastic federalists.
Mr Hurd did obliquely admit failings in past British tactics when he
said: ''We will have to be very hard headed about British interests at
that conference. This time we want to put forward ideas which would have
an echo across Europe. This time we want allies in Europe and not just
simply sit back and react to theirs.''
Mr Clarke, one of the strongest Cabinet Europeans, did his bit for the
unity attempt by telling a European conference there was not ''the
smallest chance in Hades'' of the UK accepting the Social Chapter.
Labour leader Tony Blair said the reports demonstrated the influence
now being wielded over the Government by the nine Euro-sceptic Tories
without the party Whip.
He said: ''This shows the utter folly of sub-contracting British
foreign policy to a group of rebels who effectively want Britain to
withdraw from Europe which would be disastrous for British interests.
''It is time John Major decided whether he is a party manager or a
Prime Minister. If he is Prime Minister he should lead from the front.''
With a deep rift in his party over Europe, Mr Major's tactics seem to
be to try to draw out the inter-governmental talks and prevent
fundamental decisions on the shape of the EU being taken before the next
General Election which must be held by spring 1997.
The European defence report is the latest discussion paper in the EU's
uncertain quest for a coherent and united defence capability.
The timing is awkward because a common EU defence policy, much sought
after by several EU states including Germany, could conflict with Mr
Major's plans for a pre-eminent British-French role in military matters.
Mr Major and the French Prime Minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, are anxious
to exploit their joint status as Europe's only nuclear powers.
The report -- European Security Policy in the Run-up to 2000 -- was
produced for the European Commission by a group of independent experts,
one of whom said present EU defence policy was as confused as
''mud-wrestling in the dark''.
The group recommended that the EU should urgently centralise planning
and prepare for an intervention force. It pointed to mounting
instability around the borders of the EU's 15 member states who were in
no shape to deal with it effectively through an undeveloped Common
Foreign and Security Policy.
The group said it was vital to create a central defence analysis and
planning agency with a heavyweight political figure at its head, and to
crystallise the links between the Commission, Council of Ministers and
the Western European Union, the embryo defence arm of the EU, as well as
between the WEU and Nato.

STOCKHOLM: A damaged skull, believed to be that of a Viking, indicates
the Nordic raiders carried syphilis. The find suggests the sexually
transmitted disease existed in Europe 400 or 500 years earlier than
previously thought. It was believed to have been carried to Europe from
the Americas by Portuguese and Spanish sailors in the late fifteenth
century. The skull, found about 125 miles north of Stockholm and
apparently dating from around 900AD, will be sent to the United States
for tests.

Tokyo, Friday
FORMER British and allied prisoners of war met a Korean woman who was
forced to serve as a ''comfort woman'' -- sex slave -- to Japanese
troops in a tearful show of solidarity today in the fight for
compensation for their suffering.
''The PoWS wanted to show their solidarity and support for comfort
women generally and also to meet a woman whose courage and strength is
known throughout the world,'' said their lawyer, Mr Martyn Day.
They met 73-year-old Song Shin-do, a Korean-born woman who said that
at 16, she was forced to submit to as many as 50 Japanese troops in one
day in army-run brothels.
''Because of Japan's wartime actions, my health was destroyed and I
lost my hearing,'' she told the allied PoWs through a translator.
''Japan should bow its head low and take responsibility for what it
did,'' she said.
Song has spearheaded moves to get Japan to apologize for forcing as
many as 200,000 young Asian women to provide sexual services for
Japanese troops.
Last December, the administration of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama
agreed to contribute 500 million yen to setting up an foundation for the
women.
However, it avoided offering them compensation and side-stepped the
issue of government responsibility for the sexual slavery.
''It's not a matter of money, but a matter of the heart,'' Song told
the visiting PoWS.
On Monday, the former PoWs plan to bring a case to the Tokyo District
Court claiming $22,000 each in compensation for their terrible suffering
in Japanese camps during World War Two.
In addition to the former British soldiers, groups of ex-PoWs from
Australia, New Zealand and the United States, as well as a group of
British civilians are among a total of around 25,000 people seeking
compensation.
Briton Ann Lewick, interned in a camp in Shanghai for three years as a
teenager, came to represent civilian claimants.
''We feel in our hearts and in our imaginations the torture, physical
and mental, that you endured and continue to suffer,'' she told
Song.--Reuter

European fact-finders flew to the region, one month after the assault

rebel-held suburb which forms the last open route between Grozny's
smashed centre and the rest of Chechnya.

From ANTHONY BARKER
Oswiecim, Friday
DEATH camp survivors, led by Nobel prize winner Elie Wiesel, today
recalled the horror of the mainly Jewish victims dragged away to gas
chambers in Auschwitz and prayed for a world free of violence.
More than 5000 mourners, marking the 50th anniversary of the camp's
liberation by the Soviet army, lit candles for the 1.5 million people
murdered at the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex -- a key link in the Nazi
scheme to wipe out Europe's Jews.
''Listen to the screams of terrified mothers. Listen to the prayers of
anguished old men and women. Listen to the tears of children,'' Wiesel
said in a largely spontaneous address to the crowd at Birkenau, a sister
camp to Auschwitz, where most of the victims were gassed and tossed into
crematoria.
''Look and listen as the victims quietly walk towards dark flames so
gigantic that the planet itself seemed in danger.
''It is true that not all the victims were Jews. But all the Jews were
victims. Now and then we ask ourselves what is the lesson? The lesson, I
believe, is not to yield to hatred, to fight fanaticism, and the
violence and the terror.''
Participants, some with tears rolling down their cheeks, lit candles
along the rusting rail spur that once brought cattle trains packed with
Jews from all over Nazi-occupied Europe to the camp in southern Poland.
All present bowed their heads as five sets of prayers -- Jewish, Roman
Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, and Muslim -- were recited. Israeli
parliament speaker Shevach Weiss, who survived the war after Poles hid
him from the Germans, said the Nazis had turned Europe into ''one big
lake of frozen Jewish blood''.
Heads of national delegations, including about 20 presidents and
monarchs, signed a joint declaration to the peoples of the world calling
for peace.
Some prominent Jews boycotted the official events, saying Polish
authorities had tried to diminish the extent of their suffering by
holding an ecumenical service rather than a predominantly Jewish one.
Jews made up 90% of the victims at Auschwitz but tens of thousands of
Polish Roman Catholics, gypsies, and other groups were also killed.
Polish authorities rejected the Jewish groups' allegations and pledged
to honour all victims.
In Germany, where Chancellor Helmut Kohl this week described Auschwitz
as ''the darkest and most terrible chapter in German history'',
television and newspapers provided coverage of the ceremonies and
accounts of survivors.
French President Francois Mitterrand's office said he had turned down
an invitation to attend because of reservations about the way Poland
organised it. France was represented by Social Affairs Minister Simone
Veil, an Auschwitz survivor.
At Birkenau, snow fell as survivors stood alongside the flags of the
countries whose Jews were deported. A solemn voice intoned a long list
of male and female first names and a siren sounded for three minutes to
honour the dead.
Elderly mourners wore striped clothes similar to camp uniforms and
armbands with numbers like those that were tatooed on inmates' forearms.
Some wore the hated Star of David badges that Jews were forced to pin to
their clothes under Nazi law.
Polish President Lech Walesa, host of the ceremony, said Auschwitz had
destroyed whole nations -- gypsies and Jews. He said it was ''a symbol
but unfortunately not an exception'', adding: ''There are many fields
soaked in the blood of innocent victims. Let this place symbolise all
those cemeteries.''
* The Church of Scotland yesterday said it understood the continued
suffering of the Jews and renewed its commitment to strengthen the good
relations it had with the Jewish community in Scotland.
The Rev. Sheilagh Kesting, secretary of the Kirk's ecumenical affairs
committee, said in a letter to the president of the Jewish
Representative Council in Glasgow: ''As a Church, we will continue to
speak out against the evils of anti-Semitism and racism that continue to
disfigure our humanity.''

A POLICEMAN who was involved in the supply of drugs escaped a prison
sentence yesterday after a judge took the ''quite exceptional'' course
of putting him on community service.
Martin Smith, 19, was a probationer constable with the Tayside force
when drug squad officers carried out a 1am raid on his home and found a
cache of amphetamines.
The drugs were concealed in a toy car on a shelf above the young
policeman's bed.
Smith told police the eight tablets hidden there were Ecstasy, but it
was later discovered they were amphetamine with a purity double the
average rate.
Smith, of Queen's Road, Scone, in Perthshire, resigned from Tayside
Police after his arrest.
He admitted being concerned in the supply of amphetamine in April and
May last year at his home and at clubs in Stirling and Edinburgh when he
appeared in court.
Sentence was deferred in the case until yesterday for the preparation
of a community service assessment when he appeared at the High Court in
Edinburgh before Lord Kirkwood.
Defence counsel, Mr Brian McConnachie, told the court that Smith made
a full confession to police when arrested and indicated a total of about
50 tablets had been involved.
Mr McConnachie said the drug transactions were not done for a profit.
Drugs were passed on to friends of Smith's at cost price.
''His extremely foolish actions have ruined his propsective chosen
career in the police. There is little doubt it has had a considerable
effect on him and his family,'' added the defence counsel.
He urged the judge to treat it as a case in which exceptional leniency
could be exercised.
He added: ''I accept anything other than a custodial sentence would be
exceptional leniency.''
The judge told Smith: ''In the highly unusual circumstances of this
case I have decided a custodial sentence is not necessary.''
Lord Kirkwood said he had taken into account all the information put
before him and added: ''In particular, I take account of your age and
the fact that you are a first offender.''
''I have also taken into account that your proposed career in the
police force has been lost,'' he added.
The judge said he would take the ''quite exceptional course'' of
imposing the maximum 240 hours community service.
However, he warned Smith if he failed to carry out the order or got
into further trouble he would be brought back to court and sentenced for
the drug-dealing.

<HEADLINE>Simpson claims he would 'stop bullet' to save ex-wife</HEADLINE>

Los Angeles, Friday
FORMER American footballer O J Simpson says in a book out today that
he would ''jump in front of a bullet'' to protect the ex-wife he is
accused of killing.
''How could anybody say I killed this woman?'' he writes in the book I
Want to Tell You.
''How can anybody say that? Don't they understand that I'd jump in
front of a bullet for Nicole?''
The sportsman turned film actor is on trial for the double murder of
Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman.
In the book, he expresses sympathy for Goldman's family. ''I feel his
family's hurt and pain but I had nothing to do with his death,'' he
writes. To me he is like the unknown soldier, courageous.''
The book, written with the help of author Lawrence Schiller, was
published with a first printing of 500,000. An audio cassette, with a
subdued-sounding Simpson reading sections of the book, was also released
today.
The publishers denied that the book was timed to coincide with the
opening of his high-profile trial and would not confirm reports that he
had received a #650,000 advance.
The book begins with Simpson claiming his innocence: ''I want to state
unequivocally that I did not commit these horrible crimes. I loved
Nicole.'' He adds: ''I have no doubt that eventually the real killers
will be caught.''
Schiller is reported to have regularly met Simpson in jail to work on
the book, which is intended as a response to the more than 300,000
letters and cards he has received since his arrest.
Simpson's trial was temporarily on hold today as Judge Lance Ito
pondered punishing defence lawyers for what the prosecution decried as
''ambush'' tactics.
The prosecutors are enraged that Simpson's defence is making
references to witnesses they did not know about.
Meanwhile, prosecutor William Hodgman, who was taken to a hospital
with severe chest pains on Wednesday night, was resting comfortably
today and was expected to be released over the weekend. His wife,
Janice, said she expected him to be back in court on Monday.--AP/Reuter

THE Musee D'Orsay in Paris serves fresh baguettes with tempting
fillings; the ice-cream parlour in Washington DC's National Museum of
American History provides the right setting to enjoy a fudge sundae. But
can any of Edinburgh's museums or galleries provide a culinary
experience worth remembering?
The austere elegance of the neo-classical Scottish National Gallery of
Modern Art can easily compete with international galleries. Its Gallery
Cafe, in the basement, is bright and airy, but a bit cluttered when
busy.
I visited at lunchtime. Almost everyone seemed to know the drill --
you can't reserve a table by leaving your belongings on it, so friends
were deposited at tables. This meant most of the good tables by the
large windows overlooking the sculpture garden had gone.
The flow of traffic at the self-service was running smoothly as people
quickly chose from the menu written on a large blackboard. There were
two choices of soup, filled croissants, baked potatoes and five main
meals, in addition to two varieties of quiche and the salad selections.
I opted for chicken noodle soup with ginger. It wasn't a huge bowl,
but the noodles were real noodles, and not pasta, and the ginger gave it
a pleasant sharpness.
Deciding on a main course was difficult. The leek and brie quiche
looked delicious, the ratatouille, bacon and potato pie and tuna stuffed
baked potatoes all sizzled invitingly, but being a fan of Mexican food I
chose the vegetable chilli and taco with rice, which came with a choice
of salad.
I like my chilli very hot, and this was very mild, but the taco which
I had expected to be served on the side was layered through with
vegetables. It gave the dish a new lease of life and an interesting
combination of textures. I would have preferred the salad not to have
been served on the same dish, especially since it was a little too oily.
Dessert is usually the first thing on my mind whenever I eat out. The
carrot cake didn't disappoint -- the cake was moist, the cream cheese
not overburdened with icing sugar, and the freshly grated carrot on top
added to the sweetness.
The friendly service and the choice at the Gallery Cafe were
impressive. I'd expected pre-packed sandwiches and stewed tea, but was
presented with a good selection that was freshly cooked and tasted
great. There was even wine or a bottle of beer to accompany lunch.
The Queen Street Cafe in the Scottish National Portrait gallery offers
a similar choice of food and drink, so it came as no surprise to find
that both operations are run by the same company.
The Queen Street Cafe is much darker than the Gallery Cafe, with decor
reminiscent of a more traditional tearoom. The serving area is smaller,
but there is still a choice of four starters, including two varieties of
soup, four main courses, and a selection of cakes and biscuits.
I kicked off with a warming bowl of creamy leek and ginger soup which
had a smooth flavour. The main courses on offer included spinach and
hazelnut pasta bake, chickpea and mushroom curry, and chicken
parmigiana. I opted for the chicken; the sauce was a little bland, but
the rice was cooked to perfection and the accompanying salad very fresh.
Dessert was a huge piece of caramel shortbread, which melted in the
mouth. The cakes were home-made, and by the look of them by someone who
believes in large portions.
The walls of the City Art Centre Cafe depict Edinburgh in its many
guises, from the Castle to the Festival, so I liked it even before I'd
ordered lunch. There's a good mix of vegetarian and meat dishes on
offer, and all main meals come with two salads.
Deciding to opt for a light lunch, I chose a toastie, but was tempted
by the vegetable curry, spinach quiche, and carrot soup. Mostly you
can't go wrong with a cheese toastie, and this was as good as I've had,
but judging by the relish with which other diners were enjoying their
more substantial lunches, the kitchen hadn't gone wrong with any of them
either.
Dessert was a sumptuous chocolate cheesecake that was very sweet and
possibly mass-produced.
Good cappuccino is hard to find. The City Art Centre's was made with
one of the very hi-tech cappuccino machines now springing up all over
the place. These are intended to measure the correct amount of beans and
froth the milk to the right consistency, so technically it was probably
perfect, but it was neither strong enough nor frothy enough for me.
The emphasis in Edinburgh's galleries was very much on freshness and
choice. Most of those eating in each of the cafes appeared to be loyal,
local customers -- given the high standards that's no surprise.
* Next week Glasgow's museums and galleries come under the spotlight.
WELL WORTH A VISIT
* Loch Fyne Oyster Bar, Clachan Farm, Cairndow, Inveraray. Tel: 04996
236
THE low, white buildings which sit at the head of Loch Fyne provide
the setting for a cosy restaurant that serves the freshest fish and
seafood.
Salmon, which is smoked on the premises, is served with delicious
home-made bread. Oysters come from beds in the loch and are served on
their own or as part of other dishes.
The menu is large for such a small place, the food is simple but
excellent and the service friendly and informed.
One of the most perfect ways to spend a winter afternoon is a table by
the window, a platter of seafood, and a glass of wine from the
reasonably priced list.
* Cottiers, 93-95 Hyndland Street, Glasgow. Tel: 041 357 5825
COTTIERS restaurant is set in what used to be Dowanhill Parish Church,
but is now home to the Cottier Theatre, pub and restaurant.
The menu in the upstairs restaurant draws its influences from
south-west American and Mexican cooking. As expected there are chilli,
fajitas, burritos, tortillas, but the more interesting dishes tend to be
the chef's daily specials. The last time I visted these included Haitian
fried pork and chicken in orange and rosemary mojo.
Desserts include key lime pie and caramel shortcake.
The food is well presented, the service is not exemplary, but there is
a good selection of beers and wine.
* Henderson's Salad Table, 94 Hanover Street, Edinburgh. Tel: 031 225
2131
I FIRST visited Henderson's more than 10 years ago and return
frequently and have never been disappointed. This vegetarian restaurant
situated in a brightly lit basement serves a huge range of foods all day
long.
Lunch is never a quiet affair as everyone from students to retired
ladies take their place in the queue that winds round the self-service
counter. Hot meals could include lentil bake or cashew-nut roast, while
salads are always fresh and always served in large quantities.
Dessert might be dried fruit salad with soured cream or trifle.
There's also a good choice of cheeses.
The queue moves quickly, helped along by the well-informed staff, and
finding a table at lunchtime can be fraught, but sharing with other
guests can mean interesting conversation.

February must be the most boring month of winter -- well, of the year
really. Apart from pancakes and the tedious leap-year thing
In the second of a series of special essays for Weekender,Marcella
Evaristi finds herself alone on a winter's day in a deep and dark
December.
NOVEMBER 1960
LAST night was Guy Fawkes night and I was very excited, unlike my dog
who was very scared and shivered under the kitchen table. I found this
very strange because he is normally brave and once tried to bite an
Alsatian's bottom. He is a poodle.
All my aunties and uncles and cousins came over to our house and
brought more fireworks. There were stripey rockets with scrunchy blue
paper and loads of my favourites -- the ones that look like wee
upside-down pokey hats. And even bangers which we don't normally get,
but some of my cousins are boys and I've got no brothers so I expect my
parents couldn't be rude.
Before we started Mamma handed out mugs of tomato soup and sausages
and a huge tray as big as a table without any legs. The tray was for her
toffee apples. These are a million times nicer than the red ones you get
in the shops. The Cellophane stuff always takes half the crusty red
toffee off of those, but I like them, too. But her toffee is the actual
colour of toffee. And it's chewy and it not only goes round the apple
but makes a little plate of toffee at the bottom as well.
Other people's fireworks were scooting up already and there was a
lovely smell like matches and coal and frost all mixed up. Daddy went
off to get a hammer for the Catherine Wheels and then everything
happened very quickly and slowly at the same time. First of all my
cousin, Silvio, ran backwards from the box, then Mamma grabbed the hood
of my duffel coat and pulled me.
The box crackled and made little bangs at first, then it went lopsided
and blew up. It wasn't like a cartoon bomb. Colours started fizzing out
and then we were all watching from the kitchen. My auntie was screaming
at Silvio and my dog was barking and then everything went quiet again
apart from a purple bang from the end of next door's garden.
Silvio had dropped a match inside the box and looked really trembly.
He wasn't crying although he was holding his chin up very high.
My Dad said it was an accident and began to laugh. I felt sorry for
Silvio and said at some much worse accidents children went blind,
because I had seen the Guy Fawkes advertisements to be careful on the
television. Mamma stared at the burnt box and said: ''That went as
quickly as the year''.
I don't know what she meant because after November the fifth there's
nothing to look forward to until Christmas and that takes ages and ages.
DECEMBER, BOXING DAY, 1968.
HAVE received a tape recorder for my Christmas and I am beginning to
record my reminiscences. It starts with me saying ''It is my sixteenth
birthday to heaven'' like in the Dylan Thomas poem and then I go on
about my early vivid experiences. Like in the wintertime of my youth
when I was taken to the pantomime and my Mum and Dad knew a lot of
people in the cast cos their Alhambra Cafe was across from the Alhambra
theatre and I was only about five or something.
Larry Marshall came on stage dressed as a nurse in this hospital
sketch and Rikki Fulton in the character of Matron looked across and
said, ''Hey, if it's no' Nurse Marcellina!'' I couldn't believe that my
name (couldn't be a coincidence -- not with my name!!!) was spoken from
a professional stage. The same night I was taken backstage and met Lenny
the Lion who covered his long eyelashes with his paw and said, ''Isn't
she pretty?''
I am convinced these two memories, omens even, have informed my
desperation to try for a career in the theatre.
Everyone has gone for a walk but I feel like being solitary here in my
room with my Paul Simon Songbook. I am playing ''A winter's day -- in a
deep and dark December -- I am alone''. Strange that a stranger can
truly understand you.
I realise I can't remember exactly which pantomime included a hospital
sketch and Lenny the Lion. How quickly one can forget the details. Am
glad I plumped for the tape recorder and not Being and Nothingness by
Jean-Paul Sartre. Though I've heard that it's amazing. Since the
minutiae of our existence can so quickly fade from our consciousness I
will describe my bedroom for posterity. Whenever my parents redecorate I
have to look at my Citizens' Theatre posters. I nearly lost A Day in the
Death of Joe Egg under poppy wallpaper earlier in the year. I will also
recite my favourite sayings that I've got written on my Quotations
Board. Such as ''Love is the sweet delinquesence of the bowels'' penned
by the writer Kingsley Amis.
From my window I can see snow-laden trees, the MacDonalds Hotel and
some youths throwing snowballs. Realise I recognise them. The youths, I
mean. Perhaps some fresh air would be a useful hiatus. Over and out.
DECEMBER 1994
THE MINISTER AND THE CHRISTMAS TREE
AND a certain minister's speech was reported in the press, and thus it
was known how he railed at the godless and atheistic and improper
transformation of this pious time. ''For verily commercialism in all its
aspects has undermined this festival into a carnival of More and
Spend.''
And he railed at the tinsel which glittered like the lure of borrowed
gold. And he spat -- metaphorically -- on that bold, that brazen pagan
artefact the Christmas -- how unaptly named -- the Christmas Tree.
Now it happened that the children of the village heard of his disdain,
and knew as well their parents half agreed.
(Mostly their Mums and Dads had just concurred that this season coiled
them into huge expenditure. But the damage had been done.)
The children, quite exaggerating what they'd eavesdropped, panicked --
and as weans do, they formed a plan.
And so it was on Christmas Eve that night the little ones sneaked out
and each child carried a branch cut from their own trees. What a motley
Birnam wood waved through the snow in a line towards that minister's
abode.
Some brought silver artificial branches with red velvet bows. Some
held pine with baubles -- every type of seasonal dark conifer or plastic
twig that you have ever seen bobbled and swayed as the children made
their way along the road.
When at last they arrived in the minister's front garden you might
have thought a circus troupe had come to town. Like acrobats they jumped
up on each others' shoulders, the strongest on the ground and the
smallest toddler like a fairy wobbling on the top.
For yes, you've guessed it, that Baby Birnam had become a beautiful
tall tree, and unknownst to them, from a nearby roof, a gentleman in red
was watching every swaying move.
''Ho, ho, how wonderful!'' said Santa with a grin. ''When most kiddies
are cuddled up excited waiting with bated breath for me -- these wee
ones brought some old pensioner a tree! You have lifted my heart,'' he
said, with sentimental tear, ''your gorgeous tree has everything but
presents -- here!'' (And threw one down.)
Just then a window opened and a head popped out. ''We wish you Merry
Christmas!'' was the children's shout.
The minister was silent.
Then with trembling voice said ''Would this be mine?''
And now he wears green boxer shorts, signed Calvin Klein.
JANUARY
I HAVE finally located my 1995 diary; it was hiding from me under a
Home Farm set. On the cover of the box there's a farmhouse and fences, a
farmer, a windmill, and a long wall; there's geese and a cockerel,
rabbits, ponies, ducks, and all the animals you would expect. Inside
there's a small transparent plastic bag with two cows, a pig, and
three-quarters of a pen. A colostomy of disappointment. On the side of
the box you can see, with the help of a microscope, the words Colours
and contents may vary from picture shown.
I curl up on the carpet with my diary and settle down to symbolically
begin my New Year. It is the seventh of January. Pine needles have
porcupined my foot. I wait a little, But when no prince appears to
remove them with his perfect teeth, I am not dismayed. I am resilient,
hopeful, and practical.
Under Things to Remember I write Get Hoover fixed. But the resolutions
have to wait until I fill in my personal details. Name, yes, address,
yes, home number, yes. Under business number I write my home number out
again. But in brisker, sort of affluent lettering.
Then my pen hovers above National Insurance number, moves south over
National Health number and passport number, then, stopping briefly over
driving licence number, moves decisively back to Things to Remember and
writes Learn to drive.
I briskly move to my desk and look out of the window. There's been no
snow this year, so the playful boys on the street have been reduced to
throwing stones wrapped round with nothing but their own young fingers.
The man who arrived with his machine to spray away the cockroaches has
been and gone, so under January fourth I write, Phoned hygiene
department.
I notice that Wednesday the first of February, subject to the sighting
of the moon, is the First Day of Ramadan, that Monday the sixth is
Waiting Day in New Zealand, but there's no mention of St Valentine's Day
on the fourteenth.
I rather disapprove of this because what if there's no moon on the
first and you're not giving it what-for in Wellington on the sixth, then
you might forget the only mildly interesting day of the whole month.
Because February must be the most boring month of winter -- well, of the
year really. Apart from pancakes and the tedious leap-year thing. (There
was always a boring old bastard, some acquaintance of your parents,
betting you a 10 shilling note he really was 11.)
Beside February thirteenth, I write Remember ST VD seven thirty am
tomorrow in squashed-up handwriting so that it will look, should anyone
glance at my diary beside the phone, as if I had breakfast business
meetings whilst self-deluding lovelorn women listened out for postie
from behind their own front doors.
Suddenly I realise that I am being winked at. Under hygiene department
I write, At least four hours a day no stinting no matter what, and
putting down my pen I move to the flickering word processor and press
the button for Create A New Document. I type the title, On Princes and
Disclaimers, then, after a small hiatus, I put Paul Simon on and light a
fag.

A LOVE which blossomed across the Celtic boardroom table was yesterday
given the official seal of approval when Mr Fergus McCann married
Glasgow lawyer Miss Elspeth Campbell.
The couple met in 1993 when Miss Campbell, an associate with
solicitors McGrigor Donald, advised Mr McCann and his team on their
takeover of the club.
Mr McCann, 53, capped off a great week for himself and the club, a
week in which a share issue has raised more than #14m, when he married
Miss Campbell, 32, in St Margaret's Church in Ayr.
A small number of family and friends, with both Celtic players and
directors conspicuous by their absence, braved icy winds to gather for
the short ecumenical service conducted by Fr Thomas Monaghan, of St
Ninian's in Gourock, and the Rev James Whyte, of Broom Church, Newton
Mearns, a close family friend.
One of the first to arrive was the bride's mother, Effie, a retired
Church of Scotland minister, who delighted waiting photographers by
teasing them: ''Will I do? Wait until I get my handbag in front of me
like the Queen.''
Mr McCann seemed nervous as he appeared wearing formal attire -- for
once his trademark bunnet was missing.
The bride arrived, bareheaded and wearing a dress of classic design in
cream crushed silk, and walked down the aisle on the arm of her uncle.
Both priest and minister shared the duties with Mr Whyte prompting
laughter with his comment: ''For you both this is the first day of the
rest of your lives. For you, Fergus, if you'll pardon the pun, this is a
whole new ball game.''
McCann placed the ring on his wife's finger stating: ''This gold and
silver I give you as a token of all my wordly goods.'' Afterwards the
couple posed briefly for photographers.
The reception was being held at Lochgreen House, in Troon.

Scottish Television's series about the eighties moves on to 1983.
David Belcher looks at who was in the news
IT is tempting to employ hindsight -- and the title of Bill Forsyth's
biggest cinema hit to date -- in order to describe 1983 as the year in
which a greater number of local heroes came into their own in the wider
world beyond Scotland. In tomorrow night's episode of Scottish
Television's Time of Your Life, the ongoing series reflecting upon the
eighties, it is plain that the release of Local Hero certainly did a
terrific job of alerting Hollywood to Forsyth's directorial skills.
Yet it has taken the whole of the decade since then for Local Hero's
Scottish star, Peter Capaldi, pictured on this page in a scene from the
film with his American co-star Peter Riegert, to achieve the same
measure of acclaim, first as an actor and latterly as a director in his
own right.
Similarly, John Spencer -- pictured here as a gap-toothed schoolboy in
his teens -- has had to wait long and journey far to reach the top of
his profession as a footballer. In 1983 he was in the news as the first
Catholic football player to be signed by Rangers.
After a long Ibrox apprenticeship, most of which was spent playing in
the reserves, Spencer was sold to Chelsea. At Stamford Bridge, however,
Spencer's goal-scoring prowess in the English Premiership has been such
that he has been called up into the Scotland squad, having to date won
two caps. But at least Rangers can congratulate themselves for having
continued to take positive steps to banish the nonsensical links between
sectarianism and soccer.
If only there could have been such a measure of success for another of
the events pictured here and to be featured in Time of Your Life
tomorrow. Alas, the People's March for Jobs, which set off from Scotland
with noble intent in 1983, failed to spark rumblings of conscience among
the Tory Government.
AND Scottish chart music in 1983? It sounded very healthy. Oozing
anthemic self-confidence, Waterfront was Simple Minds before they grew
into stadium-sized blandness and unwitting self-parody. Aztec Camera
were in full flow with Oblivious and Walk out to Winter, while with
songs such as Right by Your Side Eurythmics were newly taking the whole
world by storm.
And, true to his perverse nature, in the midst of such apparent
musical plenty Orange Juice's Edwyn Collins was advising us to Rip It Up
(And Start Again). Always the best Scottish motto, I suppose.

CLAIMS that the QE2 was in trouble for spilling sewage on its
round-the-world cruise were dismissed by the liner's owners Cunard last
night. It was reported the 67,000-ton vessel had spilled sewage while
anchored off Hawaii and the state's Maritime Law Enforcement Division
was investigating the matter. However, a Cunard spokesman said the QE2
had merely deposited some waste water which was rusty in colour.
''Coastguards boarded the ship, did some interviews, and were quite
happy when they left. We know nothing of the enforcement division
getting involved.''

CHANNEL Tunnel car passengers had to be switched to a ferry crossing
yesterday after two shuttle trains broke down. Technical faults in the
Le Shuttle trains at Folkestone in Kent meant 50 cars and their
passengers completed the crossing to Calais on a P&amp;O European Ferries
ship from Dover. There were delays of up to two-and-a-half hours for Le
Shuttle passengers who chose to wait for the trains.

THE biggest legal action ever raised in a sheriff court has begun.
Stone company boss Jimmy Wilson, 52, is suing the Scots Secretary for
#12.9m plus VAT over 80,000 tons of sandstone which Mr Wilson says he
had stockpiled on his land and which vanished during the building of a
new stretch of the M74.
Mr Wilson, of Carmyle Farm, Carmyle, Glasgow, claims the stones were
taken without his permission or knowledge, and also claims he still owns
the ground on which the 100 metre stretch of the M74 was built and which
the Scottish compulsorily took over. His action against the Scots
Secretary was lodged this week at Glasgow Sheriff Court by the legal
firm, Mellicks.

IN JUST one short decade two Americans, Susan Kasen Summer and Robert
D Summer, have made their name as the biggest collectors of contemporary
British, and particularly, Scottish, art. Bob Summer is president of
Sony Music while his wife Susan, having triumphed in a first career as
floral designer, is currently establishing a world lead in another:
hi-tech 3D image generation.
With two children each, several houses and so much to do in their
careers, how do they find time to collect art? In suitably transatlantic
fashion, they are both dedicated, passionate -- and focused.
''When Susan and I came together she had a small collection of the
better-known contemporary American artists like Frank Stella, de
Kooning, Hans Hofmann and Noland while I had Latin American works,''
explains Bob. ''I had travelled there quite a bit and was attracted to
their figurative folkloric narrative style. They were artists
well-schooled in their craft of painting -- it was the same mind at work
that eventually led to our British collection.''
The Summers' British focus began in 1988 when they exhibited their
then quite disparate collection at Duke University in North Carolina
under the title Fable and Fantasies. Faced with their melange of Latin
American, British, American, Italian, and German art, the curator hung
Scottish pictures by Wiszniewski, Howson, and Campbell on one wall. ''We
then made a discovery. The Scottish paintings were by far the most
exciting. So there and then we decided this was the way to go. From then
on we concentrated entirely on British art.''
Now they have more than 500 British pictures ranging from Sickert's
turn-of-the-century oils via Gertler, Matthew Smith, Kossoff, Auerbach,
and Hockney up to today's new graduates from Glasgow and London's Royal
College.
Their first Scottish acquisition was a picture by Adrian Wiszniewski
called Nuclear Fission which Susan first saw through the window of
Nicola Jacob's Gallery in Cork Street in 1985. ''I was in a business
meeting. She called to say I had to leave the office before 6pm. She'd
found a picture we just had to have.'' It now hangs in their Manhattan
townhouse.
Their next brush with Scottish art happened by fluke. The Summers came
to Scotland in 1987 because their old friend John Mauceri, then director
and principal conductor, was doing a new production of Aida at Scottish
Opera in Glasgow. In the afternoon they visited Glasgow Art Galleries
where, unusually, there was a room showing the four young Glasgow Boys
including Peter Howson.
With their usual persistence they managed to track down the one they
liked best, Howson, and asked him to dinner after the opera. Howson
brought his friend, the painter Ken Currie, and later they all went to
their East Campbell Street studios in the Barrows. Bob Summers
remembers: ''We were enthralled. We liked the strong social content of
their work. We looked at many pictures and talked and talked. We were
still there at 2am. Collecting decisions are always made jointly.
Eventually we bought Howson's very moving oil, A Wing and A Prayer.''
The Howson shows one of his characteristic bullet-headed dossers on
his knees praying under a wall, unable to make it -- physically,
socially, or spiritually -- to the nearby church, glimpsed round the
corner.
I remember meeting Howson just after this visit. He was full of
excitement about his new American collectors. They soon became great
friends, with the Summers flying in for all Howson's big London
exhibitions, and his Glasgow wedding.
''The next piece of the puzzle came at Steve Campbell's London show
when we bought a picture titled The Man who Gave his Legs to God. Steve
is a great guy!'' Both the Summers say they have much enjoyed their
meetings and friendship with the artists. ''Collecting has turned out to
be one of the most rewarding pursuits of our lives.''
During the late 1980s the Summers bought in depth: adding English
works of the same generation to the original Scottish nucleus. ''Then we
decided to cast a wider net, and we gravitated to the work of young,
developing artists,'' says Bob. ''Soon 25% of our collection was coming
from art schools.'' They especially favoured the Royal College where I
met them in action on several occasions.
''We like being on the cutting edge,'' says Susan, ''we are not
after-the-fact collectors.''
In 1991 they provided a studio for an ex-Royal College student, Ansel
Krut, in a house near their Connecticut home overlooking Lake Waramaug.
Another British artist, Hugh O'Donnell, lived nearby. He had emigrated
to the US a few years earlier and his abstract work was seminal to the
Summers' collecting. He also provided their first British painting.
O'Donnell was knowledgeable about properties in the vicinity and advised
on the multitude of vacant mills and industrial buildings in the valley
ideal for conversion to studios. The next artist, Sandy Guy (ex-Dundee
1980-84 and Royal College 85-87), benefited from a new studio loft in
New Preston.
Guy arrived in New York in June 1992 with #40 in his pocket. The
Summers paid for a Fifth Avenue hotel where he lived a kind of Crocodile
Dundee existence while he found his feet. Once ensconced in his
Connecticut country abode, Guy saw the Elvis Presley anniversary
celebration on TV, visited Graceland -- and his subject was set: a
series of oils on Elvis's star-spangled costumes. Alison Watt also
experienced the Summers' overwhelming generosity on a trip to New York.
''They were kindness personified.''
This involvement with people, with the artists themselves, is what
makes the Summers stand out from other American collectors. After
college, Susan herself had been unable to have a break to take stock
before throwing herself into earning a living. She regrets this lack of
space away from the pressures of financial worries and had the idea of
providing an alternative route for young artists. ''We decided we wanted
to do more than just buy.''
Gradually Susan's vision took shape. In 1992 she set up the Kasen
Summer Studio Fellowships at the Royal College. The first two award
winners joined Guy that autumn in Connecticut.
By 1993 two larger groups of Royal College graduates were installed in
the new Bantam building. The studios provide generous working space,
great facilities, a productive atmosphere -- and free food! At the
weekend the Summers organise visits and dinner parties with guests from
the New York art world. The first Scots to enjoy Bantam are Jenny
Saville and Paul McPhail. ''The studios are quite isolated so you can
get on and work, but are near enough to New York to go there for
research and to see all the exhibitions,'' says Jenny. ''It has been
absolutely marvellous for us. Fantastic! Susan has the most amazing
contacts and can arrange anything and Bob is really great to talk to
about one's work.'' Now Glasgow School of Art, too, is to benefit from
three scholarships each year.
The Summers' current show, An American Passion (a selection of 100 of
their 500 pictures), at Glasgow's McLellan till March 5, then at
London's Royal College in the autumn, has stripped their walls of some
favourites. But, says Bob: ''We have rehung our houses with more
contemplative, reflective works. The result thrills me.'' Meanwhile, he
is happy to say that their chosen artists continue to develop
artistically and do well in their career. ''And I have tired of none of
the paintings.'' Back at the Bantam studios things continue to ''boil''.
''We watch each artist move from tentative start to explosive, creative
productivity. We see their personal growth and, not least, we enjoy
their company.''

MORE demonstrators were arrested at the Essex port of Brightlingsea
yesterday, as a convoy of lorries loaded with sheep arrived for export
to the Continent.
About 300 people, protesting against the export of live animals from
the port, slow-marched ahead of the lorry convoy, Essex police said.
A spokeswoman said about 20 people, who attempted to prevent the
lorries entering the port by sitting in their way, were arrested.
The protest was the latest in a series this month which have seen
around 10% of Brightlingsea's 15,000 population join in at times.
Police have been criticised for heavy-handed tactics, which have
included the use of riot gear -- unfamiliar to many of the small town's
residents.
But both sides have been keen to avoid violent clashes, particularly
the police, who estimate the cost of operations to protect the port at
#40,000 a day.
This week, Mr Ernest Oliver, 73, the owner of the Brightlingsea Dock
and Wharfage Company at the centre of the demonstrations, said he would
sell up because he was ''shocked and horrified'' at an attack on his
house in Tendring, Essex. Police have since placed him under protection.
Elsewhere, animal rights activists claimed victory yesterday after
management at Swansea Airport agreed to abandon exports of veal calves
to Europe.

AN ARMY captain who was dismissed from the service because of her
pregnancy was yesterday awarded #39,000 by an industrial tribunal.
Mrs Abigail Kirby-Harris, 44, had been seeking #505,000 after she was
''compulsorily'' retired from the Royal Army Education Corps in 1982
when five months pregnant.
The mother of two claimed against the Ministry of Defence for loss of
pay seniority and pension. She claimed if she had not been dismissed
after four years in a short-term commission she would have stayed on and
become a major or possibly lieutenant colonel.
The Ministry of Defence admitted discriminating against her in
following their policy of ''compulsory retirement'' over her pregnancy,
but contested the amount of the award.
Mrs Kirby-Harris, of St Breward on Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, was not at
the tribunal. Her claim was the largest since July last year when the
Employment Appeals Tribunal gave new guidelines over such awards. It
described previous six figure awards as ''manifestly excessive''.
The Ministry of Defence has less than 1000 cases involving service
women still to deal with. It is understood final payments for a total of
5000 cases overall could be in the region of #47m.
A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman in London said: ''This award is far
far lower than she originally asked for. We are very delighted. It is
very good news for the Ministry and for the taxpayer.''
Mrs Kirby-Harris, speaking from her home yesterday, said she was
''delighted''. She said the Ministry's original offer was #3300 which
she found ''insulting''.

THE chief executive of Independent Television News, Mr David Gordon --
who helped oversee the news network's recent restructure -- resigned
yesterday.
Mr Gordon, 52, who joined ITN in May 1993, has agreed to stay until a
successor is appointed and no departure date has been set.
He said: ''I set myself a number of targets. These, notably, concerned
establishing the profitability of the organisation and developing its
roles as a world-class news supplier.
''Having achieved my primary objectives for the company, I now look
forward to handing over to my successor an organisation in good heart,
good financial condition and with a first-class staff dedicated to
maintaining ITN's proud traditions.''
Robert Noakes, head of entertainment with BBC Radio Scotland, is
resigning after being in the post for more than eight years.
He is to set up his own production company which he hopes will enable
him to take advantage of the expanding radio market. He also will be
reverting more to his folk singer persona as Rab Noakes.
Mr Noakes is currently on leave and his resignation will take effect
from the middle of next month.

A MAN was jailed for nine years at the Old Bailey yesterday, for
killing two young women neighbours in a fire he started after they
complained about noise.
Lifelong friends, Miss Geraldine King and Miss Amanda Lofting, both
22, perished in the blaze, deliberately set by Enda Doyle, that engulfed
their north London bedsit.
Miss Rosina Hare, QC, prosecuting, told the court the women had
returned from a visit to the funfair on May 30, a bank holiday weekend
last year, when they were disturbed by Doyle, 29, a painter and
decorator, making a loud noise in the room below.
After a drinking session with his girlfriend he had returned home and
started running up and down stairs, turned the volume of his television
up, and made a noise banging doors.
Miss King had pleaded ''stop the noise as some people have to work
tomorrow''. There followed an argument ''which ended in tragedy'', said
Miss Hare.
He sprinkled a flammable liquid around his downstairs room and ignited
it. Miss King, the bedsit tenant, and Miss Lofting, who was staying
overnight, died from asphyxiation and burning.
Doyle, from Wembley, north London, was convicted of two charges of
manslaughter, but cleared of murdering Miss King, a secretary, and Miss
Lofting, a shop assistant. He had denied all charges.
Passing sentence, Judge Brian Smedley told Doyle: ''For whatever
reason, jealousy, anger, or simply because you were peeved, you
deliberately set fire to your room.
''This was in a house where you knew there were two perfectly ordinary
young women who had been out for a happy day on a bank holiday. By the
result of your deliberate actions they were burned alive.''

A GLASGOW teenager died in hospital in Paris yesterday from burns she
suffered three months ago in a fire on her uncle's yacht in the
Mediterranean.
Christina di Paolo, 17, had been undergoing treatment at the city's
military hospital, which has one of the leading burns centres in Europe.
She had been flown there from Toulon after the fire, in which she
sustained 90% burns to her body. Her aunt and cousin escaped from the
blazing yacht after an electrical spark ignited fuel vapour, but
Christina was trapped and her uncle, who pulled her from the flames, was
also badly burned and died a few weeks later.
Since then her parents -- her father is a pharmacist -- have travelled
back and forth from Paris to be by her side, but they were asked to let
the doctors switch off their daughter's life-support when she failed to
recover from the latest in a series of painstaking operations on
Thursday.
News of Christina's death was broken to her former classmates in the
sixth year at St Aloysius College in Glasgow. She had left at the end of
fifth year with five A grade Highers and an acceptance to study law this
year at Glasgow University, where her sister is studying medicine.
She had planned to spend a year on a working holiday in France, and
had been living with her aunt and uncle in the South of France when the
accident happened.
Before she left, Christina had undertaken work study placements with
Glasgow advocates Mr Jim Hughes, his wife Margaret and their partner, Mr
Frank Gallagher. Mr Hughes said last night: ''It is an absolute tragedy.
She was a bright, beautiful girl with a lovely personality and
everything to live for.
''If she had survived she would have faced years of pain.''

A FARMER was killed in a shooting accident as he was about to help
cull deer hinds on a remote estate owned by a Highland peer yesterday.
The tragedy on the Dalnawillan Estate owned by Viscount Thurso, the
Lord Lieutenant of Caithness, happened when a rifle accidentally went
off as the farmer and a keeper were loading guns before stalking red
deer at Ben Alisky.
Mr Henry Sinclair, 44, a married man from Mountpleasant Farm, Halkirk,
near Thurso, was airlifted to Caithness General Hospital, Wick, by a
helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth, but was found to be dead on arrival.
The keeper was treated for shock.
Lord Thurso, who was told of the tragedy after visiting a nearby
cottage, said: ''It seems to have been a terrible accident. This sort of
thing can happen to even the most experienced people.''
Last night, a police spokesman said enquiries were continuing, but
there seemed to be no suspicious circumstances.

THE 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp was

More than 5000 mourners lit candles for the 1.5 million people
murdered as part of the Nazi plan to destroy Europe's Jewish population.
Twenty presidents and monarchs present joined in signing a declaration
to the peoples of the world calling for peace.
The camp survivors were led by Nobel prizewinner Elie Wiesel, who
recalled the fate of those dragged to the gas chambers.
''Listen to the screams of terrified mothers. Listen to the prayers of
anguished old men and women. Listen to the tears of children,'' Wiesel
told a crowd at Birkenau, a sister camp to Auschwitz, where most of the
victims were gassed.
The mourners lit candles along the rusting rail track that once
brought trains full of Jews from all over Nazi Europe to the camp in
Poland.

SCOTLAND slithered to a halt yesterday as heavy snowfalls disrupted
transport. Blizzards struck much of the country around lunchtime with
parts of Lanarkshire and Ayrshire hardest hit.
Within an hour, vast areas of Strathclyde, including Glasgow city
centre, were hit by snow, the first major snowfall of the year.
As snowploughs battled to keep the main routes open, the motoring
organisations became swamped with emergency calls from drivers whose
vechicles had skidded off the road.
Although not weather-related, a lorry overturned on the M8, near to
the Kingston Bridge, and caused major traffic congestion in and around
the city centre for nearly three hours.
Strathclyde Police reported a spate of minor bumps as many motorists
struggled to cope with slippery road conditions. While only two roads
were considered impassable -- the A76 Largs-Kilbirnie and the Eaglesham
Moor road -- police still advised drivers only to make essential
journeys.
Drifting snow also made driving hazardous further south, with the A74
at the Beattock summit only passable with extreme caution. Snowploughs
struggled to cope as more than five inches of snow was reported in many
areas.
A white blanket of snow several inches thick descended on Glasgow
Airport forcing it to close shortly after four o'clock. Thirteen
domestic flights had to be diverted to Edinburgh Airport while two
international flights from Tenerife were later routed to Prestwick.
Four domestic outbound flights were also cancelled.
Rail passengers fared no better, with the adverse weather conditions
badly affecting train services leaving Glasgow Queen Street. Rush-hour
services out of Central Station were also seriously exacerbated by a
points failure.
Trains between Glasgow and Edinburgh also suffered major disruptions
after points became jammed with snow.
Glasgow Weather Centre predicted that the snowfalls would ease up
early today with a general thaw later in the afternoon.
A spokesman said: ''The snowfalls have been heavy and prolonged. This
is likely to continue throughout the night, although it will start to
tail off and milder weather will follow.''
Heavy snowfalls closed roads in Cumbria last night. A seven-mile
tailback blocked the A590 linking the M6 to Barrow. The A66
trans-Pennine route to Scotch Corner was impassable at Stainmore as was
the A6 over Shap Fell.
In West Yorkshire, motorway traffic was cut to a crawl after five more
inches of snow.
* Thousands of Germans fled their homes along rain-swollen rivers
yesterday as hail, blizzards and storm winds raging at up to 95mph
lashed central and southern parts of the country. A sudden temperature
drop of 12C (22F) turned roads into ice rinks and at least two drivers
were killed in a crash in Bavaria.

By ELIZABETH BUIE
BRITAIN'S children are being failed by the Government which is accused
of serious breaches of the spirit of the UN Convention on Children's
Rights.
In a stinging indictment of Government policies to children, a United
Nations report, covering almost all walks of life, attacks Ministers for
breaching the spirit of the convention.
The convention, which states that laws should be framed in the ''best
interests of children'' was ratified by the British Government in 1991.
According to the report by a UN committee, set up to monitor Britain's
ratification of the convention, the British Government is failing to do
this, particularly when legislating on health, education, and social
security.
Members of the committee warn that Government proposals to build
secure training centres for young juvenile delinquents are likely to be
in breach of UN laws.
Criticising the high number of children living in poverty, the report
also raises concerns over the number of teenage pregnancies in Britain,
the soaring divorce rate, cuts in state benefits, and the number of
children sleeping and begging on the streets.
In addition, committee members say they are ''disturbed'' about
domestic laws allowing the physical punishment of children in their own
homes, and in privately-funded or managed schools.
Scottish children welfare groups immediately endorsed the report's
findings and said it could have important implications for the framing
of the Children (Scotland) Bill which is currently going through
Parliament.
Ms Alison Cleland, solicitor with the Scottish Child Law Centre, said:
''This highly critical report means that the Government and the Scottish
Office must take immediate steps if they want us to believe that they
are now prepared to take children's rights seriously.''
She added: ''The committee has said there must be far more Government
money available to support children and their families. Benefits to 16
and 17-year-olds must be restored.
''Proper financial provision must be made for children's services
under the new Children (Scotland) Bill, especially support for those
leaving care. The Government will also have to rethink its refusal to
include a limitation of parents' rights to smack within the new bill.''
Current practice of excluding children from school without giving them
a chance of being heard must be reviewed in the light of the report,
said Ms Cleland.
In addition, the Scottish Office must produce guidance and training
documents about children's rights, in line with the UN Convention, as
the report specifically states that the police, judges, and care
professionals should be made aware of children's rights, she said.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said: ''We will obviously study
the report very carefully and read it with interest.''
Mr Thomas Hammarberg, the committee's vice-chairman, said that there
were particular worries over the UK's policy on juvenile offenders.
Members believed the proposed secure training centres were a major
inconsistency. There was also concern that the age of criminality in
England at ten was too low. In Scotland the age of criminality is even
lower at eight years of age.
''The convention clearly states that if juveniles are to be locked up,
it should be as a last resort and for the shortest time possible,'' he
said.
''Allowing 12 to 14-year-olds to be locked up for a period of up to
two years is not in harmony with that at all.''
The report is the result of a session in Geneva this week where
Government officials were questioned by the UN committee. The eight-page
document has just three paragraphs focusing on positive aspects. The
remaining 16 are critical, and there are a further 23 devoted to
recommendations.
Among the ''principal areas of concern'' highlighted are the:
* Lack of any independent co-ordinating mechanism to monitor the
rights of the child.
* Adequacy of measures and resources allocated to ensure the full
implementation of rights.
* Use of emergency legislation in Northern Ireland whereby children as
young as ten can be held for up to seven days without charge.
* Lack of say given to children over whether they should have sex
education.
* ''Disturbing'' reports on physical and sexual abuse.
The committee urges the Government to withdraw its reservations over
the convention and give ''greater priority'' to its general principles.
It recommends that laws should be passed making it illegal to punish
physically children in families and says that plans to set up secure
training centres for 12-14 years olds should be reviewed.
Among other recommendations are calls for measures to end health
inequalities between children from different social and ethnic
backgrounds and to ease homelessness. Youngsters expelled from school
should be given an automatic right of appeal and children generally
should have a say in the running of their schools.
Issues such as drug abuse and sexual exploitation which affect
children should be addressed ''urgently'', the report adds. Rights
should be to gipsy or traveller children, including their right to
education.
Some 171 countries worldwide have ratified the Convention. So far,
officials from 33 have been questioned by the Committee.
Mr Michael Taylor, the Uk director of Save the Children, said the
report made clear there was ''still a long way to go''.
''All our children have the right to an adequate standard of living.
That is what Article 27 actually says. But around one in three children
in the UK are growing up in poverty.''
Mr John Bowis, the parliamentary secretary at the Department of
Health, said: ''I welcome what the committee are saying on good practice
on child welfare, bullying, adoption and help for children with special
educational needs.
''I am mildly surprised at some of their criticisms, for example
parents' right to reasonably chastise their children.
''Our work in child welfare has been a model of good practice, and
other countries have been beating path to our door to learn from us.''

AS love affairs go, it was a torrid and truly manic time and one
guaranteed to give my long-suffering mother palpitations if she ever
found out.
But she was everything you could ever have wanted, and indeed, so much
more. Sexy curves, a fast mover, totally responsive, and with an
incurable thirst for excitement. A far cry from anything before her, and
boy she knew it.
Sadly as so often happens during such crazy crazy times, it all ended
in floods of tears -- mine -- especially after a rather ugly
confrontation with a man in a dark blue uniform, who, more noticeably,
was seriously lacking in the decency stakes.
But, heavily armed with a nifty radar gun which could shoot you down
at a hundred paces, let's just say that he had the upper hand on this
occasion, and he certainly wasn't about to join the ranks of the human
race on my account.
''Nice little mover, Nigel,'' he grinned, clearly enjoying the look of
horror rapidly etching across my visage. The rest of his tirade I will
not bore you with, other than to say it ended up with a weight being
taken off my wallet and three nifty points making an appearance on my
licence.
His parting remark that he had not seen many of this kind in his
neighbourhood was enough to prompt a parting of the ways, hard though it
was. Within a matter of weeks my pride and joy, a sleek sporty-red Honda
CRX, which would leave any hot hatch gasping at the starting gates, was
replaced by a boring, and relatively staid Fiesta XR2.
While this incident took place many years ago -- I still blame the
last fling of youth (honest) -- the memory of my Honda has remained
intact.
Goes without saying, therefore, that the opportunity to rekindle this
past romance, albeit rather briefly, was not to be missed.
Now on its third generation of CRX, Honda has, in fact, transformed
the old hatch into a chic compact two-seater designed to offer true
''open-top'' fun thanks to its unique removable roof.
Unlike many of its competitors, the CRX provides wind-in-the-hair
motoring with a level of security and protection largely unavailable
from any of its cabriolet rivals.
To be totally honest, I have to confess here and now that I didn't
actually manage to get the roof off, the simple reason being that my
road test coincided with the December floods. Be fair, do you think
Honda would accept a small submarine on return!
One of the many features on my test car was, however, an electric
removable roof. Talk about making life easy, or what? Still, it kept
several of my neighbours entertained for a while.
While the outward appearance of the new CRX has changed, becoming much
more striking than its predecessor, Honda has been careful to retain
many of its past strengths, such as its nippy performance and crisp
handling. The responsive 1.6 litre, 16-valve would leave Linford
Christie high and dry, covering 0-60mph in under eight seconds,
eventually powering its way to a top speed of more than 130mph.
There is a dangerous tendency to keep pushing the undeniable speed
capabilities of the Honda to the limit, much of this, I have to say
brought on by the car's own thirst for the fast lane. But much of this
is done in the safe knowledge that the steering is responsive enough to
get you out of any difficulties which may arise.
Performance, surprisingly, doesn't come at a heavy price and fuel
consumption is unlikely to get you on first-name terms with the garage
attendants. Driven at a steady 56mph, it is easily possible to achieve
around 46 miles on a gallon, dropping to 37mpg when the foot slips to
75mph.
On the road, the car is relatively smooth with only a slight noise
hiss emanating when driven at high speed. However, it is prone to
picking up some road noise, particularly when hard-pressed.
As with its predecessor, the newcomer comes equipped with more
attractions than blessed on the entire female cast of Baywatch! There
is, of course, the usual electric package of windows, including the rear
one, mirrors, aerial, etc.
The cabin is remarkably spacious, with the Honda designers also
deserving credit for managing to house sufficient stowage space within
limited means. The sports seats are comfortable and provide sufficient
lumbar support. The safety-belt buckle has also been incorporated into
the seat to ensure maximum comfort and improved safety.
The instrument-panel cluster also provides no problems either, with
all the dials easily digested at a glance. The height of the steering
wheel can be adjusted to allow for maximum viewing purposes regardless
of the height of the driver.
My only real criticism of the new CRX is indeed relatively minor. The
console housing the controls for the windows, locks, and side mirrors,
found on the driver's door, can often be difficult to operate at night.
It would be much easier and possibly safer if the switches themselves
were illuminated to make them simpler to find in the dark.
Overall, however, the Honda was an absolute joy to drive and probably
a better performer than my old love. But as they say, love can often be
sweeter second time around.
In Brief
WHO says that size doesn't matter? British motorists firmly believe
so, maintaining that the bigger the better, according to the findings of
a new report. Quizzed over the important factors when buying a new car,
more UK drivers placed size before safety or running costs. And no, they
weren't all women who were interviewed!
Rover remained the country's ''dream'' machine, beating BMW or Jaguar,
while in Europe, most fancied themselves behind the wheel of a Mercedes.
FAMED for its cuisine, it is perhaps hardly surprising that the French
car giant Renault is about to serve up another little dish to whet the
appetite of the British motoring public.
Its consistent top 10 seller in Britain, the Clio, is to get a quartet
of special editions following a link up with Les Routiers, the renowned
hotel and restaurant guide.
Available now in the showrooms, the newcomers feature a unique package
of equipment in three and five-door guises, and also offer both 1.2
litre petrol and 1.9 litre diesel engine options.
ANYONE buying a car under the Vauxhall Network Q scheme will now have
longer to decide whether they want to keep it. Up until now,
dissatisfied drivers could exchange the car during the first 14 days or
500 miles covered. The arrangement has now been extended to 30 days or
1000 miles.
SAAB's distinctive 900 range is poised to capture a wider audience
with prices starting at under #14,000 following the launch of two
well-equipped entry models.
The new 900 2.0i three and five-door derivatives, at #13,995 and
#14,495 respectively, go on sale from the start of next month. Standard
equipment on both models includes ABS brakes, a full-size driver's
airbag, power steering, electric windows and mirrors, headlamp
wash/wipe, and all Saab's widely acclaimed passive-safety integrity.

A FRESH political crisis over rail privatisation will face the
Government next week when it concedes that the minimum passenger service
requirements for certain sections of the railways will be less than
those currently offered.
On Tuesday Mr Roger Salmon, the railways franchising director, will
announce the first round of politically-sensitive figures defining the
minimum level of service franchise operators will have to provide.
Critics of privatisation have warned that anything less than the
present service, as defined by the British Rail timetable, would be a
betrayal of the travelling public.
Yesterday, in a speech to the Association of Train Operating
Companies, Mr Brian Mawhinney, the Transport Secretary, warned that, in
some cases, the passenger service requirement will be below the existing
level.
In an effort to head-off the criticism which will inevitably accompany
news of a potential cut in services, he emphasised that the PSRs would
be a ''guaranteeed minimum service''. He added: ''They are the
guaranteed minimum, not the likely service on many lines.''
Labour seized on the concession. Mr Michael Meacher, the Shadow
Transport Secretary, said: ''Dr Mawhinney's statement today sounds a
death knell for services and effectively writes the epitaph for
privatisation.''
Mr Mike Patterson, Secretary of the Central Rail Users' Consultative
Committee, said: ''If Mr Salmon does not specify the operating of a full
service, then some operators may choose not to run a full one.''
Mr Keith Brown, the SNP's transport spokesman, said: ''Already the
Government are trying to slide out of their commitment that
privatisation would improve the standard of services on offer.''
Mr Chris Green, ScotRail's managing director said yesterday in
Inverness that there was now little hope of saving the Fort William
sleeper service but the Motorail service to Scotland might yet be
reprieved.
He was in Inverness with his opposite number from Railtrack, Dr Paul
Prescott, for a meeting with Highland Regional Council.
After the meeting Mr Green said: ''The Fort William sleeper . . . must
be one of the most heavily subsidised trains in Britain and anyone who
wants to keep it is going to have to be looking for a subsidy in excess
of #3m a year.
''I think it would be a very difficult decision to justify socially
because the usage is very small.''
At present the sleeper trains are a mixture of sleeper and Motorail
cars, but Mr Green said it came down to cash to keep the service going
with #1m needed to do that. This would be the cost of subsidising a
third sleeper from Euston every night, which could include Motorail.

Compensation is in the bag if you know your rights, says Julie
Davidson
YOU know the feeling. The carousel circles, its cargo diminishes, and
one by one your fellow passengers disappear with their trolleys. You are
left alone in the baggage hall with, perhaps, one dislocated suitcase in
melancholy orbit. And it isn't yours.
What do you do when your luggage doesn't turn up at the end of a
scheduled flight? More important, what do you expect the airline to do?
Herald writer Conrad Wilson is a frequent traveller to Italy and a man
who ''knows his rights'' when baggage is delayed (although the carrier's
responsibilities aren't set in concrete by the kind of international
agreement which governs permanently lost or damaged luggage). Even so,
it took him nearly two hours of obstinate negotiation to get action when
he and his family arrived at Milan Malpensa minus suitcases.
Conrad flew to Milan from Edinburgh via Amsterdam, where the luggage
failed to make the connecting KLM flight at Schiphol. His first obstacle
was the absence of any KLM presence at Malpensa, which is Milan's second
airport, and the presence of ''an Italian bureaucrat'' who was probably
KLM's handling agent. This less-than-helpful gentleman said merely that
their luggage would be delivered to their Italian address when it
arrived on the next KLM flight 24 hours later.
Conrad was dissatisfied. He spent some time trying and failing to
contact KLM, thus missing the overland connections to his destination
near Lake Como. Eventually he managed to squeeze out of ''the
bureaucrat'' three overnight toilet bags and the authorisation of a taxi
to their destination. No mean achievement. The next day he did even
better, and got KLM's authority to spend US$100 a head on clothes.
But at what cost to time and temper? In a series of letters which
Conrad later exchanged with KLM the airline pointed out that expenses
for emergency supplies of knickers and socks when luggage is delayed are
made ''on a goodwill basis'', as are expenses for taxi fares. They had
no explanation as to why their goodwill had been so difficult to
extract.
Most airlines do make similar provisions on the same basis, and
passengers who find themselves wide-eyed and bagless at the end of a
journey should expect and ask for the following: overnight kits if there
are no other flights to reunite you with your luggage until the
following day, limited expenses for ''first need'' essentials after the
first 24 hours, and the authorisation of further expenses, usually up to
#100 per person, if your baggage still hasn't turned up after 72 hours.
If it never turns up then you're into a different ball game. Under an
agreement called the Hague Protocol airlines are legally required to
compensate you for lost or damaged luggage -- but if you read the small
print concerning baggage liability on your air ticket you'll find this
doesn't count for much. I quote: ''For most international travel
(including domestic portions of international journeys) the liability
limit is US$20 per kilo for checked baggage''.
In other words, if they lose your suitcase and all its contents, and
the case is packed to the 20-kilo weight limit for economy travel, you
can expect something in the region of a paltry #258 to replace the lot;
which is an extremely good reason for taking out the travel insurance
which the EU now requires us to have before we leave the country.
* ANYONE who has ever been to a country where the currency is weak
knows that its commercial classes will prefer to accept almost any
banknote which isn't their own. Which is why I find the following
information from the Capital Group worrying: when London's new People's
Palace restaurant opens this spring at the Royal Festival Hall customers
will be able to pay in any of the major world-wide currencies . . .
Is there something we should be told about the strength of the pound?
* HOLIDAY companies conduct surveys almost as often as they conduct
holidaymakers for two reasons. One is to help their marketing people
attract more customers and the other is to get their name in the papers.
Well, I've got news for First Choice, whose latest database of holiday
habits is lying on my desk: the second strategy sometimes works.
It even works when the survey is a masterpiece of meaningless
information like this one, which has investigated the ''first (and last)
choices'' -- get it? -- of holidaymakers from the North of England and
Scotland. However pointless or banal or self-promoting, a percentage
finding is hard to resist.
The least surprising thing about Gallup's findings for the company is
that there are no surprises. Price is the first consideration for 24% of
Northerners and Scots when selecting a holiday, while 20% cite the
country they wish to visit as the priority. Once in the air, just under
a third prefer talking to their friends and relatives to reading, while
20% enjoy the in-flight magazine. The most unpopular in-flight activity
is going to the loo.
Once there, what's the first course of action? Even Scots and
Northerners choose unpacking or checking out the accommodation (70%)
over heading for the bar (9%) or going for a swim (4%); and for all the
much-advertised stress of seasonal travelling only 2% admit to engaging
in argument when they first arrive.
And what's the first thing most of us do when we get back home again?
Why, reach for the teapot, of course; which is what happens in our house
until we remember there's no milk. The First Choice survey has no
intelligence on what its selected holidaymakers choose to do about that.
* HERE'S one way for the single traveller to avoid those single-room
supplements, although it does involve taking out a contract with a blind
date. Insight International Tours has introduced room-sharing in a
systematic way which, with a bit of luck, should minimise the social
risks.
Their ''Twinshare'' scheme invites anyone travelling alone to give
advance details of themselves and their interests and the company will
try to match them with a compatible room-mate of the same sex. There's a
twin advantage: twin rooms are almost always superior to single ones,
and the saving is substantial. Tour prices, saving up to #225 per week
on single supplements, start at #725 for an eight-day tour of Turkey.
More information from Insight on 0800 393 393.
* ROMANTIC idea for fast movers: Skybus Holidays have highly
competitive deals on three-night breaks to Florence and Venice for
February 10-12. (Valentine's weekend, dumbo.) Accommodation at a choice
of three hotels is free, and ex-London return flights and transfers cost
#199 per person. More information from Skybus Holidays on 0171 373 6055.

Derek Jarman. CHROMA (Vintage, #5.99).
* AS the final chapter of Aids confronted him with the dying of the
light, the almost blind Derek Jarman composed this fragmentary
meditation on colour -- its usages in art and literature and its social
and historical meanings, as well as a memoir of the role colour had
played in his own life up until his final film Blue. The result is like
listening to a rambling but riveting old man illuminating the dusk with
the wattage of his super-acute senses. Ranging through philosophy,
poetry, and science, he ponders the Proustian powers of ''yellow hot as
mustard, viridian skies, achromatic greys'', searching his dying mind
for memories and miracles. Quixotic yet stately, Chroma completes
Jarman's singular voyage through the realm of the senses.
Adam Sisman. A J P TAYLOR: A Biography (Mandarin, #7.99).
* IT almost smacks of literary effrontery that Adam Sisman's first
book should be a work of such elegant excellence: this is the biography
that A J P Taylor deserves, though perhaps not entirely the one he would
have wanted. As well as detailing his highly influential life of ideas
and ideologies, the author also deals with the distinguished historian's
less admirable traits, such as his pettiness, his toadying to
Beaverbrook, and his self-aggrandisement. The result is a clear-eyed and
immensely readable biography, a spot-on diagnosis of the hardening of
political arteries in the slow but apparently inevitable sidling from
Left to Right which was Taylor's public life.
Carl Hiaasen. THE CARL HIAASEN OMNIBUS: Tourist Season/Double
Whammy/Skin Tight (Picador, #8.99).
* WITH only five crime novels to his name, Carl Hiaasen is already
receiving the omnibus treatment usually reserved for the likes of
Hammett, Chandler, and James M Cain -- and why not? Hip, happening, and
probably the funniest crime writer writing in America today, Hiaasen is
in a satirical league of his own. Whether dealing with incompetent
eco-terrorists in Tourist Season or the TV evangelists who turn out to
be far from a fisherman's friend in Double Whammy, he creates in his
South Florida milieu some of the flakiest flakes in the world through
whom to vent his spleen on the corrupt go-getters of big-money
boosterism. Buy now, before your friends start telling you they
discovered him first.
J G Ballard. CRASH (Vintage, #5.99).
* THE reputation of Crash has accelerated dramatically since its
publication in 1973, placing it alongside Naked Lunch and A Clockwork
Orange in the cult novels on the student's shelves. Even more rarified
than those in its skewed vision of personal wish-fulfilment, Crash is a
parable for an age in which technology gratifies every need, including
the most primal. Here, the protagonist fantasises and plans a final car
crash that will satiate a sexual appetite inspired by the fetishistic
fantasies of a now-dead friend. Persuasive and ruthless in his argument,
Ballard warns against the ''brutal, erotic, and over-lit realm that
beckons to us from the margins of the technological landscape'' in a
novel that entrances as it disturbs.
Jan Harold Brunvand. THE BABY TRAIN (Norton, #7.95).
* THE fact that an American university has a faculty devoted to the
analysis of urban myth sounds almost like an urban myth itself: The Tale
of the Woefully Misspent Tax-Payer's Dollar, perhaps. But there is, and
the storyteller-in-chief of alternative folklore has compiled a fifth
volume of its findings. Awash with FOAF (Friend Of A Friend) yarns and
comparative versions of classic modern legends from around the world,
The Baby Train is an academic but light-hearted forage into the roots of
hyperbolic hearsay. Compared to classics like The Kentucky Fried Rat or
Spiders Beneath The Skin, however, most of these unlikely stories seem
quaintly anecdotal, revealing how urban myths invariably spring from a
combination of jokes, local legend, and half-remembered fiction.
Michael Kelly. MARTYRS' DAY: Chronicle Of A Small War (Picador,
#6.99).
* YOU may forget the title of this book, but it's unlikely that you'll
forget the scenes it describes, because Michael Kelly looks at things
with the eye of a poet and listens to people with the ear of a
playwright. During 1991 through 1992 he travelled to every country
involved in the Gulf war, and the book he created from his travels is no
whoopee-aren't-I-brave collection of journalistic dispatches but a work
of genuine literary power. He was there. This is how he and the people
he talked to felt about the destruction being wrought. This is how it
was -- and is -- and it is the best book about war for years.

THE text to an exhibition of modern Scottish architecture on show in
London reads: ''This apparent malaise in recent Scottish architecture is
symptomatic of an architecture that had lost its faith in its ability to
raise the human spirit to a level above the merely pragmatic . . .''
In the cool Swedish-inspired elegance of Grey Wornum's 1934 building
at the headquarters of the Royal Institute of British Architects in
Portland Place can be seen the work of 18 Scottish architectural
practices.
To bring the attention of myopic London to what is going on north of
the Border is obviously a worthwhile enterprise in itself, but what is
interesting is that the organisers -- Henry McKeown and Ian Alexander,
two bright young architects working for Glasgow firm Elder &amp; Cannon --
feel it is necessary for Scottish architecture to reassert, itself. Made
in Scotland by Architects is the title of the exhibition, no doubt to
distinguish the buildings illustrated from so many depressing new
structures in Scotland.
McKeown and Alexander want to show the work of practices ''who have
attempted to break away from an architecture of neutrality'' and they --
like me -- feel that what is wrong in Scotland is symbolised by the way
in which St Peter's College at Cardross by Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia ''has
been allowed to disintegrate''.
There are honourable exceptions, but the half-century after the 1930s
was a pretty dismal period in Scottish architectural history. What is
extraordinary is how many great British architects of the eighteenth and
nineteenthcenturies were Scottish: James Gibbs, Colin Campbell, waves of
Adams and Playfairs, two Hamiltons, William Burn, ''Greek'' Thomson,
Rowand Anderson, Norman Shaw, J J Stevenson, James MacLaren, Charles
Rennie Mackintosh, and J A Campbell, to name but few, together with
Thomas Tait, Basil Spence, and Jack Coia to take us into the present
century.
Perhaps it was the architectural manifestation of the tendency which
enabled the Scots to run the British Empire by providing soldiers,
administrators, and engineers. What is certain is that just as the end
of the Empire coincided with the collapse of the Scottish economy as
well as bringing the Union into question, so the post-imperial decades
have witnessed a melancholy contraction of our architectural genius.
This decline, this evident loss of confidence is, of course,
inextricably linked with economics. Architecture needs money and
Victorian Glaswegians, for instance, spent lots on architecture --
magnificently and wisely. But in recent years Scots have developed --
possibly of necessity -- a culture of cheapness, making a virtue of
spending as little as possible on buildings.
There is no reason why this should be terminal, not least because
Scotland seems to have been out of step with the times. For this has
been the century of small, confident nations which have produced a
distinctive and high-quality national architecture -- Norway, Denmark,
and, above all, Finland which, despite its bleak landscape and cold
climate, has produced a modern architecture which is the admiration of
Europe.
So why cannot Scotland, also with a population of five million, do as
well? Perhaps the work on show in London represents the beginning of a
long-overdue architectural renaissance.
The exhibition raises the question about how a national modern
architecture is created in a country like Scotland. I believe there are
two approaches. One is to identify a national, historical vernacular
style and to reinterpret it with originality; this is what Eliel
Saarinen did in Finland and his contemporary, Mackintosh, succeeded in
doing in Scotland. The other is to adopt an international style and to
interpret it with particular brilliance, giving it a distinct local
accent. In this, the inescapable challenge of the Scottish climate is
usually a help.
Both approaches are evident in the work on display in London, but most
practices seem to favour the second. Anxious to break away from the
''architecture of neutrality'', the various structurally expressive
styles currently fashionable in Europe are adopted by the young
architect contributors. But what is cheering is that aspects of a real
Scottish tradition can be detected. These concern urbanism. Scotland is
a very urban country in that a high proportion of the population lives
in or around the two great cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. With
Aberdeen they demonstrate that the Scots -- unlike the English -- have
displayed a peculiar genius in the creation of cities.
I find it significant that many of the younger practices represented
here grew out of tenement rehabilitation into designing new housing,
often for housing associations. Such work represents the welcome return
to the urban tradition of the tenement after the anti-urban, or
anti-street phase of high-rise housing. It is an area of architectural
practice in which Scotland is strong. It is evident in Glasgow, where
the recent buildings worth looking at are not concert-halls and
exhibition centres but housing schemes. One thing which clinched the
City of Architecture and Design award for Glasgow was the judges' visit
to the Reidvale Housing scheme in Duke Street -- designed by Elder &amp;
Cannon.
So 1999 may herald a Scottish architectural renaissance. The award
should help in generating a climate in which architectural quality is
regarded not as a luxury but a necessity.

AFTER a couple of visits to the various Colorado resorts, I had
decided never to bother crossing the Atlantic again to ski. Because, for
me, skiing in North America has always been a bit of a let-down.
Scots skiers, familiar with the huge and varied ski areas of Europe
and seduced by the advertised attractions of the States should know that
the much-vaunted Coloradan destinations like Vail, Beaver Creek,
Breckenridge, and so on, can't live by comparison.
The first disappointment is the Rockies themselves. Around these areas
they don't really look that impressive. The problem is that when you
arrive in Denver you are already a mile high. So the ski hills
themselves, as the locals accurately call them, look a bit like the
Campsies with trees. Thus Vail's summit elevation of 11,250ft is
deceptive, as the village is already at 8200ft. Compare this with
Zermatt, where the height of the top station is 12,529ft, soaring up
from the village at 5313ft.
The other problem is the cold. I have skied all over Europe in every
winter month and have never experienced cold like Colorado, where the
temperature at the bottom of the lift can be as low as -20[DEG]C, even
in March. And it feels every degree of that with the wind whipping
through the ski suit as the chair lifts grind up to the top. That's
another thing. Because of the short vertical rises that predominate
there are very few cable cars, gondolas or ''bubbles'' where at least
you can avoid cooling down too dramatically between runs. And the
so-called ''high-speed quad'' chairs move slower than in Europe. Or is
that just my imagination?
The thing that the States have got going for them is the level of
service. The lift staff chat and joke with you as they help you on and
off. A long yodel from the surly farm boys who sit in their Alpine huts
and watch you fall off the drag. Another plus is the food which in the
hotels is better, cheaper, and more plentiful than France or Austria.
You can even try a Japanese breakfast. But don't. Just the look of raw
fish at six in the morning turns your stomach. The mountain restaurants
provide better fare at lower prices than the Alps, although I did miss
my ''rusti mit ei''.
So, for someone wanting the vast variety of Tignes, Portes du Soleil,
or Davos -- my favourite -- or the challenges of St Anton's Kandahar or
Verbier's Tortin, my advice is to stay in Europe. The Alps provide the
best skiing in the world. Do not be seduced by American hype into
believing otherwise. In fact, the runs are mostly over-rated, with their
blacks warranting only red. And, remember, you have had to endure a
tiring flight and jet-lag to reach them.
The only argument for going is to say you've been there, skied it,
fallen there. If you find that overwhelming then go to Alberta in
Canada. Not that skiing is any better than in Colorado. It isn't. The
runs are still short with lift time outweighing skiing by a factor of at
least three. But the mountains! They would allow any Canadian Crocodile
Dundee to say in Vail ''That's not a mountain. This is a mountain'',
pointing to any one of a dozen peaks which dominate the Banff/Lake
Louise area.
But, it's still cold. I'm one of those skiers who go on holiday to ski
and only to ski. But on the last afternoon even I was defeated by the
bitter wind that tore through two pairs of thermals. For the first time
ever I left the slopes early and went for a drive along the Trans-Canada
Highway from Lake Louise west.
The pay-off was that I saw 40 minutes of the most spectacular scenery
I have ever driven through. Mountains, Gordon, Stephen, Vaux, Cathedral,
Goodsir, soar to over 10,000ft from an endless carpet of trees. The
half-frozen, spruce-lined river hugs the road for company all through
the passes. In the freezing cold, flurries of snow, and swooping cloud,
the car seemed exposed and vulnerable as the logging trucks swept by. I
was awe-inspired and intimidated.
How the Scots built a railway through that terrain 100 years ago is a
tribute to Victorian self-belief and skill. In Kicking Horse Pass the
gradients were so steep that runaway trains were common. So, the
engineers drove the Spiral Tunnels into the rock to allow safer passage.
The ends of the tunnels are visible from a specially designed
view-point. The trains are so long that the front often emerges from the
tunnel above before the rear has entered the tunnel mouth below.
But nature is even more impressive. The Canadians, recognising this,
made Banff a National Park decades ago. Conservation is taken seriously
and practised sensibly with development carefully planned and
controlled. So the tourist infrastructure doesn't destroy the tourist
attractions. But it was still a surprise, when driving down the Bow
Valley Parkway back to Banff, to be confronted by two wolves loping up
the snow-covered road. After that the marmots, caribou, elk, and red
squirrels could be taken for granted.
So, the skiing is acceptable, especially if you get the quality of
snow that I got in Sunshine Village, five miles from Banff which itself
is a two-hour drive from Calgary airport. Sunshine, with its on-mountain
hotel, claims 30ft of snow a year. When I skied it in November the snow
had that dry, squeaky quality that allows the skis to run and drags
exhilarating whoops from those curving down the long easy blues. These
slopes have similar length of runs to Lake Louise (where they claim a
total vertical drop of 3250ft) coming down from 8954ft to the main
station at 7082ft. Or you can go all the way down to the car park at
5440ft. But that involves a long 20-minute haul back up. And even then
you're only at the main lift area. With the snow as it was when I was
there it was orth it. At other times it may not be.
Accommodation is plentiful in all price categories. I stayed at the
very best, Chateau Lake Louise, a Canadian Pacific hotel bigger than
Turnberry, but with five restaurants, a couple of shopping arcades, and
that superb service you never experience here. The quality of careful
staff selection and training is evident in every employee from the valet
parking attendants to the knowledgeable guest relations personnel.
When Lord Strathcona's railway company was blazing the trail, it had
its pick of sites. This hotel is in the most spectacular setting,
sitting at the head of a medium-sized lake looking into a fold of
mountains. The lake had just frozen over the day I arrived and as I
walked tentatively on it the canoes had been stored for the winter and
they were preparing the curling rinks.
I have promised to go back to Alberta. Probably not for the skiing.
But I must see those mountains in the summertime. And assess the precise
shade of those green, green lakes.
I might also check out the golf courses.

Housing associations have been one of prime movers in the regeneration
of Glasgow, and now some want to commission only the best while others
want to take on the design function themselves. Jennifer Cunningham
reports
WHEN the panel charged with awarding the title of City of Architecture
and Design gathered in the old prison gate mission off Duke Street in
Glasgow's East End, the talk turned technical.
In the stylish committee room of Reidvale Housing Association --
chrome-and-glass table, sliding glass internal shutters and a telling
metaphor for inner-city regeneration -- they met a motley crew of
pensioners, housewives, manual workers, and community activists who like
nothing better than a good-going discussion about design, the uses of
buildings, and how architecture fits into the environment.
The chairman of the judges, Iain Reid, director of combined arts at
the Arts Council, says they were looking for community involvement in
architecture and design and that Glasgow came out of that element very
well. Aware that the involvement of ordinary citizens was a concept
which generated a lot of rhetoric, he said: ''You get a sense from the
way people talk about their projects of how involved they are with the
design. The Year of Architecture and Design should be an opportunity to
celebrate not just buildings but the process.''
Frances McCall, founder member of the Calvay Housing Co-operative in
Easterhouse, is among the many who hope to seize that opportunity. ''It
is time the city recognised that Easterhouse is the gateway to Glasgow.
It is the first thing people coming from the south see from the motorway
as they drive in and the first impact is made by the old, monolithic
blocks.''
That view is echoed by many of Glasgow's citizens and also by the man
responsible for distributing more than #250m a year of public money to
people like Mrs McCall and her colleagues in housing associations
throughout Scotland. Jim Hastie, director of development at Scottish
Homes, said: ''Old Edinburgh Road could be just as imposing a boulevard
at the eastern side of the city as Great Western Road is at the west
side. 1999 should celebrate the process of architecture and design and
not be about a one-off celebrity building.''
The process of democratic architecture has not always been smooth.
Calvay was one of the first tenants' co-operatives to transfer the model
of the inner-city housing associations to the peripheral estates, but
Frances recalls that the idea was greeted with grave suspicion 11 years
ago.
''When the council came to us to ask us to form a co-op, people said:
''No that's your job, why should we do it for you?'' Then after a public
meeting we realised that the only way to improve things would be to do
them ourselves.
''The first public meeting we held was absolutely mobbed and from that
there was enough enthusiasm to get together a steering group to make
things happen. I think the professionals were absolutely gobsmacked
every time they came to a meeting. We quickly found that sitting round
the table we had all sorts of useful talents. Many people in the area
were unemployed but they still had skills.''
Eleven years on, she is Frances McCall MBE and has just been appointed
for a third term to the board of Scottish Homes which stakes millions of
pounds on the expertise of people like her.
As you drive up the hill and look down on Darnley, the snaking
concrete blocks have all the hallmarks of a prison, imposed on the
landscape in a gesture of authority, containing not inviting, and
crushing any hint of individuality. They were built as council housing,
of course, but long after Glasgow was supposed to have learned the
lessons of the urban deserts it had created in Easterhouse, Castlemilk,
and Drumchapel, it was still plonking concrete blocks in the middle of
open countryside. Darnley was the last fling of 1970s municipal
mindlessness, before the city revolted.
To be fair, there was also revolt in the city chambers. Tenants in
Darnley were among the many able to vote for a new landlord in recent
years -- and opted by a decisive majority to transfer to a housing
association.
Those who formed Glen Oaks Housing Association knew exactly what was
needed after living with the problems at first hand for years. To
provide a degree of privacy the architect had designed the blocks so
that while people lived next door to each other, the entrances to their
houses were at different levels. The effect was that although families
moved in within days of one another, it took weeks before they found out
who their neighbours were.
The balconies which ran the length of each block inevitably became
roller-skating and skateboarding runs. Agnes Conway, the association's
secretary, shudders as she remembers the unholy din produced by kids in
roller skates going over the steel bridges which linked the decks.
At the end of last year, the first phase was completed and 38 tenants
moved into a completely transformed block, whose neat brick porches and
individual gardens make it look like a row of terraced houses.
Since its beginnings three years ago, the association has been
involved in other community activities, notably the gala week and
after-school care for children and has co-opted such as the minister and
head teacher.
That is a typical example of how housing associations become a focus
of community life, according to Lynn Ewing, who has been on the
committee of Govanhill Housing Association for the past 15 years.
Ignoring raised eyebrows from younger people, she says: ''In some ways
they perform the role that the church performed when I was young in
generating a community spirit.''
Govanhill Housing Association was established as a direct response to
the threat of demolition of the area. Again collective anger was the
fuel for an extensive programme of rehabilitation. Lynn Ewing did not
live within the association's boundaries, but was known as the organiser
of a successful scheme to landscape back courts in another part of
Govanhill and found herself involved.
''I was very angry when I discovered the state of housing that people
were living in. It may seem strange, but although I did not live very
far away I just did not know that there were all these sub-standard
houses with people living without inside toilets in Govanhill.
''The association really grew from people's anger at the proposals to
scatter the community, but they certainly had no concept at the
beginning in 1974 that it would eventually become a major landlord
owning nearly 2000 houses,'' she said.
Not merely a landlord. As with most housing associations, success with
rehab led to new-build schemes -- at first to fill in the gap sites
where the land had often been derelict for many years, but meeting the
needs of the site soon led to meeting the needs of the people.
Further evolution of a housing association with its roots deep in the
community is that it is now considering extending its provision to
include furnished accommodation for homeless people. Architectural and
environmental considerations are as important as the social ones,
however. To achieve the best, they held a competition for a new block at
Annandale Square and have a bold, stylish group of buildings offering
balconies and large windows while keeping the traditional tenemental
perspective.
Roystonhill has become Upper Merchant City in the patter which will
have no truck with estate agents' pomposities.
It is a classic example of design that looked fine on the drawing
board but failed the test of daily living. To accommodate the steeply
sloping site, some blocks had an extra storey at the rear which was
largely vacant space, used for bin stores and car shelters but with all
the usual problems of semi-communal areas.
When the tenants made their own decisions about how to use the space,
via the James Nisbet Co-op, it was incorporated into some ground-floor
houses, which gave them both an extra room and a private back door.
Twenty-five years ago the answer to the hilly site was to build
retaining walls and then construct the houses on an artificially flat
site. While that has obvious advantages, they are more likely to accrue
to the architect and construction company than to the residents, who had
to negotiate their way between high walls with dark corners in a
concrete environment which offered almost nothing in the way of living
plants.
The resident-led solution is to step housing down the contours of the
ground, giving a natural feel to the structure. They expect the costs to
be roughly comparable.
As a fully mutual co-operative, they give people as much say as
possible in the design of the houses they will live in. The co-ops's
director, Laurence O'Boyle cited the most striking example: ''When we
were glassing round what had previously been open balconies, a couple of
tenants said they would prefer to keep them open -- and as it happened
we could incorporate that into the design by placing them on the same
floor to achieve a symmetry at the front of the building.''
Charlie Lunn, the vice-chairman, opted for a conservatory and says his
wife is never out of it. His flat at the end of the block also benefits
from the lug built on to soften the block architecture, which in the
Lunn's case gives extra space for a table and chairs in the living room.
He reckons many people would be willing to pay far more than his rent
of #107 a month for for a flat with two bedrooms, living room, and
kitchen with gas central heating, double glazing, and a secure entry
system within walking distance of the city centre.
Equally close to the city centre is John Butterley's stamping-ground.
He seems the archetypal wee man in a bunnet, but is known around
Dennistoun as The Godfather, because for 20 years he has chaired
Reidvale Housing Association.
Like Govanhill, Reidvale is a long-established association which has
started to fight the threat of the community being scattered and the
buildings demolished. ''It has always been a very bolshie association,''
said its director, Rob Joiner. The neat streets of cleaned sandstone
tenements, careful streetscaping and traffic control are a monument to
successful rehabilitation, but the well-equipped indoor and outdoor
playground where children report any stray adults to the staff is
testament to a vibrant community.
They are especially proud, however, of the newly completed part of
their overall plan, an entire block bounded by three streets and
providing ground-floor shops as well as flats of varying sizes. It was
an exacting brief for architects Elder and Cannon, but as project
architect, Tom Connolly puts it: ''The best buildings come from informed
clients.'' There is really no valid excuse in Glasgow now for anything
but the best.

RED-handed -- caught in the very act; the red blood still on the
hands. This descriptive phrase now has such common usage in Scotland for
all sorts of mundane situations from raiding the fridge to trying to
skip your fare on the bus, that it's easy to forget that it once carried
with it the sanction of almost instantaneous execution.
Historical examples illustrating how this law was applied are fairly
thin on the ground but the most dramatic by far has for its setting the
''broomy slopes'', where Edinburgh's New Town now stands, on a tranquil
Sunday afternoon in 1717.
Robert Irvine, the principal character in this harrowing tale, was a
student minister and tutor with the Gordon family, merchants who owned a
villa to the north of Edinburgh. Irvine, who had the two Gordon sons as
pupils, was noted for his academic achievements but the tutor was also,
ominously, said to be of a ''melancholic disposition''. In fact, it was
later claimed that he had an obsession with the idea of predestination.
The tutor, according to the criminal record, took a fancy to one of
the servant girls but was seen by his two pupils ''taking some liberties
with her'' and was reported to the master of the house. Although after
being reprimanded it seemed that the matter was closed Irvine brooded on
the incident. According to reports the event ''began to assume
proportions beyond reality and raised in his heart an insane thirst for
revenge'', or as another correspondent of the time suggests: ''His whole
soul became filled with the blackest demons of rage''.
For three days he schemed and on the first Sunday his chance came. The
Gordons went with their daughter to spend the afternoon with a friend
across the city. After going to church as usual with his charges, Irvine
took the boys across the open countryside beyond the Nor' Loch (the site
today of Princes Street Gardens and Waverley Station).
The account of the next few minutes is chilling. Apparently, while the
boys ran about gathering flowers near the location of where today we
find St Andrew Square, Irvine, now ''a fiend-transformed man'', sat
''whetting a knife wherewith to cut short their days''.
Calling the boys to him, he told them they had to be punished for
informing on him, but although they ran for it Irvine overtook them and,
while keeping one boy down on the grass with his knee, he cut the
other's throat and then dispatched his brother in the same manner.
It's clear Irvine had no plans to conceal his crime, the deed having
been committed in daylight and in an open location. In fact, one
eagle-eyed gentleman, enjoying his evening walk across on the Castle
Hill, is said to have ''obtained a tolerably perfect view'' of the crime
and immediately raised the alarm. Irvine, who had unsuccessfully tried
to cut his own throat, ran from his pursuers to the Water of Leith
planning to drown himself but was captured and thrown into prison.
Hereabouts the summary process for murderers ''taken with the red
hand'' came into play. Next day he was brought before the judge of the
district, the Baron Bailie of Broughton, tried, and executed at
Greenside within 24 hours. Irvine seemed at the end to have regretted
the dastardly act and composed a message seeking forgiveness from the
bereaved parents. This, we learn, they ''kindly'' gave. The killer's
body was unceremoniously dumped in a nearby quarry hole.
So be warned, that next night-time raid on the fridge should not be
undertaken lightly.

THEY make their own marmalade at Ballathie House Hotel. A blend of
Seville oranges which some guests buy to take home. Chief
marmalade-maker is Mrs ''Mac'' Borrie, a local cook and baker who
becomes part of the kitchen team for a few hours each day to boil jams,
bake breads, and generally add her homely expertise to the hotel
kitchen. Today she has been making a rosemary and apple jelly which head
chef Kevin MacGillivary will use with his roast meats. He has made a
steamed pudding with her marmalade.
To make a success of this idea of rich steamed pudding at the end of a
meal, the pudding is no bigger than half a small orange. It is
surrounded by an egg sauce flavoured with Macallan whisky, a scoop of
ice-cream, and a few slices of fresh orange on the side.
While most marmalade will inevitably find itself spread on hot toast,
creative cooks have always investigated its potential as an intense
flavouring for cakes, puddings, and sauces. Mrs Dalgairns (circa 1789)
put a tablespoon of minced marmalade mixed with a glass of brandy and
the juice of a lemon through a couple of pints of cream to make a
sumptuous pudding which she called Caledonian Cream. Just the marmalade,
brandy, and lemon juice on its own, with additional sweetening, was also
used as a sauce.
Rich fruit cakes and gingerbreads were regularly laced with spoonfuls
of marmalade. A steamed marmalade pudding was another old-fashioned
favourite; usually the marmalade was in the base of the pudding bowl --
trickling down the sides as it was turned out.
This vintage pudding has enjoyed a revival recently. A pudding club
has been formed with enthusiasts meeting for pudding dinners while
up-to-the-minute supermarkets have made it their business to manufacture
cute replicas of The Original steamed pudding (at a price) for
interested pudding fanciers.
But to achieve any distinction, in the way of marmalade flavour it is
necessary to use a Seville orange marmalade. The Seville orange tree
(citrus aurantium), which decorates the pavements of the Spanish city,
is not grown just for its oranges, but also for the perfume from its
flowers, leaves, and fruit.
RECIPES
CALEDONIAN CREAM
Ingredients for 4:
2 large sweet Spanish navel oranges
10 fl oz (300 ml) whipping cream
2 heaped tablespoons Seville marmalade
2 - 3 tablespoons brandy
lemon juice to taste
sugar to taste
Method: Strip the zest from the oranges with a zester into the bowl of
a food processor. Cut off all the white pith and remove each segment of
the orange with a sharp knife avoiding the white pith. Squeeze out any
remaining juice from the leftover pith. Put in the base of a glass
serving dish. Put the marmalade and brandy into processor with the zest
and blend until smooth (this can be used as a sauce: see below).
Add all but two teaspoonfuls to cream. Mix and add sugar and lemon
juice. Pour on top of oranges. Sprinkle the remaining teaspoonfuls on
top and swirl with a knife. Serve chilled.
MACGILLIVARY'S MARMALADE PUDDING
Ingredients for 2-pint buttered pudding bowl, 6 - 8 servings
For marmalade topping:
1 tablespoon Seville marmalade
12 large raisins
For sponge:
4 oz (125 g) unsalted butter
4 oz (125 g) caster sugar
2 tablespoons Seville marmalade
finely chopped zest of 1 lemon
2 eggs
6 oz (175 g) sponge self-raising flour
milk to mix
Method: Prepare pot for steaming. Fill with hot water to come halfway
up pudding bowl. Bring to the boil.
Put marmalade and raisins into prepared bowl. Cream butter and sugar
until light, mix in the marmalade and lemon zest.
Beat in the eggs one at a time. Finally fold in the flour.
Adjust the consistency to soft dropping with some milk. Put into
pudding bowl, cover with lid or greased foil. Steam for 1-1[1/2] hours,
checking water level occasionally. Turn out and serve with brandy,
marmalade, and lemon sauce (see above) and ice cream or kumquats
preserved in Cointreau.
STICKY MARMALADE CAKE-CUM-PUDDING
Ingredients for an 8" square 2-3" deep tin to make a pudding for 6:
4 oz (125 g) butter
8 oz (250 g) golden syrup
2 oz (50 g) dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons thick-cut Seville marmalade
2 size-2 eggs
5 fl oz (150 ml) milk
4 oz (125 g) sifted self-raising sponge flour
4 oz (125 g) sifted wholemeal flour
1 teaspoon each ground ginger, cinnamon
half a teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
For Sticky Topping, heat together until the butter melts:
1 oz (25 g) butter
3 tablespoons soft brown sugar
the juice of one large lemon
Method: Put the butter, syrup, sugar, and marmalade into a pan and
warm slightly to melt the butter. Beat the eggs and milk together. Mix
the flour, ginger, cinnamon, and bicarbonate of soda. Make a well in the
centre and add all the liquid. Mix to a smooth batter and pour into tin.
Bake 325F/160C/gas 3 for 40-50 minutes or until a skewer comes out
clean.
While still in the tin brush or pour over half the topping.
Leave for 10 minutes. Turn out of tin and pour over remaining topping.
Serve with ice-cream. To use as a cake, wrap in clingfilm while still
hot to preserve moisture and keep for 24 hours to allow flavours to
mature.

Waxing lyrical on his ideal hostelry, Andrew McKay introduces a new
weekly column for the dedicated beer drinker
FOR me the pub is a place of retreat, perhaps even a sanctuary. I go
not to hide but to fall in with friends who by the nature of things are
in pursuit of a good pint. We may not share the same political views,
support the same football team, or be of the same religion but we are
commonly joined in a pub that is to our liking. I look forward to a
night in the pub with the prospect of good company and illuminating
conversation.
To be selfish, I would prefer it if every pub sold a wide selection of
real ales or at worst stuck with a couple of regulars and wheeled in a
guest or two. A smattering of esoteric bottles might even add a touch of
spice on a dull Tuesday.
I can just about remember the pub where the barmen wore white aprons
and where pint glasses glided along the silver drip tray below a range
of gleaming taps. A pint of mixed was a common cry. Sadly, that
tradition of public house, and more important, its beer, left us for a
number of years.
Without the perseverance of Camra (Campaign for Real Ale), I would not
enjoy my visits to the pub nearly so much. What they have done for the
beer drinker has been to raise the awareness among the national and
independent breweries that there is a demand for ale with a real taste.
Camra is still crusading for more real ale in pubs and its activities
have broadened in the pursuit of quality and value for the drinker.
Their pleas to a degree have been heeded and most brewers, recognising
the growing demand and associated commercial potential, now produce a
cask-conditioned (real) ale.
The Guest Beer Law of 1990 allows tenants of brewers with more than
2000 pubs to stock a cask-conditioned ale of their choosing, in addition
to any guest beer supplied by the controlling brewery. Small brewers
seized the opportunity to sell their products to such outlets; however,
the big boys fought back with their own ales and many of the smaller
breweries have since closed.
Yes, cask-conditioned ales do take more care in handling and make life
a wee bit harder for the barman whose skill has been diluted to that of
a techno-tapman. But with the potential of a new generation of beers and
a generation of drinkers with a developing taste for real ale on the
horizon, the return of the old skills and expertise may not be far away.
But to our tale.
Haggis, neeps, and tatties washed down with a glass or two of ale.
Poetry readings, an Immortal Memory, boisterous singing and dancing on
tables. An evening of bacchanalia, the Burns Supper. Perhaps there are
more sombre ceremonies to the bard's memory but for me this was how it
was and amid the merriment there was still time to absorb the gravity of
the evening.
And to contemplate. Would Burns approve our actions? What kind of
night out would he have had? What did he drink?
The final years of Burns' life were spent in Dumfriesshire where as an
exciseman he covered a large area of Upper Nithsdale. Before his move to
the town of Dumfries in 1793, he lived at Ellisland Farm and on the
occasions when the weather was bad he would rest for the evening in the
town's Globe Inn.
This inn had been in existence since 1610 and became the poet's howff
until his death. At that time three other large pubs were near the
Globe: the George, the Bell, and the Jerusalem. In total the town had 75
smaller premises licensed for the sale of liquor which amounted to one
for every 90 persons who lived in the parish.
In those days ales were dark, rich and sweet, fruity, with a
suggestion of treacle which was probably due to the many types of sugar
used in the brewing process.
A leading brewer of today who was around at that time was William
Younger. Founded in 1749 it became McEwan in 1856, then Scottish Brewers
in 1931, and finally in 1960 and to this day Scottish and Newcastle.
Another was Guinness, born the same year as the poet, making it a very
good year. Guinness achieved dominance as the Irish folk, travellers
all, took the stout into many areas of Britain.
From the 1660s anyone could brew beer in Scotland without a licence,
for sale at fairs, provided the duty was paid in advance. Such people
were called bye-brewers; those who made it a full-time occupation were
common brewers. One part of Burns' job was to collect the duty due
before the beer was sold. However, records show that he had a reputation
for treating dodgers leniently.
But back at the Globe. Our poet has been snowed in again and --
possibly following a few of the wicked smaller glasses -- the resulting
affair with Ann Park, the innkeeper's second-cousin, produces a daughter
Elizabeth, born at Leith in 1791. For the tourists Burns engraved a
verse on a window pane with a diamond stylus.
Today at the Globe the snug bar is a companionable place. A gallery of
coronets, queens, and coronations from Guid Nychburris ceremonies cover
the walls. But those pictorial tales of a recent past are overcome by
strong thoughts of how at one time Burns and his cronies would sit
around a table in this very place and debate issues of the day into the
wee sma' hours.
Among the dozen or so spickets at the Globe are McLay's Thistle,
Belhaven Best and Light, McEwan's 70/- mixed gas. And of course Guinness
is still going strong.
I know not of any brewer who produced a potion for this year's
celebrations, however, next year is the bicentenary of the bard's death
and perhaps there will be some full-bodied winter warmers produced.
Perhaps a Tam o' Shanter or a Holy Willie might go down well.
* Straight glasses should be compulsory, mugs with handles are for tea
drinkers.
* Belgian fruit beers or Trappist ales are ideal companions with a
meal -- restaurants take note.
* Ask for a top-up, the unjustifiable white inch is the most expensive
part of the pint.
* Publicans should respond to the demand for cask-conditioned ale.

THE shore lark is an indecipherable bird. When you see -- or don't see
-- a scatter of these rare wanderers on the sward of a saltmarsh they
are as cryptic as runes. When you try to understand why they nest on
Arctic tundra, Moroccan screes, and Turkish moraines there is no logical
answer. Nor is there much rhyme or reason to the unpredictable arrival
of little parties on remote east coast dunes from year to year. One
fairly constant factor is the sites they choose. Our local foreshore is
the traditional spot for shorelarks in Scotland and two winters ago 11
of them illuminated the winter through until the end of February. None
before, none since.
They foregathered with skylarks and linnets but would fly separately,
speaking their own northern language, bright and brittle; in Finland
this gives them the name ''bell bird''. As they crouched, almost
invisible, you could see the black masks on their yellow faces and the
males' black crown stripes which in spring are swept up into two
diabolic little horns.
Their nearest breeding site is Dovrefjell in southern Norway but in
1977 one or two pairs bred on Scottish hills, reminding us that our
uplands are an ecological extension of Scandinavia. No-one found any
more, but they are wee birds and the hills are big.
Shorelarks' irregularity intensifies that sense of freedom which is a
gift of all wild birds to our pedestrian race. They graced us with their
presence. In the past two empty winters the sharp sun and keen wind have
always populated the shore here with their memory and the foreignness of
the summer whose seeds they searched for and the Norwegian fells on
whose mosses they nest. Every walk may be made magical by the discovery
that they are back.

A remarkable new novel presenting philosophy in a different light has
created a media storm.
Lesley Duncan meets its author
FANCY a crash course in the history of Western philosophy? More than
500,000 Germans have already bitten the intellectual bullet by buying an
extraordinary new novel by the Norwegian writer, Jostein Gaarder. It is
being translated into 15 more languages.
Sophie's World -- no connection with that film of the Holocaust,
Sophie's Choice -- has just been published in Britain and, if media hype
is any measure, will make an impact even on the cerebrally challenged
British public.
Jostein Gaarder's stroke of genius is to wrap his philosophical
dissertation in a beguiling Alice-in-Wonderland style story. In
14-year-old Sophie he offers a modern heroine as sparky and inquisitive
as Lewis Carroll's Victorian missy. His plot not only keeps the reader
agog but is itself an exemplar of the complex nature of reality.
Gaarder is far from the stereotyped image of the philosophical man --
Socrates perhaps, with a dash of Spinoza, Hume, and Kant? Clad in black,
with blond hair and beard framing a youthful, round face, he could be a
refugee from Abba. But his intense manner and his fluency (albeit
slightly idiosyncratic) in English reveal his background as a teacher.
Sophie's World draws on his 11 years of teaching philosophy, not to
pupils in a secondary school of the British kind, but to 19 and
20-year-olds in a Bergen boarding-school. His students there included
not only young people going on to study at university but others whom he
disarmingly calls ''school losers''.
His aim was to write an accessible book on the history of philosophy
''not only for teenagers but for adults without a heavy academic
background''.
He started his first draft uncompromisingly: ''The human beings have
always asked philosophical questions . . .'' and instantly realised that
wouldn't do at all. He gave up for ''many months'' and then had the
inspiration of writing his book in fictional form. It was ''much more
fun'' to write this time. ''I think simply that our brain is made for
stories.''
His central character had to be a girl. ''First of all Sophie means
wisdom. There is an old tradition in Europe that wisdom is a female
concept and an old tradition in the Church as well that God has also a
female personality, holy wisdom'' (this may be orthodoxy in enlightened
Norway but could cause steam to issue from the ears of certain
traditionalist churchmen in this country).
Gaarder continues unabashed. ''We may ask why is wisdom considered to
be a female concept? Maybe it's because women, girls, are a little bit
more curious than men. Philosophy has something to do with curiosity,
asking questions, trying to understand something. Often for women it's
very important to try to understand something, while for men it's often
more important to be understood.''
Two things fascinate him, Gaarder says: first, the basic philosophical
questions themselves; they interest him more than the different answers
given by actual thinkers through history. Secondly ''to know my roots in
history''. More than ever today, he thinks, we need some common roots,
some common platform. People today lack historical consciousness, he
says, and quotes Goethe from the beginning of the book: ''He who cannot
draw on 3000 years is living from hand to mouth''.
Gaarder professes himself baffled by the success of Sophie's World.
''It's not an easy book to read. It's not a book for young adults, not a
book for grown-ups; it's not a fiction, it's not a non-fiction, it's
both.'' It would, he thought, ''fall between all stools. Actually it
fell on all the stools!''
He should not be surprised. From the opening paragraph readers are
drawn into a charmed world. Sophie has been walking home from school
with her friend Joanna. They have been discussing robots. ''Joanna
thought the human brain was like an advanced computer. Sophie was not
certain she agreed. Surely a person was more than a piece of hardware?''
(This echoes the intellectual debate Professor Roger Penrose is
currently waging with the proponents of artificial intelligence in
Britain.)
Her credentials as a thoughtful young woman thus established, Sophie
finds a mysterious message in her mailbox. It simply asks ''Who are
you?'' It is followed by a second message which poses the question:
''Where does the world come from?'' In a much-quoted passage her
mysterious interlocutor explains how ''a lot of people experience the
world with the same incredulity as when a magician suddenly pulls a
rabbit out of a hat which has just been shown to them empty . . . As far
as the white rabbit is concerned, it might be better to compare it with
the whole universe. We who live here are microscopic insects existing
deep down in the rabbit's fur. But philosophers are always trying to
climb up the fine hairs of the fur in order to stare right into the
magician's eyes.'' The concept may inadvertently suggest philosophical
fleas; it certainly bites the reader's imagination.
The tale of Sophie, her mentor Alberto, her mysterious doppelganger
Hilde, and Hilde's even more mysterious Army-major father who works with
the UN peacekeeping mission in the Lebanon, gradually unfolds to the
accompaniment of a survey of Western thinking from the early natural
philosophers of Greece to Freud and the twentieth century.
The conscientious reader will initially try to retain everything he or
she reads, from the nuances of belief separating the great Grecian trio,
Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, to why Berkeley took issue with Locke,
or Kierkegaard disapproved of Hegel. Of course it's impossible, as
Gaarder himself readily agrees. The information covered is so extensive
and its inherent nature sometimes so complex (try Spinoza) that the
chatty fictional context can be strained. Ideally, the book should be
read in small dollops, so that its content can be savoured and digested.
An index helps here.
The trouble with the gradualist approach is, of course, that one is
itching to follow the next twist of the plot. It would be unfair to skip
the philosophy for the fiction (or indeed vice versa). Gaarder tackles
cosmic theory (the Big Bang goes well with Christianity) with the same
panache he brings to his description of Sophie's philosophical birthday
party. Compared with this shindig, the Mad Hatter's tea-party is a model
of decorum. But then of course the anarchic event symbolises Sophie's
withdrawl from the Garden of Eden. And she may herself, in any case, be
a figment of some other character's imagination. There is much to
ponder.
But what's this? The writer is suddenly challenging me. ''May I just
ask you one question, if you promise to give me an honest answer?'' Is
he seeking my view on the universe, or maybe just on his book (no
problem if it's the latter -- definitely a straight alpha).
''Do you mind if I smoke?'' he says.
* Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder is published by Phoenix House at
#16.99. A dramatised adaptation of the book will be screened on BBC2's
The Late Show on Monday.

''SAVE IN HIS OWN COUNTRY''
A MONUMENT to the energy and vision of a local businessman stands on
the outskirts of Nairn.   As you head east on the A96 towards Aberdeen,
you will find on your left the sight of a huge, grey farm-horse (a
convincing model) harnessed to a cart, accompanied by a standard
farm-hand in full gear, standing by the roadside. A scattering of
standard, functional buildings of the kind associated with industrial
estates anywhere lies close behind. Among them is a garage with car
sales facilities and workshops, quite close to the main road, and it is
inside one of its huge sheds that something startling awaits.
Things are not all they seem at first glance in Chic Henderson's
garage. In behind the windows of the former car salesroom lies the
reception area of what Henderson calls The Invernairn Mill and Craft
Centre. (Note the absence of the H-word, ''heritage''.)
Henderson has, in fact, built a completed, turn-of-the-century farm,
with all its appurtenances and outbuildings; a handsome water-mill with
storage sheds and threshing mill; a farm courtyard with facilities for
craft shops and craft demonstrations -- and, looking down on it all,
from a height of 15ft or so, an upper gallery (which also houses a
complete collection of farm outhouses on one side, and a museum of farm
implements on the other), a compact, neat, slate-roofed farm-house,
fully furnished and equipped with period items.
All of this extraordinary creation is built of real bricks, masonry,
and mortar -- not a scrap of plastic or papier mache in sight, and all
of the artefacts on display, whether the working water-wheel or the
huge, comprehensive collection of farm tools, are completely genuine.
Chic Henderson says: ''Everything is as authentic as possible. That's
a real water-mill wheel. I got it from a farm at Cawdor where it had
been in use from away back last century. We dismantled it and threw away
the rotten bits and reconstructed it with new timber where necessary.
''We've built the wheel-housing into the floor, and ducted water to
it. It's genuinely worked by the water. It will power the 100-year-old
threshing machine we got from Huntly and a tweed loom I got from
Stornoway. These are on the floor above.''
As a concept and creation, all this is remarkable enough in its own
right. It is when its creator is questioned about its provenance that
further wonders unfold. You see, he hasn't engaged a construction
company to this immense building job, so that he could get on with
running his other businesses; he did it all himself or with the help of
his wife, Ellen, three sons, and a small group of volunteer helpers.
Originally he had intended to hire a contractor to build it all to his
plans, but early on there were financial difficulties. Although the
actual building of the Invernairn Centre has taken 14 months so far, the
original idea goes back three years. But why did a man whose life has
centred on the motor trade not invest in something like a motor museum
instead?
Chic Henderson says: ''I've been in the motor trade for 25 years. I
have garages in Inverness and Nairn, so I'm still committed to the
trade. But I was born in an agricultural community. I was brought up in
it and I enjoyed it.''
He had felt that the motor trade was on the way down in rural areas,
and he looked around for ideas in getting involved in something else.
''The only thing in the area with a secure future, I reckoned, was
tourism. I searched around for ideas for something different. I never
want to follow in somebody else's footsteps. It's got to be original.''
Whether it was this committed individualism that lay at the root of
the problem or not, difficulties began to appear. All three of his
potential backers (Highland Regional Council, the local enterprise
company, and the banks) had to agree individually to help so that the
others would follow. And somebody was always saying no.
After his first setback, he had decided -- perhaps rather rashly -- to
go ahead with his own money and get his Invernairn Centre under way,
hoping that when the sheer scale of what he was offering his home town
(in terms of employment and tourist potential) was apparent, then a
change of heart would follow.
So, he continued until the point was reached when all was well-nigh
complete. It was only then, at the last moment, that his fortunes
turned. The LEC turned up trumps with the promise of a grant, to be
followed by a similar promise of a loan from the regional council. The
banks, too, have beamed a less wintry smile upon him.
Chic, although much relieved and very grateful, is still angry at how
he was put through the hoops, and at how difficult it is for the smaller
operator to get the assistance that larger organisations can command
much more easily.
''I've been living on a sharp edge for three years now, using every
bit of finance I've got myself. It's very difficult to deal with these
negative attitudes. This project is great for this area. It could have
been creating 25 jobs for the last year. And think of its future
potential.''
However, in spite of a fair amount of the financial angst lying behind
him now, there still remains one matter to prevent him sleeping easily:
no evidence of the promised finance has yet dropped through his letter
box.
But Chic Henderson is a man of diverse skills. Questioned about the
appearance of handsome double gates in the archways of the doorways in
his farm courtyard, he replies: ''Oh them? I made them.'' No further
details. Close inspection reveals handsome wrought iron, with a rosette
decoration at the centre of each.
Then, in the farm courtyard area there is another immense Clydesdale
horse. A model again, of course. Originally it and its partner outside
were drawn on a large white sheet with all sorts of lines and
calculations criss-crossing them. A subsequent visit revealed the
skeletal, vague outlines in metal rods of two horses.
A large shaggy hoof was accumulating at one steel extremity. It wasn't
until they were standing there in their complete and realistic form that
he explained how they had been made. Simply, with the help of the scaled
plan, he had built up the layers of cement the horses were made of, over
the steel frame, slapping it on by hand, until he had the shapes he
wanted. Then he painted them.
The Invernairn Mill and Craft Centre has now seen its first wave of
visitors. Its restaurant has filled up, and live entertainment is
planned for special occasions in the future.
Chic Henderson's own credo that drove him on may seem almost naive,
but it is certainly heartfelt and infectious.
''I like to see a smile on people's faces. In the motor trade we don't
often see that. People always come to us with problems, broken-down cars
and so on. This project is purely enjoyment -- an enjoyable experience
for the whole family.
