THE power of pension funds to influence boardroom decisions was
illustrated yesterday in a survey which showed their assets soaring by
almost 10 times over the last 20 years.
They now form the largest single group of investors in the stock
market, controlling around 35% of shares.
The influence of such institutional investors has been highlighted
recently in the controversy over directors' pay which erupted at the
annual meeting last week of British Gas.
Although the board was heavily defeated on a number of resolutions on
a show of hands among small investors, the proxy votes of the
institutions -- like pensions funds and insurance companies -- gave them
an easy victory.
Yesterday's survey from the National Association of Pension Funds
shows the assets of its members ballooning from #8000m in 1975 (the
equivalent of #33bn at 1994 prices) to #300bn last year.
The NAPF has launched a research programme into the whole subject of
how pension funds wield their power over company directors, although
chairman Tom Ross played down the significance of the votes at annual
meetings.
He told a news conference more attention should be given to the
meetings that take place throughout the year between institutional
investors and the companies whose shares they own.
Ann Robinson, who recently joined the NAPF as director-general after
heading the policy unit at the Institute of Directors, said she thought
the issue of pension funds' investment policy was likely to become
increasingly important.
However, she said the trustees of funds were most concerned about the
long-term competence of directors and the success of their companies
rather than one-off debates about boardroom pay.
The trustees had a duty, she said, to seek the best financial rewards
for their members.
The NAPF has been conducting a survey of its members for the last 20
years and today compared latest findings with those presented in 1975.
Mr Ross said one of the main improvements had been the regular
increases given to pensioners to keep them abreast of inflation.
In 1975, nearly a quarter of schemes did not increase pensions while
in the latest survey that applies to less than one scheme in 200.

PAPER and pulp specialist Arjo Wiggins Appleton yesterday announced a
major expansion programme in the key North American market.
It is buying New York papermaker Newton Falls from Stora Kopparberg
Bergslags for #38m as part of a #170m investment in its North American
business over the next 18 to 24 months.
Arjo said the investment will give its US subsidiary, Appleton Papers,
a ''substantial position'' in the expanding North American market.
Newton Falls produces high-quality coated, wood-free papers -- used
mainly in book publishing, annual reports, product sales brochures,
direct mail and catalogues. The mill has an annual production capacity
of 118,000 tonnes and employs 400 people.
Following the acquisition, Arjo plans additional investment at the
Newton Falls mill to upgrade facilities and ''optimise production''. It
also plans to expand the Appleton Papers Combined Locks mill in
Wisconsin through the installation of a coating and finishing operation.
Chairman Cob Stenham said the initiative moves Arjo ''substantially
closer'' to its goal of developing Appleton Papers into one of the
leading specialist manufacturers in North America.

SIR Richard Scott has sharply criticised a newspaper story claiming he
was critical of Baroness Thatcher in his draft report on the
arms-to-Iraq affair.
He believed the report in the Independent ''misrepresents'' his views
on the former Prime Minister's involvement, according to a letter from
the Scott Inquiry secretary Christopher Muttukumaru to her private
secretary.
Mr Muttukumaru said the paper had ''drawn selectively'' on an extract
from the draft report.
The comments in the extract concerned were not sent to Lady Thatcher
because Sir Richard ''does not regard them as critical of her conduct'',
he added.
Sir Richard has been sending out extracts from the draft report to
Ministers and officials he has provisionally criticised in order to give
them an opportunity to respond.
The Independent story referred to a letter she sent in August 1989 in
reply to a query about Britain's policy on the sale of Hawk military
jets to Iraq.
In her letter, one of several similar letters sent out by Ministers at
the time, Lady Thatcher said Government policy on arms sales to Iraq had
not changed.
According to the paper, Sir Richard's draft report said that statement
was not accurate.
He added that she saw a Ministry of Defence briefing paper the
previous month which could have been said to have put her on notice that
a more liberal approach to the guidelines on such sales had been
adopted.
The Independent did not quote a subsequent sentence which said: ''But
the paper had been concentrating on Hawk and I do not think that Mrs
Thatcher can be blamed if, when signing the letter of 21 August 1989,
she did not recall the implications of the reference to the guidelines
in the MoD's Hawk paper.''
Mr Muttukumaru said: ''The judge is surprised that the Independent, if
it were going to quote from a 'leaked' draft of the report, did not
complete the quotation.''
His letter was released to the press by Lady Thatcher's office with
the authorisation of the inquiry.
Mr Muttukumaru said the comments quoted by the Independent were drawn
from the same draft extract of the report seen by the BBC which
criticised Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave for making misleading
statements to MPs.
Sir Richard's comments are likely to fuel the anger among Tory back
benchers furious over the original leak to the BBC.
They will also heighten concern among those Opposition MPs who suspect
a conspiracy by Government supporters to undermine and discredit the
inquiry's findings.
Sir Richard made clear his displeasure over the leak to the BBC and
this latest episode will strengthen his determination to complete his
long-delayed report as soon as possible.
With even more sensitive extracts yet to be sent to witnesses
concerning the use of Public Interest Immunity certificates -- so-called
''gagging orders'' -- signed by Ministers such as Kenneth Clarke,
Malcolm Rifkind and Peter Lilley, the Government will be concerned at
the possibility of further damaging leaks.

Wendy Jack hears how a designer caught between a rock and a hard place
is making a stylish recovery
JACQUI Burke epitomises true entrepreneurial style. As a fashion
designer who was achieving high-profile success dressing the rich and
famous -- from Cher to Gloria Estefan -- she was plunged overnight into
bankruptcy, following alleged theft by an employee of a large amount of
stock and money from the designer forum in London where her collection
was on show.
Yet she has emerged once more, albeit on income support and housing
benefit having had to sell the flat she and her husband bought as their
first home. Now she is determined to painfully reclimb the ladder.
Her determination extends to remaining in Scotland. Dunbar born and
bred, she says that is where she now wants to live and work -- at the
hub of the family who have stood staunchly by her and her husband, Steve
Robinson, throughout their troubles.
Robinson, who gave up a successful career of his own, in rock band
management -- with groups which included Status Quo, Meat Loaf and
Scorpions as well as Robert Palmer and Fish -- is now his wife's sales
and marketing manager, having turned down a plum job as tour manager for
Pavarotti.
It took three long years after graduating from the Scottish College of
Textiles at Galashiels in 1986, before Jacqui Burke managed to get
funding from The Prince's Scottish Youth Trust to set up in fashion
designing,
''You don't get any encouragement in Scotland. Maybe now it's starting
to come through because they want a Scottish fashion industry but it's a
long way down the line,'' she comments. ''When I eventually got funding
it certainly didn't come from the Government although later, I got #1000
as a third of the cost of machinery from the then SDA's craft section
because I was creating one-off couture.
It grew from there. I worked for individual customers from 1989 to
1991 when I did the debut collection for the London Designer Show in
1992.
''A young woman who'd read about me wrote recently asking for advice.
She was a year out of college and going through a similar struggle to
mine; she was disheartened. I could only advise her that starting your
own business is just so tough. When you've got no money, you think 'och,
I might take a wee job,' but then you realise you can't, because you
can't give the business your full attention. I'd never deviate from this
path.''
It has been from the west and not the east that Jacqui Burke's new
lifelines have been thrown. Glasgow Opportunities, she says, ''have been
much more encouraging. We really didn't know where to go after
everything had happned to us. Everybody says you have to move, so I
thought rather than move to London, I'll try Glasgow first. You don't
get any encouragement here in the east at all.
''We went to Glasgow, and they said 'you don't have to move, you can
get help through us'. We put one adertisement into Glasgow
Opportunities' LINK Magazine to see if we could get backing from a
business angel, and we got two or three responses.''
Now their London-based backer, who has a stake in the business and
eventually hopes to join them full-time, supplies the money for the
company's financial needs. But while it is gradually growing, Burke and
Robinson get nothing other than their business expenses. Instead of
employing their own labour, apart from one machinist, all their work now
goes out to CMT (cut, make, trim) factories in Glasgow, radically
reducing their costs.
In January this year, the couple went on a British trade mission to
Japan to show the Jacqui Burke spring/summer collection. During the
first show in Tokyo news of the earthquake in Osaka came through. Later,
they learned that five floors of the Hilton where the show was to be
held the next day, had collapsed. With heavy hearts they returned home.
But in spring, their Japanese contacts were invited to London Fashion
Week: ''They came and placed their orders,'' smiled Burke. ''We also
have interest from America, which includes a huge department-store
chain,'' she added.
In dealing with Japanese clients, ''you have to be very tenacious,
they are hard work and expect you to chase them to prove yourself,''
explains Robinson. His wife adds: ''Everything has to be adapted for
that market, we have to design specifically for their measurements,
they're 12cms shorter in height. The shoulders have to be reduced and
the necks widened. They're between our sizes -- seven, nine and eleven
but it's good fun and I enjoy the challenge.''
The couple always consult each other on all business matters, although
each has specific areas of responsibility, explains Steve Robinson.
''When we first got together, we were both very trusting people --
that was the big mistake we made. We took someone on face value, and
that's something people in business should never do. Now we put our
cards on the table at the start, and make sure the contract is signed,
because it's going to protect all of us and we want to remain friends.
It's always got to be that way, and you must constantly check up on
people and let them know you are doing so.''
''My family says 'is it worth it'?'' Jacqui Burke says with a rueful
smile. ''I turned down a job at #50,000 as a designer in Paris after the
bankruptcy. I believe you must be totally focused, I wouldn't go off the
track. I'd get used to that income and would feel I was prostituting
myself. For all the struggle I've gone through there must be light at
the end of the tunnel.''
One sad point to ponder in the uphill battle back has been the
attitudeof many Scots towards those who develop business problems, often
through little or no fault of their own. Jacqui Burke is well aware of
this unpleasant cultural trait: the negativity towards those who
succeed, and the near-pleasure of some when that success turns sour.
Jealousy? Lingering mists of the dependency culture? Basic economic
ignorance? Whatever, it may well be a powerful inhibiting factor for the
entrepreneurs we need so desperately to have a go. Alongside their
skills, courage, and determination, they clearly need strong stomachs
and thick skins.
Together though, Jacqui Burke and Steve Robinson aim to prove to the
world that they have what it takes.

PROFESSOR George Fleming of Strathclyde University has devoted his
whole working life to trailblazing research. But theoretical
abstractions are not his province; nor the ivory tower his domain.
His over-riding interest, indeed his special mission, has always been
to gear his engineering research and teaching interests towards
practical applications in the construction industry in general: and in
terms of hydrology, water and soil resources engineering, towards where
they relate to environmental management in particular.
And the culmination of his hugely diverse as well as academically
rigorous career was his appointment two years ago as the first managing
director of The Centre for Environmental Studies Limited (CEMS) at
Strathclyde.
In recent years growing awareness of the importance of environmental
issues and the interaction between natural resources, their exploitation
and technology has meant that the evaluation and solution of
environmental problems has become even more complex. In almost every
case there can be a number of options, each with different technical,
environmental, and financial implications.
The Centre for Environmental Management studies, an independent
company attached to Strathclyde University, was founded in order to
provide research, consultancy and technical services which would offer
expert solutions to a wide range of these environmental issues. And the
driving force behind its establishment was Professor Fleming: as head of
the water engineering and environmental management research unit at
Strathclyde University, he realised that there was at the university
both the staff and the reputation to convert research ideas into
commercial practice.
The unit has been very successful in producing first-class fertile
topsoil --it was used on the Garden Festival site -- from dredgings from
the River Clyde. This ''Clydesoil'' Project won a Better Environment
Award for Industry and was the catalyst for the foundation of The Centre
for Environmental Management Studies in 1993, the only self-financing,
university-owned company of its kind in Scotland.
Under Professor Fleming's guidance it has pioneered a number of
environmental approaches and become a world-recognised force in
environmental technology and management, receiving international acclaim
for its extensive industrial and commercial research.
The projects which the centre has tackled have covered a wide
spectrum. It has extensive experience in water-quality assessment, its
expertise covering surface and ground waters, industrial and domestic
effluents and inorganic and organic chemical and micro-biological
analyses; it has carried out many detailed air-quality studies,
monitoring industrial processes for compliance with emissions standards
and evaluating chemical and dust hazards; it has the capacity to provide
integrated environmental assessment, drawing on a wide range of
disciplines -- geology, planning, hydrology, chemistry, economics,
ecology; it can provide expertise in metal analysis, permeability
testing and gas analysis; it can provide software (which has been
developed from pioneering work in computer-aided design and simulation
techniques) for environmental monitoring packages; and it can provide
advisory services to industry.
But what most excites Professor Fleming is the centre's specialised
expertise in the conversion of contaminated soil into fertile land. It
has built on its original ''Clydesoil'' project to become a leading
player internationally, as well as in Scotland, in this field.
CEMS fought off world-wide competition to win the contract to carry
out a detailed study of the quality and quantity of the sedimentary
deposits in Hong Kong Harbour, and to evaluate the most environmentally
beneficial and technically-suitable solution to its dredging and the
subsequent utilisation of the dredged material.
The centre is also closely linked with Boston University in
Massachusetts and the two organisations are undertaking joint research
work into the sludge deposits in Boston Harbour and their eventual
bio-remediation.
The CEMS has been recognised by the European Environment Agency as a
centre of excellence in environmental technology and management; its
nomination as Scottish Topic Centre on Environmental Management and
Waste Management means that it is a vital part of the European drive to
acquire more information on these issues so that environmental policies
can be effectively evaluated.
As you might expect, the growth of the company has been rapid. The
projected turnover of the first year was a substantial underestimate: in
the event it was over #300,000. And this year the actual turnover figure
has risen to around half-a-million pounds.
CEMS has a permanent staff of 16 and, in addition to the frequent
secondments from other university departments, it also, through
Professor Fleming's world-wide contacts, employs experts of
international calibre for particular research work.
Current projects, to name but a few, and apart from numberous Scottish
contracts, include work in Pakistan, India, several Eastern European
countries, Russia and California. For Professor Fleming, the ivory tower
looks like remaining locked forever.

Ewan Easton, a lawyer with Maclay Murray &amp; Spens, describes the legal
recourse available to landlords in dispute over leases
LAST week the new Commercial Court in Edinburgh again displayed its
determination to give fast and effective solutions in commercial
disputes. The Argyll Stores Group, operators of the Safeway and Presto
supermarket chains, were required to keep open one of the stores
affected by closure plans. This is the latest in a series of decisions
which may have major implications for retailers and for institutional
landlords.
The court tackled the problem of commercial tenants who vacate their
trading premises in defiance of their landlords. Most good commercial
leases have a restriction on this. A claim for damages has always been
possible but, even when the trading in a major shopping centre is badly
damaged, it has been very difficult to assess the loss in money terms.
Traders have often escaped any sanction.
The first signs of change came in a case involving the Nationwide
Building Society. Abbey National were next to find themselves forced to
admit that they had been defying provisions in their lease in a case
that went to the Inner House of the Court of Session -- Scotland's
senior civil court.
A series of cases has followed. Our Price, the W H Smith record store,
Pullars, one of Scotland's biggest dry-cleaning companies, and even the
Royal Bank of Scotland have all been required to think again about plans
to close premises by landlords keen to preserve the vitality of their
shopping centres and keep trade flowing to neighbouring tenants.
It is clear that judges in Scotland are anxious not to allow tenants
to ignore important obligations to stay open. With this strong line, the
Scottish courts appear once more to be taking the lead in an area where
both Scottish and Engish judges have long recognised the problem.
Damages have never been an adequate remedy for the beleaguered
landlord of a shopping centre. The implications of ''dead'' frontage for
rental yields, insurance arrangements and future rent reviews have
always been clear for everyone to see but they are often almost
impossible to quantify. Tenants were often able to escape liability for
what were sometimes flagrant breaches of their contracts.
The Scottish courts have pointed to a new remedy. What was needed,
they said, was a positive order to trade. And that order had to be
available fast for, until now at least, a favourite game for departing
tenants has been to give little or no notice of their plans and to stage
a latter-day version of the traditional moonlight flit.
Until the recent cases, the problem has been a reluctance by the
courts to police enforced commercial activity. As recently as 1992
reluctance was still apparent -- even in Scotland. A Judgment by Lord
Sutherland made clear that ''the obligation to occupy and use premises
and carry on business involves continuous acts of management in which
multifarious actions are required.'' How could a court know what was
commonly sold in the supermarket.
Courts have in the past instructed that a wall be constructed, even
that a house be built, but until last year there seemed to be no hope --
north or south of the border -- of obtaining an order requiring the shop
to continue to trade.
The Judgment of Lord President Hope in the Abbey National case and,
more recently, the interim orders granted by Lord Penrose in the new
Commercial Court came as fountains in a desert of rather negative case
law but, as every shopping centre afficionado knows, not every fountain
is quite what it seems. The interesting question is how far will the law
develop?
In the Argyll case, we have an example of a court intervening in one
of these increasingly common dramatic nationwide store closure
announcements. What are the lessons for store operators? It seems that
the failure to consult those affected by the plan was an important
factor.
The implications are not limited to shops. Banks and building
societies have also been brought before the court and required to keep
premises open.
In the case of the Glasgow city centre branch of the Royal Bank of
Scotland, the order requires that the bank must use and occupy the
premises as bank offices and keep the premises open for business during
normal business hours until further order of the court.
The Commercial Court has been designed to deal rapidly with disputes
between businesses. It is equipped to cut down the time cases will take.
It seems increasingly clear that its style of operation will be
interventionist.
Perhaps the most intriguing question of all still lies ahead. Do we
have in this area of the law yet another example where the English
courts will eventually follow an adventurous line first developed here
in Scotland?

IF Sheila Robson's dreams come true, fast food chain McDonald's could
soon be serving up hamburgers splashed with her red pepper dressing.
The encounter between Robson, owner of Marmion's Brasserie in Melrose,
and the man from McDonald's, took place at the International Food
Exhibition recently. ''He seemed very interested,'' she says.
The Earls Court exhibition provided Robson's first opportunity to test
public reaction to her red pepper recipe; two years ago, her first
venture into the salad dressing business -- Marmion's traditional French
vinaigrette -- was launched at the Royal Highland Show, Ingliston, where
she was sponsored by Scottish Borders Enterprise.
She was overwhelmed with orders and forged some useful contacts,
including David Lloyd, Jenner's food and wine buyer. Thanks to his
advice, Robson's original product -- which she describes as having ''a
smooth texture, quite subtle, and not overwhelmed with garlic or
vinegar'' -- is found in a number of upmarket outlets from Loch Fyne to
Bridge of Allan.
It is 17 years since Robson began experimenting seriously with
vinaigrette. Prior to buying Marmion's in Melrose, she and her husband
Ian ran The Red Gauntlet in Galashiels -- scene of early forays into
culinary dressings.
''It escalated from there -- everyone seemed mad about it,'' says
Robson, of the cloudy beige liquid which evidently sets Borders' taste
buds tingling.
A large house, three children and a restaurant might be considered
enough to keep Robson busy, but she spends several days a week making
dressings in the restaurant -- ''but if a small unit comes up, I'll
think about it''.
. Increased orders (anything from 26 dozen to 48 dozen a time) have
prompted Mrs Robson's accountants, Hogg and Thorburn of Galashiels, to
supply her with a marketing executive.
''A broker has been selling for me, but now I'm going to go it alone.
Things have got too big, so I'm glad of the assistance,'' says Robson.
In addition to marketing her latest red pepper dressing, Robson is
experimenting with an onion, lime and coriander salsa. And with the help
of Elgin distillers Gordon McPhail, she is discussing the possibility of
a whisky vinaigrette with a top Paris store.

Hugh Dougherty finds a firm which likes to keep an eye on the press
SEVEN years ago, an English and history teacher became a monitor.Frank
McCallum shook the last of the chalkdust from his shoes and, as founder
and owner of McCallum Media Monitor, now devotes all his energies to
running a clip joint. He and his staff scan, cut, and paste the daily
and weekly papers to provide a press cuttings service for a range of
customers in both the public and private sectors.
''I started the business part-time while I was still teaching,'' said
Frank. ''But, with 4am starts and the obvious potential for growth in
the service I provide, I had to choose between teaching and being a
media monitor. I made the choice, and I haven't looked back.''
At 4am, the company's office in St Vincent Crescent is a hive of
activity.
The pressure is on Frank and his team of four to get the papers
scanned and cut, to ensure early delivery to customers as diverse as
ScotRail, Greater Glasgow Tourist Board, and a host of private public
relations firms.
''It is hectic,'' admitted Frank. ''We've seen work grow as
reorganisation has taken place within the public sector. We just used to
do cuttings for ScotRail, for example. But now we also work for
Railtrack, so privatisation has been to our advantage.''
But a nightmare lurks at the back of Frank's mind. ''We dread a
situation where multiple disasters hit several of our clients at the one
time. Of course, the profit is in large customers who make the
headlines, but a situation such as the floods in Strathclyde region, one
of our customers, which took place before Christmas, had us working
flat-out as the disaster affected many more organisations than just the
council.''
McCallum Media Monitor, whose logo incorporates a Sherlock Holmes hat
and a large magnifying glass -- a tool much beloved of Frank -- rejoices
in the recent proliferation of Scottish daily editions.
''It means that we can access the papers very quickly,'' explained
Frank. ''And we're now picking up customers abroad who want to know
about Scotland, so getting the cuttings done without delay, and putting
them on the fax, is what it's all about. We couldn't get by without our
fax in this business, where speed of delivery is of the utmost.''
The company now provides an evening and weekly paper service, and
there are the specialist searches for public relations consultants to
deal with as well.
''A public relations consultancy will often phone us up to look for
sponsorship advertising appearing,'' said Frank's number two, Michelle
Curran.
''That's why we have to look out for photographs of football matches
where certain brands appear on team strips. There might also be a brand
advert at the pitch side. Agencies want these pictures to show their
clients that newspaper readers are being exposed to their products.''
The atmosphere at McCallum Media Monitor is one of ordered but frantic
business, as expert eyes are cast over the incredible amount of
newsprint that is turned out by the Scottish media industry on any one
day.
It's a side of the business that most journalists, the primary
producers of Frank's work, never see. But Frank says many would be
flattered to learn the importance accorded to the written word and the
press photograph by organisations, large and small.
In business terms, McCallum Media Monitor is expanding happily, as
more new clients see the benefits of buying in a press cuttings service.
But office space is at a premium, with every nook and cranny crammed
with files, papers and cuttings.
''If you worked out the amount earned by each square foot, you would
be staggered,'' smiled Frank. ''This must be the most cost-effective
clip joint in the business!''
And the future? ''We're monitoring the situation,'' said Frank. Just
what you would expect from a teacher turned monitor.

THE MAN who founded a computer consultancy later sold it, bought it
back again, and then sold it again. Yet during all this he never left
the company.
Kingston-SCL was formed 30 years ago by Jim McCready and two other
former IBM employees. Two of their first contracts included advice to
Edinburgh Corporation and Glasgow Corporation on the installation of
their first computer systems.
During the Seventies, Jim agreed to sell the company to the Lloyds and
Scottish Group in the hope that they would be able to develop it faster.
The expansion plans did not work out, and in 1980 Jim bought back the
company and 18 employees. ''After I bought the company back we started
to specialise by operating in niche markets,'' he says.
The privatisation of BT and the emergence of mobile phones gave the
company an opportunity which it grabbed with both hands.
''We supplied companies with systems to handle their billing process
and manage their customer bases,'' explains Jim.
SCL's early involvement in the emerging international mobile phone
market meant that their expertise was much sought-after.
However this rapidly expanding market meant that once again SCL had to
consider its future.
''We were starting to go for contracts which were worth more than the
entire company,'' explains Jim.
The result was that in 1992, SCL became part of Kingston
Communications, the public telecommunications group in Hull, and renamed
Kingston-SCL.
Jim stayed on as chairman and the company began to expand from its
base in Edinburgh, opening offices in Paris, Munich, and Hong Kong. It
now has contracts with network operators in 19 countries.
During the last 18 months the number of staff has grown from 80 to
200, and Jim believes this growth will continue.
This rapid growth in employment is mirrored by a leap in turnover from
#7.6m in 1994 to #11.8m this year, which generated #1.59m pre-tax
profits.
When he is not busy on Kingston-SCL business, Jim admits to being a
business angel, and has invested in a number of computer technology
companies some of which, he says, are about to bear fruit.

HAVING just returned from the African rainforest, and being a regular
visitor to the Amazonian and Brazilian rainforests, I want to clear up
some public misconceptions about rainforests and the use of hardwood
products.
The general perception, as portrayed by the media, is that Amazonia
has been all but razed to the ground by cattle barons, mining companies
and loggers. But the facts tell a different story.
The latest satellite surveillance shows that at least 90% of the
Amazon rainforest is intact. Most of the 10% that has been cleared is
under some form of cultivation, either grass for cattle rearing or cash
crops such as cocoa.
Remarkably, Brazil supplies less than 3% of the hardwoods imported by
consumer nations. Which country would you say is the world's largest
producer of hardwood? The US? Malaysia? Maybe Indonesia? All wrong.
India is the largest producer of hardwoods, but it uses over 90% of it
for cooking and heating.
The latest figures issued by the Food and Agricultural Organisation of
the United Nations show that only 6% of all tropical hardwood production
enters the international marketplace with Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan
being the main consumers.
Scotland has only 1% of its original forest cover left. Most of the
stands of conifers around the country are non-indigenous species such as
sitka spruce -- hence the strong movement to preserve what is left of
the original Caledonian pine forests and to start replacing what has
disappeared.
The Scottish Hardwood Charter, a registered charity with over 500
members, is an inspired and imaginative initiative between commerce and
the environment. Its central aim is that all members use only hardwood
from well-managed forests.
David Bellamy, co-founder of the Charter, believes that industry is
the key to healthier forests. By insisting that timber comes only from
well-managed forests, the incentive for good management is passed on to
producers.
But there is no point in pretending that all is well in the world's
forests. Certain areas are being logged practically night and day, with
logs shipped to Japan and other Pacific Rim countries to be turned into
plywood. The countries who practise this needless destruction should be
ashamed of themselves, for they are wealthy nations. Other countries
like Papua New Guinea and The Solomon Islands, for example, desperately
need the income to stave off poverty.
This is a human problem.
But none of these logs enters the UK trade. In fact, the UK trade and
most of our European counterparts are becoming highly responsible
through initiatives such as our Scottish Charter and the World Wide Fund
for Nature's 95 group of companies, which includes all the DIY giants
such as B&amp;Q and Texas.
By supporting these initiatives and by buying even more hardwood
products from companies involved in the projects, we can ensure that
even more pressure is passed down the supply chain, encouraging
producers to manage their forests properly.
A major way forward will be through the development of plantations in
areas that have already suffered deforestation. Yield from plantations
cropped on a sustainable basis can be a hundred times greater than from
the natural forest. A commercially viable crop from hardwood
plantations, such as mahogany, is achievable within 40 years.
Only in exceptional cases do bans and boycotts succeed. A ban on the
use of tropical hardwood would reduce the economic value of forests and
increase the likelihood of their being cleared for cash crops such as
cocoa or palm oil.
Ultimately, governments have the power to legislate for a better
future but forests require plans of around 40 years or more to ensure
their survival. With the average term of government being four years,
forestry is well down politicians' priority lists.
If proper management of the world's forests does not prevail, it will
be left to future generations to try to put right the damage caused to
our planet.
* J David Norman, co-founder of The Scottish Hardwood Charter and
chairman of M&amp;N Norman (Timber) Ltd, was talking to Yvonne Wightman.

FRED Goodwin, the newly appointed deputy chief executive of the
Clydesdale Bank, must have a quiet laugh when he hears people describing
accountancy as a boring profession.
During the past 15 years Fred, 36, an accountant, has become
accustomed to having the jobs he was working on hitting the headlines.
It all began in 1982 when he was the manager of the Touche Ross audit
team at the House of Fraser.
The store group at that time was in turmoil as Tiny Rowland, boss of
Lonrho, was engaged in a struggle to take over the company, and
extraordinary general meetings of shareholders filled the news columns
of this and other newspapers.
''It was very interesting,'' says Fred Goodwin, ''when the job you
were involved in was attracting so much attention. It was also hectic as
Lonrho would not hand in their proxy votes until 48 hours before the
meetings, and we had to check them all.''
Rosyth dockyard, which Fred was involved in, also refused to stay out
of the media.
''I led the team of accountants who had the job of preparing the yard
for privatisation. I enjoyed it, although there was a lot of hositility
at that time to the process, but the ideological motives involved were
not mine.''
He did not realise it at the time, but when, in 1987, he was part of
the Touche Ross team which carried out the due diligence work for the
National Australian Bank takeover of the Clydesdale, Fred was starting
down the path which was to change his career.
One of National Australia's team was Don Argus, who is now the boss of
the Australian bank.
But before he ended his accountancy career, Fred was involved in yet
another high-profile task when he was appointed chief operations officer
of the BCCI bank following its collapse.
Fred was headhunted for the deputy chief executive position and moved
into the Clydesdale Bank's Glasgow headquarters six weeks ago.
He is looking forward to the challenge of handling the changes which
are taking place in banking, but no-one could blame him if he hopes that
his new position will create fewer headlines than he has become
accustomed to.
Meanwhile Fred is not only enjoying his new job but also the 1972
Triumph Stag which he restored over three years.
''I began restoring old cars when I was at university,'' says Fred,
''in those days it was not so much a hobby as a necessity. My first car
was a Singer Chamois which I bought for #40.''
Fred eventually sold his Singer for #100. ''It was the only car I have
ever made money on,'' he says.

Harry Conroy reports on a Scottish video production company, led by
David McWhinnie (left), having a tilt at the big screen.
MENTION a war, battle or a major event which has taken place this
century and there is a good chance that David McWhinnie's Lamancha
Productions have made a video of it.
For the past 10 years Edinburgh-based Lamancha has been producing
20th-century history from archive material which it buys from throughout
the world.
Modern history videos may not have mass-market appeal, but the demand
is proven by the fact that since 1985 Lamancha has sold more than one
million videos worldwide.
''If a book on a particular subject sells well, then there is a good
chance that there is a reasonable market for a video on the same
subject,'' says David.
There is also, says David, who founded Lamancha in 1985, an interest
in commanders, generals, and spitfires.
''It is amazing,'' he says, ''mention spitfires, and you have an
immediate audience''.
The company's first video series was Decades, which covered the
Twenties through to the Fifties.
Since then there have been videos on every conflict from the Boer War
to Korea. The only modern carnage not covered is Vietnam.
Lamancha's latest video series is 12 hours of programming on six
battles including the Battle of Britain, Stalingrad, and Berlin.
It clinched $1million of television sales at Cannes recently and
record video sales are expected to follow.
''The series is going to be shown on prime-time television across the
US, and the company we have sold the rights to across the Atlantic have
a database of three million people who are interested in this type of
material,'' enthuses David.
''This company sold one million cassettes of the World at War series,
and although we don't expect to sell this amount, it will do very
well.''
But Lamancha does not merely produce war documentaries. Past
productions include yachting and sailing as well as the history of
aircraft.
The Edinburgh video company have sold their material in 20 countries
and their soundtracks have been translated into French, Spanish,
Italian, German, Finnish, and Portuguese.
''It is very simple,'' explains David. ''They simply strip out the
English track and replace it with one in their own language, making sure
that it is synchronised with the film.''
Lamancha documentaries have appeared on terrestial and satellite
television around the world but, to date, have found little favour with
British television companies.
''Our productions go into a great deal of detail which does not seem
to suit British television, although it goes down well in other
countries,'' says David.
Lamancha employs 12 people at their production facilities in
Edinburgh's Newington Road, including three researchers, but they also
engage freelance composers to write the background music and top
narrators such as Patrick Allen and Tim Piggot Smith.
David is now looking at the possibility of producing a series on the
history of the British Empire.
''It will be 12 hours of programming including film footage,
paintings, stills and graphics,'' he says. ''It will hopefully put the
British Empire into its proper historical context in that it was not all
good, but it was not all bad either.''
Lamancha work with Edinburgh University on many of their projects, and
once the research has been carried out the script is written, Next comes
the problem of tracing film to illustrate the story.
''You might, for example, find it impossible to get a clip showing a
certain machine,'' explains David. ''Then we have to look for stills or
to do a graphic.''
Recently the company has diversified into feature films and were
associate producers of Chasing the Deer. In addition, Lamancha is at
present involved in filming The Bruce, produced in association with
Cromwell Films. David is one of the producers of the film, starring
Oliver Reed and Brian Blessed.
Indeed, when I arrived for the interview, David was examining leather
costumes for The Bruce, which looked rather ornate, but he explained
they would appear okay on screen.
The film is being shot in Peebles and David believes it will be a
success, but until it is all in the can he is not willing to make firm
predictions.
''We have a lot of contacts worldwide and there is a big demand for
action films of this type, and we have experience of selling into
America. But, for example, if we were to get bad weather this weekend
when we are shooting we could have a lot of problems,'' he says.
However, David believes that Scotland could have a prosperous future
in film production.
''In the past, Scottish films have not been too successful but recent
examples, such as Shallow Grave, have been commercial,'' he says.
He believes that Scotland has many assets which make it attractive to
the film industry such as the villains and heroes in our history,
castles, and landscape.
''What we need to do,'' David says, ''is to build an industry that
employs people in a consistent fashion. Fifty people are employed on the
set of The Bruce.''
He draws attention to the fact that when Scotland makes films which
sell in America the dollars come back to this country.
One reason he says, that Lamancha will be involved in more films in
future.

IT'S a sair fecht being piper-in-ordinary to Ms Roseanna Cunningham.
As yesterday's papers reported, the luckless man piped attendance on the
new MP when she turned up at Westminster. He went to gi'e them a blaw, a
blaw: but the serjeant-at-arms' men had a blow of their own to deliver.
First, they confiscated the pipes, calling them ''a dangerous
weapon''. Then they returned them, saying it would be OK so long as the
piper didn't play them.
In McSonachan's last night, Scottish hearts swelled with outrage. At
least, it beat directors' salaries as something to get black affronted
over. ''If we had our own parliament,'' spluttered The Braces, ''I'd bet
that The Illegal Confiscation of a Chap's Pipes (1995) Order would be
among its first measures.'' I puffed that there would have to be a
clause stating that when a chap was fully rigged and ready to go, bag
full of wind etc, it would be an offence to inhibit the passage of that
wind through drones, chanter etc. Or words to that effect.
Ms Angelica Banana Skyne, the High Whitecraigs polymath, had listened
to all this blethers with arched eyebrows. ''Rubbish,'' she said. ''The
serjeant-at-arms' men were quite right. They are obviously well-informed
-- better informed than you lot anyway.''
She told us that the Highlanders adopted the great war pipe in the
16th century. As a resonant martial instrument, it replaced the use of
the harp and of poets reciting the Brosnachadh, inciting the clans to
battle. Indeed, if Ms Roseanna Cunningham had gone to Westminster with a
harpist and a poet, the security men would be entitled to lock them up.
As for refusing to let the piper play in an enclosed space, the men
were obviously familiar with Travels in England and Scotland by B Faujas
St Fond (1741-1819), a French geologist. The writer had been taken to a
piping competition by none other than Adam Smith, the political
economist. St Fond described what he heard as an insupportable uproar,
discordant sounds which lacerate the ear, and was unable to admire any
of the pipers. ''I thought them all of equal proficiency: that is to
say, the one was as bad as the other.''
Then, too, they would have read Tobias Smollett (1721-71) who said the
Highland bagpipe ''sings in the nose with a most alarming twang, and,
indeed, is quite intolerable to ears of common sensibility when
aggravated by the echo of a vaulted hall''. And Smollett, she said, came
from Dunbartonshire.
Angelica's erudite diatribe was followed by a minute's silence. Then
The Braces said: ''This directors' pay business is really getting out of
hand.'' The rest of the evening went quite smoothly.
* THE latest prediction is that in 25 years, computers will be writing
their own software and will have taste, feeling and smell as acute as
human beings. Question: Do we really want this to happen?
In the year 2020, you settle yourself at your work-station and switch
on. ''Listen,'' says the computer, ''do you mind not using that
particular after-shave? It makes me feel queasy. The one you were using
yesterday was much nicer.''
So you tell the computer to mind its own business. ''Shan't,'' it
replies. Shall, you say. ''Shan't.'' Shall. And so on. Ten minutes into
the working day and you're having a row. You could have had one of those
at home.
Then the computer criticises your tie, the fact that you're always
wearing the same jacket, and that yesterday you came back from lunch
with a distinct smell of wine on your breath. ''Not only that,'' it
adds, ''but it was the '87 St Emilion. The '86 is much nicer and is
reaching its peak right now.''
So the morning passes in a blizzard of niggling disapproval. Thank
God, it's time for lunch. You phone your favourite restaurant. ''Sorry,
sir,'' says the padrone. ''The last table has just gone. Your computer
phoned in to book it a few seconds ago.'' Will computers be able to
laugh in 2020? That's the next serious question.

GLASGOW-based property group City Site Estates is looking somewhat
perkier these days thanks to the rising rent roll, which for the full
year, looks like increasing by 10% to about #11m.
The once sluggish London and the South-east of England markets are
showing decided growth particularly in the West End office sector which
may be sufficient to put a bit of fire under the overall net asset value
when that is calculated at the end of September.
The current value in the wake of the Kwik Save deal for the discount
supermarket company Shoprite substantially improved the value of the
properties let by City Site is probably about 70p compared with 55p last
September although managing director Louis Goodman was playing his cards
very close to his chest yesterday on what may emerge.
There have been upward variations with Land Securities being ahead of
estimates in its year to March thanks to the superb underlying quality
of its portfolio and among the smaller fry Raglan which has a similar
type of office, retail, and industrial spread to that of City Site.
The snag is that voids or empty property are costing about #1m a year
in lost rent and outgoings with the vast majority being secondary sites
which are is not in demand, particularly in English provincial towns --
Scotland is not a problem on this score.
In the first six months, rental income increased almost 9% to #5.27m.
However higher interest charges and a fall in property sale profits
reduced the pre-tax total from #312,000 to #232,000.
Last month, half the arrears on the Preference dividend was paid off
and the outstanding #1.67m will be cleared this autumn to allow the
payment of Ordinary share dividends in probably a year's time.
At 48p, the shares are standing at a perhaps 30% discount to net asset
value which is the highest in the sector.
Ever since the Parisbas-backed soundings of institutional shareholders
emerged last year, the speculative element has never left the company.
This should prove an interesting investment over the months to come.

HAVELOCK Europa, the Fife-based storefitters, said yesterday that
orders remained strong this year, but margins were being squeezed.
''There remains virtually no prospect of gaining meaningful price
increases from the retail sector,'' Havelock chairman Norman Lessels
told the company's annual general meeting in Dalgety Bay.
''In the retail banking sector additional volumes have been gained,
albeit at slightly lower margins,'' he added.
Mr Lessels said Havelock had maintained a healthy order book, with
additional work for Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer. In addition, electrical
retailer Dixon's had signed up as a new customer.
Mr Lessels said Havelock remained ''strongly cash positive,'' but he
warned that as in 1994, most turnover would go through the books in the
second half of the year when current projects are completed.
Havelock chief executive Hew Balfour said overseas sales were expected
to almost double this year, partly because a new partnership with the US
firm John Ryan was bringing in new European orders.
''This year overseas sales will likely exceed 10% of our business.
Last year it was 6.5%,'' he added.
Mr Balfour said the decline in margins in the banking sector was
mainly due to a shift in business to project management, which was less
profitable than manufacturing.
Last year Havelock reported a 76% increase in pre-tax profit to #4m
and a 12% increase in turnover to #39.6m as it diversified into the
banking sector.
Edinburgh brokers Bell, Lawrie, White are forecasting that Havelock
will boost its pre-tax profit to about #5m in 1995, with the dividend
climbing to 3.6p from 3.0p.
Havelock shares rose 1p to 217p.

IT was all quiet on the Western front last night after the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the Bank of
England, Eddie George, met briefly before lunch to review the policy on
interest rates.
Before and after the meeting the Bank of England dealt in the money
markets at established rates, suggesting that there would be no hike in
rates this month.
Mr Clarke has the final say on rates, but the timing of any agreed
change is up to the Governor. The last two rate hikes have been
signalled to the markets immediately, and last month the Chancellor took
the unusual step of announcing that there was to be no change.
But a difference of opinion between the Chancellor and the Governor is
unlikely to remain below the surface for long. The two men are due to
speak at the Mansion House dinner in the City next Wednesday.
A month ago the Mr Clarke confounded financial markets by leaving
rates unchanged -- in conflict, it is widely assumed, with the advice he
received from Mr George. The minutes of that contentious meeting will be
published in a fortnight.
This time round the City backed Mr Clarke to fight off any pressure
from the Bank of England for a rise in rates to offest the fall in
sterling this year.
Evidence has been building up of stagnant trading in the High Streets
and house prices have gone into decline again. All of this has
strengthened the Chancellor's hand.
There was even speculation in the City that the Governor might not
bother to press the case for higher rates at yesterday's meeting, which
began at the unusually late hour of noon.
Spoof minutes, produced in advance of the meeting by NatWest Markets,
suggested that Mr George would not be pressing for a rate rise this
month since it was clear that the no-change case that the Chancellor
advanced last month was supported by recent events.
Money market futures now imply that UK rates will remain at current
levels until the end of September, at least. Such an outcome assumes
that the current signs of a slowdown in economic activity will not be
disturbed. Thereafter higher rates to offset tax cuts in the November
Budget are expected.
In its monetary report ahead of the meeting the Treasury said that
monthly economic indicators were giving mixed signals, but recent GDP
data confirmed that growth was slowing to a more sustainable but still
healthy rate.
The report noted that retail sales fell in April while manufacturing
output rose in March and CBI output expectations remained buoyant in
May. First quarter GDP was revised down to 0.7% from a provisional 0.8%
as investment rose strongly, net trade bounced back, and consumer
expenditure fell.
Earlier the Central Statistical Office revised the fall in the longer
leading indicator in April from 0.7% to 1.1%. This somewhat esoteric,
though highly respected, statistic has been falling steadily since last
June, indicating a possible turnround or slowdown in activity around the
middle of this year.
The absence of an interest move had little effect on the pound which
gained 0.24 cents to $1.5930 while losing 1.34 pfennigs to DM2.2404. The
trade weighted index edged down from 84.3 to 84.2.
Sterling hit an all-time low of DM2.1750 on the Tuesday after the May
5 monetary meeting, but has recovered since aided by the dollar.

THE former US head of textiles group Dawson International, whose
resignation was prompted by the poor performance of the group's American
businesses, is receiving a #1.36m payoff.
News of Philip Kemp's compensation for loss of office, which includes
pension contributions almost equivalent to the entire Dawson board's
annual emoluments, comes only weeks after more than 400 Scottish
employees heard they were losing their jobs.
While staff face up to redundancy, Mr Kemp's pension nest egg will be
boosted by payments from Dawson totalling #842,000 over seven years.
Last year, the entire board's salary and benefits amounted to #946,000.
The payments are being made because Mr Kemp, who worked almost
exclusively in the US, did not participate in the company pension
scheme.
Dawson's annual report, published yesterday, reveals that #2.17m is
being paid to former directors by way of compensation. This figure has
been charged in the Edinburgh-based group's accounts for the year to
April 1.
Dawson, whose flagship Pringle of Scotland brand is promoted by golfer
Nick Faldo, yesterday defended the payments, claiming it had acted
promptly, efficiently and in the best interests of shareholders.
Former chairman Sir Ronald Miller, who was ousted in a boardroom coup
at the end of March, will receive compensation of #378,000.
His payoff is equivalent to about two years' salary, as is that made
to former managing director Nick Kuenssberg. Mr Kuenssberg, also forced
out when non-executive director Derek Finlay became chairman, receives a
one-off payment of #308,000.
John Embrey, who was succeeded as finance director by George
Fairweather last August, has been awarded compensation of #117,000, in
the form of increased pension benefits.
He will continue to draw a basic salary until he formally retires on
July 14.
Justifying the #2.17m compensation bill, Mr Finlay said: ''By acting
quickly and avoiding lengthy and potentially expensive court proceedings
at the time of the senior management changes at the end of March, the
new board was able to concentrate on the fundamental, strategic issues
which required immediate attention within the company.''
Dawson claimed the payments made to Sir Ronald and Mr Kuenssberg were
less than their full contractual entitlements.
It added that the pension arrangements for Mr Kemp had been explained
in a rights issue document last May.
Although it had not studied the details of the Dawson case, the UK
Shareholders' Association, the private shareholders' pressure group,
said that, as a rule, it did not approve of any sort of compensation for
failure and saw no need for lengthy rolling contracts.
A spokesman for the Scottish branch of UKSA said: ''If a director
fails to deliver the goods for a company, he should be treated in
exactly the same way as any other employee who fails in his duty.
''These people are rewarded when they are in office. Why should they
be rewarded when they are out of office for failing?''
In the wake of March's management changes, Dawson's remuneration
committee has attempted to prevent such massive compensation payouts in
the future by ensuring directors or senior executives are no longer
given contracts lasting for as long as two years.
However, the annual report states that Mr Fairweather and new managing
director Peter Forrest, who were on the board prior to the coup, have
respective notice periods of two and three years.
Mr Finlay and the non-executive directors have no contracts of
service.
Mr Kemp, who formerly ran Dawson's US businesses as chief executive of
Dawson Consumer Products Inc, departed in April last year. The previous
month, Dawson had announced provisions of #50m relating to the closure
of loss-making American operations, principally fleece and jersey
businesses.
These closures also resulted in a #56.4m exceptional charge, related
to goodwill, in the 1993/94 accounts.
At the time, Sir Ronald said: ''The departure of Mr Kemp is clearly
connected to the problems in the US as the business there is no longer
nearly so big and thus not suitable for a separate chief executive.''
Referring to the problems the group encountered in the US, a Dawson
official said yesterday: ''That is clearly why Philip Kemp felt he had
to resign.''
Discretionary share options granted to Dawson directors normally lapse
when they leave the company.
The group, however, has granted Sir Ronald and Mr Kuenssberg the right
to exercise these until next March. However, the exercise prices range
between 140p and 235p so the pair would currently be better off buying
Dawson shares at the current market price of 122p.
It was institutional discontent over Dawson's share price dropping as
low as 90p which precipitated the boardroom coup.
In the annual report, Mr Finlay expresses great regret at having to
take over the reins ''at a time when shareholder value had reached an
unacceptable level, and in circumstances that demanded major change in
senior management, business structure and heavy job losses.''
In March, Dawson announced the closure of its contract knitwear plant
at Arbroath, Tayside, with 221 job losses, and of its carpet yarn plant
at Kilwinning, Ayrshire, which employed 138 people. Another 53 jobs were
expected to go at Hawick in the Borders.
Dawson made pre-tax profits before exceptionals of #24.1m in the year
to April 1, a rise of 54%. However, one-off charges swallowed #22.4m of
these and operating profits from continuing operations fell 18% to
#35.7m, hit by problems at Pringle and the unusually mild winter in the
northern hemisphere.
In the previous financial year, the #106.4m of charges relating to the
closure of the US businesses brought about a pre-tax loss of #98m.
Mr Finlay said the sudden downturn at Pringle in the second half of
last year had been of great concern to the directors. He added that his
new management team had quickly got to grips with problem areas which
had caused recent difficulties.
Meanwhile, Dawson has begun detailed negotiations relating to the
disposal of its six remaining fleece and jersey plants in the US.

TWO building giants yesterday told of continuing worries in the
housing market.
Tarmac urged Government action to kickstart sales while Amec warned
that consumer confidence was still fragile.
Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, said it expected to see
''continuing pressure on selling prices and margins in what remains a
disappointing market''.
Chairman Sir John Banham said at the annual meeting that Tarmac would
suffer ''unless the Government recognises the importance of taking
positive steps quickly to restore the confidence of the home owner and
prospective house purchaser.''
Tarmac's operating profits would be significantly lower in the first
half of this year due to fewer reservations. However, with a 20%
increase in sites and later reservations coming through, he said overall
house sales would be ahead of 1994.
''Notwithstanding the present uncertainties, we believe that there is
substantial pent-up demand for high quality new homes,'' he said.
Meanwhile its construction division continued ''to operate efficiently
in what remain testing conditions.
''We believe that this industry has passed through the trough of its
recession and although Government spending continues to decline, there
are now signs that private industrial and commercial demand is improving
and we have a larger and better balanced order book,'' he told the
gathering in Birmingham.
Meanwhile, construction group Amec said its overall order book is up
15% compared with a year ago.
Its shareholder meeting was told this reflected a better balance
between home and overseas business and a stronger focus on large high
value projects in the UK.
''However, there will be no prospect of sustained recovery in the
private housing market while consumer confidence remains fragile,'' said
chairman Sir Alan Cockshaw.
* THE insurance industry hit back yesterday at ''misleading and
misplaced'' criticism of private mortgage-protection policies, which,
lenders allege, provide an insufficient safety net for homeowners.
From October, the Government plans to cut back on State help for
homeowners made redundant or too ill to work, and is encouraging them to
take out private insurance instead.
But lenders have said many policies will be ''worthless'' because they
have exclusion clauses and are difficult to claim against.
They have also argued that many people will not be eligible for cover
and warned that arrears and repossessions could increase.
But Tony Baker, deputy director general of the Association of British
Insurers, dismissed the criticisms and emphasised that an expanding
private mortgage insurance market would benefit homeowners.

ONE of Glasgow's most prominent buildings is being brought to the
market this week. Royal Mail's George Square head post office offers the
city's property professionals a 200,000 sq ft development opportunity on
the south-eastern side of George Square.
The building's future has been under discussion for some time and,
although detailed consent has not yet been gained, it seems likely that
the planners will want to see a redevelopment behind the retained
facade. Possible uses include redevelopment as offices.
The building could provide around 180,000 sq ft of office space with
floorplates of around 30,000 sq ft. Other possible uses are as a hotel
or art gallery (The National Gallery for Scotland has been mooted as a
possible user).
Marketing agents J Trevor &amp; Webster point to the advantages of its
large island block as an office scheme.
Royal Mail is moving out as part of a reorganisation of its
operations. The building is being sold on the open market.
Sluggish capital growth bites into rentals
CAPITAL and rental growth slowed down in all of Scotland's commercial
property sectors during May, according to the Richard Ellis Scottish
Monthly Index, which is prepared exclusively for The Herald.
The office, retail, and industrial sectors demonstrated growth rates
of -- 0.2%, 0.0% and 0.0% respectively. Industrials showed some signs of
stability with the annual rental growth rate remaining at 0.8% this
month. In contrast, the office year-on-year rental growth slowed from
-1.0% to -1.7% while retail slowed from 2.3% to 1.3%.
Capital growth rates displayed a similar pattern. The office, retail,
and industrial yearly figures now stand at 6.7%, 5.3%, and 3.9%
respectively -- down by between 1% and 3% on the previous months'
figures.
The office month-on-month figure has remained stable at -0.1%. The
retail monthly figure slowed from 1.5% to 0.0% for May, while industrial
slowed from 0.5% to -0.2%.
As a result of the slowing capital growth, the rates of total return
have fallen. The office, retail, and industrial sectors recorded rates
of 14.8%, 11.6% and 13.6% respectively while all property demonstrated
13.0% total return down from 15.2% in April.

Kay Aschaber reports on planned transport strategies to cope
with Scotland's burgeoning city-centre congestion and pollution
VISIONS of the future could resemble a blast from the past as
Strathclyde Regional Council proposes the comeback of the tram and the
reincarnation of the city cyclist in its transportation stragegy for the
millennium.
Where the tram lines and cables were disposed of 40 years ago to make
way for modern private transport, SRC's Millennium Plan for the year
2000 proposes the return of the tram -- albeit a more limited service
than that of years gone by -- taking up to 250 passengers between
Maryhill and Easterhouse.
In March this year, 80,000 questionnaires were issued for comments on
the Millennium Plan but the jury's still out on the 4000 returned and
will remain so until June 15, when the regional council meets to discuss
the findings.
But just one tram line and a system of improved traffic flow in the
city centre seems to be a drop in the ocean in comparison with many
European cities battling against ecologically-troubled tide for over a
decade already.
Strathclyde Regional Council produced a consultation document in 1992,
the results of which have instigated the production of this 1995 plan.
But exactly where does consultation come to a conclusion and action take
its place?
For anyone saddled with the burdens of asthma and hayfever, a hot,
humid summer's day, snarled up in a jam in the city centre, is a
powerful reminder of the amount of pollution we live and breath every
day.
Lothian Regional Council is now seven months into its transportation
strategy which, although suggesting and implementing various projects to
help traffic flow in Edinburgh and Lothian, has been designed to make
the public more aware of the environment they are creating for
themselves. Dr George Hazel, chief executive of the transportation
department of Lothian Regional Council and former professor of
transportation at Napier College, is horrified by the escalating growth
trends in car use throughout the country, and warned: ''Look at Los
Angeles -- that's where we're going.
''We have to be pretty radical. Lothian's Transport Awareness Campaign
has been launched to show people that we can't go on living like this.
We can't go on running our city based on a system totally dominated by
one mode of transport which is very inefficient.''
But in many respects, Glasgow has transportation advantages which many
towns and cities throughout the country would kill for. It has a quick,
clean and efficient underground system; the best suburban rail network
outside of London and excellent pedestrian shopping centres contained in
a very compact locality. However, the fact remains that Hope Street is
still the most polluted city-centre thoroughfare in the UK, if not
further afield.
The region can boast that 68% of those coming into Glasgow city centre
do use public, rather than private, transport.
Admirable steps are being proposed in SRC's Millennium Plan and the
120-page Public Realm document, to develop attractive streetscapes, ease
the flow of transport on the city's existing roads and generally ensure
that the environmental balance is right between people and traffic in
the city centre. But it is achieving that balance which will require
skillful and -- painful though it may be -- radical action.
One way of curtailing the pollution of the city would be to have all
buses converted to gas or electricity. Although the initial conversion
or replacement of buses can be expensive, the filling time and costs
average the same as for diesel or petrol. In Vienna today, the city's
bus network runs entirely on gas.
The reaction to such a dramatic step is cautiously noncommittal in
Strathclyde however. Diminished control after deregulation leaves the
council powerless on such issues as how many buses take to the streets
of Glasgow, and the standard of service which they provide.
Bill Niche, Chairman of the Glasgow City Centre Association,
representing the tranche of businesses within the city, supports the
Millennium Plan wholeheartedly and is enthusiastic about the measures
which should be taken to encourage people on to public transport.
He said: ''I think Glasgow is a big enough city to say, 'Why don't we
pass local by-laws to force improvement of public transport, and if we
need some special powers from Parliament to pass them, then let's do
it'. ''
The tram would be a welcome addition to Glasgow's public transport
network, but it still awaits approval through Parliament in 1997, and at
a cost of around #200m still remains a begging bowl project yet to be
funded.
Strathclyde Regional Council has a budget of #25m to spend before the
year 2000 and, although many projects are underway such as the
streetscape at Candleriggs and the plans for pedestrianisation of Royal
Exchange Square, seems to be only nibbling around the edges of a problem
which affects every member of the population.
Examination of other European cities which have been working to these
ends for many years tends to imply that Scotland is seriously lagging
behind, and perhaps less superficial and more dramatic measures to
improve the traffic problems are needed.
However, Bill Niche is concerned that drastic measures are instigated
prematurely. ''We must be careful not to kill the goose which has laid
the golden egg for Glasgow,'' he said. The ''golden egg'' which Niche is
referring to is the easy access to the city centre which is the secret
of Glasgow's retail success. He believes that changes to the system have
to be fine-tuned to ensure that Glasgow does not become a no-go city
overnight.
One city which is experimenting with the ''road to somewhere'' is
Bremen in Germany, where Michael Glotz-Richter, a German
Planner/Engineer had a seemingly ''mad'' notion to develop a truly
car-free area.
His idea was to build a development which offered houses with no
roads. The owners of the houses would receive a free public transport
ticket and would have the use of shared cars for any lengthy journeys
out of the area but would generally survive in a car-free environment.
This ''mad'' idea is now a reality having attracted around 200
applicants, and a waiting list for future developments.
Encouraging cyclists is yet another consideration in the Millennium
Plan but to do so, safe routes must be constructed to ensure that
cyclists are not exposed to the dangers of heavy traffic or the
isolation of quiet and overgrown routes such as the existing cycle path
to Loch Lomond from the West End.
The Millennium Plan is an important step for Strathclyde, and the
sooner it is put into operation the better. However, as the City of
Architecture for 1999, the award and festival should not isolate the
great structural accolades of Glasgow but should show the ingenuity and
determination to design a transportation system which addresses
simultaneously the needs and well being of the city's businesses and
population for future generations, rather than simply firefighting with
measures which will have a diminishing effect in years to come.

MOST complainants to Richard Youard, the Investment Ombudsman, who
covers investment managers such as unit trust and PEP companies, must
feel that he has sold out to the industry he is supposed to protect them
from, given that over the past year he rejected 70% of the complaints
made to him.
In fact, his latest annual report just goes to show the woeful
ignorance that still exists when it comes to investment in equities. Not
that this is all one-sided. Incredibly in one case it became clear that
the investment adviser did not realise that shares can go down as well
as up, the one fundamental message that everyone really should know by
now.
In another, a professional investor's instructions to his investment
manager stated that although capital growth was wanted, preservation of
capital was essential. He thought it was reasonable to expect that not
only the starting capital be safeguarded but that gains should be
similarly protected. In other words, no losses could be tolerated, which
is impossible.
The idea of risk and reward and that investment is as much an art as a
science do seem difficult concepts for inexperienced investors to grasp.
They inevitably compare their fund with the top performers and complain
when they do less well, not realising that this year's best performer is
invariably not next year's and that what they should be comparing with
is the average for the fund's sector and how it compares with the
indices for the market or sector involved.
However, investment managers can still do much to improve their ''best
advice'' and most of the complaints to the Ombudsman come under this
category.
Other cases have turned on breach of contract (the company didn't do
what it agreed to do), misrepresentation (the company made statements in
interviews or documentation which misled the investor about what was
really on offer), and performance (the investment didn't do as well as
expected).
Mr Youard has seen improvement in documentation in the six years he
has been Ombudsman but believes it could be made clearer, particularly
over the vexed question of charges. While the amount of charges now has
to be disclosed their effect on the investment can bemuse investors even
if they accept that the investment manager has to be compensated.
So they are aggrieved when after a year their investment has lagged
markedly behind the stock market, not realising that the charges have
been taken at the outset.
On the subject of charges Mr Youard is angry by the way companies fob
off justified complaints by waiving or refunding charges. He points out
that this amounts to small punishment for the company and small benefit
to the customer. The message is clear -- if the investor is in doubt
over the compensation offered he should appeal to the Ombudsman.
The Ombudsman receives many complaints about investment performance,
but rarely upholds them as they invariably reflect poor understanding of
how the market works. He points out correctly that an investment
decision is essentially an informed guess.
Technique can only assist up to a point; after that it is guesswork,
or gambling if preferred. If the investor does not like the idea of the
manager indulging in a degree of gambling then he should invest
elsewhere. The risk diminishes with time because ultimately share values
reflect economic growth but is never eliminated.
Another lesson which has to be learned is patience. Investors have to
be prepared for fluctuations and not lose their nerve before the
investment has a chance to perform. They have also to recognise that
some managers will be more successful than others. So it makes sense to
spread investments between managers, so long as the amount involved is
large enough to make this worthwhile.
The nature of the investment business is such that investors simply
have to take the trouble to acquire some basic knowledge of the subject
however tedious they may find it.
A pensions or savings plan may be the largest ''purchase'' they make
after their house. They would not expect to buy a house without doing a
little homework about the area, property values and how to recognise
obvious faults in a building, and it is the same with investment.
A little knowledge will at least enable the investor to know what the
adviser is talking about, which is often the nub of the problem.

Yorkshire Water is joining
the growing list of utility companies handing back money to
shareholders and customers because of bigger-than-expected efficiency
gains during the first five years in the private sector, writes NICOLA
REEVES.
Combined water and sewerage customers are to receive a special #10
''customer dividend'' in September.
The total dividend to shareholders is increased by 21.1% to 27.6p
after a final payment of 19.3p. There is the prospect of continued
strong growth in real dividends following the company's announcement
that it intends to seek powers at its forthcoming annual general meeting
to buy back up to 10% of its share capital.
The company's balance sheet is very strong and even after a 10% share
buy-back would only be 20% geared. The company had positive cashflow
last year, its first since privatisation, of #85m.
In the year to March, Yorkshire Water reported a 1% decline in pre-tax
profit to #142m. However, this was after charging exceptional costs of
#30.2m for restructuring and #20m to fund the ''customer dividend''.
Underlying operating profits improved by 17%.
Since its privatisation five years ago Yorkshire has made efficiency
savings of #150m, two-thirds of which have been given back to customers
including #70m spent on discretionary projects.
The company foresees the possibility of saving a further #250m of
which #125m will be paid out of the utility company to the PLC with the
other half going to customers in the form of discretionary investment in
areas such as improving water pressure and reducing the incidence of
sewage flooding.
Yorkshire Water is one of the few privatised utilities to show a
profit on its non-core unregulated activities. Last year after all
overhead, business development and financing costs, profits were #7m.
Around half the dividend increase in the dividend came from the
profitable realisation of half of its holding in Yorkshire Cable.
Following the results announcement shares in Yorkshire Water lost a
penny to 592p where they yield 5.8%.

MADRID: Some 200 British holidaymakers will move today to other hotels
at the Costa Brava resort of Lloret de Mar after 130 were stricken with
salmonella.
At least eight children were taken to hospital..
A local health official said the outbreak was caused by a pudding made
with contaminated milk.
At a meeting at the three-star, 374-room Don Quixote Hotel a majority
of holidaymakers accepted the offer of new accommodation for the rest of
their stay.
It was after a meal on Saturday that many of the hotel guests were
taken ill with stomach cramps, diarrhoea, and vomiting.
Earlier in the week the Britons were given #10 per adult and #5 per
child to eat out. Breakfast was also paid for at the rate of #5 for
adults and #2.50 for children.

Canberra, Wednesday.
PRIME Minister Paul Keating unveiled his blueprint for an Australian
republic today, saying a non-political president must replace the Queen
as head of state before Australia could truly be independent.
''It is the government's view that Australia's head of state should be
an Australian, and that Australia should become a republic by the year
2001,'' Keating told Parliament.
He said Australians would decide whether to dump the monarchy in
favour of an Australian president in a referendum in 1998 or 1999.
''This is the final step to becoming a fully independent nation,'' the
Labour Government leader told Parliament.
Australia's system of government would remain unchanged and the
president would have primarily ceremonial powers, like the
governor-general who now represents the Queen.
Republicans welcomed Keating's plan as ''statesmanlike'' and
monarchists warned of ''constitutional chaos''.
Keating said: ''We are not a political or cultural appendage to
another country's past. We are simply and unambiguously Australian. We
are not as we once were, in a parent-child relationship.''
Australia was a British colony until January 1, 1901.
Keating said Australia's future lay with its trading partners in the
Asia-Pacific and that it could not credibly claim to be part of the
region until it became a republic.
Under Keating's plan, the president would be elected by a two-thirds
majority of federal MPs, rather than by popular vote and would serve
only one five-year term.
This, and the requirement that politicians could not become president
until five years after their retirement, was designed to make a
president non-political, Keating said.
However the president's powers provoked the most heated debate after
Keating's speech. Republicans were disappointed that Keating did not
plan to legislate presidential powers, but opted for leaving the powers
governed by convention as with the governor-general.
Opinion polls regularly find about 55% voters favour a republic.
* The Foreign Office said any referendum on whether to cut ties with
the monarchy and become a republic was purely a matter for the
Australian Government.--Reuter.

Milan, Wednesday,
SOME of Italy's top fashion names may face trial on corruption charges
as magistrates sought their indictment after a bribery investigation.
Designers Giorgio Armani, Gianfranco Ferre, and Krizia, as well as
fashion king Gianni Versace's brother Santo Versace, were among 25
people who faced indictment, judicial sources said.
''The news is not a great surprise,'' Armani told reporters. ''It is a
formality which is perfectly in keeping with the inquiry which the media
have already amply and exhaustively discussed.''
The request follows a nine-month investigation by Milan's elite
''Clean Hands'' anti-corruption magistrates into allegations that tax
inspectors were paid by fashion houses for lenient audits.
Several inspectors and tax police officers were among the 25 people,
the sources said. An examining judge must now decide whether they should
be committed for trial.
The magistrates' request was made as Milan's designers were busy
preparing for their men's ready-to-wear fashion shows which start on
June 25.
Giuseppe Della Schiava, president of Italy's National Chamber of
Fashion, said: ''The graft scandal isn't peculiar to the Italian fashion
world, it's a national problem.''
Fashion designers have said in the past that the payments were
extorted by rapacious tax inspectors.
A lawyer for Krizia, whose real name is Mariuccia Mandelli, said last
year: ''She was bullied. It was nearly a 'pay up or we'll burn your shop
down' type of racket.''
He added that at the time Krizia had to hand over a #120,000 bribe.
Armani's lawyer, Oreste Dominioni, said last October that the
silver-haired designer told magistrates he had paid a kickback to tax
inspectors for easy treatment during a routine inquiry in 1990.
''Armani had to give in to demands of the auditors and pay,''
Dominioni said. The bribe was reportedly worth #40,000.
Last year's investigation into corruption in fashion, part of a wider
inquiry into the activities of Milan's tax authorities, was launched by
corruption-busting magistrate Antonio Di Pietro, who has since left the
Clean Hands pool.
Designers questioned by him at the time said they were relieved to
come clean and help the war against corruption.
''The investigations being carried out are important for all of us and
for Di Pietro and his fellow magistrates,'' Krizia said then. ''Under
questioning I found myself face-to-face with young people whose gazes
were limpid and direct and honest.''
* Italian Interior Minister Antonio Brancaccio resigned owing to ill
health after being admitted to hospital today. Brancaccio, 71, was the
first member of Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's stop-gap government of
technocrats to step down since the Cabinet was appointed in
January.--Reuter.

RISING newsprint costs are taking their toll on the profitability of
newspapers leading in some cases to reduced numbers of pages in, for
example, the Times and the Telegraph.
The Daily Mail &amp; General Trust (DMGT), owner of Associated Newpapers
which publishes the Daily Mail, is the latest organisation to reveal the
financial damage being caused by rising newprint costs.
It reported basically flat first-half profits of #37.1m before
exceptional items. This compares with #36.9m for the same period in 1994
and the company warned of ''inevitable'' pain from further significant
newsprint price increases.
Trading profits from its national newspapers were depressed in the
second quarter to March. The result from the Daily Mail was affected by
costs associated with its new financial section and the relaunch of YOU
magazine.
Turnover rose by 13% to #417.7m and the dividend was increased by 7.5%
to 4.3p. Net debt at the half-year end was #53m higher at #253m. The
national newspaper titles witnessed increased circulation and
advertising revenue was 13% better than last year's level. However, the
company warned that advertising growth was showing signs of slowing down
in its provincial titles.
The City was disappointed with the profit and cautious trading
statement and the shares fell 55p to 1373 in low volume.
Despite the likelihood of increased newsprint costs, DMGT intends to
press ahead with its media expansion plans in both the UK and US. As
well as the Mail titles it also owns the London Evening Standard and the
cable television station, Channel One.
The company welcomed recent Government plans for changes in
cross-media ownership laws. Its newspaper titles have a 12% share of the
national newspaper market which means that it is able to expand further
into television and radio.
Newsprint is the main raw material for newspaper groups and other
publishers. It costs about 5p for a tabloid newspaper and 7.5p for a
broadsheet. The soaraway newsprint prices are currently the subject of
an investigation by the European Commission.
So far this year the cost of newsprint has risen by 15% and producers
are expected to raise their prices by at least another 20% when
contracts are negotiated in July.
Exceptionally strong growth in demand in the Asia/Pacific region is
responsible for the price increases. Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia
all rely heavily on imported supplies.

TOP Scots law outfit Bishop and Robertson Chalmers yesterday became
the first UK and West European legal firm to open an office in the
former Soviet Republic of Lithuania.
The firm, with offices in Glasgow and Edinburgh, announced its entry
into the fledgling Eastern European market whose currency is the litas.
The move follows 18 months of investigation locally and partner Iain
Taylor said the Vilnius-based office will offer a full service operation
to Western investors and businesses generally, as the Baltic region
continues to be opened up.
''It will be staffed by a Lithuanian lawyer with western training and
fluent English, with back up support by our own lawyers,'' he explained.
Mr Taylor has made several visits to the former Communist state.
Reasons for looking seriously at Lithuania are two-fold.
''Firstly, with the opening up of the old Eastern bloc there are now a
number of excellent opportunities over there for Western business.
''Experienced commercial lawyers giving advice in English are a scarce
commodity, and Bishop and Robertson Chalmers has now rectified that
situation.
''Secondly, it is anticipated that Lithuania will eventually become a
member of the European Union and many firms in the area are already
looking to do business with the West.''
Partner Rodger Murray said: ''Through our new office we can advise
local businesses of the commercial realities of what is to them a new
culture.''
He said Lithuania's laws provide for two forms of foreign investment:
establishment of foreign capital enterprise and joint ventures.
Foreigners can also acquire shares in joint stock companies.
A privatisation programme was launched in the early autumn of 1991,
the year the country's sovereignty was officially recognised.
By the end of 1993, 40% of the state's total capital was covered by
the programme and about 75% of enterprises. The country's main
industrial output comes from fuel, machine building, and food
processing.
The national currency was also introduced that year and the Lithuanian
Government recently linked the value of the litas to the US dollar at a
rate of four to one.

THE new company which has taken over British Rail's maintenance depot
at Springburn is to combine it with Babcock's train refurbishment
business at Rosyth.
Unions will be seeking talks with management of the company, Railcare,
on whether any jobs are at risk from the takeover.
A company statement yesterday avoided the question of job levels,
concentrating instead on emphasising its commitment to the UK rail
market.
Railcare is jointly owned by engineering group Babcock International
and German company Siemens.
Babcock already carries out refurbishment of old carriages at Rosyth,
so it was a natural step to combine the work under the one company.
Siemens is keen to sell rail carriages in Britain, and as most
contracts also include a maintenance provision, by owning the Springburn
works it will improve its chances of gaining orders.
Allan Smith, managing director of Babcock's facilities management
division, commented: ''Railcare will bring together Babcock Rail's
proven train refurbishment expertise, the rail technology of Siemens,
and the skills and facilities of the British Rail maintenance workshops
to create a major new player in the newly privatised rolling stock
maintenance and refurbishment business.''

BRITAIN'S second biggest building society is not prepared to get into
a public auction for another building society as ''it is not
appropriate,'' Nationwide's chief executive Brian Davies said yesterday.
He added that he would not comment on whether a bid had been put in for
National &amp; Provincial which is the subject of a hostile approach from
Abbey National.
N &amp; P has said that it is in discussions with other undisclosed
suitors but no decision would be likely in the short term.
The Halifax and Leeds Permanentbuilding societies are currently in the
throes of a merger to createa major bank with a view to flotation in
perhaps 18 months time.
Mr Davis who became chief executive last July said that he had an open
mind on mergers and acquisitions but would make no rash decisions.
''Building society mutuality has served us very well for the last 200
years but the status may change.''
If Nationwide were to be converted into a bank and floated on the
Stock Exchange, as the eighth largest UK financial institution it would
feature in the top 50 of the FTSE-100 share index.
Other Nationwide officials said that in the longer term, members may
be better served by improved services rather than a one off payment. A
quarter or half point off the mortage rate could prove more valuable
over the life of the loan.
Mr Davis showed a little irritation with the large increase in the
number of accounts being opened with a #100 balance on speculation that
account holders would benefit in the event of either a merger or
flotation.
He said it was not a staggering number and that he is not worried but
questioned whether the hurdle should be raised from #100 which has been
the norm for many years.
Last year Nationwide saw operating profits edging ahead 0.4% to #545m.
Because of a 45% drop in bad debt provisioons, pre-tax profits improved
32% to #345m.
That was struck after a #45.9m loss on the disposal of the estate
agency business where Nationwide is in good company with the likes of
Abbey National and Prudential which have also suffered substantial
losses on that particular diversification.
Arrears have dropped by 32%. But, paradoxically, repossessions have
moved ahead smartly from 3942 to 4370. That has reflected Nationwide
having held back on taking the ultimate sanction against non-payers in
the last couple of years. But in many cases, the society had got to the
point when it had to re-possess in the interests of both its members and
the borrower.
The #35.7bn Nationwide's geographic strength lies in the east Midlands
and the south of England with smaller societies such as Hastings &amp;
Thanet being absorbed by Anglia which in turn was taken over. However it
claims to be the biggest English society operating in Scotland.
Mr Davis said that while the Government has claimed that it is in
favour of home ownership, the noises they have been making do not
support that statement.
He called on action to stimulate the housing market such as reversing
the decision to reduce income support for unemployed  mortgagees and
incentives to first time buyers such as restoring mortage interest
relief to a higher level and reducing stamp duty.

MARKS &amp; Spencer is backing a Professorship of Farm Animal Health, Food

The company is making a grant of #1.5m to the Department of Clinical
Veterinary Medicine to finance the post. The grant is being made in
consort with 10 Marks &amp; Spencer suppliers, including Scot Beef, Northern
Foods, Rank Hovis McDougall and Sun Valley Poultry.
Through the relationship with Cambridge, M&amp;S and its suppliers hope to
be in a position to anticipate emerging issues affecting food safety
associated with animal welfare.
Areas of potential interest include the development of hypo or
non-allergenic foods, the reduction in food poisoning due to enteric
organisms and the development of strong export industry in food from the
UK on the basis of high-quality food manufacturing.
The company's food business is worth around #2500m each year.

FOLLOWERS of fund manager Henderson Administration will be looking to
its new managing director Dugald Eadie, a well-known figure in Scottish
financial circles, to arrest the haemorrhage of UK pension-fund money
away from the group.
Around #1600m left Henderson in the year to March and it is set to
lose a further #566m, though it did gain #1400m of other funds.
The group warned that the loss of pension-fund business was a serious
blow and would continue to hinder its results. It is taking steps to
reverse its fortunes in that area and is preparing fundamental changes
to the division.
Mr Eadie said he was now working ''with urgency to evaluate the future
strategy of Henderson''. He would focus resources on key areas which
would lead to profitable long-term growth.
The group was also affected by poor stock-market performances around
the world which cut funds under management during the year by #500m to
#12.9bn.
On a more positive note, the group announced: ''The retail division
had a satisfying year, adding substantial sums of new money under
management. Investment trusts now represent the single largest block of
client-funds under investment management. Our position as a leader in
the investment trust industry in the UK is of great value and a firm
base for expansion.''
Revenue during the 12 months grew by #2.5m to #67.8m, but pre-tax
profits slipped from #20.3m to #18.1m. The dividend is increased by a
penny to 45p on earnings per share of 56p against 65.3p. Henderson
shares fell 46p to 1065p.

SCOTTISH flag-making firm, Stenhouse Flags &amp; Banners, has been bought
by entrepreneur Robert Buglass.
The firm has been in Cupar since 1866 and is currently managed from
Dundee.
It employs 11 people designing and producing fabric and PVC flags and
banners, with all work carried out using traditional methods.
Yesterday Mr Buglass said: ''I am looking forward to building up sales
over the coming months and years. We already have a great product and a
skilled and loyal staff -- all we need is the sales expertise that I can
bring to this company.''
Mr Buglass was put in touch with the firm by Fife Enterprise.
The investment is in line with its LINC (Local Investment Networking
Company) programme which aims to match potential investors with
companies or business projects requiring financial and business help.
No purchase price is being disclosed for the deal, but Fife Enterprise
confirmed that Mr Buglass's takeover package was put together with the
assistance of Fife regional council and an unnamed bank.

* LONDON and Manchester Group, the pensions, life assurance, and
financial services company, gave shareholders a update of trade at its
annual meeting yesterday.
''We noted in April that gross new-business figures in the early
months of 1995 were depressed,'' chairman David Hubbard told investors.
''That continues to be the case. The dominant reason for this would
appear to be the length and complexity of the sales process under the
new expense disclosure requirements of the Personal Investment
Authority.''
He said new annual premiums business was down by 21% on the year
before and its industrial branch was down by 32%.
''We are concerned at the current trend for the economics of
underwriting small-premium business for the benefit of our Home Service
customers to be gradually undermined.
''The eventual outcome of this could be to deny access to basic life
assurance protection and savings to that sector of the population which
has arguably the greatest need for it.''
He added: ''While we support the objectives of the regulatory
initiatives now in place, we feel that they must take into account, more
sensitively than at present, the very real distinctions which exist
between the characteristics of small, regular-premium, collected
business on the one hand and the large single-premium sophisticated
marketplace on the other.
''Our case is currently being discussed with the regulators and we
look forward to a sensible outcome.''

DESPITE Granada shares approaching a year's high at 604p after good
half-time results, chief executive Gerry Robinson has decided not to
exercise the options on his shares which would net him a gross profit of
#3.1m, writes ANDREW WILSON.
In the half-year, pre-tax profits shot ahead 50% to #155m helped by a
full contribution from the LWT acquisition which helped divisional
operating profits to more than double to #72m.
Mr Robinson is concentrating on the acquisition trail with the once
somewhat dowdy catering sector now seen as being one of great
opportunity as is television. The implication is that it will be in
either Europe or the US although airline catering has been ruled out
with Accor's Eurest a prime target if the price can be agreed.
On the television front, the Government's proposals to alter the rules
governing cross-media ownership could enable Granada to exploit its
substantial programme library and creative abilities to support its own
channel, helped by the arrival of digital television in Britain in 1997.
Profitability has been boosted by improving advertising revenue,
including the restoration of the Unilever account, and contracting which
supplied 41% of the ITV network's original programming.
Leisure and catering advanced by a quarter with Sutcliffe Catering
increasing the number of industrial contracts, particularly with
schools, universities and hospitals.
Motorway services have been boosted by the runaway success of Burger
King, while there is substantial scope to raise profitability once the
nine Pavilion, formerly Rank, sites are upgraded. These were acquired
for #125m.
The rental business continues as a steady workhorse, increasing market
share and which will be boosted by the #45m purchase of DVR direct video
and television rentals. The investment in BSkyB is worth about #450m
compared with a book value of #69m.
The interim dividend has been raised 16% to 3.85p.

FURTHER evidence, if any more should be required after the purchase of
Warburgs and Barings, that UK securities houses are simply too small to
compete in the global marketplace has come from poor results from
Hambros. Dividends have been halved to 7.5p after a final of 3p as a
result of a 58% slide in profits to #37.1m in the year to March. This
was grimmer than the market had expected and Hambros shares plummeted
28p to 183p, upset by a comment from chairman Lord Hambro that there had
been no improvement in trading since the year-end.
The main setback came in banking, though Hambro Countrywide estate
agency and life assurance disappointed. Banking profits were down from
#73m to #35m, with dealing earnings particularly weak. The settlement
business of Hambro Clearing made losses and is being discontinued.
Bad debts rose from #9.4m to #13.5m, which given the economic recovery
must raise doubts over the quality of the loan book. The balance sheet
remains strong with a risk asset ratio of 15.2%.
Another item to catch the eye was a 13% increase in expenses, despite
low inflation and the poor trading environment.
Hambros explains the increase through the expansion of its
stockbroking activities in Australia and private banking in Switzerland,
both areas considered to have long-term growth potential. The group also
stands to benefit from the Government's Private Finance Initiative, to
which the group is an adviser. The #19m settlement of a Norwegian claim
against the group has been charged to reserves.
The expansion of Hambro Countrywide through the purchase of
Nationwide's chain for a nominal sum resulted in higher losses from the
combined business of #6.4m against #2m. The deal raised the branch
network by 300 to 762. The rationale is that it increases the sales
outlets for the insurance activities, though the continued depressed
state of the housing market suggests losses on estate agency will
continue.
Life assurance profits tumbled from #11.3m to #2.9m so the strategy
doesn't seem to be working yet. They were affected by an increase in
provisions to #3m to cover pensions mis-selling compensation and by the
generally depressed states of the market.
Insurance services marked time at #8m. The Beale Dobie offshoot has
just opened an office in Glasgow.

Pretoria
SCOTLAND have won the first round of the upcoming titanic struggle
against the All Blacks at Loftus Versfeld on Sunday.
Yesterday, team manager Duncan Paterson called correctly when the coin
was tossed to decide which side plays in first-choice strip and Scotland
will play in traditional blue, the All Blacks having to make do with
white.
Scotland trained in private yesterday, the management insisting that
everyone will be fit for selection with the team being announced today.
However, Peter Wright is still tender around the ribs, a legacy of the
knock he received in the game against France at the weekend, while
Graham Shiel still sports the panda look, the bruising a result of the
nose injury sustained in the same game.
Kenny Logan, who is to be hospitalised for a sinus operation when he
returns from South Africa, was feeling feverish and retired to bed at
the conclusion of the session.
Scotland will play New Zealand for the eighteenth time on Sunday, the
rubber currently standing at 15 wins to the All Blacks and two draws. If
the Scots are to make a bit of history at Loftus then, as Scott Hastings
said yesterday, meaning that history was just what they intend making,
it will require from the Scots the game of their lives.
New Zealand team manager Brian Lochore declared yesterday that he was
not expecting a repeat of the 51-15 scoreline when the Scots played the
Kiwis on Black Saturday at Murrayfield in 1993.
''A scoreline of 6-3 would do me,'' he said, ''as long as it's six for
us.'' He added: ''I would discount that game. I would rather go back to
the 1987 World Cup, when both sides were in a similar position and we
won 30-3 against Scotland in the quarters, but Scotland gave us, by far,
the hardest game of the tournament -- and that includes the final which
we won.
''Our fellows will certainly tell you that was their hardest game and
we are expecting something similar on Sunday. Scotland are at a similar
stage now. They have had a good Five Nations and they've played well out
here. They are a good, competent bunch of guys who play well for each
other and we certainly respect them very much.''
The All Blacks trained in public, ironically at the Harlequins ground
in Pretoria which has been Scotland's training paddock since arriving
here three weeks ago.
By All Black standards the session was low-key with any number of
spilled passes and the watching Scottish director of rugby, Jim Telfer,
learned little from his spying mission.
A number of players, Frank Bunce, Mark Ellis, Mike Brewer, Paul
Henderson, Blair Larssen and Jaimie Joseph, took no part in training due
to a collection of bumps and scrapes, but the management were admitting
to no real injury worries in advance of naming their team today.
Andrew Mehrtens, the Canterbury stand-off, who is charged with filling
the boots of the inestimable Grant Fox, is, like team-mate Jonah Lomu, a
young player who has made his mark on the tournament.
Mehrtens, a 22-year-old student, who was uncapped when he left New
Zealand said yesterday that he had enjoyed a honeymoon period behind a
Kiwi pack which had been in the ascendency.
'It's all very new to me but I'm finding the whole experience
incredibly exciting. We've got the three pool games out of the way and
now we have Scotland in the quarter-finals. There is lot more riding on
it. If we lose then we're out.
''Not having been around the international scene that long I don't
know much about Scotland. That might be a problem or it might be a good
thing, I don't know.
''One thing I do know, though, is that they are going to give us a
tough game.''
Mehrtens added that the weight of expectation from the rugby public
back home was not something that caused him any concern.
''We are the new wave All Blacks, if you like, and so on the younger
players there is not that same expectation. If we screw up badly then,
maybe, they'll put that down to youth and inexperience.''

PAUL Ince's days at Manchester United appeared to be over last night
when the club gave Inter-Milan permission to talk to the player about a
#6m transfer deal.
The England internationalist has been targeted by the Italians for
several months and they had a #3m offer rejected by the Old Trafford
club earlier this week.
But following talks between Old Trafford chairman Martin Edwards and
an Inter delegation yesterday, the San Siro officials were given
permission to talk to the 27-year-old midfielder.
Inter are believed to have doubled their original offer for the
midfielder, who only signed a new three-year contract last year.
* LES Ferdinand yesterday joined Newcastle in a #6m deal, and it means
a staggering windfall of close to #600,000 for Hayes, the Diadora League
club that sold Ferdinand to Queen's Park Rangers for #30,000 in 1987.
Ferdinand's decision to board Kevin Keegan's Geordie bandwagon took
Keegan's spending to #10m in three days following the arrival of
Ferdinand's fellow international Warren Barton from Wimbledon.
* JIMMY Nicholl, who met Norwich City's chairman Robert Chase in
Edinburgh last night, is expected to tell Raith Rovers today whether or
not he will be staying to lead them into Europe for the first time in
the Kirkcaldy club's history.
Last night Raith's chairman, Alex Penman, who gave Norwich permission
to approach Nicholl, said that if his manager left for England he would
be a ''sad loss, not only to Raith Rovers, but also Scottish football.''
Penman started talking to Nicholl about a new contract a few weeks ago
and the club are prepared to make the former Manchester United and
Rangers defender a top offer to stay.
''However, I don't think money comes into it at this stage,'' said
Penman.

John East, chief executive of the English Tourist Board, introduces a
16-page Herald supplement on the opportunities for holidays in
England.WITH the pleasures of Scotland on offer on your own doorstep, it
would seem a hard task for me -- as the chief executive of the English
Tourist Board -- to persuade you to come across the Border and try
England for your next holiday.
Fortunately, it isn't hard to do at all. England's strength is its
great diversity -- there is quite simply something for everyone. Whether
it be castles, abbeys, waterfalls, pageantry, hi-tech attractions,
bustling cities or sleepy villages it would be hard to ever be bored . .
. or see it all.
You want the seaside? There are more than 3000 miles of stunning
coastline, ranging from the palm-fringed white sands of the English
Riviera, to wide bays of golden sands flanked by spectacular white
cliffs at Bude or the breathtaking red and white cliffs at Huntstanton.
And nowhere is England's quiet holiday revolution more apparent than
at the seaside: if you've been away, you'll be amazed at what's been
happening to transform our traditional resorts: millions have been spent
on spectacular all-weather water wonderlands with wave machines,
whirlpools and flumes; on upgrading accommodation to the highest
standards of comfort; and on new leisure centres and hi-tech theme
parks.
You prefer inland water? England has an unrivalled 2000 miles of
navigable canals, broads and rivers to cruise, with a bigger choice of
boats than the rest of the western world put together, and there's no
need to rough it aboard, with colour TV, microwaves, central heating and
even dishwashers available.
You prefer life in the fast lane? There is a staggering choice of
adventure sports and activities to get the adrenalin pumping, from
paragliding to power boating, survival to surfing -- including plenty of
multi-activity centres where the whole family can find their idea of fun
whether its computing, crafts, Cordon Bleu cookery, roller-skating or
disco-dancing.
Or maybe you would prefer to explore some of England's unique historic
heritage? We all have a natural tendency to take for granted what's on
our own doorstep, but it seems ironic that millions of overseas tourists
flock to appreciate our traditional splendours -- and could probably
teach us a thing or two about our own history. In addition to our
ancient cities and literally thousands of castles and historic houses
open to view, there are hundreds of lively attractions based on our
industrial life, past and present.
When it comes down to it, what most of us want -- and need -- from a
holiday is sheer relaxation. Here again, England scores. Think about it
-- no waiting around at airports, delayed flights, language barriers,
upset tummies from different foods (all problems compounded when you
have young children with you).
Instead, a comprehensive range of accommodation -- from luxury hotels
to the flexibility of self-catering cottages. And behind all these
places to stay is the reassurance of the English Tourist Board's quality
gradings -- whether you opt for a top class hotel, a converted
coastguard's cottage or a caravan, you can look for the ETB's Crown, Key
or ''Q'' symbols and be sure of the facilities and quality you expect of
a ''home from home''.
The outlook for the 1995 season is encouraging. We are seeing a
revival of the fortunes of the English holiday following a low period in
the early nineties -- last year some 49.3 million holidays were taken in
England (up to 16% on 1993) and I suspect things will improve even more
with major investment taking place in new attractions around the
country.
The #25m Fantasy Island theme park -- billed as Britain's first indoor
holiday resort has just opened near Skegness offering more than 40 rides
and attractions for the family. A #30m improvement place is under way at
Bridlington, including the #10m Promenades shopping complex and the
newly restored Edwardian elegance of the north promenade. The huge Lego
World theme park is due to open at Windsor in 1996 as will the new Royal
Armouries in Leeds.
Don't forget you can always receive friendly and helpful advice
through our network of 550 Tourist Information Centres who are there to
provide free information and, in some cases, assist with booking
accommodation.
As you can see, there is certainly a lot happening over the coming
year. Quite simply, there has never been a better time to enjoy England.
It is one Scottish invasion we would be happy to receive.

Faroe Islands
Faroe Islands 0, Scotland 2
THE honest tradesmen that Scotland manager Craig Brown gathered for
this European Championship match provided him with the victory he
wanted.
Two goals, which arrived inside four first-half minutes, pushed
Scotland into joint top position in their qualifying group. And with
three home games awaiting them at Hampden in the autumn, the Scots are
looking towards the finals of the tournament in England next summer.
They won this game because of their first half performance in a clash
which always had the potential for trouble.
A fierce, biting wind which swept across the hilltop pitch did not
help. But, ultimately, all that counted was that Scotland had beaten the
Faroe Islands in this remote football outpost.
They did so professionally, and at times in the first half, they did
so with some style.
It was only after half time that they had trouble, when the wind
became even more of a problem and they found it difficult to put
together the attacking moves which had brought them that first-half
supremacy.
Scotland, of course, had arrived on the islands without 14 players who
could reasonably have been expected to be in the squad.
Half the players whose efforts helped them here, and may carry them to
England, won't be there to take part in the show games if we qualify.
But this night's work, while it may not be memorable, will eventually
prove important as the rest of the group countries start to cut each
other out of qualification opportunities.
The goals were scored by Dundee United midfielder Billy McKinlay and
Bolton striker John McGinlay. They were just reward for the Scots.
In 25 minutes, McKinlay struck for the opener. Moments before, he and
John Collins had combined in a free kick move which ended with the
Tannadice player's shot being blocked well short of goal.
But the Scots attacked almost immediately and it was Collins who moved
the ball inside for McKinlay, whose shot from 25 yards took a deflection
and went past keeper Gens Knudsen, who looked late in going down.
Four minutes later, Collins again was the provider for the second and
decisive goal.
John McGinlay was brought down out on the right. The Celtic player
sent in the free kick, Duncan Shearer reached the ball, but sent his
header off target.
It looked as though it would go wide until his fellow Highland hit man
McGinlay reached it and volleyed an angled shot beyond the keeper and
into the far corner of the net.
Before half time, there could have been more goals for Scotland --
McKinlay twice came close, and twice saw Knudsen save. Then Rob McKinnon
hit a shot over the bar.
The second half became a problem for Scotland. The Faroese
part-timers, helped by the wind, attacked much more frequently than they
had before the interval.
The Scots, who had controlled the game for the whole of the first
half, suddenly found themselves causing danger only in counter attacks.
Twice, Duncan Shearer sent headers close, but not close enough to
cause problems for the determined islanders.
In 62-minutes, Tode Jonsson prodded a close range shot wide of the
goal after a corner kick had swirled into the Scottish penalty box.
Two minutes later there was an indication of the pressure the Scots
now found themselves facing when Colin Calderwood, harried by an
attacker, headed the ball back towards Jim Leighton and the keeper was
forced to push the ball one-handed over the crossbar.
It was Leighton again just minutes later who had to dash from goal to
save at Jonsson's feet as the striker burst through towards goal.
Fifteen minutes from the end, Scott Gemmill replaced McGinlay, and
within minutes he had made his presence felt with an accurate cross
which found Shearer only for the Aberdeen man to miss from three yards.
If he had scored then the Scots would have had the luxury of knowing
that victory was assured.
Instead they spent the last 10 minutes defending their two-goal lead,
and hanging on to ensure that they took the vital three points home with
them. Now they are set for a Euro finale at Hampden, with games against
Greece, Finland, and San Marino.
And three home victories will take them to the finals for the second
time in succession.
Only 3881 fans watched this match -- at Hampden there would be 10
times as many and the Scots have the chance to rekindle the fame of the
Tartan Army.
This match was an exercise they had to go through, a problem they had
to overcome, with strange conditions, even stranger surroundings, and
the worry that once again Scotland would slip against a side that would
not normally trouble them.
The Scots had two players booked -- Calderwood for a reckless tackle
in the first half, and McKinnon for a fierce challenge 20 minutes from
the end.

Christopher Portway explores some of England's most attractive areas
FOREIGNERS are apt to refer to England when they really mean Britain.
This may give smug satisfaction to some of those who live south of the
Border but it justly irritates the rest of the population.
To many English people the notion of England alone as a component,
divorced from the other parts of Britain, is akin to a man with no arms
or legs -- or even a head. Scots, on the other hand, living in a country
of more dramatic beauty, may have other ideas.
Let's take a geographical approach. The North is the closest to
Scotland so not much improvement weatherwise. A glance at the map shows
a long elevated ridge of hills -- nothing on the scale of Scottish
mountains -- designated the Pennine Chain, running right down the centre
from the Borders to the edge of the Midland shires. This is often called
the Backbone of England and the definition is appropriate.
The whole of North Country life owes something to the influence of
that range of hills. Its very situation means it acts as the watershed
for many rivers, and as these drain to east and west they serve all
parts of northern England. On their banks are the great towns and cities
of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Durham and Northumbria. And such cities, today
cleansed of their grime of smokey industry, make intriguing places to
visit. Many of their mills and factories have been transformed into
working museums, their once-gloomy centres delightfully refurbished.
The hills themselves may not have the magnitude of the Highlands but
they evoke similar sentiments. The Lake District, the moors and dales of
Yorkshire, the far horizons of the Northumbria National Park and the
loneliness of the Cheviots are just part of it.
It is appropriate that the heart of England should be the area that
best reflects its real spirit, for despite the existence of such centres
of commerce and industry as Birmingham, Coventry and Rugby, much of it
is not only rural but is the very essence of that rural scene poets and
painters have so often depicted as typically English.
Away from the towns -- likewise made attractive by refurbishment --
there is a sense of permanency not only about the natural landscape but
also the works of man. The cottages, the country churches, the gardens
seem to have been fashioned purely to fit in with their surroundings.
Highlanders will appreciate flat terrain for a change and they have it
in full measure in East Anglia. But flat is not another word for dull
and in this part of the country one is never far from water -- sea,
lake, river and canal -- as well as Norman castles, medieval churches,
eighteenth-century mansions and timber-and-plaster houses. There are the
silent Fens of Cambridgeshire, the navigable Broads of Norfolk, the fine
old colleges of Cambridge, fair cities of the likes of Norwich,
cathedrals such as that of Ely and the quaint townships of Constable
country.
London, of course, is always a draw. It has the River Thames; the very
name is synonymous with London. Of no great size as world waterways go,
and not even the longest in Britain, it has on its banks not only the
city itself but Windsor Castle, Hampton Court and the Royal Palace of
Greenwich.
In its upper reaches is the city of Oxford and, nearby, the delicious
Cotswolds with their photogenic limestone hills strewn with picture-book
villages built by merchants enriched by the wool trade. Roman
Cirencester and prim Cheltenham are the nearest towns, both making good
bases for exploration.
For coastal drama, west is the direction to go, with the high cliffs
of Land's End and the Lizard Point providing a dramatic climax. The four
counties that constitute the stubby leg of England -- Somerset, Devon,
Dorset and Cornwall -- are all rolling green countryside, high chalk
downs, wild moorland and deep valleys, though each jealously guards its
own individuality.
Dartmoor and Exmoor are the two chief national parks, the former
desolate but evocative with mysterious Stone Age settlements dotted
among the heather and bog; the latter a gentler, higher plateau of
wooded combs and bubbling rivers.
And so to the ''sunny South'' of tiny fields, narrow lanes, the South
Downs, woods carpeted by bluebells and, of course, the big seaside
resorts such as bright and breezy Blackpool in the North-west.
Perhaps England's greatest asset -- besides warmer beaches -- is that
its citizens are still a people who are conscious of having had, by and
large, a happy history. And it shows.

Rennie McOwan finds the streets of one of the world's most popular
tourist destinations paved with plenty to do and see
IT was Denis Norden who produced one of the worst jokes about London.
When asked about the health of a friend, he said he had been suffering
from the dreaded disease, Alice. Christopher Robin had gone down with
it.
Like Alice and Christopher Robin in the famous poem/jingle, you can
easily see the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. You can also
see the ceremonies at Horse Guards, in Whitehall and at St James's
Palace. The London Tourist Board has produced a guide at the 1995
Festival of Arts and Culture which gives all the details of where and
when.
There's something absorbing about red, military jackets, shiny armour
and docile horses. Both soldiers and horses on sentry duty must surely
have gone on self-discipline courses because tourists are not above
poking their faces close to the sentry to see if he is real and touching
the horses.
It is also worth noting that Buckingham Palace is opening its State
rooms to the public in August and September.
There is only one sensible way for the stranger to enjoy London and
that is to be an unashamed tourist. It's a city in one sense in that it
is huge and sprawling and the air pollution can be grimy, but it is
really a collection of joined-up villages and communities, particularly
in the suburbs.
It is common to see a little line of shops and a pub surrounded by
houses, roads and tarmac and after a few miles of buildings another
little line of shops and a pub emerge and so it goes on . . . and on . .
. and on.
Life in the London underground is also intriguing for the visitor, but
it is considered bad manners, and unwise, to obviously stare around.
There are few cities which have such a mammoth, mole-like strand of life
where thousands of people in dress ranging from evening suits to jeans,
from turbans to saris, pour in and out of the tunnels, and where nearly
all of the world's major languages can be heard. It's part of the show.
London has a vast array of cultural events including five world-class
symphony orchestras, pop and rock concerts, more than 100 theatres of
which 40 are within walking distance of one another and twice as many
museums as Paris.
My own first choice is currently lying in fourth place in the London
attractions league, which each pull in over half a million visitors a
year. First place goes to the British Museum which attracts over five
million, second place goes to the National Gallery which gets over three
million and third to Madame Tussaud's with over two million.
The Tower of London also gets over two million, but I'd personally
shove it to the top for cash value because everything of interest is in
a compact corner and the Beefeater staff and their colleagues have
developed a helpful manner and a wry sense of humour for the visitor.
The Tower spans 900 years of English and British history and houses a
magnificent display of the British crown jewels, (the Scottish regalia
in Edinburgh Castle are the oldest in Europe), and of armour and
weapons. But all the glitter of the modern jewels cannot take away the
sense of oppressive history which hangs over the Tower of London.
Despite the cheery staff and milling visitors it still has the
atmosphere of cloaked messengers and staff arriving by boat at night
carrying sealed instructions for the incarceration of kings and queens.
You can read the list of prominent people -- including Jacobite
leaders -- who got the chop here and see the beheading site. You can
read messages and grafitti left by people of the blood royal. You can
see the names of queens who went out of favour and of would-be king
makers.
It was in the Tower than men and women who at one time thought they
held positions of unassailable power and who might have ruled nations
suddenly found themselves in a cell and in the grim knowledge that their
life was to end.
The premier league of London attractions includes the obvious choices
of St Paul's Cathedral, the Tate Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum
and Hampton Court Palace.
In addition to St Paul's, it is worth while exploring Westminster
Abbey because of its long links with British (and Scottish) history. I
jokingly told a suspicious guide that the Stone of Destiny was probably
a dud palmed off on Edward I by the Scots and he watched me closely from
behind a pillar all the time I was in the Abbey.
Few things, though, beat taking a boat up the Thames although it is
obviously sensible to pick a good day and ensure there is a route
commentary. It gives the true feeling of London and how the city is a
mixture of ancient history and also the legacy of the industrial
revolution and how the great river played a key role in its development.
You can also travel on the river by boat-taxi, which is great fun and
surprisingly quick.
There is only one sensible way for the stranger to enjoy London and
that is to be an unashamed tourist

Christopher Portway uncovers the often neglected charms of Dorset, one
of the few remaining corners of the old rural England
DORSET is a county the visitor all too frequently passes through or
even overlooks. Consequently this green and hilly land has remained
unspoiled, and is, in fact, one of the last remaining corners of the old
rural England. Many of the finest stretches of the Dorset coast are
preserved by the National Trust and much of the interior has been
officially declared an area of outstanding beauty.
The coast is blessed by long southward-facing beaches. Bright white
chalk intermingles with darker rocks and innumerable small bays and
inlets. The hinterland is the stuff of Thomas Hardy's novels and
visitors who have read Far from the Madding Crowd and other titles will
not only have a feeling for the rich terrain but recognise some places
immediately from his descriptions.
Hardy was born at Higher Bockampton, three miles east of Dorchester,
the county capital which he renamed Casterbridge. He is buried at
Stinsford, a couple of miles north-east, and spent much of his life in
the town where his statue now stands on High West Street.
Guidebooks frequently mention the fine Dorset County Museum in the
town but seldom point out the still expanding Regimental Museum of the
Devonshire &amp; Dorset Regiment housed in the spectacular keep.
The coast is as lovely and untouched to the west of the resort of
Weymouth and the more staid Dorchester as it is to the east from Poole
via Swanage to Britain's most unusual natural phenomena, Chesil Beach.
This barrier of shingle encloses a lagoon which stretches in a 10-mile
crescent from Portland to Abootsbury, itself famed for the swannery
started in the eleventh century by Benedictine monks.
The exceptionally wide streets of Bridport provide evidence of that
town's long history of rope-making, for this is where workers twisted
the strands of hemp in straight lines a thousand feet long. Beyond,
great golden cliffs stretch westwards to the bay of Lyme Regis, a small
resort that owes its name to a charter from King Edward I who used its
harbour to send ships out to fight the French in the late thirteenth
century.
Dorset's inland scenery is as spectacular as its coast, its towns and
villages as picturesque as can be imagined. North of Bridport,
Beaminister is a handsome stone township with a sculptured church tower
and warm stone seventeenth-century and Georgian houses.
At the eastern end of the county, Blandford Forum, one of the most
complete Georgian townscapes in England, acts as the gateway into
mid-Dorset from Bournemouth.
Six miles west of Blandford, the village of Milton Abbas represents a
classic English rural idyll centred about an abbey church which competes
in pictorial glory with Cerne Abbas, the most visited village in Dorset
with its gorgeous Tudor cottages and abbey ruins overlooked by the 180ft
carved giant on the surrounding chalk hillside.
Close by is Shaftsbury, perched on a spur with gradients that deterred
invaders on three sides of the town. The once abbey church of Wessex in
Sherborne heads a town that can only be described as a jewel of medieval
glory and an urban climax to the county of Dorset.
Much of the interior has been officially declared an area of
outstanding beauty

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown saw his scratch team beat the Faroe
Islands last night and declared: ''We now have a great chance to qualify
for the finals of the European championships. The position we are in
means that we can only blow it ourselves,'' writes Ken Gallacher.
Brown added: ''It was not the most elegant performance but the victory
was important. We are now sitting alongside Russia at the top of the
group and the other contenders must envy us our run in.
Faroese boss Alan Simonsen said: ''Scotland played well in the first
half but we did have a chance to cause a big shock in the second half.''
Brown pointed out: ''This was a good game to get out of the way. We
have three points and now we have lost just two goals -- both penalties
-- in our last six games.''
* RUSSIA went to San Marino and hit them with a second-half blitz,
finally to win 7-0.  Dobrovolsky with a penalty after 20 minutes, and an
own goal by Gobbi 17 minutes later gave the Russians a 2-0 half-time
lead. But Kiryakov in 48 minutes, and Shalimov 60 seconds later began
the rout. Beschastnykh, Kolyvanov, and Cheryshev completed the scoring.

Rennie McOwan agrees with those who choose to become poetic about the
beauty of the Lake District
''I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils . . .''
SO wrote the poet William Wordsworth in one of the best-known passages
in English literature, but he caught a fair bit of flak for it. Let's
face it, if such a verse from the love-dove-moon-June school of rhyming
poetry was put forward today at a creative writing evening class, it
would almost certainly be savaged by the tutor.
Cloud rhyming with crowd and hills with daffodils is almost doggerel,
but it caught reality. It caught the breathtaking beauty of the Lake
District and nearly everyone who visits that magnificent area of
North-west England and Cumbria's jewel quotes it at some stage.
Wordsworth also said that writing poetry was a spontaneous overflow of
powerful feelings. It took its origins from emotion which was
recollected by the person later and when in a tranquil atmosphere. He
knew what he was talking about and, of course, he wrote many memorable
poems.
Scholars differ about exactly where on the shores of Ullswater William
and his sister Dorothy saw the famous daffodils, but few would dispute
that it is one of the most beautiful of the English lakes.
In April and May the western shore does indeed have a host of
daffodils blooming there and the National Trust's car park at Aira Force
is a good base to explore the edge of the lake.
Some mountaineers who read the amusing outdoor fanzine, The Angry
Corrie, have taken to calling the Lake District the Ponds, but despite a
chuckle or two that tag won't do at all.
It is a truly scenically gorgeous area with a vibrant folk history and
deserves a dignified and majestic title. The Lakes, in the same way as
Fort William folk talk about ''The Ben'' for Ben Nevis, is entirely
appropriate. It deserves its status.
The hand of man is on the landscape, but some of it can still truly be
said to be wild. It has hundreds of thousands of visitors in a year,
trippers, ramblers, mountaineers, botanists, sailors, literary
enthusiasts, historians, and artists, and like all such areas it can
suffer from time to time through too many people.
On the whole, though, the Lakes remain charming. The little burns,
called backs, still run past grey-stone farms who look as if they have
taken root. Drystane dikes border fields in green and wooded valleys.
The big, blue hills, Helvellyn, Scafell Pike, Skiddaw, the Langdale
Pikes and many others look down on fertile farmland in broad valleys and
some of the loveliest tarns, meres and lakes in Europe.
They are like Scotland in miniature, but more fertile, more peopled,
more developed, softer, less harsh and although they are in the south --
as Scottish visitors see it -- they have the character of the north.
Wordsworth called Lakeland ''the loveliest spot that man hath ever
found'' and the Lake District National Park has a key part to play in
that. It is not an easy role, balancing the life of farms, towns, and
villages against the desires of hordes of people to roam and to play,
but on the whole it is done well. It is a complex issue, not least of
which is noisy powerboats being curtailed or shunted off Lake
Windermere.
Nearly all of the lakes are striking; busy Windermere, the longest
lake in England, with distance glimpses of the big mountains not far
away, Thirlmere which often has a moody look, Coniston and Ullswater and
tiny Rydal Water, evocative and strong names.
Tight planning controls are kept on the historic villages and towns,
but without harming amenities. The town of Kendal is old, grey, and
picturesque and stands on the River Kent. If you want to restock with
supplies or just do a bit of shopping it is an excellent replenishment
centre. It also has a ruined castle.
The tourism authorities distribute lengthy lists of events taking
place in the Lake District and in Cumbria as a whole and Northumbria.
You can catch a steamer from Bowness village on Windermere, and sail
up to Waterhead for Ambleside, the focal point for the central lakes.
Keswick town in the north is a market centre and also a good place to go
on wet days for museums and the shops.
There is endless browsing to be had in the small villages which
delight artists and photographers. They include Grasmere where
Wordsworth lived at Dove Cottage and Rydal Mount. The cottage where he
lived from 1799 to 1808 remains almost as it was.
His final home at Rydal Mount (1813-1850) contains gardens which the
poet laid out himself. His birthplace in 1770 was at Cockermouth -- you
can get a discount ticket covering all three properties.
Hawkshead village has squares, courtyards, and cobbled alleys and if
you fancy a lively literary debate go to Sawrey, ''birthplace'' of
Beatrix Potter's much-loved characters. Dunkeld, where she spent
holidays, makes a similar claim.
Western lakeland also has a strong look. Here lies the Hardknott Pass
with its steep gradients which descend through Eskdale to the coast. The
roll call of lovely names rings out: Westwater, Ennerdale (sounds
familiar) Water, Loweswater, Crummock Water, and Buttermere,
Bassenthwaite Lake and Derwentwater.
As Wordsworth said: ''Beside the lake, beneath the trees . . .'' You
can't beat it.
Wordsworth called Lakeland 'the loveliest spot that man hath ever
found' and the Lake District National Park has a key part to play in
that

WITH next week's Scottish Open Championships unlikely to lift the
gloom that has clouded the Scots' swimmers performances this season,
team manager Danny McGowan has stressed the need to re-examine the club
structure.
''We must resurrect training in the clubs,'' said the Cumbernauld
coach. ''The days of swimmers being willing to bury their heads for
hours in the water have gone. But that's what is needed to improve the
overall standard.
''There also has to be more support for the clubs and the coaches.
After all, that is where the swimmers first start to make their mark.''
At next week's Scottish Championships, the aim for the top contingent
will be to secure one of the eight places for next month's double-header
of a two-week training camp in Lyons, France, followed by a trip to
compete in the Canadian Championships in Winnipeg.
With a number of leading entries from England and Ireland, the Scots
will not have it all their own way next week.
Commonwealth Games medallist Fraser Walker will have to hold off the
challenge from England's James Griffin and David Bower, and Ireland's
Niall Moraghan, if he is to retain the 200m medley.
Alison Sheppard, back with Milngavie and Bearsden, is expected to take
the 50m and 100m free-style, but will face stiff opposition from
fast-improving Dundee teenager Kirsty Hope, who recently broke
Sheppard's 100m Scottish short-course back-stroke record.

JUST a week after one of the most successful Camanachd Cup finals in
recent years, Camanachd Association officials have found themselves
embroiled in a controversy surrounding cup-final venues.
In a letter to Lochaber District councillors, Association secretary
Alister MacIntyre has formally requested that the council remove
advertising hoardings round their pitch at An Aird, the home of Fort
William, which is regularly used for major matches.
MacIntyre has told councillors that the boards which are up at the
field all year should be removed at televised finals, as the Association
has its own sponsorship deal with an advertising agency. The pitch
boards should, he says, be ''removed -- not covered up, as the covers
flap all over the place and could come off, thus jeopardising the
contract we have with the company.''
Councillors are less than pleased with the request and have reacted
angrily to the missive. Councillor Eric Wallace, chairman of the leisure
committee, said: ''If the Camanachd, or any other organisation, don't
like what's at our ground, then it is their responsibility to take the
boards down and put them back up again -- not ours.''
It is believed that the positioning of advertising was also a problem
at last Saturday's Cup final in Oban, although the difficulties about
positioning the boards for sponsors Glenmorangie, along with the
advertising agency material, was resolved without delaying the start of
the game.

DEFENDING champion Sergi Bruguera and former winner Michael Chang had
untroubled passages into the French Open semi-finals in Paris today.
Spaniard Bruguera, seeking his third successive French Open triumph,
dispatched unseeded Italian Renzo Furlan 6-2, 7-5, 6-2 in just more than
two hours while 1989 winner Chang needed just one hour 43 minutes to
beat Romanian qualifier Adrian Voinea 7-5, 6-0, 6-1.
Bruguera and Chang now meet each other in tomorrow's last-four clash
with the winner playing Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia or Austrian Thomas
Muster in Sunday's final.
Rain began falling as Chang led 4-1 in the final set against Voinea,
conqueror of Boris Becker in the third round, but it held off long
enough to allow the match to finish before there was a downpour.
Furlan's attempt to upset Bruguera was hampered by a thigh injury, for
which he received treatment at the start of the second set.
But he refused to make excuses, stressing: ''Actually, the injury
happened against Brazil's Fernando Meligeni. It did not affect me too
much. Bruguera beat me, not the injury.''
Voinea had two set points against Chang at 5-4 in the first set before
falling apart and losing 13 successive games, but he did savour the one
he won in the third set.
The Romanian, well aware this was his last moment of glory in a Paris
tournament he had taken by storm with his shock wins over Becker and
Russian Andrei Chesnokov, raised his arms aloft in mock triumph and made
to shake hands with his opponent.
''I thought he was trying to concede the match,'' admitted Chang.
''But I knew it wasn't over, and he knew it wasn't.''
A few minutes later it was over as a relentless Chang continued to
give the young Romanian no respite.
''The first set was very tight,'' added the American. ''But after the
first, he was looking a little bit dejected. For me it worked out well.
''I sneaked in and hung in there in the first set. It was the crucial
point of the match.''
Voinea saved two match points and seemed to have saved a third before
Chang contested a line call. The point was replayed and the Romanian
lost it, provoking boos directed at Chang from the crowd -- although he
claimed he was not ruffled by the crowd's reaction.
''I like Paris, and I like to play here, he insisted. ''They're a very
expressive crowd. They're for you or against you but I enjoy playing in
front of them.''
* GREG Rusedski will make his debut on home soil as a British player
at the Beckenham Open on Sunday. The 21-year-old Montreal-born Rusedski
has agreed to meet former Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg in an
exhibition match in between the men's singles and doubles finals.
It will give home fans a chance to see their new No.1's 137mph service
for the first time in England since he opted last month to represent
Britain. Tonsilitis kept world No.47 Rusedski out of the French Open,
but after having recovered, he declined an invitation to compete in the
Beckenham tournament.
Edberg, Wimbledon champion in 1988 and 1990, was beaten in the second
round in Paris by Michael Stich.

Manila, Wednesday,
A BRITISH tour operator faces deportation from the Philippines as an
''undesirable alien''.
Immigration authorities today detained Michael Clarke, 48, pending the
start of deportation hearings.
0 Mr Clarke, of Eastbourne in Sussex, was accused in a recent British
television report of supplying Filipino children for sex with
paedophiles.
He has denied the charge and officials of the National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI) have said they found no evidence to prosecute
Clarke.
''It is not necessary that a person commits a criminal act for him to
be deported,'' said Merito Fernandez, chief of staff of the Immigration
Commission.
''He can be subjected to deportation proceedings if his further stay
in the country is considered to be inimical to public
welfare.''--Reuter.

Cape Town, Wednesday,
SOUTH Africa's main black parties avoided outright confrontation
during a rowdy parliamentary debate on President Nelson Mandela's
controversial shoot-if-necessary order to ANC guards last year.
Mandela defended his instruction to African National Congress (ANC)
security guards in March last year to repel an attack by the Inkatha
Freedom Party ''even if they had to kill people''.
''This is nothing more nor less than a statement of the common law
right to self-defence,'' Mandela said during the debate on the killing
of eight people outside Shell House, the ANC's Johannesburg
headquarters, on March 28 last year.
The victims were among at least 55 people killed in Johannesburg
during an Inkatha march against the terms of the first all-race
elections won by the ANC a month later.
Mandela, 76, South Africa's first black head of state, has faced a
barrage of attacks from black and white foes since he admitted last
Thursday givng the order to security guards.
Mandela said he acted on information that Inkatha planned to attack
the Shell House HQ, destroy information, and kill party leaders.
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Home Affairs Minister in Mandela's
coalition government and leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha, attended the
debate but did not speak.
Nor did Deputy President F W de Klerk, whom Mandela accused as
president at the time of failing to act on a warning of imminent
conflict.
National Party speakers repeatedly asked why Mandela had waited 14
months to reveal his role in the incident and demanded a judicial
inquiry.
Inkatha speakers were generally moderate with only secretary general
Ziba Jiyane openly attacking the ANC urging Mandela to resign.
''The ANC is the common denominator in all the violence in South
Africa,'' he said.
Political scientist Robert Schrire said that Mandela had lost status
by ''stonewalling on the major questions'', but the country had won
because of the moderation of the parties.
* A translator today claimed she had been assaulted by Winnie
Mandela's entourage when the estranged wife of President Mandela
returned to Parliament for the first time since she was sacked from the
government.
A tearful Julia Smuts said she intended to bring an assault charge
after a member of Mrs Mandela's team pushed her out of the way so that
their group could enter the building without passing a security
checkpoint.--Reuter.

Kate Rafferty takes a dander down the Golden Mile
IT'S big, bold and unashamedly brassy. It teems with life from early
spring to the moment when the last illumination bulb fades to black --
not quite the place you would think of for a relaxing ''get away from it
all'' holiday, but that doesn't worry Blackpool, a town which can boast
a staggering 16.8 million visits a year.
Blackpool can accommodate countless thousands of visitors at one time,
with 3500 hotels, guest houses and self-catering premises. That means
120,000 beds where exhausted bodies can sleep off the excesses of the
day -- and night.
The North-western resort has been voted the Best Leisure Attraction in
the UK for 1995 by Cellnet in association with Egon Ronay's Guides --
not bad for a town where most of the attractions opened during the
nineteenth century.
A flurry of building activity began, culminating in the 1860s when
both the North and Central Piers opened. Before the dawn of the next
century, these were joined by a South Pier -- also a promenade, a 220ft
Big Wheel, the town's Grand Theatre, and the powerful landmark which
still dominates the skyline -- Blackpool Tower.
Part of the Golden Mile, the tower is a stroll from the three piers
which offer a similar mix of cafes, bars, amusements, rides as well as
the end-of-pier shows.
Two of the newer attractions are situated at the south beach. The
Pleasure Beach is free to enter, then the choice is yours whether to
defy gravity and temporarily lose the colour in your knuckles by
experiencing the rides. It is also home to the daddy of all
rollercoasters, Pepsi Max -- The Big One which is the planet's tallest
and fastest ride at 235ft, with speeds reaching 87mph.
The town does have its quiet corners, however, where more laid-back
visitors can take time to sit back and smell the roses. This they can do
quite literally in Stanley Park which is little more than a mile from
the bustling promenade. The model village, Italian Gardens and the
park's Swan Lake are a surprising but welcome escape.
A visit to the Grundy Art Gallery will also show a different side of
the town. Its cool interior is home to an impressive selection of
Victorian and twentieth-century art. Marton Mere is another quiet area
worth exploring, as is Bispham, both places dedicated to preserving the
area's natural beauty. If this whets your appetite for nature, take an
afternoon to visit the 32-acre Blackpool Zoo.
The town is perhaps even more alive at night, with pubs and nightclubs
for those who wish to see in the next day with a dance, and a huge
variety of well-known entertainers in residence at the town's theatres
for the summer.
For a break later in the year, Blackpool can offer the brightest
autumn break in the country. The illuminations are a year-round job for
45 staff who keep more than half-a-million lamps twinkling in the night
sky, whether they're overhead on the prom, attached to a tram or
lighting up the tower.
A weekend break or a two-week family holiday can be filled with
activities -- Blackpool has a wider choice than those who have never
been may think.

THE Government is stepping up pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to release
their remaining hostages following the release yesterday of 17 more
British hostages. Five Britons are still held.
The Foreign Secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, warned the Bosnian Serbs after
talks in London with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev that while
the release was progress, it was not enough.
''It is not sufficient until everybody is out,'' he added. ''They are
under strong pressures to release all the hostages. These pressures are
directed, indirect, and mobilised in every way we can devise. They have
produced two sets of releases and I hope they produce a third.''
Mr Hurd said the world would not be satisfied until all the hostages
were released. ''Then we can get on with other matters, but the holding
of the hostages prevents that,'' he added.
Mr Kozyrev also welcomed the news. His visit to London has been
important in ensuring that Russia backed the action being taken by
Britain, including sending additional troops. He said Russia too would
keep up pressure on the Bosnian Serbs and was doing everything it could
to persuade them to release all their hostages, who include Russians.
He had talks with the Prime Minister, Mr John Major, at which he was
given the reassurances he needed about the troop reinforcements sent by
France and Britain. They were not there to represent an escalation of
force beyond the United Nations' peacekeeping role, merely to help it
carry out its mandate more efficiently.
It is now virtually certain that Russia will not block the new
resolution on the UN peacekeeping force when it comes before the UN
Security Council in New York.
The contents were discussed at a previous meeting with Mr Hurd on
Tuesday. Mr Kozyrev said that if the draft resolution was as Mr Hurd had
described to him, reiterated by the Prime Minister, then there was no
question of a veto. It is not, however, clear just how far Russia will
go along with any force used to push relief convoys through to Sarajevo
and the other enclaves.
Yesterday's meeting then concentrated on other issues including next
week's G7 meeting of the top industrialised nations, the future
relationship between Nato and Russia, and the need to set up various
forums to develop these links.

THE long wait ended for Gary Jacobs when he learned last night that he
will fight for the WBC welterweight championship of the world this
summer against the holder Pernell Whitaker of America, a boxer regarded
by many as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world at the moment.
Jacobs, from Glasgow, relinquished the European crown when he reached
the No.1 spot on the WBC's rankings, wanting to concentrate all his
attention on Whitaker, but he has had a long and anxious wait while the
Whitaker camp dithered over a venue and a date.
The Americans now have decided that it will be in Atlantic City on
August 26 -- ironically enough, the venue where both fighters had their
last contests on March 11.
That night, Jacobs outpointed Jose Miguel Fernandez over 10 rounds
despite having a badly damaged hand from the early stages, and the
Americans did not show much enthusiasm over the performance.
That, however, could work in the Scot's favour. Said Jacobs last
night: ''This is the chance I have been waiting for all my career. I
know the Americans don't rate me, but I aim to make the best of this
chance.''
Whitaker's camp would seem to see this mandatory challenge from the
Scot as little more than a small hurdle.
I was told from America last night that there are already moves afoot
to have the champion back in the ring in December, and then it will be
on to a unification fight with the WBA champion Ike Quarty of Ghana next
Spring.

Christopher Portway heads south to enjoy a visual feast by the sea
THERE'S no way that geography can be used to justify Purbeck's claim
to be an island, although reaching it from the north and east, with
Poole Bay half surrounding the peninsula, one would be forgiven for
imagining it to be. There's no better method of preserving this illusion
than going there via the vehicle ferry from Sandbanks, within the
borough of Poole.
The main gateway to Purbeck is the market town of Wareham. Here, where
no waterway can provide an aura of isolation, the Purbeck Hills seal the
remainder of the region from the ''mainland''. These gentle but distinct
hills are broken only by a narrow gap commanded superbly by Corfe
Castle, its jagged ramparts standing sinister and ever-watchful even in
ruin.
The modest ''capital'' of Purbeck is the small resort of Swanage,
unpretentious and full of family fun; a town where everybody knows
everyone else. Its chief benefactor was John Mowlem, a name many a car
driver will recognise from waiting in queues of traffic halted by
highway resurfacing.
In 1807 a local quarryman jumped a London-bound brig with ninepence in
his pocket. He came back in more style 37 years later as director of a
street resurfacing business. It was through his patronage that the
small-scale resort was supplied with some of London's cast-off street
furniture, including the flying-fish wind vane from Billingsgate market,
the lamp-posts bearing London street names, and the clock by the pier
which formerly stood near London Bridge.
Swanage Station is back in business though the steam trains run by the
Swanage Railway go only three miles down the line. But, given time and
funds, it could one day link up with BR at Wareham. In the meantime, a
ride to and from Harman's Cross is a pleasing way to see the Swanage
outback.
There are 35 miles of elevated beauty along the Dorset coastline
ending, or beginning as the case may be, with the Purbeck Hills. The
delight starts with the visual feast of Corfe Castle, appropriately
built in Purbeck stone, and the village which still retains a medieval
appearance. The surroundings are splendid green hills dotted with old
stone quarries and limestone cliffs, shot through with Purbeck marble.
These hills are constantly in view whether one is exploring the
picturesque villages such as Langton Maltravers, sampling a pint at an
oak-beamed pub in Kingston, or basking on the broad white beaches of
Studland Bay. From the tiny village of Arne, with its evocative
miniature church, a footpath leads to Shipstal Point and a group of
beaches overlooking Poole Harbour and its islands, of which Brownsea is
the best-known for its bird sanctuary.
Poole itself, larger and of a great deal more interest than Swanage,
is perhaps an even better place from which to tour. Canute chose it as
his base in 1015AD for ravaging far and wide in Wessex and it is easy to
see why. The harbour is sheltered by a narrow mouth and the sweep of
Studland Bay together with narrow Sandbanks, the neck of land jutting
out from the sub-tropical greenery of Branksome.
The natural deep-water harbour -- the second largest in the world --
has ensured that Poole remains very much a nautical centre. The
attractive quay is still bustling with boats, while the old warehouse --
now the Maritime Museum, Customs House and Harbour Office are
substantial memorials to past sea-going days. Much of the old town is
packed with eighteenth-century houses, an impressive Guildhall (now a
museum) and the white Purbeck limestone St James Church.
From the sixteenth century Poole's fishing fleet ventured as far
afield as Newfoundland in search of cod and this, plus the town's
considerable Roman and Tudor past, is reflected in the lovingly restored
old buildings that today house the Waterfront and Scaplen's Court
Museums, which also play host to memories of more recent events such as
Brownsea Island's role in the Boy Scout movement and the port's
contribution to the consolidation of the Normandy bridgehead in the
Second World War.
The ebullient Poole pottery, with showrooms and craft centre leads the
field in the make-your-own-teapot stakes. Adding to the attractions are
a necklace of show gardens such as the famed Compton Acres, the small
and friendly Knoll and Upton Country Park.
Stay with the varied attractions of Purbeck and Poole on the doorstep
makes for a holiday break as enticing as any to be found on the
Continent to which Poole-based Brittany Ferries ferry-liner Barfleur
sails every day.

<HEADLINE>Argentina 'wants to buy Falklands'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>8</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977993918</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINE Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said yesterday that his
government would be willing to pay families in the Falklands around
#500,000 apiece to regain control of the islands.
However residents of the South Atlantic islands met the offer with a
swift and angry rejection, one going to far as to say Argentina was
treating them like prostitutes.
Mr Di Tella is due to meet Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd today to
lobby for sovereignty over the Falklands, which Argentina calls the
Malvinas.
Their meeting comes 13 years after the war which started when
Argentina invaded the South Atlantic islands and occupied them for 10
weeks before being expelled by a British task force.
Although force failed, Di Tella said he expected Argentina to win its
way at some point.
Britain, however, has vowed it will not relinquish control unless the
islanders want change.
''We are fully aware that the British Parliament will never take a
decision over the heads of the islanders . . . We're getting along with
the islanders much better,'' he told BBC radio.
Asked if Argentina was prepared to buy out the islanders, he replied:
''That's a rude way of expressing it . . . (but) monetary payments may
be useful, may be desirable, and we are willing to contemplate that.''
On reports of payments close to #500,000, Mr Di Tella confirmed: ''I
wouldn't like to start haggling now, its too early, but that's the sort
of money, yes. It's a very substantial amount.''
He said such a large payment was possible since the islands'
population was only about 2000.
However Sharon Halford, a member of the islands' ruling executive and
legislative councils, angrily rejected any such offer.
''Argentinians are treating us like prostitutes,'' she said.
''I honestly believe that at the end of the day no-one will seriously
consider this offer, because they would not be able to hold up their
heads wherever they went in the world.''
John Birmingham, another resident, said: ''One pound or one million
pounds will not shift my family.''
In the interview, Mr Di Tella said that Buenos Aires wanted the
islands back for their intrinsic value, not for their rich oil and gas
reserves.
''Symbols and wishes and desires and dreams are a very substantive
part of what happens in the world,'' he said.--Reuter.

A LOCAL authority's plan to hire a charter aircraft to fly 10 members
to England to study the latest shellfish farming techniques has met with
a storm of protest.
Ross and Cromarty District Council, which manages mussel beds off Tain
in Easter Ross, proposes to spend approximately #5000 for the day trip
to Bournemouth, with the money coming from the Royal Burgh's Common Good
Fund.
Tain Community Council and some district councillors are against the
trip but, last week, a bid by the protesters for a less expensive trip
was rejected.
Community Councillor Walter Louden, a former mussel fisherman, said
the idea was ''utterly ridiculous''.
He added: ''If they want to experience mussels, they should go out
into the Dornoch Firth on a windy day and look over the side of the
boat.''
He claimed the councillors and officials would learn nothing from
their day trip.
District councillor for Strathpeffer, Mr Douglas Briggs, said: ''I
have had comments ranging from amazement to fury that the council should
even contemplate doing something like this.''
However, Invergordon councillor Isobel Rhind insists the trip is no
''junket'' and claims it will be a valuable exercise. The full council
has to formally approve the planned trip on June 26.

Sarajevo, Wednesday.
BOSNIAN Serbs tonight freed three UN military observers and a Belgrade
news agency said they were expected to release another group of UN
peacekeepers later today.
The men from France, Spain, and Brazil were taken by helicopter from
the Bosnia-Serbia border to Novi Sad, inside Serbia.
There state security chief Jovica Stanisic, sent by Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic to oversee earlier releases, confirmed that he had
received the men.
Novi Sad is the town where 108 UN peacekeepers released early today,
including 17 British soldiers, are waiting to be transported to the
Croatian capital Zagreb.
An independent Serb news agency, quoting sources in the Bosnian Serb
stronghold of Pale, said up to 50 hostages could be freed later today.
Police sources in Novi Sad indicated they were expecting a new batch
of UN soldiers to arrive there.
There are 148 hostages still in Bosnian Serb captivity and Stanisic
said he expected they would be freed soon.
Hours after the Bosnian Serbs handed over the main group of UN
soldiers, Sarajevo endured the worst fighting in two weeks, killing
three people and wounding 22 others as Serb and Bosnian government
troops battled on the slopes of a hill overlooking the city.
The Bosnian Serbs today appeared more isolated than ever.
Diplomats said Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic appeared to have
miscalculated badly by taking the hostages in retaliation for Nato air
strikes, angering the powerful Serb leader Milosevic and provoking
Western countries to beef up the UN mission.
Greece, which has been involved in negotiations over the hostages,
denied that any deal had been struck on air strikes.
Defence Minister Gerasimos Arsenis said: ''The move by the Bosnian
Serbs was a political, a humanitarian step without asking for anything
in return.''
The 108 peacekeepers freed early this morning at Mali Zvornik were
taken to a holiday complex at Novi Sad, looking exhausted and
bewildered.
They were due to be flown from Belgrade to Croatia and eventually
rejoin their units in Bosnia.
Tonight the first British hostages to arrive home had an emotional
reunion with their families at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.
The four Royal Welch Fusiliers were all slightly hurt in a road
accident when they were taken captive 11 days ago.
Among them was 25-year-old Ian Diamond from Aberdare, one of the 17
Britons released early this morning. He was greeted by his wife
Christine, 24, who married him just a week before his battalion went out
to former Yugoslavia.
''Just for that first moment, only a moment, I believed I'd never see
my wife again,'' said Ian. ''I kissed my wedding ring and my thoughts
after that were always of her.''--Reuter.

Mary Brennn suggests you slip into
something revealing
this summer
THEY'RE new. They're revealing. No two are the same -- hurry! Find the
ultimate fashion accessory for the modern mind at CCA. From tomorrow
they're showing . . . Summer Shorts.
Actually -- not unlike a designer collection -- this event is where
you'll catch up on the ideas, forms, materials currently featuring in
the latest performance and video works of various Scottish-based
artists.''You never see Live Art as a listing anywhere,'' says Ross
Birrell of Group 3. ''The work -- if it's mentioned at all -- gets lost
among theatre, or dance. And that's not what it is. There's movement in
our piece (333 Recurrences), but it's certainly not dance.''
So what is it then? Well, as the different programmes show, Live Art
has many facets. Arlette George's Daska! Daska! does use dance. There's
text involved in some pieces, visual art installations in others. Four
Glasgow-based visual artists have used video as the medium of
presentation, though the results are closer to a time-based performance
than any packaged slice of television. And that's perhaps the key.
Summer Shorts is about adjusting your focus. It's dealing in lateral
thinking. It's to do with finding other possibilities in everyday art
forms, snipping into the accepted conventions to produce -- like a pair
of denim cut-offs -- something with a different message, an alternative
function.
The season itself is the product of a CCA initiative started months
ago. In a bid to encourage and support artists in the making of new
work, Mark Waddell and his team set up a series of informal platforms.
Now these were no public forums. Audiences were invited -- in the main
they were other artists -- and the aim was to provide performers with
constructive feedback as well as a chance to meet other practitioners
and exchange ideas.
Just how effective this process proved is borne out by Stuart Mayes,
whose solo piece, Service, is part of Saturday's Shorts. Mayes had taken
part in CCA-organised workshops with Tim Miller. In January of this year
he took part in a performance platform.
''It was the first time I'd done any solo work. And yes, it was a bit
nerve-racking. When you're working in isolation, it's very hard to
criticise what you're doing. Or be objective. Especially when the
content is very much to do with personal experience. But the feedback I
got at the platform was so positive, it really encouraged me. I came out
of it feeling a lot more secure.'' So much so that Mayes decided to go
ahead with a (successful) application to do a post-graduate course in
Fine Art and Media at the Slade.
At the time they were being introduced, Mark Waddell saw the platforms
as ''an investment in the future''. Summer Shorts is a glimpse of what
that future possibly holds. The public performances are the next step in
a support system which Mayes and Birrell both described in glowing
terms. Birrell summed it up as -- ''having people on hand who are
interested, knowledgeable . . . having space to work in . . . technical
expertise; Bob Pringle (the CCA's resident light-master) looking at what
you're doing, giving you advice, helping to make it work. They even give
you a small fee! You just don't get that elsewhere. It makes you feel
that at last your work matters.''
* You can catch sight of work that is a cut above the ordinary at
Summer Shorts tomorrow, Saturday and Friday, June 16. A panel discussion
on Multiple Perspectives is at 2pm (free) on Saturday June 17.

France Under-21 1, Scotland Under-21 2
TOMMY Craig's youngsters produced a stirring fightback in St Maxime
last night to give themselves an excellent chance of qualifying for the
semi-finals of the eight-team Toulon Tournament.
Celtic full back Stuart Gray scored the winner with a 20-yard drive
six minutes from the end. Earlier Aberdeen midfielder Stephen Glass had
hauled Scotland back into the match after the French had taken the lead
in 46 minutes.
The Scots had their backs to the wall for the bulk of the first half,
although Barnet striker Dougie Freedman had a good goal chalked off for
offside.
Goalkeeper Derek Stillie had produced a string of excellent saves to
keep the French at bay before a blunder by Fulham's Duncan Jupp
presented Histilloles with the opener. The full back was yards short
with a pass back, allowing the striker to round Stillie before
side-footing home.
The Scots equalised three minutes later when persisent play by
Freedman on the left created an opening for Glass, who scored at the
second attempt. The Scots survived a few scares afterwards but their
gritty display was worthy of victory and Gray's winner was fit to win a
final.
Scotland coach Craig claimed: ''If we can only rid ourselves of
self-inflicted wounds, then I believe we can go on to win this
tournament. We showed plenty of passion and no little skill and this was
a hell of a result against the host nation.
''At one stage we looked down and out and it seemed that we had beaten
ourselves yet again. That annoyed me and I made my feelings clear at
half-time. When I heard Mexico were winning the other group match
against South Korea I switched to a 3-3-4 formation and the gamble paid
off.
''Given the effort our players showed, it would have been criminal if
we hadn't won.''
Captain Steven Pressley left the ground with an icepack on a knee
injury he picked up late in the match and he could be doubtful for
tomorrow's deciding tie against the South Koreans.
* A GOAL from defender Sergio Porrini gave champions Juventus a 1-0
victory over Parma in the first leg of the Italian Cup final in Turin
last night.
He headed home an Alessandro Del Piero corner in 11 minutes, with
Parma keeper Luca Bucci colliding with team-mate Dino Baggio as they
went for the ball.
Parma beat Juventus 2-1 on aggregate in the UEFA Cup final last month
but the Turin club gained revenge with a 4-0 win on May 21 to clinch the
league title.

As the world's biggest arts festival looms, Keith Bruce
examines three publications which are required
reading for would-be entertainers
ONE of the less insidious and destructive myths peddled by Hollywood
is the ''let's put the show on right here'' plot line. As anyone who has
been even tangentially involved with the world's biggest arts festival
-- Edinburgh's Fringe -- will tell you, putting on the show is largely
an orgy of form-filling and fireproofing.
A week today Fringe director Hilary Strong launches the first Fringe
programme for which she has been entirely responsible. That bible for
every Edinburgh-bound arts lover, the Fringe brochure, has undergone the
first changes for many years with productions listed in one of eight
categories, and the bulk of the listings -- by company -- being
supplemented by a venue index as well as the A to Z of show titles.
(The aim was to make the brochure easier to use, but one of the side
effects has been to downplay the role of the so-called supervenues,
which previously had their own huge entries in the brochure. No-one in
the Fringe Society is pretending to be upset about this.) There will
also be new promotional opportunities for participating companies, which
point towards an embracing of new technology which makes eminent sense
for something of the size and diversity of the Fringe.
Fringe information is available on the Internet (at http:/
/www.presence.co.uk/fringe/) and a sponsorship deal with Scottish
Television will bring video ''tasters'' of shows to a number of
dedicated televisions throughout the city. In time these intiatives will
be combined and an interactive Fringe brochure will be available on a
CD-Rom computer disc or by dropping into your nearest cybercafe.
Meanwhile, hundreds of hopefuls are preparing to share their talent
with us come August and many are the pitfalls that await them. Consider
this: despite the near-saturation coverage of Edinburgh, only 57% of
Fringe shows are reviewed. That surprising statistic is one of the gems
that can be gleaned from three publications from the Fringe Office which
together are the best #15 a cash-strapped company could spend.
How To Do A Show On The Fringe, How To Sell A Show On The Fringe, and
Fringe Safe all have their roots in earlier guides, but the new editions
are not just better printed, illustrated, and presented, they are also
extensively updated and wittily assembled.
Every year, as The Herald's Robbie Dinwoodie notes in How To Sell, we
in the press hear sob stories about shows where things go woefully
wrong: venues flooded or torched, takings taken and props that walk.
Dinwoodie is disarmingly frank about the role of the press itself.
''Above all, trust us,'' he advises. ''We can only betray that trust.''
There's nothing much to be done about that, of course, but a thorough
reading of these three books would certainly obviate most disasters. How
To Do A Show contains a cautionary tale of a (fictional) company who
make every mistake in the book. Very funny it is too, and chillingly
familiar. Budgeting hints in that book include such practical details as
''parking fines'' (this is Edinburgh after all), and those who have been
there, done that, and lost their shirt offer ''words of wisdom''
(including comedian Simon Fanshawe's description of the whole event as
''three weeks uncluttered by sleep, food, or outdoor exercise'').
But if the two ''How to'' books are full of solid practical
information and guidance, it is Fringe Safe that is the truly terrifying
read. Having had a student company dry the fire-proofing on their
floorcloth over the balcony of my West End flat many moons ago (much to
the chagrin of the neighbours), I had some appreciation of the
requirements placed on aspirant thespians. But the extent of these as
listed by Julian Sleath and Kath Mainland makes it seem a minor miracle
that any performance happens, never mind over 12,000 last year.
But like its companion publications, Fringe Safe is infused with the
ethos of the Fringe. Those who periodically argue for some artistic
control of the Fringe miss the point not just of the event's origins,
but its essential nature. The reponsibility of making a production
happen safely, legally, and successfully is what taking a show to
Edinburgh is all about. That is why there is an ambivalent attitude to
the supervenues and that is why Fringe Safe is rendered readable by the
mordant wit in the text.
For example: ''Every year there are some idiots who hand in their
application the day they arrive in Edinburgh, or the day the show opens.
Surprise, surprise, their shows did not open on time and they lost
box-office takings. Neither the director of the Fringe nor anyone else
is interested in hearing stories like this.''
Elsewhere a chapter on special effects begins with the pertinent
question ''do you need the effect?'' and the possibility of cancellation
is recognised as ''unforeseen opportunities for your cast to see another
play''.
In fact this publication, and its sister volumes, should be required
reading not just for performers but for Fringe fans, and -- especially
-- us hacks, so that we can appreciate the commitment of those who are
hounding us come August.
Any arts journalist who says they have never thought of putting on a
Fringe show is either lying or not very good. Next Thursday I'll be
remembering some of the reasons why I have never quite got round to it.
* The three guidebooks are all published by the Festival Fringe
Society at #5 each.

<HEADLINE>Keeper fined for killing pine marten</HEADLINE>

A GAMEKEEPER who trapped and killed a protected wild animal was fined
#100 at Inverness Sheriff Court yesterday.
Environmental groups were split last night on the value of the
sentence to their fight against illegal trapping.
Craig MacIntosh, 27, an employee at Crubenmore estate, Dalwhinnie,
admitted killing a pine marten on September 21 last year, contrary to
section 11(2) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
The court heard he had been ''going about his normal duties'' trying
to catch mink with rabbit bait in a fenn trap placed in a small burn.
However, depute procurator-fiscal Ms Vicky Rodger said a brick tunnel
leading to the trap had exceeded the two-inch diameter necessary to
protect pine martens. The creature had been caught by the tail, and
later died.
Sheriff B G Donald agreed that MacIntosh, who was supported by his
employers, had mistakenly caught the pine marten, but said the law had
to be observed. The sheriff added: ''I accept you were only doing your
job, but you didn't quite reach the standards needed.''
World Wildlife Fund spokesman Mr Simon Pepper criticised the sheriff
for ''sending the wrong message'' to gamekeepers who might try to trap
protected wild animals.
He said: ''I'm concerned by the lightness of this sentence. Given the
low chance of being caught, unenlightened gamekeepers will not be
dissuaded.''
He added: ''It is pleasing how pine martens have recovered and spread
from their strongholds. They are cherished by a great many people.''
However, Scottish Natural Heritage's area manager for Strathspey, Mr
Dick Balharry, welcomed what he believed was the first successful
conviction of its kind, and said: ''All game managers will now have to
take notice.''
He added: ''My advice to estates would be to ensure the box tunnel to
the trap is not larger than one and seven-eighths of an inch in diameter
for trapping stoats and weasels.
''For mink, cage traps should be used, and the animal killed later.''

NOT even a 10-day break from golf could diminish the challenge of
Laura Davies in the opening round of the American Express Evian Masters
in France yesterday.
Davies had spent her break playing tennis on the new court at her
Surrey home and admitted after shooting an opening 68: ''I really didn't
expect to play so well, but everything went right for me.''
But the world No.1 had to settle for a share of second place, one
stroke behind Helen Wadsworth, who shot a five-under-par 67. Trish
Johnson was five under after 12 holes, but then dropped shots at the
next two holes to lose her momentum and shoot a 68.
The Scottish challenge never reached the starting blocks, the best
they could offer being 75s by Dale Reid and Gillian Stewart. Leading
scores (British and Irish unless otherwise stated. * denotes amateur):
67 -- H Wadsworth,
68 -- A Sorenstam (Sweden), T Johnson, L Davies, L Hackney, C Nilsmark
(Sweden).
70 -- C Hjalmarsson (Sweden), S Gronberg (Sweden), M Bertilskold
(Sweden), M Lunn (Australia), C Dibnah (Australia), H Dobson.
71 -- *K Mourgue d'Algue (France), E Orley (Switzerland), A Nicholas,
L Fairclough, J Soulsby, V Michaud (France), K Pearce (Australia).
72 -- J Morley, I Maconi (Italy), M-L de Lorenzi (France), A Arruti
(Spain), S Dallongeville (France), W Doolan (Australia), C Soules

73 -- *A Vincent (France), R Lautens (Switzerland), S Croce (Italy), C
Sorenstam (Sweden), D Dowling, S Waugh (Australia), F Dassu (Italy).
Scottish scores: 75 -- D Reid, G Stewart. 76 -- J Forbes. 78 -- C
Panton-Lewis.
* COSTANTINO Rocca is not, after all, exempt to play in next week's US
Open championship at Shinnecock Hills as it seemed he was when he
finished second on the European Order of Merit after the Volvo PGA
Championship, the last counting event for that particular dispensation.
However, the USGA count only the first two money winners and in those
terms Bernhard Langer and Fred Couples (both already exempt) took the
places. Couples, although he won the first two European tournaments this
year, in Dubai and Manila, is not a member of the Tour.
Before the Spanish Open, which preceded the PGA Championship,
Couples's name, included from the start of the season, was abruptly
removed from the table. Nevertheless the USGA abided strictly by money
earned and Rocca's earnings of #174,694 fell a mere #306 short of
Couples's total of #175,000, but enough to exclude him from the US Open.

IF this odd production of one of Shakespeare's finest tragedies proves
anything it is that it's unwise to both play the principal role of
Cleopatra and direct the play as well.
Taking her cue from Peter Brook's the multi-cultural ensemble, Vanessa
Redgrave has assembled a veritable united nations of a cast. This, while
admirable in principle, seems a grave mistake in practice: some of the
cast clearly can't understand what they are saying and consequently
speak verse blankly.
There are honourable exceptions, of course: Stephen Macdonald's
beautifully spoken, fully realised Lepidus, David Harewood's exciting
Enobarbus, and Howard Saddler's fine Octavius Caesar.
Redgrave herself is magnetic even when at her most wrong-headed --
this is her third try at the role. Her mixture of tempestuous coquetry
with a touch of Joyce Grenfell and a liberal dose of witch-like cackles
can't hide a fine intelligence, a natural stage allure, and her ability
to stop your heart with a new interpretation of a familier line.
Paul Butler's Antony appears to coast through the play in relaxed and
uncomprehending style. Andy McEwan plays Pompey as a Scottish hotspur.
Antony and Cleopatra is seen by its director as a parallel for Queen
Elizabeth with Cecil Raleigh and Essex as other main protagonists.
That's why the cast wear Elizabethan costumes. The set is sparse,
scattered with loose bricks and pages torn from books. All is rubble and
decay.
This eccentric production is about to embark on a world tour. What
will the locals make of it?

EVERY year, Barclays New Stages throw up at least one revelation and
though it's barely halfway through, it'll be a surprise if anything
comes close to the impact of Ed Thomas and Y Cwmni's murderous,
furiously dark Song From A Forgotten City.
Cunningly framed, vituperatively sardonic and self-mocking, it is 30s
film noir out of Pirandello with a dash of Dylan, lashings of
testesterone and a sexual and physical candour all its own. Identity is
Thomas and Cwmni's pitch -- national, very male, and, in a sense,
theatrical -- like David Mamet come to Cardiff: fast, furious,
disillusioned, urban and obsessed with words, with rugby (the loss of
the national team, 33-3 on international day has left the town utterly
silent), with the macabre, with the mundanity of living, above all with
creativity.
Looking like Ken Campbell's twin brother, Dorien Thomas's half-crazed
writer, Carlyle, lives for something better, for ''connecting'', for
making a metropolis where ''something good can happen''.
An elegy for a nation perceived as going down the pan, invaded and
sucked dry by the sickness of another -- read England -- (there is a
wonderful speech between Richard Lynch and Russell Gomer's crack-drained
Jo-Jo summing this up in personal terms), such is the production's
imaginative energy, the whole adds up, rather, to a bitter kind of
celebration.

Somerset, writes Christopher Portway, is blessed with more than its
fair share of untamed natural beauty
INVARIABLY think of Somerset as a mixture of Devon and Dorset and,
geographically, this is not surprising since it is bordered by both.
Instead of Dorset's south-facing coast however, Somerset bounds upon the
Bristol Channel with a string of small seaside resorts, headed by
Minehead, strewn along the coast.
Somerset contains some of the most rewarding historical towns and
villages, notably Wells with its superb cathedral as well as a multitude
of fine churches. Much of the best scenery is found in Exmoor National
Park, in the Quantock Hills and the limestone gorges of the Mendips.
This is essentially a county to imbibe slowly; quaff the cider but
take time to look at the landscape, to become familiar with the outline
and curves of the downland hillsides so you can tell at a glance which
are the Quantocks, the Mendips, the Brendons, the Blackdowns and the
Poldens; to explore Exmoor from its open heaths to its wooded valleys
and the coastline; to climb Glastonbury Tor and look out across the
ancient ''levels''. Go to see the famed Cheddar Gorge and visit the
agricultural Vale of Taunton in the south. The rewards of doing so will
be great.
It is often said that there are five Exmoors -- each with a
distinctive geographical environment and character -- within the 265 sq
m park, which will come as a surprise to those who imagine it is no more
than an expanse of bog, a kind of lesser Dartmoor. The park is situated
astride the Somerset and Devon boundary, bordered in the north by the
Bristol Channel.
The nearest town is Minehead though its most celebrated township is
Dunster, often looked upon as the gateway to Exmoor. Only some 1200
people live there but visitors treble its population in summer for the
place has preserved in its mellowed walls a warmth and intimacy seldom
found elsewhere. The streets rise sharply towards the thirteenth-century
castle, a great house of rare distinction, that is the seat of the
Luttrel family.
The view from the walls is a foretaste of what Exmoor has to offer
for, within its confines, there is a wonderful mixture of dramatic
coastline, rolling moorland, woodlands and deep-wooded combs, all
merging with the green pastures of the farmland. The coastline is the
highest in England, the cliffs between Porlock and Lynton bear a
distinct resemblance to those along the Californian shoreline, renowned
for their majestic beauty.
Adjoining Exmoor is the 50 sq mile ''island'', aeons old, called the
Quantocks, rising abruptly from the Somerset lowlands. The series of
softly rolling hills are wooded with beech and holly or clad in moorland
heather, bracken and gorse. They enfold deep green valleys where
villages have huddled for centuries. Red deer leave their hoofprints in
patches of soft earth in the clearings of Quantock Forest and the wealth
of foot and bridle paths include a prehistoric track that follows almost
the entire length of the hills.
The best centre for exploring this miniature Exmoor is Bridgewater, a
market town known for its proximity to the battlefield of Sedgemoor
where the Monmouth Rebellion was crushed and after which Judge Jeffreys
conducted his notorious Bloody Assize. Among the north-eastern hills
nestle attractive sandstone-and-thatch villages such as Spaxton, Aisholt
and Nether Stowey, this last where Samuel Taylor Coleridge's cottage
still stands.
From the hills above East and West Quantoxheads, on the winding A39
that follows the coast a mile or so inland, the shift of light, shadow
and colour plays constantly over splendid views across the Bristol
Channel to the rugged fringe of the Welsh mountains beyond.
But Somerset is more than Exmoor and the Quantocks. Cheddar Gorge is
too often crammed with visitors who never have time to look at nearby
Axbridge's Saxon market place ringed by tall seventeenth-century houses.
And there is Cleeve Abbey of red sandstone -- majestic even in ruin --
which overshadows in fame the abbey of Downside, the senior Benedictine
monastery in England. Another abbey, that of Glastonbury, although again
a ruin, continues to conjure a vision of a great ecclesiastic building.
Devon and Cornwall-bound traffic along the busy A303 London-Exeter
highway passes unknowingly by Ilminster, the Ham stone town originating
in Saxon times and listed in the Domesday Book.

LESLEY STEVENSON discovers that the craftsman's art is alive and well
in modern Britain -- if sometimes masked by virtuosity and the expense
of harmony
THE exhibition currently at the Crafts Council Gallery, Out of This
World, is redundantly subtitled The Influence of Nature in Craft and
Design 1880-1995. It is hard to imagine many craft forms not influenced
by nature.
That slight reservation aside, however, it is an excellent exhibition,
well selected and presented and offering a fascinating insight into the
craft world of Britain today, together with a smattering of influential
examples from previous eras.
Those works that come from the Crafts Council's own collections are
particularly welcome when they are things rarely seen now, either
because they have never become part of the craft canon, or because they
are too recent to have found their way into textbooks and permanent
displays in public museums. The wallpaper and fabric designs of Edward
Bawden, for example, interestingly point up the transition between the
literalness of William Morris's and CR Ashbee's nineteenth-century
designs adapted from natural forms and the much more abstracted motifs
of modern craft artists.
The biggest problem with some of the pieces on display is that in
striving for technical virtuosity, sight is lost of the most basic of
craft ideals; truth to materials. Take, for example, the engraved
glassware of Peter Drieser, The Price of Oil. It is impeccably done and
it has a point to make, but there is absolutely no reason why it should
ever have been made in glass.
Contrast this with the magnificent Shipping Forecast of Gary breeze, a
large piece of slate beautifully lettered with a transcript of the radio
shipping forecast which is threatened by an enormous swelling wave
obscuring the lower half of the tablet. Here, the medium, message and
craft are in perfect harmony, and combine to make a piece which uses a
craft form but which transcends its limitations.
Other outstanding works are woven and cut fabrics of Gillian Little;
the intricate, delicate baskets of Dail Behennah, which incorporate
found objects, and the endlessly intriguing Sample Box of Steve Follen,
an old wooden case for microscope slides, filled with vignettes of the
natural world.
There is much in this selling exhibition to delight any visitor, and
the prices range from the very affordable to the extremely silly. The
Crafts Council is to be commended for its excellent and highly
professional work in bringing these makers to the attention of the
public.

THERE is no evidence to suggest that Gulf War syndrome exists,
Ministry of Defence medical experts told MPs yesterday.
The Defence Select Committee was told that the scale of illnesses
suffered by British service personnel who served in the Gulf war was no
different to the scale of similar illnesses in the population as a
whole.
The MPs on the cross-party committee questioned four military medical
experts about the work being done to assess, diagnose, and treat former
Gulf war service personnel who were now ill.
Surgeon Vice Admiral Tony Revell told the committee: ''So far, from
what we have seen, heard, and investigated, there is not a syndrome as
such.''
And Mr Paul Schulte, head of defence medical services, said: ''There
is no evidence of a Gulf war syndrome yet.''
Vice Admiral Revell said that a syndrome would be ''a group of
symptoms producing a common disease specific to service in the Gulf'',
and he said the medical team had not found any evidence of this, but he
added that his team were keen to examine as many former service
personnel as possible to establish a more conclusive picture.
The defence medical experts said it was difficult to pin down a
specific syndrome because the percentage of Gulf veterans affected by
symptoms like chronic fatigue was the same as the percentage of the
general population.
The committee is looking into allegations by Gulf war veterans that a
''cocktail'' of injections and drugs is responsible for their present
illnesses.
Tory MP Winston Churchill asked for statistics of illnesses suffered
by Falklands conflict veterans.
He said: ''In the Falklands, our forces were not given this
mega-cocktail of these jabs that were necessary in the context of a
conflict with the threat of chemical warfare.''
The defence medical team said it would try to produce any information
that could be helpful, but Vice Admiral Revell said the conflicts were
very different and doubted that any such information could be of any
use.
Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark accused the Government of a
''short-sighted'' approach to Gulf war syndrome and called for an
independent medical inquiry.
He produced a draft report from the department of neurology at Glasgow
University which had compared 14 randomly selected veterans with a
control group of healthy people.
The report found statistically significant nerve function
abnormalities in the veterans and concluded that more studies were
required.
Six veterans joined Dr Clark to describe a range of medical problems
they attribute to the syndrome.
Mr Nigel Thompson, 38, who served with the Royal Navy in the Gulf war,
told how he was diagnosed with terminal motor neurone disease within
three months of returning to Britain.
Confined to a wheelchair and speaking through a voice computer, Mr
Thompson called for independent tests on the cocktail of innoculations
given to servicemen and women to protect them from germ warfare and
diseases.

Christopher Portway gets a Northumbrian welcome
THE moment the door opens and the owner stands before you the
realisation dawns that her home is your home. She makes the perfect
hostess -- or landlady if you prefer the old-fashioned term; generous,
jovial, helpful and sincerely interested in your doings. The
five-bedroomed villa overlooking the river Aln where it enters the sea
at Alnmouth is typical of the B&amp;B plus optional evening meal hospitality
to be found in Northumbria.
Having turned her clients into friends she launches into a litany of
what she is able to concoct for dinner and breakfast, the latter
including a choice of 12 cereals.
With a golf course, sandy beaches, river and sea-fishing, Alnmouth is
an unspoiled rural haven close to historic Alnwick with its great castle
known as the Windsor of the North, the evocative Northumbrian coast and
national park.
The coast is well-known with Bamburgh Castle, rivalling Alnwick's in
size, Lindisfarne also known as Holy Island, and the seal-inhabited
Farne Islands its chief attractions. But Northumbria's hinterland is,
perhaps, not quite so familiar. Yet the Bowes Museum at Barnard Castle
is a veritable treasure-house housed in what resembles a magnificent
French chateau. And Hadrian's Wall encourages a gentle hike along its
course.
There is the majesty of the dales; rugged, barren but beautiful, their
rivers broken by scenic waterfalls such as Low and High Force and
destinations like Cauldron Snout peopled by no more than plover and
grouse.
Corbridge and Hexham proudly display their Roman past, the 4000 sq m
national park offers a wild territory of legends, battles of long ago,
the cattle-rustling reivers and a tranquil landscape of lonely
loveliness. The city of Durham shows to the world its timeless
perfection in competition, it seems, with the sweeping natural vistas of
the Cheviots and the Kielder Forest. There are the superb acres of
parkland and garden of Rothbury's Cragside, given to the nation by an
armament king.
It is impossible not to become aware of, and intrigued by,
Northumbria's turbulent history of border fighting and marauding. Almost
every moorland village has its ruined castle or stronghold, such as a
peel tower -- a miniature fort into which families and their animals
would take refuge when the going got rough.
Northumbria began as a no-man's land; a region of fierce and wild
independence north of the Humber. The early Saxon invaders respected
this, inspired perhaps by the remnants of the vast wall left by the
Romans, who had tried to cut it off altogether. It was left to the
Anglians to attempt to turn it into a kingdom ruled from Bamburgh.
In the centuries that followed the warring factions of Celt and Saxon,
Viking and Dane crossed and re-crossed its isolated territory building,
but more often destroying, those faraway pockets of early Christianity
in such places as Lindisfarne and Hexham. Even as remote a figure as
King Arthur fought some of his famous battles on Hadrian's Wall and,
according to legend, is still sleeping in a cave awaiting a new call to
arms.
And it is this Northumbrian landscape that provides the ultimate in
geographical splendour. Rocks have created the skeleton, time has
moulded it, wind and weather, water and ice have shaped it, and the
vegetation has clothed it in raiment of utter magnificence.Landscapes

<HEADLINE>Horan shoulders the Aussie hopes</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>26</PAGE>

<TEXT>
TIM Horan, the Australian centre, will win his thirty-fifth cap on
Sunday when he lines up against England in their World Cup quarter-final
match in Cape Town. His selection follows a 13-month lay-off after major
knee surgery, and is reward for his efforts in the Australian defeat of
a physical Romanian side last weekend at Stellenbosch.
Horan's shoulders are broad after hours of pumping iron. His biceps
bulge, he looks like a small tank ready to do battle, but he is somehow
older now, and back to being one of what was an ever-present deadly duo
-- Horan and Little -- that formed the Australian midfield.
He is sufficiently mature to shrug off comments made recently by David
Campese, who said that he did not agree with the selection of the centre
in the Aussie squad. Bob Dwyer, the Australian coach, has accused
Campese of having ''a loose wire between his brain and his mouth.''
''It's great to be back alongside Jason Little,'' said Horan. ''My
injury had just about everything there was to go wrong in a knee, but
that is repaired now and I have been working hard to get it better.''
Watching Horan closely on the training pitch, it is hard to spot one
leg being favoured. He looks to be back with a bang.
It is perhaps significant that the Australian back play, which was
riddled with errors in the opening game against South Africa, despite
Glen Ella's coaching, matured with the inclusion of the Queensland man
against the Romanians, when he partnered Daniel Herbert in the centre.
He has an innate ability to pass hard with a spin or softly and
accurately, no matter how fast he is running, and he tackles, pound for
pound, as hard as anyone in the tournament -- save for some of the
Western Samoans.
And yet, even the Aussies will know that the inclusion of Horan cannot
cure some of their basic errors.
Still fancied by some to go all the way, the Australians have been
losing the ball in rucks, missing touch kicks, and losing lineout ball
despite the height of John Eales, much to the consternation of their
coaches.
''Hopefully we have all of the wayward kicks out of our system now,''
said Bob Templeton.
Horan sees similarities between Australia's start to the tournament,
and that of England. ''I know that we will be up against one of the best
teams in the world, with world class centres in Jeremy Guscott and Will
Carling,'' he said, ''but, like us, England have been slow starters.
They made a lot of mistakes.
''We certainly have, and it is true to say that we were
over-complicating things in the early games. But that will not happen
now and I have not been too concerned with our form as I always knew
that we would get better.''
Ironically, Will Carling, similar in style to Horan, has been coming
back to his best form. The Australians will know that the English
possess in Carling and his settled back division a threat that is very
real, but which has yet to manifest itself in the tournament.
England's backs have been unable to create the kind of space they have
been used to in the Five Nations Championship, and the much vaunted
English pack has been made to look sluggish.
Like all backs, Horan points the finger at his forwards. ''We have not
been getting the kind of quick service that we want because it has been
difficult with all of the sides obstructing the ball on the ground,'' he
said.
''It's no secret that our back division wants to take the ball up
close to the opposition before moving it some place else, we stand very
flat in our alignment, and that has been hard with the kind of slow
possession we have been given. We have been working on it though, and we
are always confident that we can get things right and win matches.''
If class tells, then Horan, one of the world's all-time great centres
at the age of 25, will put the English on the next flight home. We can
all live in hope, I suppose.

WELL? When was the last time you heard singing like that? It doesn't
matter how much hype the record company and management of mezzo Cecilia
Bartoli drape around her, in sheer musicality, electric onstage
presence, and one of the most dazzling vocal techniques I have ever
witnessed, the intrinsic quality of the girl's performance leaves the
hype in its slipstream.
And it's worth pointing out -- as exemplified throughout her
rapturously received recital before a near-capacity house last night --
that none of Bartoli's success is achieved on the back of warhorses.
(Not a female Nessun Dorma in sight.) Her stamping ground is the
eighteenth century, from which she drew a string of arie antiche that
are fundamentally unsensational.
In arias by Caccini, Scarlatti, Paisiello, and Vivaldi, she caressed
phrases -- holding back, pressing on . . . her control of pace and flow
are near-miraculous. She teases the corners of a phrase till it shivers
with expectancy.
Her control of dynamics is astounding: in the heartbreaking Selve
Amiche by Caldara, she took the volume down to the threshold of
audibility, and the concentrated hush in the audience was almost
tangible. These songs are gems; but it takes Bartoli to prove it.
And she characterises a song like few others can -- from the depths of
melancholy to outrageous flirting: her sultry pulsing in Ravel's
Vocalise and the rippling variations in Viardot's Havanaise made you
ache to hear her sing Carmen.
Before her encores, of course, there were the Rossinian acrobatics
from Cinderella: spectacular, unbelievable clarity, and brimming with
personality. Una notte to remember.

* ENGLAND manager Jack Rowell has kept faith with the team who won the
Five Nations for Sunday's World Cup quarter-final against Australia in
Cape Town. The only change from the side who saw off the European
challenge sees Dewi Morris replace Kyran Bracken at scrum-half.
Bracken is on the bench and Andy Gomarsall, the Wasps scrum-half who
is on the A team tour of Australia, will be flying in as cover in case
Bracken's injured ankle does not recover in time for Sunday.
Morris will earn his twenty-third cap, while Brian Moore will be
playing for England for the sixty-first time. Both intend to retire
after this World Cup. Team:
M J Catt (Bath); T Underwood (Leicester), W D C Carling (Harlequins),
J C Guscott (Bath), R Underwood (Leicester); C R Andrew (Wasps), C D
Morris (Orrell); J Leonard (Harlequins), B C Moore (Harlequins), V E
Ubogu (Bath), M O Johnson (Leicester), M C Bayfield (Northampton), T A K
Rodber (Northampton), D Richards (Leicester), B B Clarke (Bath).
Replacements: J E B Callard (Bath), P R de Glanville (Bath), K P P
Bracken (Bristol), G C Rowntree (Leicester), R G R Dawe (Bath), S O
Ojomoh (Bath).
* IRISH coach Gerry Murphy said yesterday that captain Terry Kingston
and flanker Denis McBride would both be fit to take their places against
France in Durban on Saturday.
''Terry has taken a knock in the ribs and has got a bit of bruising
and Denis has got a bit of a tummy upset,'' said Murphy. ''But they'll
both be fine for Saturday, no question.''
Meantime, the Irish have been given a boost with a goodwill message
from Jack Charlton, manager of the Irish football team, who have a
European Championship qualifier against Austria in Dublin on Sunday.
France have made three changes. Marc Cecillon and Aubin Hueber replace
broken-arm victims Philippe Benetton and Guy Accoceberry, and Louis
Armary has been named at prop in place of Laurent Benezech. Team:
J L Sadourny; E Ntamack, P Sella, T Lacroix, P Saint-Andre (capt); C
Deylaud, A Hueber; L Armary, J-M Gonzalez, C Califano, O Merle, O
Roumat, A Benazzi, L Cabannes, M Cecillon.
* Ivory Coast winger Max Brito, who injured his neck against Tonga,
will be paralysed for life. ''Unless there is a miracle, he will never
walk again,'' said team doctor Jean-Louis Bile.
CHESTER Williams, recalled as a replacement for suspended winger
Pieter Hendriks, is in the South Africa team for the quarter-final on
Saturday against Western Samoa in Johannesburg.
Williams, the only coloured player in the team, was forced to drop out
of the original squad because of injury. But he was swiftly recalled
when Hendriks was suspended for his part in the brawl during the match
against Canada last weekend. Team:
A Joubert; G Johnson, J Mulder, C Scholtz, C Williams; H le Roux, J
van der Westhuizen; O du Randt, C Rossouw, B Swart, K Wiese, M Andrews,
F Pienaar (capt), R Kruger, R Straeuli.

AULD ALLIANCE 700th anniversary celebrations continued last night in
Cappella Nova's clever presentation of words and music celebrating the
marriage of Mary Queen of Scots to the Dauphin Francois in 1558, reputed
to serve as the single most important event in the history of the Auld
Alliance.
Cappella Nova were split in two; a group of 10 focusing on sacred
music and the remaining four offering a selection of secular courtly
love songs. Movements of Sermisy's Missa Philomena were punctuated by
pairs of songs, demonstrating the diversity of musical genres
represented by Scottish and French composers at that time.
By splitting the mass, Cappella Nova took a risk in potential loss of
the emotional impact of the work, but on this occasion each movement
spoke for itself, utterly pure from conception to delivery and aided,
naturally, by the unrivalled acoustic of the cathedral. The concluding
Agnus Dei spoke for the entire performance, graceful and lithe vocal
lines intricately woven into a richly expressive interpretation.
Of the secular songs, the anonymous Scots miniatures O Lusty May and
Support your servand spoke in music rather than words, the poetry
drowning in achingly beautiful harmonies. French miniatures demonstrated
the late vogue for Parisian chansons both serious and irreverent.
The exemplary performance by Cappella Nova was further enhanced by
animated readings by that man who would be Bond, Tom Fleming. His poetic
illustrations of the events surrounding the famous marriage placed the
music in its deserved historical context and put the seal on an
excellent concert.

ROSS Aitken exhibited the best and worst elements of his game at
Letham Grange yesterday, but still did enough to maintain his lead at
the halfway stage of the Scottish Open Assistants' Masters.
The Barassie assistant ensured he would carry a one-stroke lead going
into today's final two rounds with a one-under-par 72 on the demanding
6721-yard Old Course, which he described as having been achieved by,
''swinging like Maurice Flitcroft but putting like Ben Crenshaw.''

<HEADLINE>England need to cool off Gough</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>27</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977993940</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DARREN Gough is fired up to give England the flying start their
captain will demand over the next five days in the first Cornhill Test
at Headingley.
But while Gough can be guaranteed to bowl his heart out before an
adoring Yorkshire public, Mike Atherton and Co. must make sure they keep
his adrenalin level in check. ''This is the big one,'' said Gough with
unmistakeable relish.
''The crowd here love it if there is a Yorkshireman in the England
team and I'm sure they will get behind me. That's got to be a bonus for
the whole side.''
It should be -- provided Gough does not get carried away. ''Bowlers
have to be disciplined at Headingley,'' stressed Atherton. ''Runs are
usually at a premium here and I'm hoping our seamers will use their
knowledge of the conditions.''
As arguably the most exciting talent in English cricket since Ian
Botham was performing miracles, Gough carries a huge burden of
expectation. No-one should try to curb his enthusiasm, but the heirarchy
-- from chairman Ray Illingworth down -- will urge him to stay cool.
England's 24-year-old Yorkshireman has it in him to be a match-winner,
as he showed during last winter's Ashes series before a foot injury
ended his tour.
And asked whether he might feel under more pressure playing on his
home ground and being at least partly responsible for the fact that
Headingley is virtually sold out for the first three days, Gough
answered: ''What's pressure?''
A tricky choice will be the twelfth man selection. With spinner
Richard Illingworth a confirmed starter, newcomer Peter Martin, Angus
Fraser, and Devon Malcolm are the likely candidates. ''Whoever misses
out will be unlucky,'' said Atherton.
Having committed themselves to five bowlers, England possess enough
firepower to dimiss West Indies twice. But by moving Alec Stewart down
the order so he can also keep wicket and recalling Robin Smith to an
unfamiliar opening role they face plenty of criticism if enough runs
aren't scored. Teams:
England (from) -- M A Atherton (Capt), R A Smith, G A Hick, G P
Thorpe, A J Stewart (Wkt), M R Ramprakash, P A J DeFreitas, D Gough, P J
Martin, R K Illingworth, D E Malcolm, A R C Fraser.
West Indies (probable) -- C L Hooper, S L Campbell, B C Lara, R B
Richardson (Capt), J C Adams, K L T Arthurton, J R Murray (Wkt), W K M

<HEADLINE>MENACE ON THE WING IS RELUCTANT TO BE CENTRE OF ATTRACTION.  Lomu has it all taped as he is hidden from media</HEADLINE>

IT WAS the media event of the World Cup. The Dark Destroyer, New
Zealand wing Jonah Lomu, was telling the UK media about his Christian
faith, his passion for fruit, the anguish at being dropped last year,
and how he feels like Superman when he puts on that All Black jersey.
But as he went through the hoops for the benefit of the voracious
media beast, the real Jonah Lomu was upstairs in the team hotel
listening to one of the dozens of reggae tapes he has brought with him
to South Africa for use during those precious moments of relaxation.
This was Lomu on celluloid. Two weeks into the tournament the Kiwi of
Tongan descent with a #3m Rugby League price tag has been declared
off-limits to the media.
The 10-minute Lomu tape was compiled by All Black media liaison man,
Ric Salizzo. ''Jonah has been at the centre of attraction from virtually
the first day we arrived in South Africa. I've had over 300 requests for
individual interviews.
''The media have been ringing him in the middle of the night and that
just can't go on. So, to help you guys, and to give Jonah some peace,
we've put together this video tape.''
Technically, Lomu is far from the finished article, a fact underlined
when he was dropped after the two defeats by France last year and by his
omission from the Kiwi RWC party as originally selected.
However, such is the menacing and powerful presence that the
20-year-old exerts whenever he steps on to the field, there is no doubt
that he has become the personality of the tournament.
He shot to prominence last year at the Hong Kong sevens. Few had ever
seen a 6ft 5in, 20st winger before. He made the All Black Test side for
the two games against France but, with still unanswered questions about
his defensive ability, he was omitted from the side which played in the
Springbok series. However, he was called into the World Cup squad after
an injury scare involving Eric Rush.
Lomu burst on to the world stage with a barnstroming performance
against Ireland, scoring a try and providing one of the mental snapshots
of the tournament when only the combined efforts of four Irishmen
hanging on to various parts of his anatomy halted him -- just -- in his
tracks.
He played then on the left wing, his favoured side, but was switched
to the right for the game against Wales -- acknowledgement here,
perhaps, that wily campaigner Ieuan Evans might have out-thought the
newcomer.
Scotland must wait until today to discover which berth he will occupy,
the shoulder injury sustained against Wales having cleared.
Yesterday, in the bizarre video-taped press session, Lomu dealt first
with his relationship with the media.
''It bothers me. I need to prepare for the World Cup. I just want to
get all these questions out of the way in one hit and then I can
concentrate on what I am here for.''
Auckland Warriors are said to have made a #3m offer for him. But he
said: ''I've not talked to anybody. Other people have. I'm here for one
thing and that is to play in the World Cup for New Zealand.
''It means everything to me to be an All Black and, hopefully, to win
the Cup on June 24, but first we have the quarter-final against Scotland
to get out of the way.
''When the squad was first named and I wasn't in it that was hard to
take. I just kept on pushing and pushing. I wanted that All Black jersey
so much.
''This has been the experience of a life-time -- it's the first time
that I've toured with the All Blacks. There's pressure on us, but it's
pressure that I can live with.
''I just want to show the world what I can do and show them what New
Zealand rugby is all about, and I'm here for all of those guys who
didn't make the All Black side. I want to play to the best of my ability
and go home with the goods.''
Lomu weighed in at 11lb at birth and he has hardly stopped growing
since. He has done little to develop his physique but swears by the
copious amounts of fruit which he devours each day -- on one occasion
demolishing over 100 plum-like feijoas at one sitting.
Unmarried, Lomu is a practising member of a Methodist church in New
Zealand. But his faith, unlike the devout practitioner Michael Jones,
will not prevent him playing against Scotland on the sabbath. ''Yes, I'm
a Christian but not as extreme as Michael. If I'm picked, then I'll be
playing on Sunday.''
Lomu may have become the Invisible Man so far as the 4000 media folk
out here are concerned but, like the man says, on Sunday at Loftus
Versfeld, when he puts on the All Black jersey, it is Superman that he
most wants to emulate.

IT'S not surprising that The Trouble With Frank, Beast Production's
newly commissioned play exploring contemporary perceptions of mental
health, ruffled a few feathers in the psychiatric community when it was
previewed in January. The piece is a brave and insightful attempt to
look at the notion of insanity in a much wider and less confining way
than is common in our society's way of thinking. Indeed, to suggest that
it is simply an issue-based piece would be seriously limiting the scope
and strength of the production.
The character of Frank, convincingly and engagingly played by Rodney D
Stevens, is cast in the tradition of the theatrical fool, a connection
overtly pointed up at the opening of the play, when Frank, having made a
direct address to the audience, is then accused by his psychiatrist of
imagining onlookers.
As an almost ''holy fool'', Frank has the licence to utter words of
wisdom in seemingly unconscious streams of punning and at times
hilarious word association. While the script is witty and moving, it is
the silence and precise pacing of the piece which really lets us into
Frank's world. Fiona Millar's meticulous direction of his every move,
the long opening sequence before a single word is uttered, the
surreptitious bum-scratch, the obsessive ordering and organising of
objects on the set establish Frank's character without labelling him.
More successfully than the humorous but heavy-handed counterpoints
provided by the ''sane'' female characters, it succeeds in throwing open
to question the nature and existance of ''madness''.

Lyn Daly has a free hand when she suggests some places for a family
visit
A FAMILY day out can soon run up a hefty bill -- but with a little
planning, it's possible to have fun for free. Here's a selection of away
days that don't cost a penny.
Avon is calling you to join a tour of its factory in Corby, Northants.
The world-famous cosmetics company takes visitors on a two-and-a-half
hour guided walk around its new multi-million pound operation. The tour,
on selected days, gives an insight into who buys what, when and why.
Add a little sparkle to your free day out with a tour of Royal Doulton
Crystal. The Webb Corbett Glassworks in Stourbridge, West Midlands,
holds twice daily guided tours around the factory. Visitors see the
traditional skills involved in each stage of manufacture. You can buy a
souvenir at the factory shop, but otherwise it's free.
One of England's national treasures, Hadrian's Wall, is yours for the
asking. There are viewing points all along the 73-mile wall which
stretches from the Solway Firth in the west to the mouth of the Tyne. As
well as forts, there are turrets, milecastles and signal towers. Some
areas have to be paid for but lots of it is free and the spectacular
scenery is a bonus.
Nearly 1.5 million people have a colourful and scented free day out
each year at Stapeley Water Gardens in Nantwich, Cheshire. The 64-acre
site claims to be the world's largest water garden centre. Visitors can
wander through display gardens and see the maze of ponds with lilies and
fish. Children can spot eels, sharks, reptiles, Cio carp and piranhas
and the musical fountain.
There are 200 rescued horses, ponies and donkeys grazing in 100 acres
at the Bransby Home of Rest for Horses at Bransby, Saxilby, Lincoln. The
two large farmyards also have goats and chickens and a gift shop.
For a tall story, visit the Newarke Houses Museum in Newarke,
Leicester. As well as toys, games, clocks and mechanical instruments,
there are street and shop scenes from the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries and a feature on the nineteenth-century giant Daniel Lambert.
There's something satisfying about taking a day off and watching
someone else work. You can get a bird's eye view of the skill of glass
blowers at the Teign Valley Glass and House of Marbles at Bovey Tracey
in Devon.
Housed in an old pottery, visitors watch the craftsmen and women
create magical shapes from the safety of a gantry. And if it's a cold
day, all the better -- hot air rises. The history of pottery, glass and,
much to children's delight, the making of glass marbles, is explained.
There's a little tropical paradise awaiting visitors to the unlikely
setting of Roundhay Park, Leeds. Tropical World brings together a
butterfly house with more than 30 varieties, a tropical house, a jungle
experience, aquaria, insects and waterfalls, plus the canal gardens,
rose garden and a lake with fountains. New for this year is the South
American rain forest with desert and nocturnal houses.
For a first-class evening out, drop into the Royal Mail office in
Northampton. Visitors are welcome to join a two-hour guided tour around
the mechanised letter handling facility. Tours are on selected days
throughout the summer.
If there's a rugby fan in the house, then the James Gilbert Rugby
Football Museum is too good a bargain to miss. The small museum in
Warwickshire is packed full of rugby memorabilia and is housed in the
original nineteenth-century building where the Gilbert family made the
first rugby balls.
Picturesque Kirby Muxloe Castle in Leicestershire is a ruined
fortified manor house with moat, gatehouse and towers. It was started in
1480 by Lord Hastings but he was executed and the building was never
finished.
For more history, try Revolution House in Old Whittington,
Chesterfield, Derbyshire. Originally the Cock &amp; Pynot alehouse, the
seventeenth-century cottage was the scene of a meeting of noblemen to
plan part of the 1688 revolution. Video and exhibitions tell the story.
If you're feeling energetic, take a ride on the Consett to Sunderland
railway path. There's a 20-mile stretch of former railway line for
cycling enthusiasts to enjoy. There are also many large-scale works of
art along the route. Alternatively, Derwent Walk, which winds up the
valley from Swalwell to Consett, is 10-and-a-half miles of old railway
line open to walkers, cyclists, horses and dogs.
Bill Quay Farm in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, is a smallholding devoted
to conserving rare breeds close to extinction. Visitors can also enjoy
panoramic views of the Tyne and urban parkland.
Fresh air fiends and wildlife fans will also be in their element at
the River Lee Country Park. The park stretches along the River Lee from
Waltham Abbey in Essex to Broxbourne in Herts. Take your binoculars and
spot otters, bats, kingfishers and 20 species of dragonfly or sink a
line for some fishing. The park is of national importance for
over-wintering water birds. But even if you're not a twitcher, it's a
lovely spot for picnics and walks.
Hamsterley Forest, Durham's largest man-made forest, is another great
fresh air day out. There are circular walks, an orienteering course and
cycle routes plus picnic sites and nature reserve. The visitor centre
will tell you all you need to know about the forest and its wildlife.
The forest drive has tolls.
Anyone who likes a tipple will enjoy the Wine and Spirit Museum and
Victorian chemist's in Berwick-upon-Tweed. There are artefacts from the
drinks' world, a reconstructed chemist's shop.
The Walsall Leather Museum, housed in a restored Victorian factory,
tells the story of the town's traditional trade and is a showcase for
the best of leather goods made today.
For an insight into life in a coal mining community, visit the
Woodhorn Colliery and Church Museums in Ashington, Northumberland. Set
in a country park with a 40-acre lake, models, music, miners' banners
and machinery build a picture of the tough lives led of old. Resident
craftsmen and women demonstrate traditional skills.
You can spend a full day at the Ashton Court Estate in Bristol -- one
of England's largest parks. In the shadow of the Clifton Suspension
Bridge, it contains woodland, parkland, a mansion, a deer park, two
pitch-and-putt courses, orienteering course, grass ski slope, horse
riding trail and visitor centre. If you time your visit right, you may
also get the added bonus of events such as the international balloon
fiesta or kite festival.
Finally, it's free but it's adults only. St Aidan's winery at Holy
Island, Berwick-upon-Tweed, welcomes visitors to its showrooms where
they can sample the mead. Fudge and preserves are also on sale.

LIKE a veal calf to the slaughter, he paws and kicks, bellows and
lows. Somehow, with the animal instinct of the hand-reared politician,
William knows what's coming. Now he tosses back his curly head, swishes
his handsome tail, and says no judge is having his career for dinner.
It's a piteous sight.
But look: here's jolly Farmer Howe. He's saying: ''There, there
William. Never you mind. Mr Scott the Butcher's Man wouldn't know how to
skin a cat, far less slice the knackers off a prime piece of Tory
livestock.
''Fellah doesn't understand our ways. Just you leave it to me. I'll
put him straight.''
Boxed in his cosy crate, Aimless William is not convinced, and his
anxiety begins to spread to the other animals. Major, the gray gelding,
stamps his hoof and wants to know why all this manure is flying about
suddenly. The pigs look up from the trough, snorting, and deny they ever
denied anything. Lilley, the farm whelp, begins to bark at his own
shadow.
It's a bad business, thinks the old farmer, who has been looking
forward to a well-earned retirement. Cold Calculation Farm has been
going to wrack and ruin ever since Great Aunt Maggie Doom passed over.
She's to blame, he tells himself bitterly. Allus going on as how she'd
seen summat nasty in the Cabinet Room, never giving no-one else a chance
to run the place, and forever saying as 'ow there ud allus been a
Starkraver at Cold Calculation, and allus would be.
Seth Heseltine, the handyman, is no help, of course. Spends his days
smouldering and admiring his own darkly handsome looks yet couldn't even
be bothered to put his mark to a simple immunity certificate. What's the
world coming to? Don't them smart city folk with their newspapers and
their ruddy BBC understand that the only way to raise contented voters
is to tell them as little as you can and nothing that's true? What's the
harm in it? It's the way things have allus been done.
Now look at the old place: swimming in muck and just about gone bust.
Farmer Howe pats William's empty head and wonders, not for the first
time, how much of all this the poor, simple creature really understands.
HIS was a happy life before all this began, the farmer thinks. Good
breeding and the best of feed; fattened up at Eton and Oxford;
best-of-show prizes at Education, Health, and the Foreign Office.
William should have been in clover. Now the most he can hope for is that
some kind soul will put him out to grass.
The bitter truth, you see, is that the Starkravers can't afford him
any more. The bottom has dropped clean out of the Waldegrave market. Mr
Scott the Butcher's Man wouldn't take William's word at any price, or so
the local talk has it, but might be prepared, reluctantly, to put him
out of his misery if that would help save the rest of the beasts at Cold
Calculation.
Just then Rifkind the Donkey trots over, braying that he wouldn't know
one end of an Iraqi supergun from another, but Clarke, the farm's very
own Billy Goat Gruff, is nowhere to be seen. Probably off somewhere
fending for himself as usual, the farmer thinks. They're no use.
So what's to be done? Farmer Howe has tried getting the lawyers in,
but the Butcher's Man was having none of it. He's tried explaining that
not telling the whole truth when it's not quite convenient just isn't
the same as proper lying, not really. Everyone had just laughed when
he'd said fib rotation was a traditional method for getting the best out
of your stock, especially when it's diminishing. Somehow they hadn't
believed him.
He looks around the yard. Who'd buy this lot? The wheels are off the
wagon, there are leaks everywhere, and someone's forgotten to lock the
stable door. Pointless, Feckless and Graceless, as the old rustic likes
to think of the herd, wouldn't bring in the price of a parliamentary
question, even boiled down for glue.
The trouble is, after all the sowing they've done the reaping looks
unavoidable now. Who ever thought it would come to this? Things had been
so simple in the old days. The Starkravers had pleased themselves and
anyone who didn't like it could lump it. If they told a few untruths
from time to time that was for the good of the farm, and it was for the
good of the farm because they said so, even if that wasn't quite true
either. That was the way it had always been.
The sun is going down at last on Cold Calculation Farm and the animals
are restless. How can old Farmer Howe tell them the truth now? None of
them would understand what it was.
No, he decides at last, wiping the shit from his shoes, there's
nothing else for it. It's the knacker's yard for the lot of them. That
or the Lords.

Hoylake,
MATCHPLAY over the sprint distance of 18 holes is no respector of
reputations as Gordon Sherry, Barclay Howard, and Hugh McKibbin
relearned yesterday in the first round of the Amateur Championship at
Hoylake. Respectively two down, three down, and two down at the turn,
the first two won identically, leading for the first time at the
sixteenth and finishing off their opponents with great iron shots to the
penultimate green.
With ill-luck, the very bottom of the draw assembled a hot little
Scotch Corner, but instead of this morning playing McKibbin, his fellow
Ayrshireman, Sherry, will meet David Park, a Welsh internationalist and
also a member of the Walker Cup squad, who beat the national champion at
the twentieth.
On an afternoon of unbroken sunshine, but with a cold and tempestuous
north-west wind reinforcing the difficulties of the exposed 7128-yard
links already defended by fierce rough and hard greens, Sherry was four
over par at the turn and Howard three over to France's Christophe
Ravetto and Mortonhall's David Patrick, a student at the University of
Charleston in South Carolina.
Sherry squared at the 547-yard fourteenth, downwind hitting a No.9
iron 180 yards to 12 feet. A chip dead gained a birdie 4 at the long
sixteenth and a No.3 iron to 12 feet to win the next in par completed
the task. Similarly, Howard gradually reeled his man in and then struck
twice decisively, reaching the 558-yard sixteenth with a No.3 iron
second and, turning back into the blast, the 420-yard seventeenth with a
No.2 iron.
McKibbin was in similar difficulties at the turn to Park, who recently
tied for third with Howard in the St Andrews Links Trophy. He, too,
counter-attacked and was one up with three to play, but a bad drive cost
McKibbin the sixteenth and he bogeyed both extra holes, losing the
second and the match to a par.
Coming as he does from Wick, Roger Beames is the furthest travelled
Briton. ''You just have to leave a day earlier,'' he said. Chris Smith,
the British boys' champion whom he beat convincingly, must have wished
he had been delayed indefinitely.
Steven Young, the Scottish boys' champion, also found elevation to
seniority too steep, but David Downie, the Scottish strokeplay champion,
and his immediate predecessor Alan Reid, were four under and one under
par respectively in winning comfortably.
This championship is the 100th in the series and only five players
have successfully defended the title -- Horace Hutchinson, Harold
Hilton, Lawson Little, Michael Bonallack and Peter McAvoy.
Thus the weight of history is against holder Lee James, who beat
Steven Carmichael of Cardross by six and five.

WELSH manager Mike Smith will study video evidence before deciding if
Vinnie Jones still has a future in international football after the
Wimbledon midfielder was sent off for stamping in the 1-0 home defeat by
Georgia in Cardiff.
The 30-year-old Jones clashed with striker Mikhael Kavelashvili after
28 minutes and, as he extricated himself, thrust his foot into the
Georgian's midriff.
Jones received an instant red card and walked off with his head bowed
in shame.
Smith admitted that he may decide never to pick him again if the
incident shows the player's actions were deliberate. ''It's not true to
say that I didn't see it but I didn't see the start of it,'' said Smith.
''I saw him try to pull away and I don't think it was deliberate, but he
certainly trod on him. I really want to wait until I've studied it.
''Up to then, though, he'd been outstanding for me. He'd stayed on his
feet and done all the things I'd asked of him.
''At the moment I would be happy to have him back when he completes
the ban he will get as a result, but after I've seen the video I will
make a decision.
''In his games for me he's done everything that's made him the person
he is. He's a winner and defends very well, and for it to happen like
that was a great sadness.
''But if I thought he was really guilty of malice I'd have to consider
what to do with him. It's about standards at this level.''
Smith believed Jones's dismissal cost his side a fifth defeat in seven
matches. They have one win and one draw, and are bottom of Group 7.
He revealed that Georgi Kinkladze's winner had deflected off Barry
Horne and over Neville Southall.
The victory kept alive Georgia's slim hope at qualifying for the
finals. They have won four and lost three, standing a point below
second-placed Germany for a game more played.
Two penalties by European Footballer of the Year Hristo Stoichkov and
a scrambled goal from Emil Kostadinov gave Bulgaria a stunning 3-2 home
win over the Germans after they had trailed 2-0. Juergen Klinsmann
scored his sixth goal of the qualifying campaign, and Thomas Strunz made
it 2-0 in 44 minutes.
But just as they did in the World Cup quarter-finals last year, when
they were behind before beating Germany 2-1, Bulgaria rallied again to
maintain their 100% record in the group.
The victory gave Bulgaria a maximum haul of 18 points from six
matches, five points more than the Germans.
* NORTHERN Ireland's dream of a place in the finals next summer died
of shame at Windsor Park, Belfast, last night when they lost 2-1 to
Latvia.
They stole ahead in first-half injury time through striker Iain Dowie
but conceded two goals within four minutes during the second half.
Republic of Ireland manager Jack Charlton, who watched the game, was
sympathetic to Northern Ireland's efforts after his own, goalless
experience against Liechtenstein last weekend.
''Conditions were not exactly perfect and made life hard for Northern
Ireland,'' he said. ''The pitch was bumpy and the wind made good
football very difficult.''
But that will come as no consolation to Northern Ireland counterpart
Bryan Hamilton, whose team now are four points behind the Republic, and
five adrift of Portugal, both of whom have a game in hand.
They looked to be in no danger until 58 minutes, when Zeiberlins raced
through the middle of their defence to slip the ball past Alan Fettis.
Four minutes later Astafjevs went through unchallenged as Irish
defenders claimed offside.

THE sun shines almost interminably, making the weather forecasters'
job akin to the task of the quiz contestant asked to name all the
colours of a traffic light. Pretoria, and every other big city, has
motorist frustration each rush hour, never a bad sign economically, and
the hue of the drivers covers the human spectrum. In hotels and
restaurants black faces smile with genuine delight at visitors from
countries near and far. So all is well in the new South Africa? No, it's
not.
Yesterday Professor Merwyn Frost of Natal University opined that the
country was in a far more dangerous situation than before the first free
elections just over a year ago. Another noted political analyst, Dr
Susan Boosyen, observed accurately: ''As the political temperature
rises, so does the death toll.
''The euphoria is wearing off. All the major disputes, which were
papered over to give the impression of unity, have come back to haunt
the politicians. We still do not know, or at least there is no
consensus, about what kind of constitution is right for this nation.''
Sophisticated European powers, not least the United Kingdom, I
reminded my hosts, have not entirely solved that one either -- just ask
the SNP or even the Labour Party. In fact many of the arguments have a
familiar ring.
The dominant African National Congress, for instance, led, inspired,
dominated by President Nelson Mandela, believes in a concept of a strong
union, of a government which takes all significant power to the centre.
He is a long-time admirer of Margaret Thatcher and on this policy they
would hardly differ.
Mandela's sincere, if somewhat paternalistic, attitude -- you can
almost hear him saying ''we in the Transvaal'' while appearing on
television in that region -- is largely supported by the whites and the
Nationalist Party of Vice-President de Klerk. They too like the notion
of a state in which the government says what is to happen, all the time,
everywhere. That is the way they ran the country, after all, in
literally black and white terms.
A curious coalition of liberals, Zulus, and right-wing Conservatives
wants something entirely different. They demand devolution; they wish to
see a federal system in South Africa. And two of these three groups are
prepared to kill for it.
At the heart of this struggle is Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, master of
most of what he surveys in KwaZulu-Natal province, leader of the Inkatha
Freedom Party, and, bizarrely to our eyes, the Home Affairs Minister in
the Mandela Cabinet. Once the darling of the whites, who thought he
could help stave off majority rule, Buthelezi may have lost some
international credibility but he is an educated man, an honours graduate
of the Machiavelli school of politics, and a survivor.
Buthelezi's Zulus have been operating their mainly rural areas, with
their own King, much as they liked for almost as long as the country has
existed. You do not hand over such power with a smile.
In March of last year Buthelezi's boys, thousands of them, armed with
everything from pangas to pistols, advanced on Shell House, which housed
the ANC headquarters, in the centre of Johannesburg. Armed guards fired
on the marchers and eight wound up in the morgue.
Only last week in Parliament, President Mandela admitted he had given
orders to defend the building ''even if you have to kill people''. To me
this seems about as smart as confessing to several murders on one's
death bed, then getting better. But the President is surely protecting
others.
The IFP, of course, is now calling for his arrest, trial, and
imprisonment for being ''an accomplice to commit murder'', which must
bring back a few bad memories for old Nelson.
It won't happen. But what will, until the whole constitutional
question is resolved, is more killing in Natal. Hundreds die, horribly,
every month and the rest of the world should not be sanguine.
Buthelezi, because it suits his purposes, is looking for international
mediation; indeed he claims he was promised it. How Mr Mandela and
indeed Mr de Klerk handle this may prove to be their most important
contribution to history.
There is no organised violence in the former strongholds of the Boers.
The guns are there aplenty, however. A friend of mine watched in morbid
fascination the other day as a group of Afrikaan-speaking tourists
checked in a whole arsenal of weapons at the entrance to a safari park.
Many, not all Afrikaaners, would like to see the creation of a
Volkstaat, their own state within a federal republic. The boundaries of
such a region would need to be drawn with a wobbly pencil to bring the
brothers together, but I wouldn't dismiss the possibility of it
happening.
This country, as it is finding out during the rugby World Cup, has
fallen far behind the international community, because of isolation, in
several aspects of life. Service may come with a smile but it comes
awfully slowly.
Many white Afrikaaners treat tourists, indeed all foreigners, like
they once dealt with blacks. Mind you, shouting louder at foreigners who
do not understand your language is not a Boer preserve.
Yes, it was a lovely sunny weekend in South Africa. During it, in
Johannesburg, 447 homes and businesses were broken into, 363 vehicles
were stolen (81 of them in violent confrontation), 34 women were raped,
and there were 42 murders. Among the last category was a five-year-old
girl.
''It is basically normal, not exceptional figures,'' said police
spokesman Colonel Eugene Opperman. A modern democracy cannot accept
that.

It is easy to see why the creator of All Creatures Great and Small was
so smitten by Yorkshire, says Christopher Portway
THERE'S nothing like a popular television series for putting a place
on the map. No amount of tourist board promotional effort can do it half
so effectively as the small screen epic, be it fact or fiction. And even
when it's over the viewers continue flock to its venue.
Great North Road carves a straightish course through a lot of
unremarkable English scenery before crossing the Border. Yet just a few
miles away on either side of this uninspiring corridor lies countryside
of exquisite charm. The dales and moors of Yorkshire have been known for
generations, but only when it became Herriot Country -- following the
BBC's adaptation of the late James Herriot's All Creatures Great and
Small -- did a fickle public sit up and take notice.
Alf White resided in the small market town of Thirsk. He used to live
in Glasgow but his work demanded that he move south. His mental picture
of Yorkshire had always been that of a stodgy, dull area -- rural but
boring. But his new boss was determined to change that. ''Wait till you
see Swallowdale, Wensleydale and Coverdale,'' he told him. White came
and saw and was conquered.
He recalled that the exact moment when it dawned on him that Yorkshire
was a magical place: pulling his car off the road which leads from
Leyburn over Bellerby Moor to Grinton, he looked in disbelief over the
swelling moorland to the great wooded valley of the Swale. He saw
wilderness and solitude breathing from the bare fells, yet a hint of
softness where the river wound along the valley floor. Thus inspired,
Alf White became James Herriot and through his books and the media,
inspired us all.
His veterinary work was to take him into the wildest country at the
head of the three Dales -- a land of pure air, rocky streams and hidden
waterfalls. In the winter the high fells are a white wilderness where a
man could easily lose his way and die. But in summer when the sun beats
down on the lonely miles, these uplands are a paradise, the air heavy
with the sweetness of warm grass, the breeze carrying a thousand scents
from the valley below.
''Everywhere,'' wrote Herriot, ''there is the strong ambience of
history, the inspiring evidence of bygone things. The Roman camp at
Bainbridge, the abbey ruins of Rievaulx, Fountains and Whitby, the
smaller, poignant remains of Marrick Priory, the Knights Templar Chapel
near Swinithwaite, the fine old castles of Bolton, Middleham, Richmond
and Helmsley, the tremendous cathedrals of York and Ripon.
''Out on the high tops many tumuli, barrows and ancient forts recall
the presence of prehistoric man. And most fascinating of all, perhaps,
are the everyday reminders of the occupation of the Norsemen in the
names of the villages -- Caldbergh, in Coverdale, and the innumerable
hamlets ending in 'by'.''
Recently I too took the road to Yorkshire; not so much in adoration of
James Herriot, Siegfried Farnon or even the delectable Helen but as a
pilgrimage to places I had holidayed in my youth. But my memories were
ravaged by time. Whitby with its gaunt abbey on high I saw only through
the jaded eyes of a tourist, though its seaside attractions are as good
as those of any resort. Robin Hood's Bay remains a pretty place.
Scarborough has long been a favourite holiday destination for families
from the north of England and beyond. The sweep of the bay is an
exhilirating opener to what is always a lively stay. The Yorkshire coast
is often neglected due to the glories inland but once experienced, it's
a place that is sure to attract repeat visits.
York, the capital, holds a magnificence that has never dimmed. ''When
Helen and I walk those streets and go shopping,'' wrote Herriot, ''it is
a fascinating thought that this very area once echoed to the tramp of
the Roman legions. Eboracum was its name then and hundreds of years
later, after the Norman Conquest, it was still the second city of
England.''
Harrogate has not succumbed entirely to the twentieth century either.
Readers of Herriot's books will appreciate that the fictitious Brawton
is, in reality, this very English spa town which retains a gentle
Victorian air.
I shall always remember scampering across the heather of the moors
with my parents in the years before the Second World War and, more
recently, a walk I made with Yorkshireman Steve Bell, across those same
moors seeing the beauty and tranquility that Herriot loved so
passionately.

WE have to report a superabundance of plans to celebrate the ancient
Scottish art of bagpiping. The Perthshire town of Blairgowrie, through
the good offices of the local Ericht Trust, plans to build a #3m
national piping centre.
With money from the National Lottery and contributions from Scottish
Enterprise Tayside, Perth and Kinross District Council, and the general
public it hopes to create a centre of excellence for bagpiping -- with a
400-seat auditorium, and teaching and practice rooms -- which would
constitute a major tourist attraction.
Great idea. In fact that's what they thought in Glasgow three years
ago when they began to build the Piping Centre in the old McPhater
Street Church in Cowcaddens. It is a #3m scheme to provide a 400-seat
auditorium, practice and teaching rooms, and other facilities for
pipers. It is sponsored by Glasgow Development Agency to the tune of
#1m, Historic Scotland for #500,000, Glasgow District Council for
#150,000, and various Euro funds for another #500,000.
The Glasgow centre is scheduled to open before the end of this year.
Unless Scotland can cope with two national bagpiping centres, it would
appear Blairgowrie is in a bit of coo's-tail situation.
We can sympathise with them. Ericht Trust chairperson Alan Stewart
said: ''It has long been recognised that Blairgowrie is in urgent need
ofa major visitor attraction to bolster the area's flagging economy.''
May we suggest the Scottish Jam Museum. Preserves, that is, not music.
Gala performance
WILLIE McKELVEY is not the sort of chap you would normally find
ensconced in a white Rolls-Royce. But the Labour MP for Kilmarnock found
himself using this mode of transport when he turned up for duty at the
weekend as chieftain of the Bonnyton Gala in his constituency.
He coped manfully, waving to the populace but trying not to look too
much like the royal family, as his white Rolls headed the procession to
gala park. Then the Rolls broke down. The rest of the procession left
him stranded.
But help was at hand. Willie got a lift. He was delivered to the gala
in the back of a polis car.
Designer dram
THE Scottish whisky industry, anxious to survive in an era when young
things are buying designer beers and white spirits rather than the
uisgebeatha have taken to promoting Scotch cocktails. We are grateful to
Bell's for the following suggestions from the specially printed leaflet
on the subject:
* Bell's Straight -- One measure of Bell's.
* Bell's and ice -- One measure of Bell's and ice.
* Bell's and Mineral Water -- One measure of Bell's and mineral water.
And for those who have still not grasped the concept they offer
* Bell's Mix -- One measure Bell's, Choice of Mixer, and Ice.
Perfect antidote
THE first thing we should tell you about the Diary's Auld Alliance
anecdote competition is that our mentor, M Jean-Claude Richard, the
French consul in Scotland, is living up to his reputation as the
prize-finder general.
Already we have the Air France two tickets to Paris, the dinner for
two at Le Chardon restaurant in Edinburgh, and the fabulous adventure
prize of a helicopter flight to an Elf oil production platform in the
North Sea (no Greenpeace guerrillas need apply) with lunch afterwards in
Aberdeen.
The latest goodie is a magnum of Bollinger champagne courtesy of
Adrian Laird Craig of Edinburgh who has been allocated the arduous task
of distributing Bollinger in Scotland. Life can be a bitch, right
Adrian?
But on to today's tales of the special relationship between Scotland
and France. As promised, to celebrate 700 years of the Auld Alliance we
are going a bit historical. Step forward Brian D Finch of Maryhill who
appears to know his onions in this respect.
He tells us that after the battle of Agincourt, when things were not
going too well for the French versus the English, a Scot, the Earl of
Buchan, who was over doing a bit of freelance fighting, had something of
a good result at the battle of Bauge, near Anjou.
With 200 men, he took on the English Duke of Clarence's army of
10,000. The Scots won with 1600 English dead compared with 12 Scots and
two Frenchmen.
The pope at the time, Martin the Fifth, was moved to remark: ''Vere
Scoti anglorum sunt tiriace.'' Which bit of Latin, as you all know,
means: ''Verily the Scots are the antidote to the English.'' We'll
settle for that to be going on with.
But back to contemporary Scotland and our close ties with the French.
Ian McLaren Thomson of Bearsden tells us of the time he was called upon
to help run a summer school in central Scotland for sundry Parisian
weans.
One of his tasks was to find lodgings for the female French teacher.
He writes: ''In desperation I asked the obliging ''maitresse'' of the
local corner cafe if she could put a card in her window. To my delight
she said I need look no further. She herself had a spare room.
''She and her husband were the nonpareil of hospitality. Mademoiselle
(the French lady in question) raved about the excellent cuisine, the
unstinting largesse, and the way she had been welcomed en famille.''
Everything went very well and when, some months later, Mr McLaren
Thomson had occasion to pass through the town he looked in to see the
lady host. ''Had Mademoiselle Brillard been in touch since her return to
France?'' he asked. ''Not since my husband flew out to live with her at
the end of August,'' the lady replied with admirable sang-froid.
The Auld Alliance competition game plan is that we will amble up
gently to Bastille Day (July 14) and award prizes as we go.
Entries to the Diary, marked Auld Alliance, at the usual address.
Contributions already discarded include ''Pamela Anderson -- my topless
night of love with General de Gaulle''. And ''Gazza -- why Paris St
Germain is the only team I ever wanted to play for''.

THE Netherlands, boasting seven members of Ajax Amsterdam's European
Cup-winning team, suffered a shock 1-0 European championship defeat by
Belarus yesterday in Minsk. Sergei Gerasimets hit the only goal in 25
minutes.
The 1988 European champions have just 11 points from seven matches and
are in grave danger of missing out on a place in the finals.
A goal on the final whistle by Guy Hellers, one of the few
professionals in the Luxembourg team, gave them a 1-0 win over the Czech
Republic.
Between 1973 and February this year, when they beat Malta, Luxembourg
played nearly 90 matches without a win.
Both these shock results made life even easier for Group 5 leaders
Norway, who moved eight points clear with a 2-0 win over Malta with
goals at the end of each half from Jan-Aage Fjoertoft, of Middlesbrough,
and Sheffield United's Jostein Flo.
Group 2 leaders Spain virtually clinched their finals place with a 1-0
win over Armenia to stay eight points clear of Denmark and Belgium.
Rangers' Brian Laudrup and his brother Michael were on target as the
Danes, the reigning champions, beat Cyprus 4-0 in Copenhagen.
Celtic defender Rudi Vata fired home a second-half free kick to give
Albania a 3-2 victory over Moldova in their Group 7 match in Chisinau.
In Group 1, Poland crushed Slovakia 5-0 but both they and France are
seven points behind Romania, who beat Israel 2-1.

ON SATURDAY I am on holiday for a week and I can't wait. We are
renting a country cottage. I hope to do some gentle walks, potter around
a few antique and craft markets, the odd art gallery, and read some of
the books I was given for Christmas and my birthday. To many people
these activities will appear nothing fancy or terribly exciting, but I
am looking forward to not having to rush around trying to fit a host of
tasks into the day. Instead I shall switch the alarm off and wind down.
I am not alone in the world in feeling frazzled and longing for some
peace and quiet relaxation. A new generation of young people across the
industrialised world is seeking a better balance between life and work.
According to a report published earlier this week by Demos, the
independent think-tank, right across society there is a sense of time
being squeezed for the majority of people in Britain. The cause is the
combination of increased working hours, rising travel times, and greater
female participation in the workforce.
Working-time was one of the first conditions to be regulated following
the Industrial Revolution, with legislation introduced in Britain in
1802. However, the organisation of time is not what it used to be.
Whether in work, leisure or family life, flexibility is on the increase
in terms of how time is used. A number of interrelated factors has
contributed to these changes, most notably technology. This is
transforming the nature of economic life with vastly greater flows of
information and much tighter control over time. Increased productivity
has also played its part. The fact is that an hour's work is now worth
25 times what it was in 1830, which means time is now viewed as a
valuable resource that needs to be managed, planned, and used more
intensively. Time is increasingly money.
However, this increased flexibility has not been met with a
corresponding increase in quality of life. All that happens for a
majority of people is that they try to pack even more into the 24-hour
day, whether during the week or at weekends. Research shows 44% of the
workforce now report coming home exhausted.
Stress has become a major occupational hazard, its incidence replacing
more traditional work-related illnesses such as pneumoconiosis and
deafness. Efforts to maximise profits and efficiency are being made
throughout both private and public sectors, which invariably means job
losses. For those left in paid employment, this inevitably means an
increased workload.
According to Personnel Today, one in eight managers works more than 60
hours, and 40% more than fifty hours. Another survey suggests that one
in four managers takes work home several times a week and a further 30%
at least one day a week. The number of people holding down two jobs has
increased markedly in recent years. Around 5% of people in work are now
thought to have second jobs, double the proportion in 1981.
After decades in which time and effort have been spent focused on
maximising income, attention is now switching to quality of life. This
is an inevitable consequence of becoming a richer society in real terms.
While money does not buy you happiness it should enable you to make
choices about how you live your life. For an increasing number of people
that choice is to achieve a better balance between work, family, and
leisure time. Invariably for those in full-time work outside the home
this means working part-time or perhaps becoming self-employed. This
route is being taken by an increasing number of women, particularly
those with young children.
Research suggests over 70% of British workers working over 40 hours
want to work less, and although 53% of women and 14% of men would prefer
to work part-time, only 40% and 3% respectively are able to do so.
Currently, only in those parts of the economy where demand is high can
employees make demands for more flexible working in the form of
job-sharing, sabbaticals, flexible hours, and parental leave. The
long-term desire must be for flexibility to be introduced across the
board, enabling people to have a real choice in how they allocate their
personal time.
The UK works harder than other European countries and takes fewer
holidays. EU data shows British employees work on average a little over
42 hours per week, while the average German works under 41 hours and the
average Belgian works 39.5 hours.
I think it's time we had a rest. However, for this to be possible
requires policies from government to help make life easier, which may
involve tackling vested interests, as we saw recently in the
deregulation of Sunday shopping in England and Wales. The aim must be
for work to become a servant of life rather than the other way around.
Some of the measures called for by Demos provide food for thought. It
suggests, among other things, time audits of Government policies, such
as tax self-assessment, that pass time burdens out to the public, and a
re-thinking of how public institutions such as schools and surgeries are
run to fit the reality of dual-working couples.
In addition it calls for creative city policies further to develop the
night-time and weekend economy as has already happened to some extent in
cities such as Glasgow and Manchester. This would embrace ideas such as
the development of new residential accommodation in the city centre,
promoting street entertainments, encouraging the opening of new cafes
and bars, and the relaxation of licensing resrictions.

IN a further attempt to misinform regarding the nationality of Robert
the Bruce, Duncan Bryson accuses me of not comparing like with like but
then promptly compares medieval Scotland with ''the context of modern
democratic nationhood'' (June 5).
Mr Bryson asserts that the aristocracy of medieval England and
Scotland were French and cites ''a scholarly alliance between Scottish
and English historians to conceal this aspect of our past''.
The historians participating in this amazing conspiracy are not
revealed but Mr Bryson's claim that ''medieval baronial Scotland was
created by the Normans'' carries the rewriting of history a little too
far.
Mr Bryson's plethora of quotations from the time of the Battle of the
Standard is all very well, but he ignores the events of 150 or so
subsequent years up to Bruce's birth and, conveniently, he overlooks the
lineage of Bruce's grandfather, relating him to the royal (non-Norman)
line of Scotland.
It is amazing to be asked to believe that the Scottish Wars of
Independence were fought between an assortment of French nobles, led by
French kings.
Also, it seems unlikely that the Declaration of Arbroath was compiled
by French nobles stating that they would ''never be subject to the
dominion of the English'' (the ''English'' being French as well).
The Harcla Treaty of 1323 refers to England, under Edward II, and
Scotland, under Bruce, as each having a king of its own nation, and,
whether Mr Bryson likes it or not, nations they were.

IN the recent discussion about Robert the Bruce, his nationality and
language, I am surprised no-one has yet mentioned the research of Beryl
Platts (Scottish Hazard), which argues persuasively that he was of
neither Norman nor French descent, but Flemish, as were many of the
so-called Norman conquering army.
Flanders was a remnant of the Frankish empire, so a reference to
Franks is not the same as to the French.
Flanders in 1066 extended from Boulogne to beyond Ghent, and the
Bruce's antecedent may well have been Robert of Bruge (incidentally more
like ''Bruce'' than the commonly quoted origin of Brix in Normandy),
recorded in 1046, who disappears from Flemish records in the year that
Matilda of Flanders married the Conqueror to be.
A fair assumption would be that he went with her to Normandy, but does
that make him a Norman? (Do the family's years of residence in England
make them English?)
Of course by 250 years later is it sensible to call any incomer other
than a native of his country of residence? I understood Bruce spoke
Gaelic and English. I advise anyone who has not done so to read Beryl
Platt's evidence, which also claims Flemish origins for many
distinguished Scottish families such as Cameron, Campbell, and Douglas.
Why the fuss about Bruce, anyway -- no-one denies that the Stewart
kings of Scotland were not Norman, French, or even Flemish, but of
Breton origin.

I DO NOT wish to spoil Tom Shields's fun (Diary, June 1) but it is
nonsense to claim that the Auld Alliance was beneficial to Scotland.
Baliol, ''that pathetic man'' (William Wallace, by Andrew Fisher), was
as French as Philip IV. ''Jeo suy vostre homme de realme de Escoce,'' he
said to Edward I when he capitulated in 1293. When Philip IV and Edward
I made a treaty in 1303 Scotland was not included in it. ''The Scots
were deserted, and Edward I was free to act.'' (Edward I, by Michael
Prestwich.)
In 1512 it was French insistence that under the renewed Auld Alliance
England and Scotland were at war which led directly to the calamitous
tragedy of Flodden.

TOM SHIELDS notes in his Diary that Bonnie Prince Charlie was of
Scottish-Polish origin, and that Butcher Cumberland was his cousin (June
2).
Bonnie Prince Charlie and George II had two common
great-great-grandparents, namely James VI and I, and his wife Anne of
Denmark, and were therefore third cousins. Cumberland, as the younger
son of George II, was a third cousin once removed. This is not much of a
close relationship.
The mother of Prince Charles, Maria Clementina Sobieski, was Polish,
through whom he had eight Polish great-great-grandparents, presumably.
James II, the grandfather, married Mary of Modena, through whom the
Prince had, again presumably, four Italian great-great-grandparents. The
great-grandfather was Charles I, whose wife Henrietta Maria was French,
and through whom the Prince had two French great-great-grandparents.
Finally, the great-great-grandparents in the direct line were as above
James VI, the only Scotsman, and Anne of Denmark.
The ancestry of the Young Pretender was therefore eight parts Polish,
four parts Italian, two parts French, one part Danish, and amazingly,
only one part Scottish.

I WONDER if there was intended irony on the Perspective page in The
Herald on June 5.
Occupying most of the page were articles on the HCI fiasco and Alan
MacDermid's article on ''creeping privatisation gnawing at the
principles of the NHS''. In contrast, at the bottom of the page was an
''exclusive health screening offer'' by The Herald in conjunction with
Bupa.
Was it irony or an attempt at a balance on The Herald's part? Either
way it undermined the well-written and factual articles and the impact,
I perceive, they could have had.
What this ''exclusive offer'' failed to mention was what their
screening programmes involve. Are they proposing to perform a series of
X-rays, routine blood tests and tests for tumour markers as well as a
physical examination?
There is no mention that such screening can involve unnecessary
irradiation; can yield false positive or false negative results (where a
problem can be wrongly ''detected'' or wrongly missed). Nor is there
mention that despite numerous clinical trials some screening techniques
are of doubtful value.
But by far the most important omission is that all screening is
available on the NHS and as doctors we encourage patients to partake of
these services.
I am also concerned that Bupa should claim to have pioneered screening
and to claim it has the largest screening network in Europe, implying
that it outnumbers breast and cervical screening programmes. This is
incorrect.
On re-reading the advertisement, perhaps Bupa means by describing it
as an ''exclusive health screening offer'' that it is exclusive to those
who can afford it.

Zimbabwe A 13, Scotland XV 41.
SCOTLAND will go into their second test against Zimbabwe with a record
of three wins from three games, their latest victory having been
achieved yesterday in the Eastern Highlands city of Mutare against a
Zimbabwe A side containing six full caps.
Although the tourists' 5-1 try advantage was satisfying, David
Johnston, the Scotland coach, was not pleased with the performance.
''Too often we took the wrong option. We kicked when we should have
passed the ball, and vice versa.''
The Scotland coach observed the Scottish performance was a
''fragmented one,'' but at least when the tries came, they showed that
Johnston's charges have learned from training .
Drives off the back of the scrum by Brian Renwick, the Hawick No.8,
who was one of the successes in the pack, ignited two of the Scottish
tries, while clever loop moves were used to breach the opposition
defence.
Talking about the plus points of the Scotland performance, Johnston
singled out the set-piece work of his forwards. ''We were secure on our
own ball and won a lot of their's. We didn't give away a large number of
silly penalties,'' he added
Zimbabwe referee Barry O'Dwyer, at least in the second half, policed
the tendency for the local side to pile over the top at breakdown
points, reducing the fluency of the game.
Scotland's forwards, however, were not put off, and overall were
impressive when they tightened up the game.
Apart from Renwick, Derek Turnbull -- drafted into action immediately
after having arrived in Zimbabwe as the replacement for Fergus Wallace
-- added a solid look to the back row.
Of the other forwards, Ian Elliot -- the main provider of lineout ball
-- showed good upper body strength in being able to rip the ball clear
from mauls on several occasions, while his second row partner Murray
Rudkin continues to give the impression that he is a player with whom
the Scotland coaches should persevere.
Behind the scrum, Duncan Hodge was four times off target with his
goal-kicking, but at least he ignited some pace into the Scottish back
division as the Scots found their scoring touch in the second half.
Hodge scored the Scots' final try from a simple loop move with Ron
Eriksson, another of the tourists' try scorers yesterday.
Derek Stark, playing on the right wing, ran in two splendid
second-half tries to hoist his tour tally to four, and Scotland's other
touchdown came from Mike Dods who was later replaced after having
suffered a back injury by Rowan Shepherd. Scotland's other points came
from conversions by Dods and Shepherd, penalties from Dods (2) and
Hodge, and a drop goal by scrum half Kevin Troup.
For Zimababwe A, winger Brett Buckley cashed in on a spilled Scottish
pass with a kick-and-chase try while the rest of the home team's points
came from their experienced stand-off Martinus Grobler with a
conversion, a penalty, and a drop goal.
Zimbabwe A -- M Steenkamp; B Buckley, W Lunga, P Watson, M Nyahoda; M
Grobler, E McMillan; R Pierce, W Barrett (capt), S Arnold, B Chivandire,
M Hopper, B Lynch, J Putterill, K Locke.
Scotland -- M Dods (Gala) replaced by R Shepherd (Edinburgh Acads) 70
mins; D Stark (Boroughmuir), M Craig (Waterloo), R Eriksson (London
Scottish), J Kerr (Watsonians); D Hodge (Watsonians), K Troup (Edinburgh
Acads); M Browne (Melrose), J Hay (Hawick, capt), A Kittle
(Stewart's-Melville FP), I Elliot (Hawick), M Rudkin (Watsonians), D
Turnbull (Hawick), B Renwick (Hawick), G Dall (Heriot's FP).

<TEXT>
I SYMPATHISE with Julie Davidson's frustration at the problems of cars
and traffic in Edinburgh (Edinburgh on the road to ruin, May 26). These
are indeed serious, and she is not the only person to have been tempted
into a dictatorial ''if I ruled the world'' belief that no-one else has
the gumption to sort out the problem properly.
Unfortunately, it is all too often the case that such a belief is
founded on misunderstanding of the issues and misconceptions about the
consequences of proposed solutions.
An important aspect of the democratic process is to ensure that
decision-makers have fully examined the effects that their decisions
will have on potentially conflicting interests -- safety, the
environment, business interests, for example.
Such difficulties are illustrated by Julie Davidson's ''at a stroke''
solution of excluding all non-essential traffic from the city centre.
The flaw is revealed in the one word ''non-essential''. Who will decide
which traffic is essential? Julie Davidson? The council? The business
community? The environmental lobby? What about the chaos that will ensue
at the edge of the banned area?
No, the only way forward is to put in place a whole package of
measures that deal with the problems by changing the balance between the
car and all other forms of travel, including walking. This is what
Lothian Regional Council is doing in its ''moving forward'' transport
strategy.
With its clear targets for reduction of car use, the aim of this
strategy is the very opposite to ''appeasing'' the motor car, and it
relies on a whole range of measures to do this, from improving public
transport to making people more aware of the damage they cause by
travelling by car.
An important element of the strategy is fundamentally misunderstood by
Julie Davidson. Greenways are about better bus services, not about
making life easier for the motor car. In many cases additional car
parking and delivery space is being permitted compared to the present
for servicing shops.
There will be extensive bus lanes, and Greenways will be linked to
park-and-ride sites at the edge of the city. Traffic calming is being
introduced in adjacent residential areas to improve safety and reduce
rat-running traffic.
As for the Raeburn Place Greenways myth that has grown up recently:
there are no plans by the regional council to introduce Greenways in
Stockbridge, nor would any be put forward before extensive consultation
with local residents and businesses in the areas concerned.
I do agree that there is no point in planning ambitious schemes if you
do not have the resources to carry them out. Lothian has developed the
''Moving Forward'' transport strategy based on what we know can
realistically be achieved in the next five years.
The core of the strategy is that improving the environment through
managed reductions in traffic levels will reinforce both the economy and
the quality of life and improve Edinburgh's already high ranking in
these areas.

AS an expectant mother booked into Rutherglen Maternity Hospital, I
was deeply concerned that the main reason Greater Glasgow Health Board
gives for proposing its closure is that ''stand alone'' sites are not
safe and hence I may be putting myself and baby at some risk by not
booking into a maternity hospital attached to a general hospital.
However, I was even more concerned after a reading of relevant
research to discover that there is none to substantiate this view and
indeed the research would appear to be suggesting that the opposite is
true, ie, smaller units are safer for mothers than those attached to
general hospitals.
It appears that the GGHB's policy is purely based on the
unsubstantiated assertions of the Royal Society of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists, which obviously has its members' interests at heart as
well, presumably, as those of its ''patients''.

IN SPITE of all parts of the world, at various times, being engulfed
by terrorists and despots, in addition to various wars, including two
world wars, this century, it's obvious that no lessons have been learned
by politicians.
You have to differentiate if a group can be genuinely classed as
''freedom fighters'' (as in the case of the Hungarian Revolution) with a
just cause, or terrorists with a grudge against society in general, who
do not respond to any normal code of conduct or any other point of view.
Treaties mean little or nothing to terrorists or despots; they only
sit up and take notice of them if you are stronger or more resolute than
them, .
Hitler, with a nonpareil ability to hypnotise mass audiences with
powerful oratory, once said at the time of the Munich crisis in 1938,
that a treaty was only ''a scrap of paper'' and when Pope Pius
complained about Stalin's treatment in Russia of religious groups,
Stalin's response was ''How many divisions does the Pope have?'' or
words to that effect.
These comments by two notorious despots of this century say it all, so
that the current Serbian agression against Bosnia is yet another sorry
episode in the annals of this century, of despots putting themselves up
on a pedestal, with no regard to the rights, lives or views of others.
The misguided idea that denying arms to the Bosnian Government, to
defend their territory against well-armed Serbians, would somehow stop
the war escalating is beyond belief. The current situation in the
Balkans is almost a re-run of Hitler's policy of intimidation and
annexation of other people's territory on the pretext that he was
protecting them.

AS a serviceman whose repatriation from South East Asia Command was
advanced a notionally considerable time in 1945 because of Japanese
surrender unconditionally after the atom-bombing of Nagasaki and
Hiroshima, I remember the desperate plight of civilian and military
prisoners of war, and the certainty of considerable casualties, both
Allied and Japanese.
My infantry unit had just completed combined operations training for
beach landings, possibly at Rangoon, and certainly on the Japanese
mainland.
Japanese forces would have fought fanatically on their imperialistic
fatherland,
Only the astronomically destructive dimension of two atom bombs,
obliterating two Japanese industrial cities, penetrated the fanaticism
of Japanese imperialism. Many Allied and Japanese casualties would have
resulted from the failure to use such bombs.
The moral issue, I think, is not entirely opposition to such use. Many
prisoners of (Japanese) war would have suffered a slow, cruel death. The
citizens of Nagasaki and Hiroshima had a mercifully, perhaps, quicker
death.
The idea that there was Japanese ''willingness'' to surrender ignores
delaying tactics for conditional surrender.
Use of the bombs, if regrettably destructive of Japanese lives, was
still justified on military grounds, no matter what more morally
satisfying later reluctance would ensue.
These two historic and frightful bombings may have constituted a
deterrent for the future of any further use.
In fact, I believe, nuclear bombs are not only obsolescent, but
obsolete, and Trident is an unexampled waste of money which, however,
the United Nations might spend in some measure towards unilateral
possession.

LORD Erskine of Rerrick, who joked about leaving his testicles to the
bank which declared him bankrupt after claiming it ''had no balls'',
died yesterday aged 69.
The colourful but penniless peer had been suffering from cancer of the
prostate and died in Trinity Hospice, south London.
''We knew he was very ill and his death was imminent,'' said Lady
Erskine. ''But he was very courageous. He was just an amazing man.''
She said: ''He joked about leaving his testicles to the Royal Bank of
Scotland -- with whom he has an ongoing battle -- because he said they
didn't have any balls. He had a wonderful sense of humour -- he's
probably up there now laughing at this conversation.''
Iain Maxwell Erskine, rumoured to be involved with MI6, was declared
bankrupt in 1991 after a long battle to secure money left to him in
secret accounts by his father, who was general manager of one of the
banks which merged into the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The former 2nd lieutenant of the Grenadier Guards, company director
and professional photographer, lived in Cyprus until just over a year
ago.
Lady Erskine said the funeral would only be attended by herself and
his three daughters from previous marriages.

THE YEAR 1979 held major disappointment for the national movement --
in the results of the referendum and the General Election. At the time,
Euan Bain, in a cartoon, and William McIlvanney, in words, both asked
the same question about the Scottish lion -- why did it not come out of
its cage when the door was opened? It took me more than 10 years to
recover from the effect of those political results on my emotions,
compounded by other personal traumas in my life up to 1986. Not until
1991 did I feel able to address the question of many of the people.
It had been clear for generations that a substantial majority of Scots
wanted their country to be self-governing. They know in the head that it
will be good for Scotland; and they feel in their hearts a love for
Scotland. But in the guts, the seat of power in the body, they
subconsciously harbour fears about going it alone out of the Union. That
summarises the situation which I now believe I understand. My
understanding derives from personal experience of becoming conscious of
the damaging power in myself of emotions repressed and hidden in my
subconscious.
I refer particularly to the emotions of shame and guilt. The raising
of my self-awareness and experience of appropriate therapy, accompanied
by spiritual awakening, enabled me to acknowledge the crippling emotions
and become healed. Just to recognise how and why particular emotions
become repressed and covered up is a major step towards becoming free of
them. In relation to fear of ending the Union, such recognition is a
necessary step for many people, I believe, towards the self-confidence
of independence.
In his article of May 31, Michael Fry claimed that perception of the
Union as ''an entirely Good Thing'' was ''seldom questioned till recent
times''. This is true only in relation to its Conservative and Unionist
supporters, of the middle and upper classes. Robert Burns and Sir Walter
Scott both reflected widespread antagonism to the Union which has
continued since 1707. It eventually led to political opposition in the
founding of the National Party of Scotland in 1928, the real beginnings
of the present SNP.
Mr Fry asks why no general uprising took place against the Union in
1707. I posed the same question in a booklet in 1992* and I provided the
answer: ''Fear is the answer to that. Fear of defeat by English military
and economic power. So it was fear that gave rise to the shame of defeat
without battle. There was no successor to William Wallace. Had there
been there would have been warfare, even although the chances of success
and eventual peace would have seemed small. Folk would have rallied --
but under whose banner?''
The Crown, no matter how distant, stupid, unsympathetic or tyrannical,
was still honoured, and republicanism was no more than an ideal in the
minds of a small minority. The nation was divided, for and against the
Stewarts. There were also religious, linguistic, and class divisions. So
a truly nationwide consciousness was not on the cards. We have to accept
responsibility for what happened. It is the present and the future that
call us into action today. What we have to do with our past is accept
it, especially the shame, related anger, and self-pity.
The date 1707 incorporates all these emotions. No matter what it was
in that year or in the decades before it which had generated them, the
lack of armed forces, the crucial effects of the Darien disaster, the
Massacre of Glencoe, the decades of particularly bad weather in the late
seventeenth century and consequent poverty, the religious feuding and
vicious persecution by the Crown, or the defeats and occupation by
Cromwell's army -- all these were in painful living memory in 1707.''
That is why there was no uprising.
Mr Fry's other claim that repressed emotions of guilt and shame in the
Scots psyche ''spring from Calvinist religion'' reveals a lack of
understanding of the nature and power of repressed emotions. I would
agree that Calvinism disposes people to feel guilty about themselves,
but so does Catholicism. It is a fact of Christianity that churches
exercise some control and power over their members through their
feelings of guilt. But emotions held and repressed by individuals or
families or collectives, whether they are church members or not, in
relation to events or circumstances outwith religious experience, have
their own validity and power in the subconscious, unaffected by
religious beliefs or lack of them.
As I hope I have demonstrated, the shame of 1707's defeat without
battle was repressed because it could not be expressed. We have been
stuck with it ever since, in the subconscious. It has been complemented
by such events as the failure of the '45, the 1820 Rising, the
Clearances, mass unemployment and its resultant ebb-tide of emigration
between the wars and after the second one, and the collapse of Scottish
industry.
All of these have involved shame felt and repressed by huge sections
of the population over many generations, becoming an endemic part of the
nation's subconscious culture. Only people who have perceived that these
things have been neither the will of God, nor caused entirely by
''market forces'', but were results of weaknesses in Scottish human
beings and in how their society has been organised, are likely to be
free of it.
I challenge Mr Fry to find one instance of me or the SNP ''rattling
the begging bowl'' as he puts it. It is quite untrue of him to assert
that I have ever claimed that ''the English owe us a living''. My whole
political effort since 1962, when it began, has been against that
whingeing mentality. Scotland has subsidised the Union since taxation
rose to unprecedented levels and significant government influence on the
economy started 80 years ago. Every comprehensive examination that I am
aware of has shown that Scotland is not subsidised and would be better
off with independence and policies to suit Scottish wants and needs. It
surprises no-one that British Government figures are selected to show
the contrary, as Unionists like Mr Fry wish to believe.
Mr Fry's final jibe -- that my state of mind and that of the Scottish
National Party is one of dependence -- I happily leave to others, and
history, to judge. A new Scotland will replace the Union and the
futility of nostalgia which it helps to perpetuate with a passionate
caring, living in the present, and dealing with it.

THE HERALD NATIONAL HUNT AWARDS
LEN Lungo, with 28 winners, his highest total since taking out a
licence five years ago, has won the inaugural The Herald Scottish
Leading National Hunt Trainer award by a substantial margin.
Lungo, who had 49 jumpers in training at his Hetlandhill yard at
Carrutherstown, bettered last season's total by one, and his horses won
more than #95,000 in prize money.
The former jump jockey, who began his career with Martin Pipe in
Devon, will receive a cheque for #1000 and a trophy at The Herald Racing
Awards Dinner in the Hospitality Inn, Glasgow, on June 23.
Lungo, who finished 10 ahead of his nearest rival, Peter Monteith,
expressed his delight at being the first winner of the award with his
best-ever total.
Although stable star Attadale had a disappointing season, some of his
younger horses, including Noyan and Oat Couture, who won three times,
and Forbidden Time (twice) performed well.
Santa Concerto -- ''possibly the best horse I've ever had'' -- won two
bumpers and will go novice hurdling when the ground is soft enough next
season.
Lungo, who aims his horses for the middle of the season, made a slow
start in the championship. From mid-August until late December he lagged
behind Monteith, but by the end of January his eleventh winner went in
and he was only one behind.
A purple patch in the first three weeks of February, when he had seven
winners, saw him with a lead of 18-12, and from then on Lungo was never
overtaken.
He believes that but for the number of abandoned meetings his winning
total could have been higher. ''We thought we had chances with 24
runners who were forecast favourites at abandoned meetings,'' he said.
Although there has been an end of season clear-out at Hetlandhill to
make room for new unraced horses, Lungo is delighted that Attadale, sent
to the sales by Hal McGhie, has returned under new ownership to go
novice chasing in the new season.
Monteith had a slightly disappointing season with two fewer winners
than in 1994. It might have been higher but for losing the services of
Flash of Realm for six months due to a wrongly lodged claim at Edinburgh
in December.
Although Tom Dyer, of Invergowrie, had only six winners, his prize
money totalled over #60,000, mainly due to Chief Minister, who won
#44,600, including #23,555 in the Swinton Handicap Hurdle at Haydock.
Mrs Dawn Goodfellow, of Lauder, has taken the Leading Permit Holder
award with eight winners and will receive #150 and a trophy. Ceilidh Boy
was her best horse with four wins from 12 runs and total prize money of
#24,245.
The runner-up was Alistair Whillans, of Hawick, with six winners.

VILLAGERS fear that toxic waste from a proposed pet crematorium will
pollute the atmosphere in one of Scotland's beauty spots.
At a packed protest meeting yesterday, residents of Wiston told
Clydesdale District depute planning chief, Mr Seamus Lawlor, of their
concerns that used veterinary syringes and empty drug containers would
be incinerated at the building in the upper Clyde Valley.
One local vet said the company involved in the project, Elysian
Fields, of Kirkmuirhill, Lanarkshire -- which is planning a chapel of
rest service for pet owners -- has a contract with Glasgow University
veterinary department to remove and destroy waste syringes and drug
containers.
Others claimed that, should the plan go ahead, hundreds of pet
carcasses from throughout Scotland would be incinerated or buried at the
centre -- the first of its kind in Scotland.
Many protesters said they fear that farm animal carcasses would also
be destroyed on the site close to the A73, which is heralded as the
Clyde Valley Tourist Route.
There are also health fears for children playing in the field close to
a burn beside the proposed cemetery.
Mr Ross Forrest, a father of two girls, said: ''Our kids don't have a
village swing park and rely on fields and the Garth burn to play in. We
fear water pollution from buried carcasses, as well as chemical
emissions from the incinerator chimney.''
Mr James Willocks, of the Smiddy in Wiston, said yesterday: ''If this
goes ahead it will be the kiss of death for future tourism around here.
It will be the thin end of the wedge, with more light industrial
development spoiling the countryside.''
However, Mr Lawlor assured anxious residents that the council would
consult with Strathclyde region roads engineers, Clyde River
Purification Board, environmental health, and other agencies before
making a decision.
Elysian Fields's proprietor, Mr Tom Hamilton, said he knew there would
be objections to his scheme, but said local people had nothing to fear.
He said the idea was to give bereaved pet owners peace of mind.

Jack and Sarah (15) directed by Tim Sullivan
The Brady Bunch (12) directed by Betty Thomas
Kiss of Death (18) directed by Barbet Schroeder
On general release from tomorrow
The problems of the single parent are again explored in a pleasant,
feel-good film described by William Russell
HEARTWARMING, frequently very funny, but overly sentimental and
shamelessly manipulative, Jack and Sarah is an English variation on
Three Men and a Baby which aspires to look wittily, but wisely, at the
problems of the single parent. Unfortunately the writer and director,
Tim Sullivan, in his first feature film, has opted instead for
situation-driven comedy. People do things in order to have a row, get in
a muddle or raise a laugh, instead of the quarrel, the confusion, or the
laughter arising naturally from the way they faced up to a predicament.
Richard E Grant, not one of nature's Cary Grants, plays debonair Jack,
a City lawyer whose wife, Sarah (Imogen Stubbs), dies in childbirth.
Left with a baby daughter to bring up, naturally called Sarah, he has to
fend off the attentions of his Bohemian mother-in-law (Eileen Atkins),
his upper-class parents (Judi Dench and David Swift), and his randy
boss, Cherie Lunghi.
As Sarah knows, Jack is a selfish prat and there is a lovely moment
after they move into their new, unfinished Georgian terrace house -- the
builders have been cheating him -- when she discovers all their friends
are coming to dinner. She is heavily pregnant, but Jack insists, not to
worry, he will do the cooking. She replies that he will get drunk as
usual and they won't see their friends for another six months yet again
-- cut to Jack lying in a drunken stupor and Sarah going into labour.
Much later we find out they had a Chinese takeaway. It sums Jack up
beautifully, and is among the film's more perceptive moments, proof that
Mr Sullivan can do it when he tries.
Miss Stubbs' departure is a major loss because she makes Sarah highly
attractive and sympathetic, something Mr Grant, deploying all his more
irritating mannerisms, fails to achieve for Jack. His response to her
death is to go on a monumental bender with a comic wino who lives in
their builders' skip (Ian McKellen doing nicely for once) until
''saved'' by the three parents' decision to introduce him to his baby
daughter.
After that the film goes through all known bringing-up-baby gags as
Jack is transformed from drunken, unshaven lush into a doting single
parent who shops at Mothercare, takes baby to work in a sling, changes
nappies, worries about feeds, and drools.
After things get a bit too much for him he is forced to hire a nanny,
whereupon we meet Amy (Samantha Mathis), a pretty American waitress he
encounters in an Islington cafe bar. Miss Mathis is nice enough looking,
but lacks charisma and has little comic timing -- the role screams out
for someone like the young Audrey Hepburn, or even Miss Stubbs.
On the plus side, the babies who play Sarah are refreshingly plain,
while Miss Atkins and Dame Judi provide much needed astringency with
performances of the highest calibre. Miss Atkins, giving a faultless
demonstration of how to lend genuine substance to a very sketchily
written role, makes Phil, the mother-in-law, a splendid, dotty figure,
one of those no-nonsense, middle-class English ladies, the backbone of
the Red Cross or the Townswomen's Guild, who have hearts of gold and
wear tweeds.
Dame Judi's Margaret is the sort of Tory matron who never lets go and
is only happy when having her own way. Her performance has less
emotional depth, but is a dazzling comic turn which reveals Margaret is
both to be feared and pitied. Phil, by the way, proves to have the
backbone of steel, Margaret the one who, when confronted, crumbles.
Given that the two main roles are less than ideally cast, the result
is a pleasant, feel-good film which may appeal even more to American
audiences, at which it is aimed, than British ones. The score, however,
is dire. Pass the Prozak to whoever wrote the muzak.
The Brady Bunch is a one-joke movie based on a long-forgotten American
TV sitcom about a couple with families from previous marriages who wed
and create a new family. While the film is intermittently quite funny,
there seems no reason why anybody should have bothered to resuscitate
this load of old TV material. The joke, which is flogged to death, is
that the Bradys are a perfect, all-American family from the 1970s who
live in 1995 just as they would have done in 1975.
The fun is drawn from contrasting these flower power, doing good,
non-drug-taking, non-sex-having, flared trouser-wearing Osmund clones
with today's teenagers. It is a bit like what you would get if you cast
Cliff Richard and the Young Ones in Men Behaving Badly.
Lots of the American references were way above my head, as was the
decision to bring the actors who played the original Brady Bunch on in
cameo roles, while Shelley Long, a gifted comedienne, although she makes
the most of such chances as she is given, is wasted as the cutie pie
Mom. Michael McKean, however, has a more rewarding time as the nasty
developer next door who is trying to acquire the Brady's house, and the
sight reaction of today's teenagers stoneyfaced confronted with a truly
appalling Eurovision Song Contest song-and-dance routine, after the
Brady Bunch enter the school talent contest, is hilarious.
It was also inspired, when the Bunch invite Davy Jones to the school
prom, to show that none of the kids knows who he is, but the teachers
swoon.
David Caruso is the carrot-haired actor who quit NYPD because he
wanted to become a film star. His first attempt at achieving screen
stardom, Kiss of Death, directed by Barbet Schroeder, is an efficient
film noir which will neither hinder nor further his ambitions. He plays
a young father living in Queens just out of prison who wants to go
straight.
A crooked cousin inveigles him into doing one last job driving a lorry
of stolen goods, having insisted that otherwise the local gang boss will
have him murdered. Family loyalty matters, and Caruso obliges. When the
heist goes wrong he does not betray the gang boss's son, Junior Brown
(Nicolas Cage), who was behind it, and goes back to prison.
However, when he has done his time, the police, led by Stanley Tucci,
blackmail him into working for them. Cage, who has been specialising in
light romantic comedy of late, clearly relishes the chance to play the
psychopathic Junior, and has acquired a body to die for as a result of
some intensive workouts in the gym. The result is a slick, violent, and
efficient film, without being an outstanding one. Schroeder has caught
the slightly sleazy ambience of Queens, home to the underworld,
perfectly, and Caruso, although not yet up to carrying a movie all on
his own, makes a passable hero.
It bears no relation to the 1947 film of the same name in which Victor
Mature was the fall guy and Richard Widmark the giggling killer, and is
in no sense a remake. Caruso may make the rare, difficult transition
from small to big screen, but Cage steals the film from him with a
glorious, menacing, over-the-top performance.

AGRICULTURE is no longer at the centre of the rural economy and the
Government's forthcoming White Paper on rural policy should be seized as
an opportunity to recognise that fact, it was claimed yesterday.
Professor Mark Shucksmith of the Department of Land Economy at
Aberdeen University said that current policies encouraging
diversification in the farming sector indicated some official acceptance
of the declining role of agriculture as a factor in the rural economy.
''This Government White Paper gives us the chance to set new
objectives and to make it clear that agriculture is far from the centre
of the rural economy -- and there are jobs for people in other things,''
he said.
Speaking at a conference organised by the Scottish Agricultural
College to open up a debate on rural policy, Professor Shucksmith said
that a huge amount of money was being put into Scottish agriculture.
''Berwickshire receives most per head. Is that the part of rural
Scotland that should be receiving most Government money?'' he asked.
The reason for a high allocation to Berwickshire was that payments
were tied to production but there were more fundamental questions to be
considered about where the money should go, he suggested
In broad terms, he said, the rural economy since the war had been
considered to be the agricultural economy. Land and resources were
devoted to agriculture and other activities were to be kept out of the
countryside. European and Scottish ministers had begun to try to grasp
the nettle of change but it had not been done fully.
The problem with diversification, he said, was that it could run
contrary to the established picture of what was ''rural''. Already the
service sector in rural areas was increasing. In the Western Isles local
government was the main employer. There was increased commuting from
rural areas to towns and with new technology many people were able to
work from a home base in the countryside.
The drift away from agriculture was confirmed by Mr Alex Murray of
Aberfeldy, a sheep farmer and SNP councillor. ''When I came to my
present farm I had 16 neighbouring sheep farmers. Today, 20 years later,
I have none,'' he said. Mr Murray said that the units which had gone out
of sheep farming were now devoted to field sports or forestry. Overseas
buyers were taking over estates to turn them into playgrounds.
Dr Jean Balfour, former chairman of the Countryside Commission,
presented a paper on environmental issues in which she criticised the
plethora of European and UK regulations which, she said, amounted to ''a
litter of useful tools -- but hardly a policy''.
Dr Balfour called for clear national guidelines based on a
land-use-potential statement; the development by planning authorities of
countryside indicative strategies to include agriculture, recreation,
water catchment, conservation and forestry; improved access arrangements
with the development and maintenance of footpath networks around towns
and, where appropriate, in the hills and upland areas.
She also identified a need for better use of set-aside land and a
review of fiscal measures and grant incentives to harmonise with
national guidelines and objectives.
Dr Graham Dalton of the SAC agricultural and rural economics
department at Aberdeen suggested consideration of a system of payments
to farmers for care of the environment. He envisaged an audit of all
farms at regular intervals -- perhaps every 10 years -- with money being
paid for long term environmental investment. This would give the farmer
incentive to improve the environment and would challenge

WILLIAM RUSSELL talks to Nicolas Cage and David Caruso about their new
film noir, Kiss of Death
THE star role goes to David Caruso, departed heart throb of NYPD. It
is his first major screen role, although he did spend 10 years before
his television breakthrough playing small parts in films. In spite of
that TV stardom, his name is not yet enough on its own, however, to
carry a film at the box office, which is why the pyschopath villain is
played by an established cinema leading man, Nicolas Cage.
In the advertising he is above the title, on the screen credits he
occupies that magic place in the cast list -- last following that vital
word ''and''.
Kiss of Death, directed by Barbet Schroeder, who made Reversal of
Fortune, is about a young man from Queens with a criminal past trying to
go straight. As a favour to a crooked cousin he reluctantly agrees to
drive a lorry of stolen goods. Things go wrong, he takes the rap for the
local gang boss, and when he comes out of prison is blackmailed by the
police into helping set up the man and his brutal son, Junior Brown,
played by Cage.
A traditional film noir plot, it is a reworking of an old story by the
screenwriter Richard Price, rather than a straight remake of the 1947
film of the same name which starred Victor Mature as the guy trying to
go straight and Richard Widmark as the psychopath.
Cage took the part because, he said, he wants to keep challenging
himself as an actor. ''The really good film-makers are making very few
films, and it was a  chance to work with Barbet,'' he added. ''Acting
keeps me sane. It is an important outlet. It is very sacred to me. It
has been my ticket to freedom. I keep it in a cherished place. I act out
of necessity. If I did not have that outlet I would implode -- or
something.''
He decided he wished to be an actor when, aged six, he was watching TV
and wanted to be someone inside the set and ''get the hell out of'' his
living room. His uncle is Francis Ford Coppola, but at that age he did
not know his uncle was a director, just that he was his uncle. He worked
for Coppola early on in his career on Rumblefish, an experience he found
unnerving.
''I had not established myself as an actor, and I could understand the
other actors thinking it was easy for the nephew,'' he said. ''I knew I
would get that judgment, so I felt I had to work twice as hard as the
next guy in order to be taken seriously.  It was not until I worked with
him on The Valley Girl Who Got Married -- Peggy Sue -- that I had a
rapport with him as an actor with his director, not as a nephew with his
uncle.''
Junior Brown is a musclebound hulk, a new image for Cage, even if he
is not exactly a willowy aesthete. ''It was a character choice to look
like that,'' he said. ''I was trying to give Junior a menacing
appearance, a pulped-up quality. I spent three months, three hours a
day, in the gym doing a lot of no-fat-burning exercises, building myself
up. I wanted him to be a thug.
''When you are playing a character ultimately there is a connection
with that character, but I try to leave them on the set. I noticed
playing Junior Brown that I had a shorter fuse than usual and was more
irritable. I think violent characters tend to bring out violent feelings
in one.''
At the time he agreed to play the part it was a role he really needed,
having done a ''slew'' of light romantic comedies and a bad farce,
Trapped in Paradise, he said. ''I wanted to do a carbon clean out, which
is what you do when you drive a car at 100mph and clean the engine. I
wanted to play a bad guy in a way I could express the anger that had
been boiling up inside me.''
The trouble appears to have been caused by Trapped in Paradise, a film
he had not wanted to make and about which his opinion is unrepeatable.
Why had done it, apart from the fact that they paid him to do so? The
cast had been attactive and it might have worked, he said, and the money
had also given him the freedom to do other movies he wanted to make like
this one and Leaving Las Vegas.
''I have made some bad movies, but I don't regret anything,'' he
added. ''I had to learn my trade. I thought Trapped in Paradise would
have been funny -- Dana Carvey was in it after all -- but you cannot
control every aspect of a movie when you are an actor. The best thing I
can do is be careful about the choice of director I work with. That is
the only power I have. But I have learned to go to the dailies, watch
what is happening on the set, and watch the director.''
Caruso said he was ''half Irish, half Sicilian, very sexy,'' and came
from Queens. ''I am a Catholic, what we call a recovering Catholic, that
means I survived the intial damage and confusion,'' he added. ''I know
these people in the story because I grew up with them. This is the way
they make their living. But they have personal lives. They don't go
round being bad all the time. I had a number of friends who did this
sort of thing for a living -- a couple were murdered. They crossed each
other, they betrayed.''
He insisted his experience working  on NYPD had been a good one --
there has been some backbiting since he left involving him and other
members of the cast. ''It was material of feature film quality -- I
started in films and I am familiar with filming --  but TV is harder
work. You spend 40 weeks doing nine pages a day, working 16 or 18 hours,
in television, whereas in films you do two pages of the script in a day,
tops.  In TV you are constantly tested. Another nine pages to be
learned. It never ends. The quality of my life is better now I have left
NYPD.''
He left Queens aged 24 in search of broader horizons and ended up
going to California 15 years ago. ''I did a lot of odd jobs -- I was an
usher in a movie theatre,'' he said. ''I have been fascinated all my
life with movies and, in hindsight, it makes perfect sense that I would
do this for a living. I knew I wasn't going to do a straight job. I met
a woman, she was a show business manager, and certain things clicked. In
a nice way it was my destiny. It has not been easy, however. There have
been ups and downs and disappointments and times of unemployment.
''I worked in films for 10 years, a lot of which could have been
successful and were not, before getting the TV show.'' He is now
concentrating on his cinema career and has made his second film, Jade, a
thriller directed by William Friedkin in which his co-star is Linda
Fiorentino. Told that some people were calling him the new the new James
Cagney, Caruso blushed to the roots of his carrot-coloured hair. ''That
is not bad,'' he said modestly. ''I could have been the new Pee Wee
Herman.''

PERTH racecourse, situated in the heart of Scone Palace estate and
arguably the most scenic track in Britain, makes history this evening
when it hosts the first-ever summer jumps meeting.
In previous years NH racing has shut down at the end of May, resuming
again in August, but on the initiative of the British Horseracing Board
it now takes place all year round.
With the ground good to soft as a result of watering and recent wet
weather, this evening's meeting has attracted 47 runners from an
original entry of 77. Friday's afternoon meeting has attracted 74
entries and it is anticipated about 40 will stand their ground.
Since the beginning of April the Perth ground staff, using recently
purchased equipment, have poured approximately three million gallons of
water from the River Tay onto the track, about the equivalent of an inch
of rain a week.
Sam Morshead, clerk of the course, said he was confident summer jumps
racing would work. ''We are looking to establish these two new fixtures
and possibly add an extra meeting next summer.''
A carnival atmosphere is ensured with a piper playing the jockeys into
the paddock and a barbecue after racing with dancing to a live band.

Gaelic activists in lochaber are
campaigning to have Fort William included on the list of venues for
the National Mod.
A consultant's report commissioned by Mod organisers, An Comunn
Gaidhealach, recommended that Inverness, Oban, Glasgow, and Perth should
be the main venues for the Mod after 1998, with Stornoway, Portree, and
Dunoon as reserve venues.
However, there have been protests at the inclusion of Perth at the
expense of Fort William and Stornoway. The report, conducted by Compass
of Inverness, revealed 47% of all Mods had been in the four core venues
and that these had been very successful.
When the report was published at the end of April, An Comunn chief
executive Donald John MacSween pointed out: ''It costs at least #130,000
to stage the Mod, and this places an enormous burden on local
committees. A core of venues makes it a known quantity which will be
more attractive to sponsors.''

Marriage on the rocks? John Macleod explains why Church of England
clerics are wrong to argue in favour of cohabitation.
LIVING in sin'' is not a phrase I like. It is found nowhere in the
Bible. It is also rather too typical of Christendom's obsession with
sex. Those who spend their days in petty tyranny, miserly greed or
destructive gossip live in sin as much as -- if not more than -- couples
sharing bed and board without prior sound of a marriage service.
It seems, however, that to some in the Church of England the phrase
stinks of rather more than semantics. They resent its assertion. They
deplore its judgment. For too long, they argue, we have exalted
Christian marriage. And we have cruelly misjudged those in other sexual
arrangements. It is time, they argue, to accommodate cohabitation.
One sees the temptation. The day is long past when ''living in sin''
was cause for scandal; today it scarcely arouses comment. At every level
of society we know of couples at present in casual domestic bliss.
Illegitimacy has lost its legal stigma. Today, children, natural and
unnatural, enjoy equal inheritance rights. Marriage no longer comes with
a tax break. The divorce statistics are rising; and divorce, especially
for a man, is a perilous business.
For just such cynical reasons do many cohabit. I knew of one
middle-class couple in Edinburgh, who chose, post-divorces, to share
life, house and bed. But they brightly declared a moratorium on
marriage, because it would queer up student grants for a teenage son.
The forms in hospital maternity wards no longer mention ''husbands'';
staff are strictly ordered to ask only about ''partners''. Weddings
still happen, but they tend to be bizarre events. Never have they been
so expensive and over the top. And often the bonny wee flower girl is
the couple's daughter.
Such reality no-one disputes. But the response of these clerics seems
bizarre. Are we really obliged, as Christians, to accept the world as it
is? Then we must equally embrace rising corporate greed, a ruthless arms
industry, burgeoning violent crime and terminal Tory Government. Are
these, too, not modern realities?
No, it's the same old story -- another silly idea from a bunch of
trendy vicars. As usual, they have all the street-cred of a pair of
flared jeans and, as usual, they are giggly, arch, and timid. They are
afraid of seeming out of step. They are afraid of ever sounding the
tedious bit determined, different, or dangerous. And how scared they are
of sex! It is like a bomb primed to explode. All civilisation and order
will end if anyone -- straight, gay, married, single -- is denied orgasm
for a week.
Alas, the Church of God is meant to be determined, different, and
dangerous. The bride of Christ must speak with an authority that is not
of this world. And she does so because she is founded upon supernatural
proof. Her authority is born of the unseen and the miraculous.
Our hapless Anglican friends, of course, like to look reasonable. So
they have dispensed with the wondrous. The Bible got it first: analysed
and criticised to death, its history reduced to legend and its
prophecies put down to wise-after-the-event fraud. Moses was destroyed.
Then they came for the apostle Paul. In my own time the theologians have
reduced even the Saviour himself to ''the myth of god incarnate''.
When the doctrines are gone, the ethics are sure to follow.
Well, these men are wrong. Cohabitation, living in sin -- call it what
you will -- has brought thousands much unhappiness. Without commitment,
there can be no trust; without trust, no security.
Daily these relationships dissolve around us. And the pursuit of
''serial monogamy'' -- that wicked phrase -- spreads sorrow everywhere.
The bright young woman is reduced to an ageing tramp with her third
mate. There are children, half children, and step children. Their world
is one of uncertainty and doubt. Nothing can be taken for granted. Tales
of abuse, physical, emotional, and sexual -- by non-biological parents
are legion.
Marriage, as an institution, is not confined to the Christian church.
That is because it was laid down at the very dawn of creation. A man
would leave his parents. He would cleave to his wife. They would be one
flesh. They would have children. The relationship would be exclusive and
faithful; was to break only at death.
That marriage today is most difficult cannot be denied. There are
times when love is reduced to bare commitment, sustained solely by
teeth-gritting will. But faithful marriage, overall and in the main,
produces safety, serenity and peace. Cohabitation cheapens sex,
threatens family and society, and exposes women and children to much
trouble and pain. It is a great evil. And the Church must resist it.

Sunning yourself without protection can lead to skin cancer or
premature ageing of the skin. But, as Ann Shaw reports, some products
designed to safeguard against the sun's harmful effects are not worth
buying
YOU want a sun tan but you don't want to join the 40,000 who get skin
cancer every year. So, you invest in a high sun-factor protection (SFP)
lotion, say 18 or 20, confident that you are taking a responsible
attitude towards your own health.
Well, here's the bad news. Forget it. You are wasting your money. You
might just as well buy cheaper sun-tan lotion and apply it more often.
Dr Meg Price, a member of the British Medical Association's
dermatology committee, says that SFP above 15 show little extra benefit
in protecting against harmful rays.
Her advice is: ''Don't waste your money!''
The Health Education Board for Scotland this week launched their own
sun awareness campaign. A spokeswoman says: ''We agree there is little
point in using a SFP lotion above 15 but the real problem in Scotland is
that many people don't use any sun protection lotion at all. They think
it's something to put on when they go abroad on holiday.
''Yet one third of those who get skin cancer in Scotland have never
been abroad. Men are the worst offenders. They are very reluctant to
protect their skin except when they are abroad and expect to burn.''
A spokeswoman points out that in Australia it is illegal for companies
to sell products labelled above 15 SFP because it can mislead the
public.
But in this country packaging can be misleading, something that last
week's issue of Which? magazine, published by the Consumers Association,
criticised in their report on sun-protection products.
They carried out a survey of 2001 adults in Great Britain to find out
their views.
They discovered that:
* People are confused by the jargon on sun lotion bottles.
* Users want clear and straightforward advice, but they are not
getting it.
* Yet skin cancer is the second most common cancer in the UK and we
spend over #100m per year on sun-care products.
So, there should be a great incentive to get the information right.
It's not that manufacturers are deliberately misleading, its just that
the extra gains are considered by dermatologists to be only marginal.
But they argue that people are prepared to pay for that extra bit of
safety.
Which? magazine thinks an ideal label should give application advice,
an explanation of what the lotion does, and an admission that lotions
cannot by themselves provide total protection from the harmful effects
of over-exposure to the sun.
All labels should avoid quasi-scientific claims. They point out that
sun tan lotion bottles may claim that their particular brand helps you
develop a ''healthy'' golden colour, but what in fact happens is that
exposure to the sun steps up the production of the pigment melanin,
causing the skin to turn brown, to protect itself from too much sun.
There are two harmful types of sun rays: UVA which causes premature
ageing and UVB which cause burning.
Regular use of sun tan lotions can reduce the harmful effects of these
rays. Roughly it works out like this. A bottle with a SFP of 8 allows
you to stay in the sun eight times longer than if you had no lotion on
at all.
But, be warned: ''There is no such thing as a healthy tan,'' says the
UK Skin Cancer Prevention Working Party which includes representatives
from the British Association of Dermatologists and leading cancer
charities.
The best way to prevent skin cancer is to prevent your skin getting
burnt in the first place. No sun protection lotion can guarantee this.
You need to take extra precautions. (see panel)
Around 400 people in Scotland develop malignant melanoma each year,
the most serious form of skin cancer, and a further 4000 the less
serious type. Worse still, many people prepare for their annual blitz of
sunshine by spending time on sunbeds, a practice condemned by Professor
Rona MacKie, one of the country's leading dermatologists, based in
Glasgow. ''Sunbeds appear to be dangerous even for as little as twice a
week for one month before going on holiday,'' she says.
A savage sunburn this year could cause cancer 20, even 30 later. Those
most at risk are the fair and red-haired, particularly those with
freckles who burn easily.
Remember: today's sun tan is tomorrow's wrinkles and next year's skin
cancer.
Have a good summer!
COVERING YOUR OPTIONS
* CHILDREN'S skin never ''forgets'' being burnt so it is doubly
important that they are covered up.
* Babies under six months should be kept out of direct sunlight
altogether.
* All children should wear T-shirts and waterproof cream when
swimming.
* Always avoid the midday sun. Stay in the shade or cover up between
noon and 2pm in the UK or up to 3pm on the Mediterranean, just like the
locals do.
* Use your shadow as a guide. The shorter the shadow, the closer to
noon, and the more the risk of suffering sun-burn.
* Wear a broad-brimmed hat, T-shirt and sun-glasses.
* Use sun-blocking cream, particularly on sensitive areas like rims of
your ears, your nose and the top of your head if your hair is thinning.
* To sum up: follow the Australia practice -- slip, slop, slap -- slip
on a shirt; slop on some sunscreen, and slap on a hat.
* For further information: free leaflets on Taking Care of Yourself in
the Sun and Are You Dying to get a Sun-Tan? are available from the NHS
Helpline, Freephone: 0800 22 44 88.

IT WOULD have been difficult for the Chancellor to have agreed to
raise interest rates yesterday, since that would have left him open to
the charge that last month's standstill was indeed a panic reaction to
the bad political news of the local election results in England and
Wales. Had the statistical evidence demanded it, however, there would
have been no choice yesterday. The worries of the Governor of the Bank
of England about the continuing build-up of inflationary pressures in
the economy have not gone away. They ought to have been calmed somewhat
by the recent flow of evidence which has vindicated Mr Clarke's earlier
judgment and shown it to be explicable in terms other than party
advantage. Retail sales remain subdued, while house prices are stagnant
and tending to fall, though fears about the extent of that downwards
movement may be exaggerated. These two facts explain much of the
Government's continuing lack of popularity, at least among the mass of
voters, yet their other consequences are socially useful. Restrained
domestic demand ensures industry's attention remains focused on export
markets; lagging house prices at least offer attractions to first-time
buyers. Unaltered interest rates help those with mortgage repayment
problems, by ensuring that their outstanding totals continue to fall, at
least where repayment mortgages are concerned. In contrast, increased
rates yesterday would have worsened the plight of those borrowers
already in distress.
The effect of the earlier rate rises (and the tax increases in the
last three Budgets) has been to slow the economy. It remains to be seen
whether it has been slowed to a level where it continues to produce
sustainable growth without any run into inflation. One imponderable is
the movement of sterling, which has been looking too weak for comfort,
but that weakness contributes to our ability to export. Mr Clarke's
reputation in financial circles has been enhanced by the way in which
last month's decision to standstill on interest rates has been
confirmed; and not just in financial circles, for he will have regained
some ground within his own party, and with him those causes,
particularly that of Europe, with which he is most identified.

BRITISH RAIL has lost its appeal against last month's legal decision
to prevent the ending of the Fort William - London sleeper service. BR
may still seek leave to appeal to the House of Lords; its Board has yet
to make a decision. It would be wise to accept the lastest outcome, to
abandon its silly ''ghost trains'' ploy, and -- if it still wants to end
the Fort William facility -- begin the formal consultative procedures it
is statutorily required to follow. All its latest efforts have achieved
is to throw more doubt on the likely outcome of the Government's attempt
to privatise the railways, which is anyhow running into trouble on many
other fronts and suffering from a climate of rapidly deteriorating
industrial relations. We shall all be very lucky to avoid a long hot
summer of disruption on the railways this year: railwaymen are not happy
at their work.
How either their discontent, or the quality of the service offered,
could be changed positively by privatisation has never been clear.
Public opinion has become increasingly sceptical about the relevance of
the complicated proposals to the service they are offered. Those
businesses considering buying parts of BR are thought to have lost some
of their earlier, qualified, enthusiasm, and Ministers are having to
contemplate the prospect of being left with much of a utility they do
not want to run, or of having to provide the very levels of public
subsidy they hoped to avoid by the transfer of ownership. The Fort
William sleeper, though perhaps not the ideal service to illustrate the
follies of the privatisation programme, is none the less a warning of
what to expect from private railways, where the question of
profitability will rank far ahead of social service in the calculations
of the managers.
The political timetable may make the remainder of this costly exercise
academic. Because of the complications of the privatisation proposals,
and the ever approaching General Election, there may not be sufficient
parliamentary time to bring the whole matter to a conclusion. It is
beginning to look as if the railways, like the Post Office, will remain
in public ownership.

A taskforce has just 30 days to devise a rescue plan for a renowned
Aberdeen research centre, reports Paul Riddell.
THE scientific community in Aberdeen turned the full might of its
brainpower to matters tactical yesterday in an effort to save the
internationally renowned food science laboratory at Torry.
A taskforce led by distinguished scientist Professor Hugh Pennington,
of Aberdeen University's department of medical microbiology, met with
beleaguered staff to begin the arduous 30-day task of devising a rescue
plan.
The future of the 65-year-old research station -- the only one in
Scotland specialising in food safety -- and its 100 jobs, now depend on
whether a scientifically and financially viable alternative to closure
can be found.
It follows the announcement on Tuesday by Agriculture Minister William
Waldegrave that the centre would be closed and four-fifths of the jobs
transferred to a new super-lab in York. The remaining 20 jobs would be
transferred across the road to the Torry Marine Laboratory. Mr
Waldegrave said the Torry site, the Scottish arm of the Central Science
Laboratory, had very high overheads and was likely to operate at a loss.
However, he agreed to grant a temporary stay of execution.
The Central Science Laboratory is an executive agency of the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, with labs at Slough in Berkshire,
Worplesdon in Surrey, Harpenden in Hertfordshire, and Norwich in
Norfolk, as well as the one at Torry. Its raison d'etre is to provide
MAFF and other government departments with the means to promote the safe
and efficient supply of food, and to protect the environment throughout
Britain.
A number of years ago it was decided to close all CSL sites apart from
Norwich and Torry, and relocate them at the complex at York, which is
currently under construction and due to be completed by next summer.
However, financial pressures on the government agency have drawn the
loss-making Torry lab into the vortex of closures.
Crucially, the Torry lab is part of the Aberdeen Research Consortium,
a 10-member body of scientific institutions which draws on the resources
of 3000 scientists and pools expertise in the areas of environmental
health and food. It is that body, chaired by Aberdeen University
Principal Professor Maxwell Irvine, which has been given the task of
spearheading the formation of a rescue plan for the Torry lab.
One day into the 30-day period, three main options were emerging: a
feasibility study into keeping the lab itself open; dispersing the jobs
among the other scientific institutions in Aberdeen; or move the entire
lab to a new building.
Whatever happens, the lab's survival is seen as being vital for an
area with the highest concentration of life and environmental scientists
in Europe. Closure would have a profound effect on this already fragile
sector and its 2000 employees.
At present the lab, which has a turnover of #3.5m, is the only one in
Scotland capable of dealing with an outbreak of salmonella or a similar
type of threat to public safety. It played an important role after the
Braer disaster in Shetland by monitoring the levels of hydrocarbons in
fish caught in the waters around the island.
Professor Maxwell Irvine said: ''It is important that every effort is
made to retain the capability to address the issue of food safety within
this region. The consortium will strive to continue to serve local and
wider interests through the diversity of research skills it brings
together.
''At this early stage I would say it is rather difficult to speculate
as to what the prospects of saving the station will be, but there is
help on hand from Grampian Enterprise.''
''Nothing is being ruled in, and nothing is being ruled out,'' said Mr
Bob Hughes, Labour MP for Aberdeen North and one of the three MPs at the
heart of the campaign to save the Torry lab. ''But it is not yet
possible to give a fair and proper assessment of the chances of the lab
being saved.''
Dr Norval Strachan, union spokesman at the lab, and the man who has
seen morale among the staff fluctuate from one extreme to the other,
said: ''I think the 30-day stay of execution is much more than we
expected and it gives us time, albeit quite a short time, to try to come
up with a package acceptable to the Minister.''
Mr Hughes reflected: ''Mr Waldegrave is not saying he will accept any
alternatives that are drawn up. He is merely saying he will consider
them. That is the bottom line.''

THE Japanese are a proud people with a long history of success. Their
one conspicuous failure in modern times was the Second World War which
they lost comprehensively. That outcome is beyond dispute and few
Japanese have any difficulty in accepting it, but they still find it
hard openly to confront their particular role in causing the war, at
least in the Pacific. The statement which their Government produced this
week to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the war's end was less than
forthright, though it did go some way to meeting the complaints, as much
from Asian neighbours as from Western countries, that the Japanese
remain reluctant to admit fully their aggressive role in the 1930s and
40s. Yet not all Japanese are so affected, only the conservative and
nationalist elements in society. The latest statement is designed as a
contemporary political necessity to hold together the present coalition
which would collapse if the right wing withdrew in outrage at some blunt
and unqualified admission which might otherwise satisfy the canons of
historical objectivity.
The new statement tries to salve Japanese sensitivities by noticing
how their behaviour was not unique. That is beside the point, though it
is worth remembering that European imperialism in east and Southeast
Asia was the model they followed diplomatically, economically, and
militarily. Their role in China, and in Korea earlier, was utterly
aggressive; their drive south to Indonesia and Malaya was textbook
imperialism in search of vital raw materials; and their assault on Pearl
Harbor (which they did not intend to precede a declaration of war) was
the outcome of cynical, but inaccurate, calculations about likely
American responses to these other moves.
Although the Western powers handled the Japanese badly during the
1930s, that no more excuses their actions than the fact that one outcome
was the destruction of the European empires everywhere in Asia. The
Japanese did encourage other people's sense of nationalism, but only to
exploit it for their own purposes. It might have suited their purposes
better to have handed their conquests independence but, like the Nazis
in Russia, they did not see that until too late.
Most of that is the stuff of history and mostly unalterable, though
emphases may change. If ''all history is contemporary'' the real worry
about the latest events is the inability to accept unvarnished
responsibility for events which are ''regretted''. The Japanese people
deserve better than that from their present Government: it was the
people who carried the terrible burden of an earlier Government's folly.

A CALL for trade union support for a Scottish parliament was made
yesterday by Transport and General Workers' Union leadership contender
Mr Jack Dromey.
Speaking to The Herald before addressing a conference organised by
Strathclyde Regional Council, he said that reversing 15 years of union
membership decline and supporting a Scottish parliamant were top of his
agenda.
Mr Dromey -- who predicted a landslide victory on June 23 against the
incumbent, Mr Bill Morris, in the elections for the post of TGWU general
secretary -- said: ''It is a priority that when elected I work to see
the union grows once again, and particularly to lead the TGWU into
Silicon Glen.''
He later warned the regional council conference that Scotland's new
single-tier local authorities ''must not make old mistakes'' by
introducing class and privilege into the chambers of power.
''Our members who are manual workers fear for their future and the
future of services they provide,'' said Mr Dromey. ''All they see is the
appointment of highly-paid directors and old hierarchies being
reinvented.
''The new councils must not imitate the old, with too many chiefs
supervising a dwindling number of indians at the sharp end of service
delivery.''

DR GEOFF LOWE explores varying reactions to the medical warnings to
discourage excessive sunbathing
FROM October through April we've been waiting for it. And now it's
here, we can't get enough of it -- sunshine. We love it. Many of us feel
there's nothing better than sitting or lying down in a nice spot and
soaking it up.
At such times any thoughts of premature ageing and possible skin
cancer are firmly banished from our minds. We still yearn for the
''healthy glow''; and whilst the sun is shining we Brits like to make
the most of it.
Unfortunately -- as with many things we enjoy these days -- there's a
downside. Current evidence points to a causal link between excessive sun
exposure and skin cancer.
Skin cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer. In the UK the
incidence of malignant melanoma (the most dangerous form of skin cancer)
has more than doubled over the last 13 years. The Government advisory
Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) is
now notifying health authorities that skin cancer constitutes a public
health concern.
Perhaps our changing lifestyle over the last 20 years has led to
increased sun exposure. Sunshine holidays abroad -- winter and summer --
mean more damaging rays blasting our pale British skin. Depletion of the
ozone layer doesn't help. So the message is ''excessive sun exposure is
dangerous''.
Behavioural research carried out by health psychologists can be
helpful in skin cancer prevention if the primary objective is to get
people to cut down their sun exposure. Such prevention has involved
increasing public awareness and knowledge of the dangers of
over-exposure, as well as educating people as to the best ways to avoid
this.
Many people are indeed aware of the dangers of excessive sun exposure
and of the need for sun protection. However, this knowledge often does
not transfer into behaviour, with thousands of sun-worshippers --
especially young people -- still desiring and actively seeking a suntan.
As a group teenagers spend most time in the sun, are the most
determined to get a suntan, and are most resistant to adult advice on
what to wear and how to behave in the sun. ''Sunbathers seem less
concerned with their actual health than with the appearance of health,''
the psychologists report. Young people believe that skin cancer is a
disease of the elderly and therefore they will not get it for at least
another 30 or 40 years, if at all.
Such ''unrealistic optimism'' needs to be reduced in order to promote
sensible intentions and subsequently appropriate sun protection
behaviour. According to Arthey and Clarke, it is not enough to educate
young people on the dangers, it is necessary to change the lifestyle and
fashion that favours a sun-tan.
Social and cultural factors are important. Women report greater use of
sun-screens than men -- but also see more benefits from sunbathing as a
way of increasing physical attractiveness.
In a cross-national comparison, psychologists at Exeter University
studied people's decision-making styles and attitudes to sun-tanning.
Professor Richard Eiser and his colleagues compared beach holidaymakers
in south-west England and north-west Italy.
In terms of vigilance concerning risk informaion and the need for
protection, the British scored higher than the Italians, and women
higher than men. The Italians were less enthusiastic for being ''outside
as much as possible when the sun shines'', or for ''lying on the
beach''. So, although Italians have a hotter climate, they are not
hell-bent on soaking up the sun over the summer period.
In psychological terms, sunbathing -- and its risk of skin cancer --
has all the makings of a classic approach-avoidance conflict. There are
immediate, positive effects -- it feels good, it's relaxation, often in
good company and nice location, and we feel and look good later in the
evening. On the negative side, there's a chance of sunburn (but only
after excessive exposure), and the possibility of skin cancer (in the
long term).
As skin cancer gets more widespread (or people's perception of risk
increases), sun worwhip could become more immediately unfashionable:
that in itself could provide a crucial impetus for sun protection
behaviour.

Elizabeth Buie reports how the counterfeit industry is now producing
fake
food -- but the health risks are real
ANDY MOYNIHAN, Strathclyde Regional Council's trading standards
controller, is a very worried man. His unit -- the largest trading
standards authority in Europe -- is used to dealing with everything from
fake perfume to counterfeit computer software. But never before has it
come up against criminal counterfeiters selling fake food -- in this
case teabags.
''This is frightening because it is food. This is now dangerous to
people's health. It is an alarming development,'' he said.
''The people behind this tend to put all their money into the
equipment for false packaging -- the contents are rubbish. At best, this
is poor quality tea.
''We find that these commercial criminals tend to take a shell unit in
a factory, and they are only there for a matter of days or weeks. They
produce the stuff and move on. Health and hygiene are not major
considerations to them. The stuff is left lying on the floor. They do
not care what is running about on top of it. Tea and coffee attract
rats, but these people do not care,'' said Mr Moynihan.
''Our main priority is public health -- we must get the fakes off the
market,'' he said.
To that end, 200 members of the department were yesterday out on
streets across Strathclyde, trying to trace and identify the counterfeit
boxes of teabags.
Less than a month ago, a similar operation was mounted to try to trace
counterfeit tins of Nescafe coffee. The counterfeiters had taken old
paint tins and wrapped them in colour photo-copied labels.
''The coffee was absolutely appalling -- but the tins were being sold
on stalls and into restaurants. They are still coming in,'' said Mr
Moynihan.
He does not rule out the possibility that the same people are behind
both the coffee and tea operations -- but whoever they are, he is
convinced that they are professional criminals who have turned to this
area because the criminal drugs scene is saturated.
''They are taking their big bucks from drug-dealing and other criminal
activities and moving to the softer end of crime,'' he said.
His conclusions, he said, were based on the sophistication of their
operations and the availability of cash to set up the kind of enterprise
needed.
''The only people in this economy with those resources are the drug
dealers,'' he said.
The people we would once have characterised as conventional criminals,
those in the underworld who used to rob banks, have now formed a
consumer mafia, he said.
Such is their investment and business diversification that business
gurus like John Harvey-Jones would be ''astonished and impressed'' by
these enterprises -- were they not criminal, said Mr Moynihan.
Strathclyde region has the only specialist consumer fraud unit in
Scotland and its members work undercover. It was intelligence received
by members of the unit that uncovered the fake tea operation. In the
past they have discovered fake clothing, compact discs, computer
software, perfume, and many other goods. Some women who have bought fake
perfume have ended up scarred and in pain.
The equipment for setting up a counterfeiting operation is paid for in
cash as the operators do not want to leave an address which could lead
to them being traced.
They are getting pounds for pennies. Something that might cost 10p to
produce would be sold to a trader for 75p, who in turn would put on a
100% mark-up and sell it to the customer for #1.50, said Mr Moynihan.
''Last week we picked up a man with #3.5m worth of computer software.
You just have to take one look at the streets of Glasgow and you will
see all the designer labels -- Giorgio Armani, Naf-Naf, Versace. Often
not a stitch of it is real,'' he said.
Fake videos were one of the commonest operations, he said. Recently,
trading standards officers had raided a factory with 100 video machines
set up. They had all been sold for cash by a high street store, no
questions asked.
''If you have the eyes to see it and the resources to tackle it, you
will discover a problem,'' said Mr Moynihan.
Currently the Strathclyde trading standards department co-operates
with police and customs and excise officers from across Britain and even
abroad. But its senior officials are concerned that local government
reorganisation will damage their powers irreparably.
''Strathclyde trading standards will be split up into 12 units. We
need a resource base; to deal with a big problem you need big resources.
This is a dangerous job. Our officers are trained in surveillance
techniques and use very expensive equipment to follow and watch the
people involved in these operations.
''There are routine demands on a trading standards department, like
petrol pumps and weighing machines to be stamped. A small department
will be crushed by routine demands. No other authority could tell 200
people to do nothing except get these teabags back in,'' said Mr
Moynihan.
The department's opponents are well-staffed and well organised. ''They
have people based outside our offices. If anyone leaves they phone the
traders and they scatter. When the street is busy and they can't see the
tictac men, they use whistles to say they are on their way,'' he said.
But, as police often find, it is not always possible to catch the
people who are investing the money in the big operations.
''The guy standing on the street who is earning a couple of pounds --
he is a nuisance. We are taking out the factories, but we are not
getting to the money. We all know who it is but we can't prove it,''
said Mr Moynihan.
He wants the courts to take commercial crime more seriously.
The counterfeiters look upon a fine of #5000 simply as a necessary
business expense, which is peanuts compared with their profits. Mr
Moynihan would like to see fines commensurate with profits, or jail
sentences being meted out.
''We are asking sheriffs to ask questions about who paid the trader to
stand on the street and to consider the fact that this money is being
fed into the drugs problem,'' said Mr Moynihan.
If the people buying the goods do not have a conscience, they should
look at the situation from the value-for-money point of view, he said.
If a pair of real Giorgio Armani or Versace jeans costs #150 and they
are only paying #50 for them, they should bear in mind that they are
really buying a pair that would normally cost #8.99 with a fake label on
them. The stitching will come away and the label wash off.
''It is a waste of money,'' said Mr Moynihan.

A COMMUNITY activist who has helped to transform the environment and
improve race relations in a formerly run-down part of Glasgow was named
yesterday as the 1995 Evening Times Scotswoman of the Year at a ceremony
in the City Chambers.
Betty Brown, a retired cleaner and trade union activist, was presented
with a silver rose bowl by Labour's Shadow Minister for Women, Clare
Short, in recognition of her work in the Garnethill area near the city
centre.
The chairperson of the local community council, Betty Brown has been
the guiding force behind the enhancement of the area and is the person
local people of all ages and races turn to to help solve any problems in
the area.
She is also chairperson of the local crime prevention and
multi-cultural committees and runs a pensioners' club and organises gala
days and other community events.
Speaking at a lunch attended by 300 women, she said: ''I'm proud to
receive the Evening Times award. This is a very special day for
Garnethill.''
Last year's title holder, Maxie Richards, who won the award for her
work with drug addicts and their families, received a replica of the
rose bowl from guest speaker Mr Roy Hattersley, the former deputy leader
of the Labour Party.

Next week is National Diabetes Week. Barclay Robertson tells of a
lifetime living with the disorder
IF you are under or overweight, constantly thirsty, trotting to the
loo more than usual, a bit listless and tired, the odds are you may be
one too. A visit to your doctor is essential, if allowed to continue
untreated, you might finish up in a coma, perhaps seriously ill.
I remember the feeling of despair when I asked a nurse in Edinburgh
Royal Infirmary how long the course of injections I was receiving would
last. ''The rest of your life,'' she replied.
It was 1947, and I was making a poor job of convalescing after ear
surgery. At the age of 15, my weight was six stones, thirst was
insatiable, and I felt terrible. There was one occasion when I simply
fell down on the pavement, bruising my face quite badly. Sent to the
diabetic ward, injections were given every four hours, penicillin to
counter an infection in the offending ear plus insulin every six hours
-- I felt like a human pin cushion . . .
After stabilisation, I was taught how to administer my own injections
-- to an orange to begin with. Sugar levels had to be checked by boiling
urine mixed with a blue fluid called Fehling's solution. The final
colour determined the sugar content. Frequent explosions didn't half
make a mess of the wall . . .
Diet was rigidly fixed, miniature scales had to be carted about to
weigh bread, cheese, fruit; vegetables such as cabbage, carrots, turnip
were ''free'' items -- no restrictions whatever. I didn't like any of
them!
My education had been interrupted for so long by the several months in
hospital that my chosen career, to become a writer, had to be abandoned.
''Pick a job where you can eat at fixed times before your injections,''
the doctor said. With a relative running an ironmongery business in
Dundee, I started as an apprentice engineers' mill finisher. At 20, I
became a representative, coping with diet when staying away from home a
week at a time, dealing with the problems that arise with
insulin-dependent diabetics without too much difficulty; later I was
manager with Alloa Co-operative's ironmongery department, got married,
bought a house, and fathered a family -- a son and a daughter. Later
still and up to retirement, I was again a salesman.
In 1963, we moved to Uplawmoor, a tiny village in Renfrewshire, where
I built a family house in 1978, another followed and, finally, a
bungalow for our son and his family. Such projects are enormously energy
consuming, teeming with difficulties for the amateur, with diabetes to
boot, but the goal was too great to give up at any time.
Nowadays the scenario is completely changed. Treatment at clinics and
surgeries is practical and friendly, discussions with specialists
readily available. All supplies, insulin, most needles, disposable
syringes etc, are free of prescription charges. Tests are carried out
using pocket blood sugar meters, accurate readings obtained in seconds
for the price of a finger prick; diet is much more relaxed, only
carbohydrates requiring careful control, but more than adequate. There
are still detrimental discriminations made by fellow workers, and
prospective employers, which are hard to dispute or prove. For example,
some car insurers inflict surcharges which are quite unjustified.
No newly diagnosed diabetic need feel as depressed as I did nearly 50
years ago. Everyone has peaks of happiness, troughs of sadness,
challenges that have to be faced. A diabetic is no different, if control
is kept, and life can be enjoyed fully. The imposition of diet,
injections, blood testing, are just challenges to be overcome like any
other.

AN English council has lost out in its attempt to win a contract to
maintain Scottish roads.
Northumberland County Council had teamed up with Balfour Beatty to bid
for the contract to salt and repair trunk roads and motorways now looked
after by Lothian, Central and Borders regional councils.
But the English council withdrew its tender yesterday after local
authority chiefs north of the Border criticised the move as an attempt
to plunder Scottish jobs.
Central Region's roads chairman, Councillor Tom Sinclair, warned the
English would face a backlash if they pressed ahead.
''They came up before in 1314 and we know what happened then,'' he
said, referring to the victory of Robert the Bruce which secured
Scottish independence.
A spokesman for Northumberland County Council said: ''It was never
meant to be a predatory bid.''
Lothian Regional Council will now lead Central, Strathclyde and
Borders in a joint tender.
Scottish Office rules mean only one public sector tender will be
allowed.

Anne Johnstone reports that, while publishers and booksellers welcome
the survival of
the Net Book Agreement, the writing may still be on the wall
* THE Net Book Agreement was introduced by British publishers in 1900
amidst concern about the number of booksellers falling victim to a
vicious discounting war between bookshops. It is a voluntary agreement
used to set a net price for a book and prevent retailers from selling
books at less than that price.
All EC countries, except Belgium, Ireland and Greece operate some form
of resale price maintainance in their book markets. In America there is
a free market and there is much discounting, particularly of
best-sellers. However, there are controls on the levels of discounts
publishers can offer to different retail outlets.
There is some discounting in Britain already. Some books (about 20%)
are published outside the NBA and can therefore be discounted.
Also, once sales of a book start to tail off, the publisher can delist
them, selling remaining stock to a middleman who sells them on at a
discounted price.
In addition, book clubs fall outside the NBA and the largest of them
has recently started selling on the High Street.
SO the Net Book Agreement survives, for the meantime anyway. Many
believed its days were numbered when the cross-party National Heritage
Committee decided to put it under the spotlight. In the brutal modern
Britain of deregulation and unbridled market forces, was there any
longer a place for what looks a lot like an anachronistic piece of
protectionism?
Booksellers and publishers who appeared before the committee to defend
the agreement, came away with bruises aplenty. ''It was a gruesome
experience,'' says Willy Anderson of the Glasgow bookshop John Smith and
Son, and current president of the Booksellers Association.
Yesterday Anderson was still coping with the pleasant shock of
discovering that the committee had come down on his side. The public
interest, its report concluded, would not be better served by abrogating
the agreement rather than retaining it.
But the impressive lobby which rallied to the defence of the NBA
should not lean too heavily on its laurels. In August or September the
NBA has another hurdle to clear when it is considered by the Restrictive
Practices Court -- an investigation ordered by the Office of Fair
Trading.
It could also be threatened by European rulings on anti-competitive
behaviour. Meanwhile, many believe the agreement is being unravelled
from within. Reed, Britain's third-biggest publisher, withdrew from the
NBA in 1991 and late last year they were followed by Hodder Headline,
which publishes a lot of the big names, including Stephen King, John Le
Carre and James Clavell.
The way events have unfolded since then has, say some booksellers,
fulfilled their worst fears. When Hodder brought out John le Carre's new
novel, Our Game, they put a cover price of #16.99 on it, but invited
retailers to discount it. The supermarket chain, Asda, which has been
keen to get in on the popular end of a deregulated book market for some
time, leapt in with both feet and put it on sale at #8.49.
The publicity coup was so effective that, though they can have made no
more than a few pence profit on each book sold, they have doubled the
sales of their other books over the same period last year.
Meanwhile, Willy Anderson says, conventional bookshops, which have
traditionally relied on making big profits on such blockbusters in order
to subsidise a wide range of slow-moving educational and esoteric
material, new authors, and the like, simply can't compete.
If big discounts on best sellers become the norm, Anderson believes
there will be dire consequences for both publishers and booksellers.
Wouldn't the death of the NBA produce a much-needed shake-out in an
old-fashioned, inefficient publishing industry which churns out far too
many books nobody wants to read, I asked him. ''Of course, there are too
many bad books published but I don't think ditching the NBA would solve
that. Instead, the books that would suffer would be new authors, and
educational and specialist books.''
And, he believes, just as in 1900 when the NBA was introduced to
protect small booksellers being eaten alive in a major discounting war,
the abolition of the NBA would signal open season for the major
bookselling chains trying to pick off the little independents.
Tim Hely Hutchinson, Hodder Headline chief executive, is unrepentant.
He told me yesterday that he had no regrets whatsoever about Hodder's
decision last year to pull out of the NBA: ''The best model for the
current situation is the US. In Britain the book market is in severe
difficulty.
''It isn't just because people are short of money and the 'feel good'
factor is missing. There's been a change in the market with all sorts of
new influences competing for people's time and money.
''Those influences are present in America too but publishers there are
fighting back by discounting. I had a choice between stimulating sales
by discounting or laying off hundreds of people and slashing our
lists.''
In the case of the le Carre, it seems to be working. Our Game has been
top of the hardback bestseller list for a month, and Hodders claim
they've sold twice as many as le Carre's previous novel, sold under the
NBA.
Hely Hutchinson denies seeking to stimulate sales at the expense of
the bookseller. ''We're saying to booksellers that if they want to
discount a title, we'll subsidise them to do it. We need to talk.''
That's exactly what's due to happen next week when Tim Hely Hutchinson
and Willy Anderson are due to meet for lunch. Oh to be a fly on the
wall.

'Car-crash' television has drawn
censure for a late-night show,
reports David Belcher
CHANNEL 4 was yesterday reminded that car-crash television is not
without its drawbacks when The Word was issued with a formal warning by
the Independent Television Commission, who urged the station to impose
stricter controls on the content of the items it broadcast.
The regulatory body objected strongly on grounds of ''taste and
decency'' to a number of ''debasing stunts'' staged during the most
recent series of the late night, youth-targeted programme, which is
currently off the air.
Studiedly controversial, The Word earned its ''car-crash TV''
soubriquet, when it became clear that it based much of its viewer appeal
on the same ghoulish and voyeuristic impulses which draw gawking crowds
to road traffic accidents.
There were three such specific film sequences to which the ITC
objected, all of which were broadcast last December. Chief among the
ITC's complaints was the edition of The Word which featured a kilted
strongman, the self-styled, self-evident Mr Powertool.
He was seen pulling a chair, on which a young woman was sitting,
across the studio floor by a rope fastened round his penis. During the
course of this endeavour, it became plain that Mr Powertool favoured
wearing the kilt au naturel.
In addition, the ITC was unhappy with the treatment meted out to two
victims of one of The Word's weekly feature strands, The Revengers.
Vengeance befell one victim in the form of Santa Claus vomiting over
him. Another victim was sprayed with the contents of an elderly man's
colostomy bag. The ITC noted that while the vomit was real, the urine
was not. As to Santa's status, meanwhile, there was no word.
''We think the Channel 4 licence has been breached by these items, and
we expect them to take account of this,'' noted the ITC, who once fined
Granada #500,000 for breaches in advertising regulations on This
Morning. They also pointed out that the colostomy bag incident
contravened ITC guidelines on jokes about personal disability.
''The element of debasement of the individuals involved. . . (was)
among the factors which took (The Word) over the edge of acceptable
standards of taste and decency required by the Broadcasting Act,'' the
ITC concluded.
Oddly, though, the ITC seems to have had fewer objections to an
equally demeaning segment of the show: I'll Do Anything To Be On TV,
aimed to discover the depths to which telly-aspirants would descend. It
regularly featured young women lowering themselves into baths of horse
ordure; youths eating maggots, and young people of both genders engaged
in graphic kissing sessions with old age pensioners who had removed
their dentures to facilitate the process.
Channel 4's commissioning editor for Youth and Entertainment Features,
Dunbartonshire-born David Stevenson, was yesterday unavailable for
comment on the ITC's censure. In keeping with his job-status, he was
reportedly on a Club 18-30 holiday in Torremolinos.
Stevenson has previously defended The Word, however, as being ''comedy
of embarrassment, a bit of slap and tickle on a Friday night. . . an
irreverent antidote to eat your greens, let's help young people across
the road TV.''
Ironically, The Word itself now seems to have stumbled fatally in
heavy congestion on terrestrial telly's info-tainment superhighway. Its
future was under debate even as the 105th episode was broadcast in
March. Channel 4 supremo Michael Grade indicated then that The Word's
makers, Planet 24, who are also responsible for C4's Big Breakfast,
would have to present an unusually good case for its retention.
But The Word isn't facing extinction because it debased its intended
audience of 15 to 24-year-olds. Indeed, as the ITC acknowledged in its
judgment, late night vomitings and genital tug-o'-war displays are
unlikely to upset a young generation who have repeatedly demonstrated
their approval of the self-same freakshow antics by filling theatres
whenever the Jim Rose Circus has come to town.
Nor is The Word in trouble for having debased the TV presenters' craft
-- because, frankly, if anyone's seen any TV frontwoman more glazed,
self-regarding and vacuous than Dani Behr, or heard greater inarticulacy
than that of Terry Christian, you're welcome to fill my hat with maggots
and eat it.
Rather, The Word has discovered the most painful truth about car-crash
TV. When you've deliberately taken the traffic lights away, the
resulting collisions lose their power to shock and outrage, eventually
becoming a crashing bore.

''NOT an inch'', ''Here I stand'', ''No surrender''. The Commons was
awash with Euro-defiance. If Chancellor Kohl thinks a summit on the
future of Europe which includes a Major Government on the ropes would be
a waste of time, yesterday's Foreign Office questions would have
convinced him he was right.
Mr David Davis, our man in charge of negotiating the summit
arrangements, happily took as his models Horatius guarding the bridge,
the boy on the burning deck, and the other youth who stuck his finger in
a dyke to prevent a Euro-flood.
''The principal aim of the Government's policies is defence of
Britain's national interest. That first, second and last,'' declared Mr
Davis. Only the rules of order can have prevented him waving a Union
Jack at the despatch box. The Euro-sceptics cheered like junkies high on
some appalling new electronic sound -- ''Rule Britannia'' arranged for
heavy metal.
What further powers would be conceded to Europe, asked a straight man.
''I can answer in one word -- none,'' replied Mr Davis. Ecstasy. Poor
Hugh Dykes, a Euro-fanatic of the calibre of Charlemagne, Napoleon or
Sir Edward Heath, was almost hissed off the pitch by his own terraces
when he meekly suggested that one could be keen on Europe and still look
after one's national interests.
Mr Davis, the St George de nous jours, made clear he would slay
dragons like ''creeping competence''. It is awful phrases like that
which put people who quite like the Continent off the idea of ''ever
closer union''.
It means that if you give the Union institutions power over
cauliflower production, you find a few months later that you have lost
control of employment law.
Mr Davis, who knows a creep when he sees one, said he would be paying
a great deal of attention to that ''area''.
The Minister has revived the role made famous by great Soviet
performers like Molotov and Vischinsky after the Second World War of the
diplomat who specialised in saying ''niet'' to just about everything. He
is our emissary to what the EU quaintly calls the Reflection Group --
or, using their stage name, Dave Davis and the Reflections. The other 15
Reflectors must spend most of their time reflecting that their European
dream is turning into a nightmare dominated by this man with a trident,
wrapped in a Union Jack who keeps on saying ''niet'' all the time.
The Euro-sceptics have become believers in Mr Davis but remain
sceptics not just about Europe but Messrs Major and Hurd as well. They
have noted in their black book that Mr Major recently promised he would
make ''no important concessions'' to Europe. But to them all concessions
are important and horrid.
What they want, as Mr Bernard Jenkin (Colchester North) made clear,
are concessions by them to us.
Mr Hurd, who is still trying to salvage something from the triumph of
Euro-diplomacy in Bosnia, let Mr Davis get on with it, probably with
relief. Being rude to opponents as Mr Davis cheerfully is, is not his
style.
Restrained patriotism rather than unrestrained jingoism is his natural
stance further modified by his years at the Foreign Office. He knows the
Tories have to wrap themselves in the flag as well as find substantial
tax cuts if they are to retain the faintest chance of clinging on to
office. Mr Hurd would not wave the flag himself but he acquiesces in Mr
Davis waving it.
Mr Robin Cook, Shadow Foreign Secretary, who watched all this with
what looked like restrained amusement, sought to prod Mr Hurd by asking
his view of a discussion paper backed by 50 Tory MPs which suggested
that Britain should create a crisis in the Union. ''You are creating a
crisis where there is none,'' said Mr Hurd master of the diplomatic
reply which sounds soothing while evading the point.
A Labour pro-European, Mr Tony Wright, having polished his adverbs and
adjectives, accused the Government of ''marching us resolutely and
remorselessly towards irrelevant and impudent isolation''. The
Euro-sceptics almost cheered. Isolation? How splendid.

INSTRUMENT failure has been identified as the most likely cause of the
air crash last month in which 12 people died when a Knight Air flight en
route from Leeds to Aberdeen plunged into a field.
In their initial report published yesterday the Department of
Transport Air Accident Investigation Branch said that two minutes after
take-off the Bandeirante aircraft reported a problem with the artificial
horizon, one of the aircraft's vital instruments.
Five and a half minutes after take-off the plane with nine passengers
and three crew on board started to spiral towards the ground breaking up
and catching fire on the descent before exploding on impact six miles to
the north-east of Leeds-Bradford Airport.
The report says that on the morning of the flight the 15-year-old
aircraft, powered by two Pratt and Whitney turboprop engines, had
completed a scheduled return flight from Leeds-Bradford to Aberdeen.
The aircraft, which had no reported defects on landing, then underwent
routine maintenance before being prepared for a scheduled passenger
flight to Aberdeen.
The weather at Leeds-Bradford was poor with a runway visual range of
1100 metres, cloud down to 400ft and a light-south easterly wind. It was
raining and the airfield had recently been affected by a thunderstorm.
The freezing level was 8000ft and both strong wind and thunderstorm
warnings were in force for the Leeds-Bradford area.
''On take off from Runway 14 at 1647 hours the aircraft was instructed
to maintain runway heading but began to turn gently to the left very
shortly after becoming airborne,'' said the report.
''Two minutes after takeoff the First Officer reported a problem with
an artificial horizon and requested a recovery to Leeds-Bradford.
''The aircraft was cleared to 3000ft and given a radar heading of 360
degrees. During the next three and a half minutes the aircraft
maintained a steady speed and rate of climb but failed to respond
correctly to the radar headings passed by the controller.
''On two occasions the pilot asked the controller if the aircraft was
on a steady heading and at 16.51 hours he acknowledged an instruction to
turn right. However, the aircraft immediately began to turn left and
shortly thereafter entered a tightening descending spiral to the left
from an altitude of 3600ft.''
The report says several witnesses saw the aircraft engulfed in flames
falling rapidly out of a low cloudbase six miles to the north-east of
Leeds-Bradford Airport at Dunkeswick. The aircraft exploded on impact
and everyone on board was killed instantly.
The initial examination of the wreckage revealed that there had been
some break-up of the aircraft before it hit the ground nose down.
The Brazilian-built Bandeirante was not fitted with either a cockpit
voice recorder or a flight data recorder but neither was required to be
fitted.
Aviation journalist Jim Ferguson said last night: ''The conditions at
the time were obviously atrocious and this begs the question: 'Why did
the plane take off at that time?' The pilot clearly became disorientated
in the extreme turbulence and there was obviously nothing he could do.''

THE families of the crew killed in the Knight Air crash were united in
grief yesterday.
Widow Mrs Pam Casson fought back tears as her pilot husband, John, 49,
was remembered at a funeral service in his home village of Luddenfoot,
West Yorkshire, at the foot of the Pennines.
The widow, who hugged her son, Thomas, and daughter, Louise, sent
flowers to the parents of air stewardess Ms Helen Leadbeater, 22, whose
funeral took place two hours later in nearby Coley.
A card with the floral tribute read: ''Sharing the sorrow in the loss
of Helen.''
The funeral of Mr Paul Denton, 29, the co-pilot, was held at
Kirkburton, Huddersfield, on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE>Royal Bank will shed 450 senior jobs in clear-out</HEADLINE>

THE Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday there would be some
compulsory redundancies among branch managers as it cut 450 top jobs in
a sweeping reorganisation of its retail activities.
But a bank spokesman said many of those losing their posts would be
redeployed elsewhere in the bank.
''We envisage that we would keep the number of compulsory redundancies
to a minimum, but there will be some,'' he said, without giving figures.
There will be 71 job losses among branch managers and assistant
managers in Scotland. The remainder will be in England, where 100 will
disappear in London alone.
Mr Sandy Boyle, the Scottish leader of the Banking Insurance and
Finance Union (BIFU), described the planned job cuts as ''outrageous''.
He said that at a time when Royal Bank was making record profits it
ought to be paying more attention to customer service instead of cutting
staff.
Mr Boyle expressed scepticism that managers and assistant managers
made redundant would be able to find new jobs in the bank, pointing out
that it was whittling down staff levels at its head office as well as in
the branches. He said he would seek guarantees about the redeployment of
staff made redundant at a meeting with Royal Bank officials on Tuesday.
The Royal Bank has shed about 2000 jobs since it announced a major
restructuring programme three years ago, although several hundred others
have been created through its mortgage and Direct Line insurance
subsidiaries.
A further 1000 jobs are due to go by 1997 after the present clean-out
of branch management, but the bank is not saying yet where the axe will
fall.
Altogether about 3500 jobs in retail banking will be lost under
Project Columbus, a five-year restructuring programme announced by the
bank in 1992.
The Royal Bank has already reorganised its branch network along these
lines in Glasgow and western Scotland.
* Royal Bank chairman Lord Younger said during a visit to the United
States that the bank had seen a modest recovery in corporate lending
this year.
''It's small, but it's there,'' Lord Younger told reporters during a
break in the International Monetary Conference in Seattle, attributing
the upturn to rising consumer confidence stemming from low inflation
growth.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday signalled a further weakening of
union influence in party policy-making, made possible by an surge in
individual membership which by the end of the year should see the party
overtake the Tories for the first time since the Second World War.
He did so in a keynote address to the Brighton annual conference of
the GMB general union the party's second biggest affailiate, which heard
he was determined to continue modernising and reforming the party-union
links.
He had been elected party leader on a platform of change and
modernisation and would never draw a line under reform. The link was a
constantly evolving relationship and would continue to evolve.
Union voting strength at the party conference which has already been
cut from 90% to 70%, he said, would be further reduced to 50% ''soon,''
in line with the principle accepted several years ago that further
reductions would be triggered once individual membership topped 300,000.
There had been a huge increase in the number of ordinary trade union
members joining the party. About 34,000 had joined at the special trade
union rate of #3 plus their political levy contributions. In all, more
than 100,000 new members had been recruited over the past year, taking
the total to 340,000.
On present trends, 400,000 was not an impossible target.
GMB general secretary John Edmonds said he could not quarrel with Mr
Blair over the 50-50 concept which was a sensible move that had been
accepted several years ago.
However, he cautioned against any reduction beyond that as the party
was a federal organisation encompassing unions and constituencies and
should hesitate before going further.
Mr Blair received a standing ovation before and after what was only
his second speech to a union conference since becoming leader. He told
the 750 delegates that unions would have to live or die not by the
influence they wield over the Labour Party but by the services they give
their members.
However, he promised a ''firm but fair'' framework of law under a
Labour Government and repeated there would be no repeal of Conservative
employment legislation requiring ballots before industrial action and
banning mass pickets.

<HEADLINE>Architect left B-listed. Shetland building to rot</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977993990</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN Edinburgh architect who allowed a historic house on Britain's most
northerly island to fall into ruin was severely criticised by Shetland
councillors yesterday.
But the islands' planning committee decided not to go ahead with a
compulsory purchase order on the house at Belmont, Unst.
Instead it will proceed with a repairs order against the owner, Mr
John Hope, who bought the B-listed building more than 20 years ago
intending to restore it.
Mr Hope said yesterday that he would ''dearly love'' to see Belmont
restored but the demands of running a busy practice and the escalating
costs of the project had prevented him carrying out his original plan.
''It's certainly not wilful neglect,'' he said.
Councillor Joan Easten, who represents Unst, was not at the planning
meeting but neighbouring councillor Peter Guy (Mid and South Yell) told
members they should use compulsory purchase to ''take it out of the
hands of this person, who's done absolutely nothing for Shetland and
nothing for this building''.
Mr Guy's colleagues disagreed, fearing an open-ended financial
commitment at a time of budget costs. Repairs to Belmont could cost at
least #100,000.
Belmont was built in 1774 for the Unst laird Thomas Mouat (1748-1819)
and is regarded as a superb example of an eighteenth-century landowner's
mansion. Mr Mouat was a voluminous correspondent who wrote the Old
Statistical Account of Unst in the 1790s.
Council officials will now try to work out the cost of making Belmont
safe, wind and water-tight, and to find a trust or individual willing to
take it over. Mr Hope said he would be delighted to co-operate.

William Russell reports that Tory Eurosceptics, after being given free
rein in the interests of party unity, now have a challenge on their
hands as the Government becomes embroiled in the Messina talks leading
to Maastricht 2.
THE Europhile fightback begins today. So far the Eurosceptics in the
Tory party have been allowed to make all the running, possibly because
the Europhiles have reckoned that with Douglas Hurd at the Foreign
Office things are in safe enough hands -- ''Doug the Fudge'' will
negotiate his way safely through in future, as he has done on so many
other issues in the past. There has also been the need not to rock the
party boat any more than the Eurosceptics were already doing.
The report on The Implications of Monetary Union, which the Action
Centre For Europe, chaired by Lord Kingsdown, former governor of the
Bank of England, is publishing, is to all intents and purposes a
Conservative Europhile enterprise -- grandees like Lords Whitelaw and
Howe are among its sponsors. It does not, apparently, hide the risks
involved in monetary union, but it does come to the conclusion that the
costs for Britain of staying out are greater, which is useful ammunition
for the Europhiles.
There has been a lull recently in the internal warring in the
Conservative ranks over Europe, but the signs are that it is about to
break out again over the issue of qualified majority voting (QMV) and
the retention of the veto in the run-up to Maastricht 2 next year, which
has begun.
The Prime Minister and Mr Hurd are between a rock and a hard place on
Europe. In the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Major promised he would keep the
British veto ''in all important areas''. It was traditional
politician-speak; the use of words intended to sound rock hard but which
prove, on examination, to be marshmallow soft.
When he and Mr Hurd entered the negotiations which led to Maastricht
the talk was tough, the result was compromise. The powers of the
European Parliament were increased, a European defence pact was
established, and so on.
At Messina last weekend, Mr David Davis, the statutory Foreign Office
Eurosceptic -- one has one in the ministerial team just as one has a
woman, or two, in the Cabinet -- fought the good fight against the
federalist horde. Was he his master's voice? Some thought not.
The Foreign Office, however, insist Mr Davis was speaking to his brief
(all a junior minister is allowed to do) and, yes, Mr Hurd does want the
veto kept. Those who discern any difference between Mr Davis and Mr Hurd
are wrong. Nor is there any difference between Mr Hurd and Mr Major.
The Government has arguably dug a pit for itself, largely because of
the perceived need to keep the Tory party united. It is possible to run
a tight central bureaucracy with a small membership, currently 15, where
votes represent the relative strengths of the member states, and where a
veto is a handy, but rarely used, last resort.
When used, it looks good to the folk back home, should domestic
politics require resistance to action the other members want. Our
partners, however, want to end the national veto over a whole range of
decisions and move to a system of qualified majority voting instead.
Mr Hurd is an enthusiastic advocate of enlargement and retaining the
veto. Standing firm behind its possession, while at the same time
advocating enlargement are, as far as Labour is concerned, contradictory
positions. In an enlarged community different rules will be required
because the need for consensus is greater, and 23 or more veto holders
could cause chaos, it is said. At the same time, the QMV system is
complicated -- it involves balancing votes between the different member
states taking their size into consideration -- and it will be difficult
to devise an appropriate new system. But Mr Hurd has demanded a
''root-and-branch review'' of the present arrangements.
Commission President Jacques Santer has called for an end to the veto
in key areas like foreign and security policy. The Foreign Office argue
that QMV simply won't work, but that was what the Luddites argued.
Nobody will know until it is tried. The Prime Minister has repeatedly
insisted he would block any moves to dilute the national veto. What he
said on Tuesday is his most recent position on the subject and is not
exactly rock solid.
Nor is it what Mr Davis said. After Messina he declared: ''We will
oppose the extension of qualified majority voting in any areas.'' But he
is only a junior minister whose words can always be said to have been
taken out of context should the need arise. Mr Major and Mr Hurd will
take their stand on what the Prime Minister said, which allows room for
manoeuvre.
It could, however, all be hypothetical as far as they are concerned.
The European leaders may well delay the 1996 inter-governmental
conference (IGC) -- the only treaty requirement is that it should start
in 1996. The feeling in Whitehall is that it will not begin early in the
year, and, if it is held around June, again under a Dutch presidency,
but not in Maastricht, then so be it.
How long the conference will take is anybody's guess. That causes the
Government no problems. The agenda will be federalist, and by the time
the IGC has to come to conclusions Britain could have a new Labour
Government prepared to play the federalist game. Or, if Mr Major is back
in Downing Street, his party would be so relieved at keeping the
ministerial limousines and the other perks of power that he would be in
a position of strength when it came to justifying the outcome.
Monetary union is not on the agenda for 1996, but it is the key issue
as far as the Europhiles and Eurosceptics are concerned, which is why
today's report is important. The short-term battle will rage over other
issues, including QMV and the veto. But QMV is one of those issues
voters rapidly find boring since it is a technical matter.
It is not how decisions are reached, which upset people, so much as
the decisions themselves. How you get there is actually irrelevant. QMV
is not an issue on which to go to the country. Anybody who did that
would find the issue changing as the campaign developed. But pounds in
the pocket -- or Ecus in the wallet -- are quite different. Those are
emotive issues.
It now seems Mr Hurd is going to see the Government out. At the
beginning of the year it looked otherwise, but his departure at the next
reshuffle appears unlikely, the heirs apparent less attractive, and the
need for the Prime Minister to keep loyal colleagues -- Mr Hurd is,
above all, loyal -- around him all the greater.
That heartens the Europhiles, given Mr Hurd's skills as a negotiator.
In other words, the veto may survive for a few key areas of policy, but
QMV, after that root-and-branch review, will be allowed to operate over
a wider range of EU matters. The dodgy areas are constitutional change,
harmonised taxation, and a member state's community contributions. The
emphasis will be on those areas it does not apply to rather than those
it does.
The likelihood is that QMV will be found to be workable and the
safeguards secured by Mr Major and Mr Hurd at Maastricht 2 will be
allegedly formidable. If it is Mr Blair and Mr Cook who must finish what
others have started at the IGC, they will still be formidable -- and
they will still include a veto over certain areas of policy.
Mr Hurd summed up the situation last September when he said that in
Europe one had to decide whether one wanted a decision or not. If one
did, one could always find one.

FEARS that the Government is planning to pull Britain out of
membership of the International Labour Organisation, a United Nations
body, were voiced last night by Opposition MPs.
The ILO seeks to improve labour conditions, workers' living standards
and promote employment through international action.
The Opposition MPs were alerted earlier this week when Employment
Secretary Michael Portillo told them the Government was bound to look
closely at whether Britain received value for the #7.9m it contributes
annually.
However, Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg told the Commons
yesterday that, in written replies, Mr Portillo had made the
Government's ''position and commitment'' quite clear.
Labour MPs were reassured until, checking the Comons answer to Tory MP
Mr Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton), they found it contained no
comitment to continued membership.
Instead, asked to list benefits of membership Mr Portillo simply
stated that ILO purchases of goods and services had provided UK
consultants and others with about #2.25m a year in recent years.
Mr Denis MacShane, Labour MP for Rotherham, in a letter to the
Speaker, Miss Betty Boothroyd, said Mr Hogg had shown him a draft reply
from Mr Portillo which stated that ILO membership ''brought important
benefits to the UK.''
He said he did not accuse Mr Hogg of bad faith, although his answer
misled the House, but asked that a statement be made today to clear up
the question of Britain 's membership.
The Foreign Office said last night that ILO membership was ultimately
a matter for the Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and that no precipitate
decision would be taken.

CHANNEL 4 received a formal warning yesterday over tasteless stunts on
its controversial youth show, The Word.
The stunts included a man in a kilt pulling a girl on a chair by a
rope attached to his penis, a Santa Claus vomiting over a victim, and
someone else having an elderly man's colostomy bag emptied over him. The
bag, at least, had fake liquid.
The warning came from broadcasting regulator, the Independent
Television Commission.
It criticised the ''debasement'' of people involved in the scenes and
said there must be stricter controls in any future series.
''We think the Channel 4 licence has been breached by these items and
we expect them to take account of this,'' said an ITC spokesman.
The three items which caused ''serious concern'' were criticised on
the grounds of ''taste and decency''.
The colostomy bag incident was also felt to contravene guidance given
in the ITC's Programme Code on jokes about personal disability.
Channel 4 has not yet decided if it will recommission The Word, made
by independent programme maker Planet 24 and presented by Terry
Christian and Dani Behr. It is no longer on air.
Mr Grade said yesterday the ITC ruling would not influence Channel 4's
decision.
The ITC had said it acknowledged the ''youthful target audience of The
Word and its late evening transmission time at the start of the weekend.
Nevertheless, the commission believes that a line has to be drawn on
what is acceptable on television and has judged that in the three
instances cited that line was overstepped.''
In February last year Channel 4 was ordered to broadcast an apology
over ''grossly offensive remarks'' about incest made by an American
actor on The Word.

THE future of the renowned food science laboratory in Torry, Aberdeen,
still was hanging in the balance last night.
North-East MPs met Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, and emerged encouraged
by his backing for the task force in Aberdeen which will have to devise
an alternative proposal to closure within 30 days.
Jobs are at risk in Aberdeen through plans to transfer the research
work to York.
Aberdeen South Tory MP Raymond Robertson -- who is fighting hard to
retain local jobs -- said last night: ''I am pleased by the outcome of
the meeting.
''There is a long, hard fight ahead, but the support of the Scottish
Office is greatly welcome.''
The Scottish Secretary was said to have been very helpful, and has
promised the full support of himself and officials in anything that
needs to be done to further the work of the task force.
Following the meeting with Mr Lang, Mr Robertson has written to
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave, demanding that full details of
the costs involved in operating Torry and of the claimed savings from
closure be given to the task force.
The Scottish Office said: ''It was a very constructive meeting and the
Secretary of State offered the assistance of officials and experts to
help them come up with the best possible range of options.
''The Secretary of State is trying to get the best outcome for
Scotland.''

TWO young Scottish ravens -- replacing a pair dismissed for unsociable
behaviour -- were handed over at the Tower of London yesterday, and one
immediately pecked a keeper.
Nine-week-old Hugine gave Mr David Cope a few pecks on the hand. But
Mr Cope, who has been raven master at the tower for four years, smiled
genially.
Scottish Environment Minister Sir Hector Monro -- wearing leather
gloves -- handed over Hugine and Munin, who were taken from nests in
North Uist.
''I am very pleased that these ravens have come from North Uist to the
tower to maintain the mythology that disaster would befall the kingdom
if the ravens ever left the tower,'' said Sir Hector
Legend has it that Charles II complained that ravens were upsetting
his astronomical observations when the Royal Observatory was at the
tower. He ordered their destruction, but was told that a disaster would
happen to the kingdom, so he decreed that at least six ravens should
always be kept there.
To be on the safe side, the tower has kept eight birds, and Hugine and
Munin become the ''reserves''.
Mr Cope said their two predecessors, Jackie and another Hugine, had
become very aggressive. ''They were fighting with all the other birds.
So they had to leave, and they are now in a huge aviary at the Welsh
Mountain Zoo.''
He said the two new birds, whose sex was not yet known, were settling
in well and would be ready to stalk freely round the tower in about
three weeks.
They were unable to fly away because one of their wings was clipped.

TORY MP Neil Hamilton, who resigned as a junior Minister after failing
to declare a stay at the Paris Ritz, yesterday escaped with the
equivalent of a slap on the wrist from the Commons committee
investigating his conduct.
A report on the affair by the Committee on Members' Interests found
that, although the hospitality, worth #3600, should have been declared,
there were no grounds for further action.
However, Labour rejected the ruling and raised doubts over the
committee's future, claiming it marked the ''death-knell'' of
self-regulation. Labour MPs on the committee boycotted its last session
and refused to participate in the final draft of the report.
They claimed the Government and the committee's Tory members had
conspired to ''whitewash'' the facts. Labour MP Angela Eagle called the
report ''a travesty'' and said the committee had abdicated its role as
independent supervisor of MPs' behaviour.
However, Mr Hamilton last night issued a statement accusing other MPs
of failing to register interests.
''Anticipating this report, members on all sides of the House,
including senior Shadow Cabinet members, have been rushing, years after
the event, to register hospitality and foreign trips which should have
been registered within four weeks of occurring,'' he said. ''This
confirms that I was far from alone in my interpretation of the rules.''
Mr Hamilton was the subject of a complaint to the committee by the
Liberal Democrat MP Alex Carlile, following newspaper reports last year
that Mr Hamilton and his wife had stayed in the Ritz hotel in Paris in
1987 as guests of Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed.
He resigned as Corporate Affairs Minister and initiated libel
proceedings against the Guardian newspaper.
In written evidence to the committee, Mr Hamilton insisted his stay
was a private arrangement and had no bearing on his conduct in
Parliament. He argued that the rules on MPs' registering their interests
were unclear in 1987 and had since been tightened.
However, the MPs concluded that ''it was imprudent of him not to have
taken the precaution of consulting the registrar at the time.''
Labour members of the committee claimed the final sentence to the
conclusions, recommending that no further action was needed against Mr
Hamilton, had been added without their approval.
The committee chairman, Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, said there
was ''radical disagreement'' within it over how to handle the inquiry.
''I am sorry that Labour members did not feel able to attend the meeting
at which we completed consideration of our report.'' The rest of the
committee felt that it would be unfair to all concerned to delay the
matter further.

POLICE in Tayside are to be given more specialised equipment to
protect them from the rising incidence of assaults.
The force is to be equipped with extendable batons, body armour and
rigid handcuffs, a special meeting of Tayside Region's police and fire
committee decided yesterday.
Assaults on police in Tayside have risen by almost a third in a year.
There were 496 cases last year compared with 366 in 1993.
Injuries suffered by officers included an officer who needed plastic
surgery after his ear was bitten off, a colleague who was off work for
months with his head enclosed in a cage to reset a broken jaw and a
probationary officer who had her arm broken.
Chief Constable William Spence made the plea for extra protection for
officers who ''will from time to time face confrontational violence.''
''It would increase their confidence when faced with threatening
situations thereby improving police efficiency,'' he said.
The cost of the new equipment will be more than #47,000. But a 51%
Government grant will leave the council to pay around #23,000 of the
total cost.
Mr Alex Shand, police and fire convener on the council, explained:
''It is very important that our police force receive the necessary
protection so that they can carry out their duties properly.
''Their job has become increasingly hazardous and we want to do all we
can to help protect officers who are working in the interests of the
public.''
The council move was welcomed by Mr Spence last night.
He said: ''Assaults on police officers are an attack upon us all and I
am grateful for the ready support of the police authority in providing
means of protecting officers.''
The chief constable also said that the cost of the equipment will be
offset by savings on sick leave.

Jack Webster reports how the former diplomat and Buckingham Palace
press chief Michael Shea has tapped his inside information in his other
career as a thriller writer.
IN HIS days as a British diplomat, it was hardly politic for Michael
Shea to write thrillers under his own name; thus the pseudonym of
Michael Sinclair.
Nor would it have been any more proper in his days as press chief at
Buckingham Palace, especially as his list of 1970s thrillers included
Dollar Covenant, which dealt with political rioting in the streets of
Glasgow! Her Majesty, I believe, was very understanding.
In any case, Michael Shea now had enough on his palace plate, what
with royal weddings, an Irish intruder in the Queen's bedroom, his
much-publicised punch-up with a Chinese guard in Tiananmen Square, and a
Sunday Times story of the Queen being at odds with Mrs Thatcher.
The suspicion of a ''mole'' in that last story was clarified, hands
up, by the press secretary himself, who said it must have come from a
misinterpretation of his own answers to journalists' questions.
All that, however, is now far behind him and he is free to use his
name as he wishes. So, writing as Michael Shea for the first time in
fiction, he is back in the business of thrillers with Spin Doctor, about
all that skulduggery and devious dancing down the corridors of power
which shows how well he knows the reality of political life in Britain
today.
The line between fact and fiction can be the breadth of a libel
action. But in the gap between his novels, Shea has written books like
Personal Impact, which argued the frightening importance of image as
opposed to substance.
''Take John Major, for example,'' he says. ''I don't think he is
improving. He is a nice, genuine, charming guy but he lacks the killer
instinct.''
He sees Tony Blair, on the other hand, as the astute figure who also
knows that Labour can lose the next election rather than the Tories
winning it.
''Because they lack conviction and are driven by a desire to keep
their jobs and gain promotion, many people in politics will opt for the
expedient, rather than what is right for the country,'' says Shea.
''I am not accusing the present Government of this. But there are
certainly elements in the Government who are behaving in this way.''
So image comes to the fore: ''The Tories are selling their policies
extremely badly. Some of those policies are working quite well and the
economy is not as bad as some people make out. But the marketing aspect
desperately needs to be worked on.''
To put it bluntly, Michael Shea believes the next election will be won
by the spin doctors, those shadowy figures who advise the leaders,
creating the stories which will catch the headlines at the opportune
moments.
''It is not whether you would nationalise or denationalise that will
count in the end,'' he says. ''When you have people looking for
consensus, it is the perception the electorate will have of the
leadership quality that will matter.''
So who are those powerful people behind the scenes?
''When the history of the Major years is written, the key figure in
policy-making will be seen as Sarah Hogg (wife of Foreign Office
Minister Douglas Hogg) who resigned recently from her post at No 10 but
did much of the thinking and defined the tactics.''
Other influential names which trip from his tongue include Tim Bell (a
former Saatchi and Saatchi man) and Peter Mandelson, backroom advisers
who wield the kind of power few of us know about.
Michael Shea, whose grandfather came to help establish Singer's
factory at Clydebank in the 1880s, grew up in Lenzie, went to
Gordonstoun and Edinburgh University and, in time, followed John le
Carre at the embassy post in Bonn. Like his predecessor, with so much
authentic background knowledge, his thoughts turned to the writing of
thrillers.
But the fates turn on minor incidents. While deputy director of
information in New York, he turned back to answer the phone as he was
leaving the office one night. The ambassador wanted him to look after
the Queen's visit to the United States. If he hadn't answered that phone
the role might have gone to someone else.
The Queen liked his style and out of it came the chance to become
press chief at Buckingham Palace.
Since then he has been holding an executive post in Lord Hanson's
empire, chairing business enterprises in Scotland and elsewhere, and
imparting his experience as visiting professor of media and
communication studies at Strathclyde University.
When his post-graduate students have gathered in the wisdom of the
former diplomat, they might pick up a few more tips from the central
character of his latest novel, Dr Mark Ivor, a Scot.
And speaking of Scotland, Michael Shea gives his last word to a worry
about the whingeing nature of his own nation.
''There is so much going for Scotland,'' he says, ''yet we are so keen
to belittle ourselves, to knock our own country. It is something we must
stop or we shall destroy ourselves, no matter who is in power.''

<HEADLINE>Bid to to scrap 'not proven' rejected. Call for Government to act on 'cop-out' verdict heavily defeated in the Commons</HEADLINE>

A FRESH move to abolish the ''not proven'' verdict in the Scottish
courts was defeated heavily in the Commons last night.
MPs voted by 325 votes to 117, a majority of 208, against a proposal
by Labour MP John Home Robertson that ''in any criminal proceedings the
verdict of not proven shall no longer be competent.''
The debate was set against the background of the recent controversy
surrounding the case of the death of 19-year-old Hamilton student Amanda
Duffy. A murder charge against Francis Auld was found not proven by a
jury.
He has decided not to defend a #50,000 civil action brought against
him by the girl's parents.
In the Commons yesterday, as MPs reached the final stages of the
Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, Mr Home Robertson (East Lothian) urged
the scrapping of the unique verdict of not proven because it was a ''cop
out.''
He said: ''This not proven verdict may be a rather quaint Scottish
tradition, but nostalgia cannot be a sound basis for good justice. The
not proven verdict is a device for side-stepping justice and it has been
tolerated for far too long. Above all, I think it is time for the
Government to come off the fence.''
From the Labour Front Bench, Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson, the constituency MP for the murdered student and her family,
said he backed the amendment but promised his colleagues a free vote on
the issue.
He said the three-verdict system had led to confusion and undermined
faith in the Scottish criminal justice system. People leaving the court
with a not proven verdict had to suffer a stain on their reputation, he
said, adding: ''Not proven certainly undermines the presumption of
innocence. The people most happy with a not proven verdict are people
who are guilty and got off.
''We want to eliminate the possibility that juries go for this cop-out
verdict, which leaves neither the defendant nor the victim satisfied at
the end of the day.''
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat spokesman and a QC, said the not
proven verdict should be retained.
''In my professional practice, I don't ever recall more than a couple
of trials in which a not proven verdict was reached in which I felt that
justice had been impeded or had not been done.''
Labour MP Malcolm Chisholm (Leith) added his support for the verdict.
The counter-arguments had been driven by events in Hamilton, and he
understood reasons for it. ''But I think we have to stand back from that
particular campaign.''
For the Government, Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton defended the not-proven verdict, stating that the
three-verdict system had been part of Scottish criminal law for more
than 250 years.
There had been a consultation exercise, and two out of three
substantive responses supported retention of the three verdicts.
Among other measures, the Bill -- which last night received an
unopposed third reading -- seeks to reform bail legislation, giving
courts new powers to deal with offending on bail, improves the
procedures for the selection of juries, and extends the system of fiscal
fines to enable the Crown to deal with a wider range of offences out of
court.
During the debate, Mr Ian Davidson (Govan -- Lab.) claimed the justice
system's credibility was being undermined by people's perception of
''revolving door'' justice which released people repeatedly to offend
while on bail.
He said five youngsters arrested during gang fights at the recent
Govan Fair already were facing a total of 104 charges against them.
''People in Scotland will only believe justice has been improved if
they see action taken in the community against repeat offenders,'' he
said.
* In joining calls -- defeated in a vote -- for a liaison officer to
help victims cope with court appearances, Liberal Democrat Jim Wallace
(Orkney and Shetland) said that in the past few days he had ''joined the
ranks of those who have become victims of crime'' -- but he did not give
any more details.

Ayrshire's farming community are digging deep for a cause close to
their hearts.
THE barn dance organised by the cattle semen company was a great
success, and now a lot of people are roaming the countryside holding up
banks and rustling cattle.
With the lambing season over, strange things are going on in the
Ayrshire farming community. Men are appearing at remote farms demanding
money or livestock, an entire wedding party was recently held to ransom,
and local bank managers have been persuaded to part with thousands of
pounds.
The police are not unduly concerned, however, as they have been
assured it is all in a good cause. For the second time in 30 years, the
farming families of the county are rallying around an unusual
fund-raising campaign. Cash is always welcome, but contributions are
more likely to take the form of a pedigree calf, a spare sheep or two,
or a foal.
The beneficiary of this rural generosity is Hansel Village, a
residential care, training and employment centre for mentally
handicapped near Symington, which is an unusual kind of place in itself.
Far removed from the austere image of most mental institutions, it is an
oasis of hope and happiness. It is a place where disabled people learn
to live and work together in a relaxed community, free of the prejudices
and abuse many experienced as children, with the prospect of leading
normal lives in the outside world. It is also a place where people smile
a lot.
This is what impressed Logan Kennedy, a local farmer and butcher, when
he was invited to help raise funds for a new #450,000 residential unit
in the village. ''I was amazed by the friendliness here,'' he recalls.
''Everybody was smiling, everybody seemed happy. It really touches you,
it makes you feel humble. I'm delighted to be able to help, and the
response so far has been tremendous.''
Mr Kennedy convenes a steering committee of the Ayrshire Farmers for
Hansel Appeal, which has designated 60 collecting areas. Farmers in one
area alone have pledged more than 30 head of cattle, including pedigree
calves each expected to fetch hundreds of pounds at an auction at Ayr
cattle market on September 2. A competition to guess the contents of a
sweetie jar in one of Mr Kennedy's shops is not expected to realise such
grand sums, but every little helps.
For Blanche Nicholson, the senior care manager at Hansel, the
generosity of the local farming community means developing a vision born
out of heartache more than 40 years ago. It was then her parents, Tom
and Isobel Murdoch, learned that her younger sister Lindy was suffering
from Down's syndrome. They were told she was unlikely to live longer
than five years.
''It was a shock to all of us. In those days the mentally handicapped
tended to be tucked away in corners. Mum and Dad persevered and Lindy
survived, but at the age of 16 all special schools and facilities
stopped. It was as if society had switched off the lights on her.''
Her parents visited America, where they discovered a concept of
village communities in care which allowed the mentally disabled to form
normal friendships and working relationships. As a textile manufacturer,
Mr Murdoch had the resources to create a similar environment for his
daughter and for others unable to afford such facilities.
In 1964 the Murdochs acquired Broadmeadows, a private 20-acres estate
north of Prestwick, and set about converting it into a community of
supervised homes and places of work and leisure for those like their
daughter who needed help in coping with life. Contrary to a popular
misconception, the name Hansel was not inspired by a German fairy tale.
It is an old Scots word for ''gift''.
The centre now caters for more than 100 residents, including Lindy
Murdoch who is now a healthy 46-year-old. About 30 people living locally
also come on a daily basis for employment and to learn technical and
social skills. Within the complex of residential lodges and cottages
there is a thriving market garden, a knitwear factory, an industrial
laundry, and a pottery. It also has a restaurant and gift shop for
thousands of visitors who come each year to buy plants, pullovers, and
pots.
Strolling around the grounds and leafy lanes is an education in itself
for the casual visitor. Distaste and fear of the abnormal, born of
ignorance, is dispelled by the good humour of residents and staff. It is
hard to recoil from a polite greeting and a smile.
Mrs Nicholson sums up the Hansel philosophy thus: ''The village is
full of individuals. Everyone is a real person and we see them as such,
not as somebody with a disability. The idea is not so much to care for
the handicapped, but rather to work with them, to help them realise
their full potential. We give them a reason to get up in the morning,
and make life real for them.
''Environment is very important. We have learned that if you give
disadvantaged people the right environment and support, they can do a
tremendous amount for themselves.''
There is no doubt that the Hansel approach has worked wonders. Over
the years, dozens of residents who might otherwise have been in
permanent institutional or family care have moved out to sheltered
housing in the area, having learned to cope for themselves. Many others
still living at Hansel commute to work locally.
According to Sandy McCance, the training administrator, the question
is no longer whether residents are ready for the community, but whether
the community is ready for them.
Willie Kruger from Edinburgh made the transition two years ago, moving
to a one-bedroom flat in sheltered housing in Prestwick after 15 years
at Hansel. He still works in the village knitwear unit, producing
high-quality garments for clients as diverse as Strathclyde Police and
Russian oil workers in the Caspian Sea.
Willie has overcome a learning disability which provoked anti-social
behaviour as a child to become an articulate advocate for the Hansel
approach. There is eloquence in his honesty. ''I'll always have fond
memories of living here. The staff are caring people who let you go at
your own speed. They are here to help you decide what you want to do.
''Leaving was a lot harder than what I thought, but I'm getting there
slowly. You just take each day as it comes. Most everybody I've met have
been really friendly and good. But still I think some people label us
and that's wrong. We are human beings, with the same rights and emotions
as anybody else.''
Ask Willie if he has any unfulfilled ambitions, and after a moment's
reflection he says: ''I love horse riding, and it's always been one of
my dreams one day to go riding with the Princess Royal.''
In the pottery shed Jimmy Davidson from Yorkshire is less capable of
expressing himself but he seems equally happy with life. He suffers from
Down's syndrome, but has become an expert in slipcasting plaster moulds,
and a prize-winning artist.
He smiles pleasantly when asked about his work, responds briefly but
succinctly, and says he is looking forward to a holiday in the Lake
District. Given the severity of his disability, his smile alone is a wee
miracle.
In early summer the market garden is a riot of colour thronged with
visitors spending up to #1000 a day on plants. John Rodger from Fenwick,
the horticulturalist in charge, is pleased with the commercial success
of the venture but he gets just as big a kick out of watching his
disabled helpers gaining skills and confidence. ''We get a lot of
business, which is good. But when you see someone sowing a seed tray
who's never done it before, that's a real bonus. It's something you
can't buy.''
It does have to be paid for, however, and the cost of miracles is
going up -- which is where Logan Kennedy and his farming fraternity come
in. The last time they were asked for help in 1963, the Hansel Harvest
charity auction raised #20,000 for a residential lodge still known as
The Farmers' House. The new complex of two six-bedroom homes is costing
considerably more, but the Great Ayrshire Cattle Drive is now in full
swing and a rich harvest is anticipated at the livestock auction in
September.

A HIGH Court judge yesterday cleared both the Aberdeen Press and
Journal newspaper and Grampian Television of contempt of court but
issued a clear warning to journalists as a result of their actions.
Lord Johnston accepted the apologies tendered on behalf of both
organisations after two separate hearings at the High Court in Forfar
which arose in connection with the trial for murder of Nawal Nicol, who
walked free when the Crown dropped the charges.
She had been charged with murdering her husband and offering two men,
now serving life sentences for murdering Mr Stuart Nicol, #25,000 to
kill him. Grampian Television reporter Mark White and Head of News and
Current Affairs Mr Alistair Gracie appeared as a result of Mr White
having approached a witness who was about to give evidence.
Mr Edward Bowen, QC, on behalf of Grampian Television, said that Mr
White had not been covering the actual trial, but had been preparing a
background story, and was not aware that the witness concerned had not
given his evidence.
The interview was not to be used until the conclusion of the trial,
and Mr Bowen argued there was no contempt.
Lord Johnston said his general concern was that, if a witness was
approached within the precincts of the court before giving evidence, it
could have a material effect.
Lord Johnston said that, in considering the matter, he recognised
Grampian's excellent track record in the coverage of criminal justice in
Scotland over a considerable period of time.
He said he was satisfied that there had been no contempt.
The editor of the Aberdeen-based morning newspaper The Press and
Journal appeared as a result of its use of a photograph of the accused
following the first day of evidence.
Mr Edward Targowski, QC, on behalf of the newspaper, said that a
reporter acting on behalf of the paper had asked the lawyer for the
accused whether a photograph could be used and had been told that, as
far as the lawyer was concerned, identification was not an issue. The
newspaper then published the photograph.
Later the advocate-depute said that this was not his understanding of
the circumstances and that Mrs Nicol's lawyer had indicated that the
newspaper would have to take its own advice on that matter.
Lord Johnson said that, in this particular case, there was no
substantial risk of causing justice to be prejudiced, but he cautioned:
''As a matter of general observation, I deprecate the publication of
photographs in any circumstances during a criminal trial.''

<HEADLINE>Parkhurst escape was easy, killer tells BBC</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CONVICTED killer Keith Rose heaped fresh embarrassment on the prison
service yesterday by claiming a governor at a top-security jail
unwittingly helped him break out by waving keys at inmates.
Senior officials were later holding an urgent inquiry to find out how
Rose, 45, was able to telephone the BBC and say he and two fellow
escapers had been ''absolutely amazed at how easy it was''.
He claimed prisoners at Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight were able to
copy a key to a locked gate after studying it at close quarters when the
unnamed governor ''waved it under people's noses'' during disciplinary
lectures.
Building work reduced the hazards of the escape in January because it
had created an extra gate for officers to monitor.
Rose, 45, jailed for life for the murder of the wife of a supermarket
magnate, was on the run for five days after a breakout with Matthew
Williams and Andrew Rodger.
The prison service refused to comment on the allegations last night,
saying nothing would be said until after General Sir John Learmont,
leading an official inquiry, had produced his report -- expected within
weeks.
But a spokesman confirmed two senior officials -- northern area
operational manager Tony Pearson and security director Richard Tilt --
were investigating how Rose had been able to call the BBC from Full
Sutton prison, near York, where he was transferred after the Parkhurst
breakout.
After Rose's escape, prison governor John Marriott was removed from
his job even though he had complained about security problems at the
jail which were not acted on by the prison service.
The escape led to a huge police manhunt and the three men were only
caught after they tried to steal an aeroplane on the Isle of Wight.
''An extra 10 minutes there and we would have got off . . . but we
were expecting the police at any moment,'' Rose said yesterday.
Crucial to the escape attempt were the door key and a ladder, both
apparently manufactured by prisoners.
''The ladder, when it was disassembled, resembled a pile of components
-- but assembled it was a ladder,'' said Rose.
''We made the key through observation of people using it. Oddly enough
it was a governor -- not John Marriott -- who was the most assistance on
that because he had a habit of waving the keys under people's noses when
he was lecturing them.''

FOUR hundred Scottish employees of Dawson International yesterday
faced a bleak future -- at the same time that directors of the company
were enjoying a pay-off of #2.2m.
Most of the employees are working out redundancy notices at Dawson's
factories at Arbroath, Kilwinning, and Hawick and all are due to go by
the end of next month.
While most employees are receiving minimal redundancy terms, Dawson's
annual report, published yesterday, showed that #2.2m was being paid to
former directors in compensation, including #1.36m to Mr Philip Kemp,
the former head of Dawson International.
Dawson announced in March that it was to close its contract knitwear
plant at Arbroath, with the loss of 221 jobs, and its carpet yarn plant
at Kilwinning, with 138 jobs. Another 53 jobs were to go at Hawick.
Mr John Farries, Borders branch secretary for the GMB union, said
yesterday the workers at Hawick were getting ''very little'' in
redundancy money.
''There is a lot of disgust here about the huge pay-offs the
executives are getting,'' he said.
Mr Farries said that the employees at Hawick were mainly young people
and workers with little length of service. Two supervisors with 20
years' service each would get #6000--#7000.
Mr Derek Finlay, chairman of Dawson International, defended the amount
of compensation paid to the former directors. He said the board had
acted quickly to avoid potentially expensive court proceedings.
A Dawson spokeswoman said that after the Kilwinning facility closed on
July 28, 480 people would continue to be employed by Blackwood Brothers.
The rundown of the three plants was ongoing, she said.
The spokeswoman suggested that Mr Finlay would be sympathetic to the
plight of the employees compared with the former directors.

COUNCILLORS in Central region yesterday gave the go-ahead to a #4m
road into the centre of Stirling while at the same time scrapping
proposals to reopen an eight-mile section of railway to passenger
traffic at a cost of #3.4m.
Railtrack and anti-road protesters had said the Labour-controlled
council would be guilty of an environmental double whammy if its
technical services committee approved the recommendations.
Plans for the controversial Stirling eastern access road -- which some
objectors have warned could become a new M77 -- will now be discussed at
a public meeting in the Riverside area of the town on June 15 before
going before the region's policy committee for a final decision on June
20.
Anti-road campaigner Ms Lesley Rowan said she had been expecting a
''maverick'' decision from yesterday's committee, but hoped the ruling
Labour group would throw the plan out at the next stage.
A new package being put forward by the region's highway engineers
includes fine-tuning to the controversial road's town centre junction,
but still involves carving a swath through the semi-derelict Forthside
area of Stirling, which local residents want turned into a park.
At yesterday's meeting, councillors also agreed not to fund a further
study on plans to reopen the eight-mile stretch of railway track between
Stirling and Alloa.
Railtrack had hoped the scheme could have led to the reopening of
further track between Alloa and Dunfermline and the re-establishment of
a Forth circular line and commuter links from Glasgow into Fife.
SNP Councillor Willie Alexander, a lone voice of criticism, said
Central region had allowed the opportunity to reopen the Alloa line to
slip through its own intransigence.

<HEADLINE>Souness accuses ex-wife of lying.  'Criticism is part and parcel of my business but I can never accept this'</HEADLINE>

FORMER Rangers manager Graeme Souness yesterday told the High Court of
his former wife's ''incredible appetite for lying''.
Souness, 42, who was divorced from 39-year-old Danielle in May 1994,
said she had developed this trait after he met the woman who became his
second wife. Danielle, the mother of his two sons, had threatened time
and time again to do a newspaper article about him, he said.
Watched by both Danielle and his wife of one year, Karen, Souness said
he would never get over the People's May 1993 story which branded him a
''dirty rat'', and which is the subject of his ''massive'' damages claim
against publishers MGN Ltd.
''It confirmed the kind of lies she is capable of telling. She has
developed an incredible appetite for telling lies since I met Karen and
that's why I'm here today,'' he told Mr Justice Morland and the jury.
The front-page story alleged he had ordered Danielle, their sons
Frazer and Jordan and his adopted daughter, Chantelle, to leave their
home by Christmas Eve and had refused to pay the boys' school fees.
It claimed that Danielle was living on hand-outs from her parents, and
that even before the ''eviction'' she had to grovel to Mr Souness, who
also managed Liverpool, for cash to feed and clothe the children.
Souness, the former Scotland midfielder, described how the day on
which he was to be re-confirmed in his post as manager of Liverpool,
after months of speculation, was soured by a visit to the newsagent near
his home in Mere, Knutsford, Cheshire.
''Maybe some of it was my imagination but I felt they were all looking
at me,'' he said. ''I got out as quick as I could, got back to the car
and went through the paper three or four times but nothing registered.
''I got home to Karen and said 'you won't believe what she has done'.
When I opened the paper I saw a picture of my children looking back at
me. There was anger and a feeling of being let down. I could not accept
that someone I had spent 10 years of my life with could do that to me
and our children.''
He added: ''Criticism is part and parcel of my business but I can
never accept this -- I've been accused of something which is just a load
of lies from start to finish.''
Souness said the publication had a ''profound'' effect on him.
''There's not a day goes by that I don't think about it. It varies
from bad to really bad to unbearable.''
The most damaging effect was on his two sons, now aged 10 and 14.
''They would come to my house and not talk about their life with their
mother, what holidays they were having or what car she drove.''
He said he felt ''trampled on'' by the newspaper which, the same day,
reported that his job was set to be taken by Liverpool colleague Steve
Heighway.
''They tried to destroy me as a human being. They tried to destroy me
professionally. On the same day in the same newspaper.''
Earlier, Mr Souness described how he tried to prevent the children
suffering after the marriage breakdown by providing them with a stable
home -- until Jordan was 18 -- at Norton Farm, Worplesdon, Surrey.
He bought it through a trust -- the CFJ Trust (Chantelle, Frazer and
Jordan) -- to benefit the children, but Danielle refused to sign a
tenancy agreement.
He said she refused to contribute towards the purchase price of the
house -- which he bought for several hundred thousand pounds and
renovated at a cost of #250,000 -- or pay #100 per month rent.
He said: ''I come from a wonderful family background. I wasn't happy
about my marriage breaking down but I wanted to do the best for my
children.''
After he met Karen and had triple heart by-pass surgery in 1992, he
became concerned about his financial future and Danielle was given 28
days notice to quit. But it was never enforced.
At the start of his cross-examination by George Carman, QC, for MGN
Ltd, which denies libel and says the story is true, Mr Souness said he
was ''extremely proud'' of being a good father and husband.
He denied telling Danielle that he was worth #8m.
The hearing continues.

<HEADLINE>Mother's fight for operation. Local hospital consultant denied request for 'joint surgery' treatment for breast cancer</HEADLINE>

A MOTHER had to travel more than 150 miles to have breast
reconstruction surgery when a consultant at her local hospital denied
her request for the treatment.
Trainee nurse Claire Brown, from Glenurquhart, near Inverness,
journeyed to Edinburgh for the joint mastectomy and rebuilding
operation, after asking for a referral to the specialist unit at the
Western General Hospital.
Speaking at the launch of the Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign
demanding more cash for research and funding into the disease which
claims 15,000 lives each year in the UK, Ms Brown, 32, urged women to
exercise their right for a second opinion.
The mother-of-two said her consultant at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness,
had just delivered the news she had cancer when he dealt the second
devastating blow -- that she could not have her breast rebuilt in the
same operation.
''His exact words were: 'Breast construction is not an option here,'
'' she said.
''He got very angry about it and said reconstruction was not all it's
cracked up to be and that the cosmetic results were not as good as you
think.
''He asked if I could think of reconstruction later and I told him
it's better to have it done at the time of mastectomy and to have it
done on the day.
''He said the cancer was the most important thing and told me that if
I were his wife he would tell me not to have reconstruction. He was not
about to offer reconstruction as an option. That's what made me so
angry,'' she said.
Ironically, Ms Brown's mother, Mrs Joyce Miles, also a nurse, had been
hit by the disease only months before her daughter's diagnosis. She also
demanded to be referred to the Western General Hospital where she
underwent similar surgery.
Ms Brown left her hospital bed to support the launch of the nationwide
campaign and urged people to send postcards to the Prime Minister
demanding more cash for treatment and research. The campaign has long
argued for equality of access to specialist units like that at the
Western, where reconstruction is routine for women of all ages.
Her surgeon, Mr Udi Chetty, senior lecturer at the Edinburgh Breast
Unit, backed the cash plea.
''From the perspective of someone who treats many patients, I cannot
over emphasise the need for more resources and more research to be done
in the treatment of breast cancer,'' he said.
SBCC chairman Mrs Audrey Jones slammed the breast cancer death rate as
''a national disgrace''. Mrs Jones, who was diagnosed as suffering from
the disease three years ago, set up the group last year and presented a
150,000-strong petition to Downing Street in February demanding more
research and funding for treatment.
The Government gives #3m each year for research into the disease, with
two-thirds of the total research costs borne by cancer charities, say
the group.
A spokesman for Raigmore NHS Trust said reconstructive surgery was not
carried out at Raigmore. ''The demand here has been very low,
historically, under two a year,'' he said.
But he denied there had been any opposition to patients being referred
to one of the centres specialising in reconstruction surgery.

<HEADLINE>Concern over pension funds 'began on Maxwell's death'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977994007</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE sudden death of publishing tycoon Mr Robert Maxwell caused ''huge
problems'' for his companies, a jury heard yesterday.
Pension funds manager Mr Trevor Cook told the Old Bailey it was only
after Mr Maxwell's death that he became concerned about a share deal.
Until then, he was not worried that the Robert Maxwell Group had not
paid the pension funds for #100m worth of shares in the Israeli company
Scitex.
Mr Cook said he had asked Mr Maxwell when the money was due for the
shares, which RMG was selling for Bishopsgate Investment Management
which managed the pension funds.
Less than a week before his mysterious death at sea, Mr Maxwell
assured him personally that the money was on the way. ''He seemed very
relaxed and it didn't occur to me there was a particular problem,'' said
Mr Cook.
He was in his third day of evidence in the trial of the tycoon's two
sons, Kevin and Ian, and former financial advisers Mr Robert Bunn and Mr
Larry Trachtenberg, who deny conspiracy to defraud.
Mr Cook rejected a suggestion by Mr Alun Jones, QC, for Mr Kevin
Maxwell, that he started to write memos about the missing money only
after Mr Robert Maxwell's death in November, 1991 -- when ''it looked as
if the group was in serious trouble and you got embarrassed by the fact
you agreed payment for those shares to be on an inter-company account,
and people might think if there was a crash that you had been seriously
incompetent in losing the pension funds' #100m''.
Mr Jones produced a variety of documents which appeared to show that
RMG had paid Bishopsgate for the shares by transferring money through
inter-company accounts.
But Mr Cook denied this had happened and said at the time of his
employer's death Bishopsgate was still owed all the money from the sale
of the shares.
He also denied altering documents relating to the history of the
shares deal but said records had been amended when new information, not
known earlier, came to light.
Mr Kevin Maxwell, 36, of Oxfordshire, denies conspiring with his
father to defraud the pension fund trustees and beneficiaries of the
proceeds of the Scitex shares sale by misusing the money to pay private
Maxwell company debts.
Along with his brother, Ian, 38, of Westminster, former group
accountant Mr Bunn, 47, of Hertfordshire, and ex-financial adviser Mr
Trachtenberg, 42, of Hampstead, he denies a similar charge of misusing
#22m worth of shares in the Israeli pharmaceutical company Teva in the
days after Mr Maxwell's death to try and save the crumbling business
empire from collapse.
Questioned by Mr Jones, Mr Cook agreed Mr Maxwell's death had caused
''huge problems'' for the group companies.
Asked why he had not gone to solicitors or resigned over the missing
money, Mr Cook said he did not think it would have been honourable or in
the best interests of the pensioners to hand in his resignation.
The trial was adjourned until today.

AN air service aimed at strengthening tourist links between Scotland
and Northern Ireland was launched yesterday.
Gill Airways is to offer three return flights a day and five at
weekends between Prestwick and Belfast City airports from the beginning
of next month and hopes to attract 50,000 passengers in the first year.
The news comes a week after the Ayrshire airport celebrated record
passenger figures showing it to be the fastest growing in the UK.
Prices will start at #58 return and rise to #98 full fare, with at
least half the seats available on each service at the lower price,
compared with a range of fares between #71 and #160 on the
Glasgow-Belfast City service operated by Manx under the British Airways
Express banner.
Mr Hugh Lang, managing director of airport operator PIK, yesterday
welcomed the new service and said that they were not out to ''steal''
business from Glasgow but to make air travel available to people who may
otherwise not consider it as an option.

A COMPANY director, attacked by a gang as he made a telephone call
from his #20,000 sports car, said yesterday: ''If I had been sitting in
a Mini, it wouldn't have happened.''
Mr Alan Jacoby, 39, was left in a pool of blood next to his red Lotus
Esprit after the thugs broke his arm in three places, knocked out three
teeth, and fractured his cheekbone.
The three attackers swooped as transport company chief Mr Jacoby was
using the telephone in his parked car at Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire.
''Suddenly there were faces at the car window and banging on the roof.
I looked up and there was a face peering through the glass sunroof,'' he
said. As he got out of the Lotus, one of the gang said: ''I don't like
your car.''
Mr Jacoby, of Wendover, Buckinghamshire, went on: ''I said that was
their problem and suddenly all three of them came at me.''
Recovering at home, he said he was convinced he would not have been
attacked if he had not been in an expensive car.
Police have appealed for witnesses. One man has been bailed in
connection with the incident and another is helping police with
inquiries.

DESPITE their horrific experiences following their ''outing'' in the
forces, three of the four applicants in the case were fighting to get
their jobs back.
* Jeanette Smith from Edinburgh was hugely upset by the decision.
''Naturally it is a disappointment, but it does not stop here.'' she
said after the judgment.
Having joined the Royal Air Force on April 9, 1989, on a nine-year
engagement as an enrolled nurse, she began living in private rented
accommodation with a civilian female partner early in 1993.
The following year, she returned from a holiday in Florida with her
partner to discover that she had been ''outed'' as a lesbian. She went
AWOL for two days to speak to her family and, during which time, she
took legal advice.
When she did report for duty she was aggressively interrogated for
long periods, as was her civilian partner. Both were asked if they
sexually interfered with their teenage foster daughter. Ms Smith, who
was discharged with effect from November 25 last year, wants to resume
her military career.
''All I have ever wanted was to do the job I loved, and am good at,''
she said. ''My partner and I have been under enormous pressure since my
discharge. All we want is to return to our lives. The ban is both stupid
and unfair.''
* Graeme Grady joined the RAF on August 12, 1980, on a 30-year
engagement as an administrative clerk. He was promoted to sergeant in
1990. Four years later he, too, was reported over his homosexuality and
eventually discharged with effect from November 16, last year. He is the
only one of the four who does not want to return to service life. He was
seeking compensation.
* John Beckett joined the Royal Navy at the age of 18 on February 20,
1989, enlisting for 22 years. He only recognised that he was a
homosexual after becoming a sailor. In 1992, he formed a relationship
with a civilian male partner. In May 1993, he told a chaplain that he
was homosexual and was advised to inform his divisional officer. The
following month, he was told he was being discharged. His appeal was
turned down by the Admiralty Board on December 6, last year.
* Duncan Lustig-Pream joined the Royal Navy in 1979, as a radio
operator on a 30-year engagment. By 1992, he had attained the rank of
Lieutenant Commander. He was discharged by the Admiralty Board with
effect from January 17 this year, when it became aware of his
homosexuality.
In his judgment, Lord Justice Simon Brown declared: ''All four
applicants had exemplary service records.
''The sexual orientation of two or three of them had been known to, or
suspected by, their colleagues without it making the least diffrence to
their working relationships.''
He added: ''There is no reason to doubt that, but for their discharge
on the sole ground of sexual orientation, each would have continued to
perform their service duties entirely efficiently, and with the
continued support of their colleagues.''

near Lanark. The men were inspecting a weir for debris when they spotted
Mr Wallace in the water.  He was semi-conscious and they managed to frag
him ashore. He was later released from hospital after treatment.

THE BBC has been forced to stop work on a #4m television mini-series
in Colombia after the film crew cut down trees in a coastal national
park. The Environment Ministry said it had ordered the BBC and Italy's
RAI network to stop filming part of the series until they had presented
a plan to replace nearly 2300sq ft of trees in a botanical garden near
the port of Cartagena.
The producers claimed the trees were cut down without their knowledge
to hide some cables during the shooting of a scene. Colombia's
prosecutor-general's office was reported to be investigating possible
charges. Albert Finney and Claudia Cardinale are starring in the
four-part series based on Joseph Conrad's Nostromo.

AUTOPSIES are likely to be carried out today on the bodies of the two
Aberdeen District Council officials who died in a weekend swimming
tragedy in the former Soviet state of Belarus.
Both bodies have now been recovered from the River Sorg, where it is
believed deputy council chief executive Ann Hughes, 44, and principal
environmental health officer Iain McDonald, 36, were dragged into a
boat's propellers while on a picnic with their hosts.
They were part of a group of 41 who flew to Gomel, Aberdeen's twin
city, last week. Miss Hughes and Mr McDonald were in a team working on
an environmental project to help Gomel.
The two other members of the team, Councillor Margaret Smith, who
formally identified the bodies, and Ms Aileen McDiarmid, senior
environmental health officer, were due back in Aberdeen last night.
A Foreign Office spokesman said that a consul was driving from Minsk
to Gomel today and would be meeting the council's international officer,
Ms Alison Cameron, who has flown to the scene. She is a fluent Russian
speaker.
Miss Hughes and Mr McDonald and other members of the party were
enjoying a riverside picnic when they went for a swim to cool off in the
heat.
It appears they were dragged under a passing vessel and it was some
time before it was realised they were missing.

<HEADLINE>SNP gains 5% from Tories and Lib Dems.  By-election win boosts support in poll</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish National Party has leapt up five percentage points in the
latest System Three opinion poll for The Herald on the back of its Perth
and Kinross by-election win.
Its gains, however, have made no impact on Labour's support which is
still over 50%.
The two parties to suffer are the Conservatives and the Liberal
Democrats who fall back after showing gains in the previous month's
poll.
Although a 5% gain would be significant in any poll, the fact that the
data was gathered in the days immediately after the Perth and Kinross
by-election may make it difficult for the SNP to sustain the level in
future polls.
Nevertheless, SNP leader Alex Salmond said the 27% figure represented
a substantial surge forward for the party. ''It is our highest poll
rating for seven months and these figures give the SNP a strong platform
from which to build a further advance through the summer,'' he said.
He argued that the rest of Scotland had taken note of events in Perth
and Kinross and that the SNP's positive message of decent social and
economic values was one which had strong appeal the length and breadth
of the country.
Naturally Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative
Party, which dipped two points in The Herald poll, saw things
differently, pointing out that parties often gained a short-lived
increase after by-election wins.
''The SNP would do well to look back in history and remember that much
of their fair-weather support has not stayed with the party at a General
Election,'' he countered.
''As we saw at the by-election, the polls were significantly
inaccurate. We shall go on consulting and listening to the electorate
and we will continue to promote our message and achievements,'' he
added.
Labour, at 53%, is doing remarkably well in a four-party split. Its
officials are cautioning party supporters against complacency creeping
in, and will keep up the political pressure on the Government with a
number of campaigns over the summer, including opposing rail
privatisation.
Such campaigns not only keep the party activists interested but it is
an attempt to show the electorate that Labour is not taking them for
granted.
The assistant general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party, Mr Tommy
Sheppard, commented: ''I think this poll shows the continual hunger of
the Scottish people to get rid of the Tories and replace them with a
Labour Government.''
The poll is a disappointment for the Scottish Liberal Democrats who
had hoped to remain at least in double figures. Chief executive Mr Andy
Myles said the poll reflected the amount of coverage the parties were
given at the Perth and Kinross by-election rather than what they
acutally achieved at the ballot box.
He pointed out that in the by-election, the Lib Dems increased their
percentage vote despite a huge attempt by the other parties to squeeze
their vote.
''I am quite certain that once again the opinion polls are
underestimating our real position and strength,'' he added.

<TEXT>
RAIL union leaders have claimed a victory after management backed down
on plans to introduce new rest day rules at Glasgow's Queen Street
station.
The U-turn follows a ballot of 130 Aslef members which overwhelmingly
supported a series of 24-hour strikes.
Mr Pat O'Connor, Scottish secretary of the train drivers' union, said:
''Management has done a complete U-turn. They've withdrawn the
imposition of new rules and said the situation will now be monitored for
six months.
''I was totally surprised but glad at their decision to back down.
They tried to threaten us and take us to the brink before deciding to do
anything about this.
''They could have saved an awful lot of bother if they had listened to
us in the first place.''
The dispute centred on claims that rail managers failed to follow
proper procedure when introducing new rest day rules. The union was not
strictly opposed to the roster change but said it was an attempt to
antagonise staff.
A spokeswoman for ScotRail said the dispute was an internal issue. She
added: ''It is not a victory for anyone. The union wants to reinforce
the idea that there are sides in this but we believe everyone is on the
same side.''

AN internal ScotRail survey of staff opinions has revealed how unhappy
workers are with their bosses, The Herald has discovered.
Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary, Mr Henry McLeish, challenged the
Secretary of State for Transport, Dr Brian Mawhinney, to read the survey
results and abandon privatisation plans.
Union leaders claimed the poor results of the survey -- conducted
among a quarter of ScotRail staff -- have ''backfired'' on management.
The findings show:
* Two thirds of those questioned felt ScotRail did not care about
them.
* In general, staff found management ''uncaring, inflexible, and
discipline-led''.
* Three quarters said they were ill-informed, adding that staff did
not trust their bosses, who were described as ''not very good
listeners''.
*Almost 90% wanted more information from their managers. A total of
86% said management only communicated with them when it had done
something wrong.
Mr McLeish said: ''This should be sent to the Secretary of State
because he doesn't understand what is happening to the industry. There
is a real crisis, and that is the crisis that has been brought on by
privatisation.
''Morale is at rock bottom, there is no new investment, and major cuts
to services are being planned. The Government should start to solve
these problems by scrapping privatisation. At the same time, management
should try to recreate some enthusiasm among the workforce''.
Mr Pat O'Connor, Scottish secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef,
said: ''It looks as though this survey has backfired on management
which, no doubt, wanted to show the workforce was content. I'm sure it
tried to bury this because it did not like what it found out.
''It doesn't surprise me though, because staff are so unhappy it's
unbelievable. They feel that they can't come to work without facing some
sort of confrontation with management.''
However, a spokeswoman for ScotRail denied that the findings -- which
had been intended for internal use only -- were embarrassing, and said
managers were determined to learn from the results.
She added: ''The results are not a huge surprise and we are working
positively to address the concerns that have arisen. We wanted honest
answers, and this will not be swept under the carpet. I am confident we
can turn the situation around.''

Judges describe ''ghost'' services through Cowlairs junction as an
absurdity.
THE immediate future of the West Highland sleeper, which has survived
for 94 years, was assured yesterday as British Rail suffered another
comprehensive defeat in the courts over its attempts to axe the service.
Scotland's senior judge said it would be ''absurd'' to describe BR's
substitute service -- ''ghost'' trains in Strathclyde which are of no
conceivable benefit to travellers -- as genuine rail passenger services.
Lord Hope, the Lord President, emphasised the right of passengers to
be consulted over the closure of passenger services and declared that
Parliament could not have intended that these important rights could be
defeated by the ghost train ''device''.
Lord Hope, sitting with Lords Allanbridge and Osborne in the Court of
Session, rejected an appeal by BR against last month's decision by Lord
Kirkwood which banned BR from withdrawing the Fort William to London
Euston sleeper until full public consultation had taken place.
The challenge against the closure decision was made by Highland
Regional Council.
Lord Hope said yesterday that BR had a duty to balance its books and
had been told towards the end of 1994 that its funding was to be cut.
The decision was taken to save money on the sleeper service (which BR
says loses #2.5m a year).
What was of concern to the court was the means by which BR chose to
put that decision into effect.
The 1993 Railways Act provided that any proposal to close all
passenger services on a line should be advertised so that objections
could be lodged and public hearings take place. In the meantime the
service would continue.
Lord Hope said: ''The procedure is likely to be both time-consuming
and expensive in the present case. The (British Railways) board have
made no secret of the fact that their intention has been to avoid the
need to initiate the closure procedure in giving effect to their
decision to discontinue the sleeper service to Fort William.''
The sleeper was the only service which used three short stretches of
line at Cowlairs junction near Glasgow and at Cumbernauld and BR had
announced three late night one-way services on these lines -- a 23.58
between Maryhill and Bishopbriggs, a 23.48 between Cumbernauld and
Glasgow Queen Street and a diversion of the 20.05 Inverness to Glasgow
train via Cumbernauld.
BR argued that since these substitute services were scheduled services
listed in the timetable and equipped to carry passengers they were
''railway passenger services''. There was therefore no proposal to close
the service and no need for public consultation.
It was of no importance that the only reason for introducing the
''ghost'' services was to avoid the closure procedure over the plan to
withdraw the Fort William sleeper.
However, Lord Hope said that BR's approach led to an absurdity and
failed to give effect to the true intention of Parliament.
''In all cases where the closure is likely to affect the passengers
who use these services the intention of Parliament plainly is that users
and anybody representing the users should have an opportunity of being
heard before the proposed closure is put into effect.
''We agree with Lord Kirkwood that it is difficult to believe that
Parliament could have intended that these procedures could be defeated
by the provision of a service for the carriage of passengers on that
line which is admitted to be of no benefit to the travelling public.
''Such a service would be nothing more than a device, as its sole
purpose would be to obviate the closure procedures, not to provide a
service for the use of passengers.
''The facts point clearly to the conclusion that they (the substitute
services) are a device, and not services intended to serve the interests
of passengers.
''The absurdity of the arrangement is transparent in the case of the
23.48 train from Cumbernauld to Glasgow Queen Street. This train now has
to divert from its ordinary route on to a section of line to a point
from where it has to reverse into Queen Street.'' BR admitted that this
service provided no conceivable benefit to the public.
Lord Hope continued: ''We agree with Lord Kirkwood that the board were
acting outwith their powers in their decision to withdraw the Fort
William sleeper service, because the effect of the decision was to
discontinue all passenger services on these three sections of line
without bringing into operation the closure procedures.''
The judges also refused to alter the ban pronounced by Lord Kirkwood.
Lord Hope said: ''The justification for it lies in the board's
conduct, which was to resort to a device to avoid the need to initiate
the closure procedure. In our opinion it is appropriate that they should
be interdicted from taking some other step of this kind.''

THE Scottish bishop who last month denied that he condoned adultery,
insisting that his views had been misinterpreted, last night appeared to
align himself with the attitude of a Church of England report on couples
living together.
The Most Rev Richard Holloway, Bishop of Edinburgh and Primus of the
Scottish Episcopal Church, was speaking in the last of four lectures on
sex and marriage -- only 24 hours after it was announced that a Church
of England report suggested couples living together without marrying
should not in future be regarded as living in sin.
Speaking at the parish church of St Cuthbert in Edinburgh, Bishop
Holloway's address was warmly accepted by an audience of about 100.
He told them: ''While there are many things to give us pause, the
picture is not necessarily as dire or as straightforward as some
commentators would have us believe.
''It doesn't strike me as particularly helpful to denigrate
single-parent families as if they were a recent invention, or were
particularly prone to social disintegration.
''The evidence would suggest that they can be as good as some
marriages, better than some, and worse than some, just as some marriages
are good.
The bishop went on to say that, when all concessions and explanations
had been made on the subject, the Christian community was in the
business of helping people relate wisely and kindly to one another.

SCREAMING Lord Sutch's political career was saved last night when
Barclays Bank decided against declaring him bankrupt.
Sutch, 54, could no longer have stood for Parliament if the bank had
pressed for bankruptcy over a #194,000 debt.
The eccentric pop singer has reached terms for gradual repayment of
the loan, and can now contest next month's by-election at Littleborough
and Saddleworth, Greater Manchester.
Sutch, who has been standing for Parliament with his Monster Raving
Loony Party since 1963, said: ''I was terrified at the thought of
bankruptcy. I haven't been sleeping with the worry of this.
''All I could see was #194,000 going through my mind and how I was
going to get the money.''
Barclays confirmed: ''We have come to a mutually beneficial agreement
concerning the oustanding monies.''
The debt was for a #120,000 bridging loan plus interest which
Britain's longest-serving party leader took out to buy a house at
Hastings several years ago.
He said: ''I'll do some pop gigs to pay it back. The main thing is it
has all been ironed out, thanks to my solicitor, and I have been given
time to pay.
''The bank had it in their power to make me bankrupt and they have
declined to do that -- they have been kind to me, I must admit.''
Sutch has lost thousands of pounds in deposits forfeited during
election campaigns. He has fought about 40 elections in 32 years.
The by-election at Littleborough and Saddleworth is caused by the
death of Tory MP Mr Geoffrey Dickens.

DOCTORS are turning their backs on general practice at a time when
more and more NHS work is being directed there, a Scots GP warned
yesterday.
Dr Brian Keighley said that 30 of this year's 155 training posts for
GPs in the West of Scotland were lying vacant, while courses in Stirling
and Falkirk had been amalgamated because of lack of numbers.
Dr Keighley, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association's
Scottish GPs' committee, delivered his warning as the BMA prepared to
announce the result today of a ballot which is expected to reject the
Government's offer over out-of-hours service.
The West of Scotland region trains half the country's GPs and Dr
Keighley, who practises in Balfron, said the shortfall was the harbinger
of a growing crisis in GP numbers throughout the UK. Doctors are
supposed to follow two years in hospital posts with a third year
training in an accredited training practice if they wish to become GP
principals.
''It appears that they are just marking time in hospitals instead --
people are not leaping into general practice because of the impression
that GPs are swamped by paperwork, have lost control of their own
destiny, and are having to become almost managers, which is not perhaps
what they want to do.''
Another disincentive, he said, was the loss of premium for
out-of-hours working, which could mean a drop of #7000 to #8000 in
salary when a doctor left hospital to train in general practice.
All this was happening against a tremendous shift of work from the
hospital service to primary care, with more and more responsibilities
being passed on to GPs -- hospitalisation-at-home, early discharge,
day-case surgery, and community care leaving more and more work for GPs
to mop up.
''The money is not following the patient into the community in the way
that was promised,'' said Dr Keighley, who pointed out that care in the
community often simply meant transfer to a private geriatric home with
the GP providing medical care.

ABERDEEN University has applied for planning permission to turn part
of historic Marischal College, the second largest granite building in
the world, into a #14m hotel.
The application for change of use for the city centre landmark,
recognised world-wide as a symbol of Aberdeen, has been made jointly by
the university and Scandic Hotels (UK) Ltd, and is for a 194-bedroom
development. It was revealed a year ago that the two were in
negotiations.
Yesterday, the university said ownership of the property would be
retained and stressed that Marischal College was not for sale.
The historic Mitchell Hall, picture gallery, museum, debater, and all
the space in the Mitchell Wing would be retained by the university,
which says it is possible that the wing could be refurbished and
enhanced.
''The university has emphasised its wish to see Marischal used for the
benefit of the city and the university for now and the future,'' a
spokesman said. ''Scandic has stated its clear intention to provide a
quality hotel in the city centre which will provide additional bedspaces
and facilities at the top end of the market.
''Private and public consultation exercises are now planned to
articulate the benefits of the proposed development and fully address
issues of possible concern.''
Scandic is Northern Europe's leading hotel group, with more than 4400
employees and a turnover of #270m in 1994. It has 170 hotels in 12
countries, including four in the UK.
Marischal College was opened in 1906 on the site of the original
college and university founded in 1593. It is second in size to Seville
Cathedral, and is a Grade A listed building.
The initial announcement that part of it might be turned into a hotel
was met with mixed reaction throughout Aberdeen, with one of the major
concerns being that there might be alterations to the facade of the
building.

A GLASGOW-based housing expert has spoken out in favour of
privately-funded local housing companies being allowed to buy up
Scottish council housing.
Professor Duncan Maclennan gave his controversial views to The Herald
yesterday, on what is increasingly believed to be the Government's
latest ''big idea'' on housing.
Speculation emanating from Whitehall this week has suggested that a
forthcoming housing White Paper will propose privatising large public
sector housing estates in England and Wales by the use of such local
companies.
But the Scottish Office said yesterday that the paper did not cover
Scotland, and there were no plans for similar moves north of the Border.
It is felt in housing circles that St Andrews House prefers to
''batten down the hatches'', and not provoke further confrontation with
local authority leaders in advance of the next General Election.
There is also believed to be more support in the Scottish Office than
in the Department of the Environment, not least from Housing Minister
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, for housing associations and co-operatives
being seen as the best recipients for former public sector properties.
But Professor Maclennan, who heads the Centre for Housing Research and
Urban Studies at Glasgow University, and is a member of the board of
Scottish Homes, warned that Scottish housing authorities would do
themselves and their tenants a disservice if they rejected the idea of
local housing companies out of hand.
He believed they were ''an excellent model for providing
locally-managed housing involving tenants, councillors, and others,
while at the same time having access to investment funding''.
On a practical level, if they were adopted widely in England,
Government resources for housing could fall, with Scotland suffering
proportionately. No-one now expected a Labour Government to vastly
increase resources for public sector housing.
Professor Maclellan said that, under the law as it stood, there was
nothing to prevent private local housing companies from being set up in
Scotland.
The nearest thing would be an organisation like Weslo Housing
Management, which took over 1700 former Scottish Homes houses in West
Lothian last year. Weslo is a charitable company which ploughs its
profits back into its housing stock.
Professor Maclennan said it was not yet clear exactly what the
Government's preferred model for local housing companies would be. But
it was a critical factor that their borrowing would not add to the
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement.
He went on: ''It would be unlikely that companies drawn solely from
the private sector would be widely acceptable to councils in Scotland.''
Professor Maclennan will be raising the issue of local housing
companies when he addresses the annual conference of the Scottish
Federation of Housing Associations, in Perth, later this month.

<TEXT>
AN OFFICIAL report into the swindling of more than #5m of police money
by Scotland Yard accountant Anthony Williams lists a catalogue of
weaknesses in accounting procedures.
The National Audit Office found that ''at the core of the fraud were
failures by the Metropolitan Police service to observe the requirements
of good financial practice''.
The review claimed there was still a need to reduce the risk of fraud
and improve financial procedures almost one year after Williams was
caught. Williams, who was jailed for seven years last month, was in
charge of a special operations fund.
He virtually had a blank cheque to fund various secret operations and
was given total control to ensure the operations had complete
confidentiality.
But instead, he wrote out huge cheques to himself, bought himself a
title, and set up a double life in Tomintoul.
The National Audit Office report said police claimed ''indirectly
funded'' operations, like the ones which Williams headed, had in the
past five years scored many major successes.
But the report is critical of the lack of controls on the fund used by
Williams.
* He had ''unsupervised control over the bank account and his
signature alone was sufficient for issuing cheques''.
* He was the sole link between operational and finance branches with
sole responsibility for estimating, monitoring, and accounting for
funds.
* He was never asked to give detailed supporting evidence of the funds
he claimed he needed.
* There was no independent check of his invoice records.
* Williams submitted no year-end reports or accounts to senior
officers.
The NAO said Scotland Yard ''has accepted the recommendations of the
review and is ensuring they are fully implemented''.

TWELVE Greenpeace activists are expected to appear in court today
following renewed efforts by environmentalists to prevent Shell from
dumping the redundant Brent Spar installation in deep water in the
Atlantic.
A twin-pronged attack on Shell's plans came from Greenpeace as
preparations were completed for today's North Sea Environmental
Ministers Conference in the Danish city of Esbjerg at which the
ecological future of the area will be debated.
Five protesters from the vessel Moby Dick boarded the Brent Spar 118
miles north-east of Aberdeen without permission in the early hours
yesterday by climbing an anchor chain to reach a closed-off lower
walkway. They remained on board for more than seven hours.
Despite being sprayed by high-powered water cannon from the Shell
standby vessel Rembras, the protesters managed to hang banners and paint
slogans on the Brent Spar's side.
Onshore, 12 activists staged a protest in Aberdeen harbour on the tug
Smit Singapore, one of the vessels understood to have been contracted to
tow the Brent Spar to its deep-water grave.
Several people chained themselves to the ship's mooring ropes at 11pm
on Tuesday while others scaled a forward mast. Two Greenpeace divers
also entered the water in an apparent attempt to foul the Smit
Singapore's propellers.
During the night, 10 were taken into custody.
Greenpeace forced the dumping issue to the top of today's conference
agenda with its successful publicity coup in occupying Brent Spar for
three weeks last month.
The British Government is expected to come under pressure from other
North Sea states to change its stance on dumping..

HEARTS bosses Mr Chris Robinson and Mr Leslie Deans are suing former
chairman Mr Wallace Mercer for #1.2m and have taken steps to freeze his
remaining 25% shareholding in the club.
Mr Robinson and Mr Deans, who bought a controlling shareholding in
Hearts from Cosmopolitan Investments last summer, said in a joint
statement: ''We have lodged a claim against Cosmopolitan Investments Ltd
-- the company owned by Wallace Mercer -- which sold his controlling
interest in Heart of Midlothian Football Club last year.
''The claim is for a total of #1,169,962 and arises out of certain
warranties given by Cosmopolitan at the time of sale which, in our view,
have been breached.
''To assist our recovery of the sum claimed, we have also, on advice,
taken certain steps to freeze Cosmopolitan's remaining shareholding in
Heart of Midlothian Football Club.
''Mr Mercer was advised by us on January 19, 1995, that a warranty
claim would be made. This action has no relevance or significance
whatsoever to other recent events involving Heart of Midlothian Football
Club.''
Mr Mercer issued a brief statement from his base in the South of
France last night. He said: ''Cosmopolitan Ltd intend to vigorously
defend the action taken by New Hearts Ltd.
''Cosmopolitan Ltd dispute being formally advised in January of any
action and intend issuing a much fuller statement tomorrow, by which
time I will be in Edinburgh.''

GAS industry regulator Ms Clare Spottiswoode is facing Labour fury
after reportedly receiving a #20,000 pay rise.
The Department of Trade and Industry last night refused to confirm or
deny a claim that the Ofgas director-general had won a partial victory
in her battle with Board of Trade President Michael Heseltine for a
large pay rise.
It said it would be making an announcement in a Commons written answer
within days.
But it was reported that Ms Spottiswoode's salary would rise from
#70,000 to #90,000 a year -- slightly less than the #110,000, or 65%
extra, she was said to have wanted.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, said the near
30% rise would be astonishing.
''There will be a storm in Parliament over it and I am tabling
questions in the House of Commons asking what can be done to ensure the
salaries of regulators are subject to parliamentary scrutiny,'' he said.
Labour has already criticised what it called the ''rush to the
trough'', and questioned how a regulator who asked for such a pay rise
could effectively oversee British Gas, which had itself awarded its
chief executive, Mr Cedric Brown, a 75% rise.
Ofgas said Ms Spottiswoode's workload had expanded significantly and
it was appropriate to look at changing the terms of her contract to
bring her salary more into line with that of other regulators.
Sources pointed to other utility regulators being paid
''#100,000-plus-a-year''.
No pay details for the watchdogs of water, gas, electricity, Telecom,
and rail are published by the Government -- despite their salaries being
funded by the taxpayer.
Ms Spottiswoode now faces the prospect of a grilling by the Commons
Trade and Industry Committee about her salary when she appears before
them next month.

<TEXT>
A PROJECT aimed at drivers aged between 17 and 25 was launched
yesterday by Strathclyde Police in a bid to change the behaviour of 12%
of the driving population who are involved in 37% of road accidents.
Strathclyde's chief constable, Mr Leslie Sharp, said: ''Our target is
young people, male and female, who have passed their test and are using
vehicles which are in good nick, usually their parents' vehicles.''
''They represent 12% of the driving population yet 37% are reflected
in accident statistics,'' he said.
''Young people of that age-group have certain temptations. There is
the euphoria of passing the test which makes them show off. This
initiative is aimed at that young driver to try and put an older head on
younger shoulders in the driving context,'' added Mr Sharp.
The project was a good example of the corporate approach, with the
video accompanying the initiative funded by Strathclyde region's roads
department, said Mr Sharp.
However, he warned: ''When the regional council is abolished on April
1 next year, we are going to have to deal with 12 road safety
committees. It will not be easy to stimulate a campaign like this.''
In 1994, 17 to 25-year-old drivers were involved in 48 fatal
accidents, 701 serious injury accidents, and 2134 slight injury
accidents in Strathclyde.

<RECORDNO>977994041</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Prince of Wales is this year likely to face a #1m income tax bill,
based on figures published yesterday.
The Prince's 1994 income from the Duchy of Cornwall totals an
estimated #3.5m after tax. He spends #2m of that on official expenses
and #1.5m on private expenditure.
Dividend income from his #2m Stock Exchange portfolio would have
netted up to an additional #50,000.
In 1994, the Prince received #4,467,254 from the Duchy of Cornwall,
which provides income for the Prince and his estranged wife, the
Princess of Wales -- a 9.4% rise on the previous year.
Duchy income for 1994 totalled #11,395,128. After accounting for
operating costs, #2.5m on repairs or environmental improvements, and
loan interest, a #4.5m surplus was paid to the Prince as Duke of
Cornwall.
''The surplus was up #385,000 in 1994 largely due to a better return
from the duchy's policy of improving the quality of its assets and to
internal efficiency,'' said a duchy spokesman.
As a Crown body, the duchy is tax-exempt. Duchy income passed to the
Prince is, therefore, also tax-exempt.
However, the Prince volunteers to pay income tax, which is currently
at 40%.
Tax on the Prince's #4.5m duchy income is calculated, as with other
taxpayers, after deducting his and the Princess's business expenditure.
The Prince paid income tax on his duchy income for the first time last
year, mirroring the Queen's decision to pay tax. The undisclosed bill
was thought to be close to #1m.
The Prince, who receives no Civil List payment, does not own the Duchy
of Cornwall. Nor does he own Highgrove House, near Tetbury, which he
rents from the duchy.
As first-born male heir to the throne, he is automatically Duke of
Cornwall and effectively holds duchy estate in trust, being entitled to
the income.
The duchy, dating from 1337, consists of 130,000 acres in 23 counties,
although mainly in South-west England (70,000 acres on Dartmoor), plus
commercial properties (shops and offices), and blue-chip stocks and
shares.

<TEXT>
A GYNAECOLOGIST was found guilty yesterday of professional misconduct
and ordered to be struck off for making bogus claims about a wonder
pregnancy treatment.
Mr Malcolm Pearce, 45, a senior consultant at St George's Hospital,
Tooting, south London, told a series of lies about a ''world-first''
operation, the General Medical Council heard.
He ''manufactured'' information after claiming in the British Journal
of Obstetrics and Gynaecology to have relocated an ectopic pregnancy --
an embryo developing outside the womb -- for a 29-year-old African
woman.
The article claimed that the operation resulted in the live birth of a
healthy girl at 38 weeks.
Mr Pearce, who was not at yesterday's hearing, earlier told a GMC
committee of inquiry that he had searched through his files to find the
identity of the woman to back up his article.
But when he failed to find her, he ''made up'' a patient -- and when
this failed he invented another, who would have been 84 when the
operation was performed.
Mr Pearce maintained he had performed the operation but could not
remember who had helped him.
Mr Pearce was found guilty of making false claims about the relocation
of an ectopic pregnancy and of making false claims about a controlled
trial on 191 women with recurrent miscarriage and polycystic ovary
syndrome.
The GMC's professional conduct committee found Mr Pearce, of Tooting
Bec, guilty of serious professional misconduct and ordered that his name
be removed from the register with immediate effect. He has 28 days to
appeal.
Announcing the decision, committee chairman and council president Sir
Robert Kilpatrick said Mr Pearce had been found guilty of a scientific
fraud which involved the deliberate inclusion of false or misleading
data in medical research papers.
This was dishonest and could not be tolerated by the profession.
He said: ''Scientific fraud is dangerous. Medical knowledge,
worldwide, is developed in part on the published results of previous
research work.''
Future research could be jeopardised when researchers -- in good faith
-- followed the techniques or treatments described in published papers
which turned out to be fraudulent.

LOCAL authority education chiefs and the main teachers' union will
campaign to reverse Government cuts in school funding, which they say is
now at crisis point.
Education managers and the teachers' unions are frequently at
loggerheads over pay and conditions but they are in harmony over the
battle to reverse underfunding of the service.
Mr John Dobie, president of the Association of Directors of Education
in Scotland (Ades), said yesterday: ''We are united on this. We think we
are at the absolute limit in terms of funding. Jobs are going and more
will go if the teachers' pay settlement for next year is not funded by
the Government.''
The Government is making noises about any teachers' pay rise for
1996-97 being funded by efficiency savings, taken to mean redundancies.
An emergency motion has now been drafted for the Educational Institute
of Scotland's annual conference which begins in Perth today. It calls
for a campaign to reverse budget cuts.
It will include mobilising the public, researching the impact of
underfunding on services, and pressing the case for properly funded
salary increases and better conditions.
EIS general secretary Mr Ronnie Smith said: ''The motion and several
others which are related to underfunding reflect a growing concern
across the EIS membership.''
A survey by Ades shows the local authority education service in
Scotland will have to bear budgetary reductions totalling more than #43m
in the current financial year.
According to detailed returns from eight regional authorities and one
island council, the cuts will result in the loss of the equivalent of an
estimated 622 full-time teaching and non-teaching jobs.
The association is awaiting returns from the Western Isles, Fife, and
Shetland but the data shows that the total budget for the remaining nine
councils -- #2276.5m -- has suffered an average cut of 2%.
Mr Dobie said budget cuts could lead to bigger classes, a concern
shared by the EIS, which represents eight out of 10 teachers.
Delegates are expected to support a call for class size upper limits
to be scrapped. Teachers fear the mechanism could be used to increase
class sizes and cut expenditure by reducing the need for the present
number of posts.
When class size limits of 33 pupils in the primary and 30 in the
secondary sector were introduced about 20 years ago, upper limits of 39
up to second year in secondary schools and 34 beyond were also brought
in to allow for adjustments during the transition period.
Although no teacher could take a bigger class without the request
going for adjudication before a panel, the EIS is worried about the
budgetary implications of the upper limits remaining in place.
Underfunding is also reflected in a motion which, if passed, would
give EIS officials a mandate to speak to the Scottish Office about
becoming involved in the Higher Still reform in secondary schools.
EIS members are currently advised not to take part in the development
as part of the union's campaign to reduce workload but it could become
involved if more resources were available, and if the timetable for
implementation were extended.

AN MP last night demanded a Scottish Office inquiry into a deal
between Irvine Development Corporation and a local housing association.
Mr Brian Donohoe, Labour MP for Cunninghame South, wants the inquiry
to look at how Irvine Housing Association has acquired 160 properties
for #1.5m, an average of #9000 per house.
The corporation said the agreement was ''completely above board'' and
a senior housing association official said the houses would not
otherwise have been available at affordable rents to local people.
Mr Donohoe said: ''There must be an urgent investigation into this
deal which has seen a number of newly built properties transferred to
Irvine Housing Association at bargain basement prices.''
He added: ''There is no way that homes built less than 12 months ago
should be sold for just #9000, especially when they could fetch four or
five times that on the open market.''
Mr Donohoe said the housing association has had financial support from
IDC.
Mr Joe Smith, senior officer of Irvine Housing Association, said it
has agreed to buy 769 empty houses over the next year. ''The agreement,
which was ratified by the Scottish Office and is strictly controlled by
Government guidelines, is taking place to ensure that the houses will
remain within the rented sector in perpetuity.''
He said a sale on the open market would have meant a greater value,
but then they would not have been available for letting at affordable
rents. He said an independent valuer set the price of the first 160
houses.
Mr Jack Murdoch, managing director of the corporation, said: ''There
is nothing untoward in this arrangement which is fully in line with laid
down guidance from the Scottish Office for the disposal of housing
before wind-up.''
The corporation is to be wound up early in 1997.

<TEXT>
TEACHERS are becoming increasingly worried about being disciplined for
restraining rowdy pupils in mainstream education and special school
pupils who need protection during epileptic fits and other incidents.
The leadership of the Educational Institute of Scotland will be asked
this week to produce guidelines for teachers who must restrain certain
pupils.
Teachers are concerned about being accused of assaulting or abusing
pupils they restrain. In special schools, teachers are looking for
guidance about how far they can go to protect themselves when pupils
lash out and about pupils who need to be restrained.
But the issue is not confined to special education. Mr Danny McDonald,
a Dundee teacher who is also a member of the EIS national executive,
said that last year five Tayside teachers were accused of assaulting
rowdy pupils they had restrained. The teachers were later cleared.
Mr McDonald said: ''The area of restraint is a minefield. Teachers
want clear procedures. In some circumstances, a pupil could be injured
if a teacher does not use some form of restraint to keep the situation
under control.
''But they could face allegations of abuse and accusations of assault
from pupils, and that could lead to teachers being suspended. We need
the protection of guidelines.''

IN a landmark judgment, a senior High Court judge yesterday declared
that it was perfectly legal for the Ministry of Defence unilaterally to
ban homosexuals and lesbians from serving in the armed forces.
However, almost in the same breath Lord Justice Simon Brown made it
clear that the MoD had lost its argument in court.
He reluctantly conceded that a change in the law on this issue was a
matter for Parliament and not the courts, but he urged MPs to review the
policy -- which he had no doubt was discriminatory -- as a matter of
urgency.
''The tide of history is against the Ministry,'' the judge declared in
a remarkable and controversial judgment which ran to 45 pages.
''Prejudices are breaking down. Old barriers are being removed,'' he
continued. ''It seems to me improbable, whatever this court may say,
that the existing policy can survive for much longer.
''I doubt whether most of those present in court throughout the
proceedings now believe otherwise.''
Under the policy, Lawrence of Arabia would not be welcome in today's
armed forces, the judge observed.
Mr Justice Curtis, while agreeing that the challenge had to fail,
disagreed with the tenor of his more senior colleague's judgment.
''I do not hold the opinion that the balance of the argument lies with
the applicants or that the decision of the armed forces is doomed to die
an early death, or is necessarily wrong,'' he said.
However, he too urged Parliament to look at the policy afresh.
The four applicants -- a lesbian, from Edinburgh, and three male
homosexuals, who were all discharged from their services under the
policy -- will appeal.
Their legal teams had argued that the MoD veto was ''outrageous,
irrational, and perverse''.
''This battleship of bigotry is now holed under the waterline and is
sinking,'' said Mr Duncan Lustig-Pream, the most senior of the four and
a former Lieutenant-Commander, after hearing the judgment.
In dismissing the case, the judges said that the applicants could not
rely on the Eureopean Convention on Human Rights and that there had been
no contravention of either European and domestic law.
Lord Justice Simon Brown said: ''I do not pretend to have found this
an easy case. On the contrary I recall none harder.''
He pointed out that the United Kingdom was largely out of line with
Nato and European allies in banning homosexuals from service in the
armed forces.
''So far as security is concerned, it is a little difficult to see how
the State can survive homosexual ambassadors and permanent secretaries
and yet not homosexual service personnel,'' he observed.
''The very fact that homosexual service men and women's jobs depend
upon hiding their sexual orientation exposes them to the risk of
blackmail.''
''I have come finally to the conclusion that, my own view of the
evidence notwithstanding, the Minister's stance cannot properly be held
unlawful,'' the judge declared.
He refused the applications with hesitation and regret. The future of
the policy had to rest with Parliament.
Lord Justice Simon Brown conceded: ''There will, I know, be those who
think this judgment pusillanimous.
''There will be others who think that in the course of it I have
stepped beyond the bounds of permissible judicial comment. Naturally I
disagree with both.

LEADERS of the main nursing unions in Scotland yesterday warned that
disruption in the NHS was now ''inevitable'' unless the Government and
trusts changed their policy.
As a wave of rallies and demonstrations were held around the country,
representatives of the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of
Midwives, the Community and District Nursing Association, and the
Scottish Health Visitors' Association met in Edinburgh.
In their first joint statement in the dispute, they said: ''If the
trusts and the Government cannot be persuaded to act sensibly and stop
their drive for local pay, then local disruption is inevitable.''
Their warning was backed up by the head of Unison in Scotland, Mr John
Lambie, who said that there would be action by nurses and other staff in
September if no settlement was reached by then.
The nursing unions' statement said: ''Nurses, midwives, and health
visitors know well what they can do in their areas to cause maximum
problems for administrators and accountants without harming or losing
the support of patients.''
Mrs Patrician Purton, Scottish director of the Royal College of
Midwives, said: ''At a time when midwives are increasingly being
expected to take a lead role in maternity services, it is disgraceful
that they should be offered what will, in many cases, be a pay cut.''
Ms Claire Young, professional officer of the CDNA in Scotland, said
there were developments in community care which had placed increased
demands on nurses.
''In the face of a shortage of community nurses, they must be paid
fairly. It is not fair that nurses are treated differently from doctors.
That is what is wrong with the whole thing.''
Mr David Forbes, general secretary of the Scottish Health Visitors'
Association, said the action throughout Scotland was designed to
reinforce the message that there should be a national pay rise for a
National Health Service.
Last night, however, there was no sign of any movement to settle the
dispute. The Scottish Office insisted that 35 of the 47 trusts had
offered 3% or more, a further nine 2.5% or more, and three had still to
make offers.
Ms Andrews dismissed this statement as ''rubbish''. ''Saying that
trusts are offering 3% is utterly meaningless when the strings mean
nurses losing holidays, unsocial payments, and a number of other
entitlements which, in many cases, leaves them worse off.''
Mr Lambie, speaking at the launch of a petition which will be
circulated around the country before being presented to the Scottish
Office on July 5, said the nursing and other health unions would be
balloting on industrial action next month.
''We hope it will not be necessary, but in the face of Government
intransigence we will be balloting and preparing for it,'' he said. ''If
the result is in favour, it is likely that action will commence around
the beginning or end of September.
''There is still time for the Government to reconsider their position.
They are trying to distance themselves from the dispute by claiming the
money is available in the trusts to pay the 3%. The reality is somewhat
different. They are trying to impose their political will on the trusts
by insisting on local bargaining, and exacerbating this by withholding
the money and telling them to meet the claim through efficiency savings
-- in other words cuts.''
Mr Lambie said trust chief executives had been told their
performance-related pay was in jeopardy if they did not comply with
this.
This was denied by the Scottish Office, which said that there had been
no response to the offers already on the table.

DEVELOPERS have modified controversial plans to build what has been
described as a mock cathedral in the foreground of one of Scotland's
most famous vistas, below Stirling Castle.
Head of planning at Stirling District Council Ms Sheila Terry, said
yesterday that architects acting for Central region had reduced the
height of the proposed new building, intended as a headquarters for
English drugs company Scotia Pharmaceuticals.
They have also lopped more than 3ft off the proposed elevation of a
tower, originally intended to be 70ft high.
The revised plans will go before Stirling District Council at the end
of the month, although a final decision will rest with the Secretary of
State.
The original plans attracted scathing criticism from objectors,
including Historic Scotland, which said they ''very seriously threatened
one of the most important settings in Scotland''.
Last month, Stirling District Council deferred considering the
planning application to give officials time to find a more acceptable
design.
Scotia had threatened to pull the plug on up to 1000 potential jobs if
the plan was vetoed.

BR left with final appeal.
THE British Railways Board will meet in London today to decide whether
to appeal to the House of Lords in a final effort to axe the Fort
William sleeper service.
Even if it does, it could be Christmas before the case is heard.
The Court of Session yesterday upheld Lord Kirkwood's earlier reprieve
for the service pending a full public consultation process.
In a comprehensive endorsement of that view Lord Hope, Scotland's most
senior judge, described as ''absurd'' BR's substitute ghost train
service in Strathclyde which was first revealed by The Herald on April 1
to be a method of avoiding consultation.
Having lost twice in the Scottish courts, the BR Board has the option
of a last throw of the legal dice to the House of Lords. It has three
months to appeal.
However, it emerged last night that should the BR Board opt to go down
this track its appeal to the highest court in the land may not be heard
until after Christmas because of the summer holidays and full case loads
between October and December.
Highland Regional Council has already decided to fight any appeal
whenever and wherever it is called.
A spokesman for the BR Board said it was obviously disappointed its
appeal had failed and would be studying the judgment to assess its
long-term implications.
That disappointment was shared by Mr John Ellis, director of ScotRail,
who said he too would need time to decide the next move. ''In the
meantime we will continue to operate and actively promote the three
daytime services between Fort William and Glasgow which are carrying 10
times as many passengers as the sleeper service.''
ScotRail said it believed the consultation procedure on the withdrawal
of the sleeper service began two weeks ago with the publication of the
Passenger Service Requirement.
Although the sleeper was not in the main text, the PSR carried figures
for the service in an appendix. A spokesman said consultation on the
withdrawal of the service could range from months to years.
Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney, in Glasgow for an Institute of
Directors' lunch, said: ''It is a matter for British Rail. I haven't
seen the terms of the judgment but it is a matter for them and they will
no doubt be studying it very carefully.''
He went on: ''Let's put the service in some sort of context. An
average of 18 passengers during the winter and 36 during the summer will
not sound, at least to some people, like a service which is at the heart
of the tourism industry in Scotland.
''However, I recognise that it has importance to the people of
Scotland and there is an emotional attachment to it.''
Mr Ellis disagreed with the description of the Strathclyde ''ghost''
services as absurd and said they would continue to run.
He pointed out that the sleeper service lost #2.5m a year. ''That is a
very serious amount of money for a very small number of people.''
Mr Ellis said that it had been accepted during the court case that
even with a 100% loading the sleeper would still lose substantial sums
of money. ''It would need four people for every berth every night of the
week to make it break even.''
One option might be to ask the Government or other bodies for
financial support.
''If the service is so important to the economy and tourist industry
in the Highlands it would not be unreasonable to approach bodies
responsible for the development of tourism for assistance,'' he said.
''We will consider all of the options in the light of this
disappointing outcome. We will need to consider how we meet the
substantial deficit the sleeper service provides.''
Elsewhere the news from the Court of Session was given a warm welcome.
The convener of Highland Regional Council, Councillor Duncan
McPherson, described the decision as a ''victory for commonsense''. Mr
Henry McLeish, Shadow Transport Secretary, said the ''historic court
decision'' had driven a further nail in the coffin of rail privatisation
north of the Border.
At the Court of Session immediately after the reprieve was confirmed,
Mr McPherson said: ''It is regrettable that we had to seek the
protection of the courts to secure important links of communication,
such as the West Highland sleeper.
''We believe the decision gives ScotRail a golden opportunity to make
the service a success. Publicity generated by the campaign has got
ScotRail off to a flying start with marketing, a key to the prosperity
of the service.''
He maintained that if the service were marketed properly it would not
cost #2.5m a year and pointed out that because of the publicity
surrounding the court case ScotRail had now put on two extra sleeper
coaches to cope with demand.
Mr McPherson added: ''I trust that the British Railways Board will
accept this decision gracefully and remove the doubt over the service.
If they want to go to the House of Lords, I'll be waiting at the door
for them.''
Mr McLeish said he was absolutely delighted the Scottish courts had
thrown out the appeal. ''BR has been determined to axe this service, no
matter what the impact. The fact that every section of Scottish life was
opposed to the decision should have resulted in a more responsible
course of action on the part of BR, the franchise director and Tory
Ministers.''
Labour, he added, was demanding that BR does not appeal to the House
of Lords, continues the services until the full consultation period is
exhausted, and reinstates Motorail services.
Liberal Democrat Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, said
he would be meeting the Prime Minister to discuss the matter. ''This is
a magnificent moral triumph which must now be converted into political
progress.''
Lochaber regional councillor Euan Harper, a former train driver, said
in Fort William: ''There is a great feeling around the town today.
People are just pleased that somebody has had the bottle to tackle this
issue.''
The chairman of the Fort William and Lochaber tourist board, Mr Alan
Kirk, said ''common sense has prevailed and I would hope BR would accept
that. There was deep concern amongst our 500 members, but now we would
like to see what can be done for this service with proper marketing.''
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which has commissioned a #30,000
study into the economic case for Highland rail services, also welcomed
the decision.
The SNP's business spokesman, Mr Fergus Ewing, who is the party's
candidate in the Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber constituency, criticised
BR's ''reckless disregard'' for the way in which public money was spent
on the legal costs in the case.
He said: ''The man who must carry the can for this wanton waste of
taxpayers' money is John Welsby, chairman and chief executive of the
British Railways Board. He has an annual salary of #180,000 and a
performance related bonus of 40% of his salary.
''If Mr Welsby gets a bonus for so-called good performance, should
there not be a reduction for bad judgment?''
Mr Ken Sutherland, research officer of the Railway Development
Society, called on ScotRail to abandon any thoughts of a further
''squalid appeal'' and go instead to the Government with an overwhelming
case for more adequate finance.

<HEADLINE>Fake Tetley teabags seized in raids. Trouble in stores as criminals turn from a saturated drugs market to commercial crime</HEADLINE>

HUNDREDS of boxes of fake Tetley teabags were seized across
Strathclyde yesterday when 200 trading standards officers raided various
retail outlets after receiving information.
Mr Andy Moynihan, Strathclyde region's trading standards controller,
claimed that criminals from the Glasgow underworld had moved into
commercial crime because the drugs market had become saturated.
However, this, along with a similar incident involving counterfeit
coffee in the last few weeks, was the first time they had put fake food
on to the market, he said. ''By using food, people's health is being put
at risk. This is an alarming development.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council said that samples of the
counterfeit teabags were being analysed by the council's chemist to
check for contamination and health hazards.
At best, the fake teabags are expected to contain low-grade tea. But
that could possibly be mixed with floor sweepings, like sawdust or even
rat droppings.
Dr Charlie MacDonald, depute regional chemist and public analyst,
said: ''We will be carrying out microscopic and micro-biological tests
on the teabags. Checks will be made for contamination such as floor
sweepings and twigs. The quality of any actual tea found in the bags
will also be tested.
''A series of micro-biological tests will be run to determine if
contamination exists. In the meantime we would advise consumers not to
make tea with these bags if they have purchased any, but to follow
consumer and trading standards advice to hand them in at their local
consumer and trading standards office.''
The tests are expected to be completed by Friday, but results will not
be released pending the possibility of a report to the
procurator-fiscal.
Any stall owners or corner shop owners selling the fake teabags were
warned yesterday by Mr Moynihan: ''Get them to me before I get to you.''
The counterfeit tea is not believed to have reached any supermarkets.
Mr Bruce Collier, director of Consumer and Trading Standards (Cats),
asked any consumers who had bought the bags to inform local Cats offices
of where they had purchased them.
The fake bags are Tetley 80 packs, serial number 4017E, expiry July
95. The packing is distinguished from the genuine Tetley packs by having
no blue pull strip on the cellophane wrapping.
The packs' recommended retail price is #1.55, but fake packets have
been recovered selling at #1.39 and #1.69.
Mr Collier said: ''We are following a definite line of inquiry in
regard to the producers of the teabags. The evidence suggests that this
is an example of conventional criminals crossing over to the world of
commercial crime which they perceive as a more lucrative and softer
option. We are in the business of changing that erroneous perception.''
Lyons Tetley confirmed it had received reports of counterfeit teabags,
but said the problem seemed confined to the West of Scotland and none
had been distributed to major retailers.
''We are relieved to have received no reports of any health risks from
these low quality imitation teabags,'' said marketing director John
Nicholas.
The company had set up an information line -- 0800 141214 -- for
customers and the trade, he said.
''We are very concerned that such irresponsible action could undermine
the reputation that Lyons Tetley has for high quality products. We will
be giving every assistance to trading standards officers in their search
for counterfeit teabags,'' added Mr Nicholas.
Fake coffee first appeared in Strathclyde a month ago, and officials
discovered the counterfeit tea in the past few days.

<HEADLINE>Battle to save pier from fire</HEADLINE>

A TEAM of 100 firefighters braved intense heat and falling girders
yesterday to quell a blaze which threatened to destroy the world's
longest pleasure pier.
One described the operation to save the mile-and-a-half pier at
Southend in Essex as like ''going into the jaws of hell''.
It could prove a severe financial blow for the Waverley. The paddle
steamer is scheduled to visit the area in the autumn, and is due to make
18 calls at the pier, including one for the resort's annual
illuminations.
The blaze, the third serious fire at the Victorian pier, began
yesterday morning in a bowling alley. As flames spread, firefighters
feared gallons of paint and oxygen cylinders stored in a work ship would
explode.
Tons of girders toppled around firefighters attempting to stop the
flames reaching the pier railway station.
The cost of repairs is likely to run into millions of pounds. One
woman was rescued from the bowling alley and treated for smoke
inhalation. Four others, caught on the wrong side of the blaze, were
rescued by lifeboat.
Despite the damage, the pier could reopen next month.
