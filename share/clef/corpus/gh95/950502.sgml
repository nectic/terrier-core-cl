THE threatened clampdown on the number of Scottish, Irish, or Welsh
international players -- senior and A caps -- who can be fielded by
English clubs in league matches will go ahead.
After a phase-in period when the limit will be two non-English
players, the clubs will be able to play just one Scottish, Irish, or
Welsh international player, although crucially, that limitation will not
be applied retrospectively. Home countries' players already on the books
of English clubs will not be affected.
Yesterday John Jeavons-Fellows, chairman of the Rugby Union
competitions committee said: ''There are nine Scottish, Irish or Welsh
international players in division one, and a total of 31 non-English
qualified players.
''The Scottish and Irish committees with whom we had informal talks
are on our side. They were worried that many of their players would come
to England and reduce the strength of their own leagues. This is a
slight touch on the brakes to check a potentially damaging situation.''
In fact, despite a large exodus being predicted, the number of
Scotland players who have gone south is small. Derrick Patterson, whose
move from Edinburgh Academicals to West Hartlepool resulted in a cap
against South Africa, is the only current squad member to have moved
specifically to pursue his rugby career.
Rob Wainwright also left Raeburn Place for West Hartlepool, but his
change of club had much more to do with his army posting to Yorkshire.
Others such as Peter Walton and David Hilton were already in the English
system.
Already this season, a number of leading Scottish players have signed
for English clubs, with notably the Gala and Scotland centre Gregor
Townsend seeming to be bound for Ian McGeechan's Northampton.
Yesterday, Gala's coach Peter Dods reiterated his belief that
Townsend's move South was by no means certain.
The fact that the ruling will not apply retrospectively means that
clubs such as Bath which have already pursued a policy of bringing in
players from outwith England will enjoy an unfair advantage. Bath,
already with four Scots and an Irish player who, under the new
regulations, could be fielded until the end of their careers, could play
an additional two non-England caps next season.
Importantly the RU'snew rules do not apply to the exiles' clubs --
London Scottish, Irish, and Welsh.

<HEADLINE>Ajax threat to Celtic's Degryse bid</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAN PAUL</BYLINE>

CELTIC could find themselves in a last-minute contest with Dutch
champions Ajax for the transfer of Belgian international striker Marc
Degryse, who was watched by the Amsterdam club's manager, Louis van
Gaal, as well as Celtic, when he scored the winning goal for Anderlecht
in the crucial championship match against fierce rivals Standard Liege
on Sunday night.
Degryse was the outstanding player on the field in the 2-1 win which
took his team to the top of the league, and when pressed afterwards
about the Ajax manager's presence, admitted: ''Given a choice, I would
prefer to go to Ajax, but Celtic are a big club and they are the only
ones to make a real move for me. I want to leave Anderlecht and I am
certainly interested in going to Celtic.''
It would not be a great surprise, for geographic reasons alone, if the
Belgian elected to go to Ajax ahead of a Scottish club, but Degryse has
a family connection which would make his choice even more
straightforward. His father-in-law is one of the youth coaches at Ajax
and the family upheaval would be nothing compared to a transfer to
Scotland. The fact that Ajax are emerging as one of the top clubs in
Europe once again would no doubt also have considerable weight.
The Amsterdam manager, van Gaal, has not made any comment about his
thoughts on the matter but he did not go to watch the Belgian game
simply to see a football match. The speculation about a bid for his
Finnish striker, Jari Litmanen, by AC Milan, has encouraged people to
believe that he was sizing up Degryse as a possible replacement.
Much may depend on whether the Italian talk about Litmanen is genuine
or another of their gamesmanship exercises as they approach the European
Cup final against Ajax in Vienna on May 24. The Italians reportedly
embarked upon a similar campaign when they let it be known they were
keen on George Weah, the brilliant striker of Paris St Germain, before
the two teams met in the Champions' Cup semi-final. Whether that was
right or not, Weah certainly did not hit top form in the two legs which
Milan went on to win.
The story has more substance this time, however, as Milan have lost
out in the transfer they wanted, that of Eric Cantona from Manchester
United, and are said now to have switched their attention to Litmanen.
The 22-year-old Finn has indicated that he would rather stay with Ajax
but, once the Italian lira is waved before his very eyes, he may find
that stance hard to maintain.
The Milan move may never happen, and the knock-on effect which could
bring Degryse into the equation would be averted. However, Celtic might
be best to move swiftly to make sure they get their man. The Belgian
club were making encouraging noises for Parkhead ears, officials saying
yesterday that it was now up to Celtic what happens next. However,
others abroad were also beginning to indicate a willingness to join in
the race. Valencia in Spain, PSV Eindhoven, and Paris St Germain are all
monitoring the situation.
In the more immediate future Celtic have to take on Partick Thistle in
a premier division match tonight. For Thistle, the great escape would be
just about completed if they could beat Celtic at Hampden. Victory would
lift them six points clear of Aberdeen and five ahead of Dundee United,
with just two games to go.
The carrot for the Parkhead club is second top place in the division
which would guarantee them UEFA Cup football, but to have any chance of
overtaking Motherwell they need to lift three points.

RANGERS manager Walter Smith revealed last night that team captain
Richard Gough will not play again this season.
''Richard went through a minor foot operation this morning and will
now wait for next season before playing again,'' he said. ''It is not
the same foot as he has had problems with before, but we felt it was
best to have it done now.''
Smith also said that Ally McCoist, who played for a spell in the
second half of the Scott Nisbet testimonial last night, would be seeing
a specialist again tomorrow. ''He has not had the results of the X-rays
yet but is to see him then anyway. He can run and play but he is still
getting a litle pain from his ankle.''
Stuart McCall, who also consulted a specialist, went through an
operation on his Achilles tendon yesterday as well.
Graeme Souness confirmed he did not see his future in football any
more. ''But you never know what is around the corner,'' he added.
* IT MIGHT be no surprise, but it is no less magnificent an
achievement for that, and Brian Laudrup deserves all the accolades that
will go with being named yesterday as the Scottish Football Writers
Association Player of The Year.
The Dane has been a beacon of brilliance in a mundane season when few
others were able to produce extraordinary form. As his manager, Walter
Smith of Rangers, said, he not only enhanced the game on the field but
off it as well. Laudrup was in typically articulate form when he heard
of his award.
''I am delighted to be the first foreign player to win this award,''
he said, ''and it is a great honour to follow in the footsteps of so
many famous great Scottish players and, of course, Mark Hateley, who was
the first non-Scot to win it last year.''
Laudrup recalled being player of the year twice in Denmark, in 1989
and 92, but the closest he has been to winning this kind of award
outside his own country was in Germany when he was with Bayern Munich.
''I was player of the month twice there and was voted top foreign player
for the first half of the season but this award means so much more than
that.''
Laudrup will be presented with his award at a gala dinner in Glasgow
on May 7.

International XI 2, Rangers 3
THEY turned up in great numbers, fans, admirers, bosses, pals and
team-mates -- as many as 27,705 of them -- all to wish 'Nissy' well,
writes Ian Paul.
There are testimonials that have dubious justification, many of them
serving merely to make rich men even richer, but the night Scott Nisbet
had his show at Ibrox was worthy of applause from everyone in football.
When he was told his playing days were over at the age of 25 because
of a pelvic injury, Nisbet knew that life could never be the same.
At least he knows after last night that he will be fondly remembered
by the multitude who recall a player of complete honesty who once scored
a goal that will be talked about long after many of his more illustrious
peers have headed for their own retirement parties.
When he ran out to mighty cheers between the guard of honour formed by
the two teams carrying his toddler son, known only as TJ, he was only a
few yards away from that famous spot, from where he scored the winning
goal against FC Brugge in the Champions' League in 1992.
Maybe he let his mind wander to that memorable moment when his shot,
heading for Paisley Road Toll, was deflected towards Copland Road and
then did the most perfect Fosbury Flop over a bewildered Belgian
goalkeeper. They don't make them like that any more.
The stars, some of them who didn't exactly end up best of buddies with
the International Select player manager, Graeme Souness -- were there,
men like Graham Roberts, Terry Butcher, and Nisbet himself, who was the
man even Graeme couldn't persuade to leave.
Ray Wilkins, Kevin Drinkell, Jimmy Nicholl, and Roberts are all
current managers but were well backed by many who are still earning
their keep as players, like Maurice Johnston, David Hagen, and Derek
Ferguson.
It was a sedate pattern befitting the old-style shirts the Select were
wearing, with Jimmy Nicholl demonstrating the mood when he put his hands
on his head as Laudrup got the ball.
After seven minutes Nisbet went off, to another rousing cheer, and was
replaced by Andy Gray, the black midfield player, formerly with Aston
Villa and now with Marbella, and a friend of the family.
The fun was further illustrated when Select keeper Chris Woods, now
with Sheffield Wednesday, stood applauding as a chip from Mikhailichenko
went over his head to give Rangers the lead in nine minutes.
Rangers went two ahead, after a brilliant piece of play between
Mikhailichenko and Hateley, who completed it with a header past Woods.
The Select received their biggest cheer when they pulled a goal back,
started by a young ex-Ranger, David Hagen, but taken on and finished by
two old-timers, Roberts, with a fine cross, and Drinkell, with a superb
header.
The crowd and players stood silent for a minute before the start of
the second half, in remembrance of Davie Cooper, and then it was off to
work again, with Gordon Durie replacing Laudrup, and Gary Bollan taking
the place of Craig Moore in Rangers' team, and Ian McCall coming on for
Hagen in the Select.
Next on was Ally McCoist for Hateley and in the other side, Davie
Dodds took over from Drinkell.
In 62 minutes, the Select were given a penalty, when McLaren pulled
back McCall, and on came Nissy, shot into the net, and retreated to the
dressing room.
McCoist was next for the cheers, when he headed in a Bollan cross.
Nisbet said later: ''It was hard to accept that when I came off I
would not be able to run out there again with the boys.''
INTERNATIONAL SELECT -- Woods, Nicholl, Munro, Roberts, Wilkins,
Butcher, Derek Ferguson, Hagen, Drinkell, Johnston, Nisbet. Substitutes
-- Gray, Dodds, McCall, Souness, McPherson.
RANGERS -- Thomson, Murray, Cleland, Moore, McLaren, Mikhailichenko,
Steven, Ian Ferguson, Durrant, Hateley, Laudrup. Substitutes -- McCoist,
Inglis, Durie, Lee Robertson, Bollan.
Referee -- M A Clark (Edinburgh).

EDINBURGH teenager Stephanie Main won the senior women's ice-skating
title at the Scottish Championships held at the Lagoon Leisure Centre,
Paisley.
The 18-year-old skated an excellent short programme to finish ahead of
Zoe Jones, with reigning British champion Jenny Arrowsmith relegated to
third after a disappointing performance.
The junior women's title went to Oxford's Rouselle Soussana, whose
performance in both short and long programmes was representative of her
obvious confidence. Second was Lucianna Sandonato, who unfortunately
fell early in her long programme and had to skate the remainder with an
ankle injury.
The men's champion was Andrew Seabrook, of Swindon, who did not
perform to his true potential but did enough to win.

Craiglockhart, Edinburgh. Barnett, of Caledonian, won his first-round
match against Gavin Arber (Kent) 6-1, 6-2 while Colinton's Mair, younger
brother of Michele, had a walk-over.
Graeme Darlington (Bridge of Allan), Nicola Payne (Tayport), and
Lyndsay Reilly (Murrayfield) all lost, the girls in the second round.
The unseeded 15-year-old Czeck Denisa Chladkova, a possible star of the
future, who won last week's main event, again qualified comfortably.
Michele Mair (Colinton), again seeded sixth this week, meets England's
Heather Matthews today in the first round proper of the women's singles.
The men's second qualifying round also is on court.

Eric Kennedy continues our series with a look at a computer software
analyst whose work helps keep a major motoring organisation out in
front.
PAUL Mackie remembers the days when a computer would fill a room. When
he was a tax officer, in fact, the one he ran at Centre One took up the
equivalent of 10.
Times have changed. So has Paul Mackie's job: instead of keeping track
of Scotland's taxpayers, he helps keep tabs on the Automobile
Association members in this country and Northern Ireland.
And change is the name of the game these days at the AA, which is now
introducing a range of emergency domestic help schemes for members. If
you have a burst pipe, a call to the association will secure a plumber:
the AA will call up its database of recommended tradesmen.
The association is always extending its services to members and is
naturally keen to keep one step ahead of its main rivals, the RAC and
National Breakdown.
Any new ideas have to be examined in depth before being launched. The
cost-effectiveness of the domestic emergency scheme, like that of all
other new initiatives, was scrutinised with the aid of computers and
this is where people like Paul Mackie come in.
Paul is a senior analyst/designer, based at the AA's Scottish
headquarters in Erskine and entrusted with the writing of special
software programs and adapting them to changing business needs.
The AA is now a variety of businesses, taking in activities such as
insurance and financial services, foreign travel, retailing, and
publishing and by the very nature of its basic road-based activity is
more dependent than most organisations on information technology.
Obviously it is one of the places to be, should one wish to work in
this area.
The AA tends to look for business analysts, analyst programmers and
technical specialists/database designers with a recognised skill base to
graduate or comparable level.
That said, aptitude counts for much more: creative energy and genuine
commercial vision are important to this organisation and Paul Mackie has
clearly worked his way up the ladder through demonstrating such
qualities and via a thorough grounding in computer programming.
This came via his early work at Centre One in the late 70s, loading
tapes and running programs in the days of paper and magnetic tape. His
programming and software-writing skills were well developed before he
joined Barr and Stroud as a senior analyst programmer in Glasgow,
writing programs for stock control, ordering processes, etc.
That was in 1985 but he forsook the defence industry two-and-a-half
years ago to work for the AA. It is, he says, an interesting job with a
challenging routine at a time when communications of all kinds continue
to enjoy a boom.
With AA membership now standing at eight million, and information
technology perceived as the best way to keep track of them, Paul Mackie
would appear to be in an ideal position.

SCOTLAND should be at the top table of British basketball. The
oft-repeated message from both clubs and management of the Budweiser
League following another successful play-offs weekend at the Wembley
Arena is that a Scottish team, or even teams, would be welcomed back if
the necessary franchise conditions were met.
At the weekend, an 8000 crowd saw the former Glasgow Rangers and
Kingston player, Alan Cunningham, record a remarkable seventh win in a
row in leading Worthing Bears to the title.
It was with Rangers in 1989 that Cunningham scored his first win when
he came north of the Border with the Kingston club.
But Rangers' flirtation with the hoops game proved brief despite their
win over David Murray's MIM Livingston in the all-Scottish 1989 final.
The following year Kingston were back in Surrey and a year later,
there was no Scots' club in the league.
The biggest obstacle to a Scottish return, not surprisingly, would be
the cost. Sheffield, who won in their inaugural season, spent at least
#100,000, #35,000 of which went to securing Jim Brandon, the Budweiser
League's coach of the year.
The travelling would be considerable with a daunting schedule of 36
league games, 18 on the road, plus play-offs and other competitions.

SCOTLAND face England in the Spring Cup in Portugal tonight hoping to
overturn a defeat by their arch-rivals at the recent Pan-European Cup in
Oxford.
Coach Tommy Dowens, whose players train with England regularly as part
of the Great Britain squad, has told his players that it is all about
stopping Matthew Jones, the English hitter who has made such a big
impact in Belgium this season.
The Scots have been working on their blocking since Oxford to combat
the threat of Jones, and Dowens is confident that if his team play to
their full potential, they are capable of an upset in Oporto.
Neither team made a good start yesterday -- Scotland, playing in their
first match in the competition for two years, losing to Italy 15-2,
15-6, 15-8, and the English losing 15-10, 15-9, 15-6, to Lithuania in
the other match in the group.
On the domestic front, Grange, formed 13 years ago, are claiming a
unique place in Scottish volleyball history.
The Polmont-based club have just completed their most successful
season both in national and district leagues and have become the first
club to have four teams promoted in the one season.
The club was established in 1981 with just one men's team, and a
women's team was added seven years later.
In 1989, Grange II were formed.

FRANK Bruno yesterday broke off his training in Leicestershire to
travel to Glasgow in a bid to halt rumours surrounding his forthcoming
fight in the Kelvin Hall on May 13 -- his last appearance before,
hopefully, challenging America's Oliver McCall for the World Boxing
Council's version of the world heavyweight championship.
It had been suggested in some quarters that because of last week's
call off of original opponent Ray Anis -- there appeared to be
contractual difficulties -- that there would be no fight in Glasgow.
Then when Mike Evans, of Santa Ana, in California, was named as a
substitute, the rumour wagon began rolling again, saying that Evans was
''just another body,'' a less than worthy opponent for Bruno, who has
had his fair share of those in the past.
Bruno, however, banged out the rumours just as quickly and decisively
as he took care of his last two opponents, Rodolfo Marin and Jesse
Ferguson, who between them lasted a total of three minutes 27 seconds.
''I'm here to tell you personally that I will be fighting in Glasgow
this month,'' said the man who, in the summer, hopes to win the world
title at the fourth attempt. ''And I'm here to tell you that Mike Evans
is a good, durable opponent, who has fought top guys. Just look at his
record.''
I did, and while there is little to strike fear in the hearts of the
top ranked men, durability, along with a punch, certainly seems to be a
genuine quality. There are also some interesting statistics.
The American has been stopped only once, by Jorge Luis Gonzalez in
Nevada a year ago. He has won 30 of his 41 fights and drawn one, and has
stopped 21 of his opponents. He has also gone the distance with boxers
such as Tyrell Biggs, Tony Tubbs, Tony Tucker, and Michael Moorer, the
latter two who still retain a top ten ranking. Evans, who has been in
strict training, certainly doesn't sound like a man who is coming here
to fall over.
Said Bruno: ''With a record like that, I'm certainly not going to
underestimate him. Moorer is one of the toughest fighters in the world
and a former champion, while Tucker is a two-time world champion. Evans
also lost a split decision to Ray Anis, who has just been judged by
'Ring' magazine as the best young heavyweight prospect of the year.
''I do not get involved in criticism. I am not in the ego business,
but it hurts when people do not look at my opponent's record.''
And, just to show how seriously Bruno is taking the fight -- one he
must win or his dream of meeting McCall will be shattered -- he admitted
that he has changed his training schedule.
To combat the speed and movement of Anis, Bruno had been sparring with
cruiserweight Terry Dunstan, who will challenge Dennis Andries for the
British title on the Kelvin Hall bill.
''But now to get closer to the style of Evans I have imported two big
men from America, Linwood Jones and Bigfoot Johnston, who is almost 20
stones.''
Also with Bruno was trainer George Francis and promoter Frank Warren's
assistant Andy Ayling, who said Ibrox Stadium had not been ruled out as
a venue for the world title fight on July 22 or 29.
He said: ''We are looking at football grounds around the country with
sizeable capacities. Ibrox is a possibility and we are going there later
today to have a look at it.''
Wembley, Upton Park, and Millwall's New Den are other possible venues,
and the odds must be heavily on the fight being staged in the south.
While in Glasgow yesterday, Bruno entertained dozens of local
youngsters from the boxing section of the Strathclyde Youth Clubs
Association -- and promptly offered to buy them all a ticket for the
Evans fight. Then it was on to Ibrox, as a guest of Rangers, to have a
look at the stadium and back down south to continue his training.
Bruno will finish his training in Scotland and will be back here next
week -- in time to be a guest of Celtic at the Old Firm match at Hampden
on Sunday.
Apart from Bruno and Andries, others who will feature on the Kelvin
Hall show are former world middleweight champion Chris Pyatt, who is
making a comeback after losing his crown to Steve Collins, the man who
recently handed Chris Eubank his first defeat, former British
middleweight champion Cornelius Carr and local stars Dave Anderson and
Brian Carr. There will 13 fights in all.

FOOTBALL ROUND-UP
ABERDEEN were warned yesterday that their toughest test has yet to
come in their fight to escape relegation.
As the demand for tickets for the derby clash with Dundee United
mounted, making Pittodrie a sell-out on Saturday, acting manager Roy
Aitken insisted: ''We have achieved nothing yet.
''All we have done is ensure our fate is now within our own grasp. The
difficult part still lies ahead. We've not won two games back to back
all season which really says it all.
''However, by regaining the consistency lacking earlier, we have put
together a run and brought other teams into the relegation issue.
''It is vital now that we remain ruthlessly single-minded in our
objective and go for the killer touch.''
Aitken will be confirmed as permanent manager once the relegation
battle is over -- regardless of Aberdeen's fate.
He did admit though that the victory over Hearts, which carved open an
escape route, had eased the pressure at Pittodrie.
He explained: ''The players are enjoying praise for a change because
they have had to take a lot of flak, but that result is now history.''
He added: ''I sense a mood of determination within the dressing room.
They want to turn the screw and see the job through.
''Everything is coming nicely to the boil at exactly the right time.
We are getting the breaks that didn't go our way earlier on. And our
fans have truly magnificent in rallying behind us. I always maintained
we were all in this together.''
Striker Scott Booth, out since scoring in Scotland's draw against
Russia last November at Hampden, will undergo an exploratory operation
this week in an attempt to cure the mystery injury.
Aitken added: ''He will travel to Harley Street for orthoscopic
surgery to see if it is a possible muscle tear in his pelvis which is
causing the problem.''
Dutch keeper Theo Snelders, out for six weeks with a broken foot, made
his comeback yesterday against Hearts reserves and could feature in the
vital New Firm derby.
* SIX Kilmarnock stars have two games left to secure their Rugby Park
futures. First-team regulars Gus McPherson, Mark Reilly and Mark
Skilling are among the group anxious to secure new contracts.
Alex Totten's outfit ensured their place in next season's premier
division with a point in the 0-0 draw with Partick Thistle, and the
manager said: ''There are half-a-dozen players out of contract and we
hope to start getting things sorted within the next couple of weeks.
''I've spoken to the players and I don't see too many problems. They
earned their place in the premier divsion through hard work. Teams such
as Aberdeen and Dundee United are still sweating on their fate, so it
was no small achievement.''

cut Blackburn's lead and keep alive Manchester United's dream of a
championship hat trick.
Coventry finally buckled to Cole's predatory finishing instincts 11
minutes from the end of a thrilling contest at Highfield Road.
United now are five points behind but with a game in hand, and the
odds against them retaining the title have gone down from 8-1 two days
ago to just 5-4 -- with Blackburn at 4-7. The champions achieved this
result without injured skipper Steve Bruce, wing wizards Ryan Giggs and
Andrei Kanchelskis, and suspended midfield stars Paul Ince and Roy
Keane.
It was an error from Kevin Richardson which enabled Britain's most
expensive striker to indulge in a piece of match-winning opportunism.
At 2-2, the Sky Blues looked to have eased their clinging relegation
fears with a deserved point.
But Richardson's attempt to head the ball back to k eeper Jon Gould --
from just inside the Coventry half -- only found Cole, who flicked the
ball up and over the stranded keeper, stepped round him, and volleyed
into the empty net.
Coventry had twice hit back through Peter Ndlovu and Steven Pressley
to cancel out strikes by Paul Scholes and the brilliant Cole. It was
former Rangers man Pressley's first goal for Coventry but his second in
a week, having scored Scotland Under-21s' winner against San Marino on
Wednesday.
Former United manager Ron Atkinson could not have asked more from his
Coventry battlers, with 38-year-old player-coach Gordon Strachan --
another graduate from the Old Trafford academy -- setting the example in
midfield.
In the end Cole was the difference between the teams. His goal tally
for the season is 26, including 11 in 14 games for United since his
big-money move from Newcastle.
* ABERDEEN were warned yesterday that their toughest test has yet to
come in their fight to escape relegation.
As the demand for tickets for the derby clash with Dundee United
mounted, making Pittodrie a sell-out on Saturday, acting manager Roy
Aitken insisted: ''We have achieved nothing yet. All we have done is
ensure our fate is now within our own grasp. The difficult part still
lies ahead.''
Aitken will be confirmed as permanent manager once the relegation
battle is over -- regardless of Aberdeen's fate.
* SIX Kilmarnock stars have two games left to secure their Rugby Park
futures. First-team regulars Gus McPherson, Mark Reilly and Mark
Skilling are among the group anxious to secure new contracts.
Manager Alex Totten said: ''There are half-a-dozen players out of
contract and we hope to start getting things sorted within the next
couple of weeks.''

Household products group Reckitt and Colman has sold its Colman's
mustard division to Unilever which in turn is selling on part of the
business, Robinsons soft drinks, to Bass. Unilever is paying #250m cash
for Colman's of Norwich, the UK-based food and drinks business.
Britannia Soft Drinks, the parent company of Britvic and a subsidiary of
Bass, is paying #103m for Robinsons which has annual sales of about
#95m.
Sir Ian Prosser, chairman of Bass, said ''the acquisition of this
brand leader represents an excellent opportunity for Britvic,
strengthening its position in the UK soft drinks market''. Sir Ian added
that the transaction is likely to be earnings neutral for Britvic in the
current financial year and significantly earnings enhancing in the first
full financial year of operation. Britvic Soft Drinks employs 3,000
people in the UK and is the second largest soft drinks company in the
country.
As a major employer in Norwich, Reckitt &amp; Colman had been keen to
retain as many jobs as possible in the city. The Colman's site at
Norwich is to be jointly owned and managed by Unilever and Britannia
Soft Drinks. Manufacturing operations will continue on the site for the
forseeable future.
Although there is little overlap in manufacturing between the Unilever
and Reckitt's business, there should be plenty of scope for cost savings
in distribution and marketing.
Reckitt has been trying to sell the historic Colman's mustard business
since last year when it paid #1000m for L &amp; F Household, a US cleaning
products group. It intends to concentrate on consolidating its position
as a global household and toiletries group. Its brands include Harpic,
Mr Sheen, Dettol, Lemsip, Bonjela and Steradent.
Last year, household and toiletry activities made up 69% of group
sales, pharmaceuticals was 11% with food and other activities making up
the remaining 20%.
The proceeds from the Colman's sale will be used to reduce Reckitt's
debt pile. Last September, Reckitt's estimated that its disposal
programme, including Colman's of Norwich, would raise about #400m after
tax.
City analysts think that Reckitt got a good price for Colman's while
Unilever has gained a useful addition to its food business. Reckitt's
leading position in the UK dry cooking sauce market complements
Unilever's existing strengths in glass-jar sauces such as Ragu. Unilever
could decide to market Colman's mustards and sauces overseas perhaps to
areas where its products such as OXO are already sold.
''Reckitt has got a fair price, not out of line with expectations,
paying five times net assets and 1.6 times sales,'' said food analyst
Duncan Fox of brokers Warburg Securities.
Last Friday, speculation that such as deal was in the offing pushed up
Reckitt's shares to 634p with Bass at 551p. Yesterday Reckitt shares
were 640p, down 1p, Bass were steady at 549p and Unilever lost 8p to
1219p.
Sir Michael Colman is stepping down as chairman of Reckitt &amp; Colman in
August, ending his family's seven-generation 182-year connection with
the condiment. He is to be succeeded by Alan Dalby, a Glaswegian-born,
North-American trained veteran of the pharmaceutical industry.

NO fewer than 17 languages are spoken by the pupils of Kelvindale
Primary School in the West End of Glasgow. In particular, the school
offers 33 Punjabi speakers, 15 Urdu, 11 Chinese (Cantonese and
Mandarin), five Korean, four Hindi and four Dutch.
In all, there are 90 bilingual pupils out of a roll of 450. It seems a
formidable challenge for the staff of Kelvindale but they regard it as a
highly rewarding experience.
According to head teacher Christine Higgison: ''Many of our bilingual
pupils belong to families where one of the parents is undertaking
post-graduate work or study in Glasgow.'' The children sometimes speak
no English when they arrive but for the most part they are bilingual to
differing degrees.
Under Strathclyde region's social strategy, extra staffing is
available to support bilingual pupils in this school which, in Christine
Higgison's words, ''is very rich in diversity''. Marjory Watt, the
senior teacher responsible for English as a second language (ESL), works
with all Kelvindale's 15 classes, operating mainly in the classroom and
using withdrawal only to support those pupils who have recently arrived
in this country.
She explained: ''They are introduced to the whole curriculum from the
start. They learn English as they engage the curriculum.'' Others, a
little more advanced, need enrichment of language. They have adequate
social conversation and seem all right on the surface. However, on
average, a pupil needs two years for good social language and five for
language for academic purposes.
Sue Dani, the other senior teacher, formerly had responsibility for
ESL and is now working with Mrs Watt on a revision of Kelvindale's equal
opportunities policy. The school's approach to pupils with little or no
English is sensitive. ''We allow them a silent period when they arrive,
if they want it. Usually they don't -- they quickly talk to friends in
the playground and it develops from there.''
She is happy with the bilingualism which occurs naturally in both
classroom and playground. It is good for the children themselves, and
equally good for other children to hear. ''They love picking up words
and phrases in other languages and repeating them. That way, they learn
about aspects of other cultures, such as food.''
All Kelvindale's teachers have undergone in-service training, and are
familiar with both ESL strategies and the range of cultures. Marjory
Watt never takes bilingual groups on their own, always arranging for
them to bring friends along. These monolingual friends are selected so
that they can be offered enrichment in areas like baking, if they lack
opportunities at home. Mrs Watt emphasised the benefit for the
monolingual pupil in ''learning to speak -- and listen -- to bilingual
children''.
Liaison with parents is carefully cultivated, especially as many are
in a position to consolidate at home the work done by their bilingual
children. For those at a relatively early stage of bilingualism,
imaginative writing in their own language is acceptable until they are
ready to adopt English. Likewise, diaries and stories can be composed --
and read out -- in the native language at first.
Though, like any other school, Kelvindale has pupils in need of
learning support, Christine Higgison made the point that many of the
bilingual pupils are very able. She described as ''exceptionally
bright'' seven-year-old Yangheun Kim, whose father serves in the Korean
Air Force. Subscribing to the Korean work ethic, Yangheun herself adores
Kelvindale. ''We make things here and we work hard.'' For a youngster
who arrived only a year ago, her English is remarkable.
Razwan Khan, also in primary three, was born in Scotland but speaks
Urdu at home because ''my mum just knows some English''. Nour Al-Hadidy,
also seven, is a Jordanian girl, from a family of doctors, who knew no
English when she arrived two years ago. Like Yangheun, she claims to
''like working very hard.''
Nine-year-old Zenab Ali, also from a medical family, was born in
Pakistan but moved to this country when she was only one. Her two
brothers are equally fluent in English, but the family speaks Punjabi at
home. Zenab made the considerate gesture of writing her Mother's Day
card entirely in Punjabi, in which her mother is more comfortable.
Lyn Minn-Din, also nine, came here from Burma three years ago. His
father is working in Singapore, his mother is studying in Scotland. Lyn,
whose English is excellent, will return to Rangoon for good next year
and has already decided to become a geologist.
The nations meet in Kelvindale, and the school lays great store by its
equal opportunities policy. ''The resources we use must reflect our
diversity,'' said Christine Higgison. ''We have disabled pupils as well.
We respect all cultures and needs. There is no tokenism.''

SCOTLAND will hope, rather than expect, to make it third time lucky
when they meet Yorkshire in today's B&amp;H Cup tie at Hamilton Crescent in
Glasgow. After the 10-wicket defeat at Worcester in the opening match,
last Tuesday's 46-run loss to Derbyshire at Titwood was more
respectable.
Even so, it would be asking a great deal to expect victory over a
Yorkshire side which will include England's Darren Gough -- who warmed
up with a career-best seven for 28 in his side's 219-run win in the
Roses challenge match against Lancashire -- and Craig White, plus the
talented Australian Test batsman, Michael Bevan.
Such is the county's strength in depth that Gavin Hamilton, their
promising young seam bowler from West Lothian who has been a regular
member of the Scotland side in the past two seasons, can only expect to
be listed as twelfth man today. Nevertheless, his former colleagues will
be determined to prove that an upset is not impossible.
Just ask Malcolm Marshall, Scotland's professional for the year. He
once came to Hamilton Crescent with a Hampshire team brimful of
world-class players and was relieved in the end to leave with pride
intact. Curiously, he has mixed memories of a match which almost ended
in embarrassment for the likes of himself and David Gower.
''It was a good day for me, because I took over as captain when Mark
Nicholas got injured,'' recalled Marshall. ''Scotland gave us a few
problems. We managed to restrict them to around 150, before we had to
come off for rain. It was quite late in the day when we went in to bat,
and they had us in trouble with a couple of early wickets, but then the
rain came again and the match was washed out.''
Hampshire went on to win the B&amp;H Cup that season, an achievement which
Marshall regards as one of his favourite cricketing memories.

PLAYERS who offer that element of versatility, enabling them to
perform acceptably in another position at the highest level, could have
special value at the World Cup in South Africa, where hard grounds,
intense commitment, and tackling of a highly physical nature are bound
to put injury strain on squad resources.
Truly it has been said that a side is only as strong as its reserves,
in which regard Scotland seems reasonably well equipped for coping with
such emergencies. Not only is there strong competition for certain
positions, notably centre, hooker, lock, and breakaway, but a number of
players already have had international experience in more than one
position.
Kenny Logan, for instance, gained his first cap as full-back
replacement for Gavin Hastings against Australia in 1992, and has
appeared four times each for Scotland A and for Glasgow at full back. He
has made, however, such an impact at club and representative level on
the left wing that there will be some reluctance to switch him unless in
dire emergency.
Tony Stanger's move to centre this season brought a demonstration
against the Romanians that he has much to offer there in terms of
physique, strong running, with a feel for angles, and good skills, but
his 36 caps as a wing and deadly finisher give another option if
required.
The choice of Graham Shiel as stand-off against the Spanish Barbarians
in Madrid this evening underlines how fortunate it is to have such sound
cover for the job of operations director if ever Craig Chalmers should
be injured or in need of a break. One was pleased to see Shiel put his
critics on the back foot with that accomplished display against Romania
in which he seemed to have picked up an extra metre of pace.
With a balance of two loose-head and two tight-head props it has to be
helpful that Peter Wright and Paul Burnell have had experience as
international loose heads, although their reputations have been created
on the right side of the front row.
Not only has Doddie Weir shown his capacity as a lock for ball-winning
in the forward lineout berth, as well as elsewhere, but he has played in
10 internationals as a No.8 and even has represented Melrose on the
flank.
He is indeed one of four in the Scottish squad who could do a job as
No.8, although if Peter Walton can reach international match fitness,
Scotland's most effective loose-forward combination could be Walton at
blind side, Eric Peters at No.8 and Rob Wainwright at open side. England
play Ben Clarke at open side. He is 6ft 5in and gives them the added
lineout dimension that would be available to Scotland from Walton,
Peters, and Wainwright.
The choice of Scott Hastings as full back against the Spanish
Barbarians gives a clear indication of selectorial intent should Gavin
Hastings be unavailable. Clearly, the Hastings physique is an important
factor. Full backs need to be strong on their feet for dealing with the
amount of up-and-under punting that has become a major plank in tactical
testing.
Perhaps, and hopefully, there won't be quite as much of that on the
firm terrain of South Africa, although the ball there travels miles into
the stratosphere and there are usually big men on the hoof underneath
it. Which may explain in part the absence from the Scottish squad of
Michael Dods and the choice of Scott Hastings as cover for his brother.
True, it is 10 years since Scott operated at full back, although he
had a lot of experience there in his formative years. He played there in
three games for Edinburgh in 1985 district championship and for Scotland
B against the Italians. He has the requisite build and pace, tackles
hards, and punts the ball miles. It is sure to be a useful exercise to
see him in action as last line against the Spanish Barbarians and,
whatever the outcome, he can depend on having specialist advice close at
hand and a brotherly word as to where, if at all, he got it wrong.
It is a comfort that all, except Cameron Glasgow, have had a taste of
top international rugby, that Glasgow knows what it is like to play
against the All Blacks and Springboks, and that there are players who
can double up in another position if the need should arise.

LOCKERBIE trainer Colin Parker and his principal owner, Raymond
Anderson Green, have runners in four of the six races at Kelso tonight,
the first evening meeting at the Borders track for almost 40 years.
The meeting has been dubbed ''Capital City night'' as Edinburgh
companies have sponsored five of the races.
Parker's best chances of adding to his total of 13 winners would
appear to be Boarding School, in the Edinburgh Crystal Handicap Chase,
and Trump, in the Royal Bank of Scotland Handicap Hurdle, both
consistent performers earlier in the season.
Mils Mij, who won his first race over fences at Kelso in April, will
be strongly fancied to repeat that success in the richest race of the
evening, the #7000 George Inter-Continental Edinburgh Trophy Novices
Chase in a small but competitive field.
Locally-owned and trained Davy Blake, a course-and-distance winner on
four previous occasions, carries top weight in the Edinburgh Crystal
Handicap Chase, but could go close in a very open race.
* PEDIGREE experts will be backing Paradise Waters in the Jacqueline
Coxon Birthday Stakes Handicap at Bath, writes White and Gold.
The three-year-old's breeding suggests that she will be very hard to
beat in this mile-and-a-quarter race.
Her dam's family is packed with winners over middle-distances and
beyond, while sire Celestial Storm needed at least a mile-and-a-half to
be fully effective.
She is also well handicapped to win, as she carries only 7st 13lb.
Secret Miss looks the best bet at Nottingham in the six-furlong
Bradmore Fillies' Handicap. She has shown promise in three outings to
date in maidens.

ENGLAND can win rugby's World Cup if they become more street-wise,
captain Will Carling claimed yesterday.
''This is a very good England side,'' he told a Sports Writers'
Association lunch in London. ''But there are no illusions that we can
just wander along and produce the same as we did in the Five Nations'
Championship. We need to be sharp, mentally and physically, and more
street-wise and ruthless.''
He applauded rugby league's move to broaden its appeal, and saw no
reason why players should not switch codes. He said: ''If Ryan Giggs
turned up wanting to play for Harlequins, he could. If he was playing
rugby league, he couldn't. I've never understood the logic of that.''

By DEREK DOUGLAS in Navacerrada, Spain
CAMERON Glasgow, for so long the nearly man of Scottish rugby, has
been passed fit to play in today's Rugby World Cup warm-up game against
the Spanish Barbarians, who now look likely to appear in Madrid County
Select guise.
Glasgow suffered a back-muscle spasm after a squad workout at
Murrayfield on Saturday and as a precaution Boroughmuir winger Derek
Stark flew out to join the party in Spain on Sunday night.
However, Glasgow is fully recovered and will take his place on the
left wing for this evening's game in Madrid.
If the Heriot's FP utility back had remained on the injured list, it
would have represented just the latest in a string of ''so near yet so
far'' blows which have punctuated his career.
Yesterday, at the end of a gruelling two-hour training session at the
Scottish base in the mountains north of Madrid, Glasgow spoke of his
disappointment at Murrayfield nine days earlier when he was stripped and
ready to substitute for the injured Gavin Hastings in the last minute of
the game against Romania.
Glasgow, as cover for both wings and full back, had expected to come
on for his first cap when Hastings went down hurt, but the management
decided that the younger Hastings, Scott, should take over from the
Scottish captain.
''When Gavin got injured I got stripped down by the pitch. Then coach
Dougie Morgan told me to wait. Scott went on instead. Words can't
describe how I felt . . .
''If I had got on for the final minute then it would have been
fantastic, but I wouldn't have looked upon it as a true cap. I had a
fraught few days afterwards but you just have to accept these things.''
During the 1989 tour to Japan, Glasgow played in the non-cap Test and
scored 66 points in two games. He also went on the 1993 tour to the
South Pacific. The Cambridge University Blue, whose father, Ron, played
at wing-forward for Scotland, has undoubtedly suffered because of his
versatility. He has played top-level rugby at every position behind the
scrum save scrum half.
He first sat on the Scotland bench against Fiji in 1989 and, because
of replacement duties with the national side, has played just
half-a-dozen games since Christmas.
''Tomorrow's game here in Spain represents my only real chance of
going forward before we go to South Africa for the World Cup. When my
back went on Saturday and I was in doubt for the game, I just thought:
'Get your lucky white heather here!' But this is a real chance for me
and I intend to make the most of it.''
No caps will be awarded in Spain and Glasgow must wait until South
Africa to see whether or not his life's ambition is fulfilled. ''A
Scottish cap is what I have been after all of my life. If it comes in
South Africa then I'll be the happiest man on the continent,'' he said.
For the past three days here in Spain the Scottish squad have been put
through some gruelling fitness sessions by SRU fitness coach David
McLean.
The party have undoubtedly experienced the energy-sapping heat that
they will encounter in South Africa but the altitude factor may yet
prove to be a problem.
The Scottish base, 50km north of Madrid, is at an altitude of some
4000ft, some 2000ft less than that of Pretoria, where they will be based
for the RWC tournament.
However, the intention is to bus the squad over the 2000ft pass just
behind their Navacerrada base and to stage a number of work-out sessions
there.
Coach Dougie Morgan said: ''We will be going up to 6000ft over the
next few days and that will give us a marker as to how the boys feel at
that altitude.''
The Scots know little about today's opposition but Morgan is keen that
his side continue with the expansive brand of rugby which served them so
well in the Five Nations' tournament.
''Our style has been developed over the last three months and I see no
reason why we should change now. The good thing, though, is that
everybody is now well and truly clued in to what it is we are trying to
do.''
Yesterday the forwards carried out a live scrummaging session during
which captain for the day, Kevin McKenzie, was in direct opposition to
Martin Scott, another newcomer to the Spanish party. Kenny Milne has not
recovered from the stomach bug which laid him low at home and Orrell
hooker Scott flew in on Sunday night with Stark.

HEADS have finally fallen at Barings, with the departure of 21 top
executives from the company, now part of the Dutch ING group.
They include Peter Norris, formerly chief executive of Baring
Investment Bank, Mary Waltz, head of equity derivatives, Anthony Hawes,
group treasurer, and James Bax, regional manager Southeast Asia and
immediate superior in Singapore of Nick Leeson, the trader who brought
the group down.
''Those leaving comprise the executives of Barings with functional
responsibility (whether direct or indirect) for the Singapore
derivatives business,'' said Hessel Lindenbergh, chairman of Baring
Holding Company.
Up until now the only people actually to resign were Peter Baring and
Andrew Tuckey, respectively chairman and deputy chairman.
The sackings were not carried out before because ING wanted to wait
until the Board of Banking Supervision had submitted its report into the
Barings disaster. With this not now expected until next month at the
earliest ING thought further delay would be damaging. Most of those
going are on short-term contracts and will receive the compensation they
were entitled to.
Mr Lindenbergh said that their own review had concluded that the
losses in Singapore were extraordinary and not endemic.
''It is a problem we have put behind us,'' he said. ''We now turn our
attention to the future.''
The task is to restore fully the pre-eminence of the Baring name. This
will be the job of Clarke Gray, who has been appointed chief executive
of Baring Brothers and Barings Securities International.

IS IT a rock show? Is it a circus? Is it a cabaret? GOSH -- what is
it? Coming from Berlin, where audiences have been jumping through hoops
to get tickets, GOSH is hectically live entertainment for the
channel-zapping generation. For once there is no need to play
five-finger exercises on the remote control: just sit back and let your
eyes do the shifting and mixing. For with GOSH, nothing happens in
isolation.
Time was, if you went to a concert, a variety show or a circus -- and
the company offers elements of all three -- you saw one act at a time.
On would come the juggler and gradually up the ante from three clubs to
a whole hand of glittering knives or flaming torches. He'd go off and
not be seen again until the curtain call. The same with singers, clowns,
whoever. But GOSH don't play it by numbers.
''We're trying to get one big clap -- at the end!'' says
French-Canadian director Michel Dallaire who, among other things, has
worked with Archaos. A show like Shak Edi Bobo -- now at Glasgow's
Tramway -- is meant to flow like a piece of theatre.
''We've broken up the numbers, the routines, so that things happen
just as they happen in life, unexpectedly maybe. Bits overlapping. Or
happening simultaneously. A piece of ropework . . . a piece of trapeze .
. . the musicians getting involved with some of the other characters.
Three or four different focuses. And the audience catch sight of them.
Just like in real life. You look around -- see things happening. Decide
what to watch.''
His particular input comes with the characterisation that gives the
show its particular flavour -- the technical rehearsal of circus skills
is handled by someone else.
''The performers decide on the characters themselves. After all, they
have to live with them. And it could be for maybe two years if a show
goes on tour. For Shak Edi Bobo we had workshop sessions just to develop
the characters. Then we started putting it altogether.''
It's this intense characterisation -- which has spread to include the
musicians -- that has helped to create a fresh and appealing framework
for what are, essentially, traditional skills.
Dallaire agrees that, following the advent of TV into so many homes,
live circus lost its frisson of excitement for audiences. If the skills
were to survive as more than bygone memories, they needed to re-invent
themselves. What GOSH has done is locate humour, music -- ''rock'n'roll
sounds of the seventies, loud,'' says Dallaire with obvious satisfaction
-- and theatricality in a bizarre dreamworld peopled by curious, even
maniacal folk.
Despite his enthusiasm for what GOSH does, Dallaire's childhood
ambition did not include running away to join the circus. Perhaps if he
had encountered UFA Fabrik at an impressionable age, he might have been
tempted to change his mind. UFA Fabrik is a name that covers a
fascinating range of activities. Back in 1972 a small group of seven
people started up a free commune in the then derelict UFA Film Studios
in Berlin. ''Free'' referred to the absence of any one set of beliefs or
organised religion: the aim was to live together, work together, laugh
together.
Across the years this commune has expanded into an energetic
collection of musicians, dancers, acrobats, clowns, and craftspeople who
take a real delight in sharing their skills and their enthusiasm -- not
least with children.
And that's what lies ahead for a group of young Glaswegians when UFA
Fabrik's Children's Circus comes to town this weekend. Local children
are being invited to take part in a host of workshops -- juggling, belly
dancing, acrobatics, and so forth -- before joining forces with the
German youngsters (whose ages range from seven to 16) in two special
performances by the circus.
With this year's Mayfest embracing the 50th anniversary of VE-Day, it
seems particularly happy timing -- and very much at one with UFA
Fabrik's ideals -- to have Scottish and German children learning how to
work creatively together, how to have fun together, and to share that
fun with others.
* GOSH presents Shak Edi Bobo at Tramway until Saturday May 13 (not
Mondays or Tuesdays) while UFA Fabrik's Children's Circus can be seen at
The Tramway on Sunday 7th and Monday, May 8, at 2.30pm.

Baptism of fire
IT has taken quite a lot of time and trouble to obtain an original
work for the Royal Ballet from William Forsythe, the New York
choreographer now based in Frankfurt. In the event, the New Forsythe
Ballet is a triple collaboration, as Forsythe has enlisted the help of
Dana Caspersen and Antony Rizzi, colleagues from Frankfurt.
Firstext -- and no, that's not a misspelling -- is an exciting and
challenging piece that keeps the audience guessing, and on the wrong
foot from the beginning.
As the Covent Garden audience assembles, the work has already begun.
The curtain is up and stagehands are supervising the hanging of white
curtains that will occupy both back and sides of the stage. The words
''The Organisation of Culture'' are projected on the back screen.
Suddenly the house lights are extinguished, and while the audience are
still trying to reach their seats, a line of flames appears at the back
of the stage. When the lights come up again, both on stage and in the
auditorium, Sylvie Guillem leads a sextet of dancers through 25 minutes
of deconstructed dance: spasms of movement which are vibrant with energy
and full of electric and emotional excitement.
Firstext slides almost unobtrusively into an earlier work, Steptext
(1985), by Forsythe alone. It's perhaps easier to appreciate. It's set
to fragments of a Bach violin chaconne and is full of characteristic
aggression and acrobatic brutality. These are major acquisitions for the
company.
By contrast, Tetley's La Ronde and Ashton's Rhapsody seem colourless,
despite winning performances in the second of these which also features
boldly successful new designs by Patrick Caulfield.

<TEXT>
THE theatre was once a place where an audience could work through its
anxieties about life's great moral dilemmas. The grand ambition of On
the Piste is to let an audience work through its insecurities about
winter leisure pursuits.
Or at least so it seems until playwright John Godber stops clowning
around on the slopes and starts delving into his characters' sexual
make-up. For the analogy he is striving to make is that the fantasies,
insecurities, and bravado of the novice skier are akin to all the same
delusions of our sexual selves.
The chances of Tom Watt, playing voice-over man Chris Baxter, ever
making it down the highest Austrian ski slope are pretty much equal to
the chances of him ever pulling Amanda Fawsett's idly rich Melissa
Southern.
He believes, of course, he can do both.
The problem I have with Godber, though, is that he spends far too long
wallowing in the attitudes he would appear to condemn. In this
production directed by Bob Tomson the acting is alarmingly believable.
Virginia Fiol, playing the dim-but-eager-to-please Beverley Ryan,
could easily be warming up for a role in a Mike Leigh movie.
But the play asks us to laugh along with the loutish behaviour of the
English abroad before it tells us that such behaviour is immature and
sexually repressed.
This kind of humour is unsatisfying, and it is telling that On the
Piste is at its funniest when it drops the boarishness and touches on
our deepest sexual insecurities.
Though the audience lapped it all up regardless, I spent too long
waiting for Godber not simply to show us these characters but to do
something with them.

MIXED feelings about this one; as an example of indulgent theatre it
would be hard to beat but it's impossible to fault on the humour front.
After all, as the title blatantly reminds us, Chekhov penned this trio
to raise a few chuckles. The Cherry Orchard they ain't.
So, yes, much of the melodramatic declamation, the preposterous props
(big furry mitts in The Bear, puleeze) and the onstage mugging -- Callum
Cuthbertson, you are charged with stealing the show -- all adds up to an
in-joke of serious magnitude but doubtless the Arches Theatre Company
would shrug ''hands up'' and ask for 22 other offences to be taken into
consideration.
The company have cultivated the kind of faithful following which
allows them to embark on such a mad fiasco. The timing might have been
weak but they were playing to their strengths.
They've more than proved their mettle on the serious drama front -- as
evinced in their forthcoming reprise of The Crucible -- but when it
comes to character acting they can't be beat.
Artistic director Andy Arnold had only to step onstage to cause a
minor uproar and director Graham Hunter's decision to introduce him as a
face peering vacantly out of a muggy window in The Bear was the
equivalent of a theatrical tour de force.
The adaptations are a po-mo scream, a mixture of gallus Glaswegian and
pukka English which cater to the cast's predilections, giving us Arnold
as a Cockney in The Bear -- ''yer 'usband's sniffed it and that's that''
-- a Cowardesque hypochondriac in The Proposal and a nasty-suited spiv
in The Wedding. How we spluttered in the aisles.

IT was either an act of spur-of-the-moment resourcefulness or merely
yet another artful and tabloid-friendly instance of self-promoting
mock-shock-horror.
Judge the behaviour of studiedly controverisal Hole frontwoman
Courtney Love for yourself as you re-live last night's moral conundrum.
Having spotted a Pearl Jam t-shirt amid the heaving throng, America's
most famous living widow states that respect for her departed husband,
Kurt Cobain, is incompatible with liking such weedy Nirvana plagiarists
as Pearl Jam.
She pledges to pay substantial amounts to all those who remove said
t-shirts. Not unnaturally, one soon flops on to the stage.
Courtney is now faced with a dilemma: her stage outfit of suspenders,
stockings, transparent negligee and black body don't got no pockets! She
hasn't got any cash.
Courtney's solution to this problem? To wriggle in a relatively
non-revelatory fashion out of her panties -- ''goddam expensive Italian
panties, you can sell 'em'' -- and hand them out to the shirtless
ex-Pearl Jam fan, carefully re-fastening her body at the same time.
My question to you is three-fold: is removing one's pants in public
acting like a trollop, and does Courtney Love habitually act like a
trollop because she is appropriating repressive gender-fascist imagery
in a bold and positive post-feminist statement of empowerment, or does
she act like a trollop because acting like a trollop is good for
business?
The latter, methinks. What else did I learn last night? That Jock-rock
to Courtney and Co means Big Country, Happy Birthday by Altered Images,
the Mary Chain and the Bay City Rollers.
''My favourite was Les,'' Courtney told us.
But hey, Mister so-called Critic Man, I hear you cry, you have failed
to mention Hole's music.
Oh aye, that. It was stop-go, meandering, sloppy, unsatisfactory.
Pants with saggy elastic.

With both feet firmly on the ground, Sue Tranter learns how to get a
break into the heady world of modelling
THERE'S a common misconception that all it takes to become a
successful model is waif-like good looks and an empty head. Armed with
these two essential requirements, all the would-be catwalk star needs to
do is wait to be discovered.
In reality, however, it takes a lot more than a pretty face to be a
professional model with a diary full of working appointments.
Attitude seems to be the most important attribute according to two of
Glasgow's model agents. ''Girls who don't approach the job with lots of
enthusiasm and ready to make an effort usually fall by the wayside,''
says Shelagh Davis.
Michelle Lean from the Best Agency agrees. ''It's no good thinking it
will all be easy and you can just get up on a cat-walk and prance
about,'' says Michelle, herself a former successful model.
''If you want to make a living in Scotland you have to take on
promotion jobs, which can be long, hard work.''
But for anyone who is determined to follow in the footsteps of Carol
Smillie, once a Glasgow model, then joining a reputable agency is the
best plan.
Agencies should be licenced by the Department of Employment, while
some like The Model Team run by Shelagh Davis, are members of the
Association of Model Agents.
According to Shelagh, who has been running her agency since she gave
up modelling herself, there are rules on both sides which agent and
model should stick to.
''We don't charge for lessons and we advise girls on reliable
photographers who will help them get together the essential portfolio
and index card. We also give them lessons -- it takes about 12 months
before a girl is really properly trained.
''In return, a girl must be prepared to go around and see
photographers or clients. She must have some ideas when she tests for
work, and she needs enthusiasm.''
Girls must also put together a card which can cost up to #150,
depending on the number of photographs used and the quality.
She must also have the basic accessory bag, which no model would be
without. Shelagh has girls from around 14 upwards, and finds that work
falls into different categories. Some might be ideal for catwalk jobs
while others are more suited to advertising or fashion photography.
She also likes girls to be 5ft 8ins tall, though not all agencies are
quite so specific.
But all agree that work in Scotland has been hit by the recession and
girls must be flexible. For Shelagh that means sending girls to London
through an arrangement with another agency. For most would-be models
this is hardly a sacrifice.
Iris Ferguson, sister of footballer of Duncan Ferguson, is one busy
model who is about to return to Scotland after working in London.
Petra Drummond another Scottish girl who is never short of asignments,
has also been working in London for some time but returns home
regularly.
Shelagh describes the Model Team as the ''mother agency'' for girls
who commute.
Fees in Scotland are also smaller, but girls can still earn up to
#45-an-hour, from which Shelagh takes 20 per cent.
The long-term prospects for most models are not as bleak as often
painted, and many girls continue taking jobs for some years. Shelagh
also runs a team of ''classic'' models, who show off clothes for the
more mature woman.
One successful long-term model is Fiona Campbell, who now works as a
free-lance dodging from job to job on a busy day with the support of a
mobile phone.
She began her career with The Model Team and reccommends that any
newcomer starts out with an agent. ''It's the best way to get experience
and contacts,'' says Fiona.
''It may be worth working on your own later but most of the really
good girls start with an agent.
While modelling isn't seen as a full-time career for men, agents are
always on the look out for photogenic males. And it can prove a
long-term way to supplement an income or, in the short term, a student
grant.
You may not end up a super model but there is money to be made for a
model with attitude. Provided it's the right one.

EDINBURGH department store Jenners will next week begin the #2.25m
exterior refurbishment of its ornately-carved building in Princes Street
-- which is 100 years old this month.
Jenners, whose profits in the year to end-January were hit by a
one-off charge for the work, does not expect sales to be affected by the
presence of scaffolding.
With acidic pigeon droppings having exacerbated the general weathering
of the soft stone, some of the carvings will have to be restored with
the aid of old photographs.
The work, fully provided for in Friday's results' statement for the 12
months to end-January, will take 18 months.
Edinburgh-based Watson Stonecraft will lead the project, with the
Michael Laird Partnership employed as architects.
Initially, Jenners had considered doing the work in stages, so the
entire building would not be surrounded by scaffolding. However, it
ultimately decided to half the timescale by tackling the refurbishment
as a whole.
Jenners, a family business set up more than 150 years ago, has been
weighing up the project for three years.
Company secretary Stanley Reid said: ''It is bound to have some effect
on the way we trade but it shouldn't affect the figures at all.''
The current Jenners store was opened in May 1895 -- having been
rebuilt after a fire in 1893.
Jenners provided for #80,000 of the refurbishment cost a couple of
years ago. It charged the remaining #2.17m in the year to end-January --
#110,000 of which related to money already spent.
Disregarding this exceptional charge, pre-tax profits fell from #3.85m
to #3.56m.
However, Jenners spent about #250,000 on its warehouse, which is near
the Murrayfield rugby stadium, and a further #750,000 on the store
itself during the year.
In its previous financial year, the comparable level of expenditure
was about #500,000. A greater proportion of refurbishment costs were
written off to the profit and loss account last year -- masking the
underlying rise in earnings.
Mr Reid said Jenners, unlike a lot of others, was comfortably ahead
year-on-year in the first three months of its new reporting period.
However, trading remains sluggish, patchy and below the company's high
expectations.
The name of Jenners is undoubtedly an attraction to tourists, although
this business is viewed as the icing on the cake.
Mr Reid, who predicted another good year for the store, expects fewer
North American visitors because of US and Canadian dollar weakness.
However, with the Japanese yen and German mark still trouncing other
currencies on the foreign exchanges, more European and Far Eastern
tourists are expected.
Touching on the elusive feel-good factor, Mr Reid said: ''There is no
doubt the economy is improving but I think people are unwilling to
believe it.''
However, he expects trade to gather steam as the year continues.
Jenners in Princes Street, Edinburgh is 100 years old this month.

ZAPPING aimlessly around the TV channels, the other night, I suddenly
fell on Ginger Rogers, and here, in the Omnibus tribute, was serendipity
indeed. Spinning, floating, dipping, flying across the screen, one hand
in Astaire's, the other balletically stroking the air, Ginger was proof
that humankind needs deities. Quite simply they were gods, a matchless
pair whose skill was not just magical but witty, and what they
bequeathed, by way of film, is perhaps the most graceful definition we
have of the thirties.
In Flying Down to Rio, when Fred and Ginger take to the floor to
demonstrate the carioca, she turns to him, displaying that bold
beauty-spot on her chin, and says: ''We'll show'em a thing or two.'' And
that's precisely what they did: that puny, bashful chap and the cheeky
radiant blonde from the bottle, with a sardonic grin, together they
turned the musical into a form of American poetry, unprecious but every
elegant twist and turn exhilarating to behold.
But seeing Fred and Ginger now points up the crude strut of our own
dance-floor scene. Am I alone in remembering Come Dancing as a family
show offering frenzied, innocent escapism and the strength of the common
touch? Well, the common touch prevails but the gliding innocence of Fred
and Ginger fantasies are lost. Today, the Modern Latin American medley
seems to engage each partner in dazzling self-love and a jiggle with
sin.
Blame obviously lies with the costumes -- or rather the
next-to-nothings which pass for costumes these days. Ginger's sexiness
was souffle-light, clad in gowns of marvellous fluidity and grace. What
we have now are G-string variations stitched on to skin-tone leotards,
all that jolly tulle chastity of yesteryear having been ousted by the
couture of a Babylonian strip-joint.
Who actually makes these creations? Surely not the dancers' mothers,
unless dancers' mothers, like everyone else, have gone to the dogs. And
those blokes trussed up like Spanish dancers, clever padding used tautly
to emphasise the buttocks . . . what do they tell us about the changing
industrial profile of Britain? The sheet metal worker, once king of the
palais on a Friday night, has not merely lost his job, he has been
evicted from beneath the revolving mirrored ball by prancing
hair-stylists, double-glazers, and co-ordinated bathroom salesmen.
How interesting, though, that a revival in the dances of the thirties
is building now among a new generation tired of lonely, solo gyrations
to ear-perforating rock. Here, and in America, halls are filled with
kids eager to learn the ''touch dancing'' of the big band era: Side,
together, forward. Side, together, back. Quick, quick, slow . . . These
words, explaining the secret of the box step, are becoming the repeated
anthem of the student campus, marking the beginning of fluency in the
old-fashioned body language of seduction. But according to one
instructor the aim for the young is not only the practice of orthodox
dancing but the learning of social poise and how to hold another person
politely.
Meanwhile the tender caress of tea dances continues to lure those
whose patent slippers and bluebell taffetas have seen honourable service
over decades. In hotel ballrooms, throughout the land, folk quickstep
and waltz and talk about their memories of how, long ago, they were
caught in the arms of their own Fred or Ginger. In the world's largest
ballroom, Roseland in New York, elderly women with rinsed hair and
sequins pay a dollar or so to share the nimble footwork and swaying
expertise of professional partners who, for a few minutes, will swell
their customers' bosoms with gratitude and zest.
Years ago I had a landlady whose whole existence revolved around her
ballroom days. Several times a week she would emerge from her room to
stand on the stairs in her diamante and georgette, willing admiration
from lacklustre tenants. On returning home, cheeks flushed with triumph,
she would wrap her satin pumps in tissue paper, and observe mysteriously
that the tango, dears, is not at all the simple thing it seems.
Scorning the ups and downs of the world outside, the afternoon of the
tea dance, wherever enacted, softens life by blocking out the daylight
with peachy-coloured lamps . . . Downstairs by the cloakrooms an elderly
man is calling through the door of the Ladies to his partner: ''Rene,
quickly, it's the foxtrot.'' Back on the dance floor the hard-earned
fatigue of age slips away as the orchestra plays and earrings glint.
Somewhere a heart is pounding. The Fred and Ginger dream commences, and
perfume mingles with ferocious hope.

AFTER months of public inquiry, we in Harris are getting another
chance to vote on the proposed Lingerabay superquarry. Ballot papers are
going out as I write. A previous referendum in 1993 found Harris voters
in favour of Lingerabay -- though the Obbe ward, its actual locus, voted
very narrowly against. Few expect a repetition. All the signs are that
the Harris people will now repudiate Redland Aggregates and their
superquarry, and decisively.
Such an outcome, I believe, would be disastrous. It could be the final
deathblow for Harris as a living human community. I intend to vote for
the superquarry and for the Redlands development -- subject to all the
safeguards painfully won by our local leaders in 1993 -- and I am going
to tell you why.
Harris desperately needs the work. Unemployment here is high, and male
employment opportunities especially are scarce. One may view Redland's
more exuberant claims of job prospects with scepticism -- the 80, 70, 60
jobs once brandished are unlikely to materialise for a good few years.
But even two dozen jobs could make a critical difference to Harris as a
whole and South Harris in particular.
It is, I believe, the quarry or bust. The population of Harris is in
free fall. In terms of raw figures, we lose some 60 to 70 people every
passing year -- mostly deaths; a few school leavers making off for study
or work on the mainland. Incomers apart, we acquire perhaps a dozen
annual babies. No more.
Two of our six primary schools hover on the brink of closure; their
rolls are in single figures. We are not only a shrinking population: we
are elderly. The average Harris adult is over 60. The North Harris
medical practice has the highest proportion of nonogenarians of any in
Britain. In the seven years since the present doctor arrived, the roll
has fallen by hundreds of people.
A point in depopulation comes when communities are so small, so old,
so lonely, so repressive that no young person will stay for all the
prospects in creation.
Two or three years ago, this was obvious. And so the Harris folk
expressed vociferous support for the Lingerabay scheme. What, since
1993, has sown fear where there was hope?
One factor is the flatfooted performance of Redland Aggregates
themselves. Diplomacy has not been the company's strong point. Too
often, executives have been patronising, evasive, tactless, or plain
rude.
But, much worse, there has been a failure in leadership. There was
cowardice in high places. Our Labour MP was nowhere to be seen. Our
councillors were embarrassing. Until 1993, the council as a whole
refused to be involved. The parcel stopped with an ad-hoc working group
of community leaders. Until after the last ballot these men and women
worked hard and long to advocate local interests and preserve an open
mind on the Lingerabay development.
But committees have their own dynamic. They are apt to take on a will
of their own. And, in the past two years -- with the best of intentions,
yet in plain defiance of the 1993 plebiscite -- the Quarry Benefits
Group, as it is now called, has become openly hostile to the Lingerabay
scheme. All pretence of neutrality has been abandoned. And, through the
long months of public inquiry, that failure to perform responsibly has
badly distorted events.
The inquiry has been profoundly depressing. Forced at the behest of
outsiders -- massively wealthy environmental groups, the Scottish
Natural Heritage quango, scores of letters from Sassenaich throughout
Britain -- it has become a three-ring circus at the sole expense of the
Western Isles Islands Council and its hapless taxpayers. And, day after
day, week after week, cranks, weirdos and pundits of every hue have
queued to retail apocalyptic prospects for Harris if Lingerabay goes
ahead.
One South Harris objector -- living very nicely on his police pension,
thank you -- painted a bloodcurdling picture of a vast pall of dust from
quarry operations, shrouding South Harris in perpetual gloom, clogging
the lungs of children and stunting their growth. Others have claimed
that blasting will bring down the historic St Clement's church -- and so
on, and so forth.
We rightly expected the Quarry Benefits Group to cross-examine all
such claims and allegations, acting as our agents and without fear or
favour, and with like rigour grilling advocates of the Redland
development. But they haven't. The group's precognition to the inquiry
dealt solely with the nightmares of quarry development, and mentioned
not at all such benefits as the Lingerabay project would bring to
Harris.
Certain episodes leave a bad taste in the mouth. The Labour MP, his
constituency party, and the Lewis branch of the SNP have suddenly (after
years of sniffing the wind) come out against the development. So has the
local councillor for Obbe. This is not leadership: it is abdication.
Well, my ballot will arrive shortly. I will vote for the superquarry.
I will vote ''Yes'' because the present is no longer an option.
We cannot preserve the Harris of now in aspic. We cannot let the fear
of change paralyse us. But if we vote this last chance down, prepare for
an empty island. And in that day, go to Lingerabay and scream despair
into the wind, for only the wind will be left to listen.

PERM any one or two from three. According to the London-based
newspapers yesterday, the Tory Government is determined to push ahead
with the privatisation of the nuclear power industry, because the
controversial plan to sell the railways has been dropped (The Guardian).
Or it has shelved plans to sell the UK's air traffic control system,
because enough money can be raised from the sale of the railways and
nuclear power combined (Financial Times).
May has dawned hot. And, with the political temperature rising
following the Tory slaughter at the local polls in Scotland and further
carnage pencilled in for this Thursday south of the Border, speculation
about how the Government can dig itself out of the deep hole it is now
in is becoming feverish, too.
Scottish Nuclear executives seem convinced their fate could be sealed
within the week. A senior railman I talked to the other day remains
convinced Railtrack will be sold and the operating franchises put in
place before another year is out. I haven't talked to anyone in air
traffic control recently, so I cannot vouchsafe that the FT's prediction
is shared by those who run that system.
But regardless of which permutation eventually comes out in the
political wash, this final privatisation push looks more and more like
terminal political panic, egged on by City advisers who see one of their
major gravy trains of recent years hitting the buffers, if a Blair-led
Labour Party, shorn of Clause 4, matches current poll predictions and
gets itself elected.
The people who said nuclear power was unsellable in 1989 are now
falling over each other to prove the converse and get their hands on
some of the resultant fees, a source of income threatened by a Blair
victory.
In last November's Red Book, the Treasury put the trend in
privatisation proceeds as follows. The #6100m raised in 1993/94 would be
followed by a forecast #5900m in 1994/95 (the financial year recently
ended). The figure pencilled in for this year, 1995/96, was #3600m, with
the numbers then tailing off to #2000m in 1996/97, #1000m in 1997/98 and
nothing at all in 1998/99.
These forecast figures, particularly for the years 1995 to 1998, had
been revised sharply downwards from forecasts in the previous Red Book,
in all by some #5000m. But that was November. If ministers are now
determined to sell off both nuclear power and the railways within a
year, they are looking to raise much more than #3600m in short order,
perhaps as much as #6000m.
Why? The cynical explanation is that the money is needed to restore
order to the public finances and fund a few pence off the standard rate
of income tax before a snap election in the latter half of next year.
You might have thought they would have neither the brass neck nor the
naivety to pull such a stunt.
But last week's background noise of civil servants cobbling together
further tariff cuts for electricity consumers to smooth the path towards
a quick nuclear sell-off should disabuse you of that.
First, John Major himself trailed plans to bring the so-called fossil
fuel levy to an early end. It should really be called the nuclear levy
since the lion's share of its #1000m plus proceeds each year go to
subsidise the eventual decommissioning of nuclear stations at the end of
their generating lives. It is levied on electricity bills in England and
Wales. But not in Scotland.
Here, an equivalent subsidy is built into the price ScottishPower and
Hydro-Electric pay Scottish Nuclear for the entire output of Hunterston
B and Torness, under a supply contract which runs until 2005. With the
Prime Minister hinting that the levy in the south could be scrapped next
year, rather than 1998 as originally planned, the Scottish Office has
been put to work to devise an equivalent sweetener for consumers in
Scotland.
Under the Scottish supply formula, the price Scottish Nuclear is paid
for its power is already being squeezed and is due to reach pool
(market) rates by 1998. According to a press release rushed out by the
Scottish Office late on Friday afternoon, over the period 1994 to 1998,
that price reduction ''will be worth around 8% in real terms to
franchise electricity customers''.
If ministers decide to phase out the hidden Scottish Nuclear subsidy
early, on the same date the nuclear levy goes in England and Wales, the
Scottish Office prediction is that ''At that point, assuming the
reduction was passed on by the electricity supply companies to their
franchise customers, it is estimated there would be a reduction of
around three to four per cent in electricity prices to these consumers,
in addition to the reduction which will already have been passed on by
them.''
Note that assumption that the reduction will be passed on. Note how
tentative Ian Lang's number crunchers are in their calculation. There
isn't even agreement within the industry that the figures are correct.
And whether the final tariff cut in Scotland is 2%, 3% or 4%, how will
it look, in comparative terms, in real pounds and pence, against the
ending of the 10%-plus nuclear levy, shown separately on every bill
south of the Border?
Do we have another poll tax in the making here? The way the saga is
panning out at present, Scottish public opinion will be asked to swallow
the effective demise of Scottish Nuclear to get a merged nuclear
industry off the Government's hands before the next election. But if we
are expected to do that, and accept a more modest sweetener on our
electricity bills than is on offer in the south, the April Tory rout
will be a mere taster of much rougher treatment to come.
Of course, in their mounting electoral panic, the Tories may already
have written Scotland off. But I doubt even differential bribery in
England will save their skins. In its present mood, the British public
is likely to take the tariff and tax cuts and boot them out of office
anyway.
Turning the tail-end of the Thatcher-inspired programme of
privatisation into an unseemly dash for the wherewithal to buy back lost
votes is a tawdry end to a period which, whether you approve of it or
not, has wrought significant change in all of us.

TRY as it might during Mayfest, Glasgow still fails to come across as
a truly European festive city. And whom do we have to thank for this?
Step forward, for their umpteenth Mayfest Fun Prevention Award, the
Glasgow Licensing Board and officials.
The idea of Mayfest is that the city loosens its stays, everyone goes
out to shows, and then stays out a bit later than normal. The licensing
board have as usual taken a dim view of this.
They have been grudgingly handing out meagre one-hour extensions to
normal pub closing times but only with strict conditions. One publican
who wanted to stay open the extra hour was told it wasn't allowed
because he had not laid on a programme of late-night music.
Even the Mayfest Club itself was a target of the licensing board. It
is the late-night heart of the festival and has a wonderful location in
the old Fruitmarket where people can meet with artists and performers
when their night's work is done. The board wanted the club to close at
1am and only the intervention of a senior labour politician has allowed
it to remain open until the ungodly hour of 3am.
Other venues have not been so lucky. The Blackfriars pub have gone to
great lengths to turn their cellar bar into a reincarnation of the
KitKat Club of decadent Berlin 1930s fame. But just how decadent can you
be when the lights go on and it's up the road at 1am?
Down to earth
NOW that the nights are fair drawin' oot, what better pursuit can
there be but a bit of sex in Glasgow's Botanic Gardens?
Calm down you chaps in he raincoats, what we're actually talking about
here is a Mayfest production which begins in the gardens tomorrow night.
It is Linnaeus, Prince of Flowers and offers us the chance to
''encounter the darker side of plant life in the company of Carl
Linnaeus, the great Scandinavian botanist who will prove to us all that
plants have fantastic sex . . . it promises to be an orgy of the senses
and a riot for the mind. You'll never see a plant in the same way
again.''
Who knows, you might get a lumber with a dahlia.
Out for the count
PLEASE excuse this excess of arty-farty stuff, but it is Mayfest and
we found ourselves in the CCA gallery in Sauchiehall Street at an
exhibition called Evening Echoes. It is a collection of photographs of
evening paper vendors from 23 British cities with a soundtrack of their
sundry sales cries.
The artists say they ''are concerned with exploring the magic of the
supposedly mundane''. They have certainly got the mundane bit right.
What should have been a deeply fascinating topic is rendered anodyne.
The photographs are competent but unexceptional; the soundtrack verges
at times on the poetic but ends up plain dull.
The vibrancy of the evening paper vendor as we used to know them is
missing. Perhaps they are now too busy handing out free Wispa bars and
packets of crisps with the newspapers.
There is little of the spirit these days of Jackie Green, the
legendary vendor of the Evening Citizen in Glasgow in the 1950s and
1960s. Jackie's rough and penetrating tones could be heard advertising
stories that often were not in the newspaper. ''Terrible, horrible
murder!'' he would cry. Alternating with ''Terrible, horrible rape!''
But Jackie was not without subtlety. ''Big city fraud! Twenty-three
victims!'' he would shout and, after selling another newspaper
containing not a jot about any fraud, would continue: ''Big city fraud!
Twenty-four victims!''
Tale of unexpected
WE return to the subject of Carrick Cumnock, MP for Brigadoon, the
mythical Ayrshire politician who may yet be the Last Tory in Scotland.
Steve Bearne of Giffnock professes to be a bit of an expert on the life
and times of Mr Cumnock:
''Born the fifth child of an Ayrshire miner, he left school at 16 to
work with the mentally handicapped. After marrying his childhood
sweetheart, he became involved in local politics when he led a
successful campaign to save the local mine from closure.
''He scored a landslide victory in the 1979 elections on a platform of
social justice. A vociferous critic of water and rail privatisation, and
supporter of an independent Scotland, he refused a position in the
Cabinet to concentrate on the promotion of better treatment for single
mothers.
''When questioned about a complete absence of entries in the members'
register of interests, he said that his salary as an MP was quite enough
and, anyway, he was too busy looking after his constituents.''
Mr Bearne adds: ''I have just realised that I have left something out.
The above should begin 'Once upon a time . . .'.''
Following on
THE following letter arrived at Irvine Development Corporation, sent
by one Bishop Wilson K Kigen who runs Kipkigen Management Services Ltd
in Eldama-Ravine, Kenya. He wrote:
''This is to inform you after reading your message of Irvine
Development Corporation which you started in a small premises like 4000
squ ft and go on with bigger and bigger dreams until you had more than
1000 workers touched my mind and dream.
''With that message, I am now requesting you to send us your Freephone
Irvine Information. This Our Company started in 1992 and 1993 we went on
forming and we lost more than #12,000 when the rain was not there in
that year. We therefore need to ask/know other business which can help
our company to grow from zero to even 1000 workers.
''In August 1st I will be attending the Stoneleigh Bible week in
England, and I may pope in to your business.''
We give you the above not to make invidious comparisons about the
difference in skill levels of Scottish and Kenyan businesses. Merely to
say is it not nice that someone believes an Irvine advert?

EUAN Moir, the men's scratch Parbusters champion of 1992, may have
booked himself another tilt at the crown this year with a score of minus
7 on the first of our 16 qualifying weeks.
The 26-year-old son of Hamilton professional Maurice carded a gross 67
in his club's April Medal against a competition scratch score of 74 --
up three from the standard -- and it will be a surprise if that is not
still within the top 10 come August.
Playing off scratch, Moir is used to seeing his good scores bettered
by lower net ones of higher handicappers, but not on this occasion. In
windy conditions, and on bumpy greens, he amassed birdies at the third,
fifth, tenth, eleventh, and thirteenth, countered by bogeys at the
twelfth and fifteenth, to beat 117 other competitors.
''I think it's the first time I have managed to beat all the
handicappers, and if I qualify for the Parbusters final, I'll certainly
be at Haggs Castle to try again,'' said Moir, whose brother Michael was
among our finalists last year.
Euan had started the season at plus one, and his score has returned
him to that mark, setting him up nicely for a crack at national amateur
tournaments this year, including the Scottish Amateur, Mid-amateur, and
Scottish Strokeplay championships.
In the women's scratch section, veteran Curtis Cup player Belle
Robertson leads the way this week with a Parbusters score of plus three
compiled at Troon.
There is no outright bandit of the week, but there are two minus 10s
in men's handicap -- unlikely to be good enough for the final -- and the
women handicappers are clearly still warming up with no-one lower than
minus 4. Leading scores:

* This week's tip comes from KEVIN PHILLIPS, the professional at
Winterfield Golf Club, Dunbar.
ONE of the most terrifying shots in golf is the chip shot over a
bunker from a bare lie. Worry sets in, and the player faces the twin
dangers of either fluffing the shot into the trap, or thinning the ball
through the green.
My tip to the handicap player is to take the wrists out of the action.
It is a less risky shot just to use hands and arms.
With the weight anchored on the left side, and the stance open,
concentrate on sliding the club through the ball. The loft of the club
-- and a sand iron is the best choice -- will do the work.
It is possible to achieve a good result with a lot of wrist action,
but it makes it much more difficult to execute the shot successfully.
Plenty of practice is the other key. That will help gain the
confidence needed to eliminate the fear factor.

THE group of seven Swedes who finished in the top 20 of the Helen Holm
Trophy at Troon at the weekend was the latest sign of the Scandinavian
nation threatening to take over the golfing world.
Already there are Swedes liberally sprinkled through the men's and
women's European Tour, and on the US LPGA Tour. And with the Swedish
men's amateur team taking on Scotland at Loch Lomond yesterday, it was a
chance to learn a few of their secrets.
In attendance was Bo Wickberg, secretary general of the Swedish Golf
Federation, who pointed out that the popular explanation of substantial
government funding was not true. ''The government pays us #200,000 a
year which is just 5% of our income. Sponsorship accounts for another
15% to 20% and the remainder comes from within the sport itself,'' he
said.
The federation is not entirely happy at the extent of this government
funding, and they are campaigning for more. ''Every sports federation
receives funding according to the number of clubs. We have 372 clubs
each with an average of 1000 members. Other sports who receive more than
us have a greater number of clubs but fewer members,'' he said.
So if government funding is not the answer to the Swedes' success,
then what is? It seems the single system which looks after juniors, men
and women, and organises competitions pitting the best amateurs against
the professionals, has much to do with it.
Wickberg, while saying he is not totally familiar with the way things
are organised in Scotland, still expressed surprise at the way the
various groups here operate so independently of each other.
Whereas there is the Golf Foundation for juniors, the Edinburgh-based
Scottish Golf Union for male amateurs, the Prestwick-based Scottish
Ladies Golfing Association for female amateurs, and the Glenbervie-based
PGA in Scotland, the Swedes have just the federation and the PGA who
work closely together.
He added: ''We take care of all golfers right through from the age of
eight or nine, and for the last 12 years we have held competitions for
all age groups.
''The federation is trying to become more involved with the clubs to
encourage and educate. We want to establish better training programmes
and for professionals to be sports instructors in the physical and
mental side as well as technique.''
It is in this latter aspect that Scotland is beginning to catch up
ground with the use by the SLGA and SGU of John Mathers as a physical
and mental fitness trainer.
Beyond the clubs Sweden has established a Teen Tour for players aged
up to 18 and a Junior Tour for the 18-to-21 age group, each with their
own order of merit and for both boys and girls.
Wickberg said that if he was to pick out one reason why Swedes are
performing so well on the world stage, it would be the Scandinavian Tour
which exists for the top players. ''I think it is very important that
the best golfers in our country compete against each other,'' he said.
''It doesn't matter if they are amateurs or professionals.''
Neither is there any sign of the Swedish bubble bursting. There are
now 375,000 golfers in Sweden whereas in 1981 they had just passed the
100,000 mark. There are 70,000 juniors, a third of them girls. Each
registered golfer pays the federation #5 plus each family has an #8 per
year subscription for the 220,000 circulation federation newspaper.
Wickberg was reluctant to pick out any of the Swedes at Loch Lomond as
potential world beaters. ''That wouldn't be fair,'' he said, ''but I
don't mind saying that Maria Hjorth, who won at Troon at the weekend, is
going to be a success.''
Happily, Hjorth, a golf scholarship student at Stirling University, is
a member of the same club as himself, Faluln in central Sweden which
hosted the world cross country skiing championships two years ago.
Snow restricts the golf season there to just six months. It makes you
wonder what the Swedes might achieve if they had good weather all year
round.

ALTHOUGH Hugh McKibbin, the Scottish champion, set an example by
winning both his foursomes and singles, Sweden held a 5-4 lead over
Scotland after the first series of games yesterday at the Loch Lomond
Golf Club in the sixth international between the countries. A familiar
failing caused Scotland's deficit.
Having lost the foursomes 2-1, Scotland rallied to share the singles
3-3, but although the average age of their opponents is little more than
20 this team already has accumulated experience. The same players were
successful in a quadrangular meeting last year against Ireland, Germany,
and France.
The spectacular setting of the course was enhanced by the delightful
spring weather, not immediately appreciated by McKibbin and David
Downie. They lost the first with a bogey, but were five up after 10
holes, having in the interval made six birdies. They won by 4 and 3 but
that was the limit of Scotland's combined efforts.
Stephen Gallacher and Gordon Sherry lost the initiative in the closing
stages of their game, and Graham Rankin and Barclay Howard at the very
start of theirs. Thus Scotland found themselves in the position of
having again to set about retrieving the situation in the singles. They
almost succeeded.
McKibbin, hitting the ball with evident authority after a recent
coaching session with Bob Torrance, demolished Mattias Eliasson,
confirming his own opinion that he is a better match than stroke player.
Successful performances against France and in a Walker Cup squad
training session have sharpened his hopes of a place in this year's
team.
Sherry was four up after only five holes against Martin Erlandsson in
four under par, including an eagle 3 at the third with a 30-yard chip.
But Erlandsson, who in last year's Amateur Championship beat Howard
before losing to Alan Turnbull, took the game to the last after having
won four holes in a row from the twelfth, the last three with birdies.
Howard, who had felt his game losing its edge, lost the first but
eventually took the measure of Fredrik Henge with five birdies in the
next 14 holes. Elsewhere, Gallacher could not recover from having been
four down to Johan Selberg. Downie, two up after eight, stumbled at the
last, and Rankin's man got away after the turn.
Selberg, dormie two, was taken with an urgent call of nature and then
hit two tee shots into the loch beside the seventeenth green, and
Gallacher's 25-foot putt for a birdie 3 at the next to square turned
away over the last few inches. Later, Downie's attempted chip from below
the eighteenth green failed to surface and Daniel Olsson's par
prevailed.
Results:
Foursomes -- S Gallacher and G Sherry lost to V Gustavsson and M
Eliasson, 1 hole; H McKibbin and D Downie beat M Erlandsson and J
Selberg, 4 and 3; G Rankin and B Howard lost to F Henge and D Olsson, 2
and 1.
Singles -- McKibbin beat Eliasson, 5 and 4; Gallacher lost to Selberg,
1 hole; Sherry beat Erlandsson, 1 hole; Downie lost to Olsson, 1 hole;
Howard beat Henge, 5 and 3; Rankin lost to Gustavsson, 3 and 2.

CLYDESDALE Financial Services has revived and expanded its retail
finance business in a difficult market over the past year by targeting
small chains of shops that have not previously offered consumer credit.
The Glasgow-based firm, which arranges personal credit for the
purchase of anything from golf clubs to microwave ovens, has also been
helped by its new Leeds-based owners to obtain more business south of
the Border.
The future looked grim for Clydesdale in March 1994 when its former
owner and main customer, Clydesdale Electrical Stores, went into
receivership.
Although the financial services firm managed to retain all its other
clients, 17 of its 70 staff were laid off.
But a year later, Clydesdale has moved into new modern premises at a
business park in Pollokshields, it is back up to its former strength of
70 employees and business is well ahead of target.
''Our forecast for annual advances was #16.5m, but we will probably
advance about #20m to #22m this year,'' said general manager Craig
Murray, forecasting pre-tax profits of #2m, up from #1.35m in 1994.
Clydesdale's new owner, Club 24, a finance management company that
belongs to the Next chain of department stores, has helped channel new
business to the firm from retailers throughout the UK.
''Nowadays more than half our business comes from south of the Border
and that figure grows every day,'' Mr Murray said.
Some of Clydesdale's growth has come through large deals.
But Mr Murray said most new credit agreements are with small chains of
shops which had not previously offered their customers credit
facilities.
Low sales and the lack of a ''feel good'' factor among consumers is
driving them to offer new incentives to boost turnover.
''We are trying to open up new opportunities and work with retailers
who had not been in the market before,'' Mr Murray said.
Although Clydesdale's 400 customers include big names such as
ScottishPower with 130 retail outlets, most of the firm's new business
comes from small chains of four or five shops with annual turnover of
less than #1m.
When a customer wants to buy an item on credit at an associated store,
Clydesdale runs a computer check on the information supplied and
generally gives a reply within minutes. If the proposal is accepted,
Clydesdale pays the retailer cash for the purchase and signs a loan
agreement with the buyer.
The interest charged varies between annual percentage rates of 19.5%
and 34%, according to the risk which Clydesdale attaches to a particular
sector.
This is more than it would cost the buyer to borrow from a bank, but
the credit is granted immediately with fewer checks and often for
relatively small amounts. Mr Murray says the average size of Clydesdale
transactions is #350.
Increasingly shops are so anxious to sell that they offer buyers
interest free credit for up to 24 months.
This means that the seller, not the buyer pays interest on the loan,
but Mr Murray said some retailers deliberately inflate their prices to
claw back this subsidy.
Interest-free loans are the fastest growing sector of Clydesdale's
market and account for 30% to 35% of its business, he said.
Clydesdale tries to do follow-up business with its 120,000 individual
loan customers by issuing them with credit cards.
These can be used to make further purchases at any retailer associated
with Clydesdale up to an established limit of revolving credit.
For instance, a man who buys new tyres for his car at a National Tyre
outlet with Clydesdale credit could then buy new wallpaper for his
living room from Focus DIY, another Clydesdale associate, on the same
terms.
''We estimate there is over 30% of additional spend on issued cards,
but we hope to raise this to 50% or 60% over time,'' Mr Murray said.

PERTH is to be the venue for a new complex that aims to attract
thousands of visitors by bringing to life the history of Scotland's
farming industry.
At the United Auction's Perth Agricultural Centre, home for the world
famous bull sales, work is well under way for completion in June of a
unit which will combine theatre facilities with an animal farm plus a
restuarant and retail centre.
''This is a commercial venture which we hope will have the support of
the agricultural community,'' said UA Chief Executive Alan McGregor.
''It is five years since we opened the new auction centre and we are
moving to maximise its utilisation.''
Already planned for tourists are half-hour shows, performed up to five
times a day, when expert commentators will recount the history and
merits of livestock breeds such as Aberdeen-Angus and Highland cattle,
Clydesdale, Highland and Shetland horses, and Blackface and North
Country Cheviot sheep.
Coachloads of visitors are expected to turn up for these shows
throughout the summer season and to take advantage of the retail and
catering facilities at Perth Agricultural Centre. This includes the
160-seat Strathearn Theatre which will also be available for lease to
outside interests.
Mr McGregor said: ''We are working very closely with our retail and
catering partners as well as Scottish Enterprise Tayside to ensure the
success of this new facility which will add an important dimension to
the sourist facilities in Perthshire.''

EXPORTS by smaller firms have grown at a faster pace than expected
over the past four months and optimism regarding export prospects rose
at the sharpest rate for over 11 years, according to the CBI's Smaller
Firms Economic Report undertaken in conjunction with chartered
accountants Pannell Kerr Forster.
That is one of the positive findings of the April survey. On a more
cautious note, there are growing price pressures and the recent
strengthening of business confidence among the firms surveyed has
slowed. Growth of domestic orders is expected to slow in the coming
months.
The survey also shows that average unit costs picked up at the fastest
rate since October 1990 over the last four months and this rate is
expected to continue over the coming months. Domestic prices also
increased at the sharpest rate since April 1989, although some of this
reflects seasonal factors. Prices are expected to increase at a similar
pace over the next four months which, says the CBI, points to some
squeezing of margins as unit costs are expected to be growing more
strongly.
Small firms reported rising employment over the last four months but
at a slightly slower rate than in January. This contrasts with the
results for manufacturing as a whole which indicate a slight fall.

A SALES programme aimed at increasing Scottish food exports by more
than #36m over the next three years gets under way today in Hong Kong.
A group of companies are involved in the hotel, food and catering
exhibition (HOFEX) which attract buyers from across Asia. The Scottish
companies are bidding for new outlets for a range of products including
beef, lamb, venison, salmon, trout, preserves and shortbread.
It is part of #6.2m food and drink exhibition programme funded by
participating companies in partnership with Scottish Enterprise,
Highland and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Trade International.
Hans Blaumann, of Donald Russell, Inverurie, said: ''We have been
exporting to the Far East for the last four years and are building up
our market. It is a slow market and one that is hard to develop but
obviously there are rewards.
''We face competition in the Far East from Australia, New Zealand and
the US all of which have lower transport elements in reaching that
market. A company like ours that has 95% of its trade in the export
market has to nurse potential outlet much wider than Europe.''
Lanarkshire based Scot Trout are looking for new buyers for their
range of frozen trout fillets, boned trout, trout portions and salmon.
Marketing manager Kathryn Logan said: ''The catering market is very
important in Hong Kong and the exhibition is where we will meet agents
and distributors to discuss opportunities for the future.''
Salmon will also be marketed by Allan and Dey, Aberdeen, who have
suplied fresh and smoked produce to the area for the last three years
and see it as a growth market.
Also looking to expand through the Hong Kong exhibition is Fresh Catch
Ltd of Peterhead, a major processor of mackerel, herring and white fish.
Managing director Chris Anderson said: ''It will be our first time at
HOFEX and our first venture outside the Europe circuit but we are keen
to meet onward processors and discuss trends in consumer preferences.''
Lorna Jack, Head of Scottish Enterprise Food Team, says demand for
imported food is increasing as Far East consumers broaden their tatstes
and try western-style products.
''This trend will continue, offering Scottish companies an opportunity
to develop new export markets.''
Paterson Arran of Livingston will be promoting its range of biscuits,
shortbread, oatcakes , mustards, jams and marmalades.

MINET, the US-owned insurance broker, today opens a new larger office
in Glasgow's West Nile Street to expand its business in Scotland,
particularly the underwriting of professional indemnity insurance.
UK National Sales Director Andrew Bedford said the Glasgow office was
taking on 11 new staff.
Some of these would focus on transfering the underwriting of
professional indemnity insurance from England to Scotland, while others
would develop Minet's sales of a wide range of insurance products in
Scotland, he said.
Professional indemnity insurance protects people such as architects,
lawyers and accountants from the consequences of mistakes committed in
the course of their work and Mr Bedford said much of the underwriting
for this could best be done on the Scottish market.
''We are transferring a portion of the business from London to
Scotland and we are also looking for new business in Scotland,'' he
said.

The national farmer's group Agricultural Central Trading (ACT)
returned a rise of 10.5% in sales in 1994 at #37.9m and declared profits
have nearly doubled over the period from 1991 to #528,000. The
co-operatives share value has been set at 95p, 10p more than the
previous year.
ACT chairman Stuart Beever said the group had made progress
re-establishing itself as a national player in the agricultural supply
market.
''Our customers value our low cost bulk purchase schemes which offer
savings in England, Scotland and Wales.''
Last year fertiliser sales increased 105 and feed sales were 12%
higher.

THE final nail was driven into the interest-rate coffin yesterday when
the Purchasing Managers posted a record level of price increases and
blamed the weakness of the pound for it.
At the same time sterling was scoring gains all round the wicket in
anticipation of a half-point rise in rates on Friday, the day after the
local government elections in England and Wales.
Bank of England figures for the narrow measure of the money supply
were weaker than expected, but M0 remains substantially higher than its
monitoring range.
The Purchasing Managers' seasonally adjusted prices paid index jumped
from 75.8% in March to 81.4% in April, its highest level since the
survey began in June 1991.
Nearly 60% of purchasing managers saw an overall increase in prices
for materials and components; only 2% reported lower prices. The
weakness of sterling relative to the Japanese yen the German mark
resulted in higher inport prices.
Shortages and supply constraints were commonly associated with price
increases. Many different steel, electronic, plastic and paper products
were reported to have risen in price.
The sharp rise in the prices index was a shock. The weakness of the
dollar should have helped cap commodity prices. Instead the strength of
the mark seems to have fed through to prices of semi-manufactures.
The Purchasing Managers' overall index edged up from 55.7% to 56.0%,
indicating that the manufacturing sector was continuing to expand,
though at a slower pace than last year.
The output, new orders, and quantity of purchases indices all moved up
in line, but the suppliers' delivery times index fell from 39% in March
to 37.2% last month, close to a record low.
Over one quarter of companies reported facing slower deliveries.
Problems were caused by shortages of certain commodities, or demand
exceeding supply for semi-manufactured components.
Peter Thomson, director-general of the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply, said: ''Purchasing managers have given us strong
evidence that the weakness of sterling is continuing to help UK
manufacturers win business overseas.
''However, what we are seeing is a sharp rise in the price of many
goods coming into the country.''
James Capel's Adam Cole made the point that the prices index was well
above the level recorded in the aftermath of sterling's devaluation in
1992.
''This is further evidence, if any were required, that a base rate
increase on Friday is a near certainty.''
The fall in sterling so far this year, largely a function of the sharp
falls in the dollar, has been the equivalent of a reduction of around 1%
in base rates.
The Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, and the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, were concerned about the pound's
plight as early as their meeting on March 8.
The situation has deteriorated since then, and it is difficult to see
how the two men can refrain from increasing rates when they meet in
Friday, especially as figures for gross domestic product last week
showed that the economy had not slowed down since the start of the year.
A Reuters poll of top City economists has found that 19 out of the 20
surveyed thought that rates would be increased on Friday.
When rates were last raised in February the decision was conveyed to
the money markets in the Bank's noon dealings immediately after the
meeting. The Chancellor has the last word on rate changes, but the
timing is decided by the Governor.
In December, the previous occasion when rates were raised, the
Governor was so anxious about the effect of the Government's defeat the
night before over VAT on domestic fuel that the meeting was brought
forward to breakfast time so that the decision could be conveyed to the
markets before a planned gilt auction.
The US Federal Reserve has also been recognising the merits of
intimating rate changes immediately they have been decided. It would be
particularly dangerous for Mr George to delay implementing a rate rise
on this occasion.
UK and French markets are closed on Monday for VE Day, but other major
financial centres are open, which would leave sterling in a very exposed
situation if rates had not been increased.
Paradoxically the pound was in good heart yesterday. The widespread
expectation that rates would rise on Friday enabled it to make gains on
both the mark and the dollar. The trade-weighted index jumped from 84.6
to 85.1. Even so sterling has still lost 3.8% of its international value
this year.
There should be no doubt how quickly the pound would go into reverse
if the expected rise in rates was not delivered after Friday's meeting.
Meanwhile M0 rose by a lower than expected 0.4% last month and the
annual rate of increase fell back from 7% to 6.2% against City
expectations of 6.6%.
But most of the volatility is associated with bankers' balances. Notes
and coins in circulation grew by 0.5%, the same increase as in the
previous two months, and the annual rate edged down from 5.9% to 5.7%,
still well above the 0% to 4% monitoring range.
Interpretation of the March and April narrow money data has been
muddied by uncertainty over the seasonal adjustment in place to capture
the very different timings of Easter in the last two years.
Yesterday's money supply figures are not thought to have any policy
significance. Narrow money figures come well down the Bank of England's
list of worries.

Zagreb, Monday
THE UN urgently tried to stop fighting in Croatia today after the
Croatian army rolled across ceasefire lines deep into a Serb-held
enclave, in an assault that overshadowed the end of a four-month truce
in Bosnia.
Serbs shelled Croatian towns and took 122 UN hostages in reply after
thousands of Croatian troops with artillery and tanks rammed into the
Western Slavonia region of central Croatia at dawn in an attack from the
east and west, the UN said.
Slobodan Jarcevic, a senior Krajina Serb official, conceded
''considerable losses'' and appealed for intervention from Serb forces
in neighbouring Bosnia and from Serbian-led Yugoslavia.
However, UN sources said Bosnian Serbs had not reacted to Croatian
troops advancing eastwards along the north side of the Sava River border
only a few hundred metres away.
Two Croatian warplanes tried to bomb a bridge across the Sava to
frustrate any attempt by the Bosnian Serbs to reinforce their allies in
Croatia, but missed and hit a Krajina Serb corps base instead, UN
observers said.
In Zagreb, Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy for former Yugoslavia,
brought together Croatian and Krajina Serb civilian negotiators in a
hurried attempt to stop the fighting.
''We're trying to get elements of a ceasefire together. The Serbs seem
ready to sign anything but the Croatians are quite unwilling which is
the problem,'' a UN spokesman said.
The talks later ended without agreement. Negotiators were to consult
their leaderships and the UN hoped to reconvene talks tomorrow.
Croatian special forces had stormed past abandoned Serb barricades and
ammunition stores on the E-70 motorway in the first serious fighting in
the ex-Yugoslav republic since 1993.
Croatian state television said tonight that the entire 15-mile segment
of Croatia's east-west motorway within the Serb enclave had fallen into
government hands.
UN observers could not verify this, but said the Croatians had broken
far into the pocket from the east and west. Advance units were only six
miles apart by nightfall, closing in on Okucani, the main town in the
heart of the enclave.
Serb militia detained 122 UN soldiers and civilian police as apparent
human shields and confiscated their flak jackets, helmets, and radios,
UN sources said.
Some detainees were blocked inside their observation towers by rebel
Serbs in the middle of heavy fighting. ''The Serbs are trying to use our
observers as cover,'' a UN spokesman said.
Civilians, mainly women and children, fled in a column of cars, buses,
and tractors from Okucani towards the Sava bridge to Bosnia. Some 15,000
Serbs live in Western Slavonia.
Croatian troops thrust south-east past truce lines to the Sava and at
midday captured Jasenovac, site of a the Second World War death camp
where Serbs were murdered by Croatian fascists.
Croatian television showed footage of a deserted Jasenovac village,
saying inhabitants had fled across the Sava to Bosnia.
The UN reported retaliatory Serb artillery attacks on Sisak and
Karlovac, two front-line towns well west of the main war zone and only
35 miles south of the capital Zagreb.
Three civilians were wounded. All traffic to the Adriatic coast was
halted. Civilians took cover in cellars, including pregnant women
sleeping four to a bed in a hospital basement.
0 Foreign Minister Mate Granic, in a meeting with ambassadors to
Zagreb, told them the attack aimed only to restore free motorway traffic
and Croatia still wanted to reintegrate Serb areas peacefully with civil
rights for their inhabitants.
Meanwhile in London leading powers trying to end the war in Bosnia
laid plans for a top-level meeting and Nato made preparations for a
possible withdrawal of UN peacekeepers.
Nato sources said a small team of communications specialists was due
to leave for Croatia today, from where they will prepare a possible UN
pullout from Bosnia if needed.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said that he was ''anxious'' and urged
the warring parties to turn back to diplomacy as the only way to end the
war.
''People mock at meetings but I tell you this war is not going to end
through fighting, it is going to end eventually through meetings and
negotiations,'' he said.
''The trouble is that each side, Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian
government, seem to believe that they can gain great advantage by
fighting. I am pretty sure that that is not so.''
With UN peacekeepers in Bosnia under increasing pressure in recent
weeks, several countries including France and Russia have said they may
have to withdraw their troops from the force of more than 20,000 ''blue
helmets''.
Nevertheless, the 16-nation Nato has been making contingency plans for
a force of up to 40,000 that might be needed to help get the
peacekeepers out.
As part of those plans, Nato has put together a team of some 50
communications specialists from the United States, Britain, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Germany and Italy as an advance guard to prepare for a
possible withdrawal.
Alliance officials say their deployment to Croatia this week does not
mean that a withdrawal is imminent -- only that careful planning is
needed for what would be the biggest military operation in Europe since
the Second World War.--Reuter

STERLING continued to benefit from the widely held view that UK
interest rates will be raised in the near future. It gained almost one
pfennig versus the mark at DM2.2486 and was almost a cent higher against
the dollar at $1.6185. The pound's trade weighted value rose by 0.5 to
85.1.
Increasingly foreign monetary authorities are moving away from the US
dollar and building up stocks of the stronger German mark and Japanese
yen.
However analysts at brokers BZW do not believe that this necessarily
signs a death warrant for the dollar. Mainly because the sums involved
represent only a small fraction of turnover in the market and the dollar
is a peg for many the currencies of many countries. The Japanese
authorities are not promoting the yen as a reserve currency. Indeed they
have been vocal in their support for the dollar retaining its role.
Many of the Asian central banks, notably China and Indonesia, are
selling dollar reserves for yen to build a yen stockpile for future
repayment of yen-denominated foreign debt. However they will not want to
be too aggressive in buying the yen for fear of driving it even higher,
thereby further increasing the payment problems associated with having a
sizeable portion of yen-denominated debt.
In the meantime the dollar continues its steady decline. Yesterday
trading was quiet with many foreign exchanges closed for the May Day
holiday.

Durban, Monday,
SHOTS were fired at a rally in South Africa's Zulu heartland today at
which President Nelson Mandela was speaking. He was taken from the scene
in an armoured car.
''I don't think he himself was scared but lots of shots were fired so
we took him away in a Nyala,'' said Major Robbie Cook at Durban's Umlazi
stadium.
An army officer said that the President's helicopter could not land
near the stadium because shots were being fired into the air.
President Mandela, 76, was taken to a nearby airport where he boarded
the helicopter back to his official residence in Durban.
Police said six people were shot and wounded during and after the
rally. It was not known whether they were members of Mandela's ruling
African National Congress or the rival Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party.
They said that around 30 shots were fired, mostly into the air, during
the rally at which Mandela warned he could cut funding to KwaZulu-Natal
province, if Inkatha continued to threaten his government.
Inkatha won elections to control the regional government but Mandela
told the 20,000 people at the rally that the central government holds
KwaZulu-Natal's purse strings.
''Inkatha should know that it is us that gives them money and they use
the money against my government. Should they continue I am going to
withdraw that money,'' he said.
Referring to Inkatha's withdrawal from South Africa's Constitutional
Assembly Mandela said: ''They have withdrawn from the Constitutional
Assembly. I am not going to ask them to come back.''
Today Mandela warned to loud cheers: ''Everyone who breaks the law
should know I am angered. Those making violence should know I am in
control here.''--Reuter

MURRAY Enterprise, which beat its benchmark index during the first
half in spite of setbacks, will limit its exposure to consumer-dependent
companies to steer clear of anticipated profit disappointments.
The #28m investment trust, managed in Glasgow by Murray Johnstone,
yesterday announced a 4.6% fall in net asset value to 117.73p in the six
months to end-March. The FT Actuaries Small Caps index (excluding
investment trusts) lost 5.1%.
During a difficult period for smaller companies, which generally
suffer in times of market weakness, Murray Enterprise made a negative
total return of 3.2%, marginally better than the Small Caps index.
Shareholders will receive an interim dividend of 0.75p (0.7p) and the
trust expects to increase last year's final of 1.4p.
Murray Enterprise, which pulled out of North America and invested the
proceeds in smaller UK quoted companies at the beginning of last year,
received a #230,000 profits boost from the sale of its holding in
betting shops and casinos group Stanley Leisure.
With UK exports remaining buoyant, and Murray Johnstone believing
interest rates may rise only slowly from current levels, the trust
believes the outlook for profits in the general manufacturing and
industrial sectors is good.
However, it will be extremely cautious about investing in
consumer-related businesses, particularly those dependent on the
purchase of large ticket items, in light of recent retail, auto and
housing data.
Trust manager Paul Potter said: ''We are concerned that there are more
likely to be profit disappointments from companies in those areas than
there are within export or manufacturing-based areas.
''To some extent, that is reflected in prices but perhaps not
entirely.''
Murray Enterprise, which aims for a high total return over the long
term, is bullish on prospects for smaller companies during the remainder
of this year.
It targets stocks with market capitalisations of less than #250m,
trawling the bottom 10% of the market.
Mr Potter said: ''We have had 12 months of weakness in smaller
companies, yet the economic outlook is still reasonably good. In no way
are they expensive relative to other investments.''

IVORY &amp; Sime and Japan's Sumitomo Trust and Banking Company (STB) have
decided to wind up their joint venture Sumitrust Ivory &amp; Sime (STIS),
with Sumitomo taking over its global bond portfolio and Ivory &amp; Sime its
equity assets.
Ivory &amp; Sime managing director Colin Hook said #189m of assets managed
by STIS in Edinburgh on behalf of Japanese clients would be transferred
to direct management by Sumitomo in Tokyo.
This would leave #79m of equity-based funds under STIS management for
the time being, but these would be transferred to direct management by
Ivory &amp; Sime within a couple of months, he added.
''It was quite a complicated way of managing money,'' Mr Hook said.
''We were both contributing personnel to the management of the fund
and both parties felt it could be managed more efficiently if STB
managed the bond funds in Tokyo and we managed the equity funds in
Edinburgh.''
But Mr Hook said that Sumitomo would remain a close partner of his
Edinbrugh-based fund management company.
''We are obviously maintaining a close relationship,'' Mr Hook said.
''We are continuing to manage at least one account for STIS and STB will
continue to remain a shareholder in Ivory &amp; Sime.''
Sumitomo presently has a 4.5% stake in Ivory &amp; Sime, which has #3100m
under management.

Washington, Monday,
THE rescue teams in Oklahoma City have given up the last shred of hope
of finding any survivor of the bomb attack. The ruins of the federal
building are so unstable that the search for survivors and bodies has
been suspended since Thursday. Now it has been abandoned.
The toll is now 137, and about 60 people are still missing.
The exact number is uncertain because there are conflicting estimates
of how many visitors were in the building at the time of the attack.
A woman from Tulsa, south of Oklahoma City, reported over the weekend
that her sister, a friend and four children might have been inside the
Albert Murrah building. This has not been confirmed.
Heavy rains on Sunday, accompanied by strong winds made the ruins yet
more unstable. Officials fear that, if rescuers continue to burrow into
the pile of wreckage, the building may collapse on top of them.
One rescue worker was killed last week by falling masonry, and another
was injured today. Since there is no longer any hope of finding any
survivors, the prime concern must be the safety of rescue workers.
The search will continue, but heavy equipment will now be brought in
to demolish the building. Eventually, as all the superstructure is
cleared away, it will be possible to remove the slabs of concrete that
now bury the 60 bodies, and most of them will be recovered. It is likely
that some will never be identified, and it is probable that some may
never be found.
There are still five children missing, including four infants who were
in cribs or high chairs facing the windows immediately above where the
bomb exploded. Their bodies will never be found.
Meanwhile, the hunt for the other suspects in the case continues. The
FBI has issued yet another composite picture, an identikit, of the
second of two men who rented a removal truck two days before the
bombing. The first, Timothy McVeigh, was arrested on the day of the
bombing.
The unnamed suspect, referred to as John Doe number 2, is said to be
heavy-set, possibly a weight-lifter, deeply tanned, and with tattoos on
his left arm.
A Texas newspaper reported this morning that a receipt for one tonne
of ammonium nitrate, bearing McVeigh's fingerprints, was found in the
home of Terry Nichols in Kansas.
He is a friend of McVeigh's, and has been held as a witness, together
with a brother from Michigan. Police are still looking for the place
where the bomb was built.
The bombers must have taken weeks to mix the explosives and pack them
into drums. Police are checking reports that the rented truck was seen
at a state park in Kansas the day before the bombing.

Achkhoi-Martan, Monday
RUSSIAN troops were today ordered to clamp a dusk to dawn curfew on
the devastated Chechen capital Grozny after what a Russian general
called a fierce overnight battle with rebel fighters in the city.
The curfew, to run from 9 pm to 6 am will last until July 1 the
Russian military command said.
Interfax news agency said today that a spokesman for the Russian
command in Chechnya, named as General Kalinin, had reported a heavy
battle in Grozny on Sunday night between Russians and Chechen militias.
Russian officials said fighters loyal to breakaway leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev had infiltrated the city and attacked Moscow's troops.
He said dozens of rebels and a number of Russian soldiers were killed
in the clash, and fighting in and around other Chechen settlements,
including the last major rebel stronghold at Bamut.
The battle, which appeared to be the heaviest in the capital since
Russian forces took it in bloody fighting in February, dealt another
blow to an already shaky ceasefire called just three days ago by
President Boris Yeltsin.
The president ordered the truce in a bid to avert fighting when almost
50 world leaders arrive in Moscow for the VE commemorations in eight
days.
However, separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev has rejected the truce.
Russian news agencies said Chechen fighters attacked on Sunday night and
early on Monday with mortars and light weapons.
In the town of Achkhoi-Martan about 20 miles south-west of Grozny, a
police car was blown up and the driver was injured in what police said
was the first separatist attack on locals cooperating with Russian
forces.
''This probably happened because the administration is cooperating
with Russian forces,'' Shamil Burayev, the town's chief administrator,
said.--Reuter

MEMBERS of National &amp; Provincial Building Society will not have to
wait long to discover the size of the windfall they will receive should
Abbey National's bid for the society go through.
Abbey said it hoped to make its offer by the end of May. A sum of
around #500 per member is widely expected to be offered by Abbey. It is
quite possible a counter-bidder may emerge now that N&amp;P is seen to be up
for sale.
The first detailed talks between the two sides took place yesterday,
when Peter Birch, Abbey's chief executive, met with his opposite number
at N&amp;P, Alastair Lyons, and another director of the society, for some 90
minutes in London. Abbey described the talks as ''constructive''.
N&amp;P said Mr Birch gave an outline of Abbey's initial thinking
regarding a merger. No formal proposal was tabled.
A spokeswoman added that the two had spoken ''in quite some detail'',
with Mr Birch outlining ''some fairly specific thoughts.''
Abbey appears to be determined to press ahead rapidly and will prepare
its detailed offer after studying financial documents which N&amp;P will
supply this week. The terms of the offer could even be known by the
middle of the month.
Mr Lyons said the society retained an open mind about its future
strategic direction and that the board's guiding principle was to act in
the best interests of members.
''All relevant options will be examined by the board,'' he said. Last
week N&amp;P stopped the opening of new accounts which confer membership of
the society after having received a flood of applications. It is unclear
whether these new accounts, which followed news of Abbey's approach,
will qualify for the windfall.
As a medium-sized society, N&amp;P will have known it was vulnerable to
being taken over and may have an alternative strategy up its sleeve. It
is difficult to see it denying members the opportunity to receive a
windfall, though the board is not actually obliged to present an offer
to members.
But it could line up a merger with another similar sized society in
order to create a more viable business which could then be floated on
the stock market, with members receiving free shares which they could
sell if they wanted cash. Such a course might well raise more for
members than a straight sale, though the process would be protracted.
More likely perhaps is a straight alternative offer from another bank,
once the colour of Abbey's money has been seen.
The board would no doubt feel morally bound to present the best offer
to members but there is no legal obligation to do so. However members
can sit back and let the matter take its course knowing that they will
be better off eventually.

Washington, Monday,
THE White House said today that some industrial nations are reviewing
economic ties with Iran at US request, following Washington's decision
to bar all commerce with what it considers a terrorist nation in search
of nuclear arms.
''We've . . . had some indications from some members of the G7 that
they are reviewing their own economic engagement with Iran,'' said White
House spokesman Mike McCurry, referring to the Group of Seven industrial
allies, which also includes Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Italy and
Canada.
''Some European countries for example are looking at credit facilities
and how they might adjust those, whether or not they need to look at
lending criteria,'' McCurry said.
He noted that Japan had already held up financing of the Karun dam
project in Iran because of US pressure.
''There's been a lot of discussion within the G7 on exactly this topic
and some recognition within the G7 that Iranian sponsorship of terrorism
is a very serious issue that must be addressed,'' he said.
In a speech to a Jewish group in New York on Sunday, President Bill
Clinton announced he would cut off all US trade and investment with Iran
as a sign of ''unrelenting determination'' to thwart its bid to develop
nuclear weapons and support terrorism.
Iran denies it wants to develop nuclear weapons or backs terrorism and
Tehran Radio called Clinton's move a re-election campaign bid for the
support of ''influential Zionist groups.''
Iranian television said the American move was ''disgraceful'' and the
Iranian Foreign Ministry said it would only hurt US companies. It said
Iran had many other alternatives for trade.
McCurry said the US move would bolster US efforts to persuade Moscow
not to sell Iran two nuclear reactors that Washington fears will be used
to support weapons development.
Clinton goes to Moscow next Monday for a two-day visit and a summit
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the prospective reactor sale is
high on their discussion agenda.

Kigali, Monday
THE corpses of four more murdered Hutus were discovered stuffed into
pit latrines in a southern Rwandan village, where 14 were earlier found
stoned and beaten to death, the United Nations refugee agency said
today.
''They were beaten up and their bodies were dumped in latrines. The
bodies have been retrieved,'' said Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the UN
High Comissioner for Refugees.
The discovery brought the death toll of Hutus returning home after
being forced out of refugee camps by government troops to 18 in the
southern village of Huye.
Rwanda's government earlier accused the United Nations of waging a
propaganda campaign against it and denied reports that Hutu refugees who
had returned home had been killed.
''These reports are absolute rubbish. The United Nations is not happy
that we have closed camps for the displaced and sent them back home,''
said Major Wilson Rutayisire.
''The United Nations is waging propaganda against the government.
No-one has been killed or harassed although I am aware of some arrests
being carried out,'' he said in Kigali

Paris, Monday
SPEAKING in front of the Paris Opera to several thousand supporters
waving hundreds of tricolour flags, National Front leader Jean-Marie Le
Pen yesterday heaped insults and derision on Jacques Chirac and put paid
to the Gaullist candidate's hopes of receiving his party's all-important
votes in next Sunday's presidential election.
Chirac polled a humiliatingly low 21% of votes in the first round of
the election on April 23. To beat Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin in
the second round on May 7 he needs to attract not only the 18% of voters
who preferred his Gaullist rival Edouard Balladur, but also the
record-breaking 15% National Front vote.
By contemptuously rejecting any idea of support for the Gaullist
candidate, Le Pen paid Chirac back for what he considers a decade of
political and personal ostracism.
''Chirac is the man of the left who will carry out left wing policies
under a right-wing mask. Chirac is like Jospin, only worse,'' said Le
Pen, whose hour-long tirade was interrupted by the unfurling of two
giant anti-National Front banners by protesters in the Opera and the
Grand Hotel opposite.
''The scum demonstrates, the people pass,'' Le Pen commented,
parodying a well known Arab proverb, while the crowd roared out its rage
and security men pulled down the banners.
Despite his diatribe against Chirac, whom he accused of betraying his
country to foreign interests, Le Pen said he left his followers free to
vote for whom they wanted.
Yesterday's traditional National Front march through the streets of
Paris, ostensibly in honour of St Joan of Arc, brought together a broad
social mix of people from all over France, brought up at the rear by
skinheads shouting: ''Immigrants go away.''
The high point of the day was Le Pen's speech. Frequently interrupted
by applause and shouts of ''Le Pen president'' and ''France for the
French,'' frequently speaking of himself in the third person, Le Pen
peppered his speech with emotional references to St Joan's fight against
the occupying English.
The presidential election was only a battle between ''two dwarfs''
incapable of solving the country's problems, he concluded.
* A 29-year-old Moroccan man drowned in the Seine after being pushed
off the Carrousel Bridge by a group of skinheads taking part in the
National Front march yesterday morning, according to the news agency
AFP.

A new compilation of lost Sondheim
numbers may mean the 'Secret
Stephens' sharing their obsession,
writes KEITH BRUCE
IS THE Secret Stephen Society opening up? Could it be that fans of the
world's most underrated composer (well, OK, one of the world's most
underrated composers) are at last prepared to share their penchant for
complex music and intelligent lyrical sensibilities?
For all his occasional West End success, Stephen Sondheim is not
exactly big time. Touring productions of his musicals do not annexe
Edinburgh's Playhouse for months on end. It seems unlikely that they
ever will.
The result has been that Sondheim aficionados tend to be a race apart.
There exists in Britain a Stephen Sondheim Society through which
information about stagings of his work is available. Which is all very
well if you are in the know, but not exactly prime-time advertising.
When larger-scale efforts like the Manchester Library Theatre's
staging of his work -- including the superb Pacific Overtures -- in the
1980s and the National Theatre's Sunday in the Park and Sweeney Todd
(directed by Cheek By Jowl's Declan Donnellan) fail to entice huge
queues to the box office, that is hardly surprising. Although his work
sometimes demands a large-scale production, it is reasonable to predict
that his popular future may lie in smaller shows.
For Sondheim virgins there are few more accessible places to start
than Marry Me A Little, a compilation of lost Sondheim songs that was
assembled by composer and singer Craig Lucas in 1980. Music Theatre
Lab's production was first staged at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, in March
of last year, and opens at the Cottier for a short Mayfest run tonight.
With tenor Iain Paton appearing in Purcell's King Arthur at Covent
Garden, director James Ross has recruited baritone Clive Paget to
partner Carol Rowlands for the show. A chap who runs workshops for the
Sondheim Society, Paget is firmly a member of the UK Sondheim network.
After training as an engineer, Paget, 33, took acting and singing
lessons privately before making the break to pursue his hobby full time
-- and quickly finding a niche.
''I'm more musically trained than a lot of music theatre people, so
was attracted to the Sondheim end of the spectrum. There is a shortage
of people to sing that kind of stuff. Opera singers have the technique,
but not the inclination,'' says Paget.
In fact, he brought his own production of Marry Me A Little to the
Edinburgh Festival Fringe last year, playing to good reviews at the
Theatre West End. In London he has appeared in Night Music and Pacific
Overtures at the Bridewell Theatre in Fleet Street, a 150-seater
converted Victorian swimming pool directed by Glaswegian Carol Metcalfe.
The Bridewell, like Glasgow's Cottier, is making a name for itself as
a small-scale music theatre venue. It was the first British company to
secure the rights to Closer Than Ever by Richard Maltby Jun and David
Shire -- in which Paget appeared -- and that show has its Scottish
premiere in Floyd Kennedy's production for Golden Age Theatre at the
Cottier on Sunday, May 14.
Metcalfe's Pacific Overtures even attracted the attention of the great
man himself. She dispensed with the prescribed kabuki-style production
in favour of a Brechtian story-telling version, according to Paget. Far
from disapproving, Sondheim wrote to say he thought that was ''brave''
-- a characteristically ambiguous choice of word.
But for every Sondheim ambiguity, there is a balancing piece of
precision. Marry Me A Little -- the superb song that gives this week's
show its title, has two other incarnations: Being Alive and Happily Ever
After. Only one found its way into the musical Company. Marry Me A
Little (the show) provides an opportunity to hear them as a sequence
that was never intended, but in effect offers a skilled writer's
different slants on a relationship's possibilities.
It is fair to say that the attempt by Lucas to give Marry Me A Little
a narrative drive is less successful elsewhere (the duets in the central
section are there for their own sake, no more), but it is still much
more successful than other compilation shows. Although superbly sung,
the huge success of Side by Side by Sondheim owed as much to the
directorial and raconteurial skills of Ned Sherrin -- a fact rather
given away by the succession of the Side by Sides it spawned.
Putting It Together, the Julia MacKenzie/Cameron Mackintosh show from
last year which has still to be seen in Britain, is reportedly too
wrapped up in its mission to salvage Sondheim's songs. It places the
well known alongside a few rarer gems -- including songs from Marry Me
-- but without much purpose or coherence. Marry Me presents the director
with a different problem: how far to push the parallel lives of the two
single New Yorkers into something that brings them together, rather than
simply provides a commentary on their separate lives.
Paget claims that far from disagreeing with Ross's interpretation, his
having staged the piece before was an asset.
''I'd had to look at the options, and I'd considered many of the same
problems. There's not strong, dramatic narrative, but the songs take you
on a strong emotional journey. There's a lot that's different about this
show,'' he says.
Certainly, if Ross follows the pattern of last year's staging -- and
it again uses Nick Miller's set of stylised isometric furnishings -- he
is not afraid to underline the emotional insincerity of these
self-obsessed young New Yorkers with some libidinous stage business.
A little more of that antidote to the po-faced Sondheim-salvagers
might not go amiss, even if it means the Secret Stephens sharing their
obsession.
* Marry Me A Little is at the Cottier Theatre tonight and on
Wednesday, May 10 at 8pm. There are 11pm shows on Friday and Saturday
this week and next.

Rap music, the pulse of the streets of contemporary black America, has
hitherto been perceived as the 'verse' in subversive, the rhythm of
'gangsta' counter-culture. Keith Moore previews a season which heralds
the form's acceptance
There is even a poets' cafe in New York buzzing to the sounds of
street beats and social issue stanzas
IT HAS finally happened. Following a decade in which American rap
music has been viewed as violent and somehow subversive, it has now been
accepted as an art form, indeed as a strand of modern-day poetry.
Beginning tomorrow, an innovative and intriguing season begins at
Glasgow's CCA, featuring a selection of contemporary writers, who are,
to all intents and purposes, poets.
Kicking off the season and kicking out the jams are Urban Poets
Society, in an event marking Glasgow's first poetry slam. Slamming is
becoming a popular event in the States, and there is even a poets' cafe
in New York buzzing to the sounds of street beats and social issue
stanzas.
Diane Hutcheson, an arts programmer at Renfrew District Council,
recently visited the New Nuyorican Poets Cafe, a place she describes as
being ''packed with extremely young, hip people and black and Puerto
Rican poets, old and young. There were five young poets, a veteran who
acted as compere and a scoremaster who took scores from the audience. It
works on a knockout round basis and the atmosphere is just amazing,
topped by a DJ at the end.''
But what is most interesting is that Puerto Ricans, one of New York's
largest new immigrant populations, are taking the lead from rap and
using poetry as a means of expressing themselves. There is a rumour that
the Nuyorican poets were supposed to be in Glasgow for Mayfest, and
their non-appearance should be rectified soon. Scotland needs to
experience events like this.
By far the best-known guest at CCA is John Giorno, the American master
beat poet who, although never having gone away, has enjoyed a burgeoning
interest in his career of late. Giorno is the king of the one-liner, a
hardcore poet whose depictions of urban and social decay have made him a
spokesman and icon for a generation.
''In terms of poetry, the nineties have been great, there's a real
renaissance going on,'' he said. ''Rap has always been sullied by
traditional poets, the rapaphobes, but I love it, especially the x-rated
stuff. These guys are speaking from the heart, talking about the nature
of their lives. Sure it's ugly, but wife beating, homophobia, and
violence are a part of their everyday existence.''
Giorno is probably best known as the originator of Dial-a-Phone in the
late sixties. Although no longer personally involved, the idea continues
throughout the world, you just pick up the phone and enlightenment is
only a call away. The proliferation of modern-day technology, will, he
thinks have a tremendous effect on the way the public gains access to
art forms, and poetry on the Internet is not too far away.
Giorno is almost the last of that generation of artists who did so
much to change our perceptions of what art can be, and he has seen many
of his contemporaries ravaged by Aids.
Close friends including Keith Haring, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Terry
Clifford -- all gone. In his recently published book of poems and
memoirs, You Got to Burn to Shine, Giorno graphically describes his
first encounter with the young Haring -- in a subway toilet.
Back then, in pre-Aids days, this was the place for gay men to hang
out in search of casual sex. Of course, the epidemic ensured the closure
of these toilets but Giorno mourns the loss of Great Anonymous Sex, of
treating a complete stranger as a lover. Nowadays he treats strangers as
friends in the same loving way through his charitable work.
In 1984, he set up an Aids Treatment Project, and he spends a couple
of hours each day working on the appeal. The day I'd spoken to him he'd
just come back from uptown: ''There's a guy from Ecuador who's dying. He
needed some money to get home, I went up and gave it to him.''
It's as easy as that. In Giorno's world there are no forms to fill in,
no means test system to sit. Friends will tell him of people they know
who need assistance, John phones them up or pays them a visit and they
get the money.
''We don't talk about it too much, but it really is the best way to
help. Getting $400 in the post can be a great jolt to the immune system,
especially if you are ill and worrying about your rent or Medi-Care. In
our own small way we try to help, and to give that help as easily and
painlessly as we can.''
The impetus for his dedication to the charity stems from the fact that
after a lifetime of promiscuous gay sex -- ''I've had sex with literally
hundreds of guys, many of whom are now dead'' -- John Giorno is alive
and HIV negative.
Giorno's own lifestyle has been nothing less than colourful. In the
sixties he was a close friend of Warhol, starred in a couple of his
early movies, had an affair of sorts and even met his mother. His memoir
of Warhol is fascinating, the attention to detail breathtaking.
''I've never really used my memory before I started writing the
memoirs. I'm not a prose writer, but the death of Andy prompted me to
write the piece. My memory came as a great surprise to me.
''I find that I am able to zoom in on something, put it under a
microscope, so to speak, and remember the most amazing things. Poetry is
pretty minimal, so all this detail is kinda new to me.''
Last up on May 13 is Jean ''Binta Breeze'', Jamaica's leading female
dub poet and story teller. She is one of a growing band of women using
poetry as a means of voicing the dilemmas they face, of putting a
perspective on their history and experiences. Using a musical backdrop
for her words, Breeze, like New Yorker Dana Bryant, is finding new
audiences for her work throughout the world.
Which for poetry can only be a good thing, because there is nothing
more powerful than the spoken word and, by shaking a little of the dust
off the genre and addressing contemporary issues, poetry can be one
almighty weapon.
* The Urban Poets Society is at the Glasgow's CCA tomorrow, John
Giorno performs next Wednesday, and the season ends with Jean ''Binta''
Breeze on May 17. All performances are at 7pm.

YOU would be correct in thinking that the Glasgow Hospital Education
Service provides teaching support for children of school age whose
physical condition confines them to hospital. However, you would be
mistaken if you thought that these children are its only pupils. The
service has about 200 pupils at any one time who have a diverse range of
educational, emotional, social, physical, medical and psychological
needs.
The hospital education system is combined with the home tuition
service, and consists of units in Gartnavel Royal Hospital, the Douglas
Inch Centre, the Department of Child and Family Psychiatry, and Yorkhill
Royal Hospital for Sick Children. It also arranges for its teaching
staff to go to other hospitals in Glasgow when required.
One factor essential in meeting the educational needs of young people
in its care is flexibility. Unlike school, in hospital the teaching is
not rigidly set. It varies according to the child's circumstances and
medical/psychological state. For those who are well enough this ranges
from one to five hours a day.
The service's education co-ordinator Mr Peter Feeley says: ''Teachers'
judgment is critical in deciding the amount of teaching time which is
appropriate for the child.''
Once this is decided the unit's place of learning also varies with the
child's circumstances. At Yorkhill, immobile children are taught at
their bedside. Children who run the risk of cross infection, for example
leukaemia patients, are taught in the hospital school rooms. Where
possible children are taught in groups, an option which provides them
with an opportunity for social interaction.
Young people who suffer from psychiatric difficulties such as anorexia
nervosa and acute phobias are admitted for an extensive block period to
Gartnavel adolescent unit. Here they are able to continue or complete
their secondary education.
The Douglas Inch Centre admits youngsters aged 14-16 years who have
severe difficulties in attending school, usually because they have
rejected or been rejected by their place of learning. These pupils enter
into a contract with the centre, which demands a high standard of
behaviour and attendance. The aim is for youngsters to succeed in their
learning, and to feel positive about their last experience of formal
education.
Children of primary age with psychiatric disorders are admitted to the
Department of Child and Family Psychiatry, as in-patients for between
four and six weeks. During this time, teachers work with the families,
and the child's educational needs are assessed. This department also has
a teacher in the Fraser of Allander neurological assessment unit who
identifies strategies for the needs of children with neurological
disorders; and a teacher in the communication disorder team who assesses
pre-school autistic children and helps to recommend placements.
Home tuition is provided to youngsters in a range of situations, for
example pregnant teenagers and ME sufferers. It is not intended to be a
permanent feature of the child's education, only an interim measure
which keeps contact open between the home and the school. Mr Feeley
adds: ''There is a greater demand for home tuition. It is increasing in
both number and variety from schools.'' He expects this to increase even
more in the future, as the community becomes aware of hospital policy.
There are currently 16 full-time and 18 part-time teachers working
within the service. These include primary teachers as well as secondary
teachers in English, maths, modern languages, social studies, science,
technical subjects, art, and home economics. As yet music and drama are
not provided but it is hoped that these will be incorporated in the
future.
The service is well resourced, with educational material for the
entire primary and secondary range, and access to Apple Macintosh
computers. The provision of these resources, together with the broad
curriculum, confirms the commitment of the service to minimising the
disruption to the child's education and to maintaining normality in the
child's teaching experience.
What is needed to become a hosiptal teacher? Mr Feeley explains: ''As
well as being a good teacher, a hospital teacher must have good
interpersonal skills. This is because he or she works closely with
parents, works as part of a multi-disciplinary team, collaborates with
colleagues from other disciplines and agencies, and liaises with base
schools. Teachers must be able to teach in the public gaze as the
hospital is more exposed than a school.''
The professional development programme for teaching staff is important
in fulfilling these requirements. It includes in-service training on
curriculum development, as well as on practical aspects of working in a
hospital team.
The service will soon be helping newly formed community based schemes
for children with psychiatric and behavioural problems. This will
involve more teaching outwith hospitals. Although it is easier for
hospital teachers to teach in the hospital, the service is keen to meet
the changing needs of its community. Discussions are already taking
place to support such a venture in the Possilpark area.
Another exciting feature for the future is the potential use of
technology for pupils confined to the hospital or their home. There is a
whole range of ways education can be made accessible, enabling children
to have direct contact with their schools.
The service recently began distributing a circular to all primary,
secondary, and special schools in Glasgow to tell them how it operates.
As well as wanting teachers in schools to understand what the service
provides, Feeley requests clear messages back from parents and teachers
who have come into contact with the service. This may be risky, but it
shows the lengths to which the service is prepared to go to ensure that
sick children receive the very best of education.

THE scene is a Scottish art college five years ago. A new term is
beginning and the students are getting a talk. But to some, the
speaker's language is odd. ''You're our customers'', he keeps on saying.
At the back is an alert and combative girl. The talk over, she
challenges: ''We're students, not customers.'' The speaker apologises,
it's just the terminology he uses to win resources; of course, he
doesn't actually believe it.
But the girl is unconvinced.
What was troubling her was only one of many issues which are causing
concern in Scottish higher education today:
* Too many students for personal contact to be properly made.
* Research to be done at any price. Some institutions may eventually
not be allowed to do research at all.
* Excessive teaching hours. There are not enough staff to meet the
demands placed upon them.
Many universities are unhappy places to be at present. To quote a
senior academic in one of the new ones (anonymously, because of the
prevailing climate): ''This is the worst of times, I wouldn't recommend
my own children to do a degree now.''
Higher education has undergone radical change for more than a decade.
Some brisk hand-bagging by Mrs Thatcher started the process. Lazy and
self-indulgent academics had to be brought into line. The 1987 White
Paper Meeting the Challenge said there was ''an urgent need for higher
education to take increasing account of the economic needs of the
country''.
Correspondingly, the Government and funding bodies promised to
''reward approaches by higher education institutions which bring them
closer to the world of business''.
The world of business has certainly come closer. There are many
manifestations, such as the desperate scrabble for students. And as
institutions vie with other in the battle of the glossy brochure,
departments compete internally, and individual courses even compete
within departments.
In one Scottish university recently, an experienced lecturer found his
course outline described as a ''marketing tool'' and was urged to make
it yet more attractive, with snappy quotes and graphics.
Students are needed as never before. For all that the money they bring
has dropped by one third in 10 years, universities must compete for a
share of it. One way or another they need their quota of one in three
18/19-year-olds which the Government expects to see in higher education.
If students really have added value, then using the word ''customer''
could imply more than the mere sloppy thinking that has made
''customers'' of everyone from hospital patients to local government
electors -- although some universities have formally rejected the term.
In a crude market model, after all, customers have to be wooed, and
kept. The product or service on offer need not be excellent, merely
acceptable to the greatest number. Students as ''customers'' need to be
retained, need to be stopped from (inadvertently) taking their custom
elsewhere -- in the sense of failing exams and dropping out, effectively
taking their money with them.
Could any such ''customerisation'' process threaten standards? Put
bluntly, could there be pressure to pass some students or to lower
expectations for all students, for non-academic reasons? Theoretically,
quality controls from external examiners to the published assessments of
the funding councils should prevent this.
Yet there is concern about standards. A leading academic recently
warned of a higher education system once admired throughout the world
now ''galloping towards ruin''. There are other straws in the wind. An
unnamed professor from an English university spoke recently on BBC
radio's World At One of how he had been warned off failing 11 students
for reasons of cost. Likewise a humanities lecturer at a Scottish
university was told a while ago: ''We don't fail students''.
The first case was clearly about money, the second apparently more
complicated. A senior colleague of the Scottish lecturer concerned puts
it like this: ''I think the notion of student as customer is involved
here. As customers, all students should pass. If they don't, it's
logically because the academic product is at fault in such matters as
teaching. See people as customers, and you tend to give them what they
want. Staff now have to cultivate students, to appease them, almost. In
consequence, I believe that courses are increasingly lightweight in both
teaching and content.''
Although this has echoes of the traditional right, the speaker is of
the left, and sophisticated in the elitism versus egalitarianism debate.
He fears that the gaining of knowledge is being made unproblematical,
with techniques of learning taking precedence over what is taught. The
risk is of an (undeclared) shift from education towards training, from
''the opening of the mind'' as he describes it, to ''the acquisition of
a limited range of definable skills''. Here, perhaps, the spectre of
aggregating ''competences'' looms.
There are countervailing pressures against a pure customer model
taking hold, of course. Higher education institutions will continue to
assert their right to define good standards, rather than allow the
''customers'' to do this. But individual academics may find it harder to
hold the line when the financial cost of exam failure begins to affect
students as well as universities.
If students have to pay tuition fees, and the Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principals recently hinted that part-payment of fees may
be on its way, then they begin to look like customers in a real sense.
Exam failure could have severe consequences for many.
Sympathetic staff, already appalled by student poverty, might be
disposed to pass rather than fail; or, as ''customers'', students might
increasingly seek legal redress, alleging that they had been badly
taught. There are harbingers of the latter.
As John Leopold of the Scottish AUT Executive says: ''I know of no
university being successfully sued so far; but it's not at all uncommon
now for mature students paying full fees to threaten all sorts of
action, including legal action, if they fail.''
The customer is not king of universities yet, and may never be. But
the possibility of unthinking and dangerous links being made between
''products'' and ''customers'' is causing unease: ''customerisation''
may be just the next difficulty for already beleaguered academia.

IT ill becomes Councillor Brian Meek, the seeming only right-of-centre
columnist of The Herald, to write so disparagingly on Independent
councillors in general and one in particular (April 27).
The deceptively surnamed columnist has either forgotten, or wishes
your readers to forget, that it was the Conservative Party which ousted
the Progressive Party in Glasgow several years since. The Progressives
were public-spirited, independent-minded men, invariably businessmen,
free from the party whips' constraints and concerned only for the common
good of their city. Moreover, they were unrenumerated, unlike today's
councillors.
Is it a case of sour grapes due to the ''flagship'' of Toryism in
Scotland, Eastwood, being placed under new management and a nascent
Independent councillor being unsympathetic to Tory policies? Isn't an
Independent a nonconformist by definition? Mr Pearce was given a mandate
to display individualism, not to be a Conservative adherent.
The incursion of the Conservative Party in Glasgow was motivated by
its desire to introduce party politics in George Square. What was
achieved was the ensuring of a Labour-countrolled council ever since and
most probably sine die. It was also counter-productive to there ever
being non-partisan local government.
It cannot be gainsaid that there are many who would vote for
Progressive (or Independent) candidates but could never bring themselves
to support a Conservative contender.
The former Glasgow Lord Provost Peter T McCann, in his letter (April
19), confirmed that large majorities are unhealthy for democracy and
such is unarguable as we have experienced from Westminster these last 16
years.
Brian Meek, the self-styled Colinton Conservative Councillor, in his
latest submission to The Herald displayed many misgivings for his party,
following its disaster at the recent local elections, as well he might,
but an apology is overdue to those who are sincerely apolitical whether
Independent, Moderate, or Progressive.
If he is so out of kilter with his party, I respectfully suggest he,
like other mavericks, offers himself as a Colinton Independent. He may
have to, anyhow, as his party may well consider him ''not one of us''.

IN the interest of fair play could I mention one area where this
Government is doing quite a lot, and this is in the export market to
Russia.
It pays for the teaching of businessmen to be shown the Western ways
of doing business, and Glasgow and Edinburgh are in the vanguard of this
costly exercise. It is now beginning to show fruit, and agricultural
products, Irn Bru, Tennents, McEwans, and many others have established
themselves in this vital market.
John Brown's of Clydebank were one of the first to start trading,
before the Government became interested and now the baker from the east
coast has opened another shop in St Petersburg.
Thinking of all the defections from Mr Major, the great David suffered
in the same way when his son from one of his adventures wanted the high
place.
But there was one touching incident for David in this crisis when
Ittai the outsider refused to leave him. Here is Ittai replying to
David's offer to save his and his people's lives:
''As the Lord liveth, and as my Lord the king liveth, surely in what
place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there
also shall thy servant be. And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over.
And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little
ones that were with him and all the people passed over, toward the way
of the wilderness.''
Maybe Mr Major will yet find an Ittai or two.

WHEN I read about the financial problems currently confronting
Edinburgh Festival Theatre I had two specific reactions.
First, it seemed most ironic that Lord Younger, who almost
single-handedly was responsible for creating legislation to curb
so-called ''excessive and unreasonable'' expenditure by local
authorities, should now be queueing up with his begging-bowl to be
bailed out of his current problems as chair of the Theatre Trust.
Perhaps, when pressures are less, Lord Younger can explain why paying
for home-helps, specialist teachers, and concessionary travel for the
elderly and disabled is ''excessive dand unreasonable'' while
bankrolling his pet projects is not.
Secondly, when the Festival Theatre initiative was being launched much
was made of the joint public/private-sector nature of the funding
arrangements for the project.
As I am somewhat sceptical of the reality of joint arrangements,
before decisions are made about a rescue package, perhaps Lord Younger
can tell me exactly what the private-sector contribution is to date and
what expectation he has of realistic future private-sector
contributions.

I NOTE with some dismay that, having paid by automated payments, I
have again overpaid Hydro Electric #27 for the second year running.
Last year I assumed that an increase in Hydro costs were likely to
even this out, but no, I'm still overpaid.
Their letter states that they have revised my automated payments and
now I will pay #26 per month. This is exactly the amount I paid last
year.
I phoned the Hydro Board, complained, and was quickly assured that
they would refund the overpayment. All their customers should know about
this. I shouldn't have to phone them to get my money which they
obviously want to hold for two years.

HOW pleased I was to read George Craig's letter for several reasons
(April 28): by growing his own tatties, he's avoiding the spiralling
prices which seem to be fast approaching the fillet-steak and
smoked-salmon bracket.
If even a handful of gardeners follow his example and grow them, from
the first time they will enjoy the thrill of dining on their first crop;
and, by mentioning champ, he may open the door for many who only
recognise the spud when boiled, mashed, or chipped.
On a visit to the States I left behind not only many old and new
friends but also recipes for champ (their syboes are scallions),
stovies, bubble and squeak, clapshot, colcannon, and rumbledethumps. I
add potatoes to this although the purists probably wouldn't agree!

I REFER to the Rev Stewart Lamont's comments on Lord Osborne's
judgment (as from the Court of Session) in lifting his interim interdict
against the Presbytery of Dumbarton (April 27).
As stated in the judgment The Church of Scotland Act of 1921 ''was a
recognition by (the Westminster) Parliament of certain pre-existing
powers (vested) in The Church of Scotland rather than the conferring of
powers upon it''.
I would suggest that such ''pre-existing powers'' are perhaps best
appreciated in the context of Andrew Melville's words to James VI, King
of Scots: ''There are two kings and two kingdoms in Scotland. There is
James the Sixth, and there is Christ Jesus and His Kingdom in the Kirk.
Whose subject King James the Sixth is, and of Whose Kingdom not a king
nor a head nor a lord, but a member.''
For this reason the Parliament of Scotland specifically declared in
its treaty with England (Commissioners) Act of 1705 that the status of
the Church of Scotland was not negotiable.
Further, the Scots Parliament also ensured that provisions for the
security of the Church were inserted in both the Scottish and English
Acts of (Parliamentary) Union of 1707 as ''a fundamental and essential
condition of the said Treaty or Union in all time coming''.
It should also be appreciated that the Westminster Parliament derives
its authority to legislate on matters Scottish from such Acts of Union
of 1707 and, accordingly, has ''no power to alter or repeal those
provisions (for the security of the Church of Scotland). Any attempt to
do so (such were the precautions then observed) would amount to a
dissolution of the Union'' (Lord Justice-Clerk Hope, Court of Session,
1808).
Further, the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Church of
Scotland on matters of doctrine, worship, discipline, and government
cannot be subject to review by any international court or tribunal.
The Westminster Parliament cannot transfer any sovereignty which it
does not possess to the European Court of Human Rights or whatever.
''The principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a
distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish
constitutional law'' (Lord President Cooper, Court of Session, 1953).

I was astonished to read that the only ferry left to Skye would be the
Mallaig-Armadale crossing after the bridge opened. Gavin Bell obviously
has never heard of the Glenelg-Kylerhea ferry, which is a great pity as
it is one of the most interesting ways of getting to Skye or returning.

<TEXT>
AROUND 80 people will soon have a unique piece of Scottish jewellery
worth more than its weight in gold -- thanks to a chance discovery while
a road was being driven from a croft to a peat stack on Lewis almost 10
years ago.
A party of visiting geologists from Edinburgh University, completing a
survey of Britain, were intrigued by the formation of rocks being used
for the foundations.
As they walked along the crofter's track they identified a xenolithic
dike -- a molten mass injected by volcanic action into fissures within
the rock -- which included the rare occurrence of corundum, the mineral
that in its purest state forms sapphire or ruby.
The find was so rare that the area was immediately declared a site of
special scientific interest, although none of the crystals examined
turned out to be of gem quality.
Years went by with the SSI status preventing further digging at the
site, but last year a team from Edinburgh Gemmological Society gained
permission to sift through the rubble. Within 10 minutes Mr Ian Combe,
of Sutherland, regarded as one of Britain's finest gem cutters, was on
the verge of making history . . . and a fortune.
For after examining a ''likely-looking'' football-sized boulder, he
split it to reveal a giant 242-carat sapphire crystal, estimated to be
worth a minimum of #70,000, plus a fragment weighing almost 40 carats.
''We believe this to be the only discovery of gem quality sapphire in
the UK,'' said Fife jeweller Mr Roy Murray, who has clinched a deal with
Mr Combe to make jewellery at Balbirnie Craft Centre, Markinch, from the
80 gemstones the crystal is expected to yield.
The 24 cut stones of one carat or over and another 60 weighing just
under half a carat were likely to be ''the total world production of gem
quality Scottish sapphire,'' said Mr Murray.

ONE of the Scottish Regional Award winners in the Government's
National Languages for Export Campaign has gone on to win at the second
DTI Languages for Export Awards ceremony at the Conference Forum,
Aldgate, in London. The awards, presented by Sir Peter Parker, chairman
of the campaign and television personality Chantal Cuer, attracted 268
entries from 176 companies and organisations.
Trinity Academy of Edinburgh won the Associated Examining Board Award,
one of two Curriculum Innovation Awards, for its development of a
curriculum which has ''gone beyond the confines of the classroom,
placing linguistic and cultural awareness at the heart of the school and
forging links between schools, community businesses and countries''.
Since 1991, Trinity Academy has operated a European Work Experience
Programme, which began with pupils working in shops, offices, banks and
a local radio station in Western France.
By 1993 this had expanded, with 50 pupils living and working in
France, Denmark, and Holland. This year, Sweden will be added to the
list of countries where pupils will take up work placements.
Trinity Academy has been nationally recognised as preparing its young
people for full lives as Europeans.
At the awards ceremony, Trade Minister Richard Needham congratulated
all the winners and offered a few words to exporters on the importance
of breaking down language barriers.
He advised: ''Learn at least a few words of the language before you go
abroad. It could save you a great deal of inconvenience and frustration
when travelling but it will also delight your hosts.
''Do not worry about obtaining a perfect command of the language
before speaking. You don't have to be fluent to show you mean business,
leave complex negotiations and legal or contractual issues to the
language professional.
''Remember that most foreign companies are happy to sell to us in
English, but prefer to buy from us in their own language. As Willy
Brandt said on a visit to London: 'If I'm selling to you, I speak your
language, if I'm buying. . . . . dann mussen Sie Deutsch sprechen'.
Language skills represent an investment in our trading future.''

<HEADLINE>Mons Meg tale under fire in planning row</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AN AGE-OLD controversy about Mons Meg, the cannon in Edinburgh Castle,
has been revived because of plans to alter a cottage near Castle Douglas
in Kirkcudbrightshire.
According to local legend, the big gun was forged in a smithy where
the cottage at No 7 The Buchan now stands overlooking Carlingwark Loch.
The owners, retired police sergeant, Mr Bill Carcas, and his wife,
Maureen, want to build an extension. However, more than 200 people have
singed a petition objecting, and during the outcry the Mons Meg
connection has been raised.
At meetings with the area planner, the Carcas's next-door neighbour,
Mr James Waugh, pointed out that there is evidence of a forge at the
cottage, which is still known as The Smithy.
The planning application was continued to try to establish the facts.
It will be reconsidered today when the regional planning committee will
be told the Carcas's original proposal has been modified.
A report, recommending approval, confirms there is a local tradition
that the cannon was forged at The Buchan and used in the siege of nearby
Threave Castle in 1455.
However, it quotes from Maxwell's 1922 Guide Book to the Stewartry of
Kirkcudbright, which states: ''The legend must give way in the light of
history and the entries in the Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer.
There are many interesting traditions but for facts one must consult the
Exchequer Rolls. The weapon is more likely to have been forged at Mons,
at that period a great depot for arms.''
The report says that if there was any firm basis for the tradition
that Mons Meg was cast at The Buchan, it is likely Historic Scotland
would have given consideration to listing the cottages. It also claims
there is no evidence of a forge chimney.

BEING an island, Britain has always seen sea transport as vital to
successful trading with the rest of the world, and for many years has
been expert in building, owning and operating large fleets of ships.
One hundred years ago, 50% of the world's merchant fleet was British,
but two world wars, a depression in the Thirties and a recession in the
Eighties have all taken their toll.
Added to that was the substantial market share gained by the emerging
nations, who offered a cheaper service than their British and European
counterparts.
In 1995, the picture is very different. The industry has taken stock
and has grown leaner and fitter, and is now better able to meet the
needs of the modern trade market, especially in the wider area of
shipping dependent activities.
Around 50,000 people are employed in these areas, which include port
management, cargo handling and distribution, ship technology and various
other related matters, in addition to those working in supportive
commercial activities.
A UK Shipping Industry Critical Level Study published in 1990 looked
at the number of people employed in the shipping industry to help
identify future manpower needs.
One of its conclusions was that there were sound economic reasons for
UK citizens to remain involved in training, technical operations and the
communication aspects of shipping, to provide expertise for the wider
marine-related activities and to have a capability of exploiting new
trading opportunities and resources from the sea.
In fact, there is a requirement for 1000 British merchant navy
officers to migrate from sea-going to shore-based employment.
Historically, the recruits for these shore-based jobs would have come
from sea-based positions, but given the decline in the merchant fleet
during the Eighties there is a shortage of people for these positions.
There is also a growing demand for people with more general shipping
experience.
''That is one of our reasons for setting up the HND in Maritime
Studies,'' explains Jef Forshaw, head of the Faculty of Maritime Studies
at Glasgow College of Nautical Studies. ''This course attempts to meet
the demand in the industry for people with a knowledge of ships, school
leavers as well as mature students, with perhaps no experience but a
definite interest in working in the area of commercial shipping.''
The HND in Maritime Studies, the only course of its kind in Scotland,
is a basic qualification for those wishing to specialise in maritime
applications. It also serves as an alternative entry qualification for
the BSc degree course in Maritime Studies run at Plymouth University,
Liverpool, and Southampton Institute of Higher Education.
It is unit-based, and students can choose to study from various
marine-based subjects including Marine Business and Commerce, Marine
Environment, Marine Navigation, Marine Operations and Marine Technology.

ONE of our household has lately been given an orange badge for the car
because of his disability and it has already been most helpful for
hospital visits, shopping, etc.
The first non-essential outing was to be a meeting in our prestigious
concert hall on Monday morning. I duly drove up on Sunday to find out
where the disabled parking was and how one managed the steps inside.
The apologetic young man on duty told me there was no disabled parking
or other aid. The nearest disabled parking was in Cambridge Street, alas
too far on a wet morning.
If I've missed something I'd like to know, but if I am correct that
there is no better help I apologise to all the others who've been
struggling much longer when it did not affect us.
No more meetings in places without easy access.

ONE of my first actions on a Monday morning used to be turning to the
back page of The Herald. No, not to read the report on how Hibs
performed on Saturday, but to read Murray Ritchie's well-informed and
penetrating comments on the European political scene. I would then turn
for a chuckle to Brian Meek. As this dynamic duo have been split up, I
now have to turn to the centre pages on Monday to read the Euroview.
You could imagine my surprise when I found myself to be the subject of
Murray Ritchie's column (April 24). I was very surprised and highly
flattered; we Scottish Euro MPs are used to mining away in almost total
obscurity.
Murray Ritchie appeared to detect the ''heavy hand of Labour's
play-safe leadership'' in the approach I have taken in my new report on
the Development of the European Union, which will help form the European
Parliament's strategy for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, or
Maastricht II as it has been called.
This was not the case. Although Tony Blair surely does lead the Labour
Party every bit as much as John Major follows his party, Mr Blair's
leadership does not extend to the Strasbourg Parliament.
The reality is that politics is the art of the possible. There is no
point in drawing up vast blueprints for a European utopia if we are
moving too fast for the citizens of the European Union. We must be able
to take the people with us. The building of European Union must be
evolutionary, not revolutionary.
My initial working premise in drawing up my report was to be
practical, to propose reforms which have a chance of gaining a consensus
and being implemented. What we are trying to achieve is a more
efficient, more open and more democratically accountable European Union.
That takes time. Above all it takes the support of the people. Working
towards that end is my prime objective.
Having said that, I am not opposed to the election of a Labour
Government in the UK. In the long term it would make the achievement of
my aims in Europe much more likely, as they have to be negotiated by
governments. In the short term it would mean that the UK would
immediately sign up for the European Social Chapter. Not a bad
achievement in itself.

IN reply to Duncan Macdonald's short question on large classes and

Are teachers (competent or otherwise) responsible for producing bright

who give their offspring input and stimulation from day one and continue
to support them throughout their school career?

<HEADLINE>INLA denies ceasefire report with added violence warning</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978600147</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE republican INLA terrorist organisation denied yesterday that it
had called a permanent ceasefire.
It said it was unconvinced the current peace process was a viable
alternative to violence for achieving its aims.
In a statement issued through the Irish Republican Socialist Publicity
Bureau, the organisation claimed remarks made in a Dublin court last
week did not mean it had called a ceasefire.
A ''suspension of military operations'' was a ''tactical cessation''
designed to allow dialogue between its political spokesmen and
government intermediaries and other republicans. This remained under
review.
''At present we are unconvinced about the current peace process as a
viable alternative for achieving our socialist republican aims. However,
we remain to be convinced,'' the statement said.
''We support a just and lasting peace. Ideally that would be of a
non-violent approach to achieving the basic republican aim of a British
withdrawal from Ireland. Unfortunately, in our view there is presently
no programme that constitutes such an alternative.''
The INLA said the past few months had shown the ''obvious disdain''
Britain showed to republicans adopting a non-violent approach.
Meanwhile, an IRA man jailed for 25 years in January for plotting bomb
attacks in England has been transferred to a Northern Ireland prison, it
was confirmed yesterday.
Robert Fryers, 44, from west Belfast, was sentenced at the Old Bailey
with Hugh Jack, 37, from Sauchie, Clackmannanshire for planning the
terror campaign.
The Northern Ireland Office said Fryers had been transferred in the
last few days, the 11th IRA man to be moved to an Ulster jail to make
visiting easier for their families.
More than two dozen IRA men in English jails are still waiting for a
transfer to Northern Ireland prisons.
Fryers's wife Maura said the family were delighted her husband was
back on home soil but added: ''We feel bad about the rest of the
prisoners. If this can happen for Rab then it can happen for the rest of
them.''
She said the family would now be applying for her husband to be given
parole to visit his mother in hospital.
After being sentenced at the Old Bailey, Fryers made a short statement
from the dock, telling the court: ''I am not guilty of a criminal
offence. When I came to this country I believed what I was doing was
right and still believe that.''
However, he said that he hoped the peace process would work and that
his would be one of the last republican cases to come before a British
court.

THE Bosnian ceasefire, which was not a cessation but rather a slowdown
of killing, has expired. At the same time the Croatians have launched a
major attack on rebel Serbs. If there is a coincidence in these events
it is a devilish one, for taken together they significantly increase the
chances of war in Bosnia and possibly Croatia breaking out again. This
will probably not happen at once, although the new fighting in Croatia
is ominous. A more likely development is of a slow build-up in military
operations leading to all-out war by the summer. If this is probable, it
is wise to say that it is not certain. There is always a possibility
that more arm-twisting and persuasion by the great powers and by the UN
might persuade the various warlords to reverse their plans. Lord Owen,
on learning of the latest attack by the Croatians yesterday, spoke
cryptically of action that could be taken. He appears to hold out hope
that the European Union's actions in shielding the Croatians from having
measures taken against them in the past by the UN Security Council,
might give the EU leverage now.
It has to be said that this is whistling in the wind. The sad fact is
that the leaders of the Bosnian government, the Croatian government, and
the various desperadoes who lead the Serbs, appear convinced that they
can get their own way through fighting. In the case of the Bosnians and
the Croatians, this self-confidence is growing; in the case of the Serbs
it begins to take on tinges of desperation. The depth of determination
to restart the hostilities should not be underestimated. The votes for
fighting among the participants simply outweigh the really brave
elements, who are the peacemakers.
The implications for both peacemakers and peacekeepers are clear.
Nato's plans for a possible withdrawal of forces are being upgraded with
the dispatch to former Yugoslavia of communications experts who would
play a crucial role in any withdrawal. This is still regarded as a
last-gasp option, partly because it would be extremely dangerous and
very expensive, not to mention politically embarrassing. In the
meantime, the best chance of rescuing anything from this long-standing
debacle lies with the arm-twisters employed by the major powers to try
to negotiate peace. The Foreign Ministers from the five-nation Contact
Group will meet tomorrow. Mr Douglas Hurd is right when he says that the
only hope of peace is diplomacy. This is not a fashionable notion, but
the  alternative is the spilling of a great deal more blood.

WHAT price books? Are they value for money, or are they too expensive?
This week sees the first major breach of the Net Book Agreement, the
long-established practice by which books are sold at a fixed price.
Books are almost the last remaining bastion of retail price maintenance,
a lonely edifice that looks about to fall. As a result of the publisher
Hodder's decision to pull out of the agreement, Asda shoppers are now
able to pop into their trolleys, along with the soap powder, John le
Carre's new novel Our Game for just over #8, half the price on the
dustjacket. No doubt other outlets will follow. This may start a price
war in which books, just like any other commodity for sale, may be
heavily discounted at will. On the face of it, a victory for the
consumer.
In fact relatively few books will fall into this category. Anyone
hoping to find All the Sweets of Being: A Life of James Boswell
(official price #17.50) or Scotland and Ireland in the Age of Revolution
(#35), both reviewed in last Saturday's Herald, at the local supermarket
for under a tenner will be disappointed. The snips will be the hot
bestsellers, which besides John le Carre may include the latest first
novels purportedly by top models, or breathless biographies of Princess
Di. Hodder Headline's chief executive predicts that his action will
''set the agenda for the future expansion of the book market in
general'', a fine thing if it happens.
Some more pessimistic forecasts have been made. Far from leading to a
general reduction in book prices, the abandonment of the Net Book
Agreement could result in a rise in the price of all but a few. Since
discounted prices will reduce profits, smaller bookshops and publishers
will be hard hit and, unable to compete with larger stores, may even be
forced out of business. This would be particularly damaging in Scotland,
where a diversity of small publishing businesses has kept the flame of
Scottish cultural identity alive in spite of considerable economic
pressures.
The books such houses publish tend to have relatively small print runs
and are therefore particularly vulnerable to the harsh laws of the mass
market. In such a case the continued support of the Scottish Arts
Council -- which has a good track record in the support of literature
and has so far, unlike its English counterpart, escaped controversy in
that department -- will be the more urgent. Perhaps in the end the worst
fears may prove groundless. Otherwise, for some publishers and
booksellers -- not to mention readers -- this could be the writing on
the wall.

IT took long after VE Day before the full fruits of victory came home.
Months and months passed before bananas were back. Not until December
were the first of the few of them in the shops and under the counter.
Some of us did not know what they were. Young people today have not been
told the half of it, oh no they haven't.
Bananas were made a weapon of war. Important people told us fibs about
them. Nanas were no good, they said. We were better off without them.
Later, they explained that their falsehoods had been to avoid giving
succour to the enemy. But for four years of the fighting they lied. We
took it bravely. They had lied about nearly everything else.
So, yes, we had no bananas. Doing without and collecting wastepaper
were how schooldays were spent beating the Hun and keeping the country
safe for democracy.
Only afterwards was it revealed whom to blame. He turned out to be a
benign dictator and happy spoilsport, although a liar just the same. His
name was Lord Woolton. He had been a poor boy who made good. Once a
social worker, he rose (or fell) to become boss of a lot of shops.
Wartime shot him even higher. He was given the job of determining the
nation's diet. Every mouthful that anybody was allowed to eat was down
to Lord W. In April, l940, he was made Minister of Food.
One problem on his plate was fruit. A decision about it needed a
Solomon. Oranges or bananas? That was the choice. Lord Woolton had to
pick one or the other. Having both would be too much. At the Ministry of
Food, where they knew best, they ruled that a reliable supply of one
fruit should be preferred to dicey imports of several.
Oranges it was. Bananas were banned. Just like that, it was official.
Woolton had decided wisely. Oranges could be shipped as concentrated
juice, taking up less space on cargo boats. Besides, banana carriers
were speedier than most merchantmen. They had been built to bring in
their loads before they became too ripe.
On voyages across the Atlantic and from Africa the banana boats were
too fleet for the convoys of ships which huddled together for some
protection from U-boats, convoys moving at the rate of the slowest.
Because such information was seen as secret, and might be of some
vague comfort to the Hun, it was withheld from the lieges. Lies filled
the gap. Bananas were berated instead.
Government propaganda insisted they were of low value. Official
advertising in the papers and in picture houses insisted there was
nothing in them compared with garden vegetables. Carrots were crowned
king; potatoes became of national importance.
Echoes of this stuff fed to a credulous people have been captured at
Not as bad as it might have been, a wartime exhibition at Paisley
Museum.
It is an eerily evocative show and spot-on about those days. Survivors
of bananalessness will imagine they can hear the drone of Heinkel
bombers overhead. For it was a conceit of the time to know in the dark
which aeroplanes were theirs and which ours.
Starring at the exhibition are Potato Pete and Dr Carrot, cartoon
characters who carried Lord Woolton's message to the people. For
visitors who dare, Pete and his pal have recipes to give out for potato
pancakes, carrot pudding, and other patriotic grub that dished Hitler.
To anybody who will listen Dr Carrot, otherwise a player from the
town's youth theatre, will confide that, yes, he did help people to see
in the dark. ''I'm good for beauty too,'' he tells you. That'll be
right.
Seldom right have been any times for bananas. It took l0 years of
peace for their trade to recover to its level before the war.
Away back at the start of the century when they began to be imported
commercially, they had enemies even then. Nanas were seen as harmful to
horses. Warning was given that they would break their legs on abandoned
skins. Such bad news has been followed by worse. Think of what
dictionaries do.
Bananas! means nuts or crazy. A banana republic signifies a dicky
economy, and banana oil was gibberish.
Politicians use bananas to unzip insults. Anthony Eden, the Foreign
Secretary for most of the Hitler war, was called the original banana
man, being yellow on the outside, while inside he was a softer yellow.
Banana boats was the cheeky name RAF pilots had for the navy's aircraft
carriers.
And banana skin, meaning the cause of a downfall, persists as a weary
metaphor, although now befriended only by political journalists of an
age to remember the war.
What's forgotten is how great a disappointment followed. Vera Lynn,
the Forces' Sweetheart, likes to tell how she brought back a small bunch
from a concert tour of the troops in Burma. Graciously she gave a banana
to the first child she met. He spat it out.
Despite the worst that Lord Woolton could do, some of the forbidden
fruit did elude his ban. Mariners would sneak a cluster home in their
seabags, which was how bananas first reached Britain last century.
A Paisley childhood used not to be complete without hearing more than
once about a generous matelot who, defying Woolton, brought ashore a
bundle from his ship at the tail of the bank. On the Greenock train he
opened his parcel to treat two children in the compartment to a whole
banana apiece. Their mother explained how to unpeel them.
Neither kid was keen to go first. The girl, being braver, tried a bite
just as the train went into a tunnel. ''Don't eat it,'' she cried to her
big brother. ''It makes you blind.''

FREED Scottish hostage Calum Murray finally arrived back at his
Hebridean island home of Lewis, yesterday.
The 25-year-old roads engineer, who was held for almost six months by
rebels in Sierra Leone, flew to Stornoway with his girlfriend,
Bristol-born Voluntary Service Overseas worker Liz Taylor.
Mr Murray was released with other European captives and flown to the
UK on Saturday, April 22, and spent a few days in a hotel with his
widowed mother, Katie Ann, brothers Iain, 27, and Norman, 23, and sister
Karen, 17.
It was then discovered he had malaria and he was admitted to St
Pancras Hospital, London, from where he was released yesterday.

THOUSANDS of people are having their lives shortened by diabetes which
goes undiagnosed, doctors and other healthcare professionals will be
told at a conference in Glasgow tonight.
Dr Ian Campbell, former chairman of the Scottish committee of the
British Diabetic Association, says that for every one of the estimated
600,000 people in Britain known to have non insulin-dependent diabetes,
another goes undiagnosed.
''This is very worrying because if diabetes is untreated it will
reduce life expectancy by about eight to 10 years,'' he said yesterday.
''If the patient develops it between 40 and 60 years of age, it can
reduce life expectancy by about 30%.''
Although most late-onset diabetics do not need regular insulin
injections they may require dietary control, weight-reduction measures,
and oral drugs.
Complications associated with non insulin-dependent diabetes include
blindness, kidney failure, gangrene and heart disease.

GOURMETS agree that pastry is one of the great culinary inventions of
the post-classical world, but the name of its creator remains unknown.
Unless some document is discovered, the history of pies will for ever be
incomplete. Of Scotland's later role in their development there is
little doubt. Even the mysterious nursery rhyme Sing a Song of Sixpence,
about a pie containing live blackbirds, is sung to the Scottish dance
tune Calder Fair.
The original ''Scotch pie'', made with minced lamb or mutton, is still
as popular as ever, and its raised lip has allowed important gastronomic
evolution. It not only provides a well for gravy, and too much brown
sauce, but has latterly made room for mashed potatoes and baked beans.
It might be thought that the great Scottish pie, the Forfar Bridie,
would have shown similar enterprise, but it remains solidly traditional,
with only two varieties on offer -- those with one hole indicating meat
only, and those with two holes, which have onion.
Forfar supports more independent shops that most small towns. Several
bakers claim the authentic recipe, but the identity of the original
''Bridie'' -- said to be the diminutive of a local cook called Bridget
-- remains unproved. As a pie it is superior to the Cornish pasty,
containing far more meat, although with the modern taste for oriental
spices, it is now somewhat old-fashioned. Dull or not, at least Forfar
has been spared the ordeal of Falmouth, where one Stephen Growcutt
offered Cornish pasties with no fewer than 16 different flavours. The
odours from his bakery were so violent that an abatement order was
served by his district council, and Mr Growcutt has been fined #2000 for
failing to comply. We may never be sure who made the first Forfar

TWO giant sculptures with an aviation theme are to grace the front of
Prestwick Airport terminal building and a new car park.
They will be funded by National Lottery cash.
The ''public art'' venture is among a dozen projects awarded a total
of #300,000 of lottery money by the Scottish Arts Council yesterday.
The sculptures, by Aberdeen artist Carole Gray, will, according to the
airport, make a valuable cultural statement to those flying into
Scotland as well as being of benefit to the Scottish public.
The choice of venue for the #90,000 sculptures was welcomed by the
Scottish Arts Lobby's Eric Robinson who said his organisation supported
the concept of public art in front of one of the gateways into the
country.
Other winners given cash in the second round of Arts Council awards
include Plockton, picturesque setting of the BBC drama series, Hamish
Macbeth. The Wester Ross village is to get #62,435 to add an exhibition
space and foyer on to its village hall.
The aim, said the council, is to promote artistic activity in the
area.
Stirling's MacRobert Arts Centre is to get #9000 for an architectural
design competition; Glasgow's NVA arts organisation is to get more than
#70,000 for a state-of-the-art lighting and sound system, while
Edinburgh's Gilded Balloon Theatre gets cash for a feasibility study
into the design of the venue.
The Arts Council's National Lottery director, Mr David Bonnar, said
the organisation was keen to promote new art and craftwork.
''Plockton'', he announced, ''will lead the way in showing how lottery
funds can promote opportunities for Scotland's artists.''
The Scottish Sports Council also announced lottery money grants
yesterday, this time totalling #230,000 to 11 Scottish sports
organisations.
Mr Graeme Simmers, chairman, said the potential of the lottery was
enormous.
All of the awards were for less than #50,000. The largest, for
#40,000, went to Deeside all-weather training area, Banchory, and would
help to provide a new playing facility with floodlighting.
The smallest award of #4500 went to Stewartry Unit 558 Sea Cadet
Corps, Kirkcudbright, to enhance shower facilities.
The others were: Highland Gliding Club, Elgin, #22,000, to buy the
Easterton airstrip from the Rothes estate; Findhorn Bowling and Tennis
Club, Moray, #10,700 for upgrading of courts; Ardrossan Academicals
Rugby Football Club, #24,000 to upgrade changing facilities; West Linton
Tennis Club, #29,900 to upgrade three courts; Corstorphine Lawn Tennis
Club, Edinburgh, #27,800 to upgrade courts; Hawick Bowling Club, #26,600
to extend club house; Loch Tay Racing Club, Kenmore, #16,600 to buy
sailing boats; West Calder Bowing Club, #9606 for improvements; Wigtown
District Council, #19,800 to upgrade tennis courts at Portpatrick.

Arran could soon be an air hop from the mainland, but as Iain Wilson,
Chief Reporter, discovers there is fierce competition over siting an
airstrip
AT long last the isle of Arran is close to getting an airstrip. Not
everyone is rejoicing, especially farmer Colin Currie and his wife
Isabel.
Their land at Balmichael was the recommended location in a report by
respected aviation consultants commissioned in 1989 by the then
Highlands and Islands Development Board.
The couple cannot understand why establishment figures are still
pursuing -- and receiving public money for -- a bid to built the strip
on a windswept, clifftop site at Drumadoon.
In the feasibility study, Donald Butler Associates Ltd said Drumadoon
was not recommended for several reasons:
* Its ''immediate proximity'' to The Doon, a rock outcrop rising some
100ft above the proposed runway level and within 500ft of the runway
centreline.
* High ground to the north, rising to more than 300ft above runway
level and penetrating the obstacle clearance surfaces for take-off and
approach funnels.
* Wind turbulence on The Doon and the coastal cliffs in general.
A planning application for a Drumadoon grass airstrip has been lodged
by the Shiskine Valley Trust. It has received more than #3000 from
Argyll and Islands Enterprise towards the bid.
AIE has also hired a consultant to estimate how much it would cost to
finance the environmental impact assessment requested from the trust by
the planning authority, Cunninghame District Council.
Mr Robin Crawford is chairman of Shiskine Valley Trust, founded within
months of the Butler report rejecting Drumadoon. He is also a director
of AIE. Drumadoon, in tourist parlance, is a stone's throw from the
Kinloch Hotel in Blackwaterfoot -- jointly owned by Crawford and two
others.
These links haunt the Curries, aghast that Butler's recommendations
have fallen despite the Civil Aviation Authority's safety regulation
group describing the consultants as very competent and respected, and
advising: ''It would be prudent for anyone contemplating the setting up
of an aerodrome to heed their advice.''
Today, Butler remains sceptical of the value of a grass airstrip to
islanders: it will, he says, be no asset or comfort to injured or ill
people who still have to go by ferry to the mainland when it is
unserviceable in bad weather.
Crawford admitted his hotel would profit from increased custom should
Drumadoon be built. He is not embarrassed by his direct relationships
with AIE, the trust, and the hotel. ''We are,'' he said, ''as pure as
the driven snow.''
Other central characters at Drumadoon, where the airstrip would be
unlicensed because CAA criteria could not be met, include Mr Ronnie Mann
and Mr Charles Currie.
Mann is chairman of Isle of Arran Tourist Organisation, a driving
force behind the original idea to use Drumadoon, but not a member of the
Shiskine Valley Trust. He admitted his upmarket Auchrannie Country House
Hotel in Brodick would benefit from the high-value visitors expected to
use light aircraft to reach the island.
Currie is manager of the Arran tourist office, a member of the trust,
and son of the late Rev James Currie. The family owned the Drumadoon
site until 1990, when their farm was sold for #190,000.
The new owner has agreed to lease the airstrip site for ''a peppercorn
rent'' to the trust.
The idea behind the trust, in which 10 volunteers invested #100 each,
is to identify projects that would be of benefit to the area, then apply
for grants that would not normally go to a commercial developer.
Crawford, Mann, and Currie insist the Drumadoon grass strip would
benefit the island community.
Arran has sought an airstrip since the early 1970s when a bid
collapsed after failure to agree a price on land.
The idea was resurrected in 1988 by Arran Tourist Board, who
approached the CAA, Loganair, and the Army on possibilities for an 800m
grass strip at Drumadoon, for use by light aircraft and, possibly,
charter planes up to Twin Otter size.
The campaign, which included a public meeting chaired by Mann at his
hotel, received a huge boost in 1989 when HIDB commissioned a #7000
study for aerodromes at Arran, Coll, and Fort William.
But the findings proved startling for Drumadoon's backers. Butler came
down strongly against grass strips anywhere in the Highlands and Islands
because of limited use in soft, wet ground conditions -- common in the
area.
He said surface conditions are particularly important for light
aircraft. He warned that wet grass and soft ground could significantly
increase take-off runs, and might even prevent aircraft ever reaching
take-off speed. Similarly, landing performance could be seriously
reduced on muddy or dusty surfaces.
Butler ''firmly recommended'' all airstrips should be paved to provide
all-weather reliability and maximum crosswind capability. They would be
able to accept a wider range of aircraft and, most importantly, offer
''improved safety''.
Each would cost about #1m, but he argued they were more likely to
attract grant aid than grass airstrips which would be out of action for
much of the year.
His report contained one more shock for Drumadoon's supporters -- Mr
Colin Currie and his wife at Balmichael Farm, about three miles away,
heard about Butler's visit to Arran and made their land available.
Of Balmichael, Butler said: ''This is the recommended site. The land
is substantially level and offers good alignment clear of natural
high-ground obstacles.''
Of Drumadoon, he said: ''Technically a runway could be constructed . .
. it is not recommended that this option is pursued.''
Butler, based at Redhill Aerodrome, Surrey, today recalls the
impression given by Drumadoon's sponsors was that the airstrip would be
used to boost leisure and tourist interests.
However, he believed the HIDB wanted a project that would ''benefit
all the community, put Arran on the map, and create a network of
aerodromes across the Highlands and Islands''.
Butler said his remit was to consider aerodromes that would provide
all-weather operations, accommodate hospital and emergency services, and
provide reliable air links for the local community in addition to
high-value tourism and corporate use. He said a paved Balmichael would
offer such operations long term, and be capable of achieving licensed
status.
The only advantage a grassed Drumadoon would have was that it would be
less expensive in the short term, but he forecast it would be out of
service for months every year, and added: ''If anyone is serious about
an airstrip for use by the island for a long period, then money should
not be wasted at Drumadoon but spent at Balmichael.''
He warned life would be ''more difficult'' for pilots in turbulent
conditions at Drumadoon which, he also insisted, would have to transfer
elsewhere if expansion were ever considered.
Drumadoon sits beside a 12-hole golf course, and is close to the
48-bedroom Kinloch Hotel, undergoing a second-floor expansion to form
seven suites.
Mrs Currie said she could not understand why Butler's recommendations
had been ignored, even on financial grounds, because of concerns about
the rocky outcrop and high ground.
She questioned AIE's input, alleging a Drumadoon grass strip would do
little for the community.
Mrs Currie acknowledged a vested interest in Balmichael becoming the
favoured location for an aerodrome, grassed or paved. The farm, scarcely
worked now, has outline planning permission for changes of use to a
hotel with leisure facilities, and for an 18-hole golf course.
An adjacent airstrip would clearly boost prospects of a sale to a
developer, and she dismissed claims that the land was unsuitable for a
grass strip or that construction costs would soar because access was
more restricted than at Drumadoon.
Crawford said the trust investigated several sites. He claimed Mrs
Currie had been ''difficult'' to deal with, while Drumadoon land was
available ''cheap and without hassle''.
He dismissed safety fears: turbulence was worse for light aircraft
passing hangars at Glasgow Airport than at Drumadoon, where an airstrip,
on hard rock seeded with grass, would cost #160,000.
He believes a charter company would win mail and newspaper contracts,
bringing forward local delivery times. Other public benefits would
include air ambulances.
Crawford confirmed he would promote his hotel more if Drumadoon went
ahead, but argued the trust at least had continued to fight for an Arran
airstrip when the idea ''died'' because of costs associated with paved
aerodromes.
He said the airstrip could happen within months, subject to funding.
The Shiskine Valley Trust would apply for AIE grants.
Trust member Charles Currie confirmed Drumadoon could benefit Crawford
as a nearby hotelier, but added: ''That in turn benefits islanders. If
hotels do well, hopefully the island will do well. I do not think that
things should not be done just because they would benefit Crawford as
well as the community.''
Currie said he had no site preference for an airstrip. He would be
happy for one anywhere on Arran because it would attract high spenders.
He conceded Butler recommended a paved runway, but said there was no
opportunity for funding it.
Mann was adamant Drumadoon was the favoured site of Army engineers who
could keep costs down by providing the labour and plant to build a grass
strip as an exercise. However, he acknowledged the trust had also
received a quote from a private company for the work.
He insisted the Drumadoon scheme was distinct from that evisaged by
the HIDB because there was no chance of funding a paved airstrip. The
alternative would still offer fast transit links to and from Arran.
Asked what benefits the trust's plan would bring the community rather
than hoteliers, he admitted the airstrip was likely to be used by
pleasure, rather than public service, aircraft.
Mann added: ''When the trust says the community will benefit it does
not mean the community will be the biggest user. We envisage the
benefits coming via tourism.'' Some 80% of islanders depend on tourism,
so the airstrip would benefit the community.
The AIE emphasised it is in no way committed to financing the
airstrip. A spokesman said: ''Any assistance we gave would have to be
justified by economic and social benefits. A case would have to be
made.''

THE glossy magazine trumpeted its good news. ''The Pill has come of
age'', announced last month's Cosmopolitan, ''Celebrate!'' Sadly, I
won't be cracking open the champagne: I read this gem as I sat, one of
the many dozen Thursday morning regulars, in the anticoagulant clinic of
Glasgow's Stobhill Hospital. It is a busy clinic, treating patients who
have had, or are in danger of developing, a thrombosis. Blood clots.
Last October I had a blood clot on my right lung. A pulmonary
embolism, caused, so I'm told, by the Pill.
I can still barely believe it. After all, I'm only 36, I'm not
overweight, I'd given up smoking and my blood pressure has always
hovered reassuringly at the lowish end of average.
Going by the past fortnight's press and TV coverage of ''at risk''
women who took the Pill, developed blood clots and became ill or died, I
am lucky to be around to tell this tale. At least, I suppose I must be.
The fact is, I don't know enough about it -- and what little I do know
is the result of my professional perseverance when it comes to asking
questions.
Nobody has really been able to offer any conclusive explanation for my
condition, other than one hospital doctor's calm and casual remark that
''blood clots are a known risk associated with the combined pill.''
The only other benchmark I had was that towards the end of my 10-day
hospitalisation another doctor said I should take things easy back at
home because I'd had ''a signifcant illness''.
But just how significant was it -- not just for me, but for the
hundreds of thousands of women still popping the Pill each day?
My ''significant illness'' arrived as I awoke one Wednesday morning
with a gripping pain in the middle of the right side of my back. My
breathing was shallow, but I did what any self-employed person facing a
195-mile journey to a job in Thurso would do -- I gathered my papers and
got in the car.
As my partner was doing the driving, I reckoned I could relax and
forget about the pain. An asthmatic since childhood, I was convinced I
was suffering from a particularly resistant chest infection. Even so, I
soon found I wasn't able to forget about the increasing pain.
The following day, as we prepared for the long drive home, I was
beginning to feel apprehensive. The slightest movement sent burning
shards stabbing up and down my back, even the lightest of breathing met
a solid wall of pain on my right side. I couldn't turn my head, I
couldn't extend my right arm properly. I had been unable to lie down the
night before and therefore, had little sleep. My clothes were damp with
sweat. I only just remembered to take my Pill.
A visit to a Thurso GP was reassuring. He agreed with my suggestion
that I might have pleurisy, prescribing super-duper antibiotics and
co-codamol painkillers, which made no difference to my suffering.
Nevertheless, I assured my partner that I was fine, really, and we took
the scenic route home. If I coughed, I spat blood into my hanky. I did
not sleep that night, either.
On the Friday morning, I took my Pill. Then I saw my own GP. He, too,
favoured the pleurisy theory but recommended a hospital visit after the
weekend if I had not improved. He also prescribed pethidine -- a
narcotic analgesic -- for use, if necessary.
It was necessary. Pethidine didn't actually kill the pain but a
freefall drift alongside it was a welcome form of sweet release.
Saturday marked my fourth day of virtually no sleep and my barely
convincing effort of attempting to appear OK to my family. The pain was
even worse. And I was frightened. Either I fell into a lifetime of
addiction to controlled drugs or I had to face the fact that there was
something seriously wrong with me.
I forgot to take my Pill.
And then I went to my health centre again, seeing a different doctor
from my GP as it was an ''emergency'' Saturday surgery. My partner had
to come in to the doctor's room with me, not so much to hold my hand,
but to shore me up and stop me from falling over as I walked.
This doctor was clearly unconvinced. It took several attempts before I
could persuade him that I was not after more pethidine, which he was
unwilling to prescribe.
''The pethidine is not working'', I explained through gritted teeth.
He asked me to lie down for an examination, pushing me back slowly. I
cried out in pain. He asked me if I was feeling ''a little discomfort
there''.
Three days of sleeplessness and crushing pain took their toll: I was
very angry but began to cry. Tight-lipped, the doctor eventually
suggested a visit to the duty doctor at Stobhill and made the necessary
phone call. On the way, I opened the referral letter, discovering that
''anxiety'' was listed under previous medical conditions and that I was
described as ''tearful''. All true, but I couldn't help but feel this
doctor had placed me in the hysterical woman category.
I was admitted to Stobhill within minutes of seeing the duty doctor.
Doctors told me they thought I might have a blood clot on my lung, the
result of a deep vein thrombosis in my leg. Hooking me up to a drip, a
blood thinning drug began to dribble into my veins. I was asked if I had
experienced pains in my leg -- I hadn't. I was also asked if I'd
undergone a recent operation or spent some time stuck in bed. I hadn't.
But I did remember that I hadn't taken my Pill that day. A ward nurse
sought advice, telling me that I should not take it. Later, when they
told me I'd be staying in for tests, they also said the Pill was
probably to blame.
So here I am, facing one more month or so of my treatment with the
oral blood-thinner Warfarin -- which involves regular checks on blood
levels.
I still suffer from pain and a certain amount of breathing difficulty,
exacerbated by anything from smoke or car fumes to the early morning
cold. I'm waiting to be checked by a consultant, although my own GP
warns me that my lung will have suffered some form of permanent damage
and could always trouble me.
Meanwhile, I've been told never to take the contraceptive pill again.
Also, to be careful with contraception as pregnancy carries its own
risks of thrombosis. And of course, HRT will be ruled out too.
I know that I received first-class care and attention during my stay
in Stobhill. And, despite his slightly suspect attitude problem, the
doctor who eventually sent me there followed all the correct procedures.
If he appeared, initially, slow to consider a blood clot, it was because
I seemed, in his later words, too ''young and healthy.''
My own doctor -- an excellent, understanding GP -- did not hand out
the Pill in any sort of cavalier fashion. And he carried out the correct
and regular checks -- including blood pressure -- before allowing any
repeat prescription.
I'm therefore rather worried.
Perhaps it's not just ''at risk'' women who should not be given the
Pill. Perhaps many more of us are at risk than we previously realised.
Perhaps. But surely a review of the health monitoring processes is, at
the very least, an urgent necessity?
My main concern now is for my two daughters. In my ever-growing list
of wishes for their future, simple contraception and the freedom to
balance education, career and personal life obviously rate highly.
But I don't want them to die trying to achieve it.

THERE were gales of laughter -- and a few tears -- when a Who's Who of
show business stars said farewell yesterday to comic genius Peter Cook.
''He would have probably not turned up to hear this eulogy,'' admitted
Cook's partner Dudley Moore, as scores of celebrities arrived at a
memorial service for the satirical comedian.
More than 1000 people packed the church, famous faces in practically
every pew -- including new James Bond star Pierce Brosnan, comic Spike
Milligan, and former Monty Python stars John Cleese and Michael Palin.
Moore kept the tone light as he performed part of a Cook sketch,
played the piano and sang Goodbye-ee during the ceremony, helped by
pupils from Cook's old school, Radley College.
The boys also sang Love Me Tender because Cook was a lifelong Elvis
Presley fan.
''It's very strange to think of Peter having kicked the bucket,''
Moore said later.
Others mimicked Cook as they paid homage to him, but John Cleese
blinked back tears as he told the congregation: ''Peter was
extraordinarily free of ambition and envy and rancour.''
His voice almost broke completely as he whispered: ''So God bless you,
Cookie.''
However, anecdotes from playwright Alan Bennett returned the focus to
humour, as he claimed Cook's only voiced regret in life had been that he
once rescued Sir David Frost from drowning.
Sir David himself was among guests at the thanksgiving service in the
parish church of St John-at-Hampstead, north-west London, a short walk
from Cook's elegant eighteenth-century home.
''He was the first genius I was ever conscious of meeting,'' he said.
Cook, a 57-year-old father of two grown-up daughters, died in hospital
in January from severe internal bleeding, with his third wife Lin Chong
by his side.
She also attended the service and arranged for tickets to be allocated
to readers of Private Eye, the satirical magazine whose majority
shareholder was Cook -- the real-life Lord Gnome.
Comic Dave Allen, radio and TV presenter Terry Wogan, film director
Michael Winner, ''Dame Edna Everage'' impersonator Barry Humphries, past
and present Private Eye editors Richard Ingrams and Ian Hislop, and
actor Robert Powell also attended.
Moore told the congregation Cook was ''the creme de la creme, an
extraordinary wayward talent'' who was ''addicted to life and friends''.
But he said he was ''tone deaf'' and terrible at Elvis impersonations,
which he would burst into ''at the drop of a hat''.
Milligan said: ''How dare he clear off and leave us? What a terrible
thing to do, to leave us all.''
Palin said: ''He was not only the funniest and most creative of
comedians I've known in my life, but as he aged he became very
supportive of people around him, certainly of younger comedians, which
is quite something.''
Many of the new generation of comedians, who saw Cook as an elder
statesman, attended -- including Ben Elton and Harry Enfield. Mel Smith,
Griff Rhys-Jones, Hugh Laurie, and Clive Anderson were there, too.
Bennett, writer of the current film hit The Madness of King George and
Cook's colleague -- along with Moore and Jonathan Miller -- in the
review Beyond the Fringe, gave a humorous address in which he claimed
the satirist loved admiring himself in mirrors and was addicted to
reading newspapers. But he added: ''He was intolerant of humbug,
detecting it he would fly into a self-fuelling rage.''
Ingrams said he was grateful to Cook for rescuing Private Eye and went
on: ''For a man linked with satire he was without malice to anyone,
although he did admit to pursuing an irrational vendetta against the
late, great Gracie Fields.''
He would have been surprised at the spontaneous and genuine outburst
of affection following his death, Ingrams added.
The service, at which Auberon Waugh and actress Eleanor Bron also
spoke, was in marked contrast to Cook's quiet private funeral attended
by a handful of close friends and relatives.
Yesterday's service was conducted by the vicar of Hampstead, the Rev
Philip Buckler, who said Cook would be remembered for ''not only his
comic genius and original wit but also the richness of his personality
and the delight of his company''.
Before they filed out, guests were reminded of Cook's comic talents
when a recording of one of his monologues about boredom was played. In
it he said: ''I must do something with my life, something to be
remembered for . . .''
Other tributes included:
* Comic Dave Allen: ''He was a good friend, a generous man, a funny
man, but today we are celebrating his life -- we've all got to die,
let's think about the good times.''
* TV presenter Clive James: ''I wasn't a close friend but I was a
great admirer. He was a genius.''

Margaret Vaughan investigates a rapidly growing occupational hazard
FOR 19 years, Robert Atley worked among clouds of flour dust, which
clung to his overalls and clogged his lungs. He developed asthma.
The non-smoker blamed inhalation of the fine white powder in a Glasgow
bakery plant and began legal action against his employers. On the eve of
a Court of Session hearing last November, he accepted a #27,500,
out-of-court settlement by Greggs, one of the biggest retail bakers in
the UK.
The settlement, made without an admission of liability, was the first
of its kind involving a bakery worker in Scotland. It is unlikely to be
the last.
After accepting the award, Mr Atley, 45, explained: ''I didn't start
the action for compensation because I had a grudge against my employers,
but as a matter of principle, to help ensure that current health and
safety legislation is put into effect and that other bakers don't suffer
as I have.''
Now the company makes masks or respirators available for bakery
workers exposed to flour dust. And Mr Atley, who still works at the
Rutherglen plant, is out of breathing reach of the allergens in the fine
white particles of flour.
The law firm involved, Robin Thompson and Partners, is already taking
legal action on behalf of other bakers who claim to have contracted
asthma in similar circumstances. Settlements, in and out of court, of
between #5000 and #50,000 have been made in similar cases to several
bakery workers who became asthma sufferers south of the Border.
Yet, the National Asthma Campaign claims, companies do not take
occupational asthma seriously. Thousands of people are needlessly
exposed to the risk of asthma at work, it warns in a report published
yesterday.
A survey of 500 small to medium-size companies who took part in a
telephone poll conducted in Glasgow, London, Cardiff, Manchester and
Birmingham, revealed that few took protective action even when they were
aware of the threat of asthma.
The survey found that 59% of the firms did not know what occupational
asthma is. Only 19% had introduced any health and safety measures to
reduce the risk.
Nurses and other hospital staff, agricultural workers, people working
in electronics, printers, those working in chemical and metal
manufacturing, or using paints, plastic or wood, and bakery workers are
most at risk of developing asthma at work, according to the campaigners.
Exposure to irritant substances, which inflame and irritate the
airways and lead to occupational asthma, often goes unreported.
It is imperative, the campaigners say, that employers recognise that
urgent precuations are needed to reduce exposure in the workplace.
''Of those we spoke to who knew what occupational asthma was, a
staggering 91% had introduced no safety measures at all,'' said Liz
Brody. ''Most of the time they just didn't understand what it was.
''They would say things like 'Oh, none of our staff has asthma', or
'We keep the windows open'. The misconceptions, the levels of ignorance,
were truly frightening.''
The TUC, which is a joint sponsor of the campaign, say as many as one
in five adults with asthma suffer directly because of their work. They
claim it is the fastest-growing occupational disease in Britain, leading
to the loss of at least one million work days every year, at a cost to
British industry of an estimated #500m.
The National Asthma Campaign is urging unions and employers to
encourage the reporting of asthma at work, to offer more protection to
workers and, where possible, to eliminate dangerous substances to which
workers are exposed.
The TUC cites cases of severe occupational asthma sufferers,
including:
* A 39-year-old worker for a refrigeration firm, now in a wheelchair
because of asthma caused by handling tobacco and food dust and ammonia
used in cooling systems.
* A 41-year-old bakery worker who was off work for three years with
asthma caused by exposure to flour, before being laid off in 1994.
* A 42-year-old radiographer who lost the use of nearly half of his
lung capacity through exposure to fumes from a leaking x-ray plate
processor. He has now lost his job.
Professor Anthony Newman Taylor, medical advisor to the National
Asthma Campaign, said: ''Exposure is the most important component in
occupational asthma. I hope that people will now think of this as an
occupational health problem rather than a personal susceptibility
problem.''

THE teenage hell of waiting for the phone call that does not come
provides an immediate shock of recognition for Pete Johnson's
enthusiastic band of young readers. Nothing else matters. Even life and
death is on the periphery. The phone call to tell 18-year-old Ben his
mum has just had a baby is not the one he's waiting for and he struggles
to absorb the news.
Pete Johnson writes for the readership most authors avoid: 14 and
15-year-olds. It is a fascinating, age, he says, when people are moving
away from their families and forging their own identities. He's long
wanted to write what he unashamedly calls the love story, but in a way
that would appeal to teenage lads.
''It is assumed that only girls will read love stories, but boys are
just as interested in relationships. Cynicism is often a prop.''
It was as a teacher of English that he developed his understanding of
the teenage condition. He admits to drawing on his experiences there, to
the extent of jotting down conversations, for his first book for
teenagers, Secrets from the School Underground. He learned the value of
humour there too: ''It was the best way of dealing with 4D on a Friday
afternoon.'' His secret is that his books are not for any sort of
literary elite but for the majority of young people with their feet
firmly on the ground.
As soon as his first novel was accepted by a publisher, he gave up
teaching to write the next. Johnson kept himself afloat with freelance
film reviewing and a bit of local journalism.
''Young people tell me that they find some bookshops off-putting, that
they do not know where to look for an author and they are afraid of
mispronouncing names.
''I would expect my books to appeal equally to boys and girls, but
obviously some types appeal more to one than to another. One of the
problems for boys is that they are not offered enough emotion.''
He is happy to spend time signing copies of his books and chatting
with young readers -- and he has a ''panel'' of young correspondents who
are the first to pass judgment on his books -- and a waiting list of
fans who would like to be readers. He replies to every letter he
receives because as a child he wrote a fan letter to Dodie Smith, author
of his favourite book, 101 Dalmatians, and received a reply which
provoked a correspondence which continued until she died. She wrote a
foreword to his first book.
His books very quickly became popular in Germany and on visits there
he found a book culture that was far more teenager-friendly than ours.
''In Germany there is nothing un-cool about going to the library on a
Saturday night -- and the young people get all dressed up as if they
were going to paint the town red. It was quite a revelation,'' he said.
It was appropriate then that a recent visit to Scotland included a
session with school pupils in the Johnstone Teenage Library, definitely
the cool place to hang out in that town. Membership is restricted to
people between the ages of 12 and 25 and there are now 1200 members,
with males outnumbering females by 60% to 40%.
Set up 10 years ago in response to a survey carried out by Renfrew
District Council into young people's views of libraries and winner of a
Library Association medal for innovation, it is the antithesis of the
hushed rows of polished bookshelves. In this library, music plays all
day long and the borrowers tend to prefer computer games and CDs to
books -- all free to people under 21, who only have to prove their
identity to become members.
Librarian Christine Storie spends a modest amount on books, because
they are almost all paperbacks, but the annual book borrowing figure has
increased by #3000 since 1986. ''We have a large graphic novel
collection which is very popular as are space fantasy and star wars
books along with  horror and pop,'' she said.
There is a set of encyclopedias but it is only consulted to help cheat
in a computer game or to discover something about entertainment: ''This
is very much a leisure library, people come in groups of two or three or
even more and meet their pals here. There is a users' committee of young
people and staff and they are responsible for running the megadrive
computer, the tuck shop and fundraising. Last year, for example they
raised #60 for Oxfam's Rwanda appeal,'' she added.
There, they were keen to listen to Johnson and, to the surprise of the
minder from his publisher, to spend money on his books.

A TEENAGER intends to sue prison authorities for making him share his
cell with two prisoners who tried to kill themselves.
Michael Heenan, 18, claims he still suffers from nightmares after two
other young men tried to hang themselves on successive days.
He told yesterday how he woke up to find a cellmate hanging from a
bedsheet in Polmont Young Offenders' Institution.
He said: ''When we went to bed, my cellmate Martin was lying crying. I
asked him if he was all right. He said yes. I went off to sleep.
''I woke up in the middle of the night. I saw Martin was hanging above
me. He just had his underpants on. His bedsheet was wrapped around his
neck and tied to the strip lighting on the ceiling.''
Mr Heenan, of Denny, Stirlingshire, added: ''His face was blue and he
was choking. I grabbed my lighter and set fire to the sheet. The sheet
broke and Martin fell to the ground. I rang the buzzer for help. Prison
officers came and took him away.''
Mr Heenan claims the incident happened on April 9 in cell 328 of
Polmont's A Wing, where he was serving a 90-day sentence for motoring
offences.
He added: ''Martin, who is 19 and from Airdrie, was doing eight
months. He told me it was his second time in Polmont and that, during
his first sentence, he had been kept in Carrick Wing, where potential
suicides are under 24-hour supervision.
''The governor came to thank me for saving Martin's life, but officers
told me that, if Martin had died, I would have been released that very
day because of the trauma.''
Mr Heenan said he got a new cellmate the following day.
''I never got to know his name. He was very, very quiet. When I came
back to my cell from recreation, I saw my new roommate being rushed to
the surgery unit. Officers told me that he, too, had tried to hang
himself.''
Mr Heenan was released after 45 days, having earned full remission for
good behaviour.
He claimed: ''I've been a mess ever since the hangings. I can't face
going to sleep, now. And, when I do drop off, I keep having nightmares.
I keep seeing that boy Martin hanging up above me.
''I am now going to sue the prison authorities for the needless trauma
I've suffered. They must have known Martin was a high suicide risk and
should have kept him under strict supervision.
''I don't know about the other boy. I didn't even have time to get to
know him.''
A Scottish Prisons Service spokesman said last night: 'We can confirm
that Michael Heenan was in a cell where there was an incident involving
another prisoner, but we cannot comment on any legal action.''

ARGYLL and Islands Enterprise director Robin Crawford has denied any
impropriety in the bid to build an airport on Arran that could boost
income at hotels, including his own.
Mr Crawford is joint owner of the Kinloch Hotel in Blackwaterfoot, and
also chairman of the Shiskine Valley Trust.
The trust is seeking planning permission for an airstrip close to his
hotel, and has already received more than #3000 from the local
enterprise company towards its bid.
Mr Crawford dismissed questions about his connections with AIE, the
trust, and hotel with the words: ''We are as pure as the driven snow.''
Meanwhile, the enterprise agency appeared to have distanced itself
from the controversial plan for the grass airstrip at Drumadoon.
An AIE spokesman stressed money for construction would be made
available to the trust, only if it proved an airstrip would be of social
and economic benefit to islanders.
The Drumadoon site was rejected in 1989 by aviation consultants
commissioned by the then Highlands and Islands Development Board to
carry out a feasibility study.
Instead, Donald Butler Associates Ltd recommended the airstrip be
built on land at Balmichael, which is owned by farmer Colin Currie and
his wife Isabel, who are questioning why the Drumadoon location is still
being pursued.
Mr Butler turned down Drumadoon for reasons including its immediate
proximity to a rock outcrop and the wind turbulence on its coastal
cliffs.
He also warned that soft, wet ground conditions might even prevent
aircraft reaching take-off speed, and that landing performance could
also be seriously reduced.
In his report, Mr Butler recommended all airstrips in the Highlands
and Islands should be paved, to provide all-weather reliability and
maximum crosswind capability.
The Shiskine Valley Trust was founded within months of the Butler
findings, which noted a paved airstrip would cost about #1m.
It has lodged a planning application with Cunninghame District Council
for a grass airstrip at Drumadoon, priced at around #160,000.
The trust, set up to identify projects of benefit to the area -- and
to apply for grants that would not normally go to a commercial developer
-- has received at least #3100 towards its airstrip proposal from AIE.
Since then, the local enterprise company has hired a consultant to
estimate how much it would cost to finance an environmental assessment
requested from the trust by Cunninghame District Council.
In her formal objection to the planning application, Mrs Currie has
alleged irresponsible behaviour on the part of the trust by proceeding
with Drumadoon when Balmichael was the consultants' recommended site.
She also claimed the airstrip was not for the benefit of the public, and
should not have been applied for using public money.
Mrs Currie, who supports the Balmichael recommendation, told The
Herald: ''I believe a grass airstrip would offer little for the
community because it is likely to be closed for months during bad
weather.
''I cannot understand why the consultants' report has been ignored,
even on financial grounds, because it contained real concerns about the
clifftop location. However, I do believe a Drumadoon airstrip would
benefit hoteliers by attracting high-value visitors -- such as golfers
or business executives -- who would fly rather than take ferries.''
Mr Crawford confirmed he would promote his hotel more if Drumadoon
went ahead, but argued the runway would also bring public benefits,
ranging from air ambulances to faster mail and newspaper deliveries.
Of his links with AIE, the trust, and the hotel, he said: ''I am not
embarrassed . . . we are as pure as the driven snow.''
Mr Butler, standing by his recommendation that the airstrip be paved,
was adamant that money should not be ''wasted at Drumadoon, but spent at
Balmichael''.
An AIE spokesman stressed the Drumadoon initiative was a community-led
one, and the agency had responded to the trust's approach. It thought a
small investment, to ascertain whether the project could go forward, was
worthwhile.
While stressing that community uses could include air ambulances, and
the airstrip would provide another transport link to the island, he
added: ''Even if the planning application was approved, we have no
commitment to financing the airstrip. Any assistance we give would have
to be justified by economic and social benefits.''

WORKERS at Scottish Nuclear, backed by management at the state-owned
power company, will today take their fight against Government plans for
a pre-privatisation merger with its larger English counterpart to
Parliament.
A delegation of 50 staff last night boarded a self-styled ''battle
bus'' at the East Kilbride headquarters, thought to be the most likely
casualty of such a merger.
They are due to arrive in London this morning to lobby MPs at the
House of Commons, before delivering sackfuls of protest letters to 10
Downing Street, just as the Prime Minister leaves for Question Time.
Yesterday, the mood among the delegation was positive, optimistic that
the united stance put up by Scottish Nuclear's staff and management,
combined with the political furore over the possible loss of
independence, would prompt a rethink by the Government.
Mr Duncan Hawthorne, engineering manager at Hunterston power station,
said: ''We think the plan of leaking details was to test the water and,
as The Herald said last week, it (the Governent) found it to be too warm
for its taste. Now, there seems to be the possibility of some movement,
which is encouraging.''
Recent peace overtures by the English-based Nuclear Electric, offering
the retention of a Scottish headquarters in the event of a merger, were
disbelieved by the embarking passengers.
Mr Hawthorne said: ''That's just nonsense. Logic tells you if the
merger goes ahead then there would be no point in a Scottish
headquarters.''
Mr Hawthorne will be accompanied by Mr Bill Doig, the operations
manager of Torness nuclear power station, as representatives of the
Scottish Nuclear management on the delegation.
The cost of the trip was met from a #50,000 fighting fund, donated by
managers at the weekend.
The rest of the delegation has been selected to reflect a
cross-section of the staff at the Peel Park headquarters, together with
union representatives from the Scottish Nuclear Workers' Campaign, a
newly formed group set up to combat the merger and sell-off.
Unison shop steward, Mr Stephen Hinde, said: ''We want this company to
survive, and we need to retain our distinct Scottish identity.''

AN 11th-hour plan has been submitted as an alternative to setting up a
Gallery of Scottish Art in Glasgow.
The proposal would mean that works of art from the National Galleries
of Scotland would be lent to art centres across the country.
The plan has been sent to the Scottish Office just weeks before the
National Galleries trustees are set to finalise their proposal to
concentrate in Glasgow.
The alternative scheme has been drawn up by a number of distinguished
art world figures as well as the Duke of Sutherland, many of whose
paintings are on loan to the galleries, and the Duke of Buccleuch, who
owns one of the most significant art collections in the world.
In a letter to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and the trustees of the
National Galleries, it is suggested that works of art, including some
800 pictures currently in store, be lent for a minimum of two years to
galleries around Scotland rather than being centred in Glasgow.
The proposal, which is entitled a National Galleries Loan Scheme for
Scotland, suggests lending groups of around 12 paintings to local
authority galleries in Aberdeen, Dundee, Kirkcaldy, Inverness,
Kilmarnock, Perth, Stirling and Glasgow.
The letter acknowledges that smaller galleries may not pull large
crowds but it adds: ''Visitor numbers should not be the only deciding
factor. Otherwise, the large areas of Scotland outwith the central belt
would necessarily be disadvantaged.''
The move comes in response to a request in February by Mr Angus
Grossart, chairman of the trustees of the National Galleries, for
comments on the trustees' options for a new gallery of Scottish art. The
trustees are set to submit their choice -- predicted as being a Musee
d'Orsay-style gallery displaying 19th and 20th century Scottish and
European paintings -- to Mr Lang and the National Heritage Memorial
Fund, which will shoulder the #30m capital costs.
Last night, Mr Grossart was keen to dispel any notion of a clash of
views.
He said: ''The proposal in many ways encompasses the ideas we have
already addressed such as getting more pictures out of storage.
''It is complimentary to our general policy but not a substitute to
something major in Glasgow.''
He added that that a final version of the trustees' proposals would be
submitted to the Scottish Secretary in a matter of weeks.
One of the key movers behind the plan, Dr Colin Thompson, said the
idea had been tried in the 1970s but had floundered because of lack of
funding.
He said the public were keen to see modern works of art in their local
galleries, adding they should be on long-term loan to allow people to
view them several times. Professor Martin Kemp, a former National
Galleries trustee, added that in his view the loan scheme should be
considered instead of a gallery of 19th and 20th century paintings.
The proposal is expected to prove controversial with those keen on
seeing National Galleries resources focused in Glasgow. However, the
city's director of museums and galleries, Mr Julian Spalding, was not
available for comment.

<HEADLINE>Brent Spar protesters ready for a long stay</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978600167</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DETECTIVES were yesterday playing a waiting game with the Greenpeace
activists who have occupied a redundant North Sea installation.
A seven-man team from Grampian police flew out to Shell's Brent Field
after the protesters clambered aboard the disused Brent Spar tanker
terminal.
Police confirmed they had held emergency talks with Shell senior
management at which ''all options of ending the sit-in'' were discussed.
A Greenpeace spokeswoman said the protesters had taken enough supplies
for a lengthy occupation, perhaps until autumn.
But the police spokesman denied there were any plans to call in SAS
troops to remove the 12 protesters.
He added that the police team would return onshore and consult with
force command and the procurator-fiscal before deciding what action
would be taken.
''Brent Spar is disused so there is no pressure to get them taken
off,'' he said.
A Shell spokesman said police officers had been liaising with them
since their emergency response team was called into company headquarters
on Sunday.
Greenpeace's Sue Cooper said the 12 who had boarded the floating
terminal had blocked off the helideck.
''I gather the weather is very bad so it is unlikely anyone will try
to get on board from the sea,'' she said.
She claimed the activists would refuse to get drawn into a violent
confrontation if Brent Spar was stormed by the SAS.
''We are a non-violent organisation, we are not threatening anyone
with violence and we will not resist with violence because that is
strictly against our code.''
The organisation claimed the action was necessary because Shell had
been given permission to dump Brent Spar in the sea.
That, they said, would cause serious environmental damage. because
there was so much toxic waste on board.
''Our intention is to remain on Brent Spar until the Government
revokes its permission to dump the structure or the weather becomes so
bad that they cannot do it,'' she said.
Shell accused Greenpeace of sensationalising the impact of dumping the
installation at sea.
''Extensive studies over several years have confirmed that disposal of
the Brent Spar at a deep-water site would have negligible environmental
impact,'' said a spokesman.
He said Brent Spar contained 100 tonnes of residual sludge, 30 tonnes
of low specific activity scale, and small amounts of heavy metals.
Most of the metals, he said, would be removed before dumping, and the
remaining material would not have a detrimental effect on the marine
environment.
He said it was planned to dump the structure 150 miles offshore in the
Atlantic.

THE leader of Scotland's Roman Catholics, Cardinal Thomas Winning,
yesterday shook hands with Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, then described
him as someone he could do business with.
However, he denied yesterday's private meeting at Bute House, the
official residence of the Scottish Secretary in Edinburgh, was of any
major significance.
It was held against a background of speculation that the church is
edging closer to the Tories after a row with Labour over abortion.
The appearance by Health Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie at the
two-and-a-half hour lunch meeting fuelled speculation that abortion had
been discussed.
Initially Cardinal Winning, who represents the country's 800,000
Catholics, said the meeting between them had been social and both sides
had agreed not to discuss details of it.
However, when asked if Mr Lang was someone he could do business with,
Cardinal Winning said: ''Oh yes, he's a nice fellow. I've met him
before.''
Questioned whether either side had learned anything from the meeting,
he said: ''Did I learn anything? You have got to cement relationships
before you start discussing things seriously.
''I would be dishonouring what I agreed to if we discussed things
because there was nothing sensational, nothing earth-moving, nothing
political in what we talked about.''
When asked if abortion had been on the agenda, Cardinal Winning said:
''Oh no, we're not a one-issue people.''
He said stories claiming the church was edging closer to the Tory
party were ''absolute rubbish, speculation, and imagination and
exploitation''.
When questions were raised about the church's alleged traditional
support for the Labour Party the church's press spokesman, Fr Noel
Barry, who was with Cardinal Winning, stepped in to say: ''The church
has never supported any political party, nor will we ever do so.''
Mr Lang refused to comment on the meeting. However, when The Herald
talked to him beforehand he said the meeting was a private one.
Meanwhile a Tory party source said it was difficult to gauge how
important yesterday's meeting was. ''It was good for both sides to meet,
especially in the light of the so-called traditional support of the
Catholic Church for the Labour Party.''
A Labour Party insider said the Tories would like to read more into
the meeting than there was.

THE Scottish Conservative conference in Glasgow next week is set to
become a virtual election rally for the Perth and Kinross contest, with
eight Cabinet Ministers in attendance and the first debate being
launched by candidate John Godfrey.
The publication of the conference agenda yesterday gave not the
slightest hint of any change of policy or direction.
Coming in the wake of poor local election results, calls from
backbench MPs for a new tack, and crisis meetings with activists at the
weekend, the agenda indicated the intention to continue along present
lines.
''Of course we had a very disappointing outcome on April 6,'' said
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, ''but there are two years to go in this
Parliament, time to learn lessons and fight back. Just before the last
General Election we faced serious set-backs and we fought back to win,
doing so in the teeth of the recession.''
The president of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association,
Mr David McLetchie, insisted that he ''would not be handing out gags at
the door of the Royal Concert Hall.''
He added: ''This will be an open conference. Contributions are welcome
from all quarters and all shades of opinion within the party.
''No-one will be gagged or disbarred from taking part in our
proceedings. Any suggestion to the contrary is arrant nonsense.''
Mr McLetchie said the conference was an opportunity for party members
to pick themselves up and start out again on the long road to the next
General Election.
''The leadership of the Conservative Party in Scotland is neither
complacent, arrogant, deaf or blind,'' he said. ''We expect and welcome
constructive criticism.''
However, there is little obvious sign of dissent from the official
line in the agenda, with none of the motions being called showing much
indication of the malaise affecting the party.
One dissident Conservative voice is that of Bailie John Young of
Glasgow, whose motion -- which is not being called -- states: ''This
conference accepts that the Scottish Conservative Party, no longer
perceived as being a 'Scottish ' Party, is now facing its most serious
crisis for almost a century and calls for a special conference to be
arranged later this year to address the problem.''
Another criticial motion, also uncalled, from Glasgow Maryhill, asks
the Government to recognise the ever-increasing gap between rich and
poor and avoid any further switch to indirect taxation. In general,
however, the tone is far from critical.
On the constitution, for example, there were 30 motions submitted,
almost universally hostile to change. A Royal Commission to examine the
Lords was suggested by Ayr constituency party, while Moray and West
Banff urges ''further innovative ways of devolving power to the
individual.''
The motion from Gordon which will be debated is typical, affirming
support for the Union and opposing plans for a Scottish parliament as
damaging prosperity and fragmenting the UK.
The first motion debated will come from Perth and Kinross by-election
candidate John Godfrey. It states: ''This conference notes the sustained
recovery from recession, evidenced by strong, export-led,
non-inflationary economic growth and falling unemployment, and confirms
the Conservative Party's commitment to low taxation and sound public
finances.''
The reply will come from Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke,
and it will be of interest to note whether any of the party's critics of
tax increases, particularly VAT on fuel, manage to speak in the debate.
The Scottish Labour Party immediately attacked the Conservatives for
not including a debate on local government on the conference agenda and
accused them of attempting to ''cover up'' their worst- ever performance
in a Scottish election.
Shadow Scottish Secretary Mr George Robertson said:''The Tories tried
gerrymandering boundaries before the election, it was followed by
humiliation, and now it's followed by cover-up and silence.
''No wonder the Tory Party in Scotlaand is tearing itself apart and
rightly condemning its leaders for leading them into this swampland.''
* Mr Lang was asked yesterday about the gaffe by Croydon South MP
Richard Ottaway that ''the most prosperous region of England is
Scotland.''
He agreed with Mr McLetchie that the response in Scotland to what was
a slip of the tongue perhaps had been over sensistive, and Mr Ottaway's
point remained that Scotland's economy was improving.
However, Mr Lang added: ''Like everybody else, I wish he had got his
geography right.''

COLONEL Archie Fletcher of Dunans, OBE, Lord Lieutenant for Argyll and
Bute, who died a few days ago at the age of 70, led the fight to
regenerate the Cowal peninsula after the departure of the US Navy from
the Holy Loch.
Colonel Fletcher had only recently announced his retirement from the
post of vice-chairman of Argyll and the Islands Enterprise.
As chairman of the Cowal Initiative, he fought to bring new businesses
into Dunoon and steered vital funds to existing firms hit by the closure
of the naval base three years ago.
Mr Norman Walker, chairman of AIE, paid tribute to the work of Colonel
Fletcher, saying: ''He did a magnificent job for the people of Cowal.''
A former Scots Guardsman, serving in Europe during the Second World
War and then in Palestine, Malaya and Borneo, where he commanded the 1st
Batallion.
Last year, Colonel Fletcher took over the role of Chieftain of the
Cowal Highland Gathering, which was celebrating its 100th anniversary.

Alison Daniels reports how Glasgow City Council faces determined
opposition in its bid to change the terms of Sir William Burrell's will
COLIN DONALD practised law in Glasgow for 35 years. Never in that time
does he recall having to use his legal skills to alter a will; to set
aside the wishes of the dead in the interests of the living. Such cases
are relatively rare and usually occur, he says, when the terms of a will
prove unworkable.
But now, as the senior trustee of the Burrell Collection, the retired
solicitor finds himself embroiled in just such a contest. He believes an
imminent battle looms over the stringent terms stipulated in Sir William
Burrell's deed of covenant when he gifted his collection to the city
more than half a century ago.
For reasons that can only be speculated over, the collector was
adamant that his internationally acclaimed assortment of sculptures and
paintings, including works by Manet, Cezanne, and Rembrandt, could only
be exhibited in Britain and not overseas.
For a number of years the city has been equally adamant that the
collector's wishes should be altered so that items from the Burrell
Collection can join the pool of art works that are shipped from one
international venue to another.
Two months ago it emerged that Glasgow City Council and its director
of museums and art galleries, Julian Spalding, intend to promote a
private Bill through Parliament which would, in effect, allow the
council to change the terms of Sir William's 1944 will and a later 1957
codicil. Such drastic action remains the city's only option after any
move to take the issue to the Court of Session was deemed unlikely.
The matter will be decided by six parliamentary commissioners -- a mix
of peers and MPs -- at a public hearing in Glasgow. With the
parliamentary summer recess drawing closer, Donald says the trustees
assume a date will be set in the next fortnight. Intending to lodge a
petition of objection, they are in the process of assembling a team of
expert witnesses.
Plucking a well-thumbed history of Sir William Burrell from his
battered briefcase, Donald taps the cover and reiterates, like a litany,
the detailed instructions laid down by the collector. Sir William, he
says, was a careful man bordering on the pedantic. His instructions were
well reasoned and his wish to keep items from the collection in Britain
must be regarded as sacrosanct.
''There is evidence from 1953, when the city lent a couple of items to
Switzerland, that there was an explosion. He was appalled and was quite
clear that he did not want items lent overseas.'' Arguments that air
travel makes the transportation of works of art a less risky business
than in Sir William's day do not cut any ice. ''The point is not one
that can be compromised. We have no room for manoeuvre.''
Is there an element of sheer bloody-mindedness on the part of the
trustees? Spalding has argued that international lending would enhance
the collection and consequently benefit the people of Glasgow.
Although a self-confessed art amateur, save for his involvement with
the Burrell, Donald, a Glaswegian with a long family connection to the
West, very politely sneers at the concept of enhancement with its
connotations that the collection needs improving in the name of the
citizens of Glasgow.
''The Burrell Collection is one man's idea put together over a
lifetime. It's not haphazard in the way that the Kelvingrove collection
is. The whole point is that it's a collection that has to be kept
together. One may say it is a fine conceit, but we are not here to pass
judgment but to carry on the spirit.''
The collection, of course, has not remained untouched since Sir
William's death. The trustees have added various artefacts, a task
Donald appears to have embraced with some relish. However, he makes a
sharp distinction between the concept of swapping items with overseas
galleries and buying additional pieces of art. ''He laid down guidelines
as to what he wanted bought. He liked things with a gothic flavour. He
was not, for instance, keen on modernists like the Impressionists. We
have adhered to that.''
Donald became a trustee shortly before the Burrell Collection opened
more than a decade ago. He was the lawyer for, and personal friend of,
Sir William's nephews. On reaching old age they invited him to become a
trustee. He says it was a tremendous honour.
Previously guarded in commenting publicly on the city's stance, Donald
is keen to emphasise he and the trustees do not want to fall out with
Spalding. The trustees, he adds, are also concerned about the
implications for future bequests if the commission find in favour of the
city. Sweeping a hand through unruly hair, he smiles amiably but is
clear there is a battle to be fought.
If Sir William Burrell's stipulations appear rooted in self-importance
Donald admits he interprets the council's determination to seek a
parliamentary solution as equally motivated by the grandiose idea of
participating in the international arena.

UNION leaders and Post Office management both claimed victory after
the one-day strike which affected postal services in Scotland yesterday.
Union officials said the industrial action, which involved around
14,000 staff, had been ''massively successful''.
Mr George Robertson, Communication Workers' Union officer for
Scotland, said delivery, sorting, and distribution offices were shut
down.
He added managers had only been able to staff post offices by flying
in workers from England, although a union spokesman said larger numbers
of people had turned up for work in many rural areas.
A Post Office spokeswoman confirmed that about 50 managers from London
and Northern Ireland were brought in to work behind Scottish counters.
She added: ''The result has been a resounding success, opposed to an
unnecessary and pointless strike call.''
The Royal Mail said only six of its 60 main offices were closed and
all 2000 sub-post offices remained open. A spokeswoman said yesterday:
''Some 10% of delivery staff are in and 15% of parcel staff. We have
postal deliveries in Grampian and the Borders and parcel deliveries in
Grampian.''
Postal workers went on strike because they were angry at management's
decision to make May Day a normal working day. Management north of the
Border agreed to follow the lead of their counterparts in England,
Wales, and Northern Ireland where the Government decided the first May
bank holiday should be on VE-Day, May 8.
In Scotland, the Government had bowed to tradition and said VE-Day
should mean an optional holiday in addition to May 1.
Labour MP, Mr George Foulkes, raised the matter of ''bank holiday
confusion'' in the House of Commons yesterday. He raised a point of
order with the Speaker, asking which Minister was responsible for
designating the different bank holidays.
The Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley MP blamed ''Government
dithering'' for failing to clear up the issue.

THE Government, in its cost-cutting frenzy to find cash for tax cuts,
is even pursuing citizens beyond the grave or, at any rate, up to the
graveside. I quote Her Majesty's Opposition, who yesterday attacked
cutbacks in state help with the cost of funerals.
Poor people in Doncaster will have difficulty getting buried at all
according to Mr Kevin Hughes (Doncaster North -- Lab.), who suggested
that funeral directors in these parts charge more than #1000 for their
services while Ministers are pondering fixing a top limit of #875.
Labour's Front Bench, a solid trio of men, Mr Donald Dewar, Mr Adam
Ingram and Mr Keith Bradley, were moved to incredulous mirth as Mr Peter
Lilley, Social Security Secretary, denounced ''lead swinging and
fraud,'' for the cost of claims trebling over the last six years.
Was not the real reason the growth in poverty, demanded Mr Dewar. The
Department of Social Security and the Home Office are probably the
departments which give their Ministers the most frequent glimpses of
human depravity. Only the Whips' offices probably see more.
Mr Lilley disclosed that in some families the task of organising the
funeral is delegated to whichever relative happens to be on Income
Support. Thus, the taxpayer pays. Insisting that only the closest
relative or friend with a genuine connection with the deceased can now
make a claim has resulted in the growth in claims stopping ''almost
overnight'', Mr Lilley revealed.
The Sketch reflected that when in government Labour's DSS Ministers
could have just as hard a time as Lilley &amp; Co. Mr Jeremy Corbyn
(Islington North -- Lab.), who wears something of the air of a South
American left-wing guerrilla, demanded a national minimum wage of #4.10
an hour, oblivious to the policy implications of the seminal event at
Methodist Central Hall just two days before.
Mr Dewar and his associates chuckled among themselves while the
Minister warned Mr Corbyn not to encourage unemployment, in a manner of
which young Master Blair would probably have approved.
Mr John Marshall (Hendon South -- Con.) had just neatly suggested that
the minimum wage was another policy which might be revealed to the
Labour Party somewhere on the road to Sedgefield as not quite the thing
for winning elections.
Ministers produced figures suggesting that, even if it might be a bit
of a struggle getting buried, pensioners were having a marvellous time
before they got that far.
Whereas in the last year of Labour government -- some four years
before Mr Blair became an MP -- only 32% of pensioners ''had access,''
as the Minister rather quaintly put it, to a freezer now 75% had. TVs,
telephones, fridges, you name it pensioners now have them, and if only
49% have ''access to'' a car that could be because many of the 51% are
too sensible to fancy driving on today's roads.
Mr Julien Brazier (Canterbury -- Con.) got so ecstatic about this that
he lost his sense of direction. Didn't the figures show, he enthused,
how wealth had ''trickled up''. Labour, who felt that successive Tory
Chancellors have been rather good at trickling wealth upwards, gave him
an ironic cheer.
Mr Dennis Skinner (Bolsover -- Lab.), to whom being miserable seems a
condition of existence, was in his element. He hardly seemed to know
whether to be crosser about the Government's treatment of the disabled
-- ''kicking their crutches away'' -- or at a red carpet being laid in
Westminster Hall to greet the Queen on Friday.
Lieutenant David Hunt, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Officer
on the Bridge, right-hand man to Captain Major -- seeking to lift the
spirits of the crew already cringeing in anticipation of Thursday's
local election results -- found a tonic no-one else had thought of.
''Privatisation and the Citizen's Charter is the tip of a formidable
iceberg'', he declared. ''The Labour Party are heading for that
iceberg.''
At least if the SS New Labour goes down with all hands, the DSS won't
have to chip in for any funeral. As for Lieutenant Hunt, one couldn't
make out through the North Atlantic mists the name of his own vessel.
But the first letter appeared to be T.

MORE than 20 lives could be saved every year by a new unit for stroke
victims at Glasgow's Southern General Hospital, the doctor in charge
said yesterday.
About 400 victims are brought in every year from the Southern's
catchment area, and the death rate recorded last year in the Scottish
Office's table of Clinical Outcome Indicators, 18.28%, was already among
the lowest in Scotland.
Now, says Profesor Ian Bone, consultant neurologist in charge of the
unit, the aim is to reduce deaths by 30% by intensive diagnostic
assessment and rehabilitation during the first 72 hours after the
stroke.

FOURTEEN single mothers who took part in a training initiative for
unemployed women will today receive awards which may help change their
lifestyles and that of their dependants.
The Paisley ceremony is seen as a milestone for the women, from
Carnwadric in Glasgow, and Paisley, who as single mothers are among a
group which has come in for much criticism from Cabinet Ministers in
recent years for being ''a major burden on society''.
The achievements of the mothers, who have just completed a Scottish
Vocational Qualification (SVQ) in Social Care, should go some way to
appeasing the Government. Almost all of them have secured employment in
the care sector while others plan to go on to further education.
The course was made possible by a partnership involving the single
parent group One Plus, Strathclyde region's social work department,
Renfrewshire Enterprise, and Community Enterprise in Strathclyde.
The single mothers took part in a 10-week course to build their
confidence. Thereafter, they spent seven months working in the care
sector.
The trainees were given a child care allowance, travelling expenses,
and an allowance of #15 a week which meant they still qualified for
state benefit.
One of the trainees, Ms Mary Heron, 28, from Hunterhill, Paisley,
begins training this month to support carers of people with Alzheimers'
Disease.
Ms Heron said yesterday: ''Many single mums are keen to get back to
work and college but simply can't do so because they can't afford child
care.
''I think the efforts of our group will demonstrate to Cabinet
Ministers that not all of us want to be dependent on the State for a
living.''

A LABOUR Government would be the ''consumers' champion'', Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown said yesterday, as he unveiled his plans to
transform the economy.
Spurning the ''failed dogmas'' of the old left, he set out the latest
stage of Labour's modernisation agenda in a speech at Westminster.
Labour's plans would turn Britain from a ''sluggish into a dynamic
economy'', he pledged.
''The Tories have become the party of vested interests at the expense
of competition, the consumer and economic dynamism.
''Today, it is Labour which is the true party of consumers, rooting
out restrictive practices and standing as the consumers' champion,'' he
said.
His plans included consumer league tables so the public could compare
charges for mortgages, personal pensions, insurance and bank overdrafts.
Mr Brown warned that prices charged for water, gas, electricity,
telephones and food were higher than they should be because of the
Tories' unwillingness to take on vested interests.
Labour would reform the privatised utilities and push for more
competition in airlines and for reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy.
It also would set up public hearings on prices, service standards and
profits before new prices are set by the privatised utilities.
A Competition and Consumer Standards Office would replace the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the Office of Fair Trading --
combining the investigative functions of the two existing quangos.
The new body would root out restrictive practices such as price fixing
and rigged tenders and anti-competitive practices such as abuses of
monopoly power.
It also would have powers to impose financial penalties, tempered by
an appeals process for companies who felt they had been harshly treated.
New legislation for the financial services industry would protect
mortgage buyers and a new statutory banking ombudsman would represent
customers' interests.
Other plans included incentives to encourage long-term investment,
measures to increase transparency in corporate governance, an initiative
to increase small and medium-sized business investment, and regional
development agencies.
Mr Brown said consumer league tables -- showing which company was
charging the most and the least for the same service and which was
performing best or worst -- would act as a spur to competition.
Labour would ensure the utilities gave a better service to small
businesses and the self-employed and they would also benefit from
reforms to competition policy.
''By insisting on these reforms, Labour is indeed the party of small
business and the self-employed in Britain today,'' Mr Brown said.

THE Scottish Labour Party is to mount an ''all-out assault'' to
increase party membership in the wake of last month's council election
success and has set itself a target of doubling the number of members
from the present 25,000 before the next General Election (Keith Sinclair
writes).
Using a news conference in Glasgow to contrast the party's buoyant
mood with the Conservatives' problems in the run-up to the Scottish
Tories' annual conference next week, officials said there would be no
''no-go areas'' during the campaign.
New recruits would be sought throughout the country and in areas
previously regarded as the territory of other political parties, they
pledged.
Shadow Scottish Secretary Mr George Robertson said: ''Perhaps in the
past we have concentrated in getting the votes without getting the
members. Now we are going to convert our electoral success into a
membership success that will mirror, if not exceed, what is going on
south of the Border.
''New ideas and new policies will be there and this year will be
marked by major policy developments in education, housing, and local
government as well as more flesh on the devolution structures.''
Scottish party membership currently stands at 25,406 and is at its
highest level for more than a generation, according to Mr Jack
McConnell, general secretary, who said about 4000 people had been
recruited since Mr Blair became leader last summer.

SCOTLAND'S newest radio station, Scot FM, yesterday celebrated a big
rise in listening figures in central Scotland and claimed to have more
listeners than Forth FM.
However, an official of Scottish Radio Holdings, which owns Radio
Forth and Radio Clyde, said its boasts of success in the ratings war
with Forth FM and its sister station Max AM were misleading.
New figures show Scot FM's audience jumped by around 77% in the past
three months. Their weekly audience is now around 349,000, up from
around 234,000.
Much of their success has been put down to controversial DJ Scottie
McClue.
Scot FM chairman Sir David Steel said: ''These are wonderful figures
and are testament to all the hard work and dedication shown by the team
at Scot FM against fierce competition.''
Mr Jimmy Gordon, of SRH, said it was misleading for Scot FM to say it
had more listeners than Forth FM and Max AM.
Mr Gordon said: ''Scot FM have taken their figures from across the
whole of central Scotland where there is a catchment area of nearly
3,000,000 people and compared it with Radio Forth's audience in a
catchment area of just over 1,000,000 people.
''I would be congratulating them today if they had not put out such a
misleading statement trying to say they had taken over from Forth.
''The figures for Scot FM are an improvement on a very poor start but
still very far below Forth and Clyde and will remain so.''
Scot FM programme controller Jason Bryant accepted the criteria
outlined by Mr Gordon was the one used for the figures but said ''facts
are facts''.
Mr Bryant said: ''These are official figures and we're delighted by
them. Whatever Jimmy says we are still a bigger station than Forth FM
and Max AM.''
Station boss Tom Hunter said their 12-month target figures set when
the station went on air in September last year had already been beaten.
Since Scot FM hit the airwaves it has been dogged by controversy,
embarrassing technical hitches and a string of walk-outs. Big names who
have left the station include Kay Adams, Margo MacDonald, Donnie Munro
and Bruce Findlay.
Scot FM's interpetation of the new Rajar figures is that it puts it in
the middle of the radio pack in the central belt.
It accepts it is behind Clyde 1 and 2 and Atlantic, but above Forth
FM, Max AM, Classic FM, Virgin and BBC Radios 2, 3, 4, and 5.
New station Talk UK, which threatened to attract Scot FM listeners,
attracted only 1% of the market in central Scotland, with 27,000 tuning
in since it started in February.
Other figures revealed yesterday show a rise in listeners to BBC Radio
Scotland of 44,000 a week to 972,000, or 8.3% of the available audience.

THE Scottish National Party yesterday called the state of Scotland's
housing a national scandal and put the blame on successive Tory and
Labour governments and councils.
Mr Andrew Welsh, MP, SNP vice-president, said in Edinburgh that
housing in Scotland had suffered in the past 16 years from the
double-edged sword of Tory attacks from above and Labour neglect from
within.
Speaking before a Scottish Grand Committee debate at Westminster
tomorrow on ''Scotland's Housing Crisis'' -- which the SNP has sponsored
-- he said: ''We need a war on poor housing.''
Mr Welsh said that the Scottish House Condition Survey, published
recently, showed that nearly 30% of Scotland's houses were affected by
dampness, condensation, or mould.
Almost half of the houses affected by dampness were in the public
sector. Each year, levels of homelessness broke new records.
Yet the Tories had cut net housing resources by 11.3% in real terms
this year and by almost 20% over the next three years.
Mr Welsh said Labour's housing policy was in as big a mess as much of
its housing stock. Labour was Scotland's biggest landlord and yet was in
the position of having no housing policy.
He said that its housing spokesman, Mr John McAllion, MP, had been
reduced to writing in a personal capacity in Shelter's Scottish Housing
Monitor last month in the absence of a party policy.
Mr Welsh said the SNP's approach to housing started from the basic
premise that every Scottish citizen had a right to decent, secure, and
affordable accommodation.
Mr Tom Chalmers, SNP housing spokesman, said tomorrow's debate would
be used to set out the horrendous housing conditions in Scotland and
also to put forward radical and realistic proposals.
These included:
* Transferring the local authorities' housing capital debt to central
government, which would release more than #1bn to local authorities over
four years.
* Using this sum to let local authorities tackle the Scottish scourge
of dampness, condensation, and mould.
* The creation through new- build and refurbishment of 15,000 new
affordable rented accommodation units a year, for at least four years.
* Reforming the right-to-buy legislation.
* Abolishing Scottish Homes and replacing it with a Scottish ministry
and national housing agency.
Mr McAllion later dismissed Mr Welsh's claim that Labour had no
housing policy as ''rubbish''.

A hugh operation to evict
anti-motorway campaigners from their treetop village went ahead
yesterday -- with protesters and bailiffs accusing each other of
violence.
For more than eight hours the protesters and teams of
specially-trained climbers fought to outwit each other in trees and rope
walkways more than 60ft above the wooded Stanworth Valley, near
Blackburn, Lancashire.
Ten protesters were arrested and two injured. But at the end of the
day bailiffs had cleared only five of the 40 treetop houses blocking the
path of the #80m M65 extension.
The protesters, who have occupied the site for nine months, last week
lost their legal battle in the Court of Appeal challenging the
Department of Transport's right to evict them.
What started as a non-violent protest yesterday ended in
recriminations, with the protesters accusing the authorities of putting
lives at risk.
However, Under-Sheriff of Lancashire Andrew Wilson, who is responsible
for the eviction, and Lancashire police accused the campaigners of
attacking bailiffs as they climbed trees.
Mr Wilson said: ''We have encountered resistance and much more violent
resistance than we were promised, which is disappointing.
''They have been jumping on bailiffs' heads and kicking people. We
have people here who are prepared to put their own lives at risk. I hope
no-one will be seriously hurt and I am doing my best to make sure that
doesn't happen.''
Protesters kept up howls of protest as the operation -- codenamed
''Freeway Two'' -- went ahead to try to clear a path through the steep,
wooded valley.
Teams of specially-trained climbers played a cat-and-mouse game with
protesters as they attempted to dismantle the houses and bring the
occupants down to the ground.
They swung perilously high above the ground on the flimsy walkways as
they pursued protesters from one tree to another.
Police said one woman suffered a bruised and strained arm and a man
had a cut hand.
It is estimated another 60 or more protesters remain in the trees and
the operation to remove them, described as probably the biggest of its
kind, could take several days.
Police said those arrested would be charged with obstructing the
under-sheriff and bailed to appear in court.

MORE women work in Britain than in most other European Union
countries, according to figures disclosed in a Commons written reply
yesterday.
Only Sweden and Denmark have more females in employment as a
percentage of the population.
According to the figures, 64% of women work in Britain, 76% in Sweden
and 74% in Denmark.
However, the rates in Sweden and Denmark include women on maternity
leave being paid by their employers.
Just behind Britain comes Finland (63%), Germany (60%), Portugal
(58%), Austria 56% and France 55%.
Only 33% of Spanish women work. In Ireland the figure is 38%, the same
as Greece.
Employment Minister of State Ann Widdecombe, who gave the figures,
said later: ''They are concrete proof that the UK's flexible labour
market offers working women a better deal than almost any other European
country.''

A DRAFT code aimed at closing the persistent gap between men's and
women's earnings is published today by the Equal Opportunities
Commission (EOC).
Despite the Equal Pay Act, which has been in force since 1970, women
still earn only 79.5% of men's earnings and, on average, receive #100 a
week less than their male counterparts.
Using the Act can be extremely complicated, often leading to lengthy
legal proceedings. One case supported by the EOC against Frenchay Health
Authority has been active for more than 10 years.
Now, under powers vested in it by the Trade Union Reform and
Employment Rights Act of 1993, the EOC has published the code which
includes practical guidance for those involved in pay issues.
It is the first such code to be drawn up in any EU member state and,
pending responses from employers, trades unions, and members of the
legal profession, should go before Parliament by the end of the year.
EOC chairwoman, Mrs Kamlesh Bahl, said yesterday that the pay gap
remained one of the most persistent root causes of discrimination
between the sexes.
She added that it was vital that earnings be regarded as an essential
component of any equal opportunity policy.

<TEXT>
A HEALTH board is to launch an inquiry into the number of rare eye
deformities suffered by children in Fife.
It also emerged last night that the chemical at the centre of an
American test case over the deformities is freely available in Scottish
garden centres.
Parents of six children backing the multi-million pound law suit
called for the fungicide, Benlate, to be banned.
The children were born within a 15-mile radius of Ladybank without
eyes or with only partially developed eyes and their families blame
pesticides used on local farmland.
Fife Health Board confirmed last night that it is to launch an
investigation.
A spokeswoman said: ''In the light of the concerns of the parents and
the action, we will be further investigating the matter.''
An average of 10 babies a year are born in Britain with conditions in
which the eyes have stopped developing in the foetus.
In Scotland, there are understood to be 12 cases, with six in the
Ladybank area.
A Florida grand jury will hear the test case against US chemical firm,
Dupont, later this year.
The Scottish families claim that the pesticides Benlate and
Carbendazim are to blame. Benlate is sold in sachets for use as a garden
fungicide.
Precautions on the packet recommend it should be kept away from skin
and stored in a safe place away from children.
At Dupont's headquarters at Wilmington, Delaware, spokeswoman Miss Pat
Getter confirmed that the company would vigorously defend the legal
action.
She said: ''We maintain that when used to label instructions Benlate
does not cause any adverse health effects.
''While we are certainly sympathetic to any family whose child has a
rare disease, we know that it is not caused by our product.''

THE Government should stop ''mucking about'' with the traditional May
Day Bank Holiday, Labour MP Paul Flynn protested yesterday.
Ministers put it back by a week this year, except in Scotland, to
coincide with the 50th anniversary of VE Day on May 8.
The May Day Bank Holiday, usually on the first Monday in May, was
introduced by the last Labour Government in 1978 to celebrate
International Labour Day.
The Tories have opposed the holiday and the Government last year
promised to look at the possibility of scrapping it.
To Tory cheers, junior Citizen's Charter Minister John Horam said
yesterday:''We don't need to keep the red flag flying on this particular
day.''
Labour's George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) complained
that this year's May Day switch had caused a ''great deal of
confusion''.
He asked which Government department was responsible for this ''total
chaos''.

A CHILD will celebrate his third birthday today by preparing for
surgery.
It will be the fourth major operation for Greig Myles, but surgeons
hope it will be the last, and the start of a normal life.
He had been born with a series of problems, including a hole in the
heart. His parents admit he has survived only through the pioneering
techniques and skills of the surgeons and doctors at the Royal Hospital
for Sick Children at Yorkhill, Glasgow.
On the surface, he appears like any normal, healthy, boisterous
three-year-old boy.
But since he was born seven weeks prematurely at Falkirk Infirmary, he
has been plagued with problems. Weighing just 4lbs, he had to be
transferred to hospital in Stirling when he was less than 24 hours old
for special care facilities.
A heart murmur was detected and he was taken to Yorkhill for what his
parents were told would be a routine scan.
What was discovered was a hole in his heart, a pumping disorder in one
of the heart's chambers, and serious narrowing of the arteries.
''We really thought it was the end of the world,'' said his mother,
Sharon, 29, from Carfe Crescent, Laurieston, Falkirk.
Her marriage to 34-year-old William had been only months old when she
fell pregnant. Doctors decided that Mrs Myles, a diabetic, should have a
Caesarian seven weeks before Greig was due.
The baby recovered well both from his first exploratory operation in a
matter of days, and even after massive open heart surgery to repair the
worst of the damage.
''The doctors were amazed,'' said Mrs Myles. ''I don't think they'd
ever seen such a small chap with such a lot of courage.''
Tomorrow sees what could be the end of a medical marathon for the
youngster. Doctors will carry out a ''stent'' operation on a lung artery
to widen it -- and the prognosis is good.
A leading cardiologist at Yorkhill said yesterday: ''Once this
operation is complete there is no reason why young Greig should not go
on to live a full and normal life.''
Mrs Myles said: ''This is the news we have been praying for. We can't
thank the doctors and the nursing staff enough. They've performed
miracles on wee Greig and given us all hope for the future.''

<TEXT>
THE family evicted from their home in Kirkcaldy for anti-social
behaviour have arrived in a small fishing village, and have found
themselves barred from two of its four pubs.
The Graham family are privately renting a two-bedroomed cottage in
North Street, Rosehearty, on the Moray Firth after leaving relatives in
Aberdeen last week.
The two pubs have said they would bar the Grahams after an alleged
incident at the weekend.
Locals claim Mr Gordon Graham, 39, bared his tattooed chest in a
packed bar during a heavy drinking session.
One regular, who witnessed the incident, said Mr Graham, a
father-of-five, had been talking to a local who asked him how tough he
was and he then said he was the '' 'toughest person in this bar'. He had
his shirt up and I could read a four-letter obscenity written on his
chest.''
The family said they were looking for a fresh start after anti-social
behaviour cost them their council house in Glenrothes, Fife.
One publican who intended to bar the Grahams said: ''I do not want any
trouble here and I am quite within my rights to stop anyone coming into
my bar.
''The Grahams have a reputation for trouble and it is just not worth
my while to let them in.''
Mr Jim Downie, who runs the Mace store in the village's Union Street,
said: ''I do not know why they chose to come here.
''I would not think there is much work for them and the house is
hardly big enough. I understand they have been in trouble already.''
Neighbours said they feared the Grahams may not have learned their
lesson.
One said: ''We are not looking for any trouble here. I did not know
this family were here until today.
''I am not making any judgment on them until I see whether they can
behave, but the weekend incident in the pub has really worried me.''
Mr Graham and his wife Anne refused to discuss their move to
Rosehearty and the pub incident with reporters.
Rosehearty, an east coast fishing village, has a population of a few
hundred.
One local said that when the fishermen returned from sea they liked a
good drink at the weekend, but he also said they were mostly God-fearing
folk. He said the Grahams would have to change their attitude
drastically if they were to be accepted into the community.

THE former Labour group leader of Lothian Regional Council yesterday
demanded to know how much private cash had been invested in the
cash-strapped Edinburgh Festival Theatre, before a funding rescue
package was drawn up.
Mr John Mulvey called on the chairman of the theatre's trust, Lord
Younger, to reveal the financial contribution from the private sector in
the showpiece #20m opera house.
It is threatened with bankruptcy within the next five weeks, unless
more money is found.
Lord Younger immediately claimed private investment had exceeded all
expectations. He said that more than #4m had already been raised from
the private sector, surpassing the initial #3m target.
He has written to Edinburgh District Council and Lothian Regional
Council asking for help in cutting a #3.1m deficit.
Mr Mulvey said: ''When the Festival Theatre project was launched, Lord
Younger was making statements about what they were expecting from the
private sector and I would like to know whether that figure came
anywhere near the private money which was invested in the theatre.
''You inevitably find that when the Government or other public sector
groups pair up with the private sector, the private sector's
contribution amounts to very little,'' said Mr Mulvey, who held the
Hailes Ward in Lothian until quitting the regional council in 1990.
Urgent talks are expected to take place involving the city's councils
and Lord Provost Norman Irons, who is vice-chairman of the theatre trust
has said he will be asking the Scottish Office to give both Lothian
region and Edinburgh District Council permission to borrow more cash to
give extra funds to the theatre.
The Labour leader of Lothian region, Councillor Eric Milligan pledged
maximum support for the theatre.
''We are mounting a continuation appeal. We have a new set of
fundraisers and a new committee. Given time, I have no doubt we can
raise the necessary money, but we can't do it in a week, or two weeks,''
he said.
Lord Younger said he was confident the money could be found to save
the theatre from bankruptcy and stressed it would cost more to close the
building.

<HEADLINE>Call for curbs on perks for top brass</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978600192</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TOUGH curbs on the perks enjoyed by senior military officers and cuts
in the number of official residences were recommended in a long-awaited
Government report published yesterday.
The study by Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman of food company APV, also
called for most full-time domestic staff to be axed and much greater use
made of civilians.
However, Sir Peter's investigation of entertainment within the armed
forces concluded there was a legitimate requirement to entertain.
Senior officers were delighted at his endorsement of the long-standing
tradition of entertainment in their own official residences.
Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames, who accepted the
recommendations and pledged to proceed with them, said last night in a
Commons written reply that the MoD spent #5,103,000 on official
hospitality in 1994-95.
The figure included spending incurred by the MoD itself, by the armed
forces at home and abroad, and by individual officers in command and
international appointments, for which entertainment allowances were
payable.
The Cazalet report was immediately labelled a ''whitewash'' by Labour
MP for Wallsend, Mr Stephen Byers, who has led a campaign against, what
he views as, the excessively lavish lifestyle of senior military
officers.
''There will be many squaddies and officers who have just received
their P45s who will be wondering why millions of pounds are still being
wasted in this way,'' he said.
But Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, Mr Menzies Campbell, described
the report as ''entirely sensible''.
During his six-month investigation Sir Peter looked at restaurants,
hotels, and officers' messes as possible alternatives to official
residences for entertaining.
He decided they did not offer the same value for money as official
homes, which proved cheaper and offered a much more ''relaxed and
convivial atmosphere''.
But Sir Peter called on the MoD to tighten rules surrounding the
eligibility of officers to occupy official residences, which currently
total 75 -- 63 in Britain and 12 overseas.
New rules would undoubtedly cut the number of official residences, he
claimed, and he urged the MoD to review their numbers when there is a
concentration in any one area -- such as Portsmouth, where there are
seven.
Sir Peter saved his strongest recommendations for the need to cut the
350 domestic staff permanently employed at official residences.
He said the number of full-time staff at a number of properties was
''disproportionate'' to what was required, and he agreed that some of
the public criticism in recent months was justified.
More civilian and part-time staff should be used and resources should
be ''pooled'' between various residences. Sir Peter could see no reason
for retaining the 110 cooks or chefs currently employed full-time at
senior officers' residences or quarters.
He also called for an end to the use of forces personnel as cleaners
in the residences.
New rules were also urged to remove the possibility of abuses of
entertainment allowances, currently paid to 1200 services personnel.

SCOTLAND's first National Lottery millionaires toasted their good
fortune at a champagne reception yesterday, but said that it would be a
case of carry on working.
Jim and Joyce McGurk, of Linlithgow, West Lothian, scooped #1,355,975
for matching all six numbers in last Saturday's draw. Yesterday they
were still trying to relay the news to son Craig, 19, who is stationed
with the Parachute Regiment in Belfast.
The couple, who live in Strawberry Bank, Linlithgow, were one of 14
jackpot winners in the #18.9m roll-over draw.
Mr McGurk, 47, an administrative officer in West Lothian District
Council's leisure services department, selected his numbers at random.
Speaking of their windfall yesterday, he said: ''My philosophy has
been if a number comes up one week it's unlikely to come up the next.
''It certainly worked this week. I think 20 came up a week past so I
put in 22 instead. I was on my own on Saturday night when I checked my
ticket half a dozen times to make sure it was real.''
The couple said they did not intend to give up their jobs, although Mr
McGurk quipped that he might be slightly late for work today.
His wife, 44, is a director of a private catering company, Treetops
Catering Ltd, which runs the Beecraigs restaurant in Linlithgow.
Only last week, Mr McGurk gave their other son David, 22, who is a
barman in his mother's restaurant, and his wife a loan of #5000 to buy a
car.
Yesterday, he joked that he planned to let them off paying the
interest.
The couple admitted that they would not be able to resist buying a new
car, but Mr McGurk added modestly that ''a Jaguar would not fit beside
our house''.
A keen golfer, he said he would like to move to a new home but his
wife, who has lived in the same house all her life, is not so keen. The
couple bought the 100 year-old house from Mrs McGurk's mother.
One luxury the couple are planning is a holiday, possibly on a cruise
to the Caribbean.
Meanwhile, a pit village devastated when its colliery was shut down
has got something new to smile about -- after two jackpot lottery wins.
Thirty-five care workers at the Leonard House old people's home in
Silksworth near Sunderland scooped another of the #1.3m jackpot prizes.
The win -- which will mean #38,742 for each of care staff -- comes
only a fortnight after pensioners Bob and May Carruthers, who live near
the home in Silksworth, won #2.4m.

MPs LAST night rejected a move to tighten the rules on the punishment
parents in Scotland can mete out to their children.
A Labour amendment to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, seeking to
define the limits within which children can be struck, was defeated by
260 votes to 193, a majority of 67.
The MPs' decision means that a clear ban on striking a child with a
stick, belt, or other object likely to cause injury will not be imposed,
and it will be left to the courts to decide cases on the basis of
current law.
A smack for bad behaviour will be all right, but anything beyond that
could be a matter for the courts.
Last night's appeal for a definition of what constitutes ''reasonable
chastisement'' was led by Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson. He
said what Labour was putting forward was based on a recommendation from
the Scottish Law Commission and that if the Government refused the
change it would be ''rightly condemned all over Scotland.''
Mr Robertson said the Labour amendment did not prohibit nor seek to
prohibit physical punishment in the family home and did not even seek to
prohibit all forms of punishment.
What it did seek to do was to protect the child without diminishing
the right to deliver reasonable physical punishment against the child in
the home.
It should be ''totally unacceptable for a child to be hit with a cane
or a belt or a whip,'' and Labour was trying to set out parameters
within which the courts could exercise their discretion.
Labour MP Sam Galbraith (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) said: ''This is
not about telling you not to smack your weans'', while the SNP's
Margaret Ewing said: ''This is a small measure but is one that the
Scottish Law Commission has reflected very clearly in its report.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Jim Wallace said it was ''unacceptable''
that implements should be used to hit children.
There was less, sympathy, however, from the Tory benches, notably from
Ayr Tory MP Phil Gallie, who reflected the Government line that current
law went far enough, and who admitted that he had struck his own
children.
He argued the new clause was modelled on the concept of political
correctness and was one more step towards forbidding parents to
administer any form of physical chastisement.
Asked about the treatment of his own children, he told the House:
''Yes, I struck them, but not in a way that would have marked them in
later life. I do not believe in any way that I inflicted undue pain or
injury on them.'' If he had, he was confident that the present law would
have dealt with the matter.
For the Government, Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton argued that under existing law parents could administer
reasonable punishment, but unacceptable punishment was a criminal
offence.
He claimed that the law did enough to protect children from violence,
whether it be by parents, teachers, or others in charge of children, and
the Labour proposals would place unnecessary constraints on the courts
to take all the circumstances of any particular case into consideration.
The Bill, which still has to go to the Lords, implements many of the
child care recommendations which followed the inquiries into alleged
child abuse in Orkney and Fife. It has attracted broad, all-party
support, but last night the Commons Speaker, Miss Betty Boothroyd,
chastised the Government for bringing forward more than 100 amendments
to the Bill at this late stage in its Commons passage.
The Bill was given an unopposed third reading, but senior spokesmen
from the Opposition parties made clear they still had reservations.
Labour's Maria Fyfe said a number of issues had not been brought
forward and expressed the hope they would be raised when the Bill went
to the Lords. They had come up in committee and it was disappointing
last night's debate had been rushed through.
With the cross-party co-operation on the Bill in danger of breaking
down, Mr Wallace, for the Liberal Democrats, expressed his own
reservations, and Mrs Ewing, for the SNP, said: ''This is not a perfect
Bill and there are many areas we have to explore further.''
Lord James sought to indicate that the Government still was keeping an
open mind on the issue by telling the House, in a clear reference to its
further progress: ''There is still a number of matters under
consideration which the House will have the opportunity to examine at a
later stage.''

THE by-election campaign for Perth and Kinross will begin today with
the threat of legal action hanging over it.
The move has echoes of the recent controversy over Panorama and the
Major interview.
This time the row involves the date set by the Tories, and how it
could maximise the impact of their Scottish conference next week.
The SNP is to consult its legal advisers today over what it called the
unprecedented prospect of a party being given three days of saturation
coverage on television of its conference during the highly-charged
period of the hustings.
The moving of the writ at Westminster at 2.30pm today acts as the
starter's pistol for the by-election, caused by the death of Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn.
The SNP starts as firm favourite to take the seat from the
Conservatives on May 25.
The SNP's chief executive, Mr Michael Russell said last night that the
potential for unfairness in having three days of televised coverage of a
conference stage-managed to show the Tory candidate Mr John Godfrey in a
good light in the middle of a by-election campaign was far more serious
than the controversy over the recent Panorama interview with the Prime
Minister.
''I admit the Scottish Tories may be in meltdown at the moment and
their conference may not be a pretty sight, but this is a serious issue
and one we will now be taking legal advice on,'' he said.
''I cannot think of a precedent for a conference being held 12 days
before a by-election and I am now actively seeking advice on the
television coverage of this conference. It does strike me as being very
iffy.''
The first broad hint that the setting of a date for the by-election
could be sooner rather than later came on Friday when Mr Godfrey staged
a news conference in Perth with Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley.
At this he pointed out that the Government could go as far as June 15
and still observe the parliamentary convention of having a poll within
three months of the death or stepping down of an MP. He added that they
would be ''comfortably'' inside that day, by a margin, it now emerges,
of three weeks.
It was first thought that the likeliest date for the by-election would
have been the day of the local elections on April 6 last month, a move
which would have stretched the resources of rival parties and submerged
a poor outcome amid general bad news for the Tories.
It was rumoured at the time that this was the favoured option of party
leaders in Scotland but that they were overruled by London. The next
most likely date was to coincide the by-election with this week's local
elections in England and Wales, again as a way of burying bad news, but
when the date passed for moving the writ it began to look as if the
Government was going to hold off until June.
Now party managers have picked a date with two advantages. It allows
them to use the party conference at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow
next week as a launch-pad for the by-election: Mr Godfrey is opening the
first debate. It also means that if the result is a humiliation, then at
least the following day Parliament rises for the Whitsun recess and the
Government will have a few days' respite to lick its wounds.
A System Three poll for The Herald in the constituency in March put
the SNP almost out of sight on 48%, with Labour on 23%, the Tories on
20% and the Liberal Democrats on 9%.
However, any complacency the Nationalists might have felt was jolted
by a poorer than expected showing in Perth itself during the local
elections, although across the constituency as a whole that result would
have reflected a comfortable parliamentary majority.
SNP candidate Ms Roseanna Cunningham, who overcame a tough start of
scrutiny of her private life during selection, has emerged as a strong
personality. She said yesterday: ''The sooner the better for this
by-election. Eight out of 11 recent by-elections would already have been
held by now.''
Mr Godfrey was in a typically relaxed mood. His party has barely
started making a presence felt on the streets, in contrast to the way
Labour and SNP battled it out for the attention of shoppers last weekend
while the Scottish Liberal Democrats were in town for their spring
conference.
He said it was true that he had dropped a hint about the date last
Friday, adding: ''I think the next few weeks will be extremely
interesting and I am looking forward to them immensely.''
SLD candidate Mrs Veronica Linklater said: ''We are obviously
delighted that a date has been fixed. It has been rather like being
engaged and not having a date for the wedding.''
Labour candidate Mr Douglas Alexander said: ''I am delighted to hear
the official campaign has now begun. The recent council elections showed
that the Tories cannot win this by-election. The Labour campaign is up
and running, with a record vote in April and New Labour on the road.''
Mr Jack McConnell, the Scottish Labour Party's general secretary, did
not seem bothered by the prospect of the Tories enjoying high-profile
coverage of their conference in Glasgow during the by-election campaign.
He said: ''I would have thought that the Scottish Tories' conference
would have been the best possible advert for voting Labour that we could
have wanted during the campaign.''
At the last General Election in 1992, the seat was retained by Sir
Nicholas with a majority of 2094 over Ms Cunningham.

BARONESS Thatcher plans to donate her collection of papers to the
nation free of charge, it was reported last night.
She apparently believes the Government was wrong to use National
Lottery money to buy the papers of Sir Winston Churchill for #12.5m.
There was widespread criticism after it emerged that Sir Winston's
grandson, Tory MP Mr Winston Churchill, would be the main beneficiary of
the sale.
A source close to Lady Thatcher is quoted as saying she wanted her
papers, said to be worth #5m, to be freely available for study.
While she does not dispute many of the Churchill papers were private,
she is said to believe the Government should have put up the money to
buy them from general funds.

AN Oscar-winning film company is shooting its new movie almost
entirely on a Highland train route threatened with the axe.
Work started this week on The Pen, a short comedy set on the Inverness
to Wick and Thurso line.
The 20-minute movie is the first made under the Tartan Shorts banner
since Peter Capaldi's Franz Kafka's Its a Wonderful Life scooped an
Academy Award last month.
Although its #45,000 budget is a far cry from the Hollywood
blockbusters, like Braveheart and Rob Roy, filmed in the Highlands last
year, it is being seen as another success in wooing film makers to the
North.
And the publicity it is likely to bring the north Highland route could
increase passenger numbers and prevent the line from being axed.
It is the first time a Tartan Shorts film has been made outside the
central belt and the eight-day filming stint by 12 cast and 35 crew will
bring a mini spending boom to the area.
Stars Bill Paterson, Iain Cuthbertson, Imelda Staunton and Colin
McCredie, will do most of their filming in Inverness, Dingwall and
further north. More than 100 extras are being employed to play train
passengers in the film.
The Pen, written by Iain Heggie and directed by Bill Pryde, follows
the fortunes of a passenger (Paterson) who is going for a job interview
but loses his pen when trying to fill in a form. He spends the rest of
the journey trying to acquire one.
Paterson, who has recently finished filming a new series called
Oliver's Travels, which was partly made in the Highlands, said: ''Bill
Pryde is an old friend since we were stage hands together at the
Edinburgh Festival, and I've known Imelda for some time.
''That and the chance to work in this area again and on a well-written
script were the reasons that interested me about this. It focuses on a
very simple dilemma, a man losing his pen, but it's all the things that
happen as he tries to find one that make it interesting.''
''It's a light comedy, it's not a film you are going to slit your
wrists to.''
The film's producer, Barbara McKissack, said: ''We wanted to take
Tartan Shorts out of the central belt and we were keen to come north to
use the wonderful Highland scenery.
''This keeps the ball rolling, as far as the Highlands is concerned,
after the success of bringing bigger films to the area last year.
Although our budget is nothing like some of the films that have come
here it is just as important.''
She added: ''Although it is not a glossy movie to publicise Scotland,
it will hopefully highlight the area and the north line and show people
there is a good working railway up here.''
The film will be premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival and will be
shown on BBC Scotland in January.

FRANTIC efforts were being made last night to calm down the reforming
zeal of Labour leader Mr Tony Blair after his Clause 4 triumph.
The Prime Minister is today expected to exploit an apparent difference
of opinion between Mr Blair and his deputy, Mr John Prescott.
Trade union leaders, irritated by Mr Blair's talk of reducing their
power further, stood apart from the issue publicly yesterday but they
have been busy on the phone to the Commons' offices of Mr Blair and Mr
Prescott. Further reforms will reduce the union voting power at Labour
conferences and possibly their representation on the party's national
executive.
The union leaders are concerned the pace of change may be too fast,
and yesterday Mr Prescott issued a note of caution after Mr Blair in
newspaper and television interviews had declared he would not be
''pushed around'' in government.
Mr Prescott said on BBC Television: ''People have got to remember that
we have to move together. Even those who are for something and those
against something. And those in victory should remember that.''
Later he issued a statement claiming: ''I said nothing that Tony Blair
would not say. And the idea that this was some kind of warning shot is
absurd.''
But the Tories were quick to spot a long-awaited sign of a serious
division in the Labour Party.
Employment secretary Michael Portillo claims Mr Prescott is more blunt
and direct than the ''warm words and waffle'' from Mr Blair. He says the
unions, worried about Mr Blair's triumphalism, are pressing Mr Prescott
for concessions.
Mr Portillo said: ''Tony Blair likes to give the impression that
Labour would not give special privileges to the trade unions. But
already they have been promised two privileges that they didn't have
even under past Labour governments.''
He said Labour would prevent employers from dismissing employees who
take part in strike action, and last year Labour promised unions a
statutory right to recognition which they have not had before.
The Employment Secretary, however, left it to the Prime Minister today
to confront Mr Blair on differences with his deputy.
Mr Blair has given the impression that he is eager to give more power
to his constituency activists and Labour councillors and reduce the
voting influence of the unions which Labour needs to finance the next
General Election. After his Clause 4 victory, wiping out Labour's
constitutional commitment to nationalisation, Mr Blair wants to deprive
the Tories of a campaigning weapon alleging that he is still in the
pocket of the unions.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said Labour's national executive
committee would start looking at the details of reform of union voting
power in the next few months. This infuriated the Labour left and this
is what the Prime Minister will be attempting to exploit this afternoon
when he faces Mr Blair at Question Time.
Mr Blair had used two newspaper interviews to express his anger at the
failure of two key unions, Unison and the TGWU, to back his drive to
modernise the party by scrapping its Clause 4 commitment to
nationalisation.
He demanded that big unions increased internal democracy, warned of
changes to the make-up of the NEC to stop it becoming a focus for
opposition, and again stressed the need to move to a cut in union voting
power at party conferences from 70% to 50%.
Then, at a news conference at Westminster after Mr Prescott had
appeared to distance himself from the moves, Mr Blair, only too aware of
the need to keep Mr Prescott on side in his crusade for change, dodged
specific questions on further curbs to union power.
He said the decision to cut union power at conferences was already
agreed in principle, and the party would ''discuss when that should
happen''.
Labour back-bencher Peter Mandelson, the arch moderniser and a close
aide of Mr Blair, called on the NEC to consider cuts in union power
based on growing party membership before this year's conference.
However, NEC member and leading left-winger Diane Abbott said it would
be a ''big mistake'' to ignore the real concerns felt across the Labour
movement at the failure to include a commitment to full employment and a
minimum wage in the new constitution, a key objection of both the TGWU
and Unison.
Left-wing MP Ken Livingstone agreed that cuts in links with unions
could lead to a damaging split, and union leaders made little effort to
hide their resentment at criticism from the party leadership.

THE name Bruce has been synonymous with disputes with the English
since 1314 when Robert I sent 20,000 of the auld enemy packing at the
Battle of Bannockburn.
Now, in a spirit that has survived seven centuries, a Scots actor has
taken up the cudgels again after landing the part of Robert the Bruce in
a new film, only to be told a few weeks later that he had been dropped
from the leading role after a veteran English actor allegedly objected
to his casting.
Mr Tom McGovern, 32, from Glasgow, contacted The Herald after reading
a story which said that the search for someone to play The Bruce in the
''historical epic'' had moved to England after screen tests at
Craigmillar Castle on the outskirts of Edinburgh failed to find an actor
for the role.
Mr Peter Ross, who manages the Scottish operation of Cromwell
Productions, the producers of the film, said at the time that the
''people at Craigmillar, on various accounts, were not suitable''.
He added: ''There are a lot of Scots actors based in and around London
and we thought it was sensible to go down there and give them the
opportunity.''
However, Mr McGovern told The Herald: ''It is entirely untrue to say
that a suitable actor could not be found to play Robert the Bruce. Apart
from the fact that this is a slight on all actors living in Scotland, I
was actually chosen to play the part.''
Mr McGovern, who trained at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama and played Macbeth and Doctor Faustus at the Tron as well as
making TV appearances in Pie In The Sky and various drama documentaries,
said provisional filming dates had been agreed, as was his fee.
Mr McGovern said he was offered the main part of The Bruce for a fee
of #2000 with a #1000 share in the company. He had also taken part in a
photo-shoot with actress Hilary McLean in Ludlow, Shropshire, where more
than 200 pictures were taken.
He added: ''One month after this confirmation was made I received a
phone call from Bob Carruthers, the producer, informing me that although
they still wanted me to play the part of The Bruce, a veteran English
actor involved in the movie did not agree with their choice.
''I was then offered a smaller role -- as John Comyn -- which I found
in this circumstance totally unacceptable.
''Initially I was devastated. Now I'm angry. I put myself out of work
to accept this part.
''The actors' union Equity is aware of the situation and legal
proceedings are now under way.''
The Bruce, after some scheduling problems, started filming at the
weekend in York and is expected to move to Scotland next month.
It stars Brian Blessed as Edward I, Hammer of the Scots, and Michale
Van Wijk, better known as Wolf from TV's Gladiators, who takes the part
of Sir Humphrey de Bohun. Oliver Reed is also expected to appear in the
film as Bishop Wishart of Glasgow, an adviser to Robert the Bruce, but
negotiations with Richard Harris fell through because of scheduling
commitments.
A spokesman for Mr McGovern's lawyers, Bannatyne, Kirkwood, France,
confirmed that they had begun legal action.
Last night Mr Peter Ross, of Cromwell Productions, was returning home
from filming in York and was unavailable for comment.

AN investigation was under way last night after a passenger door broke
away from a car shuttle train inside the Channel Tunnel.
The incident, the first of its kind since the tunnel was opened 12
months ago, caused delays of more than three hours. There were no
injuries.
Channel Tunnel operators Eurotunnel denied reports that the door was
ripped off by a passing train. A spokeswoman said officials were trying
to find out the cause of the accident -- which occurred on Friday night
but only came to light yesterday..
Eurotunnel said when the Le Shuttle train was loaded in Folkestone a
fault light warned something was wrong with one of the doors.
An engineer checked the door and it was decided to leave the car empty
but allow the train to make its journey.
No-one realised the door had come off until the train reached Calais.
The spokeswoman said a Eurostar passenger train following behind ran
over the door without the driver realising it was there.
Then a freight-carrying shuttle using the same line hit the door and
its driver reported what had happened.
Eurotunnel closed the affected section of line and diverted trains
through a second tunnel.
As a result there were delays of up to three-and-a-half hours from the
French side and two-and-a-half hours from the British side. Traffic was
back to normal by early Saturday.
A report will be sent to the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority and the
bi-national Inter-Governmental Commission, which issues operating
certificates.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Trade and Industry said:
''Eurotunnel will submit a report to the CTSA and once we have that
report any action that needs to be taken will be taken.''

A CHALLENGE to Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the Scottish Office Health
Minister, to clarify his position on NHS workers' pay was issued at a
May Day rally in Edinburgh yesterday.
Mr Jim Devine, senior regional officer of Unison, the public service
union, told the rally in the city's Usher Hall that Lord Fraser had
written to him: ''I would like to confirm that the Government wishes to
see all staff receive pay increases which are fair to them and
affordable for the NHS.''
''What does this statement mean?'' Mr Devine asked. ''Unison believes
that Scotland's 120,000 health service workers deserve an explanation.
''Will Lord Fraser now confirm that health service workers will
receive a pay increase of at least 3%, fully funded, with no strings
attached, and one that retains national pay bargaining, including the
pay review bodies?''
He added: ''Unison will see this as fair. Health service workers would
see this as fair. The general public would see this as fair. We await
Lord Fraser's reply with anticipation.''
Earlier, 1000 trade union members and supporters had marched along
Princes Street. The procession included a contingent of post office
workers, who were on strike yesterday, and hospital workers.
Mr John McAllion, MP, Scottish Labour spokesman on the NHS, said at
the rally that the 16 years of the Tory Government had destroyed the
case, not for socialism, but for market capitalism.
What millions of people wanted was a better way to run their affairs.
There was a stronger case for socialism than at any time in his life,
and this was nowhere more obvious than in the NHS.
Mr McAllion said the next Labour government must get rid of the
internal market which was fragmenting the NHS and get back to the
principle of planning the health service to meet patients' needs.
Asked about Mr Devine's challenge to Lord Fraser, a Scottish Office
spokesman drew attention to a circular issued last week by the
management executive of the NHS in Scotland to trust chairmen.
This said that trusts were in a position to make offers on the level
of local increase in pay and were encouraged to do so.
The spokesman said that local pay could secure awards which were both
fair to staff and affordable within the NHS.
In London, nurses and midwives held a vigil outside Health Secretary
Virginia Bottomley's headquarters hoping for a meeting with her about
their pay dispute.
Mrs Bottomley later urged nurses to settle their pay deals locally.
She said: ''Nurses undertake a vital role in the NHS. It is important
that they are now significantly better paid than they were and their pay
has risen by 78% when average earnings have gone up by 49%.
''Nurses have seen their pay rise more than hospital doctors in eight
of the 11 years since the independent review body was introduced. The
task now is to get back to local hospitals and discuss the offer on the
table.''

A MAN who fell 100ft to his death on a Highland mountain was named
yesterday as chemist, Mr Robert Ritchie, 29, of Manor Place, Edinburgh.
He was identified on the day a 21-year-old climber died on Snowdon in
North Wales.
Mr Ritchie had been climbing the western buttress of 2000ft Stac
Pollaidh, 20 miles north of Ullapool, on Sunday.
Deputy leader of the Dundonnell Mountain Rescue Team, Mr Mike Brown,
described how Mr Ritchie and a fellow member of St Andrews University
mountaineering club were roped together on a route graded ''very
difficult''.
Mr Brown said: ''The climb was 300-400ft. About three quarters of the
way up, Mr Ritchie lost his grip and fell. His fall should have been
arrested by a safety runner hammered into the rockface. Unfortunately,
the force and weight of his falling body yanked this out and he fell
further than he should have, perhaps 100ft.''
Mr Ritchie fell on to a ledge where he is thought to have died
instantly from head injuries.
Mr Brown commented: ''This is a very popular hill because among other
things, it is very close to the road. We have had the odd broken leg and
suchlike on Stac Pollaidh but this is the first fatality I have ever
heard of.''
The climber who fell to his death while walking up a ridge on Snowdon
was Mr Andrew Parry, 21, of Lydiate Ash, Bromsgrove, Birmingham. He was
in a party of six on Crib Goch.
He was airlifted to Gwynedd Hospital, Bangor, by RAF helicopter but
was pronounced dead on arrival.
In another incident yesterday, a 28-year-old man was airlifted to
hospital after falling from cliffs at Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire. He was
rock climbing with four companions when the accident happened just north
of Slains Castle.
He was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary but his condition last night
was not known.

HOME buyers could find their mortgage insurance fails to cover
payments if they lose their jobs -- because they must pay income tax on
claim pay-outs, it emerged last night.
Junior Social Security Minister Roger Evans recently told mortgage
lenders that the Government considers mortgage insurance payments as
taxable income.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders has appealed to the Government to
allow the first year's payments of such policies to be tax-free, as are
private health insurance payments, according to a newspaper report.
People who start paying mortgages from October this year will not get
immediate Government help with housing costs if they fall ill or lose
their jobs -- they will have to wait nine months for mortgage support.
The Government has warned new borrowers to take out mortgage
protection policies to protect their homes. But if home buyers' claims
take them into a taxable bracket, they will have to pay income tax at
the rate for which their income makes them liable.
Halifax Building Society spokesman Mr Gary Marsh said: ''This will be
another blow to the housing market. People may find they do not have
enough cover to pay their mortgage if they lose their jobs, and
prospective buyers may find insurance premiums too expensive.''

THE continued operation of freight and passenger services on the West
Highland line is in jeopardy, according to the chairman of the West
Highlands Railway Action Group, Mr Drew Purdon.
Mr Purdon, a Lochaber councillor and local enterprise company
director, was speaking as details were emerging of a study by Edinburgh
based consultants Pieda into the economics of the threatened Fort
William sleeper service.
As revealed in The Herald yesterday, the study argues official figures
given for the public cost of supporting the sleeper are six times higher
than the real cost.
Pieda's research, published today, shows that the true cost of subsidy
per passenger could be as low as #70 per journey, if Railtrack charges
for track access and maintenance are discounted.
The Government and British Railways Board have quoted figures as high
as #453 and even #540.
Pieda says that the costs of maintaining the line, met by access
charges imposed by Railtrack, will remain the same regardless of whether
the sleeper continues. As such, the Railtrack charges should play no
part in determining the future of the overnight service.
Mr Purdon said: ''This report raises serious doubts about the accuracy
of the British Railways Board information and underlines the need for a
thorough and comprehensive economic analysis of the direct and indirect
implications of the service.
''At the very least, the sleeper and Motorail service must be allowed
to continue this summer.''
The service is due to be withdrawn on May 28, before consultation.
According to figures obtained by Pieda, Railtrack charges for the Fort
William sleeper were between #3.6m and #5.3m a year. Mr Purdon was
worried about these and other costs.
He said: ''If the sleeper is to go then the costs will have to be met
by remaining passenger and freight services. That could impose
intolerable burdens and put the entire West Highland line in jeopardy.
''The two biggest freight customers that use the line are Alcan and
Arjo Wiggins. They put more than #2m a year into that line and I know
that if they were charged any more they would just pull out and put
their business on to the roads.''
Meanwhile, it emerged last night that Richard Branson's Virgin Group
is not interested in taking over the Fort William sleeper service.
There had been speculation at the weekend that Mr Branson might be
considering a rescue bid, but Virgin Group's corporate affairs director,
Mr Will Whitehorn, said yesterday: ''Obviously somebody has got the
wrong end of the stick. We are not interested in bidding for the
ScotRail franchise.''
