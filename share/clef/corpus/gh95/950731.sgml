IT seems Matthew Warchus really does have the Midas touch. On his
debut production for the RSC he produced a Henry V of stunning visual
and emotional flair. Now here at the National, he's gone one better with
a Volpone that captures all the satirical exuberance of Ben Jonson while
exploiting the Olivier's theatrical resources to the full.
The Olivier has never looked better -- though acoustically and
speechwise it still leaves something to be desired. A fiendish text to
deliver, even Michael Gambon falls foul, swallowing words in a welter of
excess. Still, Warchus and designer Richard Hudson's brilliantly
designed production, with its primary colours, emblematic costumes
(scales of justice dangling from the heads of the judges) and central
motif of revolving doors -- partly echoing the clanging doors of
Restoration comedy, partly the dark, scurrying-behind-closed-doors
conspiracy of Jacobean tragedy -- guarantee the play's heartbeats of
farce and horror, theatrical wizardry and moral instruction come over
with powerful clarity.
Volpone's message is that money -- and the obsession with it -- is the
root of all evil. Warchus's whirligig-of-time production adds a sombre
note of comeuppance while delighting in its natural comic centre.
Gambon's fleshly Volpone -- a cross between a virile matinee idol and
Norman Evans in pantomime dame mode -- and Simon Russell Beale's fly
servant, Mosca, mine plenty of humour from their series of outrageous
schemes and scams.
But Warchus also ensures the scenes between Robin Soans's Corvino and
his virginal wife Celia -- lusted after by Volpone, procured by Mosca,
and sold for greed and the promise of inheritance by Corvino -- have a
reality of domestic abuse and violence so recognisable in our own lives
that laughter is stillborn.

ARBROATH County were in the nervous 90s -- and paid for it. You know
the feeling -- one off your first ton, and the whole world, never mind
the opposition, closes in on you.
The match against Stirling County at Williamfield was their
ninety-ninth since becoming members of the Caley 80/- counties league,
and those local perpetrators of agony -- George McGuire and Willie
Morton -- contrived not only to bowl them out for 90, but to have
identical figures of five for 37 in the process.
Yet it had all looked so comfortable. Arbroath won the toss, put
Stirling in to bat, and had Jon Taylor out for 20 and Morton walking
back for only 13, both falling to Arun Trivedi.
Professional Kyle Wealleans and Ker Henderson, though, suddenly began
to make a serious mess of the Arbroath attack, despite some excellent
bowling by their recent Pakistani acquisition, Muhammad Zahid, who ended
up having to settle for two wickets for 65.
And their partnership of 136 in Stirling's eventual total of 216 for
four was amazing for several reasons.
Wealleans made his first century since joining the club, despite
having two fingers strapped together -- ''they're shattered, and have
been for about three years,'' he said.
His 103 included eight 4s and a 6, and the fact that the remainder had
to be run on a hot, sticky day showed vividly as the New Zealander
trudged back looking shattered after having been stumped by Murray Clark
off Zahid's bowling.
Ker Henderson tweaked a leg muscle, and required Taylor to run for him
for his first half-century of the season -- yet it should never have
been. Henderson, during an innings of 55 which ended with him being
caught by Kevin Stott off Zahid, should have been run out earlier on.
He hit a superb drive which was cut off, but because Taylor was
running for him, when the ball was returned over the top of the stumps
to Clark, everyone was watching Wealleans scampering home at the other
end, and Henderson merely standing there. Further out in the square,
runner Taylor was yards out of his ground. Only the spectators, it
seems, noticed.
Arbroath then fell under the spell of McGuire and Morton. Their first
wicket fell at 30, the next two at 35, the next four at 52, and the rest
was downhill all the way to 90 -- Arbroath's worst league score of the
season, despite Kevin Robb's 32.
The main question now seems to be who can stop leaders Aberdeenshire.
Their task at Mannofield on Saturday was made easier by the fact that
Clackmannan County could raise only 10 players.
Their 99 all out total was even more remarkable because professional
Malcolm Howell made 72 of them without losing his wicket. His colleagues
at the other end merely formed a procession back and forth to the
pavilion as Sanju Mudkavi took five for 18, and Andy Bee three for 45.
Aberdeenshire's Neil MacRae, with 47, and Neil Robertson with 49, both
just missed out on half-centuries because Aberdeenshire hit their
target, finishing on 103 without loss.
There were a couple of century-makers at McKane Park, Dunfermline, as
the strong-going Forfarshire defeated Fifeshire by seven wickets. Fife's
Ashok Malhotra was unbeaten on 124 as the home side made 207 for eight,
with Barry Stewart and Gordon Walker each taking three wickets.
But 109 from John Phillips and 49 from Graeme Garden took Forfar to
victory on 208 for three -- a result which puts them into third place in
the league.
Perthshire had no answer to West Lothian's 221 for seven at the North
Inch. Sanjay Patel made 83, Steve Crawley 80, with Lal Rajput's three
for 69 the only brake.
Ian Beven then showed how it should be done with five for 39, and Paul
Crosse chipped in with three for 36 as Perthshire crumbled to 103 all
out.
It was a tense affair at Lochside Park. Mark Mudie made 84 of
Strathmore's 179 for eight against Ayrshire, whose Andy Tennant (4-41)
and Javed Ashraf (3-36) were the men in charge in attack.
But the continuing form of Dominic Rigby with the bat -- he made 59 --
took the Prestwick side to victory, despite Andy Monteith taking five
for 37. Ayrshire made 180 for eight.

ENGLAND'S dramatic victory yesterday by six wickets in the Fourth Test
at Old Trafford was set up in a sensational first over by
man-of-the-match Dominic Cork.
In only his third Test, since making an auspicious start to an
international career last month, Cork produced the first hat trick in 38
years to be seen at this level.
But much of the drama and excitement was reserved for the final
session of play during England's second innings when the rampaging West
Indians grabbed four for 48 in addition to seeing Robin Smith retire
hurt. That particular period brought back memories of England being
dismissed for 46 in Trinidad in March last year.
Eventually, it was the steady Jack Russell who held the innings
together and saw England home without further damage.
Needing just 94 to win, England were on course at 39 without loss when
a close run-out decision, with the assistance of the third umpire, saw
Mike Atherton depart for 22. England then lost the next three wickets
for nine runs in a jittery half-hour period.
Ian Bishop had Nick Knight taken low at second slip by substitute
Chanderpaul, who later also held a similar catch from Craig White off
Kenny Benjamin. In between those dismissals, Benjamin had Graham Thorpe,
who top-scored in the first innings with 94, taken at long leg from a
hook shot. He had taken two for two in 12 balls.
With Robin Smith retired hurt after having deflected a ball from the
shoulder of his bat on to his cheekbone, things were looking grim for
England. But while John Crawley held his end, Russell eased the pressure
with five boundaries in his unbeaten 31.
A near capacity crowd had seen the dismissals of Richie Richardson,
Junior Murray and Carl Hooper with the last three balls of the opening
over from Cork, thus
destroying whatever hope the West Indies may have held of compiling a
large total after resuming their second innings on 159 for three.
The most punishing blow of the three that he struck so early was the
dismissal of Richardson. The West Indies' captain, who had batted for
four hours in making 69 in the previous Test, posed, along with Brian
Lara, the major threat to England forcing a victory yesterday to level
the six-Test series at 2-2.
After having added just one to his overnight score of 21, Richardson
pushed at the fourth ball of the morning and deflected it, off the
inside edge, into his stumps. The next ball from the irrepressible Cork
trapped Murray in front of his wicket and finally, when Hooper, coming
well down the order because of a broken finger, was leg before, Cork had
reduced the tourists to 161 for six. Only twice previously has a Test
hat trick happened in England -- in 1957 by P Loader, also against the
West Indies, and in 1889 by J T Hearne, both at Headingley.
The West Indies were still trailing by 60 runs and with just four
wickets left, the end seemed imminent. But Lara had other ideas.
Parading his unquestionable prowess for the first time in the series, he
demonstrated his extraordinary ability in both innings of this Test
match.
Following his 87 in the first knock, he spent four and three quarter
hours at the crease in taking his side towards a respectable total. His
massive contribution of 145 in a total of 314 came from 216 balls, and,
curiously, both his innings contained 16 boundaries.
He batted with authority and guided the lower order batsmen in
invaluable partnerships, putting on 43 and 49 for the eighth and ninth
wickets. With the last pair adding 31, it had been an excellent effort
by the tailenders in their record stand for the last two wickets on this
ground.

INDIAN Test man Anil Kumble claimed four victims to put
Northamptonshire within sight of victory over leaders Warwickshire in
the clash of the chief Britannic Assurance Championship title chasers at
Edgbaston.
But Middlesex and Lancashire kept up the pressure on the leading pair
by completing victories over Sussex and Somerset respectively.
Yorkshire, however, suffered a big blow at the hands of
Nottinghamshire after their batsmen failed once again. And in the fourth
match to finish inside three days, Leicestershire came out tops against
Surrey with the help of an impressive bowling display by Allan Mullally.
Northamptonshire's Kumble took four for 49 as defending champions
Warwickshire, chasing 275 for what would be an invaluable victory,
closed on 161 for six, with Dermot Reeve 56 not out.

WEST of Scotland will meet Drumpellier in the final of the Whyte &amp;
Mackay Scottish Cup at Hamilton Crescent on August 20 after having won a
semi-final yesterday. West, the last Western Union team to triumph in
the competition five years ago, will be going for their third win, while
the Coatbridge club will seek to add to the hat trick of successes they
enjoyed between 1979 and '82.
Poloc made the short trip across the city to face West yesterday in
the wake of a morale-boosting victory over Clydesdale a day earlier, but
in the end they could only wonder what might have been had slippy
fingers not proved their undoing.
They batted first and made 209 all out. Sajid Ali was top scorer with
80, but a partnership of 53 between David Hindmarsh and Neil McCrossin
at the death was equally valuable.
When the home side began their reply, Poloc had to take their chances
if they were to reach the final for the second successive season.
Instead, they suffered from dropsy. Despite having Alistair Storie and
Craig Wright run out, the home side benefited from fielding foibles.
Jon Williams was dropped -- twice -- the first time when he had made
just seven, and Wright also was put down. The pair went on to share a
match-winning stand of 94, and Williams was still there at the end,
unbeaten on 69 as West reached 212 for four to win with seven balls
remaining.
At Langloan, Ayr batted first, with a score of 100 from Scotland
opener Bruce Patterson representing the highlight of their 216 for nine.
When Drumps got their use of the track, 42-year-old Peter Campbell
proved that last week's maiden century was no flash in the pan by
leading the way with 69 out of the winning 218 for five.
Campbell's moment of glory in the Western Union came against West at
Hamilton Crescent. You can be sure he can't wait to go back there next
month.

* FREUCHIE'S hopes of another trip to Lord's were shattered last night
when they were defeated by holders Woodhouse Grange in the British
Village Cup quarter-final by exactly 100 runs.
The Yorkshiremen made 227 for eight before bowling out the injury-hit
Fifers for 127. Top scorer for the Scottish side was David Cowan with
34, but Freuchie never really recovered from the loss of four quick
wickets.

A THRILLING climax to yesterday's Scottish Counties Cup final at
Lochside Park showed that cricket can be very much a spectator sport.
West Lothian claimed a memorable triumph away to Strathmore County,
with their victory coming in the last ball of the match.
With one ball remaining, the straightforward, if not exactly easy,
task for Strathmore's last men, Steve Atkinson and Alan MacKay, was to
get three runs for victory.
However, Atkinson's hit proved not to be strong enough, and he was
eventually run out, his fine knock of 33 being to no avail.
West Lothian had opened strongly, with the first men in, David Orr and
Steven Crawley, putting on a stand of 60. David Fleming chipped in with
47, but the rest of the order collapsed as Steve Blackie, with three for
37, and Steve Atkinson, four for 34, proved too aggressive for the
visiting batsmen.
In Strathmore's reply, opener Neil Hazel hit 52, putting on a
third-wicket stand of 89 with Aussie Mark Kelaher, who eventually made
31.
After this good start, however, the home side looked to be falling
away before Atkinson arrived. He made a stand of 40 with Blackie and
that gave the home side some hope.

AMBITIOUS Clyde will start work this week on a #2m extension to
develop further their Broadwood Stadium. This latest stage of the
building work at their Cumbernauld ground will provide a new stand
behind one of the goals, four six-a-side astro turf pitches and eight
new dressing rooms.
Manager Alex Smith believes the new stand will help his side in their
aim to win promotion from the second division.
He said: ''Once it is up, it will stop the wind sweeping down the
pitch, as it did last season, making the ball difficult to control.
Airdrie, who also play here, complained about that last time.
''We like to play football and it will help our players not having to
cope with such severe conditions at every home game. It will also give
our fans a bit more shelter from the cold wind.
''This is another important step forward for the club as we develop.
We now have 21 full-time professionals, including our young lads, and we
have four ground-staff boys.''
Clyde were handed a lesson on Saturday, however, as they fell 2-0 to
Portsmouth in a pre-season match, with former Celtic striker Gerry
Creaney and Guy Butters on target.
* ABERDEEN'S Paul Kane, who was slapped on the transfer list by
manager Roy Aitken, has been ordered to stay at home as the Dons go on
their pre-season tour of England.

STRIKER Willie Watters could yet pull off an amazing turnaround and
stay at Stirling Albion.
Watters last week said goodbye to his Forthbank team-mates and told
manager Kevin Drinkell he would sign with Arbroath.
But Drinkell said yesterday: ''I have now had a telephone call from
Willie saying he is still thinking it over. I believed he had already
signed for them.
''I am now meeting him on Monday evening when it will be decided if he
is staying with us.
''This has put me in a peculiar situation, for I had already confirmed
to people that we would be without him. It also raises questions about
the method of dealing with players out of contract.
''I know some time ago there was a suggestion that players who move
under freedom of contract should not be allowed to play for other clubs
until a decision is reached by a transfer tribunal.
''It's maybe something we should look at, for it could then force
clubs to get around the table.''
* QUEEN'S Park continue their hectic build-up to the new season
tonight when they meet Bolton.
Queen's are just back from a three-game trip to Ireland and manger
Hugh McCann said yesterday: ''I was pleased that we had a good
workout.''
Queen's drew two and lost the third game, but it was a hectic schedule
after having to travel without three of their top squad, including
influential Gary Orr, due to injury.
However, McCann said: ''This gave me the opportunity to prepare for
starting the season without them.''

THE Celtic fans who travelled to Birmingham on Saturday -- almost 5000
of them -- were forced to see their team suffer yet another pre-season
defeat when they lost 1-0.
This time, however, there seemed more hope for the future, as the
Parkhead men went down to a second-half goal from striker Ian Muir, who
had come on as substitute for the English first-division side.
Hope, because of the way Pierre van Hooydonk played, when he appeared
immediately after the interval.
And the rising hope among the fans, and the Celtic players themselves,
that new signing Andreas Thom will add another vital, incisive spark to
the last third of the pitch, where the team can still, at times,
struggle.
The capture of Thom has not only raised the spirit of the fans, it has
also lifted the confidence of the players as they continue to build
towards the challenges of the new season.
Midfielder John Collins probably spoke for all his team-mates when he
observed after the Birmingham game: ''We always knew that new players
would be arriving. I know the fans must have been concerned, especially
with Rangers apparently signing just about every player of quality on
the market.
''But the manager had taken us aside and told us that new players,
quality players, would be coming to the club.
''Having more quality players in the team obviously means the chance
of more success and that's what all of us want at the club.
''From what I know of Andreas Thom, he has quality -- anyone who has
won the number of caps for his country that he has, must be special. We
are just looking forward to having him in the side.
''The pre-season games have been hard work, but we know we are making
improvements all the time and we want to be right for the home game
against Newcastle.
''On a personal note, I want to be ready for the Scotland game against
Greece, too. That is important for the European championship
qualification and is arriving very early in the season. So, at the
moment, the more games we have, the better.''
Burns, meanwhile, is not going to sit back happily with just the one
new signing. He wants more and the suggestion is that they will arrive
before the European Cup-winners' Cup signing deadline, which is still
two weeks away.
After this game, Burns insisted: ''We know the new player will add an
extra dimension to the team, but it doesn't mean the buying has stopped.
''We know we want to bring in more quality and we intend to do that.''
Thom, in the meantime, has returned to Germany and will be back at
Parkhead later this week. His likely debut could be against Newcastle.
So far, skipper Paul McStay has not played in the pre-season matches,
still shaking off the after-effects of his close-season operation. He
could be back in training this week and that will give Burns still more
quality on the field.
Says the Celtic manager: ''We still must do a little more in the last
third of the park. Pierre van Hooydonk got himself into scoring
positions several times this afternoon -- and that was good.
''What wasn't so good was that he didn't take the chances when they
arrived. But he knows that. If he gets three openings like those he had
today, he has to take one, or maybe even two of them.
''He was really unlucky with the free kick which struck the top of the
bar.''
Celtic made as many chances as the home team, but Muir's goal in 55
minutes was enough to edge the newly-promoted English side to a victory
they had hoped for but not really expected.
Their manager, Barry Fry, admitted as much afterwards when he pointed
out: ''This was an important and encouraging result for the side. We
knew it was a big test and that's how it turned out. The big Dutch
fellow did cause us problems when he came on, and it was a brilliant
free kick which hit our crossbar.
''I have to tell you, though, this is the first time since I came here
that I have seen our supporters outnumbered and outshouted by the
opposition fans. These people were incredible.
''I am sure they will help Celtic become a major force in Scottish
football again. You have to have success with that lot backing you.''
Celtic will now move on to Goodison and a clash with Everton tomorrow
in Neville Southall's testimonial before their emotional homecoming to
Parkhead at the weekend.
Burns will be hoping van Hooydonk will find the scoring touch which
eluded him on Saturday. If that returns, then Celtic could start winning
games again.
CELTIC -- Marshall, Vata, McKinlay, Boyd, Mowbray, Grant, Donnelly,
Gray, Walker, Falconer, Collins. Substitutes -- O'Donnell, van Hooydonk,
McNally, Mackay, McLaughlin.

THE prospect of a single currency created by European Monetary Union
raises competitive issues for banks -- and analysts see more mergers and
a shift of business from London to Frankfurt and Paris as possible
outcomes.
The earliest possible start date for a single currency is 1999, it is
now accepted. In order to qualify, member states must meet strict
economic criteria set out by the Maastricht Treaty but to date, only
Luxembourg, Germany, and Ireland meet the guidelines.
Given the Bundesbank's tacit endorsement of the European Commission's
''critical mass'' plan towards a single currency, experts say some
bankers in Continental Europe sense a competitive advantage that they
wish to exploit.
''There seems to have been some pressure (on the Bundesbank) from
larger German banks who would like to have a competitive edge over other
banks,'' says Joachim Fels, international economist at Goldman Sachs in
Frankfurt.
Simply put, large banks are seen to be better equipped, both in
financial and technological terms, to undertake the costly changeover to
a single currency -- a point not lost on their smaller brethren.
The sums involved in such a transition are enormous, and because of
the likely industry shakeout there has been growing concern that smaller
banks would have to be compensated.
''There are competitive issues for the smaller banks because they may
not be able to prepare so quickly for the transition process,'' says
Elena Letemendia, head of the European Banking Federation in Brussels.
In addition, operations of a future European central bank would only
be conducted with countries participating in the single currency.
What this suggests for British banks, should London refuse to join
monetary union, is anybody's guess. But some are already sounding
warnings that the City may lose its lustre as Europe's financial
capital.
''It is possible to see a scenario in which London's position would be
given a serious blow,'' says Patrick de Jacquelot in a new report for
the Centre for the Study for Financial Innovation in London.
Mr De Jacquelot argues that French Treasury officials see the monetary
policy of a European central bank working in the financial markets of
the member states and ''nowhere else.''
''The Ecu funding of the European Central Bank would thus take place
mostly on the money markets of Frankfurt and Paris with some business
going to other core country centres such as Amsterdam,'' says Mr De
Jacquelot.
The upshot of this scheme is that those left outside the single
currency bloc would have to become more fully engaged in places like
Paris if they wanted to reap the benefits of a new currency.
But not all are concerned that Britain would immediately suffer a
setback. As some point out, banking is a business where there is a
premium on relationships and human capital, all of which needs to be
carefully nurtured over long periods of time. -- Reuter

HE slipped into Ibrox, that increasingly exclusive club of disparate
internationalists, almost unnoticed. No fanfare, no hype. Stephen
Wright's arrival mirrored perfectly his nature.
Quiet and unassuming, Wright is easily the type who could find himself
submerged and then lost among the many egos and characters who make up
the new Rangers.
The former Aberdeen defender, who was signed for #1.5m, will be 24 the
day before Rangers move into European action next week, and he will have
to assert himself around Ibrox. Wright must accept this opportunity to
take the step from solid journeyman to genuine craftsman, and to do so
he may have to come out of his shell and make his presence felt more
than he has managed so far in his career.
When he broke into Aberdeen's first team he turned heads with his
reading of the game and his speed, but as with most emerging talents his
development stalled and, for the past couple of seasons, he was in
jeopardy of stagnating. Aberdeen's decline and, of course, personal
injury did not help his cause, but there were times when it appeared as
though he was all too content with his lot.
In fact, too many of Aberdeen's younger players appeared to be
hampered by a similar affliction, but at least Rangers have pulled
Wright from what could have been described as a cosy, safe job and given
him the chance to go forward. Probably their interest was pressed home
just in time, because another season or two without the added stimulus
of being part of a truly large club and it might have been too late for
Wright.
Now life begins again for the full back, and provided that the player
Walter Smith believes lurks within Wright's slight frame can be teased
and tempted to emerge, he could become an exciting addition to what
again is beginning to look like a powerful squad.
While they wait for Paul Gascoigne to regain the sharpness of instinct
and reflex which carried him to superstardom, Rangers will shuttle their
full backs between a three and five-man defensive line, and Wright will
be allowed ample opportunity to demonstrate his skills and his worth to
the side.
He may have signed on the club's headed notepaper and he may wear the
club's tie and jacket, but that is merely superficial. He has to show
the manager and the fans that he does indeed have the right stuff.
Wright has already wasted too much time in self-satisfied mode when he
seemed content to play within himself, to do only the minimum, but that
won't be acceptable to Smith, who will demand everything his players
have to give as Rangers gear up to make an impression in Champions'
League football. Wright will find he must become more adventurous and
take a much greater part in matches.
After Rangers had beaten Steaua Bucharest 4-0 on Saturday, Wright
said: ''If I can do as well as David (Robertson) here, then I'll be a
happy man.''
Robertson and Wright were team-mates at Pittodrie and Wright could do
worse than take a close look at the other full back, who uses his
blinding speed to assist Rangers attacks and offer midfield players
options by surging through into dangerous positions. Wright, who also
has a fair turn of foot, has to make these runs also and become more
involved in what is happening in other parts of the pitch.
If he fails to do it at Ibrox, where he is surrounded by
internationalists, then he will not do it anywhere else.
Rangers want him to support forward plays and he will start the season
with that instruction. It is entirely up to the player now and he must
not become intimidated by the stature of some of those with whom he now
shares a dressing room.
Smith has had a problem at right back ever since Gary Stevens went
into decline, and after having tried such various players as Craig
Moore, Alan McLaren, John Brown, and Stuart McCall, the manager has
turned to Wright. Smith expects a great deal from the newcomer, who has
the chance to make himself an integral part of what is shaping up to be
a side of some style and panache.
Wright should be able to operate without the fear of leaving spaces
behind him should he venture forward, because Rangers will have Richard
Gough, McLaren, and Gordan Petric patrolling at the back. It should be a
formidable triumvirate and one which should give Wright the confidence
he needs.
Petric, who didn't play in Saturday's match, relishes the chance to
play against the best in Europe, although you would never know it to
look at him. He has one of those faces which registers neither despair
nor joy, but he can play a bit and the European game should suit his
style perfectly.
''A couple of clubs in England and one or two in Europe were after me,
but I have come here to a big club and now I have a big job in front of
me,'' he said. Someone asked if he felt he owed a debt of gratitude to
Ivan Golac, the former manager of Dundee United who signed him from
Partizan Belgrade, the 26-year-old thought long and hard before saying
''No.''
Petric is supremely confident in his own ability and pointed out: ''I
know how to play.''
Wright could learn from him also.

LANARK brothers Colin and Alister McRae pulled off a remarkable double
over the weekend with international rally victories -- 12,000 miles
apart.
Yesterday Colin won the Rally of New Zealand for the third consecutive
year, bringing his tally of world-championship event wins to four, while
brother Alister was winning the Formula 2 category of the Ulster Rally.
In one of the coldest winters on record, Colin and co-driver Derek
Ringer, driving a Subaru Impreza 555, fended off an unrelenting attack
from reigning world champion Didier Auriol to beat the Frenchman by 44
seconds after 30 timed special stages and 500 kilometres of competitive
driving.
''This win gives me a good shot at the world championship,
particularly with two of my favourite events still to come, Australia
and the RAC Rally, both of which I won last year,'' said Colin at
yesterday's finish in Auckland.
He is now fourth overall and back in contention for the world title
with three rounds remaining. He will start September's Rally of
Australia 11 points behind new leader Auriol.
Auriol's Toyota team-mate, Finland's Juha Kankkunen, navigated by
Welshman Nicky Grist, was third.
Berwickshire's Andrew Cowan saw his three-car Mitsubishi team reduced
to one finisher, Sweden's Kenneth Eriksson in fifth place.
On Saturday, 24-year-old Alister McRae drove his Nissan Sunny GTi over
the finishing ramp of the Belfast-based Stena Sealink Ulster
International Rally as winner of the fiercely-fought Formula 2 category,
claiming maximum points in the Mobil 1/Top Gear British Rally
Championship.
Alister and co-driver David Senior have now regained the lead of the
five-round series and will start September's finale on the Isle of Man
with a six-point lead over Frenchman Alain Oreille.
The Ulster rally was won by Bertie Fisher from Ballinamallard, driving
a Subaru Impreza, but Alister McRae finished fourth overall after an
attacking drive on Saturday's second leg. Re-starting in ninth place, he
delivered a stunning turn of speed over the 11 closed road special
stages around Lough Neagh to overhaul his rivals in the class for
two-litre, two-wheel-drive cars.
Three of Alister's rivals crashed on Friday's first leg when a freak
rainstorm flooded the narrow roads, catching out many drivers who had
opted to use slick racing tyres.
''I drove safely and took no risks. Saturday was dry, so I got a bit
of a push on,'' said Alister. ''I needed this result after not finishing
June's Scottish Rally. The British championship title is now a distinct
possibility,'' he added.
Kelso's Dom Buckley, driving a factory-prepared VW Golf GTi, finished
sixth in Formula 2 and tenth overall. Kilmarnock's Robbie Head retired
his works Renault Clio Williams with a broken gearbox.
Tom Coughtrie, from Ayr, finished a lowly forty-second in his Subaru
Legacy, losing his lead in the championship's Production Cup. Results:

CHRIS Eubank has never shot so explosively from the lip as he did in
Whitley Bay.
The ever-controversial Eubank hit right on an Irish nerve when he
warned Dublin's World Boxing Organisation super-middleweight champion
Steve Collins that he must face the consequences if hypnotherapy
continues to be part of his build-up to their September 9 re-match in
Cork.
After blitzing Spaniard Jose Iganacio Barruetabena in 55 seconds of a
painful mis-match, the ''new'' Eubank advised Collins: ''If you lose
your life, if you want to cheat by using schoolboy tactics, it's down to
you. I'll have no remorse.''
It was an angry and insensitive verbal salvo and is guaranteed to get
him a hostile reception when he confronts Collins for the second time.
Boxing Board secretary John Morris said he ''utterly deplored this
type of build-up'' to the Collins-Eubank fight, adding that the Cork
title bout was under the jurisdiction of the Board's Irish counterparts.
''I'm sure the Irish Board will share the view of the British Board
that we utterly deplore this type of build-up to a fight,'' he added.
Eubank took little time to dispose of Barruetabena, the 23-year-old
son of a Bilbao fisherman, who was floored twice in the brief farce
which incurred the displeasure of a 5000 capacity crowd.
On the same bill, Irvine's Paul Weir, the WBO light-flyweight
champion, took a rare break from fighting world-championship contests
when he was impressive in outpointing tough Mexican Jose Luis Velarde
over 10 rounds.
* BELFAST bantamweight Wayne McCullough maintained his unbeaten record
by claiming the World Boxing Council title on a split decision from
Japan's Yasuei Yakushiji in front of his home crowd in Nagoya.

ALREADY Paul Gascoigne has shown enough to convince even the most
cynical of football observers that he is still in possession of all his
sublime skills. Allied to an eye for an opening and a penchant for the
unexpected, these talents should make him one of the most exciting
players Scottish football has ever accommodated, but then again . . .
Only Gascoigne himself, or to be more precise his other half, the
ridiculous bleached-blond creature known as Gazza, can prevent this
player from being loved by everyone still able to appreciate true
skills, after all these seasons of sweat and toil which Scottish fans
have had to endure.
Gazza, unfortunately, remains a strong personality and it is not
possible to keep him subdued. This side of Gascoigne may yet deny us all
the chance to applaud the work of a supreme talent and anyone who feels
this assessment is made in haste should analyse fully the early signs.
The English internationalist played against Steaua Bucharest in his
Ibrox debut on Saturday and, while many of Rangers' supporters might
have loved it, when he pretended to play a flute, the more reasoned
among them cringed. Football has suffered too long from ancient
bigotries and the game doesn't need Gascoigne or anyone else to fuel the
hatred.
Besides, what does he know about these matters? Who exactly does he
think he is that he can come to Glasgow from England via Rome -- where
his mime would have gone down as heavily as John Burridge trying to
smother a shot, had the Italians been lacking enough culture to
understand his actions -- and behave like someone left behind from the
twelfth of July?
Good laugh, was it? Just a little innocent fun? Don't think so. It was
the inane behaviour of a suspect temperament and fragile mentality.
Gascoigne side-stepped questions about his antics after yesterday's
win against Sampdoria, but he should try telling the supporters of
Glasgow's other clubs, or the tens of thousands of decent people who go
to football, that he meant nothing by his flute-playing. I wonder if he
is even aware of the outrage his actions caused in other parts of the
country.
Might he have any inclination of what could happen were he to repeat
his little wheeze in an Old Firm game? He should be told, but I'm sure
his manager will be pointing out a few home truths.
Gascoigne's behaviour was neither funny nor innocent and all he did
was demean his club and himself.
David Murray and Walter Smith are not spending millions to bring in
circus acts. They are striving to put the best footballers they can find
on the pitch and when kitted out for work they expect these employees to
perform with the ball and win trophies. When they are in front of the
public they must behave accordingly. The game doesn't need any more
buffoons.
Apart from his feeble and potentially damaging attempt to play for the
crowd, Gascoigne also continued to snarl and snap at opponents. Even
when he was not involved in challenges he felt compelled to get himself
involved and that will not do when the ball starts rolling in earnest.
It is almost as though he believes himself to be above the rules
within which everyone else must play, and that attitude will cause him
nothing other than trouble. Gazza must be curbed if the real footballer
is to enjoy his time remaining in the game.
His other side is not needed to win over supporters, because all he
has to do is play. That is something he does better than just about
everybody else in Scottish football, and that is all he requires to
become lauded by more than Rangers fans.
He has touches and moves which no-one can teach, and in full flight he
is an absolute joy to watch. He offers the game so much, and God knows
we desperately need a player like him to set our pulses racing and bring
us to our feet. But no-one can say with any certainty whether or not we
will be allowed to enjoy him to the full.
None of us can say who we will get. Will it be Gascoigne or will it be
Gazza?
Hopefully, it will be Gascoigne. We need him, but only him -- and not
the child who hides waiting to prance to the fore.

MANCHESTER United will probably hear next week what action, if any,
they and banned striker Eric Cantona will face from the English Football
Association for the Frenchman's appearance in a midweek practice match.
FA spokesman Mike Parry confirmed yesterday that the association had
written to United, demanding an explanation for Cantona's run-out in a
3-2 win over Rochdale at United's Cliff training headquarters.
''We became aware of the fact that Eric Cantona had played in a form
of match against Rochdale through newspaper reports and have written to
Manchester United asking for their observations,'' Parry said. ''It only
happened in midweek, so we would not expect to hear back from them until
early next week.
''One of the reasons we have written to them is to ask them under what
sort of conditions the match was played. The ban imposed on Eric Cantona
said that he should be suspended from all football activities until the
beginning of October, so we assume Manchester United have a plausible
explanation. We'd just like to know what it is to clear the matter up.''
Cantona was suspended from all football up to and including September
30 as a result of his kung-fu kick on a Crystal Palace fan in January.

DEFENDING champion Graeme Maxwell and Joyce Lindores, the winner two
years ago, claimed the men's and women's singles titles and struck a
double blow for south of Scotland bowlers in the Glasgow District
Council Champion of Champions event at Knightswood.
Maxwell qualified for the final with a five out of five record from
his group matches and in the final he defeated Donnie MacDonald, from
the Glasgow Gas Club, 21-19.
MacDonald trailed 17-11 after 18 ends, but then picked up eight shots
over the next three ends. However, Maxwell bounced back with successive
doubles to take the title.
Lindores, who lost her women's title last year to Sarah Gourlay,
avenged that defeat with a 21-20 win over the title-holder in her
concluding section match and went on to take the crown with a 21-14 win
over Scottish international team-mate Frances Whyte.
In the men's pairs event, Steven Thomson and Jim Pringle from
Castlepark proved too strong for Graham Robertson and Willie Stott.

PAULINE Robertson, captain of the Great Britain women's hockey team,
will have the company of four of her international colleagues -- Susan
MacDonald, Rhona Simpson, Diane Renilson, and Susan Fraser -- when Great
Britain embark on a tour to Australia next month.
However, the two other Scots in the training squad -- goalkeeper
Tracey Robb, and right-back Janet Jack -- will have every right to be
aggrieved at being overlooked, particularly when they see who has taken
their places.
Robb, Scotland's No.1, had to give way to England's No.2 net-minder,
Hillary Rose. She was used only sparingly in the European Nations Cup in
Amsterdam by the English coach. Jack, meanwhile has lost out to Lucy
Youngs, who wasn't even in the England squad for the Nations Cup.

THE smile is back on the face of Monica Seles. The American tennis
heroine made her long-awaited return to the court on Saturday when she
played an exhibition match with Martina Navratilova in Atlantic City,
New Jersey.
Seles has been a virtual recluse since she was stabbed by a fan during
a tournament in 1993. She clearly enjoyed her comeback match and
thrilled her fans with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over the legend of the court.
Afterwards, Navratilova said her opponent had played as if she had
never been away from the game. Seles, herself, admitted that she had
missed the cheers of the crowd. Now it remains to be seen whether or not
she will return to tournament play.

IVAN Pedroso, who on Saturday improved the world long-jump record by a
centimetre, to 8.96 metres (29ft 4[3/4]in), is confident he can take the
event beyond nine metres, and also the 30ft mark (9.14m).
Since Jesse Owens broke the record at Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1935,
the world mark had been held by only four other athletes -- Ralph Boston
(USA), Igor Ter-Ovanesyan (USSR), Bob Beamon (USA), and Mike Powell
(USA). Owen's record survived 25 years and Beamon's nearly 21. The
British record of 8.23m has stood to Lynn Davies since 1968.
Just as with Beamon's freak leap at the Mexico Olympics, controversy
will cloud Perdosa's mark, refuelling the debate about altitude
performances. Sestriere lies at 2035 metres. Thin air causes less
resistance and is estimated to be worth perhaps 30cm. And in Italy, as
in Mexico in 1968, there was debate over the wind speed.
Officials reported two people standing in front of the gauge on the
Cuban's record jump, and TV replays could not disprove suggestions that
Pedrosa's foot fractionally fouled the take-off board. The wind reading
was minus 1.2 metres per second. For most of the meeting it was over the
permissible limit of 2.00.
Jon Edwards was nowhere near his world triple-jump mark, though
winning with 7.58m.
Pedrosa switched to long jumping at the age of 12, when cross-country,
his first love, caused him unbearable foot pain. He cleared 8.06m at 18,
and the same year was placed fourth at the World Junior championships in
Bulgaria. He was also fourth in the Barcelona Olympics.
But it seems as though Carl Lewis, who would have been one of his
biggest world-title rivals, may not be in Sweden to challenge him.
Eight-times Olympic champion Lewis cramped a hamstring while competing
in Colorado on Saturday, though he won the competition with a
wind-assisted 8.12m.

ROB Wainright has confirmed that an Army job is being created for him
in Edinburgh, and it is likely that he will be moving to the capital in
October to resume his rugby career north of the Border.
The future Scottish captain also said that he has been having detailed
conversations with Gavin Hastings about joining Watsonians.
''When I get to Edinburgh I will have a big decision to make as to who
I join,'' said Wainwright in Durban yesterday. ''I either go back to
Edinburgh Accies, a club that was very good to me, or I go to
Watsonians. I have been putting a lot of thought into it and I have been
talking to Gavin about it.
''The new Army post is being made, and I think I'll get the job.
Whatever, I won't be in Scotland before October.''
Wainwright, a doctor in the Army, is currently on unpaid leave.
West of Scotland have resumed normal service -- Sandy Service, that
is. The former Glasgow scrum half has agreed to coach the club's backs
this season, with Gordon MacPherson looking after the forwards.
MacPherson, it will be remembered, played for Otago against the Lions
in 1993. Otago whacked the Lions, too. That could be some partnership, I
can tell you.
I seem to have rubbed many in Glasgow up the wrong way. George
Breckenridge assured me at the touch-rugby tournament on Saturday that
all was well at GHK, and that I wasn't too popular ''over the fence'' at
Old Anniesland. Frankly, chaps, I don't give a monkey's.
Likewise with all that has been written about the three Lisbon Cubs,
the Craig boys, leaving West for Hawick. Some, like Service, feel that
the pessimism shrouding west-coast rugby is misplaced, especially at his
club.
''We are lucky at West that a number of good players have joined,
which will hopefully give us more strength in depth,'' he says. ''We are
also lucky to have a number of good youngsters, some just out of school,
especially Gordon and Allan Bulloch.''
Service believes the youngsters hold the key to his club's future.
''They have the skills and the right attitude to make the difficult
transition from schools rugby to club rugby,'' he says. ''Not for them
standing around waiting to receive a pass -- instead they go and look
for work. There are a large number of very talented school players who
do not make the grade at club level.
''As a coach, it is sometimes difficult to handle a player who showed
huge potential at school, but after a few years hasn't fulfilled that
potential. They seem to listen but not hear, because their egos get in
the way.''
I make no comment as to whether that was aimed at the Craig boys or
not.
Service is very much his own man. He has fallen out with the Glasgow
committee in the past -- hey, haven't we all? -- but there is no denying
that here is a man who is in the mould of the Border player coming back
to give his club the benefit of his time.
''Up to now I've only really coached at representative level, and
there's a marked difference between club and district rugby,'' he says.
''At the top level the players turn up on time, and they are skilful,
fit, and keen to do well. At club level the coaches have to motivate
players to turn up for training on time, train hard, and as well as the
coaching there is an element of teaching. So, all in all, the job at
club level is far more difficult.
''Should we not be trying to make the ordinary club player into a good
club player by increasing his effectiveness by, say 20%, rather than
chasing rainbows? Remember, a team needs its workers to allow the stars
to shine brightly.''
He's right. West of Scotland have been one of those clubs over the
years who have done well without ever having a distinct school-feeder
system. Their future success depends on the players they have, their
coaches, and how they use them. Sandy Service and Gordon Macpherson are
putting themselves on the line for their club. That's a good thing to
do.

STEWARDS' Cup winning trainer John White reflected yesterday on a
excellent week of results for his Wendover stable, but still was
concerned about his future at Russell Farm, Buckinghamshire.
Despite a prolific run of recent winners on the Flat as well as in the
National Hunt code, the tenancy at his Wendover stables is in the hands
of his solicitors after a disagreement with the landlord.
The land owner, based off-shore, is reportedly keen to cut down the
level of his investment in racing, whilst White, understandably, wants
to secure some stablility at his yard.
''Our solicitor is trying to negotiate a longer lease and it is far
from sorted out yet,'' said the trainer.
Legal wrangles apart, White has just enjoyed his finest week of the
Flat season.
He saddled Imad and Shikari's Son to take the Country Club Hotels
Goodwood Handicap and the Stewards' Cup respectively at Glorious
Goodwood, where he upheld his 100% course record with his fifth winner
at the Sussex track.
On top of those high-profile successes, White saddled two winners over
jumps, at Stratford on Wednesday, and doubled up with two at Newton
Abbot atb the weekend.
''It has been a super week but we needed one like that I can tell
you,'' observed White.
Commenting on his choice to go to Newton Abbot on Saturday in
preference to saddling 40-1 shot Shikari's Son for the Stewards' Cup,
White said: ''I had come down on holiday here and they don't need me to
win do they?
''It was tremendous but we didn't really fancy him to win. I mean he
had been beaten in a claimer the week before and that wasn't part of
some plot I assure you -- I wish it had been.
''These sprinters take each other on week in week out but this was his
turn.'' he added.

<HEADLINE>Brokers cast wide net to recruit new clients.    Chase on for small investors</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KEN CLAY</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THERE is no guarantee that this will happen, but if you let your
imagination wander a bit you could foresee the day when stockbrokers
will offer you a free pen if you sign up as a client, followed by a free
travel alarm clock when you do your first deal with them and they earn
their first commission payment from you. It happens in insurance, so why
not stockbroking.
Big, small and medium stockbroking firms are going hard out to recruit
the nine or 10 million investors still reckoned to be holding shares.
It makes you wonder who was kidding whom back in the neanderthal days
before Big Bang when brokers would put on worried looks and tell you
that it was just not economic to deal for the small investor.
Except for a few very big and haughty ones, they all would deal for
the small investor, of course, while maintaining at the same time that
the small bargains cost them just as much, well almost as much, as the
very large ones so the small commission deal could be seen as a
loss-maker.
When the rule book with its sliding scale of commission charges
applied by all firms was swept away and the market moved rapidly from
physical dealing between broker and jobber on the trading floor to being
a market increasingly dominated by telephone wires and ever more
sophisticated electronics things changed.
Having dematerialised the trading floor, the powers that be are now
busily phasing out as much paper as possible. That extends to share
certificates, which will eventually nearly all be replaced by electronic
notations on a Registrar's computer.
The electronic revolution, which is still going on, has cost tens of
millions of pounds. But dealing charges have never been more
competitive.
The competition operates particularly favourably for the small
investor who knows what he wants to do. While there is no formal
agreement, of course, the traditional brokers tend to charge around
1.65% of the transaction cost as their commission.
The execution-only brokers who have sprung up after Big Bang usually
start their scales of charges at 1%. The most eye-catching part of the
competition comes in the stated ''minimum charge.'' That will depend
partly on the type of firm and partly on the type of deal. One broker
who still has a minimum charge of #40 if you talk to him on the
telephone, charges a minimum of only #10 for a postal deal.
Another will charge only #5 for a #500 sale of a privatisation stock
if the certificate is posted to him. The Share Centre, as another
example, has a minimum of #7.50 for privatisation and Footsie stocks.
Churning out deals for small investors to sell privatisation shares,
still a pretty active business, is all very well, but what the firms
really want is a client who keeps on dealing. Those with long memories
may recall the days when brokers would charge only one commission if you
both sold and reinvested in the same ''account.''
That concession was dropped, although it could be argued it was a
modest incentive to keep your money in the market rather than take it
out and do something silly like spending it. Barclays Stockbrokers are
reviving the idea ahnd say if you sell and reinvest within their PEP you
will pay only one commission. They also offer Air Miles.
Encouragement to deal comes in a variety of ways. Stockbroking firms
attached to banks such as Barclays and NatWest offer advice as well as
execution-only specialists such as ShareLink also have on offer services
which help investors make up their minds about companies to buy or sell.
While some broking firms worry about whether they have a future,
others see the market as growing. Paul Williams, dealing director of
NatWest Stockbrokers for instance, sees both execution-only and
execution with advice as growth markets. He believes investors are
getting more knowledgeable and more willing and able to make up their
minds which companies are good to buy.
Barclays Stockholders, who have their operations centre in Glasgow,
carry out back-office work for front-office firms such as building
societies and small broking firms who specialise in giving advice. They
and others with similar services argue it keeps costs down and helps the
small firms survive.
Fees are important. APCIMS, the trade association for broking firm, is
doingits best to ensure what it sees as fair charges for the small
investor when the computerised settlement and registration system CREST
comes into operation next year. They argue that it would be unfair to
make a #500 deal pay the same as one involving #5m. Let's hope they win
their case.
Advice is even more important. So, unless you prefer to rely on your
own ideas, make sure that you will be getting money-making suggestions
from your broker rather than the cheapest commission deal. Private
clients are reckoned to have paid about a third of commissions earned by
brokers doing deals in UK shares last year so they deserve to be looked
after.

IT has been a tough first year for Robert McKellar, but despite having
to walk with the aid of crutches at Hamilton Park on Saturday evening,
the Lesmahagow trainer was in happy mood.
Suedoro, his five-year-old mare, had just won the six-furlong Horsell
Anitec Fillies Handicap to give McKellar his second success of the
season. Just more than a month ago on the same track, she dead-heated
with Birchwood Sun, McKellar having to wait 30 minutes as the judge
studied photographs.
However, this time there was no doubt about Suedoro's victory. She
shot into the lead from the stalls, and jockey Joe Fanning kept her in
front all the way to the line, holding off the challenge of Tutu
Sixtysix by a length and threequarters.
Since her first win, Suedoro has been missing the break. At Ayr's
recent Sunday meeting, she finished last of 13 in the race won by
Flashy's Son. ''Since then I've freshened her up by working her in
blinkers,'' the trainer explained.
She was one of three runners in the race from the McKellar yard. Glow
of Hope was in the prize money, finishing fourth, but Hutchie's Lady was
last.
McKellar, snapped a tendon while working his string on the gallops
above his Lanarkshire yard, and has his right leg in plaster. ''It's
been a tough first year,'' he said, ''but now I've got two winners under
my belt and I feel I can go on to greater things. When you don't have
winners people are willing to knock you, but my owners have been
supportive.''
McKellar, a former jump jockey and head lad at Cree Lodge, has 14
horses in training.
Jockey Tyrone Williams had a great start to the meeting with a 21-1
double on Rock Foundation (2-1), in the opener, and Three Arch Bridge
(6-1), in the next.

CHAOS ruled at Chester yesterday when the gates in the centre of the
track were closed early because of the vast amount of traffic and road
chaos around the course, caused by punters pouring in for the first
Sunday race meeting staged at Chester.
Sheikh Mohammed's two runners fought out the finish of the opener,
with Lipizzaner, the 6-4 favourite, just edging out Hedera close home.
Then 30 minutes later, Bonarelli made it a double for the leading
owner when running away from Ramooz in the maiden race.
''Make no mistake, this horse has a touch of class,'' said Jimmy
Scott, trainer Michael Stoute's travelling head lad. ''He's taken time
to get the hang of things but will be a decent horse next year.''
At the day's other meeting, Yarob opened his account in fine style at
Lingfield, making all to score by four lengths from Prime Partner in the
first race on the card.
Richard Hills was never in any danger on Tom Jones's chestnut, a 5-2
shot, and had the luxury of long looks over a shoulder at the rest
during the final furlong. ''That is the sixth two-year-old winner for
the stable from seven juvenile runners,'' said Hills. ''We have a nice
bunch this year.

FRANKIE Dettori, successful in the Group 1 Zuchtrennen race at Munich
yesterday on the colt, Germany, can make a winning start to another busy
week on Croft Pool in the Armstrong Cup event at Ripon this afternoon.
The champion jockey has ridden non-stop for the past 11 days, with a
trip across the Atlantic to partner American Derby runner-up Torrential
only adding to his hectic schedule.
Nor is there likely to be any let-up in his routine for a while, with
another packed programme of racing in Britain this week followed by a
probable trip to Deauville next weekend.
But Dettori's power-packed finish to land the King George VI And Queen
Elizabeth Diamond Stakes on Lammtarra, not to mention a hatful of
winners at Glorious Goodwood as well as his German success, showed he
has lost none of his enthusiasm.
And he should make yet another visit to the winner's enclosure after
today's #12,750 race. He rides Croft Pool for the first time since
partnering him to victory at Southwell on New Year's Day.
No other rider has managed to conjure a win out of the quirky
four-year-old since, though he has run numerous good races and been
runner-up on five occasions.
Wilie Ryan looked to have done the trick when he pushed the gelding
into a clear lead a furlong out at Nottingham last Monday, only to be
collared close home and beaten a neck.
Dettori's tally of more than 150 winners already this year shows he
can get the best out of the most difficult rides, and he looks to have
every chance of success on Croft Pool, who races off the same mark as at
Nottingham.
Mister Fire Eyes is worth taking a chance on in the Tommy Shedden
Challenge Trophy now that Clive Brittain's stable has hit peak form.
Brittain landed good prizes at Goodwood with Sayyedati and Secret Aly,
and saw several others run big races in defeat, so there is no doubt
that his string is firing on all cylinders. Therefore it would be no
surprise to see Mister Fire Eyes return to his best today.
The gelding improved into a useful handicapper in the spring and
scored most impressively at Doncaster's opening turf fixture. His
failure to win since then must be a disappointment to connections.
It leaves him now very well treated at the weights and sure to take a
deal of beating if back to anything like his early-season form.
* ANDRE Fabre captured the two Group races on yesterday's opening day
of Deauville's summer meeting, but the four-strong British raiding party
failed to make an impact.
Fabre's Smolensk took, Prix d'Astarte, while an hour later, Fabre sent
out a winner for Sheikh Mohammed when Affidavit, ridden by Thierry
Jarnet, in the Priz Berteux.
Pip Payne's Ya Malak was involved in a four-way photograph for the
Prix du Cercle. However, the camera revealed that he had finished fourth
behind Kerulen, while David Elsworth's Magic Galop needed the outing in
the two-year-old race.

THERE were strange goings on in the Ryden East League on Saturday,
with a freak result -- and a unique ordering-off of a bowler.
To describe the form of Watsonians as mercurial is a decided
understatement. Last weekend they pirated 264 runs off the Grange attack
to pull off a stunning victory. On Saturday, on their own patch, they
lasted just 16 overs against Corstorphine's Asim Butt and Shahid Saeed
as they were blown away for a miserable 41. Butt had six of them for 18
and Saeed the rest for 16, and the whole shooting match was over by four
o'clock.
Leaders Heriot's cruised serenely to yet another victory, this time at
home to Freuchie despite the absence of key trio Mike Allingham, Jim
Love, and Ian McKinlay. Steve Litster took the batting honours with 62
as the homesters posted a 200 target. Freuchie came nowhere near as
skipper Euan McIntyre (five for 26) and Shahid Aslam (four for 54)
routed them for 99.
Bryn Lockie was at his very best with 130 for Carlton at Falkland, but
the home side made a real fight of a daunting prospect and secured 10
invaluable points by topping the 200 mark in response.
That was bad news for Edinburgh Academicals, who were up against it on
a fiery home track against Grange. Stuart Moffat contributed 34 at the
top of the innings but only a late surge by Dave Brydon and Richard
Eglinton provided their bowlers with a reasonable total to bowl at.
Graham Hurlbatt did most damage with five for 38 off his marathon
26-over stint.
When Grange subsided to 48 for three, the home total of 131 began to
look ominously substantial, but powerful stroke play by Roddy Smith,
whose unbeaten 66 included 11 boundaries, swung the game around.
It was many happy returns of the day for Stenhousemuir's guest pro,
Peter Gardiner, at Barnton. The burley Australian had a couple of
seasons at The Tryst and is currently plying his trade in Lancashire
league cricket. Deputising for Iain Philip, he had a huge impact with
five Royal High wickets, followed by a knock of 70 to secure the points.
Iyaz Gul and Bob Thornton both passed 50 for High.
Home pro Manzoor Elahi was ordered out of the attack by the umpire for
persistently running down the wicket.

THERE was the air of a world heavyweight title fight around Shawholm
on Saturday. The prospect of Clydesdale, leaders of the DM Hall Western
Union, meeting their nearest challengers, Poloc, with boasting rights in
Glasgow's South Side was tantalising enough but, within the match
itself, there was an even more intriguing battle of individuals.
Sajid Ali probably comes in somewhere nearer bantamweight than
heavyweight, but he eventually came out on top against Clydesdale pro,
Aamir Hanif, whose debut season in the Union has seen him challenge
Poloc's diminutive Pakistani for the title of the league's master
batsman.
The visitors batted first and, as expected, Hanif began to direct
operations in the middle. He survived when he was in the 20s after
giving a sharp chance at cover, going on to a second-wicket stand of 126
with Rennie Keith, who made 58. Hanif continued before he was caught by
Ronnie McGregor off the bowling of Musaffa Mahmood for 108, an innings
of 111 balls which contained eight 4s and two 6s.
Mahmood's bewildering spin produced figures of six for 73, and some
careless shots in the closing overs meant Clydesdale had to settle for
230 for nine. In reply, Poloc were always ahead of the run rate, but
then with Sajid at the crease, that is almost guaranteed.
He combined with David James for a second-wicket stand of 78, then put
on 104 with his skipper, Brian Spence for the third.
Sajid struck two mighty 6s as well as fifteen 4s. An appeal for caught
behind when he was on 98 was adjudged not to have carried and, even when
he finally departed for 135, the home side had no difficulty passing
their target with two overs to spare.
West of Scotland leapfrogged third-placed Greenock with a surprisingly
easy win over the Glenpark men. Batting first, former skipper David
Duthie top-scored on 38 for Greenock, but his colleagues were out of
touch and the best they could manage was an unimpressive 142 for nine.
Mike Richardson took four for 34 as he returned to the sort of form
which brought him international honours in the recent past. West cruised
to as easy a 25-point haul as they are likely to get, passing their
target for the loss of just one wicket. Mark Harper finished unbeaten on
71 and Jon Williams was just four short of his half-century at the other
end.
Pakistani Test player, Asif Mujtaba, was the central figure of a tense
Ayrshire derby between Kilmarnock NK and Ayr. Mujtaba's 73 built the
foundation for his team's total of 182 and he was then equally effective
with the ball during the Ayr response.
With Bruce Patterson absent on Scotland duty, it was inevitable that
the main burden for scoring would lie with the Simpson brothers, David
and Alan. They did not disappoint, with 73 and 50 respectively, but
Mujtaba's tidy bowling figures of four for 40 slowed Ayr's progress. In
the end, the Cambusdoon side were left high and dry, six runs short of
Kilmarnock's score with just one wicket standing.
The clash of Paisley rivals Kelburne and Ferguslie at Whitehaugh
proved to be similarly inconclusive. The home side compiled a
respectable 199 for eight, but Ferguslie dug in grimly when it was their
turn to bat and frustrated their hosts.
Kiwi pro, Mike Pawson, was undefeated with 40 crucial runs, having
also taken four for 74. When stumps were drawn, so was the match, with
the visitors surviving reasonably comfortably on 113 for six.
In the battle for supremacy in Lanarkshire, Drumpellier easily saw off
the challenge of Uddingston at Langloan. The visitors could not cope
with Stevie Carr's bowling and he collected six for 36 as Uddingston
slumped to 149 all out.
With such a feeble total to chase, Drumpellier were never in serious
trouble. A tidy 58 from professional Saleem Sajjad and Alan Stevenson's
43 helped the home side to victory.

SCOTLAND'S rowing team at the Home International match, held at Cork
on Saturday, recorded two individual event victories in the men's match,
backed up by five second places in the rest of the programme.
The Aberdeen pair of Richard Harris and Drew Hendry took revenge over
the Thames Tradesmen crew, representing England, with a clear win. Two
weeks ago, they were just pipped by the Tradesmen pair for gold at the
British championships.
Stirling's Kevin Plank also improved on his British championships form
to win lightweight single sculls on Saturday. The Scottish men's coxed
four from St Andrew, Edinburgh, were second to England in their race,
and Scotland finished second overall in the men's match.
Fiona Freckleton, in the women's open single sculls, and the women's
pair of Alona Bruce and Nicola Robinson -- all Commonwealth bronze
medallists -- came second in their events, but Scotland's women finished
third-equal.
The junior men also could do no better than third in their match,
while the junior women, despite the crew from Nithsdale finishing second
in the eights category, were fourth overall in their match.

IN THE fuss surrounding the scratching from the J&amp;B Scottish Amateur
Golf Championship of Gordon Sherry and Stephen Gallacher, respectively
the British and European title-holders, and the readmission to the fold
of the once-banished David Robertson, the primacy of Hugh McKibbin, who
begins his defence at Southerness today, has tended to be overlooked.
A good defence might enhance McKibbin's attempt to gain one of the
last two places in the Britain and Ireland side for the Walker Cup match
in September.
The Troon Welbeck golfer has been done no immediate favours. His match
this afternoon is against Aberdour postman Stuart Meiklejohn, who was
reinstated after a brief professional career on the Tartan Tour.
Sherry and Gallacher apart, the other two Scottish Walker Cup team
members -- Barclay Howard, a semi-finalist last season, 23 years after
he first reached that stage, and Graham Rankin, the emergent force this
spring and summer -- are among the six remaining seeds.
The three others are Alan Reid, last year's beaten finalist, David
Downie, and Alan Turnbull. However, all but two of the players who
reached the last 16 at Renfrew 12 months ago are among the 256 entries.
The progress will be particularly watched of Wick's Roger Beames, a
semi-finalist in the British championship last month, and Inverallochy's
Steven Young, who added the Irish youths' title to his record third
successive Scottish Boys' championship.

SKIPPER George Salmond made a welcome return to form with a brilliant
half-century on Saturday to steer Scotland to victory over Denmark at
Linlithgow.
But the surprise triumph was not enough to stop the Danes retaining
the European Triangular title on run-rate.
The Scots needed to make 216 off 39 overs to overtake them, but
despite a sparkling start, it proved too high a target.
They settled for a straight victory, to make up for the sub-standard
display against Holland two days earlier.
Off-spinner Jimmy Govan grabbed three vital wickets to rip the heart
out of the Danish middle order. But skipper Soren Henriksen, formerly on
Lancashire's books, clattered a late, unbeaten 75 to boost his side's
final total to 215 for seven.
He was given stout support by wicketkeeper Mohammad Siddique, who hit
39.
Bruce Patterson and Iain Philip replied in dashing style until two
vital wickets fell in quick succession.
First, Patterson justifiably looked angry after having been given out,
caught behind off his thigh for 28. Then Mike Smith was run out for
five.
By then, the title was out of reach -- and it was left to Philip to
notch his 50 before spooning a catch to mid-on.
Then Salmond (54) and Greig Williamson (45 not out) gave the Scots the
compensation of winning their first match in the competition.
Coach Jim Love commented later: ''This was a much better all-round
performance. Although we didn't manage to win the competition, it was
important to get a victory under our belts.
''I was happy with the way we bowled and fielded, and Salmond and
Williamson ran well between the wickets.''
The Scotland squad to face Ireland in the annual three-day match in
Dublin next week will be announced today. Scoreboard:

DENMARK yesterday took revenge for Saturday's defeat at Linlithgow by
trouncing Scotland B by five wickets at Raeburn Place.
The Scots hit 204 for eight, with Aberdeenshire's Neil MacRae left
unbeaten on 59.
Earlier, openers Dougie Lockhart (47) and Bryn Lockie (43) had
provided an opening partnership of 90.
However, the Scottish attack had no answer to the power and timing of
Soren Nielsen, who blasted a brilliant 116 not out to guide the Danes
home with almost six overs to spare. Scores:
Scotland B 204 for eight (N MacRae 59 not out, D Lockhart 47, B Lockie
43; S Hansen three for 23), Denmark 208 for five (S Nielsen 116 n.o).
Denmark won by five wickets.

WOMEN'S IRISH OPEN
WORLD No.1 Laura Davies completed her demolition of the St Margaret's
course in Dublin, where she retained her title with a closing round of
68 in the Guardian Irish Holidays Open yesterday, writes Bill Johnson.
It was the thirty-seventh career victory for Davies, who took her
winnings for the year to #353,000 when her 25-under-par total of 267
left her 16 strokes clear of Asa Gottmo, from Sweden.
Any glimmer of hope the remainder of the field had was ruthlessly
extinguished by Davies on Saturday, when, despite a double bogey at the
twelfth, she added a 66 to her opening rounds of 67 and 66.
Now 20 under par on 199, a new tour record for 54 holes, Davies led by
13 strokes from Gottmo and Lancashire's Lora Fairclough.
Yesterday's round for Davies was almost a lap of honour. She birdied
each of the three par-5 holes on her way to the turn in 34, at which
stage she was 14 clear of both Gottmo and Fairclough. Davies continued
with another birdie at the sixteenth, then chipped in from the back of
the green at the seventeenth for an eagle 3, before taking three putts
for a solitary bogey at the last.
It was the young Swede who won the battle for second place. Gottmo's
previous best performance was thirteenth in Sweden two years ago, but
she made a birdie at the sixteenth to move clear of Fairclough.
It was a fourth win of the season for Davies, who beat by five strokes
the world-record score for women's professional golf, which she had
shared with Scotland's Dale Reid and Americans Nancy Lopez and Beth
Daniel. Her winning margin of 16 strokes beat, by five, the previous
best on the European tour.
Davies is quoted at evens to retain her Scottish title at Dalmahoy
this week.
Gillian Stewart was the best of the Scots when a closing 73 left her
sharing fifth place. Leading final scores (British or Irish unless
stated):
267 -- L Davies 67, 66, 66, 68 (#15,000).
283 -- A Gottmo (Sweden) 69, 74, 69, 71 (#10,150).
286 -- L Fairclough 68, 73, 71, 74 (#7,000).
288 -- J McGill (USA) 67, 74, 72, 75 (#5400).
289 -- S Waugh (Australia) 70, 76, 71, 72; M Koch (Germany) 70, 72,
73, 74; G Stewart 69, 73, 74, 73.
Other Scottish scores: 294 -- D Reid 74, 68, 77, 75. 295 -- J Forbes
70, 76, 76, 73. 298 -- M McKinlay 70, 75, 75, 78.
* GREAT Britain and Ireland lost the Vagliano Trophy to the Continent

SWEDEN'S Rickard Rydell closed the gap between himself and John
Cleland at the head of the BTCC points table by scoring a win and a
second place in the two rounds of the Auto Trader RAC British Touring
Car Championship held at Knockhill yesterday.
Rydell and his Volvo won the first of the day's races with ease, then
followed home Renault's Alain Menu in the second. Cleland could manage
no higher than fifth and sixth places respectively on home soil, to the
disappointment of the 25,000-plus record crowd.
The first race of the day was a Volvo benefit, but Rydell did not have
the trouble-free run that his testing and qualifying pace suggested he
would. The Swede made a bad start and slipped behind the cars of Menu
and Paul Radisich (Ford) on the opening lap.
The Swede was not slow in coming forward again, though, and outbraked
Kiwi Radisich into the Hairpin at the end of the second lap to take
second. It proved a costly manoeuvre for Radisich, as Tim Harvey (Volvo)
and Kelvin Burt in the second Ford followed Rydell through, demoting
Radisich to fifth.
Menu's tenure of the lead lasted until the fourteenth lap, when his
Renault Laguna was forced out with gearbox problems. That handed the
race on a plate to Rydell, who was tailed home by team-mate Harvey, with
Burt third.
The Total Cup privateers' battle was settled in Matt Neal's favour
after Robb Gravett stalled his Ford.
In round 17, Rydell again made a poor start, allowing Menu to steal
into a lead he was never to lose. Rydell chased him hard all the way,
finishing 2.86sec adrift.
Radisich held third nearly all the way, until a puncture forced his
retirement and handed third to Harvey.
Neal was again the Total Cup privateers' winner.
Cleland retains his overall lead over Rydell, but his advantage is cut
to 32 points.

TOP seed Andre Agassi took command in the second and third sets to
beat Pete Sampras in the final of the Canadian Open -- and win a
friendly wager with his rival for the world's top ranking.
Agassi defeated Sampras 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 to earn the #169,000 winners'
cheque and an extra $20 from his second-seeded rival at the Montreal
event.
''We had a little personal double-or-nothing bet on the match,''
Agassi explained after winning his 400th career match and fifth title of
the year.
''The first bet was I thought Todd Martin would post a victory in the
quarter-finals, but he went down.''
Agassi has now won the Canadian Open three times. He also took the
honours in 1994 and 1992 and credits last year's victory as the
beginning of his rise from twentieth to the top-ranked player in the
world.
This latest victory is his second consecutive ATP Tour title after
winning last week's event in Washington.
The two players, who battled for 1hr 53min before a sell-out crowd,
now have eight wins apiece in their career meetings.
But Agassi has won three of their four matches this year -- all after
having gone a set behind.
* CHILEAN qualifier Marcelo Rios won the Dutch Open in Amsterdam
yesterday, beating local hope Jan Siemerink 6-4, 7-5, 6-4.

AN 80-foot putt for an eagle 3 yesterday gave Brian Barnes the British
Seniors Open on the third hole of a sudden-death play-off from overnight
leader Bob Murphy.
Barnes and Murphy were tied at seven-under-par 281 after 72 holes,
with Barnes carding a final round two-under 70 to make up the one-stroke
lead the American held at the start of the round.
Murphy had the chance to win at the first extra hole, the seventeenth,
but missed a five-foot birdie putt after Barnes recovered from a drive
into rough for a par 5.
Both shot par 4s at the eighteenth, but back at the seventeenth,
Murphy found rough and Barnes made his winning putt. ''That was one of
the few putts in the last two days that I actually hit,'' said Barnes.
''From the front nine today, the way I putted, I thought I was locking
the door on any chance of winning. I'm still not happy with my putting,
but from tee to green I was very happy with the way I played.''
Former Scottish Ryder Cup player George Will had a hole in one with a
No.6 iron at the 159-yard third -- the seventeenth ace of his career. It
helped the London Golf Club pro to a third-round 74, but he finished
with an 83 to be 27 shots off the pace. Leading scores (British or Irish
unless stated, *denotes amateur):
281 -- B Barnes 67, 67, 77, 70; B Murphy (USA) 68, 69, 73, 71 (Barnes
won at the third extra hole and wins #58,330, Murphy #38,850).
282 -- J Morgan 71, 68, 75, 68; B Charles (New Zealand) 70, 73, 73, 66
(#19,705 each).
283 -- T Horton 78, 68, 67, 70; J Fourie (S Africa) 70, 71, 73, 69
(#13,545 each).
284 -- J A Jacobs (USA) 69, 71, 71, 73 (#10,500).

78, 74. 308 -- G Will 76, 75, 74, 83.
* HALE Irwin, seeking his first victory on the US Senior PGA Tour,
shot a nine-under-par 63 to take a five-shot lead on 129 after the
second round of the Ameritech Senior Open at Aurora, Illinois.
Joe Jimenez, aged 69, was tied for fourth place, eight shots back,
after he bettered his age by seven strokes and set a tournament record
with a 10-under 62. Jim Colbert, who shared the first-round lead with
Irwin and Bob Dickson, was tied with Kermit Zarley for second place on
134.
Tony Jacklin was on 147 after rounds of 74 and 73.
* GRAHAM Rankin, who will make his Walker Cup debut at Royal Portcawl
in six weeks' time, warmed up with victory in the McKinnon Wood Cup at
Cawder yesterday. Rankin carded an eight-under-par total of 134 to pip
fellow Walker Cup man Barclay Howard and Bellshill's Sam Cairns by two
strokes. Cairns's second-round six-under-par 65 set a new amateur course
record. Leading aggregates:
134 -- G Rankin (Palacerigg) 68, 66. 136 -- S Cairns (Bellshill) 71,
65; B Howard (Cochrane Castle) 66, 70. 142 -- A Waugh (Cawder) 69, 73.
143 -- J Paterson (Hamilton) 73, 70.
* CALLUM Dunan, of Milngavie, won the Mike Barron Memorial Trophy at
Airdrie yesterday after tieing on 140, two over par, with Robert Jenkins
of Crow Wood. He won with a better last round. Leading scores:
140 -- C Dunan (Milngavie) 72, 68; R Jenkins (Crow Wood) 68, 72. 141

WILLIE Sichel, the defending Scottish 100 kilometre champion, survived
a stitch at 40 miles and torrid conditions at Riccarton yesterday, but
had to settle for second behind the winner, City banker Stephen Moore,
who took the British title, being contested in Scotland for the first
time.
Only 32 of the 53 starters completed the distance in the Sri Chinmoy
event as temperatures soared into the seventies on the Heriot-Watt
University campus.
Moore's winning time, 7hr 17min 47secs, was more than half an hour
outside his best, but is the equivalent of two back to back three-hour
marathons, plus another 10 miles at the same pace.
Sichel, a 41-year-old Orcadian farmer who makes a living harvesting
Angora rabbit fur and manufacturing thermal clothing from their wool,
used his background as a graduate in physiology and biology to clock his
fastest time, 7-28-18, a remarkable achievement in the conditions.
''I try something different in each race,'' said Sichel, a former
Scottish table tennis internationalist. ''This time it was an
experimental amino acid supplement, developed by an Oxford university
research doctor. It blunts the psychological effects of fatigue.''
With just four miles left, Sichel was 2[1/2] minutes down on his Moray
clubmate, multi ultra world record breaker 51-year-old Donald Ritchie,
who cramped badly, finishing third.
Sichel is now on the brink of UK selection for the world
championships, to be staged in Holland in September, but the selectors
may prefer Ritchie's experience. Results:
1, S Moore (Hertford and Ware) 7-17-47; 2, W Sichel 7-28-18; 3, D
Ritchie 7-34-30 (both Moray). Women: 1, H Walker (Serpentine) 8-26-28
(course record; 2, I Clarke (Arbroath) 10-55-56. Veteran 60+: G Oliver
(100k Association) 8-51-44. Wheelchair: W Levick (100k Association)
9-09-34.
* THERE were red faces all round due to the late cancellation of a
prestigious #3000 road race at Musselburgh on Saturday.
Runners lured by the #500 first prize put up by the Scottish Sports
Aid Foundation were furious when they arrived to be told the race was
off due to lack of support.
''It was very badly organised and wasn't advertised in any athletics
publications,'' said one Ferranti AC member. ''No wonder the entry was
poor,''
The organisers even forgot to tell official starter Barry Craighead of
the cancellation. ''What a waste #3000 of sponsorship down the drain,''
he said.
Local secretary Ramsay Smith brushed aside enquiries. ''Ask the SSAF,
they organised it.'' But the foundation's director, George Bowmaker, to
whom entries were sent, was noticeable by his absence and was
unavailable for comment.
* STEPHAN Hayward, the Edinburgh AC shot-putter, responded to the
challenge of his first UK under-23 vest by adding 84 centimetres to his
previous best to take second in Saturday's international against France,
Italy and Spain in Narbonne.
Hayward, 21 yesterday, reached 16.88m, leaping to seventh in the
Scottish all-time senior lists as he helped Britain to second overall
behind the hosts.
The only winner among the nine Scots in the squad was Blackpool-based
800m woman Vicky Lawrence, who clocked 2min 06.07secs.
Doug Walker was second behind UK No.1 Owuso Dako in the 200m.
Edinburgh AC's Walker, despite a painful back, clocked 20.95sec to
Dako's 20.80. Walker helped the sprint relay squad -- three of whom will
represent Britain at the World Student Games -- to a comfortable
victory, and the Edinburgh student is confident he will be fit for his
club's Scottish league match next weekend.
* ONLY two Scots reached finals at the European Junior Championships
which concluded yesterday in Nyiregyhaza, Hungary. Edinburgh Woollen
Mill's Alison Curbishley clocked 54.67, a lifetime best, for seventh in
the 400m, while Des Roache (Clydesdale) recorded 3-47 to reach the 1500m
final, but was severely spiked and ended up in hospital.
Ross Baillie (Victoria Park) was eliminated, third in the slowest heat
of the 110m hurdles, running 14.73 into a -2.4 wind, and Charles
Robertson-Adams, also just 17, ran his best ever 400m hurdles, 52.84,
but was not fast enough to make the final. There was another lifetime
best from Pitreavie's Ally Donaldson. He clocked 1-50.2 to reach the
800m semis, but went out, clocking 1-51.16.

APPROPRIATELY for a new boat supported by a company specialising in
coach tours around the Highlands, Ian Cleaver's Melges 24, Highland
Heritage, took the scenic, roundabout route to success, winning the
opening race for Class 1 at Tennent's West Highland Yachting week
yesterday, the passage race from Crinan to Oban.
Cleaver's circular route paid a dividend, for any extra mileage sailed
linked together a crucial network of light breeze and optimum tidal
current.
Finishing to first gun by some three minutes over the 54ft Sovereign,
Highland Heritage won the class by a comprehensive seven minutes on
corrected time.
In Class 1 it was the three light-weight sportboats which dominated --
regatta team Scotland's Sigma 8, Metre Mr Pink, steered by last year's
overall winner Nicky Kirk, took second and Boyd Tunnock's Melges Tea
Cake a close third.
So light and fickle proved the intermittent breeze that the race was
halted around Easdale, just after half way, to give the 173 boats an
equal chance of finishing.
Even so, around 20 boats opted to head for Oban early and abandon the
frustrating winds.
While the light north-westerly breeze drifted the eight classes clear
off Crinan, laterly it blew from most directions with the more solid
offshore north-westerly winning out in the end.
After Harvey's S &amp; S 34 Vigil is no stranger to the winners' arena and
comfortably triumphed in Class 2, while local hotelier Alan Milton
started perfectly in the Sigma 33 class in Pepsi.
Bill Cochrane's Shamrock Cavalier made the long trip round from
Burntisland worthwhile winning Class 4, while former Scottish Sonata
title winners John and Frazer Hunt won Class 5 handsomely in their
Sonata Diana. Results:
Race 1, Crinan to Oban: Class 1 -- 1, Highland Heritage (I Cleaver)
2hr 17min 52secs; 2, Mr Pink (N Kirk) 2-25.17; 3, Tea Cake 2-25:27.

1-54.35; 3, State O'Shassis (D R Henniker-Major) 1-57.22.

* THE Duke of Edinburgh and more than 3000 other yachtsmen had a
frustrating time at Cowes yesterday when the day's racing was cancelled
because of a lack of wind.
The Duke had started racing aboard Yeoman Twenty Eight in the Sigma 38
class, but after several hours of drifting about, the contest -- and all
the others scheduled for yesterday -- was scrapped.
Ex-King Constantine of Greece had joined the duke for the race.

BELGIAN Dick Norman blasted nine aces to land the #33,000 Northern
Electric Open title in Newcastle yesterday.
The 24-year-old, who beat Stefan Edberg at Wimbledon this year, took
just under an hour to brush aside South African David Nainkin in
straight sets.
It is Norman's first Challenger title and will lift him more than 20
places up the world rankings.
The power of Norman, who lost only eight points on his serve in the
whole match, totally overwhelmed his 24-year-old opponent as he raced to
a 6-1, 6-4 victory.
''It was much easier than I expected,'' said Norman. ''I served really
well but was also in control from the back of the court which is unusual
for me.
''It's my first Challenger title and feels great. It has confirmed I
can maintain a level of consistency to win tournaments.
''Before, I may have had a good game then a couple of bad games but
I've played very well all week.''
Los Angeles-based Nainkin, who beat Britons Danny Sapsford and Luke
Milligan on the way to the final, conceded afterwards: ''It was a very
bad day for me -- I never got into a groove and did not have a chance to
break his serve.
''I've played him a couple of times before and it has been much
closer, but I did not get into it today. It's a pity for the crowd I did
not win a few more games.''
* EAST Lothian Open championship at North Berwick: Men's singles -- B
Barnet (Edinburgh) beat G Fowler (Sunderland) 7-6, 6-3. Women's singles
-- J Murray (David Lloyd Club) beat A Anderson (Northumberland) 6-0,
6-0. Men's Doubles: Fowler and D Croll (Broughty Ferry) beat Barnet and
K Kordula (Dunfermline) 6-2, 6-3. Women's Doubles: Murray and G Mollison
(Waverley) beat J Oag (Blackhall) and F McMillan (Barnton Park) 6-1,
6-1. Mixed doubles: Croll and Murray beat M Milligan (Blackhall) and
Mollison 6-3, 6-2. Boys singles: 18 and under: J Thomson (Newcastle)
beat G Melville (Dunblane) 3-6, 6-0, 6-4. Girls singles 18 and under:
Anderson beat L Grossman (Blackhall) 6-1, 6-4.

With just her family, a few essentials, and a copy of Wind in the
Willows in tow, Patricia Fenn steps aboard for the man-made route to
exploring Britain's natural world
''THE quickest way to slow down,'' they claim, and it's true. The
slowing down is quick -- instantaneous in fact -- because slow is the
only pace that is possible for anything or anybody on the canals.
Even the herons posing on the bank take off from frozen immobility to
graceful curving flight with a slow-motion shrug of grey shoulders, as
if their mind is elsewhere. Between locks the minds of the narrowboats'
helmsmen are certainly elsewhere. They look up from a trance as other
boats pass, port to port, wave a casual greeting and relapse into vague
contemplation of glistening water, tall reeds, little flint cottages,
old stone bridges -- nothing remarkable except for the rarity of slowly
savouring a slice of old-fashioned Britain that is fast disappearing.
As Wind in the Willows' Ratty declares: ''Nothing seems to matter,
that's the charm of it.'' Suddenly the everyday problems cease to matter
because they belong to another world, another timescale. Bring your
mobile phone and TV on the waterways and you've missed the point. The
flash of an Intercity train, the hoot of a car, the whoosh of a plane
are anachronistic intrusions, inducing only pity for those forced to
suffer them, combined with complacent self congratulation for having
chosen an infinitely more agreeable mode of transport.
As prospective tenants of a narrow boat we arrived at a Berkhamsted
yard to board our vessel which featured lots of blonde wood and gingham
and a surprising amount of space for a narrow boat, with six berths, a
well-equipped kitchen area, two heads (if that term is as correct on the
canals as at sea) and a shower tray so deep that our two consumer
testers, Oliver aged eight and Amy, six, couldn't wait to bath in it.
They are at ideal ages to appreciate the canal lifestyle; any younger
and they might have been a worry, much older and boredom might have set
in, but for our weekend journey, dealing with the 15 locks on the Grand
Union Canal from Berkhamsted to Marsworth was the perfect answer to
inexhaustible youthful energy. We got a fine system going, divided into
two pairs of child and adult, plus skipper. Teams A and B, one each side
of the lock, would compete to get their massive wood gate moving first
(turn your back on them and push) grab windlass handle, apply to
antiquated rack and pinion at second gate, and wind like mad till
floodgates open or close, depending on uphill or downhill progress.
Those with dicky backs need not apply.
The satisfaction of mastering the uncomputerised but honest and
efficient piece of machinery and unleasing hundreds of tons of powerful
water, then sinking into spooky slimy-green depths or rising
majestically to another landscape beats computer games any day.
By Sunday we were experts, proudly proprietorial about our floating
home. Local families out for a stroll brought children and grandparents
down to watch the lock activity and Oliver took time off from more
strenuous duties to explain the procedure. The real pros, the year-round
river folk stayed put on their moorings. Having appropriated segments of
bank, planted wallflowers and daffodils and edged the beds with neat
white railings, they opened up their parasols, set up tables and chairs
and watched our amateur efforts with an indifference born of long
familiarity.
Reds and greens are the most popular colours for their boats, then
burgundy and navy blue, fresh glossy paint and brass swan neck tillers
glitter in the sunshine. With many a flourish and curlicue, totally
inappropriate names like Celtic Eagle and Comet are painted on their
sides.
Windows are fringed with zig-zag lace, hand-worked doyleys are de
rigueur at portholes, flowers spill out of traditionally painted
cauldrons and tubs on deck. There must be some affinity between canal
lovers and flowers. Every aperture and crevice along the way carries its
quota of blooms. At Lock 37, intriguingly named Cow Roast, a pretty
white iron gate is covered in clematis, antirrhinums sprout from mossy
cracks in ancient bridge arches, tin tubs, wheelbarrows and china
troughs are pressed back into service as floral containers.
The goodwill is ubiquitous, infectious and irresistible. No encounter
in lock or on towpath omits the greeting, the enquiries, the smiles. One
wonders was it always thus. For 200 years, since the landowners and mill
owners realised their vision of transporting by inland waterways the
wood, coal, wool on which was founded Britain's industrial fortunes,
have the users of their canals been so friendly? I suspect it is the
enforced gentle pace that results in spare time to greet strangers and
wish them the equivalent of ''have a nice day''. No point whatsoever in
competing, no point in even trying to hurry.
The distances covered on a heavily locked area are laughable. We
managed all of seven miles in our day and a half. Quality mattered more
than quantity. We did take time off to investigate the bird sanctuary at
Tring and pubs along the way; with a week or two to spare we could have
headed north, crossed the great Cosgrove Aqueduct, tackled one of the
longest tunnels in use at Blisworth, then headed south to visit Oxford,
or pressed on west all the way to Gloucester, or perhaps we might have
preferred the bleak fen lands to the east or, for a totally different
experience, chugged down to London to tie up in Little Venice or Camden
Lock. That would be worth trying next time. To quote Ratty again:
''Nice? It's the only thing; there is nothing -- absolutely nothing --
half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats on boats or
with boats.''

SINCE Castro began welcoming tourists, Cuba has been high on the list
for adventurous holidaymakers.
The largest of all the Caribbean isles, Cuba is a fertile land with a
wealth of colonial architecture dating back five centuries. Havana, the
exotic capital may be dusty and crumbling in places, but all is being
lovingly restored in original, soft pastel shades. Everywhere you look
there are gracious mansions and palaces with wrap-around balconies and
flowered courtyards. Charming squares with fountains lead off colonnaded
streets, idyllic gardens surround old buildings, wrought-iron lamps are
back in original places and the museums need exploring on a separate
holiday.
Cathedral Square with its fine Baroque Cathedral, is a meditative
place on weekdays, but come Saturdays everything changes. Musicians,
artists and craftsmen ply their wares and a crowd assembles to dance.
Music comes from car radios, cassettes and restaurants all day; there's
always a trio nearby ready to serenade you.
There are many high-grade, five-star hotels now, as well as simple
ones and since Cubans are affectionate people you'll get a warm welcome.
There are consumer shortages which don't affect tourists. Food is
varied and good in hotels, from plain to exotic cooking, and there's an
abundance of fruit.
Car hire is a good way to get about with a generous supply of petrol
for visitors. Organised tours are good and you can spread your holiday
in a few places this way.
Modern Havana has tree-lined streets, hotels, parks and a zoo, plus
the Museum of the Revolution housed in Battista's old palace. Behind is
the Granma Memorial, containing the small ''Granma'' boat in which
Castro, Che Guevara and others came from Mexico to triumph in 1956.
If you're a Hemingway fan, visit the Ambos Mundos (both worlds) hotel
in the capital, where he wrote For Whom The Bell Tolls. Out in Cojimar,
a pretty seaside town, you can see his farmhouse where he created The
Old Man and the Sea.
Cuba just isn't Havana. Go on to Pinar del Rio Province, where the
finest tobacco is grown, and superb brandy and liqueur produced. You
will drive through a magnificent landscape passing old Bohios on the
roadside, cottages in the style of the ancient Indians, the first
settlers in Cuba.
Trinidad is Cuba's second architectural gem. Its winding cobbled
strets are filled with grand old houses with doorways wide enough to
take in carriages.
Cienfuegos, (one hundred fires) is a delightful coastal town set on a
lovely curving bay with long waterfront and town centre of
pastel-coloured buildings, art galleries and old theatres.
When it comes to beaches Cuba can claim to be among the best with
around 120 all over, facing unpolluted seas. At Varadero, the largest
resort, there is a 12-mile glowing stretch of smooth sand which shelves
gently into a turquoise sea.
Most of all, there is a special Cuban sunset; unforgettable as you sip
your rum and lemon from the balcony.

HARVEST is just about here and there is breathless expectation in the
North-east. Those who are still in the dark ages or who have dairy
cattle which don't need to be fed economically, have made their silage
and a surprising number of people have good hay. There is nothing more
we can do about the crops short of prayer.
And we are praying. We are praying that Turriff Show, which starts
today, will not bring the usual thunder plumps. They look like the only
thing that stand between us and another fulsome expression of the Lord's
bounty. The winter barley is looking well.
In fact, it is looking uncommonly well. We were a bit late with some
of the straw shortener so there is quite a bit more straw and, though it
may be an illusion, it seems to me that there are more berries as well.
Brace yourself, banker!
In the meantime, all we can do is wait.
Mossie has been doing quite a lot of his waiting in the pub. Indeed,
he has been drinking left-handed because of a very painful arthritic
condition he's developed in his right arm.
I thought that might have been something to do with washing his roof
and outside walls with a 4000 pounds-per-square-inch pressure hose.
Two days perched on top of a Hi-mac left the house shining but the
whole area covered in broken slates, seedling trees, moss, dead leaves
and other rubbish of ages. The strawberries were uneatable, the patio
was filthy and the wife's car was a disgrace -- so was her humour.
She was not pleased.
''Well a body has to dae something to pass the time till hairst,'' he
said, ''and its nae that that's wrong with my arm. I've had it afore.
It's Tennant's elbow.''
A lot of us have been filling in time with a thing called Quin-ag.
That horrifying piece of advertising jargon denotes the farming
graduates effort in support of the University of Aberdeen's 500th
anniversary fund-raiser.
They're trying to raise #25m for a number of new projects including a
medical research building and a heritage centre, which would at one time
have been financed by the Government.
The farmer graduates have set ourselves to raise #250,000 for
strengthening the university's work in the countryside. There are to be
scholarships for country kids who find that the last #1000 makes it too
difficult to take up college courses.
There's to be assistance for research in rural studies, a bi-annual
conference and a donation to make sure that agriculture is given proper
weight in the new heritage centre.
It was to that end that we were all at the mart on Saturday morning;
for the Quin-ag roup.
Graduates had donated a pair of statues liberated from an English
Country House (#700), a racer bike (as new but that was some time ago
and it wasn't very good even then, #40), a Newsome gilt and enough to
feed her for a year (#290). A split new eight-tonne Marshall trailer
(#3,200), and a dying MF combined harvester (#950).
The breadwinner and I were operating at the other end of the market.
She bought 10 kilos of black pepper (#2). That made me a bit sad. I
cannot see us ever needing to buy pepper again.
That heap of pepper will trail around after us till death do us part.
I see my life stretching before me pursued by a huge bag of pepper.
And we got into a furious row over the pair of Guy Rogers chairs. For
a start we are no more than three years away from moving from this big
draughty farmhouse to a compact Death house, so what do we need with two
more chairs? There is more need for us to set up an antique shop and
cash some of what we have already.
But it wasn't that that annoyed me. She missed such an opportunity.
The chairs were knocked down at #80. In a fashion which will shock you
if you are an antique dealer but which is commonplace in agricultural
auctions, she was asked how many she wanted.
''Both, of course,'' she said, a little haughtily.
What a blunder! If she'd taken only one she would have got the other
for nothing. After all the value of half a matched pair is far lower
than half of both of them together.
If you don't understand that explanation you'll sympathise with the
Breadwinner. I couldn't get her to understand and she didn't see why she
should.
After-all, had I not landed with four sets of yellow oilskins? In
twenty years of farming I had worn out two sets. Did this mean I was
planning to farm on for another 40 years? And what about the six pairs
of dungarees.
Alright they were only #2 a pair but they were 48 inches round the
waist. Now that I've taken to the bike I'd be liable to fall out of them
and the safety man would throw a fit if he saw all that cloth flapping
around our power-drive shafts.
Anyway, it was a fund-raiser and grossed #14,000. Like everyone else I
believe I got the snatch of the day. Aberdeen University must have moles
in the fish-smoking industry for there were three handsome consignments
of smoked salmon and sea-trout.
All the lads were buying, at up to #24 a pound so I look forward to
some up-market barbeques. I got a five pound side for the price of
fillet steak. But I'll maybe have to keep that for the younger
Investment's wedding.

WHEN Robbie Williams left Take That, a telephone helpline was set up
to talk teenage girl fans through the trauma of it all. In the wake of
Gazza's arrival at Ibrox and the Gordan Petric saga, we hear Celtic FC
have introduced a similar hotline on which Fergus McCann gives personal
counselling to distraught Tims. The Sporting Diary managed to get access
to tapes of some calls.
Q. Rangers' success is affecting my home life. My wife says if I don't
snap out of this depression, she is going to leave me.
A. You need cheering up and so does your wife. Why not surprise her
with a bottle of Celtic champagne. We still have a few left, despite the
Scottish Cup celebrations in May. (You do remember, by the way, that we
did win the cup last season?) Or why not take your good lady for a
special meal at the Walfrid Restaurant at Celtic Park? A wee spot of
redecoration of the house is a sure-fire pick-me-up for the ladies. The
Celtic Shop has a new range of wallpaper, with matching curtains and
duvet covers.
Q. I heard a distressing rumour that fans seated in the highest parts
of the new stand at Parkhead will be able to see across the city to
Ibrox.
A. Only a very few seats have a view of the Rangers stadium. You will,
however, be able to hear the cheering quite clearly. No, there will be
no season-ticket refunds.
Q. Some of my best pals are Rangers supporters but now I keep thinking
they are talking about me and laughing behind my back. Am I getting
paranoid?
A. Funny, we were just discussing this very subject at the last Celtic
board meeting. On a personal basis, I have had to put up with this sort
of thing most of my life. Okay, I'm not the tallest of chaps and I was
brought up in Kilsyth. And what's wrong, pray tell, with wearing a tweed
skip bunnet? And why do people blame me for Celtic's lack of signing
success when it clearly all due to an international conspiracy among the
media, the SFA, FIFA, the freemasons, Rupert Murdoch, the Dalai Lama,
and Bill McMurdo.
Q. But when can we look forward to seeing some top names at Parkhead?
A. Basically, when Rangers come to play us. Meanwhile, we are
introducing an exciting new feature into the match programme. It is
called Fergus's Fantasy Football. From a long list of players, fans can
select the Celtic team they would have liked to see play in the hoops if
only I wasn't too miserable to meet their wage demands.
Q. Every time I pick up a newspaper or switch on the TV, it's good
news from Ibrox. I'm at the end of my tether. What do you suggest?
A. First of all, restrict your newspaper-reading to the Celtic View.
As for TV, I find watching the video of the 1967 European Cup final much
better than Scotsport or Sportscene these days. I can also recommend
sitting in a darkened room and chanting mantras of the names of great
Celtic players of the past. My favourite is Jimmy Johnstone to the tune
of Hare Krishna.
Q. What really happened to Celtic's bid to sign Gordan Petric from
Dundee United?
A. It was all going very well until Gordan and I discussed his
personal terms. I'll never forget it. He laughed and said: 'Look,
Fergus, I'm a Serb, not a serf.' But we haven't given up hope of signing
a big name from the former Yugoslavia. Our coaches are combing the
Croatian leagues and once we get our man, Celtic fans will be singing
'I'd rather be a Croat than a Serb . . .' It will make a pleasant change
from all this Tim-and-Proddy business.
Q. I can't sleep for worrying that Rangers are going to equal or
surpass Jock Stein's record of nine league flags in a row.
A. Nothing is certain in football but we foresee that Rangers will
shortly be joining a European Super League, leaving their reserves to
compete in the premier division. The Celtic board are entirely confident
that our team can see off the Ibrox second team.
Q. Can you assure me that the board have done everything in their
power to sign new players?
A. Yes, we have put up notices in job centres all over Europe inviting
applications from footballers. We are offering up to #10 an hour, which
is a pretty attractive rate compared to some of the other jobs on offer.
Q. I have been suffering from headaches and hot flushes. My doctor
says they are Celtic-related and there is nothing he can about it.
A. Your doctor has obviously not heard about the new range of pills we
have developed in conjunction with a major drug company. They are called
Bright Side tablets and are available without prescription from the
Celtic Shop. If they don't work, you can always pop along to Paisley and
buy some Temazepam.

W C Fields said: ''I went to
Philadelphia once: it was closed.''
Our lassies will most definitely
open it up
JENNY Pearson, the Scotland under-19s girls' lacrosse coach, is a very
determined lady and really quite forceful. She was putting the 16-strong
squad through their training session on Saturday, on a retina-shattering
sunny day hot enough for Simla, and telling them how to go about just
simply walking on to the field.
''Well, girls, think about how you're walking on and look as proud as
you jolly well should be. You are playing,'' she pronounced, ''for
Scotland.'' The girls practised looking proud, which was not hard for
them because they should be very proud indeed. They are going, this
Wednesday, to the United States, all 16 of them, and I am upset that I
am not going with them.
The World Championship is at Haverford College, Pennsylvania. It's
near Philadephia. I know what W C Fields said: ''I went to Philadelphia
once: it was closed.'' Next week our lassies and the other girls in the
tourney will most definitely open it up.
This will be the World Championships, for the World Cup is for the
seniors. Actually, it was in 1993 that the last Lacrosse World Cup was
held, in Edinburgh, in Riccarton itself, this rather magnificent campus
which belongs to Heriot-Watt University. In 1993, Scotland beat Japan --
where lacrosse is an incredibly growing sport -- and the next World Cup,
in 1997, will be held in . . . Japan. The sport is advancing there, but
perhaps not so in Scotland, though there are about 2000 Scots players
and probably 8000 in the UK as a whole, not counting boys and men, who
don't really count, though the game is being promoted among boys just
now.
Yet there are problems. Lacrosse is a sport which originated among the
North American Indians. That link still holds. After the Lockerbie
disaster, the Amer-Indians of the Sirrocou tribe, who lost members of
their lacrosse team in the tragedy, sent coaches across to Dumfrieshire,
and indeed one of the under-19 squad, young Amanda McKie, is the
recipient of such coaching in her native county. There has been a strong
bond between the USA and Dumfries since the dreadful air crash and it
has forged welcome links.
But problems remain with this most fluid of field sports. It is the
fastest game outside of ice hockey, as little Denis Mooney of Scottish
telly once discovered when he tried to film it. There are now boundaries
(at one time there were no lines at all), but they are still somewhat
inchoate, and the ball speeds through the air at a speed impossible for
a camera. With 12 girls a side, and them horribly fit, it is a difficult
game to film. But it is wonderful to watch.
The girls twist the sticks with nets on them every which way and that,
and the athleticism is superb. Don't forget that this is a non-contact
sport, and though there are those who are suggesting helmets and
padding, which would undeniably make contact more common, most lacrosse
people are resisting this. A great deal of the skill involved is
avoiding each other.
Yet another game I commend to Craig Brown for young potentials in
football: it will sharpen them up, believe me, though I doubt the lads
will ever match the girls' prowess, for this is one of those
hand-and-eye co-ordination games, like that business of bouncing two and
three tennis balls off walls, which girls inexplicably can do with ease
while boys flail around like drunk elephants.
But problems there are. The game remains played only in selective,
fee-paying girls schools. There are only five schools which operate it
and they are undeniably schools for the daughters of the better-off.
A great pity, for lacrosse should be enjoyed by every schoolgirl, not
just middle-class kids. This is not a class-consciousness argument on my
part -- sport cuts across, or should do, any social divide, and
certainly lacrosse harbours some of the nicest people in sport, or
anything else if it comes to that.
Certainly, the manager of Scotland's under-19s, Mairi Pollock, a
hard-working senior Sister at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, can hardly be
called posh, and coach Jenny, despite being once a P E teacher at the
august St George's School for Girls, a hotbed of this sport, and her now
a psychologist, has the dulcet tones of myself on a Friday night,
especially when she is telling the girls off. Not much softer, either,
when she is larding praise for a good move in training. And I never met
such affection between all of them.
But lacrosse is always in danger. The Sports Council grant isn't much
and the girls raised much of the considerable cost of their trip to
Philadelphia themselves.
There is also something much in the mind of the officials. Mairi
herself worried publicly to me that perhaps another famous school for
the sport, St Margaret's in Edinburgh, might drop lacrosse. A new P E
teacher appears there next term and she hasn't any experience of the
sport. It would be a great pity if it disappeared from the curriculum,
for Saint Meg's was once famous and prominent in this splendid game.
Certainly the great days when Dumf (Dunfermline College of Physical
Education, which was paradoxically based at Cramond near Edinburgh) was
awash with lacrosse girls, are over. It has not been a good move to base
physical education in the one college, Jordanhill, with mixed
facilities. For the men, of course, have come to overshadow the courses,
and very wrongly so.
In short, despite the astounding success of Scotland in this minority
sport, it goes much unrecognised. We have an entire team of girls
competing against England, and Wales, and Japan, Australia, the USA,
Canada, and exhibition matches to go, over a two-week period. They go
out there with many a disadvantage, not the least of them being, as
manager Mairi said, the heat. Some of the girls have had a little
heat-training at Strathclyde Univesity but heat will be a major factor.
There is an even bigger factor, though. The girls are going across to
enjoy themselves anyway, no matter what. Goalkeeper Lizzy Johnston --
who has just left St George's School and starts reading physics
(''surely too boring for a beautiful lassie like yourself,'' I told her)

It will be interesting to see how the pampered player from Italy
reacts to a hard pitch and some hard tackling on a freezing winter day
at one of our less salubrious grounds.
UNLESS you have been holidaying in Ulan Bator you will have heard the
news. Even then, it might have been broadcast on the Outer Mongolian
cable network. Gazza is now a Ranger.
Naturally his arrival has prompted waves of euphoria among the Ibrox
faithful. Many see the Clown Prince as the icing on an already sumptuous
cake. But the importance to the minutiae of his life, from where is he
to live, to the delivery of his high-powered car, to where he eats out,
is proving wearing, and the season hasn't even got under way yet.
Such is the interest in the #4.3m wonder-man from Lazio that it
wouldn't be surprising if someone was counting the number of times he
combs his peroxide locks each day.
The hordes are desperate to copy their new hero. One barber not far
from Ibrox says he has as many as 300 young men each week demanding the
shorn, blond cut which has become Gazza's Scottish trademark.
The streets of the city are awash with appropriate memorabilia and
there is a tide of merchandise featuring him, including T-shirts,
key-rings, baseball caps, and scarves. This is all good news for both
the club and the canny Geordie, who is said to be reaping a handsome cut
for the use of his name.
If the TV companies wanted to cut their costs they could always scrap
The High Road, move just a couple of miles along Loch Lomond, and
concentrate their efforts on The Gazza and Shezza Show.
Certainly all the ingredients are there. Boy meets girl. They fall in
love. Boy gets new job abroad. Girl pines. Boy gets hurt at work and
languishes in foreign country, far from his friends and relations. Girl
jets back and forward to see him. Boy and girl have frequent rows and
very public reconciliations. The tale takes a turn for the worse as boy
admits he was violent towards girl. She forgives him.
In the latest twist to the story-line, girl finds out she's pregnant.
Boy apparently has the wrong reaction to the news. She blurts all to a
tabloid newspaper. They make up again. Unlike the doomed BBC soap
Eldorado, this one is sure to run and run. One of the great remaining
mysteries is what girl and boy call the new baby. Certainly it must end
in zza. Glazza perhaps?
But apart from the badinage surrounding Gazza there is a serious side
to his arrival in Scotland. First and foremost, he is a footballer of
outstanding talent, who in his heyday, could brush past his opposition
like a ghost, showing equal measures of skill and courage.
Indeed his record since arriving at Ibrox is testament to his ability.
For a player who has made only a handful of appearances in the past two
years his performances have been stunning. But there has been a
downside.
Only last week a Danish referee warned him about his temper and his
behaviour on the park. He even warned that he would face a red card
early in his career in Scotland if he continued with his antics on the
field. Certainly, it seems his elbows have come much more into play.
It will be interesting to see how the pampered player from Italy
reacts to a hard pitch and some hard tackling on a freezing winter day
at one of our less salubrious grounds.
Gazza, rightly, is eager to endear himself to the Ibrox legions. But
on Saturday he showed a typical lack of sense when he pretended to play
the flute during the game against Steaua Bucharest.
While this may have gone down with the more rabid section of the
Rangers fans, his insensitivity and cheap behaviour will do little to
further the easing of sectarian tension in the Scottish game.
Football stars, especially those with such an impressionable
following, have a responsibility beyond the game, particularly in the
tinderbox of the premier division. None should go down a road which
promotes further division.
Gazza would be well advised to follow the example of his fellow
Rangers, including Brian Laudrup and Mark Hateley, who have fitted in to
Scottish football without resorting to petty posturing.
Only time will tell if he continues to be a wonder boy for Rangers.
But in the meantime, grow up, Gazza. Concentrate your efforts on the
park to playing the kind of football you're capable of, and be an
influence for good rather than tomfoolery during your stay in Scotland.
Otherwise it could all end in tears.

LEGIA Warsaw kicked off the new season in Poland with a 1-0 win over
Zaglebie Lubin -- without a single fan to witness their victory.
As a result of serious crowd violence following Legia's cup final
victory over GKS Katowice in June, Warsaw metropolitan governor Bohdan
Jastrzebski banned fans from attending the team's home matches.
Jastrzebski was quoted as saying he would lift the ban only for
Legia's European Cup match against IFK Gothenburg on August 9.
* BLACKBURN began their Scandinavian tour with a 3-1 victory over
Norway Under-21s in Oslo.
Goals from Ian Pearce, Alan Shearer and Jeff Kenna put Rovers three up
by the interval. After the break Rovers fielded several substitutes,
including Kevin Gallacher and Nicky Marker, who both missed most of last
season with injury.

HEARTS chairman Chris Robinson this morning requires to lift the
telephone and call the club's former chairman Wallace Mercer and local
property developer Jim Glass.
The situation at Tynecastle is now so farcical that he must avail
himself now of all the expertise and resources for the well-being of
Hearts.
The Edinburgh club's supporters have been more than understanding,
accepting that star player Alan McLaren had to be sold in order to
assist funding for stadium refurbishment.
They rallied round to a man when victory on the final day of the
season against Motherwell was required.
And this summer, they have purchased more than 4000 season tickets,
despite the adversity, which has provided crucial close-season revenue
that has eased cash-flow problems.
However, the past 10 days will go down as the most bizarre in the
Edinburgh club's 121-year history, and must open the door to positive
talks between the three principals in this mess.
Glass has produced a scheme -- which in time will release millions of
pounds for new players -- which he still wishes to present to Robinson.
The season-ticket buyers should not be denied an appraisal of his ideas.
Mercer has 13 years of experience in football at domestic and European
level, and despite being entrenched in litigation with Robinson and
co-owner Leslie Deans, would jump to assist.
The sacking of the highly respected Tommy McLean under the
constructive-dismissal procedure just three days after offering a
settlement to resign, without making provision for a replacement, lacks
the experience Mercer possesses.
There is no doubt that Sandy Clark's dismissal 13 months earlier,
followed strangely by McLean's rapid arrival, appeared at the time to be
the result of action of a much more pre-determined nature.
However, to follow the McLean departure with a week-long public
auction with Falkirk for Jim Jefferies and lose, having committed
#750,000 in salaries over five years to Jefferies and his assistant,
Billy Brown, is breathtaking. If the self-confessed Hearts fanatic,
whose lifetime ambition is to be manager of the Tynecastle club, will
not accept #100,000 a year to do the job, who will?
Raith Rovers' Jimmy Nicholl will find it difficult to accept the post
as a second choice, but former player David McCreery is keen and there
are senior players at the club who might provide a risky solution.
It will be almost impossible to offer Eamonn Bannon the position after
Robinson admitted last week he ''felt for Eamonn, in the
circumstances.'' The former Scotland player would have been a casualty
had Jefferies said ''yes''.
Robinson and Deans took over last June, genuinely insistent that the
best interests of the football club were paramount within their motives
for straying into an alien, specialised world. Without jeopardising
control, they should take on board Mercer and Glass now.
Hearts fans who held their breath on Saturday, before being dealt
another huge disappointment, should be certain of one thing. Mercer or
Glass would have delivered Jefferies.
Robinson, meanwhile, has not given up hope of winning over Jefferies.
In a statement last night he said: ''Mr Jefferies' decision on
Saturday to stay with Falkirk FC was reached in difficult emotional
circumstances. We understand no contract was signed and, therefore,
Heart of Midlothian FC would like Mr Jefferies to reconsider.''

Rangers 2, Sampdoria 0
WALTER Smith's side look in good shape for the rigours that lie ahead.
Even Sampdoria's manager Sven Goran Eriksson believes Rangers are much
better equipped now than they were last year when they fell at the
preliminary stage of the European Cup.
The consensus is that Rangers could be on the threshold of the kind of
success which has so far eluded them.
Time will tell, of course, but six goals for and none against in two
matches against Steaua Bucharest and Sampdoria in the final of the Ibrox
International Tournament is mighty powerful evidence of a team coming
together nicely.
Smith used almost all of his first-team squad over the weekend which
ended with Richard Gough holding aloft a trophy and believing it was
only the first of a few.
It would be hard to argue against the captain, especially when he is
surrounded by players of the calibre of Brian Laudrup, Paul Gascoigne,
Alan McLaren, and Gordan Petric, soon to be joined by Oleg Salenko.
''Rangers are a much better side today,'' said Eriksson whose team won
this competition at the start of last season. ''With the arrival of
Gascoigne they now have two players who can play fantasy football.
''They are now very quick to move from defence to attack with Laudrup
and Gascoigne and I would say Rangers are in good condition. They did
not play defensively but they are very organised, very compact and good
in counter attacks. I think they will have a good season.''
Smith made six changes from the team which thrashed Steaua 4-0 on
Saturday and still Rangers looked formidable. Stuart McCall, Petric,
Trevor Steven, Ian Durrant, Gordon Durie, and Alex Cleland all started
against the Italians and the blend was potent.
They surged forward causing problems for Walter Zenga and his defence
with Petric, making his debut for Rangers, appearing inside the
opposition's box to challenge for a header after only eight minutes.
Some of Rangers' moves were slick and exciting and most of them
involved Gascoigne and Laudrup, who between them will cause most teams
serious problems. They play by instinct which makes it almost impossible
to read their intentions or even keep tabs on their whereabouts.
The first goal, scored in 39 minutes, demonstrated admirably the point
Eriksson was anxious to make about Rangers' ability to break quickly, a
trait which is found in all of Europe's better teams. Andy Goram had
been under pressure from Enrico Chiesa and Roberto Mancini when the ball
was suddenly transported to the opposite end of the pitch where Steven
squared for Durie to side-foot into Zenga's net.
The Italians had to push forward more in the second half and they left
openings which Gascoigne -- Laudrup had been kept in at the break with
his place going to Ally McCoist -- tried to exploit, but Rangers had to
wait until 10 minutes from time to celebrate another goal.
Alexei Mikhailichenko, given the chance to play against his former
club when he was sent on as a replacement for Gascoigne, and Durie made
the opening and McCoist took advantage.
It was the striker's second goal of the tournament -- he scored the
fourth against the Romanian champions on Saturday -- and he is beginning
to look sharp again although, like Gascoigne, it might be several months
before anyone sees the best of him.
''I can get better with this team around me,'' Gascoigne said. ''I
feel right at home here already and the fans have taken to me. I feel
they are in my blood already.''
Smith's main problem will be deciding his best line-up and when you
consider he has 20 current and former internationalists at his disposal,
you wonder how he will keep all of them satisfied. Still, it is a
concern he more than happy to confront.
''At this time last season we were in a fairly chaotic condition
trying to decide which players were fit,'' he said. ''This time we have
no injuries and the overall standard of fitness is what has pleased me
most watching our warm-up games.''
Rangers will play against Clyde on Wednesday night and then finalise
their preparations for European competition with a match against Dundee
United at Tannadice on Friday. ''After that we should be set up for
Europe,'' Smith added.
RANGERS -- Goram, McCall, Cleland, Gough, McLaren, Petric, Steven,
Gascoigne, Durrant, Durie, Laudrup. Substitutes -- Brown, McCoist,
Thomson, Mikhailichenko, Moore.
SAMPDORIA -- Zenga, Balleri, Rossi, Franceschetti, Mannini, Seedorf,
Chiesa, Karembeu, Maniero, Mancini, Mihajilovic. Substitutes -- Sereni,
Ferri, Evani, Invernizzi, Bellucci.

THE future of Vale of Leven, one of Scotland's oldest soccer clubs, is
in jeopardy.
The club won the Scottish Cup three times in the 1870s, and along with
Celtic, Rangers, and Dumbarton were among the pioneers of football in
Scotland.
The club turned Junior earlier this century and won the Scottish
Junior Cup against Annbank United at Hampden Park in 1953.
But last night Angus Wallace, secretary of the Central League Club
which plays at Millburn Park, Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, said: ''Things
are looking pretty grim, so bad that we could go out of business
altogether.
''Officials appear to have lost interest in the club. We have no
sponsors for the new season, no money in the bank, and we are going to
find it difficult to pay players without any. The situation is extremely
worrying.''

Steaua Bucharest 3,
Tottenham Hotspur 2
GERRY Francis left Glasgow last night with much on his mind after
having watched Tottenham Hotspur struggle badly against Steaua
Bucharest, writes Jmes Traynor. The Romanian champions started slowly,
falling two goals behind, but once they perked up Spurs could not live
with them.
The London club were unable to track the movements and thought
processes of Steaua's captain Lacatus, Rosu, Militaru, and Vladoiu, and
the Romanians were well worth their win.
They were in much better form than the previous day, when they had
been trounced 4-0 by Rangers. On the Saturday, Steaua had looked almost
bored with the Ibrox International Tournament, but Spurs, who lost 2-0
to Sampdoria on day one, saw a different side.
Andy Turner's shot had been deflected into the net in 10 minutes and
then Darren Caskey's goal 15 minutes later gave Spurs what appeared to
be a commanding lead, but a goal in 35 minutes by Vladoiu signalled the
beginning of a comeback.
Lacatus set up the equaliser, which was scored by Vladoiu nine minutes
into the second half, and Militaru hit the winner in 62 minutes with
SCpurs in disarray.
It did not help when Gary Mabbutt took over from Sol Campbell in 66
minutes and played up front where he was out of place. A series of
injuries forced him to step forward out of position.
Ronnie Rosenthal, a substitute for Nick Barmby who was injured in a
collision with a linesman, was himself hurt. Also, Gerard McMahon
injured a knee.
STEAUA BUCHAREST -- Stelea, Csik, Panait, Dobos, Gilca, Prodan,
Lacatus, Militaru, Vladoiu, Ilie, Rosu. Substitutes -- Gherasim, Bucur,
Duna, Nagy, Filipuscu.
TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR -- Thorstevdt, Austin, Campbell, Kerslake,
Calderwood, Nethercott, Barnby, Dumitrescu, Caskey, McMahon, Turner.
Substitutes -- Rosenthal, Walker, Edinburgh, Mabbutt.
Referee -- H Dallas (Bonkle).

GERMAN GRAND PRIX
DAMON Hill's dream of lifting the world championship suffered another
major setback as he gifted Michael Schumacher a historic German Grand
Prix victory yesterday.
Hill climaxed the most controversial fortnight of his Formula One
career by sliding off the Hockenheim ring circuit, and last night he was
being blamed for the incident which handed his arch-rival an easy win.
Schumacher was able to hold off the challenge presented by Hill's
Williams Renault team-mate David Coulthard to give the 125,000 sell-out
crowd their first home winner.
The world champion extended his advantage in this year's title chase
to 21 points over Hill after having won by nearly six seconds from
Coulthard, with Gerhard Berger third and Benetton colleague Johnny
Herbert fourth.
Hill went into the weekend having been branded ''crazy'' and
''stupid'' after being blamed for the shunt which sent the
championship's top two crashing out of the British Grand Prix.
Team boss Frank Williams -- who said after yesterday's race: ''Damon
could and should have won'' -- had earlier had to deny branding him a
''prat'' for the British GP incident, then Formula One chief Bernie
Ecclestone called him an ''idiot'' for not admitting he was the guilty
party.
The 34-year-old had also been threatened with a lengthy suspension
with the only brightspot in the Silverstone inquest the birth of his
third child at home in Dublin.
Hill had seemingly shrugged off all the controversy by grabbing pole
position, which he confidently held on to as the drivers crossed the
finishing line for the first time.
But it all went horribly wrong as he entered the next corner, with the
back of the car suddenly giving way, sending him skidding across the
gravel into a wall of tyres.
Hill could not explain why his Williams Renault suddenly skidded on to
the gravel before crashing into a tyre wall.
''I am very shocked about what happened because I was comfortable in
the car,'' said Hill.
''I went into the corner and then the back of the car suddenly locked
up and I went off.
''I don't have an explanation for it. I was pushing hard, trying to
pull out an advantage but to me it felt as if the rear brakes came on a
bit harder than they had done before. I don't really know, but that's
what it felt like to me and it caught me out.''
However, his excuse left neutrals questioning whether it was another
self-inflicted blow as he simply made a mistake by trying to open up an
advantage over Schumacher. And Williams car designer Adrian Newey said:
''There was nothing wrong with the car.''
The home favourite needed no second chance, as he went on to win
comfortably after opting for a two-stop strategy to the one stop of
Coulthard.
''To be the first German to win the world championship and now the
first German to win his home race is just so fantastic, I can't believe
it,'' said Schumacher after having won for the fifth time this season
and fifteenth in his career.
''I couldn't believe it when I came round and saw Damon go off.
''But I knew that David, in the other Williams car, would push me very
hard and he did.''
Coulthard was content to claim a comfortable second place from Berger,
moving ahead of the Ferrari driver into fifth place overall but 33
points behind Schumacher.
''The six points are good for my confidence for the rest of the season
after having had such a bad start,'' said the Monaco-based Scot.
''To be on the podium two races running is good news. I have to carry
on doing it.''
Silverstone hero Herbert helped Benetton extend their lead in the
constructors' championship to 18 points -- the team have now won five of
the past six races -- with fourth place.
It was disappointment for the other Britons, with Eddie Irvine
suffering an electrical fault in his Jordan when lying sixth with less
than three laps left, while Mark Blundell was hit by engine problems in
the McLaren.
1, M Schumacher (Germany) Benetton-Renault, 1hr 22min 56.043sec,

Suzuki (Japan) Ligier Mugen Honda, 44. Fastest lap: Schumacher 1-48.824
(lap 22).

points; 2, Hill 35; 3, J Alesi (France) 32; 4, Herbert 25; 5, Coulthard

SPECULATION continues to grow that Lord Hanson is about to make his
valedictory acquisition through the agreed takeover of Eastern Group,
which is the second largest of the English electricity distribution
companies after Southern Electricity.
Rumours have circulated for weeks that the acquisitive group has been
''eyeing up'' Yorkshire Electricity, but so far nothing has
materialised.
A spokesman for Eastern refused to comment yesterday on reports that
talks have taken place between Hanson chief executive Derek Bonham and
Eastern's John Devaney.
Any offer would have to be around #2200m to succeed. Such a deal would
likely have to pass a Monopolies and Mergers Commission referral. The
MMC would be interested in guarantees from Hanson -- a company coming
from outside the industry -- over long-term customer supply on
competitive tariffs.
Eastern is one of the most ambitious of the regional electricity
companies with its plans to expand as an integrated energy business
judged, by it, to be of much greater importance than returning cash to
shareholders which has been the focus of other companies in the sector.
Northern has already done so as part of its defence against Trafalgar
House, which is currently mulling over the possibility of making a fresh
bid for the Newcastle-based company.
And South Western Electricity may be forced to offer a substantial
cash dividend to shareholders in its efforts to fend off the unwelcome
approach from Southern Electricity of the US unless it can find a white
knight who would undoubtedly charge heavily for any services rendered.
Eastern's electricity distribution accounted for more than 80% of
earnings last year although the target is to reduce that to under 55% by
the year 2000 with an increasing proportion coming from gas and
electricity trading and power generation using gas plants.
Its retail operation, Powerhouse, which is a joint venture with
Midlands and Southern is to be sold off.

SCOTT Hoch took a shopping trip to Holland to please his wife Sally --
and left Europe's finest golfers bankrupt. He returns to Orlando,
Florida, with a cheque for #108,330 in his pocket after having won the
Heineken Dutch Open in Hilversum yesterday.
Coming a week after fellow American John Daly's triumph in the Open at
St Andrews, it was not the news Europe's Ryder Cup captain Bernard
Gallacher had wanted with the September showdown at Oak Hill looming.
Hoch finished with a 65 and a total of 269, 15 under par, two clear of
Scotland's Sam Torrance and tour rookie Michael Jonzon, of Sweden, who
shared second spot. Derrick Cooper from Warrington birdied the last
holes to finish one further back.
Torrance also picked up a shot at the seventeenth and came to the last
needing a birdie to force a play-off. But his second shot found the
sand. He made the green, but could only two-putt.
Hoch's wife planted a kiss on his cheek in the clubhouse after he kept
his promise to her. He said: ''I ask her every year where she would like
to go in Europe. This time she wanted to see Amsterdam and I was happy
with that. To come to Holland where there is a strong European
contingent and beat them in Ryder Cup year makes me feel good.
''John Daly and I have the same management team and I was happy to
come here on his coat tails. But I won't be returning to St Andrews the
next time the Open is played there. It's a course where good shots don't
end up good shots but bad shots end up good shots.''
Consolation for Torrance is he now leads the European Tour Order of
Merit with #361,611, having overtaken Bernhard Langer (#359,749).
Overnight leader Torrance birdied the ninth to go 13 under, but bogeys
at the eleventh and thirteenth proved costly for the Scot, who came in
with a 70.
Jonzon, a graduate of the qualifying school last winter, moved into
the lead at 14 under, but the enormity of what was happening hit the
23-year-old Swede and he dropped shots at the fifteenth and sixteenth
only to birdie the last. A cheque for #56,450 secures his card for next
season, and he could not hide his delight after finishing with a 66.
Colin Montgomerie had to settle for equal seventh after starting with
a double bogey 6 to finish with a level-par 71.
Ian Woosnam, who has indicated he will not keep playing in the hope of
being selected, did not improve his chances, finishing joint sixteenth
after a 71. He stays eleventh in the standings, just outside the
selection zone.
Mark James finished on the same mark as Woosnam while another strong
candidate, David Gilford, missed the cut.
For Daly, it was obviously going to be one of those days when he
launched into his drive at the 437-yard opening hole. The ball vanished
into the distance -- and the right rough. He followed that by carving a
wedge across the fairway into trees then knocked the ball out into a
greenside bunker. It was hardly the mark of an 18-handicap golfer, never
mind the man who tamed St Andrews a week ago.

NICK Faldo yesterday pocketed #110,000 by winning the four-man
Canadian Skins Game in Woodbridge, Ontario. The former world No.1 beat
Ben Crenshaw, Fred Couples, and Nick Price as he collected #75,000 over
the last nine holes of yesterday's round.
Faldo, who has not played competitively in Canada since 1989, eagled
the par-5 twelfth -- where he nearly holed his No.3-wood second -- and
birdied the fourteenth.

FRED Funk recovered from a mid-round crisis to win the $1m Ideon New
England Classic by one stroke in Worcester, Massachusetts, yesterday.
Funk teed off with a four-stroke lead over Jim McGovern on a
delightful summer's day at Pleasant Valley. He started with a birdie,
but surrendered his advantage with four bogeys in nine holes mid-round.
After 13 holes, McGovern led by one, but he bogeyed the sixteenth and
seventeenth to hand the advantage back to Funk, who made no further
mistakes and birdied the final hole to clinch his second US Tour victory
despite a mediocre two-over-par 73 for 16-under 268. It was the fifth
successive year 268 has been the winning score here.
He collected $180,000 but remains well outside the top 10 on the
American Ryder Cup standings. Nobody who collected points in this event
has much chance of making the team. Final scores (Americans unless
stated):
268 -- F Funk 66, 63, 66, 73.
269 -- J McGovern 66, 66, 67, 70.
270 -- D Pooley 70, 64, 68, 68.
271 -- J Sindelar 69, 66, 70, 66; L Clements 67, 68, 69, 67; R Maltbie
68, 67, 69, 67; J Williamson 67, 67, 68, 69.
Other score: 280 -- D Feherty (N Ireland) 70, 68, 68, 74.

<HEADLINE>Health plans hit tender nerve. NEWSVIEW: Stonehaven fears it is a guinea-pig for controversial NHS reforms.</HEADLINE>

PERHAPS it is the North-east of Scotland's international reputation in
medical pioneering which has prompted the Government to use Grampian as
the testing ground for two extremely controversial changes in the way
the NHS is run.
There was a public outcry when it was announced that Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary, ''The People's Hospital'' built by public donations, was to
become Scotland's first NHS trust and, following wide consultation and a
huge body of opposition, the plan went ahead.
Now a number of fears are being expressed about the future of medical
care in Stonehaven, the Mearns town which the Government decided earlier
this year would be the first where open competition would be invited for
hospital services.
While some envisage a golden opportunity for Stonehaven to benefit by
gaining a hospital service tailored to the needs of the community,
others are extremely wary of what they see as a major step towards the
privatisation of the National Health Service.
The British Medical Association has condemned the move as ''a direct
threat to the national nature of the health service'' but Health
Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton insists this is not the case and
that the BMA's fears are unjustified by the facts.
The proposal which focuses on Stonehaven has caused concern throughout
the country since it emerged in April.
The intention to consider the future provision of services in
Stonehaven was announced by Grampian Healthcare, Scotland's largest NHS
trust, in its business plan published last year. Grampian Health Board
investigated all possible options, from the status quo to a new hospital
on a different site.
The hospital services involved are GP acute beds, NHS long-stay beds
for elderly people who require clinical care, and all the associated
services for people in North Kincardine and most of South Kincardine.
The working group which carried out the detailed research came down in
favour of disposing of Woodcot Hospital, built as a poor house more than
a century ago, and building a new hospital on the site of Arduthie
Hospital.
It was expected that the Scottish Office would simply rubber stamp
this recommendation, but instead the Scottish Office NHS Management
Executive told the health board to invite open competition.
Feelings within the community are mixed because, though there is
general agreement that new hospital facilities are badly needed and
there is no deep concern about private contractors being asked to tender
for building the hospital, there is considerable unrest that the
services are also out for open tender.
Grampian Health Board is consulting with local GPs and the local
health council has been contracted to consult with the community to
identify the services it would like and it has just completed phase one
of its three-phase programme before submitting its report in September.
It has held a series of meetings, deliberately kept small to ensure
everyone had the opportunity to speak. Dr Kim Walker, the chief officer,
said many at the meetings had indicated they would like to see things
such as out-patient services and complementary therapies.
Dr Walker said that at the meetings there had been a number of
concerns on common themes, including the fear that there would be an
inadequacy of long-stay beds.
''I think there is concern because it is moving into an unknown
area,'' she said. ''There have been capital projects financed privately
before but not services. There are genuine concerns about the quality
and standard of care. There is concern about the long-term prospects.
''One of the worries is that if the successful contractor doesn't make
a profit and pulls out two years down the road -- what happens? Will the
health board underwrite the services?
''There is also concern that there will be a private suite at one end
and an NHS one at the other and it will create a two-tier health
service. These questions need to be asked and answered.''
In early August 1500 questionnaires will be sent out at random based
on the results of the consultation, with one of the main aims being to
determine whether the points raised reflect the feelings of just a few
individuals or are widely held. The ''grey areas'' will be explored.
The final phase of the consultation will involve further meetings with
focused community groups for fine tuning and the local health council
will also be speaking to patients and staff at the hospitals before
submitting its final report.
Mrs Meg MacKenzie, chairman of Glenbervie and District Community
Association, said: ''I am not happy with the privatisation. However, I
don't feel we are going to be able to stop it. We were told when we went
to one of the consultation meetings that the Secretary of State had said
if we wanted the new hospital now it would have to be done with private
money. If we want the Government to pay for it we will have to wait a
long time. It is Hobson's choice. My feeling is that if it has to happen
it should be right.
''I want to know what will happen to the people in the hospitals, like
the elderly people in Woodcot. The answer we have been given is that
they will go back into the community -- but they have to establish the
care first. Care in the community is fine if you live in a caring
community. For the Government that means someone looking in on an old
buddy first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Let's make
sure these people are properly looked after.''
She said she understood those unfit for being cared for in the
community were guaranteed beds, although not necessarily in Stonehaven.
''These people have had to leave their homes. They shouldn't be forced
to leave their community as well,'' she said.
''They are in Woodcot because their families cannot cope with them.
Some of these people have been in Woodcot for 30 years.
''I am not scared of change. I am quite happy for a lovely new
hospital to be built in Stonehaven, but not at the expense of other
people. Not at the expense of existing services. These people are not
going to disappear overnight.
''They are tailoring the patients to suit the hospital and not the
hospital to suit the patients.''
Dr David Hartley, secretary of Newtonhill and Muchalls Community
Council, said there was a mix of feelings, with people glad that a new
hospital was going to be built but concerned that not only was the
building going out to private tender but also the clinical services.
''There is considerable unease about that and what it means for the
future of the services. I suppose the bottom line is that it has to make
money, which is the way things are going generally, and with some areas
of health activity more profitable than others there is concern that the
unprofitable ones may not get the same priority as others. There is
concern about geriatric services, for example.''
Mr John Towle, who runs a nursing home in Laurencekirk and is
currently building another in Stonehaven said: ''I have a completely
open mind. I think that word 'private' always causes concern.
''None of us has a crystal ball but if we can get a new hospital in
Stonehaven and improved services then that would be good.''
The retired assistant rector of Stonehaven's Mackie Academy, Mrs Helen
Rzechorzek, also believes the mention of the word ''private'' may have
led to misconceptions and fully supports the scheme because both Woodcot
and Arduthie are ''past their sell-by dates''. I have every confidence
that when things are looked at and tenders go out and decisions made we
shall have in Stonehaven an NHS hospital covering everything. We want
acute beds and we want beds for the elderly but we don't want all the
beds we have had in the past.
''Care in the community is taking care of those who don't require to
lie in bed all day and be nursed. We also want a maternity facility in
Stonehaven, or at least a post-natal facility, because we don't want all
our young people to be born Aberdonians.
''I think the fears arise out of a misconception. The word private
came into it and that has been elaborated on unnecessarily. When all
said and done everyone involved is in there to earn a living.
''The important thing is that the whole thing is in the care of the
health board and it is going to look at what is needed and not at what
it is going to cost primarily. It is the frills that can be dispensed
with.''
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton agrees. In a letter designed to allay
fears expressed by the BMA he said the fundamental characteristics of
the NHS were that patients' needs had to come first, the treatment
should be of the highest quality and delivered from as modern facilities
as possible and should be delivered free at the point of delivery to all
who require it. He said the proposals for Stonehaven were consistent
with these aims.

THE Falkirk-based bus body builder Walter Alexander is thought to be
in negotiations which could result in its being sold to a trade buyer
for around #30m, writes ANDREW WILSON.
In the middle of last month, chief executive Ian Galloway said that
there was no need for a public flotation as the company had no
requirement for additional funds as it had paid off all borrowings.
Alexander, which was established in 1924, was bought by management
under the lead of Mr Galloway in April 1992 for #7.4m from a financial
vehicle established two years earlier to acquire the interests of the
Alexander family for a total of #32m. Another activity, the Domnic
Hunter filtration business, was floated in March 1994.
Mr Galloway did, however, add that a way would have to be found in due
course for the original backers to realise their investment. These
include Standard Life, Dunedin, Clydesdale Bank, and Melville Street
Investments.
It has been suggested that the most likely buyer is the Mayflower
Corporation of High Wycombe.
Last year, Mayflower achieved turnover of #135m.

THE Bank of England's latest inflation report, due out on Wednesday,
is set to signal a continued disagreement between Governor Eddie George
and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke over interest rates -- but the differences
may have narrowed.
The report is expected to show a less threatening outlook for
inflation than the last one in May due to the evidence of a slowdown in
economic growth since then.
But it is likely to say the Government will still miss its target of
keeping underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments,
below 2.5% by spring 1997 and beyond.
The implication will be that the Bank continues to believe that
interest rates, pegged since February at 6.75%, should rise again.
But unlike in May, when the Bank recommended a half-point rise, it may
now be prepared to settle for a quarter-point increase.

ARIEL DORFMAN's new play is a psychological thriller in which a
television company censor discovers a script that tells the story of his
own life. From revelations about murky political compromises to insights
into his current emotional state, the script -- by an author unknown to
him -- parallels his experiences with uncanny precision. Significantly,
it is unfinished.
Dorfman has made two shifts from the short story on which this world
premiere is based. One is that the unspecified location is explicitly
not some ''small impoverished Spanish-American country''; the other is
that it is set in the future. In other words, this world of veiled
threats, of lies and denial, where father cannot talk honestly to son,
could well be a premonition of our own future.
Or perhaps, as the play deconstructs itself to present us with a
series of sanitised Hollywood endings, it is already a reflection of our
present.
Dorfman's strength and weakness is his insistence on giving us
questions instead of answers. His is a beguilingly unstable vision in
which we can trust no-one and be certain of little. But just when we
need some emotional certainty we find ourselves in a cerebral hall of
mirrors, having lost sight of why the questions were being asked in the
first place.
But the real, and surprising, disappointment is the decision of
director Ian Brown to put together such a geographically and emotionally
rootless company.
Reader might tell a story that could happen anywhere, but it isn't
helped by a production that could have come from anywhere. All I could
see were actorly actors with rounded, RP non-accents and a cold,
ungiving style that made Dorfman's demanding, elusive script all the
more distant.

Music
A SMALL grand piano, a rug, an apron stage, a black backcloth, and
fading light through stained-glass windows combined to give Beethoven's
violin sonatas the atmosphere of intimacy they needed, and which suited
to perfection the lucid, gentle-handed approach to the music favoured by
Susanne Stanzeleit and Gusztav Fenyo in their survey of the 10 works in
Glasgow at the weekend.
The second of their three recitals, with the great G major sonata, Op
96, as its climax, confirmed that the first had been no mere flash in
the pan and that the quiet integrity of their playing had a finesse
beside which louder, brasher performances seem merely crude.
The young German violinist, it became apparent, was at her most
communicative in the slow movements, the inspired simplicity of her
phrasing, perfectly matched to Fenyo's piano part and articulated with a
silvery sweetness that never became cloying.
In so calm a context, Beethoven's touches of tension -- the abrupt
modulations, the sudden rhythmic jerks and, in the A minor sonata, Op
21, the obsessively circling motion -- made their point without forcing.
If the G major sonata stood out above the rest, it was only in the
sense that it sounded more beautiful; but this was a recital that
sustained attention from first note to last.
The last note of the G major, indeed, proved something that had been
noticeable in other works also -- that Stanzeleit saw no need to play it
with a flourish, but to let it speak naturally for itself.

FANS of stand-up comedy have in the past half-decade seen Parrot
master a single angry role, that of Mr Swearie McRanter, the bloke who
wants an answer -- and he effing well wants it NOW, pal! This muscular,
no-nonsense persona brought Parrot a deserved Perrier nomination two
Edinburgh Fringes ago, and will again be on view for three weeks in the
capital this year.
But to avoid getting stuck with it permanently, Parrot has also
written Stuck In The Middle as a deft, thought-provoking, and entirely
gripping piece of theological drama. It's a subtle play which asks more
disturbing questions -- about the nature of religious belief, the
purpose of life -- than it offers comforting resolutions.
Most importantly, while its verbal cut-and-thrust is often irreverent
and sharply funny, recalling Woody Allen at the peak of his powers as a
writer almost 30 years ago, it's also a play with a firm Christian
framework: good versus evil.
It's Parrot himself, playing the part of a despairing would-be
suicide, who is literally caught between these two forces on stage,
between God, whose voice is provided on tape by Jo Brand, and the Devil,
whose lugubrious and tempting tones are those of Greg Proops.
In fact, Parrot has given these two entities all the best lines,
leaving himself with a difficult job to do on stage. Called upon to
react rather than act, Parrot does so with commendable understatement.
So much so that Parrot can no longer be filed away in one performing
category. See him in Stuck In The Middle soon in Edinburgh and you'll
believe.

Baghdad, Sunday
PRESIDENT Saddam Hussein today pardoned political opponents jailed in
Iraq and those living abroad in his second surprise general amnesty in
just over a week.
The official Iraqi News Agency said the amnesty ''revokes the
punishment of all Iraqis in exile and those inside Iraq who have been
convicted for political reasons''.
Thousands of imprisoned Iraqis were expected to benefit from the
amnesty, although exact numbers are not known.
It was not clear why Saddam has decided to issue such a blanket pardon
so soon after a July 22 amnesty that spared mainly army deserters
awaiting the severing of their ears under Iraq's Draconian laws.
Others pardoned earlier included non-political convicts who had served
part of their sentences. Also, many death sentences were commuted to
life in prison.
However, that amnesty excluded murderers, rapists and drug
traffickers.
The pardons indicated the Iraqi leader may be trying to appease the UN
Security Council, which, at the urging of the United States and Britain,
has demanded the Baghdad regime improve its human rights record as a
condition for lifting devastating trade sanctions.
Meanwhile, Kuwait today dismissed reported Iraqi overtures aimed at a
resumption of contacts five years after its 1990 invasion and demanded
the maintenance of sanctions for what it called an act of evil
aggression.
''Kuwait is living through the fifth anniversary of the painful
invasion by the Iraqi regime on the dawn of August 2, 1990, when the
power of evil and aggression trampled all earthly and heavenly values,''
a cabinet statement said.
In a separate statement, Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad
al-Sabah said contact with Iraq could be re-established only when it met
all UN Gulf War ceasefire resolutions.
''Kuwait will not allow or welcome any visit by an Iraqi envoy or
official until the pending issues are finished,'' al-Anba daily said in
a report based on remarks by Sheikh Sabah.
He said the Gulf country wanted Iraq to return missing people and
looted property and take steps to pay compensation for damage caused by
the seven-month 1990--91 occupation.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Saeed al-Sahaf was quoted by the
Moroccan daily Anwal on Thursday as saying Iraq was ready to resume
contacts with Gulf foes Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Baghdad has had no direct contact with either country since the
invasion. Saudi Arabia was used as a base for US-led forces which
evicted Iraqi troops from Kuwait in February 1991.
Kuwait says Iraq still holds more than 600 Kuwaitis and others
detained in the occupation. Iraq denies it holds any.
Iraq is trying to win the lifting of crippling economic sanctions
imposed since the Gulf crisis. It says it has met all the UN disarmament
terms, adding that under the resolutions an oil export embargo should be
lifted in exchange.
In a statement issued to mark Wednesday's anniversary of the invasion,
Kuwait's cabinet praised the international community for keeping
pressure on Baghdad and again thanked the 32-nation coalition that freed
Kuwait in the Gulf War.
* Export earnings from Kuwait's rehabilitated oil industry regained
pre-Gulf War levels for the first time in 1994, a leading commercial
bank said today.
The earnings rose by 10% to 3.3 billion dinars (#7.3 bn) from 3.01
billion (#6.6 bn) in 1993, National Bank of Kuwait said, citing Central
Bank of Kuwait estimates.
The 1994 earnings were 8.7% above the 3.06 billion dinars (#6.8 bn)
recorded in calendar 1989, before Iraq's invasion, NBK said in an
economic review.
The oil sector was badly damaged in the Gulf War that ended Iraq's
occupation when fleeing Iraqi troops torched hundreds of oilwells and
blew up refineries.
Kuwait's property market also picked up markedly in the first half of
1995 although rentals and prices in many areas are still lower than they
were before the Iraqi invasion, a leading commercial bank said.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Decision to go it alone pays off. British wool industry leads the way forward</HEADLINE>

WITH so much of the historic wealth of the Cotswolds and surrounding
area being based on wool, it is appropriate that the 1995 World Sheep
and Wool Congress, which starts today, should be held at Malvern in
Worcestershire.
It is also an appropriate time, with the price of British wool having
doubled in the past two years breathing new life into an industry which
has been hit by world over-production and by national recession.
About 60% of British wool goes into carpet manufacturing but with a
housing market in the doldrums not too many people are buying new
carpets.
But international events, such as falling production in Australia, New
Zealand and particularly Argentina, together with an increasing demand
for British-type wool and some signs of recovery in the carpet industry
have reversed the trend. The People's Republic of China has also
returned to the marketplace.
This has been particularly cheering for Alun Evans, chairman of the
British Wool Marketing Board, who, over the past two to three years has
been grappling with the ending of the wool guarantee paid by the
Government to sheep farmers over the previous four decades.
It has also largely vindicated the board's decision not to join the
International Wool Secretariat but to go it alone with the British wool
symbol licensed to users and in turn providing a promotional budget
boost. Interestingly, Australia is looking at a similar course.
''What we have seen over the past two or three years is a major
increase in price reflecting less production and increased demand,''
said Mr Evans.
''I don't think we are going to see that continuing to increase to the
same volume over the next two or three years but I think we will
maintain those prices and improve on them.''
The success of the British system has led to a steady influx of
visitors from Italy, Spain, France, Germany and the Republic of Ireland
anxious to find out how to establish similar structures in their
countries.
''In fact they are lobbying the European Commission to have wool
recognised as an agricultural product with the aim of attracting FEOGA
grants for processing structures.
''I would have to say their chances are slim but what we have said to
them is that we will help with the marketing of their wool for a price
and that would enable us to pay more to our producers. We might become
the European centre for selling wool.''
Wool is sold worldwide on a tariff-free basis and subject to
fluctuations in currencies and in world supply and demand.
''In other words, it is an indication of what could happen to any
product if we were outside Europe and we were operating at a free-world
market level as Gatt suggests we all should be one day,'' Mr Evans
added.
''We would be very vulnerable to world problems. But it is a reality
and what we have done as a board is to face that reality. We still have
statutory powers to collect and grade the wool as well as promote and
sell it.
''The removal of the guarantee has enabled us to become a lot more
focused in terms of what we are doing; that is to get the wool from the
farm at as low a cost as possible, get as high a price as we can at
auction and pass as much of the money as we can back to the producer as
quickly as possible.
''I think the system we have devised allows this to happen. We saw the
changes coming and we planned for them.''
This took the form of creating a revolving loan from producers under
which they get an immediate payment for their wool on the basis of
projected end prices together with a later supplementary payment based
on actual returns and investment income.
The board has invested in downstream activities which turned out to be
nice little earners. This led them to capture 70% of the grading
facilities round the country and absorbing these into the board as a
farmers' co-operative cutting down the tax bill and redistributing this
to producers.
Mr Evans described himself simply as ''a sheep farmer who doesn't get
to spend enough time with his sheep'' -- he has 2500 breeding ewes,
mainly Welsh Mountain, plus beef stores on the family farm of Caerffynon
near Tywyn, Gwynedd.
As well as the Wool Board he heads up the #650m-a-year National
Farmers' Union Mutual Insurance Group; acts as chairman of the Welsh
Food Promotion body and a hill farming advisory committee.
He is also a council member of Food From Britain and a Deputy
Lieutenant for Gwynedd. He received an OBE for his work as chairman of
the Welsh Council of the NFU.

Music
HAVING spent the day listening to pipes and drums at the Dundonald
Lowland Gathering, the prospect of an evening of soothing string music
was a welcome one. In the closing concert of the 1995 International
Workshop Series, 80 conference delegates joined forces for a programme
of British string music.
A first-half of Elgar, Walton, and Ian Whyte revealed an expansive
string sound though lacking necessary shading, obviously the fault of
conductor William LaRue Jones. Opting for a full-blooded account of
Elgar's Introduction and Allegro, Jones failed to put across the
contemplative nature of much of this music.
Consisting mainly of American musicians, the ensemble enjoyed the
lilting rhythms and modal melodies of Ian Whyte's edition of
Killiecrankie. Passionately patriotic, Scotland's film-makers need look
no further for their next epic's score.
A change of conductor in the second half brought better results in
Vaughan Williams' Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis. Exquisitely
scored for double string orchestra and solo quartet, Gerald Fischbach
wove a thread of clarity through Williams' ingenious development of
Tallis's noble theme.
Striking chords sat alongside the most intimate of melodies,
particularly those from the solo quartet, led by Jerre Gibson. Textures
glowed in subtle moods of passion and tenderness, not least evident in
the closing moments as Fischbach sustained an astonishingly long final
note, shrinking from an immense chord to a barely audible tremor on the
tip of 80 bows.
Very effective.

VISUAL ART
Clare Henry reviews a Festival parade of photography that gives more
than a snap shot of Scottish life
TO BOLDLY GO . . . is the title of Ron O'Donnell's newest photo. True
enough, since its invention 150 years ago photography has managed to
explore in all directions and be all things to all men: mirror, window,
documentation, souvenir, visual memory. ''This is my mother,'' people
will say, as they show you their icon made out of paper and silver
compound.
From its earliest days, with pioneers like Hill, Adamson, and Annan,
photography was a particularly Scottish art. Incredibly this is the
first big photography show in the RSA.
''But this isn't an exhibition. It's a parade!'' exclaimed curator
Sara Stevenson at the opening of Light From The Dark Room: A Celebration
of Scottish Photography at the RSA in Princes Street. Thankfully her
parade of 450 photos covering 150 years is not boringly chronological --
nor is the excellent catalogue.
One impressive thing about this huge, marvellous Edinburgh Festival
bonanza is that it dares to weave from mind to mind, century to century.
In each room ancient and modern are juxtaposed so that visitors can
trace lines of influence, inheritance, and connection.
Stevenson is head of photography at the Scottish National Gallery,
whose collection (speedily built up over the past 10 years,
substantially with public gifts, from a lucky core of 5000 amazing
pictures by Hill Adamson to 20,000 items ranging from 1839 to today)
forms the basis of this show.
It's by no means all small, faint, sepia historical images.
Contemporary folk feature strongly, and in an inspired move, nine
photographers were invited to show bold new work. My one big criticism
is that, as ever, an Edinburgh-based national organisation has ignored
the rest of Scotland. Eight of the nine are from Edinburgh.
This really will not do. Stevenson has a national responsibility.
Glasgow's specialist photography gallery, Street Level, is a centre of
excellence. The rest of Scotland no doubt has similar complaints of
omission. Another complaint is the distracting purple and gold decor,
although the overall hang is handsome.
Ironically the National Gallery's #10,000 photography budget was wiped
out in January when the Government cut #500,000 off the #1.67m purchase
grant, so buying the new work is out. A valid National Lottery candidate
here surely? I can claim a small contribution to the inclusion of
photography within the circle of visual arts. As curator of the Vigorous
Imagination and of the 1986 Serpentine show, I fought hard to show
photographers like Colvin and O'Donnell alongside painters.
Scottish voices are individual and candid. To echo the cross weave of
the show I spoke to some invited photographers about their work, and
that of their favourites.
Tragically, Raymond Moore, named without exception by all the artists
as their key inspiration, died in poverty in 1987 aged 67. Despite an
international reputation, no museum would buy his archive, leaving his
widow and young son in dire straits. This is a sad indictment of British
attitudes to fine art photography.
Calum Colvin studied sculpture and photography, bringing both together
in his big, colourful constructed photos. ''I've chosen Hill and Adamson
plus Joe McKenzie, my tutor at Dundee. I first realised the importance
of Hill and Adamson when I discovered them in Chicago's famous
collection. It was good to see Scots represented there.
''My new series, Ornithology, is a reaction to doing computer pictures
for a year. I'm trying to loosen up and get back to my early manic
painterly style. Computer imagery can be too neat. I've moved to birds,
to escape figures. Sacred Ibis 1995 is about luck, random arithmetic,
jackpots and the lottery! My series Seven Deadly Sins is touring Spain
and next week my big retrospective opens in Helsinki.
''No, I hadn't thought about Hill and Adamson's pictures being staged
tableaux like mine. How odd!''
''Like everyone else, my hero is Ray Moore,'' says Iain Stewart, 28.
''I never met him; I wish I had. He made poetry out of the everyday: a
road in Galloway; a commonplace house in Allonby; snow melting on drain
covers. He's very clever with light too. He's a magician with nothing up
his sleeve -- able to conjure a composition out of nowhere. I never tire
of looking at his work.
''He's hard to talk about -- and he himself never talked about his
work. When someone wrote to ask for explanations, he sent them a book of
twelfth-century philosophy!
''I also work in places I know well, get to know the light there. From
the Morning are colour skies taken near my home on the outskirts of
Edinburgh. The light changes so fast at dawn or dusk that you have to
grab the decisive moment.''
David Williams came to photography late after a career as a musician.
''Murray Johnston, who died tragically at 41 in 1990, did a lot for me
and many others. He was a superb artist. Look at his lyrical landscapes
of Keilder Forest! But he sacrificed his art for teaching. He had this
amazing talent for discovering and encouraging new blood, first as
director of Stills Gallery, then head of photography at Edinburgh. I've
got his job -- he would laugh! He was so sympathetic. Photography is a
lonely business and Murray made it less lonely.
''My work has evolved along musical lines: from melody to jazz if you
like. In the 1980s it was all portraits. The new work is abstract:
panels of intense Rothko blue divided by a vibrating white thread or
string.''
Since 1983 portraitist Robin Gillanders has taught at Napier. ''My new
work shows Ian Hamilton Finlay in a rowing boat on his garden pond. I'm
collaborating with Finlay but I hesitated to ask him to pose. The SNPG
wanted a portrait so that helped. He had to trust me enough. I can say
it's one portrait I'm really pleased with.
''I originally taught history, so I'm interested in William Carrick
who worked in St Petersburg in the 1850s. His portraits are remarkable
documents of ordinary fishmongers, haberdashers, match sellers.''
Catriona Grant, 31, says she is more influenced by historical American
photographers because she studied at Glasgow under American Joshua
Cooper. ''I admire my contemporaries: Harry Kerr, Stewart, Williams,
Malde. I also love Thomas Annan's 1868 Glasgow High Street close with
its wee ghostly figure and the blurred washing on the line.
''My new pictures show my mother-in-law being happily carried aloft by
a blurr of an angel. Her religion is important to her, so she's radiant.
It's typical of the way I photography my family. They join in and act
out my ideas.''
Pat MacDonald is famous for her beautiful aerial colour photography,
with her husband as pilot.
''I find pictures in poems; ideas grow around a couple of lines. Hugh
MacDiarmid's ''The desert is the abode of supreme serenity'' inspired my
Mirages pictures. My new work, Sonnets to Orpheus, inspired by Rilke,
has 10 panels, starting with his ''Tall Tree of Sound''. Hades is
symbolised by an aerial shot of dark waters overflowing a fenced field.
From the air it looks like the gaping hole to hell. All the photos are
Scottish landscapes, but some appear abstract.''
Owen Logan says he identifies with Thomas Annan who documented Glasgow
slums in the 1860s to aid social reform. ''He deserves to be much more
widely known. I'm interested in foreign cultures. My new series,
Ransomed Soul, is about religious identity in Nigeria, where
christianity is now the mainstream for blacks. Ancient religions still
exist so it makes for a spiritually divided society.''
This show runs till October 15. Don't miss it.

<HEADLINE>Strathclyde boost for wind farms.     University research programme.</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>15</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977125538</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A NEW computer programme being drawn up by Strathclyde University
should help ease progress towards the creation of alternative energy
sources, such as wind farms, in rural areas.
It is one of around 70 EU-backed research programmes looking at
renewable energy resources under the Apas scheme. It involves links with
the Scottish Agricultural College and Highland Region as well as
partners in Spain and Portugal.
Dr Andrew Grant, a director of the Energy Systems Research Unit at
Strathclyde, sees Scotland ''just about getting on the bandwagon'' of
energy production from wind farms. But he admits there are snags
connected with the planning, the environmental impact and economics to
iron out first.
''What we are trying to do is to identify the barriers to exploiting
renewable energy. We are looking at the Highland Region in particular,
because it has a lot of information on energy demand, but we are trying
to get some general truths out of this.
''We are developing some software which can do things like monitor
energy demand right down to an individual house level, look at renewable
energy systems and how they may be affected by weather and other
variables, do matching studies of supply and demand and fit these into a
regional framework down to whatever scale we want.
''In other words, we are trying to generate information that can be
used by developers and planners when they are considering actual
projects. A lot of things have stuck in the planning phase at the
moment. There are a lot of objections to these schemes and planners
don't really know how they should be approaching it.''
Wind farms are a particular case and, assuming planning goes through,
there will be a number of these units in Scotland within the next six
months or a year, including a major project at Douglas in the Borders,
on Islay and at Assynt in the Highlands.
Europe has lagged behind the rest of the world in using renewable
energy sources and within Britain Scotland has suffered from previous
exclusion from the Non-Fossil Fuel Order (NFFO) under which electricity
companies were obliged to purchase a proportion of their energy from
renewable sources.
Some amends were made last year with the first Scottish Renewables
Obligation which led to the approval of 30 projects with a total
capacity of 76 megawatts with wind generation accounting for 45
megawatts.
Many individual units are already up and running. One manufacturer,
Provan Engineering of Kilmarnock, has specialised in manufacturing 2.2kw
wind generators mostly for domestic use although these are providing
lights on the station at Corrour on Rannoch Moor and at Glen Affric
Youth Hostel. Later this year it will be offering 5kw machines more
suitable for heavier use, for example on farms.
As Dr Grant commented: ''If we could get rid of the politics there
would be a lot more use of wind for energy production in Scotland.''

IT IS thanks to television that her name, her face, and the soft
Scottish resonances of her voice are famous. But Lynn Faulds Wood has
harnessed the power of television for something far more important than
personal recognition. She has used it, over the years, to defend all our
interests, as consumers, to confront the mighty on behalf of the mouse.
And now she is about to do it again, this time in a six-part
television series, called The Lady Killers, on the diseases that do just
that -- kill women. But the difference is that this time she knows more
than most, more than anyone would ever want to, really, about the
subject.
There was nothing in the script she originally envisaged that said she
had to get cancer, too.
The public knows her and her husband, John Stapleton, as the former
presenters of Watchdog on BBC television. It was when they were making
those programmes, and because of the facts which emerged in the course
of their research, that Lynn Faulds Wood wanted to look at the lottery
of health care in the UK: the discrepancies and delays that patients had
experienced among GPs, particularly in spotting and diagnosing cancer
symptoms.
That was four years ago. She describes it, lightly, as an ''irony''
that she should find that she had cancer at that time. She went to her
GP because she found blood in her stools -- ''Try and get that in your
copy,'' she says, as a challenge: ''you might save a life if you do''.
After an uncomfortable interlude -- ''there I was shining a torch down
the toilet'', her cancer was diagnosed.
She has lost about nine inches of her colon and is still six or seven
months away from what she describes as ''more or less the all-clear''.
Yet now she says she regards it ''as something that has been good in
my life''. She is quite sure that she would never have made this series
without having had cancer herself. She is now, quite simply, on a
crusade to save women's lives.
Just more than a year ago, she made a programme for Granada's World in
Action about cancer patients and their health care -- ''the Beeb weren't
interested'', she says. It got an astonishing audience of more than 10
million, and the subsequent response was also encouraging about the
prospects for a further series.
The biggest problem she has encountered, says Lynn Faulds Wood, is
persuading television executives that audiences will watch programmes
about subjects like cancer.
Now the programmes are made. They are optimistic, sensitive --
cheerful even. She was encouraged by a round of applause at the end of
the presentation at the press launch. ''Everything we are looking at has
got reasonably simple solutions,'' she says. Those solutions are about
prevention, about how to avoid problems, what to do, how to help
yourself, and how to persuade others to help you, says Faulds Wood. They
may be harrowing in some ways, sad in others, but they are designed to
help.
The subjects are also presented in a comfortable, populist fashion. A
number of experts and famous faces, like the agony aunt, Claire Rayner,
and the Green Goddess, Diana Moran, talk about their own brushes with
mortality.
Singer Michael Ball has written the title music for the series; he was
a close family friend of Angela McGowan, whose early death from ovarian
cancer led to the establishment of the charity RoC (Research into
Ovarian Cancer), and Ball's song The Rose will be released by Sony
Records early next month to raise money for RoC.
Lynn Faulds Wood believes her own experience has been a help. ''It's
made me join a club which an awful lot of people belong to: you have a
lot of understanding of people's problems if you've been through it
yourself. It made people much more happy to talk to me, and they talked
to me much more frankly. They trusted me because I've been through the
horror.''
It is a pity, however, that the series will be screened somewhat later
in the evening than envisaged by Granada. Running for six weeks, it
starts on Scottish tomorrow evening at 11pm, but some stations may not
broadcast it until 11.40 pm. It is scheduled for a repeat in the
afternoons in September. Charles Tremayne, head of current affairs and
documentaries at Granada, is critical: ''We think it is very
disappointing that a programme like this, which has the capacity to save
lives, has been shunted to the edges of the schedule for purely
commercial considerations,'' he says.
Programmes like The Lady Killers are already scarce at peak time,
Tremayne points out, and scheduling the screening so late ''asks
significant questions about the commitments of ITV to factual programmes
in general''.
The series also contains a considerable element of chastising public
authority. The first programme, for example, deals partly with cervical
cancer, an illness about which we know a great deal now -- but about
which there is still immense public ignorance and official mismanagement
of the preventative screening programme.
Just consider these statistics: Britain and Finland both set up
screening procedures 30 years ago. In Finland they have reduced cases of
cervical cancer by 85% and have not found a single case of invasive
cervical cancer in the past five years. In Britain, something like #250m
has been wasted on inefficient, inaccurate screening, and about 20,000
women are dead who would not have died had they lived in Finland,
according to research conducted by Lynn Faulds Wood.
We also remain immensely ignorant about the suspected causes of
cancer: for example, the huge number of women in Britain who receive a
cold, chilling, written notice from their doctors after a smear test,
advising them of the presence of abnormal cells, are not aware that this
condition can be resolved naturally. They are also highly unlikely to be
aware that one possible cause is what amounts to an epidemic of sexually
transmitted diseases in this country.
Why? ''We are the second worst in Europe for the incidence of sexually
transmitted disease,'' says Lynn Faulds Wood. ''We don't talk about sex
-- but we do a lot of it.''
It may have something to do with sex at a young age, and with a
variety of partners, and also with hygiene and health. Greatly daring --
and most amusingly -- in the first programme the presenter takes herself
into the steam of the showers among the London Welsh rugby team and asks
them whether they wash their willies.
''I wanted men involved in the series and thinking about what they're
doing with their willies,'' she says. ''If they treat them more
hygienically, they are treating women better.''
For the record, the captain describes how his mother had taught him to
wash his penis properly, as Lynn has taught her seven-year-old son
Nicholas.
Her husband, who was her mentor when she embarked upon a career in
television, has been hugely supportive. She is in her mid-forties and
they have been together for almost 20 years. They met on her arrival in
London, seeking fame and fortune as a French teacher. She had read
French and Spanish at Glasgow University, after a childhood on Loch
Lomondside.
Her father ran the Scottish Youth Hostels and her mother had been a
journalist, writing for the Dunbartonshire County Reporter and the
Helensburgh Advertiser, after bringing up her four children.
Was journalism then a career that she had really always wanted to
follow? There is another ironic twist here. Her mother suffered from a
terrible disease, little known, but affecting hundreds of thousands of
women, called lupus. ''I don't think I ever wanted to be anything that
my mother was,'' she says, sadly.
The last programme in the series is about lupus. In a way it must be a
testimonial.

WHEN comedienne Faith Brown was told that a routine smear test had
revealed there were abnormal cells present, she felt like she had been
''kicked in the stomach''. Worse news was to be delivered by her then
doctor. He dismissed the report as a money-making practice by BUPA to
encourage women to have a biopsy.
''That bastard could have killed me,'' says Brown, still anxious and
angry eight years after her world collapsed just before that Christmas.
''My first thought was that I was going to die. People who have cancer
die. I could not believe what this doctor was telling me and went to
have it checked.''
Cancer haunts the middle-aged. Though it is not restricted to such an
age group and can develop in anyone, it remains the specific fear of
many parents and older relations. When a friend or relative develops
cancer there is a standard reaction from those in their life.
For Faith Brown a biopsy could not be arranged for a number of weeks
as she was heavily committed to work over the Christmas period. One was
scheduled for late January. For her the festive period was a horror of
frantic gigs and stoney silence. She wouldn't talk to her husband of 27
years, nor her young son.
The memory of her mother who died of cancer at 46 was fixed firmly in
her mind. ''When I had the biopsy, that was the most traumatic thing
because I had to wait for two weeks to see if it was benign or malignant
or if it had spread. That was the scariest thing.
''I wouldn't speak to anybody, I did my gigs. Thank God I was working;
it took my mind off it. But it was at the back of my mind, waiting for
the post to come. Afterwards my doctor held my hand and said, 'Can I
tell you, you are a very lucky lady Ms Brown. If you hadn't come when
you did you would not be here today.' It would have spread like
wildfire.''
Faith Brown had ovarian cancer. Yet today she has recovered and
remains a top entertainer. She still requires regular check-ups, but she
now talks about her illness in a bid to educate others and break the
stigma that exists around this strain of the disease.
''People worry. They feel ovarian cancer is a stigma, a sign of
promiscuity, which is nonsense. I have had the same man in my life for
27 years. So there was nothing for me to hide. That's why I've got to go
and tell people about it.''
Today her health remains of the utmost importance to her, but she
protects it with regular check-ups and examinations. She resigned from
the practice of the doctor whose lax attitude could have meant the
disease being dismissed and her life lying on the line.
''I'm big-busted, I go for my mammograms. I go for my well-woman
examinations and I go every single year, just to make sure it's OK
because once it hits you, cancer scares the living daylights out of you.
All cancers are treatable, if you can catch them in time.''
* Faith Brown is featured in Dying For Love, the first programme in
The Lady Killers series, which looks at cervical cancer.

JIM STEVENS misses the point (Starting the debate in England, July
28). Federalism does not provide the answer to the West Lothian
Question.
English regions are not nations, so English regional government does
not attract the same support as a Scottish parliament. The boundaries of
English regions are not agreed. They do not attract the same level of
identification. They lack the necessary strength of political culture to
sustain the level of popular participation essential for a healthy
democracy.
This basic lack of demand will be reflected in their similarly
restricted powers. So long as the Scottish parliament has wider powers
than the English regions, then the WLQ remains.
This is why messy solutions, such as my proposal (letters, July 24)
for reduced Scottish representation at Westminster combined with
electoral reform, are realistic.
Electoral reform would diminish the chances of Scottish MPs forcing
unwanted legislation on England because the representation between the
parties would become less polarised geographically.
If this remains unacceptable to Mr Stevens, he should reflect on the
16 years' worth of domestic legislation foisted on Scotland by English
Tory MPs.

ELIZABETH BUIE'S article on Scotland's case for self-determination
before the UN Committee on Human Rights in Geneva quotes Mr Alan Miller
of the Scottish Council of Civil Liberties to the effect that the SCCL
initiative was the first occasion on which Scotland's case has been
accepted by the UN in a human rights context (July 21). This is untrue.
On the initiative of the Scotland-UN Committee, the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights in Geneva opened a file on the Scottish
self-government question in the summer of 1979 after the Scotland-UN
group had been set up for this purpose with discreet but very high-level
support in the aftermath of the referendum scandal.
As Dr Jakob Moller, of the United Nations in Geneva, can confirm, that
file has meantime attained very substantial proportions because of the
additional material which Scotland-UN has fed in over the years.
I understand that the SCCL was supplied with a complete file of
Scotland-UN material, so that it is difficult to see how Mr Miller could
have been unaware of the situation. None the less, we welcome the SCCL
initiative as a most useful back-up for our own campaign at
international diplomatic level.
The foreign ministries of the four UN member states whose diplomats
are grilling the UK on the Scottish question were all thoroughly briefed
by Scotland-UN over a long period -- not merely in a United Nations
context but also directly as well as within the framework of the Council
of Europe, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, and
other forums.
Scotland-UN has raised the denial of Scotland's internationally
guaranteed right to self-determination at numerous diplomatic
conferences in Geneva, Paris, Copenhagen, Vienna, Moscow, Strasbourg,
etc (all attended by virtually the same community of international human
rights experts), as well as presenting the case to every government in
the world individually.
For example, I was a member of a Scotland-UN delegation which was
invited from New York to present the Scottish case to a week-long
international conference at UN headquarters in Geneva in September,
1983. I remember being informally cross-questioned on the Scottish
political situation by German diplomats after my own speech. The Herald
published a letter from me at the time in response to a news report on
the event.
The only thing that is new is that the UK Government's
''forgetfulness'' in its report regarding the discrepancy in its
referendum policies in Scotland and Northern Ireland has at last
presented the already well-informed international diplomats with a

That they have not been slow to grasp the opportunity demonstrates

their action has been prepared over the years.

A NEW document just obtained under the US Freedom of Information Act
reached the media on July 29. It had been requested by lawyers over four
years ago.
Like other recently obtained documents it points to the involvement of
Palestinian groups in the Lockerbie bombing and does not mention Libya.
The careful obliteration from the document of material concerning
terrorist activity in Germany at the time can only heighten speculation.
There can be no doubt that the cell uncovered in October 1988 had been
planning to destroy an aircraft in flight (they were arrested in
possession of an altitude-triggered bomb), but by 1991 it was being
alleged that the two Libyans were responsible, and despite State
Department statements that it had been a ''Libyan job from start to
finish'' the most likely explanation for Libyan involvement would be
that they had been asked to take over when the PFLP group had been
uncovered.
It is therefore crucial that the allegations in this new document
relate to Palestinian activity in Germany against PanAm in
November/December 1988, well after the disruption of the PFLP-GC cell.
Its allegations exactly fit those contained in the film The Maltese
Double Cross in which it was alleged that although one cell of the
Palestinian group PFLP-GC had been disrupted in Germany in October 1988
others were not.
Because this document was not available to the film's researchers, it
provides some further independent corroboration of their work.
This was an American intelligence document; would its contents have
been known to the UK Government? The Prime Minister's PPS (Mr Edward
Oakden) told us in March this year that no warnings relevant to
Lockerbie were received beforehand.
On the other hand Tam Dalyell, MP, who has had sight of some British
intelligence documents of the period has no doubt that adequate warnings
were available beforehand in the UK intelligence community.
The obvious way to make progress remains to have a trial. The failure
of the Foreign Office, the Lord Advocate, or of course the Americans to
show interest in the option of trial in a neutral country, to a form of
which the Libyans have agreed, remains for some of us the most
suspicious aspect of this whole sorry story.
It seems that current members of the administrations on both sides of
the Atlantic need to look afresh at the available evidence and to
reconsider how a fair trial may best be expedited.
They should start by demanding to see the contents of all their own
relevant intelligence files. Or can senior echelons in the intelligence
community issue the equivalent of public-interest-immunity certificates
against their own administrations?

OF all the rules and regulations which discriminate against the
elderly surely one of the most flagrantly unfair is in the application
of the television licence fee.
The elderly who have been fortunate enough to find suitable sheltered
accommodation escape with only a proportion to pay while those who have
to live on in flats or houses too big and expensive for them have to
fork out #86.50 or be fined.
For many housebound, television like the telephone is their only means
of contact with the outside world.
Would it not be fairer if every person over a certain age was charged
the same?

THE article on Bank of Scotland sponsorships mentions ''Sorbie Primary
School in Dumfries'' (July 17).
Sorbie is a village in Wigtownshire, the area occupying the extreme
south-west corner of Scotland.
Dumfries is a sizeable town on the river Nith about 65 miles from
Sorbie.
Wigtownshire and its adjoining county of Kirkcudbrightshire constitute
the ancient province of Galloway, which has claims to be the cradle of
Christianity in Scotland -- St Ninian was established at Whithorn
centuries before St Columba at Iona -- and the cradle of Scottish
independence, Bruce having won his first victory in a battle
commemorated by the Bruce Memorial in Glentrool.
Wigtownshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, and Dumfriesshire together
constitute the administrative region known as Dumfries and Galloway.
Dumfriesshire and Galloway would have been a less confusing, if more
cumbersome, title. It is, I suggest, simply not permissible to use
''Dumfries'' as short-hand for the name of the region.

IN Madrid later this year the European Union heads of government will
meet to discuss the continuing crisis of unemployment, again. They
always discuss unemployment; they have been discussing it for years,
ever careful to give it priority over all other affairs. As if it made
much difference. Throughout the European Union there are more than 18
million people out of work. Politicians make portentous noises and the
EU huffs and puffs about action plans while the European Commission
reviews trends and adopts formal reports. Ambitious commission plans for
the creation of 15 million jobs in the EU -- with a consequent halving
of unemployment by the end of the century -- have come to nought so far.
The curse of enforced mass idleness continues to poison social and
economic life throughout the member states including the United Kingdom.
Britain was among the first to witness the spiralling of jobless
figures as Thatcherism and market forces took their toll. Nowhere
suffered more at the beginning than Scotland whose status as a
deindustrialised nation stands testimony. Scotland's attempt to escape
high unemployment with recession-proof small and medium-sized indigenous
businesses has not been achieved. On the periphery of Europe, Scotland
is still quick to suffer and slow to recover from economic illness. The
evidence is all around, in the circle of urban decay which disfigures
cleaned-up Glasgow, in the social collapse of areas where the drug
culture and the emergence of the unskilled, unemployable underclass has
presented a new challenge. This phenomenon now manifests itself in the
burgeoning tragedy of social upheaval in other British cities, notably
in southern England where London is reduced to being a recipient of
European aid for needy areas and Tory MPs are suddenly quiet about
subsidy junkies.
Alarmingly, there is now an unspoken assumption that nothing can be
done about mass unemployment. Politicians disagree about the effects of
Europe's high social protection programmes which are more expensive than
those of the United States where jobs are created much more effectively.
There are complaints from Conservatives about high-wage industries
denying jobs to the qualified and deserving. Yet in Germany, with some
of the highest wages in Europe, there are arguments that wage levels are
by no means decisive in determining unemployment rates. British
Ministers affect to work for job creation, except that the jobs created
are too often in low-wage industries without basic social protection.
Which is better -- a job which is not worth the miserable wage, or basic
welfare support for not working?
As Europe, with its clapped-out heavy industry and struggling
economies, moves towards the twenty-first century it is worth noting
that the past decade has produced an upsurge in unemployment which has
only now begun to stabilise. At the same time the number of jobs created
has risen since mid-1993 but we still have 11% of Europeans out of work
with, according to the latest European trends, no reason to foresee much
change in the next few years. The temptation is to shrug and accept this
disaster as inevitable. This fatalism is exacerbated by the patent
failure of ''trickle-down'' economic theory which held that the creation
of a super-rich elite would inevitably produce work for the others.
Instead, it has produced the obscenity -- nowhere in Europe more than in
Britain -- of financial killings for a lucky few from utilities once
owned by those who are the system's new losers.
Looking back on the years of rising unemployment it is difficult to
ignore the fact that employers have enjoyed too long a period of
declining responsibility, especially since the neutering of organised
labour. A new approach is needed -- one where employers are expected to
employ in return for reduced costs in non-wage areas. That presumably
requires somewhat less simplistic tax policies and, more than anything,
a stronger sense of social responsibility from all sides of industry and
government. Everything else has so far failed.

THE Queen favours Fair Isles and lawyers pop in to have their collars
turned. Teddy bears do not park their plush for long, and this week's
delivery of apricot and almond jam disappeared from the shelves like
snow off a dike on a summer's day.
Since 1882 the Royal Edinburgh Repository and Self Aid Society has
been repairing the nation's linen, ravelling up its stockings, baking
its cakes, knitting, sewing and keeping body and soul together. For the
Society -- which runs the only shop of its kind in the country -- sells
the skills of women compelled to scrape by on meagre incomes.
Acute financial hardship is a pre-requisite for membership of the
Society and, a sign of the times perhaps, numbers have doubled in recent
years. Some 400 women living as far afield as Shetland and Portsmouth
send their work in to the modest shop in Edinburgh Castle Street to make
an average of no more than #40 a week.
Their customers come from around the world. Superintendent Cathy Pirie
says the babies' shawls are typical of return trade. ''We have customers
who were wrapped in a Society shawl when they were a baby coming in for
a shawl for their own child. I expect these children will be coming back
for the same thing in years to come.''
The Society, as its quaintly Victorian title indicates, was set up to
help women on a low income, a rule being that they did not have a
husband in work. That holds good today. Many in the early days, says
Cathy Pirie, were widows whose husbands had gone to war and not
returned.
Now, in addition to widows and spinsters, some 50 single mothers are
on the books -- the full price of every member's work going back to them
with the cost of running the shop and its staff of six being met by the
Society's own funds. Those unable to deliver their work in person have
the cost of postage refunded.
Everything on sale in the shop is brand new, but there is,
nonetheless, a feel to the goods and services that speaks of old-world
style.
The Queen Mother is the Society's patron and the Queen too shows an
interest. ''I send a box of goods down to Holyrood Palace each summer
when the Royal Family is in residence. Her Majesty definitely likes Fair
Isle sweaters,'' says Cathy Pirie.
Linen repairs and the refurbishment of kilt stockings that have lost
their heels are the stuff of every day trade at the Repository, all of
whose supplies work from home. The age range of Society members runs
from the early twenties into the mid-eighties. When members are too
frail to work the Repository's benevolent society takes care of their
financial needs.
''Most of the women sending their work here would be in acute
difficulty without these earnings. A lot of them have illnesses and
being able to do something well that is really wanted, gives them a will
to live,'' says Cathy Pirie.
And those Teddy bears? As little as one pound buys a friend for life.

Music
AND finally the Kreutzer -- the biggest, not necessarily the best of
Beethoven's violin sonatas, but certainly the one whose name resonates
most powerfully in people's minds and whose surging energy can seem to
devour its performers.
Yet not all of the Kreutzer is volcanic, and it was no surprise to
find Susanne Stanzeleit and Gusztav Fenyo last night subduing some of
the eruptions in order to bring the music into line with the other
performances they have given with such quiet perception during the past
three days.
There were moments, rightly and inevitably, when the fires burst out,
but this, once again, was for the most part a beautiful and illuminating
performance upon which two finely-tuned players bestowed a rewarding
unity of outlook.
To the swirl of the finale, Stanzeleit brought a fleet, clear, almost
Mendelssohnian gleam, its twists and turns enthralling to follow.
But the two shorter sonatas earlier in the programme were no less
enthrallingly presented and were filled with the rhythmic niceties, soft
confidences, tiny pleasures that also characterised the Kreutzer. Each
variation in the finale of the A major sonata, Op 30, No 1, was unfolded
with a genuine sense of surprise. There was always in the background a
sense of sublime improvisation.
This was subtle, responsive duo playing of a very special sort. What
next?
A Schubert and Brahms cycle might do the trick.

AFTER long years of government the Conservative Party is not
particularly well endowed with either intellectual or political energy.
What there is can be found on the right wing of the party. That this
should be so is not surprising, despite the defeat of Mr Redwood in the
leadership campaign. The very fact of his challenge underlined the
strength and drive of the right, and this is not negated by the fact
that the parliamentary party chose to opt for the perceived safety of Mr
Major. Further evidence, if any is needed, can be found in the political
events of recent weeks. In Scotland Mr Forsyth, although furiously
signalling an even-handed approach, is undoubtedly among the most active
of senior Conservative politicians. He is, and will remain, a man of the
right.
The number and flavour of resolutions for debate to the party
conference indicates clearly the anti-European Union flavour of the bulk
of the contributors and this, once more, is a sign of the strength and
determination of the right. The other great issue which dominates
right-wing thinking surfaced yesterday with Mr Redwood demanding that #5
billion be cut from the spending plans set out in the Chancellor's last
Budget. It was not a coincidence that the right-wing chairman of the
Tory finance committee also demanded that the Government deliver on
taxes and spending, although he spoiled the effect by insisting that the
present level of public expenditure would do justice to any socialist
government in Europe, thus, without any vestige of shame (or logic),
contriving to link the three main subjects of Tory anathema.  Energy and
intellectual drive is not enough, although they do go a good way when
set against the vacuum which is Mr Major's policy initiatives. If there
are to be deep tax cuts, perhaps funded by the removal of #5 billion
from the existing Budget plans, where are they to come from? The planned
growth in budgetary spending in the immediate future is very small and
can hardly be altered now without causing grave problems. Saving money
for taxes by slashing the social security budget is similarly risky, as
real cuts would call for difficult legislation and a political fallout
close to the General Election. During the recent leadership campaign the
Prime Minister appeared to promise the abolition of inheritance tax and
capital gains tax because they discouraged the enterprise economy.
The Chancellor is less keen, although the Treasury would not suffer
unduly from their abandonment. The politics of these taxes is quite a
different matter. Only the rich pay capital gains tax and inheritance
tax, although many of the rich manage to avoid both. The ending of
inheritance tax in particular would benefit the small number of very
large estates in a way that would certainly bring accusations that the
Tories were merely helping the wealthy. Right-wing thinkers must tell us
exactly where spending and taxes can be cut realistically. If they
cannot do this, or if their only answer is to propose measures which
would help certain disgruntled Tory voters, they will, for all their
energy, have forfeited any residual respect with the wider electorate.

YOU report that the London/Fort William sleeper is set to continue
over the winter, albeit in severely truncated form (July 26). I sense
strongly that this decision is not so much based on practicalities but
is purely a short-term political expedient to calm the furore over the
whole question.
One sleeping car most of the week and two on Fridays and Sundays --
hardly the stuff of aggressive marketing and certain to fail. I suspect
this is the ultimate desire of the Scottish Office and ScotRail, both of
whom would rather see the back of it.
We now have the ludicrous spectre of a dedicated diesel locomotive
hauling one (or two) coach(es) for 200 miles between Edinburgh and Fort
William with a driver, second man, sleeping-car attendant, and guard.
Hardly a profitable enterprise.
This crew of four will be responsible for a maximum of 24 (48 on
Fridays and Sundays) passengers. Are we seriously to believe that this
is anything but a convenient stopgap to bring us that bit nearer to the
next election and buy time until the heat dies down?
I have expressed the view that the reintroduction of budget seating
accommodation, plus couchette-style sleepers (no attendant necessary)
and a bar/disco car could really get this train moving.
The seating accommodation alone would be a start. Even two extra
coaches with seats are hardly going to tax the fuel consumption of the
locomotive.
We should not be hoodwinked by this latest decision.
Could I also say that as a long-term user of our wonderful West
Highland railway, I would so much appreciate a day ticket which allows
me to alight at one station, have a hill walk, and return from another.
Not a difficult or costly marketing exercise. What about it ScotRail?

I SUSPECT James Shaw Grant who urges city status for Inverness and
financing for the University of the Highlands will be disappointed by
the ''new broom'' at St Andrew's House (July 26).
During the last General Election campaign neither Conservative nor
Labour would give a clear-cut commitment to a university of the north.
Then Tony Worthington mocked me for suggesting that Labour might not win
in 1992 and sidestepped the issue by arguing that a Scottish assembly
would deal with this in 1993.
Astrid Ritchie for the Conservatives told me that Scotland had more
students than England, and presumably we should be grateful for that.
Michael Hirst accused me of scoring party political points. None dealt
with the issue.
In April this year a submission by Highlands and Islands Enterprise
(with Highland Regional Council support) to the Millennium Commission
for funding was rebuffed. The Millennium Commission is London-based, has
no staff in Scotland, and only one Scottish commissioner, the Earl of
Dalkeith.
Did he support it? My own written submission to that august body still
awaits an acknowledgement. I was told by phone that it was mis-filed.
The Highlands and Islands constitute the largest area of the UK
without a university. Based on colleges throughout the north its
potential to specialise in environmental studies, natural resources, new
technologies, and renewable energy is limitless.
There is no single project which attracts such widespread support in
the Highlands. It can attract young people from throughout the world. It
truly is a project for the Millennium.
Yet despite decades of campaigning neither main London-based party has
given it any real backing. Are George Robertson and Michael Forsyth
simply obeying orders from London?

PERSPECTIVE purports to give the truth, the bloody truth, about
Culloden (July 27). It mentions the Duke of Argyll's comments on the
battle's good results for Scotland.
The last time I heard of this noble lord, he had in his hand a golden
alms bowl and he was touring the world in search of needfu' cash to
repair a fire-damaged roof on his simple cot in Inveraray. He is a man
whose comments on anything relating to Scotland's martyrdom are
worthless.
Mr John Prebble really thinks that he speaks with the lips of history.
Listen to him: ''Culloden was like a surgical operation that cut the
throat of a society that was bound to succumb to impending changes
anyway.''
After all, he tells us (as though to clench his nails) the Industrial
Revolution was barely 50 years away. But it was not 50 years away . . .
it was 1000 years away. It was asleep in the womb of time.
Gaeldom was in a cocoon of a timeless paradise. They owned the land.
They owned the rivers. They owned loch, sea, and mountains. 1745 was not
a surgical operation. It was a brutal disembowelment carefully planned.
The key was genocide -- and take the entire Highlands and Islands by
fire and sword.
And this was done.
And the key to all this was the golden-haired laddie. Was he indeed an
agent provocateur?
''For here was the tool . . . the Poseur
Pretender to more than throne;
With gold and flying banners
Leading the clans alone . . .
The trap all set for springing
By men whose hearts were stone.
They have made a harlot of truth. They have made a harlot of our land.
They have placed the jester's cap on the head of justice; and they have
made us lackeys and time-servers in the face of their open contempt. Now
they pervert Culloden where the betrayal of a clown becomes our halo!

AN invitation to the reunion was not, strictly speaking, for me
because I was not a member of that class of '55. My own academic career,
if I can so enhance the description, had ended miserably almost a decade
earlier.
Yet this collection of classmates, now planning to mark the fortieth
anniversary of the day they left Fraserburgh Academy, did indeed bear
relevance to my own life. For, as the young man-about-town, reporter for
the local daily paper, trench-coated in a fair imitation of Humphrey
Bogart, I had caused a bit of a stir at that academy by settling my
attention on one of its pupils.
On the very first date I had even proposed to the young Eden, who
turned up at school the following week, flashing an engagement ring and
announcing that she wasn't coming back. Amid the shock-waves, they
didn't know what the world was coming to.
So I married the child bride and, 40 years later, her classmates were
reaching the upper-fifties and looking back on those good old days,
concluding it was time to hold their first reunion.
Sadly, Eden was one of three who did not survive to anticipate this
gathering of old friends from the Aberdeenshire fishing port. It was not
an occasion for partners, except for the next-of-kin of those no longer
with us.
So, accepting the invitation by proxy for Eden, I drove north with
some trepidation, knowing in advance that I would have to say something.
Would my nerve hold on the night? For this was a time of joyous reunion
in which any mention of absent friends would have to be handled with
care.
Though all were younger than me, I had come to know many of these
people during the years. So I wasn't a total stranger. Yet I realised I
was somehow on the fringe of this gathering, more in the role of
observer, just as I had been 40 years earlier.
I did not share their immediate memory of teachers and escapades,
though much of it had come to me second-hand down the years. But they
had fond memories of Eden and wanted to include me.
My own upbringing took place 15 miles inland, but this town had always
held a special place in my affections. From 1936, Maud School had taken
its annual picnic to those magnificent golden sands at Fraserburgh.
(Given the weather, is there a finer beach in all the world?)
With the dark clouds of war, I remembered that Guy Fawkes Night of
1941 when a blaze at Benzie and Miller's shop lit up the night sky over
Buchan and diverted German bombers from attacking the Forth Bridge.
I remember cowering under the eaves of our village house as the enemy
planes went bumbling towards their new-found target of Fraserburgh. Then
came the thud-thud-thud which left 35 dead that night. I remember seeing
a fleet of lorries taking the coffins to Kirkton Cemetery that Saturday,
a harrowing sight which bound me emotionally forever to this community.
Making my way as a journalist in the early 1950s, I covered the Buchan
beat from Fraserburgh, chugging along in the battered Ford Anglia to
record such events as Coronation Day, the Great Gale of January 31, 1953
-- and the Fraserburgh Lifeboat Disaster which followed nine days later.
These were events I could recall to the audience at the Alexandra
Hotel that evening, dramas from their schooldays in that post-war period
when society had not yet worked out its future.
Looking back to 1955, I suggested that that year, in which they left
school, had marked a watershed in social history. Bill Haley and Elvis
Presley had sprung on the scene with rock'n'roll, heralding a whole new
culture which had dominated the rest of our lives.
At that precise point, they had gone their separate ways, some still
living in the Fraserburgh district, but many now domiciled in distant
parts and returning to greet old friends and classmates, mostly for the
first time since 1955.
Bill Maitland, a businessman in Fraserburgh, and Sandy Campbell, a
chemist in Dundee, had rounded up the exiled Brochers with admirable
diligence and found that any element of risk which attends such
gatherings was quickly swept away in a tide of uninhibited warmth and
joy.
I looked around that company, last seen so long ago, and stripped away
those flecks of grey and lines of experience to remember fresh faces of
youth which seemed now, in retrospect, to have belonged to a distant age
of innocence.
By coincidence, that class of '55 had brought together Ronald Benzie,
now a businessman in the south of England, and Ian Miller, registrar of
Edinburgh's Napier University -- the two direct descendants of that
Benzie and Miller business which went up in flames on Guy Fawkes Day of
1941.
Both were there on the night. And so was Norah Richards, who had been
bridesmaid at our wedding all those years ago. We ate and drank and
danced -- and I managed, with some difficulty, to cope with my speech.
Yes, Eden would have been in her element on a night like this, I was
thinking to myself as I drove off south, wondering where on earth the
years had gone.

AS ANY lawyer worth his salt will tell you, suing in the right country
can bring in millions of pounds. Take, for example, the battle between
oil giants Shell, Esso, and Exxon and the victims' relatives and
survivors of the Cormorant Alpha disaster in the North Sea in 1992.
The oil companies claim that because of the location of the accident,
Scotland is the natural forum for the case to be heard. But the
relatives want the case to be heard in the US, a country with which at
least one of the companies has commercial links.
The reason for the increasingly bitter dispute is very simple -- the
claims will be worth perhaps 20 times as much in the States as they
would be here.
In Texas, the relatives of those who died, and the wives and children
of the survivors, have claims for pain and suffering and punitive
damages, which are not available in Scotland.
In the same way, if you think you have been defamed by a newspaper,
the difference between Scots and English law will make it worth your
while to try to establish jurisdiction south of the Border.
As a dozen or so celebrated cases over the past few years have shown,
while the English system is extremely sympathetic to a fragile ego,
Scottish law takes a much more robust view.
While an English jury might award you a six-figure sum for the
dreadful hurt caused by being described as boring, in the Antony Gecas
case in the Court of Session, Lord Milligan thought that #30,000 would
have been a reasonable award for being labelled a war criminal.
The concern for Scottish newspaper editors has been that the escape of
even a tiny handful of copies of their newspaper over the Border has
been enough to provide an excuse for suing in England.
In the case of broadcasters, such as the BBC, programmes inevitably
stray into England, even although some might be watched or heard only by
a couple of shepherds watching their flocks by night in Northumberland.
The former Hearts footballer, Justin Fashanu, threatened to sue a
Scottish evening newspaper over something that was printed in the
Saturday sports edition. The basis for claiming that England was the
best place to hear the case was that something like a dozen copies of
the paper had been sold in Berwick.
Last year a woman sued in England for a libel she alleged had been
published in an article in Scotland on Sunday. This was despite the fact
that only about 10% of copies of the paper breached Hadrian's Wall.
The newspaper pursued the commonsense argument that since 90% of its
circulation was in Scotland, that was the natural place to try the case.
However, Mr Justice Drake ruled that the Civil Jurisdiction and
Judgments Act 1982 removed the right of the court to decide the
appropriate forum when there were competing claims between the two UK
legal systems.
An appeal was lodged, but the case was settled before the Court of
Appeal could get its hands on it.
Now Mr Justice Drake has changed his mind in a case in which a student
at Stirling University alleged that he had been libelled in a story
published in the Sunday Mail. It has a circulation of about 850,000,
with 60,000 or so sold in England.
After the student claimed damages both in Scotland and England, the
newspaper asked for the English proceedings to be halted on the basis
that Scotland was the obvious and natural jurisdiction.
Not surprisingly, the judge was reminded of his previous decision,
according to which the court had no right to refuse to entertain
proceedings in England.
But after being referred to authority that had not been quoted in the
earlier case, his lordship performed a nifty U-turn and decided his
previous decision had been wrong. He took the view that he did, after
all, have the power to refuse to entertain the English proceedings on
the grounds that England was not the proper forum in a case where a writ
had also been issued in Scotland.
This time the case is likely to reach the Court of Appeal, which will
now be faced with the odd prospect of deciding on two conflicting
decisions by the same judge.
Mr Justice Drake will have the consolation of knowing that although
the appeal court is bound to rule he was wrong, it will also have to
decide that one of his decisions was right.
The Scottish media will be hoping for a decision that brings a degree
of logic and common sense to the law, and puts a halt to blatant forum
shopping in cases which have only the most tenuous links with the
English system.
Of course, the same result could be achieved if some degree of sanity
was restored to libel law in England.

THE FIVE GIANTS: A Biography of the Welfare State
By Nicholas Timmins
HarperCollins: #25
WHAT to do about the welfare state is a question which divides
politicians and parties. It is arguably the question of our time. This
book sets out what was, where we are now, and explains how we got there.
Nicholas Timmins has a tale to tell and tells it well. It is the best
sort of journalism, and that is a compliment. He makes the context
simple and never loses the storyline. The book is properly called a
biography. It does not get immersed in social theory buried under
statistics.
It is accurate, well-written, and always interesting. Do not be put
off by the apology in the preface. It may be ''effectively England's
story'' -- but the lessons are for all of us.
The story, as all stories should, starts at the beginning. Beveridge
is a strangely inaccessible figure from the wing-collar, top-hat age.
The son of a judge in India (brought up in a house with 26 servants) and
brother-in-law of R H Tawney, he combined arrogance with a faith in
statistics.
Almost immediately he set out his stall calling for a national health
service, child allowances funded by the state, full employment. It was
that simple -- ''a time for revolutions not patching''. The foundation
was the social insurance principal securing a minimum for all without
means testing.
The public was ready for it. The war had changed everything. Nicholas
Timmins points out that a Tory victory in 1945 would have brought some
form of welfare state. Churchill was reluctant and disinterested; but he
was the first politician to promise cover from ''the cradle to the
grave'' and to bring ''the magic of averages to the rescue of
millions''.
In fact, the change in expectations made welfare development
inevitable and a Tory victory impossible. The Beveridge report outsold
every other HMSO publication till Denning on Profumo. Labour had a
majority of 146.
Churchill put Butler at the Board of Education with instructions not
to legislate but to bring a note of patriotism to the classroom --
''tell the children that Wolfe won Quebec''. The result was the 1944
Education Act and a new start for England, a country ill provided with
schooling.
The health service was the great adventure with Bevan's epic battle
with medicine's vested interests. A former secretary of the BMA saw it
as ''the first step to National Socialism''. As in late January 1948 the
no vote among doctors was a resounding 86%. Remarkable staying power was
needed before at last Dr Charles Hill recognised that ''his army had
started to go home.''
Other battles followed. There were the days when we never had it so
good. Barbara Castle confronted the doctors in 1968 over pay beds. It
was the last serious threat to withdraw from the NHS. The result was a
great expansion in private hospitals.
Nicholas Timmins labels Barbara Castle as ''the patron saint of
private medicine''. Even more surprisingly, social security saw ''almost
unremitting expansion'' under Keith Joseph. Lady Thatcher as Secretary
of State for Education closed more grammar schools than any other
occupant of that post and according to her adviser hated the department
ever after.
Public attitudes vary depending on what part of the welfare state is
under scrutiny. Social security is a sitting target. Attacking
scroungers pays dividends, suggesting the public firmly believe in the
undeserving poor. The health service on the other hand commands loyalty.
In 1987 Lady Thatcher, while looking hard at plans to replace the NHS
with an insurance-based system, had for public consumption to protest it
was safe in her hands.
The first period was building -- largely by Labour. By 1950 the
Conservatives were claiming the welfare state as their own. Until the
mid-seventies consensus ruled, although change was coming. The
significant date may be April 1974 when Keith Joseph underwent a
conversion -- ''I had thought I was a Conservative but now I see I was
not one at all''. By 1979 the ''ideological blizzard'' had started to
blow.
Some critics see the welfare state as a burden this country could
never carry. Correlli Barnett takes that apocalyptic view. Marshall Plan
aid intended for industrial investment was to be misspent on hospitals.
It is a theory rejected here. There were many other reasons for
comparative decline such as outdated industrial practices and the
reluctance to surrender great-power status.
The welfare state is not just a matter of accountancy. The means-test
man was ''feared into the nation's soul''. The evidence of the appalling
social cost resulting from the inability to afford medical treatment is
graphically recorded.
The growth of educational opportunity was not inevitable. An elitist
approach was entrenched and still lingers on. The comprehensive system
was a statement of principal and Timmins underlines from his own family
experience the significance of the first Kinnock for a thousand years
getting a university education.
The surprise perhaps is the extent to which the welfare state is still
with us alive and kicking in that in the Thatcher years it had many
narrow escapes. The think tanks, Milton Friedman's vouchers, the slow
death of the state pension, were and may still be on the agenda.
There are many who still agree with Kingsley Wood that the ''weekly
progress of the millionaire to the post office for his pension would
have an element of farce''. The Lady herself was prejudiced even on the
health service. Roy Griffiths of Griffiths Report fame felt ''she would
have liked to get away from it. If it had not been there she would never
have invented it''.
In the end though much did survive, if only to fight another day. It
would be nonsense to suggest that the Beveridge blueprint was still
right in every detail. Society has changed mightily -- soon there will
be more women at work than men, one third of children are now born out
of wedlock, present levels of unemployment were unacceptable in
Beveridge's day.
The safety net he designed for the few now supports 10 million people
on income support. Dependency and the means test are all too familiar.
All this means change was inevitable -- but not demolition.
What is clear is that the welfare debate splits parties. In Labour's
ranks there are traditionalists who would alter nothing, and others who
recognise that change must come -- and quickly. Even for them, the
arithmetic of reform is hard to take.
One of Nicholas Timmins' heroes is Kenneth Clarke, described as the
Conservatives' own ''Nye Bevan'' -- an accolade earned by resisting, as
Minister of Health, Mrs Thatcher's more damaging instincts. He has said:
''I am not remotely interested in dismantling the welfare state. I spent
my entire lifetime seeking to modernise it, seeking to give it a chance
of survival.''
The trouble is that Kenneth Clarke looks dangerously isolated in his
party. Michael Portillo and Peter Lilley rule; scapegoat politics are in
fashion, as single parents know. Ministers argue, on the experience of
recession, that welfare provision at present levels is permanently out
of reach. Arbitrary financial targets are set as acts of ideology.
Mr Lilley does not believe in the big-bang approach but there are
other forms of destruction. Serps almost went in the Fowler review but
limped on badly damaged. A search through the Government Actuaries'
figures and the small print in the current pensions legislation reveals
that a scheme expected to pay out #19.4bn in 2050 is to shrink to
#9.9bn. Now indeed has come a time of danger.
Timmins has a point of view. He puts it right at the start of his
story. His history of the welfare state is dedicated to his children
''in the hope that as and when they need it it will still be there''.
The bulwark must be the support of a public that shares that hope.

IT was all supposed to be different after the leadership election and
the Cabinet reshuffle. Mr Major gambled by staging an event important
enough to mark a historic pause and, by and large, won his gamble. Two
of the subsidiary consequences of his victory were supposed to be --
first, no more banana skins, and second, no more party infighting.
The former was supposed to be taken care of by the appointment of Mr
Michael Heseltine to supervise just about everything, a more streetwise
party chairman in Dr Brian Mawhinney, and a hopefully tougher Chief Whip
in Mr Alastair Goodlad.
Although almost immediately there were stories that various Cabinet
Ministers were unhappy at Mr Heseltine's writ to look over their
shoulders running into every nook and cranny in which the First
Secretary of State's fertile brain saw political danger or advantage, it
soon became clear that he had not got very far with the Treasury.
By his ''early bird'' decision to accept the report of the Greenbury
Committee (before it had been published) to tax executive share options
as income rather than capital gains, Mr Clarke precipitated a political
crisis and put his own reputation into nosedive mode as this decision,
it soon transpired, hit many owners of a modest amount of share options
much harder than the privatised fat cats he was supposed to be after.
It was characteristic of a Government in deep trouble that when
following the ''storm of protest'' beloved by some journalists, Mr
Clarke decided to put things right he made a pig's ear of it.
Abolishing retrospection he did restore the position of the modest
shareholders but it also left the fat cats where they were and any
future fat cats only #2400 worse off. It also struck a blow at the
Tories' proud boast to be the party of the small shareholder.
Making this retraction, the normally ebullient Chancellor looked as
subdued and fed-up as I have seen him. Admittedly, it was one of those
muggy days of which we have had too many. But even the self-confident Mr
Clarke must have realised that there was political failure here.
The Treasury had been keen to make the tax change and when the word
came through about Greenbury the officials doubtless saw this as a
wonderful excuse for doing what they wanted to do anyway.
But that is one of the reasons why Ministers are there. To say to
their officials -- ''yes, that's all very fine but politically it
stinks''.
The most successful Ministers are those who can read a Civil Service
brief and say: ''That's very good, but it's also no good and we are not
doing it.''
Share options is in the classic banana skin mould because it is a long
runner. Angry Tory MPs are going to demand further changes in the
November budget and the debate should last beyond that, so it will have
a shelf life of six months or more which is pretty good for a banana.
Nor has the ever-increasing imminence of the General Election caused
the various Tory groups to seize the same hymnsheet and start singing.
The right wing are pressing for public spending cuts, the consequences
of which the left wing claim would outweigh the advantages of the tax
cuts they are designed to make room for.
A more interesting debate is going on between those who want the
Chancellor to increase substantially tax allowances targeted at what are
thought to be Conservative-inclined groups of voters and those who think
that nothing can beat the impact of a simple 2p off the standard rate.
The right, having failed to get the leader they wanted, are determined
to put the policy handcuffs on the one they have and have flooded the
party conference agenda with Euro-sceptic and huge tax-cut motions.
The reshuffle may have brought some benefits. Mr Rifkind already seems
to have been an accomplished Foreign Secretary for ages, but then he's
been practicing so long.
The swop of Mr Stephen Dorrell and Mrs Virginia Bottomley could work
to the advantage of both health and national heritage departments and Mr
Michael Forsyth's bustling approach to the Scottish Office will demand
more than a few jibes from the Opposition parties.
The Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election defeat is being talked
up by Conservative Central Office as illustrating the turn of the tide.
But having more of your core vote staying faithful is not going to be
much good in a General Election if you still come third or, indeed
second. What does seem clear from the low by-election turnouts is that
there are quite a lot of disenchanted voters out there.
That is only moderately good news for the Conservatives. First Mr
Blair also has the chance to enchant them and, if they decide to resist
all spells and not vote, Labour can win well on a low turnout.
Leaving sophisticated calculations aside, one might reflect that in
politics, as in war, the side towards which the civilian population flee
may be taken to be the best or anyway the least bad of the combatants.
In politics, the number of Tory MPs abandoning their present
constituencies for safer ones is analogous. Rather a lot of them have
started to try to make their escape.  Do they know something we don't?

WHEN I grow up I want to be an assessor for the National Heritage
Memorial Fund. Not only do you get treated like arriving royalty by
assorted supplicants, but people insist you drop by for some serious
food and the finer kind of wines. Or so it seems from the state visit of
the NHMF troops this time last week. The hospitality of the National
Museums has paid off handsomely, the presentation of their fund-raising
and business plans resulting in full payment of the #7.2m requested
towards fitting out the new Museum of Scotland.
Less publicised was the dinner given by the National Galleries, who
will be seeking more than twice that amount to ensure that the National
Gallery of Scottish Art and Design moves from the debate and
consultation stage to long-awaited reality in time for the Year of
Architecture and Design in 1999. Unveiled that night was a model
prepared by architects Page and Park of possible options for the
conversion of the Post Office building in Glasgow's George Square -- now
the preferred site from the final short leet.
The brief given Page and Park must have been music to their ears.
Because the final building will be the subject of an architectural
competition, they were given leeway to use more artistic licence than
usual for an initial concept; positively encouraged to think creatively
and come up with the kind of ideas which would give people confidence in
the scheme and increase the enthusiasm quotient all round.
In the event it was one of their more casually pitched notions which
caught the collective imagination of everyone who has seen it.
In essence they've posed the question of what would happen if they
removed the fairly handsome but undeniably staid George Square facade,
replacing it with a glass frontage. Behind that would lie a space taking
up some half of the existing building, housing a sculpture park and
various leisure facilities. And behind that again would be the main
galleries. In David Page's view this immediately makes the gallery
inviting to the public, immediately gives one of Scotland's great civic
squares an indoor/outdoor option, and creates the kind of informality
not always associated with public institutions. Edinburgh's Festival
Theatre is a potent reminder of just how transforming the use of glass
in imaginative ways can be.
So if the NHMF gives its backing, and the Glasgow Development Agency
gets the input it expects from European development funds, Scotland
could get the double up . . . a new museum and a new national gallery
both in place before the millennium. It's the kind of thought to soothe
more than a few feathers ruffled by tens of millions being thrown at
London-based opera.
As with all wondrous schemes there is, of course, a small snag. The
building still has a for-sale sign on the frontage and the Post Office
has indicated that offers will close at the end of August. And in order
for all the other parts of the funding jigsaw to fall into place, the
GDA will have to acquire an option on the site before the National
Galleries can pass round the hat and set up the competition.
My understanding is that the district valuer considers the building
worth #3m, a relatively small investment in a gallery which will
ultimately cost around #25m. So, in a sense, the whole scheme is
contingent on chairman Kenneth Graham and his board agreeing to the
option in order to let the project proceed to the next stage. Since the
Post Office is still a public body, albeit by the skin of its
parliamentary teeth, Mr Graham will want to make a decision in the
public interest.
And it's very difficult to see a more attractive deal for the public
than the creation of a new gallery. The alternative -- handing over to a
developer to create yet another half-empty office block -- hardly sets
the pulses racing.
But in any case there is a sound economic case to be made for the PO
board going down the gallery route. The business plan for the gallery,
allowing for the novelty wear-off factor, still reckons on visitor
numbers of at least 850,000 a year.
The project intends, through shops and catering facilities, to relieve
them of some of their hard-gotten gains which may make a substantial
dent in the #1.5m annual running costs which will be requested from the
Scottish Office. But equally seductive is the thought of some 400 new
jobs in one of the sectors from which the Government and the tourist
board both hope for steady growth.
All of which pragmatic thoughts should not let us forget the
underlying cause for excitement: the thought that, at last, so many
works of Scottish art will be freed with one bound from the storeroom
and housed in a part of Scotland where half the population will have
reasonably ready access. And already some private collectors have
promised major donations to add to that.
The trustees hope to install part of the original Hamilton Palace,
being given by the Metropolitan Museum in New York to our National
Museums, but which is surplus to their requirements. The Mackintosh
Ingram Street tearooms will be installed a stone's throw from their
original incarnation. Add to that photography and design and we have a
really worthwhile addition to our National Galleries.
I rather envy Kenneth Graham. Not many people get the chance to play
Godfather to a national institution. Or should it be midhusband? It's
been a hell of a long pregnancy this one, Mr G. Time to write the birth
announcement for a much-anticipated cultural baby.

yesterday as President Omar Hassan al-Bashir attended a meeting inside
the building, the Sudan news agency Suna reported. Police fired teargas
to disperse the students who battered a ministerial car to protest at
the presence of Bashir, who seized power from a democratically elected
government in a 1989 coup.

LOS ANGELES: Waterworld, Universal Pictures' $200m gamble, shot to the
top of the box office charts yesterday, but the film's debut was less
spectacular than other blockbuster films this summer. According to
industry estimates, Waterworld grossed about $21.6m at the weekend,
easily beating the No. 2 entry, The Net.

It may be summer recess, writes Stephen McGinty, but the parliamentary
debates go on as two Tories fire parting shots at the Westminster
system.
MAYBE it's the weather. Less than two weeks into Parliament's summer
recess two Conservative MPs have announced they will not be standing in
the next General Election. First there was George Walden, former
Government Minister and MP for Buckingham, who last week fired off a
resignation letter loaded with buckshot aimed to strike at both the
Conservative Government and the parliamentary system.
Walden, 55, a former diplomat, said he found himself ''implausible''
as a Tory MP after 12 years in the Commons. He said the public were
treated ''like infants'' and he himself was to behave ''like a child in
a school team''. The House of Commons was, he felt, increasingly
archaic.
In an article for yesterday's Independent On Sunday he wrote of the 10
o'clock rule -- the time when a vote must be held: ''It is especially
sad to watch ministers troop through the lobbies in the late evening,
like so many hollow-eyed shamanists, in purblind deference to obsolete
custom. Why do we do it? There is such a thing as the vanity of
eccentricity and the English have it in spades . . .''
And now along comes Dudley Fishburn to say there are too many members
doing the trooping. The Conservative MP for Kensington announced at the
weekend that he would be standing down at the next election because
there were too many MPs and not enough work. He said he felt Parliament
needed fewer members, not more, as would be created by the forthcoming
Boundary Commission changes.
In his resignation letter he wrote: ''We are creating ever more MPs --
at the election there will be 659, that's more than there are
Congressmen and Senators combined in the US -- and then telling them
that they must all be professional, full-time politicians.
''Modern society needs fewer politicians, not more. It is madness we
shall come to regret.''
He added: ''Six hundred and fifty-nine MPs cannot (short of being
outrageous busy-bodies) find enough to do in our small, already
well-governed kingdom. Good heavens, we ran an empire on a great deal
fewer.''
The former executive editor of The Economist embarrassed the
Government in June when he wrote a business briefing for his public
affairs consultancy, Fish-burn Hedges, which advised clients to prepare
for a Labour government. But he insists his decision to step down was
planned months previously.
It has, however, surprised many constituents and politicians as
Fishburn was expected to contest the newly-merged Kensington and Chelsea
seat which is expected to be one of the safest Tory strongholds.
The seat is now expected to attract favourites such as Sir Nicholas
Scott, former Minister of the Disabled and MP for Chelsea; Sir George
Young, the Transport Secretary -- his Ealing Acton seat is affected by
boundary changes; and Norman Lamont, whose Kingston-upon-Thames seat
will be swallowed up.
What is certain is that Fishburn's comments will rekindle the fierce
debate over MPs' workloads. The Jopling reforms initiated earlier this
year now mean a three-day week in Parliament as many Friday sittings
have been abolished. But the whole idea behind the readjustment was to
allow MPs to spend more time working from the constituency offices.
Fishburn has not been the first MP to advocate a cut in the number of
working members of Parliament. Upon his retirement, former minister
Francis Pym wrote in a political book how an increase in constituency
size would have little effect on an MP's case load. The former Foreign
Secretary and Chief Whip, felt an English MP who currently catered for
70,000 constituents could cater for 100,000.
Another argument for reducing the number of MPs involves Europe and
plans for a Scottish assembly. If more work is being handled by Europe
and potential alternative seats of power -- ie, a Scottish assembly --
there should be less for existing MPs to do.
Brian Wilson, MP for Cunninghame North, remains unimpressed by
Fishburn's criticism. ''I think that he has found out that there is more
to do than he had expected, and it has become an irritating intrusion
into his business career. If you take a personal interest in your
constituents and their problems, on top of the work at Westminster,
there is certainly more than enough to do.''
Fishburn's comparison between the American system of government, where
the Senate has 100 members and the House of Representatives 435 members
to govern a population five times that of Britain, is dismissed by
Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party.
Hirst shadowed Bill McCollum, Congressman for Central Florida. ''It's
not a fair comparison. He had a staff of almost 30 who were doing the
sort of things that MPs do for themselves in this country.
''In America there are case workers who handle the congressional
district case load. MPs do it themselves at a constituency surgery. What
Dudley Fishburn says may be true, but it's not a fair statement.''
Hirst also stated that Britain's legislature continues to work longer
hours than any other legislature in Europe. He insists that recent
changes made through the Jopling reforms were to allow members of
Parliament to fulfil properly their functions, which previously they
were unable to do.
''I don't know where Dudley Fishburn will be spending his recess, but
there are a lot of members of Parliament who will be using the month of
September to do some useful work for their constituents.''
It is not only Conservative MPs who believe change is required.
Margaret Ewing, the SNP member for Moray, has submitted proposals to the
Committee of Procedures to cut summer recess. Her new system would see
Parliament sit all year round with the Commons sitting three weeks out
of four.
But change in the House of Commons, like in all other aspects of life,
remains something to be feared.

Battle of the Midges: Gavin Bell reports from the front line of a
conflict that could end untold suffering.
ON A patch of boggy ground in a remote area of Knapdale, a battle of
epic proportions is taking place. It is a kind of War of the Worlds in
miniature, with millions of bug-eyed monsters locked in a desperate
struggle for survival.
The outcome will determine whether humanity may be freed one day from
a scourge that has caused untold suffering and misery in the Highlands
since the dawn of time. For the beasties under attack by hordes of
microscopic parasites are the dreaded Culicoides impunctatus, otherwise
known as . . . midges.
Stuart Heritage, an entomologist with the Forestry Commission, is
hoping for a massacre. Having planned the assault by voracious
snake-like creatures called nematodes, he is counting on them wiping out
tens of thousands of midge larvae. If they prove as effective as they
have been against other forest pests, the prospect of midge-free zones
in the Highlands will emerge from the realms of science-fiction to
blissful fact.
The idea is not to make midges extinct, which is deemed neither
feasible nor desirable, but to banish them from specific areas such as
camping sites and other tourist spots by regular infestations of
nematodes -- creating, in effect, ''no-go'' areas for marauding midges.
''Having seen these particular nematodes in action against other
pests,'' Heritage says, ''we are quite hopeful that they will have the
desired effect on midge larvae.''
The ''desired effect'' is indiscriminate slaughter. For those who
might take a gleeful interest in the process, this is how it works: the
nematodes, less than 1mm long, enter midge larvae through the mouth
parts and release tiny pellets of bacteria that develop into an
infection which kills the larvae within a couple of hours. The nematodes
then feed on the bacteria, in what is known as a symbiotic relationship,
and the cycle is repeated.
Heritage regards it as ''a wonder of nature'', which he is happy to
adapt for the benefit of mankind.
The technique has the added advantage of being natural, and of posing
no threat to the environment. The nematodes are indigenous, they do not
attack plants in any way, and there is no danger of them upsetting the
ecological balance. After decimating insect larvae, they either lose
interest and go into a dormant state, or they die out.
They are also available in commercial quantities for protecting crops,
and so anti-midge patrols in designated areas should cost no more than
treatment with conventional insecticides which has proved ineffective.
The first controlled experiment is taking place on a private estate
near Lochgilphead, at a picturesque spot where a stream flows from a
freshwater loch to the sea. Amid dark green reeds, 10 known midge
breeding grounds are under attack by an estimated 20 million nematodes,
introduced into the peaty soil in watering cans.
The midge larvae, although much bigger, are heavily outnumbered and
virtually defenceless. When Heritage and his associates examine soil
samples in a few weeks' time, they hope to be counting a lot of dead
baby midges.
They are relying on one particular type of nematode, known to the
experts as Steinanema carpocapsae, which has been highly effective
against other notorious pests. Its victims have included pine weevils,
responsible for huge damage to European forests, and leather jackets,
the larvae of daddy longlegs that devour grass and tree roots. They are
presently being used successfully to control blackfly infestation of
mushroom plantations.
Any midge larvae that survive the invasion of the parasites still face
a grisly end. Another offensive is planned for next spring, when small
mesh pyramid tents with lights and fans will be placed over the breeding
grounds. The idea is to lure adult flying midges into traps filled with
a deadly substance -- soapy water -- where their corpses may be counted.
''Eventually we hope to create limited exclusion zones where midges
can no longer exist,'' Heritage says. ''We imagine this will be welcomed
by tourists and anyone else who spends much time out of doors in the
Highlands in the summer.'' It seems a fairly safe assumption.
Unfortunately, there appears to be no prospect of eradicating the
little bloodsuckers entirely. Dr Alison Blackwell of Dundee University,
who is assisting in the project, insists that midges are part of the
natural food chain and that removing them would upset the eco-system. In
any case, it would be virtually impossible, she says.
The only comfort is that we are not alone. Although western Scotland
is particularly badly affected by midges, due to a combination of poor
soils and high rainfall, the only inhabited places in the world not
plagued by them are New Zealand and Patagonia.
At a recent scientific conference in the United States, Heritage was
mystified by repeated references to a pest commonly known there as
''no-seeums''. It took him a while to work out the professors were
talking about midges.
We are blessed with a variety of biting midges -- 37 species to be
precise, of which our friend Culicoides Impunctatus is the most
prevalent. But at least we are not their favourite food. Scientists have
discovered that adult female midges, seeking extra protein to lay eggs,
prefer deer to any other mammal. ''We don't know why,'' Heritage admits.
''It's obviously an acquired taste.''
At one time it was thought they were attracted to rabbits, and several
estates released large numbers of bunnies in the hope they would lure
the midges away from human targets. The experiment was not a success.
Thus the nematodes and their bacteriological weapons may prove to be
the last hope of mankind. While our scientists await the outcome of the
Battle of Knapdale, we may draw encouragement from a literary precedent
-- the Martian invaders in H G Wells's War of the Worlds were also
destroyed by bacteria.

attack by an estimated 20 million nematodes

Brunei, Sunday
BURMESE democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's marrige to a foreigner is
likely to preclude her from ever participating in politics, a Burmese
minister said today.
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw repeated the Rangoon military government's
accusation that Suu Kyi, the daughter of Burma's independence hero
General Aung San, was a pawn of communists when she emerged as a leader
of the democracy movement in 1988.
Suu Kyi, released from almost six years of house arrest on July 10, is
married to British academic Michael Aris.
A constitution currently being drawn up by a military-appointed body
contains a clause barring anyone married to a foreigner from taking part
in politics. It also guarantees the military a ''leading role'' in
politics.
''You must note she has been married to a foreigner and she is
understood to have received some form of foreign assistance,'' Ohn Gyaw
told Reuters in an interview.
He said Burma's 1947 pre-independence constitution, drawn up under
General Aung San's leadership, also had clauses preventing anyone
married to a foreigner taking part in politics.
''You must therefore remember that it is not something new in Myanmar
(Burmese) politics,'' he said.
Suu Kyi was living in Oxford with her husband when, in April 1988, she
returned to Burma to care for her ailing mother just as frustration with
26 years of rigid military rule exploded in a nationwide uprising.
In August that year she took an active role in the democracy movement
and soon emerged as a charismatic leader.
''That happened to be a crucial time when law and order was breaking
down,'' Ohn Gyaw said, referring to the events of 1988.
''Some undesirable elements, particularly the communists, made use of
her,'' he said.
''Before that she did not feature politically at all, although she had
read some books,'' he said.
The 1988 uprising was finally suppressed after hundreds of people, or
even thousands according to some diplomats there at the time, were shot
dead in Rangoon and other towns and cities.
Suu Kyi was detained in July 1989 but the political party she
co-founded went on to win 1990 elections.
The ruling military ignored the election result and instead launched a
crackdown on all opposition to its rule.
Ohn Gyaw is in Brunei to attend this year's annual meeting of foreign
ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) as a
guest of the host country.
On Thursday, Burma took the first step on the road to full membership
of Asean by acceding to its founding treaty.--Reuter.

AS I was saying last week before space ran out, a hideous subversion
of the English language is being perpetrated in Europe these days. The
time has come for some downsizing of this practice.
''Constructive abstention'' (taking the huff and not voting) and
''reference scenario'' (a plan) were examples last week of repellent
jargon. But at least they are only jargon, perhaps even funny in their
own way. A much more insidious linguistic practice now threatens. This
week, in part two of this protest, we move on to examine the European
Union's misrepresentation of truth through persistent distortion of
plain English.
Let us start with ''transparency'' in the Council of Ministers. In
theory the principle of transparency means citizens can see what our
politicians get up to. For example, we can ask for a record of votes,
statements, arguments, criticisms all of which can usually be found in
official council minutes.
When one of my colleagues, John Carvel of the Guardian, asked for
minutes he was refused, to no-one's surprise. Most countries were
horrified at his cheek, Britain among them. His case -- with some
support from the more open Scandinavians -- is now before the European
Court of Justice where he is on a near-certain winner.
But the best part of that case was the reply given to a Euro-MP who
asked for reasons why the council was withholding information. He was
told: sorry, they are also a secret.
This, remember, is the same council which decided to be more
transparent by having televised sessions. Politicians merely used their
air time to bore the pants off Europe with scripted monologues. On one
occasion the camera was mistakenly left running and great was the panic
when Ministers realised the interesting stuff was going out live to a
fascinated press room. So much for transparency.
And then there is ''openness'' in the European Commission. This is a
buzzword which, when spoken by commission officials famed for their
inbred reticence, comes through a twisted lip. Openness, like democracy
in Scotland, is a new-fangled concept, more apparent than real. We all
know that in theory it exists but in the real world it is illusory.
For most of its life until the 1980s the European Union (EEC as was
then) rubbed along without much trouble from journalists. Most of the
Brussels press corps had gone native and joined the Euro-glee club. Much
of the British press was represented in Brussels by a coterie of
freelance reporters whose biggest challenge -- usually before lunch --
was to explain great contemporary issues such as whether Dundee cake
would be banned if it did not come from Dundee.
But as the EU became politicised its affairs attracted more coverage,
to the point that almost 1000 reporters are now happy to ruffle
bureaucratic Euro-feathers and poke an inquisitive nose into what was a
cosy, self-serving institution. In response to growing mischief-making
by the press corps, the commission has been expanding its spokesman's
service.
In Brussels a spokesman is called a porte-parole, literally a word
carrier. These spokesmen (and women) have a big responsibility in
carrying word of the EU's workings. When coverage displeases
commissioners they sometimes respond by shooting the porte-parole. But
the proclaimed policy of openness has spoiled that practice. Now
commissioners have to live with more independent-minded spokesmen, many
of whom were working journalists until taking the commission's shilling.
They have the dangerous habit of telling the truth where, before, they
were bureaucrats. And professional journalists don't take so easily to
being shot.
After widespread public suspicion of Maastricht the commission decided
to embrace openness. The game should be to encourage the word-carrier to
be more open, more available.
This has worked but only to some extent. Reticence was the rule under
the Delors presidency when reporters had to speak French only in
official briefings or go unbriefed. That battle has been won, at least
to some extent, with English now having equal status with French.
Reporters can now even speak in their own mother tongue -- but, mind
you, only on Wednesdays and they still don't receive a translation in
Swedish for reasons too complicated to explain.
Bosnia is also a treasurehouse of linguistic abuse. This is the land
which gave us the notion of the ''safe'' area. A safe area is also known
as an enclave in which the people who don't wish to be raped, killed,
ethnically cleansed, or dumped in concentration camps are permitted to
live in ''peace'' because Nato will come to their aid, maybe. History
has shown that there is some confusion here: someone has only belatedly
told the Bosnian Serbs that people in safe areas are not meant to be
used for target practice.
The Serbs know they can ignore this advice because they have
experience of another example of EU nomenclature being a travesty of
spectacular proportions. This is the so-called UN Protection Force
(Unprofor) whose job is to protect aid workers in the ''safe'' areas.
The fact that Unprofor has shown itself about as effective as a
one-legged man at an arse-kicking party (copyright D Thatcher) does not
cause its political masters to blush. It must be the only protection
force in the world which needs its own protection force alongside.
Which leads us neatly to the Rapid Reaction Force. This is the same
force which was set up rapidly some weeks ago. The speed of its impact
in Bosnia suggests it is not all that rapid but it sure is reactionary.
It began moving in to Bosnia last week after helpfully advertising its
pending arrival to the Bosnian Serbs.
By the time this column appears I shall be on holiday. My final duty
before the summer break took me to the new Council of Ministers offices
in Brussels. It is properly called the Justus Lipsius building, after a
Euro-worthy. I am happy to report another linguistic distortion, but one
of which I approve. The place is now known, naturally, as Just Lip
Service.

Brussels, Sunday
FROM Spain to Greece and even up to normally brisk Britain a grinding
heatwave has pushed temperatures well above 100F in some places and has
been blamed for dozens of deaths and devastating brush fires across the
Mediterranean.
No major cooling off is forecast, but many Europeans have simply
abandoned their steamy cities.
The annual August holiday exodus began over the weekend and roads to
beaches and mountain resorts were clogged in Italy and France. At a toll
gate outside Venice, the backup was nearly six miles yesterday.
Those remaining behind sought relief in air-conditioned theatres,
parks or over cool drinks.
Europe's scorching summer has produced death and misery.
In southern Spain, temperatures have exceeded 40C (104F) for the past
three weeks hitting 45C (113F) last week in Seville and Cordoba. Local
media reports the heat has killed at least 33 people, mostly the
elderly.
Blazing heat also has hampered Spanish crews fighting the seasonal
rash of brush fires.
Pollution worries also are high in Athens. Weeks of hot and stagnant
weather has brought air quality to dangerous levels.
Italian authorities have issued warnings as pollution levels rise,
especially in Rome. At least nine deaths have been blamed on weeks of
relentless heat.--AP.
The heatwave has returned to America. At Palm Springs, California,
temperatures reached 115F yesterday.
Chicago, where 546 people died of heatstroke two weeks ago, is up to
95F again and local authorities are preparing for the worst. In Arizona,
temperatures reached 115F.

Kinshasha, Sunday
ZAIRE'S government today blamed a veteran radical leader loyal to the
memory of murdered independence prime minister Patrice Lumumba for
weekend political violence which killed 10 people.
Information Minister Masegabio Nzanzu told state radio that security
forces fired on demonstrators yesterday after Antoine Gizenga, leader of
the Unified Lumumbist Party (Palu), organised a violent march on
parliament with the aim of taking power.
But the mainstream radical opposition, at the forefront of
pro-democracy protest in the early 1990s, denounced the shooting as
''banditry'' and said it would press ahead with its own plans for a
campaign of anti-government action from Tuesday.
''An M16-style rifle was found with the barrel still warm at Mr
Gizenga's house. Among the wounded soldiers, two were shot,'' Nzanzu
said. ''He had announced the systematic organisation of actions on the
ground with the aim of taking power.''
Justice Minister Nsinga Udjuu said Gizenga, a member of independence
hero Lumumba's government, had not sought permission for the march and
had been held for questioning.
Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo, popular in the West for his efforts to
clean up Zaire's corruption-plagued economy, called a special cabinet
meeting today to discuss the unrest which killed nine civilians and a
gendarme and wounded 47 people.
But the mainstream Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allies
(Usoral), which says its leader Etienne Tshisekedi was unlawfully ousted
as prime minister when parliament chose Kengo in July 1994, vowed to go
ahead with its own protests.
''The dictatorship and the team of Mr Kengo . . . are very much
mistaken if they think they can stop the actions Usoral plans from
August 1,'' Kibassa Maliba, leader of its supporters in parliament, said
in a statement.
Zaire's tortuous transition to democracy has been comparatively
peaceful since 1993, when five people died in scattered political unrest
and when rioting soldiers rejecting wages paid with a discredited new
banknote killed 65 people.
Yesterday's incident evoked memories of a February 1992 democracy
protest by the Sacred Union and other church groups during which veteran
leader Mobutu Sese Seko's presidential guard fired on marchers killing
at least 32 of them.
Interior Minister Gustave Malumba Mbangula said Palu militants killed
a gendarme at the People's Palace parliament yesterday and went to
Gizenga's home ''with a view to collecting him and installing him in
power at the People's Palace''.
A spokesman for Palu, not a part of Usoral but bitterly opposed to
Mobutu, said it simply wanted to march to parliament and that security
force bullets had killed the gendarme.
Yesterday's marchers were angry over election delays.
Mobutu, whose supporters hold a majority in parliament, ruled
unchallenged after seizing power in 1965 until bowing to pressure from
home and abroad for democracy in 1990.
But parliament voted in June to extend the transition by two more
years after acknowledging that elections could not be held in time for
the scheduled July 9 end of the transitional period.--Reuter.

FOR those who have to travel on the M8 into Glasgow every day, claims
that the city's airport is suffering from congestion fatigue will come
as no surprise.
Daily queues at the approaches to the Kingston Bridge have been a
regular feature but they have become chronic recently because of
extensive roadworks designed to increase the motorway's capacity.
However, Edinburgh Airport has its own set of traffic problems at the
Newbridge roundabout and it has looked as if both airports would
continue to prosper with similar growth rates of around 8%.
That belief has been turned on its head with the latest figures from
Scottish Airports, showing that passenger traffic in Edinburgh has
increased by roughly 9% this year, while Glasgow struggles with a growth
rate of less than 1%.
What has set alarm bells ringing is the realisation that the trend is
likely to accelerate when Edinburgh's motorway problems are solved in a
couple of months with the opening of the M8 extension to the city
by-pass.
Mr Vernon Murphy, managing director of Scottish Airports Ltd, believes
business travellers living on the east side of Glasgow and in the middle
ground of Perth and Stirling have had enough and are heading for
Edinburgh.
''We do monthly monitoring of passengers to find out where they are
coming from,'' said Mr Murphy. ''And the trend is apparent. It is not a
deluge but it is a distinct switch.''
Glasgow's problem is that the airport is marooned on the south side of
the river with only the wholly inadequate Kingston Bridge to feed the
vast majority of travellers from the north.
Motorists travelling down the M8 are funnelled into a couple of lanes
at the approach to the short tunnel under Charing Cross. There are large
stretches without a hard shoulder and it only takes one breakdown for
slow-moving traffic to become stranded altogether.
The uncertainty caused by the breakdown risk is what separates the
Kingston Bridge from Newbridge roundabout at the other end of the M8,
says Mr Murphy.
Despite the well-publicised delays at Newbridge, there is access for
recovery vehicles. That ensures traffic keeps moving towards Edinburgh.
That view is confirmed by the Automobile Association. Ms Elaine Berry,
Roadwatch co-ordinator, says: ''There are always delays on the M9
outside Edinburgh and the M8 coming into Charing Cross. But in Glasgow
it can be very difficult for recovery vehicles to get to broken-down
traffic.''
The problem is larger than just the Charing Cross congestion, says Mr
Murphy. ''This is not about communications into the city; it is about
the strategic road movement from the West of Scotland.
''If Glasgow wants to maintain its position as the lead airport in
Scotland then it really has to think about the longer-term access
problems and get them fixed,'' he said.
''The motorway network around Edinburgh is well on the way to being
sorted out. The motorway network around Glasgow is not.''
He warns that airlines will inevitably switch capacity to deal with
demand. British Airways carried one million passengers on its Edinburgh
to London route last year and in April introduced larger aircraft to
cope with the demand.
''The long-term future will depend on what happens,'' he added.
''Aircraft are very mobile. They are the most mobile asset a company can
have. And we will invest in Glasgow or Edinburgh to meet the market
requirement.''
Lothian Regional Council is also pushing ahead with plans for a rapid
transport scheme, running on dedicated lines, between the airport and
the city. The #35m scheme, which will cut journey times to an estimated
11 minutes, will go before Parliament later this year.
While the upgrading work on the M8 in Glasgow will help reduce traffic
pressure, it is widely accepted that it is a short-term fix and the M8
cannot cope. Motorists still face years of disruption with work on the
Kingston Bridge due to start in January.
To address the long-term problem, an application to build the northern
extension of the M74 is expected to go before Glasgow District Council's
planning committee later this year and Strathclyde region is working up
plans for a rail link to the airport.
Neither proposal is yet a certainty and there is likely to be strong
opposition to the M74 extension from local campaign groups concerned
about the proposed route.
Strathclyde region's director of roads, Mr Don Carruthers, said he did
not accept that the motorway network was strangling Glasgow Airport.
''Most people want to travel to the airport by road and what we need
is improved road connections.
''We have applied for planning permission for the M74. It is a vital
element in access to west-central Scotland. It will help to relieve
congestion within Glasgow and on the M8.
''I will accept that the fact that we are doing roadworks causes some
inconvenience but it is being done to improve the capacity of the
motorway.
''We should have the Kingston Bridge completed by the year 2000. We
reckon there is around #35m of reconstruction work needed on the
motorway when we have finished our capacity enhancements within
Glasgow.''

Moscow, Sunday
CHECHEN rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev today repudiated a military
agreement his representatives signed with Russian delegates to stop
fighting in the rebel region, Russian television said.
''Dudayev disavowed the document signed today in Grozny,'' Independent
Television's Itogi programme said, quoting an interview the rebel leader
gave to Radio Liberty a few hours after the deal was signed.
A Radio Liberty correspondent contacted by telephone confirmed the
report.
''Dudayev said the Russian side had somehow used trickery and threats
to make the Chechen delegation sign the military agreement,'' Itogi
said, quoting the radio interview.
It said Dudayev said he had not been able to contact the Chechen
delegates to the talks for six days, indicating that he had not seen the
contents of the deal, signed early today.
The report throws serious doubt over the agreement, hailed as a major
step on the way to solving the conflict in the rebel region which has
cost thousands of lives in more than seven months of fighting.
Itar-Tass news agency earlier quoted chief Chechen delegate Usman
Imayev as telling reporters the deal, which includes a pledge for an
immediate end to the fighting, had been agreed with Dudayev.
The agreement provided for an immediate end to hostilities,
disengagement of forces on each side and a programme of disarming by
Chechen fighters which would be matched by a gradual pullout by Russian
troops.
The deal represented the first real progress in peace talks called to
end the conflict in which thousands of people have died.--Reuter.

Eilat, Israel, Sunday
ISRAELI and PLO peacemakers resumed negotiations today aimed at
expanding Palestinian rule in the West Bank six days after an Islamic
suicide bomber blew up an Israeli commuter bus.
The two sides opened the talks at a hotel in the Israeli Red Sea
resort of Eilat after meeting separately.
Troops barred reporters and protesters from approaching the area, but
Jewish settlers opposed to Israel-PLO peace moves said they were
demonstrating a short distance away.
An accord has long been delayed by haggling over issues and Israeli
security concerns, but Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Korei told Reuters:
''We can conclude the talks in days or weeks.
''It all depends on whether the Israelis will meet our concern for
land. We are meeting their concern for security,'' insisted Korei, also
known as Abu Alaa.
The sides must come to terms on a redeployment of Israeli troops away
from Palestinian population areas, control over various spheres such as
water and Palestinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin suspended the talks last Monday for the
funerals of six Israelis killed when a suicide bomber set off a bomb on
a bus in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan.
''We'll have to complete the agreement during the month of August if
the Palestinians are interested in holding elections by the end of
'95,'' Israeli negotiator Uri Savir told Israel Television yesterday.
''How long it'll take, it's hard to know. I think we are close to a
signing,'' Savir said.
Korei said Palestinians had rejected an Israeli proposal to put off
discussion on the division of water, among the thorniest issues in the
talks, until the two sides begin discussing the final status of the West
Bank and Gaza next year.
''The water problem is very deep,'' he told Reuters. ''There is a
water crisis in the whole region and we will not give up our water
rights.''
Palestinian self-rule, limited to Gaza and Jericho, was to have been
expanded in the West Bank by last July under the terms of a landmark
1993 Israel-PLO peace deal.
Korei said Israel had put forward a timetable for withdrawing Israeli
troops from Arab population centres in the West Bank in stages with the
final pullback due in July 1997. Palestinians want the withdrawal
completed by February 1997.
Another PLO official said some of the negotiators discussing the
transfer of the civil authority to Palestinians in the West Bank would
take their talks to Cairo on Thursday.
He said that they were planning to sign an agreement on that aspect of
Palestinian self-rule in Cairo.
Meanwhile, Rabin told government ministers today he doubted a peace
deal could be reached with Syria before elections in Israel due by
November 1996, his spokeswoman said.
''He said he had serious doubts over the chance of reaching an
agreement with the Syrians before the elections,'' Rabin's spokeswoman
Aliza Goren told Reuters.

A GROUP of mature students is threatening to sue Glasgow Caledonian
University over its handling of a nine-month counselling course which
they claim was never validated by a professional counselling agency as
promised by the university.
The Citizens Advice Bureau in Bath Street, Glasgow, has taken up the
cudgels on behalf of the students who include a GP, a nurse, a nun, a
prison officer.
The students are claiming that the university has breached its
contract with them and are demanding their money back for the part-time
course which cost #885 per person.
They say it was not validated by the Confederation of Scottish
Counselling Agencies (Cosca) as advertised by the university; that they
were taught a completely different syllabus from that paid for; and that
the course was 15 hours less than the one they were contracted to
complete.
The 15 students signed up last October with the Glasgow Caledonian
University Company for a ''certificate course in counselling and helping
skills'', Mr Vincent Chudy, manager of the Bath Street Citizens Advice
Bureau, said. He said the leaflet advertising the course clearly stated
that it had been validated by Cosca.
The problems began to manifest themselves in January, he claimed, when
the course fell 15 hours behind because of the failure of teaching staff
to attend a number of sessions.
The following month the students were told that the teaching staff had
been dismissed and that the course had been contracted out to a private
company called Kinharvie.
Mr Chudy said Professor John Phillips, the univerity's vice principal,
had assured the students in a letter in April that the course had
received Cosca validation and that the question of reimbursement in
these circumstances was ''not normal practice''.
However, Mr Chudy added: ''As yet we have seen no evidence that this
course is actually accredited.''
He said the students had repeatedly asked for compensation because
they believed the university was in breach of contract but the company
had refused to comply with the requests. The CAB had contacted the
Scottish Office Education Department over the matter.
He added: ''The university should stop putting obstacles in the way of
the students and reimburse them. It is quite clear in the circumstances
that they have not received what they paid for.
''It appears likely that they may have to take legal action if a
satisfactory outcome to this matter cannot be achieved.''
One of the mature students, Sister Denise Dunn, who is based in
Glasgow, said:
''I find it quite appalling that a university which runs a company can
treat students the way it has done and effectively lie about the
validation of its courses.''
A university spokesperson said: ''Glasgow Caledonian University
Company is in ongoing discussions with Cosca to ensure that its
counselling course achieves validation.''
She said the university was confident that this would be secured.
It was expected that certificates would be issued retrospectively to
all students who had completed the course following official
confirmation of its validation.
She added: ''The university company understands the students' concern
and, by working closely with Cosca, it is doing everything in its power
to gain validation for the course as quickly as possible.''
No-one from Cosca could be reached for comment.

Labour's Scottish leader George Robertson MP faces a formidable
opponent in new Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth. With the next
General Election campaign already under way, Mr Robertson has been
telling Frances Horsburgh how he views the Scottish political landscape.
Q: Many people still seem uncertain about the Secretary of State's
real agenda. What do you make of Michael Forsyth Mark II and has the
leopard really changed his spots?
A: The style has certainly changed. I think he has got a sense of the
importance of the job and the short time-scale which he has got to make
an impact.
But if you take away the style, which doesn't really matter terribly
much to the Scottish people, you see a man who first of all announces
the water quangos -- which are taking over the council-run services --
with a minority of elected councillors on them, who then is consulted
and is unable to do anything about the sacking of James Hann as chairman
of Scottish Nuclear, and who appoints Gerald Warner (the Sunday Times
writer) as his political adviser -- the clearest possible signal that it
is going to be that old hard-right zealot view again.
Q: His other part-time adviser Brian Meek comes from the left of the
party. Doesn't that mean anything?
A: I think that appointment is symptomatic of this change of style
which is slightly quirky and of a reliance maybe on the stunt. The fact
that the paid adviser is going to be someone like Gerald Warner has left
most commentators aghast and was the key signal.
I hope he listens to Brian Meek. I am told Mr Forsyth is going to
speak to the Tory Reform Group. I hope he listens to them and acts on
it. Then we might see something different. But I think the jury is still
out. In fairness, he should be given a chance. He says he is going to
listen and, if he listens, he will get a pretty unanimous view from
practically every part of Scotland. What matters is not the listening,
it is the doing once he has listened.
Q: Isn't it true that the very combative Michael Forsyth will prove a
more formidable opponent for you and your colleagues than his
predecessor the blander, more laid back Ian Lang?
A: I think the problem for the Conservatives is not with the
personalities at the top but with the policies. The Tory party didn't
plummet because Ian Lang was Secretary of State, the rot set in earlier
than that, and many people, including many in the Tory party, put the
starting point when Forsyth was a Minister in the Scottish Office
before.
It is dangerous to write off Ian Lang who, although he was slightly
laid back, did actually respond in a number of key areas and was not an
ideologist.
Is Forsyth as ideologically committed as before? Well it seems quite
clear that his reverence for Mrs Thatcher goes on, and yet she is one of
the principal reasons why the Tories have become alienated from the
Scottish people. There is no reason to believe that the agenda he set in
train is something he considers to have stopped now.
I think a lot of people in Scotland will say this sounds better --
nicer -- newer, but is it all just to soften us up, and if he wins the
election it will be back to basics again.
Another consequence of Forsyth's arrival is going to be that the
Scottish Nationalists will be marginalised in Scottish politics. We are
now in the pre-election run-up. It is really very much going to be the
Tories, as represented by Michael Forsyth in Scotland, and the Labour
Party as the alternative government on display. I think some of the
phoney war that took place because the Tories had opted out will now
diminish.
Q: What about his attacks on Labour's ''tartan tax''. Could they not
prove effective?
A: The only tartan tax there has been was the poll tax, which came
into Scotland a year before it came into the rest of the country. I
don't fear the idea of a campaign based on the tartan tax when he has
got to defend 20 Tory taxes since the last election.
Q: The Scottish Secretary has surprised many people by saying he wants
to give powers back to local government, and for councils to devolve
more decision-making down to local communities. What is your reaction?
A: I think he is trying to give a little bit more power back to the
Scottish Tories at the local level. This is the first time in Scottish
history when the Conservative interest has had no council at all in
Scotland, and this after they crafted the new unitary system
specifically for their benefit. It must puzzle and disappoint him, so I
think he is now trying to penetrate back in here in the hope that will
spin off some success at a Parliamentary level.
It is very unspecific -- more power to local government, but he says
the water quangos will still have only a minority of councillors. He
says councils will not get further education colleges back and they are
not going to have anything to do with health.
Q: It seems a real possibility that the capping of council budgets by
the Government could end under Mr Forsyth. Presumably Labour would
welcome that.
A: We have said that the tough capping restrictions which have existed
will have to be looked at. The England and Wales document talks about
removing them but retaining some reserve powers, so in a way he is
catching up with the reality of what is happening elsewhere.
The Scottish Labour Party is looking at the policy separately to the
party down south, and I am hoping that we will produce some more
imaginative policies for the powers of local government.
I think there is a genuine feeling and I think Forsyth is actually
spotting it, a real resentment that local government is now so
circumscribed by detailed bossing around by the centre that they can
avoid responsibility for an awful lot.
If you look at the way in which Strathclyde region wasn't capped last
year it was symptomatic of the system failing. We argued strongly that
the cap on Strathclyde was unfair. It seemed vindictive, and when
Strathclyde defied the Government, the Government climbed down. I think
that must have told Forsyth and his advisers that the system is wrong,
not just the policy.
But if he thinks removing capping is an ambushing tactic -- if he
really seriously believes that councillors are going to be conned away
from the idea of a Scottish Parliament by giving them back a few
sweeties from the lorry-load of sweets that he has stolen from local
government, I think it is a profound misjudgment.
The way in which local government has had its powers raided
systematically by the Tories has weakened local government, and
therefore the Tories, at a local level as well. I think he is wakening
up to that, perhaps before some of his colleagues down south.
Q: Finding ways of democratising quangos seems to be high on the new
agenda at the Scottish Office. What will Labour do about these appointed
bodies which run such large chunks of Scottish life?
A: First of all on the water quangos -- the non-elected members will
be replaced immediately by locally-elected councillors for the areas
that are affected, thereby returning water to the democratic control it
enjoyed for 150 years. It may be too difficult to abolish the actual
water authorities and make them into 12, which is what our suggestion
was. The process may have gone too far down the road.
What matters is democratic accountability, and the ability of people
to influence the very important decisions which will be taken by these
new quangos, but are going to be taken by people who don't ever have to
face the electorate, and who are unknown, in many cases, to the
electorate.
Our look at the health service will change this approach to the
market-based competing trusts. The trusts will be brought back into the
mainstream of the health service. We are looking very carefully at the
moment at how the quangos operate and ultimately, of course, the
Scottish Parliament will have charge of these organisations. It may well
decide to abolish some, to keep some but it will be under a much more
intimate form of control than anything just now.
Although Michael Forsyth says he is going to democratise the quangos,
he is remembered in Scotland for the poll tax, for the market reforms in
the health service, and for the way in which he stuffed the quangos full
of party cronies. These are the three abiding memories people in
Scotland have of him, and it is therefore going be very difficult for
him to change these particular spots.
Q: What do you think of the Forsyth idea of giving a greater role to
the Scottish Grand Committee -- perhaps to allow it to initiate
legislation?
A: Mr Lang went through this whole taking stock exercise. It didn't
impress anybody then. It doesn't impress anybody now. We now have a full
programme of Scottish Grand Committee debates peripatetically moving
around Scotland, basically giving us opportunities to debate, to attack
the Government but primarily showing up the fact that there is nobody on
the Tory back benches and that they are in a permanent minority in
Scotland.
There are very few changes which could now be made which would mean
anything, and secondly they would not satisfy the desire in Scotland for
a devolved Parliament and for decisions being taken in Scotland by
people responsible to the Scottish people.
Q: It has been suggested in some quarters that Labour's drawing back
from setting up regional assemblies in England could be a symptom of
their weakening over the commitment to set up a Scottish Parliament.
Should people who support devolution be concerned?
A: The Shadow Home Secretary -- everybody has made it absolutely clear
that what is being proposed for England stands purely for England and is
based on an assessment of what the English want and has nothing to do
with Scotland.
At every stage in the announcement of this policy, it has been made
clear that Scottish and Welsh devolution will go ahead on the existing
timetable. It seems crazy that people in Scotland are now quibbling
about a structure being suggested for England as if we, in order to
comfort ourselves, have to have the design patented on what is going to
happen in England.
There are going to be regional chambers in England and they can move
beyond that at their own speed to regional assemblies which were
promised. That model was created after lengthy negotiation, discussion
and consultation. Indeed, one of the groups which Jack Straw spoke to
about it was the Scottish group of Labour MPs.
No policy is going to be unanimous and there are still some people in
England who think it goes too far and some who think it doesn't go far
enough but, by and large, we think we have established a proper balance.
Q: Wasn't it one of the benefits of having English assemblies that
they provided an answer to the West Lothian Question -- Scottish MPs at
Westminster being able to vote on English home affairs while their
English counterparts could not do so with regard to matters looked after
by a Scottish Parliament?
A: The West Lothian Question is a red herring. Recent surveys have
shown that English MPs are not bothered by a neat symmetry to what will
happen in Britain after the next election in the way Parliament is run.
The fact is that Westminster will create the structure which will
apply. There is a consensus in the party that the Scottish Parliament
and the Welsh assembly have been thought through, have a strong basis of
support, and should go ahead for legislation in the first session of
Parliament. Even among English Tory MPs, I don't detect a huge outcry
about the so-called West Lothian Question.
The Northern Ireland framework document, which proposes a 90-strong
assembly for Northern Ireland, doesn't mention at all reducing the
voting power of Northern Ireland MPs or their number in the Westminster
Parliament.
Q: The Tory 92 Group has suggested that Exchequer grant for Scotland
should be on a per capita basis. Michael Forsyth has said it will be cut
in this way ''over his dead body''. Is the Scottish Office budget safe
in his hands?
A: He is setting himself some tests in addition to the ones we have
already set him. I think protecting the Scottish Office budget is going
to be a serious test for a right-wing monetarist as he has always been
proud to be. He, in the past, has been happy to be seen as the budget
cutter. How he is going to survive in Cabinet as the budget defender
will be interesting to watch.
What he said is interesting, because he has now completely abandoned
the Ian Lang argument that any form of devolution will be accompanied by
a reduction in the Scottish Office budget. Because he is now saying what
we have said all along, which is that Scotland's budget is based on
needs and not on some per capita basis that some right wingers seem to
think expenditure should be based on.
There are a lot of tests which he has to pass. Listening is one but
acting on that is the other. I think the biggest test he will have to
pass is whether he apologises for the poll tax. Over #1000m of Scottish
taxpayers' money down the drain and a legacy of misery and debt left
behind can't just be erased from his personal computer.
Q: What do you think of the Scottish Secretary's proactive attempts to
save the West Highland railway line?
A: The Fort William sleeper is a casualty, as was Motorail, which has
already closed, of this crazy privatisation of the railway system.
Instead of Mr Forsyth simply adding his weight to saving one service, he
should really be calling for the abandonment of the project itself. That
is the thing he is going to be judged on.
His own constituency depends very much on railway services running
through it. People know that railway privatisation will push up fares
and reduce services.
Q: Apart from devolution, what else is on Labour's agenda at present
in Scotland?.
A: There is a lot happening because we are not complacent. The
election result for Labour in 1992 was not good. If you ask people in
the streets what pecentage they thought Labour got in Scotland, it
varies between about 45% and 65%. It was 39% and therefore we have got
to continue to keep faith with people in the country.
We have to provide imaginative policies which will inspire the
Scottish people. We are in the process of doing that in the health
service, for housing and local government and, most importantly, for
jobs and the economy. Education and training also have a very high
priority.
By the autumn and up to next year's Scottish conference, much more
flesh will be put on the Scottish policy, and people will begin to see
what a Labour government will do immediately and what a Scottish
Parliament might be expected to do to change their lives.

THE 1745 Jacobite rising which culminated in Culloden, although one of
the most significant events in British history, is also one of the most
misunderstood, both in its own times and for its importance today, a
historian claimed yesterday.
The rising was as much a Lowland movement against a centralising
Hanoverian monarchy as a rebellion by Highland clansmen, said Dr Murray
Pittock, of Edinburgh University, who added that the roots of the
present day Scottish nationalist movement were planted firmly in the
eighteenth century.
His theories were presented to a conference in Aberdeen yesterday, as
a call was made on Lewis to the present Government for compensation for
the people of the Highlands and islands for the ''atrocities of the
past''.
The plea came from a former convener of Western Isles IslandsCouncil,
the Rev Donald Macaulay, who said the people of the Highlands and
islands were still suffering today because of the consequences of Prince
Charles Edward Stuart's claims to the throne.
Dr Pittock, reader in English Literature at Edinburgh University and a
Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, has spent three years on
research for a book, The Myth of the Jacobite Clans, to be published
this autumn.
He said: ''A very significant proportion of the Lowlands and the
commercial classes from the towns as well as the agricultural and
fishing groups supported with arms both the '15 and the '45 and in fact
there were more Lowland than Highland troops in both risings.''
His research shows that, in 1715, the Jacobites managed to get an army
of 20,000, virtually the maximum which could have been mustered. The
popular belief was that, 30 years later, the Young Pretender could raise
only 5000 troops. That figure, however, took account only of the army
that invaded England, not the army which remained in Scotland.
''The total number of troops involved was somewhere between 12,000 and
14,000, and I think they did amazingly well, considering they had no
money, no established way of raising troops, and were having to
virtually do it from scratch.''
Dr Pittock said Jacobitism was the only means of expressing Scottish
nationalism after 1707. ''If there was that level of armed discontent,
then it shows that as late as the middle of the eighteenth century
Britain as a political entity wasn't working.''
Dr Pittock believes it is convenient to stand by the false impressions
rather than the facts, because the myths make it seem more distant and
less relevant to political debate.
''In a way, the continued obsession about Jacobitism in Scotland is
because Jacobitism is about unanswered questions and unfinished business
and Scotland's relation to the rest of the United Kingdom.
''Making it a Highland way of life removes it from that and puts it
firmly into the tartan and shortbread camp, when in fact it was
completely different. There were a lot of small Edinburgh tradesmen
willing to risk their lives in the middle of the eighteenth century for
the Jacobite movement.''
Dr Pittock feared that last night's Grampian Television documentary,
Highlanders, which was networked by ITV, perpetuated the wrong picture
of the '45.
The six-day conference, part of Aberdeen University's quincentenary
celebrations, has attracted 170 people from Scotland, England, Ireland,
America, Australia, France, Switzerland, Germany, and Spain.
Dr Pittock feels it will be an uphill battle to change opinion within
the tourism industry, for example, where myths and legends are good
business.
''In the Culloden battlefield, for example, the National Trust for
Scotland present the Hanoverian side in terms of regiments and the
Jacobite side in terms of clans, to make it seem is if it wasn't a
serious military expedition, more a tribal war.''
Interest in Jacobitism is growing and he said this was particularly so
in England.

A TORY MP is stepping down at the next General Election, claiming MPs
could not find enough to do.
Mr Dudley Fishburn, MP for Kensington, had been widely expected to put
his name forward for the new Kensington and Chelsea seat as the number
of MPs expands with boundary changes.
However, in a resignation letter to his constituency, printed in a
Sunday newspaper, he was quoted as saying Parliament needed fewer MPs,
not more.
The changes are set to increase the number of MPs from 651 to 659.
Mr Fishburn, 49, wrote: ''We are creating ever more MPs -- at the next
election there will 659, that's more than there are congressmen and
senators combined in the US -- and then telling them that they must all
be full-time politicians.
''Modern society needs fewer politicians, not more. It is a madness we
shall come to regret.''
Mr Fishburn, who stirred a controversy last month by recommending that
clients of his public affairs consultancy should prepare for a Labour
government, said he reached his decision several months ago.
His comments will intensify the debate over ''lazy'' MPs at a time
when changes to parliamentary hours have effectively led to many working
what amounts to a three-day week at the Commons.

HEALTH workers were warned yesterday by union representatives that
Scottish health trusts and boards might try to by-pass the unions and
carry out their own ballots in a bid to persuade staff to accept locally
negotiated pay deals.
Such a move might undermine unions' claims to represent health workers
at national level and allow the local deals, which unions oppose, to be
implemented.
However, Unison's regional officer, Mr Jim Devine, urged members to
ask themselves whether a local deal would guarantee them an annual pay
rise and leave their conditions intact.
He was confident that his members, who will be balloted by the union
this week, would vote in favour of industrial action short of and
including strike action.
Workers might also be balloted by their trusts on local pay offers,
and they are also likely to face a wave of management publicity aimed at
breaking the current deadlock on the introduction of local pay
bargaining at separate hospitals.
However, it is understood that at a meeting last week between Scottish
trust managers and NHS chiefs, the idea of imposing local agreements on
workers, as has happened in up to 24 English trusts, was rejected.
According to the Department of Health's director of human resources,
Mr Ken Jarrold, a number of steps are being recommended. These include
making staff a payment ''on account'' pending the final agreement.
Mr Devine claimed, however, that the Scottish managers had rejected
such a move as being too inflammatory. However, he said that if they did
impose a settlement, his members would reject it.
''Whatever imposition is, it is not local pay bargaining. The
management and Government should face up to the fact that we are not
going to allow local pay bargaining in the NHS and there is no pressure
from staff to settle for this,'' he said.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said it was up to trusts how they
handled their negotiations. He nevertheless said most trusts had had
their offers on the table for a number of weeks and that staff were now
losing out because no deals had been agreed.
Meanwhile, the Labour MP for Cunninghame South, Mr Brian Donohoe, said
that new figures produced by the House of Commons Library showed that
between March 1993 and September 1994 the number of complaints lodged by
patients with Scotland's health boards and trusts had risen by 33%.
These figures come two weeks after the Health Ombudsman for Scotland
reported that he had dealt with 51% more complaints in 1994-5 compared
to 1990-91.

MR Paddy Ashdown yesterday dismissed reports that he is about to step
down as Liberal Democrat leader as ''bunkum and balderdash''.
He said they were the first fruits of ''the silly season'' when some
newspapers printed highly speculative stories because of a lack of
political news in the summer months.
Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend programme, he said:
''I will stay on as long as I have something to do and as long as the
party will have me.''
The Lib Dem victory in last week's Littleborough and Saddleworth
by-election has taken some of the pressure off Mr Ashdown's leadership.
He showed no signs of letting up on his personal involvement in the
Bosnian crisis.
Mr Ashdown rejected the idea that the Liberal Democrats would be
squeezed out by the two bigger parties at the next General Election.
He said they now had more councillors and controlled more councils
than the Conservatives.
He is to prepare a new policy document for presentation to the party
conference in September.

<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977125599</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WEST coast business forum is being launched today to try to fill the
void in economic development left by the break-up of Strathclyde
Regional Council.
The West of Scotland Chamber Group has been set up to provide a
lobbying voice on regional issues in light of the creation of the new,
smaller unitary authorities. It also wants to take over the
international trade mission role from Strathclyde's business development
unit.
A network of 13 chambers of commerce -- with more than 5000 member
firms -- has created the body, which will continue to take a regional
focus on business development.
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, the driving force in setting up the
group, is worried that the substantial impetus which the council had
made in promoting the region's economy would be lost to the business
community.
Mr Geoff Runcie, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber, said: ''The new
unitary authorities will take a much more parochial view because of
their smaller boundaries. With the demise of SRC, no-one will have the
mandate to look at the bigger regional picture.''
Mr Runcie accepts that SRC had its critics but argues that Strathclyde
Business Development, the council's economic development unit, carried
out an ''extremely worthwhile role''.
He says that, given its successes over the years, ''a huge void'' will
be created, as economic development needs a regional perspective rather
than taking an insular view.
''The new West of Scotland Chamber Group can at the very least provide
a coherent voice to lobby the Scottish Office and Scottish Enterprise on
pan-regional issues.''
Mr Runcie accepts that the chamber movement does not have the capacity
to provide the full range of services provided by Strathclyde Business
Development but he has written to the leaders of the six new authorities
to initiate talks on funding.
In particular, he would like the new grouping to take on
responsibility for the international trade development role.
''This year, SRC is mounting over 30 trade missions overseas, as far
afieldas Singapore, China, and Sri Lanka. They pave the way for West of
Scotland companies to promote their goods in new markets at organised
meetings with key decision makers and with the substantial weight and
experience of Strathclyde backing them,'' said Mr Runcie.
''Imagine a small company based in Coatbridge setting off on a trade
mission to China. When they tell potential buyers they come from
Monklands, the reaction will be so what. You just about get away with
saying you are from Strathclyde -- but it is still hard work.''
Mr Runcie refuses to believe the chambers have bitten off more than
they can chew with this project: ''With the goodwill of the new unitary
authorities, this can be a classic partnership.''

THE days of the traditional parish ministry are numbered, a retired
Scots minister has claimed. The Rev John Sim, writing in Life and Work,
the Kirk's magazine, calls for the Church to use all its members to
promote the Gospel.
Mr Sim says: ''If the Church is to grow in numbers and influence, we
need to use all its servants more advantageously and adventurously.''
He says the financial problems of paying a full-time parish ministry
in the days ahead were starkly outlined at this year's General Assembly
of the Church of Scotland and there was much discussion of new patterns
of ministry.
These might involve part-time ministry, paid auxiliary ministries, and
full or part-time field staff who might be authorised to conduct the
sacraments in specific situations.
''There is no theological reason why a ministry of word and sacrament
could not be conducted by the so-called 'laity' -- which is just another
word for 'God's people'.''
* Dr Tom Manson, an occupational health expert, also writing in the
magazine, disclosed that 250 ministers participated in the past year in
a scheme to advise the Kirk on the health and work of its ministry.
The Church decided in the late 1980s to have ministers examined by
their family doctors every five years and 850 of the Kirk's 1300
ministers took up the initial offer.
It was then decided to appoint an occupational health physician to see
the ministers a second time. Dr Manson took up this position early last
year.

OFFICE workers in Scotland have enjoyed higher pay rises in the past
year than many of their colleagues elsewhere in Britain, according to a
survey published today.
Across Britain, changes brought about by information technology mean
there has been little growth in salaries for relatively unskilled
positions, according to the Brook Street employment agency which
conducted the survey.
However, personal assistants (PAs) have had ''significant'' salary
rises, reflecting the increasing demand for highly-skilled and
technologically-aware staff with strong communications skills.
The figures show that across all office staff in Britain, the average
pay increase was 3.5% compared to the second quarter of 1994. The
biggest rises were in the south-east of England (4.5%) and Outer London
(4.3%) and the lowest in East Midlands (2.9%) and the North of England
(3%).
Scotland showed high salary increases, at an average of 3.7%, which
the agency says ''supports recent reports that point to an increasing
standard of living in Scotland and the correspondingly improving
employment prospects and salaries''.
Across Britain, the increases ranged from less than 1% for office
juniors to almost 6% for chairmen's PAs. Inputting staff received
above-average rewards: 4.5% for word processor operators and 4% for VDU
clerks.
The agency says changes in the division of tasks in the office are
leading to the erosion of some job functions and the growing importance
of others. There has been a rising demand for technologically-skilled
staff.
''The entrance requirement for office work has changed,'' said Brook
Street's Glasgow branch manager Teresa Evans. ''Whereas previously a
willingness to carry out routine tasks accurately was the key to the
first rung of office life, these days employers have come to expect some
level of PC skills.
''The PC is taking the place of the old filing cabinet full of
yellowing paper. Junior office jobs still exist in significant
quantities but the days of the filing clerk are numbered. Increasingly,
filing is done with the click of a key or the wave of a mouse.''
Meanwhile, a report today showed that pay deals were trailing behind
inflation after remaining at 3% all year.
The level of settlements had been increasing towards the end of last
year but employers are now refusing to concede claims for above the rate
of inflation, it was found.
A fifth of the 229 deals monitored by the Industrial Relations
Services in the three months to June were for 3%.
There have been bigger increases in some industries, including
engineering and chemicals at 3.5% -- the current rate of inflation.
''The burning question now facing the UK economy is whether we will
soon see a return to the time-honoured pattern of settlements chasing
inflation upwards,'' said the report.

DUNCAN Fletcher, a prominent Scots doctor who could almost have turned
his enjoyable hobby of magic-making into a profession, and who won a
respected place in the non-medical world of stage tricks and
sleight-of-hand, has died in hospital at Glasgow.
Dr Fletcher, who was 71, became one of Britain's best-known magical
performers, and was honoured with the post of president of the
International Brotherhood of Magicians. A friend and colleague of
magicians and illusionists throughout Britain, he became a regular and
prominent participant at performances and conventions in England as well
as in Scotland.
His prestigious office with the International Brotherhood was held in
1975-76. He was also president of the Scottish Conjurers' Association, a
past president of the Scottish Association of Magical Societies, and a
Gold Star member of the Inner Magic Circle, London.
An enthusiastic devotee of all things in the world of magical
performance, Dr Fletcher helped many new and aspiring magicians and
conjurers to progress in their stage and concert appearances.
He proved of sterling help to theatre people in another showbusiness
field, working quietly behind the scenes as honorary treasurer of the
Scottish variety branch of British Actors' Equity Association.
A retired community medicine executive with the Glasgow and West of
Scotland health service, he is survived by his wife, Olive, and
daughters Moira and Rena and son Ian.

FRESH pressure on Chancellor Kenneth Clarke for major tax cuts and
deep reductions in public spending in his Budget was applied by two
leading Tory right wingers yesterday.
The chairman of the Finance Committee of Tory MPs, Mr John Townend,
also attacked Mr Clarke's handling of the taxation of executive share
options as ''a ridiculous compromise''.
He said: ''It is unfortunate that straight after the leadership
election when we are trying to unite under the Prime Minister for a new
start, we should have this banana skin.''
Mr Clarke could face a row with Tory right wingers after the Budget as
he seems certain to fall far short of the #10bn cut in public spending
they have been calling for.
Mr John Redwood said there must be at the #5bn reduction he called for
during the leadership contest. That, he added, would be ''a good down
payment'' to voters the Government needed to woo, such as home owners,
small business people, and prudent pensioners.
Mr Redwood said tax cuts were now ''the crucial issue'' in winning
back popular support for the Tories.
''What the people are wanting is for the Conservatives to start
delivering on promises concerning the overall levels of taxation,'' he
said.
Conservative MPs are themselves divided on whether a straight cut of
2p in the standard rate of income tax would have the biggest impact or
whether, instead, to greatly increase tax allowances for various groups.
Nearly all are concerned that despite Government promises to cut back
on the role of the State, spending under the Conservatives has risen
from 35% of the gross domestic product in the last year of Labour
Government (1978-79) to 42.5% now, with the welfare budget accounting
for a third of the total.
Mr Townend complained that a Socialist government could be proud of
the current level of public spending ''but we were not elected for
that''.

FEWER children are dying from leukemia but there has been little
change in the number of adult lives claimed by the disease, according to
a report released today by the Cancer Research Campaign.
Leukemia is the most common cancer for children in Britain, with about
450 new cases each year, slightly more among boys than girls.
Before 1970, a maximum of 10% of childhood leukemia patients survived
five years or more. But the latest figures show that 73% now survive
lymphatic leukemia (the most common childhood cancer) and 40% survive
acute non-lymphatic cancer.
Professor Gordon McVie, the charity's scientific director, said: ''The
good news is that these figures show that childhood leukemia deaths have
halved in the UK since 1970, but this is against little or no progress
in adults, 4000 of whom die from this disease each year.''
Incidence trends in Britain and other developed countries are stable
or slowly increasing. In the UK, about 3000 men and 2600 women are
diagnosed with the disease each year.
Professor McVie said: ''We have achieved considerable success in
treating childhood leukemia, but still the prognosis for adult patients
is poor.''
The report states that an excess of childhood leukemia cases near
Sellafield has defied attempts to relate it to radiation.
Instead, says the report, there is mounting evidence that the excess
reflects the unusual population mixing which has taken place in that

Leukemia is rarely inherited. The proportion of childhood sufferers
with an inheritable form is unlikely to exceed 5%. However, the
discovery of genetic changes is proving important in identifying
patients with either a poor or very good outlook, and has allowed
treatment to be tailored accordingly.

DETECTIVES were yesterday trying to piece together the last 48 hours
of a couple found dead at a house in Dumfries.
The couple -- believed to be Mr Ken Smith, 52, and his wife Diane, 50
-- were discovered at the weekend by a neighbour in Lincluden, one of
the town's biggest housing schemes.
Chief Inspector Tom McCulloch said yesterday: ''We are not looking for
a third party although our investigations are going on.''
Mr and Mrs Smith have two sons and a daughter and police were trying
to trace them over the weekend. They were believed to be on holiday.
The discovery was made by a neighbour after the couple had not been
seen for two days.
As police carried out house-to-house inquiries, the couple's
A-registered silver Volvo car was still sitting outside the house with
the keys in it.
The couple came to the area about six years ago from the North-east of
England.

A POLICEMAN was taken to hospital and a number of other officers were
injured during a clash with Ulster loyalists yesterday.
Hundreds of Sinn Fein and Orange Order supporters were kept apart by a
heavy blockade of RUC Land Rovers in the centre of Lurgan, County
Armagh.
The trouble flared when missiles were thrown at police attempting to
remove Protestant youths who were jumping on the bonnets of armoured
vehicles in Market Street.
A Royal Ulster Constabulary spokesman said one officer required
hospital treatment and others were injured but remained on duty during
the brief disturbance.
The nationalists, who had paraded along Edward Street, were told they
could not continue through the town centre in the interests of public
order.
Assistant Chief Constable Bill McCree said he had no choice but to
prevent the parade going any further.
Several hundred yards away, loyalists cheered when they heard the Sinn
Fein rally had been stopped.
As Orange bands played traditional tunes, the local Ulster Unionist
MP, Mr David Trimble, appealed to the crowd to disperse quietly. After
staging a sit-down protest, the Sinn Fein crowd dispersed into Catholic
estates nearby.
There have been no serious disturbances in Lurgan since 1972 and the
heavy police turnout was evidence of their determination to keep the
divided town quiet following recent clashes in nearby Portadown.
Mr Trimble said the Sinn Fein march had been ''provocative'' but he
added that the disturbance was not serious.
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein warned there was ''not the remotest possibility''
of the IRA surrendering weapons before a full political settlement.
Leading republican spokesman Martin McGuinness called on the
Government to kick-start the peace process -- after a ceasefire now 11
months old -- by moving swiftly to all-party talks in the province.
But a senior Conservative MP, Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory
back-bench Northern Ireland committee, insisted no talks were possible
without a handover of IRA arms.
Mr McGuinness, a key figure in contacts between Sinn Fein and the
Government, claimed that no group in Ulster -- even loyalists --
expected the IRA to give up its guns.
''There is no possibility whatsoever, not even the remotest
possibility, that the IRA will surrender its weapons this side of a
negotiated settlement,'' he said on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost.
''Many people within the British establishment and the British
military accept that.
''Our focus at this time has to be on the reality that many people out
there one year on expect the British Government to join the Dublin
Government to bring all the parties to the negotiating table.''
But Mr Hunter warned that there was a growing danger of the unionist
community in Northern Ireland feeling isolated and beginning to lose
confidence in the peace process.
''Unless unionist confidence can be restored there is going to be no
settlement,'' he said on the same programme.
''There can be no all-party talks until or unless decommissioning of
weapons is well under way because all parties will not meet and talk.
''There will not be these all-party talks until there is confidence in
the procedure and that confidence is not there while Sinn Fein keep
their guns and their position.''
Behind-the-scenes negotiations in Ulster are believed to have stalled
on the issues of decommissioning and the release of prisoners as both
sides have dug in.
Pressure for movement on the release of prisoners intensified
following the decision of the Dublin Government to free a further 12
convicted IRA men on Saturday as part of the peace process.
Loyalist groups are as anxious as the republicans to see their
paramilitaries released.

<HEADLINE>Police surgeons take action in pay dispute</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
POLICE surgeons in Ayrshire are to impose sanctions on Strathclyde
police from tomorrow, with mass resignations planned from September 1 if
there is no resolution of a pay dispute.
They decided on the action after a meeting with Assistant Chief
Constable Ian McKinnon. The meeting failed to settle the issue of
payment for travel to and from call-outs, which Strathclyde police have
apparently been paying wrongly for the last 20 years.
Although the exact measures decided upon by the doctors are being kept
secret, sources have indicated that they would no longer prescribe
medication from personal drug supplies. A pharmacist, who would require
to be paid by the police, would be called to dispense medicines at
private prescription costs every time.
One sanction almost certain to be put in place would be the non-issue
of death certificates. Under such circumstances, all sudden deaths would
require a post-mortem examination whereas at present in approximately
half of the cases seen by a police doctor, a death certificate can be
issued enabling families to proceed with funeral arrangements.
Dr Katharine Morrison, senior police surgeon for the Kilmarnock Police
Division, and co-ordinating doctor for the Ayrshire group, said that
there remained an area of disagreement over whether the police could
legally pay travel time.
''My information is that Lothian and Borders are the only force in
Scotland which does not pay police surgeons travel time,'' said Dr
Morrison. ''I understand that a similar dispute arose in Fife region
last month, but, following threatened resignation, payment for travel
time was reinstated for doctors.
''Ayrshire police surgeons have reluctantly taken this step but we
remain firm that if no settlement is reached, 90% of us, that is 25
doctors, will resign from September 1 and unfortunately a few doctors
have indicated that once they resign they will not return to work as
police surgeons.''
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde police said that: ''We understand that
Dr Morrison is aware that the question of payment for surgeons'
travelling time is currently the subject of negotiation between local
authorities and police surgeons at national level.
''It would be inappropriate of us to comment on any problems surgeons
in Ayrshire may have in connection with their grievances.

<HEADLINE>Former US agent offers Lockerbie 'secrets' for immunity</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>977125610</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Lord Advocate is to be asked to give diplomatic immunity to a
disgraced American intelligence agent to uncover the part he claims the
US played in the Lockerbie disaster.
The call comes from Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, who says
Mr Lester Coleman is willing to speak to Scottish police about an
alleged security loophole set up by the US which resulted in a bomb
being placed on PanAm Flight 103 at Frankfurt airport.
The plane exploded above Lockerbie after leaving London for the US, on
December 21, 1988, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
Mr Coleman's theory of a link with a drugs run from the Lebanon
through Cyprus and Germany was the conclusion of a book about him by Mr
Donald Goddard, called The Trail of the Octopus. The book is now the
subject of a forthcoming libel action by another US agent.
Mr Coleman believes the bomb got on to Flight 103 because US
intelligence agents in Beirut in 1988 agreed with Lebanese terrorists to
facilitate a route for drugs from the Lebanon into the US in exchange
for information about Western hostages.
Luggage containing drugs was protected by US intelligence with normal
security restrictions on baggage at airports removed. But, he alleges,
the terrorists exploited the loophole by exchanging a bag of drugs with
a bag containing a bomb at Frankfurt airport.
Mr Coleman was based in Beirut at the time and often travelled to
Cyprus where he had dealings with the American Drug Enforcement Agency.
Shortly after the book was published in 1993, Mr Coleman was indicted
on charges of perjury, and travelling on a false passport. He fled the
US and is now in hiding.
Mr Dalyell said yesterday that he had written to the Lord Advocate,
Lord Rodger, asking him to bring Mr Coleman to the UK ''on the promise
of immunity from extradition to the USA to talk to the police''.
''It would make them go into the whole American conspiracy aspects of
it,'' said the MP, who discussed the proposal with Mr Coleman on the
telephone on Saturday.
He would not say where Mr Coleman was, but added: ''He is abroad. The
difficulty is that he is certainly threatened by US agents.''
The appeal follows newspaper reports on Saturday that the US State
Department was warned less than three weeks before the Lockerbie
disaster that a Palestinian group in Germany was set to target a PanAm
flight.
Mr Dalyell says in his letter to the Lord Advocate that this
undermines the official line that two untried Libyans may have been
responsible.
''One of my complaints against Her Majesty's Government is that so
little curiosity has been displayed about following up or allowing the
Dumfries and Galloway Police to follow up possible leads which would
exculpate, or appear to exculpate, those charged,'' Mr Dalyell says in
his letter.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister was last night challenged to demand to
see British intelligence files to discover if any warnings were received
before the Lockerbie disaster.
Dr Jim Swire, spokesman for the UK relatives of those who died when
PanAm flight 103 was blown up, said that given a statement four months
ago from Mr Major's office it appeared the Prime Minister had no clue
about their contents and the Government now had a duty to examine them.
Dr Swire, whose daughter died in the tragedy, has demanded a
comprehensive inquiry with the power to look at the intelligence files.
He said Mr Edward Oakden, the Prime Minister's Parliamentary Private
Secretary, had told relatives in March no warnings relevant to Lockerbie
were received before-hand.
''I don't believe that the Prime Minister and Mr Oakden are liars and
hypocrites. If a letter like that can be written it does mean Mr Major
does not have a clue as to what is in British intelligence files. The
British Government may innocently believe the Libyans are guilty when in
fact they may not be.''
Dr Swire said the new evidence made it clear American intelligence was
informed at the beginning of December 1988 that Palestinians were still
active in Germany with the intent on destroying a PanAm airliner.
''That is a very specific warning received at a very crucial time.''
The Guardian quoted the counter-intelligence report, headed Department
of State, Diplomatic Security, as saying on December 2, 1988 -- ''Team
of Palestinians not assoc with Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO)
intends to atk US tgts in Europe. Time frame is present,''
The report added: ''Tgts specified are Pan-Am airlines and US mil
bases.''
Libya has repeatedly offered to allow two men suspected of involvement
in the bombing to stand trial at the World Court at The Hague.
Dr Swire said: ''The failure of the Foreign Office, the Lord Advocate,
or, of course, the Americans to show interest in the option of a trial
in a neutral country, to a form of which the Libyans have agreed,
remains for some of us the most suspicious aspect of this whole sorry
story.''

GOVERNMENT plans to introduce a 12-month probationary period for all
council tenants will not solve problems of anti-social behaviour, says
the Scottish Council for Single Homeless.
Instead, they are likely to increase tension and could provide a focus
for ''intimidation and scapegoating''.
Responding to a Scottish Office consultation paper, the SCSH claims
the proposals would be ''folly'' and maintains that the document
stigmatises all council tenants as likely to be disruptive and creates
an incentive for settled tenants to complain about their new neighbours.
The council fears that minority groups could become the target of
harassment.
The proposals in the consultation paper on probationary tenancies and
anti-social behaviour make it easier for councils to evict tenants in
the first year of their tenancy, says the SCSH.
The SCSH's director, Ms Claire Stevens, said homeless people were put
at risk by the plans.
''When they are offered a tenancy, they are often the target of
complaints, sometimes because they have no experience of managing a
house, sometimes because of money problems, sometimes because of clashes
of lifestyle, and sometimes because neighbours resent them being offered
the house in the first place.
''Our concern is that some young people who have already faced serious
personal difficulties will remain locked in the homelessness cycle.''
Probationary tenancies would add to their problems.
''It is our experience that many who start off with difficulties
settled down in their communities and become model tenants. The
probationary tenancy approach may never let them settle down.''

THE Croatian army is winning ground in Bosnia and is poised to
recapture territory lost to rebel Serbs at home, forcing a slim chance
of a breathing space in the crisis.
With this sudden switch in the balance of the fighting, the United
Nations last night announced an agreement it hopes could prevent the war
from spreading to Croatia.
But Croatia immediately served notice that it wanted top-level
negotiations on its own terms or ''all other options are possible''.
One of Croatia's demands is negotiations on restoration of Zagreb's
authority in the breakaway lands -- something the Serbs have vowed never
to accept.
Even Yasushi Akashi, the top UN official in former Yugoslavia, who led
the the UN delegation at the five-and-a-half hour meeting, was cautious.
''The danger of the full-scale war starting in the next several days
or weeks cannot be excluded yet. This is the time for the maximum
restraint on all sides,'' he told reporters at Knin, the rebel Serb
stronghold in Croatia.
Croatian Serb leader Milan Martic headed his side's delegation. Also
there was UN Commander General Bernard Janvier.
The accord amounted to a big concession by the Serbs. It was not
immediately clear whether it was just a Serb ploy to buy time to regroup
forces or whether Croatia, whose troops captured large swathes of
Serb-populated western Bosnia and cut a supply route to Knin, would do
anything in return.
While this was happening, a Labour MP infuriated his colleagues by
holding talks with Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader
who is accused of war crimes.
Mr Bob Wareing, MP for Liverpool West Derby, had gone to the isolated
Bosnian Serb capital of Pale for the meeting.
He is also thought to be planning to talk to the Serb military chief,
General Ratko Mladic, who has been described as the Butcher of Bosnia.
The two men top the United Nations wanted list of suspected war
criminals. They have been indicted by the international community for
ordering atrocities against civilians.
Mr Wareing, who was accompanied by Tory peer and landowner Lord
Harlech, spent more than four hours in talks with Dr Karadzic. The talks
were reported to have touched on the possibility of an international
conference to search for a political solution across the whole of the
former Yugoslavia.
The Labour MP, long known for his pro-Serb views, appears to have
departed without informing either the Labour leadership or his
constituency party of his full schedule.
He left on Saturday on a trip that is to include meetings with
commanders of British troops serving with the UN and an attempt today to
visit the beleaguered Bihac pocket.
Labour leader Tony Blair officially distanced himself from the visit
but refused to issue an outright condemnation of the long-serving back
bencher.
A spokesman said: ''Mr Blair is unaware of the visit. If it has taken
place, it is on Mr Wareing's own initiative.''
Rank-and-file Labour MPs denounced Mr Wareing, 64, as ''amazingly
stupid'' and ''completely and utterly wrong''.
They were unable to hide their anger at what they believed was an
ill-conceived mission.
Mr David Winnick, the Walsall North MP, who has consistently spoken
out on behalf of the Bosnian government, said: ''There is no way any
democratic socialist should be shaking the hands of such
fascist-communist butchers.''
Ms Kate Hoey, secretary of the all-party Bosnia group, dismissed Mr
Wareing as ''crazy'', adding: ''What he does as an individual MP is up
to him. I think he has been amazingly stupid but he does not speak for
anybody and he is not there on behalf of anybody.''
Mr Calum Macdonald, MP for Western Isles, said: ''It is utterly and
completely wrong for any British parliamentarian to be consorting with
indicted war criminals like Mladic and Karadzic at this time.''
Tory MP Lady Olga Maitland, secretary of the all-party British
Yugoslav group and herself of Serbian descent, said Mr Wareing had gone
with the best intentions but was ''misguided'' and risked being used as
a propaganda tool.
The Foreign Office was publicly relaxed about the visit, although a
spokesman said it had not been aware that talks with Dr Karadzic and
General Mladic were on the agenda.
Fast-moving events on the ground led to the tentative accord between
Croatia and the Serbs. Before it was announced, Croatia sent more troops
to the front-line after its president, Franjo Tudjman, vowed to
recapture territory lost to rebel Serbs in 1992 unless they agree to
negotiate on his terms. He proposed negotiations in Geneva.
Some 1300 Croatian Serbs pulled out of an assault against the
north-western Government-held Bihac enclave in Bosnia and moved to
defend their territory in Croatia.
Under the accord, Croatian Serbs agreed to refrain from any offensive
action against Croatia if they are not provoked. Croatian Serbs expect
Bosnian government forces to refrain from attacking them across the
border, the accord said.
The Croatian Serbs also agreed to halt all military action in Bihac.
But the accord makes no mention of their allies, the Bosnian Serbs and
rebel Muslims, who also have been attacking Bihac.
Showing the fragility of any accord, the Croatian Serbs unleashed
intense shelling yesterday about about 15 miles north of Bihac.
Croatia has sent thousands of troops across the border into Bosnia
where they joined forces with Bosnian Croats and seized two strategic
towns, Grahovo and Glamoc, from the Bosnian Serbs.
The Bosnian Serbs, reeling from last week's loss of the two towns,
appealed to Serb-dominated Yugoslavia for help.
The Yugoslav government sharply condemned Croatian army activity in
Bosnia. It called for an ''immediate and unconditional'' ceasefire. But
it stopped short of promising military aid.
Fighting also continued today around the village of Strmica, between
Grahovo and Knin, the Croatian Serb stronghold, on the Croatian-Bosnian
border. Croats started shelling the town on Friday, indicating they
might move toward Knin, about nine miles away.
The Croatian army's move into the Bosnian war followed agreement a
week ago between the Bosnian and Croatian governments to increase
military co-operation, particularly around Bihac.
Under yesterday's agreement, Croatian Serbs would allow humanitarian
convoys to Bihac. The Croatian Serbs were also promised some
humanitarian aid.
* France and Britain swept aside military differences at talks in
Paris in an attempt to kick-start the political process in Bosnia. The
Prime Minister and French President Jacques Chirac sealed a renewed mood
of co-operation over an informal lunch at the Elysee Palace.
John and Norma Major stopped off in Paris on Saturday on the way to a
holiday in the south of France.
Mr Chirac later announced a ''great convergence of views'' across the
board but particularly on Bosnia.
* The latest British additions to the United Nations Rapid Reaction
Force in Bosnia were arriving in the former Yugoslavia yesterday. The
advance party of 44 officers and men from the 24 Airmobile Brigade,
based at Colchester in Essex, will prepare for a mass deployment next
week of more than 4000 British troops to the area.

ONE man was killed and two other people were injured yesterday in a
series of paragliding accidents on the Scottish hills.
The man who died apparently lost control of his parachute-like canopy
and crashed into a rocky hillside in the Campsies above Blanefield.
A friend waited helplessly below, watching his final spiral, while an
eye witness, journalist Alastair Balfour, said: ''He was swinging
wildly, round and round, and falling rapidly from a height of several
hundred feet before he hit the ground.''
The man, who has not been named, was taken to Vale of Leven Hospital,
Alexandria, by a Sea King helicopter from HMS Gannet at Prestwick, but
was found to be dead on arrival.
Mr Balfour, who lives in Blanefield, was hillwalking with his two
young daughters. He reached the man first and said he had sustained
serious head injuries, despite wearing a safety helmet.
Last night, Central Scotland Police said a report on the incident
would be sent to the procurator-fiscal at Stirling, and the Civil
Aviation Authority would carry out an inquiry.
It is understood the man is the first paraglider to die in Scotland.
Later yesterday, two members of a Cambus group were injured in separate
accidents while flying from the Ochils, east of Stirling.
A 28-year-old man crashed into Myreton Hill above Menstrie, and was
flown to Stirling Royal Infirmary with serious back injuries.
Three hours later, a colleague escaped with wrist injuries when she
collided with a lamp-post and landed in the garden of a house in
Forthvale, Menstrie. Their details were not available last night.
Mr Peter Shields, who runs the official Glasgow paragliding training
school, Cloudbusters, said last night: ''It is an exhilarating sport,
which carries a certain amount of risk like any aerial activity.''
He said the British Hang-gliding and Paragliding Association, was
making stringent efforts to regulate pilots through rigorous training
and supervision.
Paragliding is a fast-growing sport, with 500 Scottish pilots
registered. Because the canopies used are relatively cheap (up to #2000)
and portable, it has wider appeal than hang-gliding.
Pilots launch themselves from hilltops and can rise several thousand
feet. The Scottish record for distance travelled is about 100km, while
the UK figure is 175km.
Mr Shields said he did not know the details of yesterday's accident
but said the Blanefield site frequently had turbulent weather
conditions.
He pointed out that, although there was little wind in many parts of
Scotland yesterday, paragliding relied more on overall weather
conditions to create suitable thermal currents.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson yesterday insisted that
Labour remained resolutely committed to the creation of a Scottish
parliament.
His remarks followed an article in the Sunday Times, which suggested
that party leader Tony Blair was attempting to ''water down'' Labour
policy on devolution, in the wake of the announcement that regional
assemblies in England would have only limited powers.
Mr Robertson said: ''This story is complete fiction. Our commitment to
creating a strong Scottish parliament remains clear, firm, and rock
solid.
''This story is just one more attempt at mischievous speculation,
designed to divert the devolution cause..''
Earlier, in an exclusive interview with The Herald, Mr Robertson said:
''Everybody has made it absolutely clear that what is being proposed for
England stands purely for England and . . . has nothing to do with
Scotland.''
Mr Robertson dismissed claims that the weaker model for devolution of
power in England would undermine the Scottish case.
However, SNP leader Alex Salmond said last night: ''Under Labour's new
proposals, a future assembly would be more closely caged than a lion at
the zoo.''

FIREFIGHTERS were still battling early this morning to contain a
forest fire which was raging across the southern slopes above Inverness.
The blaze at Drumossie moor, site of the Battle of Culloden, destroyed
hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of mature forest since it was
first reported on Saturday about 2pm.
Two helicopters were called in last night to help almost 50
firefighters by dropping water bombs on the forest fire, which was
running across the southern slopes at Daviot.
A Highland and Islands Fire Brigade spokesman said about two square
kilometres of the 11-square kilometre forest had been destroyed.
He said the fire had been brought under control about 2am yesterday
but that another front had appeared to the south of the original fire.
Fire officials were unsure whether this was another blaze or a spread of
the original fire.
The spokesman said there was no immediate danger to the public and
that no housing was under immediate threat.
No-one from Tilhill Economic Forestry, which manages the forest, could
be reached for comment last night.

GLASGOW Airport is in danger of being strangled by congestion problems
on the motorway through the city centre, according to new passenger
growth figures produced by Scottish Airports Ltd.
Business travellers are already choosing to fly from Edinburgh rather
than run the risk of being caught in long delays on the Kingston Bridge,
the managing director of Scottish Airports, Mr Vernon Murphy, warned.
The drift east is expected to accelerate with the opening soon of the
M8 extension to the Edinburgh city by-pass which will slash the number
of vehicles using the congested Newbridge roundabout. New work on the
Kingston Bridge, expected to last years, will start in January.
The latest figures show Edinburgh's growth is outstripping Glasgow's
and last month's statistics repeat a trend growing throughout the year.
Edinburgh's June figures show an increase of passenger throughput of
13.1% while Glasgow shows 1.8%.
The capital's pre-eminent position in business flights is underlined
by the fact that Edinburgh now operates more flights to London than
Glasgow. According to the business flights guide, on an average weekday
there are 36 services from Edinburgh compared with 34 from Glasgow.
Scottish Airports, a subsidiary of the British Airports Authority,
owns and runs both airports. Mr Murphy said the new development should
be of major concern to Glasgow.
''I run Scottish airports and it doesn't concern me which way the
longer-term business moves as long as we get the growth -- but it should
concern Glasgow,'' he said.
Part of Glasgow's downturn can be attributed to the loss of a number
of transatlantic services, said Mr Murphy, but ''the other half of the
problem is that the passenger market on the other side of Glasgow is
going towards Edinburgh because of the access problem''.
''We've had businessmen in East Kilbride saying that they have started
using Edinburgh. It is longer to drive to Edinburgh but it is not the
journey time people are concerned with but certainty. It's knowing that
if you leave at a certain time you will get your flight.''
Mr Iain McMillan, assistant director of CBI Scotland, said two factors
were at work. ''Edinburgh as a city has been growing very rapidly. Along
with Leeds it is probably one of the UK's two growth areas.
''The congestion on the Kingston Bridge and Charing Cross is a major
problem and that is why organisations like the CBI and Scottish Airports
have been pushing very hard to have the new motorway extension built in
Glasgow.''

<HEADLINE>Airport holiday delay row takes off. Scots suffer as jet diverted for cruise tourists</HEADLINE>

A ROW involving Britain's second biggest tour operator erupted
yesterday after 200 Scottish holidaymakers were delayed for more than
seven hours at Glasgow airport.
Their plane was diverted to Birmingham so that passengers delayed
there could be flown to Majorca in time to board a Mediterranean cruise.
Mrs Irene Adams, Labour MP for Paisley North, has accused Airtours of
giving the English passengers preferential treatment and is calling for
an apology and compensation for the Scots holidaymakers, but the company
claims the diversion was the best way to minimise disruption for
passengers on both flights.
The Scottish holidaymakers were due to leave Glasgow on an Airtours
Boeing 757 for Corfu at 6.30pm on Saturday, but Airtours decided to
divert the plane to Birmingham. The Scots eventually departed at 1.55am
yesterday after another aircraft was flown to Glasgow from Manchester.
Airtours diverted the original plane from Glasgow to Birmingham after
another of its Boeing 757s returned to the English airport with a
technical problem.
The plane which had been diverted from Glasgow finally left Birmingham
at 10.03pm on Saturday, after a delay of more than eight hours.
Officials at Glasgow airport spoke to Airtours ''in the strongest
possible terms'' on behalf of angry Scottish passengers, and said they
did not believe diverting the aircraft to Birmingham was a satisfactory
solution to the company's problem.
But an airport spokesman said yesterday that the diversion was an
operational matter, for Airtours and stressed that the airport had no
power to dictate how a tour operator used its equipment.
Airtours yesterday defended its action, claiming that the diversion to
Birmingham was the best re-scheduling option available to minimise
disruption.
However, the company admitted the plane was diverted largely because
about 70 of the 200 passengers on the Majorca-bound flight were due to
board a Mediterranean cruise and could have missed the boat at Palma if
their departure from Birmingham had been further delayed.
An Airtours spokeswoman said: ''Flight re-scheduling is a complicated
issue for all tour operators and it is done very carefully to
inconvenience people as little as possible.
''It is very unfortunate that the holidaymakers flying from Glasgow
were delayed, but sometimes these situations are unavoidable. It was a
relatively short delay and they were well looked after and got vouchers
for light refreshements.''
She added: ''Ultimately, a decision was made to make sure the
passengers at Birmingham got on their cruises.
''We are very sorry for the delay at Glasgow, but the Birmingham
passengers were also delayed and we would have been in a worse situation
if the holidaymakers going on the cruise weren't able to get a flight in
time and missed their cruise.''
Asked if an aircraft from another of the 18 British airports the
company uses could not have been transferred to Birmingham, the
spokeswoman reiterated that the diversion from Glasgow was ''the most
reasonable solution to the problem.''
Mrs Adams, who said the Glasgow flight included some of her
constituents as it was at the start of the traditional Paisley fair
fortnight, also claimed passengers were told by Airtours that there had
been a technical problem with their aircraft, but the company denied
this and said passengers were told there was a problem with ''an
aircraft in our fleet''.
Mrs Adams said: ''I'm seeking an apology for the misinformation given
in the first instance and some compensation for the distress and delay
caused to passengers.
''We know that there was a technical difficulty on the Birmingham
flight, but why should the people at Glasgow airport suffer when it
wasn't with their flight?
''I think it is quite outrageous. People save up all year for their
summer holiday and it is difficult enough waiting in airports,
especially if you have children, without having an eight-hour delay.''

POLICE and trading standards officers are looking into reports that
former Rangers and Scotland footballer Willie Henderson has been
peddling goods in Stornoway pubs.
The 52-year-old former winger, once the highest paid player in
Scotland, was barred recently from the Crown Hotel, Castle Street, after
he began his sales pitch without permission.
Regulars claimed he was selling videos about himself, perfume, and
Pringle jumpers.
Owners Bass Taverns confirmed the incident.
''Mr Henderson was trying to sell certain items and was asked to
leave, which he did,'' said a spokesman.
The islands' head of trading standards, Mr Harry Miller, said Mr
Henderson would need a certificate under the Peddlers Act 1871 to sell
in pubs and clubs.
''If he has such a certificate from any local authority in the UK, it
would probably be quite legal.''
Police in Stornoway yesterday said they had the trading standards
department report but would not confirm the extent of their own
inquiries.
Mr Henderson left Stornoway on the Thursday lunchtime ferry to
Ullapool and has not been seen there since.

ORGANISED troublemakers targeted Celtic fans when they travelled to
England for a pre-season friendly match with Birmingham City on
Saturday, police said yesterday.
They chanted sectarian taunts, which are virtually unknown in English
football, in an attempt to provoke Celtic's estimated 6000 travelling
support.
Yesterday, the man in charge of policing the match claimed that known
troublemakers from several other clubs in the English Midlands had
congregated at Birmingham City's St Andrews Park to make trouble.
Superintendent Roger Conway, of West Midlands Police, also defended
the actions of mounted police officers, who were accused of brutality
against Celtic fans as they were leaving the match.
Immediately before the game, Birmingham City fans in the main stand
had unfurled a large Red Hand of Ulster flag, apparently as a challenge
to the main body of Celtic fans just yards away.
The situation was defused when the club's managing director Karren
Brady stepped in to reprimand those responsible and remove the offending
flag.
A total of 11 arrests were made during the match, which Celtic lost
1-0, and several more people were arrested before and after the game.
Those charged were either bailed or remanded in custody until today,
when they are due to appear in court charged with public order offences.
Superintendent Conway said: ''Unfortunately, there were known
troublemakers identified among the home fans, who had been drawn from
many other clubs across the Midlands region.
''Also unfortunately, the vast bulk of the Celtic fans, although they
remained mainly good-humoured and well-behaved, had consumed a large
quantity of alcohol.
'Many had been drinking since 10 o'clock in the morning and by the
time they reached the ground at 3 o'clock, they had consumed a lot of
drink.
'I think those two factors together made it quite a tense and
difficult match for us.'
However, police came in for their own share of criticism for
heavy-handed tactics against Celtic fans who were trying to reach their
cars after the match.
Mounted officers had pursued a group of fans as they moved through
Kingston Hill park, heading inadvertently towards opposition fans.
Several fans reported being struck with batons as the police urged them
back.
In the melee, bottles and bricks were thrown between groups of around
20 fans from both sides.
Superintendent Conway defended the actions of his officers, saying
they did what was necessary to avoid far worse scenes of violence.

RANGERS' star signing Paul Gascoigne has been warned by a Scottish
Labour MP that he might cause trouble at an Old Firm match if he repeats
a stunt carried out at a match in an international tournament at Ibrox
at the weekend, writes Keith Sinclair.
The English international player was seen by thousands of apparently
delighted fans to imitate playing a flute before Rangers' match against
Steau Bucharest on Saturday.
The player, recently signed from Italian club Lazio for #4.3m, was
warned by Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley,
that the stunt could inflame passions at an Old Firm match.
Mr Foulkes was not at the match, but has suggested Rangers manager
Walter Smith should advise the player how to behave at Scottish football
matches.
The MP, who is a Hearts season ticket-holder and shareholder, said:
''I fear that Rangers will discover that signing Gascoigne was a
mistake.
''Other players like Laudrup and Hateley, who have joined the club in
recent years, seem to understand the sensitivity of matters relating to
sectarianism in the West of Scotland but Gascoigne doesn't and I fear
that could be dangerous for example at an Old Firm game.
''I'm not sure if Gascoigne is aware of the kind of atmosphere and
rivalry there is at a Celtic-Rangers match but if he was to do something
similar it could cause trouble.''
Mr Foulkes added that he believed there were many ''serious'' Rangers
supporters who were worried that such antics might distract attention
from the footballing achievements of the player and the club and said
Walter Smith should advise him not to repeat them.
''I think Mr Smith should have a word in his ear, but what effect that
would have I don't know.''
Rangers secretary Campbell Ogilvie said last night that he believed
the matter had been ''blown out of all proportion''.
He added, however, ''I am sure manager Walter Smith will deal with the
matter as he deems fit.''

A 44-YEAR-old man survived for more than 17 hours clinging to an oil
drum in the Firth of Tay after a cabin cruiser sank in thick fog on
Saturday night.
However, two men drowned and a third man was still missing as
lifeboats, fishing vessels, and an RAF Sea King helicopter mounted a
full-scale search of river and coastline. The two dead were named later
as father and son Mr Gerald Bruce, 58, and Mr Ian Bruce, 26, both of
Princes Street, Arbroath. The search for the missing man is expected to
continue today.
Yesterday's search, co-ordinated by Forth coastguard at Crail, and
using heat-seeking cameras, was hampered by fog which reduced visibility
to 200 yards.
Mr James Miller, a father of four, was rescued yesterday afternoon, 17
hours after the cabin cruiser, which had just been bought by his friend,
sank off the Abertay Sands at 8pm on Saturday.
Forth coastguard said the boat had neither radio nor flares and had
only one life-ring, which had been passed between the crew after they
abandoned the sinking vessel.
A coastguard spokesman said: ''It appears that they ran on to a
sandbank and that their pumps could not cope. Then the fog came down and
they became disorientated.
''It is sad to think this happened quite close to Crail, but we could
do nothing because they had no radio and no flares.''
Mr Miller, described by Tayside police as the ''sole survivor'', was
being comforted by his family last night at his home in Linton Road,
Arbroath.
His wife, Liz, said he and his three friends were members of an
Arbroath angling club.
''One of them bought the boat and Jim went with them to collect it,''
said Mrs Miller.
She had gone to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee to see her husband after
she had been told of his rescue. ''He was frozen and looked terrible,''
she said. ''He was allowed home but was told to rest . . . he is
devastated.''
The newly-purchased 25ft boat had set out from Newburgh, on the River
Tay, in Fife at 4.30pm on Saturday on a planned voyage back to Arbroath.
When it failed to reach its destination on Sunday morning, Mrs Miller
contacted Tayside police.
Lifeboat crews from Arbroath, Broughty Ferry, and Anstruther, and a
Sea King helicopter from RAF Kinloss were scrambled immediately.
Mr Miller was found by the Broughty Ferry lifeboat at 1.33pm
yesterday, clinging to an oil drum and a cork lifebelt.
Mr Sid Keiller, a member of the lifeboat crew, said he was ''a very
lucky person'' with a ''remarkable will to live''.
Mr Miller was treated at Ninewells Hospital for hypothermia before
being allowed home.
The Broughty Ferry lifeboat picked up the two bodies at approximately
2pm and brought them ashore with wreckage from the boat.
Rescuers speculated that the blue and white cabin cruiser may have hit
a wreck on the sands.
Sailors who know the area warn against the dangers of the sands at the
mouth of the firth. It is an area of quickly changeable weather and
giant waves which can buckle a ship's hull.
Mr Allan Ramsay, a former employee of Tay Estuary Research Centre,
said: ''There are plenty of wrecks around the firth. In one storm at the
turn of the century, 20 ships were wrecked out there in just two days.''

FEARS that what appears to be a giant comet heading towards earth
could wipe out human life were dismissed as ''hogwash'' last night.
The 1000-mile-wide ice and gas ball was spotted from Arizona last week
with a core between five and 10 times the size of Halley's comet.
The comet, named 1995 01, is now travelling through the constellation
of Sagittarius and according to calculations will be nearest to earth in
January, 1997.
What has astonished stargazers is that the object should be visible to
even small telescopes despite being 558 million miles away.
David Strange said he had been tracking the object for some days.
''The thought that it will collide with earth to destroy human life is
hogwash,'' he said. But it could be the brightest comet for 25 years.

THE home of Scottish rugby is also playing host to surprise guests --
a family of kestrels.
A pair have been nesting in the newly upgraded multi-million pound
Murrayfield stadium, Edinburgh, since the spring and are now rearing
their two young.
Fireworks after the Scottish Claymores American football games as well
as the recent visit by US supergroup REM -- and more than 40,000 fans --
have failed to chase the birds of prey from their home.
Scottish Rugby Union spokeswoman Ms Laura Dick said the kestrels were
welcome visitors at the 44-acre Murrayfield site.
''They seem to be keeping the place clear of vermin. Indeed they have
been spotted swooping on mice on the training ground. We are delighted
they have chosen to make their home here,'' she said.
Inspector Mike Flynn of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals said it was not unusual to find birds of prey in the
heart of a city.
''Kestrels are already nesting on Salisbury Crags and Edinburgh
Castle.

SCOTLAND'S real beer drinkers have called for the #425m Scottish &amp;
Newcastle bid for Courage Brewers to be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
The Campaign for Real Ale said yesterday the takeover plans were
against the interests of a competitive beer industry. If the takeover
went ahead, job losses and brewery closures both north and south of the
Border could not be ruled out, it claimed.
Mr Colin Young, an engineer who also edits the 10,500-circulation
Camra newsletter, Pints of View, said: ''If the takeover goes ahead, S&amp;N
would become Scottish Courage, the biggest brewing group in the UK with
over 25% control of the UK market.
''This controlling share would allow them to compete unfairly in the
sector, where they will have the power to close breweries, axe jobs, set
prices, and squeeze out competitors.''
S&amp;N cleared a major hurdle last week in its bid for Courage, the
brewing subsidiary of Fosters Brewing Group of Australia.
It emerged then that the takeover could escape reference to the MMC,
although a final decision would be taken after third party views were
fully considered.
Competitor Bass and Whitbread is among opponents to the bid, and the
English brewer has written to the Office of Fair Trading calling for MMC
intervention.
Camra opposition to the takeover proposal has assumed UK proportions
and Mr Young said the S&amp;N stance represented ''a hypocritical change of
face from the 1980s when Aussie John Elliot swallowed Courage and then
turned his attention to S&amp;N.''
He said: ''Then the threatened Scottish brewery hurriedly sought the
protection of the MMC by demanding an inquiry.''

<HEADLINE>Lobster could be new luxury crop</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977125625</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IT hardly qualifies as fast food, taking at least three years to reach
the table, but lobster is likely to become the next luxury dish to find
mass market appeal, thanks to the success of research in Scotland.
A lobster breeding experiment at Ardtoe, on Ardnamurchan peninsula in
the Western Highlands, has had remarkable results in accelerating the
crustacean's development, overwhelming its cannibalistic behaviour, and
bolstering its numbers in the sea.
The publicly-funded laboratory, the Marine Farming Unit of the Seafish
Industry, is now providing the technology for similar commercial units
to ''seed'' the seas around Orkney and Shetland with young lobster.
Intensive fishing has decimated large areas of the coastline but the
Ardtoe experiment proves that lobsters grown in the laboratory and
returned to the sea can replenish numbers and provide good catches for
fishermen.
Ardtoe has put 19,000 lobsters into Scapa Flow and more than 5000 into
the seas around the laboratory. In active sea beds, where lobster are
present and laboratory-grown lobsters have been added by Ardtoe, up to
30% of local catches are now ''man-made''.
The process of developing the lobster in the laboratory owes as much
to innovation and rudimentary kitchen equipment as it does to high
technology. Egg-bearing female lobsters are bought from fishermen and
then installed in their own houses -- made of breeze blocks and ridge
tiles -- at the bottom of a 3m-deep tank kept in subdued light. The
water temperature is heated to 17C to speed the development of the eggs
and, when the larvae become free-swimming, a light is hung over the tank
to attract them.
''Then,'' says Ardtoe scientist Craig Burton, ''we scoop them up with
plastic tea strainers. We have tried other methods but our empirical
studies have proved conclusively that the metal version is absolutely
useless.''
Two thousand larvae at a time are then transferred to a conical,
80-litre tank, with small jets of water at a temperature of 19C setting
up a spiral flow. ''Unfortunately lobster are cannibalistic from the day
they are born. So what we do is to feed them to excess, so hopefully
they bump into a food particle before each other,'' says Mr Burton.
It takes 15 days for a larva to metamorphose into a ''proper little
lobster'' around three-quarters of an inch in length. At six weeks, when
they are a little over two inches long, they are micro-tagged so that
they can be identified when caught and at three months, and four inches,
released into the sea.
''If you scatter them from the surface,'' Mr Burton said, ''you're
simply providing lobster supper for everything below, so a diver takes
them down in trays and tries to scatter them over the seabed, at about
one or two to the square metre.''
The young lobster then scuttles for shelter in a burrow where, for the
next two years, ''it grabs anything which happens to stray past the
hole'', and then re-emerges as six-inch lobster, begins to forage
widely, and ultimately becomes prey for the dinner table.
''The success has been far higher than any of us would have dared
speculate,'' Mr Burton said, ''with a survival rate on the ground of
over 50%.''
The Ardtoe laboratory has now set up a pilot scheme in Orkney to breed
lobster on a commercial scale and Shetland Islands Council is hopes to
set up a hatchery capable of producing 10,000 lobsters in each batch. Mr
Burton also believes that fishermen's co-operatives could set up their
own hatcheries to ''seed their own area and reap the benefits''.
However, while there are no controls, or area licensing on lobster
fishing, this is unlikely to happen. Legislation has now been framed
which would give fishermen sole rights to named species in designated
areas.

TWO murderers were on the run last night after tying up a civilian
workman and cutting their way through a prison security fence with a
blowtorch, the Prison Officers' Association said.
The men -- just two years into life sentences -- were among a party
working near oxy-acetylene cutters in the ''near building site
conditions'' of Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London.
It is understood another man, who planned to break out with the two,
changed his mind at the last moment and was tied up and hooded with the
work party leader.
The two killers were discovered missing just after 2pm yesterday and
were thought to have scaled the wall after entering the part of the jail
being refurbished.
The association said this part of the prison was under the control of
a private security firm.
Scotland Yard warned the public not to approach either Anthony
Coughtrey, 22, or Gary Johns, 30, who were both jailed for life in 1993.
They are considered dangerous.
Mr Terry McLaren, vice-chairman of the POA, said: ''You do not keep
dangerous long-term prisoners in prisons that resemble nothing more than
building sites.
''It is even more worrying that these highly dangerous murderers were
left in the custody of a civilian workman.''
The Prison Service said it was awaiting the results of a full inquiry
led by Mr Kevin Brewer, governor of Pentonville Prison, into the
incident before commenting.
The men were described as being between 5ft 10in and 6ft, and wearing
blue jeans and blue tops.

SIX men are expected to appear in court today to face charges under
the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
The charges follow an investigation carried out by several police
forces, including Strathclyde, Central Scotland, and the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.
Strathclyde police said in a statement yesterday that the six were the
subject of a report which had been sent to the procurator-fiscal.
Three other men who were questioned about alleged terrorist offences
had now been released without charge, the statement added.
The six men, aged 23, 28, 29, 40, 44, and 48, were being detained at
Maryhill police station last night after being questioned in Glasgow
last week.
The six are expected to appear at Falkirk Sheriff Court.
One of the six men expected to face charges is believed to be Mr
Lindsay Robb, 44, a senior figure in the Progressive Unionist Party who
had secret talks with Northern Ireland Minister Michael Ancram in June.
Mr Robb, who lives in County Armagh and describes himself as a
part-time journalist, was detained by police on Merseyside last
Wednesday and brought north for questioning.
The other men facing charges were detained last week in Airdrie and
the Glasgow area.
In Belfast yesterday, PUP leader David Ervine confirmed that his
colleague had been charged.
He added: ''We are unaware of the exact nature of the charge and of
the circumstances surrounding his detention by police.''
The PUP is seen in Northern Ireland as representing the outlawed
loyalist group, the Ulster Volunteer Force.
Mr Robb met Mr Ancram in June, but details of the discussions were not
released.
Members of the PUP are expected to be involved in talks next month
with representatives of the British Government.

SCOTLAND'S new record winner in the National Lottery last night
revealed he would be claiming two prizes today -- a cheque for almost
#3.8m and a #10 note.
Mr Bob Westland, from Alloa, discovered on Saturday night that his
first line of numbers matched the six balls drawn, enabling him to share
an #11.4m jackpot with two other winners.
However, he admitted rather shamefacedly last night that his second
line also contained three of the lucky numbers, earning him a further
#10.
He said: ''We checked the draw on teletext and were absolutely
shellshocked.''
Mr Westland, 57, who runs the post office in the village of Plean,
Stirlingshire, said he was ''shattered'' by the experience.
He and his wife Anne, 56, the deputy head teacher at Claremont primary
school in Alloa, restricted yesterday's celebrations to babysitting for
their grandsons, and an early night.
The couple have four sons: Mark, 32, David, 29, Chris, 24, and Robert
22, who have already offered to help spend the giant jackpot.
They will travel to the Glasgow office of lottery operator Camelot
today to have the ticket validated and collect their winnings.
A Camelot spokesman last night confirmed that a ticket bought in the
Alloa area was one of the jackpot winners.
The previous biggest Scottish winner was Mr John Slattery, an Armadale
haulage contractor, who scooped #2.8m two weeks ago.

A SEVEN-year-old girl was strangled after being abducted as she slept
and two schoolboys were brutally murdered on a fishing trip in sickening
weekend killings.
The little girl was sleeping in a tent with her sister and a boy
cousin, both aged nine, in the back garden of their uncle's house in
Llandudno, Gwynedd, when she was snatched on Saturday night.
Her naked body was found half a mile away on a holiday beach by a man
walking his dog at 7.15am yesterday.
The girl, Sophia Louise Hook, of Budworth, near Winsford in Cheshire,
had been sexually assaulted and strangled. Police are searching for the
pink and white nightdress she was wearing when she disappeared.
Detective Superintendent Eric Jones, one of the police officers
hunting the killer, said: ''Whoever was responsible for this crime is a
very dangerous man, a brute who must be caught -- quickly.
''It's a horrifying assault. I've been in the service 25 years and
it's the worst I've ever seen.''
The two schoolboys, both from Eastham, Wirral, were murdered on a
holiday fishing trip to the heavily-wooded beauty spot Eastham Rake, not
far from their homes.
Robert ''Robbie'' Gee, 12, and his friend Paul Barker, 13, set off at
lunchtime on Saturday and were reported missing by their parents when
they failed to return to their homes that night.
Police search teams found their fishing tackle still set up at a pond
then early yesterday they discovered Robbie's body, lying under some
trees, with knife wounds.
In the afternoon, a second body, believed to be Paul's, was found on
the banks of another pond about 500yds away.
Detective Superintendent Geoff Harrison, who is leading the murder
inquiry, told a news conference at Bromborough police station that the
two boys left their homes at lunchtime on Saturday.
''They both intended going fishing in a pond known as The Carpies,
near the M53 motorway. Both were riding mountain bikes and carrying
fishing equipment in a green haversack. They were also carrying rods.
''We know they got to the fishing pond because their equipment had
been set up and there were signs that fishing had taken place,'' added
Mr Harrison.
When the boys had not returned home by 5.30pm their fathers started
looking for them and later reported them missing to the police, he said.
''Officers carried out a search of the woodland and discovered
William's body at 5.40am. The second body was discovered at about 2pm by
police searching with dogs.''
Robbie Gee, an only child, lived with his parents Leonard and
Catherine Gee in a modern council house in Darleydale Drive, Eastham.
Paul Barker lived with his parents and 11-year-old sister Hannah in
nearby Haygarth Road.
They had known each other since they were at primary school. Then they
moved up to South Wirral High School at Eastham, where they were in the
same class.
''Both Robbie and Paul were dead nice, not at all cheeky,'' said one
of their friends, 16-year-old Lee Byrne, last night. ''They grew up
together and were inseparable. Everyone around here just can't believe
this has happened.
''Robbie and Paul did everything together. They were great mates,''
added Lee. ''Robbie played on the wing for two local school teams,
Parkdale and Haygarth.''
Another friend, 14-year-old Helena Griffiths, said: ''This hasn't sunk
in yet. We can't believe it.''
She said Robbie Gee was keen on his Super Nintendo computer game and
supported local football teams Liverpool and Tranmere Rovers.
''He used to go mainly to Tranmere games but also Liverpool,'' she
added. ''Robbie was a great sportsman.''
The holiday town of Llandudno, thronged with holidaymakers at this
time of year, has been shocked by the abduction and murder of little
Sophia Hook.
Mr Jones appealed to anyone who could help with information, and in
particular night-time fishermen.
He said police did not know whether the girl had been physically
abducted or enticed from the tent.
A six-year-old boy cousin had also been with them until midnight, but
then went back into the house. His father then checked that the trio in
the tent were all right.
Mr Jones said he was anxious to trace a man of about 30, just under
6ft tall with very dark, collar-length hair who had been seen in the
area. He had a tanned complexion and was wearing a denim shirt and
jeans. He was riding a black bicycle and police would like to hear from
anyone who knows his identity -- or from the man himself. If he was not
involved he could then be eliminated from inquiries.
The Sun newspaper last night offered rewards of #10,000 to anyone who
supplied information that led to the arrest and conviction of the brutal
killers of Robert Gee and Paul Barker or Sophia Hook.

MANY savers are currently tempted to spread their nest eggs between
several accounts in the hope of hitting on the building society which is
next to become a bid target.
They will, however, probably make a better return if they simplify the
number of accounts they have but pick them more carefully. If you use an
independent financial adviser it means you can make more money without
having to work for it and the gain could be several hundred pounds a
year.
''Take for example a married couple who have separate bank accounts,''
said John Murray, above. ''The husband pays tax on his savings, the wife
does not. By simply transferring funds from the husband's account to the
wife's the couple can make a substantial addition to their savings.''
IFAs will carry out interest rate checks to make sure you are getting
the highest rates of interest possible. ''It doesn't matter if the
client has #5000 or #50,000,'' said Murray, of John Murray and Company.
''Reorganising their banking should still earn them more interest on
their account.''
Someone with savings of #18,000 can increase interest payments by
simply reorganising their savings. For a non-taxpayer, increased
interest could be as much as #563, and the basic rate taxpayer could add
to his or her savings by as much as #320 a year.
''It would appear that most people have more than one bank or building
society account -- in fact, some have quite a few,'' said Murray. ''An
interest rate check and reorganisation of savings can show that having
several accounts is not terribly efficient and could be costing you
several hundred pounds per year.''
An interest rate check will also point out any defects in your savings
plans, and advise of any changes which may be needed.
''It never ceases to amaze me how many people lose out by not
organising their banking in the correct fashion,'' said Murray. ''Almost
everyone who has a number of bank and building society accounts could
improve their position at least a little, some by many hundreds of
pounds per annum.''
All but one of the top 10 banks or building societies are limited to
giving advice on their own financial products. An IFA can scan the full
range of the market, and suggest accounts with any bank or building
society.
Interest rate checks are carried out free of charge. You can now get a
free check from any IFA.
An IFA will not automatically recommend that you put all your savings
into one or two accounts. He or she will first consider how much cash
you need readily available, and how much you can leave at, for example,
90 days' notice.
The amount of interest you need each month is also considered, as well
as your reasons for having more than one or two accounts.
''The most important thing an IFA can do is listen to their clients,''
said Murray. ''Once listened to carefully we can answer their questions
and -- normally speaking -- improve on the interest being received
before anyone starts talking about personal equity plans, unit trusts,
investment bonds or whatever.
''Obviously full financial planning is important, but an interest rate
check could be the first step in the process.''

First day at work? Time to start planning your retirement -- that
would be Roger Jamieson's advice, although he realises it is a little
unrealistic.
''Planning for retirement should start on your first day in work,'' he
said. ''Unfortunately it very rarely does. Different pressures,
different priorities often mean planning for retirement is put off until
later and very often until too late.''
It is no longer possible to rely solely on the state to provide for
your retirement. The emphasis is on the individual to look after him or
herself, but many do not realise that failure to start planning early
enough could result in a drastic cut in income later in life.
''Already many people have taken the responsibility for their own
pension planning,'' said Jamieson, right. ''An IFA is well placed to
help these people choose their most suitable retirement strategy.''
Unlike insurance company representatives who can offer only their own
company's products, an IFA is independent and his obligation is to his
or her client. He has a duty to help you make the most of your money and
find the retirement plan best suited to your means. By examining your
financial situation determining exactly how much you can afford to put
into the pension fund, and finding out from you exactly what you want in
retirement, he or she can find exactly the right pension plan for you.
With every available plan to choose from, your chances of finding the
right one are substantially increased.
Many people are unaware that they have retained pension benefits from
previous employers. An IFA can examine such retained benefits and assess
their worths to the client.
Most employers' pension schemes are calculated only on basic earnings,
when real earnings may be much higher. By failing to take into account
bonus payments, overtime, commission etc, this further reduces the
amount of pension benefits received in retirement.
Many people have pension arrangements with more than one company. The
IFA will find out about these arrangements and incorporate them into one
meaningful plan. It is essential to start planning for retirement at an
early stage.
As well as giving you the best possible pension, early planning allows
you to position other financial plans -- such as loans or mortgages --
to mature on or before retirement.
Most financial plans are bought and then forgotten. Pension plans are
different. They should be made an integral part of all your financial
decisions, and should be constantly reviewed and developed to make sure
they will provide you with what you want when you retire.
''Everything should complement your pension planning, not the other
way round,'' said Jamieson. ''One major pension provider in the eighties
used the expression 'the longest holiday of your lifetime' to describe
retirement.
''I would suggest spending the same amount of time every year planning
your pension as planning your holidays..''
An IFA will always take the broad view. All your financial
requirements will be taken into consideration and used to draw up a
long-term strategy which will be constantly monitored and adapted to
suit any change in circumstances.
Pension income is treated as earned income by the state and is
therefore taxable so it is important to make sure you have allowed for
pension income tax in your plans.
''As well as ensuring you have taken control of your pension planning
you should also examine the tax benefits, breaks and allowances that are
available,'' says Jamieson.
''Married couples should equalise both capital and income, and
individuals should be looking at ways to build up capital within
tax-free environment.''
It takes time to build up a complete and comprehensive pension plan.
''The earlier all of these issues are addressed the better,'' said
Jamieson. ''By setting sensible, achievable goals early on it should be
possible to achieve acceptable levels of income in retirement.''

HOW much choice do you have when it comes to finding a mortgage? Half
a dozen high street banks? The top ten building societies?
In fact there are more than 1500 mortgage products available from more
than 120 providers. The question is: how can you find the right mortgage
for you?
The bank or building society will not recommend products other than
their own, and with so many alternatives, most people simply go for the
easiest option. It is not, however, necessarily the option which will
best suit your circumstances. ''If you go to your bank or building
society you get the choice of only one lender and only one set of
products,'' said independent financial adviser John Chiesa, pictured
right.
''Your building society isn't going to tell you that the bank across
the road has a better rate and even if its own rate is good, conditions
of the mortgage may not suit.''
These conditions might include insurance to cover repayments if you
are no longer able to work, or simply the repayment method itself. Going
to your bank or building society may secure you the finance, but how do
you know you're getting the best deal on everything that goes with it?
An independent financial adviser can guide you through the maze of
mortgages and related financial products to make sure you end up with
the right package.
''Your IFA acts on your behalf, not on behalf of the lender,'' said
Chiesa. ''He or she is obliged to discuss your requirements in detail
and then research the market in order to find the product best suited to
your needs.
''We look at all the considerations. Does the client need a fixed or
capped rate or a discount mortgage? It is portable? What repayment
options are available?''
Even if you already have a mortgage, it is not too late to consult an
IFA. It is still possible to find a better product through
re-mortgaging.
This means moving your mortgage from one provider to another to take
advantage of more favourable terms and conditions. Again, an IFA will
review the mortgage you already have, and, if necessary, help you to
find the one that suits you more.
Some IFAs will charge a flat fee for this service, others might
receive some commission from the mortgage provider. A flat fee could be
as little as #250 to help you change your mortgage. ''We don't accept
commission from mortgage providers when charging a fee,'' said Chiesa.
''If that is offered then it is refunded to the client or put towards
the fee.''
There are other costs involved. The total cost including surveys,
legal fees and IFA's fee would commonly be #600 and #700. This can
usually be added to the loan if that is what the customer wants.
''There are people paying far more on their mortgages than they have
to,'' said Chiesa. ''Talking to an IFA about moving your mortgage could
save you -- in the long run -- thousands of pounds.''
Moving a variable rate mortgage of #50,000 at 8.45% for example, could
make an interest rate saving of 6.11% -- as much as #250 each month, or
up to #3000 a year.
It's worth a visit to your IFA even if you are satisfied with your
current mortgage. ''We will not advise our clients to move unless it is
absolutely certain they will be better off,'' said Chiesa.
The amount you borrow initially will only be about a third of the
amount you eventually repay. A #50,000 mortgage at 8.5% (gross) paid
back over 25 years will cost approximately #156,000 in total. With this
kind of investment it makes sense to ''shop around'' for the best
product. An IFA can help you make sense of all the available options.
''If you were planning to spend #50,000 on a car you wouldn't see only
one manufacturer -- you'd shop around for a wider choice,'' said Chiesa.
''Why should looking for a home be any different.''
* Remember, your home is at risk if you do not keep up repayments on a
mortgage or other loans secured on it.

PULP fiction used to be a derogatory term for a cheap (and decidedly
uncheerful) form of crime fiction which emanated from the US in the
1930s, initially through a magazine called The Black Mask. Today it's a
highly respected description for an extremely popular -- and constantly
revived -- literary style. Hollywood wunderkind Quentin Tarantino even
made a movie of the books last year.
Next Friday BBC2 blags the term for a short series of programmes which
investigate film noir. It opens on Friday with a smashing documentary, a
showing of the 1955 (pardon the cliche) classic-of-the-genre, The Big
Combo, and the first episode of Fallen Angels, six half-hour noir dramas
assembled with loving care by veteran director Sydney Pollack. Among the
stars involved in this gem of a series are Alan Rickman, Laura Dern,
James Woods, Joe Mantegna, and Gary Oldman with both Tom Hanks and Tom
Cruise in the director's chair.
The term film noir was coined by a group of French film critics to
describe that type of American movie which was characterised by, among
other things, its dark and sombre mood, and cynical often pessimistic,
tone.
The film noir genre essentially spanned a 15-year period covering the
forties and the early fifties. Typically, it involved the dark and
gloomy underbelly of America. The crime and corruption. The protagonist
was usually a cynic and a loner -- a private detective was regularly
employed to fit the bill.
In terms of cinematic style, the film noir was usually on an urban set
with many (if not most) of the scenes shot at night. The sets were
characteristically low-life and the lighting stressed the lines and
shadows of a fatalistic mood. Monochrome, of course, was a prerequisite.
The genre is generally regarded to have started with John Huston's The
Maltese Falcon in 1941, and to have ended with Orson Welles' Touch Of
Evil in 1958. In fact, if you want to be pedantic about it (as movie
buffs are oft times apt to be) it actually started in 1940 with an
obscure B-movie called Stranger On The Third Floor and still continues,
albeit periodically, today through movies like Chinatown, Body Heat,
Night Moves, The Grifters, Homicide, and even Ridley Scott's futuristic
thriller, Blade Runner.
Tarrantino's Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction serve to bring the genre
right up to date.
The film noir's literary antecedents can be traced back to the
aforementioned Black Mask fiction, specifically to the works of three
remarkable writers. Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and James M.
Cain.
Between them Hammett and Chandler created the hard-boiled detective
hero, the flawed characters of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe; role models
for the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of fictional gumshoes who followed
them, .38 automatic in hand, down those mean streets.
These two writers turned the classic crime novel on its head. No
longer was it simply a suspect-filled mystery which solved itself in the
final chapter. Whodunnit was relegated to the subs' bench. Now you had a
tough operative who, through his emotional and moral commitment, was
more concerned with truth and justice than with the identification of
the guilty party.
If Hammett and Chandler introduced the hard-boiled detective to the
screen then James M. Cain was the champion of the femme fatale. Three of
his novels were made into classic films noir -- Double Indemnity, The
Postman Always Rings Twice, and Mildred Pierce.
At the heart of each story is sexual temptation, specifically a
woman's seduction of a decent man into the commission of a murder.
Curiously, the film noir's halcyon day -- the forties and fifties --
was a period when the Hollywood industry was governed by an
extraordinarily strict code of ethical conduct. The self-regulatory Hays
Code, as it was known, ran from 1930 till 1966. It set forth the general
standards of good taste and decency and was effectively a list of what
you could and could not put into a movie.
Among its general principles was the requirement that ''no picture
shall be produced which will lower the standards of those who see it.
Hence the sympathy of the audience should never be thrown to the side of
crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin''. Such noble intentions put the film
noir's gas on a peep.
In the early thirties, when the code was enforced to the letter,
Hollywood was unable to make movies like the powerfully sexual The
Postman Always Rings Twice (though one studio had bought the rights and
was anxious to do so). Indeed, it was not until the outbreak of the
Second World War that the code was relaxed.
Friday night's documentary, The Film Noir Story, is immediately
followed by a showing of Joseph H. Lewis's 1955 classic, The Big Combo,
starring Cornel Wilde and Richard Conte. It is a film about as sparse
and bleak as they come, and a late but perfect example of the genre.
Earlier the same evening you can see the first episode in the Fallen
Angels series, ''Since I Don't Have You'', is written by James Ellroy
and is set in 1940 Los Angeles. Gary Busey stars as Buzz Meeks, a PI
who's employed by both Howard Hughes (Tim Matheson) and bagman gangster
Mickey Cohen (James Woods) to find the same dame.
* THAT durable period comedy drama, The Tales Of Para Handy, makes a
welcome return (Monday, BBC1) with the first of three new episodes from
BBC Scotland based on Neil Munro's famous characters. In ''The Fortune
Teller'', written by Michael Russell and directed by Colin Gilbert, the
Vital Spark, en route to Tarbert, stops off to visit the shows at
Crinan. When an audience with Madam Isis, the local fortune teller,
convinces Para Handy (Gregor Fisher) and Dougie (Sean Scanlan) that
there's treasure to be found at sea, the gruesome twosome make a pact to
keep the fortune to themselves.
Relations between the crew become fraught as Dougie and the skipper
start to behave very suspiciously as the search begins for a sunken
Spanish galleon. Gentle, if a little predictable, humour featuring a
host of well kent-faces.
* YOU really know you've made it as a writer when they put your name
in the title of the TV version of your book. Hence Stephen King's The
Tommyknockers (Channel 4, Tuesday/Wednesday), a two-part shocker set in
Haven, Maine, a picture-postcard, cute-as-apple-pie, town which, once
you cut through the crust, has more dysfunctional relationships than you
could shake a stick at.
There's Gard Gardener, the local poet who, when he's not hitting the
bottle, is having an affair with Bobbi Anderson, the local western
novelist.
Then there's the town's lady sheriff who has an admirer in state cop
Butch Dugan. Meanwhile, a couple of hyperactive neighbourhood kids are
being scared witless by lurid tales from their grandpappy about strange
goings-on in Big Indian Woods, once a sacred burial ground for the local
injuns.
Peyton Place meets The X Files as funny things begin to happen in this
torrid tale of love, evil, and obsession in small-town USA. Jimmy Smits
hangs up his NYPD badge to star in this enjoyable piece of hokum.
* A RARE treat for ageing rock music fans is Jimi Hendrix at the Isle
of Wight (Channel 4, Thursday). In the early hours of August 31, 1970,
just 18 days before he died, the legendary guitarist walked on stage to
deliver what is generally regarded to be one of his greatest
performances. Half a million people -- more than Woodstock -- came to
the Isle of Wight for the last of the great spirit of the sixties tribal
gatherings. This minimalist, no frills film, by Oscar-winning director
Murray Lerner, captures Hendrix at his finest.
There is no fancy camera work, no shots of the crowd, no interviews.
Just the man. Arguably the greatest guitarist in the world, he plays All
Along The Watchtower, Voodoo Chile, and (after being reminded how the
tune went) God Save The Queen.
* BBC Scotland moves into uncharted territory with a prime-time
Saturday slot for The Trev and Simon Summer Special, a light
entertainment pilot from Queen Margaret Drive's comedy unit. Trev and
Simon, for the benefit of those who are not Going Live fans, are a
comedy duo who specialise in wacky characters (they are actually quite
funny). The one-off show, which could be turned into a series if it's
successful, features Letita Dean (Sharon from Eastenders) and music from
D:Ream.

MAD dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun. They're clearly not
the only ones: Glaswegians on their lunch breaks do it too. And with a
considerable amount of style. Promenade through the shopping precincts
of Argyle and Buchanan streets and you'll find most of this season's
looks being paraded with panache -- even at the height of the heatwave.
Unlike the males of the city, Glaswegian women, it would appear, don't
automatically strip off at the first hint of heat. Rather, they dress up
for it. Or maybe they simply make more of an effort. In the winter a big
coat can cover a multitude of sartorial sins, but in the summer's sizzle
there's nothing to hide your fashion disasters.
Women who will happily stomp around the winter pavements -- snow or no
snow -- are now slinking around the city in dainty, but sexy, summer
shoes; strappy sandals or black mules that wouldn't look out of place on
the pedal extremities of film noir femmes fatales like Lana Turner or
Barbara Stanwyck are what Glaswegians' fashionable feet are strutting.
Maybe it's the influence of Pulp Fiction's Uma Thurman that's making
everyone paint their toes and the town red in sandally stilettoes. Or
maybe it's the practicalities of the design, since these shoes have a
dual pain purpose: they inflict discomfort on anyone who wears them for
longer than it takes to slither in and out of a taxi, and on any
unsuspecting, and over-hopeful, male who makes a nuisance of himself to
the wearer. Boys beware: check her feet before you dare to ask her out.
Dresses of all shapes and sizes are definitely a hit with Glasgow
women this summer. The shift may be the most businesslike, but it's not
the coolest. On a sunny city day, longer, flowing frocks can catch
whatever breeze there is.
Whereas the shift looks better -- and is mainly available -- in single
colours or big checks, the full-length dresses donned on the streets of
Glasgow range from thirties tea dresses, in silky floral prints, to
Brigitte Bardot-style gingham. Black and white seems to be perenially
popular choice, but to really stand out, bright -- and particularly red
and citric -- shades are the best bet.
The sarong lives on. The skirt that gave Dorothy Lamour her nickname
would seem to be more popular than ever, whether in batik patterns or in
pencil-thin black. Worn with a body-suit, it's as demure and ladylike as
a skirt that splits halfway up your legs every time you move, can be.
Worn with a cropped top and high heels it sends out a sexy, but
no-messing with me, message.

IF GOD had wanted the scots to be Sun-seekers he wouldn't have made so
many of us freckled red-heads. Unless, of course this is his idea of a
cosmic barbecue with us the sizzling cocktail sausages. However in true
Scottish style we've risen to the challenge and complained. After months
of bitter whingeing about the extension of winter weather with snow
showers in May, we may have changed clothes but not the record.
Now it's too hot. The sun's too bright. Our clothes are too heavy.
Abroad, friends are cursing their luck. What's the point of foreign
travel if not to look down, as it were, on Scotland's rain-lashed shores
from the heady heights of an Ibiza veranda. Scots are not used to the
sun. While summer remains a season in most countries, most years we're
happy if we can stretch it out over a weekend.
We expect sunstroke in Sicily but not in Sauchiehall Street. Really
who would believe it? Well, those with bad burns like sun tattoos won't
forget in hurry. But how can we keep our cool while the mercury climbs?
Here are top tips for sun worshipers and their little burnt disciples:
* Slip on a shirt. Baggy T-shirts -- yes. Skimpy sundresses -- no. The
best choice is loose-weave cotton while short tops and dresses expose
the vulnerable areas of the shoulders -- the most common spots for
sunburn -- and let labourers leer.
* Slap on a hat. Outside of the catcher's box, sun-scorched streets
are really the only legitimate location in which to wear a baseball cap
backwards. The brim can lend extra protection for your neck. This
however leaves you to burn your nose and spite your face.
* The easy answer is to wear one baseball cap backwards and one
forwards or sell both and buy an explorer's pith helmet. This however
will bring on the extra cost of a matching short-sleeved safari suit a
la Roger Moore's James Bond.
* Slop on the sun block. Aussie coloured zinc blocks may lend you the
look of a groovy red indian but leave the striped look to the deranged
sun-stroked skier. If you're fair, go for a factor of around 15 and rub
it in. Or leave it to your boyfriend/girlfriend's nimble fingers and a
whole new meaning to fun in the sun.
* Beware the mounting melanomas. Cases of skin cancer increased by
156% between 1978 and 1988. Sun-screens can protect you from burning but
not from skin cancer. Remember: rubbing oil in is really asking to fry
like steak mince!
* Cancer kills and key risk factors for melanomas include: having more
than 20 moles; more than three moles with a diameter wider than the
blunt end of a pencil; a tendency to freckle; three or more exposures to
extreme sunburn.
* Beware the noonday sun. This line should really be shouted by an
East European vampire slayer. The hottest part of the day falls between
11am and 3pm. So while all your colleagues are outdoors simply say
you'll have a salad in the staff canteen.
* Seek the shade. Parasols are posh umbrellas but both will shade you
from the sun. Never wear an umbrella hat. For as sure as it'll rain when
the schools break up, someone gets their picture taken wearing one. They
never recover. We never forget.
* Look cool, feel cool. This doesn't necessarily add up but it feels
like it should. Especially after shelling out 80 quid for a pair of
Rayban sun- shades. Yet shades without an ultra-violet filter are as
useful as the wired bottoms of milk bottles.
* Water pistols are wasted on the young. Especially the high-powered
ones that allow you to resemble the West German police. Drenched friends
will often complain, ignore them. They love it!
* As a last resort, drive to Greenock. It is always raining in
Greenock.

THE Italian Centre is Mediterranean Glasgow. A place in which to see
and be seen. It's where appearance and attitude meet over cappuccino and
pasta. A significant addition to the scene is i santi of Milan.
This is a leather shop with bags of style. It is an established
business, still in the hands of the founding family. There are 30 i
santi outlets in Italy and one in New York. Their first shop in the UK
is in Glasgow though i santi travel goods are available at Heathrow's
Terminal 3.
Smart city bags, curved at the top, flat at the base, send out
messages of confidence. Night owls and glitterati might opt for the
black patent handbags or little quilted numbers with long gilt chain.
For the young at heart there are yellow leather bum bags which
separate into three pochettes. Small circular shoulder bags in brightly
coloured ostrich skin are chic and cheerful. And in best Italian
tradition, even the casual and sport items look stylish, the tan leather
rucksacks and large squashy crescent shaped bags in canvas or nylon with
leather trim.
The i santi signature is discreet, their name on a little gilt disc,
or even less conspicuous initials stamped into a soft leather purse. For
up front, up town girls, big chunky letters spell out i santi along the
handle of a dashing cotton shoulder bag.
Open a classic dark wallet and the compartments inside are in red,
blue and green leather, beautifully finished. This leads inevitably to
the sordid subject of money. Glaswegians, like Italians have long been
prepared to lash out the cash if the product and, of course, the label
are right. When referring to Italian specialities it's as well to say
''from'' so coin purses are from #20, wallets from #50, casual bags from
#75 and leather from #150 with briefcases starting at #200.
As with so many European designer names, i santi have their own silk
ties, eau de parfume, and gifts such as key rings and diaries. Purchases
come in a box and go in a named carrier bag to swing along the
passegiata (walk or stroll) round the Italian Centre, to have and to
hold and of course to show off.
* i santi, Unit 5, The Italian Centre, Ingram Street, Glasgow
(0141-552 5202). Hours of opening: Monday-Saturday 9.30-6pm.
