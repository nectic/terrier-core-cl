IN the largest survey of its kind, 5000 parents have made known their
views on a wide range of aspects of boarding education. Close to a third
(31%) said they had chosen the boarding option because they considered
it imbued children with confidence, maturity and independence.
The survey, The Best of Both Worlds, published by ISIS (Independent
Schools Independent Service) and the Boarding Schools Association (BSA),
provides the other side of One Big Family, a survey carried out two
years ago by the same organisations, which looked at the views of school
boarders.
Interestingly, 42% of families who had chosen the boarding route were
parents neither of whom had been boarders, while in almost a third (31%)
of the families taking part, neither parent had been independently
educated.
The survey covered schools of all types from preparatory and senior,
through independent and state, to single-sex and co-educational. Amost
all parents (87%) said they had taken their children's views into
consideration before choosing boarding for them, and most believed their
relationship with their offspring had either improved or been unaffected
by boarding.
Close to half (47%) of all boarders, the survey revealed, live within
an hour's drive of home, and 40% of parents had considered day
education, prior to making the decision on boarding.
With the exception of state school parents, the extra-curricular
benefits of boarding were mentioned more often than academic education,
as reasons for choosing a boarding school.
One in five parents surveyed had chosen the boarding option because
they worked overseas, or were serving in the armed forces.
Two thirds of UK-based boarders are visited by their parents three or
more times a term, while almost all of this group (90%) spend at least
one night at home during term time, in addition to half terms. 54% spend
four or more nights at home.
95% of boarders phone their parents several times a term, with more
than half ringing once-weekly; almost a quarter phone home serveral
times a week. Rather sadly reflecting the age of instant communications,
only one boarder in 10 (11%) now write a weekly letter home, while
almost half (48%) of all boys who board, never write home.
Most of the boarding parents said they knew other families with
children boarding, but most said also, that they had had to defend their
decision to choose this type of education to other parents, less
convinced of their beliefs.
Alan Underwood, chairman of the BSA and headmaster of Moira House
School, Eastbourne, said: ''This report should reassure any parent who
has any doubts about the value of boarding. In it, parents describe
candidly, their own feelings about boarding and, above all, the
overwhelming view that it is an unique and thoroughly worthwhile
experience.''
AMONGST their reasons, for opting for the boarding route for their
children, parents listed the following:
...Boarding offers a fuller education.......59%
...Facilities...............................58%
...Teaches independence.....................55%
...School's academic reputa tion............48%
..Teaches teamwork and co-operation.........43%
...Available day schools, not satisfactory..42%
...Sporting opportunities...................42%
...Child wanted to board....................40%
...Quality of pastoral care.................29%
...Single sex/co-educational................24%
...Both parents at work.....................12%
...Family reasons...........................11%
...Parents attended same school..............7%
...Child needed more supervision.............5%

INDEPENDENT education in Scotland accounts for just under 4% of the
total pupil population - 3.9% to be exact - less than half the
corresponding figure for England and Wales.
In terms of actual numbers, this means that 31,038 boys and girls
attend independent schools in Scotland, out of a total pupil population
of 840,748 (last available figures).
So what are likely to be the thinking processes which lead parents to
opt for independent education which is, in most people's terms, a
substantial financial commitment?
There are many, not least flexibility and innovation.
Smaller classes mean that pupils enjoy much more individual attention
from teachers, who are able to build on the potential and strengths of
each boy or girl.
Then there is the breadth that such an education should offer: art,
music and drama; sport and outdoor activities; societies of all kinds.
Social skills and confidence are acquired across a wide range of
areas, such as public speaking, team events, community service, the
combined cadet force in some schools, and visits abroad.
From this width of experience and vision, it is hoped to produce a
person who has lively interests, self-discipline, and the good manners
which are the manifestation of consideration for others, quite apart
from any academic achievement.
The majority of independent schools have a good record in public
examinations and, important as this undoubtedly is, most enlightened and
aware parents will not regard this as the sole benchmark when choosing
an independent school.
The building of character, independence and confidence, engenders the
ability to lead, and perform well as part of a team - essentials in the
competitive workplace of today, and doubtless in that of the future.
The style, goals and ethos of independent schools vary widely. They
offer is the choice of single sex or co-educational; day or boarding, or
weekly boarding. Their location may be a city or town, or in the heart
of the country, and while the majority are inter-denominational, some
schools cater specifically for a particular denomination.
You may seek a preparatory school - which could well cover a nursery
department - which will take children up to the age of 12, either as a
day or boarding pupil, or you may choose an all-through school which can
take children from nursery stage through junior school, right up to
university entrance.
It may be that you are already familiar with a particular school which
you feel is ideally suited to your child. On the other hand, many
parents - and the majority these days have not themselves been educated
at an independent school - will be starting from scratch, and trying to
assess which school will be best suited to their son or daughter. Local
knowledge and personal recommendation may well be your best guide, and
looking at current and past pupils can also be a useful exercise.
Perhaps the best starting point for those with no particular axe to
grind is to get a copy of the directory of independent schools in
Scotland, Which School? It can be obtained from SCIS/ISIS, Floor 2/1, 11
Castle Street, Edinburgh EH2 3AH. Tel: 0131 220 2106.
While this organisation cannot recommend particular schools to
parents, Rose Bell of ISIS (Independent Schools Information Service) is
always happy to help with questions of a general nature.
Within Which School? you will find general information and a list of
all 76 schools which are members of the Scottish Council for Independent
Schools (SCIS). It gives details of pupil numbers at the schools, the
age range and term fees, and whether it is a day or boarding school,
co-ed or single sex. It outlines the various methods of entry, public
examinations taken, and the range of financial assistance which may be
available at each school.
It is most important that visits are made to the schools which are of
particular interest. This allows you to talk to the head and ask him any
questions which may be in your mind. It gives also the opportunity to
get a feel for the school, its pupils and the facilities as well as
asking about the curriculum, and taking note of the interaction between
staff and pupils.
The first rule about such a visit is to make the most of it. Prepare a
list of basic questions which can be added to as you glean more
information and are shown around. On no account allow yourself to feel
intimidated: some parents find themselves reduced to nervous wrecks on
crossing the threshold of a school after years of absence, and feel more
like naughty pupils than potential customers.
Most heads these days are friendly and approachable, and are only too
willing to answer questions from parents.

YOU'VE decided that independent education is your goal, but then comes
the crunch question: how are you going to pay for it?
Without the advantage of generous grandparents or fairy godmothers,
the earlier planning starts, the better.
Despite many parents being well aware of the advantages of advanced
planning for school fees, surprising numbers fail to take the necessary
steps.
Anthony Hastings is a director of the School Fees Insurance Agency
Limited, which has specialist representatives around the country,
including Scotland. He says: ''With capital there are many investment
vehicles which can be used with varying degrees of risk associated with
them.
''They range from bonds to PEPs and TESSAs through to specialised
educational trust schemes designed specifically to meet the costs of
education. Many plans have tax advantages which can prove attractive,
not only in terms of increased benefits for school fees, but also for
estate (tax) planning.''
Planning from income also gives advantageous and tax-effective paths
to savings.
''Again there are speculative products (unitised life assurance
products and PEPs) or the more traditional with-profits endowment
policies,'' Mr Hastings says.
''Use of the plan not only provides savings on the future costs, but
also can include life assurance protection so that fees can still be met
in the event of a parent's death.''
But what happens when the going gets tough, and parents find it hard
to pay the fees when they arrive? This is where loan plans come in. They
can be secured on the value of property, or unsecured, and often they
are at very competitive rates of interest. You can draw down against an
agreed loan as termly fees arrive (both at school and further education
levels) and pay back the loan over 10 to 15 years.
''The benefits of these arrangements are that a potential crisis can
be avoided and the family can reorganise its cashflow to meet current
income rather than remove a child from school.
''Each plan is very much tailored to individual requirements and needs
- sometimes protection is important, in other cases there is an existing
policy which can be used. Whatever the position financially, if you are
decided on independent education, it's definitely worth planning for the
costs involved.''
SFIA can be contacted on 01628 502020.
Many schools offer financial assistance by way of the Government's
Assisted Places Scheme, or from their own Scholarship and Bursary
awards. In 1993/94, 16% of secondary pupils had all or part of their
fees paid through Assisted Places, 10.59% of the total independent
school population. Of these pupils, 45.7% pupils got full remission of
fees. The cost to the Government for 1994/95 is #10.25m.
Pupils normally join the scheme in the first year of secondary
schooling, although it is possible for admission to be made as young as
10 years old. It is also permissible to apply for an assisted place at
later stages.
The amount which will be given by the scheme towards fees, not
including a boarding element, is on a sliding scale, linked to family
income.
Parents seeking an assisted place should apply to the school at the
time of making an admission application. With strong demand for places,
applying early is advisable.

WHO is Scotland's best estate agent? A profession which gets its fair
share of pelters now has the chance to take the plaudits of its
customers - but only if the customer is satisfied. The search is on to
find Scotland's most helpful and professional estate agencies.
Nominations close on Tuesday 31 October for three three different
categories: independent agents, corporate agents, and management &amp;
lettings agents. The winners will go forward to compete for the title of
1995 Estate Agency Office of the Year award, which is promoted by UCB
Home Loans and the National Association of Estate Agents.
The awards, now in their fourth year, are based entirely on customers'
recommendations. Entries are open to those who have bought, sold, let or
rented a property, or are in the process of doing so, during 1995.
Entry forms are available at estate agents' offices. Recent buyers or
sellers are invited to submit a detailed questionnaire rating their
agent on a range of factors including: quality of service,
professionalism, and property knowledge.
TV presenter and customer affairs journalist Sue Cook will lead the
panel of judges, which includes Hamilton-based estate agent May Storrie,
president of the 9500-member NAEA.
''Moving house can be one of the most stressful things you can do in
life,'' says Sue Cook. ''Having a friendly, straightforward and
efficient estate agent makes all the difference. Last year, a record
6300 customers all over the UK filled in nomination forms answering
questions about their local estate agent, and it was very pleasing to
see how many agencies really took the trouble to give a high quality,
personal service to their customers.''
Winners from nine regions across the UK will be announced in January
1996. Regional winners will automatically go through to the finals and
the national winners will be announced at a London ceremony in February.
''Estate agents have in the past been the subject of both ridicule and
criticism, particularly in the media,'' says Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy, chief
executive of the NAEA. ''It is our hope that these awards will help to
redress the balance.''
Questionnaires are available from all participating estate agencies
which employ a fellow or associate member of the NAEA, or by telephoning
the special hotline - 0645 401 400.

THE Welsh dragon is breathing fire into the Scottish market. Redrow
Homes, which was established in North Wales 21 years ago, has acquired
its second Scottish site.
Having recently launched its development at Kittoch Muir in East
Kilbride, the firm has purchased a four-acre site at Dalgety Bay, in
Fife.
''This will set the ball rolling for further land acquisitions in
Scotland, particularly in the Central Belt,'' says regional director
John Anderson.
The Dalgety Bay site is off Harbour Drive, with views of the Forth
Bridge, and will be developed next year. Redrow has submitted plans for
39 detached homes from its Heritage range - a traditional house style
which has won the company awards in England and Wales.
''We've taken some of the best features of past architecture and
incorporated them into modern housing designs for today's living, hence
the Heritage name for our collection,'' says John Anderson.
In contrast, the company's two showhomes at Kittoch Muir are in
contemporary style. They promote a development of 100 three and
four-bedroom detached houses, with initial prices from #104,950 to
#135,000.

HOUSES are like faces: they begin to develop their own character when
they have been lived in for a while. Every house builder knows how
difficult it can be to create new homes that have an immediate sense of
character or tradition. Since instant character is a contradiction in
terms, the house buyer who wants to live in a modern home that looks as
if it has a history will usually have to seek out an old property that
has been totally renovated.
Fenwick Lodge Gatehouse on Ayr's Ewenfield Road is a good example of
the type. The building had a traditional purpose - as gatehouse,
chaffeur's quarters, and stabling for Fenwick Lodge - but has been
''rigorously refurbished and converted'', according to the selling
agent.
The property is of brick with slate roofs and the conversion has been
designed to create modern living space within a building which retains
its period charm. And while most gatehouses are characterised by
extremely small rooms, this property's previous multi-purpose use has
allowed the creation of large interior spaces.
The formal lounge measures 28ft by 13ft at its largest, and has a
cool, modern look to it with its oak hardwood floor and and long windows
overlooking the garden to the rear. Yet it is a thoroughly traditional
room with an original beamed ceiling, a minstrel gallery, and a huge
stone fireplace which completely fills one wall.
The living room is slightly larger, measuring almost 20ft by 19ft.
Having been created from the stables, this room retains some
characteristic features such as a wrought iron railing and stable doors.
The conversion also has a dining room, library, study, four bedrooms
and a nursery. The study, or fifth bedroom, was the former tack room.
Access to the main bedroom is by a spiral staircase from the lounge to
the minstrel gallery. Built under the eaves, the room has Velux windows
and an en-suite bathroom. The adjoining nursery could serve as a
dressing room.
Hardwood finishes have been used throughout the conversion and a great
deal of daylight comes into the house via Fench doors, Velux windows,
picture windows and half-height stable-style internal doors. There is a
cobbled courtyard to the front and mature gardens to the rear.
Murphy Scoular of Ayr is seeking offers over #195,000.

TOO many modern houses in the countryside look out of place. Suburban
designs dropped into a rural landscape can look truly awful, but
Cragmore Country house is one of the exceptions. Designed to fit its
setting close to the Perthshire village of Dunning, the house was built
by St Fillans-based Cragmore Ltd, a firm which specialises in
sympathetic designs for sensitive sites.
With its traditional country lines, the house has redwood timber
fittings, open fireplaces, and Victorian-style bathrooms. Accommodation
includes sitting room, dining room, sun lounge, four bedrooms, kitchen
and two bathrooms. The traditional design is carried through to the
detached garage.
''We aim to provide an individual product for an individual
customer,'' says Cragmore director John Spearing. ''Our previous
contracts have included involvement with the film industry and the
construction of sets for James Bond and Superman films at Pinewood
Studios. So, hopefully, we can cater for most demands!''
Cragmore country house is being sold by Edinburgh-based agents Brodies
at a fixed price of #175,000.
Close to Dunning lies St Andrews Cottage, which agents Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley says is a ''charming'' property standing in about two acres of
mature gardens and grounds. It has four bedrooms and three reception
rooms, in offers a separate two-bedroom bungalow.
Diarmid Mackenzie Smith of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley says: ''This is a
modest-size property that I feel would appeal to a large number of
potential buyers. It is not only a private and traditional-looking house
set in mature grounds but is extremely well located for any businesses
in Perth, Stirling, Glasgow or Edinburgh. The properties have been
realistically priced in order to ensure a swift sale.''
Offers over #135,000 are being sought for the house, and over #35,000
for the bungalow.

The range of autumn offers aimed at taking the pain and worry out of
housebuying is becoming larger all the time. Robert MacLeod looks at
some of the latest ideas from the builders.
THE autumn sales presentations already under way from Scotland's
housebuilders illustrate the way in which the majority are well aware of
the importance of the attractions of part-exchange when it comes to the
all-important customer.
More firms than ever now include bonus packages for interested
possible buyers, which is good news for the family wishing to buy a new
house but aware of uncertainties in terms of marketing their existing
home. It is also good news for the family interested in purchasing an
established home. Homes bought in part-exchange by a builder then
marketed for sale are keenly priced and are regularly listed with
attractive extras.
''The part-exchange side of the new house market has grown
tremendously in the past year or so,'' said a leading Scottish estate
agent.
''But people are mistaken if they think that part-exchange is any kind
of new idea. Early 'trade-in' schemes were operating in Scotland more
than 25 years ago.'' What has changed is the sheer size of the
operation.
One Scottish company last year recorded a #10m turnover of established
homes bought in from customers who wanted to acquire new homes on their
estates. Another, with developments scattered over most of the Central
Belt, confirmed that in a recent period almost half of the total number
of houses it sold either involved part-exchange or had part-exchange
option figures quoted along the way at the request of customers.
''We are in the business of building houses and selling houses,'' said
the sales director of one Glasgow-based builder. ''We don't see
part-exchange as a major source of revenue, but we see it as a service
which completes many a new house sale.
''Families considering buying a new house but concerned about selling
their present home would be well advised to study all the various
part-exchange schemes on offer to find out which is best suited to their
particular needs. But in basic terms it can be said that all
part-exchange services save time, worry and potential stress for many
would-be customers.
''It can also be said that these schemes offer significant savings on
the costs of marketing property, advertising and agency fees.'' Most new
showhouse locations now offer details of individual part-exchange
schemes. Some builders are prepared to consider properties anywhere in
Britain when families want to relocate to Scotland. A wide variety of
financial packages and various forms of assistance are appearing among
the autumn housebuilding offers.
Most schemes are geared to assist people moving up into a larger home
with an upward difference of value of perhaps around #20,000. But some
builders are now extending their schemes to cover people who want to
move into a smaller home.
''These people are sometimes regarded as trading down and may find
their larger properties can't be accepted for part-exchange,'' said the
national sales director of a builder working on 16 sites throughout
Scotland. ''They felt overlooked. Sheer demand made us decide to extend
our part-exchange scheme to include their situation.''
A typical part-exchange programme may have two independent valuations
carried out by professionals -- usually an estate agency and a building
society -- then an offer is made based on what is believed to be the
true market value of the existing home.
''We operate two separate schemes to make buying a new home easier for
our customers,'' said another West of Scotland sales executive, whose
company has 25 new house estates under way.
''Under one scheme we assume all responsibilities for selling the
customer's present home, which allows them to go ahead with their new
purchase straight away. Then we offer the old properties on the general
housing market at prices which are below the market value figure at
which the property was bought in.
''Our other scheme is where the company takes over the marketing
responsibilities including selling and advertising fees. If a buyer for
the customer's present home is found within an agreed period the
customer can go ahead. But if we can't find a buyer then the customer
has not incurred any expense in trying to sell.
''Both systems are designed to make it as easy as possible to sell one
house and buy another, avoiding fees and any possible concern about the
need for bridging loans.''
The world of part-exchange has grown to include partnership deals with
banks and building societies, allowing builders to make a wide range of
special bonus offers.
One builder currently offers a year of reduced-rate mortgage, with
free mortgage assurance for that period.
Another makes a contribution of up to #1000 towards a new buyer's
advertising and selling costs when selling their former home.
''Many people purchasing a new house are first-time vendors,'' said
one company's sales manager. ''They welcome professional help and the
kind of no-risks guarantees on offer.
''My advice to anyone would be to study the part-exchange schemes.
Many people will find that these schemes may contain the total answer to
any doubts or worries they have.''
Part-exchange properties bought in by builders over the past few
months have ranged from city flats at around #20,000 to large family
properties valued at close on #l5O,000. Not every property automatically
qualifies for part-exchange in a process which has been refined to make
it as speedy and trouble-free as possible.
Many firms now operate on the basis of a guaranteed and free-of-charge
offer being made on an existing property within seven days.
Established homes bought in and then later sold by the builder
concerned can be offered with extras which may range from redecoration
to new kitchen or bathroom fittings. One builder also offers furniture
packs on selected properties.
''Some attractive propositions are currently available,'' said one
sales executive. ''The builders involved see it as all a part of the
business of selling houses today.''

Bill Sinclair admires new CALA homes sure to appeal to discerning
buyers.
LONG famed for its quiet beauty, and its fine water and pure air,
Kilmacolm drew travellers from around the world in search of good
health.
The picturesque village nestling in the shelter of the scenic
Barclaven Hills dates back to around the seventh century, and the
building of a railway line in 1869 transformed it into a rural haven for
industrialists, who built many handsome manor houses, some of which
remain to this day.
Most important of these is Auchenbothie House, built in 1898 by
renowned Scottish architect William Leiper, and it is in the wooded
18-acre grounds of this spectacular, sprawling, baronial-style mansion
that CALA has created a stunning residential development.
Auchenbothie is approached by a long, wooded, sweeping drive which
opens out to reveal the stunning mansion and 15 imposing detached homes
set at different levels in its gently sloping, leafy grounds.
The development has been skilfully planned in three cul-de-sacs toward
the outer edges of the site, providing the residents with superb views
over the surrounding countryside, and leaving Auchenbothie House itself
standing proudly in a central landscaped area.
It is difficult to imagine a more charming setting in which to acquire
a modern home of the highest quality with village amenities close at
hand and only 20 miles from Glasgow city centre.
CALA's Kilmacolm development, which exemplifies the company's
tradition of creating luxury dwellings in some of Scotland's most
sought-after locations, consists of five different house styles at
prices ranging from #166,000 to #212,000.
Among the styles still available are the Cranbrook, at #166,000, a
four-bedroom home full of charming features, and an integral double
garage.
The superb master bedroom has steps to a gallery dressing area leading
to the en-suite bathroom.
A five-bedroom Vorlich, at #196,000, is a prime example of CALA's
excellence in design. Ground-floor accommodation includes a family room,
breakfasting kitchen, and utility room in addition to the large lounge
and dining room. A galleried hall forms the hub of the upper level,
leading to the bedrooms, family bathroom and roomy cupboards. The master
bedroom has a spacious en-suite bathroom with shower cubicle.
There is a choice of two magnificent Cruachan homes, at #195,000 and
#197,000. Double doors lead from the spacious lounge to the dining room,
and also on the ground-floor are a large kitchen/breakfast area, a
family room and a utility room. On the upper level are five bedrooms,
all accessed from a wide, galleried hall. The luxurious master bedroom
has a roomy en-suite bathroom with a shower and twin handbasins.
All the new homes at Auchenbothie boast stylish German kitchens,
individually designed, with Siemens double oven, gas or electric hob

GLASGOW announces a pilot project today in a continuing effort to
protect vulnerable tenants from the city's few unscrupulous landlords.
It is a scheme to license a range of houses with multiple occupation.
Bailie Craig Roberton, who is convener of the council's private sector
housing sub-committee, explains: ''A high percentage of Glaswegians
receive housing benefit and live in these multiple occupancies. They are
often very vulnerable people.
''Our pilot scheme will apply to establishments housing 10 or more
people, unrelated, and with at least two receiving housing benefit.
Landlords with these larger multiple occupancy properties have to apply
for this new licence.
''It will be effective from 30 September next year, and anyone failing
to comply with its conditions will lose the licence and have to close
the premises concerned.
''Application forms for this new licence will be available from
Monday.''
''Existing legislation does allow us to take action against landlords
in certain cases - failing to comply with fire regulations, for example,
but it is a very cumbersome process which does nothing to stop a
landlord from putting people at risk. Effectively, the few landlords
involved can pay a fine and carry on, regardless.''
The council estimates there are around 2500 houses in multiple
occupancy in Glasgow, with about half of them taking in five or more
tenants.
The new scheme deals with 150 of the larger premises in the city. It
does not relate to bona-fide tourist hotels, guest houses and similar
properties.
A set of 15 conditions will apply. These cover adequate means of
escape, provision of fire-fighting equipment, structural alterations,
noise control, maintenance of gas and electrical installations, waste
disposal and provision of amenities.
Properties will also be checked by the council department of
environmental health, and building control, with consultation from
planning and the Firemaster.
There is a licence fee of #430 and annual renewal fee of #330.

ONE of Scotland's best known schools, Glasgow Academy, alma mater to
many Scottish movers and shakers, celebrates its 150th anniversary this
year with a fine new music school, purpose-built on the edge of the
River Kelvin. It has named the Turner Building after Colin Turner, who
retired as rector in 1993 after 11 years, and who performed the opening
ceremony.
David Comins, the present rector, says: ''We've been honoured also by
a civic reception by Glasgow City Council in the City Chambers, at which
there was a wide representation of past pupils.''
The Academy started out 150 years ago, in the building which later
housed the High School, moving in 1888 to Colebrook Street, where it has
remained. In the early 1920s, the school was reconstituted as a war
memorial to the dead from the First World War, in common with a number
of other schools.
''I think that is significant, and has a bearing on what we do now,''
explains Mr Comins. ''We reformed, and are now run by the Glasgow
Academicals War Memorial Trust. With our 150th anniversary coinciding
with the 50th anniversary of VE Day and VJ Day, we've got a special act
of remembrance on November 10.''
In 1991 the school merged with Westbourne School for Girls. ''That's
going well,'' says David Comins. ''It would be wrong to say there have
been no hiccups, but the pupils are integrating superbly.
''The spin-off is so obvious to others who have been in co-educational
situations. In a discussion in English or history for example, you've
got immediately a wider range of opinion. The female perspective as well
as the male, on Romeo on Juliet, the Nazis or whatever. It's very
valuable from everybody's point of view.''
Among Glasgow Academy's best known pupils is Sir Iain Vallance,
chairman of BT, who will be speaking at the Academicals' dinner in
November. Others include Jeremy Isaacs; Lord Weir; a clutch of
politicians of every hue from Sir Michael Hirst and Donald Dewar to
Robert McLennan; Angus Grossart; and Sir Matthew Goodwin, who among his
many hats, wears that of chairman of the trustees at East Park Home for
Infirm Children in Maryhill.
For the Academy's 150th anniversary pupils are working hard to raise
#50,000 for the rebuilding of a wing for teenage girls.

A CENTURY and a half of independent education in Helensburgh is being
celebrated at Lomond School this month.
It was formed in 1977 following the amalgamation of Larchfield
Preparatory School, founded in 1845, and St Bride's School For Girls,
founded in 1895 (which, along with Park School in Glasgow and St
Columba's in Kilmacolm, originally formed The Girls' School Company).
Between them, its constituent roots have had as pupils such well known
names as John Logie Baird, Bonar Law, actress Deborah Kerr, and Iona
Colquhoun of Luss, now the Duchess of Argyll.
Today, Lomond - which is co-ed, naturally - has 454 pupils, 75 of them
boarders, and offers all-through education from nursery to university
entrance.
In addition to achieving public examination results ''generally more
than twice as good as the national average'', according to headmaster
Angus Macdonald, the school has distinguished itself in the field of
traditional music, as well as being the first Scottish school to enter a
team for the Scottish Islands, Peaks, Race.
Lomond was also the first school in Scotland to use Outward Bound, in
conjunction with which it devised a leadership and teamwork course for
its sixth-formers, which has evolved over the last five years and runs
over the whole of the pupils' final year.
The school has currently a Russian pupil, whose fees are paid by a
group of former parents, while a bursary fund has been set up which is
financed by German industrialists to enable East German pupils to study
at Lomond. At present, there are two such pupils.
In common with a number of other independent schools, Lomond's
transitus stage - primaries six and seven - has every subject except
English and maths taught by secondary specialist teachers.
''We are particularly conscious that it's not just a stretching of
primary youngsters, it is actually giving you scope through to fifth
year,'' explains Angus Macdonald.
''The classic problem in Scotland is the gap between Standard grade
and Highers, so part of that process is to look at what you are taking
from P7 onwards.
''If you enrich P7 with first-year material and methodology, then
second year is being enriched by third year, and by the time fourth year
is reached, halfway through it Standard Grade material will have been
covered easily, so that you are able to go on to enrich with Higher
material.''

EDINBURGH Ladies may be pressurising the leaders in the women's
league, but they could be treading on dangerous ground in the second
round of the League Cup.
They are scheduled to meet city rivals Royal High Gymnasts away, and
their passage to the next round is no foregone conclusion.
Gymnasts are one of the most improved sides in the country despite
their recent defeat by Western. Wendy Fraser, the Glasgow side's
player/coach, thought: ''Their young side competed well, particularly
after conceding a goal in two minutes.''
Edinburgh's cause will not be helped by the absence of Diane Renilson,
their captain, and top scorer Rhona Simpson. They will be in Cape Town
playing for Great Britain in an Olympic qualifying tournament.
Western will be involved in the only other all first-division clash
when they travel to Cramond to play Heriot Watt University.
Five Division 1 sides look set to progress along with three from
Division 2, Kelburne, Aberdeen Bon Accord, and Melrose Croall Bryson,
although they have drawn first division Boroughmuir. The Draw is:
Hyndland v Selkirk, Bonagrass Grove v Eglinton, Kelburne v Grove A,
Menzieshill v Dundee University, Royal High Gymnasts v Edinburgh Ladies,
Heriot Watt University v Western Klick Photopoint, Melrose Croall Bryson
v Boroughmuir, Carmuirs v Aberdeen Bon Accord. Ties to be played on
November 12.

<RECORDNO>975716488</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A NEW weight-checking scheme being introduced by the British Boxing
Board of Control today means that boxers must be close to their fighting
weight perhaps weeks before a big-fight to cut down the chance of
dehydration.
In the new list of safety measures to be announced in the wake of the
Jim Murray tragedy, a system of random weigh-ins in the weeks leading up
to title bouts to combat the effects of excessive loss of body fluid is
set to be put into operation.
It will be part of a report from an independent working party, headed
by neurologist Peter Richards, which was initiated after the death of
Bradley Stone 18 months ago.
Fighting men will no longer be able to afford to be over their
poundage target, to be fixed by the Board's doctors, in the week or
fortnight before a major contest -- otherwise there could be no fight.
The checks could happen at any time to any boxer. An across-the-board
system would be difficult to implement, but the surprise element will be
designed to keep fighters to their prescribed mark.
Weight-making is stamina sapping and a chief cause of dehydration, a
state which can make boxers more prone to serious injury. It was the
major reason why the Board moved weigh-ins to 24 hours before the event.
Late last year, the authorities got tough with the now-retired Chris
Eubank, who used to virtually cut out food and drink for a couple of
days before fights to boil down to the the super-middleweight limit.
They monitored Eubank's weight before his December fight against Henry
Wharton -- and a better-prepared Eubank produced one of his best
performances.
The more sophisticated Magnetic Resonance Imaging brain scans -- the
cost of which promoter Frank Warren has offered to underwrite for every
British boxer in the coming year -- will become compulsory and is more
advanced technology to the present CT scanning.
The scan provides a more in-depth search of the brain, pinpointing
problems that might not be located by a CT check and will provide the
sport's medical men and administrators with a vital preventative measure
to have at its disposal.
The rest periods for fighters stopped by knockout -- presently 28 days
-- could well be extended, and similar, temporary sidelining may even be
ordered for boxers involved in hard contests.
Longer time between rounds -- and indeed a reduction of rounds -- are
not expected to be part of the medical package.

BRIAN Irvine yesterday took another step on his comeback for Aberdeen
when he played for 90 minutes of his side's Premier Reserve League match
against Partick Thistle at Firhill.
Irvine, who suffers from MS, played last week against Ross County in a
friendly, and is aiming to beat the effects of the illness.
He looked good in the first 45 minutes, but, not surprisingly, tired
towards the end.
Aberdeen went ahead through Malcolm Kpedekpo after 30 minutes, and
stretched that lead through Michael Craig and Robert Bell.
Former Aberdeen player Ian Cameron started the Thistle revival from
the penalty spot in 60 minutes, the other goals in a 3-3 draw coming
from Stuart Ayton and Andy Gibson.

ABERDEEN returned north last night comforted by the warm glow of
victory over Rangers and the certainty of a major cup final appearance.
The team who were almost relegated last season are now in the final of
the Coca-Cola Cup, and their hero at Hampden was striker Billy Dodds.
He scored twice in the second half and these were the goals which have
now carried Aberdeen to a clash with either Dundee or Airdrie, who meet
in the other semi-final at McDiarmid Park, Perth, tonight.
It was only afterwards that Dodds revealed how fortunate the victory
had been. ''The second goal was a perfect cross from Steven Glass,'' he
said, ''but somehow, for a split second, I missed the ball in the
lights.
''I shut my eyes and then when I opened them, thankfully, it was there
again and I was able to head the ball beyond Andy Goram and into the
net.''
That slice of fortune apart, Aberdeen deserved their victory after a
second-half performance which left an injury-struck Rangers team
struggling.
''I thought that Eoin Jess was magnificent,'' said Dodds. ''He has
been playing well but that was something special. The manager kept
telling us that we could win, and he was right.''
Manager Roy Aitken, who took over at Pittodrie when the team were
battling against relegation, added: ''This was the kind of performance
we were looking for.
''I have maintained that we have the ability to mount a challenge at
the top, and I think we showed that tonight. But you must have hunger
and effort as well as ability to win trophies.
Rangers manager Walter Smith, who faces the club's annual meeting
tomorrow, said: ''We looked for a lift after our result last week
against Juventus, but it just was not there.
''They played well in the second half, but when Salenko scored I
thought we might have put them under some late pressure.
''Richard Gough failed a fitness test in the morning. It was the same
injury, obviously, which saw him come off against Hearts on Saturday.''
The Gough blow was one of the main problems for the Rangers side, who
also had David Robertson, Stuart McCall, Ian Ferguson, Charlie Miller,
and Brian Laudrup out of action.

DEREK McInnes must be the most sought-after player in Scotland. Morton
now have had six offers for midfield player -- all of which have been
rejected. Four English clubs have joined Rangers and Dundee United with
bids for McInnes, who wants to join the Ibrox club, but none of them has
yet topped the #300,000 bid by United, which was turned down 11 days
ago.
''We are not holding an auction for the boy,'' said Morton manager
Allan McGraw, ''but we want a reasonable fee. For Derek's sake I hope
things are sorted out soon, but when I think of the fees I have got for
players such as Mathie and Hopkins, I feel we are not being unreasonable
in expecting at least the same for Derek.''

NINA NOONE looks at the new #100,000 computer centre at Craigholme
School putting it at the forefront of technology.
TOMORROW Craigholme School in Glasgow, the largest girls' school in
the West of Scotland, celebrates its centenay with the official opening
of a #100,000 computer centre with 42 networked state-of-the-art
computers added to 50 existing free standing machines. It is the
culmination of a year of vigorous and successful fundraising.
The opening ceremony will be performed by Dr Myfanwy (Muffy) Thomas, a
senior lecturer in Computer Science at Glasgow University, who has a
keen interest in Women Into Computing.
Mrs Gillian Burt, now in her fifth year as headmistress of Craigholme,
heads a staff of 50. She says: ''The continuing success of any school
depends on the success of its pupils, which in turn depends on their
value in the increasingly competitive employment marketplace.
''To a large extent success will become reliant on a high-quality
education achieved through the use of information technology and
knowledge of relevant operating systems and software packages.
''In schools, many subjects now demand that pupils plan, research,
analyse and solve problems and prepare written and illustrated reports
using a multi-media approach. It is essential that pupils develop skills
which are becoming vital in tertiary education and the marketplace.
Without IT skills, and the ability to use modern library resources, it
will be increasingly difficult for pupils to progress in their chosen
careers.
''According to our suppliers, Research Machines, Craigholme will have
one of the most powerful computing systems in the country. The next
stage will hopefully be a library and resource area, the more expensive
of the two projects. It will have to be internally built because of
conservation restrictions on the exterior of our buildings.''
Situated in the quiet, leafy heart of Pollokshields on Glasgow's South
Side, Craigholme has a roll of 500 pupils and is an all-through
single-sex girls' school, although it takes boys from nursery (which
starts at age three) through to Junior 4.
Children benefit from specialist teaching in music and PE in Nursery.
''They appear on stage as Fagin's gang in the whole school musical,
Oliver,'' says Mrs Burt. French begins in J1.
''At Craigholme, computer education starts in the Nursery and goes all
the way through the school. My aim is that every girl will leave
Craigholme computer-literate. We now have a fully equipped computer room
and a fully equipped business studies room.
''Mrs Mary Kay teaches computer studies and mathematics, while Mrs
Elizabeth Beak is our business studies expert. Mrs Beak has brought in
all sorts of new courses, including the excellent recently-introduced
Higher Management Information Studies. It has a huge take-up in Scotland
and has wide application across a broad spectrum of careers.''
The school hopes also to develop an Open Access Centre for the wider
community to learn computing skills, which it will add to other adult
education facilities, such as cookery, a variety of art subjects and
creative writing.
There is a daily or occasional care facility for Junior School pupils
at modest charge, from 8-8.30am until 5.45pm in the evening.
Class sizes at Craigholme average 20 in the lower part of the Senior
School, 15-16 in the upper reaches, with still fewer in sixth year. In
the Junior School, classes average around 18.
Mrs Burt is supported by two deputy headmistresses, Mrs Maye McCallum,
head of the Modern Languages department, and Mrs Maureen Payne, head of
Modern Studies, and a head of junior school Mrs Allison Dryburgh.
''We are fortunate to have a super staff,'' says Mrs Burt, whose own
subject is geography. She came to Craigholme from St Margaret's School
for girls in Edinburgh, where she was in charge of Careers.
She said: ''As soon as I walked into this school I thought it felt
right -- and it has been. It has a busy, purposeful atmosphere.''
''My belief in parental choice is very strong, and I do wish that more
parents would exercise that right and go and visit more schools. More
and more are doing so, and increasingly parents are, quite rightly,
asking very searching questions.
''A school like this is almost an extended family,'' says Mrs Burt.
''I -- and every member of staff -- know every child in it and we have a
vertical house system where something like 60 or 70 girls are in the
charge of one person. I can mention any child, and everybody in the year
group and house knows who she is. That is the beauty of it.
''Yet it is not too small, because that can be too oppressive and
stultifying. Children need to work withi a stimulating environment which
is difficult to achieve in a class which is too small. I feel we have a
happy medium here.''
Although she is cautious about quoting examination results, those
achieved by Craigholme are impressive by anyone's standards. This year,
for example, while SCIS (Scottish Council of Independent Schools)
schools achieved Highers at S5 level which averaged 86% Passes at A --
C, Craigholme achieved 93%; CSYS Passes A -- C in SCIS schools averaged
80%, at Craigholme it was 88%. Standard Grade Credit 1 and 2 averaged
82% in SCIS schools, while Craigholme achieved 94%.
Interestingly, in addition to providing a broad curriculum for as long
as possible, and encouraging individual pupils to achieve their highest
possible standard, every girl must take at least one skills-based
modular course.
''Almost all girls go on to university of college -- last year 95%
went to university,'' says Mrs Burt. There are always some who take a
year out, or perhaps do a foundation year in arts in a further education
college, for instance.
Foreign exchanges to France and Germany have taken place over many
years and every girl is encouraged to become a competent linguist, a
skill viewed as a practical business tool of today. Next October will
see a group set off for Spain.
''Last summer the head of Geography organised her second trip to China
-- which we study in Modern Studies. I was on the first, and the
knowledge gained was tremendous,'' says Mrs Burt.
Music, art, drama, sport, a lively school newspaper and magazine
produced by the pupils, charity fundraising, the Duke of Edinburgh Award
Scheme and a Young Enterprise company. Craigholme looks poised to march
toward its second century and into the third millenium with confidence.

Dodds double takes Aberdeen into the cup final
THE suffering returned and was spreading through Rangers' ranks like a
stifling malaise long before Hugh Dallas blew on his whistle for the
last time in last night's Coca-Cola Cup semi-final at a windswept and
saturated Hamdpen. As the Ibrox side's players tried in vain to catch up
with Aberdeen they looked only like 11 discarded blue wrappers being
scattered in the wind.
Rangers lacked composure, they were without flair, and for most of the
game seemed they seemed devoid even of the spirit which has become a
significant part of their success in recent times.
Aberdeen, on the other hand, took the first half to wind up and almost
from the first kick of the ball in the second half they were in control.
They were the only side who looked likely to score and their midfield,
with Eoin Jess superb and Stephen Glass not far behind, found gaps in
Rangers defences and Andy Goram was soon exposed.
Billy Dodds, the Pittodrie side's top scorer last season, did what he
does best and beat Goram twice in the second half. Although Rangers
presented a more serious if not exactly coherent threat towards the end
of the tie they had left it too late. Oleg Salenko's goal was sweetly
taken, but the Dons would not be denied.
Roy Aitken's team, whose cup record against Rangers in Glasgow gave
them no cause at all for hope, must have been buoyed tremendously when
they received their copy of the opposition's starting 11 just before
kick-off. They knew, of course, of Rangers' much publicised injuries,
but added to the list of wounded last night was Richard Gough.
Could it have been a mistake, a cruel prank perhaps? If there were any
doubts they were dispelled when the teams came together in the tunnel.
Standing at the head of the Rangers' line, where Gough would normally
be, was Ally McCoist.
It was, then, a thin blue line which emerged into a foul night when
the wind would test the new structures of the national stadium and the
tumbling rain the drainage system. In some places players walked in
water, but only one or two in red jerseys came close to walking on it.
Walter Smith turned to a grizzled Ibrox veteran, John Brown, who has
started out on a new career in coaching, and positioned him at the heart
of the three-man defensive system with Craig Moore and Gordan Petric on
either side, but even though the shape of the defence would be altered a
few times before the match had run its course, no-one ever looked
comfortable in his work.
Moore would be relieved in the second half when Ian Durrant was sent
on in the hope of introducing some touch and vision and Alan McLaren,
who was off the pace in midfield, dropped back. The Dons, though, were
racing towards glory and a cup final place which confirms their
rehabilitation from last season's nightmare.
They played with the belief which had deserted them last season and
after having struggled along with Rangers to come to terms with the
wretched conditions, they settled into a fluent style of play which
pulled their opponents apart. By the time Rangers' supporters who
accounted for the bulk of the 26,131 crowd, had started to shuffle
towards the exits the Scottish champions were a team well beaten.
Paul Gascoigne, who had tried hard in the first half, disappeared when
Aberdeen got down to serious work and instead of producing his subtle
skills the English internationalist allowed anger and frustration to
take over. He was one of three Rangers player -- Brown and Gordon Durie
were the two others -- booked while Paul Bernard was the only Aberdeen
player cautioned.
Rangers must begin immediately to find something positive in another
unacceptable performance.
Yet, Rangers could have gone ahead after only a matter of seconds when
Durie, playing forward on the left, slipped the ball to McCoist, but the
stand-in captain was caught off-balance and his shot flew just wide of
Michael Watt's left-hand post.
Durie had a couple of surges down the left, but he made little of the
opportunities and a scrappy first half was easily forgotten. Aberdeen
were a different side entirely when they returned after the break and
they moved ahead in 51 minutes.
Jess scampered through the midfield zone, perhaps covering 35 yards
without being closed down, and then played the ball through to Dodds. He
was pressured by Brown but the ball bounced off one of the defender's
knees and Dodds and Goram were engaged in pursuit. Dodds won and
squeezed his shot between the keeper's legs and into the net.
From then on Aberdeen played some neat football with Jess, Glass, and
Bernard, who is settling in well, knocking the ball around.
Occasionally, however, Michael Watt, who has bad memories of keeping
goal against Rangers, looked uncertain and caused a degree of panic
among his defenders, but when the Dons scored their second in 69 minutes
theycould relax.
Bernard took possession on the left and brought Glass into play
allowing the youngster to deliver a cross from the left to the far post
where Dodds was waiting unchallenged. He had difficulty tracking the
flightpath in the floodlights, but he still managed to make good contact
and his downward header was true.
Confidence and class oozed through Aberdeen's midfield work and their
defence was able to cope with most of Rangers' attacks although
McLaren's deflected shot late in the game caused concern. The ball
skidded narrowly wide of Watt's goal, but Rangers did score after Alexei
Mikhailichenko had taken over from Alex Cleland.
McCoist played a ball wide to Salenko and he directed his shot into
the net from an angle. It was a flash of quality play, but not enough to
thwart Aberdeen, who took off Joe Miller and sent on Peter Hetherston
six minutes from time.
RANGERS -- Goram, Wright, Brown, Moore, McLaren, Petric, Cleland,
Gascoigne, McCoist, Salenko, Durie. Substitutes -- Durrant,
Mikhailichenko, Murray.
ABERDEEN -- Watt, McKimmie, Glass, Grant, Inglis, Smith, Miller,
Bernard, Booth, Dodds, Jess. Substitutes -- Shearer, Hetherston,
Snelders.
Referee -- H Dallas (Motherwell).

JOHN McCaffer, a senior Scottish Rugby Union committee man, wants the
Five Nations' Championship to have an exclusive sponsor and the Calcutta
Cup turned into a registered trademark.
The retired college lecturer says that under present circumstances the
Scottish economy cannot support an across-the-board professional game.
However, he is looking to the major showcase of the Five Nations'
tournament and the new European championship as a means of enhancing
domestic revenues, which would allow a limited professional game in
Scotland.
''We should be looking at collective sponsorship, if we can call it
that,'' said McCaffer. ''The Five Nations' is the best rugby competition
in the world and it does not have a commercial sponsor.
''A company coming in and having its name associated with the
tournament does not need to affect existing Union or match sponsors.
However, the extra revenue generated would go towards funding a
professional game once the money finds its way back into the domestic
scene.''
He added: ''Similarly, once the European championship is up and
running it will have a major commercial sponsor and, presumably, the TV
rights will be sold. If Scottish representation is via, say, three
district sides, then that money could go to the districts and they would
pass on a portion to the clubs which have supplied the players, and to
the players themselves.
''There is talk of staging the Calcutta Cup match as a special annual
game outwith the Five Nations' Championship. That makes sense and the
first thing that should be done is to register the outline of the trophy
as a trademark, and I'm sure that revenue could be raised from that.''
McCaffer's comments come as the SRU is putting the finishing touches
to contracts which it hopes to issue to national-squad players in
advance of the Murrayfield international against Western Samoa on
November 18 and also when the game still seems to be at a loss as to how
professionalism will affect the district and club game in Scotland.
* CURRIE are the first winners of The Herald-Tennents club of the
month competition. The award, a trophy and keg of beer, was made last
night at the club's Malleny Park.
Currie, top of the Tennents Premiership Division 2, receive the award
for their efforts in September, when they were the only premiership side
to have maintained a 100% record.

BADMINTON
EDINBURGH'S Elinor Allen could be out of this weekend's Mansfield Open
after having been involved in a car crash. The Scottish mixed and
women's doubles champion, who has more than 100 caps to her credit, has
sustained whiplash which could end her hopes of competing in
Nottinghamshire.
The blow came as a double disappointment for the 28-year-old, who
already knew she would be denied the chance to retain her No.1 ranking
in the mixed doubles.
Her partner Kenny Middlemiss, whose work as an engineer has taken him
out to the Middle East this month, will not be able to fly back in time
as he had first hoped.
However, 16 other Scots will travel to Mansfield, including Scottish
singles champions Anne Gibson and Bruce Flockhart.

THEY have been pilloried by the establishment, they have no home,
their local politicians have done them no favours, and even their
supporters won't go in any significant numbers to visit them in their
Cumbernauld lodgings.
Airdrie remain the gypsies of Scottish football, the club everybody
would like to forget.
The trouble is Airdrie won't roll over. They keep showing up in cup
semi-finals and finals and, by their very presence in these matches,
they are proclaiming themselves to be alive and well despite their lack
of overall support.
Tonight, they travel to McDiarmid Park as they did a year ago this
very day to play in a Coca-Cola Cup semi-final. Then, they lost on
penalties to the eventual winners, Raith Rovers, and now they go in
against Dundee feeling confident this could be the year in which finally
they will embrace one of the major prizes.
Last November, Airdrie won the B and Q Cup when they beat Dundee 3-2
in the final at tonight's venue after extra time, but, because they have
been in two Scottish Cup finals and two semi-finals of the League Cup
since 1992, they believe they should have had something much more
prestigious to show for their work.
Their record in cup competitions under the guidance of Alex MacDonald
and in the face of adversity is remarkable and marks the former Rangers
player as a leader of men.
MacDonald, who worked wonders with ordinary players when manager of
Hearts, succeeded Jimmy Bone as the Baron of Broomfield in May '91 and
was able to keep Airdrie in the premier division, although relegation
caught up with them in season 1992-93.
They were affected badly in season 1991-92 when robbed of a place in
the then Skol Cup final by referee David Syme. Leading 1-0 in the final
minutes of the semi-final against Dunfermline at Tynecastle, Jimmy
Sandison chested the ball outside his box -- Yes he did, I was there --
and Syme, who will never be forgiven in Diamondsville, gave Dunfermline
a penalty.
They scored, the tie went to extra-time, and Airdrie lost on
penalties.
Grown men, rough diamonds of the terracings, still wake up screaming
in the dead of night. Counselling might help, but Airdrieonians don't do
that.
However, although jettisoned from the top division in 1992-93, that
same campaign ended at Hampden in the Scottish Cup final against
Rangers, and, although Airdrie lost 2-1, they were assured of a place in
the European Cup-winners' Cup.
They lost 1-0 at home and 2-1 away to Sparta Prague, but, under
MacDonald, Airdrie had their first experience of European football. It
was said their prominence was one of those quirks thrown up occasionally
in football. They would settle back into an anonymous existence. Oh,
really?
They lost 1-0 to Celtic in the quarter-finals -- Frank McAvennie
scored -- of Skol Cup the following season, but, still, Airdrie would
not be put down.
In season 1994-95, they reached the semi-finals of the Coca-Cola Cup,
and also the final of the Tennents Scottish Cup against Celtic.
Again, though, they lost 1-0 and tonight they are back on the
threshold of another cup final. This time they are favourites because
their opponents, Dundee, have not been in a major cup final since 1981
when they lost 3-0 to city rivals United in the League Cup.
Also, Dundee were instrumental in denying MacDonald his greatest
moment as a manager when, in season 1985-86 they beat Hearts on the
final day of the league campaign and the premier-division championship
was lost.
A couple of weeks later MacDonald's broken Hearts lost 3-0 to Aberdeen
in the Scottish Cup final and a man who had been looking at what would
have been an astonishing double received nothing.
MacDonald and Airdrie, who are a reflection of one another in that
they are dogged and don't stand for anybody's manure, are due something
from this game. They are a manager and club who are better than people
think although a trophy would help prove that.
The manager, for instance, is not merely someone who can motivate and
tease out more than largely ordinary players are entitled to give.
MacDonald is tactically astute also and he deals well in the bargain
basement of the transfer market bringing to Hearts players like Neil
Berry (Bolton Wanderers), Wayne Foster (Preston), and Mike Galloway
(Halifax.)
While with Airdrie, he has worked other deals. Gus Caesar, Chris
Honor, and Jim McIntyre have all been signed from Bristol City, Steve
Cooper from York City, and Peter Duffield was bought from Hamilton.
''We seem to rise to the occasions,'' MacDonald said. ''Dundee have a
lot big players who might put us under pressure, but I am hoping it will
be third time lucky for us. I hope it doesn't go to penalties because I
don't have enough hair left to go grey.''
MacDonald can't resist levity, but it might be his need to make light
of most situations which helps keep covered the reality of the man. He
is a resilient little man with a wealth of knowledge which could be used
to great effect with a larger, more resourceful club and perhaps if
Airdrie win tonight someone will make a move for him.
The thought of losing him might make it worth the pain of defeat by
Dundee, but then again both MacDonald and Airdrie deserve to win. They
are both worthy of the glory and whatever opportunities might present
themselves as a consequence.
Only a curmudgeon, or a Dundee fan -- same thing, really -- would
grudge MacDonald his moment, don't you think?

THE gloves came off yesterday in a legal scrap between Lennox Lewis
and World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Frank Bruno.
Lewis' solicitor, Bernard Clarke, has issued a High Court writ against
Bruno -- which was attached to the gate of his Essex mansion -- and the
Mexico City based, WBC.
Lewis' move is simple -- to prevent Bruno from defending the title
against Mike Tyson before Lewis. And the injunction also is to prevent
any U-turn by the WBC at their annual convention in Thailand starting
early next month.
This situation has been on the go since Lewis cleared his last hurdle
by stopping Tommy Morrison. Once Lewis had achieved that victory, his
promoter, Panos Eliades, made contact with WBC president Jose Sulaiman,
urging that Bruno-Lewis be put out for purse offers. So far, Eliades has
received no satisfaction from the WBC, hence the latest move.
The problem stems from the WBC's decision to order Lewis to meet
Lionel Butler in a final eliminator to challenge for his former title
but, in the meantime, Tyson came out of prison and was elevated to No.1
contender ahead of schedule.
There will doubtless be arguments that Tyson has a prior right to meet
Bruno first.
The writ served against Bruno was preceded by a letter and it was not
presented personally because it is believed, Bruno is out of the
country.
By defeating Oliver McCall, Bruno automatically took over the
mandatory commitments as a champion, which commenced on September 24.
Lewis, who will attend the WBC convention with manager Frank Maloney,
said: ''I will fight for my rights in Thailand. This is part of the
sport, but its bad that we have to resort to these things. Why can't we
fight who we are supposed to fight, why is everybody ducking?
''Bruno remembers the 17 unanswered punches of our first fight. He
doesn't want to go through that again. I'll box anybody. I definitely
want to fight Riddick Bowe at some stage, but I want Bruno first.
''I was happy he won the belt. He's kept it warm, but I'm coming for
it and he's hanging on to it even tighter.''

AN emotional Tommy Gilmour yesterday broke his silence over the tragic
events when Jim Murray, of Newmains, died after a challenge for the
British bantamweight championship against Condorrat's Drew Docherty at
Glasgow's Hospitality Inn on October 13.
The nation, and a huge television audience, was stunned by the death
of a brave young fighter and horrified by the scenes after the fight in
which fans went on the rampage throwing bottles and chairs. Since then,
Gilmour, who manages Docherty, has been silent over the whole affair.
Yesterday, however, as Docherty, his faincee Caroline and their baby
daughter, Rachel, left the country for a short holiday, Gilmour said:
''I'm sorry I have been unavailable to the media over the past 10 days,
but it has been a traumatic time for all of us. I did what I did,
believing it was the best way to protect my boxer and the best way to
protect the dignity of the Murray family, to whom we extend our
heartfelt sympathy.''
The manager and promoter, who on Monday night staged the first boxing
show in Glasgow since the tragedy, has not tried to influence Docherty's
thinking about the future.
''I haven't broached the subject of him fighting again,'' he said.
''Drew is a very quiet person, and it is important he is allowed time to
come to terms with the grief. He has been in the glare since the fight,
and maybe he can come to terms with things in a more relaxed atmosphere.
That is why we are pleased he has gone away for a break.''
Gilmour, however, insists that when Docherty returns, he will sit down
with him and talk everything over. ''I don't know if Drew will fight
again,'' he said. ''But we must talk about it and maybe he will need
counselling. Certain things have to be clarified. But the final decision
will be down to Drew, and whatever he decides he will have my full
support.''
The manager revealed that none of his other boxers -- he regards them
all as part of a big family -- has expressed doubts about carrying on.
If Docherty does carry on with his fighting career, his next big
contest will be for the European title. He was lined up to challenge
England's Johnny Armour, but that has been put on hold while Armour
makes a voluntary defence of the championship.
Said Gilmour: ''It has been wrongly reported that Drew has lost his
chance of a European title fight. He is still the official No.1
challenger and the European Boxing Union have given us until December 11
to let them know our intentions. That gives Drew plenty of time to give
proper thought to the whole situation. He will not be rushed, and when
he comes back from his break he will speak for himself.''
When Docherty does return, he will make a visit to Newmains to meet
the dead boxer's parents, Kenny and Margaret. Drew and his whole family
attended the funeral in Newmains last Thursday to pay their respects,
but he will wish to have a private talk with the Murrays.
''I have spoken to Mr and Mrs Murray and Drew will want to visit
them.'' said Gilmour. ''These people have been wonderful. They have said
Drew will be welcome in their house at any time. This terrible thing has
happened to them, yet they are worrying about what is going to happen to
Drew.''
Gilmour also spoke emotionally about the fans who rioted as Jim Murray
lay fighting for his life. ''It hurt me,'' he said. ''Glasgow is a great
city and much good has been done in recent years by sport and the arts
to project its image.
''We are proud of what we in boxing have done, bringing big names and
world title fights to the city. An isolated incident involving thugs and
yobs should not be allowed to tarnish that image.''
Neither has Gilmour any time for those who would see the sport banned.
''Boxing is my job -- it's my life,'' he said. ''The sport has never
shied away from making it as safe as can be, and we are constantly
talking to medical people. Anything that is put forward for the benefit
of the sport should be adopted. Boxing will go on.''
How the boxers themselves feel about it was perfectly summed up by
world light-flyweight champion Paul Weir, from Irvine, who defends the
title against Baby Jake Matlala at the Kelvin Hall next month.
Gilmour had told him that if he won the Lottery he would pay off all
his boxers' mortgages. ''That's good,'' said Weir. ''But I'm a boxer and
I would continue to box.''
* RICHIE Woodhall puts his world championship ambitions on the line in
front of home town fans at Telford Ice Rink. He is official challenger
for the WBC and WBO middleweight titles, and manager Mickey Duff hopes
to be able to set up something for the New Year.
So Woodhall cannot afford any slip-up in a first defence of the
European crown against German-based Zdrakvo Kostic.
' Drew is a very quiet person, and it is important he is allowed time
to come to terms with the grief. '

Cup final place up for grabs at McDiarmid Park
IT has been more than 20 years since Dundee last won a major trophy,
more than 30 since they reached the semi-finals of the European Cup, and
how their fortunes have plummeted in the years which have gone between.
Now, however, the Dens Park team are desperately close to playing in
Europe again and emulating the exploits of Raith Rovers which have
helped brighten this season.
Not that manager Jim Duffy is ready to talk of Europe, or even of the
Coca-Cola Cup final itself for that matter.
Instead, he worries over the effect nerves may play on the men he
sends out against Airdrie in tonight's semi-final at McDiarmid Park.
He will, however, talk about the effect a win may have on the fortunes
of the club which has slumped so dramatically over the past two decades.
That, though, is not a matter he wants his players to consider
tonight.
Indeed, he will tell them not to look at the worries which surround
the club and which have been so much a part of the scene since Duffy
returned to join the backroom staff and try to help set up a rescue
package.
Yesterday, as he prepared his side for their most important match of
the season, he made it plain that the players had to think about just
one thing -- and that was success of the field against Airdrie.
''I will be sitting in the stand with the directors and it's our job
to think about the future of the club and what a cup final will mean to
us,'' he said. ''I don't want any of the lads to think about that. All
they need to do is think about the prestige they can gain from taking
part in a major final.
''I just want them to concentrate on getting a win. There is no
denying that we have had serious problems, financial problems, at the
club. But that should not be the concern of the players.
''Already, the run to the last four has earned us good money -- to go
that stage further would be a huge financial lift.
''It would bring us prestige -- which could allow us to attract new
players here. And it would bring us hard cash -- and that would allow us
to spend money on such players.
''Yes, all of that is important but it will only come to pass if we
can beat Airdrie and no-one here is going to under-estimate them in a
cup situation.''
That, of course, remains the main worry for Duffy. Almost all of
Airdrie's players have experience of big cup games while, in his squad,
only Ray Farningham has reached these heights before.
Semi-finals are notorious for nerves, for players suddenly freezing in
a situation when the pressure gets to them, for mistakes which can
suddenly wreck the dreams of clubs, players, and supporters in one
moment of madness.
Duffy recognises these problems and his hope remains that his players
will perform at their best.
''We have beaten Kilmarnock and Hearts on our way to this game,'' he
pointed out. ''If we can perform as we did in these two matches then we
will be capable of beating Airdrie.
''We have the players who can take us to the final and young Neil
McCann is one of them. If he strikes form then he can cause them
problems. I understand that Alex MacDonald has already indicated that he
sees Neil as a worry. I hope he is right.''
The one problem Dundee will not have to suffer is the weight of
history, even though they have won this tournament three times already.
Few of their players will recall that last success, when they defeated
Celtic 1-0 in 1973, and McCann was not even born when the club took the
trophy back to Tayside.
Yesterday McCann admitted: ''Any success here at this club was way
before I was born.
''The fans have had to suffer for a long, long time while Dundee
United have found success at home and played in Europe.
''Now we have a chance to change things and give our fans something to
celebrate.
''We have seen what Raith Rovers have achieved.
''Playing against the likes of Bayern Munich is not just a dream for
clubs like ourselves any more. Raith have brought these games within
reach.''
Dundee still have an injury worry over Neil Duffy but Danish
internationalist Morten Wieghorst looks sure to play as does striker
Gerry Britton.
The will be backed by the bulk of the support at Perth with more than
6000 tickets being sold by the Dens Park club while Airdrie could only
sell 2000.

RICHARD Illingworth took his chance yesterday to show England's fast
bowlers that they may not have it all their own way this winter.
It was thought by some that Illingworth and spin partner Mike
Watkinson are only making up the numbers in South Africa, but chairman
of selectors Ray Illingworth does not agree -- and his unrelated
namesake provided evidence in support of him in Randjesfontein.
The left-arm bowler took five for 48 during England's 112-run victory
over Oppenheimer's XI, a match which may have been fairly meaningless
but certainly boosted Illingworth's confidence.
''You know my view on playing spinners,'' said the chairman. ''We hope
the pitches will allow us to use them this winter.''
England's first Test tour of South Africa for 30 years could hardly
have begun at a more idyllic spot. Nicky Oppenheimer pays around #20,000
a year for the right to bring international teams to his estate near
Johannesburg. For a multi-millionaire who runs the family diamond
business that, of course, is just small change.
Oppenheimer's son, Jonathan, contributed with an unbeaten 21 to his
team's 130 all out -- but England's batsmen were called on to face two
or three useful bowlers.
The pick was Steve Elworthy, who will be the overseas recruit at Old
Trafford next season. He and seamer Henry Williams made Mike Atherton
and Alec Stewart work for their runs and both openers were dropped
twice.
Stewart, playing in his first match for three months following injury,
struggled at times. However, he still picked up 11 boundaries before
retiring on 74 to give other batsmen a chance.
Mark Ramprakash (48) and Jack Russell (35 no) grasped the opportunity,
while John Crawley (14) and Robin Smith (12) did not.
England's total of 242 for five declared proved too much for the
hosts, as Illingworth struck three times in nine deliveries early in
their innings.
''Richard's action has got a lot better,'' said chairman Illingworth.
''He's putting more spin on the ball than at any time in his career.''
The chairman puts that down to a chat he had with the Worcestershire
player a couple of years ago. ''This performance should give him plenty
of confidence.''

Bangkok
A BRITISH doctor who sat up a practice in Cambodia was sentenced to
two years' jail yesterday for sexual assault on Khmer children.
Dr Gavin Scott, 39, who administered to the resident ex-patriate
community and a local international school, was found guilty of five
rape charges after a one-day hearing.
He was also ordered to pay the equivalent of #250 to five victims, all
boys under 15.
The conviction of Dr Scott, who worked in Burma before moving to
Cambodia in 1991, was hailed by human rights groups as a triumph for
Cambodia's determination to support the UN declaration on the rights of
the child.
He is the first foreigner to be jailed for partaking in Phnom Penh's
flourishing child sex trade.
0 Dr Scott has been in custody for five months and 18 months of the
prison sentence has been suspended, so he has only one more month to
serve.

LAST weekend's Lochgelly Open was postponed due to lack of interest,
but an over-subscribed entry for the inaugural David Lloyd Open which
takes place at Renfrew from Friday to Sunday proves that Scottish squash
is in a healthy state.
Organised by Derek Ritchie, the former internationalist and host club
professional, there are three graded men's events, and two for women.
''We're running it on a format that everyone is guaranteed at least
four matches, and it will be played out to decide places one to 16,''
said Ritchie.
''I've been delighted with the response to this initial venture, and
already there is every intention of increasing it to an even bigger and
better event next year.''

MANCHESTER United have resisted a further approach from Inter-Milan to
tempt Eric Cantona to Italy -- even in a swop deal for former Old
Trafford favourite Paul Ince.
It has been reported that Inter officials, who failed to land the
Frenchman during the close season, were preparing a #7m offer when the
Italian transfer market reopens for a week on November 2.
Inter also have suggested an exchange deal with former England
midfielder Ince -- who left United last summer and has struggled to make
an impact since his #7m move.
But United chairman Martin Edwards insisted: ''Eric is not for sale at
any price it is as simple as that.''
Newly-installed Inter coach Roy Hodgson is quoted as saying: ''We want
Cantona and it's now up to the chairman to get Manchester United to part
with him.''
* BLACKBURN survived a potential Coca-Cola Cup giant-killing at
Watford last night, while Bury were robbed of a third-round shock
against Reading after rain washed out the Elm Park clash.
English champions Blackburn were a goal down but booked their place in
the fourth round when Alan Shearer and Mike Newell claimed second-half
goals after Kevin Phillips put the home side ahead.
The referee abandoned the tie between Reading and third-division Bury
after just 28 minutes, with Bury leading their Division 1 opponents 2-0.
The official defended his decision, claiming: ''The conditions were
farcical. It was becoming a lottery and some of the touchlines were
being completely washed away.''
0 Arsenal killed off any hopes of a shock home victory with two
first-half goals before going on to seal a 3-0 win at Barnsley. Dennis
Bergkamp was the architect of their triumph, firing in a fierce
free-kick which Barnsley keeper Dave Watson failed to hold and Steve
Bould netted.
Bergkamp scored his sixth goal of the season before Martin Keown
sealed Arsenal's victory, while Birmingham and Tranmere drew 1-1 at St
Andrews.
Bolton, last year's losing finalists, and Leicester also face a replay
after a 0-0 stalemate at Burnden Park.

STEFAN Edberg became only the fourth player to clock up 1000 top-class
matches as he beat Italian Renzo Furlan 6-3, 6-1 to reach the second
round of the #1.2m Essen Open in Germany. The former Wimbledon champion
joined Ivan Lendl, Jimmy Connors, and John McEnroe as the only others to
have reached that milestone.
For the Swede, who turns 30 in January, the achievement was more than
just a statistic. ''It's a milestone. As you get older, these things get
more important. It will mean a lot in 15 to 20 years from now,'' said
the Swede who has now slipped to No.23 in the rankings.
He has no plans to retire yet, but the London-based player has a long
way to go to catch Lendl, who tops the list with 1310 matches ahead of
Connors (1180) and McEnroe (1033).
Edberg's 1001st match is against world No.2 Pete Sampras in today's
second round of the top-class Essen event, which has attracted all of
the world's leading stars.
Boris Becker returned to action after injury with a typically stubborn
performance, the three-times Wimbledon champion opening his account at
the tournament with a 7-6, 6-4 second-round triumph over Swede Magnus
Gustafsson.
Russian sixth seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the only other seed in action
yesterday, also had to battle for a 6-4, 2-6, 6-1 victory over
compatriot Alexander Volkov.

COLIN McRae is on course to become Britain's first-ever world rally
champion after climbing to second place after the second day of the
Catalunya Rally.
The Scot's main rival for the title, Juha Kankkunen, held a convincing
lead in the race having won eight of the first 15 stages, but he came to
grief on the sixteenth special stage and McRae can now pip him for the
ultimate prize at the Network Q RAC Rally -- the final race of the
series -- in Britain next month.
In recent years, McRae and his co-driver Derek Ringer have made the
RAC Rally their own. ''It's a superb opportunity for me,'' said McRae,
who is just eight seconds behind race leader Carlos Sainz.
''Providing nothing goes wrong for me tomorrow the only thing that
will stand between me and the world championship will be my favourite
event -- in front of my home crowd. I can't wait.''
If the positions remain unchanged today, McRae and his Subaru
team-mate Sainz will lead the world championship on 70 points. Kankkunen
has 62.
Today's final six stages finish in Lloret de Mar. Leading positions 17
special stages:
1, C Sainz (Spain) Subaru Impreza 3hr 43min 56sec; 2, C McRae
(Britain) Subaru Impreza at 8sec; 3, D Auriol (France) Toyota Celica 52;

COOK Islands defeated Ireland 22-6 last night to lift the inaugural
emerging nations World Cup before a crowd of 4147 at Bury.
Ireland led after just 10 minutes when winger Phelim Comerford crossed
in a corner after the Cook Islands failed to clear a high kick from
Martin Crompton.
Oldham scrum-half Crompton was a key figure for Ireland, who settled
quickly and adapted to the poor conditions with more ease than their
opponents.
But when the heavy rain subsided midway through the first half, the
islanders stepped up a gear to take control, with scrum-half Ali Davys
impressive.
Davys, a target for Leigh, created a fine try for second-row forward
Alec Kermode after 25 minutes to level the scores.
Winger Sonny Shepherd, also wanted by Leigh, was next on the score
sheet when he touched down five minutes from time to give the Cook
Islands a 10-4 half-time advantage.
Ireland reduced the deficit in 51 minutes with a penalty before Meti
Noovao made it 12-6 with the second of his three goals.
Ireland battled throughout and remained in contention until the
closing minutes when the Cook Islands grabbed two late tries to seal
victory. Stand-off Craig Bowen kicked ahead and won the race to
touchdown before hooker James Cuthers crossed in the dying seconds.

JOHN Higgins is not going to relinquish the Skoda Grand Prix title
without a fight judging by his last-frame success against French
Canadian Alain Robidoux in Sunderland last night.
Just when the Scot's crown was wobbling, he produced a fine break of
73 to scrape home 5-4 after two hours 40 minutes. Higgins, who now meets
Jimmy White tonight for a place in the semi-finals, even threatened to
finish with a maximum 147 break.
However, after having moved 10 reds and nine blacks, he missed the
tenth black and admitted: ''I twitched badly. But at that point I was
just relieved to have got the match practically won. I can hardly think
straight after that match.
''At 4-1 up, I was not really thinking about the game. I was being a
bit disrespectful because my mind was on playing Jimmy. I knew Alain was
a great battler and he proved it with that display.''
Higgins, who has now won 10 Grand Prix matches in succession following
the seven victories that took him to last year's title, started well,
with breaks of 101, 72, and 56 to lead 4-1. He then stumbled but came
back well for success.
Earlier, White had drawn the biggest crowd of the week to Sunderland's
Crowtree Centre for his 5-0 success against Ulsterman Jason Prince.
White finished off in the best possible fashion with a break of 105.

Canadian-born Morris, who holds a British passport, missed out on
Britain's last Olympic qualifying bid by a month, and is one of only two
Scottish-based players in the national squad, the other being his club
captain at Fife Flyers, Iain Robertson.
Morris said: ''My passport did not come through in time for the last

I'm desperate to help Britain make the Olympics.''
Holland, Denmark, Slovenia, and Switzerland stand in Britain's way and
Morris, who has played for Britain in two world championships, said:
''We didn't do too well in the last qualifying tournament but our
goaltending and defence has a more solid look and we've some experienced
forwards who know the way to goal.''
Morris gave British coach Peter Woods a timely reminder of his ability
by notching a double in Flyers' 9-3 victory of Woods' club side,
Basingstoke Bison, at the weekend

FINTRY may seem an unlikely stop in the world of bowls but that is
where eight of Scotland's top players will find themselves on Sunday as
they bid to win a place in February's #130,000 World Indoor Championship
which takes place at Preston.
In the initial qualifying round at the West of Scotland stadium
earlier this month, a field of 20 was reduced to the eight who will
battle it out for the single Scottish qualifying place on offer.
Three players went through with unbeaten records from the
opening-round section matches -- East Lothian's Ian Bell, Willie
Galloway from Edinburgh, and Blantyre's Jim McCann.
McCann, the beaten finalist in 1993 is seeking to re-establish himself
in the top flight after a first-round defeat against Ireland's Neil
Booth in 1994 caused him to slip out of the world indoor limelight.
He is paired in the same section as Bell, Auchinleck's Steve Rankin
and Robert McCulloch, from Prestwick.
In the other section, Galloway is joined by Cumbernauld pair David
Miller and Ian Thomson and Prestwick's Cliff Eade.

ENGLAND captain Shaun Edwards will definitely miss Saturday's World
Cup final against champions Australia at Wembley.
The Wigan scrum-half, whose has been restricted to just one appearance
in the competition because of a knee infection, yesterday ruled himself
out of the final after having suffered a recurrence of the problem.
It means that there is no doubt that St Helens player Bobbie Goulding,
man of the match in Saturday's 25-10 semi-final defeat of Wales at Old
Trafford, will start at No.7 for the showdown with the Aussies.
Another blow for England is that Keighley stand-off Daryl Powell, who
missed the semi-final with a calf strain, is also out of Saturday's
clash.
And another likely absentee is Halifax winger Jon Bentley, who has not
played since picking up a hamstring problem in England's final group
game against South Africa 10 days ago.
But Wigan pair Jason Robinson (foot injury) and Andy Farrell (groin)
are expected to be fit.
And there could yet be a dramatic return for Wigan utility back Gary
Connolly, who has not played any part in the tournament so far because
he has been suffering from pneumonia.
Connolly has been training with the England squad and is still in
contention for a place in the 17.
England coach Phil Larder, speaking about Edwards, said: ''I feel very
sorry for Shaun.
''I know how hard he has prepared for this competition and he has been
a tremendous help to me in the build-up.''
Widnes whistler Stuart Cummings will referee Saturday's final.
The PE teacher will be returning to Wembley for the second time in
three weeks, having taken charge of the World Cup opener between the
same two countries -- which England won 20-16.
A delighted Cummings said after the appointment was made yesterday:
''It's the pinnacle of my career and I am very honoured to have been
chosen.
''I really enjoyed refereeing the first match between England and
Australia and I am sure that the final will be even better.
''I am looking forward to a tremendous match and hoping that it will
be a game that the whole of rugby league will be proud of. Now I am
going to spend the next few days concentrating on my preparations for
the final.''

IF EVER rugby league wants to prove that it has shorn its mercenary
image, the ruthless side shown in the Richard Harris film This Sporting
Life, then it will never have a better moment than right now. Let
Jonathan Davies go.
He is 33 years of age and he announced on Saturday that the World Cup
semi-final against England would be his last league international.
To the final whistle in that match he gave his all, credited with no
fewer than 17 tackles against men stones heavier than himself.
The Welshman has been a class act in either code, value for cash or
kind, an inspiration to all around him.
Davies wants to return to union, to play again for Cardiff and maybe
even his beloved Welsh XV for a little while more.
But there is a bill to settle.
Warrington, his current rugby league club, want #200,000 compensation
for releasing him from a two-year contract.
Cardiff don't appear to have the money to meet such a bill, the Welsh
Rugby Union are in no hurry to set a precedent.
If they had to choose -- and pay for -- one player to return from
rugby league it would probably be the younger Scott Quinnell.
I think they are wrong about that but am more concerned about Davies;
it will be a national disgrace if he is forced to retire.
Why does Jonathan want to go back to his old ways? Not because he says
union is the superior game, although it is, but because: ''South Wales
is where my home is. My kids are growing up fast. My wife wants to be
closer to her parents and grandparents.''
I am not one who believes a Davies return is guaranteed to revive the
Welsh international team. It is arguable that even he would be able to
do that.
He will find the field littered with even more defenders than when he
left the game. Many of them will want to make their name by nailing him.
But I think it would be a magnificent sporting gesture by Warrington
if they were to shake hands and wish him well. In any case, if he
retires, what will their investment be worth then?
Failing that, I hope there is a least one well-off Welsh person
prepared to put hand in pocket or purse -- Sir Harry Secombe, Max Boyce,
Shirley Bassey -- and buy back one of the country's most noble
institutions. After all, there must be a song in there for one or all of
them.
Talking of great fly-halves -- and we were -- I find myself in
considerable sympathy with Rob Andrew, handed the black spot by Wasps
and told to bob off to his new, highly-paid job at Newcastle. No, don't
bother finishing the training session, just beat it.
Rather odd way to treat a magnificent club servant, is it not? Andrew
was approached, and accepted, an offer from Sir John Hall's emissaries,
to manage and play for the Newcastle Gosforth club. Sir John himself
fully intends that his acquired club will be every bit as successful as
his other sporting interest, Newcastle United, and only a fool would
doubt his dream.
Because of the 120-day rule operating in English rugby, Andrew could
not move immediately. He offered to continue at Wasps; considering his
value as a goal-kicker and tactician that was a generous decision.
Rob could, after all, have just deserted his own club immediately.
Wasps first welcomed his staying then, after other players at the club
anounced that they, too, would be going to Newcastle, they showed him
the door.
''They have a bloody cheek,'' boomed Sir John, ''considering southern
clubs have been pinching the best Newcastle players for years.''
Maybe it was stupid for Andrew to think that he could serve two
masters, even for a short period. But he is a decent bloke as anyone who
knows him will tell you and he wanted to give Wasps what he had left.
If the London club did not like that they should have said so from the
start. To suggest that Andrew was not allowed to recruit was ludicrous.
What was he supposed to say when asked if there was a place for such
as Dean Ryan and Nick Popplewell at his new abode?
Those who welcomed the arrival of professional rugby with such open
arms should perhaps have counted their fingers after shaking hands on
the deal. This is the real world, folks.
Andrew should not be blamed for working the system which the
authorities put in place.
I looked for the Wasps result on Saturday night and noted that they
had been beaten by Leicester.
Sometimes sport dishes out its own justice.

CHARLIE Mann, who landed the recent Velka Pardubicka on Its A Snip,
can taste victory round Cheltenham's rather more familiar terrain when
he saddles Multy for the juvenile hurdle this afternoon.
The three-year-old is related to several winners on the Flat and
proved a useful middle-distance stayer when trained in Ireland by Kevin
Prendergast, winning handicaps at Bellewstown and Down Royal.
He made a winning debut over hurdles for the Irish trainer, being
hampered when challenging at the last but still having enough pace to
beat Wanstead by five and a half lengths at Roscommon.
Blinkered for his starts since crossing the Irish Sea, he began with a
creditable second to Elation at Perth, and last time out went to
Kempton, where he ran a fine race in defeat when again second, this time
to Roland O'Sullivan's Volunteer.
Attempting to make most of the running, Multy was unable to quicken
when headed at the last and was a length down at the line, but still six
to the good over the Philip Hobbs-trained favourite Amlah.
There is still improvement to come from this three-year-old, who is
likely to be suited by Cheltenham's stiffer course.
Lady Peta can get his hurdling career off to a winning start in the
opener. He created a most favourable impression on his racecourse debut
in May when winning a bumper at Hereford by 10 lengths and can go in
again.

Ross Finlay finds a smooth performer.
WHILE the Golf is the sportier or runabout hatchback version of
Volkswagen's mid-range car, it is certainly not the workhorse or
load-carrier. That is the function of the Vento, which is its booted,
four-door saloon equivalent.
The Golf/Vento has served VW well, in its range of models from unblown
diesel to rip-snorting VR6, and in its sales success in all the
company's major markets, although the Golf is by far the stronger
seller. If you add together Golf and Vento production figures on four
continents, they hugely outnumber those of any other model in the whole
Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda and Seat group.
As a diesel, the Vento comes with either a 1.6-litre engine pushing
out a fairly feeble 64bhp, the Umwelt (or 'environment') diesel able to
reach a healthier 75bhp, or a rousing 90bhp TDI unit which peaks at a
much more substantial 90bhp.
Trim and equipment levels for the diesel models are L, CL and GL, and
the prices range from #11,634 to #14,960. In the catalogue you can find
petrol equivalents of these diesel versions at exactly the same price,
although the non-engine specifications are not always identical.
I have been driving a Vento CL fitted with the turbo diesel TDI
engine. This car costs #13,514, is well engineered and solidly built, is
not lavishly equipped for the price, and shows the strengths and
weaknesses of turbo diesel saloons very clearly.
With what seems like slightly less rear passenger space than in its
hatchback relative, the Vento comes with a massive luggage boot, which
is, of course, one of its attractions, if you need that facility,
compared with the stubbier Golf.
The front cabin scores well for space, and all the controls have a
solid feel. Volkswagen seems to use a remarkably dark pigment in all the
dark trim and upholstery material it favours, and I thought the Vento
was really the blackest of the black in interior appearance. Some let-up
in the gloom would be welcome.
Out on the road, on a long run south, the Vento TDI showed itself to
be a fine motorway car. Engine noise levels are quite high in some
situations, and there is no doubt at all that there is an oil-burner
under the bonnet. Even with direct injection, the turbo diesel cannot
match the petrol car for refinement.
On the other hand, it has a very strong performance. The TDI engine
pulls remarkably well, and when the turbo wafts in unobtrusively -- as
far as any extra noise is concerned -- the car slingshots forward.
As with all turbo diesels, the off-the-line acceleration is only a
small part of the story, although 0-60mph in under 13 seconds is good
going for a 1.9-litre of this type. The real urge comes in mid-range
acceleration, where the Vento will hold its own with most other traffic,
and power on really well on hills.
If it scores high marks on main roads and motorways, the TDI is by no
means as much at home on minor roads with bends over dips and brows. It
feels nose heavy when pressed on in these conditions, and loses much of
its handling composure. Of course, if you wanted a mid-range Volkswagen
which romped along in that kind of terrain, you would hardly go for a
Vento diesel.
The Vento TDI plays its ultimate trump card in taking the fuel economy
trick. Its direct injection 90bhp engine is the most fuel efficient in
the Volkswagen range, and is equipped with a remarkably sensitive
computerised management system.
The fuel consumption returns are impressive in comparison with
anything else in the class. Giving the old-style figures, the Vento TDI
will manage something like 72mpg at 56mph, 51 at 75 and 47mpg on the
urban cycle. Match those with the rolling acceleration, and you find a
car which may not handle like a sporting saloon, but offers an
impressive mix of performance and range.

BRITAIN will be a champion in opening up trade with Russia and Eastern
Europe, the Foreign Secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, said yesterday.
Market access was these countries' greatest need, and it was in
Europe's gift and in Europe's interest to provide it through what he
called ''the Marshall Plan for the 1990s''.
''We will work to draw Russia, Ukraine, and others into international
bodies like the World Trade Orginaisation,'' Mr Rifkind told the London
Chamber of Commerce. ''We will oppose anti-dumping measures that are in
reality merely a camouflage for protectionism. Working through the
European Union, Britain has already charted the way towards a new
relationship.''
Preparations for talks on free trade with Russia and the Ukraine, to
be held in 1998, should begin as soon as possible, he said, pledging
that Britain would use its influence in Europe, and more widely, to
assist the liberalising forces in the old Soviet Union.
''As their manufacturing changes from armaments and heavy industry to
the needs of the consumer, they need to know that they will be able to
compete on the basis of quality and price without the EU constructing
protectionist walls against them,'' he added.
''Russia and Ukraine must make the shift to full market economies
which will allow them to achieve this competitively and we are keen to
help this transformation.''
Mr Rifkind said that trade and prosperity between nations did not
guarantee peace, but it made it a great deal more likely. A Russia with
a comparable interest to that of the West in stability and economic
growth would be a good neighbour and a firm friend.

Washington
THE United States will default on its debts on November 7, according
to the secretary of the treasury, unless Congress raises the debt
ceiling.
The Republicans have agreed to do so, as a short-term measure, but
then threaten to allow the country to declare bankruptcy if President
Clinton does not accept the budget they will complete this week.
Mr Clinton has promised to veto the Bill. It includes savage cuts in
health care programmes for the elderly and the indigent, a complete
reform of welfare (which amounts to substantial cuts in every welfare
programme), and a whole host of other reforms.
The Bill also proposes to cut taxes, particularly for the rich, to
raise taxes on the poor, and to balance the budget by 2002. Mr Clinton
favours balancing the budget and cutting taxes, but insists that the
Republican plan is much too harsh.
The final Republican weapon is to refuse to raise the debt ceiling.
Treasury secretary Robert Rubin said today that the government will run
out of money on November 7. He and Alan Greenspan, director of the
Federal Reserve Board, along with a host of other bankers and officials,
have warned Congress that for the US Government to default on its
obligations might precipitate a world-wide financial crisis.
No doubt there is some possibility for compromise between president
and Congress on the timing of the balanced budget, the level of tax
cuts, and the detail of the spending cuts. All the same, it is entirely
possible that one side or the other, or both, will stake out a position
which will make an agreement impossible.
The Republicans do not have enough votes to overturn the president's
veto, so he can stop their budget in its tracks. The government would
then have to be continued on the same funding basis as last year.
However the government will be unable to borrow any more money to
finance its continuing deficit, and to pay interest on the national
debt, unless Congress authorises it. Mr Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the
House, has threatened to refuse to do so. It is just possible that he
means it.

Bogota
A COLOMBIAN boy who, at the age of seven, underwent a sex change
operation without his consent has won the right to be identified as a
male.
Legal sources identified the boy as a 14-year-old who had the sex
change and was treated with female hormones at the request of his
parents in April 1987, six-and-a-half years after a dog destroyed his
genitals.
He rebelled against the idea of being changed into a woman, however,
and filed a suit last year demanding that he be entitled to choose his
own sexual identity and rid himself of the girl's name his parents gave
him.
The Constitutional Court ruled in the boy's favour yesterday and
ordered that the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare assist him in any
way possible to overcome his emasculation and identity crisis.
The court ruling refers to the boy as suffering from ''a very
dangerous and very high dose of resentment''.
There was no immediate word on whether doctors would seek to reverse
the effects of the hormone treatment the boy received or close the
artificial vagina surgeons created for him.
It also was not clear if the boy would seek legal action against his
parents, who left him in a crib with the dog that emasculated him while
they both left home for work, or against the doctors who performed the
sex change operation.
''They operated on me when I was very young, they gave me a vagina
supposedly to make me into a woman,'' the boy told El Tiempo newspaper,
''but when you're older you can think more and decide for yourself . . .
I decided to be a man because that's how I was born.''
In its ruling the court said the boy ''has a man's voice, he dresses
and acts as such, he dreams of having a girlfriend, a wife, and a home,
and wants to become a teacher''.--Reuter.

NINA NOONE looks at the new #100,000 computer centre at Craigholme
School putting it at the forefront of technology.
TOMORROW Craigholme School in Glasgow, the largest girls' school in
the West of Scotland, celebrates its centenay with the official opening
of a #100,000 computer centre with 42 networked state-of-the-art
computers added to 50 existing free standing machines. It is the
culmination of a year of vigorous and successful fundraising.
The opening ceremony will be performed by Dr Myfanwy (Muffy) Thomas, a
senior lecturer in Computer Science at Glasgow University, who has a
keen interest in Women Into Computing.
Mrs Gillian Burt, now in her fifth year as headmistress of Craigholme,
heads a staff of 50. She says: ''The continuing success of any school
depends on the success of its pupils, which in turn depends on their
value in the increasingly competitive employment marketplace.
''To a large extent success will become reliant on a high-quality
education achieved through the use of information technology and
knowledge of relevant operating systems and software packages.
''In schools, many subjects now demand that pupils plan, research,
analyse and solve problems and prepare written and illustrated reports
using a multi-media approach. It is essential that pupils develop skills
which are becoming vital in tertiary education and the marketplace.
Without IT skills, and the ability to use modern library resources, it
will be increasingly difficult for pupils to progress in their chosen
careers.
''According to our suppliers, Research Machines, Craigholme will have
one of the most powerful computing systems in the country. The next
stage will hopefully be a library and resource area, the more expensive
of the two projects. It will have to be internally built because of
conservation restrictions on the exterior of our buildings.''
Situated in the quiet, leafy heart of Pollokshields on Glasgow's South
Side, Craigholme has a roll of 500 pupils and is an all-through
single-sex girls' school, although it takes boys from nursery (which
starts at age three) through to Junior 4.
Children benefit from specialist teaching in music and PE in Nursery.
''They appear on stage as Fagin's gang in the whole school musical,
Oliver,'' says Mrs Burt. French begins in J1.
''At Craigholme, computer education starts in the Nursery and goes all
the way through the school. My aim is that every girl will leave
Craigholme computer-literate. We now have a fully equipped computer room
and a fully equipped business studies room.
''Mrs Mary Kay teaches computer studies and mathematics, while Mrs
Elizabeth Beak is our business studies expert. Mrs Beak has brought in
all sorts of new courses, including the excellent recently-introduced
Higher Management Information Studies. It has a huge take-up in Scotland
and has wide application across a broad spectrum of careers.''
The school hopes also to develop an Open Access Centre for the wider
community to learn computing skills, which it will add to other adult
education facilities, such as cookery, a variety of art subjects and
creative writing.
There is a daily or occasional care facility for Junior School pupils
at modest charge, from 8-8.30am until 5.45pm in the evening.
Class sizes at Craigholme average 20 in the lower part of the Senior
School, 15-16 in the upper reaches, with still fewer in sixth year. In
the Junior School, classes average around 18.
Mrs Burt is supported by two deputy headmistresses, Mrs Maye McCallum,
head of the Modern Languages department, and Mrs Maureen Payne, head of
Modern Studies, and a head of junior school Mrs Allison Dryburgh.
''We are fortunate to have a super staff,'' says Mrs Burt, whose own
subject is geography. She came to Craigholme from St Margaret's School
for girls in Edinburgh, where she was in charge of Careers.
She said: ''As soon as I walked into this school I thought it felt
right -- and it has been. It has a busy, purposeful atmosphere.''
''My belief in parental choice is very strong, and I do wish that more
parents would exercise that right and go and visit more schools. More
and more are doing so, and increasingly parents are, quite rightly,
asking very searching questions.
''A school like this is almost an extended family,'' says Mrs Burt.
''I -- and every member of staff -- know every child in it and we have a
vertical house system where something like 60 or 70 girls are in the
charge of one person. I can mention any child, and everybody in the year
group and house knows who she is. That is the beauty of it.
''Yet it is not too small, because that can be too oppressive and
stultifying. Children need to work withi a stimulating environment which
is difficult to achieve in a class which is too small. I feel we have a
happy medium here.''
Although she is cautious about quoting examination results, those
achieved by Craigholme are impressive by anyone's standards. This year,
for example, while SCIS (Scottish Council of Independent Schools)
schools achieved Highers at S5 level which averaged 86% Passes at A --
C, Craigholme achieved 93%; CSYS Passes A -- C in SCIS schools averaged
80%, at Craigholme it was 88%. Standard Grade Credit 1 and 2 averaged
82% in SCIS schools, while Craigholme achieved 94%.
Interestingly, in addition to providing a broad curriculum for as long
as possible, and encouraging individual pupils to achieve their highest
possible standard, every girl must take at least one skills-based
modular course.
''Almost all girls go on to university of college -- last year 95%
went to university,'' says Mrs Burt. There are always some who take a
year out, or perhaps do a foundation year in arts in a further education
college, for instance.
Foreign exchanges to France and Germany have taken place over many
years and every girl is encouraged to become a competent linguist, a
skill viewed as a practical business tool of today. Next October will
see a group set off for Spain.
''Last summer the head of Geography organised her second trip to China
-- which we study in Modern Studies. I was on the first, and the
knowledge gained was tremendous,'' says Mrs Burt.
Music, art, drama, sport, a lively school newspaper and magazine
produced by the pupils, charity fundraising, the Duke of Edinburgh Award
Scheme and a Young Enterprise company. Craigholme looks poised to march
toward its second century and into the third millenium with confidence.

<HEADLINE>Minature device irons out power problems in desktop computers. Magnum applies for new patent</HEADLINE>

MAGNUM Power said yesterday it had applied to patent a minature device
which irons out power supply problems in desktop computers using new
types of software.
The volatile shares of the Scottish hi-tech company, which was floated
at 35p in July 1994, soared 266p to 142p in reaction to the news.
The new patent concerns a variant of Magnum Power's mainstream
product, the built-in uninterruptible power supply (BI-UPS) device.
This is a low-cost card attached to the power supply unit of a
computer which preserves power and memory inside the computer in the
event of a mains electricity failure.
Managing director Vincent Lavin said the new version of BI-UPS
prevents the loss of open files in desktop computers using new types of
software such as Microsoft Windows 95 and IBM's OS2 when mains power is
cut off.
A small battery attached to the BI-UPS enables the computer to be
rebooted within 10 to 20 seconds once mains power supply is restored.
Mr Lavin said it could take up to a year for the new device to enter
commercial production, but it would probably be on the market within a
few months.
Magnum will demonstrate the product at the Comdex computer exhibition
in Las Vegas next month.
The device brings to desk-top computers a hibernate/rapid resume
function which until now has only been available on lap-top computers.
In other words, if mains power is cut-off, a snapshot of all open
files is taken and stored on hard disk before the computer closes down.
When power is restored, the computer reboots rapidly into the same
configuration preserving all work, even if it has not been deliberately
stored.
''This is a response to new developments in operating systems and some
subtle changes in power supply systems that are used in the latest
generation of personal computers,'' Mr Lavin said.
''Right now, if you lose power on a desktop computer you could lose
two or three days work,'' he added.
Magnum Power was founded in Coatbridge in 1987, but is due to move to
new headquarters in Livingston shortly.
The company made a pre-tax loss of #2.34m last year, but aims to break
even in 1996 -- a year later than originally planned.
Last month Magnum signed a landmark agreement with Golden Systems of
California, a leading manufacturer of power supply systems for
computers.
Under the terms of this accord, Golden Systems will make all its
equipment compatible with Magnum's BI-UPS devices.

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY
RECOVERY continues at Scottish Metropolitan with the Glasgow-based
property company now on a sounder footing than for many years, writes
ANDREW WILSON.
In the year to mid-August, net rental income rose 14.2% to #18.6m
while pre-tax profits excluding asset sales jumped 50.6% to #8.69m.
As indicated at the interim stage the dividend total has been raised
by a quarter to 2.5p with a 1.5p final.
Managing director Scott Cairns said net assets per share had increased
marginally by 0.4p to 99.7p, but this concealed substantial regional
variations.
In England, everything was negative apart from retail properties in
the north with an overall decline of 4%.
In contrast, Scotland saw some small uplifts in retail and industrial
properties although offices saw their values drop by around 5% --
Glasgow was particularly weak. Lothian, including Edinburgh, has been
strong for the third year running in all sectors.
About 30% of the portfolio is in England although the bias will be
increasingly tipped towards the north -- ScotMet is now completely out
of London.
The long-running saga of the Loreburne Shopping Centre in Dumfries is
becoming less gloomy, with it being 65% let. However, there is as yet
little sign of a buyer for a development which has cost the company
around #20m.
In the last half, decade debt has fallen from #201m to #93.5m and that
is now fixed at 10% on a 30-year debenture with the Bank of Scotland.
There are also #40m of facilities with Lloyds Bank and the Royal Bank of
Scotland.
Debt reduction has left interest covered twice by profits and as only
a small part of the portfolio is over-rented net rental income for the
current year should improve to about #19.5m.
That is being helped both by acquisitions and rent reviews, although
caution remains the watchword with the company having #4m in the bank
which is currently earning less than the interest payable on the
debenture.
The increase in net asset value reflects an uplift in values of
recently acquired property. There should, or could, be an advance to
about 104p this year.
At 74p the shares are standing at a 26% discount to net asset value,
which is cheap against the property sector, and are solidly underpinned
by the rising rental income.

EDINBURGH Investment Trust, which has gross assets of nearly #1200m,
turned in a mixed performance during the six months to September 30.
Net asset value increased 11.8%, but failed to match a 12.7% rise in
the FTSE Actuaries All-Share Index.
Fund manager David McCraw said the trust underperformed its benchmark
index due to a disappointing performance by fixed income stocks and
overseas equities and a high exposure to cyclical UK stocks such as
Hanson, Ladbroke and P&amp;O.
The trust has, therefore, reduced its portfolio of gilts and overseas
equities in order to invest #43m in UK smaller companies, where strong
earnings growth is expected in the near future.
The good news is a 6.6% rise in the interim dividend, which was easily
covered by a 14.2% improvement in earnings per share. This keeps
dividend growth well ahead of UK inflation running at 3.9%.

BUSINESS INVESTMENT LOANS
CLYDESDALE Bank believes its discounted Business Investment Loan,
launched today, will boost the Scottish economy by tipping manufacturing
companies' thinking in favour of capital expenditure.
Although #16,000 to #1m loans are available to all small and
medium-sized companies, Clydesdale Bank deputy chief executive Fred
Goodwin sees the manufacturing sector as the main beneficiary.
He said: ''What we see is a large number of customers, particularly
manufacturing customers, whose capacity is starting to be used up and
which stand at the threshold of whether to make new investment or not.''
The Glasgow-based bank, which is owned by National Australia Bank
Group, has earmarked #175m for its Business Investment Loan, although
more funds will be made available if the demand is there.
Its product comprises a variable rate option, which offers borrowers
1% off the normal lending rate for the first 12 months or a 2%, one-year
discount if the client already has, or takes, another Clydesdale Bank
product such as general insurance. Variable rate loans are repayable
over a two to 10-year period.
There are also three and five-year loans at a fixed rate,
incorporating similar discounts to the variable rate option.
Although Mr Goodwin acknowledged Clydesdale Bank was operating in a
highly-competitive market-place, he denied the launch of the Business
Investment Loan was a knee-jerk reaction to boost lending.
The bank's latest initiative follows hard on the heels of the Business
Booster Loan, which was launched last autumn. Clydesdale Bank ultimately
lent #125m under this scheme, a greater sum than it had envisaged.
Mr Goodwin said: ''We tried to do something (then) to stimulate the
economy and it was highly successful. Unfortunately, the feel-good
factor has not returned and there is still the need for that stimulus.''
Although Mr Goodwin is well aware that other banks are willing to
offer certain business customers special deals, he claims Clydesdale
Bank has sent a unique signal to the market-place.
He said: ''If you are seriously intending to stimulate economic
activity, you have to make a statement.
''We have to be prepared to stand by our belief. Our belief is that
this segment of the market will welcome this type of support. This is
why we are making this offer in an open and public way.''
Mr Goodwin believes Scottish companies must continue to invest in the
pursuit of better quality at lower cost.

THE high cost of acquiring livestock quotas could be a factor in
bringing about a general downward move in the level of rents for hill
livestock units, John Rhind, managing director of Aberdeen and Northern
Land and Estate Agents, told a conference on agricultural quotas in
Aberdeen.
Quotas belonged to the tenant and should not really concern the
landlord, he said. There was, however, an indirect effect which had only
recently become apparent and might have an influence in the longer term.
''Where a hill farm is being offered to let the incoming tenant will
be required to take over the ewe stock at valuation, along with various
other items and improvements,'' he said.
''Unless he has his own quota the incoming tenant will be required, in
addition, to take over the quota belonging to the outgoing tenant. A
unit of 1000 ewes will require an additional #30,000 of tenant's
capital. This represents an added burden on the business side which, in
an already well-borrowed situation, may mean cutting back on the rent
that can be offered.
''A tenant going to his banker for an extra #30,000 to fund the quota
can offer no additional security and the question of financing the quota
may tip the balance of the viability of the whole enterprise against the
tenant.''
As open market lettings were the guide for negotiating rent reviews it
was possible that lower open market rents could in time pull down the
general level of rents in the hill livestock sector.
Dealing with arable aid payments, Mr Rhind said that they had had a
substantial effect on land values. Eligibility for arable aid was the
first question many farmers wanted to know about a farm for sale -- and
there had been several sales which had fallen through when land was
found to be ineligible.
''Should arable aid payments be stopped then there is no doubt that
land values would fall,'' he said. Severe discounts would apply to farms
where there was a high proportion of ineligible land. Worry over the
continuing level of arable aid payments was already undermining
confidence in the land market.
In the tenanted sector, he forecast, the rental value of arable land
would probably peak next year at around #55 per acre for the best arable
units.
The high price of milk quota would continue to encourage owners of
large dairy units to dispose of quota -- an asset which they never had
to pay for in the first place. The overall price of land plus quota
would, however, inhibit the sale of a large dairy units as a going
concern.
Some smaller units might go to existing dairy farmers who already had
quota but no new entrants would move into the sector, given the present
cost of buying or leasing, and the long-term worries about the milk
quota system.
Professor Ken Thomson of Aberdeen University's department of
agricultural and rural economics said that quotas were here to stay for
the next 10 years at least. He described them as a ''second-best'' or
even ''third-best'' form of policy instrument which struck at the heart
of the market system.
Prices, he said, acted as signals between the farmer and the consumer.
Quotas attempted to replace some of that function with administrative
decision-making. The quota system had been brought in because of the
failures of basic policy instruments. ''They would disappear if we got
the right primary instruments.''
The importance to farmers of a reference to quotas in their wills was
emphasised by Ian Kenny of the Scottish Agricultural College rural
business unit. Where no proper disposal had been indicated in a will it
was possible that relatives could lodge a claim which would deprive a
farm of quotas which were essential for its profitability, he warned.

PRUDENTIAL'S decision to set up a banking operation appears such an
obvious move that it is surprising it didn't do it earlier.
The insurance business pays out about #1000m a year in pay outs on
endowment policies and it makes a lot of sense to try and capture some
of this outflow through offering interest bearing accounts.
Similarly with mortgages handing #700m worth of mortgage business on a
plate to building societies and banks seems unnecessarily generous.
Retaining this in house will bring in another profit stream.
Analysts following Prudential were pleased with the move, and these
shares edged ahead. They were pleased that the group had decided to go
it alone rather than pay out a large sum to buy a bank or more likely, a
building society with all the integration problems this would bring.
The group has certainly got the right man to develop its new business.
Michael Harris has done it before with First Direct which has proved a
success. Telephone banking has to be the way forward given the huge
expense of maintaining a branch network compared with the low cost of
telephone only systems.
The move is yet another example of the changing face of the financial
services industry, with traditional boundaries becoming increasingly
blurred.
It is bad news for the banks. They will face to more competition,
exposing their relatively high cost base which will make more branch
closures inevitable.
The trend is towards larger groupings offering a wide range of
services from insurance to banking and savings. There will be variations
from company to company but the overall pattern is clear. The main
winners will be those who have the right combination of services with
the lowest costs, though there will always be room for smaller niche
players who are quicker on their feet than the majors.

THE second day of the October Bull Sales in Perth yesterday put the
Limousins in the spotlight with yet another very sound commercial trade.
The top price paid twice was 10,500 guineas, firstly by Altnaharra
Estates, Lairg, Sutherland, for the April 1994 Broadmeadows Jerico from
Douglas Crichton, Chesters, Garvald, East Lothian. Another commercial
buyer, Charles Simpson, Mains of Creuchies, Alyth, matched that bid to
secure the reserve junior champion, the June 1994 Elgin Junction from
Jimmy Pettigrew, Langmuirhead, Lenzie.
Aberdeenshire breeders Bob and Jean Burnell, Crownhead, Inverurie, had
another successful day, selling their February 1994 Crownhead Jasper at
7200gns to Tom Cheshire, Manor Farm, North Marston, Buckinghamshire.
The junior champion from Douglas Crichton, the April 1994 Broadmeadows
Jereska, was another to attract spirited bidding, selling for 6500gns to
J&amp;J Wylie, Knockhouse, Dunfermline. However, this will be the last time
Broadmeadows bulls will be sold in Perth as the herd is to be dispersed
next month.
At 6200gns, Mrs ME Brown, Housenrigg, Aspatria, Cumbria, purchased the
April 1994 Derg Jazz from James Allen, Fyfin Road, Strabane, Northern
Ireland, while at 5800gns Stephen Irvine, Overtoun, Aberlour,
Banffshire, sold to FA McArthur, Drummond, Eventon, Ross-shire.
Atholl Estates, Ballochallan, Ballinluig, which regularly purchases
bulls at this sale, paid 6000gns for one from William James, Grangehill,
Forres, Morayshire, while heading the list of many Orcadian buyers,
Stewart Wood, Garston, Stromness, went to 5500gns to purchase one from
MT Jones, Bailea, Brecon, Powys.
At the same price Blairgowrie commercial breeders David Amory,
Glenfernate, and Dick Michie, Cluneskea, shared one from Alan McArthur,
Cretlevane, Balfron, and Richard Oates, Oxnam Row, Jedburgh, purchased a
first prize winner form Norman Cruickshank, Cowford, Lanark.
Overall 118 bulls averaged #3045 -- up #7.80 on 1994 when 101 were
sold.
Canadian judge Wilf Davis found his champion in a senior bull from
Billy Robson, Kilbride, Ballyclare, Northern Ireland, with the reserve
prize going to the intermediate champion from Willie Gill, Milnafua,
Rosskeen, Ross-shire.

NOT surprisingly, Gillian Burt is a strong and passionate supporter of
single-sex education for girls, from the age of puberty onwards.
''Up until that stage, co-education is fine, but I do feel that girls
benefit from single-sex education thereafter. Research has shown that
girls achieve more in such an environment. Particularly in the
traditional male strongholds of science and maths. The degree of
confidence in the senior girls of all ability levels and interests has
got to be seen to be appreciated,'' she says.
''We aim to turn out girls who are confident, well-rounded
individuals,'' she continues.
The range of disciplines the girls opt for is broad: ''We have our
share of doctors, lawyers and accountants, but generally they cover a
wide spectrum including engineering and computing. Their general belief
is that the world is their oyster, and I've never heard of anyone being
put off something because it is male dominated -- in a large girls'
school like this you find between six and nine doing SYS Chemistry ad
SYS Maths,'' says Mrs Burt.
''The majority stay for sixth year, which is the stage at which I
believe in broadening horizons. In fifth year, the main emphasis is on
achieving good Higher grades.
''In sixth year, we start with a weekend at Crieff Hydro, very much a
team building experience which sets the scene for the session. The girls
get to know the management team at school in ways they haven't before,
they see the staff in a different light.''
The school, Mrs Burt explains, does not operate a prefect system. ''I
don't believe in that, we have some named jobs: head girl, deputies and
a games captain, but I do feel a prefects' system is fine -- for
prefects. But it says everything to the ones who are not. What does that
do for self-esteem? It brings out also, I think, undesirable qualities
in the prefects -- and I speak from having been one myself.''
Instead, Craigholme ensures that every girl at this stage has the
opportunity to experience leadership and teamwork. ''They're not all
going to become leaders at 22,'' Mrs Burt goes on. ''And you must know
how to be part of a team before you can lead. These qualities are
important. We have a sixth form social committee, an environment
committee and a charities committee for example.
''Girls may be taking part in the D of E Award scheme or play in the
first hockey team, but even the one who has done nothing like that, in
sixth year, will be obliged to participate in something.''
This year every girl is taking part in the Young Enterprise Scheme.

PEOPLE reaching retirement age in the next century who are not in a
pension scheme or making appropriate savings for the day they stop work
face an impoverished ''third age'' given the way the state pension is
declining.
The Thatcher Government made it possible for employees not to be made
to join the company pension scheme with the idea of increasing freedom
of choice.
It has turned out to have been a great mistake as we have seen with
the pensions mis-selling scandal, which has only served to put people
off making arrangements, and the reluctance of some people to give up a
small proportion of their income now for income in retirement or who are
not putting enough aside.
As it is there is a raft of people who are going to end up with no
pension at all apart from a miserly state provision.
The UK state scheme has always looked rather mean but is destined to
become derisory. In the 1970s the basic pension was equivalent to some
20% of average earnings. Then its link to earnings was broken and it is
now only revalued in line with inflation.
It is down to 15% of average earnings and is forecast to fall to just
7% in 50 years time. The state earnings related scheme (SERPS) has also
been progressively downgraded.
However much the Government and savings industry exhort people to
provide for their old age there is always going to be a core of the
working population who will make no provision. These people can hardly
be allowed to starve on the streets so the Government of the day is
going to have to provide for them willy nilly.
It is imperative that the Government makes it compulsory for people to
be in some form of pension scheme, as is the case in Australia for
example. This does not necessarily mean that all companies would have to
set up a scheme.
There is great scope for the development of industry-wide schemes
which would have a number of major advantages, and not just for small
companies. They are more common in other countries than in the UK,
though there are some examples here such as the Merchant Navy Fund, and
the Solicitors' Staff Fund.
The cost and complexity of running an in-house pension scheme is
escalating rapidly. It may well still be cost-effective for large
companies to have their own in-house scheme but for smaller and even
medium-sized companies this is becoming increasingly problematic.
The rules and regulations governing schemes have been become tougher
in recent years and the Maxwell scandal has resulted in further
complexity. Then there is the input from Brussels and the complications
of rules governing transfers, additional voluntary contributions, Inland
Revenue requirements and now equality of treatment between the sexes.
Far from being a fringe department run by a man and a boy, the average
pension scheme requires technically qualified people to run it.
Admittedly much can be farmed out but it would be much easier for many
companies to hand over the whole thing to an industry-wide scheme which
would have economies of scale enabling the right people and systems to
be on hand. This would translate into lower costs to everyone's benefit.
One of the reasons for the Thatcher Government's decision to enable
employees to take out a personal pension plan rather than be forced to
join their employer's scheme was to give them greater flexibility. Early
leavers generally get a poor deal in terms of transfer values or
deferred pensions, though the latter now have to be revalued by
inflation or 5% whichever is the lower, which has improved the
situation.
These days, with the traditional job for life almost extinct, most
people come into the category of early leaver. The industry-wide scheme
is the solution to this. Most people change firms but they are likely to
stay within the same industry where their experience lies. If they are
in a industry scheme changing employer represents a minor alteration and
the transfer problem does not arise.
The disadvantage from the company view is that within an industry
scheme it will not have an internal fund to ''raid'' should it become
overfunded. Reduction in employee numbers and strong investment
performance have led many schemes to be in surplus and companies have
not been slow to exploit this unexpected resource, usually through
contribution holidays or occasionally actual transfers of money into the
company's coffers.
It is certainly not impossible that an industry-wide scheme could run
into surplus, allowing company participants a contributon holiday but
equity would be difficult to achieve. Some firms would qualify for a
longer holiday than others.
On the other hand mis-use of the pension fund would be difficult if
not impossible as control of the scheme would be with genuinely
independent trustees. The industry-wide scheme would be much larger and
so have greater depth than all but the largest individual schemes so
providing greater security against a sudden downturn in investment
markets or possible underfunding by the company.
Compulsion might go against the grain for some Tories but the pension
question is too important for ideology. The type of plan could be left
to the individual, so long as a percentage of his income was put into a
recognised pension scheme.
Like income tax and National Insurance it would be the employer's
responsibility to ensure the regular payments were made and it would add
little to his administration costs.

DOES the average insurance policy holder or pensioner have the
slightest inkling as to how well a fund's property investments are
doing? Many would be shocked if they knew as a great many would not
stand close comparison with the quoted property companies.
That puts up a good case for the small property company as an
investment as opposed to the Big Six sector giants led by Land
Securities.
A major criterion has always been net asset value and whether the
share is standing at a discount or premium -- the latter is the case
only when there is well above average management and, more particularly,
outstanding growth opportunities on development.
The sector is currently standing on discount of about 9% although it
can range as to well above 40% in some of the near burnt-out cases where
gearing and, more important, interest cover remain suspect.
However, to move the net asset value of Land Securities by more than a
few pence in any one deal would require a very major transaction.
But good management and the right deals can make an appreciable
difference to the smaller fry, particularly if there is a single large
project being developed. This should appeal to many of the smaller
institutions and pension funds which may have their own property
activities at present but where they almost inevitably do not have the
resources to know a particular market in any one part of Britain
intimately.
So they can be taken to the cleaners by the agents -- and few will
know outside the organisation.
In contrast, the movement of company net asset values is scutinised
with each set of annual results and anything outside the general trend
will require detailed explanation.
Fund trustees may well consider a property share to in-house
investment if it can offer interest covered at least 1.7 times by
profits from a diversified portfolio that is not over-rented and so
there are no reductions in rental income when a lease is renewed.
If the share is standing at a discount of more than 15% to net asset
value and offers a progressive dividend but well-covered it is something
certainly worth thinking about as a lower risk alternative to direct
investment.

MAGNUM Power is one of those Scottish hi-tech companies that seems
constantly on the verge of a major commercial breakthrough, but never
quite gets there.
Its share price is as volatile as a yo-yo, so don't tell your granny
to invest her life savings in it.
That said, anyone who bought Magnum shares at 35p each at flotation
last year will have quadrulped his money in the light of yesterday's 26p
gain to 142p. Not bad going.
But before you get ecstatic over the news that Magnum has just
patented a device to prevent your Microsoft Windows 95 computer software
from crashing in the event of power failure, remember that Magnum shares
plunged 35p on July 20, when the company said it would take a year
longer than expected to break even.
The problem is that Magnum's idea looks brilliant on the drawing
board, but the beast is proving very slow to take wings and fly.
Memory Corporation is another wunderkind of Silicon Glen. That
Dalkieth-based company has come up with a way to correct defective
computer chips and make them even better than factory-approved
originals.
Great, but that elusive commercial breakthrough is still just around
the corner.
Of course, we all hope these hi-tech companies headed by young boffins
will do well, creating fat profits, lots of jobs and putting Scotland at
the forefront of computer technology.
But even if they do succeed commercially, their brilliance may be
shortlived.
Remember Rodime, the Scottish company that pioneered the development
of computer disk drives in the 1980s? Once it owned factories, produced
healthy profits and employed hundreds.
Now competitors have mastered the same technology and Rodime's
business has caved in. Earnings have dried up and the company's only
paid retainers are lawyers fighting losing battles to uphold its patents
in the United States.
Hi-tech stocks are fun, but only if you are the gambling type.

<HEADLINE>Former mine site to be location for out-of-town development. Freeport Leisure plans #6.2m project for Livingston area</HEADLINE>

FREEPORT Leisure plans to open a #6.2m out-of-town shopping and
leisure centre near Livingston in central Scotland next year.
Situated on the site of a former mine at Westwood, four miles from the
M8, its cheap shopping and entertainments are designed to attract
families on day trips from both Edinburgh and Glasgow.
''The demographics of that area tell us that there are four million
people within 60 minutes drive time of that particular location,'' said
Freeport chief executive Sean Collidge.
Westwood's shops will be let to High Street retailers, specialising in
clothing, footwear and household goods. But instead of the
top-of-the-line goods they offer in Edinburgh's Princes Street and
Glasgow's Buchanan Street, they will offer cheap seconds, surplus items
and end-of-line goods.
But there will also be a creche, restaurants and entertainments to
keep mum, dad and the kiddies occupied once the car boot has been loaded
up with bargains.
There will be a heritage centre focusing on mining and railways in
East Lothian, a butterfly house, a mini-zoo featuring birds of prey and
gentle walks between newly landscaped pit bings.
The buildings will be rapidly erected steel structures, but they will
be roofed with tiles and covered with rough casting to blend in with the
local style of architecture.
Mr Collidge said Westwood would be aimed at a hard core of consumers
in the C1 and C2 categories.
Freeport already operates two similar centres in England, which are
based on a shopping-and-leisure concept developed in the United States
20 years ago. One is situated at Hornsea on Humberside and the other at
Fleetwood in Lancashire.
These have attracted quality retailers such as Laura Ashley, Next,
Acquascutum, Moss Bros, Lee Jeans, Dillons the Book Shop, and Edinburgh
Crystal.
Freeport has agreed to purchase the Westwood site for #700,000 and
will spend up to #5.5m developing it in time for a planned opening in
mid-1996.
Outlining planning permission for the 154-acre site has already been
obtained.
Initially the company will develop only 37 acres, building car parks,
50,000sq ft of retail space, a heritage centre and other indoor and
outdoor amusements.
The rest will be landscaped and threaded with paths and bridleways.
Freeport announced a one-for-one rights issue at 100p to raise #9.5m
to fund the Westwood development and expand the Hornsea and Fleetwood
sites.
Freeport shares fell 5p to 115p after the announcement.
The company said it planned to develop a fourth site in England, which
has not yet been finally chosen, next year. That will be financed by a
#3m loan from Barclays Bank.
Freeport announced its expansion into Scotland alongside encouraging
results for its first year of trading.
The company reported a pre-tax profit of #103,000 on turnover of
#1.86m for the year to July 2.
This included only 49 weeks of trading at Hornsea, where all retail
space has been fully let, and virtually no contribution from Fleetwood,
which only opened in June this year.
Fleetwood attracted 625,000 visitors during its first three months of
trading, exceeding all expectations, and the number of visitors to
Hornsea was 25% up on the same period last year.
Chairman John Cohen said: ''Against a general background of subdued
retail trading in the UK, the group's performance since the year-end has
been very encouraging.''
He described Freeport's future prospects as ''excellent.''

DALGETY served up the latest in a line of #293m food business sales
today when a management team agreed to buy its Golden Wonder snacks
division.
Golden Wonder, which includes crisps and bagged snacks like Wotsits,
is being sold for #54.6m.
The bagged snacks business operates from three factories in
Scunthorpe, Widnes, and Corby and has its head office in Market
Harborough, Leicestershire.
''All the 2100 staff are transferring to the new owners,'' Dalgety's
chief executive Richard Clothier said.
The latest shake-up at Dalgety follows the sale of its Pot Noodle
making hot snacks business for #180m and the disposal of cooking sauces
for #58.6m.
''I am particularly pleased that the management team is buying this
business and I wish them every success as an independent company.
''This completes the sale of our consumer foods businesses following
the acquisition of Quaker's European Petfoods,'' Mr Clothier added.
Dalgety is selling the business to a team headed by Clive Sharpe with
financial backing from Legal &amp; General Ventures.
The deal does not include the food mixes business which will be
integrated into Dalgety's flour ingredients operation.

ELECTRONICS
Maynard, Massachusetts, Tuesday -- Digital Equipment Corporation,
which earlier this year began manufacturing personal computers for
Europe at a new plant in Irvine, yesterday reported 32% growth in
first-quarter PC revenues worldwide.
No breakdown of Irvine's individual contribution is produced but, on
the face of it, Digital's results' statement seems to be good news for
the plant, which employs about 450 people.
Digital made a $48m profit in its first quarter -- the computer
maker's fourth consecutive profitable quarter after suffering a loss of
$131m a year ago.
The company said total operating revenues for the quarter grew by 5%
to $3270m from $3120m a year ago. It added that revenues were up in all
geographical regions.
Digital employs nearly 2000 people in Scotland. Its desk-top
workstation and server plant at Ayr, which employs about 1500, is one of
the US group's largest.
''Digital continues to move ahead strongly,'' chairman Robert Palmer
said. ''In a quarter that is historically weak due to seasonal softness
in the European markets, we increased overall revenue and showed
impressive order rate growth worldwide.''
Digital said its gross operating margins, a measure of profitability,
improved to 32.2% from 30.2%.
The profit amounted to 26 cents a share, compared with a loss of 98
cents a share a year ago. Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate,
according to First Call, was for earnings of 23 cents per share.
Digital said product revenues rose 10% to $1810m from $1650m. After
adjustments for divestments, product revenue from its ongoing businesses
was up 22%.
''We are getting back on track to achieve solid revenue growth and
profitability in our PC business this fiscal year,'' Mr Palmer said.
Digital said it was successfully transitioning its PC business into a
new phase in which it plans to capture market share through new
channels, such as large retailers like Circuit City and OfficeMax.
The company said it ended the quarter with $1500m cash on hand, an
increase of $620m from a year ago. It ended fiscal 1995 with $1600m in
cash.
Digital said that although it continues to make overall progress in
asset management, it was adversely affected by shortages in components
supplies that caused some manufacturing delays and resulted in higher
inventories.
Digital ended the first quarter with approximately 61,500 employees, a
reduction of 12,300 positions from a year ago. -- Reuter.
* COMPUTER maker Unisys Corporation reported a third-quarter loss amid
weakness in its European and US operations and said it will take a
fourth-quarter charge to restructure the businesses.
The size of the charge and impact on jobs have not been determined, it
said. The company, based in Blue Bell, Pennsylvannia, shed 4000 jobs
last year.
Unisys had a loss of $32.2m, or 36 cents a share, in the quarter ended
September 30. In the year-ago period, the company earned profits of
$42.9m, or 8 cents a share, including $12.1m from the discontinued
defence business it sold in May 1995.
Revenue edged down to $1460m from $1480m.
Earlier this month, Unisys announced an aggressive plan to improve its
European and US businesses.

AN Edinburgh-based fund management group looks set to overthrow the
board of a London-based investment trust and bring the funds concerned
into its own nest.
The bold cross-Border raid by Colin McLean's Scottish Value Management
(SVM), details of which were revealed in a Stock Exchange announcement
yesterday, appears to have caught Throgmorton Preferred Income Trust's
current manager, Framlington, off-guard.
SVM's Scottish Value Trust (SVT) has secured the backing of
shareholders who own 52.09% of Throgmorton Preferred Income -- enough to
see its proposed ordinary resolutions passed.
SVT, which invests in other investment trusts and owns 10.33% of
Throgmorton Preferred Income, will seek the sacking of the London-based
trust's four-strong board at an extraordinary meeting it yesterday
requisitioned.
It also proposes that investment management responsibilities are taken
from Framlington Investment Management, which runs all of the
Throgmorton trusts, and assigned to SVM.
Justifying its unusual move, SVT said it was ''necessary...to protect
the value of its investment'' in Throgmorton Preferred Income, which
invests in the Preference shares and attached warrants of unquoted
companies with market capitalisations of between #8m and #35m.
SVT was concerned about the length of time it was taking Throgmorton
Preferred Income to invest the money raised at its launch in November
1993, and the quality of the investments which had been made.
However, the move sparked an angry response from Framlington group
managing director Mike Vogel, who said yesterday: ''We are obviously
very disappointed by today's actions.''
Referring to the specialist nature of the trust, he added: ''We would
have some serious questions as to whether the expertise to (run the
trust) lies with the camp which has orchestrated this. It is a very
specialised approach.''
However, Mr McLean, who is well used to running specialist funds, said
the level of support already secured by SVT demonstrated a ''high level
of institutional concern'' with the current management of the trust.
Even though SVT has the backing of the majority of Throgmorton
Preferred Income shareholders, Mr Vogel refused to accept defeat.
Although unspecific about what action Framlington and Throgmorton
could possibly take, he said that, in conjunction with their brokers and
legal advisers, they were looking at the situation ''from a number of
different angles''.
Assuming its move is successful, SVM's funds under management will be
boosted by about #55m to #325m.
The Edinburgh-based fund manager plans to appoint SVT chairman Bob
Borthwick, Philip Swinstead, a non-executive director of Ivory &amp; Sime
Enterprise Capital, and Sam Wauchope, until recently the chief executive
of Acorn Computers, to the Throgmorton Preferred Income board.
Although taken aback by the coup, Framlington had made changes to
speed up the investment process after discussions with Mr McLean at the
end of last year.
It believed the relationship with SVT had improved.

RECENT acquisitions coupled with strong performances from Wolseley's
French and American operations helped annual profits power ahead to a
record #245.4m, the world's biggest distributor of plumbing and heating
equipment revealed yesterday.
In the previous year to the end of July, the group's taxable profits
amounted to #202.3m.
''The performances of our businesses in France and the USA were
particular highlights of the year,'' chairman Jeremy Lancaster said.
''Brossette demonstrated the quality of its business and management by
achieving a substantial increase in profitability in a relatively flat
market.
''All of our US distribution companies made good progress, although as
predicted at the half-year stage, the rate of growth slowed at Carolina
Builders and Erb Lumber in a softening US housing market.''
Its American plumbing supplies businesses increased turnover by 16%
and trading profit by 32% while Lyon Colkin, the heating and air
conditioning business bought in early June, benefited from prolonged hot
weather.
Hobson Broker, the Atlanta-based lumber distribution organisation
bought in May took advantage of the build up to the Olympic games which
are to be held in the city next year.
Trading in the UK improved marginally in the run-up to Christmas, but
any gains were diluted in the second-half and in the last quarter in
particular, Mr Lancaster said.
However, its building and plumbing merchants businesses managed to
improve turnover and profits.
Builder Center and HRPC, its heating parts and controls distributor
did particularly well.
The group, based at Droitwich in Worcestershire, now boasts 244 Plumb
Centers.
Shareholders will receive a total dividend payout of 9.8p against
8.36p previously on earnings per share of 29.72p compared with 25.39p.
Mr Lancaster announced he is to retire as chairman in July next year.
Richard Ireland, currently a non-executive director and the previous
finance director, is to take over as chairman, while John Young, the
deputy group chief executive, will become chief executive on August 1.

Insurance giant's move focuses attention on Standard Life's one-third
stake in Bank of Scotland.
THE Prudential is to broaden its business base with a move into
banking, drawing on its large customer base to develop a deposit-taking
and lending business within a few years.
The group has applied to the Bank of England for a deposit-taking
licence and expects to start offering a telephone-based banking service
by the end of 1996. It anticipated investing #20m this year and #50m
next in the venture. The money will go on computer equipment, staff
training, and office space.
Prudential has recruited Michael Harris, who set up the first
telephone bank, First Direct, part of Midland Bank. The venture will be
backed up the Prudential's large salesforce.
''We enjoy relationships with six million customers in the UK and can
benefit from a well-established and well-regarded brand,'' said John
Sutcliffe, Prudential's UK chief executive.
The group already arranges #700m worth of mortgages each year using a
panel of building societies and banks. It will gradually hope to keep
this business for itself. Mr Sutcliffe said this would probably ''take a
couple of years'' to achieve.
The #700m represents just 10% of the total mortgages taken out by
Prudential customers who buy its life and investment products so there
is clear scope to increase the buiness so long as it can match it with
deposits.
Here the group hopes to cash in on the #1000m or so its customers take
away in maturing policies, most of which ends up in building society and
bank accounts because the group does not offer a similar home for the
cash.
It is hoped to retain about half this money and more will come in from
competitive interest rates. Without branches it will have low costs,
with initial staffing put at 300, most of whom still have to be
recruited.
Initially only a savings and lending service will be offered. Mr
Sutcliffe commented: ''We're tackling it from the basis that we want to
be sure that from day one we offer a standard of service that is
attractive to the customer, to give us a long-term footing.''
Once the basic services are well established others will be grafted
on.
Prudential is not the first insurer to set up a banking arm. Scottish
Widows received the go-ahead from the Bank of England to be a licensed
deposit-taker which enabled it to widen its product range.
The latest move must focus attention on Standard Life's one-third
stake in Bank of Scotland and a possible tie-up between the two.
A bid for Bank of Scotland is highly unlikely given that Standard is
determined to retain mutual status which would make a major takeover
difficult. But closer ties could be forged so that customers are more
likely to channel cash from maturing policies into Bank of Scotland
deposit accounts.
On the other hand if Standard wanted to follow the Prudential's
example and set up a banking function it would have to sell its Bank of
Scotland stake.

CBI INDUSTRIAL TRENDS SURVEY
THE Confederation of British Industry reiterated yesterday that the
next move in interest rates should be down although not before the
Budget.
The call came against a background of falling manufacturing output and
the lowest level of UK business confidence since October 1992 as
reflected in the CBI's Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey for October.
Scotland, though, appears to be bucking the trend in some respects. On
the upside, price pressures are easing.
The Survey, which on the plus side shows pressures easing, follows the
third quarter GDP earlier this week which fell on an annualised basis
but was in line with market projections and generally accepted in the
City as supporting the official view that growth was still continuing at
a sustainable level. And the CBI sought to play down fears that recovery
was in danger of stalling.
Andrew Buxton, chairman of the CBI's Econonmic Affairs Committee,
said: ''The slowdown in growth indicated by the survey results is a
warning signal, but does not warrant over-reaction. Output and orders
are still rising, helped by growing exports which have partly offset the
dip in home demand.
This is expected to continue over the coming months, although
manufacturers are becoming a little more concerned about demand
prospects and competitive pressures in overseas markets.'' He said the
conditions for sustained growth over the medium term remain in place,
however.
The CBI has been of the view over the past few months that interest
rates should be cut but only when there is no danger that they might
have to be increased again, something that would really dent any return
of consumer confidence.
Mr Buxton emphasised that the survey was not pointing to the onset of
recession because manufacturing industry was still growing, albeit
slowly, and the service sector of the economy was buoyant. He conceded,
though, that there were concerns about the recovery and said the next
move in base rates, pegged at 6.75% since February, should be down,
although not immediately. ''I think it would be wrong now to cut
interest rates before the Budget. Let's see how the markets take the
Budget,'' he said.
The sharp decline in business confidence reflects the slower growth in
export orders since July and a fall in domestic demand. But firms expect
that both total orders and output will grow moderately over the next
four months.
In the survey, 25% of manufacturers said their volume of output was
up, while 18% said it was down, leaving a positive balance of 7%, the
lowest figure for two years. This was accompanied by a build-up of all
types of stock, although a rundown is expected.
Total new orders have also grown at the slowest rate for two years.
Within the total, 22% of firms said domestic orders were up and 25%
down, leaving a negative balance of 3%. And while export demand is still
rising, with a positive balance of 11%, this is less rapid than expected
and is down on the record levels set earlier in the year. However, over
the next four months domestic demand is expected to rise slightly, with
stronger growth in export orders.
The survey said domestic prices have risen more slowly than expected
over the past four months. They have gone up at the slowest rate for a
year, suggesting domestic profit margins have been squeezed more than in
July. Export prices also slowed slightly more than expected. Both
domestic and export prices are projected to rise at a similar rate over
the coming four months.
James Capel's Adam Cole said the survey painted a broadly neutral
picture of both activity and prices relative to other recent survey
evidence. While headline business optimism fell for the second
successive quarter, this was due to the normal seasonal pattern of
business optimism. Overall business optimism remains consistent with
with quarterly GDP growth of around [1/2]%.
But, said Mr Cole, investment intentions fell slightly in October
against a background of a modest rise in capacity utilisation. The
release has few policy implcations and there is little pressure for
interest rates to either rise or fall in the near term, Mr Cole added.
Investment intentions for capital equipment remain positive, but are
less buoyant than reported in the last survey. A positive balance of 12%
of firms still planned to spend more on plant and machinery in the year
ahead, down from 17% in July, but 7% of companies intend to cut back on
investment in buildings.
The survey also suggested strong increases in planned spending on
training over the next 12 months, regarded as particularly important by
the CBI and one of the themes of its annual conference to be held next
month.

ENTERPRISING SCOTS
SCOTTISH entrepreneurs Karen and Jim McBride have migrated south to
help foul-smelling rubbish bins come up smelling of roses.
The couple has invested #10,000 in a unique hi-tech wheely bin mobile
cleaning service to neutralise an English neighbourhood's nasty smells.
They left Houston, near Glasgow, two months ago to launch the service
after market research showed Hampshire wheely bins were starting to
pong.
Mr McBride spent a month canvassing his idea on doorsteps in the
Fareham area before deciding to bring his family to the South Coast.
The ex-Navy couple sold their cafe business and moved to Gosport, near
Fareham, with their three children aged nine, five and two. ''Our cafe
was reasonably successful but it was hard work and the weather was
dreadful!'' said Mrs McBride.
''We looked into the wheely bins market in Scotland but they are only
just beginning to catch on and it's a much more complex situation.''
Now equipped with their special van, complete with hydraulic lift and
water tank, the McBrides are promising a mess-free door-to-door service.
For #2 a time they will clean the bin every month using high-powered
brushes, water jets and floral fragrances.
In the first two weeks of operation the company has already attracted
150
clients and Mrs McBride is confident the concept will catch on. ''We
leave people's bins smelling absolutely beautiful and properly
sterilised at the same time,''' she said.
''During the summer all I heard was how smelly and grimy everybody's
wheely
bins were so I thought there must be a market for something here.
''It's a very good service, and one that people are very pleased with
so far because we are not just giving the bins a quick rinse.''
At the moment Mrs McBride and husband Jim are only targeting the
41,000 wheely bins in Fareham. ''If we can get 10% of that market we
will be happy,'' she said.
''We are hoping both Portsmouth and Gosport will switch to wheely bins
in the near future because then we can really expand.''

INTERNET
THE UK's first dedicated Internet services and multimedia publishing
house was officially launched yesterday by Caledonian Publishing, which
owns The Herald and The Evening Times.
Caledonian Information and Media Services (CIMS) has already created
Internet sites for prestigious clients such as Bank of Scotland and
Scottish Financial Enterprise, the umbrella group of the financial
services industry.
Internet versions of Caledonian Newspapers' daily titles, ''The
Electronic Herald'' and ''Evening Times Online'', were also perfected
for yesterday's official launch.
The Herald and Evening Times became the first Scottish daily
newspapers to go live on the Internet back in the summer.
However, the range of material which Internet ''surfers'' can download
electronically has since been significantly expanded.
The Electronic Herald is aimed at expatriate Scots and, although
free-of-charge at the moment, subscribers will ultimately pay about $100
(#63) a year for it.
Evening Times Online will target a West-Central Scottish audience. It
will form the keystone of a proposed ''Online Electronic City'', in
which subscribers will be able to shop on-line, book restaurants,
reserve theatre and cinema tickets, view clips of movies, read reviews
of shows, and access cultural and educational material.
More details of this project will be announced later this year.
VOICE, the division of CIMS which is putting businesses on the
Internet, has also produced Web sites for Government agency Scottish
Enterprise, Glasgow-based public relations consultancy TMA
Communications, and Societe Europeenne des Satellites, which owns and
operates the Astra satellite system.
It is also pursuing business relationships with British Telecom and
cable company United Artists.
Caledonian Publishing has invested more than #500,000 in
state-of-the-art hardware and software for CIMS, which currently employs
15 people.
Liam Kane, chief executive of Caledonian Publishing, said: ''We
believe that a significant part of any company's future marketing
strategy must lie in the electronic distribution of information, not
just on the Internet, but also using other multimedia devices such as
CD-Rom.
''At CIMS we are blending marketing, editorial and design skills with
the IT (information technology) expertise we have built up in Caledonian
Publishing over the last three years and making that available to the
business community.''
CIMS managing director Jonathan Hart believes the advances being made
in tele-data communications will present major opportunities during the
next few years for companies prepared to seize the initiative.
He said: ''Our intention is to become not just the leading electronic
publisher in Scotland but one of the largest and most profitable
companies in this sector in the UK.''
CIMS, which has already secured lucrative deals with such companies as
Bank of Scotland, does not expect to make a loss in its first year.

THE UN High Commission for Refugees today suspended British aid
convoys travelling through central Bosnia for fear that foreign Islamic
gunmen are hunting down Britons.
The move came only two days after Edinburgh Direct Aid volunteers
passed through the danger zone to deliver essential food and medical
supplies to bombed out hospitals.
It follows an earlier exchange with British soldiers in which a
mujahideen fighter was killed, and the seizure of a group of Norwegian
aid workers by Arabic-speaking gunmen. The Norwegians were blindfolded
and repeatedly asked by their captors if they were British before they
managed to escape.
''They seem to have been looking for Britons. They may be carrying a
grudge. It is alarming,'' said UN spokesman Chris Janowski.
An UNHCR spokesman said the move was not a blanket ban but a
precautionary measure, which today applied to a British fuel convoy
heading for Zenica.
''We are keeping it under constant review in line with the security
advice we receive from Unprofor,'' he added.
The EDA convoy is now on the coast awaiting the arrival of further
supplies which it plans to take to Sarajevo along a route which skirts
mujahideen-controlled territory.
In Split, convoy leader Mr David Reeks said: ''The suspension is news
to us. We travelled down a couple of days ago and there was a perceived
threat then. We were warned by Unprofor but the risk was determined as
low.''
The convoy is taking a total of 80 tonnes of supplies to Bosnia.
''I think this has been the easiest convoy we have had. Nobody is
shooting at us and biggest problem is at Customs, as ever,'' he added.
Mr Reeks said the convoy would have an escort for part of the route
and would make full checks with the UN authorities before it left.

New York
CHINA'S leader today headed for a summit with President Clinton by
issuing an unmistakeable warning that he will brook no meddling on human
rights or Taiwan.
President Jiang Zemin used a speech at the UN to send out his stern
message to ''certain big powers'' -- a clear reference to the US.
It was the latest in a series of signals from Beijing's leaders
suggesting that Clinton is in for a much tougher confrontation than in
yesterday's summit with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin.
Showing once again that it can be thin-skinned as well as hard-headed,
China even rejected the site the White House had chosen for the meeting.
Clinton aides said they had moved the talks from the New York Public
Library to a cultural centre because the Chinese objected to a human
rights exhibit at the library which includes material on the 1989
Tiananmen Square uprising by Chinese dissidents.
Jiang said today he expected to have ''good talks'' with Clinton, but
human rights, ever an open sore in Sino-US relations, was just one of
the issues on which he earlier issued warnings.
''Certain big powers, often under the cover of 'freedom', 'democracy',
and 'human rights', set out to encroach upon the sovereignty of other
countries, interfere in their internal affairs, and undermine their
national unity and ethnic harmony,'' he said in a speech at the UN's
special 50th birthday session.
He also dashed any hopes American diplomats may have had of putting
aside another touchy issue by repeating that Beijing regards Taiwan as a
renegade part of China and resents anyone suggesting otherwise.
''There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable
part of Chinese territory,'' Jiang said. ''The Chinese people have the
ability and resourcefulness and confidence to overcome any interference
and make the reunification of their motherland a reality.''
Although the United States also officially follows a ''one China''
policy, it has to walk a tightrope because of political support for
Taiwan from anti-communist conservatives.
Walking that tightrope landed Clinton in serious trouble with Beijing
last June when he allowed Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui a visa to
attend a reunion at Cornell University in New York.

Sarajevo
BOSNIA'S president said today that his government would never accept a
division of the republic, but the three sides in the conflict looked as
far apart as ever as they prepared for peace talks.
The Croatian Government meanwhile drew angry protests from both
Sarajevo and its own domestic political opposition by allowing 291,000
ethnic Croats in Bosnia to vote in Croatian parliamentary elections on
Sunday.
The Bosnian Government, fearful that Croatia might use the Croat
minority as a spearhead to carve up Bosnia, accused Zagreb of
undermining its sovereignty.
President Alija Izetbegovic, addressing a special UN session to mark
the world body's 50th birthday, said he was hopeful about forthcoming
peace talks in the United States but would reject any outcome that
divides Bosnia.
''The Bosnian Government and army will not accept the division and
disintegration of our country, no matter in what packaging it may be
served,'' he said.
''The division of Bosnia will lead to the continuation of war,
immediately or later.''
Outline peace accords envisage two separate territories in Bosnia, and
many Serbs expect their half to be their own state, in fact if not in
name.
A Bosnian Foreign Ministry spokesman, attacking Zagreb's extension of
the vote to Bosnian Croats, said Sarajevo had agreed to a Croatian
Government request for polling booths to be set up in Bosnia only so
that Croatian citizens could vote.
''It is an ugly move on the Croatian side, trying to undermine Bosnia.
It is very disturbing,'' he said. ''Bosnia must stay a unified sovereign
state.''
Among the Muslim-led government's negotiating demands in peace talks
is one that Croatian troops, who have been fighting with Muslim forces
against the Serbs, must leave Bosnian territory within 30 days of a
final peace agreement.
US President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
announced after talks in New York yesterday that they had agreed to
co-operate in a multi-national force to police a peace agreement in
Bosnia.
However they made clear there was no real progress on overcoming
serious differences on who should lead such a force, with Russia
refusing to let its troops serve under Nato and Washington ruling out a
joint or rotating command.
Clinton admitted that basic differences remained but said US Defence
Secretary William Perry and his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev would
meet this week with orders to seek a compromise allowing Nato and
Russian forces to mesh.
In Washington, US officials said the first Perry-Grachev meeting was
expected to take place at the Pentagon on Friday.
Clinton faces further problems on the peace force from the US
Congress, where representatives from both parties have questioned the
wisdom of sending 20,000 US troops on what could be an open-ended and
hazardous mission.
His task of convincing congress was made no easier by French President
Jacques Chirac, who said yesterday that US troops might have to stay in
Bosnia longer than the one year Clinton has stated.
Asked what would happen if the Americans withdrew the promised troops,
Chirac replied: ''The French will do the same and the British too,''
adding that this would raise the risk of renewed slaughter.
The discord over the composition of the multi-national force of up to
60,000 men had threatened to set back the peace process, which reaches a
climax in a week's time with talks involving the warring parties in
Dayton, Ohio.
The German Cabinet today approved the deployment of around 4000 of its
troops in the multi-national force, the latest step in Germany's gradual
relaxation of the taboo on overseas military action since the Second
World War.
The Bosnian Serbs' negotiating platform for the peace talks includes
demands for the division of Sarajevo and others likely to prove
unacceptable to the Bosnian government.
''We have just pulled down one Berlin Wall. We should not build
another wall now and divide this city at the end of the 20th century,''
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic told Spanish national radio in
Madrid.
In Sarajevo, UN peacekeepers reopened the main western road out of the
city, blocked by Serb forces for more than three years. However a Serb
colonel said that Muslim Sarajevans would not be allowed to use the
route until Serbs could pass freely into the city.--Reuter.

* A STRONG earthquake killed at least 29 people and left 100 injured
in China's densely-populated Yunnan province today as torrential
rainstorms added to the misery of those left homeless.
The early-morning tremor measured 6.5 on the Richter scale and struck
as storms swept the area, making rescue work especially difficult in the
mountain province bordering Burma.
One official estimated that the initial wave of tremors lasted for a
terrifying 15 minutes.
Many people in Wuding and Luquan counties were killed when their
houses collapsed on them. In the provincial capital of Kunming, an
official said some 200 homes had tumbled down on their inhabitants.
Casualty and damage reports were still trickling in from the
hardest-hit area, a rugged but heavily populated zone west of Wuding.
Seismologists counted more than 200 aftershocks, including seven with
Richter readings above four.
''Almost everyone is staying outside and only a few of us are staying
in our offices,'' said an official.--Reuter.

THE director of CBI Scotland, Lex Gold, attended his last full council
meeting yesterday and left it feeling optimistic about future business
prospects north of the Border, writes ROB ROBERTSON.
Mr Gold revealed the latest results of the CBI Scottish Industrial
Trends Survey at a meeting at the Edinburgh headquarters of the Royal
Bank of Scotland.
His work with the CBI was praised by Andrew Cubie, chairman of CBI
Scotland who said it was fitting that for the twelfth survey in a row
Scotland was showing the rest of Britain the way forward.
The study showed that Scottish manufacturers remained optimistic about
future performance, expected market pick-ups in orders, output and
investment over the months ahead.
One interesting factor singled out by the CBI was that firms were
planning to spend noticeably more on new buildings, the first time such
a trend had been identified since 1973.
Although describing the move as ''quiet remarkable'' CBI bosses called
for caution. They believe it may be that in a Scottish context it is the
new electronic factories being built in Scotland which is causing the
upturn and is not part of a wider industrial statement.
They were also pleased that the spend on plant and machinery was
rising for the first time in five years.
Mr Gold said that both rises were good but said people should ''not be
turning cartwheels'' as there were still major concerns for the
construction industry.
Over the coming months, business activity is set to improve. There is
likely to be a marked pick-up in output on the back of buoyant export
growth leaving firms more optimistic about their overall business
situation and export prospects than they were four months ago.
There were increases in costs and prices over the past four months,
though cost pressures are now set to abate. Domestic prices are expected
to rise further over the coming four months though it remained to be
seen whether firms can make them hold as competition remains strong.
Capacity utilisation has declined further with firms expecting to
increase investment in plant and machinery at the quickest rate for over
seven years.
Mr Cubie paid tribute to the work done by Mr Gold who will step down
officially next month. ''He has made an enermous contribution to the
business community in Scotland, particularly CBI Scotland.
''He has raised the profile of CBI Scotland and has raised the profile
of a lot of business issues.''
An announcement on his successor is expected in the middle of next
month.

New York
PALESTINIAN leader Yasser Arafat was asked to leave a concert
celebrating the United Nations' 50th anniversary.
Arafat sat through two movements of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony --
whose ''Ode to Joy'' extols man's brotherhood to man -- and left after
about 30 minutes.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani made it clear last week that Arafat, whose PLO
has no official diplomatic ties with the United States, and Cuban
President Fidel Castro were not welcome at any city-sponsored events
during the celebration.
However Arafat, easily recognisable in his black-and-white headdress,
swept into the Lincoln Centre music hall accompanied by bodyguards
before the New York Philharmonic concert began.
Giuliani instructed chief of staff Randy Mastro to tell him he was not
an invited guest and he should leave. Mastro gave the PLO leader
Giuliani's message before the music began, she said.
''After a while he left as he was asked,'' said mayoral spokeswoman
Colleen Roche. ''There was no ruckus or anything like that.''
Few of the 2000 invited guests, who included dozens of heads of state,
were aware of what had happened.
The State Department, however, objected to Giuliani's decision.
''We don't think this is right,'' spokesman Nicholas Burns said. ''He
is the leader of the Palestinian people. He should be given the respect
the Palestinian people deserve.''
At a news conference today, Giuliani said it did not matter that
Arafat had won the Nobel Peace Prize and had twice been invited to the
White House. He called Arafat a former terrorist who ''never has been
held accountable for the murders that he was involved in'', including
those of dozens of American citizens abroad.
''I don't think we should be unrealistic about who Yasser Arafat is or
what he stands for,'' said Giuliani, who presides over a city with the
US's largest Jewish population.--AP.

A SCOTS-born actor found murdered in his London flat, had various
knives in his body, St Pancras Coroners Court heard yesterday.
Fraserburgh-born Albert Morrice, 71, who lived alone at Dudley Court,
Short Gardens, Covent Garden, had lain dead for some time before
neighbours, who noticed the door was ajar, called police on July 30 this
year.
Mr Hughie Scanlon has appeared at court accused of stabbing Mr
Morrice, and is now awaiting trial at the Old Bailey.
Mr Morrice had been identified to police by a friend, Mr James
Marshall, of Main Street, Broadsea, Fraserburgh.
The dead man has a half-brother, Mr Johnny Morrice, of Damfield Road,
Fraserburgh.
Pathologist Michael Heath gave the cause of death as multiple stab
wounds.
Detective Inspector Duncan Jarrett told the court there were knives
still protruding from Mr Morrice's chest when the body was discovered.
''The door of the premises had been left slightly ajar and neighbours
were concerned they had not seen him for some time.''
The police were called and found his body.
The accused is now on remand awaiting trial and is expected to appear
in court in the new year.
Coroner Stephen Chan adjourned the inquest, pending the outcome of the
criminal proceedings.

ON the 700th anniversary of Scotland's Auld Alliance with France the
European Parliament learned yesterday it is usually better to have the
French as friends rather than foes. Jacques Chirac could be forgiven a
smile of satisfaction as he saw his European critics on the nuclear test
issue suffering something of a meltdown in the long-awaited
confrontation with the European Parliament.
First, Chirac sorted out the European Commission. He did so in several
stages, notably in refusing the commission's experts access to several
important areas in and around the test site in French Polynesia. Without
such access the commission found it difficult to assess the consequences
and dangers of the detonations. He followed this obstruction with a
failure to deliver some important data when asked. The ensuing delay
ensured Europe's best-laid plans were disrupted as the commission in
Brussels became estranged from an impatient parliament in Strasbourg. In
turn, this inter-institutional EU tussle became the focus of the nuclear
dispute, almost eclipsing the continuing explosions in French Polynesia.
In the end, the French succeeded as they almost always do in
international diplomacy and European intrigue in getting their own way,
at least for the time being. Not for nothing do they enjoy their
reputation as world leaders in self-serving political sophistry.
So what now? It is still too soon to say the international effort to
halt the French tests is dead. But it is certainly low in the water
after the latest in a long series of climbdowns by the European
Parliament. After long weeks of French ducking and weaving, the
commission came to the conclusion -- despite much internal bickering --
that France was not breaching the Euratom treaty and, therefore, there
was no cause to pursue Chirac's government in the European Court of
Justice.
This in itself was not surprising, given the reluctance of the most
senior Eurocrats in Brussels to take on the might of the first among
equals in the European Union. So devastating would have been the
consequences of such a legal challenge, especially one which succeeded,
that the EU could have been disabled for months. This does not mean to
say, of course, that the commission was ultimately wrong; just
predictably cautious to a fault. Its findings could yet be challenged by
the parliament and a new chapter written in this saga, although in its
present mood of self-doubt the parliament seems unlikely to allow its
bluff to be called yet again, and so soon.
Chirac's most immediately satisfying achievement is the simmering row
between the commission and the parliament, a happy example of the
dividend payable from dividing and ruling. Commissioners still disagree
among themselves; their unconvincing show of public unity yesterday was
enforced in accordance with practice which demands that decisions are
collegiate. Euro-MPs are similarly divided and even inside the big
socialist group, now smarting from the sneers and sniping of its
opponents, there is bitterness at the apparent reluctance of the
leadership to become embroiled in an attempt to force a legal challenge.
If the socialists had lived up to their press releases Chirac might not
be such a contented man today.
The European Parliament should really grow up. It is one thing to keep
issuing threats of rebellion; it is another to keep backing down with
such regularity in moments of putative self-assertion, especially when
its own sympathisers and supporters -- those who believe in the
continuing democratisation of the European Union -- are left in
frustration.
All this is even more discreditable when world opinion is for once
behind a European institution striving for credibility. Meanwhile,
Chirac can feel free to press the button again as soon as he likes.

TRULY, we are now in desperate times. As one of the saviours of its
electoral prospects the Government has turned to Mr Michael Howard. In
response to a demand for populist policies, on this occasion dealing
with the so-called flood of illegal immigrants (rising, but not
quantifiable, according to a senior Tory), the Home Secretary has
applied his mind to the problem. His solution is to hold employers
responsible for employing illegal immigrants and to ensure they will be
fined if they do so. This measure, leaked at the time of Mrs Gillian
Shephard's principled if short-lived objections, is now back in full
swing. It is expected to sail through full Cabinet tomorrow, even if
some members must grit their teeth, and is set to be one of the most
controversial items in the Queen's Speech. It is also the purest and
most despicable cynicism.
Let us look at the gravity of the issue first of all. There is a
problem with illegal immigrants to Britain, although it is nowhere near
as bad as the Government would have us believe. There are a number of
employers, mostly in inner city areas, who operate sweat shops and who
pay illegal immigrants the lowest possible wages for the dubious
privilege of working in them. If we could be sure that Mr Howard's
proposals were aimed at stamping out these serious offenders we would
support them wholeheartedly as an affirmation of human rights.
Regrettably, the proposals are likely to be nothing of the sort.
Ordinary industry, ranging from the Institute of Directors and the
Confederation of British Industry, to smaller employers in a
multiplicity of industrial sectors, is understandably furious.
Businessmen do not want to act as immigration policemen when faced with
a job applicant and they do not want to be fined for making a genuine
mistake.
If they are angry they have a right to be so. The Government has an
answer to all of this -- it lies in the mystifying concept of a ''light
regulatory touch''. What this means, if it has any serious meaning at
all, is that there could be distinctions made between accidental and
deliberate employment of illegal immigrants and presumably an outlining
of less than onerous checks which employers might be required to make.
What this represents is the worst of all worlds. It will be
understandable if employers, be they large or small, are wearied at the
notion of running identity checks on job applicants with coloured skins
or strange accents. Mostly, they will not bother. Thus will racial
discrimination be institutionalised in Britain by Government decree.
The issue abounds with ironies, intentional and otherwise. The
Institute of Directors speaks angrily of Government abdicating its
responsibility and imposing more burdens on business. This is strange
coming from an organisation which has encouraged the abandonment of
Government responsibility on ideological grounds on a host of different
fronts for nearly two decades. Stranger still is the response by a Home
Office spokeswoman who said plaintively that Britain and Ireland are the
only two countries in the European Union without sanctions on employers
of illegal immigrants. Can this be the despised EU nations being held as
exemplars on an aspect of social policy? Absolutely, as long as it suits
the Government, which ignores conveniently the far more serious problem
of illegal immigrants on continental Europe. Cynicism surrounds us. The
light regulatory touch which was balm to Mrs Shephard's troubled soul
will trouble the innocent but not the wicked.
Bar-room bigots and the darker forces of Toryism will be delighted.
Truly, these are sad and desperate times.

Michael Tumelty applauds a maverick company and its motley crew for
broadening horizons
THEY'VE been called a maverick company. They've attracted an almost
cultish interest for their fearlessly theatrical, distinctly unoperatic
approach to opera. They've been told that their singers can't sing, that
their vocal beauty is variable, and that their pitch is imperfect.
The one thing that Music Theatre London -- making their first visit to
Scotland this week -- haven't been, is ignored. On the face of it, the
company might look like another of the plethora of small or medium-scale
touring opera companies that now regularly visit the Edinburgh Festival
Theatre: companies such as Crystal Clear Opera, Opera of the South,
Mecklenburgh Opera, and so on.
The first hint of unorthodoxy about Music Theatre London -- which
brings performances of Verdi's La Traviata and Mozart's Magic Flute to
the Festival Theatre from tonight -- arises from a glimpse at the
biographies of their singers.
Tim Hardy, for example, who will be singing the Baron in Traviata, and
Sarastro in The Flute, comes to the roles from playing Hotspur in Henry
V, via The Bill and EastEnders. Thomasin Trezise, when not singing her
role as Pamina, can be found playing piano in Tiddly Dolls restaurant in
Mayfair or on the small screen in Soldier, Soldier. Sarah Redmond,
singing Papagena, is more familiar from appearances in Annie Get Your
Gun and The Sound of Music.
Jeremy Rose, singing Tamino, has been seen in La Cage aux Folles and
(as Frank'n'Furter) in The Rocky Horror Show. Andrew C Wadsworth,
singing Germont in Traviata and Papageno in the Flute, regularly appears
in West End productions (Judas in Godspell) and for the National Theatre
(Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls).
Perhaps just a tad closer to the conventional world of opera -- then
again, maybe not -- Robert Millner, who sings Alfredo in the Verdi and
Monostatos in the Mozart, is best known for his provision of what we
might call operatic voice-overs: Pavarotti for Spitting Image and sundry
arias for The Harry Enfield Show. And so on.
By any definition, it sounds like a motley assembly for the
performance of opera. Yet, with such an unlikely casting philosophy --
to say nothing of the performance practice of the company -- Music
Theatre London have, in the three years since they were officially
formed, caused a few seismic rumbles in the operatic world, not least in
Europe where they have appeared to acclaim in Vienna, Hamburg, and
Amsterdam.
Though a young company, the seeds of Music Theatre London were sown 10
years ago at the National Theatre, during a run of Guys and Dolls, when
music director Tony Britten and director Nicholas Broadhurst discussed
the problem they both had with appreciating opera.
''For us there was an alienation factor about theatrical truth,'' said
Britten, librettist, arranger, and co-founder of Music Theatre London.
''We felt there had to be something more to it than singers standing
around a stage; for us there was a huge gulf with these large voices,
large stages, and large orchestras.''
Rather than moan about it, Britten and Broadhurst decided to
experiment. Using members of the Guys and Dolls company, they organised
a workshop on Mozart's Marriage of Figaro. ''The basic premise was to
redefine it by using actors who sing very well,'' said Britten.
''What we were trying to do was to bring the same disciplines to opera
as we brought to Shakespeare or Pinter,'' he said. ''Therefore it has to
be led by the text; therefore it has to be in English; it has to be
modern and colloquial. And it has to be accurate.''
They were so intrigued by the success of the workshop that they
mounted a production of Marriage of Figaro in Croydon. It attracted
attention and quickly transferred to the West End. There it was seen by
Stephan Barbarino, the Intendant of the Kammerspiel in Hamburg.
Barbarino then worked with Britten and Broadhurst on a production of
Don Giovanni. This in turn was seen by one of the dramaturgs of the
Vienna Festival, and an invitation followed to take both Mozart
productions to Vienna for the Mozart bicentenary in 1991. Success
followed success, and in 1992, Music Theatre London was formed and
incorporated.
With all of their productions to date being set in contemporary
Britain, and with characterisation such as the lovers in the MTL version
of Cosi fan Tutte, who sing: ''Life's a bitch, and then you die,'' or a
randy Don Giovanni who sings a hymn to sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll, it
does rather sound as though MTL are out to court controversy.
''The buzz word is that we rewrite operas,'' said Britten. ''That is
totally far from the truth. Our translations are a bit nearer the bone,
nearer the truth, and we may find a metaphor more relevant to today. But
we don't mess with the construction, or even the rhyme scheme.''
The MTL production of La Traviata, which Britten describes as
''minimalist'' concentrates, he said, ''on the intimacy and pungency of
the relationships between the father, the son, and Violetta''.
In The Magic Flute, he said, the production takes a political view. It
has eschewed what Britten calls ''the chocolate-box, pantomime
version''. Equally, it refuses to explore the Freemasonry route. ''There
is no mention of it, visually or verbally.'' As Freemasonry is virtually
a secret society, said Britten, nobody would understand that approach
anyway.
''In fact, the piece is about Utopia and the dangers of Utopian
societies; they become fascistic,'' said Britten. ''Look at Sarastro's
world. Is it a force for good? You have to ask questions about someone
who says that women and blacks are second rate. We're trying to confront
that world.''
MTL confronts that world on an intimate scale. Britten arranged the
scores -- La Traviata for a quintet of piano and strings, The Magic
Flute for an octet. His singers, drawn, he said, from a coterie built up
over the years, are ''basically the top end of people who do musicals''.
Their initial reaction to operatic vocal parts, said Britten, ranges
from curiosity to terror. ''But it's a set of disciplines like anything
else. And it's about people being brave enough to do anything.''
There are, of course, operas that Music Theatre London wouldn't touch,
said Britten. Like Wagner. But he and his collaborator, Nicholas
Broadhurst, do have their eye on a few challenges for the future, such
as Falstaff and -- particularly -- Eugene Onegin: ''a glorious piece,
about real people, real emotions, and real aspirations''.
* Music Theatre London at Edinburgh Festival Theatre: La Traviata,

SARA VILLIERS talks to Jonathan Harvey about life and the changing
tone of his work over the past few years
PLAYWRIGHT Jonathan Harvey, at 27, ponders on the preoccupations of
twenty and thirtythingies: ''Are we a narcissistic generation?''
''No, not particularly.''
Harvey, whose latest drama Rupert Street Lonely Hearts Club, is
currently playing at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow, does agree that our
generation loves nothing so much as seeing our own small-life
experiences projected large scale on stage or screen. He has certainly
addressed this through a series of tightly structured, emotionally
explosive plays which focus on interpersonal dynamics, but he sees such
themes as being less to do with self-obsession and everything to do with
an urgent need for exploration.
''For instance, there are all sorts of new questions about the drug
culture and its effect on our lifestyles,'' says the man who lined up
rows of icing sugar on a mirror for his last play Boom Bang A Bang where
kitsch met cocaine in a caustic urban comedy set against the televisual
experience of the Eurovision Song Contest.
''And, of course, Aids is new to our generation and we have to
investigate that to work out what it is all about. No generation has had
to deal with death in this way before. Sure, older people had the war --
and I don't say that flippantly -- but we are having to deal with the
quite different fact that one night of sex could determine your death.''
So far Harvey's plays have not dealt directly with Aids but his last
four plays have concentrated on depicting gay experiences, from
Beautiful Thing, the exquisitely crafted feelgood story about two
teenage boys' affair, which won him audience and critical approbation
and hep status as the latest bright young thing (he was 24 when he wrote
it, 18 when his first play was produced), to Rupert Street Lonely Hearts
Club via Babies and Boom Bang A Bang.
He's disinterested in the public perception of him -- always
sign-posted as a gay playwright by the mainstream press and viewed with
slight suspicion by the extreme factions of the gay community because of
that mainstream acceptance.
In the past he has said that he didn't want to address the gay members
of the audience at the expense of the elderly ladies out there but he
dismisses this as an off-the-cuff remark. He's certainly well chuffed
that Rupert Street has opened Glasgay!
''It's difficult to say who you are writing for,'' he says. ''I
suppose you are writing for yourself. I guess that's why I do all the
gay stuff, it's about writing something I really wanted to see, and I do
think the best theatre is when you have an audience who can really
identify with what is going on on stage, when you give them honest
writing and honest performances. I'm writing contemporary plays which
are going to appeal to young people more than the blue-rinsed brigade.''
His biting humour and wickedly accurate social observation has brought
constant comparisons with Mike Leigh, with occasional references to
Victoria Wood and Joe Orton, although the middle-class Harvey, fed up
with Another Country type gay imagery, is more concerned with depicting
Britain's underclass than working-class Orton.
He's anything but bland. His work has changed in tone over the past
few years, from the upbeat romance of Beautiful Thing to the
dysfunctional characters of Rupert Street which deals with the strained
relationship between the camp Marti and his defensive, heterosexual
brother Shaun and the various oddbods who drift in and out of Marti's
life.
It's a development which Harvey puts down to simply growing older and
more cynical but he acknowledges that critical cavils at his earlier
rose-tinted outlook -- one reviewer described Beautiful Thing as ''like
smacking on candyfloss, popcorn and bubble gum'' -- probably played a
part.
He pooh-poohs the notion that the awards he has had heaped on his
curly-haired head -- including the 1993 George Devine Award and the 1994
Evening Standard Award for Most Promising Newcomer for Babies and the
1994 John Whiting Award for Beautiful Thing could have brought attendant
pressures.
''No, no,'' he laughs. ''They've just made things easier. Before the
awards I was like Annabel Croft, hitting all the balls out of the court,
but now . . .'' -- he pauses then purrs -- ''I've arrived. I'm Martina
Navratilova.'' When he describes his intention to straddle the worlds of
theatre, television and film and be a generally multi-talented bloke he
trills ''I'm the Judith Chalmers of the writing world.''
He admits that he isn't that keen on spending an evening in the
theatre. ''I only really like going to see my own shows,'' he says
unapologetically. ''I don't really like it when I'm at a dinner party
and someone else speaks. I want all the attention, me, me, me.''
The irony is slight and he gives a rueful laugh. ''Maybe you're right
about this generation, at least, I'm narcissistic. Just get it across
that I'm intelligent . . . and available.''
* Rupert Street Lonely Hearts Club is at The Tron, Glasgow till
Saturday.

IN two successive issues The Herald has published examples of ''the
enemy within'' view of society. First Jack McLean writes of ''degenerate
scum'' (October 20) and the next day we find this description quoted
with approval by the Rev Stewart Lamont.
Long before Mrs Thatcher demonised the miners, whole categories of
people have been identified as being of a lesser breed of humanity
whenever the ''haves'' in society felt the need to adopt draconian
measures.
The victims of the Irish Famine and the Highland Clearances were
categorised as lazy anti-social misfits. Hitler was voted into power by
respectable Christian Germans largely because he was able to exploit the
same blanket lavelling technique and his propagandists used McLean's
exact phrase against more than one group of people.
Stewart Lamont wrote: ''It's like the Nazis all over again -- but with
the terrible difference that today's thugs don't wear swastika
armbands''. In fact of course some of them do, but I find Stewart
Lamont's words ''terrible difference'' difficult to understand.
There has always been an ill-educated underclass all too ready to
resort to brutality and today's variety are no more attractive than
their predecessors, but the answer must be to give them a real
opportunity to become useful and socially responsible citizens.
The siege mentality being developed by the middle classes in the
United States with many districts being fenced off in order to keep out
the ''enemy'' should serve as a warning to us.
The US is adopting more and more draconian measures against its
underclass while blaming all its problems on bleeding-heart liberalism.
Every reduction of our civil liberties which is introduced to combat
social disorder amounts to an admission of our failure to create a
civilised society. There is no easy answer, but they must lie in
education, rather than suppression.

Visual Arts
THIS is an interesting contrast of the colourist works of Tom Watt and
the Nigerian woodcarver Kasali Akangbe. Although some of the carvings
are quite large, the sheer brilliance of Watt's works tend to overshadow
the sculpture. They are powerful and primitive works, however, usually
of gods and the Orise (semi-divine ancestral figures).
Living and working in Osogbo, Nigeria, Akangbe carves for the Osun
shrines and even builds and maintains their roofs. It is startling to
look up from these dark, intense figures to the hot colours and almost
abstract works of Tom Watt. These are a mixture of still life, scenes of
France, Venice and the Amalfi Coast. Watt simplifies subjects, with
shadows becoming strong purple squares, and the complex back canals of
Venice conjured up in streaks and squares of colours.
His best pieces tend to be of water, capturing its essentially
transitory nature. Santa Maria Della Salute is a large work and full of
such contrasts, with the church itself in hazy shadow, balanced against
the strong colours of houses facing it. Between them, in the canal
waters, Watt has managed to capture all the nuances of Venice's allure.

Comedy
BACK on the British stage after a 10-year absence, Mr Shouty last
night demonstrated time has not dimmed his lure. An enraged,
bullet-headed Scouser in a too-tight suit, Alexei chuffing Sayle is the
reason that swearing was bogging well invented.
Forget your new-fangled confessional comedy and your hoity-toity
observational comedy: Alexei's is confrontational comedy. Like he said,
Alexei's a man of his word, and that word begins with the letter B and
ends in ''ollocks''.
Alexei curses. He dances with much energy but like a badly-wrapped
fish supper. He curses some more. His face is that of an infant demon,
often outraged, sometimes blankly innocent, occasionally caught in the
middle of a pained bowel-evacuation. And with these mighty comic weapons
shalt the forceful Alexei intimidate, cajole, and hector an audience
into sharing his world view.
We didn't need much intimidating last night, of course. Alexei's
tirades against fundamentalist Christianity; Phil Collins; Cockney
imperialists; Tory gits; folk who use the word ''workshop'' outwith its
original light-engineering context; and Michael Portillo were readily
appreciated.
Feckless workshy proles copped it, too, Alexei having been one once.
These days, though, he's a master wordsmith with a keen eye for the
absurdities of common parlance. In particular, he gave frightening new
resonances to the phrase: ''Would you like a knob of butter?''
And Alexei gave vent to his lame stand-up alter ego, Bobby Chariot. He
also sang the immortal Ullo John Got A New Motor. Funny? He pigging,
twonking, blumphing well is, pal.

UNLIKE most police forces in this country, the Strathclyde Police's
equal opportunities policy does not cover sexual orientation. Women,
lesbian, gay, and bisexual officers are forced into assimilation with an
outdated, male-dominated, and heterosexist institution.
Police patrolling gay cruising areas around Glasgow to arrest
queer-bashers are only likely to fuel Britain's appalling level of
arrests of gay men, already higher than any other country's in Europe.
What your feature, Lonely targets in hostile city (October 19), failed
to deliver was an insight into the roots of our institutionalised police
and judicial homophobia, a reflection of our society as a whole.
It could have included the biblical redefining of sexuality by the
Victorians that signalled a string of regulations that have been used to
criminalise gay sexuality to the present day: Labouchere's amendment to
the 1885 Criminal Justice Act which defined all homosexual acts as
''grossly indecent'' (this still defines all gay male sexual acts, apart
from buggery, in law today, since a heterosexual cannot commit an act of
gross indecency); the 1967 Sexual Offences Act, adopted in Scotland as
late as 1980, which awarded gay men a controversial special privilege to
indulge in what is -- according to a Government-funded research project
-- the largely straight practice of buggery, defining, as it did, the
concept of privacy for gay men differently from that of straight men,
women, and lesbians.
Other regulations have included the 1986 Public Order Act, introduced
to curb rioters and football hooligans, but used by police to convict
gay men for such ''offences'' as kissing in public; the common-law
offence of ''outraging public decency''; local authority and transport
by-laws; the 1847 Town Police Clauses Act and the 1860 Ecclesiastical
Courts Jurisdiction Act.
It stands to reason that for as long as we treat gay men differently
in society, those seeking friendships, relationships, and sexual
encounters outside the stigmata of homosexuality are likely to do so in
secret.

THE Chancellor of the Exchequer is busy scraping up enough money to
enable him to reduce the basic rate of income tax in time for the next
General Election. It is a sad reflection on British politics that this
is recognised, and accepted, by everyone as an attempt to bribe us to
vote Conservative.
Yet on the occasion of the last fiscal crisis, the only way found to
reduce Government borrowings was to increase the burden of VAT. So with
each downward swing of the financial pendulum, more money is pared off
the poor, and on the upswing it is patted into the pockets of the rich.
It would be almost beautiful in its simplicity, were it not so
disgustingly obscene. The fact that no-one bothers to condemn it -- or
even comment on it -- aggravates the injustice.

TYPICAL of the contemporary police mentality, Donald C Irving can only
regard police efficiency in terms of money in the policeperson's pocket
(October 18). Recent police correspondents within these columns reveal
that he does not stand alone.
It was an aim of the 1960 Royal Commission on the police to raise the
police wage structure out of the overtime reliant occupations, and
clearly the remuneration enjoyed by the police has been at the front of
the public utilities ever since.
As such it has been the envy of teachers and nurses who regard the
police wage as a yardstick in pay negotiations. Nevertheless, the more
police receive the more they beg for despite the absence of a sustained
quality control and a lowered standard of recruitment qualification.
Nowhere was the lack of return for public money seen more startlingly
than when a major, if tragic, sporting occasion to which the public had
unrestricted access at the door was tarnished in the sight of the world
by serious drunken hooliganism.
Not one uniformed policeman was in sight within the forum, not even a
solitary beat constable enjoying his traditional ''doss'' in the back
rows.
Yet a sizeable force in blue was able to rise from comfortable office
chairs from which it had been watching the contest on television and
belatedly attend at the scene.
As a council taxpayer I make no apology for suggesting that far from
being merely a lack of proper police supervision the episode was a
flagrant neglect of basic police duty.
Sir Patrick Sheehy had a clear answer to inefficient policing by
advocating a reduction in supervisory ranks and the introduction of a
differential pay scale which rewarded the diligent officer.
Had his sound advice been accepted it is reasonable to suppose that,
like every boxing promotion that I ever attended, the most attentive
spectators were policemen on duty. Even to stand up was an offence.
There is more to policing than the hype of Operation Eagle in its
several well-publicised forms.

Performance
A BIT of mime, a dash of slapstick, superbly choreographed acrobatics
-- these are the physical elements that shine in this DynamO
performance. What takes this performance into the realm of effective
theatre is the imagination that shapes the movement and uses it to
evoke, without words, the unmapped minefield we know as adolescence.
Four schoolchildren, two boys, two girls, spill on to the stage in
carnival masks and a flurry of party streamers. The soundtrack, which
neatly shades in the shifts in atmosphere, suggests they've been to the
circus. Wherever, whatever, energy simply sparks off them. There's a bit
of horseplay, a taking of sides against the guy who keeps burying
himself in a book, but the bullying never becomes ultra-violent. It's
just high spirits, a need to let off steam.
Watching the quick bodies tumble and spin, you find yourself
recognising all those laughing, shrieking, showing-off teenagers that
cluster at bus stops or yomp through shopping malls. There's all the
typical mating rituals, here translated into bouts of Eurocrash or even
some interesting by-play with rope. The mood is definitely one of
testing the waters, looking for a challenge.
These teenagers, however, aren't in some city centre but gathered near
a rockface that sends out challenges of its own. Clambering, scrabbling,
falling -- they behave as if life is just another game.
Until, like some pantomime gone wrong, the rockface moves and becomes
a rotating slab that tests their equilibrium at every move. As a
metaphor for the tightrope of growing up it is spot on -- as is the
sudden, unthinking slip.
This Canadian-based company really has translated circus skills into
something highly individual, something powerfully dramatic.

THE frequent cry of Tory ministers whenever there is a suggestion that

I have no particular antipathy towards such people as long as their
beliefs and practices are not promoted publicly nor foisted upon the
majority. However I do take exception to large sums of public money
having been voted towards the promotion of the practices of deviant
minorities.
Are we to anticipate that other aberrant groups will be given similar
preferential, and, it seems from your paper's report, discriminatory
treatment, and we can look forward to transvestite tearooms,
paedophiliac parlours, or sadists' soirees; all funded by the region (or

total lack of respect.
There cannot be any place in a civilised society for any employers
such as these paying these totally unacceptable slave wages. It typifies
the Conservative Government's plans for a bargain-basement, low-wage,
low-skill, slave economy.

READERS should beware of some of the hyped claims in the Stirling
Supplement (October 18).
Establishment people like Stirling Initiative, planners, and
enterprise quangos keep up a barrage of talk about people coming first,
consultation, etc. But this is not so. Stirling people do not want
roads, houses, offices, and businesses at Forthside, a critical area
between the station and the historic but neglected river.
Thinking people, and prestigious organisations such as the Civic
Trust, Saltire Society, Scottish Wildlife Trust, Scottish Natural
Heritage, all the community councils, and the Forth River Purification
Board, insist that this unique opportunity be taken to create a central
parkland from the station to the river.
A greenspace central to the town will enhance the attentions of
everyone, including business and trade, will have real quality-of-life
appeal, and give rise to jobs.
The unfettered market economy, initiative and enterprise projects can
ride roughshod over people's environment, heritage, quality of life in
blinkered pursuit of glossy, frequently ill-considered targets.
More buildings and roads are not wanted, and at Forthside the
developments should be for parkland, recreation, green breathing space
to enhance the quality of life, the environment, and the heritage of
historic Stirling's centre.

Hon Editor/Secretary, The Forth Naturalist and Historian,

THE nineties have been making me feel uncomfortable. There's been such
a spate of women doing things: stomping across African deserts, climbing
mountains, canoeing around Cape Horn, and generally showing off
something rotten.
You can't open a magazine without being confronted by an award for
Achiever of the Year, which will be the kind of woman who nonchalantly
runs a high-powered business, co-ordinates charity campaigns, spends
oodles of quality time with her cutesy kids, serves on the local
community council, periodically dashes off a few best-selling novels,
and still finds time to varnish her own floorboards and stencil chic
borders on the restored bedside cabinet she picked up at an antique fair
for a song.
Explaining the secret of her success she will smugly simper: ''It's
all down to time management.''
That's me blown out of the water then. I don't so much manage time as
try to trick it. Anyone who has to set her watch and every clock in the
flat 10 minutes fast in order to have the slightest hope in hell of
making appointments has obviously not grasped the finer nuances of
ordering her day.
Even the supermodels have been at it. Are these girls never happy? Is
it not enough to be 10 feet tall, twiglet thin, breathtakingly gorgeous
and make sacks of money? I would be satisfied with all that and less but
nope, they want more, more, more, satiating their hunger with
achievement orgies. They have to become restauranteurs, write books, and
record pop songs as well. The slight consolation that they are crap at
all these things is outweighed by the overweening envy at the dosh they
make.
Determining to restore my faith in myself I decided to make a list of
all my personal achievements and enlisted the help of my Best Male
Friend. Nothing was springing instantly to mind but I reckoned I was
just being modest. I waited expectantly for him to list all my talents.
He brooded in silence. For a very long time. Finally, a lightbulb went
on over his head.
''You can swim,'' he declared. I lit up like Fergie at the sight of a
cheque from Hello!, nodded vigorously and began scribbling. The BMF
sniggered. ''I was extracting the Michael,'' he said.
The mixture of embarrassment and indignation put me in a bad mood.
''Well, I'm a strong swimmer,'' I huffed. ''I've got my bronze medallion
life-saving certificate.''
He wasn't impressed. ''That'll come in handy when you audition for
Baywatch.''
''Well, I once won a medal for backstroke,'' I retorted, neglecting to
mention it was for an inter-schools competition. I think he guessed. He
pretended to be a man falling off his seat due to a laughing attack.
''Everyone can swim,'' chortled the BMF. ''It's like driving.''
''Not necessarily,'' I muttered, racing off to the loo before a
certain person's lack of a certain piece of pink paper was noted and
hooted over. Not only can I not drive, I haven't even had a lesson,
which is pathetic but not quite as sad as a mate who has had about 200
and still hasn't passed his test.
Stephen and I are much given to defensive statements like ''there are
those who drive and there are those who are driven'' which actually
translates into ''there are those who drive and there are those who have
to memorise public transport timetables, always have the exact change
and get up very early in the morning to catch buses to assignments''.
After much mulling, my list of achievements was seriously
underwhelming. I can read fast which is all very well but isn't really
going to impress anyone until they introduce the 100 page Fay Weldon
Sprint or the Dostoevsky Marathon into the Olympics. I can also dial
phone numbers at great speed, a skill I refined after reading an
interview with Warren Beatty in which, intriguingly, he reckoned his No
1 boast was that he could dial faster than anyone else. ''Oh yeah, we'll
soon see about that,'' I thought, flexing my fingers. Hours of practice
have perfected the technique which involves using more than one digit.
And, necessity being the mother of invention, I can put on eye-liner
in the backseat of a taxi without the aid of a mirror. ''I can believe
that,'' said the BMF with enough of a smirk to send me racing back into
the ladies to check for smudges.
But I'm not tri-lingual, I can't play backgammon, and I think musical
instruments are, well, pretty to look at. I haven't done a course in
aromatherapy, massage, or furniture restoration as various friends have.
The BMF, for instance, is hot stuff at graphology. I can rollerblade but
it's only a pose and I'm only just good enough not to fall down which is
actually not very good at all.
Just what have I been doing with all my spare time apart from getting
good at things you can't boast about in polite company? Not so much a
sign of a misspent youth as a misspent growing-up, too much time
dribbled away trying to blow the perfect smoke ring and succeeding only
in creating the equivalent of a Jackson Pollock painting.
When I was young I was achievement obsessed; I swam, ran, played
volleyball, basketball and did subaqua and athletics. I could play a
variety of brass instruments and could knit anything except a boyfriend.
I even won a Blue Peter badge for Drawing a Famous Person (Lindsay
Wagner, The Bionic Woman -- now there was a high achiever). Then I went
to university, fell into wicked ways and aspired to new achievements --
bad haircuts, borrowing money, and drinking Tequila Slammers without
falling over.
However, I do have one gift, an overactive imagination. I intend to
put it to good use. I shall dream up a few achievements without putting
in the hours. I reckon I too could be an expert orienteer, shiatsu
practitioner, accomplished amateur dressmaker -- ''Mmm, yes, it is an
exact replica of the latest line from Next,'' -- and didgeridoo player.
All it takes is a tall tongue.

THIS week the Scottish Secretary is off to Brussels, on our behalf and
at our expense -- as David Frost used to say about Supermac's
international diplomacy.
In a rare rhetorical flourish at the Scottish Grand Committee on
Monday, the bold Michael told us he would be the first Scottish
Secretary to represent Scotland at a fisheries council since the days of
Lord Younger.
This apparent sideswipe at his two immediate predecessors turned out
not to be entirely accurate since Malcolm Rifkind did actually manage
along to one in December 1989.
However, it does tell us that the Scottish Secretary's keen sense of
public relations has led him to the conclusion it is very difficult to
claim Scotland has any role in Europe under current arrangements.
The Scottish Office ministerial team have a rate of absenteeism from
European Council meetings which make Labour MPs attendance at the
Constitutional Convention look like a model of diligence.
In the period from April 1994 to July this year, Scottish Office
Ministers attended a grand total of 10 meetings out of more than 125 of
the European Council and more than half of these were on fisheries. All
were attended in a junior capacity to UK ministers.
Unfortunately for Michael's presentation of himself as Scotland's man
in Europe, English fisheries minister Tony Baldry asserted his right to
lead the delegation in the Commons on Monday and described Michael's
role as a strictly supporting act.
Indeed, he gave the distinct impression he didn't expect the Scottish
Secretary to do very much at all at the European meeting which is hardly
surprising since he has spent the last few months carving up a deal
which is already done.
Now all of this presents some interesting questions which go beyond
ministerial protocol, although it is a bit of a humiliation for a
Cabinet Minister to have to play second fiddle to a junior colleague.
One of my predecessors as MP for Aberdeenshire used to dismiss the
post of Scottish Secretary as the ''scullery maid of the cabinet'', but
even Bob Boothby didn't envisage a Secretary of State acting in that
capacity for other more junior ministers.
The substantial point, however, is what it betrays about Scotland's
status in Europe within the state of the United Kingdom. There can be
only one view put forward on behalf of the United Kingdom at the Council
of Ministers. That view will inevitably be the prevailing one from south
of the border.
Of all subjects, fisheries is the one with which you might expect the
Scottish view to have some degree of clout. The Scottish Minister
represents as big an industry as his English counterpart and one which
is some 10 times as important to the Scottish economy as to the UK as a
whole.
And yet over the years there have been countless examples of the view
of English Ministers prevailing. John Gummer famously brushed aside
Scottish Office pleas for the industry and resisted the vitally
important decommissioning scheme for many years.
The Fisheries Council on Thursday is making provision for the
regulation of Spanish access to western waters. This access was
accelerated by six years because of a deal between the UK and the
Spanish Government to allow the Spanish to breach the terms of their own
Treaty of Accession.
The reasons for that disastrous deal have never been entirely clear
but what is certain is the interests of the fishing industry were not
paramount and neither were the views of Scottish Office Ministers.
Even at Thursday's meeting, the overwhelming interests of the Scottish
industry in keeping tabs on the catches of Spanish boats will be
subordinated to the natural desire of English fishermen to avoid similar
regulation in French and other waters.
If the Scottish view cannot prevail on fishing, how much less
important will it be on the many other areas of policy where the
Scottish interest is of less weight.
Nor would this position be altered by a Scottish Assembly of the kind
proposed by Labour. In the 12 lines devoted to Scotland's European role
by the Constitutional Convention it cheerfully ignores the fact that
only member states have access as of right to the Council of Ministers
and in the case of disagreement between Scotland and London the
Westminster view will prevail.
Are we expected to seriously believe that if a Scottish Assembly had
been in existence in 1991 John Major would have deferred to its wishes
and reversed his stance on the opt out from the social chapter?
Nor does Labour's promise of a beefed up lobbying office amount to
much. There are already 10,000 lobbyists in Brussels including the
European Association of Aerosol Manufacturers.
All in all, the Scottish Secretary's jaunt to Brussels may end up
fulfilling a service to the Scottish people, albeit not the one which he
intended. It makes it clear that when it comes to counting in Europe it
is member states who have the clout and if Scotland wants to count there
is no substistute for working towards that status.
Scotland's leading modern historian has termed Scotland ''Europe's
invisible nation''. If we are to become visible then what is required is
not a day trip from the Scottish Secretary but a much longer term stay
from an independent Scotland.

NONE OF the obituaries got around to mentioning it -- euphemisms are
low-rent piety -- but Sir Kingsley Amis was a creep. In his public
persona at least, this sketch of a suburban snob, with his Garrick Club
tie and his Daily Mail mind, his moral cowardice and his maiming
cruelty, was effortlessly odious.
Does it matter? Wasn't Amis a ''comic genius'', a ''master prose
stylist'', the plain-speaking voice of Middle England? If he was, it
does.
It's an odd fact, but none of suburbia's favourite literary sons have
had much to recommend them as people. Waugh, Wodehouse, Betjeman,
Larkin, Amis: the chaps who wrote proper English books and real English
verses, with a decent laugh, a good story, and rhymes reliable as the
sonorous beat of old lawmowers on dull Sunday afternoons. These were not
an appetising bunch.
None much cared for the living world, whatever it happened to be on
any given day. Betjeman's puerile nostalgia for Edwardian England was
the mirror of his addiction to limp Edwardian prosody. Waugh, curator of
Catholic reaction, at least did the human race the courtesy of loathing
himself as much as he loathed anyone else who lacked a title.
Furtive Larkin, with his dirty mags and his dirty mac, his hatred of
''abroad'' and his provincial racism, kept English verse in the closet
for decades. Wodehouse was his own fiction, meanwhile, calculating and
emetically cute, no proper traitor but the sort who could persuade
himself the Second World War was some other bod's affair.
Yet each of these, now joined by Amis, is celebrated as an embodiment
of English values. This would be depressing, save that few among their
multitude of admirers seem to notice, far less to mind. In this, England
is at ease with itself.
Granted, even his admirers admit that Sir Kinglsey was heartless, in
life and in fiction, that he despised anything modern just because it
was new, that his drunken political enthusiasms would have bored an
empty saloon bar, that he was invincibly parochial (try asking an
American or a European about his standing as a writer), that he grew to
hate and fear women. But these aspects of his mind and art are thought
not to matter.
No one requires artists to be admirable, of course. Nevertheless, it
is striking that the writers who have appealed most directly to
England's sense of itself since the Great War have seemed to symbolise
England's decline -- reactionary, nostalgic, class-ridden, seedy, and
dull.
Amis the writer? After the one about the bloke (the Bloke of Blokes)
at the provincial university, Sir Kingsley wrote the same three books
several times over and fleshed out his contracts with bank jobs passed
off as genre fiction. If the halitosis of his memoirs -- the whiff of
something gamey, the vigour of the maggot -- is something that makes you
laugh, you probably don't believe Larkin meant all that stuff about
''niggers''.
Amis never hit a difficult target in his life, but with the silent
majority of the middlebrow as his jury he was always given the benefit
of the doubt. His prose reeks of linguistic squalor, of lazy
constructions, 50s slang, caricature got up as characterisation,
moralising passed off as moral judgement, of low, vindictive farce
retailed as corruscating wit. The language was the man, or so even he
affected to believe.
But if art is any sort of mirror we can learn something from the old
buffer, bluffer and serial self-plugger. It's not his Anglo-Saxon
attitudes that matter so much, nor even those of his literary kin, but
the fact that their wit and wisdom are admired, praised, even loved.
These men had the common touch, the authentic voice. Each rose from what
the taxonomists of social distinction would call the lower middle class
-- and invariably each despised (hence the satires) the sort of lower
middle class people who read their books.
What did Sir Kingsley tell himself? Speak for England? Despise the
foreign, rubbish the experts, damn love and liberals, and lefties, and
girlies, and proles? Speak for an England that never was, revel in your
performance, and still have time for a snort or two at the club.
They'll be there now, the chaps. Betjeman in his boater and Larkin in
his library; the knighted yeoman novelist with his paragraphs of oak;
Wodehouse with his secret terrors and Waugh blubbing over a rent-boy
infatuation with languorous aristocracy.
Icons of English letters at the 20th century's end. All that remains,
in fact. It's what they call a heritage.

MY departure from New York last weekend was generously marked by an
American diplomat of my acquaintance who took me with a party of family
and friends out to one of the city's top restaurants, the Cafe des
Artistes, just off Central Park West.
On a Saturday night it was overcrowded and the table we got was hardly
a good one. But it is quite a fine old place, in Art Deco style, and I
settled down to peruse the hearty menu. I selected a veal chop.
''And how would you like your veal, sir?'' inquired the waitress.
Somewhat surprised, I answered that I wanted it done, since there is
no virtue in veal served any other way.
''You mean well done?'' she asked. No, I said, in irritation at having
to repeat a clear instruction, I wanted it just done, cooked all the way
through.
At this point my host muddied the waters with a well-meaning
explanation of the difference in European and American conceptions of
when meat is done, the latter tending to the frazzled.
''Look,'' I said, ''I fear this is going to be a disaster however I
express myself, so I'll just change my order, and have the lamb chops
instead.''
''And you wish them well done?'' ventured a by now thoroughly bemused
waitress. It was hard to prevent myself shouting.
''No! Veal should always be done, lamb should always be underdone. And
I want my lamb underdone -- pink, bloody,'' I added brutally, in case
she had not yet got it.
When they came up the chops were, needless to say, well done, and I
had to send them back again.
Amid all the abundance of the New World, even amid the high
sophistication of midtown Manhattan, Americans still do not understand
food.
Compared to the ordered classicism of the European gastronomic ritual,
their own tastes are baroque to the point of being uncouth. Syrup with
bacon, jelly with salad, a glass of milk with your roast beef -- well,
why not? This is the land of the free.
Worse still is the tendency, to be observed from staying with American
families, for them to abandon the custom of sitting down every evening
and dining together.
Their individual members, all furiously busy and energetic, come in at
different times and just fix themselves something from the fridge or
call out for fast food.
The TV dinner requires no manners, nor even a table. It reveals a
purely utilitaritan attitude to nourishment: it has to be taken to keep
going, but is not pleasurable or interesting beyond that.
Reduced to a physical function with no value of its own, nourishment
is ripe for subordination to other imperatives, in particular to the
Americans' terrible obsession with freeing themselves from guilt.
It is a burden they have imposed on themselves since the beginning of
their nation in order to mark its exceptionalism, but it has grown more
intense as history has shown them they are no better and no worse than
the rest of us.
Deep down, all the same, they wish this were not so.
A new outlet for their obsession, now that previous ones are closed
off, is their concern with the environment and with the destruction of
animal life. Whereas in the past many of them gorged thmselves out of
guilt, and some do yet, many more of them today starve themselves out of
guilt.
The avoidance of meat, fat, alcohol, the consumption of tofu, arugula,
mineral water, are a way of feeling purer, holier than thou, more
American. Caught up with the imperatives of Americanism, it goes to
unreasonable lengths.
It thus leads to plenty of physical anorexia, but it also leads to
what might be called spiritual anorexia too. And since concern with the
environment and with the destruction of animal life are by no means
confined to Americans, this is not something we should look on with
complacency.
Animals feed, while humans eat. The difference is that we are rational
and moral beings, so that nourishment is never for us what it is for
other creatures.
A rational and moral being nourishes himself not just from the food,
but from the taste, manners, conversation and hospitality that surround
it. He is gratified less from the filling of his stomach than from the
sight of the meal, the table, the companions, and the guests all dressed
for a kind of ceremony.
Without blasphemy, the phenomenon could almost be called religious,
and it is surely no accident that so many religious rites, including
communion, involve the eating of a sacrifice.
In any case, there is still a human meaning. Our eating is motivated
not so much by need as by our delight in our own powers, to rearrange
nature and to experiment with it.
While we eat almost everything we also forbid ourselves to eat, on
grounds of law, morality, and taste. Yet the less we eat, and the cruder
the rules by which we eat, the more we impoverish ourselves: anorexic
not just in body but also in spirit.
Another meal, memorable for the wrong reasons, that I had during my
trip was with the distinguished American historian, Gordon Wood, author
of the prize-winning classics, The Creation of the American Republic and
The Radicalism of the American Revolution.
He is of stock as old as any in the land, a genuine Yankee from among
the original farmers of Massachusetts who defeated the British Empire.
While I stuck fastidiously to filet mignon, he chose a bacon and blue
cheese burger.
We discussed why Scottish philosophers of the eighteenth-century had
been so hostile to the American revolutionaries. I said it was because
they thought a people which abandoned the standards of the Old World
would sink into barbarism.
''They were right,'' he replied, as he demolished with relish his pile
of fries.

JOHN Muir's short descriptive account of a chance meeting with Mono
Indians in the Sierra Nevada is a shallow foundation for Jim Hunter to
build a hypothesis on and upon which to base his serious charge of
racism against Muir (October 16).
As a scientist I should prefer to take note of all the evidence,
including the long accounts of Muir's expeditions in the company of the
coastal Indians with whom he had ''never felt more at home'' and from
whom he parted ''with much handshaking . . . and assurances of eternal
friendship''.
However, what is beyond doubt is that Muir made a massive contribution
to the way in which people of his own race and of many other races
around the world developed their understanding of the natural world in
which we all live. In this regard he was a truly inspirational figure.
Apart from the charge of racism against Muir, Jim Hunter's book, On
the Other Side of Sorrow, is enthusiastically welcomed as it addresses
the very serious question of the Scottish Highlands, the Highland
people, and their relationship with wild places.
If in being provocative he can progress the debate on this
relationship, then that is all to the good. We need to be reminded again
and again of the intense cultural relationship which our forebears had
with the natural world and its relevance for us today.
It is true that some conservationists and their employing bodies do
disregard local people in a single-minded pursuit of natural heritage
objectives, to the detriment of all. However, this is not the case with
the John Muir Trust which, in its approach to practical management of
the lands it is involved with in the Highlands and Islands, owes as much
to Fraser Darling as to John Muir.
Local communities play a major part in the management of these lands
and not only is this active participation welcomed, it is also seen as a
vitally important component in our efforts to achieve our objectives;
and there is no fundamental problem in accommodating the claims of local
people.
From the very outset the trust has had within its stated objectives a
clear commitment to the needs and aspirations of local people.
No-one with any sensitivity can be involved in land management issues
in the Highlands of Scotland and remain unaware of the close,
indivisible bond between our culture, local communities, and the wilder
areas of our country. People have always been a part of the whole
Highland scene, including those remoter parts now depopulated.
Without this awareness, a commitment to rehabilitation and the need to
put right those things which, over several centuries, have gone so
desperately wrong, a great deal of conservation effort is meaningless
and ineffective.
In reality the aspirations of crofting communities and of conservation
have much in common and these interests are converging and benefit from
close co-operation and mutual understanding.
I think we are in greater danger from dogmatists on either side of the
debate than from supposed racists of some past generation. A careful,
long-term, and listening approach in a positive partnership is what is
needed to achieve real benefits for our natural heritage, for our local
communities and for our rich cultural heritage.

The good, the bad and the ugly were paraded at London Fashion Week
and, according to John Davidson, there was not nearly enough of the
good. Here he gives a critical appraisal of the shows including that of
the designer whose bottom line was something completely different.
SHE'S back. After countless seasons' absence, Katharine Hamnett has
returned to London with a prime (first evening) slot in the calendar of
London Fashion Week shows held in specially constructed tents outside
the Natural History Museum. Before we go any further, I would like to
say how wonderful it is to have her show once more in London, and report
that it marked a spectacular return to form.
I really would like to -- only I cannot. I absolutely cannot.
For in contrast to the strength of her menswear line, the womenswear
was memorable only as a tedious parade of indifferent sparkly dresses.
The show opened with a sequence of royal blue and black leather
separates. Wow! How eighties! Later we endured variations in tan and
black. Wow! Recycled luggage!
How clever that despite Hamnett's manufacturing arrangement with a
leading Italian producer, the clothes on the runway all had that
remarkable look of being homemade, with quite possibly no tools more
sophisticated than fork and knife.
It is a total insult for any established name to present such a
hopeless show. And quite the biggest disappointment of this year's
London Fashion Week. Hamnett should be detained indefinitely by the
fashion police.
Edina Ronay had obviously decided that her clothes needed a little
enlivenment for the runway. Enter the stylist from hell responsible for
turning her presentation into 25 minutes of disco torture. Sometimes a
little vulgarity can be quite amusing in a fashion world which takes
itself all too seriously. But this was a full-scale offensive in
relentlessly bad taste.
Ghastly music, ghastly hair and make-up, ghastly little ankle boots .
. . and thoroughly ghastly clothes. One-shouldered tops and dresses came
in a variety of cheap-looking shiny man-made fabrics. Eighties revival,
perhaps? It was Bladerunner merged with Spandau Ballet. This was quite a
departure for a designer whose reputation was established on perfectly
lovely hand-knitted sweaters.
So what was good in London? Fashion's mood of the moment for fresh
simple real clothes seemed well-served by Margaret Howell's perfectly
lovely collection. Refreshing too were the clean lines of Nicholas
Knightly's back-buttoning tops and jersey dresses in navy, white, and
daffodil yellow.
Young design duo, Clements Ribeiro showed their unfussy collection in
the sumptuous surroundings of the Brazilian Embassy in Mayfair. Amid all
the gilt and gleam, models appeared wearing utterly unadorned
shirtwaisters and dead simple separates in two-tone checks, chintzy
florals, and the pure brilliant white which is everyone's forecast for
next spring. But memories of the London shows are, well, coloured. In
fact even Nicole Farhi eschewed her favourite shades of porridge for
pretty flower-bed hues.
Prints are big news from London, especially the intriguing varieties
of artful two-tone squiggles which were scrawled across Ben de Lisi's
simple evening dresses or ran almost tiger-like over Amanda Wakeley's
halterneck gowns. Biro doodles decorated the jersey shirtwaisters in
which Red or Dead clothed their greatly publicised vision of
post-apocalyptic psycho-housewives.
Squiggle prints were also a strong statement within Sonnentag
Mulligan's post-modern arty farty clothing. But here, too, a mad stylist
had been engaged to ensure that the collection looked a whole lot less
lovely on the runway than hanging in the showroom.
Models' heads were bandaged in burgundy satin ribbons. Grey tights
were pulled right up into that midriff gap between cropped tops and
hipster bottoms. And having feared that the show audience might not
notice the recurring handkerchief theme (bustiers and dresses formed
from hankie-like squares of fabric tied at the back), hankies sprouted
from just about every orifice.
The European hankie mountain was just about exhausted by the halfway
point in the show. Everything then came with a freshly cut yellow rose
-- just in case we didn't realise that the designers consider yellow the
perfect accent colour for their beige, black, burgundy and
greyed-lavender palette.
London is still the place which breeds really furious, dangerous
talent . . . talent like Alexander McQueen, who is a mass of creative
energy and destructive tendencies. His show on Monday evening featured
some fairly regular-looking clothing -- jackets which actually looked
like jackets, alongside McQueen staples like his infamous bumster
trousers, now unseamed from knee to crotch.
For all the confrontational ugliness of his subversive, fashion-nasty
work, McQueen makes compelling viewing. Which is exactly why his show
was one of the week's hottest tickets. But can his creative energy be
harnessed to devise a new language of style for the next millennium? Or
is he simply the Darth Vader of London fashion?
McQueen had his own answer. Those of his models who had already
saluted front-row journalists with two (sometimes only one) fingers
hinted at what this might be. But, having ambled down the runway to
accept an enthusiastic ovation, McQueen dropped his trousers and wiggled
his large white bottom towards astonished photographers.
The ladies and gentlemen of the fashion pack are dedicated to a
relentless search for something which they have never previously seen.
McQueen offered them a disconcerting, brimming eyeful.

WE hear there is a chap in Glasgow who specialises in writing scripts
for beggars. A quick consultation with this spin doctor of the
panhandling world can be quite lucrative for those who make a living
from the better nature of the public.
An example was encountered in Ashton Lane in the bistro quartier of
the West End. A distraught young woman tugged pitifully at the sleeve of
a chap making his way with wife for a spot of supper in one of the
watering holes.
Her story was that her husband was a paranoid schizophrenic who should
have been in a locked ward but had been released because of cutbacks in
the health service. (Always a good line, the NHS cutbacks, with the
right-on West End audience.) Now he was out looking for her and their
baby daughter and she was afraid he might do violence to her and the
wean. Could he possibly spare a couple of pounds for the bus fare to get
to the womens' refuge?
Our man was impressed, not to mention astounded at her plight, and
handed over a couple of quid. His wife was less impressed. ''Did you not
spot the make-up she had on to make her look pale and drawn?'' she
asked.
Better a couple of pounds wasted than the possibility of a woman and
child being abused, he said. But he changed his mind a few days later
when he saw the same woman, complete with pale and drawn make-up,
telling a concerned passer-by all about her man who was a paranoid
schizophrenic and could he spare a couple of pounds to save her life and
that of their baby daughter.
Any other great panhandling scenarios you have encountered should be
sent straight to the Diary. But we're not begging, you understand.
Flying the flag
FOR those who are all at sea when it comes to choosing Christmas
presents, may we recommend an item in the Shipshape and Marine Leisure
catalogue. Their ''ultra-cosy'' cotton nightshirts are embossed with
genuine naval flag signals. The range so far includes flags which mean
''I'll keep close to you during the night'' and ''I request your
permission to lie alongside''.
We feel the manufacturers have missed out on some other flags which
feature in the international code of signals in Reed's Nauitcal Almanac.
Like the one with yellow and blue stripes which means: ''Keep clear of
me. I am manouvering with difficulty.''Or:
* The blue and white stripes: ''I am on fire and have dangerous cargo
on board, keep well clear of me.''
* The red, white, and blue tricolour which warns: ''Keep clear of me.
I am involved in pair trawling.''
* The blue cross on a white background, ideal for a partner with a
headache: ''Stop carrying out your intentions and watch for my
signals.''
To which the only reply is the white flag with blue square: ''I am
operating astern propulsion.''
A rag to relish
WE read in a student newspaper of the accommodation plight of the
young people currently attending our yoonies. So niggardly are the
Government grants and so expensive the cost of rooms that the flower of
our intellect are living in tents, sleeping bags in shop doorways, and
bin shelters.
We are filled with righteous indignation. At least we were until we
read on and realised that the publication in question, by the name of
Chutney, is a superb spoof of adult journalism as it is practised in the
tabloids that pass for the British press.
A student interviewed about his life living in a bin says: '' A bit
disappointed. Years of watching Top Cat had led me to believe that your
average bin had a telephone, tea-making facilities, and enough room for
Choo-Choo and Benny the Ball.''
Chutney offers ''10 top tips to stay sexy and live in a bin''. And
about living in a tent in Kelvingrove Park, it says: ''Comfort -- plenty
of room for leggy blondes. Have a few mates round. Drag a sheep in
even.''
It is all so different from our days when it was all about wearing
long silly yoonie scarves, drinking yards of ale, and worrying about how
on earth you were going to spend all of your grant and your parental
contribution before the end of term.
Not that these days have totally gone. Chutney asks: ''Surely there's
some tradition left?'' And answers: ''There is. The Beer Bar at Glasgow
Uni still allows young students to drink pints of baked beans and shove
ball points up their jap's eye to write their names on beer mats.'' We
confess to being puzzled about that last bit. We don't remember too many
Japanese students in our day.
Some things remain eternal. In the Lonely Hearts section we find:
''I'm desperate, female, young and sexy! If you do not grunt, fart,
drink excessive amounts of beer, talk about shagging, play rugby, have
orgasms about Partick Thistle, wear anoraks or use Lynx aftershave and
if you love your mother and look like Armand Assante get in touch.''
We feel that she may be wasting her time hanging around the student
union.
Folk with a twist
A MUSICIAN of the Diary's acquaintance, Ricky Manning the pied piper
of Priesthill, has returned after working various gigs, as they are
called, in Scandinavia. He shows us a souvenir of a folk night at which
he performed in Stockholm.
It is a piece of paper as handed to him by a lady called Lotta
requesting some of her favourite traditional folk music numbers. They
include Wide Clover, Tiskey in the Ware, and Cockels and Mushrooms.
That's cockels and mushrooms as in alive, alive, alive-o.

SUE FROST, agony aunt at Woman magazine for the past seven years,
describes the reality that sitcom scripts fail to encompass.
WE HAVE finally said goodbye to TV sitcom agony aunt Jane Lucas, and I
for one, wasn't sorry. Not only was Agony Again a creaky vehicle for the
supremely talented Maureen Lipman, but it failed to do any kind of
justice to the life and times of an agony aunt.
Somewhere in there is a great story, an enormous wealth of material,
struggling to find expression. Often sad, frequently tragic, the agony
business is also very funny. Just the right sort of stuff for a
high-class TV series, in fact. What a pity it's been squandered on the
anodyne Agony Again.
And yet there was one respect in which Agony Again almost got it
right. The humour in the life of an agony aunt comes not from any
dilemma a reader might present. No problem is ever funny, for the simple
reason that it's serious enough for someone to have written it down.
What's amusing is the frequent clash between the calm, well-ordered
advice of the agony aunt on the page, and the frenetic lives led by
high-profile journalists.
In the Jane Lucas version of agony aunting, the gap between public
persona and private reality came in the form of a gay son, a married
lover, and a batty mother.
A few real agony aunts may indeed have some, it not all, these
challenges to contend with, but for most of us it's rather more basic,
and perhaps, more daunting. How to do justice to the hundreds of
heart-breaking letters that arrive on our desks every week, how to cope
in personal terms with the pain and despair they reveal, how to keep on
top of the vast amount of literature that floods into our offices,
offering new theories, new remedies, new solutions, for just about every
problem known to womankind . . .
All this has to be done, as far as the public image is concerned,
without any hint of strain. No rows with your partner because, after a
day spent answering your readers' letters, you've mysteriously gone off
men . . . No shouting at the kids because you can't find an address for
the Bereaved Budgie Owners Association . . . No kicking the dog because
it chewed up your contraception leaflets. The agony aunt must be in
control at all times, and therein lies the humour.
The day-to-day reality of the job is far from humorous. I'm often
asked what subjects feature most frequently in my postbag. Top of the
list would have to be infidelity and the anguish it causes, closely
followed by sexual problems, family breakdown and its effects upon
children, childhood abuse, domestic violence, alcoholic partners,
loneliness, depression, anxiety and loss of confidence.
People pour out their hearts to agony aunts, and it's a great
privilege to receive their letters, but also a great responsibility.
Somehow you have to offer comfort and hope without making light of the
very real problems people face or pretending there's a simple solution.
Indeed, sometimes you have to accept that there's no solution at all.
But if there's no solution, then there's almost certainly something
you can do to ease the pain. The agony aunt who doesn't believe this,
who doesn't strive to find a positive in the most bleak situation, is
failing her readers. There must be someone who can help, some support
group who will advise, some prospect that life will improve. It's the
agony aunt's job to find this, and point it out.
Which brings me to another frequently-posed question: Who am I to
counsel other people, to tell them how to run their lives or advise them
on where they're going wrong?
The answer I give is that the question is mistaken. No agony aunt I
know claims any special quality or qualifications, and I doubt whether
any of us sees it as her job to tell people what to do.
Instead, the agony aunt can become the concerned, objective outsider
who gives a considered opinion based on the available facts. Unlike your
family or friends, who know you and the others involved in your problem,
she's got nothing to lose by telling the truth.
And best of all, you can reject what she says if you don't like it!
That's hard to do when relatives or friends are advising, and even
harder, I suspect, if you're having professional counselling or therapy.
In the end, whatever anyone else says, it's your life and you're going
to have to make the crucial decisions yourself. The agony aunt, whom
you'll never have to meet, never have to answer to, may just be the one
to help you do it, if only by default.
But isn't it only desperate, inadequate people who write to agony
aunts? Women who've got no-one else to turn to, and no resources of
their own? The answer to this one is a straightforward No. The vast
majority of the women who write to me are literate, articulate, witty
and wise.
They often have considerable insight into their problem, and it's
quite common to find they've sorted it themselves, or at least see what
they have to do, by the time they reach the last paragraph. Writing is
deeply therapeutic, much more so, I believe, than talking. The agony
aunt is the recipient of this do-it-yourself therapy, a sounding board
who'll never tell another soul that you've written to her.
All this applies to the people who write in privately to my magazine,
enclosing an sae for reply. Quite often they don't want their letters
printed, a request which is always respected.
The agony page in the magazine is something else. This is the
distilled essence of a week's problems, usually featuring short,
anonymous letters which are sent in specifically for publication. The
advice which appears with them also comes in concentrated form, sharp,
to the point, no messing. This is journalism after all, and an agony
page must be entertaining as well as informative.
We're working writers, some of us a little larger than life, with
strong views, hectic schedules and the same everyday problems as anyone
else. We believe in what we're doing but at the same time we can laugh
at ourselves. Sometimes we get it wrong, and sometimes we're set up by
other journalists. That's life in the agony game.
We're in the business of shaping opinions as well as giving advice, of
advancing, just a little, the level of understanding between the sexes,
and, most crucially, of encouraging women to stand up for themselves.
The work is important, it's rewarding, and sometimes, believe it or
not, it's actually fun.
TV producers, please take note.

PEOPLE living in Scotland have an unprecedented fear of crime, it was
revealed in a survey published yesterday.
It stated that 94% of the poll in Scotland were concerned with the
level of crime in Britain. While 58% feared being burgled, 47% were
scared of being mugged in the street.
The survey, which used a sample of 192 people in Scotland, was
conducted by General Accident and Gallup, and was part of a similar poll
for the whole of Britain.
Other findings for Scotland were that 77% of people felt there should
be more police on the beat.
Questions on home security showed that 23% of respondents had
installed electronic security systems or alarms, 64% had fitted window
locks, 39% had outside security lights, and 19% had a guard dog.
Of those polled, 67% felt police were responsible for preventing
burglaries in their area, while 80% felt responsibility lay with
residents.
Neighbourhood watch schemes proved popular, with 40% suggesting more
watch schemes would reduce crime, while only 28% said closed-circuit
television would help to reduce it.
The survey was published as 600 neighbourhood watch co-ordinators from
thousands of households in Scotland met to discuss how fear of crime
could be reduced and the growing problem of youth crime.
The first of three meetings sponsored by General Accident was held in
Edinburgh last night. The second will be held in Perth tonight and the
third in Glasgow on Friday.
At the Edinburgh meeting, Mr Andrew Brown, assistant chief constable
of Lothian and Borders, said the police recognised that fear of crime
was a problem in itself.
However, recent figures showed that the level of crime was falling. It
was less than in 1984 and in 1991, as statistics demonstrated.
Mr Brown said police were taking a number of initiatives to reduce
crime. He praised neighbourhood watch schemes and victim support groups
for the contribution they had made.

Jennifer Cunningham assesses employment statistics for Scottish women
and discovers few are climbing beyond the bottom levels of the workplace
ladder.
FOR the third year, women in Scotland have been counted and found to
be in the bottom half of the heap. While 52% of Scotland's population is
female, they still hold less than 10% of the most influential jobs in
politics, the law, education, and business.
The general assumption that there has been a gradual improvement in
the status of women is not borne out by a close examination of the
statistics according to Alice Brown, one of the authors of Gender Audit
95, a wealth of statistics published by Engender, a research and
campaigning organisation of women in Scotland.
A case in point is the number of women on public bodies, where at
first sight the Scottish Office's stated intention of increasing the
representation of women to 40% appears to have been almost achieved at
39% -- and considerably better than the UK rate of 30%.
However, women are particularly concentrated in the tribunals and the
Children's Panel -- and not represented at all on the nationalised
industries. ''If tribunals are excluded fron the calculation, the
representation rate of women across other bodies drops to 25%,'' says
Brown. Examination of the chairs and deputy chairs of these bodies
reveals respectively only 15% and 25% to be women.
The advantage of an annual update, which members of Engender carry out
on a voluntary basis, is that it provides a monitoring tool to gauge
progress as well as distinctly Scottish statistics which in many areas
are not easily available.
''The Equal Opportunities Commission has a particular remit in areas
of employment and law, but we have included health (Scottish women have
one of the highest rates of coronary heart disease in the world), family
law trends and pensions,'' adds Brown. The audit will provide much
useful fodder not only for those with a professional interest in women's
issues but for researchers in almost any field.
Its main revelation is that despite far more women in the workplace --
and a continuing erosion of the earnings gap between men and women -- in
most spheres women are still over-represented at the lowest levels and
under-represented at the highest.
* In education, girls continue to do better than boys in examination
results, but their future prospects are determined immediately after
school. While 32% of girls go on to full-time education compared with
27% of boys, fewer girls go to university.
In teaching, far fewer women reach the top jobs than would be expected
from the proportion entering the profession. Women make up 99% of
nursery teachers, 91% of primary teachers, but only 66% of primary head
teachers. While 46% of secondary teachers are women, the figure for
secondary head teachers is 3%. In the Scottish universities, 24% of
lecturers are women, but only 4% of professors.
* In business only two of the top 150 company directors are women.
* In law, Scotland has one (temporary) woman judge and women account
for 8.9% of full-time sheriffs, 7.5% of QCs, 18.2% of advocates, 33% of
qualified solicitors, and 54.2% of solicitors admitted to the profession
in 1994, auguring change.
* In politics, the election of two women MPs this year, Helen Liddell
and Roseanna Cunningham, brought the Scottish total to a record seven or
9.7%. Although women are better-represented at local level, the
proportions have changed little in the past 15 years and currently stand
at 17% of regional and islands councillors, and 22% of district
councillors. Women account for 22.4% of the members of the new unitary
authorities.
* The voluntary sector at first appears to be an exception, with women
constituting three-quarters of the paid workforce. Here, too, the
numbers decrease in positions of power. Only 44% of senior staff and
committee conveners are women and the wealthiest organisations are
dominated by men.
* The report shows an increase in the number of lone parents dependent
on Family Credit. The effects of special dispensation for lone parents
on low income is not yet known, for childcare. The picture is also
obscured by the lack of Scottish statistics on beneficiaries of and
refusals to co-operate with the Child Support Act.
* The pattern in the arts is similar to that in voluntary
organisations, with women making up the majority of arts workers but
under-represented at director level. Arts grants are awarded to twice as
many men as women (but twice as many men apply). A survey commissioned
by the Scottish Arts Council showed that women artists were more likely
to be unemployed (37% as opposed to 30%) and low earners (57% of women
earned less than #5000 a year compared with 46% of men).

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday promised the country's
fishermen he would fight their corner at vital European Union talks due
to be held tomorrow in Luxembourg.
As he prepared to travel to the meeting of its Fisheries Council, Mr
Forsyth said the aim of the discussions was to negotiate arrangements
for regulating fishing off the west coast, over which there has been a
considerable amount of concern within the industry.
These arrangements, he said, had both to command the confidence of
Scottish fishermen and maintain proper controls over the activities of
foreign fishermen in Scottish waters.
''My attendance in Luxembourg will underline the importance which I
attach to Scotland's fisheries,'' stated the Scottish Secretary.
Yesterday, hopes were rising that the Fisheries Council would reach a
practical and acceptable deal on the management of fishing in western
waters.
A compromise proposal from Spain, which currently holds the
presidency, would appear to have the elements which would allow member
states to reach a deal although the European Commission effectively has
a veto if there is not a unanimous decision.
The main cause for concern among Scotland's fishermen is the level of
access of the Spanish and Portuguese to western waters from January 1.
Last month, Scottish Fisheries Minister Raymond Robertson told The
Herald he was confident it would not be a problem and there would be
''no Spanish rape'' of Scottish waters.
Mr Robertson and Mr Tony Baldry, the UK Fisheries Minister, have been
consulting over the summer to find out what the industry wanted from
them at the EU Fisheries Council meeting.
This included questions of how the industry wanted foreign fishing in
UK waters monitored and what they were willing to accept for their own
fishing effort.
Following exchanges between the UK Government and other member states,
a compromise scheme has been proposed by Spain.
Meanwhile, Mr Robertson announced yesterday that 42 Scottish fishing
vessels were successful in the third year of the Government's #53m
decommissioning programme. Around seven per cent of the UK fleet has now
been decommissioned.

A STAFF nurse at Berwick Infirmary has been suspended and may face
disciplinary action after medical reports were rewritten following the
death of baby boy aged 11 months.
However, an independent inquiry set up by Cheviot and Wansbeck NHS
Trust has been told the action did not affect the death of Ryan Smith of
Dean Drive, Tweedmouth, Berwick.
The baby, who suffered from a heart defect, died in a doctor's surgery
in the town because there was no-one available at the hospital to carry
out an examination when he became ill.
The trust said in a statement yesterday that the inquiry team told the
parents that the baby would have died regardless of where the treatment
was carried out.
The inquiry's findings and recommendations are expected to be made
public early next month, after they have been considered by the board of
the trust.
The inquiry is also examining other medical cover and safety issues.

IN HER closing chapters, actress, writer and comedienne Maureen Lipman
recites an old Chinese proverb which states: ''Those who have free
ticket for the play hiss first.'' I have a review copy of her latest
work, You Can Read Me Like A Book; let's take it from there.
The book is 274 pages long and is divided into six parts. These are,
in pedantic order, Actor in the House, Actor on the Job, Actor at Sea,
Actor in Trouble, Carry On Actor On The Job and Actor At Large. Here,
Lipman, immersed in a constant review of spontaneous events, tries to
seek out what is funny in her life.
She refers to her family and career for inspiration, and exploits
domestic crisis and professional disappointment. People love Lipman
because she can be flippant and erudite. But the content of this, her
latest book, is so weak, its publication is self-serving.
It's not her fault. A book which fulfills its function by handing down
subjective, real-life experience should be a diary. At her best, Maureen
Lipman articulates the state of grace of the women of her generation.
No-one is stressed out, but on ''automatic simmer''. At her worst, she
tries too hard. To get through this book, she and I both, were pedalling
through sand.
It's the wordplay which exhausts, chapters called Knowing Pains and
Training Cats and Dogs and The Jittering Prizes; and pathetic analogies
such as ''it sure takes the 'sh' out of shopping and supplies the
'ping'.'' Then there's the character who is as ''glazed as Virginia
Ham'' (interesting allusion for a practising Jew). Wordplay is like a
familiar joke, or bad writing in a sitcom, you can see the punchline
coming. It is not wit. It's desperation, and suggests a writer who is as
bored as you become.
You Can Read Me Like A Book is a series of essays, without guidelines,
without an editor's discipline. The book is a rant, incorporating the
stylistic devices of Lipman's heroine, Joyce Grenfell.
In a broader sense, Lipman struggles for technical merit. She tries to
outline characters, rather than colour them in, to make full use of the
power of suggestion, but she's too garrulous, and you switch from
paragraph to paragraph until you discern what she is actually concerned
with.
For example, Car Per Diem, is a nebulous and unfunny spew, of how she
swapped her Prelude for a soft-top BMW, I think, but until you're three
paras in, you think she's talking about the problems of being famous on
holiday. It's annoying.
If stream-of-consciousness literature is to work, it may be
incongruous, but some semblance of time passing is a must. References
are made to plays, the machinations of which, in terms of rehearsal and
organisation, are divulged in a Technicolor verbal diarrhoea much later
on.
One great episode, spanning several pages, gives an insight into the
prevailing temperature of the Lipman family (her husband is the
playwright Jack Rosenthal), which is a winning subject. Maureen had been
given the Oscar-winning job of reading a book called Hilda, The Hen Who
Wouldn't Give Up, by Jill Tomlinson, on tape for children. She spent
days round the house, clucking under her breath, trying to decide on a
hen with a soft Gloucestershire burr, or Yorkshire vowels.
So comprehensive was her rehearsal, that ''snide comments began to
emanate from him indoors''. Her husband began to drop lines such as, ''I
hope it won't ruffle your feathers if I ask you where my green jacket
is?'' and, ''Do you still want to meet at the theatre, or does it go
against the grain?'' Lipman decided to retaliate, by hiring a
yellow-feathered balaclava, an orange beak and a voluminous yellow
fluffy body with cosy mittens and black tights.
She writes ''I was stuffing cushions down the body when my son arrived
home from school. 'Hi Mom,' he intoned, deadpan. 'I see you are dressed
up as a hen. What's for dinner?'.''
Probably the most controversial form she can adopt is not that which
promotes Maureen Lipman as a personality, but as a person.

ANDY WARHOL said everyone would be famous for 15 minutes. For Kenneth
Norris, from Mull of Kintyre, fame lasted all of 10 seconds yesterday
when he auditioned for a new Martini commercial.
The amateur stripogram had spent 13 hours on an overnight coach to get
to the Criterion Theatre, London.
''Are you an extrovert?'' asked the auditioner.
''Do ye want me to show you?'' She frostily declined.
Mr Norris, 26, from Campbeltown, then stepped forward into the
spotlight in his Martini tank top and blurted more or less with panache:
''Of course, I drink Martini. I know I look good. You know I look
good.''
Then with a ''next, please'', his 10 seconds of fame was over. He was
not asked to stay on.
''It's a problem,'' he admitted later. ''I'll go sightseeing or
something.'' He stripped to earn extra on top of his money from casual
labouring jobs, he said.
Did he have a gimmick? -- apart from his tattoos, including one of
King Billy. ''I take ma clothes off. The mair I take off, the mair I get
paid. I thought it was worth a go today. There's something round the
corner for me somewhere,'' he said philosophically. In this case, it was
the next bus home.
In all, 5000 hopefuls sent in photographs for the auditions. By the
end of the day, auditioners had whittled down the 250 who had made it to
the theatre to a shortlist of 10 for final selection.
One of those to get through was nursery teacher Rosina Frempong, 25,
from Shepherds Bush. However, she didn't drink much Martini. She
preferred Malibu and pineapple.
Chris Meredith, Martini's marketing controller, said professional
actors and models would also be used for the advert.
He said: ''We wanted to cast the net as wide as possible to find the
best looking people. We know there are some very beautiful people with
the modelling agencies but they don't have a monopoly.

THERE are still 34 days to go before Kenneth Clarke rises in the
Commons to present his third Budget. But already the wheels of
speculation are spinning furiously about just how generous the
Chancellor's package of pre-election tax cuts will turn out to be.
A #4000m bonanza? #5000m? #6000m? One penny off the standard rate of
income tax? Two? In Blackpool, at the Tory Party conference, Clarke did
little to dampen rising expectations. Promising a Budget for Middle
England, Middle Wales, Middle Scotland and Middle Ulster, the Chancellor
trailed a programme of tax cuts running over several years, designed to
reward the hard-working, those taking responsibility for themselves and
their families, ''our people who run businesses and create jobs''.
That was followed a day later by the Prime Minister's explicit
conference pledge that, in the longer term, a future Tory Government
would abolish both capital gains and inheritance tax.
Such clear Downing Street nods and winks, in a period when Chancellors
are supposed to be in pre-Budget purdah, added fuel to the flames. So
much so that by last weekend Clarke felt compelled to take to our
television screens to quell the more extravagant rumours, calling some
reports ''barking mad''.
Our Ken has a problem, you see. In his first Budget, in 1993, Clarke
promised to ''sort out the problem of public borrowing once and for
all''. The gap between what the Government spends and what it raises in
taxes -- the public-sector borrowing requirement -- was set to soar
above #50 billion in 1993/94, nearly 8% of gross domestic product.
Clarke pledged to put the public finances back in balance by the end of
the decade.
In large measure, the problem was a consequence of John Major's
profligacy in 1990 when, in his only Budget as Chancellor -- faced with
a sharp recession and the imperative of getting the Tories re-elected
(and as it later transpired putting himself into No 10) two years later
-- he had chosen to spend his party's way back to power, using your
money and mine.
Thanks to that Major Budget, government spending soared from under 40%
of GDP in 1989/90 to a peak of 44.5% in 1992/93. Chancellor Clarke's
post-election task was to clear up the mess. This he did, in the
November 1993 Budget, with a swingeing three-year package of tax
increases designed to take more than #12 billion out of our pockets by
April 1997.
But the tax hikes, including the half-achieved and deeply unpopular
attempt, inherited from the Lamont Budget in March 1993, to levy VAT on
domestic fuel and power, have helped dispel any feel-good factor in the
population at large, even as recession receded and a period of
above-average growth resumed.
In his second Budget in November 1994, with the economy growing
strongly, Kenneth Clarke pruned back his tax raid over this year and
next by some #1700m. But consumers have stubbornly continued to feel
less-than-good, with around half the modest rise in consumers'
expenditure in the past year down simply to the lure of a big win on the
Lottery.
That sullen public mood was turning increasingly vengeful as a
revitalised Labour Party, under Tony Blair's leadership, established a
yawning lead in the opinion polls. But until recently the Chancellor
continued, in public at least, to resist the growing pressure on his own
backbenches to pledge significant tax cuts this November in a last-ditch
attempt to rein in Labour's poll lead.
In his Mansion House speech in June, Mr Clarke said: ''My aim
continues to be to bring the PSBR back towards balance over the medium
term. In time I intend to be able to cut taxes. But I will only cut
taxes when it is in the interests of the economy and when I can afford
to do so.''
In July he was telling The Guardian: ''I wouldn't indulge in tax cuts
that threatened the objective of moving back into balance over the
medium term.'' By September he was warning the Engineering Employers'
Federation: ''Do not believe all those reports that say all I should be
interested in is reducing taxes to win votes, regardless of the economic
cost. I do not intend to throw away these hard-fought-for gains by
playing fast and loose with the public finances. Nobody should assume
that tax cuts are in the bag.''
The Chancellor's immediate problem is that public-sector borrowing
requirement. Last week we discovered that, for the first six months of
the current year, borrowing stood at #20.4 billion. Far from moving
closer to balance, the PSBR is actually #300m bigger than it was at the
same time last year.
Lower than expected tax revenues -- including the much-discussed
failure of last December's emergency rise in the duty on whisky and
other spirits to raise any real money -- are the main cause. But the
figures spell slippage for Clarke's timetable for getting to grips with
government borrowing.
That ought to mean he is even less inclined to unveil a bumper bundle
of tax cuts next month. But at the IMF in Washington, days before his
Blackpool conference speech, the Chancellor was already trimming his
resolve.
''I have always taken the view that there will be room for tax cuts
only if we have control of public spending but we are well on course for
that in the medium term,'' he said. Then came the seaside nods and
winks.
There were reports at the time that Clarke's speech to the party
faithful did not go down well with Treasury officials, anxious to dampen
the mounting euphoria about the likely scale of November's tax bonanza.
There have been reports since that all but one of the so-called wise
men, the Chancellor's panel of independent forecasters, are also urging
against large-scale tax cuts and that Clarke's chief economic adviser,
Professor Alan Budd, may quit his post early if his boss puts his party
before the economy.
The worrying trend in the PSBR is only part of the problem. Inflation
rose sharply in September to 3.9%, against most City expectations. The
underlying rate hit 3.1%. That makes the Chancellor's aim of getting
that underlying rate below 2.5% by the end of this Parliament even more
daunting.
Whether Mr Clarke likes it or not, one of the main damper's on
inflation in recent months has been the consumer's continuing reluctance
to consume. So any extravagant tax giveaway next month would look
starkly out of place against that firm low inflation pledge.
With sterling currently testing its historic lows against the German
mark on the foreign exchanges, there are other inflationary pressures
about and the City is getting jittery.
But all the current signs are that, just as John Major used his 1990
Budget to spend the Tory Party's way back into office, Ken Clarke is now
succumbing to intense pressure to win a fifth Tory victory with
significant tax cuts.
If he is to preserve any vestige of economic credibility on November
28 and redeem that oft-repeated pledge to balance the public finances in
the medium term, he will have to pay for his pre-election largesse
through deep cuts in real public spending.
But, as a canny politician, he knows that slashing spending can lose
elections as readily as slashing taxes can win them. He's in a bind. And
he knows it. But, when push comes to shove, the Tory Party's instinct
for self-preservation is awesomely powerful. We are in for a high-wire
act, with no safety net.

Tom Zaitsev reports from Moscow how Russians of Scottish descent are
eagerly rediscovering their culture heritage
A BIT of Scotland can be found nowadays in Moscow, which is shaping up
as an increasingly cosmopolitan city with ethnic groups reasserting
their national and cultural identity.
But the Moscow Caledonian Club, set up a year ago, has much higher
aims than simply helping Russians of Scottish descent learn about their
roots. ''Broadly, we want to disclose to everyone what Scotland is,''
says Dmitry Fedosov, the club vice-president and effectively the only
Russian scholar on Scotland.
''Scotland has been traditionally regarded by our historians in the
context of England,'' he says. ''This is highly unjust, as it is a
country in its own right with no less rich a history and culture which
deserve special study.''
It is this task he has dedicated himself to for the past 10 years. His
crowning achievement is a Russian-language book on medieval Scotland.
His next goal is to finish researching the histories of more than 400
Russian families of Scottish origin.
Unlike Fedosov, Vitaly Mironov, a Moscow history teacher, had little
knowledge of Scotland before an exchange visit with his class in 1992.
Mironov's visit to Scotland changed his life. ''On the one hand, we fell
in love with this country, its lochs, castles, people, ubiquitous
history and distinctive culture. On the other, I was appalled to realise
that it was almost a terra incognita for us.''
For Mironov and his pupils the most surprising discovery was that
Scotland's links with Russia date back to the sixteenth century: ''The
first British ambassador to Muscovy, Tsar Ivan the Terrible's court, was
a pure Scot, you know.''
In the eighteenth century Russia became a destination for ''younger
sons of younger branches of younger houses'' of the Scottish
aristocracy, such as Patrick Gordon, one of Peter the Great's confidants
and best generals.
The famous Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov descended from the Earls of
Learmont; members of the Bruce and Cameron clans served under Catherine
the Great; and the Borodino battle hero Barclay de Tollay was also of
Scottish descent.
Now restoring the Scots' place in Russia's history has been Mironov's
obsession. By chance he met Fedosov, who, by another coincidence, had
graduated from the same school where Mironov taught. The two founded the
Caledonian Club with Fedosov responsible for education and research
work, and Mironov running its day-to-day activity as full-time chairman.
The children's section aside, the club has about 100 members. Anyone
with proven Scottish ancestry is welcome as an ''honourable member'', as
are professionals engaged in Scottish studies and hobbyists. They meet
each month in Moscow's Lermontov Library to talk and listen to lectures
about the Highlands, taste Scotch whisky and sing Scottish ballads.
A hall with the club's emblem, overlapping white and blue crosses,
substitutes for a clan room. Bagpipes and reels are also in the offing.
The clubmen don't miss a single significant event related to Scotland.
The programme for 1995 highlights a session to commemorate the
quincentenary of Aberdeen University, a round table on the 600th
anniversary of John Barbour, a seminar on 700 years of Franco-Scottish
relations and celebration of the Declaration of Arbroath. Naturally, the
birthdays of Burns, Stevenson, and Walter Scott are punctually honoured
at literary evenings.
Outdoor activities include pilgrimages to the estates of Lermontov and
James Bruce and trips to other sites connected with Moscow Scots.
Many of the members joined the club to find out more about their
Scottish background, until recently a closely guarded secret. The club
boasts two Lermontovs, a Leslie, a Carrick, a Collie, and a Hamutov,
Russian for Hamilton.
''My parents concealed our origin from us because it was unsafe to be
a nobleman under Stalin,'' says Igor Hamutov, a descendant of the Duke
of Hamilton, whose father was given the name Russifield in the 30s.
''When my father died I discovered in his passport details of our
relatives.''
Fedosov recently made a trip to Scotland and contacted the Duke of
Hamilton who was ''very interested'' in his long-lost exotic Russian
relatives. One of the Russian Hamiltons even ended up as ataman, or
chief, of a troop of Don Cossacks during the Bolshevik revolution.
Mironov hopes to arrange trips to their spiritual home for eager
members, possibly in conjunction with the Aberdeen Russian Club. He has
opened a small travel agency to arrange the trips and to raise money for
club projects.
The next project is a Scottish culture festival, to be held in Moscow
next May to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Robert Burns's death.
There are also plans to publish Fedosov's anthology of Russia's Scots
and Born in Battles embracing Scottish history until the fifteenth
century, as well as Walter Scott's Grandfather's Tales, as yet
unpublished in Russia.
But the major hit will be translation of the diaries of Gordon Patrick
which have been found in the archives and, according to Mironov, are
likely to produce a sensation.

A week-long celebration of the 700-year Scottish connection is under
way in France -- but what does it mean to the French, asks Nicholas
Powell
GENERAL de Gaulle may have referred to it as ''the oldest alliance in
the world'', but the 700-year-old vieille alliance between Scotland and
France, little taught in schools, is an unknown quantity to the vast
majority of his countrymen.
Scotland, many French people think, is merely a northern province,
annexed by England the way that Celtic Brittany was incorporated in
France by King Louis XIV. All too often the modern image of Scotland is
what drink firms and the tourist boards peddle -- the place where whisky
comes from, a land of haunted castles, non-stop rain, and men in skirts.
Will this week's celebrations change all that? A Paris arts cinema,
the Entrepot, is staging the second festival of Scottish film to be seen
on French soil in recent months -- the first one anywhere in the world,
as it happens, was organised in the Brittany port of Douarnenez in
August.
Seventeen films are being screened until next Tuesday, from the
inevitable Rob Roy and Highlander to Bill Forsyth's Local Hero and
Gregory's Girl, Murray Grigor's Scotch Myths and Danny Boyle's Shallow
Grave.
The cinema's restaurant, meanwhile is serving Scots food bilingually
described, from le cerf fume, or smoked venison, via the inescapable
haggis to le rosbif Aberdeen-Angus with la sauce horseradish, not to
mention a bit of la Cloutie Dumpling or le Typsy Laird.
Also in honour of the Auld Alliance, France-Culture, the national
radio station devoted to the arts, is broadcasting Scottish music
through the ages in its morning classical music slot. The intellectually
up-market evening paper Le Monde will devote a page to the links between
France and Scotland in Friday's edition.
One man patiently educating the French about their dealings with the
Scots is George Dickson who, despite his name, is himself French -- his
great-grandfather was a Scots entrepreneur who settled in the north of
France in the last century.
Chairman of the Association Franco-Ecossaise, founded in Paris 99
years ago, George Dickson has been busy over recent months lecturing and
giving interviews to radio and television.
''A lot of French people have no idea about the Auld Alliance. History
is very badly taught in our schools and a lot of people are ignorant
about many other aspects of French history too,'' Mr Dickson said.
''Fortunately , some interest has been generated thanks to the 700th
anniversary and we must simply hope that it continues.''
Last Saturday, along with local and central government dignitaries,
George Dickson attended the unveiling of a monument to the Auld Alliance
in Aubigny in the Berri region. The Scottish flag raised above it will
fly there permanently.
Aubigny was a rallying point during the 100 Years War between France
and England for Scottish troops who arrived via the Atlantic port of La
Rochelle between 1419 and 1425. Next year a Scottish delegation will
visit Aubigny as part of the centenary celebrations surrounding the
Association France-Ecossaise.
On Thursday, an exhibition of historical documents relating to the
Auld Alliance, due to run until January 8 next year, opens in the
Archives Nationales. And on Friday, French and Scottish lawyers meet in
Paris's Cour de Cassation -- the most elevated courtroom in the land --
from 2.30pm to 4.30pm, to discuss their respective national legal
systems.
The rest of that day will be given over to tourism, two official
receptions, lunch and dinner. Scottish guests range, by descending
hierarchical order, from the Lord Justice-General of Scotland, Lord Hope
of Craighead, to the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, and Alan
R Boyd, president of the Law Society of Scotland.
On Friday, there is more intense intellectual activity at the British
Council where French and Scottish university teachers will discuss the
history of the Auld Alliance. Norman MacDougall and Simone
MacDougall-Mesmin, professors of history from St Andrews University,
will speak, respectively, about Scotland at the end of the thirteenth
century and Franco-Scottish relations at the end of the fifteenth
century.
Even if the French are hopeless at history, Donald Kinloch, for seven
years chairman of the Paris branch of the Caledonian Society, thinks
there is ''a sort of automatic affinity'' between the French and the
Scots.
''Whether it has anything to do with the Auld Alliance, which saw the
French and the Scots defending themselves against English expansionism,
I don't know. The Scots don't seem to have got much out of it. A lot of
the French don't know the difference between the English and the Scots.
But a lot of them are more sympathetic when they find out you are
Scottish,'' he said.

THE father of Siamese twins Nicole and Chloe Astbury yesterday carried
their coffin to its final resting place.
Electrician Brian Astbury walked 200 yards followed by his wife
Melanie and about 40 mourners.
The simple 20-minute lunchtime service was followed by the burial at
Denton Cemetery, east Manchester.
Canon John Tutton, rector of Christ Church, Denton, told the
congregation at the private funeral: ''They were with you for only 35
days but in that time gained a very special place in your hearts and had
become very real personalities.''
The mourners included only invited family and friends.
Canon Tutton led them in the slow walk to the graveside, with Mr
Astbury cradling the oak coffin in his arms.
More than 20 bouquets and floral tributes later covered the grave.
Among these floral tributes was one shaped like two entwined hearts.
There were also two from the staff of St Mary's Hospital, Manchester,
where the twins, who were joined at the abdomen, spent their brief
lives.
Surgeons were expected to attempt separating the twins next year. Last
week, paediatric surgeon Alan Dickson said they died from a condition
which affected newborn babies who had been through a stressful period.

Margaret Vaughan charts the rise of a new star in the Labour Party
BALLS of steel, Helen Liddell? Some mistake there, surely, for
whatever the spin doctors meant to imply with their anatomically
imprecise diagnosis, they could not have got it more wrong.
It was meant as a compliment. A line spun to political correspondents
to help make sense of her fast-track promotion to Tony Blair's front
bench, barely a year after winning the filthiest by-election in the
annals of foul political contests, and then some. But it's smeddum she
has in heaps.
Oh there's iron in her soul, sure enough. It was forged by life in a
working-class home, in a close Catholic community, where the wee lassie
with glasses left for university, waved off in shared pride by the women
of the street, who hung from their windows, and came out to cheer her
on.
If there's steel about the comely person of the bus driver's daughter,
it's in the corsets fashioned from need that stiffened the backbone of
generations of working-class women.
She is of those strong, clever, matriarchal figures in which the
Scottish working class has been rich. Where she comes from there was no
shame in ambition, success was not eschewed, not at all. It involved,
though, a consciousness that to succeed meant a concomitant obligation
to give something back. That's what she believes she is doing now.
''It was Donald Dewar who said there was nothing to be ashamed of in
the notion of public service. I suppose after the past 16 years it's
become an old-fashioned idea. But I'm very conscious that I've had a
good life. Thanks to the 1948 Education Act, I went to university. I've
been an economist, a journalist, worked for the Labour Party and in
business. I've been given those opportunities as the daughter of a bus
driver. And I'm not going to be embarrassed to admit that I feel I want
to give something back through public service.''
Some who withered under the sharp tongue in her 11 years as general
secretary of the Scottish Labour Party, when she was fragrant
apparatchik-in-chief to a rumbustious collection of cliques, whose
hatchets were buried often in each others' backs, used to liken her to
Jean Brodie.
She could make them quail with an elegant twitch of her chiffon scarf.
But they were wrong there too. The romance is in where she comes from,
not some dream of where she wants to be.
Her swift acceleration on to the front bench was seen by some as Tony
Blair's two-fingered salute to the antics of those who promoted Tom
Clark, the former Monklands provost, in the Shadow elections last week.
But that underestimates the impact Liddell has made at Westminster and
on Blair.
Last year she served on both the finance and pensions committees. Her
speeches and interventions were trenchant and incisive. She showed a
sharp grasp of the complex issues that often baffled even those
longer-serving members with experience of such committees with their
arcane conventions.
Blair rates her extremely highly. Her job in the Scottish team, under
George Robertson, will be announced today. There was talk over the past
few days of her taking the economic portfolio. She is an economics
graduate of Strathclyde and worked as an economist before becoming an
economics correspondent with the BBC.
After her long gruelling spell in Labour's Glasgow offices, she was
passed over in the search for a general secretary for the British Party.
The job went to a man who rose without trace. She left, ostensibly to
write a bodice-ripping political thriller. Then, to the great scorn of
her old adversaries, she took an executive job with the Daily Record and
Sunday Mail, offered by the man who turned out to be as fake as his
Bry-nylon hair. She was appointed to the board.
Hindsight being a wonderous thing, when the old tyrant disappeared
overboard, taking with him the pensions of thousands of former employees
-- including hers -- she was scalded with criticism for having taken the
Robert Maxwell shilling.
When she was wee Helen Reilly growing up in Coatdyke she was shy and
bookish. Her social life constrained by caring for her mother who
suffered a stroke when the girl was 11. Joining the Labour Party was the
expected thing, a family inheritance for the daughter of a staunch trade
unionist.
The Economist's Scottish correspondent, Peter Jones, noted earlier
this summer how, after her victory at Monklands, she guilefully
manoeuvred the self-perpetuating clique on Monklands District Council
into signing its own death warrant. For Liddell recognised the vital
factor missed by everyone else -- the councillors were not just saying
they had done nothing wrong, they believed it. They went right ahead, at
her urging, and let a law professor investigate.
She has learned in a hard school to protect herself. She is, she
acknowledges, a tough lady, but not hard.
She was intensely moved at the funeral of her close friend and
political ally John Smith. There was much in the orations about the
Labour leader's talk of duty and committing yourself to others. It was
then, she says, she decided she would do as she was urged and stand in
his stead.
She dislikes Westminster intensely. Her home and her family, a son and
a young daughter, remain in Scotland.
Coolness under fire is, she thinks, one of her attributes. She needed
it in spades during the Monklands campaign and it will serve her well in
the hothouse of Westminster.
''I think what happened to Helen at Monklands, hard as it was, helped
her understand what it was like to be the candidate instead of the party
operator and adviser. That strengthened her and it showed an inner
mettle, but it made her seem more human somehow,'' said a parliamentary
colleague.
''I've heard nobody say a word against her, about her being promoted
so quickly. That says a lot and shows the kind of impression she's
created down here.''

Kirsty Scott examines why academic life in the nineties is a time of
angst for so many students
HE'S IN his second year, working hard to get in the honours stream.
Money is a real problem, so there's the late-night job in the
restaurant. Getting very tired these days and starting to slip behind a
bit with essays. Can't tell Mum and Dad, they've got enough on their
plate. Recently his heart's been racing and he can't sleep. Panic is
setting in. Maybe he's not cut out for this. Maybe he should never have
tried it in the first place.
He is typical of the thousands of students who are flooding into
university and college counselling services across Scotland and the rest
of the UK as the stresses of academic life in the 1990s take their toll.
A study released this morning reveals that university doctors believe
that the increasing number of students suffering symptoms of stress is a
cause of real concern. The GP's magazine BMA News Review carried out a
straw poll of 10 UK university doctors which backed claims that more and
more students are becoming ill with stress. Doctors are reporting a
marked increase in eating disorders, panic attacks, chronic fatigue, and
depression.
The findings echo a recent study by the National Union of Students,
which found that one in four students were worried about their financial
situation, a third had problems sleeping, 35% were missing meals, and
28% were unable to buy themselves food. A total of 10% said they often
felt acutely depressed. Student leaders say they are increasingly
concerned about the problem.
If the situation is bad in the UK as a whole, some student
representatives believe it is worse in Scotland, where longer degrees
can bring added pressures.
''We have a four-year degree up here, so there's more hardship,'' said
Douglas Trainer, president of the NUS Scotland. ''We're definitely
concerned about it and we would say that it's something that people are
aware of at university level. There are more and more stress-management
courses being set up.
''I think it has been on an upward spiral for some years now and
various factors have come together to produce a situation which is
causing great problems on campus. We are hearing about students
suffering mental breakdowns. Education has become more difficult,
prospects have become more bleak, so it's no wonder that students are
suffering from record levels of stress.''
At Edinburgh University the number of students seeking help from the
counselling centre has more than doubled from 240 between 1984 and 1985
to 511 between 1994 and 1995. Anxiety and depression account for the
bulk of all the cases.
Head of counselling at the university Craig McDevitt has worked with
Edinburgh students for a decade and has seen a clear shift in the
pattern of stress. ''I think that what I have witnessed over the past 10
years is that student life has become increasingly more stressful. In
the late 80s I would say that a lot of our work mainly featured people
who were feeling depressions and sadnesses in their lives. What we are
seeing now are more students who are in crisis, and there are very
immediate causes for the crisis. It's not something internal. It's being
caused by external factors.''
Both McDevitt and the others who work with student counselling say one
of the key problems is money, particularly with the removal of benefits
and the restrictions on grants.
''It has to be the money; it really has to,'' said Lin McLean, manager
of the counselling centre at Strathclyde University. ''That's just got
so bad since 1990 and 1991 when students were withdrawn from the benefit
system and loans were introduced. Debt is a great worry that produces a
lot of stress.''
Last year Strathclyde started weekly stress-management classes for
students after it became clear that there was a need for the service.
The classes run every day and pass on tips on stress and time management
and relaxation techniques.
''I think we certainly have a problem and we are responding to that,''
said McLean. ''The classes are very well attended so there is obviously
a need for them. I think there are a variety of pressures on students
now; academic pressures, financial worries, job prospects. That can lead
to overload.
''I think their work is being affected. The students we see at times
are absolutely exhausted. They are trying to hold down a part-time job
plus keep up with the demands of their academic studies. Sometimes it
gets so much that people get out of touch with their ability to cope.''
Graduation takes toll
* EMMA came to Strathclyde University with financial problems. Her
parents refused to supply the parental contribution. She wasn't getting
a grant and found herself struggling through first and second year.
Eventually the student counselling service helped her out with money to
buy food.
In her third year she started working part-time to try to support
herself, but there were problems with her bank and extra bank charges
and her health started to suffer.
Stress was diagnosed at the health centre and, after help in extending
her academic work deadlines, it was suggested she take some time out.
She came back in her final year and started to falter under the pressure
of a dissertation.
''Eventually she graduated,'' said Lin McLean, counselling manager at
Strathclyde University, ''but she paid a very high price in terms of
stress. I think she probably didn't get the class of degree she could
have got.''

PLANS were announced yesterday for a radical overhaul of maternity
services in Lothian, shifting resources to midwives working in the
community.
The proposals also include a long-awaited approval for a new
midwife-led unit at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh which will
handle up to 1500 low-risk deliveries a year.
Overall, the plans due to take shape over the next five years will
involve an investment of #2.1m and the recruitment of an additional 86
community midwives, an increase of 250% on present numbers. The aim is
to save mothers in distant areas like East Lothian and Midlothian
repeated 40-mile round trips for routine ante-natal and post-natal
checks.
Last night, the Royal College of Midwives described the plan as bold
and innovative.
RCM Scottish director Mrs Patricia Purton said: ''One has to recognise
that these proposals are totally new for the UK.
''Lothian seems to have had the gumption to put its money where its
mouth is and look at innovative practice. Although there are details
which will need to be examined, we very much welcome this whole
approach.''
The plans will now go out to public consultation for final approval
next year.
* Lothian Health decided in Edinburgh yesterday that proposals should
be developed for new community hospitals in north-east Edinburgh and
Midlothian.

As a new controlling body emerges, Anne Johnstone looks at tartan's
chequered story
IT was during the relief of Lucknow in November, 1857 that an
exasperated General Sir Colin Campbell was heard to bellow: ''Bring
forrit the tartan. Let my ain lads at 'em.'' He got his wish and the
Sutherland Highlanders soon showed 2000 mutinous sepoys who was the
boss.
A similar exasperated cry was to be heard last Monday at the Highland
Trade Fair in Aviemore when Scotland's leading tartan weavers and
retailers gathered to announce the creation of the official-sounding
Scottish Tartans Authority.
The new body is planning to apply for National Lottery funding for its
planned #1.4m international tartan centre. The background to this story
must finally nail the myth that tartan somehow imbues those associated
with it with a sense of brotherhood. Recent history appears to indicate
the opposite.
If you intend to read on, be warned: this tale is as complex as the
arrangements of checks and lines which make up the cloth in question.
For three decades a different body, namely the Scottish Tartans Society,
has struggled to retain in one camp a number of disparate interests.
These range from American tourists with a ''Mac'' in the family and a
fat pocket book to spend on ''their'' tartan, through terribly serious
academics determined to debunk the whole clan tartan concept as a
Victorian myth, to hard commercial interests keen to portray their
chequered cloth in any way that will help them to sell more of the
stuff.
At one time an uneasy peace reigned. In 1978 the Society's Museum of
Scottish Tartans in Comrie, Perthshire, won the Best Small Museum in
Scotland Award. In 1980 there were 1000 members, including a number of
wealthy Americans and Canadians, and a number of trade members, though
the museum was always run on a shoestring.
This is largely because its ruling council was wary of it being taken
over by commercial interests. But in recent years the society has been
overwhelmed by financial and other problems. In 1993 the former curator
admitted taking indecent pictures of kilted young boys exposing
themselves at the museum. The museum was closed and the collection,
including garments worn by Sir Walter Scott and David Livingstone, as
well as a pair of distinctive underpants once reputedly sported by Queen
Victoria's confidant John Brown, moved to a temporary exhibition at the
Tolbooth in Stirling.
The society was the subject of two damning reports. A working party
under Blair Macnaughton condemned the society's administration as a
self-perpetrating oligarchy, which was not accountable to its members.
Criticism focused on the society's executive president, Dr Gordon Teall.
Mr Macnaughton's reward was to be dismissed from the society for
bringing it into disrepute.
Then Stirling District Council commissioned an appraisal of the
collection by tartans expert Alastair Campbell of Airds. He concluded
that although the collection contained a few gems, most of it could be
replicated elsewhere.
Meanwhile, an interdict from the Court of Session banned the society
from exporting part of the collection to America. Following a breakdown
in relations between Stirling District and the Tartans Society, the
collection has been withdrawn from the Tolbooth to storage in Pitlochry.
It is believed that the society is now on the brink of signing an
agreement with Scotch House, a subsidiary of the English-owned Burberry
Group, to move the collection to the third floor of its store in
Edinburgh's Princes Street.
Yesterday, society spokesman Keith Lumsden said it was hoped the deal
would solve their financial problems. He declined to reveal the extent
of the debts, but they are believed to include one for #16,000 to Perth
and Kinross District Council in respect of the buildings in Comrie. Mr
Lumsden said Dr Teall had ''fought a hard battle to preserve the society
from commercial interests''. ''We feel strongly about the importance of
its independence,'' he said.
Critics maintain that if the society is trying to steer clear of
commercial exploitation then a deal with Scotch House seems a strange
way of going about this. The new body, which includes Blair
Macnaughton's family firm, House of Edgar in Pitlochry, as well as
Johnstons of Elgin and Lochcarron Weavers of Galashiels, and two of the
big retailers, Kiltmakers and Edinburgh Woollen Mills, is appealing to
the Tartan Society's remaining members to transfer their allegiance.
Mr Macnaughton said they were currently negotiating with three
district authorities, all keen to bring an international tartan centre
to their areas. The three possible locations are believed to be Perth,
Stirling, and Balloch. The venture would be likely to attract money from
the National Lottery's heritage budget and could also benefit from EU
funding.
Yesterday Mr Macnaughton was keen to dispel the notion that the centre
would be dominated by commercial interests with an interest in
bolstering the mythology around tartan rather than telling the more
prosaic truth. The centre would be a two-storey building, in which shop
units on the ground floor would furnish the running costs of the museum
and exhibiton space above, he said.
However, the new body, which was applying for charitable status and
would seek registration with the Scottish Museums Council, had been
constituted in such a way that the museum would be run entirely
independently, he added.

A move will be made at the new Highland Council on Friday to enshrine
the reform of land ownership in favour of local communities as one of
the council's main objectives.
A list of 10 goals has been drawn up by the council's convener Peter
Peacock in consultation with his colleagues. This list will be debated
when the council meets in Inverness.
The list covers the delivery of council services; the promotion of the
heritage and cultures of the Highlands; the sustaining and enhancing of
the area's environment; a Highland university; and the provision of
local accountability and scrutiny of quangos.
On the issue of ownership, it is clear that an attempt will be made to
loosen the grip of landlords and the Crown Estate Commissioners.
Mr Peacock said yesterday the statement of the council's goals and
values was an attempt to lay down a coherent policy.
He added: ''You cannot be interested in the future of the Highland
environment and its economic development and not address the historic
land question. The Highlands has a pattern of land ownership which would
amaze most of the rest of Europe because communities have so little
control over their own resources.''
The deadline for bids to buy the 17,500 acre Knoydart Estate, with
offers being sought in excess of #1.5m, has been extended to noon on
Friday, November 10. Local councillor Charlie King is hopeful that the
Knoydart Foundation, which represents local people and environmental
interests, will be in a position to make a bid.
''The original deadline was October 20 but that didn't give us enough
time. We had only just received the feasibility study completed for us
by the Agriculture College in Inverness and it wasn't fair to ask our
financial backers to put money in before they had a chance to read the
report. It is different this time and it is a good report.''

A HERALD article has emerged as the likely impetus behind the Scottish
Secretary's proposal last week to transfer state-owned crofting estates
to local community control and to encourage private landlords to follow
his example.
The report was written by Highland historian Dr James Hunter in the
summer.
Dr Hunter yesterday welcomed Mr Michael Forsyth's move and called on
the Government effectively to pay crofters to take control of the land
currently administered by the Scottish Office.
Dr Hunter revealed that Mr Forsyth had asked to meet him to discuss
his Herald article and supporting papers on the present problems facing
the Highlands.
The meeting took place at Skye's Gaelic college Sabhal Mor Ostaig on
the day Mr Forsyth opened the Skye Bridge.
Dr Hunter said: ''He said I had sent him some interesting ideas,
Bolshevik ideas. I said they weren't Bolshevik, they were radical.
''We then had a robust exhange of views in which I suggested that it
would not be enough for him to transfer the crofting estates owned by
the Scottish Office to local crofting trusts, that something had to be
done with the private estates as well.
''He made it quite clear that there would no question of compulsory
purchase or any form of coercion being employed but I argued that, at
thevery least, he should indicate that he favoured the general concept
of community ownership. He did this by calling on private landlords to
follow his example, which was the most significant part of his statement
last week.''
Dr Hunter said he also hoped that far from being asked to pay for the
croftlands owned by the Scottish Office Agriculture Department, public
money would be available to local crofters to run them.
He also thought the Government should accept that any transfer of
croftlands should include their mineral and sporting rights, which would
help in their development.
Dr Hunter said he had stressed to Mr Forsyth the difficulty many local
communities had in trying to raise the money required in the time
allowed, when private estates came on the market, such as had been
happening in Knoydart. Financial assistance should therefore be
considered.
He said he has been impressed by Mr Forsyth's moves on land reform,
which he sees as the most significant by any Secretary of State since
the 1920s.
''I welcome his statement last week as a very positive move in the
right direction and I think he is to be congratulated in having done
that. However, from my perspective I would like to see the thing moved
further forward.
''In particular, I would hope that other parties and organisations,
rather than pouring cold water on what he has done, would actually come
forward and say what they would do, how they would do better.''
A Scottish Office spokeswoman confirmed that Dr Hunter's article and
papers had been considered by the Secretary of State during the summer
and that a meeting had taken place between the two men on Skye earlier
this month when the issues raised were discussed.

TWO ex-Partick Thistle players yesterday began a court action against
their former club, claiming they were still owed cash for helping it win
promotion to Scotland's Premier Division.
Ray Farningham and David Irons said they are each owed #20,000 for
helping the Firhill side win promotion to the top flight of Scottish
football during the 1991/92 season.
The players also allege they are owed a further #5000 each for signing
for the Glasgow side from Dunfermline.
Partick Thistle are contesting the action at the Court of Session,
claiming they have paid the players ''agreed'' signing on fees of
#15,000 and also #6000 in promotion bonuses.
Mr Irons, 34, of Gargunnock, Stirling, said he had been approached
during a summer coaching course run by the Scottish Football Association
at Largs in 1991 and asked if he was interested in signing for Partick.
He later got a telephone call from the then Partick Thistle manager
John Lambie telling him that Dunfermline had given permission for him to
speak to the player.
Mr Irons said he attended a meeting at Firhill with his agent and Mr
Lambie to discuss personal terms. He was offered a #15,000 signing on
fee but the wages and bonus deal offered was less than he was getting at
Dunfermline.
There was an added attraction to sign for the Glasgow side, he said:
''There was a massive incentive put to me to help the club get promotion
to the Premier League.''
''The manager told me there was #250,000 on the table for the team to
get promotion to the Premier League. He said my cut would be #15,000,''
said Mr Irons, adding that Mr Lambie had then leaned back in his chair
before leaning forward slapping his hand on the table and telling him he
would get another #5000 ''on top of that''.
''The promotion payment was the deciding factor for me to join Partick
Thistle,'' said Mr Irons, who explained he believed the then First
Division club had a good enough team to go up.
The player said he went home to discuss the offer with his wife and
telephoned Mr Lambie the following day to ask for a further #5000 on the
signing on fee. He added that the manager replied: ''I don't think that
will be a problem.''
He told the court he subsequently went to Firhill and met John Lambie
in his office at a brief meeting to discuss personal terms.
''He brought a contract out for me to sign. He put it in front of me.
It was a blank contract. I put my name to it after John Lambie telling
me nobody refuses to sign blank contracts,'' he said.
He said he was agreeing his personal terms, including the #20,000
signing on fee. He added: ''He (Mr Lambie) told me the incentive bonus
could not be put in my contract but he was a man of his word.''
Mr Irons, who went on to captain Partick Thistle before signing for St
Johnstone, was shown a copy of a Scottish Football League contract.
A copy of the document is supposed to go to the League, one to the
SFA, one to be retained by the club and the fourth copy to be kept by
the player. Mr Irons said: ''I never received mine.''
Mr Irons claims in his action that after promotion was secured he
enquired about the promotion payment. He said Mr Lambie refused to
recognise the agreement.
He said that when his contract expired with Partick Thistle, Mr Lambie
told him he could not re-sign unless he dropped the present case. Mr
Irons signed for St Johnstone.
Mr Farningham, of Dundee, who now plays with Dundee FC, also said he
was induced to sign an uncompleted form by Mr Lambie. He said he
received no copy in which the blanks were completed.
Partick Thistle said the relevant details were inserted into the
blanks in the pre-printed forms prior to the players signing. Both
players received copies shortly after signing.
The club denies that the players were induced to sign the forms by
false representations. It said all money owed to them had been paid.
The hearing before Lord Hamilton continues.

A SOUTH African man who claimed racial bias while working at Edinburgh
University Settlement, a charity to improve education and relieve
poverty, suffering, and ill health, has been awarded #4000 compensation.
An Edinburgh industrial tribunal said 42-year-old Mr Stephen Dzivane
was a victim of racial bias and ruled against the charity, its director,
Mr Nick Flavin, and former manager, Mr Russell Donaldson.
Mr Dzivane, who was born in Johannesburg, claimed he was subjected to
racist remarks from Mr Donaldson. He was accused of ''running a harem'',
and Mr Donaldson told him he was the ''leader of the pack'' and that
''this place is not going to be taken over by you lot''.
The tribunal said it was satisfied Mr Donaldson was motivated by the
fact that Mr Dzivane was a black African.
A short statement from the charity, which receives a small annual
grant from Edinburgh University, said it would pay the settlement figure
in full.
Mr Dzivane, formerly of Sighthill Loan, Edinburgh, said he was very
pleased at the tribunal ruling. He said the incident at the charity had
been ''crude and basic'' and the most severe form of racial abuse he had
ever suffered.
Mr Dzivane, who is married to an Edinburgh woman and has two teenage
daughters, said he had been forced to go back to South Africa to find
work after the incident.
He said: ''I studied in Edinburgh and lived in Scotland for 12 years.
In that time, I was never subjected to the sort of racist abuse I had to
put up with from Mr Donaldson.
''His racist remarks were very basic and left me very sad, unhappy,
and angry at what happened.
''It has certainly not put me off coming back to Scotland as I love
the country. In fact, three white Scottish people came forward to be my
witnesses as they found this sort of racism unpalatable.''
The Commission for Racial Equality in Scotland, which helped advise Mr
Dzivane early in the case, said it was delighted he had been successful
with his action.
In evidence, Mr Dzivane said he had been offered a job to create a
multicultural centre at Stepping Stones Theatre, the former Traverse
Theatre in Edinburgh's Grassmarket. He thought it was a permanent post
with a #12,000 salary, rising to #18,000.
However, Mr Flavin was not happy with his performance and appointed Mr
Donaldson, 65, as manager of the theatre over Mr Dzivane's head.
The tribunal said it found Mr Donaldson to be overbearing and that he
clearly arrived with the expectation that Mr Dzivane was incapable and
found fault with him at every turn. There had already been a complaint
about his treatment of a black trainee, and he had been amused by a
racist joke.
Eventually, Mr Dzivane was sacked for gross misconduct.
The charity produced letters suggesting Mr Dzivane was potentially
violent but the tribunal found him to be a civil witness.
''He is, however, a large man and it was within the tribunal's
knowledge that black men are often feared to be violent even where their
behaviour is no different from that of any other person in the same
situation,'' the tribunal noted.
In its findings, the tribunal said it was satisfied that the facts
showed Mr Donaldson had a generally negative attitude towards persons
from ethnic minorities.
There was direct evidence of racial insults in the form of racial
jokes, inappropriate language, and racist phraseology. He had harassed
Mr Dzivane unnecessarily and made his job impossible.
The tribunal noted that Mr Flavin, 49, had been a missionary priest,
an educationalist in Nigeria, and was a student of African languages and
culture, and inferred he had a benevolent view of African people.
However, the tribunal further inferred from his evidence and demeanour
that he had a ''patronising and paternalistic attitude to Africans''.
The tribunal said Mr Flavin was a kind, even gentle person, with an
aspiration to do good, but his view of Mr Dzivane led him to dismiss his
complaints about Mr Donaldson's behaviour.
The tribunal said there were also procedural defects regarding the
handling of the matter. Mr Dzivane was suspended pending investigation
while Mr Donaldson remained in post. Mr Dzivane suffered a catalogue of
errors.
The tribunal decided these failures arose because Mr Dzivane was black
and that Mr Flavin had made up his mind early on that there was no
substance to Mr Dzivane's complaints.

LABOUR councillors in Falkirk yesterday won a protracted battle to
stop Central Regional Council, also Labour-controlled, from privatising
two large business parks.
Falkirk District Council and the new Falkirk unitary council twice
took the region to court over the move.
Both court actions failed but, after receiving notice of a third court
bid, the region dropped the plan.
Ownership of the Central business park at Larbert and Callendar
Business Park in Falkirk will pass to the new council in April.

A SCOT whose grandson died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) --
said to be the human equivalent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
mad cow disease -- has launched a High Court damages claim for more than
#50,000.
Mr James Smith, of U P Lane, Kilsyth, has issued a writ in the High
Court, London, claiming damages from the UK Medical Research Council and
from the Secretary of State for Health.
The writ states that his grandson Mark Smith, 20, died from CJD on
March 13, 1990, after being given human growth hormone injections which,
he claims, were contaminated. The treatment used human pituitary glands
''harvested'' at UK post- mortem examinations between 1959 and 1985.
The Medical Research Council and the Health Secretary are accused of
negligence for failing to design and implement a safe system of
extraction and purification of the products,
Mr Smith yesterday declined to talk about his legal action or his
grandson's death.
His case is one of several compensation claims from people who believe
they have been put at risk, or contracted CJD from contaminated growth
hormone.
A test case hearing is due to start at the High Court next spring. If
successful, there are a possible 1900 claims pending -- including Mr
Smith's. Some of the claims relate to people who have died -- CJD can be
confirmed only by post-mortem examination of the brain.
It will be claimed that pituitary glands used to obtain the hormone
were removed unlawfully -- without the prior consent of the donor, or
relatives after death.
Yesterday, it was revealed that a 64-year-old farmer's wife died three
weeks ago from CJD. Three farmers have already died from the disease and
a fourth is seriously ill.
The farmer's wife, Mrs Gwendoline Lawrence, of Lane Farm near Tallarn
Green, on the Cheshire-Clwyd border, died at the Royal Shrewsbury
Hospital a year after starting to display symptoms of CJD.
None of her husband's cattle was diagnosed as having BSE.
Mr Lawrence said scientists from the Government's CJD surveillance
unit in Edinburgh have visited the farm.
Meanwhile, businessman Ken Sharp, 42, from Childwall, Liverpool, was
said to be suffering all the signs of CJD and has been undergoing tests
in hospital. Mr Sharp is unable to recognise his wife and teenage
daughters, and a brain scan has revealed that his brian has shrunk. He
has no links with farming.
* An inquest heard yesterday that a mother who was injected with
growth hormone as a teenager died from CJD caused by her treatment.
Mrs Maureen Turrell, 33, of Petersfield, Hampshire, contracted the
disease 20 years after she first had injections to help her grow taller.
The condition left her in a wheelchair, unable to talk, feed herself
or care for her four-year-old daughter Sarah. Mrs Turrell died in April.
Dr James Ironside, of the National CJD Institute in Edinburgh, said he
had ''no doubt in this case the condition was caused as a result of the
injection of growth hormone.''
The coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure.

THE reason why a dead Sikh's sacred turban was found floating in the
toilet of a police cell remains unsolved, a sheriff ruled yesterday.
It was found next to the body of Mr Shkander Singh, 35, in Glasgow's
Stewart Street police station.
He was there after being arrested for punching his girlfriend, arts
officer Brenda Carson, during a drunken attack, Sheriff Eric Galt said.
Relatives of the dead man told a 10-day long fatal accident inquiry
into his death in May that he would never have put his turban near the
toilet.
In his written findings yesterday, Sheriff Galt said he could give no
explanation as to why the turban was in the water.
He said: ''There is simply no evidence on the basis of which I can
find by what route or by whose hand, if any, this occurred, accidentally
or deliberately.''
The sheriff found that Mr Singh, of Paisley Road West, Kinning Park,
was suffering from heart disease and died of a heart attack in the cell
in September 1994.

CUSTOMS and Excise staff flexed their industrial muscle for the first
time since 1981 yesterday when they staged a one-day strike which shut
their office in Hamilton, writes CAMERON SIMPSON.
The staff were protesting at the imminent closure of their office in
Barrack Street.
Seven offices in Scotland are to be axed, with a further eight
earmarked for closure.
Yesterday's action was also brought on by what unions said was the
management's insistence that it would be cheaper to close the office and
move some staff into Glasgow rather than across the street where there
was empty space in the Inland Revenue office.

A POLICEMAN yesterday was cleared of assault, months after having
shoplifting charges against him dropped.
Constable Eugene MacGinley was found not guilty of attacking a
newspaper photographer outside a court minutes after the shoplifting
case was abandoned.
Mr MacGinley, 35, who has been suspended from the force for two years,
was alleged to have punched Andrew Barr, a freelance photographer, and
smashed part of his camera.
Sheriff Brian Scouler at Dumbarton ruled there was sufficient doubt
surrounding the incident.
Mr MacGinley, of McLachlan Place, Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, claimed
there had been contact between him and Mr Barr but insisted it was ''an
accidental bump''.
However, a witness testified that the officer lashed out with his
fists and struck the photographer three or four times.
Mr MacGinley is likely to be the subject of an internal inquiry
conducted by the deputy chief constable of Strathclyde.

THE oil industry yesterday rejected a suggestion from two Scottish
university lecturers that there was nothing to suggest that offshore
safety had improved since the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988.
Dr Charles Woolfson, an industrial relations lecturer at the
University of Glasgow, and Mr Matthias Beck, a lecturer in economics at
the University of St Andrews, presented their case at an influential
safety meeting in Aberdeen yesterday.
The oil industry rejected their claims.
Addressing the 14th Leith International Conference, the two lecturers
accused the oil industry of presenting an optimistic and misleading
picture of safety offshore and suggested that a main factor in
preventing improvements was the lack of unionisation.
They also expressed concerns that safety might be compromised by the
current cost-cutting atmosphere within the offshore industry which was
following a pathway of hidden deregulation, intentionally or
unintentionally, and unlikely to create a safer working environment.
''It is quite clear that Piper Alpha occurred because of cost cutting
within the industry. We are worried that the current era of cost
cutting, the Crine initiative, will introduce pressures that will lead
to safety being compromised,'' said Dr Woolfson.
Mr Brian Taylor, technical affairs director of the United Kingdom
Offshore Operators' Association, rejected the suggestions.
''We feel by bringing in the safety case we have reduced the risk of
another Piper Alpha type disaster to a very low level indeed. We are
working hard now to reduce the more mundane serious injuries, slips,
trips and falls, falling objects, incidents with cranes. This is the
area where we think, with the better involvement of the workforce, we
can make gains. We are already better than comparable industries
onshore.''
However, Mr Taylor conceded that the frequency of serious injuries was
not falling as fast as they would like.
''That is being tackled by greater involvement of the workforce
through the safety representatives because these are accidents where
people are making mistakes.''

ROSEMARY West bowed her head in the dock yesterday as a forensic
pathologist held up specimens of bone to demonstrate how the body of her
daughter Heather had been dismembered.
Close to tears, Mrs West could not bear to look towards the witness
box where Professor Bernard Knight described how Heather's remains
proved she had been decapitated.
He could not say whether this was before or after death.
Like other victims whose remains were recovered from 25 Cromwell
Street, Gloucester, her legs had been severed at the hips.
There was evidence that a sharp-pointed knife was employed in her
dismemberment and, as was the case with other victims, many bones were
missing.
Professor Knight described how on just one day -- March 7 last year --
between the hours of 9.30am and 6pm he excavated the remains of five
victims at Cromwell Street.
They had been bound, masked, and gagged.
The skull of Shirley Hubbard, unearthed in the cellar, had brown
parcel tape bound around front and back.
Plastic tubing had been affixed in the nostril area.
The tape covered her mouth and without the tubing she would have been
unable to breath, Professor Knight told the court. She would have been
asphyxiated.
Earlier the jury of eight men and four women at Winchester Crown Court
had heard a tape recording of a police interview in which Mrs West
claimed that on the day Heather disappeared her husband had forced her
to spend the night with a Jamaican away from home.
In the police tape recordings Mrs West said that her husband was given
money by his black friends to have sex with his wife.
Mrs West pleads not guilty to 10 counts of murder of young females,
including that of her daughter Heather who disappeared in 1987 when aged
16.
Mrs West said in the taped interview that on the evening her daughter
disappeared she spent the night at the home of a Jamaican on the
instructions of her husband.
Asked by Detective Sergeant Terry Onions why she remembered that
particular night, Mrs West replied: ''Because I didn't want to go.''
Things were going on in the house, she said. With Heather moving out
she did not want to leave her children there with young babies.
She estimated she had been away from the family home between 7pm and
7am the following day.
She insisted she did not know that Heather was dead on that particular
day, nor did she realise that Fred might have needed time alone . . .
''To bury her or whatever''.
Mr Onions was incredulous about Mr West encouraging his wife to have
sex with other men.
''I used to get these things like 'You're not doing enough for our
marriage' and 'You're not doing this and you're not doing something
else','' she said.
In a later interview Mr Onions told Mrs West that her husband had gone
to 25 Cromwell Street, under escort, and indicated where police should
dig. Since then human remains other than those of Heather had been
recovered.
Asked if she wanted to say anything, the tape indicated she merely
shook her head.
In the interview Mrs West was also quizzed about the disappearance of
her husband's first wife, Rena, and her Scots-born daughter, Charmaine.
Mrs West said the last time she saw them was when Rena came to her
then flat at 25 Midland Road, Gloucester, and took Charmaine away.
Charmaine's body has been unearthed from the kitchen area of that flat
and Mrs West is accused of her murder.
In another interview with the police Mrs West denied any recollection
of another victim, Shirley Ann Robinson -- even though the court now
knows she lived at 25 Cromwell Street and was made pregnant by Frederick
West at the same time his wife was expecting a baby.
When asked what was her reaction to now hearing about this pregnancy
Mrs West responded: ''There's something wrong with the bloke, isn't
there? There is something very wrong with him altogether.''
During his evidence Professor Knight had described his horrific
findings at Cromwell Street.
He told the court how when he uncovered the remains of Alison Chambers
he found a wide belt with a big buckle over her skull.
Like all the bodies she had been placed in a small cubicle-shaped
area.
It was like trying to squeeze a five-foot body into a two-foot hole.
This, however, did not explain decapitation or mutilations.
When he uncovered the skelton of Shirley Ann Robinson, he also
recovered remains of a foetus.
The professor also described how he recovered the remains of Rena West
and Ann McFall, a Scottish girl who used to babysit for her, from
separate fields some distance from Gloucester.
The trial continues today.

writes WILLIAM RUSSELL.
Mr Colin Carr had complained to the commission on behalf of the Eigg
Residents' Association about scenes showing a Rolls-Royce destroyed by
fire which belonged to the then owner of the island, Mr Keith

The complaint was that the programme implied that the damage had been

The commission said the item had made it clear the cause of the fire

Strasbourg
MRS Winnie Ewing broke European law last night by speaking in Gaelic
in the chamber of the European Parliament.
She spoke for a minute from a prepared script in opposition to a plan
by the EU's Council of Ministers to scrap spending on minority
languages, including Gaelic. The British Government has supported the
cut.
However, Mrs Ewing, SNP Euro-MP for Highlands and Islands, took the
precaution of circulating a written translation into English of her
remarks to avoid embarrassing interpreters and being halted for speaking
in a language which, she claimed, was illegal on the floor of the house
in Strasbourg.
Euro-MPs will vote later this week on the proposed cut in the sums
paid to Europe's lesser-used languages including Scots and Welsh.
Ireland has resisted the move, which was discussed earlier this year in
the Council of Ministers when the cut was supported by Mr David
Heathcoat-Amory, Paymaster-General, a Euro-sceptic and former Minister
for Europe.
This year's budget for endangered EU languages was #2.64m. The
parliament wants this raised for 1996 to #2.8m but the council -- the
EU's most powerful institution -- wants it scrapped completely.
The British objection is to the principle of the spending. It has no
legal or treaty base, according to the British Government. A UK
spokesman said earlier this year: ''We think the money could be spent on
other items and better scrutinised to be sure it is used properly.''
SCOTLAND should ignore the approaching 300th anniversary of the Treaty
of Union with England and concentrate instead on celebrating
independence on the first day of the new millennium, Dr Allan Macartney,
SNP vice-president, said yesterday.
Flanked by party president Mrs Ewing and French colleagues in the
European Parliament, Dr Macartney, Euro-MP for North-East Scotland, was
speaking on the 700th anniversary of the Auld Alliance with France.
He said: ''The Scottish people are ruled by a government and a
political party which was not elected by the majority of the Scottish
electorate.''
Mrs Ewing praised the Auld Alliance for developing a culture,
philosophy, education and legal systems more in tune with France and
other European countries than with England.

THE son of the late Robert Maxwell admitted yesterday he lied to
bankers but said he did so on his father's instructions and only with
great reluctance.
Mr Kevin Maxwell told an Old Bailey jury of the shame he felt at
having agreed with the orders his father gave him during a stormy
meeting, at which the publisher thumped the desk with his fist.
''My feelings of embarrassment and even shame about that conduct
(lying to the banks) are no different today in this public courtroom
than I felt at the time,'' he said.
He said he confessed and apologised to the chairman of the bank
concerned, Mr Ced Ritchie of the Bank of Nova Scotia.
Mr Maxwell, in his seventh day in the witness box, said the Maxwell
Group had committed a ''technical default'' on the conditions of money
it owed.
He said he had phoned his father about it, adding: ''My father's
reaction was extremely short and sharp. He told me to get real. He said
to have such a conversation on an open satellite line was disastrous,
that I was breaking every rule of confidentiality.''
Robert Maxwell expressly forbade his youngest son from discussing the
breach of conditions further until he returned and ordered him under no
circumstances to admit there had been a default.
If it was discovered, he was to blame it on the group's merchant
bankers, Goldman Sachs.
Mr Maxwell, 36, his brother Ian, 39, and former Maxwell financial
advisor Larry Trachtenberg, 42, deny conspiracy to defraud the pension
funds by misusing #22m worth of Teva shares. Mr Kevin Maxwell alone
denies a similar charge of conspiring with his father to similarly
misuse #100m worth of shares in another Israeli company, Scitex.
The trial continues.

AN MP fears that drug smugglers could target Scottish airports as easy
ports of entry because all that stops them from walking out of the
airport is a message requesting them to ring a bell if they have
anything to declare.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, told a
Commons committee yesterday that it was unlikely to be the best
approach. ''The guy you want to catch is hardly going to ring a bell,''
he said.
The request to ring a bell for a Customs officer is at Aberdeen
Airport in the domestic arrivals lounge. A bell or a telephone exists at
similar lounges at Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Prestwick airports.
They were put in because of changes introduced in 1993 which mean that
some people arriving from foreign flights via Heathrow can have their
luggage checked through to these four Scottish airports.
As they are then arriving in domestic lounges, there are no red or
green channels to walk down. Instead, there are ''red points'' where
they can phone or ring for an official, if they feel obliged to declare
they have too many duty-free goods.
When asked what type of person actually used such a facility, a
Customs official in Glasgow said: ''Very honest ones, I would have
thought.''
However, what seems quite a relaxed attitude is a reflection of
Customs and Excise targeting drug smugglers more effectively rather than
patrolling airports hoping to find someone with an extra bottle of
whisky in their luggage.
While there are fewer Customs staff at airports now, there are more at
the Customs and Excise intelligence centre in Paisley where, through
international co-operation, they attempt to track large-scale drug
smuggling.
In the UK overall, Customs staff is to fall from 25,000 to 21,000 over
four years. In Scotland, the drop will be from 1800 to 1600 but the
majority of jobs lost will be in the area of VAT inspection, while
officers involved in work against drug smugglers will increase.
Nevertheless, Mr Bruce asked the chairman of Customs and Excise, Ms
Valerie Strachan, who was giving evidence to the committee investigating
cross-border shopping: ''Isn't there a danger that you are turning these
airports from low risk to high risk if word gets around?''
She assured him: ''There will be no such thing as a Customs-free
airport.

AN appeal court ruled yesterday that a sheriff was wrong to throw out
the first prosecution under new trespass laws.
Two men and a woman were charged on November 23, 1994, with breaching
the new Criminal Justice Public Order Act by failing to leave land at
Dengin, near Invergarry, Lochaber, after being directed to go by police.
Under the Act, police can direct trespassers off land if it is
believed the owner requested it.
At trial in Fort William Sheriff Court, it emerged there were
competing claims for ownership of the land at Dengin.
Sheriff Frederick Levine therefore acquitted the accused. The Crown
appealed.
Yesterday, the Justiciary Appeal Court decided that since both
competing claimants to the land agreed that the three should be moved
off, the police had acted properly.
The case was sent back for trial.

THE spotlight was on him. It was what he had dreamed of ever since he
scribbled his career plan on an envelope -- playing the Prime Minister.
Now he was standing at the despatch box answering Prime Minister's
Questions. He heard the heavy playing chief Opposition spokesman saying:
''It has been a long time, but you have finally made it.''
But the dream had turned sour. He was playing the role but only as a
stand-in. While John Olivier was away wowing them at an off-Broadway
venue, he had been asked to fill in.
Yes, the understudy might, oddly, have a bigger dressing room than the
star, but at the end of the day he was a stand-in, a deputy.
He had been a hit in the provinces time and again. In Blackpool,
Brighton, and Bournemouth, audiences had encored him rapturously. He had
played the West End stage for years, often drawing rave notices for
colourful performances.
His repentant authority figure in the Marxist drama ''Ending the Pit
Closures or Pretending To'' won him a special Brass Oscar. His playing
of the assassin in ''Thatcher's Fall,'' although receiving mixed
reviews, even had his critics admitting that it contributed quite a lot
to a riveting drama.
However, his greatest longing -- as others long to play Hamlet -- was
to play the Prime Minister. Cruelly, the casting directors in the Blue
Room had turned their thumbs down and handed the part to an actor who
made Clement Attlee look charismatic.
So there was a bitter irony in his first line: ''I have been asked to
reply,'' which was missing when uttered by the former stand-in Mr Tony
Newton, who had probably never thought of himself as Prime Minister
except possibly in his bath.
As well as irony there was strain. ''OK. You may only be a stand-in.
Show us how you would play it if the role was yours for keeps.'' The
folder containing the briefing notes trembled visibly. First matinee
nerves.
He joked, though, telling the other stand-in, deputy Labour leader
John Prescott: ''The Prime Minister has trusted me to come alone. You
have a minder appointed to look after you.''
The knowledgeable audience well understood this reference to Mr Peter
Mandelson, MP for Hartlepool and spin-doctor extraordinary who, though a
junior member of Mr Prescott's team is thought to have been put there by
Mr Blair to keep an eye on Mr Prescott.
The minder appeared not to have had the courage to turn up, jeered Mr
Heseltine. In fact, Mr Mandelson was lurking behind the Speaker's chair
as if auditioning for Iago, Rasputin, or perhaps Svengali.
The subsequent exchanges resembled one of those trendy modern plays
which the actors make up as they go along. The Opposition formed
themselves into one of the gloomier Greek choruses chanting about job
losses, elderly NHS patients only admitted to Rochdale hospitals if they
were going to die in four weeks, and billions and billions of pounds
wasted.
Mr Heseltine's lines proceeded in parallel with the accusations hurled
at him by the Chorus without exactly relating to them. Unemployment was
falling, NHS spending was up, we have the fifth-largest development
budget in the world. It was a performance that went in the actor's
well-known style for grand, sweeping effects ignoring niggling detail.
The plot climaxed on a desk, a switch from high melodrama to
Christie-type mystery. Did the deputy have a desk diary which cost the
tax-payer #80,000? It seemed rather a lot for a desk diary even for
someone who operates on Mr Heseltine's imperial scale.
One of Poirot's assistants employed by the Independent newspaper
claims to have unearthed that it is a computerised desk diary, which
explains almost everything. Mr Heseltine landed, as those playing Prime
Minister so often are, with the dual role of Chief Suspect, replied: ''I
have spent no money on a desk.''
Shortly afterwards, the curtain fell leaving the audience confused
about the desk in the best manner of contemporary drama. Our Drama
critic writes -- ''He was expressive in the aggressive parts of the
role, less so in the character's defensive moments. He looks the part
but may have waited too long to play it.''

COMMONS Speaker Betty Boothroyd yesterday agreed to investigate claims
that Labour MP George Foulkes is poaching constituents from Mr Phil
Gallie, his Tory neighbour in next-door Ayr, in advance of boundary
changes that take effect at the next election.
Mr Gallie complained to Miss Boothroyd that Mr Foulkes (Carrick,
Cumnock and Doon Valley) has advertised surgeries in his constituency,
to be held this weekend and next month.
The Ayr MP, whose majority of 85 has been effectively wiped out by the
new boundaries, argued that he remains MP for the whole constituency
until the election.
On a point of order, Mr Gallie -- who did not name Mr Foulkes -- said
another MP was ''seeking to contact with my constituents.'' He added:
''My constituents will be excluded from my constituency following
boundary changes at the next General Election.
''But it is my belief that it is my duty to represent my constituents
up to that time, and no other member should intervene.''
Miss Boothroyd replied: ''You're perfectly correct,'' and promised to
examine the issue.
Last night at Westminster, Mr Gallie claimed he had asked Mr Foulkes
not to take such action, and called on him to ''do the honourable
thing'' and cancel the surgeries. ''It is presumptuous of him to think
that he will be elected at the next election. That is for the voters to
decide,'' he said.
He added: ''The Speaker has made a judgment. We call ourselves
honourable members and if he's an honourable member he should pull the
plug and cancel the surgeries.
''It's poaching, it's damn cheek. He's got enough to do in his own
constituency and should concentrate on that.''
Mr Foulkes responded angrily to the allegation, which he claimed was
misinformed. ''As usual, Phil Gallie has the wrong end of the stick. If
he'd had the courtesy and intelligence to come and talk to me first I
could have saved him the embarrassment.''
The Labour MP said he had no intention of dealing with constituency
problems and that the surgeries had been arranged solely to give his
future constituents a chance to meet him.
''I'm providing them with an opportunity to come and meet me. I will
explain to them that Mr Gallie is their MP for the time being, but I
expect to represent them after the next election,'' he said.
However, he can expect an unsympathetic hearing from Miss Boothroyd.
In reply to Mr Gallie in the Commons yesterday, she said: ''Until the
next General Election, whether you have boundary changes or no, as I do
myself . . . I still represent the people who put me here from West
Bromwich West. If you will let me see the advertisement I will be glad
to deal with it.''
In his press release to local newspapers announcing the extra
surgeries at Belmont Academy and Alloway Primary School -- both in Mr
Gallie's constituency -- Mr Foulkes said: ''This will give electors in
the enlarged constituency an opportunity to come and meet me and also
provides two further central locations for my current constituents in
Kincaidston and other parts of the constituency.''
Boundary changes have transferred more than 10,000 of Mr Gallie's
constituents to Mr Foulkes's adjacent constituency.

TORY MPs last night were told by Treasury Chief Secretary William
Waldegrave to expect a tough spending round in which other departments
would have to accept cuts if the Government's commitment to education
was to be preserved.
In exchange, Mr Waldegrave was told by MPs at a meeting of the Tory
backbench finance committee that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke must act to
cut the standard rate of income tax in next month's Budget.
Mr Waldegrave, who set out the Government's pre-Budget position but
did not give away any details, heard a succession of MPs echo the Tory
right's demand for election-winning tax cuts.
A senior member of the committee said last night: ''There's a general
agreement that it's got to be a tough Budget. He comes to listen to us.
He listened to various ideas from various members of the committee, but
if he wants to deliver a tough spending round he's got to carry his
colleagues with him.''
He added: ''There was a lot of discussion about education. He did say
more money for education means less money elsewhere.''
Speculation, encouraged by those present at the meeting, suggests the
final details of the public expenditure settlement, in which each
department negotiates its annual Budget share, will have to be settled
at Cabinet level rather than in the Cabinet's EDX public spending
sub-committee.
Last weekend, Mr Clarke sought to reduce expectations of a 2p cut in
the standard rate of tax by saying tax cuts would only happen if the
country could afford them and they were not in the public interest.
A higher than expected Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, lower than
expected Government revenues and an unanticipated rise in inflation,
have reduced Mr Clarke's scope for tax cuts.
Although he has been under intense pressure from the right of the
party to cut taxes, there is a growing clamour from the Tory left not to
sacrifice the economic recovery by risking higher inflation for the sake
of political expediency.

FORMER Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd last night told pro-European
Tory MPs that the Conservative Party must unite around the Prime
Minister's European policy.
He said the differing wings of the party had accepted a ''truce'' on
Europe ''not before time.''
Now they must back Mr Major's determination to resist further
integration of Britain into the European Union.
The speech makes clear Mr Major's conviction that the Conservatives
must fight the next election on a moderately Euro-sceptic platform.
Mr Hurd said there should be no fresh moves towards integration. ''Let
us concentrate on harvesting what we have sown.''
He said he believed that a substantial majority of the British people
approved of Britain's membership of the EU, but was not enthusiastic
about further integration.
''We are coming to the close of the period during which at regular
intervals there was a great leap forward in integration.'' No such great
leap was being proposed for the inter-governmental conference next year.
The plan for a single currency had proved to be divisive, he said.
''If it proceeds apace on a fixed timetable, we can foresee a European
Union divided into three camps -- those who can and will, those who can
and prefer not to and those who are keen but cannot join a single
currency.
'' Whatever the outcome, divisions on this matter must not lead to the
unravelling of the Single Market and the other achievements of the EU as
it stands today. The proposed leap forward must not become a backward
slide.''
The Maastricht Treaty as negotiated by Mr Major with its opt-outs for
Britain, would remain the basis of Britain's membership of the Union
''for a long time to come.''
However, Mr Hurd defended the European Commission, Court and
Parliament saying that fighting fraud, reforming the Common Agricultural
Policy and completing the Single Market could not be done without them.
Euro-sceptic Tories were less happy about his approval of ''building
brick by brick a common foreign and security policy'' even although he
said that should be done outside the treaty on a voluntary basis and
alongside co-ordinated action against organised crime, terrorism, the
drug trade and illegal immigration.
The ''ever close union'' of which the treaty spoke did not mean
''persistent moves towards a superstate'' he said, but the inter-twining
of the lives of the citizens of the Community countries.
He also supported the Government's new policy of working for closer
links between the EU and the North American Free Trade Association.

DISCRIMINATION against people suffering from Aids is to be made
illegal, the Government announced last night, as its package of measures
to advance disabled rights cleared the Lords.
Social Security Minister of State Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish
introduced Government amendments to the Disability Discrimination Bill,
making clear that people at a ''progressive stage'' of the HIV virus,
leading to Aids, would receive the same protection under the Bill as
disabled people.
Lord MacKay told peers before the legislation gained its third reading
without a vote: ''A person with HIV would be a disabled person under the
Bill when the infection reaches a progressive stage.''
He added: ''The amendments serve to clarify the Government's position
and to fulfil our commitments.''
The changes, which were approved without a vote, were welcomed by
Baroness Hollis of Heigham, for Labour, and by crossbencher Baroness
Masham of Ilton, who is on the all-party Parliamentary Group on HIV and
Aids.
Lady Masham said: ''The Government did listen and we are all very
grateful.''
The Bill establishes a National Disability Council to advise Ministers
and makes it unlawful to discriminate against the disabled in employment
and in provision of goods, facilities and services.
However, Opposition parties and disabled rights campaigners have
criticised the plan for an advisory council and have demanded a
commission with similar powers of investigation and prosecution as the
Equal Opportunities Commission.
They gave notice last night that they will continue to press their
demand.
The Bill now returns to the Commons for MPs to debate changes made in
the Lords.
During the measure's line-by-line committee stage in the Upper House
in June, the Government was defeated when peers voted by 94 to 50,
majority of 44, to widen the definition of ''disability'' in parts of
the Bill.
The move would extend measures preventing discrimination in the area
of goods and services to cover people who are not significantly disabled
and who are perceived to be disabled.
During last night's third reading debate, Lord Mackay told peers the
Government would be setting up a telephone helpline ''to provide general
information about the provisions of the Bill''.
The House also approved Government amendments to extend the Bill to
cover occupational pension and health insurance schemes.
Winding up the debate, Lord Mackay said: ''The provisions in the Bill
amount to the most radical set of measures taken by any Government to
tackle discrimination against disabled people in employment and in
provision of goods and services.
''The very extent of the endeavour is a little breathtaking and also
not a little daunting.''
Baroness Hollis, for Labour, said: ''It started as a fairly good Bill.
It's a Bill which became a much better Bill. But it's still not a good
enough Bill.''
She said: ''At the core of the Bill, we don't believe there is a
sufficiently effective mechanism to make it work. It lacks a single,
authoritative central body.''
Lady Hollis warned Ministers against seeking to overturn the one
defeat inflicted on them by peers when the Bill returns to the Commons.
Labour's Lord Ashley of Stoke, a veteran campaigner for the disabled,
described the Bill as a ''limited advance''.
Lord Ashley, whose own backbench disabled rights Bill has been
blocked, said the Government's Bill had basic flaws in that it exempted
small firms and did not include a Disability Rights Commission.
''So how can we say it's a marvellous Bill? We can't.''
Lord Ashley disclosed that further backbench attempts would be made
within the next few weeks, in the Commons or the Lords, to legislate for
a commission.

SCOTTISH Office Minister Raymond Robertson last night hit out at the
''green'' lobby as the SNP and other Opposition parties mounted a strong
attack on the Government's environmental policies.
In a Commons debate initiated by the SNP, Mr Robertson argued against
what he described as ''a kind of moral absolutism,'' which he said must
be resisted if the cause of environmental improvement was not to lose
credibility in the minds of the community at large.
He told the House: ''The clamour from the green corner is all too
often for the environment to be returned to its natural condition of
pristine purity, regardless of the actual benefits of doing so and
regardless of the costs involved.
''Undoubtedly, we must be careful and considerate in our treatment of
the environment, but we must also be alive to the law of diminishing
returns.
''The expenditure to clean up that last trace of pollution in the
remaining residue of waste material is likely to be much better spent
for the benefit of humanity in other ways.
''Yet one hesitates to say anything that obvious in polite society,
lest it offends the gospel according to the greens, which we are all
increasingly expected to acknowledge.''
The debate was dominated by concerns over the disclosure of the
munitions dump at Beaufort's Dyke, reports that between 5000 and 15,000
fuel rods of US origin may be destined for Dounreay, and continuing
uncertainty over Shell's plans to decommission the Brent Spar.
The SNP's spokeswoman, Perth and Kinross MP Roseanna Cunningham, said
the SNP was seeking to highlight the very real concerns which were
uppermost in the minds of the Scottish people.
She said: ''Each one of these is of vital importance to every man,
woman and child in Scotland. They impact on the whole perception of
Scotland as a clean country on which so mmany of our vital industries
depend -- industries such as farming, fishing, food processing, whisky
and tourism.
''They raise questions about the safety of people's lives, the
security of people's jobs and the sustainability of people's communities
-- ''and a view of Scotland as some kind of convenient waste disposal
unit.''
Ms Cunningham called for an urgent investigation into the situation at
Beaufort's Dyke, and a refusal by the pollution inspectorate to grant
any further applications for discharge authorisations at Dounreay.
She also wanted the Government to refuse any application for a licence
for the offshore disposal of Brent Spar, or any other North Sea
installation, until such disposal could be assessed by an independent
authority.
The SNP spokeswoman said: ''Westminster has turned Scotland into the
largest single underwater munitions dump in western Europe, is turning
Dounreay into the world's nuclear laundry, and would be quite happy to
dump 150 Brent Spar installations in the North Sea.''
Labour spokesman John McAllion accused the SNP of ''jumping on the
bandwagon'' and trying to ''hijack'' the issue of the Brent Spar rig.
He said the SNP opposed all dumping at sea of rigs, and Ms Cunningham
had attacked the Government's ''case-by-case'' approach.
However, he claimed, SNP leader Alex Salmond was on the Energy Select
Committee whose 1991 report on decommissioning oil and gas fields, he
said, had ''commended the Government for its case-by-case approach in
the North Sea''.
As a committee member, Mr Salmond had ''also agreed environmental
issues could not be used as an argument against deep sea dumping of
rigs''.
Mr McAllion attacked SNP plans for a nuclear-free Scotland. However,
he warned that privatisation would threaten safety in the industry.
Liberal Democrat Mrs Ray Michie (Argyll and Bute) said that people
living near the Dounreay plant were anxious about the effects on the
environment.
She said: ''Why should Dounreay, why should Scotland, be the recipient
of highly-enriched fuel rods which other countries refuse to accept?
''There has been a failure of communication and loss of confidence
about what is going on there.''
She added: ''Nuclear waste should go nowhere. It should not be
deposited underground, but stored on site, above ground, where it can be
monitored until the time comes when it can be neutralised.''

BRITAIN is a ''magnet'' for illegal immigrants from Africa, Asia, and
Eastern Europe, former Home Office Minister Nicholas Baker said
yesterday.
Poor people are offered passage to Britain and a job in return for
giving up their life savings and even making out IOUs, he said.
Mr Baker, whose responsibilities included immigration until he
resigned last week citing health reasons, said the immigrants were being
exploited by the unscrupulous people who arranged their passage, and
that they were then taking jobs away from British workers.
Mr Baker met a group of young men from Beijing at a detention centre
recently. ''Those Chinese had handed over their life savings and, in
some cases, an IOU which they hoped to pay back in the future,'' he
said.
They had been promised transport in the back of a cross-Channel lorry
and work in a Lincolnshire field for #1.50 an hour.
''They were picked up by our immigration people and they were very
cross they'd been deceived and exploited,'' he said.
Mr Baker said it was impossible to quantify how many illegal workers
were coming into Britain but said there had been a ''serious increase''.
People were also coming into Britain illegally from Poland and Africa
with promises of jobs as cleaners or low-paid jobs in the inner cities
or on farms.

THE cherished image of Scotland's rivers as wild and free is largely
an illusion, a freshwater specialist from the World Wide Fund for Nature
Scotland warned yesterday.
Launching the Wild Rivers initiative in Edinburgh yesterday, Ms
Elizabeth Leighton, WWF Scotland's freshwater policy officer, said much
of Scotland's once common river landscapes had been lost.
As a result, precious wildlife habitats had been destroyed, and the
country had had to pay dearly in flood defence and damage, loss of water
quality, and reduced opportunities for recreation and tourism, said Ms
Leighton.
WWF Scotland is calling on landowners and land users, local and
national government, and all those with an interest in river management
to work together to help prevent further loss to Scotland's natural
landscape.
''From source to mouth, most of our rivers are subjected to a variety
of unnatural influences: straitjacketed by flood defence measures, hydro
power works, and developments such as road building. Some stretches are
poisoned by acidification, nutrient load, and industrial and urban
pollution,'' said Ms Leighton.
The vendace fish had been wiped out in the 1970s, probably by nutrient
overload; the dipper, which feeds on insect life in rivers, was showing
signs of vanishing from streams with a high acid content; and water vole
numbers had declined dramatically due to loss of their riverside
habitat, she said.
Flooding on the Tay in 1993 had cost farmers and the Government #1.3m
in riverbank repairs, and Perth was now proposing to spend #15m on flood
prevention, she added.
Through its campaign, WWF Scotland hopes to collaborate with others to
restore the natural features of Scottish rivers. This will include
ensuring buffer strips exist between crops and watercourses, restoring
floodplain forests, and returning water flows to more ecologically
acceptable levels.
It will also call for a number of major policy reviews, including
improved flood defence planning, statutory controls on water
abstraction, reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in relation to
rivers, and changes to the way freshwater quality is measured.
Professor Desmond Hammerton, former chairman of Clyde River
Purification Board, backed the initiative. However, he said that when he
first started work with the Lothian River Board 37 years ago, the rivers
in the Central Belt had been in an ''appalling condition''.
''They were polluted with mine waste and sewage works that were
overloaded and never designed to satisfactory standards. Many rivers
were devoid of fish life and had been for many decades,'' he said.
The situation today was very different, he said, although there was
still room for improvement.

<TEXT>
A SOCIAL services chief is standing down following accusations that he
misled the Department of Health over problems at a children's home going
back 20 years, it was announced last night.
Northumberland Council leader Ian Swithenbank last night said social
services director John Bennett had applied ''to retire on grounds of
permanent ill health''.
Mr Bennett's decision resulted from last night's publication of an
inquiry report into complaints about the Meadowdale Children's Home at
Bedlington during the 1970s and 80s.
Meadowdale was a specialist home for children with learning
difficulties, including some who had physical disabilities.
The report says the inquiry was widened to look at concerns about
another children's home, Netherton Park at Stannington, following the
1991 ''pindown'' controversy in Staffordshire.
The report defines ''pindown'' as containing ''the worst element of
institutional control -- baths on admission, special clothing, strict
routine, segregation and isolation, humiliation and inappropriate bed
times''.
It says the Northumberland director did not accept the views on
Netherton Park and when he submitted a report to the Department of
Health he said there was ''some cause for concern'' but this ''did not
indicate a regime akin to pindown''.
The fact that Mr Bennett's report expressed an opposite view to the
review team's finding led the council last night to express its
''regret'' to the Department of Health.

ONE of the largest of the new Scottish local authorities will not
participate in the Government's proposed nursery vouchers scheme.
The Labour leaders of the City of Edinburgh Council yesterday rejected
the plan, claiming it was akin to offering baubles to natives before
imposing an alien culture on them.
In lively exchanges at yesterday's policy committee meeting,
opposition Tories retaliated by accusing Labour of ''pulling their cloth
caps down over their eyes'' and refusing to modernise their views.
Education chief Councillor Elizabeth Maginnis stressed that, as a
result of Labour policies, Lothian region was already able to offer a
local authority nursery place to every four-year-old whose parents
wanted it.
''We in Scotland see nursery education as a first step in a programmed
ladder of education. It is not seen as a way of getting middle-class
mums out to work,'' she said.
Mrs Maginnis also claimed the scheme would work against parents whose
children had special needs as the money being offered would not be
enough to pay for such education.
Tory spokeswoman Councillor Beth Brereton said it was ''absolutely
disgraceful'' that Labour were to deprive local parents of #1100 in
vouchers towards the cost of nursery education whether in the public or
private sector.

Strasbourg
FRENCH President Jacques Chirac again out-manoeuvred opponents of his
nuclear test programme yesterday when both the European Parliament and
the European Commission dropped talk of a legal challenge to his
continuing experiments in the South Pacific.
Furious Greens and other anti-nuclear groups, including the SNP,
rounded on the 217-strong Socialist group in the European Parliament for
not immediately contesting legally the Commission's official report on
the tests.
One Conservative MEP, Mr Edward McMillan-Scott, said British Tories
would vote later this week to back the right of the French to conduct
more tests but would do so ''with regret'' because Britain had stopped
the practice.
Earlier, Commission President Jacques Santer had reported to the
Parliament that, in the official view of Brussels, the tests did not
breach the Euratom treaty. He said this was because the experiments were
being monitored adequately in respect of the health and safety of those
in the area and that ionising radiation levels were well below permitted
limits.
Mrs Winnie Ewing of the SNP said it was nonsense to judge the safety
of nuclear tests on radiation levels when the long-term radiation
effects were unknown. ''The proof of that is that survivors of atom test
observers are suing on the basis of illnesses caused to them by
radiation,'' she said.
Dr Allan Macartney, SNP's North East Scotland member, said Mr Santer
had brought relief and joy only to the European right and the
pro-nuclear lobby: ''But it is a great disappointment to the vast
majority of the people of Europe and the world, not least in the South
Pacific.''
Strathclyde East Labour MEP Ken Collins, another fierce critic of the
tests, denied the French were now off the hook in Europe. ''We have not
yet decided what to do next. We will discuss the matter further. We
still have to assess the new data sent to the Commission by the French
and reach our own conclusions on it.''
Mr Collins, chairman of the parliamentary environment committee, had
previously argued there was little doubt that the tests breached the
treaty. After hearing Mr Santer, however, he conceded that the latest
information received by the Commission from the French could change that
view.
He said the Socialist group was likely to call for an independent
investigation of the information supplied by the French Government and
also for international scrutiny of future monitoring.
However, it was clear Mr Chirac had succeeded in heading off legal
moves by the Commission.
Meanwhile, Mr Chirac triggered a new row at home by his decision to
cut France's South Pacific nuclear test programme. His apparent nod to
global outrage seemed to misfire politically.
The opposition Socialist party said the cut, to a likely six from
eight, exposed the hollowness of his rationale for the tests after he
insisted in June that his original plan was irrevocable.
Mr Chirac said in June that eight tests were necessary to check the
reliability and safety of France's atomic arsenal and develop computer
simulation techniques to make future tests unnecessary.

THE new Government-appointed quango which has taken over the running
of water and sewerage services in the East of Scotland is urgently
examining ways of trying to hold down its charges for 1996-97.
Regional councils covering Lothian, Fife, Borders, Tayside, and
Central are currently involved in a transfer of assets to the East of
Scotland Water Authority.
There is private speculation among their water experts that the new
authority might have to levy an increase of at least 15% in charges just
to maintain present commitments.
Such a rise in consumers' bills would be extremely embarrassing for
the Government in the first year it removed water from council control
despite huge opposition to such a policy.
The new public body takes over full control of council-run water and
sewerage services in April next year.
Its chairman, Dr Ian Preston, has already spoken of a substantial
increase in bills for consumers because of the large investment required
to bring the infrastructure up to standards set by the European Union.
Speaking after a meeting of the authority in Edinburgh yesterday, Dr
Preston said: ''We are looking to find ways of holding prices down.''
He emphasised that the authority did not want to increase charges by
an amount which would upset its customers.
The authority was examining very closely the use it could make of the
Private Finance Initiative.
However, he added that a lot of money for investment had to be found
from somewhere, whether the services were run by councils or not.
Dr Preston said nothing could be fixed yet about the charges next year
because of significant financial uncertainties and unknowns.
He added that the authority had a major concern about the timetable
for the approval by the Scottish Office of the transfer of assets
schemes. It was anxious that adequate time and flexibility should be
allowed for it to examine the schemes, so that ESWA could be certain
about the extent of the liabilities which it was taking on from the
regions.

THE Cairngorms Partnership Board will face a critical test of its
conservation policies this week when it examines the controversial
proposals to build the UK's first funicular mountain railway in the
Cairngorms.
On Friday, the board is expected to be asked to consider alternatives
to the railway, part of a #15m development proposal of the Cairngorm ski
centre by Cairngorm Chairlift Company, which opponents of the scheme
claim would do less environmental damage.
Mr Martin Mathers, forest policy officer with the World Wide Fund for
Nature Scotland, said: ''We are waiting with some trepidation for
Friday's meeting. We are very aware that the balance of interests on the
partnership board is finely drawn and that the case against the
funicular has not been properly made.''
He said members of the board would have to bear in mind the visual and
ecological impact of drawing what was the equivalent of a ''single-line
motorway up the side of the mountain'' and the knock-on effects of
allowing such easy access to the summit of so many people every day of
the year.
According to the chairlift company's proposals, the funicular would
carry about 1200 skiers an hour to within 500ft of the summit and would
approach the top station underground via a 250m tunnel. In the summer,
seats would be fitted reducing capacity to about 500 passengers an hour.
The Scottish Wildlife and Countryside Link has set up a working party
to look at the issue and it is urging Cairngorms Partnership Board to
lobby Highland Regional Council for a delay in any planning decision
until it has produced its own strategy for the Cairngorms next spring.

A REPORT on physical abuse at a home for children with disabilities
and learning difficulties led last night to fresh demands for the
prosecution of former staff.
Police have already looked into allegations against former workers at
the Meadowdale Children's Home in Bedlington, Northumberland, and 14
months ago the Crown Prosecution Service decided against court action.
The reason was ''lack of corroborative evidence'' but Northumberland
County Council said last night it would ask the CPS to review this
decision after new information emerged from an independent inquiry.
A damning report by social services expert Bill Kilgallon spelt out a
catalogue of bad practices at the home during the 1970s and 80s.
It referred to abuse involving three members of staff who used
''physical chastisement, particularly on male residents'' and a practice
known as ''knuckling'' -- a blow to the head with a fist
Two other staff members were also said to have struck residents at
times of confrontation.
Leeds-based Mr Kilgallon's report made numerous recommendations for
improving management of Meadowdale and last night the council promised a
review of practices at all nine of the children's homes it runs.
One unexpected development from the publication of the report was an
announcement that social services director John Bennett would be
standing down on grounds of ill health after being criticised in it.

THE managing director of Kwik-Fit Insurance Services was sacked from
his #75,000 a year job after he failed to reveal his previous
involvement with an insurance firm which had gone into liquidation, a
court heard yesterday.
Mr Raymond Connor signed a professional indemnity form without
revealing that he had been a director of brokers Campbell Renfield, Lord
Coulsfield was told.
The finance director of Kwik-Fit Holdings claimed yesterday that when
the allegations were put to Mr Connor, he turned pale.
Following his dismissal in January this year, Mr Connor, a partner in
an Edinburgh legal firm, raised a #50,000 action against Kwik-Fit in the
Court of Session, alleging that his dismissal amounted to a breach of
contract.
Mr Connor, of St Swithin's Cottage, Ninemileburn, Midlothian, is also
asking Lord Coulsfield to declare that Kwik-Fit is obliged to pay him
cash in terms of a share agreement.
Kwik-Fit has raised an action against Mr Connor, asking Lord
Coulsfield for the partial reduction of share transactions made in
favour of Mr Connor.
Mr John Houston, 51, financial director of Kwik-Fit Holdings, told the
court yesterday that Mr Connor approached Kwik-Fit head Tom Farmer at
the end of 1993 with the idea of setting up a company to sell motor
insurance using the Kwik-Fit name.
By November 1994, Kwik-Fit had committed itself to the project and Mr
Connor was employed by Kwik-Fit.
However, Mr Houston said that, the following week, the senior partner
of Kwik-Fit's auditors informed him that Campbell Renfield, the
Glasgow-based insurance brokers, had gone into liquidation in November
1994 and Mr Connor had been a director.
It was pointed out that the consequences of this ''could potentially
be quite severe''.
He asked Mr Connor to meet him on Friday, January 20. Meantime, he
discovered that Mr Connor had filled in a questionnaire associated with
professional indemnity insurance without making any declaration that he
had been a director of a company that had gone into liquidation.
He confronted Mr Connor with the information.
Asked about Mr Connor's reaction, Mr Houston replied: ''He went very,
very pale and seemed to be perspiring quite heavily. He was almost
speechless. I had a feeling that he was perhaps going to fall off his
chair.''
Mr Houston said: ''I made it clear to him that if he did not resign he
would be dismissed.''
He was dismissed with effect from January 27.
Mr Connor said he signed a professional indemnity insurance proposal
form while in the midst of other pressing business matters.
He alleges that the form signing was not the real reason for his
dismissal.
The hearing is expected to last six days.

DOUNREAY management says it is highly likely to win sufficient foreign
contracts to justify the largest reprocessing programme in the plant's
history.
The programme could earn up to #180m in 10 years, helping to offset
the #500m it will cost the Government to decommission the plant's two
fast reactors over the same period.
The work will come from research reactors across Europe and beyond,
which have up to 15,000 rods of spent nuclear fuel stockpiled, having
been earmarked originally for return to the US. Dounreay wants to
reprocess 600 a year for at least five years.
Before that can happen, however, the Atomic Energy Authority must
persuade HM Industrial Pollution Inspectorate to renew Dounreay's
authorisations to dispose of radioactive wastes. In support of its
application to the HMIPI, Dounreay has produced a document describing
its proposed workload over the next decade.
The document stresses that the nuclear waste generated in
reprocessing, or its equivalent in radioactivity terms, would be
returned to the country of origin while the fissile material recovered
could be used again in MTR work.
Financially, the work would be important. The document states: ''The
income to Dounreay from the MTR reprocessing programme could be in the
range of #20m to #90m over the next five years, depending upon the value
of contracts secured. For a 10-year period, the extrapolated value
(cash) is between #40m and #180m (#28.9m to #130m at 6% discount).''
Dounreay also gives HMIPI an assessment of the fraction of
radioactivity which would be attributable to this reprocessing
programme. Over a 10-year period, it would cost #190,000 to eradicate
radioactivity, although the amount of radioactivity represented just
one-fifteenth of the permitted levels.
A spokesman for HMIPI said last night it was expected that its public
consultation on Dounreay's application would begin in the New Year and
be advertised locally. The length of the consultation would depend on
the level of response.
Lochaber councillor Dr Michael Foxley, vice-chairman of Highland
Regional Council's planning committee, said last night that he refused
to accept that Dounreay had planning permission for this scale of
activity.
''The original consent granted by the old Caithness County Council in
1954 was for the erection of an AEA Establishment at Dounreay in the
Parish of Reay,'' Dr Foxley said. ''That was it and we simply do not
believe that can possibly cover importing nuclear waste for
reprocessing. That is why we have told Dounreay to apply for planning
permission, that is why we are taking counsel's opinion.''
Mr George Baxter, of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: ''The
Scottish public should be consulted now on whether they want Scotland
turned into a nuclear dustbin. Dounreay is trying to paint a rosy
picture of what it likes to promote as a normal commercial activity. But
it knows full well that if any such reprocessing contract was signed it
would be met by a huge public protest.''

* A European Commissioner was in the firing line yesterday after
telling the inside story of life at the top in the Brussels bureaucracy.
At a news conference about French nuclear testing in the South Pacific,
Commission President Jacques Santer managed a joke when asked about the
book by Mrs Ritt Bjerregaard: ''I see Mrs Bjerregaard's book is more
radioactive than the nuclear tests.''
* Britain's Euro-budget rebate, worth #2700m a year to taxpayers, is
under new threat from the Brussels Commission. The challenge came last
night from Commissioner Mario Monti who will prepare a report on the
whole system of national contributions to the EU budget. Former Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher won the rebate, arguing for months that
Britain paid far too much.

GARDENER'S Question Time is to be recorded at the Palace of
Westminster in December.
The Radio 4 show was invited by the All Party Gardening Club, set up
by Ayrshire MP Brian Donohoe two years ago.
Another Scot, Paisley Labour MP Gordon McMaster -- a trained
horticulturalist -- will join the usual question time panel of Geoffrey
Smith, Pippa Greenwood, Nigel Colborn, and chairman Eric Robson for the
programme, which will be recorded on December 12 and broadcast on
Christmas Eve.
About 200 MPs and an equal number of Peers are expected to attend and
put questions to the panel.
The programme's producer, Mr Trevor Taylor, said: ''The House of
Commons is surely the biggest village hall of them all.
''But we certainly don't expect any wilting violets.''
Among other keen gardeners in the Commons are: Liberal Democrat leader
Paddy Ashdown, who once won best kept garden in his home town of Norton
sub Hamdon; Labour's Glenda Jackson, who admits bullying her houseplants
to grow; and Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, who has a passion
for collecting trees on his estate.

HIGH winds swept the country last night as gusts of up to 100mph
wreaked havoc on the seaways and highways of Britain, marking the return
of winter with a vengeance.
In Strathclyde, the fire brigade dealt with 60 separate incidents in
two-and-a-half hours, from nine o'clock. They were mostly in the Glasgow
and Hamilton areas where winds gusted up to 81mph.
They involved trees being blown over and damage to property. The fire
brigade asked a local radio station to broadcast messages, saying ''call
us only if it is an emergency''. The brigade was stretched dealing with
10 fires, the biggest involving a factory in Wishaw, where 25 firemen
and five machines were involved in tackling the blaze.
Assistant firemaster David Kennedy, in charge of the operation, said:
''We are being kept very busy. Trees have been blowing down all over the
place.''
The country was battered by the first winter storms three days after
the end of British Summer Time.
More than 250 crewmen on rigs and platforms in the North Sea in an
area 115 miles south-east of Aberdeen were placed on alert when a
5000-tonne barge broke free from her tow-line in a gale.
In Rosslare Harbour, Ireland -- where the highest wind speeds of
110mph were recorded -- a ferry was torn from its moorings and drifted
out of control in the harbour until driven aground.

SIX universities and a further education college will share contracts
worth more than #32m a year to teach Scotland's student nurses and
midwives.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Minister of State at the Scottish Office,
said the contracts were a major step forward in modernising the academic
and professional education of nurses and midwives.
Under the agreement, nursing education will transfer from the health
board-operated colleges to the tertiary education sector.
College staff will transfer to the universities and the FE institution
while teaching will take place in a mixture of premises -- the tertiary
sector, nursing and midwifery colleges, and hospitals.
The Scottish Office announcement was welcomed by the Royal College of
Nursing.
The RCN is confident that the change will give nursing education a
more academic edge, something for which it has been campaigning for many
years.
One of the biggest contracts has been awarded to Napier University in
Edinburgh. It will result in more than 1500 student nurses gaining a
university education in the East of Scotland and Borders.
The full list of contracts to be awarded are:
Glasgow Caledonian University (for the Glasgow area); Paisley
University (for Ayrshire and Arran, and Argyll and Clyde); Bell College
in Hamilton (Lanarkshire, and Dumfries and Galloway); Stirling
University (Forth Valley, and Highland/Western Isles); Robert Gordon
University in Aberdeen (Foresterhill, and Grampian); Dundee University
(Fife, and Tayside); and Napier University (Lothian, and Borders).

THE Very Rev Dr Ronald Selby Wright, a former Moderator of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland who became famous as the ''Radio
Padre'' during the Second World War, has died at his home in Edinburgh.
He was 87.
Dr Wright was minister of the Canongate, the Kirk of Holyroodhouse, in
Edinburgh for 40 years until his retirement in 1977. He was elected
Moderator in 1972. He was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order
(CVO) in 1968.
Born in Glasgow, he was educated at Edinburgh Academy, Melville
College, Edinburgh University, and New College.
He was student assistant at St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh, and
assistant at Glasgow Cathedral before he was called to the Canongate.
During the war, he was senior chaplain of the 52nd Lowland Division
and the 10th Indian Division, and was mentioned in despatches.
As the Radio Padre, he carried out several series of religious
broadcasts for the BBC. He toured all home commands in 1942 and 1943,
the Middle East Force in 1943 to 1944, and transit camps in Italy,
Austria, and Southern Germany in 1945.
He was visiting preacher to several universities, including Oxford and
Cambridge, and was chaplain to the Queen from 1961. He received an
honorary doctorate of divinity from Edinburgh University in 1956.
Dr Wright, a bachelor, had written numerous books.

THE Government last night ordered an emergency survey of Beaufort's
Dyke in the Irish Sea in a bid to allay public fears about explosive
devices being washed up on Clyde coast beaches.
The news was given a warm welcome throughout the area which has been
affected for several years -- most significantly over the past four
weeks -- by the emergence of wartime munitions on beaches and shore
lines along the west coast of Scotland and across the North Channel in
Northern Ireland.
Mrs Ray Michie, MP for Argyll and Bute, in whose constituency a young
boy was injured by a phosphorus flare last week, said: ''I am glad that
Michael Forsyth has responded in this way to growing calls for action
from all parties.''
She gave a graphic illustration of the dangers posed by the devices by
relating the case of the four-year-old boy who picked one up. She said
it ignited before he could throw it away, burning three fingers on his
right hand and the lower part of his right arm. His clothes were also
set alight.
Mrs Michie told the House: ''The following day, the Ministry of
Defence arrived at the relatives' house and without the parents'
knowledge or permission removed the clothes and the container in which
they had been placed.
''They took them away and burned them on the beach, destroying the
evidence. I don't know how significant that evidence was but the mother
is very upset and very worried. No-one has really told her what is
happening.''
The announcement by Scottish Environment Minister Lord Lindsay of the
emergency survey coincided with a Commons debate on environmental
concerns in Scotland, in which fears about a munitions dump at
Beaufort's Dyke were raised.
Lord Lindsay announced that he had ordered the Marine Laboratory in
Aberdeen to begin an environmental survey of Beaufort's Dyke before
Christmas.
The debate was initiated by the SNP, whose spokeswoman, Ms Roseanna
Cunningham (Perth and Kinross), argued that the disclosure of the
munitions dump at Beaufort's Dyke reflected part of the depth of public
concern over the Government's failure to provide proper stewardship of
Scotland's environment.
Scottish Office Minister Raymond Robertson said he was deeply
conscious of the concerns over the phosphorus containers washed ashore
in south-west Scotland and of the concerns to which it gave rise.
He told the House: ''Efforts are continuing to try to find the origin
of these containers and where on the seabed they came from. The video of
the trench-laying operation will be studied carefully to establish
whether it reveals any connection with munitions, if that is what the
phosphorus objects turn out to be.
''Through the Scottish Office's initiative, all the appropriate
Government departments are working together not only to try to get to
the bottom of this incident but also to establish as much as possible
about what munitions were dumped and what they are.''
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, said: ''I
welcome this announcement by the Scottish Office which I hope will go
some way to easing the fears of many of my constituents who live near
the coast or whose work takes them to the shore or on to the sea.''
Councillor Ian Welsh, leader of the shadow South Ayrshire Council,
said: ''This is a victory for common sense and sound and sensible
environmental lobbying which has been carried out by MPs in the area and
other interested bodies.
''There is a danger lurking beneath our seas which affects not only
the local population but those who work on the sea and who visit the
South-west for business or pleasure.''
Councillor Brian Park, who represents Portpatrick on Dumfries and
Galloway Regional Council, said: ''There are genuine worries in this
area about what lies under the sea so near to our shores. I hope that
the survey will provide enough information to ease some of these
worries.
''I also hope that if the survey reveals anything untoward, immediate
action will be taken to ensure that our sea and our shores are made
safe.''
* After a special investigation by The Herald nine years ago, it was
revealed that several million tonnes of bombs, depth-charges, mines,
shells, and ammunition were dumped over a 13-year post-war period in the
half-mile deep Beaufort's Dyke.

PRINCE Charles today will visit some of the worst hit victims of last
December's flooding in Paisley, amid anger that many families are still
in temporary accommodation and a significant number can no longer afford
to refurnish their homes.
The prince will be given a brief tour of Stockholm Crescent to the
south of the town, where water levels of up to 15ft reached the upstairs
floors of several residences and caused 180 households to be evacuated.
He will meet two families who have returned to their old homes and
inspect repair work at the street which he visited 10 days after the
catastrophe last year.
The flood victims' campaign group, South End action committee, said
yesterday that 45 families in south Paisley had yet to return to flood
damaged homes, including 37 from Stockholm Crescent.
The group claims hardship grants averaging #1000, paid for by a public
appeal and distributed to uninsured victims, have been insufficient to
refurnish many homes.
Volunteer Sharon Robertson said: ''It's nice of the prince to come
back but it doesn't repair everything that has happened. People think
that because there was some money raised then everything was fine but it
wasn't even a start.''

CLUTCHING a glass of whisky on his Highland jaunt, Dr Johnson asked,
altogether needlessly, what it was that made a Scot happy.
Yesterday, holding a new book entitled Make Your Own Scotch Whisky, Mr
Bill Bergius provided the self-evident answer to what is guaranteed to
make any Scot drunk with delight.
The book was written by his uncle, Mr Adam Bergius, when he was
chairman of Wm Teacher and Sons.
Mr Bergius said: ''My uncle wrote the text to fill in a long flight
home from Australia. As a master of the understatement, he unfolds the
magic of the process in crafting Scotch malt whisky by referring to
things that touch our everyday Scottish lives.
''Combine this with artist Rowland Emett's inventive depictions and
you have imagery of the Scots production process that is inimitable,
sets the imagination alight, and the lips smiling.''
It is the secret that the whole world, not just Scots, want in on.
Mr Bergius, managing director of Allied Distillers which now owns Wm
Teacher, said: ''People always want to know how to make Scotch whisky.
The Japanese have spent millions on how to learn the secret but have
gone away saying that the distillery manager must be doing something
behind their backs. Most people are still convinced that we are hiding
things.''
Mr Bergius said the secret lies in Scotland's geographical location --
and the book.
The book is written with a large measure of humour which Mr Bergius
said ''was one of the most precious gifts known to man''. That and
Scotch.
Having given a long list of instructions -- including ''constructing a
fireplace at the foot of a small brick tower and sending an onion to
your plumber and asking him to copy it in copper'' -- the book returns
to reality with a bump.
''As you have made it (Scotch) outside the law you will not be allowed
to call it anything and in fact you had better keep very quiet about
it.''
Make Your Own Scotch Whisky is published by Argyll Publishing at #7.99
and is a Scottish Book Fortnight title.
The proprietor of Argyll Publishing, Mr Derek Roger, said the initial
print run had been for 5000 copies. ''The indications are good for the
home market and we would hope to publish it in Japanese next year.''

MARKS and Spencer yesterday admitted that it had withdrawn 80,000
sandwiches from stores across the UK after traces of salmonella were
found at one of the group's main suppliers.
Routine checks at a factory in Northampton revealed traces of bacteria
and it was closed last Wednesday. There is no evidence so far of
customers being affected by the bacteria.
An M &amp; S spokeswoman said yesterday that all of the company's shops in
Scotland were affected by the decision and had been ordered to remove
the products.
The Henry Telfer factory will remain closed until early next week as
extra cleaning and testing takes place. The 600 staff have been sent
home on full pay meantime, after having been given health checks.
Telfer's is sole suppliers of 23 types of sandwich for the store
group, supplying about one third of all its sandwiches, some 400,000
each week. M &amp; S called in alternative suppliers to maintain its range
within its 284 stores.
Martin van Zwanenberg, M &amp; S technical director, said his company and
Telfer's had reacted as quickly as possible once the test results came
through.
''The sandwiches involved had obviously been sold but as a precaution
we decided together with Telfer's first of all to withdraw all the
sandwiches we had on display that Telfer's had made in the previous
week, and also to close the factory.''

SCOTTISH business leaders last night reacted with anger and
incredulity to Government proposals which could mean employers being
fined for hiring illegal immigrants.
The consensus was that businesses should not be used as ''policemen''
to shore up the immigration service. One major employer warned that such
a policy would result in discrimination against job-seekers from ethnic
minorities.
Press reports suggested Home Secretary Michael Howard has won a
Cabinet battle on the issue, and the measure will be announced in the
Queen's Speech next month.
It found no favour in the business community.
Mr John Downie, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said the
proposal was ludicrous: ''This would be a total waste of time and we
don't have a police state yet. It's a political device to divert
attention from Mr Howard's difficulties.''
He said the federation would be writing to Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth, another former Home Office Minister, urging him to stop any
legislation which could affect Scotland.
Mr Iain McMillan, assistant director of the CBI in Scotland, said:
''It is not the responsibility of business to look for illegal
immigrants.
''We would certainly oppose any measure like this, which would only
increase the duties and costs of companies.''
Mr Mohammed Sarwar, a Labour councillor in Glasgow whose wholesale
business, United, employs 200 people, said he found it hard to
comprehend Mr Howard's thinking.
''The Tory Party is supposed to be the friend of business. For years,
they have hit us with taxation, now this. If it comes in, what will
happen is that employers will not take on any applicants from ethnic
minorities, in case it causes problems.''
The Institute of Directors also reacted angrily. Mr Tim Melville-Ross,
its director general, said: ''Business should not be forced to adopt the
role of policeman by Government abdicating its responsibility and
imposing more burdens on business.''
The Home Office confirmed that Ministers were looking at some form of
sanctions on employers of illegal immigrantsbut said no announcement had
been made.
However, a spokeswoman said Britain and Ireland were the only two
countries in the European Union without such sanctions.
Mr Howard is reported to have won his tussle with the Education and
Employment Secretary, Mrs Gillian Shephard, to have the measure included
in the new Immigration and Asylum Bill.
In a leaked letter last month, Mrs Shephard warned that penalties
would discourage employers from taking on anyone from the ethnic
minorities and could increase cases of racial discrimination.
However, Mr Howard is said to have promised Cabinet colleagues that
the new rules would be applied with a ''light regulatory touch''.
He is reported to have secured agreement in principle for the
penalties from the Cabinet's home affairs committee.
Some details are still to be finalised to ensure that the penalties
are not too burdensome on business but the legislation is now expected
to be announced in the Queen's Speech on November 15.
Mr Howard is expected to argue that the new measures will help stop
the exploitation of illegal immigrants who are frequently employed in
sweat shop conditions.
Shadow Employment Secretary Michael Meacher promised to fight the
measure, warning that employers may become reluctant to take on workers
from ethnic minorities.
''I am appalled that the Prime Minister has allowed Michael Howard to
grub for votes by pandering to racism in this shameful way. It
represents another slide to the right in the Conservative Party.''
Home affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, Mr Alan Beith, also
condemned the measure. ''It could be extremely damaging. Anybody with a
black face or odd sort of an accent may stand less chance of getting a
job if an employer is worried about their immigration status,'' he said.
The news was also greeted with dismay by the Joint Council for the
Welfare of Immigrants. Director Claude Moraes said: ''This is a huge
setback for race relations in this country.

THE ministerial car of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth was caught

He was on his way to open Springkerse Business Park in Stirling. Mr
Forsyth was not driving the car.
He was doing paperwork in the back seat while a chauffeur drove him to
the ceremony.
Mr Forsyth's driver now faces a #40 fine and three penalty points on
his licence.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office confirmed the Secretary of State's
car had been caught out by the speed trap camera.
He said: ''Mr Forsyth was being driven to an official engagement in
his official car when it passed through a police surveillance system on
the outskirts of Stirling.''
He added that ''the Secretary of State expects the police to take the
appropriate action without exception in the case of every vehicle which
is recorded as exceeding the speed limit''.
A spokesman for Central Scotland Police said: ''The official vehicle
was detected by a speed camera and action will be taken.''
He refused to say how fast the car was going.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth is to take a broadsword to ''fat
cat'' councils who spend on themselves rather than on services.
Cut one will involve publishing league tables to show the percentage
of money now going on ''administration and jobs for the boys'' under
local government reorganisation.
Cut two will include setting capping levels to ensure ''a proper sense
of proportion'' between hiring expensive officials or improving
services, ranging from extra home helps to innovations in classrooms.
Mr Forsyth, after wielding a five-foot replica of William Wallace's
broadsword at yesterday's opening of the #80m Springkerse business park
in Stirling, announced that league tables would be published soon on how
the shadow councils spend Scottish Office allocations.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities immediately parried the
attack by accusing him of indulging in megaphone diplomacy.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, said that Mr
Forsyth might also care to publish league tables of the salaries of
''fat cat'' chiefs in the privatised utilities.
Mr Forsyth's main thrust -- that councils in Scotland have become
bloated -- coincided with statistics released by a Labour official in
defence of responsibility allowances to several councillors within the
new South Lanarkshire unitary authority.
Labour group secretary Stuart McQuarrie pointed out that the
Government has 14 Whips -- one for every 23.4 Tory MPs -- who are paid
in total almost #300,000 in responsibility allowances.
Mr Forsyth had declared in Stirling that people have got to wake up;
the party really was over. In ''a very tight public expenditure round'',
he wanted to see every penny used to provide vital services. ''One of
the things we'll be doing shortly is publishing details on an
authority-by-authority basis on how much they are actually spending on
administration and jobs for the boys.''
He will be examining ways to separate councils' administrative costs
from those which provide services when it comes to setting capping
levels.
Mr Forsyth added: ''Hiring very expensive chief officers must mean,
given we have finite resources, that money that would otherwise be
available for bath rails for elderly people, or extra home helps, or
repairs to the pavement, or important innovations in the classroom,
isn't there.''
Cosla president Rosemary McKenna said she was very disappointed that
Mr Forsyth -- having asked for ''improved dialogue'' with the convention
-- had chosen to make his announcement in an interview with journalists.
She said: ''If he really wants an improved dialogue, then he should
raise any concerns with us.''
Three South Lanarkshire councillors have been the subject of a
complaint about their basic allowances being increased by #12,000 a year
''to carry out political duties for the Labour group on the council''.
In a statement yesterday, Mr McQuarrie that stressed the full council,
including Conservatives, had agreed the responsibility allowances to
reflect work they would undertake on behalf of the council.
As well as the issue of the Government Whips, he said Mr Forsyth had
appointed a #40,000 speech writer at taxpayers' expense.

A SCOTTISH doctor and mother-of-three has amazed her medical
colleagues by waking from a coma three months after a holiday crash
claimed the life of her husband and left her on a life-support machine.
Last night, the parish priest who led weekly prayers for the devoutly
religious doctor's recovery proclaimed it ''a miracle''.
Dr Fiona Smith was critically injured and was expected to die after a
lorry ploughed into her family's car during a holiday in north-west
France on July 10.
Her husband, Dr James Smith, 41, also a general practitioner, was
killed and the couple's three children Kevin, 7, Fenola, 12, and
Dominic, 14, had to be cut from the wreckage but emerged unscathed.
Dr Smith, 39, was brought back to Scotland in a coma and suffering
from severe injuries.
It was feared she would not recover.
Last week, she surprised nurses and doctors caring for her in a
Lanarkshire hospice by sitting up and asking for her children.
Dr Smith's recovery is tinged with the sadness of her husband's death.
The couple were regular worshippers at St Peter and Paul's Roman
Catholic church in Dundee, where the congregation prayed for Dr Smith's
return to health.
Their children attend Catholic schools in Dundee and both doctors
practised in local health centres there.
Father Pat Gayer, of St Peter and Paul's, said: ''It is a miracle. It
is extraordinary news.
''I understand that her doctors had begun to give up hope -- three
months is a long time. But on Friday she sat up and spoke. It was
completely out of the blue. It is gratifying for us as we have been
holding prayers for Dr Smith every Wednesday.''
A family friend revealed that Dr Smith was now sitting up in bed and
had asked for a tube to be removed from her throat and for a telephone
to call her children.
The official parish newsletter confirmed: ''Fiona Smith has made an
extraordinary breakthrough. She has spoken lucidly and intelligently to
staff and to her family.''
A parish priest travelled from Dundee to Lanarkshire to be with Dr
Smith yesterday.
Father Bernard O'Connor, their parish priest, added: ''Some of our
parishioners think this is miraculous. I prefer to think of it as a
response to prayer. She has regained the power of speech and a major
recovery is expected.''
The Smith family last night issued a statement through Fr O'Connor.
He said: ''Dr Smith was in a deep coma following the accident of July
10. She technically came out of the deep coma three weeks ago but
remained unconscious.
''Then, last Thursday, she began to speak. She spoke to her family
over the phone and the children immediately travelled from Dundee to St
Mary's hospital in Lanark to be with their mother.
''We are all thrilled at the news. It is hoped that she will be moved
back through to Dundee soon but Fiona has brothers and sisters in the
Lanark area who are able to visit her.''
Dr Smith only recently re-entered medicine, having taken time out to
raise her family.
Shortly before the accident, she had been appointed to a practice in
Muirhead, Angus, with responsibility for Invergowrie.

DETECTIVES investigating a riot by fans at a boxing match in Glasgow
earlier this month -- when boxer James Graham was knocked out and died
later in hospital -- are expected to make arrests over the next few
days.
Those arrested are expected to face charges of breach of the peace but
some may be charged with assault.
Strathclyde Police, who were called to deal with the riot at the
Hospitality Inn in Glasgow on October 13 after an emergency call from
hotel staff, received three complaints of assault although more people
sustained injuries. No arrests were made.
The violence erupted after Murray, 25, from Newmains, Lanarkshire, was
knocked out during the British bantamweight title fight by Drew
Docherty, from Condorrat, Dunbartonshire.
Murray died later in Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, on October
15.
Detectives based at an incident room in Stewart Street police office
in Glasgow have been gathering evidence from video footage obtained from
Sky TV, press photographs, and interviews with witnesses at the event.
Many members of the public contacted the police or press to identify
people at the riot scene.
The procurator-fiscal at Glasgow has received a report from
Strathclyde Police into Mr Murray's death.

THE saga of Ally McCoist's wall moved into the next round yesterday
when angry councillors voted to take action against the Rangers and
Scotland star.
At issue, as it has been for some months, was an extension the player
had added to the boundary wall around his home in Bridge of Weir.
Last year, McCoist had sought more privacy for himself and his family
by raising the wall from 1.4m to 2.1m.
Unfortunately, both officials and councillors from Renfrew District
Council declared the player offside -- under conservation regulations --
because the cement used was lighter in colour than the material used in
the original wall.
A senior council planning official, Mr Crawford Russell, attempted to
broker a solution but his efforts failed to achieve a result.
Mr Russell had entered into consultations with McCoist and surprised
councillors yesterday by reversing his original decision and
recommending that the higher wall should remain intact.
He explained: ''With regard to its appearance, I am satisfied the
applicant has tried to match -- as closely as possible -- the type and
size of the materials used in the original wall.''
The councillors responded with the same fervour which McCoist
experiences most Saturdays from rival fans.
First into the tackle was Councillor Jim Mitchell. He said, with a
politician's eye for the pun: ''If we allow this individual to get away
with this, it will be blue murder.
''Mr McCoist may be used to running circles round his opponents on the
football field but he's not getting away with it here.''
The yellow card came from Councillor Paul Mack: ''There is a
fundamental principle at stake here. People, regardless of their
background, must abide by the rules and regulations. If we allow Mr
McCoist to get away with this, it will send out the wrong message to
people.''
Then came the red card, from Councillor William McGuinness, who said:
''If the wall was too high six weeks ago, it must surely still be too
high today.
''We must not allow anyone, including the rich and famous, to think
they can twist this council around their little finger.''
By 18 votes to 10, the planning committee decided to reject the
application for retrospective permission. An enforcement notice will now
be served on McCoist, requiring him to restore the wall to its former
height.
The player chose not to comment yesterday.

THE first indication that injecting drug abuse may be starting to
decline in Glasgow was reported yesterday, writes Alan MacDermid.
Dr Laurence Gruer, Greater Glasgow Health Board's HIV and addiction's
co-ordinator, said the number of people attending needle exchanges in
the city had begun to decrease for the first time since they were set up
in 1987.
The number of new clients at the eight centres fell from 445 in 1993
to 291 in 1994, he said. Total attendances and the number of syringes
issued both fell by about 12%.
''If the reason for this is that fewer people are injecting, and we
will have to establish this, then it points to the success of the
measures we have introduced,'' said Dr Gruer.

<HEADLINE>Joint statement calls for no more instants, an 18 age limit, and jackpots reduced to #1m. Churches unite against lottery</HEADLINE>

THE Church of Scotland yesterday joined churches throughout Britain in
condemning the National Lottery and warning that it threatened to
unleash a gambling epidemic which would hit the poor and the vulnerable.
The Kirk supported a statement issued by representatives of churches
from all denominations at a meeting in London which called for a limit
on jackpot prizes.
However, the Government's response last night, in rejecting the
proposals, was to point out that the churches had already benefited from
around #1m in grants from lottery funds.
The Rev Bill Wallace, convener of the Kirk's board of social
responsibility, who attended yesterday's meeting, said that great
concern had been expressed about the effect of the lottery on our
national life.
''The recent increase in all forms of gambling cannot continue
unchecked without causing serious harm to our communities,'' he said.
Mr Wallace said the delegates were unanimous in their call for the
Government to set up a gambling research council to provide independent,
rigorous, authoritative, and speedy means of research into the extent of
the social and personal harm caused.
There had been a remarkable degree of unity among the representatives
from all the main churches, although individual churches had responded
in different ways, he said.
The delegates called for urgent research to be carried out on all
aspects of the lottery, including the setting up of a gambling research
council.
They wanted, in the meantime, no more licences to be issued for
instant games, the minimum age to play the lottery to be raised from 16
to 18, and jackpot prizes to be limited to around #1m.
The declaration, 24 hours after the controversy over lottery handouts
to charities, came in a joint statement from social responsibility
representatives of the Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland.
The declaration has been signed by representatives of the Church of
England, the Roman Catholic Church, the Methodists, the Salvation Army,
the Church of Scotland, the Baptists, and the United Reform Church,
among others. Representatives of the Quakers and the Unitarian and Free
Christian churches also added their names.
The Department of National Heritage said there was no evidence to show
the National Lottery was harmful.
Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley, who is in a lottery syndicate
with her family, dismissed the churches' concerns: ''If you can get
married at 16, I can see no reason why you should not be able to buy a
lottery ticket.''
Mrs Bottomley said it was highly regulated to protect players'
interests and claimed there was ''no evidence'' to suggest scratchcards
caused ''any significant difficulty''.
Labour, meanwhile, backed the church leaders in calling for a shake-up
in the lottery rules. The Shadow Heritage spokesman, Dr Jack Cunningham,
said that the churches were ''quite right to express concern about the
potential of gambling to damage people's lives''.
A Government source last night defended the lottery and said it was
understood around #1m in grants had already been given to the churches
from lottery funds.
''They have another #19m worth of applications under consideration.
The National Lottery is being blamed for everything at the moment. But
the truth is most people have a good time spending on average about #2 a
week and are happy to raise money for good causes.
''Of course some people will go too far just as some people drink too
much or drive too fast. We are not going to ban alcohol or fast cars
because of the abuses of the few.''
Camelot, the lottery organisers, said: ''It is disappointing the
churches are taking such a negative view.''
It said in a statement that the lottery was enjoyed by 30 million
people each week and had raised more than #1000m for good causes in less
than a year.

JOHN Galliano was named British Designer of the Year last night for
the second year running at the British Fashion Awards.
The designer, recently appointed chief designer at leading couturiers
Givenchy, was ''overwhelmingly'' voted into the top slot for a year of
''resounding success''.
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine presented the award to
Galliano, who also received it in 1994 and 1987, at a ceremony at the
National History Museum, London.
The 35-year-old designer, who studied fashion at St Martin's College,
London, stunned crowds in Paris just last week with a triumphant show of
his own collection. Galliano is to present his first Givenchy show in
January.
Gibraltan-born Galliano, son of a London plumber, has shot to
prominence on the world fashion scene over the last few years and can
now name celebrities including Elizabeth Hurley and Nicole Kidman as
fans.
Other winners at this year's awards included supermodel Kate Moss as
fashion personality and designer Nicole Fahri in the contemporary
collections section.
The award for best retailer went to Oasis. Marks and Spencer won the
classic design award for the second year running and Zandra Rhodes was
rewarded for 20 years in the fashion business with a place in the Hall
of Fame.

THE battle for the Labour Party's Govan parliamentary nomination
intensified yesterday with the disclosure that the son and daughter of
Mr Mohammed Sarwar had been declared ineligible to vote.
It is understood Athif Sarwar, 17, and his sister Faiza, 18, were
disqualified because they were not on the voters' roll, although they
were eligible to join the Labour Party from the age of 15.
However, a source in the camp of Councillor Sarwar, who is contesting
the new Govan seat with two sitting MPs, Mr Mike Watson and Mr James
Dunnachie, said it was likely the Sarwar siblings would be eligible in
the future since neither was aged 18 when the current voters' roll was
compiled.
The disclosure came after a meeting of the Govan party executive to
consider about 180 appeals from ''members'' against being debarred from
voting in December's selection contest.
It is believed that about 60 appeals were rejected, many from Asians.
The outcome is likely to work against Mr Sarwar's campaign.
A spokesman for the campaign said: ''Even if they block every black
member in Govan constituency, Mr Sarwar will still win.''
Supporters of main rival Mr Watson, MP for Glasgow Central which
disappears under boundary changes, are said to be encouraged by the
disqualifications.
An insider said: ''They've assumed they would accuse anyone that
attacked them as being racist. Perhaps they suspected none of their
people would be queried in any way. Many didn't seem to expect the rules
to be applied to them.''
Around 170 people ruled out for arrears in party dues may still be
allowed to vote if they pay up prior to the submission of nominations in
mid November.
Those people declared ineligible have the right of appeal to the
Labour Party's National Executive Committee.

PLANS by Greater Glasgow Health Board to spend more than #270,000 in
private hospitals yesterday provoked accusations that a slush fund was
being used to prop up the independent sector.
The board, which has received #3.1m in a mid-term additional
allocation from the Scottish Office, is going private for 40 heart
operations -- at an average of #6750 each -- in the hope of reducing the
waiting time from twelve months to nine.
The likeliest candidates for the work are the Ross Hall Hospital,
Glasgow, and the HCI hospital in Clydebank. Both have worked extensively
on NHS cardiac surgery contracts in the past.
''It is virtually certain that the local NHS providers will be unable
to deal with these cases,'' acting general manager Tom Divers said
yesterday.
Both the Royal Infirmary and Western Infirmary -- the two NHS
providers of cardio-thoracic surgery for the West of Scotland -- agreed
that they were working to capacity to fulfil their existing contracts.
Both made it clear, however, that if they had been given sufficient
notice at the start of the contract year they would have been able to
meet the new figure.
Mr Sam Galbraith, Labour MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, who
protested when the first contract went to Ross Hall in 1991, said last
night: ''The problem is that money which goes to the private sector is
lost to the NHS and it means you can never deal with the problem. Why
don't we have a long-term plan?
''My view is that HCI is still not viable and that they will do
anything to keep it going.''
Mr Jim Devine, of Unison, said: ''We have to register our concern at
what appears to be an overall strategy to subsidise the private sector.
''At a time when we are being told there is no more money to spend on
health, suddenly there seems to be a slush fund that can be tapped into
to ensure the private sector is financed.
''What is ironic is that many of the consultants who have been telling
patients they are going to have to wait a year are the same consultants
who will be carrying out the surgery in the private sector.''
Board members expressed misgivings when the proposals were tabled at
yesterday's monthly meeting. Profesor Brian Whiting, Dean of Medicine at
Glasgow University, said: ''I presume that forward planning will create
the capacity to allow us not to keep going back again and again in this
way?''
Board officials said the move to reduce waiting times was in response
to pressure from GPs.
More demand was likely to be generated by West of Scotland health
boards outwith Glasgow which have increased their cardiology staffs.
They could be expected to detect more candidates for surgery.
The board also expects to use the private sector for some of the 450
extra plastic surgery cases it is paying for out of the allocation.
A spokesman at the Royal Infirmary said it had been offered the
opportunity to do operations. ''Unfortunately, at this stage in the
year, we are reluctantly unable to take on any more,'' he said.
Last year, the Royal was contracted to carry out 1641 cardiac
operations but carried out 1710, of which 693 were for Greater Glasgow.
An official at Western Infirmary said the hospital was already up to
capacity, fulfilling this year's contract for 920 cases, but added:
''Obviously, the more notice you get the easier it is to change your
targets.''
