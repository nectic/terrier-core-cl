Outspoken clothes designer Vivienne Westwood yesterday gave the
Princess of Wales a dressing-down for her fashion sense.
Ms Westwood claimed the princess, considered by many to be one of the
world's best-dressed women, was ''ruled by the trends''.
''The princess isn't a trendsetter,'' said Ms Westwood, who was a
leading influence in the punk movement and has twice been voted British
Fashion Designer of the Year.
''Perhaps one day she'll come to me. It would be great for her if she
did; you'd see some results.
''I could make her the most stylish woman in the world.''
Interviewed in the latest edition of Woman and Home magazine, Ms
Westwood did not agree the princess could already lay claim to being
stylish.
''Not at all,'' she said. ''I hate her shoes: those horrible little
pumps that are neither one thing nor the other.
''It's as though her clothes are supposed to tell you she's both a
feminist and sexy at the same time. It's a compromise -- and it doesn't
work.''
The princess was ruled by trends which was ''sad because she's a
stunning-looking woman'', said Ms Westwood.
She added that there was something in the Westwood collection for
everyone, ''especially a princess who has every occasion to exploit the
formality of my clothes -- exquisite feminine tailoring and ballgowns''.
Ms Westwood also had some advice for the princess on the handling of
her marriage breakdown.
''If my husband was the Prince of Wales and I didn't get on with him,
I wouldn't let anyone else know,'' she said.
''And I wouldn't leave him. I'd concentrate on what I could do from my
position of power.
''I know Diana has a good heart. I respect what she does for charity,
but I do feel someone in so privileged a position has a responsibility
to support art and culture.
''It doesn't matter to me whether the Royal Family exists or not,''
said Ms Westwood, who has collected an OBE from the Queen.
''But as they do, the one legitimate view they could express is about
something I'd call civilisation.
''Most of the Royals seem to have forgotten that. They've been too
busy trying to be middle-class, having their photographs taken on the
lawn with their corgis -- just like Sid and Doris in Neasden.''
* Ms Westwood's final word was on people who wear trainers. Whenever
she saw someone wearing them, a little bell went off in her head saying:
''Brain damage.''

SPRINGBOK captain Pienaar offered an olive branch to South Africa's
rugby chiefs last night, claiming that remarks by Transvaal RU chief
executive Johan Prinsloo that the players were seeking a total of #2.5m
for 26 players per season were untrue.
''We are looking for security, that's all,'' said Pienaar. ''So we
asked for more basic pay and less per match, because if I break a leg
tomorrow I won't be able to play for three or four months. That means I
won't get that income.
''We want to play for the (Transvaal) union. We'll be at training on
Monday.''
Earlier, South Africa's national administrators told Pienaar and 12
other players to think again on their demands for better pay and
conditions.
The TRU dropped the 13 players after they refused to train until their
grievances had been resolved.

CELTIC will be seeded in the European Cup-winners' Cup and, therefore,
miss the preliminary round of the tournament. Instead, the Scottish Cup
holders will go straight into the first-round draw.
The Parkhead club's position will be ratified by UEFA at their meeting
on July 11, just 24 hours before the preliminary round draws, which will
involve Scotland's three other European representatives, Rangers in the
Champions' Cup and Motherwell and Raith Rovers in the UEFA Cup.
Yesterday a UEFA spokesman explained: ''The task force set up to
monitor countries where there may be trouble have advised that
Yugoslavia should be banned from taking part in our tournaments.
''Therefore, at present the Yugoslav clubs who have been put forward
are out. That situation will remain until July 11, when the
competitions' committee meet in Geneva. It would seem certain that they
will agree with that recommendation and that would mean Celtic becoming
the sixteenth-ranked club and, therefore, going straight into the
first-round draw.''
At Parkhead, manager Tommy Burns welcomed the likelihood that his side
can avoid the potential hazards of a preliminary-round game.''This gives
our fans a glamour start to a European campaign,'' said Burns. ''Going
back into Europe in some style is important to this club.''
It is also important that Celtic will consequently miss out on
potentially dangerous encounters in the first round. It seems likely
that they will not be asked to face, for instance, holders Real Zaragoza
in their opening game in September. Nor will they line up against
Juventus or Paris St Germain or Everton when the draw is made on August
25.
Celtic also can look forward to the planned pre-season clash with
Liverpool, which would have been axed if they had been forced to play in
the preliminary round. That match can now go ahead on August 10.
The troubles in Yugoslavia should also keep Red Star Belgrade out of
the Champions' Cup and they were one of the major obstacles Rangers
could have faced in their preliminary-round tie.
Meanwhile, Motherwell and Raith Rovers will be among the 'seeded'
clubs in the preliminary round of the UEFA Cup. This will give them what
should be relatively easy draws. Both clubs will be in qualifying
sections formed on a geographical basis to cut down travelling distances
for clubs involved at the earliest stages.

ANDRE Agassi, colourful though he is, is not one to brag. But the No.1
seed believes he is playing well enough to again win the Wimbledon
title.
To repeat his 1992 victory, Agassi has first to beat three-times
champion Boris Becker in a semi-final this afternoon, and then either
reigning champion Pete Sampras or Goran Ivanisevic in Sunday's final.
It is a case of one great baseliner against three outstanding
serve-and-volley specialists, but Agassi is hitting the ball so well his
confidence has never been higher.
However, he has sounded a note of caution: ''Guys like Boris, Pete,
and Goran can upset all your plans by serving 34 or 35 aces, and if you
can't get to the ball you can't return it.
''I think that if I can get my racket on to enough balls I can give
them all trouble. But to win Wimbledon you have to be playing your best
tennis and have your share of the luck.''
Agassi will be favourite against Becker, even though the German is
playing in his eighth Wimbledon semi-final. Becker won the last of his
three titles six years ago and has lost a little of his dash. And it may
not be the booming who defeated Frenchman Cedric Pioline in five sets.
The German knows he will have to go to the net at every opportunity if
he is to upset Agassi. ''Andre is the best baseliner in the game,'' said
Becker, ''so it would be foolish of me to stay back a lot. I have to
attack. I'm having no trouble with my calf injury and hopefully I can
stay out there as long as it takes and hit the final shot.''
The other semi-final will be the third Wimbledon clash between Sampras
and Ivanisevic, and they are tied at one-all. The Croatian left hander
beat Sampras in a '92 semi but lost in last year's final.
Sampras, bidding for his third successive Wimbledon title, is expected
to win but Ivanisevic, with his superb service, can be either brilliant
or disappointing.
But the American is not happy with his game. ''If I want to continue
in the tournament I need to serve better,'' said Sampras. ''I've got to
improve my first serve percentage and be more aggressive with my second.
There aren't going to be too many rallies against Goran but I hope it's
not dull.''
Ivanisevic has a reputation for being temperamental, but says:
''Against Pete, I'm just going to try and keep my head clear, and if I
do I can play better than I did against him in the final last year.
''Last year he just played too good but I don't think he can play
again like that. It's better, too, to meet him in the semis. There will
be less pressure than in the final.''

<TEXT>
BRITISH athletics officials won a Pyrrhic victory when they announced
they had settled their contractual dispute with Linford Christie -- but
then admitted their leading attraction would not be competing at
tonight's London grand prix.
Christie, the Olympic and world 100 metres champion, plus world high
hurdles champion Colin Jackson and world 200m silver medallist John
Regis have been in dispute with the British Athletic Federation over
their participation in domestic meetings.
At a news conference yesterday, BAF spokesman Tony Ward said the
federation had now reached agreement with the athletes' management
company.
But he then announced both Christie and Regis were too tired to
compete at Crystal Palace after running two races each at Wednesday
night's Lausanne grand prix, while Jackson was still recovering from a
throat infection.
Neither Ward nor the athletes' agent, Sue Barrett, would comment on
the terms of the agreement, but they are now comitted to compete in
three domestic meetings, plus the national championships in Birmingham
on July 15 and 16.
Christie's absence tonight is an obvious embarrassment to the BAF, who
admitted they had sold ''in excess of 10,000 tickets'' only for a venue
which can accommodate 17,000.

IT was a far from confident Steffi Graf who reached her seventh
Wimbledon final in nine years after having flirted with disaster against
Jana Novotna on Centre Court yesterday.
The world No.1 recovered from a set and a break down to reach
tomorrow's final against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who earlier ended the
reign of fellow Spaniard Conchita Martinez.
''Inside I felt I was going to lose,'' said Graf. ''At the beginning
of the third set I thought I would have to wait another year. Things
didn't look good for quite some time and I was glad to get through. I
was really fighting out there.''
Novotna attacked from the start, racing into the net to upset Graf
with a series of searing volleys. The German was unusually tentative,
her service erratic with five double faults. She looked a shadow of the
player who decided she could not play better than in her second set
quarter-final victory against Mary Joe Fernandez.
When Novotna took the opening set and then broke at the start of the
second, things looked grim for Graf, who went into the match having
dropped only 17 games in her five Wimbledon matches. But she showed
champion quality as she clawed her way back with new rhythm and power in
her fierce forehand crosscourt winners.
Even a headache failed to disturb her. She called for the trainer,
took two tablets, before breaking Novotna for a 5-3 lead. ''I didn't
feel confident,'' said Graf. ''I just tried to hang in there and I was
happy to turn it around from a set and a break down.''
She might have had the headache, but it was Novotna who felt the pain
after having squandered another winning Wimbledon position against the
top seed, who clinched a hard-earned two hour victory 5-7, 6-4, 6-2.
The Czech wept on the Duchess of Kent's shoulder after the 1993 final,
but yesterday she refused to be despondent. ''I was laughing and smiling
all the time,'' she said. ''It was one of the best matches I have played
against Steffi since the 1993 final. I didn't feel like crying at all.
It was a wonderful match and I enjoyed every minute.''
Martinez defeat was, quite literally, a painful experience. The
champion seldom looked happy on Centre Court, and the discomfort she
suffered because of a blister on her left foot clearly affected her
performance in only her second defeat in the last 33 matches.
Sanchez Vicario reached the final with a 6-3, 6-7, 6-1 victory which
was played out in humid, stifling conditions which must have reminded
both players of their home country.
The winner, whose previous best effort in the Championships was
reaching the last eight, is in the final at last in her ninth Wimbledon
year. And although injury played a part in her avenging triumph for
Martinez's victory over her in the Italian Open in Rome in May, she
thoroughly it.
''I should have won in two sets,'' she claimed after having reached
her third Grand Slam final this year, ''but at 5-2 up in the second and
4-1 in the tie-break, I got a little tentative.
''I had to tell myself again to stay aggressive and to keep to the
tactic I decided on at the start. I always planned to attack, stay
patient, and get in to the net when I could. I wanted to keep moving her
around and I enjoyed playing against her.
''In the end I did what I had to do and it's a wonderful feeling to
reach a Wimbledon final -- a dream come true. It will be another one if
I can become the second Spanish player to win it.''
Martinez needed the trainer twice during the extended three hour match
to attend her painful foot. The first time-out came after only seven
games, with Sanchez Vicario a break up after having captured a nervous
opponent's serve at the start -- only to immediately surrender the
initiative.
And although Martinez battled on her second visit from the trainer
came just four games from an inevitable end.
''I just did not believe in myself enough -- even after winning the
second set,'' said Martinez. ''Sometimes you get these feelings although
it doesn't always mean you are going to lose. But I also made too many
mistakes and didn't play the right game whereas she was very good.''
Martinez said that her blister problems stemmed from the quarter-final
win over Gabriela Sabatini, but refused to use them as an excuse. ''I
have blisters all over the foot now,'' she said. ''I had some after the
match with Gabi and had them taped, but they became painful again and I
had them retaped in the match today. Now I've got new ones. It's painful
to run but you have to live with that.''
In the mixed doubles, Martina Navratilova's hopes of narrowing the gap
on Billie Jean King's titles record were left in the balance when bad
light halted play last night.
Navratilova, two Wimbledon wins short of King's record of 20, and her
partner Jonathan Stark were one set all in their quarter-final against
Sandon Stolle and Mary Joe Fernandez.
The winners of this match will meet Mark Woodforde and Larisa Neiland,
straight-sets winners against Andrew Florent and Catherine Barclay.
* STEFFI Graf certainly impressed the bookmakers who now make the
German 1-3 to beat Aranxta Sanchez Vicario tomorrow, with the Spaniard a
9-4 chance.
* MARTIN Lee's hopes of success in the boys' event ended yesterday
when he was beaten 6-2, 6-3 by Mexican Alejandro Hernandez.

RUGBY
SCOTTISH rugby could be on the verge of club payments to players and a
cash boost for international stars.
England captain Will Carling has stated that his international
colleagues could be paid professionals by the end of the year. Incoming
RFU secretary Tony Hallett yesterday agreed -- but said the sum
available to players might be just half of the #50,000 estimated by
Carling.
Scotland international wing Scott Hastings, agreeing with Carling, has
forecast ''enormous'' changes in Britain -- ''Scotland included'' -- and
that the SRU would give stars a cut of international gate money.
As businessman John Connor prepares to spend #150,000 to bring three
top New Zealanders, including All Blacks' captain Sean Fitzpatrick, to
Watsonians -- Hastings' club -- Edinburgh rivals Heriot's are
considering a package of rewards for their first-team squad.

Madrid, Thursday
PRIME Minister Felipe Gonzalez today bowed to pressure from political
allies and opposition and announced he was prepared to consider calling
an early General Election.
At a news conference after a meeting of his Socialist party executive,
Gonzalez ruled out elections during Spain's six-month presidency of the
EU, which began only a week ago.
''When we have completed all the activities of this semester, we are
prepared to consider opening discussion on an electoral calendar to
include the possibility of bringing elections forward to the first half
of 1996,'' the Prime Minister said.
He said the issue could be discussed with the Socialists' political
allies, the Catalan nationalists, and others.
The precise timing would depend on the degree of parliamentary
stability, he said. Elections could be called in the spring or autumn of
next year or even at the official end of the legislature in mid-1997.
Rocked by a series of corruption scandals -- the most recent involving
secret-service bugging of telephones, even that of King Juan Carlos --
Gonzalez has faced repeated demands from opposition parties for early
elections.
He added that he hoped his statement ''will help to calm the political
life of the country''.
Pressure on Gonzalez reach fever pitch with revelations four weeks ago
that the military intelligence unit CESID had for years bugged the
mobile phones of leading public figures including the king.
Despite insisting that the government neither ordered nor knew of the
bugging, Gonzalez was forced to accept the resignations of his Defence
Minister and deputy premier.--Reuter.

YOU reported the 50th birthday of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the
National Democratic Party in Burma or Myanmar, who has been under house
arrest since 1989 (June 20).
The ruling junta agreed to hold multi-party elections for the first
time in 1990 and Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory. However, the
junta completely ignored this and Suu Kyi remained under house arrest.
Fifty years ago Suu Kyi's father Aung San was a major-general in
command of the Burma National Army under the Japanese. He had become
disenchanted with his masters and contacted General Slim after the fall
of Mandalay in March 1945. Slim liked him and agreed that the BNA should
join his Fourteenth Army.
Aung San later met Admiral Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander in
South-east Asia, and the two men established a great rapport.
Aung San seems to have been a young man of considerable ability and
charisma. After the war ended he became Prime Minister of Burma under
the British. In January, 1947, he met Mr Attlee in London when it was
agreed that Burma would become independent within one year.
In an election in April he won 196 out of 200 seats. On July 19, he
and six colleagues were assassinated in the council chambers in Rangoon.
Even then he was only 33.
In January, 1948, Burma became independent and broke away from the
Commonwealth. How different things might have been if Aung San had still
been at the helm. The Karens would probably not have suffered the
persecution described so vividly by Andrew Drummond in The Herald in
February.
Aung San Suu Kyi seems to have inherited her father's ability and
charisma. Her party won an election. She should be given the chance to
save her country.
This year, 1995, the 50th anniversary of her father joining up with
the Fourteenth Army, and the 50th anniversary of VJ Day and the end of
the Second World War, would seem a most appropriate year for her to be
given this chance.

I FOUND Anvar Khan's high profile article on George Michael, ''the
frankly hirsute member of Wham!'', whose vow of silence ''meant
immediate anonymity'', both glib and barely comprehensible (July 3).
More importantly, I was appalled by the snide suggestion that the Aids
ribbon Michael wears in support of an infection ''which still doesn't
kill as many people as heart disease'' betrays a lack of perspective.
What perspective is Anvar Khan talking about? Globally, heart disease
may win the ratings war for now but that does not make the thousands of
deaths from Aids in this country, or the millions of cases of HIV
infection worldwide, any less tragic.
Aids ribbons are not about perspective but about awareness and
education for those who can be protected, and about respect for those
for whom it is too late.
If by wearing one George Michael makes even one person ask, ''What's
that about?'' and learn from the answer, then it has been worth the hole
in his jacket lapel.
I wear a ribbon for that rason and as a mark of respect for my late
partner who died after a long and painful illness last year.
If Anvar Khan wants to provide me with a heart disease ribbon then I'm
more than happy to do the same for my late father.

IN Weekender Paul Young complains of a very natural and excusable
action by his wife at the oars on a fishing outing (July 1).
Let me tell you of an incident by my future wife which in a less soft
and mild-mannered man would have led to a cancelled betrothal.
Trolling for big trout with the flies 20 yards behind the boat, I was
tugging heavily at the oars into a strong west wind off a lee shore with
extensive weed beds.
There came a sudden squall with a smirr of rain that left me peching
heavily just to steady the boat . . . and what did she do? Forced open
an outsize golf umbrella!

* AMERICAN vibraphonist Joe Locke has proved to be one of the richer
sources of anecdotes at this year's jazz festival. The flamboyant
player, with the equally flamboyant wardrobe and hairdo, was meant to be
guesting at fellow mallet man Anthony Kerr's set on Sunday night, but he
pulled out in order to participate in a recording date with a Scottish
band. Now, if it had been a jazz band, this excuse might just have been
acceptable. But no, he stood Kerr up for some rock-folk outfit called
Runrig.
The band at the McEwan's Old Fruitmarket from 7.30 tonight, however,
are definitely jazz and 100% Scottish. With an impressive line-up
including Bobby Wellins (tenor sax), Bruce Adams (trumpet), Gordon
Campbell (trombone), Jay Craig (baritone sax) and Jim Mullen (guitar),
the title Scottish All Stars is undoubtedly justified. Backed by the
Strathclyde Youth Jazz Orchestra, the All Stars will be performing the
world premiere of composer-in-residence Bobby Wellins's Images of

CHANGES were demanded, and Scotland's selectors have performed major
surgery rather than the usual tickle treatment to cure the international
side's ills.
The Scots squad to defend the Triple Crown title in Northern Ireland
in a fortnight was named yesterday, and the changes started from the
top, with Alastair Storie axed as skipper, replaced by George Salmond.
The installation of Salmond as captain is a move for the future. Next
year, Scotland compete in the mini-World Cup for the first time. And the
man to give the side leadership and direction has to be given a chance
to settle.
''It goes without saying that I'm delighted'' said Salmond. ''It's an
exciting time, with the World Cup coming up, and a great time to be
involved with Scottish cricket -- even better as captain.
''I'll have a talk with the boys, just to tell them what's expected
overall. But I just can't wait to get started.''
Three games in as many days later this month against fellow amateurs
from England, host country Ireland, and Wales will give Salmond a short,
sharp taste of what is expected from his new-look side, which includes
two uncapped players in Bryn Lockie and Scott Gourlay.
''You have to reward people for putting in the effort and that's
exactlywhat we've done with the two new lads,'' said Jim Love, director
of cricket. We've known about Bryn for a few years and eventually you
have to take a look at them at a higher level.
''But no-one is guaranteed a place. Players will have to prove
themselves when they get the chance.''
With Storie dropped along with Gordon McGurk -- after his failures
against the West Indies and Notts -- Lockie makes his first appearance
in the senior set-up after having scored runs on a regular basis for
club and district.
Mike Smith is ruled out because of work commitments, so Uddingston pro
George Reifer is recalled.
This season, the Scots have tried three wicket-keepers -- the injured
David Haggo, out-of-form Donald Orr, and Iain Philip, whose primary task
is to open the innings with Bruce Patterson.
Now, for the Belfast trip, they will try a fourth stumper, with Alec
Davies of Grange -- last capped against Sussex in 1994 -- given another
opportunity to turn domestic form into a regular international place.
Changes, too, in the bowling department, with Scott Gourlay a new
addition. Freuchie club-mate David Cowan is omitted having yet to prove
his fitness, while a healthy Kevin Thomson also is included. Squad:
G Salmond (Arbroath) captain, B M W Patterson (Ayr), I L Philip
(Stenhousemuir), G N Reifer (Uddingston), M J D Allingham (Heriot's) S J
Gourlay (Freuchie), B G Lockie, J W Govan (both Carlton), I M Stanger, J
G Williamson (both Clydesdale), K L P Sheridan (Poloc), K Thomson
(Strathmore).

SCOTLAND'S bowlers finished their home international campaign in
Llanelli yesterday with a 124-97 victory over Ireland, but while that
puts them top of the table, they look certain to be overtaken by England
and Wales tomorrow.
The Scots finished two points clear of Ireland with a shots aggregate
of +52 while Wales are on +50 and England on +43.
Both, however, have comparatively easy looking matches this morning
with the hosts facing the Channel Islands and England meeting Ireland.
Scotland's biggest win came from Willie Wood, who broke his duck for
the series with a 32-10 win over Sammy Allen.
George Adrain added a 21-14 win over Paul Smyth, John Aitken held on
to beat Charlie Davis after having dropped 10 shots over the last four
ends, and Niall Currie and Gary McCloy figured in a 17-17 draw.
On the two remaining rinks, Raymond Logan lost 21-19 to Ernie
Parkinson and Richard Corsie went down 17-16 to Noel Graham.
The star of Wales' win over England was Spencer Wilshire, who crushed
world indoor champion Andy Thomson 31-10. Results (Scots first):
Scotland 124, Ireland 97 (J Aitken 19, C Davis 18; W W Wood 32, S
Allen 10; N Currie 17, G McCloy 17; G Adrain 21, P Smyth 14; R Logan 19,
E Parkinson 21; R Corsie 16, N Graham 17).
Wales 126, England 124.

ROYAL Gourock's Keith Lawrence sailed himself to within grasping
distance of the Etchells UK National and Open championships title as he
won yesterday's penultimate race on the Clyde.
Sailing Playback, Lawrence closely followed the strategy dictated by
his Olympic team crew, Andy Hemmings and Stuart Childerly, and opted to
cross the start line slightly late to avoid trouble and ensure an option
on the preferred right-hand side of the first leg.
This proved decisive for they were ahead by the first buoy and went on
to take first gun by some 30 seconds from Poul Richard Hoj Jensen's
Danish Blue.
In the veering south-westerly breeze, which continued to shift in
direction enough to prompt a decision to reduce the three-circuit race
to just two laps, Lawrence's nearest rival in the overall standings, Tim
Law finished third and trails only threequarters of a point behind
overall.

AMERICAN interest rates have been cut for the first time in nearly
three years in an effort to bolster a flagging domestic economy.
On Wall Street shares prices soared taking the Dow-Jones index to a
fresh record close, but the dollar drifted lower.
Last night the Federal Reserve Board, the US equivalent of the Bank of
England, cut a key short-term interest rate. It reduced the Federal
funds rate by 0.25% to 5.75%. But the discount rate the central bank
charges commercial banks was left unchanged at 5.25%. The Bank of Canada
followed the Fed's lead.
After the Fed move, several US banks announced a cut in their prime
rate to 8.75% from 9%.
The Fed said: ''As a result of the monetary tightening initiated in
early 1994, inflationary pressures have receded enough to accommodate a
modest adjustment in monetary conditions.''
On past form it is unlikely to be the only reduction in rates before
they stablise or go up again. The last cut in the Fed funds rate was in
September 1992.
The Fed's decision does not herald lower interest rates in the UK,
though the American experience may reinforce hopes that British interest
rates are close to their peak.
In a speech in London last night the Governor of the Bank of England,
Eddie George, who clashed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth
Clarke, on the need for an increase in rates, said: ''Our disagreement
in May was in fact a rather narrow one. It is perfectly reasonable for
reasonable people to take different views on the tactical policy action
needed to achieve the given inflation objective.''
Financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic had spent the day
waiting for the Fed to make up its mind. Though Wall Street traders had
anticipated the cut Fed watchers were deeply divided on the likely
outcome.
Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty First Advisers Inc in New
York, had described the chances of a cut as 50/50 while the Federal Open
Market Committee, which began its meeting on Wednesday night, was still
in session.
In deciding to cut rates analysts said the central bank had taken out
an insurance policy to guard against the risk of the economic slowdown
developing into a recession.
American interest rates have been on hold since February when the Fed
imposed its seventh hike in a year in a bid to slow the economy down and
prevent it overheating.
It succeeded in its quest, perhaps to a greater extent than it would
have liked. The Commerce Department had reported earlier in the day that
the Government's main economic forecasting gauge dropped for the fourth
consecutive month in May, the longest string of declines since the onset
of the last recession.
Some analysts had expected the FOMC to hold off cutting rates and
instead give Mr Greenspan leeway to act on his own should the economy
show further signs of weakness before it next meets in August.

<HEADLINE>Share prices shrug off latest review by regulator. Littlechild puts an end to electricityuncertainty</HEADLINE>

RECENT underperformance of shares of the 12 English electricity
distribution companies should now come to an end following the new
pricing formula laid down by the regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild
which is not as bad as the pessimists had feared.
That said they still look tough, with the companies compelled to
reduce charges by a further 10%-13% in real terms next year followed by
a limit on increases of inflation minus 3% for each of the subsequent
three years. The earlier regime called for cuts of between 11% and 17%
for 1995/96 -- which still stand -- and price rises subsequently limited
to inflation minus 2%.
The new regime does not affect the two Scottish electricity companies,
whose distribution and supply businesses were reviewed last year.
Share prices of the dozen recs as they are called were very strong
ahead of the report which on Stock Exchange insistence had to be issued
a day earlier than expected when strong rumours of what it contained
went round the market. They dipped when details of the regulator's
review came out but later strengthened again. Only East Midlands and
Manweb ended the day lower.
The shares should certainly be steadier now but do not look a raging
buy. The movements yesterday reflected relief that the uncertainty was
out of the way, though this is not quite the case for companies have the
right to ask for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to investigate if
they think they have been treated unduly harshly by the regulator.
Most companies said that they would study the proposals before
commenting. But Seeboard said its recent price reductions -- which
infuriated the rest of the industry -- would meet the new controls until
March 1997.
Opinion is somewhat divided on the impact the new formula will have.
There is relief that there will be no clawback of past profits and that
the allowable rate of return on capital spending will remain at 7%.
The new regime will undoubtedly check profits growth severely. But
this does not mean to say dividends cannot continue rising strongly for
several more years. The companies are buying back their shares for
cancellation so reducing the cost of dividends.
They have very strong balance sheets with gearing of around 15%.
Analysts reckon they could continue to raise dividends by 5% or so in
real terms per year and such a prospect will give good support to the
shares, though hopes for predatory action will be reduced.
It is to be hoped that having botched his original price regime
Professor Littlechild has now finally made up his mind and will not
propose yet another review next year so that companies can plan better
for the future and analysts can more accurately gauge the value to put
on the shares.
The original review of August 1984 was supposed to last five years but
last March Professor Littlechild stunned the market, incidentally almost
scuppering the sale of the rest of National Power and PowerGen in the
process, by announcing that he would review prices again.
The trigger for this change of mind was the Trafalgar House bid for
Northern Electric in which the latter, as a last ditch defence, offered
to repay no less than #565m to shareholders. The regulator's argument
ran that if it could afford such as massive payment then the price
regime was clearly too lax.
This certainly seems to have been borne out by the recent results
season for the recs. Profits appeared to be ahead by a modest 13% on
average but this was after various exceptional charges and what really
stood out was the 23% surge in dividends, against a market average
barely into double figures. Clearly the pendulum had indeed swung too
far towards shareholders as opposed to customers.
Why the regulator could not have foreseen this earlier given the staff
he has under his command and the information he can get from the
companies is something of a mystery.
Despite the heavy job cutting of recent years most of the companies
plan to trim their workforces further, which indicates that there are
more efficiency gains to be had and the new formula will concentrate
minds further, particularly as the more ambitious plans to develop
non-regulated activities have been shelved or have just failed.
Experience so far suggests that although having activities outside the
clutches of the regulator is tempting the companies are better off
sticking to what they know best and trying to squeeze as much cost out
as possible.
The new formula will make takeovers much less likely but predators
could still be attracted by the steady profits stream the companies
represent, particularly as they will now cost less to buy.
However the problem here is the next election and the probable change
of government which will follow. Labour is pledged to crack down on the
utilities and while the bark may well be less than the bite, depending
on how the companies are performing by the time of the election, it
means further uncertainty.
Another uncertainty which will come in 1998, a year after the last
date for the election, is the planned full deregulation of the industry,
which will allow even domestic consumers to choose their power supplier,
unless of course a Labour Government decides otherwise. The industry is
dragging its feet over preparing for this, despite the vast salaries it
awards its directors.
It made something of a pig's breakfast over last year's deregulation
which extended choice down the size scale for industrial and commercial
customers. Similar choice extended to the much larger domestic sector
could result in chaos. There is however always opportunity in chaos and
it would probably trigger takeover activity, both within the sector as
the more efficient companies gobbled up the incompetents and from
without by companies with more experience of a competitive consumer
market.
Professor Littlechild's new formula can only reinforce the trend
towards a tougher stance by the regulators in general. There is little
doubt they have been too lenient in the past, from the consumer's
viewpoint, and are showing signs of wanting to make up for past
failings. The prospect of a Labour Government can only encourage the
trend.

VENERABLE Tom Watson called upon all of his experience playing in
tough conditions to grab the first-round lead at the $2m Western Open in
Chicago yesterday.
The five-times Open champion, renowned as one of the game's great
bad-weather players, meticulously plotted his away around the Cog Hill
course in extremely strong winds which gusted to more than 40mph.
He carded a four-under-par 68, with four birdies in the last six
holes, to lead by one stroke from fellow Americans Ed Fiori, Jay Haas,
Joel Edwards, and Steve Lowery, and Australian Brett Ogle.
Former Masters champion Fred Couples, striving to return to form after
a nagging back injury, is two shots behind.
''It was a tough day to play but I had a good, solid round,'' said
Watson, who had one birdie and one bogey on the front nine to turn at
even par.
He was still even with six holes left -- but produced three straight
birdies from the thirteenth, and another at the seventeenth, to vault to
the front.
''I'm always happy to see the wind blowing, because it doesn't become
a putting contest in the wind. It's more of a chess game,'' continued
Watson, who will return to St Andrews, where he almost won in 1984, for
the Open in a fortnight.
''It's always great to have the rest of the field chasing you. I just
want to get a win under my belt soon.''
Watson, now 45, has won eight major championships and 32 US Tour
events, but his only victory since 1987 came at the 1992 Hong Kong Open.
He has endured a well-publicised battle with the putting yips -- but
he did not miss any short putts yesterday. Leading scores (US unless
stated):
68 -- Tom Watson.
69 -- Ed Fiori, Jay Haas, Brett Ogle (Australia), Joel Edwards, Steve
Lowery.
70 -- Fred Couples, Justin Leonard.
71 -- Bob Gilder, Guy Boros, Ronnie Black, Mark Calcavecchia, Scott
Simpson.
Others included:
73 -- Vijay Singh (Fiji), Davis Love.
74 -- Corey Pavin.
75 -- Nick Price (Zimbabwe), Ernie Els (South Africa).
76 -- Ian Baker-Finch (Australia).

Pitch was prepared perfectly - for tourists
CRICKET: THIRD TEST
EDGBASTON groundsman Steve Rouse laid the blame squarely at England's
door last night for a startling third Test collapse on a pitch made to
measure for the West Indies quick bowlers.
And England chairman Ray Illingworth saw his request for a true, fast
surface blow up in his face as Mike Atherton's men were shot out for
just 147.
By the close, West Indies were 104 for one in reply, and England's
series-levelling victory at Lord's was proving to be merely just another
false dawn.
To make matters worse, Jason Gallian's first Test innings of seven
included him suffering a hairline fracture to the middle finger of his
right hand., and he may not bat again in the match.
Illingworth stood accused last night of playing into West Indian hands
-- but afterwards refused to comment either on his own involvement in
the pitch preparation or on England's performance.
There was no word, either, from England's camp about the wisdom of
batting first on such a surface.
Illingworth's self-imposed silence also prevented questions being
asked about why Devon Malcolm, England's quickest bowler, had not been
recalled to bowl on a pitch on which Warwickshire's South African Allan
Donald has been lethal this season.
Rouse, the former Warwickshire seamer, said: ''I told everyone it
would be a quick, bouncy track -- and that's exactly what it is.
''It's true and quick, which is what England asked for. It hasn't
seamed around, the bounce has been consistent, and, to my eyes, it was
more a case of England's batsmen getting themselves out.
''Atherton played a poor shot, Hick got opened up and was playing
towards mid-on, Stewart went back instead of forward, Smith hit a long
hop to cover, and Gough had a slog.
''I think you can say that only Thorpe got out because of the pitch --
and even then it was a brilliant ball from Curtly Ambrose.''
Thorpe suffered a bruised left thumb fending off a wicked lifter to
gully, and several other England batsmen found themselves hopping about
as Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, and Ian Bishop made the ball fly through.
England's seamers, by contrast, were a far less fearsome prospect.
Rouse added: ''Donald, who is by far the quickest bowler in the world
at the moment, would love to bowl on this.
''But we've had quick and bouncy pitches at Edgbaston all season. In
our last match Keith Piper, the keeper, was standing back 32 yards for
Donald -- and today I reckon he would have had to go back to the
Cornhill logo!
''I reckon our pitches here are now as quick as The Oval, and this one
is perhaps quicker.''
Michael Hirst, chairman of Warwickshire's ground committee, confirmed
that Illingworth had been in close touch throughout the preparation of
the pitch.
He said: ''We were asked by the England committee, through Ray, to
induce as much pace and bounce as possible, and hopefully even bounce.
''As far as this pitch is concerned, it is within the current
guidelines laid down by the Test and County Cricket Board.
''Ray asked us to do this and we obliged. We kept him in touch with
how the preparation was going and he said: 'Keep up the good work'.
''We are happy with the way the pitch has behaved. The danger in a
pitch like this is that you are preparing something which suits a West
Indian attack.''
West Indies' Ambrose, who went off the field with a groin strain after
having broken down in his eighth over yesterday morning, is still having
treatment.
Asked whether hie could bowl again in the Test, West Indian manager
Wes Hall said: ''Only if it's necessary!''

THE last piece of the jigsaw fell into place for catering giant
Compass when it confirmed that it is buying the Eurest subsidiary of
French hotel group Accor for #589m.
The deal, which is probably the biggest ever in terms of a British
company buying a French investment, will result in the formation of the
world's biggest caterer with sales approaching #3000m and ahead of the
#2700m Sodexho-Gardner combine which is also Anglo-French.
Under the agreement, Compass will pay #308m cash of which #38m is
deferred and issue 75.6 million shares to Accor which will end up with a
22.5% stake and board representation. To cement the long-term
arrangement, Accor which is the world's largest hotelier with 2265
hotels and operates in 132 countries, has agreed not to sell a
substantial part of the holding for at least three years.
Its co-chairman, Gerard Pelisson, said that he had turned down a
higher price from Granada because Accor wanted to maintain an interest
in Eurest.
Eurest operates in 27 countries and has 26,000 employees, serving
825,000 meals a day in 2500 restaurants. It achieved pre-tax profits
last year equivalent to #31m on turnover of #678m.
Compass chief executive Francis Mackay said the logic of the deal was
outstanding because there was virtually no geographic overlap and there
was significant scope for organic growth.
He pointed to the German market for contract catering, which is ripe
for development, and is expected to grow from the #800m registered in
1992 to #3000m in 2000. Contract catering must win out over
self-catering because of the cost advantage of massive purchasing power.
The enlarged Compass will buy about #1000m of supplies annually which
will give it tremendous clout in negotiating.
The deal also includes a one third interest in Eurest France

FIRST results from commodity trader and processor ED &amp; F Man since the
group went public last autumn satisfied the market and the shares gained
3p to 167p, though this still leaves them below the 180p offer price.
Profits rose 12% to #78m but without the benefit of high suger prices,
the results would have reflected poor a performance from commodity
dealing, the very business which institutions were not too keen on when
the group floated, though the sale was comfortably subscribed.
The dealing and investment management side saw profits almost halved
to #13.2m as a result of the difficult trading conditions in the year
which hit performance-related fee income. The buying out of a minority
interest enabled the operation to restructure, cutting overheads and
giving increased focus, particularly on institutional business.
Fortunately the sugar operation more than compensated for this, with
profits more than doubling from #15.3m to #37.3m despite #7m of losses
in Australia reflecting start-up of a new refinery. Further losses are
expected this year.
Offsetting the 1994/95 loss was a #9m receipt from legal action
against a former Brazilian government agent and further sums are
anticipated. Finance director Stanley Fink said the total over the next
three years should be at least as much again.
Cocoa is the other main commodity business and here profits dipped a
bit to #10.6m. Prices were weak which affected processing margins in
Europe, though North American operations were better.
Results for the smaller commodity activities like nuts and spices were
mixed and agricultural products as a whole were up 57% at #57.7m.
The international broking arm, Man International, had another good
year, earning 19% more at #10.2m, gaining further market share in london
and North America.
The group is confident its spread of activities will continue to
deliver profits growth as they have in the past.
Meanwhile the 7.2% yield, with dividends of 9.6p, make the shares of
interest to income funds.

LAST year's runner-up, Laura Moffat, will have a second chance to
bring home the silverware today when she meets Fiona Lockhart in the
final of the Scottish Girls' championship at Paisley.
The 15-year-old Moffat will surely have several more opportunities for
victory before she joins the senior ranks, but not so Claire Hunter, who
was defeated by Moffat in the semi-finals.
Hunter fought back from three down with a par at the fifteenth and
birdies at 16 and 17, but lost out to a birdie at the second extra hole.
Results:
Quarter-finals: L Moffat (West Kilbride) beat L MacKay (Golspie), 2
and 1; C Hunter (Deeside) beat F Prior (Cawder), 6 and 5; F Lockhart
(Balbirnie Park) beat H Stirling (Bridge of Allan), 1 hole; K Burns
(Clydebank and District) beat S McEwan (Gifford), 6 and 4. Semi-finals:
Moffat beat Hunter, at 20th; Lockhart beat Burns, 2 and 1.

When it comes to the BMW 3-series Touring beauty, says Ross Finlay, is
more than skin deep
MANY people's reaction to the BMW 3-series Touring is the same as
Winston Churchill's reported response to the information that one of a
new intake of MPs was called Bossom. He growled: ''Neither the one thing
nor the other.'' Similarly, the latest Touring does not have the lines
of a saloon, and it is hardly a workaday estate. But it is one of the
most impressive production cars on the market, so who cares.
BMW is now into the fifth generation of the 3-series. Although the
Touring makes its appearance here four years or so after the
corresponding saloon, the idea of having it in the range was planned
right from the start. So was the idea of persevering with Touring as a
model name rather than Estate. Doing so preserves the patrician image
BMW's British subsidiary has nurtured so carefully over the years.
This is a car which looks magnificent in the metal, partly because it
is not just a 3-series saloon with an estate -- sorry, touring -- rear
end casually grafted on to it. Side-on, it is beautifully proportioned,
giving the impression it is the result of many hours of work in the
stylists' studio.
Overall, despite appearances, it is exactly the same size as the
saloon. And for all the talk about this version of whichever 3-series
generation having nothing like the load-carrying capacity of a ''real''
estate, the latest car is noticeably improved in that department.
Perversely though, the rear suspension layout means there is actually
less width between the wheel arches, but the maximum width of the load
area is greater than before, and so is the opening between the rear
light clusters.
There are four tie-down points to help secure heavy or roll-about
cargo in a rear compartment which offers about 12% more volume than
before. The floor is not particularly low or even actually flat, and
seats-up you would probably get almost as much luggage into the saloon.
However, the Touring naturally has split-folding rear seats to increase
the luggage space on demand. The tailgate is lighter than in the
previous car, and there is a very neatly arranged security cover, but
the whole idea behind the Touring is revealed in the high quality
carpeting on which the luggage rests.
While a 1.8-litre petrol engine, as well as 1.7 and 2.5-litre turbo
diesels, will arrive later this year, there are two lightweight
aluminium-block engines available now, from BMW's much admired range of
silky-smooth six-cylinder units. The 320i Touring comes with the 150bhp
two-litre engine, while the really imposing 193bhp 2.8-litre version
powers the 328i.
A showroom price of #21,900 for the former may seem high, but the car
is fitted with much the same level of equipment as the SE saloon. The
328i costs #25,500, and BMW has never made any secret of the fact that
these cars are offered at premium prices to customers who do not
quibble.
The 328i in particular is a very strong performer, reaching 60mph in
just over seven seconds, with formidable mid-range torque and a test
track maximum over 140mph. The lightweight, low-friction engine has
eased out the fuel economy figures; there are good safety features and a
top-class security system.
In handling as well as performance the 328i was a revelation, romping
up some winding mountain roads like a thoroughbred, although even the
best ride standards BMW could provide, in what may on occasions be a
heavy-load carrier, cannot stop this wide-tyred car reacting to the dips
and corrugations of poorly maintained surfaces.
Exterior finish and general bombproof build quality are right up with
BMW's best. And this is a car which pays attention to intimate detail as
well as overall appeal. When the engine is just pottering round, one of
the twin tail pipes is automatically blanked off, to reduce the exhaust
noise to a minimum. That, in an engineering context, is style.

THE dire state of UK housebuilding -- starts were down by around 15%
this year -- was further underlined yesterday when Y J Lovell said it is
to quit private speculative activities and will concentrate on
partnership building with local authorities and housing associations,
writes ANDREW WILSON.
The move will result in redundancy and other costs amounting to #3m.
The shares eased 3p to 31p although there was little reaction among
other housebuilders.
Lovell is expecting partnership homes to increase from last year's
1979 units through an expected 2700 this year and to 3000 in 1996. The
existing private sector land bank and work in progress totalling #45m
will be worked through by September 1996.

A PULSATING finish allowed Dutch rider Jeroen Blijlevens to take his
share glory by winning the fifth stage of the world's greatest cycle
race yesterday.
The longest stage of this year's Tour, over 261km from Fecamp, turned
out to be relatively uneventful until the final straight in the northern
port of Dunkerque in which Blijlevens won a massive sprint ahead of the
speed specialists.
Blijlevens, riding in his first Tour, beat Jan Svorada, of Slovakia,
into second place with German Erik Zabel third.
Italian Ivan Gotti, who took over as race leader after Frenchman
Laurent Jalabert fell just two kilometres from the end of Wednesday's
fourth stage, came in with the pack to retain the yellow jersey.
Race favourites Miguel Indurain, of Spain, and Yevgeny Berzin, of
Russia, were briefly seen in front in the closing stages as if they
wanted to show their strength but neither took part in the final sprint.
Blijlevens, who drew attention last year by clinching four wins in his
first year as a professional, started his sprint by following
Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, of Uzbekistan, who eventually finished
seventh.
''I had decided to follow him but when I overtook him, it was an
incredible feeling,'' he said. Leading placings:
1, J Blijlevens (Netherlands) TVM, 5hr 51min 46sec; 2, J Svorada
(Slovakia) Lampre; 3, E Zabel (Germany) Telekom-ZG; 4, F Moncassin
(France) Novell; 5, M Cipollini (Italy) Mercatone Uno, all same time.
Overall -- 1, I Gotti (Italy) Gewiss Ballan, 22hr 10min 52sec; 2, B
Riis (Denmark) Gewiss Ballan, 1sec behind; 3, M Mauri (Spain) ONCE, 17;
4, A Zuelle (Switzerland) ONCE, 18; 5, J Bruyneel (Belgium) ONCE, 24; 6,

THE Emirates Racing Association has announced the inauguration of a
new intercontinental race, the Dubai World Cup.
The 10-furlong event, for four-year-old and upwards on March 27 next
year, will be the richest race in the world carrying a total purse of
$4m (#2.5m) of which $2.4m (#1.5m) goes to the winner.
The race will be run on the sand track at Nad al Sheba and the
selection of the 14-strong field will be made by an international panel
of senior handicappers and racing secretaries, the same method as for
other major international events.

BOXING
CHRIS Eubank goes back into the ring against Spain's Jose Ignacio
Barreutabena on July 29 -- but he admitted yesterday he is already
looking beyond the Whitley Bay fight to a return with Steve Collins.
Eubank, who lost his World Boxing Organisation super-middleweight
title to Collins in March, said: ''He's the guy I really want. I want to
give him a second chance to beat me fairly and squarely. He has beaten
me by the record books, but not by nobility.''
Eubank has fought only once since his defeat by Collins, easily
overcoming Argentinian Bruno Godoy in Belfast in May.
He said: ''I found myself standing back and showing chivalry in my
last fight. Then I stepped it up -- and that's what I intend to do this
time. There will be no more merciful behaviour when I'm fighting, and no
more time wasting.''
* STEVE Robinson has other matters on his mind and that, according to
Spaniard Pedro Ferradas, will lead to his downfall tonight at the
National Ice Rink in Cardiff.
Robinson defends his WBO featherweight championship for the seventh
time against Ferradas but the Cardiff native seems more concerned with
Sheffield's Naseem Hamed.
''I'm surprised Robinson is talking about Hamed instead of me and I
think it is an insult,'' said Ferradas. ''I respect Robinson as a
champion but it is not good for a boxer to think about a later fight
because that can be a big problem.''

HOCKEY
AN insight to Scotland's potential for the European Nations men's cup
finals, and the composition of the squad which will make the trip to
Dublin next month, will be revealed over the weekend in France.
Scotland take on their hosts in a three-match Test series starting
tonight in Douai and, so far as the players are concerned, this will be
their last chance to impress.
The squad for Dublin will be announced right afterwards but a good
showing in France undoubtedly will have its rewards.
Coach Billy McPherson has made three changes to the squad which lost
all three games in the Four Nations tournament in Lisburn, Northern
Ireland, last month, bringing back goalkeeper Alasdair Seaton and
strikers Roddy Philp and Stevie Grubb.

SCOTLAND'S Colin Montgomerie, not exactly the greatest loss to the
diplomatic corps, sent the fur flying at the Murphy's Irish Open at
Mount Juliet yesterday when he hit out at the reported #200,000
appearance money being paid to Greg Norman.
''If that figure is true, it is quite outrageous,'' snapped Monty. ''I
would be delighted if appearance money were to disappear altogether. It
always causes problems between players.
''I am here because I want to take part in this tournament, not
because I am being paid. Appearance money never dictates where I go.''
His comments were immediately relayed to the Great White Shark, who
was less than amused. ''It is up to the sponsors -- it's their money,''
he responded.
''You have to pay for professional talent and the sponsors obviously
feel it is worth it if more spectators are attracted. This happens
throughout the world. I don't think it is going to change because of
anything Colin Montgomerie has said.''
It should be very interesting if they are paired in the closing
stages.
In between the verbal sparring, there was some sparkling golf on a
sultry day when the wind got up in the afternoon. Montgomerie played
well, in tune with his driver, for his 68, which keeps him well among
the leading group.
Norman had a 70 and expressed himself well satisfied. ''The early
starters had the best of it, but I am still in there,'' said the
Australian. ''If the weather stays like this there will be low
scoring.''
Sandy Lyle, playing only on a last-minute invitation from the sponsor
after his disqualification in Germany last week, also was on the 68
mark, and he had a message for fellow-Scot and Ryder Cup captain Bernard
Gallacher.
''I have told him that if I keep on playing like I am at the moment, I
will make the team without anybody else's help. In fact, I think he
should choose me anyway.''
Lyle opened with three straight birdies, and finished off with a
No.6-iron shot to eight feet and holed the putt for a birdie.
Sam Torrance was at one stage five under par and is still there on 68.
He is the last Scot to have won this title, back in 1981.
The leader is none other than Sven Struver, not even a household name
in his home town of Hamburg. This personable, blond 27-year-old with a
red-hot putter fairly blazed his way to his 65, which equals the course
record.
Sven's ambition is to ''become the second German after Bernhard Langer
to play in the Ryder Cup.'' He is also keen to improve his memories of
Ireland -- the first time he played there, at Portrush in 1988, his knee
gave way and he came out of a bunker by ambulance!
''The reason that there are not more good golfers from my country is
that our young people do not wish to work hard,'' he informed us. ''They
can make more money playing tennis.'' In Britain, the reverse is
obviously true.
Robert Allenby, the 23-year-old Australian, was joint-second in this
event last year, shot a 63 in Wednesday's pro-am -- not recognised for
course-record purposes -- and followed up with a 67 yesterday.
''If I can beat Greg Norman this week I am going to be very close,''
he declared. Very likely.

PAPER maker Inveresk has startled the City with its success in clawing
back cost increases through enhanced selling prices. This has worked its
way through in a profits improvement in the first six months to May of
5% to #4.71m while turnover rose 27% to #61.2m.
The shares rose 12p to 184p to capitalise the Pitreave company at
#97m.
Chief executive Stefan Kay said about 19% of the sales gain was a
result of higher selling prices and about 6% can be attributed to
volume. Altogether, there has been about 96% cost recovery and there are
few businesses able to achieve that level of price efficiency against
the background of a soaring commodity price which has pushed up working
capital requirements by #4m.
At the beginning of last year, woodpulp was costing $400 a tonne. But
in the last six months alone have jumped 32% to $925 and as from October
another $75 will be added on. Inveresk reckons they could hit $1200
although there is additional Indonesian capacity coming onstream which
should help.
It is in the happy position that it has long-term contracts and
understandings with its pulp suppliers including its previous parent
Georgia Pacific.
The company which came to the market in 1993 at 150p has been able to
persuade customers to be realistic and so is seeing margins back on the
mend.
Exports account for 53% of sales with a good partial recovery in
Germany where sterling costs give Inveresk a decisive competitive edge
over local production. There are also good volumes going as far away as
New Zealand.
The group is operating at full capacity with strengthening order
books. Additional shiftworking is being introduced and additional
capacity is being introduced at the Carrongrove board mill at Denny.
That and other minor additions will increase overall capacity from
120,000 tonnes to 130,000 tonnes over two years with the increase being
highly beneficial in terms of profitability.
However, to make a significant step forward, corporate action is
required and chairman Bill Goodall said that Inveresk was looking for an
acquisitions in the #20m-#40m bracket, probably in Continental Europe.
Full-year profits seem likely to improve from last year's depressed
#8.1m to at least the previous year's #9.33m given the optimism exuding
from the management.
That points to the shares trading at 14 times earnings and are good
value. The interim dividend has been raised 5% to 1.93p with a possible
total of 5.8p giving a 3.9% yield.

Policy to be explained at meetings.
SCOTTISH Pride directors have responded to accusations that they have
failed to communicate with shareholders by organising a series of
meetings at seven different locations at which they will explain company
policy.
In particular they will deal with complaints from the shareholders'
association that there have been difficulties in acquiring shares in the
company.
Jim Hosea, chief executive, and David Henderson, a director of the
company's stockbrokers -- Allied provincial -- will attend the meetings,
which will take place during a nine-day period before the company's
annual general meeting on July 28.
This exercise is an indication of the board's concern at the five
critical resolutions which have been submitted by the shareholders'
association for consideration at the agm. The emergence of a group of
dissident shareholders in the company's first year of operation is an
unwelcome development.
''The commercial damage which is being done to the company is
significant. I do believe we have lost business as a result,'' said Mr
Hosea yesterday. ''Our customers are asking whether we have a stable
business and at the end of the day the customer is king. It is the
customer who pays our wages and the shareholders' dividends.''
Business confidence was a fragile thing, he said. If major customers
began to doubt the company's ability to deliver products of the right
quality and at the right price they would begin to question whether they
should be doing business with Scottish Pride.
Mr Hosea said he understood the conflict of interest which arose
through the majority of the 3200 shareholders in the company being dairy
farmers, with an obvious interest in the price they would get for their
milk. There was a fear that Scottish Pride wanted to prosper as a
company by pushing down the price of milk.
''We do not determine the price of milk -- it is our customers who do
that,'' he said. ''We can only get from them what they are prepared to
pay.''
He pointed out that the milk market at present was very competitive
with a degree of over-capacity. It was a time of great change after a
spell when the industry had been feather-bedded for so long by the milk
marketing board system.
Mr Hosea said he would have preferred a more gradual change-over to
the new arrangements for milk rather than the ''sudden death''
introduction of a new era on November 1 last year.
The board of directors has advised shareholders to reject the critical
motions submitted by the dissident shareholders group for the agm.
Some of the current difficulties may also arise from misunderstandings
about the workings of the the Stock Exchange. Some shareholders have
been under the impression that the #4m to be paid to Scottish Pride
through the SMMB residual board will be re-distributed to dairy farmers.
The money will be retained by the company and any benefit to producers
would be indirect, as shareholders in a strengthened company.
Lord Sanderson, chairman of Scottish Pride, said it had to be
remembered that the company had, on vesting day, inherited liabilities
as well as assets. The money due to them from Scottish Milk via the
residual board would help to meet these liabilities.

EFFORTS to improve the quality of teaching are pointless if education
continues to be underfunded, Dr David Kennedy, Principal and Vice
Chancellor of Aberdeen's Robert Gordon University said yesterday.
He told a graduation ceremony that the University stood to lose around
#1.8 million in income from the Funding Council over the next three
years as a result of Government policy to consolidate student numbers.
''Improving the quality of teaching is futile if the quality of
learning is sacrificed by an environment of financial hardship,'' he
told the audience in the Music Hall.
''Past efficiency gains were made by removing inefficiencies and
expanding the student population, but now expenditure will have to be
cut and this can only be done through the further loss of jobs to those
shed following a cut of almost #1m in 1989-90.
''No organisation, public or private, can long survive cuts to its
income of 3% year after year.
''Perhaps university league tables introduced by some of the press
will enable books to be opened on which institutions will be the next to
go to the wall.
''Perhaps it is only when a sufficient number have closed down --
probably disguised as ''mergers' -- that something positive will be done
to ensure an adequate funding of education.''
He said quality audits and assessments had brought nothing to enduring
value to higher education.
''Their focus is almost entirely on the quality of teaching and the

''No one enquires about the effect of student hardship or the need for
students to do menial jobs in order to live.''

EXPRO Group, which has its operational base in Aberdeen, is part of a
three-company consortium which has won the largest well-service contract
ever awarded in the Netherlands.
The two-year contract, with an estimated total value of more than
#20m, should be worth about #4m to Expro. Awarded by Shell's Dutch
subsidiary, NAM, the contract began last week. It covers all
non-rig-related well services for NAM's 700-plus onshore and offshore
wells.
US companies Western Atlas and Nowsco are the other companies in the
victorious Integrated Solutions Alliance (ISA) consortium, which will
work on the contract with NAM. All ISA members have operations in the
Dutch city of Den Helder.
The contract can be renewed indefinitely, dependent on performance and
quality during the initial two-year period.

GENEVA: UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged the world's
rich countries to finance the clearance of landmines and totally ban
their production and use.
The conference aims to raise #50m for clearance programmes in 17
countries this year. The US delegation backed the plea with #8.3m but
warned that an outright ban was politically and militarily impossible.
About 110 million landmines lie buried in 65 countries, killing 10,000
people a year, one-third of them children.

GLASGOW Development Agency yesterday forecast enormous gains for the
city in the run up to the millennium.
Major projects include breathing new life into the former Glasgow
Garden Festival site, where if all goes well, around #180m will be
ploughed into creating a business park and National Science Centre at
Pacific Quay.
Officials also intend to ensure the National Gallery for Scotland goes
ahead, and that Glasgow's designation as 1999 UK City of Architecture
and Design will be exploited to the full.
However, grave doubts still exist over the agency's performance in
tackling the city's high level of long-term unemployed and its low
business birthrate.
Chief executive Stuart Gulliver conceded efforts to get the long-term
unemployed back to work were proving ''stubbornly difficult.'' Successes
were low, and expensive to achieve. He also acknowledged the business
birthrate performance remains poor.
Mr Gulliver, launching the GDA's annual report for 1994-95, warned
that Glasgow's competitiveness as a business location was suffering
against English rivals in particular because of a lack of suitable
sites.
He pledged the problem will be addressed, with the Pacific Quay
proposals among multi-million pound programmes to create high-quality
sites not only for inward investment but to help indigenous companies
grow.
''Glasgow urgently needs this capability now to remain a competitive
city,'' said Mr Gulliver. He added: ''Manufacturing is still important
in Glasgow, and anyone who thinks otherwise is mistaken.''
The agency, with a #56m budget, claimed it had created or safeguarded
12,000 jobs, generated #200m worth of economic activity, and put more
than 13,500 people through training and employment programmes.
Other highlights included 414 new business start ups, 16 inward
investment projects with 2400 jobs forecast, and 38 companies helped to
obtain #16.5m worth of exports.
Mr Gulliver was adamant it was a successful year, with a resurgence in
Glasgow's regeneration after a sluggish period caused by the recession.
New chairman Michael Lunn said he was confident about the future, and
looked forward to working with the new unitary local authority in
meeting the challenges ahead.
Asked if he also looked forward to working with new Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth, he replied: ''We will work with anybody . . . I do not
see a change in personality making any difference in the way we
operate.''
The accounts showed that companies or organisations connected with six
of the 12-strong board received more than #1m from the GDA during the
year.
The sums ranged from #1000 to Kelvin Business Services, where Ian
Irvine is a director, for business support, to about #920,000 for land
decontamination to Joseph Dunn (Bottlers) Ltd, where Professor Robert
Jack is chairman.
Three new board members have been appointed -- Professor John
Arbuthnott, principal of Strathclyde University, Barrowfield Leath
managing director Margaret Martin, and Pilkington Optronics managing
director Tom O'Neill.

PETER Haining, will be forced to give up one of his most cherished
crowns, the lightweight single sculls title, at the International
Lucerne Regatta in Switzerland this weekend, as part of his campaign in
pursuit of Olympic gold.
With the lightweight singles category not included in the Olympic
programme, this year, Haining has forged a partnership in lightweight
double sculls, which is a new Olympic event, with Carl Smith.
Following second places earlier in the season at Paris and in Italy,
this weekend's regatta, which has attracted the world's best crews, is
the sternest test yet for Haining and Smith.
Altogether 20 British squad boats will be competing, the flagship
being the coxless pair of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent, who set a
world record in last year's final.

CRAIG Lee, of Stirling, shot the only level-par round of the
competition so far to take the lead at the Scottish Boys' Strokeplay
championship at Arbroath yesterday.
His round of 70 gave him a two-shot advantage over Stewart Whiteford,
of Lundin, whose No.1-iron shot at the fifth gave him an eagle, a round
of 73, and a total of 144.
Lee, who burst on to the scene with a surprise semi-final place at
last year's Boys' Matchplay championship, has improved leaps and bounds
since then and has reduced his handicap from four to one.
Favourite Steven Young is six shots off the pace following two scores
of 74. However, he came back from the same position last year to win.
Leading aggregates:
142 -- C Lee (Stirling) 72, 70. 144 -- S Whiteford (Lundin) 71, 73.
145 -- G Crawford (Drumpellier) 73, 72. 146 -- G Fox (West Kilbride) 75,

SPIRITS, brewing, and food retailer Allied Domecq caught the market on
the hop when chairman Michael Jackaman told the annual meeting that
profits would be held back in the short term.
He said that while it is important to tell shareholders
straightforwardly that the short term outlook is not an easy one, it is
equally important to view the coming months in their proper perspective.
He added that recent disposals, particularly in the food and pub
businesses would cut profits. These sales have so far brought in #700m
including the latest which is the #190m management buy-in of the Tetley
tea and coffee businesses.
The sale of the Pubmaster chain alone would reduce profits by #9m.
Last year, group pre-tax profits rose from #624m to #708m.
Mr Jackaman also warned that it would have to re-structure its
Calsberg-Tetley brewing division because of the large over-capacity in
the industry. However, that could take a different course if Scottish &amp;
Newcastle is allowed to buy the Courage brewing division of Foster's
Brewing. A decision on that deal expected soon from the Trade Secretary.
Success could result in Whitbread attempting to buy Carlsberg-Tetley
which has been the worst performer of the major brewers in the last two
years. The merging of Allied Breweries and Carlsberg has not worked
nearly as well as expected. Profits last year fell 21% as it chased low
margin take-home business.
Allied Domecq shares fell 16p to 539p but are still considerably above
the low for the year of 490p when they were affected by the hostile
reaction to the investment in Mexico and the plunging peso.

As the new Cabinet sets about its tasks, the Foreign Secretary takes
an uncompromising line.
A EUROPE of nation states with which Britain is comfortable is one of
the top priorities of the new Foreign Secretary, Mr Malcom Rifkind. His
words will give little comfort to the Euro-sceptics in the Conservative
Party, but Mr Rifkind was in no mood to accommodate them.
The ''scepticism'' term was out of date, he said. What was needed was
new terminology which reflected what the current debate was about.
Britain only would be content with a Europe of nation states that
recognised Europe's strength was in its diversity, not in a sterile
search for uniformity, he added.
In a whirlwind news conference yesterday, his first day in the job, Mr
Rifkind rattled out his words machine gun-fashion as he listed his four
priorities, denying they were in any order of preference. They are:
* The strengthening and reinvigorating of the Atlantic alliance and of
the wider ties that bind the United States and Western Europe.
* Taking forward the policy on Europe developed by the Prime Minister
and the Cabinet.
* Giving a new impetus to the search for a lasting peace in the former
Yugoslavia.
* Forging a new partnership between the Foreign Office and British
business to increase our exports and foreign investment in the United
Kingdom.
''I see my duty as Foreign Secretary in a very straightforward way,''
he said. ''It will be to fight for British interests both in Europe and
elsewhere.
''It will be to ensure that British foreign policy is robust and that
it is conducted in amanner that will ensure the well being of this
country. It will be to use Britain's experience, influence and authority
to promote stability,m to assist the peaceful resolution of disputes,
and to enhance the prospects for global free trade.''
He promised to use all the tools at his disposal -- Britain's
membership of the European Union, of Nato, the United Nations, the
Commonwealth and our other assets as a great outward looking country.
''The resources of the Foreign Office and our embassies abroad would
be used to the maximum extent possible to enhance our trade, assist our
exporters and help Britain face with confidence the even fiercer
economic competiton that lay ahead.
Asked whether Britain could be comfortable in a Europe which had a
single currency, Mr Rifkind said such a change, historic and
irreversible, would be highly important for any country. That was why
the Prime Minister had been absolutely right to refuse to agree to it in
principle at Maastricht.
It was a matter for a future Parliament to decide and the Government's
approach accorded with the instincts of the vast majority of people in
this country. The prospect of a common currency had been pushed back to
1999 at the last European Council and for some countries it would be
well into the next century before it was possible.
''What we recognise is it is important for the United Kingdom to
exercise influence on the discussions taking place about economic and
monetary matters over the next few years,'' he said.
''The opt-out protects our national interest.''
He promised to combine a stalwart defence of British interests with a
constructive contribution to the debate about the future.
On the Atlantic Community proposal, which he recently put forward, Mr
Rifkind said he had not been alone in floating the idea which had
reached the stage were a lot of detailed work had to be done to put
flesh on the framework.
The threat of the Cold War had meant there was no need to grip the
public imagination about the need for co-operation, and people now had
to be reminded that the links which bound North America and Western
Europe were not just defence and security, but were our common values --
parliamentary democracy, free trade and the capitalist system.
As to how he felt holding his first great office of state, Mr Rifkind
said his first Cabinet job had been a great office of state -- Secretary
of State for Scotland.
In his valedictory speech to the Foreign Press Association, former
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Europe was not going to be a super
state. Nor was it going to disintegrate. Our task, with our partners,
was to improve it, to tune it better as a motor for our prosperity and
stability. We should not do that if we simply strung together a set of
negatives.
''We must get away from abstract designs and constitutional constructs
of Europe which people do not understand or care for,'' he said. ''But
we must get away too from the notion that sovereignty is something
untouchable, a blessing of chastity which we must keep unsullied by
contact with those around us. Foreign policy is about the exercise, not
the freezing of sovereignty.''
Mr Hurd said Britain should aspire to something more than the status
of an offshore Switzerland and could not safely turn aside from the
continent within whose boundaries one third of all the world's trade
took place.

DUNDEE-based Morning Noon &amp; Night yesterday announced a 50% increase
in annual pre-tax profits to #180,000 and the acquisition of its 24th
convenience store, which is in Ellon, Aberdeenshire.
The company, which was formed only four years ago, has been one of the
beneficiaries of the Great British public's National Lottery hysteria.
Sales of scratch-cards have surpassed all expectations, with the 15
outlets which stock them selling an average of 2500, #1 ''instants''
each week.
With Morning Noon &amp; Night making 4p in the pound on these sales, after
costs, scratch-cards are adding #1500 each week to profits.
The 10 of the 15 outlets which are on-line for the main National
Lottery draw are, between them, selling #50,000 worth of tickets each
week.
With Morning Noon &amp; Night earning commission of 5p in the pound, and
its sales costs double the level for scratch-cards, sales of tickets for
the weekly National Lottery draw are adding another #1500 to weekly
profits.
The company also earns 1% on all winnings paid out.
Outlets with the National Lottery are enjoying a 7% increase in
grocery sales, as customers snap up confectionery and soft drinks while
they wait for their tickets.
In the year to March 25, Morning Noon &amp; Night's turnover was 21%
higher at #14.2m. Stripping out the beneficial effect of the company's
continuing expansion, like-for-like sales advanced 14%.
Operating profits were 42% higher at #332,000.
Sales in the current year, during which Morning Noon &amp; Night has
purchased stores at Coupar Angus, Dundee, and now Ellon, are 30% ahead
of the same period last year.
Executive chairman Eddie Thompson said the current year's forecast
indicated a ''continuation of the forward movement in sales and
profit''.

SIR Hector Monro, the highly-respected agriculture and environment
Minister, yesterday spoke of his sadness at being forced out of the
Scottish Office because it had been decided he was too old to be part of
the young team being created around Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth,
writes Robbie Dinwoodie.
The initial statement from Downing Street yesterday indicated that Sir
Hector, who is 72 and has announced he will be vacating his Dumfries
seat at the General Election, had ''tendered his resignation.''
But before setting out from his home in the constituency to attend the
royal garden party in Edinburgh, he said his resignation had not been
voluntary.
''When the Prime Minister asks you to stand aside in favour of someone
younger, I'm afraid that's it,'' he said. ''It's not as if I volunteered
to stand down, but I quite accept the reasoning that he wanted someone
younger. If the Prime Minister had wished it I would have been delighted
to continue.''
Sir Hector, who was honoured by being made a Privy Councillor,
stressed that his departure had nothing to do with the appointment of Mr
Forsyth, who is considered by most to come from a different party
tradition.
However, he added: ''I would like to have continued to the end of the
current Parliament as a Minister.''
''I enjoyed handling agriculture, fisheries and the environment. I
have had three most enjoyable years which at the time of the General
Election in 1992 I had not anticipated. I am grateful to Ian Lang for
asking me back and I hope my knowledge of these subjects helped things
to flourish.''
He added: ''I am sad to be going but you cannot expect at my age of 72
to be part of a Government that is building up a head of steam towards
the next General Election.''
Sir Michael Hirst, Scottish Conservative chairman, said: ''I must pay
tribute to Sir Hector Monro for all his outstanding years of service as
a Scottish Office Minister. With his life-long commitment to public
service, it is fitting that he is given the honour of Privy
Councillor.''
But Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said: ''Sir Hector
dug John Major out of a hole when he agreed to come back to the Scottish
Office because of the shortage of talent on Tory benches and this is a
rather shabby wat to treat someone who has been a loyal Minister.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said Sir Hector was a
decent man who had done Scotland a service by enshrining in statute the
ban on people having their water disconnected, a move which effectively
blocked privatisation North of the Border. He contrasted his treatment
with the quality of the new arrivals in the Scottish Office team, which
he said showed ''ineptitude.''
SNP chief executive Michael Russell said: ''Sir Hector was the least
offensive members of a very offensive Government. Clearly, he was far
too nice to be part of the new Scottish Office regime.''

FORMER Cabinet Minister David Hunt yesterday accepted responsibility
for failing to get the Government's message across in the past year.
Mr Hunt was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in July
last year with a role as John Major's ''fixer'', responsible for
presentation of Government policies.
He was called into Downing Street on Wednesday, but left without a
job.
Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4: ''I was not offered anything specific, but
if the conversation had continued, I might well have been.
''I have been responsible for the co-ordination and presentation of
the Government's policy over the last 12 months, and you can hardly say
it has been a roaring success, so it is right I should accept
responsibility for that.''
Mr Hunt's first job in Cabinet was as Welsh Secretary before becoming
Employment Secretary. At one time, he was tipped to become chairman of
the Tory Party.
As Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, he was responsible for at
least six Cabinet Committees and the Prime Minister's pet policy, the
Citizen's Charter.
In an exchange of letters on Wednesday, Mr Major said he was ''most
sorry'' that Mr Hunt had decided to leave the Government.
Mr Hunt wrote that he would continue to support Mr Major from the back
benches.

The introduction of education vouchers for nurseries has met criticism
that it will do little to increase overall provision while tempting some
nurseries to regard four-year-olds as ''money on legs'' and cram them
in, Barclay McBain discovers
THE Government has been keen on providing parents with vouchers to
''buy'' education for their children for as long as it has been in
power. There are obvious attractions for the right. Vouchers result in
the creation of a market, with the parent as customer, which allows
providers to come in and do business and leave as the internal dynamic
dictates. And, the argument goes, they increase parental choice.
Now, in their sixteenth year in office, the Tories have finally
produced a scheme which will provide all parents of four-year-olds with
a voucher worth #1100 to enable them to pay for a place in nursery
education.
It is third time lucky for the proponents of education vouchers. More
than 10 years ago, when he was Education Secretary, Sir Keith Joseph
found vouchers intellectually attractive but concluded that they were
too expensive and not practical.
Later, in her tenure at No 10, Mrs Thatcher asked junior ministers to
look at the scheme again but it was also ruled out after they produced
an unfavourable report.
Will parents and the providers of pre-school education -- local
authorities, private nurseries, and voluntary nurseries and play groups
-- also view the initiative as fortuitous at the third count?
The initial reaction last night was that they would not. The
Government believes that vouchers will stimulate new places but critics
argue that they will do nothing to increase provision and access, at
least in the public sector where nursery places are choc-a-bloc, because
the value of the voucher takes no account of the capital cost of
building facilities.
Opponents also maintain that vouchers will favour middle-class parents
who will be able to use them to top-up fees for their children's private
nursery schooling.
In Strathclyde region, which provides education for half of Scotland's
pupils, the annual cost of a nursery class place works out at #1350,
while for a nursery school it is #2100, and for a community nursery it
rises to #3500.
''#1100 will not even look at covering staff costs, far less the
revenue and capital building costs. And if you look at areas where there
is no provision the value of the voucher will not improve access.
''Let's say 44 parents come together and put #44,000 into the pot. You
can't build anything for that. If you spread the voucher over 30 weeks
of the year its value will buy you the equivalent of a morning a each
day in a play group,'' said a senior education source.
When he announced the scheme yesterday, Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth said the detail would have to wait until his officials had
talked to the various providers about the best way vouchers could be
used.
In Scotland, the scheme will cost #70m when it is up and running,
based on #31m in new money to fund places for four-year-olds who do not
at present receive nursery education or are in playgroups, and #39m
which local authorities presently receive for nursery education and
which, in future, they will recoup when parents hand in their vouchers.
The Scottish Parent Teacher Council is one body which is anxious to
have its voice heard in the debate about vouchers. It recently surveyed
parents of primary one pupils to ask them about their experience of
pre-schooling, how satisfied they were with it, and how they would most
like to exercise their choice.
Most had had their children in part-time local authority nurseries,
and 65% of parents in this group gave it a very high satisfaction
rating. And most saw it as the ideal provision.
The next biggest group had had their children in playgroups, the
satisfaction rating was 45%, and only one-third of parents in this group
saw them as ideal. Finally, of those parents whose children had been at
private nurseries, only 43% gave them a high satisfaction rating, while
it was the favoured option for less than half of those in the group.
Judith Gillespie, convener of the council, said: ''There is a very
clear choice for part-time local authority provision. Those who have had
experience of it are highly satisfied. The danger with vouchers is that
the child will be seen as money on legs and, unless there is very close
control of quality, you run the risk of having nurseries packing
four-year-olds in for the sake of the money.''
Mrs Gillespie also believes that vouchers will not improve access,
certainly at least in the public sector whose capital and other
expenditure is tightly controlled by central government. She said: ''It
would be more efficient to put money into the provision end,
particularly since this is what people are choosing.''
Diana Daly, the SPTC executive member who was responsible for
co-ordinating the country-wide campaign for nursery education, sees the
introduction of vouchers as the thin end of the wedge leading ultimately
to their emergence across all sectors of education.
''This method of trying to fund nursery education is unfortunate to
say the least. You are giving a subsidy to those already prepared to pay
for the private sector. That means there will be less available for
those children who probably most need it and whose parents can least
afford it.
''#70m would be a very welcome injection of funds if it were provided
as grants to local authorities and if there were legislation to ensure
that the money was actually used for nursery education,'' she said.
''But this is quite clearly an attempt to fragment the system and
encourage the private sector to grow, because if there are no places
available from local authorities people will take their money elsewhere
and there will be a proliferation of farms for four-year-olds all over
the place.
''In the private sector parents will be expected to pay the difference
between the actual cost of a nursery place and the value of the
voucher.''
Time and the consultation exercise will tell if this is indeed a
genuine attempt to give parents the choice of a system of quality
nursery education open to all or if it is, as another education source
put it, a cynical exercise on the part of Government or an initiative
whose implications have not been properly thought through.

''I DON'T give a stuff about the Conservative Party,'' says Simon
Heffer. This may not be exactly a unique opinion today, but even so it
sounds, well, surprising, coming as it does from the deputy editor of
the Daily Telegraph.
Is this not a man who is paid to write about Conservative politics
from the point of view of one who cares and shares a similar approach?
How can he be so casual about something so fundamental to his job and
his position? Could this be why he ranks so high in the hate list of
John Major and his faithful friends? Is this not apostasy? John Major
certainly thinks so.
With comments like this from those who would purport to support him,
is it any wonder that John Major has had such a beastly time of it in
recent troubled times?
All Prime Ministers grow to hate the press -- some more so than
others. One of Margaret Thatcher's little-recognised strengths was that
she did not read the newspapers, relying instead on a digest of
information provided by her office on a need-to-know basis. John Major,
like former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, has always been troubled by what
others write about him. And worse, he wants to read it all.
It is, perhaps, an indication of a lack of self-confidence, a nervous
diffidence, social anxiety. But the extraordinary thing about the
torment to which John Major has lately been subjected is that it has
come primarily -- if not exclusively -- from the Conservative press. The
list is remarkable and his persecutors are on it for different reasons.
During the five years of Major's leadership, a group of hard-line,
right-wing commentators has developed, the members of which have
consistently done their best to diminish him. Some are unapologetically
motivated by intellectual snobbery, some by political differences,
others by a profound belief that John Major is the wrong man to be
leading the Conservative Party.
Contrary to some reports, there was no munching of humble pie after
this week's result. John Major's own party critics are just sorry that
Conservative MPs have voted with their seats in mind rather than with
their sense; with their bums rather than their brains.
The hard core of opposition was initially centred on the Sunday
Telegraph and the Spectator. This was assumed to be a focus of dissent
to be seen through the refraction of their regret that John Major was
not Margaret Thatcher. In addition, he had little in common with the
interests of the thrusting young men -- and the few women -- who like to
matter.
These people are Boris Johnson, the popular and amiable associate
editor of the Daily Telegraph, who is also a columnist on the Spectator;
Dominic Lawson, editor of the Spectator (who appears increasingly like
his father, Nigel, used to look before he lost all that weight); Anne
Applebaum, deputy editor of the Spectator and Daily Telegraph columnist.
And then there is the melting pot in Kensington High Street, behind
the amiable facade of Barkers department store, where few realise that
the Daily Mail is now located. Paul Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail,
lost faith in John Major and most of his works some months ago. This
resulted in a licence for his opinionated columnists to say whatever
they liked about the Prime Minister.
It has been hard for Mr Major to handle the derision of Paul Johnson
-- a man of immense scholarship and certainties. But he could cheer
himself with the suggestion that this Mr Johnson was also a man who
labours under the imposition of his own vanity. Was there not something
which had made it necessary for Paul Johnson to change his political
views with the frequency that most people apply to bin bags?
There are others who travel in the same wake. Professor Norman Stone,
for one, history professor at Oxford and a man with an easy pen and a
ready-forged Thatcherite reaction to everything. Or the ubiquitous
Andrew Roberts, author of Eminent Churchillians, another man of great
certainties, if only in his early 30s, who speaks dismissively of
''Johnny Major''.
There is Lord (Alistair) McAlpine, former Tory treasurer, ennobled for
services to Thatcherism, friend of the rich and famous, immensely able
gentleman journalist, who despises everything about John Major and has
absolutely no hesitation in writing about it for anyone who will pay
him.
There is also behind them the shadowy figure of Professor Maurice
Cowling, don of Peterhouse College, Cambridge, and a man widely regarded
as the eminence noir -- or possibly bleu -- who has helped to focus the
political perceptions of this generation of Tory thinkers.
And despite his youth, Simon Heffer is an important figure. He is a
young fogey, a precocious 34 -- but he could have been born in braces --
who affects to despise the Prime Minister. His concerns are larger by
far than piffling matters like party politics, which he dismisses so
airily. He cares about the future of Britain, the danger of this country
becoming a colony of Germany, the need to nurture a nation which fosters
individual enterprise and liberty without undue state interference. John
Major dislikes him really quite a lot.
Among the right-wing critical commentators, and they are legion,
Heffer has been foremost in denouncing John Major throughout his
troubled leadership and, most enthusiastically, in the course of the
recent election. Despite the events of recent days, his views remain
unchanged. His editor-in-chief, Max Hastings, was contrite -- on radio
and in the leader column -- about the extent to which the disavowal of
the Prime Minister by the newspapers under his control had been
wrong-footed. There was, however, no detectable apology in anything
Heffer wrote.
This much was also true of his colleagues Boris Johnson, an associate
editor of the Daily Telegraph and political columnist for the Spectator,
and Bill Deedes, former Telegraph editor. But these are both
commentators who arrived at a rejection of Major on grounds of his
perceived political incompetence in office, rather than a preconceived
judgment. Heffer and those like him were never going to accept the
leadership of John Major. ''Don't beat about the bush,'' said my friend
in the Treasury yesterday, ''it is about class.''
It was even before his election as Conservative leader that John
Major's troubles with the right-wing intellectual elite of the Tory
press began. As a candidate in the 1990 election, he was interviewed by
Charles Moore for the Sunday Telegraph. It went very badly indeed.
Mr Moore, who has since become the editor of that newspaper, was not
impressed by Mr Major. The sentiment was entirely reciprocated. Mr Major
felt that he had been patronised and that Mr Moore was a snob. Mr Moore
apparently found it hard to disguise his disappointment about Mr Major.
The endorsement of a classless society, a country at ease with itself,
as Major termed it on the steps of Downing Street, was never going to
appeal to Conservative meritocrats -- or snobs.
The basis of Mr Major's difficulties with the right-wing chattering
class -- which could well have been re-named the battering class in the
Downing Street bunker -- is that the Prime Minister is not a Tory's
Tory. This is not a matter of class . . . or not exactly. It has nothing
to do with the Brixton background, the lack of a university education,
or even the much-discussed fact that he tucks his shirt into his
underpants. It is about style.
Some of those right-wingers who have competed to excel each other in
the vituperation of their comments about the Prime Minister in the past
week are possibly no more highly born than Mr Major himself. In fact,
several of them are lower middle class, with backgrounds far less
interesting and exotic than the Prime Minister's own. That is not the
point.
John Major is oddly awkward about anything to do with his background
and is not prepared to use his personal circumstance to bolster his
position. This is a source of some disappointment in Tory circles, where
they expect the Prime Minister to assume the style of a toff. That is
what Tories are supposed to do when they get to the top. Didn't his
predecessor, a daughter of corner-shop trade, demonstrate beautifully
how to do it?
John Major came into office proclaiming the virtues of a classless
society, and while nobody really knew what that meant, it still managed
to get up the nose of a few who suspected that he was seeking to change
the way the Tory party had always operated.
He therefore had ranged against him not only the Telegraph group of
newspapers, with, incidentally, the enthusiastic support of their
proprietor, Conrad Black, but also the News International Group. Street
wisdom here suggests that this was probably dictated more by a canny
Murdoch sense of commercialism than by anything else. But it meant more
space for free-wheeling right-wing commentators, hired to unleash their
opinions on an unsuspecting public.
It may have been a surprise to the public that the Conservative Party
should turn in upon itself in this fashion. But probably nobody was more
puzzled about it all than the Prime Minister. Where did he go wrong?

As the deadline for consultation on the introduction of ID cards
nears, Anne Johnstone talks to an expert who feels we are asking the
wrong questions
WHAT is the purpose of an identity card? Sounds like a daft question
doesn't it? Maybe. But Elizabeth France, Britain's impressive data
protection registrar, says that's the question we should be asking
ourselves before we say ''yes'' or ''no'' to the idea.
''Too much of the current debate is being conducted on the level of
'Are you for or against them?'. This only serves to mask a range of
important issues,'' she says. She has tried to outline some of these in
Putting You in The Picture, a free information pack. It's her attempt to
raise the level of the debate quickly before the brief consultation
period on ID cards ends in September.
Obviously an ID card is intended to identify the cardholder. But
that's not the whole story. A key question, says France, is what are the
circumstances in which the card will need to be produced? Will it be a
document that attempts to do no more than show that you are who you say
you are if, for example, you are apprehended by the police? Will it
provide access to Government services and benefits? Will it provide
access to any goods and services provided by the private sector, such as
banking services or video rental?
The answers to such questions will determine what sort of information
is likely to be stored on the card. It could also determine the actual
form of the card. A simple card with information that can only be read
by the human eye? A credit-card format with a magnetic strip containing
certain information not visible to the naked eye? Or a smart card
incorporating an integrated circuit chip which could hold a large amount
of encrypted information and provide access to a range of services?
The cost of introduction (at least #600m) will vary enormously
according to which type of card is chosen and whether it is voluntary or
compulsory. The implications for civil liberties and data protection
also vary considerably.
Even the simplest voluntary ID card scheme involves an invasion of
privacy, says France: ''We need to ask in each case, what are the
benefits and how much privacy am I willing to give up to get them?''
She adds that views on such matters are extremely subjective: ''My
mother wouldn't want to carry a card which revealed her age but I
wouldn't mind at all. Someone else wouldn't want their place of birth
displayed. What's an invasion of privacy for some is for others an
erosion of rights which they are quite prepared to put up with because
of the perceived advantages.''
Such advantages might include the use of the card as a travel document
in Europe and the ability to open a bank account without being subjected
to a witch hunt. Remember the lottery winners who failed to open an
account because staff suspected they were money launderers?
And there are perceived advantages to society at large, such as the
reduction of crime. France reveals that she has yet to be convinced of
this. The police, officially in favour of ID cards, maintain that they
would act as a deterrent in crimes involving impersonation but admit
that most crimes don't.
Once it has been decided what a card would be used for and what
information it should contain, we need to address two more questions.
How can this information be kept accurate and how can it be safeguarded
from misuse.
One of the key principles of the 1984 Data Protection Act is that data
users are required to ensure that personal data is accurate and
up-to-date. ''The power of a single national database for identification
requires accuracy,'' says France. Otherwise, we're as well sticking to
other documents, such as the driving licence or passport.
This level of accuracy may require the creation of a whole new
database and, as those trying to compile the poll tax register
discovered, many regard their anonymity as a basic right. So the task
would be difficult, expensive and probably unpopular.
The thorniest issue of all, particularly if the Home Secretary opts
for smart-card technology, is how to protect the information stored in
the card from the determined fraudster or computer-literate nosey
parker?
''The whizz kids will tell you that you can segment encrypted
information. So banking information could be kept separate from medical
information and the like. This is certainly an added safeguard but if
something can be produced, it can be fraudulently produced. It might
help prevent fraud, but it will also introduce a new form of fraud,''
says France.
''If we opt for an ID card it must strike a balance between the need
to identify the holder and the danger of giving away too much
information. We may need statutory penalties for misuse of a PIN number.
If we're all aware of the risks, we can put safeguards in place before
we start.''

TOKYO: Japanese commuters unnerved by abortive cyanide gas attacks
earlier this week reported smelling pungent fumes yesterday at Tokyo
station, the capital's main railway terminal, but no-one was hurt.
Meanwhile, a 29-year-old man was arrested in Yokohama on suspicion of
spraying mace in underground corridors in April. It was thought to be a
copy-cat prank inspired by the nerve gas attacks in March attributed to
the religious Supreme Truth sect.

1995 must go down in the record books as the year of the historically
naff Scottish films. Already there have been Braveheart which has little
to do with the real Wallace and Rob Roy who was a historical nonentity.
Now the silver screen is going to be graced with another one -- The
Bruce.
This view was amply confirmed by the pictures and William Russell's
article on July 3 about the filming of the remake of Bannockburn. To
give one glaringly obvious example, the armour was totally wrong for the
period, being more reminiscent of the mid-fifteenth century!
But it is more the arbitrary fusing of characters together -- for
example Bishops Lamberton and Wishart into one -- that really annoys me;
it is as bad as the Americans inventing a new name for William Wallace's
girlfriend, namely Murren.
These are as dreadful historical travesties as the statue here in
Lanark which is a truly appalling work of no artistic or historical
merit, though those hidebound by sentiment might disagree. I liked the
description of the statue in the article; it was spot-on!
If one kept to the historical facts, one could make a really fantastic
film about Robert the Bruce who was not the altruistic Scottish patriot.
Bruce was basically a good politician who swore an oath of allegiance to
Edward I at Ayr in 1302 and broke it when it suited him. He did nothing
to protect Wallace whom he feared, and he murdered his close political
rival the Red Comyn.
No doubt these facts will be glossed over to make Bruce the
all-singing, all-dancing political hero and once more the intriguing
story of Bruce will just be the province of historians. I think this
would be a shame because the point of historical research is to make
history available to the ordinary man in the street.
I would appeal to producers contemplating making a film about one of
Scotland's national heroes to do some research because the real story
lines are tremendously exciting and much better than trying to make a
film which panders to those who believe in myths.
Scotland deserves to have its historical figures treated properly
whether by Hollywood or by the English and it is not acceptable to
pander to these perceptions about Scotland's past.

UNTIL I read William Russell's article on the filming of The Bruce and
the Battle of Bannockburn (July 3), I had believed that the cause which
brought the two armies together on the field of Bannockburn was the
desire of the Scots nation to free itself from the domination of the
English.
Having read the remarks attributed to the actor who portrayed Edward
II of England, I have now come to the conclusion that it was to stop
them from bloody whining.

UDDINGSTON people are not paranoiac but suspicions grow that a wholly
unacceptable planning decision detrimental to the village's best
interests is about to be taken.
This derives from an application before Hamilton District Council
since March, 1994, for a massive 1000 houses/leisure development at
Haughhead Farm, across the Clyde from Uddingston on the Blantyre side.
Uddingston is overwhelmingly opposed, 300 villagers at a public meeting
on July 3 unanimously voting the scheme down.
Haughhead Farm lies on designated and environmentally sensitive
greenbelt land which, with adjoining areas, can flood when the Clyde
flows high. The proposed development, among other things, would destroy
greenbelt, impose further serious traffic problems on already congested
local roads, and place intolerable demands on the three Uddingston
schools whose rolls are over-subscribed already.
Should Hamilton DC grant planning consent, that would breach their own
Local Plan guidelines which confine future Uddingston house developments
to brownfield sites.
Again, Strathclyde Regional Council's Structure Plan in 1990
identified a need for 1875 greenfield housing sites within Hamilton
District (none to be in or near Uddingston). That has been drastically
amended to take account of significant housing demand/supply charges
throughout Greater Glasgow conurbation.
The update, recording that 1990's perception of likely housing
shortfalls by 1995 has proved unreliable, declares that ''by year 2001
there will be a surplus of about 4000 houses in Hamilton District
alone''. And Hamilton DC's own planning officers recommend rejection of
Haughhead as a ''major urban intrusion into a sensitive wedge of
strategic greenbelt''.
What, then, bugs Uddingston?
Simply this: Hamilton DC has consistently delayed deciding on
Haughhead for no reasons discernible to Uddingston organisations or
individuals actively pursuing the issue.
Local councillors (including members of Hamilton DC's controlling
Labour group) cannot adequately explain what is afoot. Fears mount that
the inconceivable is about to happen -- consent for Haughhead.
Normally in such circumstances Strathclyde RC would call in the matter
under Structure Plan provisions. But the region faces early abolition;
the further fear is that Haughhead might slip through the statutory
safety net, undesirable development a fait accompli.
Uddingston is apprehensive over the lack of clarity anent Haughhead
and the mystery of delay in an apparently clear-cut case. This provokes
understandable conjecture concerning non-open government -- against
which our own MP, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, recently
spoke out following the Monklands DC controversies.
Monklands events sharply demonstrate that, given vigilance, questions
can be asked and answered wherever communities harbour a legitimate
grievance capable of independent investigation.

SOME years ago, our building society decided to ''streamline'' its
administration and customer services. In the ensuing upheaval, erroneous
information concerning our mortgage account was fed into the society's
computer system.
This triggered a flood of letters from different parts of the country,
threatening dire consequences for what had now been ''discovered''.
Unfortunately, it appeared impossible to correct the error.
A nightmarish scenario followed, whereby notification of further
punitive measures continued to arrive, sometimes in the same post as
assurances that all mistakes had been rectified.
When it became clear that only direct intervention by a senior figure
could halt the ever-repeating cycle of unpleasantness and stress, we
appealed to the Chief Executive. His response was to send the matter
back to the very departments who had been unable to undo the errors. The
merry-go-round continued as before, except worse.
Eventually we wrote again to the Chief Executive, begging assistance
of any sort. His response was to send the matter back to the very
departments . . .
Some months later, with the situation reaching bizarre proportions, we
wrote again, now in restrained hysterics. His response was to send the
matter back to the very departments . . .
I shall tell no more of the tale, as it still is rather painful to
recall.
I do, however, mention it because that Chief Executive, Mr Tim
Melville-Ross, now Director General of the Institute of Directors, is
reported in The Herald as trenchantly condemning any form of Scottish
constitutional reform (June 28).
No doubt he feels there's no need for greater accountability at the
Scottish Office. After all, if someone has a problem, all they need do
is write to the Secretary of State, and, provided there's someone of the
calibre of Mr Melville-Ross at the helm, he'll fix it straight away. By
sending it back to the very departments . . .
Now who said people at the top don't deserve their mega-salaries?

THERE has been recent press and media coverage of calls by the Labour
Party for a Scottish Office inquiry into land trading by a Mr Jack
Harvie in which reference is made to a plot of land known as ''the
Gateway site''.
For the record the plot of land referred to is not the business space
development at Inchinnan Road, Paisley, known as Gateway International
developed by Murray Land &amp; Estates Ltd in association with Vico Property
Group.
The name Gateway International was assumed several years ago, given
the proximity of the site to Glasgow International Airport which
attracted HM Customs and Excise to occupy one of the two office
pavilions comprising the first phase of the project.
Mr Harvie has had no involvement with Gateway International nor are we
involved in any way in either of the land deals referred to in media
reports.

THERE is a saying in business that people rise to the level of their
incompetence. In John Major's Cabinet, incompetence appears to be no
barrier to promotion. We have three examples of this from Scotland
alone:
1. Mr Ian Lang, as Secretary of State for Scotland, has seen the
Conservative vote tumble from about 25% to about 10%. His reward --
promotion to the post of President of the Board of Trade. (The BBC
reported this as promotion!)
2. Mr Michael Forsyth, sacked as Chairman of the Scottish Tories,
returns as Secretary of State. Not just in charge of 10% of us, but all
of us!
3. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, elevated to Foreign Secretary, on the same day
that his previous department (the Ministry of Defence) was slated for
gross inefficiency by the Public Accounts Committee for overspending by
#800m on Faslane. Even if he had kept to budget, many Scots would have
thought it a misuse of public funds.

Liam O'Maonlai is back in Glasgow next week -- but not with Hot House
Flowers. John Williamson tells how things are still flourishing with the
fun sound of his current project
SOME eight years ago Liam O'Maonlai played a memorable and packed show
at Fury Murry's in Glasgow. At the time he and his band, Hot House
Flowers, had just been acclaimed as ''the best unsigned band in the
world'' by Rolling Stone magazine, and had just released their debut
single on Mother Records.
Anyone who saw that remarkable and engaging performance would not be
surprised at the way fate has intervened in the interim and turned Hot
House Flowers into Eire's biggest rock export since U2, with accumulated
sales in the millions and stadium and arena-sized shows a regular
occurrence.
So why is O'Maonlai returning to Glasgow next week to play his most
intimate gig in the city since 1987? The answer is ALT, his current
project in which he is the ''L'', the ''A'' being Belfast troubadour
Andy White, the ''T'' Tim Finn, sometime member of Crowded House and
Splitenz, more recently known for his solo work.
Their collaborative album, Altitude, strangely inherits few of the
properties of their individual work, sounding for the most part like a
fun and enjoyable distraction from more serious business, a loose
collection of busked tunes with the odd flash of inspiration. This
assessment seems slightly at odds with the gravity O'Maonlai attaches to
it.
''Sure,'' he says from a break before soundchecking in Brussels,
''there was no real necessity for us to work together, it was just
something that happened over time. I have known Andy for over seven
years when he toured with Hot House Flowers and have been into his music
since I heard his third album, Himself. I met Tim when we were working
on our first album, before I was actually aware of his music.''
In the past, both White and Finn had worked and toured with Hot House
Flowers, but ALT grew from a collaboration for what was going to be the
latter's solo album, beginning in Dublin and its environs, taking shape
at Finn's studio in Melbourne a year ago. O'Maonlai's enthusiasm for the
project seems to have much to do with being free from the shackles of
expectation that comes about with being in a successful act.
''It has been great,'' he says, ''as the one thing we were agreed on
from the start was that these songs would not be safe, that they would
be born out of craft and not necessity. With Hot House Flowers there is
always a degree of interference, from one source or another, and you
grow weary of that. We just decided to do the ALT album, paid for it
ourselves and then asked record companies if they wanted to release it
as a finished product.''
Although no plans were made at the outset as to whether ALT was to be
an on-going concern, or for how long the promotion of the album would
last, the participants seem happy to give it their full commitment for
an indefinite period.
Their first gig was at The Continental in Melbourne, and they've since
toured Europe, with appearances at The Fleadh and Glastonbury. So, away
from the festivals, how has it felt for O'Maonlai to be playing smaller
venues again, and how have Hot House Flowers' fans reacted?
''The response so far has been brilliant, and I have been surprised
that people have not been shouting for older songs. The set is more or
less based round the ALT album, but sometimes on a good night, a song or
two comes up from our past.
''We just want to play a fair bunch of songs, and I think that with
the album we have that. A lot of what we do live works because of the
interaction between us. We change instruments a lot -- Tim plays a lot
of drums, I play some bass, and while none of us is individually
brilliant, it is very accessible and hopefully we occasionally achieve
brilliance.''
While conveying his enthusiasm for his current work, O'Maonlai is
strangely more reticent when it comes to plans for his own band, who
have been largely dormant in the past 18 months. He talks of writing to
his brother with a view to songwriting (''I have always wanted to write
with him, but never had time in the past''), and of the other members of
Hot House Flowers having ''lots of things to do lifewise'', with only a
cursory nod towards his plans to write again with the band in the
autumn.
In the meantime, Hot House Flowers' fans have to make do with ALT, a
more than passable, if slightly unfulfilling, alternative, which
emphasises both the strengths and weaknesses of the three individuals in
question, with songwriting craftsmanship and vocal dexterity just
winning out over comfortably off indulgence.
* ALT play at The Garage in Glasgow on Friday July 14.

STUDENT perceptions of arrogant greed among a small number of
businessmen and deceit among politicians could rebound on industry and
politics by harming their ability to recruit idealistic graduates, the
Principal of Scotland's biggest university warned yesterday.
Sir William Fraser, Principal of Glasgow University, expressed concern
about recent events in business and politics deterring graduates who
were motivated by idealism or a desire for public esteem.
He was addressing arts graduates at yesterday's graduation ceremony at
the university.
And in a separate graduation address at Moray House Institute of
Education in Edinburgh, the Principal, Professor Gordon Kirk, became the
latest higher education chief to criticise Government underfunding of
the sector.
He warned that year-on-year cuts put under threat the standards for
which Scottish higher education had been widely acclaimed.
In his Glasgow University address, Sir William recalled that ''company
man'' was ranked low in a recent survey of students who were asked which
jobs made an important contribution to society and the country at large.
''What seems to be arrogant greed has been reflected in a small but
significant number of cases where some stock option arrangements and
bonuses and golden hullos and platinum goodbyes have been on a scale
which makes the gorge rise, not so much at the sums involved, but at the
attempts to defend them, he said.''
Politics had a similar reputation, Sir William said. ''I doubt if I am
alone in having felt, particularly in the last fortnight, offended by
the daily diet -- on radio, television and in the press -- of a subtext
of half-hidden agendas, forked tongues, and evasions.''
Yet such reputations and perceptions mattered hugely, he said. Sir
William warned: ''Unless industry and politics attract people who have
fair dealing, public service, and a sense of community purpose bound up
with drive and determination and imagination which leadership requires,
this country will decline and will deserve to decline.''
In his address Professor Kirk launched a stinging criticism of the
consequences of cuts in expenditure, which institutions were expected to
achieve while simultaneously increasing productivity.
He said: ''No-one objects to the need to achieve value for money or
the need to exercise scrupulous care in the use of public funds. But we
also need to have value for money.
''If we are to continue to offer a high quality higher education
experience we must be prepared as a community to pay for the maintenance
of that quality.''
Moray House is one of three teacher training institutions in Scotland
to come under greater financial pressure because of plans to remove the
safety net funding which protected them from from the consequences of a
big reduction in income from the previous year.
A campaign has been launched to maintain St Andrew's College in
Glasgow, the Roman Catholic teacher education institution which plans to
make about one-third of academic staff redundant in an effort to offset
the loss of safety net funding.
Despite speculation about the viability of institutions, Professor
Kirk said Moray House was, in financial terms, more secure than it had
ever been. It was attracting more applications than before, its research
income had never been higher, and, now that it had experience of taking
responsibility for its financial affairs, it had embarked on a major
capital programme.
Moray House became Heriot-Watt University's Institute of Education in
1991 and, in his address, Professor Kirk attacked the ''mergermania''
which was a ''periodic affliction in Scottish higher education
circles.''
It was dangerous to argue that economies of scale could be achieved by
merging smaller institutions with bigger ones. He said: ''Anyone
determined to achieve economies of scale could find considerable scope
for rationalisation, even in relation to some of our larger
institutions.''

IN the midst of this week's shenanigans at Westminster I took time out
to commemorate something truly memorable and worthy of celebration --
the election of the Labour Government in 1945. On the fiftieth
anniversary of an event which took place before I was born, but which
certainly shaped my life prospects, it was impossible to keep a lump
from the throat as veterans of that triumph reassembled to recall and
symbolise these days of hope.
At a time when mediocrity prevails it was the best possible reminder
of the fact that government can be a force for good. It was also a
powerful reminder that there are times when this country makes a
collective decision that it must find a new way forward.
It is difficult at this range in time fully to comprehend the forces
which combined to bring about the great triumph of 1945. How and why did
so many people make the distinction in their own minds and in the
voting-booth between Churchill the war leader and the future
requirements of the country?
The answer was surely not attributable to the election campaign, which
was a primitive affair by today's standards with few opportunities for
leading figures to address the nation. The outcome must have been the
culmination of innumerable arguments and debates while war was being
waged.
Individually and then collectively, millions of people decided the war
must not just be about beating the Germans, which Churchill was good at,
but about transforming once and for all the balance within society
between rich and poor, privileged and oppressed.
The breadth and depth of that collective decision astonished everyone.
It produced the first Labour Government with an overall majority and
cleared the way for a programme of social reform which transformed the
lives and prospects of that and succeeding generations.
Methodism and The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropist, more than Marx, are
often credited with winning converts to socialism. But surely the folk
memory of the 1945 Labour Government has been just as big a recruiting
sergeant; as the pragmatic proof that great reforming achievements are
possible if the will exists.
The National Health Service is the most celebrated legacy of these
heady years. Even when they are trying to dismantle it, the Tories
always have to pay lip service to its virtue. But it should never be
forgotten that every inch of the legislation, as it went through the
House of Commons, was bitterly contested -- including the vote of
principle at Second Reading.
How, along with other aspects of the new welfare state, it must have
transformed people's outlook. Freedom from the fear of being unable to
afford medical treatment in time of illness. What greater freedom can
there be than that, yet much of the world -- where the rule of the
market has been unremitting -- remains without it.
But there were plenty other monumental achievements as well. Perhaps
the most fundamental challenge of the immediate post-war era was to
ensure that the country could feed itself. A system of support for
agricultural production, vital to that end, was put in place and
continued to serve the country well for 30 years.
If pushed, many farmers of that era will admit that the post-war
Labour Government did more than any other to put their industry on its
feet. But it was a system geared to the country's food needs, rather
than the open-ended commitment to subsidised production which has
characterised its successor, the Common Agricultural Policy.
The 1945 Government was committed to the achievement of full
employment -- an essential, noble aim for any administration, even when
economic circumstances make it difficult to achieve. To admit the
inevitability of mass unemployment is a doctrine of despair.
In a Fabian lecture marking the fiftieth anniversary, Tony Blair tried
to link the spirit of 1945 with the realities of the present. It was an
interesting speech which gave the lie to any suggestion that his aim is
to break the link with the traditional values of Labour. On the
contrary, he is engaged in a thoughtful quest to give them new life and
relevance.
Labour in these days was more than a political party, pursuing power.
It was also a living reflection of the communities in which it worked.
It was a source of entertainment and enrichment of life, as well as an
efficient political machine.
It is when that link is severed that the ethos of democratic socialism
gets into trouble. Labour is not just about electing councillors or MPs.
It also has to have a higher vision about the advancement of individuals
and communities, and it needs to breed people who have both a gut
feeling and scientific understanding of why they are socialists.
''To create the conditions in which Labour is once again truly the
people's party,'' said Tony Blair, ''we have to learn from the lessons
of 1945. For me, these are the need for a sense of national purpose; the
need to win the battle of ideas; the need to mobilise progressive people
around the party, always outward-looking, seeking new supporters and
members.''
That will do for me, and it seemed to reflect very accurately the
hopes and aspirations of those 1945 veterans who assembled this week.
They know from hard experience that the realistic definition of British
socialism is the most that a Labour government dares to achieve.

MR MAJOR'S salvation earlier this week may simply have deferred his
fate: loss of office is still likely to be delivered at the coming
General Election, if possibly as much as 18 months away. It is hard to
see any significant policy decision which can reverse the unpopularity
in which the Government continues to sink, even if, as is likely, there
is some degree of political recovery from its low point. Confirming Mr
Major means that no new personality is available to boost Tory fortunes.
A new man, or woman, can make a difference -- increasingly so as the
Premiership has assumed a Presidential dimension and ideological
commitments among voters have steadily diminished. Given the way in
which Labour has moved significantly to the right under Mr Blair, it is
harder than before to distinguish between the parties, and that means
that public perceptions of a leader's personal competence become
paramount in determining how people will vote.
Mr Major did extremely well in 1992, but he was then an unknown, as
well as appearing attractive. He is well known now, and that fact is not
to his electoral advantage nationally. The Tories might, in the past,
have hoped for some continuing leverage from warnings against socialism,
but these will no longer work against New Labour, which is striving to
present a radical face with no marked theoretical characteristics. Given
the enormous decline in the appeal of socialist doctrine world-wide, New
Labour is advantaged by its new freedom. Government Ministers must hope,
instead, for public support improving steadily from an equally improving
economy. The economy has improved quite dramatically since our leaving
the ERM three years ago, but that improvement has not always been
identified by public opinion -- not least because much of the groundwork
for it came from adding to taxation, so diverting spending from
consumers and opening the way, in classic manner, to exports. In spite
of its hopes of the reverse, the Major administration has presided over
direct and indirect tax increases on both income and spending (the
extension of VAT to domestic fuel) as well as reduced support, like
mortgage tax relief, for patterns of saving previously regarded as
deserving encouragement. Even income from savings has been more heavily
taxed, and very few voters have enjoyed big earnings increases of the
kind associated with the chairmen of public utilities (one of several
reasons why their rewards have been so resented).
It is possible that tax cuts now -- or soon -- will help, but the
scope for them is severely limited, and the possibility that they would
be damaging to the economy has been underlined by recent remarks by the
Governor of the Bank of England. The limitation derives from the way in
which the public finances have defied the efforts of both Mr Lamont and
Mr Clarke to pay for the large public spending excesses of their
predecessors (including Mr Major himself). That expenditure helped pave
the way for Mr Major's 1992 victory which, in retrospect, was won on
tick. The debt has still to be repaid, and though it is perfectly
possible to start cutting taxation before there is a balance in the
state's accounts by referring to improving trends, and outcomes over a
future period (doubters should consult Lord Healey), it is not really
possible to do so in any significant manner. Even cosmetic amounts will
jar with Mr Clarke's oft reiterated recommendations of prudence, though,
given his record so far, he might just get away with the presentation of
modest tax cuts. Mr Clarke's own preference might be for sticking to
Roman virtues of austerity, claiming that public spending is desirable
and that social welfare programmes are worth paying for. Unfortunately
the Government has, like Mrs Thatcher's before it, given the impression
of relentless hostility to such spending, while continuing it all the
same. Mr Clarke could proffer cosmetic income tax reductions (targeted
on low earners) as a testimony of future good intent, and concentrate on
delivering an aura of competence as well as cutting interest rates to
help smaller businesses and mortgage payers. There are two drawbacks
here. First, the Government does not have a record of financial
competence and its economic success derives more from accident following
expulsion from the ERM, rather than calculation. Secondly, it looks very
much as if a sea-change in public opinion, similar to that identified by
Mr Callaghan in 1979, has occurred again. In that case, tax cuts would
make little difference, even if they were affordable.

THE staging of Edward Bond's Bingo -- a fictionalised account of
Shakespeare's last days, together with Shakespeare's The Tempest, whose
character of Prospero is commonly regarded as a self-portrait, has such
an obvious affinity it's a wonder we don't see it more often.
Certainly David Thacker always saw the potential in it. Now, taking
advantage of the RSC's residency at the Young Vic (a theatre he was
artistic director of until 1993) and the start of another RSC
small-scale tour, Thacker has directed the two plays as if an umbilical
link connected them, which certainly makes logical sense if, in the
event, not necessarily the strongest of dramatic experiences.
Placed side by side in one day (the hottest of the year,
unfortunately) both company and productions seemed enervated by the
attempt, and one was overshadowed by the other -- surprisingly, in this
case, The Tempest by Bingo.
Directed in the round and using the same company for both plays with
one actor, Paul Jesson, playing both Prospero and Bond's Shakespeare,
Thacker's Tempest turns out to be a dour, disappointing affair,
lightened by some imaginative Aboriginal-inspired music from Adrian
Johnston, but barely skimming the surface of this most hallucinatory,
lusciously poetic play.
Jesson's unusually sombre magician/scholar, too, makes little
impression until the final scenes, when Prospero's depression and
despair suddenly strikes a deep chord with Bond's subsequent portrait of
the written-out author returning home to Stratford to die.
Bingo, at present, certainly comes off better. A stark, spare,
dyspeptic view of the Bard of Avon -- more middle-class materialist than
bohemian genius -- and cold with it where family are concerned -- the
grave simplicity of Thacker's in-the-round production is entirely in
keeping with Bond's dislike of ostentation, while also managing to find
something of his dry, gallows humour.
Jesson, too, in his brown serge doublet and Bard-like similarity, is
impressively sour and troubled, weighed down with self-disgust and a
terrifying, conscience-stricken ''was anything done?'' sense of waste
towards the end.
Brutal in its honesty, this revival of a play written over 20 years
ago, is, if anything, even more acute and uncomfortable in its
indictment of capitalism than when first seen in 1973 (at the Royal
Court and with Sir John Gielgud, memorably, as Shakespeare).

Baggies and bikinis are de rigeur for those who turn up at a beach
party in Glasgow tomorrow, reveals KEITH BRUCE
THE Fantastic Baggies have been dropped, but Norman Blake of Teenage
Fan Club has signed up. The Bellshill supergroup, The Pendletones,
making one of their rare appearances, in support of doyen of surf guitar
Dick Dale, at Glasgow's Arches tomorrow, continue to show impeccable
taste.
Duglas Stewart, leader of the BMX Bandits, who lend three of their
number (Sushil Dade and Francis Macdonald are the other two) to the
band, describes himself as a ''a complete Brian Wilson psycho''. This
time around (the Pendletones first appeared at a tribute to the main man
of the Beach Boys at Mayfest last year) there will be a mere eight
Wilson songs in the band's set, drawn from his surf and drag-racing
early sixties good-times period.
''We were more serious last time,'' says Duglas. ''This time it's
'let's celebrate summer!' ''
Hence the inclusion of tunes by Jan &amp; Dean and Tommy Boyce, and the
Garage favourite Goo Goo Muck, memorably covered by The Cramps but
originally recorded by the splendidly-named Ronnie Cook &amp; The Gaylads. A
number by the Fantastic Baggies -- who were winningly kitsch but never
the closest of close harmony groups -- failed to make the cut.
The addition of guitarist Blake, alongside Colin Berwick on keyboards
and Jim McCulloch and Joe McAlinden of Superstar, makes The Pendletones'
appearance something of an all-star occasion for followers of Scottish
guitar pop -- Stewart, McAlinden, and Blake are three of the brightest
stars in the Bellshill firmament. On Saturday, however, they will be
eschewing the lame in favour of more appropriate beachwear.
''We've discussed matching trunks and fake tan -- rubbing it on to
each other before we go on and then wearing normal clothes for the show.
Francis has a real vintage tartan Pendletones shirt of which he is very
proud, and which gave us our name -- but really we don't care about the
image, we only care about the sounds.''
Everyone in Teenage Fan Club and the BMX Bandits missed Dick Dale's
last appearance in Glasgow -- at the end of March -- because they were
playing in the city themselves that night, so there is great enthusiasm
in the Bellshill camp for the return dates.
''I hope enough people are aware that it is not just a gig. Everybody
should come in their baggies and bikinis because we've only just begun.
People should get into the spirit of things -- after all it must be the
first beach party to be held under a railway arch in the city centre.''
* The Pendletones appear with Dick Dale at the Arches, Glasgow,
tomorrow. Dick Dale is at the Lemon Tree, Aberdeen tonight, and The
Music Box, Edinburgh on Sunday.

IN THE nature of things, gambling panders to greed, but the National
Lottery can be plausibly defended by reference to the old saw about
private vice producing public good, through the diversion of a big slice
of stake money to good causes. Unfortunately things have not turned out
to be so benign. The lottery seems to be soaking up money which
previously went directly to good causes, so that many charities have
actually seen their incomes from public subscription shrink even before
contributions from the lottery have started to flow to them. Worse,
although not all charities will benefit from allocations of lottery
largesse, all seem to have been hit by a fall off in direct donation,
with the exception of those charities which collect money by
face-to-face contact with donors on the streets. Street collection in
Scotland has not suffered from the lottery's competition, but all other
methods have been damaged.
Why this should have occurred must be something of a mystery since
there would seem to be little connection between consciously giving a
specific sum to a charity and gambling. Yet the connection has been
satisfied again and again to the unhappy bewilderment of those who
manage charities and is one reason why they have cast a jaundiced eye on
proposals by Camelot, which runs the lottery, to introduce slips
allowing seven stakes rather than the five at present. For Camelot the
move is designed to cut queues and enhance efficiency, but its most
likely effect will be to boost what gamblers risk and so reduce what
might otherwise have been available for other purposes, including
charitable donation. It looks as if Camelot, which has done far better
than expected from the lottery already, is pressing its own luck. It has
continental models to follow, and many of these do have slips with even
more space for bigger stakes (whose UK average is still quite modest,
incidentally) but there is little reason for accepting that because
something exists elsewhere it has to be copied here.
The lottery has proved its worth. People do like a flutter. Its
structures should, however, be tailored to the wider benefits which can
derive from its operation. In this case the charities deserve a
sympathetic hearing.

<HEADLINE>Court rejects custody appeal by Woody Allen</HEADLINE>

New York, Thursday
NEW YORK'S highest court handed Mia Farrow a victory in her bitter
battle with Woody Allen over custody of their three children.
The Court of Appeals refused to hear Allen's appeal against last
year's lower court ruling that questioned his judgment as a father and
awarded custody of Moses, Dylan, and Satchel to their mother.
''We're pleased and not surprised,'' said Charles Stillman, Farrow's
lawyer.
Allen's lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, said he would appeal against
yesterday's ruling.
Farrow, 50, accused Allen, 59, of sexually abusing their 9-year-old
daughter, Dylan.
The director denied the charges and the claim has never been proved.
The case was part of the fall-out from Allen's affair with Farrow's
adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn.
Last year the state Supreme Court, making a custody decision,
criticised Allen for taking explicit photographs of Previn at a time
when he had assumed a legal responsibility for two of her siblings.
Previn was 21 in 1992 when her mother discovered she was sleeping with
Allen.
The photographs, coupled with his continuing relationship with Previn,
showed ''a distinct absence of judgment'', the court said.
Two of the five appeal judges dissented, saying they believed Allen's
visiting rights with Satchel were too restrictive.
Allen's lawyers had cited the dissent as a basis for an appeal.
However the Court of Appeals, in refusing to take up the case, said it
could only consider questions of law, not fact. The higher court said it
was a factual issue that was in dispute.
Farrow is continuing an effort in Surrogate Court to have Allen's
adoption of Moses and Dylan overturned, Stillman said. Satchel is the
couple's biological son.--AP.

I THOUGHT The Three Degrees were chocolate sweeties. Then I thought
they were three nice girls from Detroit. Then I found out, yesterday,
that The Three Degrees were what egomaniacs of actors required. I am not
saying that about Judi Dench, the actress who is to receive her third
honorary degree, now from the self-named Royal Scottish Academy which is
going to make her a Doctor of Drama. This is according to a report in my
own blatt. I am a touch confused at this and suspect that wur journalist
got it a wee bit wrong because I think it may be the Royal Scottish
Academy of Music and Drama what issued this honour. The RSA is what
visual artists get into and not very easily at that. The RSAMD is a very
different creature. To be honoured by the painters' gallery you would
have to be practically Michelangelo Buonarroti. But why does Judi Dench
want to turn up at this festival of scholastic daftness?
She already has two honorary degrees, one from Warwick Yooni and the
other from that of York. They are each what Kingsley Amis famously
described as ''not so much red-brick universities as white tile''. Or
was it John Wayne? Doesn't matter really. What does is why these bloody
universities keep on shoving out quite worthless bits of vellum to
actresses and biscuit manufacturers and disgraced ex-Cabinet Ministers.
Or why any of the latter accept this dubious honour. Dubious it is too.
The yoonis only give you the damned things because they want your
hard-earned cash or reputation. Furthermore it is a ceremony which makes
a Masonic initiation look dignified, and that is a turn-up.
My own graduation ceremony was the most sensible I have ever seen. In
my days art students were delivered of diplomas because qualifications
for artists at the end of the day are about what your work looks like.
You can't go jouking about galleries telling Cyril Gerber that you
simply have to have a one-man/woman exhibition because you got a
first-class degree from Patna College of Art. I collected my diploma
from Jimmy Seatter, the jannie at Edinburgh C of A, and signed for to
Alice with whom I was then having a wee fling. Alice was a college
secretary and didn't much need evidence of a diploma for finding me a
fine-looking fellow. She never looked at my art: she was too busy
looking at me, and quite right too. What are artists doing greeting
about wanting any qualifications at all, let alone first-class degrees
and other nonsense?
Actually nobody much looks at diplomas and degrees after the first
year you are out of the institutions in which you have laboured.
Employers have given the impression to many a student of the past few
years that they demand awfy good qualifications. Indeed they don't: the
best qualification any candidate for a job can have is being a boss's
child. The best degree you can ever have when it comes to employment is
a first-class degree in Nepotism. And that is hard for a graduate, fresh
and clever and in the process of forgetting everything you have learned
within weeks of leaving university. Not that the very word
''university'' means much anymore. We have seen so many ersatz little
centres of learning being given yooni status that it is only a matter of
time -- say next year really -- before we will have nursery schools
capping their four-year-old students with gowns and rolled up bits of
mince and the paper written in Latin.
Yesterday I found yet another group of graduates, celebrating in the
bars around the Herald building, for Strathclyde University is near. In
the Press Bar I discovered young Kate Turnbull, who has just finished at
the old ''Tech'' with a good degree in Eng Lit, and her boyfriend there,
a graduate himself and son of one of our own writers and her parents
from Durham with her. I went out and brought in champagne, in an ice
bucket, the lot. Because I never saw such joy and pleasure. Later I saw
the same in lots of my ports of call. Kids everywhere with proud
parents. I remember once, in Battlefield Road in Glasgow, a sign across
a cobbler's window which stated: ''Closed Tuesday, due to daughter's
graduation at Glasgow University. Two-one honours degree.'' My heart
went out to everybody, certainly the unabashed mum and dad.
Because it is a great day, the sudden point at which, in the hushed
hall of, in the case of Strathclyde University, the old Barony Church,
next to which was my primary school and my home, for my father was the
janitor there, when all that you did as a little boy and girl from the
very day you embarked on the Great Exploration of Education, from
primary school to the big one, to college and university, from infancy
to adulthood, now you have made it and proved it.
It is undeniably one of the greatest days of your life. That is why,
every year, I send across a bottle of champers to a graduate, flushed
with triumph. Because savour it, the young ones: it disnae last.
Disillusion creeps in very quickly. And worse. You start to crave
honours you don't need and are not entitled to, just like elderly
actresses really. Make the most of a young sweetness of moment when it
is worth it, for once in your life.

Almost a quarter of a century after being dismantled and put into
storage, the magnificent White Dinning Room from Miss Cranston's Tea
Rooms in Ingram Street, Glasgow, is back in all its splendour to become
the centrepiece of a major exhibition of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's
work. Duncan Black reveals how the room was restored
ONE of the finest interiors designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh has
been painstakingly recreated to play the starring role in the
biggest-ever exhibition of his work.
It has taken more than two years to reassemble the original pieces of
the Ladies' Luncheon Room, popularly known as the White Dining Room,
from Miss Cranston's Ingram Street Tea Rooms.
Miss Cranston's tea rooms were the height of artistic elegance in the
early years of this century, popular as meeting places and especially
favoured by the temperance movement.
The tea room culture gradually went out of fashion, and the Ingram
Street premises were taken over by the former Glasgow Corporation in the
1950s. But, when the building was sold to Stakis Hotels in the early
1970s, the corporation had the foresight to have the interiors
dismantled and put into store.
Yesterday, the White Dining Room was revealed again in its former
glory. The task of reassembling some 500 pieces in this
three-dimensional jigsaw was undertaken by Glasgow Museums conservator
Andrew Stone, who said: ''It is wonderful finally to get everything back
together. I think it has worked very well.''
All the pieces were numbered and front elevations drawn when the
interiors were dismantled. Still, the jigsaw required a lot of sifting
through the timber, fixtures and fittings which had been stored.
Unfortunately, the storage conditions over the years were not always
ideal, and some pieces suffered damage from rats and even a couple of
outbreaks of fire.
The room, which measures approximately 25ft square and 14ft high, has
been reassembled in the converted Trinity Church, Lynedoch Street,
Glasgow, which afforded the necessary space for the operation.
Designed in 1900 and opened in 1901, the White Dining Room was the
first tea room for which Mackintosh was given sole design control. He
used the opportunity to enlist the talents of his future wife, Margaret
Macdonald, who created one of the gesso panels adorning the walls.
It was one of six rooms in the Ingram Street premises. Mr Stone said
it was hoped that all of the rooms would eventually be reassembled in
one building as a museum attraction.
Next year, the White Dining Room will form the centrepiece of the
biggest-ever exhibition of the work of Mackintosh, generally regarded as
Scotland's greatest architect and designer.
The exhibition will be staged at Glasgow's McLellan Galleries from May
until September as part of the city's 1996 Festival of the Visual Arts.
Organised by Glasgow Museums in collaboration with the Hunterian Art
Gallery and Glasgow School of Art, which hold the world's two most
important Mackintosh collections, it will feature about 300 exhibits
including many never displayed in public before.
The major retrospective is being backed by #250,000 of sponsorship
from the Whyte &amp; Mackay drinks company. After its Glasgow run, the
exhibition will go to New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.

THE Jazz Festival has proved a peach of a week for guitar heads, with
Mike Walker, John Paracelli, Bill Frisell and Martin Taylor all making
appearances.
But Wednesday night belonged to Jim Mullen, or more precisely, The Jim
Mullen Quartet. Mullen is both a generous player and leader, letting his
band explore the deeper depths of the music, and with a group of
intrepid explorers named Bradley, Cottle and O'Higgins behind him, new
areas were chartered.
Kicking off with a fluid, blues tinged number, we were given no
respite, as the musicians fed off each other, daring themselves to push
ever forward. Amongst the tracks from his new album, Rule Of Thumb, we
got Don't Ask, a number chock full of pleasing, recurring themes, played
over some fine funk grooves.
Prior to the interval, the standing room only audience was treated to
Mr Phone Bone, which saw the band swap funk for straight ahead bop,
O'Higgins displaying some inspired modal playing which just kept on
pushin' on. In many ways it was O'Higgins' night, the ecstatic audience
lapping up every note whilst egging him for more.
Even when ''taking it down'', as on Victor Young's My Foolish Heart,
Mullen can't resist slipping in the odd sly funk lick. Keeping it all
together from behind the front-line was Mike Bradley, who could very
well be the finest sticksman in the country. His playing is so
surprising, it sounds as though he has just sat down and invented the
art of the drum solo from scratch. But then this band injects a zest
into everything they play.

SO the holidays are safe. There will be no second round, no General
Election. Instead, the strangest fortnight in recent British politics
culminated on Wednesday night with the Michael Forsyth Chase, a
20-minute event involving a quick circuit around College Green, with
frequent pit stops to feed waiting television reporters.
The new Secretary of State for Scotland opened his charm offensive by
granting a series of interviews to the electronic media. Newspapers were
told to make do with a prepared statement issued by his press office.
Requests for one-to-one interviews were politely but firmly turned down.
That politicians habitually choose to favour people who stare at the
expense of people who read is one of the great unfairnesses of the
modern age. Still, only one thing for it: gate-crash the new,
sharing-caring Michael's television appearances. So at 6.30 we were all
there, hovering on the edge of Scottish Television's pitch, waiting to
pounce.
College Green, for those unfamiliar with Westminster's competing
centres of power, is the small park across the street from the House of
Commons used by television reporters for their broadcasts. It replaced
what used to be a stretch of Georgian houses along Abingdon Street that
were bombed in the last war. The site was cleared and landscaped, with a
few benches, some shrubs, bisecting concrete walkways, and an
unattractive Henry Moore bronze.
It is usually empty, but events over the past two weeks turned it into
a temporary media village, with politicians doing the rounds, hawking
their soundbites from camera to camera. The running joke was that there
were more MPs at any given moment talking on College Green than there
were debating in the Commons Chamber. At times in the past few days the
crowds gathering to watch this electronic version of parliamentary
democracy have outstripped those queueing to get into Westminster Abbey
next door.
But on Wednesday night things were winding down. Only a handful of
television cameras remained in action, waiting for the Scottish
Secretary. He began by telling Scottish Television he would be
Scotland's man in the Cabinet, not the other way around.
He then waited patiently to say the same thing to Grampian Television,
missing a vote in the Commons in the process. ''I don't want to be
sacked,'' he announced.
The BBC were next to drag him off, for a quick chat with their man in
the studio. Mr Forsyth duly repeated himself. ''I'll listen, but no
tartan tax, no extra politicians or bureaucrats.''
The photographers followed, clicking away at Mr Forsyth with Big Ben
over his shoulder. He smiled, then offered to glower. We followed his
progress around the green, pleading quietly with his private secretary
and press officer to grant us an audience.
Eventually, after a direct request and two minutes for World Service
Television, Mr Forsyth relented, allowing us five minutes for a
considered exchange. While we talked, tourists took our picture. And
then it was over. Two weeks of madness forgotten. We were back to
normal.
For that was the most striking effect of the drama which began with
John Major declaring ''put up or shut up'', and finished with our search
for Mr Forsyth: the rest of British politics ceased to exist. Despite
the best efforts of the Opposition, and the unchanged daily business of
the two Houses of Parliament, nothing could distract the Westminster
press corps from the one story that mattered.
On Tuesday afternoon, for example, in the slum that passes for the
Herald's Commons office, I took a call from Lady Saltoun of Abernethy.
Were we aware, she wanted to know, that she was the instigator of a
five-hour debate later that day in the Lords on proposals for
reconsidering Scotland's place in the Union? My honest answer was no.
What I didn't have the heart to tell her was that her debate would be
ignored. It coincided with the announcement of the leadership ballot
result, and there would be no reporters with a moment to spare. I looked
up the debate in Hansard yesterday. It runs to 60 pages, and might as
well have not happened.
It's been the same in other fields. Press releases offered by the
assistants of the various Opposition spokesmen have been bluntly
refused. ''Anyone interested in agriculture abuses?'' No. ''Anyone doing
anything on the compensation recovery unit?'' No. If it wasn't about the
leadership, it wasn't happening.
0   Thankfully, normality now descends on Westminster, and we can get
on with the business of summer: planning holidays, watching England get
trounced at cricket, working out ways of avoiding covering the Pensions
Bill, and preparing for the fun and excitement Michael Forsyth is bound
to bring.

Sarajevo, Thursday
HEAVY fighting raged today in the Bosnian Muslim enclave of Srebrenica
even as EU peace envoy Carl Bildt played down the chances of any early
success in efforts to end the war.
Bildt met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo and said
later that neighbouring Serbia's tough President Slobodan Milosevic was
a key factor in diplomatic moves to silence the guns.
He said he had no plans to see Bosnian Serb leaders at their
headquarters in Pale, outside Sarajevo, a decision sure to irritate the
isolated leadership there.
While Bildt talked of negotiations the two warring sides battled over
a wide area of Bosnia.
Bosnian Serbs and government troops clashed around the eastern Muslim
enclave of Srebrenica, a UN ''safe area'', with Serb forces firing half
a dozen rockets.
The fiercest fighting was in the south of the enclave as Muslim-led
government and Bosnian Serb troops traded tank, artillery, and mortar
fire.
''It seems to be heavy fighting,'' said UN spokesman Gary Coward.
''Given the continuing skirmishes, the commando-style raids into and out
of the enclave, it is a picture of a build-up of tension.''
The Dutch UN base in Srebrenica was hit by several shells and an
observation post was targeted by tank and mortar fire, the UN said.
As Bildt held his talks in Sarajevo, two children were killed and
seven people were wounded by a shell that landed outside a block of
flats.
Meanwhile UN officials today insisted that the new British and
French-led Rapid Reaction Force would would operate free of any vetoes
from remote civilian masters.
They said Yasushi Akashi, civilian chief of the beleaguered UN peace
mission, was closely consulted on guidelines for the force and would
have to approve any specific sortie.
However British and French generals Rupert Smith and Bernard Janvier
would set its strategy on the ground once action was cleared.--Reuter.

THIS is a tale of three gigs, two short ones with a long one in the
middle. They came on, they played. Latin jazz. Irresistible rhythms.
Sparkling solos on trumpet and piano. Percussion breaks that make you
want to take up the timbales. They can't keep this up, I thought. They
didn't.
Later, much later, the party finally started, with everyone invited to
cha cha cha. We were in Havana. Havana heckuva time. The band were hot.
The saxophone player was telling us stories. The piano player was
sparkling again. Then the trumpeter reached for the stratosphere one
more time and your reviewer reached for the Anadins.
Anadin that made me do that was the gig in the middle. Dead fast bebop
tunes with solos that were a triumph of technique and blowing power over
musicality. Sandoval's visit to the piano that had party piece written
through it like rock has Blackpool. Sandoval back on the trumpet showing
that not only can he play very high and very loud, he can play very low
and very loud, too.
But the bit that had me shaking my head, although not for long because
it hurt, and not in awe either, was Blue Monk, played to a chicken in a
basket rhythm and with more notes than the Bank of England. Sacrilege.
Agony. Until Sandoval redeemed it with a muted trumpet and bass duet. A
lovely touch, but alas, not enough to stop the migraine.

The maturity, talent, and guile of a young Glasgow-based company have
taken them through to a national youth theatre showcase -- and should
take them much further, says Carole Woddis
SOMEWHAT ironically, the young victim Elizabeth says ''Faith moves
mountains'' in Odon von Horvath's Faith, Hope and Charity -- a play
chosen by the Glasgow-based Moral Support Theatre company, which was one
of only 10 companies chosen to take part in a national showcase of youth
theatre at the National Theatre.
BT Connections is a usefully timed collaboration between BT and the
National Theatre aimed at re-engaging young people just when there has
grown a widespread belief that youth theatre and theatre in education
had become more or less extinct -- south of the Border at least. The
scheme may be unlikely to make up what has been lost in the past decade
but if this is the shape of things to come, then there is cause for
qualified celebration.
''We believe the arts is one of those areas that can help to recreate
confidence,'' says BT's Roger Board. BT have put #400,000 at the
National's disposal for a scheme that has not only helped them meet
their commitment of ''putting something back into the community'' but
also enabled some 2000 young people and more than 200 groups over the
past couple of years to come into direct contact with some of our most
established and most promising playwrights.
The BT money, however, has mostly covered the administration costs of
running the scheme (under the auspices of regional theatres) leaving
each group individually to fund its own productions. It was no small
feat then for the semi-professional, but unfunded, Moral Support company
of Glasgow to emerge as one of this year's winners.
Zoe Klinger and Liz Strachan are both in their early twenties and
their two-year-old company is definitely a group on the way up, with
invites to perform at the Traverse (where Faith, Hope and Charity was
first showcased), Eden Court, and at the Lilian Baylis in London already
under their belt. Previous productions have been described as ''Twin
Peaks meets DV-8'' while another, Panacea, was praised as having ''bags
of talent, wit and insight all round''.
Initially from London, the Glasgow University graduates are now firm
Glasgowphiles. ''There's so much happening here,'' says Klinger. ''It's
perfect for us and what we want to do.''
Running the company has meant a hand-to-mouth existence, raising money
for every one of their nine productions, as indeed they had to do with
Faith, Hope and Charity. Christopher Hampton's adaptation of the von
Horvath was originally seen at London's Lyric Hammersmith in 1989 when
an unknown Julia Ormond played Elizabeth. For Moral Support it was an
obvious choice, they say, because of its subject matter.
A bleakly ironic and bitter fable about a young girl driven to despair
in 1930s Germany by poverty and bureaucratic petty mindedness, Strachan
says no particular political agenda was intended, although its affinity
with present-day youth unemployment is shockingly obvious.
''We're known for a quirky, tragi-comic kind of presentation,'' says
Klinger, ''and we felt the Germanic style and characters just suited our
own style.''
The production was staged in London at the National's Cottesloe
theatre and despite some unforeseen technical difficulties and the
group's extreme youth for such a complex piece (the age range,
amazingly, was 13 to 21), Klinger and Strachan proved they certainly
have plenty of guile and a powerful theatrical sense about them. Using a
minimum of resources -- four large wardrobes, three chairs and a cast of
seven -- the performers covered 17 characters. Among them, Emma
Faulkner's shaven-haired Elizabeth and Stephen Bullock, appearing in a
variety of guises, were outstanding. With public support, and some
well-deserved public funding, Moral Support look to have a golden future
ahead of them.

Milan, Thursday
A GERMAN court today banned Benetton's controversial advertising
campaign, stamping another black mark on the ''bad boy'' of clothing.
The appeals court in Karlsruhe ruled that Benetton violated
competition laws by exploiting human suffering.
German retailers had decided to stop paying for some Benetton goods
delivered to their stores, alleging that its advertising offended
customers, causing sales to plummet and forcing many German merchants to
declare bankruptcy.
However analysts said today's ban on images of children doing hard
labour and a body stamped ''HIV positive'' was unlikely to cause the
company much harm, with any publicity from the case being in the spirit
of the shock tactics of the campaign itself.
''Benetton rather gains -- maybe not in image or popularity -- but
certainly in terms of the fact that people talk about Benetton,'' said
equity analyst Marco Nascimbeni.
The judges ruled that the offending advertisements violated German
standards not just because of their shocking nature or because they had
no relation to Benetton's products, but because they sought to make
consumers feel pity for the suffering of people and animals.
''Anyone who exploits feelings of pity in such an intense way for
commercial interests violates competition law,'' they said.
Benetton vowed to fight the ruling. ''We're going to take the case to
Germany's constitutional court,'' said a spokewoman. ''We're not the
only ones using emotion for commercial gain. Other companies use
emotions when advertising their products.''
Oliviero Toscani, the photographer responsible for the campaign, said:
''I think the Germans are particularly sensitive about this matter
because they possess a great sense of guilt.''
However advertising executives and lawyers in Germany welcomed the
ruling, saying it drew a clear line on what was acceptable practice
without drastically curbing the right to free speech.
''The dam now won't burst and let loose a flood towards extremely
emotional advertising in Germany,'' said the Advertising Industry
Association.
''Human suffering and misery may not be abused for business
purposes.''

AFTER her third encore last night, when she stood at the far end of
the piano, threw her accompanist Mark Markham a fiery look, and launched
into a version of the Habanera from Bizet's Carmen that wasn't so much
an interpretation as an outrageous tease, Jessye Norman finally had her
Glasgow crowd eating out of her hand, and could have done anything she
liked. Which she did, promptly following her carnal Carmen with a
distinctly un-gospelly version of He's Got the Whole World in His Hands
in which she encouraged her audience to get-to-clappin' then took off
into the vocal stratosphere.
Earlier, the Norman conquest hadn't, perhaps, gone entirely according
to plan. In a recital that did not (for connoisseurs of the great diva)
show her absolutely at her best, there may have been tons of magic, but
there were only a few moments in which she displayed her greatness, and
a single one that represented any kind of peak.
Not that it was entirely her fault. She looked stunning, swathed in a
creation that resembled a cross between a toga and a kimono -- a mix of
white and brilliant blues, gold shoes, that incredible mane, and an
inimitable regal aura: superb pianist Mark Markham sat obediently while
the great one composed herself before an imperious nod of the head
instructed him to begin.
Things went wrong from the start. The opening item -- Alban Berg's
intensely concentrated Seven Early Songs -- is a close-knit set, some of
which end on a half-breath, all of which flow into each other and create
a single mood. Each was interrupted by applause. Norman's concentration
was ruined and she had to pause on every occasion to reconstruct the
mood. I thought she would blow a fuse; she kept her cool, but before the
next set -- Wolf's Morike songs -- she pointedly asked the audience to
hold their applause till the end.
A lot didn't, and -- perhaps for that reason -- she wasn't very well
focused; intonation was erratic and phrasing sometimes disjointed. At
last, after the interval, with a set of sexy French songs by Poulenc,
Norman went into smoky, sensual mode, hitting her high point -- and at
her best, she was awesome -- in a devastatingly laid-back, sultry waltz.
By her final selection -- Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder -- she was at
last producing that inimitable sound: stately, controlled, and as
intense as a laser beam. Perhaps, for ardent Norman specialists, not her
most polished performance; the crowd, however, will have none of that
view -- they went daft, bawled for more, and got it, many times.

EIGG folk walk on eggshells; Knoydart's future is foggy. Under the tin
roofs of community halls the crofters and craft workers convene. Their
anxiety is Anglo-Scottish. White settler and native Gael share the same
platform, but once again it's Scotland's frail and lonely places which
are up for grabs in the great Caledonian land rush. Whose turn to be
laird? Visionary German artist or anonymous tax shelter company with
bank accounts in Lichtenstein and Curacao?
The mysterious Maruma met his new tenants on Eigg this week and made
all the right noises: ''environmental study'', ''soft tourism'', ''#15m
investment'', ''conservation''. His fast-track route to the locals'
hearts, however, was his offer to seek ways to allow them to buy their
own houses. ''It was all that people would want,'' said the secretary of
their residents' association.
Maybe it was, maybe it is. Broken dreams and squandered promises are
common as midges in the Highlands and Islands but perhaps, in the
short-term, Professor Maruma will indeed fulfill his ambitions for his
new property and honour his pledges to the islanders. That isn't the
point; the point is that good landlords, in the long-term, are no more
acceptable than bad ones. It isn't the lairds who need reforming, it's
the system.
A few years ago I watched another improving laird lay out before the
television camera a prospectus for another prime chunk of Scotland: more
''sympathetic'' tourism, more small businesses, more empty houses
occupied, more efficient management of the mainspring sporting economy.
To fund these designs the owner of the 80,000-acre estate found it
necessary to do some asset-stripping, selling hefty parcels of land to
shadowy foreign interests, auctioning some of the estate cottages
without their tenants' knowledge. ''If it works for the area and the
people who live here,'' said the landlord, ''I'll have done the right
thing.''
For a time it seemed to be working. The lost wilderness of the last
wilderness was recovered; on the margins of Knoydart there was new life.
Ruins were restored. The population increased. Single-handed
entrepreneurs with small but beautiful talents -- craft workers,
caterers, woodmen -- revived the village of Inverie. But when the Surrey
property developer, Philip Rhodes, tired of his Highland fief and moved
on, there were only 16,500 acres left to sell.
No other country in Europe -- no other country in the developed world
-- is as careless of its land as Britain, and no other part of Britain
is more vulnerable than the Scottish Highlands, which bring out the
folie de grandeur of rich romantics and the cupidity of opportunists in
equal measure. If you look at the past 50 years on the Knoydart
peninsula you see the textbook case for land law reform, which comes no
nearer with the Labour Party's vague threats and absent policies.
Knoydart is the Caledonian Shangri-la. It occupies two spaces in the
national psyche. One belongs to our need to know that there are airy
spaces of rare quiet beyond the reach of traffic cones, and the other
belongs to its function as pinball in the heartless game of Highland
land dealing, which brings chronic insecurity to the communities of the
great estates and saps their vitality. In this area, Knoydart's potent
symbolism has been hard earned.
The estate's most notorious landlord was the Midlands brewer, Lord
Brockett, the Hitler enthusiast who owned it in the thirties. His
high-handed husbandry inspired the Knoydart land grab of 1948, when
seven crofters unilaterally staked out pieces of land. The estate's most
speculative landlord was the former government spokesman Lord Hesketh,
who bought it in 1972 for #250,000 and sold it five months later for
#1.2m.
But at least it remained intact, and it was on the market again in
1982, when the Ministry of Defence began taking an interest in its 80
square miles of exhilarating waste; just the job for training squaddies.
Their overtures were unpopular and they retreated, preparing the way for
Philip Rhodes. One tiny, positive by-blow of Rhodes's piecemeal land
sales was the 3500 acres which the John Muir Trust were able to buy for
#105,000 -- an early toehold on the wilderness for the young
conservation organisation, and a prize one: the mighty Munro of Ladhar
Bheinn.
One May afternoon I watched members of the trust drive a deer fence
into a flank of Ladhar Bheinn above Loch Hourn. They sought to protect
the Caledonian Pine seedlings of their regeneration programme, and they
explained something about the Highland landscape which is now my teaser
for other urban visitors.
Question: The hill is bare and steep, but there are birch and alder
growing thickly in the clefts channelled by burns and meltwater -- why?
Answer: No, it isn't the water which nurtures the trees, it's the lie
of the land. When the trees seed themselves the deer can't get into the
gullies to nibble the saplings.
Why didn't I think of that? Such modest revelations about the forces
which shape the land make me realise that it's us, those of us who live
in cities, who have grown remote -- from everything including the
awesome physical competence of those who live on the empty edges of
Scotland.
When I was in Knoydart I stayed at Doune, a crofthouse on its western
extremity, which on the roadless peninsula means a walk of seven miles
over the hills or a sail down the Sound of Sleat from Mallaig. Doune is
the home and business of Alan and Mary Robinson, ''white settlers'' who
bought the shell of the crofthouse in the early eighties, converted it,
added a jetty, a boathouse, a timber lodge in the next bay, and a 39ft
fast launch equipped for divers. They were helped only by their sons,
who were barely in their teens.
This is the calibre of person who sustains and is sustained by
Knoydart, not the drawing-room lairds who up and leave or the Bahamian
company directors who never visit. Two years ago Philip Rhodes sold his
remnant of the estate to the jute company Titaghur, which couldn't
advance its plan to establish an adventure training centre for
disadvantaged youth, and now it's on the market again. The showbiz
impresario Cameron Mackintosh, who owns the neighbouring North Morar
estate, is interested in helping a public conservation body to take it
over.
Well-intentioned, I'm sure. But the system still needs reform.

* Oh, Mr Porter, what shall I do -- I want to change baby, but it's
hopeless in the loo! It's a refrain unlikely to be heard on Sussex Scot
train services between Brighton and Glasgow this summer. CrossCountry is
providing specially designed slip-down changing tables with toilet
improvements that include new sinks, flooring and wall panels.
Meantime, Baby Fresh Wipes have compiled a guide to the best
baby-changing facilities around Britain, based on parents'
recommendations. Nominations in the Glasgow area include Marks and
Spencer, Argyle Street; Children's World, Crow Road; and Asda Stores.
In Edinburgh, Asda at The Jewel; Boots, Princes Street; the Gyle
Shopping Centre; and Ratho Park Hotel win plaudits for hygiene, access
and good signposting. Mothercare stores throughout Scotland are
commended.
* APART from the odd neighbourly dig at sprouting weeds, you may not
have viewed your garden as a haven for wildlife. During a 15-year study,
one garden had 1782 animal visitors and 422 plants took root.
Now Wildlife Insite is appealing for gardeners to join a survey in
Lothian. The Secret Garden project will identify all the wild plants and
animals -- birds, butterflies, mammals and amphibians -- that drop in
during the gardening year (a bird flying over doesn't count!). Full
details and a green survey form from Bob Saville, Wildlife Insite, 102
Corstorphine Road, Edinburgh, EH12 6TZ. Phone: 0131-313 4143.
* DOMESTIC animals will purr with approval at a mail order catalogue
catering exclusively for them. Pet Necessities claims to have just about
everything for a healthy and entertaining lifestyle. Examples: a finger
toothbrush for cleaning canine back teeth and breath-fresheners. Even
arthritis can be treated with a homeopathic remedy, while tartan
mattresses are a dog's delight.
Cat furniture includes pyramids for kittens, a scratching post shaped
like a rat, and cat cradles and cottages in high density foam. The Pet
Necessities catalogue is free from PO Box 34, Osset, West Yorks WF4 6XF.
Phone: 01924-810840.
* WHAT'S claimed to be Scotland's longest lace course -- staged over
four and a half days at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh -- is
launching into its fifteenth year this month. Anyone who fancies their
hand at the hobby is invited to an open afternoon on July 26. The course
itself, which attracted students of all ages, runs from July 24 to 28,
with residential or non-residential facilities. Classes are restricted
to no more than 14 to ensure close personal supervision. Details from
0131-553 8316 or 332 0173.
* IF you're off to a holiday cottage with a portable TV, you won't
need a licence to cover it while your set at home isn't being used
simultaneously. A TV detector van is just as likely to turn up at a
campsite, and for 20 years law-abiding Chris Witts unwittingly forked
out for a second licence. Following advice from the Consumers
Association, Mr Witts has got a #767 refund. Anyone who thinks they are
due a refund, or wants more information should phone TV Licensing's
helpline on 0117-9763763.

WE have interesting news on some demographic changes in pub life in
downtown Partick. The westerly inner suburb of Glasgow is well known for
the polarisation of its howffs. To be exact, they tend to be of a Celtic
or Rangers persuasion.
Chiefest of the blue-nose pubs is the Rosevale, partly-owned by
Rangers manager Walter Smith and run by Paul Burns. The Rosevale was put
out of commission some months ago by a fire which left its adherents
with nowhere to talk about Rangers, admire the red, white, and blue
decor, and discuss flute band music.
The Rosevalites became something of a diaspora on Dumbarton Road until
they found a new home. It is a pub called the Mansfield which used to be
called Mullins and is very much, shall we say, at the Celtic end of
Partick.
The Mansfield/Mullins is owned by one Colin Beattie, a well-known
Partick publican and patron of the lively Ettrick Bar nearby. He has
made the Rosevale team welcome until their own place is ready to
re-open.
Thus we have chaps in colourful uniforms who are wont to go for the
odd musical walk at this time of year rubbing shoulders with Mullins
customers who would not rate The Sash in their top 10 hits.
When the Rosevalites depart to their refurbished home, Mr Beattie
plans to turn the Mansfield/Mullins into a Celtic pub. Celtic with a
hard C that is, in terms of culture. Music, folklore, you know the kind
of thing. A Scottish-Irish place.
So far as we know, the Third World War has not yet broken out. This
could be to do with the arrangement that anyone who fractures the peace
process will be barred from all the pubs in Partick.
Mr Beattie tells us if this arrangement can work in Partick there is
hope yet for Bosnia.
Teaser
A READER'S missive instructs us to check the entertainment classified
advertisement section of the Scotsman newspaper under the heading
''Saunas''. Amid the notices for sundry steamy Edinburgh establishments
we find: ''Relax in the company of Edinburgh's most exotic birds.
Siamese Firebacks, Salmon Crested Cockatoss (sic), Mackaws, Chinese
Pheasants and Eagle Owls. Edinbugh Zoo. Always full of life. Tel: 0131
334 9171. No appointment necessary.''
Don't worry, it's nothing kinky or even bestial. Just Edinburgh Zoo
trying to attract attention again.
More malarkey
IT is with great reluctance we return to the subject of malapropisms.
But blame Anne Biggerstaff of Thornwood, Glasgow, who tells me her
husband hunted all through Safeway looking for ''low-life yoghurts''.
And her sister who referred to people being ''as thick as two peas'' and
who calls the chaps who take away the rubbish ''the refuge men''.
Nor will we mention the Glasgow lady sifting through The Herald
property pages who spotted a house by Alexander ''Greek'' Thomson and
another of Georgian vintage and concluded that there were two houses
available built by ''George the Greek''.
Trial cruise
WE would have thought that by now most people would go to any lengths
to avoid the O J Simpson trial. But not the Yanks. Carnival Cruise Lines
is offering a three-day O J sail from Los Angeles. On board will be
half-a-dozen Simpson trial experts including a professor of law, a TV
commentator, and a former juror.
Part of the ''fun'' will be a mock trial. The event co-ordinator, one
Ms Jane Doctor, said: ''There is a real need for this to happen. People
are very affected by this trial.''
Frankly, we would rather visit Millport on the paddle steamer
Waverley. And that's saying something.
* On the O J theme, we hear his lawyers are so good even he believes
he is innocent.
* An unreported exchange between his lawyers and O J: ''There's good
news and bad news. Bad news, they've definitely identified the blood at
the murder scene as belonging to you. Good news, your cholesterol level
is really low.''
Jock Tamson's enfants
THAT'S your time, mon vieux, for the Auld Alliance anecdote
competition. No entries accepted after Monday.
Not in le raffle for the star prizes is colleague Michael Fry for a
fascinating discussion he had with a French rugby fan in an Edinburgh
bar on the subject of sexual perversion. The French chap was informed
that ''Ici en Ecosse, nous foutons les moutons.'' No, we will not
translate.
William Smith of Langside, Glasgow, recalls when he was drafted in as
a translator at a council function some years ago in darkest Falkirk.
The deal was that he would translate the cooncillor's speech first into
English and then into French for the benefit of the visiting twin-town
person.
The translation was going quite well until the visitor interrupted
with the words: ''Dinnae bother. Ah wis in a prisoner o' war camp wi' a
bunch o' Cameronians and ah learnt hoo tae speak English frae them. An'
onywey, in Europe we're a' Jock Tamson's bairns.''
Fair game
WE note the publicity for an event called the Glasgow Show on Glasgow
Green two weeks hence. Organised by the city's parks and recreation
department, it will feature such traditional Fair activities as
falconry, a Shetland Pony Grand National, Monster Rocket Trucks, and
racing camels. Oh, and a medieval display called ''The Battle of Glasgow
Green''.

HOW often have you calculated the cost of staying in a hotel, only to
be dumbfounded when presented with a bill which far exceeds what you
expected.
In addition to the cost of the room itself, all the little extras add
up, not the least of which are phone charges. Guests are often
astonished to discover the three-minute phone call they made from their
hotel room cost them a few pounds, and in some cases people have even
been charged for Freefone calls. To add to the frustration, guests are
sometimes forced to wait in a queue before obtaining an outside line.
A Sheraton Hotel spokesperson said that guests should expect to pay
extra for the luxury of having a telephone beside their bed. It's all
part of a good service, and if that's what you want, there's a price
attached.
''It costs #2 to get an outside line, including Freefone numbers,''
the spokesperson said. ''But that's not unusual -- it's certainly
standard across London.''
Not all hotel chains levy such exorbitant fees. The Marriott Hotel
recently abolished their telephone access charge and do not have an
additional fee for Freefone, and neither do Scottish &amp; Newcastle hotels.
A spokesperson for S &amp; N said that if guests wanted to ring from a BT
telephone at the normal standard rate, they could do so from hotel
lobbies. Alternatively, they could call from their bedroom at 25p per
unit. All of their telephone charges are displayed in the bedroom's
information folder, so guests aren't presented with any nasty shocks.
Independently-owned hotels charge guests about 20p per unit, which
works out to be reasonable if the call is brief. A spokesperson for the
Glynhill Hotel, Renfrew, said that if guests were making long-distance
phone calls, substantial reductions can be allowed to ease the expense.
''There is sometimes a reducing charge for the number of units the
guest has used up,'' she explained.
''Most hotels should have a standard rate of 20p a unit, or lobby
phones where you only have to pay 10p. There should be a call sheet
beside the phone so you can see how much you're being charged -- if
there isn't they could have hidden charges. You should always check
first.''
So is it fair to expect a #2 levy before you even start a conversation
from your hotel room? Not according to most guests. As one independent
hotelier succinctly put it: ''That's an absolute con!''

Milan, Thursday
A JUDGE in Milan today ordered some of the top names in Italian
fashion, including Giorgio Armani, Gianfranco Ferre, and Krizia, to
stand trial on corruption charges.
The decision followed a nine-month investigation by Milan's ''Clean
Hands'' anti-graft prosecutors into allegations that fashion houses paid
tax inspectors for lenient audits.
A total of 18 people were sent for trial with the case due to start on
September 20.
Those accused included Santo Versace, brother of fashion ace Gianni
Versace; Gerolamo Etro, head of the Etro design house; and several
senior officers from Italy's finance police. Ferre is chief designer for
the house of Dior in Paris.
Many of the designers have admitted handing over bribes, but say they
were forced to do so by rapacious tax inspectors who supplemented their
modest incomes by demanding kickbacks.
''She was bullied. It was nearly a 'pay up or we'll burn your shop
down' type of racket,'' said a lawyer for Krizia last year, claiming she
had to hand over a #124,000 bribe.
Armani's lawyer, Oreste Dominioni, said last October the silver-haired
designer whose graceful clothes have come to symbolise Italian chic told
magistrates he paid a bribe, reportedly #40,000, to tax inspectors for
easy treatment in 1990.
Milan's Clean Hands magistrates have become household figures in Italy
over the last three years for their relentless investigation into
corruption throughout Italy's political and business worlds.
News of their inquiry into the glamorous world of Italian high fashion
broke last September, sending shockwaves through the well-heeled
industry, just as the houses were preparing to show their spring and
summer collections in Milan.
''The news has already soiled the 'Made in Italy' label,'' Giuseppe
Della Schiava, head of the National Chamber of Fashion, said at the
time.--Reuter.

High-alcohol drinks are luring teenagers into a world of drunkenness.
Anna McDermott warns of an increase
in youth-targeted campaigns
THE canine connection with high alcohol, youth-targeted liquor is an
unlikely one. ''Two Dogs'' is an Australian alcoholic lemonade, set to
be unleashed this month on an unsuspecting British market, while ''Mad
Dog'', or MD 20/20 as it is also known, has sponsored the United Kingdom
DJ of the Year.
Beware -- these dogs bite. MD 20/20, known at the moment as a street
drink, comes in both a wine bottle size and ''handy to hide''
pocket-sized bottles. It is about to hit the clubs in a ''mini-blitz''.
Blitz being the operative word: at 13.1% alcohol, it is stronger than
Strongbow Super and twice the strength of an average beer.
There is more. Drinking most alcohol is, like smoking, an acquired
taste. Correction, was. It used to be a gradual process of initiation as
teenagers developed a taste for alcohol or added the coke to their rum
to make it more palatable.
Now there's a #2m ad campaign for ''Bacardi Breezers'', so that like
the Murphy's (stout), there's no need for bitterness. Drinks like Mad
Dog, which is the most popular of the ''fruit-flavoured'' fortified
wines, looks like fruit juice and tastes of Orange Jubilee, Kiwi Lemon,
Hawaiian Blue or Cherry Banana.
Names more suited to ice lollies than alcohol, or as a Scottish youth
worker said: ''You wouldn't know whether to drink it or put it in your
bath.'' And it's attractively priced at roughly 30p per unit of alcohol.
A few bottles could supply a girl with her weekly
Government-recommended limit of 14 units. And it is girls who are
drinking and in increasing numbers even more than the boys, according to
one youth worker. She describes this as a relatively recent and worrying
phenomenon.
Glasgow-based youth worker Colin Simpson agrees, especially with these
sweet alcoholic drinks. ''The girls are as bad as the boys,'' he says.
According to the Greater Glasgow Health Board, one in three 16 to
19-year-olds in the area gets drunk once a week.
But surely there are some restrictions on peddling this type of potent
legal drug to young people? After all, every year more than 1000 people
under the age of 15 end up in hospital with acute alcohol poisoning.
The Advertising Standards Authority has ''specific rules'' on alcohol
advertising that state: ''Ads should not be directed at people under 18,
through the selection of media, style of presentation, content or
context in which they appear.'' They go further, ''No medium should be
used to advertise alcoholic drinks if more than 25% of its audience is
under 18 years of age.''
Forgive my failure to grasp this ''specific rule'', but what then are
''ice'' beer ads doing on bus shelters? How can major spirits producers
be considering their first TV ads for whisky? Oh, but the latter was a
40-year long voluntary agreement between distillers and TV companies,
which is now over. So that's OK then, and entirely unrelated to the
decreasing numbers of young people drinking whisky at 40% proof.
Research funded by the Alcohol Education and Research Council shows
that English teenagers are drinking more than their French or Spanish
counterparts.
Targeting young drinkers by the trade is imperative. Could there be a
connection between the number of young English drinkers and for
instance, alcohol sponsorship of sports, which is banned in France but
proliferates here?
Meanwhile MD 20/20 purchasers are being offered a ''privilege card''
for cut-price entry to 20 of the UK's ''leading clubs'', and money off
their next purchase, plus a chance to buy the T-shirt. Their product
manager sees this type of sponsorship, promoted on 350,000 bottles and
supported with ''heavyweight consumer activity in clubs'' as a ''great
opportunity to build the profile of MD 20/20 within key young people's
venues.''
So much for the self-regulatory nature of alcohol advertising. The
Professional Association of Teachers' report Cracking Drugs In Schools,
recently recommended a ban on alcohol advertising within a half mile
radius of every school.
The ASA also has a rule about ads not featuring real or fictitious
characters who are likely to appeal to people under 18 in a way that
would encourage them to drink. Surely not a veiled reference to a
certain small alien club-goer enticing youngsters to drink more cider.
The British Medical Association recently published a report which
recommended ''health warnings (to) be incorporated in alcohol
advertisements.'' On the evidence so far, that seems about as likely as
the drinks industry supporting sensible drinking.
The BMA also called for clearer labelling of the alcohol content and
number of units in any drink. However, labelling the strength of alcohol
on bottles or cans, recently reintroduced for beer in the US, can simply
encourage some consumers to go for the highest strength.
The American National Council on Drug and Alcohol Dependence also
fears labelling could be damaging without regulations to prevent brewers
using alcohol content as a marketing tool. Over here the ASA has another
rule that alcoholic drinks ''should not be presented as preferable
because of their high alcohol content''.
The BMA report supporting the retention of existing recommended weekly
''low risk'' limits ''coincided'' with the Social Affairs Unit
suggestion that the Government should ''cautiously investigate''
lowering the age limit to buy alcohol in pubs. Surprise, surprise, the
Social Affairs Unit would also like to see a relaxation of the safe
limits.
Back in the real world, Colin Simpson from the Govanhill Youth Project
does not believe that legal age limits are much of a barrier. Buying
alcohol for under-age drinkers is so common in his area, he says, you
can see the queue outside the off-license before it opens.
News this week that Scottish off-licensees are to tackle this problem
by refusing to sell to under-age customers was welcomed by a Greater
Glasgow Health Board spokesperson, who commented this was a legal
obligation anyway.
In west London one over-age teenager described how she had been
physically threatened by a group of schoolgirls in uniform when she
refused to buy alcohol for them. So maybe the Government need not
investigate a lower age limit, when effectively one exists, policed by
renegade schoolgirls.
Simpson says: ''Under eighteens arrive at the Friday night disco
barely fit to stand. Apart from MD 20/20, Thunderbird and ciders like
TNT, Ice Dragon, or Diamond White are the extra strong drinks the kids
like.''
He's particularly concerned that drinks like MD 20/20 are ''promoting
a dangerous use of drink''. He describes how it is treated as if it were
a soft drink: lots of it drunk very quickly, often outdoors and with
friends, before going to a disco.
Simpson finds the ''cynical marketing techniques targeted at 13 to
16-year-olds'' particularly abhorrent. What could be more cynical than
an alcoholic ''lemonade'', which according to the trade press ''gives
little sign of its 4.2% ABV strength in its flavour.''
Even before its launch, ''Two Dogs'' has had enough adverse publicity
to guarantee its popularity, albeit briefly. Perhaps it's time for some
new ''dangerous dogs'' drinking legislation. With ice beer companies
already preparing vending machines to make their product even more
accessible, how can buying alcohol under the legal age limit possibly be
controlled?
As the Government reviews its guidelines on recommended ''safe''
limits for drinking, the manufacturers of fruit-flavoured booze and ice
beer look set to exploit ever more invidious ways of hitting the youth
market.
''Hooper's Hooch'', an even stronger alcoholic lemonade at 4.7%
launched this week by Bass to rival Two Dogs is already in pubs, wine
stores and Tesco supermarkets.
Sarah Berger, director of Drinkline, the national alcohol helpline,
says: ''I am shocked by the ease with which the alcohol industry can
introduce new drinks obviously designed for kids. This makes it even
more vital that the Government retains the existing recommended drinking
limits of 21 units a week for men and 14 units for women. We get
thousands of calls on our helpline from drinkers who started young and
now have serious problems.''
A joint report from the Royal Colleges of Physicians and
Psychiatrists, and GPs published this week reiterates this advice.

Bangkok, Thursday
THE trial of two Britons charged with trying to smuggle heroin out of
Thailand was adjourned for another month today to allow a defence lawyer
to call a witness.
A lawyer representing Robert Lock, 30, from Cambridge, told the
Bangkok criminal court he needed more time to subpoena an airline
official in Bangkok to testify at the trial.
The trial of Mr Lock and Sandra Gregory, 29, from Sowerby Bridge, west
Yorkshire, will resume on August 10.
The pair were arrested on heroin trafficking charges at Bangkok
airport in February 1993.
They were searched as they were about to board a flight to Japan and
Miss Gregory was found with 3[1/2]oz of heroin in her possession.
She has pleaded guilty while Mr Lock has pleaded innocent.
Miss Gregory, whose parents live near Aberdeen, told the court at an
earlier hearing that Mr Lock had promised to pay her for carrying the
drugs to Japan. Mr Lock then accused Thai police of putting pressure on
Miss Gregory into testifying against him.
Heroin trafficking carries the death penalty in Thailand though the
sentence is invariably commuted to a lengthy prison term.--Reuter.

It's not all wine and roses for those seeking partners through dating
agencies, reports STEPHEN McGINTY
WHEN lonely people looking for love joined Moments Of Magic, they did
not expect the Glasgow-based dating agency to disappear. It did however
-- not in a puff of smoke but behind a paper trail of bad-debts and
distressed clients.
Michelle Wiseman's firm promised new friends, glittering social events
and a chance at true happiness for a #200 fee.
Their brochure of events included Sunday Brunch, a #25 introductory
affair of drinks, buffet and wines with the promise of a popular venue.
Moments Dinner Parties were #35 with the allure of dinner, wines and
dancing; while the Murder Mystery Evening ironically claimed to
introduce guests to a world of ''intrigue and murder''.
Yet Cupid's arrow wounded dozens when, late last year, the firm's
Bearsden office was abandoned. The only dinner ever scheduled was
cancelled three days before it was to take place, leaving Ayrshire
restaurateur Lindsay McQuarter to absorb the loss of a full night's
business. It was the vulnerable clients who suffered most, with money
lost, hopes dashed and trust shattered.
They will not be surprised by the report published by Which? magazine,
watchdog of the Consumers' Association, which this week condemned the
very poor practice of a number of Britain's dating agencies. Included
are criticisms of the biggest in Britain, Dateline, which claims to have
between 35-40,000 clients.
The report concludes: ''Our research shows that there is some
extremely bad paractice in the dating industry. Security checks on
client identity can be lax, agency closures can leave clients owed
considerable sums of money, and some agency employees can be guilty of
unacceptable conduct.''
Researchers for the magazine found it was possible to join agencies
under assumed names and receive the full home addresses and phone
numbers of single women. One female researcher was asked out on a date
by the male employee of one agency, while it was discovered many
agencies regularly fold with little  hope of a refund.
During the course of their investigations a Which? researcher claimed
he joined Dateline International, was not asked for proof of identity,
and received the full addresses of three out of five possible matches.
The agency, which costs #150 to join, has reacted angrily to the article
and dismissed the allegations as ''absolute nonsense''.
Dateline managing director Mr John Patterson was not available for
comment.
In a market where it is not uncommon to pay fees of #800, Lovefinder
is the bargain basement. For just #25 for men and #10 for ladies,
clients are promised four phone-numbers on the very day they join.
However for the Which? researcher they offered a speedier service. She
claimed she was asked out on a date by her interviewer.
The firm's owner, Mr Ibrahim Shevket insisted this was not a gross
abuse of trust, but merely a method of finding the perfect partner.''In
our form we ask for background, and people often tick European, but they
could be Asian and born in this country. Meeting them helps us check
this out in case a man doesn't want to go out with coloured women, or
vice versa.''
Sandra Menoni believes legislation is necessary to protect the public
from unscrupulous and dangerous dating agencies, which she believes are
springing up, only to disappear with increasing regularity.
The founder over two years ago of Initial Approach, an agency which,
from its base in Dunblane, covers the whole of Scotland, said: ''It's
like any other industry, you are always going to get cowboys. These
people spring up and then spring away in a matter of months.
''What worries me most of all is what happens to their information;
who looks after all the confidential names and addresses. It would be
very easy for them to fall into the wrong hands.''
The clients of Initial Approach range from 21-78 years old and are
often drawn from AB1 social circles. The reasons for joining are as
varied as members, who maybe divorced, widowed, or workaholics locked
into a pattern which affords little time for socialising.
A variety of memberships is on offer. For #125 members attend monthly
social events such as clay-pigeon shooting and 4x4 off-road driving. A
one-to-one membership which includes introductions costs #225, while a
joint membership is #320.
Ms Menoni insists the proper way to run an agency is to conduct
personal interviews with each member in an attempt to find the right
partner. ''This is such a serious business, you are dealing with
people's emotions and you have to be careful. You have to be security
conscious.''
A number of dating agencies currently operate in Glasgow. While many
have only an answering machine which requests customers leave details,
some, like Carl Ford Introductions, have a more personal approach. When
contacted by The Herald, it was explained that though there was no fee
for joining, it would cost #30 per match.
A spokeswoman explained that no personal details would be given out
until the lady had agreed, and even then a meeting point would probably
be arranged first. ''It's just a wee bit of safety for the ladies,'' she
explained.
At the moment there is no legislation governing dating agencies, but a
body called The Association Of British Introduction Agencies (ABIA)
offers a code of practice to those who wish to join.
Agencies must state all costs involved to the clients and the likely
number of dates they can expect to receive for this sum. Prior to
joining agencies go through a trial period where their client list is
studied to see if it is large enough to offer a satisfactory service.
If an agency that is affiliated to the ABIA collapses, its clients
will be offered membership to another agency. Yet currently the ABIA
does not require its members to check for proof of identity.
Many people never did receive an introduction by Michelle Wiseman's
firm, Moments of Magic, to the partner of their dreams, or even a
reintroduction to their own money.
Now money can be replaced and introductions arrive when you least
expect it, yet the safety of vulnerable women can never be overlooked,
or under-estimated.

Portland, Oregon, Thursday
A FORMER follower of late guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh testified today
that he helped to make hundreds of Oregonians ill in the early 1980s in
a plot aimed at expanding the free-love cult's political power.
David Knapp, known as Swami Krishna Deva when he was the elected mayor
of the eastern Oregon town of Rajneeshpuram, said he spread a substance
on doorknobs of the Wasco County courthouse and on lettuce at a
restaurant salad bar as part of a plot to sicken voters to keep them
home on Election Day.
Knapp, testifying for the prosecution in the murder conspiracy trial
of Britons Sally-Anne Croft and Susan Hagan, said he acted on the
direction of Ma Anand Sheela, the all-powerful personal secretary of the
so-called rich man's guru.
The bearded Californian said Sheela's strategy, which resulted in the
salmonella poisoning of hundreds of people, was aimed at increasing the
cult's political clout at a time when its expansion was being hampered
by zoning laws.
Jurors in the case also heard taped telephone conversations between
Knapp and John Mathis, then at the US Department of Justice, about the
intensifying criminal investigation of the cult's activities.
Prosecutors contend that Croft and Hagan, who were top financial
officials in the cult, participated in a plot -- never carried out -- to
kill then-US Attorney Charles Turner. He was leading the investigation
into the group.
Mathis said in one conversation that law-enforcement authorities were
out ''to sink the Rajneesh'' and Sheela, and in June 1985 Knapp and
Mathis discussed a federal grand jury that had been empanelled by Turner
to investigate the cult.
''It was during this time frame that Sheela said Turner needed to be
killed,'' Knapp said.
He testified that during the spring of 1985, as the cult's legal and
financial problems mounted, officials held almost nightly meetings in
Sheela's bedroom at the commune ranch house known as Jesus Grove.
Knapp said Croft and Hagan, then known as Ma Prem Savita and Ma Anand
Su, were present at most of the meetings. However Knapp, whose testimony
was continuing, stopped short of saying that they were there when the
alleged plot to murder Turner was discussed.
Sheela, who was indicted in the alleged murder conspiracy after being
freed from prison on separate charges, is believed to be living in
Switzerland. Croft and Hagan were extradited from Britain last year
after a long fight.
Knapp, who served two years in prison for his role in the massive
immigration fraud that led to the commune's collapse and the deportation
of Rajneesh, said up to 6000 people lived on the remote Oregon ranch at
its mid-1980s peak.
The two Britons were among the elite at the commune: Croft was in
charge of the money and Hagan headed the heavy equipment department.
Croft allegedly supplied the money to buy five guns that could not be
traced to the commune. Prosecutors say Hagan was a fervent follower who
gave a pep talk in support of the plot.
The commune was built through manipulation of well-meaning followers
and fuelled by paranoia at the top, said prosecutor T J Reardon.
''It's a classic case of human frailty and corruption, the arrogance
of power and the manipulation of the devoted,'' he said.--Reuter/AP.

THE appointment of Michael Portillo as Defence Secretary could be good
news for GEC-Marconi and Scotland in the company's bid to win a #2000m
contract to supply the Army with helicopter gunships, according to
defence analysts.
The Edinburgh-based firm has submitted the cheapest tender for the
91-aircraft deal, based on British improvements to an upgraded US Bell
Cobra helicopter to be known as the Venom.
The Army's preferred choice is the Gulf War-proven McDonnell-Douglas
Apache, with Yeovil's Westland company as the UK sub-contractor. The
other contender is the Franco-German Tiger, which would involve British
Aerospace.
Mr Portillo, a right-wing Euro-sceptic, is likely to ignore the
tremendous pressure being applied by the French and Germans to force a
purchase of the Tiger. The French have already threatened that the UK
could be excluded from future collaborative defence and aerospace
projects unless it buys European.
The new defence chief is also a committed free-marketeer whose first
priority will be value for money. GEC's Venom would be the least costly,
and would create or safeguard 500 Scottish jobs. The other bids are
almost #500m more expensive.
Sash Tusa, a leading analyst with City firm UBS, said last night: ''If
there is a choice between something which makes sense financially and
something which makes sense in a European way, then European programmes
are likely to get short shrift. Mr Portillo's appointment is not good
news for the Tiger lobby.''
However, Whitehall sources say that the new Defence Secretary's power
to dictate the placing of multi-billion pound contracts could be
countered by the Cabinet. Michael Heseltine, as deputy Prime Minister,
favours the Westland option.
A decision on the award of the contract had been expected before the
parliamentary summer recess begins on July 20. The leadership battle in
the Conservative Party and the subsequent Cabinet reshuffle means that
this could now be delayed by several weeks.
* Defence Secretary Michael Portillo last night declared he was
looking forward to his new job ''immensely''.
But the former Employment sEcretary made no further comments as he
posed with his ministerial team outside the Ministry of Defence.
Many commentators believe he has been sidelined by the Prime Minister
into a post where he has little input on economic and European Union
policies.
However, if he was disappointed, he was not showing it and beamed
widely for the men and women of the media.

Los Angeles, Thursday
O J SIMPSON'S prosecutors rested their case today after five months
and 58 witnesses that transfixed people in the United States and beyond
with the tale of an American football hero allegedly turned murderer.
The defence, which opens its case on Monday, is expected to take a
matter of weeks before leaving Simpson's fate in the hands of a jury
that already has lost 10 of the original 24 jurors and alternates.
It still is uncertain whether Simpson will take the stand to defend
himself against charges of slashing ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron
Goldman to death in a jealous rage on June 12 last year.
The prosecution built its case on blood and fibres and the mournful
wailings of a barking dog but in the end still had no eyewitness, no
murder weapon, and no definite motive.
Just before resting, the prosecution changed its mind to finish its
case by calling Ms Simpson's mother, Juditha, as its final witness.
''The people rest,'' said prosecutor Marcia Clark.
Prosecutors relied on testimony and evidence presentations from 58
witnesses in their attempt to prove to jurors that Simpson stabbed his
ex-wife and her friend to death.
Defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran said he planned to call his first
witness on Monday. He added, however, that the defence would decide
overnight on whether to file a motion for directed verdict of acquittal
on the basis of insufficient evidence.
Jurors were excused until Monday, but lawyers were told to return
tomorrow for a hearing on the admissibility of evidence and the
motion.--AP.

Kirsty Scott investigates the haphazard world of medical experiments
where there is legislation to protect animals -- but none for people
IT WAS in the 1960s that some doctors in America stumbled across a
group of black men who had contracted syphilis. Excited at the prospect
of a full-scale experiment, they withheld the diagnosis from their
patients and waited to see what happened as the disease ran its course.
Several years later in the UK, a group of Coventry women who had gone
to their GPs with complaints ranging from arthritis to headaches were
allegedly fed radioactive iodine without their knowledge as part of a
nutrition test.
Such cases have caused outrage, but, more than 20 years on, the
structures in place to protect the public from experimentation appear at
best to be informal and at worst haphazard.
''We have very careful legislation that covers the use of animals but
none that governs the use of people,'' said Professor Sheila McLean, the
International Bar Association Professor of Law and Ethics in Medicine at
Glasgow University.
Basically, experiments on people are largely controlled by the common
laws of consent and negligence and, more formally, by the network of
research ethics committees which are attached to every hospital where
research is conducted. Other guidelines include the Declaration of
Helsinki, which sets out parameters in which experiments can be
conducted.
''For any research they want to do they have got to get the approval
of research ethics committees,'' said Professor McLean. ''These were set
up in the early 1970s on the recommendation of the Royal Colleges . . .
The reason that they have been effective is that no reputable journal
and no grant-giving body will publish an article or give money unless
the experiment is research-ethic approved.''
Yet the research ethics committees cover experiments for clinical
trials. What if a doctor decides to try a mini-experiment on one or two
patients, one that he or she doesn't hope to have written up or funded.
''If a doctor tries an innovative treatment, let's say a doctor had
tried all the standard treatments and decided to try something
innovative and either he had not given enough information or he did
something wrong, that would be negligent,'' said Professor McLean.
In situations such as this, it is a 1955 case from Scotland -- Hunter
v Hanley -- which sets the standard. In that instance, a doctor used a
different size of needle for an injection and it broke off, embedding
itself in the patient's arm. The doctor eventually won the case because
the patient couldn't prove that no other doctor would have done the same
thing.
If an experiment is conducted on someone without consent the patient
has recourse to claims of negligence and, if it is a gross failure to
inform or involves fraud or deception, assault.
Despite the checks, Professor McLean acknowledges public concern.
''From the point of view of the public the fear is not the doctor who
has said we have tried everything else, how do you fancy having a go at
this, it's the large-scale trials going on.''
It was one large-scale experiment in the 1980s which led to calls for
tighter controls of treatment trials after a woman claimed her consent
had not been sought to take part in a breast-cancer test conducted by
Kings College Hospital in London. Evelyn Thomas said she hadn't been
asked about the trials, one of which required her to be denied treatment
to enable comparisons with other patients.
Professor McLean said what had gone wrong in the Evelyn Thomas
situation was not so much about research but about communication between
doctor and patient -- an area potentially rife with problems.
''There are real concerns about whether patients can really
understand,'' she said. ''In the US in particular there is concern about
terminally-ill research subjects or those who are HIV positive who are
told: 'We want to try a new treatment.' How informed is their consent?
It's a bit worrying.''
If the position is not clear-cut for the living, it is even more hazy
when it comes to the dead.
''There aren't rights of ownership in a dead body and it's not really
very clear what can be done with corpses,'' said Professor McLean.
''Either the fiscal or the coroner has some limited rights and the
relatives have got obligations to dispose of the body. That doesn't mean
you can take bits out of it. It is a kind of a grey area what you can do
with corpses, the main underlying principle is that you don't do
anything which would be undignified.''
What if someone with no relatives had died in hospital?
''As long as they don't breach this dignity bit they have the power to
dispose of the body and arguably they could take bits of tissue if they
wanted to for legitimate research,'' said Professor McLean, ''but they
would need to get the approval of the ethics committee.'' Each committee
must have some lay members.
Across at the offices of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties,
they have just drawn up a report on the UN's International Covenant of
Civil and Political Rights, which includes, in Article 7, the
declaration that no-one shall be subject to medical or scientific
experimentation without their free consent.
SCCL spokesman Brian Thomson said they were disturbed at recent press
reports about human experimentation and would point out that the UK
Government was a signatory to the covenant and ought to have created
laws to comply with its contents.
''This is one of your fundamental human rights, you should not be
experimented on or subject to any experimentation without your consent.
In order for that to be protected you have to have legislation in
place.''
In the syphilis case from 1960s America, it took a fellow medic to
expose the outrage. Here, Professor McLean would like to see some legal
involvement to tackle the wider issue.
''We have gone a long way to controlling human experimentation but . .
. what we don't have is a definition of experimentation that fits every
bill. What we assume will protect patients is that doctors will be
honest with them on the rules about consent and should tell them the
risks, the benefits, and the alternatives to their treatment.
''I would like to see legislative intervention. I would like to see us
tackling the question about what are the values underlying the use of
human subjects in research. It is easy to assume that research is a good
thing. I think that's an assumption we need to test a bit.''
What you can do with corpses is a grey area. The main underlying
principle is that you don't do anything which would be undignified.
If a doctor tried something innovative and had not given enough
information, or did something wrong, that would be negligent

JOHN MAJOR brought in five new Ministers to the Government yesterday
in the finishing touches to his reshuffle.
Raymond Robertson, Angela Knight, Oliver Heald, Cheryl Gillan, and
James Clappison join the Government payroll for the first time as
parliamentary Under-Secretaries.
All five are recruited from the ranks of parliamentary private
secretaries (PPS) -- unpaid ministerial aides.
Their appointments once again offer little by way of compensation to
the Tory right as they are generally seen as coming from the mainstream
of the party.
As part of the changes, Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro and
National Heritage Minister Viscount Astor leave the Government.
Mr Robertson, who worked with Northern Ireland Minister Michael
Ancram, joins the Scottish Office.
Mrs Knight, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's PPS, joins the Treasury as
Economic Secretary.
Mr Heald, aide to William Waldegrave, goes to the Department of Social
Security.
Miss Gillan, who was PPS to the Leader of the Lords Viscount Ancram,
enters the newly-merged Department for Education and Employment.
Mr Clappison, aide to Home Office Minister Lady Blatch, joins the
Department of the Environment.
Other ministerial moves see the Earl of Lindsay go from the Lords'
Whips to the Scottish Office, Tim Boswell go from education to become
parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture. Earl Howe goes
from agriculture to defence, Lord Inglewood moves from deputy chief whip
in the Lords to National Heritage, while Andrew Mitchell leaves the
Commons whips to join social security.

Muzaffarabad, Thursday
A KASHMIRI militant leader based in Pakistan appealed to separatists
to release four Western tourists kidnapped in the Indian-ruled part of
the disputed Kashmir region.
Keith Mangan, 33, Paul Wells, 23, and two Americans were seized as
they walked in hills described as dangerous by the Foreign Office, which
had advised tourists not to go there.
In Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan-controlled Azad (free) Kashmir,
Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Amanullah Khan accused India
of creating conditions where the militants had to resort to such
activities to achieve their goal.
However he said he appreciated the militants' gesture in freeing two
women and an elderly Canadian man from among their captives and added
that the four men still held must also be released.
The Azad Kashmir leader of Pakistan's Islamic fundamentalist
Jamaat-i-Islami party, Abdur Rashid Turabi, also issued a statement
condemning the kidnapping as ''a conspiracy against the Kashmiri freedom
struggle''.
He said the kidnappers could not be from the ''freedom fighters as
their act was against the liberation movement''.
Tonight Mr Mangan's mother told of how her daughter-in-law broke the
news.
Mr Mangan's wife, Julie, 33, was initially also seized, but was later
freed with another woman tourist and the Canadian, plus two guides.
Mrs Mavis Mangan was waiting anxiously for news at her home in
Middlesbrough, Cleveland.
She said after her daughter-in-law's phone call from India: ''She was
calm but is obviously very worried, as we are. It is difficult to know
what to do when this is happening so far away -- you feel so
powerless.''
Mr Mangan's father Charles, 60, a retired steelworker, said: ''We are
worried sick and feel so helpless.''
Mr Wells, a first year student at South Nottingham College,
Nottingham, was on a six-week trekking holiday after being left some
money in a legacy.
His father, Robert, was waiting for news at their home in Blackburn,
Lancashire. However his mother Diane was in hospital for a routine
operation, unaware of his ordeal.
Mr Wells, a department head at Debenhams, said: ''I don't know what to
tell her.''
He was telephoned early today by his son's girlfriend Cass Mosley,
from Norwich, who was studying art at Nottingham.
''We couldn't believe it. Cass had telephoned the Foreign Office
before they went and was told it was safe.
''They were going through India to the Himalayas, drawing and taking
pictures on the way. It was a holiday of a lifetime for them.''
The abducted Americans were named as John Donald and Donald Freid.
In June last year militants kidnapped two Britons and freed them 17
days later. Last October militants seized three Britons and one American
in New Delhi. They were freed after a shoot-out with police.
The Foreign Office said tonight that a political officer from the High
Commission in Delhi, Philip Barton, had arrived in Srinagar, the Kashmir
summer capital, to liaise with local authorities.--Reuter.

KILLER Major came out guns blazing yesterday. Unhappily, all he fired
were blanks.
Since Tuesday's great victory, the Prime Minister's advisers have been
working overtime. No longer must he be grey and nice. His decision to
lay his political life on the line had paid off.
He might not have knocked the former Welsh Secretary out of the ring
but a win is a win. When he was in a corner he had been tough. He was
still in a corner. He had to stay tough.
Mr Major tried. With the imposing blond presence of his new deputy
planked firmly on his left side, he sought to recapture the glories of
last week's Question Time when he had given a star performance shooting
down Mr Blair and several of his sidekicks.
First, we had to watch Mr Dennis Skinner (Bolsover -- Lab.) bring into
play his blunderbuss, a weapon which makes a loud noise but nowadays
does little damage.
''You won't be surprised to hear I won't be congratulating you,'' he
told the newly promoted Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg quite
accurately.
Mr Skinner being rude is one of the least surprising sights at
Westminster. He made a bad pun on Mr Hogg's name and was rude about the
previous Minister. Mr Hogg cheerfully admitted that his name was quite a
suitable one for an Agriculture Minister, but accused Mr Skinner of
being ''curmudgeonly'' about nice Mr Waldegrave.
Being curmudgeonly comes naturally to Mr Skinner just as being
crushing was no problem for Margaret Thatcher. Mr Major's onslaughts
rarely sound as if they come from the heart.
Mr Redwood qualified his ''good loser'' intervention by trusting that
some of the ideas he had put forward in the leadership election would
make an important contribution to the next Tory election victory.
Mr Major restrained the temptation to doubt if plans for a new royal
yacht would sweep the country. He thanked Mr Redwood for being a good
loser and abstained from commenting on the value of his ideological
contributions.
Mr Blair got off to a good start, congratulating Mr Major on keeping
his job and observing that he could do so ''with rather more sincerity''
than Mr Redwood.
He then niggled away about the Government's new nursery policy being a
''con.'' He went for the ''parents of three-year-olds' vote'' by
complaining that these tots were being excluded. The tots will have to
wait 15 years to take their revenge.
Mr Major tried to take his for the taunts he endured during the last
fortnight by calling Mr Blair's own future into question. He wouldn't
last long after Labour lost the next election. This sounded more like
bravado than a serious threat and he hardly lifted his game by telling
Mr Paddy Ashdown ''you ought not to be so silly.''
When Mr Paul Flynn (Newport East -- Lab.) quoted the Redwood campaign
slogan ''no change, no chance'' at him, Mr Major's riposte that Labour
often made ''rather arrogant remarks'' before losing General Elections
was less than devastating.
Another good reason for not having Mr Redwood back in the Cabinet
surfaced. He had simply put together too many damaging quotes about his
boss.
Mr Nick Ainger (Pembroke -- Lab.) wittily purloined another about Mr
Major's leadership being characterised by ''uncertainty based on
indecision.'' Was it the job of his new deputy Prime Minister to take
the decisions ''or haven't you decided yet?'' The House liked it.
That sort of thing was all very well, retorted Mr Major, a little
pettishly, but after the next election Labour still would be sitting on
the Opposition side of the chamber. So there. All it needed was for him
to stamp his foot.
If the First Secretary of State turns up regularly for these events,
it is going to be a source of regular pain for him to have to sit there
thinking how much better he would do it.

THE elevation of Raymond Robertson, Tory MP for Aberdeen South, to
Under-Secretary of State at the Scottish Office opens up the possibility
of a return to education for the former history and modern studies
teacher.
Although Mr Robertson is also a former card-carrying member of the
Educational Institute of Scotland -- as he reminded MPs during the
committee stages of the local government Bill -- teachers' leaders will
expect no favours from him, if, as expected, he is appointed Education
Minister.
When he has occasionally spoken on education matters, it has been, in
terms of substance and presentation, in the Michael Forsyth manner.
Mr Forsyth may now be a caring, sharing, listening Secretary of State
but those who were involved in bruising encounters with him in his two
spells as Education Minister recall a different species of political
animal.
They fear that Mr Robertson -- a former pupil of Garrion Academy,
Wishaw, which has since closed, and a graduate of Glasgow University --
belongs to the combative, deaf-to-persuasive-argument species.
An EIS assistant secretary, Mr Ian McKay, said yesterday: ''Mr Forsyth
did not cover himself with glory when he was Education Minister and we
have spent three or four years repairing the damage.
''If Mr Robertson is to come in, and if he is to be a Minister in the
Michael Forsyth mould, we would look for assurances that Scottish
education is not to be at the receiving end of another onslaught.
''The last time around, education suffered because Mr Forsyth was
following an ideological path. We do not want education to suffer again
because the Tory Party is in disarray.''
Mrs Judith Gillespie, a leading parental activist in Scotland who
frequently crossed swords with Mr Forsyth, said last night that a
Forsyth-Robertson team ''would not do Scottish education any favours''.
She said: ''It is quite interesting that a man associated with so many
failed policies like compulsory national testing in primary schools
should come back and try to say he has a lot to offer.
''It will be very worrying if he moves away from the consensus that
has been built recently and decides to go for confrontation, because
that is what he was known for.''
One of the matters Mr Forsyth will take into account as he shuffles
his pack is the plan to merge the industry and education departments in
the Scottish Office in November.

'Tartan Tax' will be the Tory taunt over the price tag of a Scottish
Parliament, predicts Robbie Dinwoodie
BRACE yourselves for some fairly lurid billboards. On past form these
might have a pair of hairy legs, hands perhaps nervously clutching a
plaid hem. ''What does George have under his kilt?'' the caption might
ask, or, marginally less risque, ''What does George keep in his
sporran?''
The answer will be the buzz-phrase for Scottish politics in months to
come, ''the Tartan Tax''. In the real world the plans for a Scottish
Parliament have been drawn up by a broad constitutional convention with
Labour partnering Liberal Democrats and non-partisan supporters of Home
Rule.
But in the land of party political propaganda, the proposed Parliament
in Edinburgh will carry a heavy price tag and it will be characterised
as the personal creation of Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson.
The more Tory critics trot out the phrase ''George's Tartan Tax'', the
more Labour will round on the new Scottish Secretary as ''Michael Poll
Tax''. Mr Forsyth, in turn, will continue the battle of the slogans,
pointing back to the fiasco over Labour's ''roof tax''. To coin a phrase
from the Tory leadership campaign, ''It's debate, Jim, but not as we
know it''.
We can therefore expect to hear the proposed taxation powers of a
Scottish Parliament sloganised relentlessly between now and the General
Election. It would be going too far to say this is the only idea of
their campaign, but it will certainly be the big idea.
Michael Forsyth said as much within hours of his appointment, pointing
out that he had been castigated during the community charge saga for
supporting the introduction of a tax in Scotland which was not levied in
England. ''Here we have the same people now proposing as an act of
policy that Scotland uniquely should pay a tartan tax.''
Mr Forsyth is a highly intelligent man and must know that what is
being proposed is not a tax as such but a power, which may or may not be
used, to raise or lower income tax by up to 3p on the standard rate,
depending on manifesto commitments in an election campaign, and the
expressed will of the electorate at the ballot box.
But the new Scottish Secretary is nothing if not a streetfighter and
skilled propagandist. When Labour countered the community charge with
plans for a rates-style charge based on property, Mr Forsyth was quick
to dub it the roof tax.
Scots party chairman Sir Michael Hirst, speaking in London yesterday
between meetings with leading figures in the Tory hierarchy, said: ''The
assault on Labour's tax-raising assembly will be pursued with vigour by
Michael Forsyth and the party will do everything it can to support that
onslaught. It is an absolute nonsense that Scots should be expected to
pay for this madcap scheme.''
The Tory strategy is based on their perception -- hotly denied by
Labour -- that the leadership in general and Tony Blair in particular
are developing cold feet about the proposal. In the same way that a
sustained attack forced them to withdraw on regional assemblies for
England, they can be made to back off on taxation power for a Scottish
Parliament.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson insists there is no sign of
any such wobble, and claims the Conservative criticisms are inaccurate,
opportunistic and hypocritical. ''We have built our plan over many
years, having researched it and taken on board the fact that the
proposals in the 1970s were attacked for not having revenue-raising
powers,'' he said.
''We have to continue to underline that the Parliament will have
powers to reduce as well as raise taxation. It will be a modest power,
probably held as a reserve power, which the electorate will ensure will
not be used carelessly, but essential if the model is to stand the test
of criticism.''
He points out that in the 1970s the critics of the proposed Scottish
Assembly singled out the fact that it had no taxation power.
Opponents of constitutional change will therefore damn proposals
either way, whether they have, or do not have, such a power. Liberal
Democrats agree. Scottish leader Jim Wallace said: ''The ability to
raise taxes is fundamental to the accountability of a Scottish
Parliament.
''They are going to take decisions that have spending implications and
it is vital that they have to consider where that money is going to come
from. The whole essence of the Scottish Parliament is that it has the
power to take decisions to change the lives of people in Scotland.''
Meanwhile the SNP look on, happy for the two sides to cut each other
up on the Home Rule debate, while drawing up their own plans for lower
business taxes to give an independent Scotland a competitive edge. ''He
has not been in the job five minutes and already we have Michael
Forsyth's first blunder,'' said SNP business spokesperson Fergus Ewing,
''mistaking our strong case for independence with the weakness of the
scheme for devolution.''

WELSH Labour MPs yesterday described the appointment of William Hague
as Secretary of State for Wales as an ''insult'' to the principality.
Minutes before 34-year-old Mr Hague's first Cabinet meeting, 11 Welsh
Labour MPs led by Shadow Welsh Secretary Ron Davies marched to No 10 to
deliver a letter of protest.
The letter said the MPs ''deplored'' Mr Major's choice of Mr Hague as
Welsh Secretary, making him the youngest Tory Cabinet member for 100
years.
''He had not to our knowledge expressed any interest hitherto in
Wales.''
The MPs said they were angry that once again the post of Welsh
Secretary was going to an MP with an English seat who could use Wales
purely for political ambition.
They said the previous Welsh Secretary John Redwood had used the Welsh
Office as a ''plank for personal ambitions and Wales as a testing ground
for idiosyncratic opinions''.
They claimed Mr Hague was ''a culmination of a series of bad choices
of Conservative Secretaries of State for Wales. We feel deeply at this
latest insult. Our anger is mirrored by the overwhelming majority of the
people of Wales.''

THE House of Lords yesterday found in favour of 1300 school dinner
workers who were dismissed in 1991 and re-employed on inferior pay rates
and holiday entitlements.
This result, which will have widespread repercussions for workers
similarly affected under the compulsory competitive tendering (CCT)
policy, will mean more than #2m in back-pay for the staff.
Their union, Unison, first brought the case before an industrial
tribunal in Leeds in February 1992. It was ruled that the women had been
the subject of discrimination and were entitled to equal pay with men
employed by the North Yorkshire County Council who had not been treated
in the same way.
The council appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal which
overturned the decision. Unison failed in a subsequent bid at the Court
of Appeal. Yesterday's success was hailed by associate general secretary
Rodney Bickerstaffe as a huge victory.
''It punches a hole in the Government's CCT programme by protecting
the employment rights of low paid women workers and demonstrates how
important it is for staff to have the protection of union membership,''
he said.
The caterers, who should each receive about #1500 in back-pay, were on
#3.31 an hour before their rate was reduced to #3 an hour. Since then
the gap with male staff has widened.
Earlier yesterday, Mr Bickerstaffe urged Premier John Major to justify
his call for a ''classless society'' by backing a campaign for a
national minimum wage in order to ''reunite'' Britain.
He told a TUC conference that without a minimum wage the good employer
would be undercut by the bad, and the bad employer would be undercut by
the worst.
Both Unison and the TGWU have strong policy commitments to a level of
#4 to #4.15 an hour which they intend pursuing at the forthcoming TUC
and Labour Party conferences.

TORY right-wingers strongly hinted last night that Sir Marcus Fox,
chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative back benchers, could face
a challenge for the second year running.
Such a contest would be widely interpreted as a shot across the bows
of the Prime Minister, in the wake of the Cabinet shift to the
centre-left.
One right-winger said last night: ''We are determined to have someone
who can put our point across to the Government.''
Sir Marcus, who saw off a challenge last year from Euro-sceptic
right-winger Sir Nicholas Bonsor, infuriated key players on the Tory
right by his conduct during the leadership election.
Critics point out that he declared the 1922 executive committee, of 18
members, was four-square behind Mr Major, when members such as John
Townend and David Evans later declared their support for challenger John
Redwood.
Right-wingers are also critical of the way the leadership ballot was
conducted under his auspices.
Sir Marcus showed members of the press round the Commons committee
room where voting took place after complaints from Redwood supporters --
including Mr Evans -- of lack of privacy and the fact that only Major
supporters were acting as scrutineers.
A right-wing MP said: ''Sir Marcus has disappointed vast numbers of my
colleagues. He has proved to be like the Prime Minister himself --
accident prone.''
A challenge was ''likely'' when party rules allow -- normally the
second week of November, in the next parliamentary session, he added.
Right-wingers suggested that Mr Bob Dunn, a member of the 1922
executive since 1988 and a junior education minister from 1983-88, was
someone who would have their support.
Last year's challenge to Sir Marcus came after right-wing MPs
complained that the 68-year-old MP for Shipley and 1922 committee
chairman for three years was being used as a public mouthpiece for the
Prime Minister.

THE Earl of Lindsay is a landscape architect by profession and no
doubt hopes to help shape the future political map of Scotland as a
member of the Scottish Office team.
However, he could hardly be described as a prominent feature on that
particular landscape at the moment. Among Opposition party politicians
and the Scottish electorate at large, the general reaction to news of
his appointment was: ''Lord who?''
James Randolph Lindesay-Bethune, known to his chums as Jamie, became
the 16th Earl of Lindsay in 1989.
He spent his school days at Eton and graduated with an MA Hons. degree
from Edinburgh University before continuing his studies at the
University of California.
As well as being a landscape architect and environmental consultant,
the 39-year-old earl is also a farmer and woodland owner. He is married
with five children and lives at Upper Largo in Fife.
Lord Lindsay is described as an ''active'' member of the House of
Lords where, for the past six months, he has been a Government Whip.
He lists his special interests as the environment, transport and
energy. He was appointed a member of the European Communities
sub-committee on Environment and Social Affairs in 1993 and has served
since 1994 on the Select Committee on Sustainable Development.
Lord Lindsay was responsible for handling Scottish clauses of the
Environmental Bill during its passage in the House of Lords as well as
the Children (Scotland) Bill and Mental Health (Patients in the
Community) Bill.
All very worthy, but hardly the stuff to set the heather alight.
Opposition parties have been quick to protest that he is a virtually
''unknown'' figure .
However, Lord Lindsay last night rejected any suggestion that his
privileged background had helped him to ''swan into'' the job. He said:
''I have had a rite of passage in that I have served on select
committees in the House of Lords and used the experience I have gained
in other fields in order to contribute there.''
The official line from the Scottish Office was that the exact
portfolios of the new junior Ministers had yet to be decided. However,
Lord Lindsay is almost certain to take over the agriculture, environment
and rural affairs remit from Sir Hector Monro.
As well as being president of the International Tree Foundation, a
voluntary organisation, the earl is involved in a number of charitable
garden trusts.
Now, he and his ministerial colleagues must be hoping that the
Scottish electorate take a more charitable view of the Conservatives and
that everything in the garden comes up roses. Blue ones, of course . . .

<HEADLINE>Appeal court orders IRA explosives retrial</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977518832</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Court of Appeal yesterday ordered a retrial in the case of a man
jailed for 22 years after being convicted of hiding Semtex belonging to
the IRA.
The July 1993 Old Bailey trial of sales executive Vincent Wood, on a
charge of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life, took place
in a week of ''intensely prejudicial'' publicity, his counsel Ms Helena
Kennedy, QC, had claimed.
An ''incredible flow'' of material in the media attacked jurors and
the courts over an apparent failure to convict alleged terrorists.
She also complained that trial judge Mr Justice Ognall's summing-up
was ''front-loaded with character assassination''. She criticised his
tone and alleged he sighed, shrugged, and raised his eyebrows when
addressing the jury.
Wood, 29, who was of good character, was convicted after storing a tea
chest containing 17.5kg of Semtex at the shop of an unwitting friend.
When the police raided his home in Leytonstone, east London, in
October 1992, they found the charred remains of a map on which Mr John
Major's home at Great Stukeley, near Huntingdon, was marked.
Wood admitted possession but denied intent. He claimed he was tricked
by an Irish brother-in-law into accepting the Semtex and said he
agonised over what to do with it.
Yesterday, Lord Justice Staughton, sitting with Mr Justice Scott Baker
and Mr Justice Butterfield, said neither the prejudicial material in the
press nor the character of the judge's summing-up was of itself enough
to make Wood's conviction unsafe or unsatisfactory.
But their combined effect did lead to that conclusion.
''Whatever the merits or lack of merits of his defence, Vincent Wood
was entitled to a fair trial. All told, we consider he did not have one.
''The Latin maxim that justice must be done even when the heavens fall
must apply even in times of terrorism -- or at least we have not been
driven to abandon it.''
The judges ordered a retrial on the intent charge and imposed a seven
year sentence on the possession charge, which Wood had admitted.
Lord Staughton said that fairness demanded that pressure should not be
put on juries in a particular case by the press or anyone else.
Newspaper editors and their readers rightly required that those guilty
of serious crime should be convicted and punished. But that objective
might be endangered by the very measures taken to achieve it if it
resulted in an unfair trial.
He said the court would not act on criticism of the trial judge unless
it was supported by evidence or agreed by counsel.

<HEADLINE>Women tell of sex attacks in closes</HEADLINE>

TWO young women were victims of sex attacks just half an hour apart,
Glasgow Sheriff Court was told yesterday.
Both attacks happened in the same area, the court was told. Both
victims had just arrived at their flats and both were kicked as they lay
on the ground by a man with a crewcut.
On trial is a 15-year-old boy said to have been a resident of a
Glasgow children's home. The youth, who cannot be named for legal
reasons, denies a number of sex charges alleged to have taken place in
the South Side of Glasgow last year. He is accused of raping one woman
twice after dragging her into a close and threatening to kill her with a
knife.
Other charges allege that he attacked four women in closes and
assaulted them with intent to rape, put other women in a state of fear
and alarm, and committed four indecent offences against a girl in the
home where he was a resident. The boy has lodged a special defence of
alibi to some of the charges.
Yesterday, the jury heard two young women tell prosecutor Mr Michael
O'Grady how they were attacked on July 2 last year. A 27-year-old civil
servant was coming home from an office party about midnight and was in
her close at Inglefield Street, Govanhill, when her attacker struck.
She was grabbed from behind and her head was banged against a wall
before she was kicked and punched.
She feigned unconsciousness when he ordered her to take off her
trousers. She told the court he ran down a half landing but came back up
again and started to kick her. The girl's boyfriend, also a civil
servant, told how he heard her screams and found her hysterical in a
corner.
The other woman, a sales assistant aged 26, said that at about 12.30am
on the same morning she went into her close in Calder Street, Govanhill,
holding the door open for a stranger.
He grabbed her from behind, told her ''You've had it'', and dragged
her into a recess in the close with one hand on her hair and the other
over her mouth. The young woman told the court she was kicked on the
head and face before the man tried to pull her T-shirt off and ripped
it. Her screams alerted neighbours and her attacker ran away.
Both victims said in evidence that they failed to pick out the accused
at an identification parade.
Earlier, a girl resident of a children's home in the South Side of
Glasgow said the accused came into her bedroom on several occasions and
indecently assaulted her. The trial continues.

CHARITIES in Scotland yesterday expressed fears that plans to
introduce bigger grid National Lottery tickets might pressure people
into spending more and cause a further drop in charitable donations.
Lottery organiser Camelot said yesterday it was to issue playslips
containing seven #1 games instead of five next month. The company said
it hoped the larger tickets would cut queues and make life easier for
those who played in syndicates. It denied that the move was merely an
attempt to entice people to spend more.
However, a spokeswoman for the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations, Ms Lucy Pratt, said a report to be published next week
would show a further reduction in the amount of cash being given to
charities. In an earlier report, the SCVO said donations had fallen by
16% in Scotland.
Ms Pratt pointed out that for every pound spent on a ticket less than
one fifth went to those organisations selected by the National Lottery
Charities Board. As a result, some charities were losing out completely
while others were only getting a small share.
''We carried out research before the introduction of the scratch cards
into the effect on direct giving and that showed that there was a 16%
drop in the number of Scottish people giving money to charity. Our new
research will show a further drop.''
The Rev Bill Wallace, convener of the Church of Scotland's board of
social responsibility, said Camelot's claim that the move would not
encourage people to spend more money was hypocritical. He said: ''Why do
it then? They are relying on people who can't afford it. Their sales are
already higher in low income areas. The seven-line grid is going to
tempt people who have a problem but I am sure it is not something
Camelot are concerned about.''
Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, Mr Nigel Griffiths, called on
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to hold an inquiry into who the
lottery charity losers were.
In England, the gambling watchdog, the National Council on Gambling,
claimed the move was part of an endless process of pressurising people
into spending more and more.
However, a Camelot spokeswoman said the change would not encourage
people to spend more. ''We hope that it will cut down queues by allowing
people to play more games without buying more tickets. The average spend
is #2.15 at present and we don't expect that to increase.''
The organisation said playslips containing between eight and 10 games
were common in foreign lotteries. The new tickets will be introduced on
trial at shops in London and East Anglia and, if they prove popular,
across the UK later in the year.
Meanwhile, the Government's spending watchdog said National Lottery
chief, Mr Peter Davis, was right to turn down Mr Richard Branson's plan
for a no-profit game.
Virgin millionaire Mr Branson said more people would play if they knew
all profits were going to good causes.
But his scheme was turned down last year when Mr Davis, head of the
Government's Office of the National Lottery, awarded the licence to
profit-making Camelot.
The National Audit Office yesterday backed Mr Davis's decision, saying
his evaluation of licence bids was ''comprehensive, consistent, and
logical''.
Audit officials gave their backing to Oflot in a report on the way
applications for the lottery licence had been dealt with.
Mr Davis concluded that Mr Branson's market research had not proved
that good causes would benefit more, said the report.
He chose Camelot because he felt that, even though the group would
pocket around 5% of the money raised in profit, it would raise more for
the Government's stated good causes -- arts, heritage, sport, charities,
and the Millennium Fund.

SCOTLAND'S leading stylists told ANVAR KHAN what they thought of
Vivienne Westwood's criticism of the Princess of Wales's fashion sense.
''The Princess is for middle-aged ladies. Elderly people relate to her
more. She's a bit too mumsy looking. She looks as if she's lost interest
in herself. I don't think that Vivienne could make her look more
exciting, just mental. It's time she went for a new style and more
subtle colouring in her hair. She's a tiny wee touch matronly.'' (Taylor
Ferguson, leading hairdresser)
''Vivienne Westwood could dress Diana very well. She does some lovely
non-catwalk stuff. There are times she looks great in evening wear. But
you can't go off to old folk's homes wearing a Vivienne Westwood bustle.
Not everybody can get away with it. It would be nice if she was a bit
wackier but when she does the press hammer her. Look at what happened
when she changed her hair.'' (Annie Good, fashion buyer for Moon)
''I think Diana tends to dress very staidly. I think the sexy thing is
relevant. The halter-necks and the little beaded number she wore
recently to the Serpent Gallery, that was a cleavage job if ever I saw
one. If you've got it, flaunt it. I would love to see what Vivienne
Westwood would do to her. It would be incredible and it certainly
wouldn't be Diana. She's not outrageous but I think she's quite raunchy
underneath. Her look is very contrived, there's no freedom. She should
loosen up a bit.'' (Rita Rusk, international hairdresser)
* ''The Princess of Wales has done much to promote British designers
but people who wear designer clothes are not the same as purveyors of
high fashion or being a person of style. The Princess has done what any
professional woman has to do. She's made a choice, found a look which
gives her confidence, and she sticks to it. Vivienne Westwood is
anti-feminist. As a designer she has more in common with a court
costumier.'' (John Davidson, fashion expert)
''The Princess has to wear clothes which will appeal to Joe Public.
She is not a trendsetter in the purest sense but she is because Joe
Public wants to look like her. I think she should be more natural, stop
wearing those big, sad hats. I would prefer her to wear plainer dresses,
simple shapes which hug the body. I could be bad and suggest trainers
and army trousers but she wouldn't wear them.'' (Cathal McAteer, manager
and buyer for Ichi Ni San).

MEMORIAL services were held yesterday to mark the seventh anniversary
of the Piper Alpha oil platform disaster in which 167 men died.
At Strathclyde Park, around 30 survivors and bereaved attended a short
service and laid wreaths at a monument which bears the names of 21 oil
workers from the region who lost their lives on the platform.
The Rev Hugh Ormiston, director of the Scottish Churches Industrial
Mission, said: ''With the sound of the busy world around us, we pause to
remember those who lost their lives on Piper Alpha.
''They died at their workplace, which is as exhalted a place as in
church or their own homes. We also remember all others who have lost
their lives in the North Sea and at their work in this country.''
In Aberdeen, around 60 people attended a service at the North Sea
Memorial Rose Garden in Hazelhead Park. A service was also held at the
Oil Industry Chapel in St Nicholas Kirk.
On Piper B, the Elf-owned rig on the former Piper Alpha site, workers
held private rememberances.
The father of one victim yesterday renewed his call for a prosecution
to be brought against Piper Alpha's owners, Occidental Petroleum.
Mr Gavin Cleland, 67, whose 33-year-old son, Robert, died in the
disaster, has campaigned since 1991 over the Crown's decision that there
was not sufficient evidence to prosecute the company.
He said: ''The importance of days like this is they keep us from
forgetting what happened. Lord Cullen's public report on the disaster
damned Occidental, yet the Lord Advocate refused to prosecute the
company or their senior management.
''I will not stop the campaign, even if I have to bring a private
prosecution myself.''

COMMENTS by the new Agriculture Minister, Mr Douglas Hogg, left the
future of the Torry food science laboratory still hanging in the balance
last night (writes Stephen McGregor).
Mr Hogg said that, in his view, preserving the science base was
important, but he made no specific mention of Aberdeen institutions or
jobs.
The Minister confirmed his department had received the report from the
task force appointed to look into the matter, and he made clear that its
comments would be carefully examined.
Mr Hogg also undertook to meet local MPs on the matter. Aberdeen North
Labour MP Robert Hughes asked for a meeting and was told by the
Minister: ''It has always been my practice to respond to requests for
meetings and that practice will continue.''

THERE was widespread derision from Opposition parties to the
announcement yesterday of the new team at St Andrew's House, which is to
include the relatively unknown political talent of the Earl of Lindsay
to represent Scotland in the House of Lords.
''Most people will react to Lord Lindsay's appointment by asking 'Lord
Who?' There is not mention of him in Who's Who in Scotland,'' said SNP
parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing.''
She described the team of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, the
other new member of which is Aberdeen South MP Raymond Robertson, as ''a
combination of the unelectable and the unacceptable''.
Of Lord Lindsay's appointment, she said: ''This highlights the absurd
and undemocratic manner in which Scotland is governed within the Union.
A man who has been elected by no-one and is totally unaccountable to the
Scottish electorate, has been apointed to run crucial areas of our
national life by a party which has the support of just 10% of Scots.''
Lord Lindsay, 39, is a landscape architect who has spent most of his
life in London but now lives at Upper Largo in Fife. A Government Whip
in the Lords, he lists the environment as his main area of interest,
giving a likely pointer to his Scottish Office portfolio, which will be
announced today.
Mr Robertson is 35 and a former teacher of history and modern studies.
Whether this will be reflected in his taking over the education brief
will be seen today. The others in the team are Mr George Kynoch and,
newly promoted to Minister of State, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
Mrs Ewing added: ''In many ways Raymond Robertson's elevation is just
as extraordinary as that of Lord Lindsay. The only reason he has been
appointed is because the Tories have nobody else.''
Scottish Conservative chairman Sir Michael Hirst defended the quality
of the new intake. ''Both men are very capable operators with
wide-ranging experience,'' he said.
''Jamie Lindsay has a distinguished record of public service. He has
been a prominent member of numerous committees, showing an especially
strong commitment to the environment, transport, and energy.''
But Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson was scathing, calling
the team the ''bottom of the barrel''. Instead of appointing someone
prominent in Scottish life to the peerage they had gone for an unknown.
''It shows up the total dearth of Tory talent on the back benches when
the choice is down to this sad lot,'' he said. ''It is surely no
coincidence that, just as Michael Forsyth had got his feet under his
desk at the Scottish Office, Lord Fraser should be catching the next
train south.
''The Tories now have nobody left to bring in and the same old failed
policies are still there.''
The opposition also combined to attack Mr Forsyth as he embarked on
his first full day in office.
Mr Robertson said Mr Forsyth would be judged not by his words but his
deeds.
He told a Westminster news conference that Scotland needed action, not
consultation stunts -- a reference to Mr Forsyth's ''let's talk''
statement after his appointment.
Mr Robertson said: ''If Michael Forsyth is serious about listening to
Scotland then he must belatedly accept the verdict of the Strathclyde
water referendum and return Scotland's water to real, local, democratic
control.
''Second, he must now act to save Scotland's sleepers, especially the
Fort William service, and bring back Motorail. He must also do more than
that. He must use his new Cabinet voice to end the Government's railway
madness and stop the ScotRail sell-off.''
Mr Robertson said that Mr Forsyth also had to admit that the
Government's NHS reforms had been a failure.
Finally, Mr Robertson has challenged Mr Forsyth on devolution. He
said: ''I challenge him to respond to the overwhelming demand of the
Scottish people for home rule and to drop his party's knee-jerk
opposition to the Constitutional Convention's model for a strong
Scottish parliament inside the United Kingdom.''
As all SNP MPs wrote to Mr Forsyth questioning whether he still held
''hard-right, pro-Thatcherite views'', SNP leader Alex Salmond said:
''When Michael Forsyth was last at the Scottish Office he was one of the
most unpopular men in Scotland. I am sure his appointment will bring the
constitutional argument back to the boil.
''On nearly every policy issue Forsyth has espoused he has been
directly opposed to the interests of decent, mainstream Scotland.
''His appointment, and the hard-right baggage he carries, is a prime
example of why Scotland should have independence in Europe.''
Mr Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who
described Mr Forsyth's appointment as an act of desperation, said: ''In
the junior ranks, Mr Major has once again been forced to look to the
Lords to find anyone with any potential.
''The Commons team lacks any conviction, and shows up the absence of
quality in the Scottish Tory Party.
''Cricket-obsessed John Major has picked tail-enders to bat for
Scotland, but they will all be out at the next election.''

EXCLUSIVE
THE Linn Motor Company, Scotland's largest Volvo dealers, has lost the
franchise to sell the car in Edinburgh.
Following a nationwide review by Volvo UK, the company has halved its
franchises in the capital from two to one, leaving Murray Volvo, on the
west side of Edinburgh, as sole dealers.
Linn, based at Seafield on the east side of the capital, will continue
trading in Edinburgh until the present five-year franchise expires at
the end of 1996.
Financial Director of the Linn Motor Group, Mr David Geddes, said a
decision had yet to be taken over whether the company would seek an
alternative franchise to continue operating in the east but denied it
would mean job losses.
''We are disappointed to have lost out in Edinburgh. We have been
there since 1986 and believe we have done a good job. We have got a good
site with a very good staff. Nobody should be in fear of losing their
jobs,'' he said.
The Seafield Road premises occupied by Linn are owned by Volvo but Mr
Geddes said the company had a commercial lease agreement and was free to
do what it wished with the building.
A spokesman at Volvo's UK headquarters in Essex said the firm had
undertaken a widespread review, focusing particularly on the
metropolitan areas, such as Edinburgh.
''In Edinburgh, we feel that there is really only room for one Volvo
operator but we still want to find someone to cover and service east
Edinburgh,'' he said.
''We have already said to the other dealer that they will look after
the whole of Edinburgh. That dealer may well decide to seek new premises
on the east side of the city.''
The spokesman also hinted at change for Linn in the west, where they
trade under the Volvo name in Glasgow, Hamilton, and Greenock.
''Linn has got a larger territory in Glasgow where they will continue
to operate in a slightly bigger way,'' he said.
He pointed out that Linn would continue to service Volvo in Edinburgh
until the end of 1996.
''We recognise that many people in east Edinburgh may not wish to
travel to the west of the city to have their Volvos serviced. We are
therefore anxious to ensure there is sevice cover on the east side.
Customers can continue to buy Volvo with confidence,'' he added.
Volvo currently has 22 dealers in Scotland with six in the Greater
Glasgow area alone.

A FARMER'S wife who smashed a glass into the face of a primary school
headteacher was ordered to pay her victim #4000 yesterday.
Mrs Wilma Robertson, 36, of Ribigill Farm, Tongue, Sutherland, pled
guilty at Dornoch Sheriff Court to assaulting Mrs Anne Scott, of
Rosebank, Tongue, in the early hours of January 2, throwing the contents
of a glass on her, and striking her on the face with the glass to her
severe injury and permanent disfigurement.
Sheriff Donald Booker-Milburn ordered Robertson to pay Mrs Scott #2000
for the cost of plastic surgery and #2000 for ''pain and suffering''
caused by the assault.
Ms Elaine Hillis, prosecuting, said Mrs Scott had been at a New Year's
party at the Craggan Hotel, Melness.
She had intended to leave at 2am, and put her hand on the shoulder of
Robertson's husband. At that point, Robertson returned from the bar and
saw Mrs Scott leaning on her husband, Fred.
Robertson told Mrs Scott to take her hands off her husband and threw a
drink over her. She then struck the empty glass in Mrs Scott's face.
Mrs Scott had six stitches to her face and one internal stitch for a
cut artery.
Ms Hillis said Mrs Scott was considering plastic surgery.
Ms Hillis added that in a police statement after the offence Robertson
said she threw a glass of vodka in Mrs Scott's face but did not mean to
smash the glass. ''I could not believe it when I saw the blood,'' she
added.
However, Ms Hillis said the glass attack was intentional as there were
two distinct actions.
Robertson's defence solicitor said the assault was not premeditated
and that Robertson was ''very shaken''.
Sheriff Booker-Milburn said the assault was ''completely out of
character'' and it would be highly unlikely she would commit a similar
offence.
He added that such an assault would normally result in a prison
sentence.

FOURTEEN firefighters were injured yesterday as they battled a massive
fire in a Yorkshire pudding factory. They were taken to hospital
suffering the effects of toxic fumes from the fire at Triton Foods in
Hull.
More than 100 firefighters were fighting the blaze, which engulfed
three buildings belonging to Triton and sister company William Jackson
bakers. Nearby factories and houses had to be evacuated because of the
fumes, believed to be from an ammonia store.
Humberside fire brigade spokesman Mr Peter Smith said the firefighters
were taken to Hull Royal Infirmary.
A south-east wind sent clouds of smoke from the factory over
Stoneferry and towards Bransholme, a police spokesman said.
''The most we are expecting is watering eyes. Without being alarmist,
as a precaution, we are advising people to keep their windows and doors
closed. There is no danger to life from the fumes,'' added the
spokesman.
A hopital spokeswoman said the 14 firefighters were treated for the
effects of fume inhalation. ''We are expecting to detain three or
possibly four as a precautionary measure but it is unlikely that they
will stay overnight. The others are being discharged,'' she added.

A HEALTH board general manager claimed in court yesterday that he was
not driving a car which was involved in a late-night crash.
Mr Derek Banks, 47, told Kirkcudbright Sheriff Court that his wife had
been driving to and from the hotel where they had been having dinner to
celebrate her birthday before the crash.
Mr Banks, and his 42-year-old wife Moira, both of Maxwell House,
Corsock, Castle Douglas, deny pretending to two police officers that Mrs
Banks was driving the car involved in the collision on the Dalbeattie to
Gatehouse of Fleet road on November 27 last year near Cally Road
junction on the outskirts of Gatehouse of Fleet.
The charge also alleges that the truth was that Mr Banks had been
driving and that they intended to pervert the course of justice.
Mr Banks also denies driving a car without due care and attention, and
failing to keep a lookout and comply with a give way sign, resulting in
the collision with a car driven by Mr Vincent Kelly, of High Street,
Gatehouse of Fleet.
Mr Banks said heand his wife had had a bottle of wine between them at
the hotel. When they left, his wife was driving and when they arrived at
the junction she stopped the car and they had a debate about which road
to take home.
Mr Banks said he was looking to the left as the car pulled out and saw
headlights coming towards them. Then the collision occurred.
He also told how his wife had to get out of the passenger door because
the driver's door was jammed. The cars, he said, had stopped about 60 to
100 yards apart and he had got out of the passenger door, and gone to Mr
Kelly's car.
He claimed Mr Kelly said: ''I will get you for this you bastard,'' to
which he replied that his wife was driving. He claimed Mr Kelly's
behaviour was alarming and threatening.
Mr Banks also said it was pitch black and almost impossible to see. He
told the court he could not explain why he had been identified by Mr
Kelly and his wife but added: ''I am saying they are mistaken.''
Constable Alan Burns said that although it was night there was
sufficient light to identify people at the scene.
He said that Mr Banks had been breath-tested at the scene and proved
positive, but had passed the Camic analyser later. He added that under
caution Mrs Banks had said: ''I was driving the car. I suspect the
reason why they suspect Mr Banks was driving is that people tend to
accept the man was driving and he got out of the car first.''
Sheriff James Smith will give his verdict on July 20.

<HEADLINE>Anger as Forsyth introduces #70m-a-year pre-school plan. Nursery vouchers scheme 'a gimmick'</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish Secretary, Mr Michael Forsyth, again promised to be a
listening Minister yesterday when he announced a voucher scheme, valued
at #70m a year, will be introduced to provide pre-school places for all
four-year-olds.
However, based on the initial political and parental reaction to the
scheme, his ears will be ringing.
Vouchers were dismissed as a ''right wing gimmick'' by the Scottish
Liberal Democrats, while Mrs Diana Daly, a leading parent activist,
feared they would lead to the introduction of an education marketplace,
with parents, pupils, and students using them to buy services in all
parts of the sector.
Mr Forsyth said every parent will be given a voucher worth #1100 which
they will be able to spend on nursery education for children in the year
before they go to school, ensuring those who become primary one pupils
at the age of four will also be able to benefit.
The first places will be available in a pilot scheme in August next
year. Details will not be announced until the autumn, after Mr Forsyth
and his officials have had talks with the providers of pre-school
education: local authorities and the private and voluntary sectors.
Mr Forsyth said he would also listen to all the views put to him on
the issue in the coming months.
He said: ''My aim is to put in place arrangements which build on
existing nursery schools, nursery classes, and playgroups but which also
offer parents real choice.
''Too often the existing arrangements have favoured some parents at
the expense of others. Pre-school education should not be a lottery. It
should be open to all, regardless of their circumstances.''
The scheme will cost about #31m a year in new money to provide places
for the 28,000 four-year-olds who do not receive nursery education or
who go to playgroups.
The remaining #39m consists of money which goes to local authorities
for nursery places. In future, they will recoup their share in vouchers
which parents will hand over when they enrol their children for
pre-schooling.
About 35,600 four-year-olds, or 56% of the total, currently receive
nursery education.
Critics of nursery vouchers, however, said they would do nothing to
increase the number of places available because their value did not take
into account the capital cost of providing new facilities.
Children in Scotland, the national agency for organisations and
individuals working with children and their families, said the lack of
places was Scotland's biggest problem.
One of the body's leading figures, Mrs Celia Carson, said: ''We are
extremely disappointed the voucher scheme is going ahead in spite of the
strongly expressed concerns of virtually all childcare providers.
Vouchers are neither a sensible nor a cost-effective way to address
need.''
Labour's spokesperson on Scottish education, Mrs Maria Fyfe, said:
''Nursery vouchers do nothing to meet the shortfall of places. They will
force parents to choose low-quality provision, pay extra, or do
without.''
For the Scottish Liberals, Rae Michie said right wing gimmicks such as
vouchers were not in the best interests of Scottish education. Calling
for extra resources, she said: ''Without new investment, the massive
expansion in nursery education which Scotland needs can never happen.
Waving vouchers about will not build new nurseries, or employ new
nursery teachers.''
Mrs Daly said vouchers would subsidise middle class parents who sent
their children to private nurseries and would do nothing to meet the
needs of those who most required pre-school education.
The Scottish Parent Teacher Council, which recently surveyed parents
on their experience of, and attitudes to, playgroups and publicly-funded
and private nurseries, said funds should be given direct to local
authorities.

CAMPAIGNERS yesterday expressed hope that Mr Michael Forsyth's pledge
to be a listening Scottish Secretary might help them to promote their
case for an expansion of rail services.
Leading members of the Save Our Railways (Scotland) Campaign made it
clear that they intend to take full advantage of the fact that Mr
Forsyth has declared he wants to consult people from all walks of life
on a wide range of issues.
Mr Tom Hart, vice-president of the Scottish Association for Public
Transport, pointed out that the Scottish Office had last month invited
comments on transport improvements in general.
He added: ''I hope the Government senses that the way it has handled
rail privatisation has not helped it.''
Mr Hart is the author of the campaign's submission, published
yesterday, to the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf)
consultation on minimum service levels which train operators should meet
on ScotRail and east coast mainline passenger services.
Joining him to launch the submission was campaign secretary Mr Richard
Leonard, of the Scottish TUC, who said fears that privatisation would
lead to cuts in services had been justified with the publication of the
Opraf consultation documents.
Not only were the Fort William and Scotland to Plymouth sleeper
services excluded but the current half-hourly Edinburgh to Glasgow
service was not guaranteed after 7pm, he said. At the same time, seating
accommodation on overnight Scotland to London services was being
withdrawn and Motorail services were being cut.
The campaigners want the final ScotRail service specification to
include the full level of services as provided in the 1993-94 timetable,
enhanced services across the Forth Bridge, those services which would be
created if ScotRail's published investment programme was implemented,
and a commitment to strengthening the Strathclyde Passenger Transport
Executive and establishing new PTEs for other parts of Scotland.
The Highlands and Islands Enterprise development agency yesterday also
set out the case for retaining and enhancing rail services.
In its submission to Opraf, it calls for subsidy levels to take full
account of the economic and social benefits of the rail network and not
just current income and cost figures.
The agency is awaiting the completion of an independent study it has
commissioned on the economic and social impact of the North of
Scotland's rail network.
Meanwhile, tourism bosses fear that the West Highland economy could
lose hundreds of thousands of pounds because of the series of one-day
strikes being staged by train drivers from next week.
Chairman of the West Highlands and Islands of Argyll Tourist Board, Mr
Allan McKie, said: ''We put up with the strikes last year and it had a
detrimental effect then. Now, once again, people thinking of coming here
on holiday by train will be put off.''

to tackle the city's drugs problem.
Yesterday, Celtic footballer Charlie Nicholas lent his support to the
project, which is part of Strathclyde Police's anti-drugs initiative
Operation Eagle. The six-month project aims to convince children of the
dangers of drugs as well as increase police drugs enforcement efforts.
Nicholas said any attempt to steer children away from drugs and
towards more positive activities had to be welcomed. To encourage
teenagers, booklets listing sports facilities and events in Strathclyde
during the school holidays will be available from police.

ELECTRICITY companies in England and Wales were yesterday told to make
further reductions in bills by the industry watchdog, but the cuts will
not apply to the two Scottish electricity companies whose distribution
and supply businesses have already been reviewed.
The order by the Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer) to reduce
prices by 10% to 13% will mean that average electricity bills South of
the Border will fall by about #30 next year.
However, Offer in Scotland said that the price cuts would have no
greater effect than those made under its Price Review Proposals for
ScottishPower and Hydro Electric last year.
ScottishPower accepted Offer's proposals to cut 10% or 11% off its
bills over three years, and implemented them on April 1, while Hydro
Electric rejected the proposals as too stringent, and the matter was
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Offer is assessing the MMC's report, which was published in June and
broadly endorsed the proposals, and has said it is considering some
''modifications'' to its original proposals.
Mr Graeme Sims, deputy director-general for Scotland with Offer said:
''These cuts in England and Wales taken together will mean a cut in
bills for typical customers which is certainly no greater than the cuts
that customers will see from our proposals for the Scottish companies
last year.
''We are looking to announce the modifications we will make to Hydro
Electric's licence later this month or early next, but Scottish
customers are likely to fair just as well as those in England and
Wales.''
A spokesman for ScottishPower said: ''The regulator has already looked
over our operations and is satisfied with our price level.
''Our prices have gone down by 5% in real terms since privatisation
and will continue to be capped at the level set by the regulator.''
A Hydro Electric spokeswoman said the prices charged by the two
Scottish companies were still among the lowest in Britain, ''so we
believe customers are getting good value for money.''
English and Welsh electricity companies were told by Offer yesterday
to cut prices by 10% to 13% from April 1996 -- and by 3% over the
following three years.
But the Labour Party, the National Consumer Council and the Consumers'
Association said Offer should have been tougher, while rising share
prices indicated the electricity industry did not consider the caps a
major blow.
It is the second time in a year that the Offer chief, Professor
Stephen Littlechild, has told the companies to cut prices in the wake of
complaints over profits and bosses' pay.
In August he said bills should fall by between 11% and 17% from April
this year, but after being criticised for being too soft, he decided to
revise his plans and impose a second round of caps.
Offer's second review applied South of the Border only for various
reasons.
When it made its proposals, the share prices of the Regional
Electricity Companies (RECs) in England and Wales increased
significantly and Northern Electric's response to a takeover bid by
Trafalgar House indicated a degree of financial strength that was not
previously apparent.
In contrast, the Scottish companies' share prices fell after Offer's
proposals, which suggested they were too stringent and might not allow
the companies to earn sufficient revenues.
The latest proposed cuts in England and Wales should have been
published today but the announcement was brought forward after details
leaked on to the financial markets.
Labour said the leaking of the report was a ''complete botch'' and
called for an overhaul of the regulatory system, while SNP leader Mr
Alex Salmond said this was not the first time such a leak had caused the
Government embarrassment, adding that ''clearly they do not have the
capacity to release good news in an orderly fashion.''
It is the second time in four months that Professor Littlechild has
found himself in the middle of a political row.
In March, he caused controversy by announcing he was planning to make
more price cuts only 24-hours after the Government launched the
privatisation of generators PowerGen and National Power.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown yesterday described the leaking of the
report as ''yet another privatisation scandal, showing nothing has
changed.''
He said: ''I want to know who knew, when and why there was a billion
pound movement on the stock exchange in advance of the Littlechild
announcement.
''There is now clearly chaos and confusion in the Government's
attitude to price fixing in the privatised utilities, which is leading
to speculation and profiteering on the stock exchange.''
A Stock Exchange spokesman said it was too early to say whether there
would be an investigation.
Professor Littlechild said he hoped the new price caps would appease
critics who viewed him as being too soft on the industry.
''These proposals represent the maximum further reductions in charges
that can reasonably be secured for customers, consistent with improving
quality and reliability of service,'' he said.

SCOTLAND'S leading stylists told ANVAR KHAN what they thought of
Vivienne Westwood's criticism of the Princess of Wales's fashion sense.
''The Princess is for middle-aged ladies. Elderly people relate to her
more. She's a bit too mumsy looking. She looks as if she's lost interest
in herself. I don't think that Vivienne could make her look more
exciting, just mental. It's time she went for a new style and more
subtle colouring in her hair. She's a tiny wee touch matronly.'' (Taylor
Ferguson, leading hairdresser)
''Vivienne Westwood could dress Diana very well. She does some lovely
non-catwalk stuff. There are times she looks great in evening wear. But
you can't go off to old folk's homes wearing a Vivienne Westwood bustle.
Not everybody can get away with it. It would be nice if she was a bit
wackier but when she does the press hammer her. Look at what happened
when she changed her hair.'' (Annie Good, fashion buyer for Moon)
''I think Diana tends to dress very staidly. I think the sexy thing is
relevant. The halter-necks and the little beaded number she wore
recently to the Serpent Gallery, that was a cleavage job if ever I saw
one. If you've got it, flaunt it. I would love to see what Vivienne
Westwood would do to her. It would be incredible and it certainly
wouldn't be Diana. She's not outrageous but I think she's quite raunchy
underneath. Her look is very contrived, there's no freedom. She should
loosen up a bit.'' (Rita Rusk, international hairdresser)
* ''The Princess of Wales has done much to promote British designers
but people who wear designer clothes are not the same as purveyors of
high fashion or being a person of style. The Princess has done what any
professional woman has to do. She's made a choice, found a look which
gives her confidence, and she sticks to it. Vivienne Westwood is
anti-feminist. As a designer she has more in common with a court
costumier.'' (John Davidson, fashion expert)
''The Princess has to wear clothes which will appeal to Joe Public.
She is not a trendsetter in the purest sense but she is because Joe
Public wants to look like her. I think she should be more natural, stop
wearing those big, sad hats. I would prefer her to wear plainer dresses,
simple shapes which hug the body. I could be bad and suggest trainers
and army trousers but she wouldn't wear them.'' (Cathal McAteer, manager
and buyer for Ichi Ni San).

A SCOTS locum pharmacist, claiming racial discrimination because he
was paid #1 an hour less than his counterparts in England, has had his
claim rejected by an industrial tribunal.
Mr Joseph Greig, 45, of Fauldshead Road, Renfrew, brought the case
against Lloyds Retail Chemist Ltd, of Tamworth, Staffordshire, after
learning of the difference in pay.
Mr Greig has worked as a locum pharmacist since 1988 and was paid #10
an hour by Lloyds.
However, in 1993 he received a payment for work done calculated on a
rate of #11 an hour and assumed this ''was the annual wage rise for
locums''.
But his next payment showed the rate had reverted to #10 an hour and,
when he phoned the company's head office, was told he had received the
rate paid to English pharmacists.
Mr Greig's claim was supported by the Commission for Racial Equality.
The company's superintendent pharmacist, Dr Richard Middleton, told
the tribunal: ''Race or national origin are completely irrelevant'' and
explained that pharmacists in England were paid a higher rate because
there was a shortage of them. Dr Middleton told the tribunal they only
paid the higher rate because they had to.
In rejecting the case, the tribunal stated: ''The applicant accepts
that if he performed work for the respondents in England then,
irrespective of his national origin, he would be paid at the higher
rate.
''As we understand it, it is not disputed that someone of English
origin working in Scotland would be paid at the lower Scottish rate.
''We must conclude that the rate paid to the applicant had nothing to
do with his national origin.''

ALMOST 300 workers at a West Lothian nan bread factory lost their jobs
yesterday when it was put into receivership following a fire which it
was claimed had broken out only hours after the company failed to renew
its insurance cover.
Livingston-based Abel Eastern Foods, which supplied stores and
supermarkets throughout the UK, went up in flames on June 30. A
spokesman for insurance brokers Towry Law said that its policy with
Lombard General expired on June 29, despite the fact that Abel's
directors were advised to renew their cover.
A spokesman said: ''Despite this advice, we understand they did not
intend to renew this with Lombard and had another two companies in
mind.''
The company, on Houston Industrial Estate, was set up eight years ago
by Mr Wazir Gallam and his wife, Shazia. One worker who lost his job
said that an extension to the factory was supposed to have been
completed by October, promising more jobs.
Management officials, along with the liquidator who has been appointed
to wind up the firm, Mr Tom McClelland, of Edinburgh chartered
accountants Scott Oswald, held talks with the workforce who have now
been advised to resister at their local JobCentre this week.
As a result of the factory closure, the JobCentre will open on an
extended basis next Saturday to deal with enquiries from the workers who
have lost their jobs.
In a company statement, Mr and Mrs Gallam said that, despite support
from customers and investors and despite the efforts of its management
team to find alternative production facilities, the immediate task to
continue trading had proved impossible.
Consequently, its bank had decided to appoint receivers but the
company said it intended to enter litigation with its insurers.
Mrs Gallam stated that, in the short term, all business for Abel
Eastern Foods had ceased with the workforce laid off although options
would be researched for ''a new investment''.
Mr McClelland added last night: ''There is clearly a major dispute
between the company and its insurers. Our immediate problem is that
records have been destroyed and we are not in a position at this stage
even to write to creditors.
''The immediate task has been to advise the employees who have lost
their jobs and inform job centres and the DSS of their predicament. I do
hope, however, that they will be paid in full in due course.''
Townsfolk were understandably concerned about the news yesterday.
Mr Paul Harrison, 39, of Cairnhill, Livingston, who worked at Abel for
15 months as a packer, recently arranged a #25,000 mortgage for a new
home. He said he would now struggle, having earned #180 a week with
overtime at the factory, because he was facing the dole queue.
He said: ''We understood the factory had a turnover of #25m a year
and, only three months after I started, the management said they were
looking at a projection of around #100m by the next five years.
''Last spring, we also understood that the company planned to extend
its premises behind the present plant, opening in June -- but we
discovered recently the plans had been shelved.''

THE Labour leaders of the new City of Edinburgh Council were accused
by the opposition Liberal Democrats of a catalogue of serious errors
yesterday over the procedures for appointing senior staff to the unitary
authority.
In the new council's most highly charged debate so far, the Labour
group also faced a mini-revolt by three of its own members over another
senior appointment.
Senior Labour members strongly rebutted opposition charges of bad
practice and accused the Liberals of ''stirring a rather nasty pot'' for
political ends.
In particular, the Liberals Democrats attacked the way the new
director of education, Mrs Elizabeth Reid, who holds the same post on
Lothian region, was recommended for the city job without interviews.
They also claimed that on occasions Labour members of the selection
committee had made their minds up before people were interviewed and
accused them of splitting on region versus district lines over
appointments.
Later, three Labour members, all district councillors, refused to back
the appointment of regional council trading standards director Mr Mike
Drewry as director of environmental and consumer services.
Liberal Democrat leader Councillor Donald Gorrie told the council
meeting in Edinburgh that it was ''contrary to normal local government
practice'' for a meeting called to draw up a short leet of candidates
instead to recommend one person, Mrs Reid, for the job without any
interview.
Councillor Geddes said that everyone on the selection committee had
agreed that Mrs Reid was significantly ahead of the other applicants for
education director in terms of ability and experience.
The appointments were all approved.

A SENIOR social worker, who allegedly waged a one-woman campaign
against the owners of a Renfrewshire residential home for the elderly,
and whose reports were responsible for its closure last December amid
neglect accusations, struck terror into the hearts of staff and
residents, it was claimed yesterday.
An appeal tribunal at Paisley Sheriff Court raised by the owner of the
home, Dr Sohail Chaudhry, seeking to clear his name and have the
registration cancellation revoked, heard how the social worker at the
centre of the closure was ''Gestapo-like'' in her behaviour.
Giving evidence on the fourth day of the hearing, Mrs Jean Campbell, a
senior care officer at the home from the day it opened, and who had
previously been employed by Argyll and Clyde Health Board, described how
Mrs Davina Young tormented staff and residents so much that they felt
they were going to be put through their driving test every time she
appeared.
Mrs Campbell said: ''She put the fear of death in me. She was not
approachable at all.
''If you dared answer her back, the details were put in one of her
reports.''
She claimed that on one occasion two elderly residents had been
arguing and that staff had calmed both down.
''Mrs Young arrived on the scene and as soon as she stepped in it all
erupted again,'' she said.
''She caused more trouble then said in her report that we were not
able to deal with the situation.''
Mrs Campbell claimed that the day the home was finally closed down
last December, one of the residents told Mrs Young to her face that she
was racist.
''She didn't even deny it. She just sat and smiled,'' she added.
Mrs Campbell claimed the residents had been treated so well that in
her opinion they were ''simply ruined''.
''I went round them one by one to see what they wanted to eat before
going for the messages. They each got to choose their own food. It was
just like one big happy family,'' she added.
Mrs Campbell said the neglect accusations levelled against Dr Chaudhry
were ''a load of rubbish''.
Another witness, nurse Mr Raman Ramjen, who formerly ran his own home
for the elderly in Ayrshire and had an ''excellent relationship'' with
social workers there, described how he had been brought in as a senior
care assistant just weeks before the closure of Caldwell House, near
Lugton.
He said he had extensive experience with Strathclyde Social Work
Department and was ''shocked and surprised'' when he first encountered
Mrs Young.
''She made the residents very uneasy and frightened the staff,'' he
said.
He was so deeply concerned about her conduct that he wrote a strongly
worded letter of complaint to social work chiefs, condemning her
actions.
Mr Ramjen, who now works full-time with the Marie Curie Cancer Care in
Edinburgh, said that, in his professional opinion, residents of Caldwell
House were very well cared for and were very happy. He never saw anyone
at risk.
He described Dr Chaudhry and his wife, and all of the staff, as very
good and very caring people.
He added: ''I didn't understand Mrs Young at all. Nothing she said or
did made any sense. There was no logic to her behaviour.''
The tribunal continues.

EXCLUSIVE
SCOTTISH Enterprise is to seek interested parties to take over its
local enterprise companies.
Alarm bells rang for officials in a number of Lecs yesterday at the
plan to invite applications to replace current boards within the
13-strong network. Senior staff also fear that if present board members
are removed, so might they be.
They suspect that SE's trawl is based on growing disillusionment
within the hierarchy because successes in creating jobs are being buried
under the long-running welter of allegations that the Lecs are
self-perpetuating secret societies.
By inviting outsiders to take over, the Government-backed agency would
hope to end such criticisms and have its contributions to the economy
recognised.
Sources at Lanarkshire Development Agency yesterday said that SE,
which has a #467m budget, would seek applications soon for the takeover
of Lecs.
One said: ''The idea seems aimed at asking the business community to
put up or shut up about issues that have regularly caused the agency
problems.
''Instead of complaining, sniping, or ridiculing Lecs, they will be
asked, if prepared, to take on their tasks. It will be very interesting
to see if anyone out there is indeed prepared to meet that challenge.''
There is nothing to prevent SE replacing Lec boards -- provided the
new members convince the agency they can deliver more for the same or
less amount of money.
The Commons Scottish Affairs Committee earlier this year acknowledged
''great concern'' over SE's accountability. Although stressing that
overall the system worked well, MPs recommended an overhaul of
membership because Lec boards were ''self-selecting'' and local
authorities in particular were under-represented. They also proposed
replacing Lec directors with ''young, active people'' to ensure the
companies did not stagnate.
Mr Forbes Macpherson, outgoing chairman of Glasgow Development Agency,
yesterday referred to public concerns about Lecs being
''self-perpetuating bodies'' in his opening remarks at the GDA's annual
meeting.
But he denied the charge, arguing that consultations took place before
board appointments. He added that more than half the GDA membership had
changed in four years, ensuring a continuous flow of new blood.
Mr Macpherson said later that Chambers of Commerce, the CBI,
universities, and local authorities were consulted on appointments
''made on a consensus basis after names came up''.
The LDA, in charge of rejuvenating an area blighted by the Ravenscraig
closure, is among those said to want an end to the repeated carping over
the network's operations by challenging others to do any better.
It is argued that the trawl for interested parties does not imply
criticism of members' performance, but is a tactic to force outsiders to
bid to replace them or end their whispering campaigns.
Sources also suspect that the invitation underlines headquarters'
determination to obtain the best value for money and the fullest
possible portfolio of projects aimed at creating a broader and deeper
business base for Scotland.
It is also argued that any takeover would not be privatisation by the
back door because new boards would still require to be approved, funded,
and assessed on performance by SE.
Scottish Enterprise has created 5000 new business ventures, and
secured #150m worth of exports and #44m worth of European funding for
projects this year. Its inward investment arm, Locate in Scotland,
created or safeguarded 12,000 jobs.

A 32-YEAR-OLD motor cyclist was killed and a second man seriously
injured in a crash on the Edinburgh city by-pass early yesterday.
Mr Iain Martin, of Fauldburn, East Craigs, died after he was thrown
from his machine after a collision with a lorry, and then hit by a car
on the other side of the road.
His friend, Mr Keith White, 38, of Polwarth Gardens, Edinburgh, who
was travelling on a second motor cycle, was taken to hospital suffering
from a thigh fracture and facial cuts.
A third biker and the 27-year-old driver of the lorry escaped unhurt.
* One person died and at least two others were injured in a serious
road accident on a notorious stretch of the A77 last night.
Two vehicles were involved in the crash on the southbound carriageway
of the Glasgow to Ayr road, close to the Eaglesham road end, south of

THE Prime Minister last night presented what he called a more united,
determined, and effective party to a victory rally in Westminster. But
the exact position of Mr Michael Heseltine -- the man whose job it is to
make it more effective -- was still unclear.
It was the first meeting of Mr Major's new Cabinet with his Deputy
Prime Minister sitting at his left-hand side. They rattled through the
day's business then held a political discussion at which the Prime
Minister sought to assert his new authority. He declared that the air
had been cleared and that he now intended to use his leadership vote to
fulfil his General Election mandate.
Mr Heseltine has already established himself, along with staff brought
over from the Department of Trade and Industry, in the big conference
room in the Cabinet Office. If necessary he will use Sir Robin Butler,
the Cabinet Secretary and head of the Civil Service, to enforce his
influence over his colleagues and their Whitehall departments.
But No 10 could not say whether Mr Heseltine would stand in for the
Prime Minister at Commons Question Time in his absence. Whether, indeed,
Mr Heseltine will have a Question Time to himself -- there is an empty
space for this created by the merger of the Department of Employment and
Education.
Mr Major's new No 2 also has available another spot, questions to the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a Cabinet position held by his No
2, Mr Roger Freeman.
Mr Heseltine has no departmental budget for which he would be
accountable to the Commons -- much like Rab Butler who was given the
same titles: First Secretary of State and Deputy Prime Minister.
Butler's influence waned despite these grand titles, and Mr Heseltine is
determined that he will not suffer the same fate.
But it is clear that precise details of how he will deploy his new
power have not been settled, despite the fact that No 10 claims that the
Prime Minister and Mr Heseltine had discussed the role weeks before Mr
Major sprang his decision to hold a leadership election.
Further details of these discussions were emerging last night. Last
Tuesday morning Mr Major asked him to become party chairman and Deputy
Prime Minister along with control of 10 Cabinet committees. Mr Heseltine
then presented a different plan to Mr Major -- one that he had intended
to put into action himself had he won the leadership election in 1990.
This involved a quite different position for himself, much more
effective as he saw it than being mere party chairman. He wanted to
become a proper chief of staff and No 2 to the Prime Minister in order
to present policies and sell them to the nation.
This appeared to take the Prime Minister aback, and he suggested that
they take more time to think about it. It was implicit that if Mr
Heseltine was not to get the role he wanted he would have to consider if
there was a useful future for him, since he was going to be deprived of
his beloved Department of Trade.
That evening instead of going to the birthday celebrations of
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke at No 11, the two men met again to continue
their discussion. They agreed to sleep on it, and it was not until the
following morning that the Prime Minister agreed to the Heseltine
propostion. It was then that the Rab Butler precedent in 1962 was used
to give Mr Heseltine the titles of First Secretary and Deputy Prime
Minister.
Mr Heseltine loyally supported the Prime Minister in the leadership
election and did not permit his followers on the Tory benches to mount
any kind of operation that might have forced a second ballot. He is said
to be delighted with the result and his new position, which gives him
the authority to direct in the name of the Prime Minister his Cabinet
colleagues on policy and its presentation.
Last night at the celebration rally Mr Major restated his essential
domestic targets such as the nursery voucher scheme.
He intends to tough it out in the European Union ''when it is in the
British national interest to do so, by saying one short word to Brussels
-- No''.

A LARGE-scale investigation by CID officers from Central Scotland
Police has been focused on two leading Labour councillors in Falkirk and
on a number of local businessmen. In the wake of the Monklands scandal
it represents a further serious embarrassment to the Labour Party in
Scotland.
The inquiry, which could take several months, centres on allegations
of corruption in relation to planning applications, particularly about a
landfill site between Polmont and Grangemouth.
Local politicians from Falkirk District Council and at least four
local businessmen have faced extensive questioning from detectives in
the last week. One leading Labour politician has been questioned for at
least five hours.
Detectives headed by Detective Superintendent Joe Holden yesterday
moved out of police headquarters at Stirling into an incident room at
Falkirk to begin sifting through hundreds of documents relating to the
financial affairs of councillors. The papers were seized in a number of
raids at houses in the Falkirk area yesterday morning.
Leading figures in Falkirk District Council yesterday refused to
comment as police officers continued to question people in the area.
The inquiry is unconnected to another investigation into another
Falkirk councillor about an alleged #400,000 mortgage and benefit fraud.

HEALTH Secretary Stephen Dorrell faces an immediate demand from family
doctors for a revised offer to settle their out-of-hours work dispute.
Industrial action was brought a step nearer yesterday when the British
Medical Association's annual conference backed sanctions in the event of
negotiations being unsuccessful.
The next deadline is expected to be a meeting of the general
practitioners' committee on July 20.
It has already decided to hold a ballot and yesterday the conference
instructed officials, in the event of negotiations breaking down or
dragging on, to proceed.
The GPs have already rejected an offer which would have replaced their
current #47 a home visit at night with an annual payment of #2000 and
#20 a visit.
Sanctions would involve what one doctor described as ''pouring
marmalade into the system'' -- frustrating the bureaucratic process
without harming patients.
Representatives claimed that patient care could, if anything, improve
if GPs set aside the red tape that had become a part of their lives.
The GPs acknowledged that that such action might throw more work on to
the shoulders of consultants but a rousing speech in support from the
consultants' chairman, Mr James Johnson, followed by a standing ovation
for the GPs' chairman, Dr Ian Bogle, was a flourish of old-fashioned
trade union solidarity clearly intended to nail any suggestion of
disunity in the profession.
The Government will have to meet these demands to head off a dispute:
* The out-of-hours component of GP remuneration must be identified
separately.
* Payments made to GPs for their out-of-hours commitment must be
greatly improved without disadvantage to those who do their own night
work.
* Sufficient support funding must be provided to develop alternative
methods of out-of-hours working (for example, primary care emergency
centres, administrative support for GP co-operatives).
* A relief option for those GPs who wish to be relieved of their
out-of-hours responsibility.
* All doctors who act as deputies to be reponsible for their own acts
and omissions.
* A substantial patient education campaign on the appropriate use of
out-of-hours emergency services.
The last item would be the only one which would cost the Government
any more money, the BMA maintains.
Balfron GP Dr Brian Keighley said: ''Why is it that in a few years
general practice has decided night work is so onerous that drastic
change is necessary?
''It is because of patient demand generated by general social
breakdown, demand fuelled by Government publicity, and demand that
expects a doctor to be as available as a 24-hour filling station.''
The conference also voted that euthanasia should remain unlawful.
Consultant Mr Robin Davies, of Gwynedd, admitted that he had given
powerful sedatives to dying patients and switched off ventilators but
said he believed the risk of being prosecuted or sued should remain.
''I think it would be very dangerous for our country to depart from
this position,'' he added.
Doctors were warned not to join a Government-sponsored computer system
that could make patients' data available to Department of Health
employees.
Dr Stuart Horner, ethical committee chairman, said: ''Without a secure
system, the fact that you had syphilis or HIV or had had an abortion
could become available to the media. Even people who weren't celebrities
could have their details passed on to insurance companies or employers
to determine who was a poor risk.''

THE Government has been asked to explain why there was no follow-up
investigation on pregnant women who were repeatedly injected with
radioactive iodine more than 30 years ago.
Leader of the House, Mr Tony Newton, was asked for a statement last
night by SNP MP Margaret Ewing.
Her party leader, Mr Alex Salmond, said he was ''very disturbed'' by
the ethical questions raised by a television documentary last night
which featured one of his constituents.
''This is a matter of huge public concern,'' he said.
The constituent, Mrs Kathleen Morrison, 62, her sister, and three
friends were among 91 pregnant women who had radioactive iodine injected
into their thyroids.
Mrs Morrison has called for follow-up research following fears that
the children of those who volunteered for the experiment in Aberdeen
between 1962 and 1964 may be affected.
She suffered throat cancer seven years ago and, although she is not
claiming it was as a result of the research, she is concerned about the
effects of the work carried out at the Obstetric Medicine Research Unit,
then headed by obstetrician Sir Dugald Baird.
The experiment is understood to have been carried out as part of his
PhD thesis by Dr Aboul Khair, a Research Fellow in Therapeutics and
Pharmacology.
A subsequent experiment carried out in the same unit involving a
further 37 women, who were about to have abortions, revealed that unborn
children were more susceptible to radioactive iodine than had previously
been realised. However, it was known at that stage the foetus is at risk
from even low level radiation.
On the Channel 4 documentary, True Stories: Deadly Experiments,
produced by Twenty Twenty Television, Mrs Morrison, a retired teacher of
Cruden Bay, said: ''I'm absolutely horrified that in 1962 they were
prepared to inject myself, a pregnant woman, with radioactive iodine
when they had known earlier there was a problem. I feel our trust was
betrayed.''
She said they had been told there was no risk involved.
''I was 29. We were intelligent, well educated women, who wanted the
best for our children and we agreed to the tests because we never even
thought that a doctor would put us at risk.
''They did tell us they were using radioactivity in the tests but
nobody knew what that was then. I'm a 'wifie' now and it is not me I am
worried about, it is my daughter.''
Mrs Morrison said it was only when she started hearing about the
effects on soldiers of nuclear fallout on Christmas Island she became
concerned.
She said: ''I would like to know they are interested enough to see
what happened to the 91 children in northeast Scotland whose mothers
underwent these tests.''
The Medical Research Council, which funded the experiments, yesterday
denied they had been carried out secretly or that there had been any
risk.
Its spokesman, Mr Paul Fawcett, said he could not comment on the
experiment in which Mrs Morrison was involved because he had only scant
details, but confirmed another experiment involving 37 women was carried
out.
''The thyroid can cause all sorts of problems, particularly in
pregnancy, so doctors have had an interest in studying that for many
years and one of the ways they can do that is by administering
radioactive iodine,'' he said.
''It was, and still is, very common to give radioactive iodine to
investigate problems with the thyroid. That may sound terribly alarming
but a study took place in Sweden in 1990 involving more than 10,000
women over a period of nine years. ''All these women had diagnostic
amounts, amounts sufficient to see what was going on, or therapeutic
amounts which would be far greater and would be to actually treat
problems like cancer. They were followed up to see if any had got cancer
of the thyroid as a result and they found that the incidence of cancer
in those 10,000 women was exactly the same as the average.''
He said a report published in 1966 in the scientific journal Clinical
Science indicated the study was carried out in 37 patients with normal
pregnancies on whom termination was performed on medical or psychiatric
grounds.
The Channel 4 documentary made numerous revelations about experiments
which were carried out until the 1970s and one between 1955 and 1970 in
which hospital pathologists removed body parts from 6000 corpses,
without the knowledge of their families, and sent them to Harwell to be
analysed for fallout levels. The MRC confirmed to The Herald last night
that Aberdeen would have been one of the centres, but the research had
been carried out ''discreetly rather than secretly''. Channel 4 tracked
down Mrs Grace Brown for their programme. She discovered that when her
12-month-old son, Ray Jones, died in 1957 bones were removed from his
body without her consent.
''It was something that in your wildest dreams you never imagined
might happen to your baby,'' she said. ''I feel as if my son's body was
violated.
''If they had asked me for his heart to save another baby, it would
have been hard, but I would have done it. But taking bits of him without
asking . . .''
Mr Fawcett confirmed that bones had been removed from bodies for
analysis without families being aware, but said: ''They were taking bone
samples not secretly but discreetly.
''There was no law to say samples couldn't be taken at post mortem,
not only to determine the cause of death, but also for other health
problems. It was something that took place, but if your nearest and
dearest has died the last thing you want is a grisly account of what is
going to be done. It would be grossly insensitive.'' The experiments
were to determine how strontium was affecting people and the 6000
samples were random and from people of all ages.
Mr Fawcett said: ''What these experiments did show was that it was a
problem. People were getting strontium in their bones and children were
particularly at risk, and you can argue that exactly this kind of work
led to the banning of the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere.
''There is an implication that these experiments are about
radioactivity. They are not, they are about health problems, serious
health problems. Radioactivity was used simply to help scientists see
what these problems were and how they could be treated. It is a complete
red herring to say they were looking at the effects of radioactivity.''
In last night's programme, one experiment highlighted was on Asian
women in Coventry and it was claimed they were unaware of the details.
Mr Fawcett said the experiments in Coventry were to find out why Asian
women were deficient in iron. He added: ''One of the scientists is still
around and we have had a rock solid assurance they visited each family
and discussed the experiment and explained it to them. If the families
didn't speak English, they made sure a bilingual family member was
there. That was done in good faith.''
Mr Alan Reid, of the Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust, said last night:
''If Mrs Morrison or anyone else involved has any concerns they should
contact us in writing and we will address these concerns.''

THE headmaster of a top Scottish independent school which has been at
the centre of serious bullying allegations yesterday spoke out about
''an orchestrated vendetta'' by a group of parents and told The Herald:
''We have nothing to hide.''
Mr Malcolm Thyne, 52, in charge of almost 500 boarding and day pupils
at Fettes College in Edinburgh, said it was grossly unfair he was being
pilloried, and added: ''It's a complete slur on the integrity of the
Fettes community.
''We shall welcome an inspection from the Scottish Office Education
Department as soon as they are able to include us in its normal visits
to independent schools,'' he said.
He accused a small group of parents -- their children are no longer at
the college -- of ''stopping at nothing'' to further their campaign.
Mr Thyne said it had been a hard time for himself and his wife,
Eleanor.
''I wouldn't deny that having a prolonged vendetta is anything other
than upsetting. I am very encouraged by the excellent support from the
board of governors, staff, parents, Old Fettesians and, indeed, the
pupils.
''I have a belief that fair-minded people will see this vendetta for
what it is and that people who value Christian principles and good
family values will be interested in a school which is keen to uphold
these.''
Fair-minded people would reach their own conclusions about whether
these allegations had been inspired by a genuine concern to see
improvements in the care of pupils in the school or whether in large
measure they had been promoted out of a spirit of vindictiveness as part
of an unpleasant vendetta.
The headmaster of a school where the annual fees for senior boarders
this autumn will be #12,000 admitted there was a danger that, if parents
believed ''these wild accusations'', they might feel their children
could be bullied or receive unkind treatment.
''I believe if they talk to existing parents and pupils they would
find out that Fettes is a very happy, caring and successful school,''
said Mr Thyne, who described himself as a tough, but fair,
disciplinarian.
He had made it clear when he took up the post in 1988 that possession
or use of drugs was ''an expellable offence''.
The headmaster said the background to the campaign against the college
stemmed from an incident in 1992 when he received information there had
been some cannabis brought into the college.
He said a thorough investigation was carried out and what he believed
were entirely reasonable interviews of six boys involved -- in the
presence of the deputy headmaster and/or housemasters -- conducted.
The six had confessed to involvement in the minor use of drugs. ''I
therefore required all six of them to leave the school. Five of the
pupils concerned accepted their punishments as reasonable but, since
then, one family has been very disaffected.''
He said that for the past two and a half years a small group of
parents had spread disinformation with the intention of causing
embarrassment to the school. Their criticisms proved to be
''exaggerated, trivial or bogus''.
A whole series of confidential complaints by about half a dozen
families had been made to outside organisations including the Scottish
Office and the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
The ''inaccuracies'' and ''defamatory'' statements had led to school
solicitors recently issuing letters to a small number of individuals,
said Mr Thyne.
He said Fettes, against a trend for boarding schools, had seen a very
significant growth in pupil numbers in recent years.
''It would seem to me that the parents in general must be very pleased
with the quality of education Fettes is offering.
''Some newspaper articles have on the one hand suggested that I have
not picked up disciplinary issues, like bullying. On the other hand they
are accusing me of being over zealous in investigating the issues.''
Mr Thyne, who has received scores of letters of support including ones
from senior church figures, policitians and the military field, said it
could be no coincidence two very prominent articles were published by a
Scottish morning paper on the day Fettes celebrated the 125th
anniversary of its foundation.
''I can't believe that was an accident. I think that was a deliberate
act to cause maximum embarrassment to Fettes when I was welcoming 1500
guests.''
The headmaster said he had deliberately not struck back at the people
conducting the vendetta because he was keen their children did not
suffer embarrassment at their other schools.
Mr Thyne said that the use of drugs, sexual misconduct and bullying
would not be tolerated at Fettes.
''I am not saying for a moment we have no disciplinary problems.
Fettes has normal healthy children who, from time to time, will test the
rules.
''But I believe the rules are clear. Our discipline is firm and caring
but we are resolute about maintaining high standards of manners and
behaviour.''
The headmaster said from time to time they came across incidents of
bullying and, in one particular incident not long ago, the
''ringleader'' was suspended and given a final warning.
He said there had been reports of other incidents, including a boy
being put in an oven and a boy being hung out of a window by his ankles.
''I am not saying these incidents didn't happen but they certainly
have not been reported to me. If they had been I would have taken them
very seriously, investigated them and done my best to ensure such
behaviour was not repeated.''
*The Scottish Council For Independent Schools, which represents 30,000
pupils at 80 schools, said it had received no complaints from parents
with children at Fettes.
SCIS director Judith Sischy said the school had a good reputation for
caring for its children.
She said she could not comment directly on the Fettes allegations, but
added: ''There are many sides to the one story. You must hear all sides
before you form a judgment.
''It is a complex issue involving pupils, parents and staff.''
She said her organisation would back any Government moves for more
regular checks on independent schools as uppermost in their minds was
the welfare of the children.
However, she added she felt there had been a tightening up of the
system to check pupils' welfare, particularly the boarders.
Mrs Sischy said: ''The Government through the new Children (Scotland)
Bill has set up extra inspections for boarding schools.
''In some cases, inspectors will come in for a short time and focus on
welfare issues like bullying, health issues and contact with parents.
''At present, inspectors come into the schools at least once every
five years and we welcome their support.''

TENSIONS were at fever pitch in Northern Ireland yesterday as Orange
and Republican mobs clashed during rival demonstrations, and Sinn Fein
continued its violent campaign over the Government's decision to free
Private Lee Clegg.
Eleven police officers and two civilians were injured by stones and
bottles when Orange supporters tried to break through police lines in
south Belfast on Wednesday night.
Ten Land Rovers were damaged, four men were arrested and later the
houses of ''mixed'' couples in the area were attacked.
There were ugly scenes in the Republican town of Bellaghy, County
Londonderry, when police banned a residents' protest against an annual
Orange parade.
In Londonderry, seven vehicles were burned out in Republican riots,
and in Strabane a man and his wife narrowly escaped injury when a petrol
bomb was hurled into their van, one of three vehicles destroyed.
In Newry, two men had to be rescued when a petrol bomb was thrown into
a listed building.
Police yesterday released figures to show that on Monday and Tuesday a
total of 705 petrol bombs were thrown and 172 vehicles hijacked. They
confirmed that senior IRA figures had been seen orchestrating the street
battles which have caused damage estimated at #6m.
As the province prepares for a potentially explosive July 12, there
were signs that the Government is anxious to restart the peace process,
which has been faltering in recent weeks.
Prime Minister John Major told the Commons he was looking at ways of
breaking the log-jam while the Northern Ireland Minister in charge of
the talks process, Mr Michael Ancram, said prisons' policy was ''not set
in concrete''.
After a routine exploratory meeting in Belfast yesterday, the
Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), and the United Democratic Party (UDP),
representing the UVF and the UDA, agreed to set up a sub-committee with
civil servants to examine the prisons' issue in depth over the summer.
Mr Billy Hutchinson of the PUP said it was looking for nothing less
than an amnesty for all politically-motivated prisoners, since even with
a maximum 50% remission, many Loyalists would be in prison until 2007.
Mr Ancram was warned that Loyalist paramilitaries could become so
disillusioned with the talking that they would see no worth in the
dialogue.
The Minister, who met representatives of both parties at Stormont, was
told bluntly that Loyalist paramilitaries would start to believe
dialogue with the Government was useless if they did not win the release
of a single prisoner.
They were told by Mr Ancram: ''The fate of the prisoners depends on us
establishing the peace.''
But Mr Ancram said Government policy on prisoners was ''not set in
concrete''. The establishment of a lasting peace would ''provide
opportunities to make progress''.
He added: ''I have made it clear that the only way in which we can
look at prison issues again in terms of policy is if we begin to make
further progress on the peace front.''
He said yet again the Government wished to see movement on the
decommissioning of illegally-held weapons because that was an indication
of commitment to a genuine peace.
Mr Gary McMichael of the UDP said there was ''not the slightest
chance'' of weapons being decommissioned at present.
Mr Ancram pointed out that the prison issue had not been linked to the
question of decommissioning weapons during the talks.
The outburst of violence in Northern Ireland should not be ''a major
problem'', President Clinton's special economic adviser on Northern
Ireland said yesterday.
Speaking in Dublin, US Senator George Mitchell said he believed the
disturbances this week ''would eventually be seen as a minor bump in the
road towards peace''.

TITLE-holder Conchita Martinez hobbled out of the singles competition
at Wimbledon yesterday, beaten by Spanish compatriot Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario in three sets.
Martinez suffered from blistered feet and play was halted on two
occasions while her trainer attended to them.
After about two hours on court, it became evident again that the
champion was still suffering from the foot injury and she threw off her
shoe at the end of the third game in the deciding set to have a toe
bandage replaced.
She just made it back on court in the stipulated three minutes.
Sanchez Vicario will play Steffi Graf in the final. Graf yesterday
defeated Jana Novotna in three sets.
Meanwhile, officials were investigating claims that players' tickets
were sold by a tout.
Three Centre Court tickets were bought by Spanish tourists for #750
from a man calling himself John at a cafe in Southfields, near the All
England Club.
He said they were American players' tickets and advised the tourists
on how to answer questions if challenged.
The Spaniards handed over $1200 after they were told to go to Gate 2,
pay a normal #7 entry fee to the grounds, then go to Centre Court seats
with the tickets.
A spokeswoman for the All England Club said that at this stage,
without the relevant reference numbers, it was impossible to check if
the tickets had come from players.
It was not immediately clear if the tourists were successful in
getting into Wimbledon.
Last year, a German businessman paid a tout more than #50,000 for 35
Centre Court tickets to entertain some of his most valued customers --
but all were invalid and the group were not admitted.
The club's inquiry comes as touts are increasingly targeting foreign
visitors to the championships after the success of its drive to educate
the public at home about buying invalid tickets.

<HEADLINE>Scheme to cut debate on Bill. Blair on fast track to Scots parliament</HEADLINE>

EXCLUSIVE
LABOUR strategists are planning to cut drastically the amount of time
that could be spent debating their Scottish Parliament Bill in the
Commons chamber.
A Labour government would propose that the bulk of the detailed work
on the highly controversial devolution legislation should be dealt with
by a large Commons committee.
Mr Tony Blair and his lieutenants are determined that their new home
rule measure should not get bogged down in protracted debates.
They recall how one such Bill actually ran out of time in 1977,
needing another to be introduced the following session.
The move will also remove unhappiness among many non-Scottish Labour
MPs who are concerned that their party's first year in power after
probably 17 years in opposition should be taken up with a Bill of little
concern to their constituents.
They have already complained that a repetition of the 1978 Scotland
Bill which took from November 14, 1977 to July 31, 1978 to fight its way
through Parliament, would leave the rest of Labour's programme crippled.
Conservatives are certain to react furiously to the plan, which would
prevent most MPs from taking part in most of the discussions. In 1977
and 1978 these frequently went on into the early hours of the morning.
Labour would follow the modern precedent of dealing with the Budget.
Key resolutions are discussed in the chamber, where all MPs can seek to
speak, and the others via a committee.
It would require just one vital vote for a Labour government to get
its way. Should it win the next election Labour is unlikely to contain
many devolution rebels -- certainly far fewer than those that plagued Mr
James Callaghan's government. It should obtain the mandate it requires.
The Tories would claim that such a restriction in a Bill with major
constitutional implications for the whole United Kingdom was
unprecedented.
Labour is ready to reply that Mrs Thatcher's government guillotined --
restricted debate on -- the Act ratifying the Single European Act which
substantially increased the UK's integration with the rest of the
European Union.
The tactic would leave a Blair government free to introduce several
other measures its supporters regard as urgent.
Party planners are also preparing proposals for bringing quangos and
some government bodies in the English regions under democratic scrutiny
without the need for a major Bill.
Current legislation already gives departmental Ministers powers to
supervise quangos and other regional bodies.
Ministers could delegate these powers to elected councillors from each
region as a first step in regional democracy.
That would give them time to test public reaction to legislating for
regional executives and assemblies which could take over the running of
these organisations.
Some individual quangos could also be democratised by replacing all or
some of the existing membership with councillors drawn from local
authorities in the area covered.
Labour is expected to announce such plans soon as a counter-blast to
recent Conservative claims that it is ''going soft'' on devolution in
England.
Although some members of Labour's National Executive are reported to
have expressed concern about the proposed tax raising powers for the
Scottish Parliament the leadership is unlikely to draw back on them. The
reaction of the Scottish party would be too fierce.
The party is still awaiting endorsement of its conference proposal
that the Edinburgh Parliament could not be dissolved by Westminster
without its own consent, giving it a stronger position than the UK's
previous devolved Parliament, Northern Ireland's Stormont, which
Westminster suspended in 1972.
