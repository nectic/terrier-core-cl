Adrian would still like to be a striking success
MAYBE he had his Andy Warhol allowance of 15 minutes' fame eight years
ago, but Adrian Sprott has managed to keep popping into the headlines
from the part-time world of first and second divisions since he became a
household name (albeit one that caused great embarrassment in some
households) by scoring the goal that knocked Rangers out of the Scottish
Cup in January, 1987.
He was at it again during the week when, alongside the scoreline that
read Stenhousemuir 4, Berwick Rangers 1, ran the name Sprott (4). At 33,
to be knocking in four goals, even if two were penalty kicks, is no mean
feat, and he does seem to work well when the team in the other half is
called Rangers.
That should not be presumed, however, by Dundee United, who will be
next to face the Sprott talents in the final of the Challenge Cup
tomorrow.
The man who has to be the most famous Hamilton goalscorer of all time,
did some serious damage to St Johnstone, who also hail from Tayside,
last season when he scored direct from a corner to save his team from
defeat in the Scottish Cup last season.
It was a vital strike, too, because he and his team-mates, under the
guidance of manager Terry Christie, went on to beat Saints 4-0 in the
replay, then startled Aberdeen 2-0 in the fourth round before losing to
Hibs in a quarter-final.
Sprott has managed these excursions into the headlines during a career
that has been pursued mainly in the less exalted regions of the Scottish
game. He did have one season in the relatively heady atmosphere of the
premier division when he was with Hamilton, but otherwise Adrian has
been doing his bit in the lower leagues.
Perhaps he would have made more regular headlines, although not quite
as spectacular, if the strong rumour that Everton wanted to sign him had
gained substance during his teenage spell with Meadowbank Thistle, which
began in 1979.
''I remember getting a bit carried away with the prospect of going
there,'' he said, ''and maybe if I knew then what I know now I would
have handled things differently, but it never got to the concrete
negotiation stage anyway.''
Sprott, like so many of his peers who earn their crust the hard way
travelling all over the country to play in front of crowds that would be
short of a Rangers AGM quorum, does wonder how he would have coped with
promotion to the higher levels of the game.
''Without being an exceptional player, I always felt I could raise my
game to play at whatever level I was involved in,'' claimed Sprott. ''At
Hamilton in the premier division, I thought I raised my play well
enough. I never got the opportunity to test myself out as a full-timer.
I don't think I was consistent enough when people watched me. I blew hot
and cold.'' Most of his time has been spent sharing his football time
with his current day job, as a civilian employee of the Lothian and
Borders Police, supervisor of the lost property department.
After his first stint with Meadowbank, which lasted five-and-a-half
years, he spent two-and-half years with Hamilton and then made the
return journey to Edinburgh for a second Meadowbank spell until he
joined Stenhousemuir in August, 1993.
In his 15 years in the senior game he now has scored 105 goals, not
bad for a man who does not consider himself in the prolific class as a
scorer. ''I have been a steady scorer throughout my career, with the odd
dry spell, rather than someone who collects lots of goals.''
He will expect to be hauled back into the interview zone in January
when the third-round draw of the Tennents Scottish Cup is made. Not only
did his goal KO Rangers in the same round, but he stunned St Johnstone
at the same stage last season.
''It often works out that people seek me out after that draw to talk
about 1987 and the defeat of Rangers. It certainly doesn't bother me. At
least I had that one-off day to be remembered for.
''When I think of the number of players who would like to have been in
my shoes that day I should be grateful. It was a fantastic occasion and
the days following it were exciting. Maybe one day I'll do something
that will have me falling flat on my face, but that day will always be
with me.''
He does not have any filmed record of the great moment (''There was no
video unless Rangers have one -- but they haven't made it available'')
but still recalls how he and his team-mates had privately given
themselves not a hope of winning at Ibrox.
''We sneaked away, got the goal, and Dave McKellar had one of those
days in our goal.'' In his time, Sprott has won promotion medals with
Hamilton and Meadowbank, but neither he nor his current side have won
any cup of the status of Sunday's final.
The fact that Stenhousemuir have made it to the final is testament to
their ability to lift their play when required, as they did so well in
the major cup competition last season.
It would not be quite as startling to the populace if they beat Dundee
United and were able to take the cup back to the town where a reception
is planned, win or lose, but it would be a notable achievement.
''We are playing what is really a premier league side,'' says
Sprott,'' even if they are temporarily in the first division, so we know
it will be hard. But we are well organised so, if we don't win, I don't
think we will lose by much. Either way it is going to be a great day out
for the club. We are going to enjoy ourselves.''
He makes the point that for a lot of the Stenhousemuir players, this
could be their last chance to win a cup medal. ''Realistically, we are
not going to get to the finals of the League or Scottish Cup unless
there is a miracle. As a player, I have no aspirations to go into
coaching or management so for me in particular, there may not be any
more chances to win a cup.'' Colleagues, like Graeme Armstrong, George
McGeachie, and Eamonn Bannon, may go on to coaching or management places
within the game, but Sprott intends to live on his memories as a player
rather than endure the torments of the manager's life.
''My main ambition is just to enjoy this day. Of course, it would be
nice if I was to get one of these goals that seem to have helped me
along the way, but whatever happens I want to remember the day as
special.''
He has fitted in the hectic dual life that most part-timers have to
experience reasonably well. ''My employers are good when I do need time
off. They encourage the staff to be sporting minded. Terry also is
reasonable about players when they may have to miss training or are
late. He has always understood the problems of players with jobs.''
Training on Tuesdays and Thursdays, playing on Saturdays, and
sometimes midweek, leaves little time to enjoy bringing up his
four-and-half-year-old daughter, Blair, but he and wife Karen do their
best to use what time is available wisely. Karen is no great lover of
football, however, although she will be there tomorrow for the big day.
Adrian recalls the last occasion he took her and Blair along to a
game, a league match for which he was absent because of injury. ''Blair
came in to the game with me but Karen sat outside in the car and read a
book.'' It is not a surprise, therefore, that the man who has survived
15 years in the old rough-and-tough business is untroubled by ego
problems.
In that context he could cope with another headline tomorrow.

IF there is one thing Scottish clubs have become well accustomed to,
it is the mourning after the night before.
European defeats, disappointments, and depressions have become as much
a part of the football scenario north of the Border in the last decade
as glorious victories and triumphant trips were in the previous two, but
this time the downward graph fits neatly alongside the experience of
English clubs, with few exceptions.
It has become the pattern almost annually to examine, dissect, bisect,
and analyse every possible reason as to the poverty of play that seems
to be glaringly obvious when UK teams move out of their own orbit.
Apart from a commendable effort by Rangers in the Champions' League
three years ago, there has been a long, dreary trail of defeat and
humiliation, although Raith Rovers warrant a mention in dispatches as
the only team out of eight British sides to score a goal in Europe this
week.
The answers to the three-letter question, why?, are as involved and
indecipherable as some of our coaches' manuals but for Celtic manager
Tommy Burns, who was one of the team leaders left feeling inadequate
during the week, the solution is summed up with helpful clarity.
''Neglect,'' he says with considerable emphasis. ''Ten years of
neglect. The players playing at a high level in this country today
should have been taught properly 10 years ago. I would hate to be a
current Scottish player, because all they see are headlines saying how
bad they are.
''It must be difficult for them, but I still believe there are a lot
of good players in Scotland. I have no doubts about that and if they can
just concentrate on working on their skills, even the experienced ones,
they would benefit greatly.''
Burns, who has always been a deep thinker about the game, has already
set out at Parkhead with a single-minded determination to produce a side
that plays to his principles, to find and finance facilities for the
very young, and set in place a system that will make Celtic dependent on
their ability to nurture their own players. He wants also to see
attitudes and philosophies changed from an early age.
Meanwhile, the English FA, alarmed by the Premiership flops in Europe,
with the exception of Nottingham Forest, are setting up a summit meeting
of clubs to seek a way out of the humiliating series of exits by their
best clubs.
Managers of the six English clubs involved in the three European
competitions are being invited to the summit, which is likely to be held
within the next few weeks.
Invitations will go to Ray Harford (Blackburn), Joe Royle (Everton),
Alex Ferguson (Manchester United), Roy Evans (Liverpool), Frank Clark
(Nottingham Forest), and Howard Wilkinson (Leeds).
There are no plans to call Scotland's Euro flops together by the SFA.
Jim Farry, the chief executive, said yesterday: ''We have to keep this
in perspective. Scottish clubs have had three successes in Europe
(meaning Celtic, Rangers, and Aberdeen) and sporadic successes since. We
are not top of the tree in Europe, but we will not press the panic
button.''
However, it would seem that asking the clubs to have a talk-in does
not quite constitute a panic measure and it would perhaps contribute to
the evidence being gathered by the commission set up by the SFA, chaired
by Ernie Walker, which is looking into all aspects of the game here.
Said Farry: ''There is a long-term strategy in reshaping the game. We
have been developing the game for more than 100 years and it will take
us time to reshape it to meet the challenges of the new millenium.''
Another manager made good sense yesterday. Alex McLeish, of
Motherwell, winner of a Cup-winners' Cup medal with Aberdeen, saw
Celtic's defeat by Paris St Germain on Thursday. Said McLeish: ''There
is a problem for all of Scottish football to address because we are
lagging miles behind the continentals.
''I don't see that changing in the forseeable future unless a club can
get a really talented group of youngsters breaking through at the same
time, then buy in the right players to strengthen the team.''
According to fans of all shades this week, there seems to be a long
slog ahead of them.

PLAYERS' representatives and the Scottish Rugby Union will hold
another bout of contract negotiations at Murrayfield tomorrow amid a
growing realisation that a deal might not be signed before the first
international match of the season against Western Samoa in a fortnight's
time.
The discussions are supposed to be secret with players warned not to
discuss developments with third parties. However, as The Herald reported
yesterday, the maximum amount which players can expect to earn from
their five international outings is a little more than #20,000.
The players are not too concerned about the prospect of contracts
remaining unsigned before the Western Samoan match. They would prefer to
get a good deal rather than rush into an agreement. The SRU has tabled a
proposal for a #5000 retainer for the five-month contract -- a separate
deal being planned for the New Zealand tour next summer -- covering the
Samoan match and the four games of the Five Nations' tournament.
Under draft proposals, match fees of #2000 would be supplemented with
win-bonuses of #1500 per man.
However, The Herald understands that many within the squad would
rather cut the size of the win bonus and add that to the general
retainer.
This is new territory for all concerned in the negotiations -- Rob
Wainwright, Craig Chalmers and Ian McLauchlan for the players -- and the
SRU team headed by senior vice-president Fred McLeod, who has said all
along that the Union will pay only what it can afford.
*ALAN Sharp, Bristol's international prop forward, has withdrawn as
the Scotland A loose head for the match against Western Samoa at Hawick
on November 12 because of a groin injury. He is replaced by Grant Wilson
of Boroughmuir.

IF another traumatic week in the foreign arena has taught us anything
it is that Scottish football, even if SFA chief executive Jim Farry is
unwilling to press any panic button, again faces the threat of dropping
even further behind Europe's progressive nations. But the most immediate
threat to the domestic game's future is emanating from an off-field
source.
The consequences of the Jean Marc Bosman affair could change the
Scottish game, indeed football in Britain, beyond all recognition if the
opinion of the European Court of Justice's Advocate General, Carl Otto
Lenz, who has said the transfer system is illegal, becomes European law.
Normally, the judges ratify the Advocate General's findings and, if
that happens in this case, transfer fees could be abolished by early
next year. It is this prospect which has prompted the 49 national
associations of UEFA to issue an open letter yesterday spelling out the
dangers.
Without wishing to strike more fear than is necessary into the heart
of the Scottish game, the underlying message was that the fall-out from
the Bosman case constitutes a grave danger to the future of some clubs.
''Some Scottish clubs are dependent on selling players,'' said Farry.
''In some cases the transfer money from one player pays the wages of
those who remain.''
Some of the top players may be rubbing their hands in anticipation of
the riches which might come their way, but if they were to demand
greater salaries and incentives it could be they would become such a
severe drain on football's finances that recovery might prove
impossible.
Bosman, a Belgian player, became the first professional to challenge
football's transfer system, bringing in the Treaty of Rome which was the
founding document for the European Community. In so doing, he became the
first to demand the right of freedom of movement and the implications
for the game are enormous.
The SFA and UEFA's other member associations are lobbying their own
governments to have the Advocate General's opinion rejected. While Farry
was holding court in Glasgow, his counterpart in London, the FA's Graham
Kelly, was saying letters seeking support have been written to the Prime
Minister, opposition leader Tony Blair, and the Liberal Democrats.
''Sport has a specific, peculiar nature which should be recognised by
the Treaty of Rome so that normal rules which the Advocate General is
relying on at the moment would no longer apply,'' Kelly said.
Alasdair Bell, a Scots lawyer working out of Brussels, said that the
European Court has the power to accept parts of Lenz's ruling which also
threatens football's three non-nationals rule.
Rangers, of course, are determined to have this particular rule
scrapped and in that respect ''they are at odds with the association,''
according to Farry. ''One club has written to the SFA. That keeps it in
perspective.
''If our current champion club feel that removing the 3+2 rule (three
non-nationals and two assimilated foreign players) will help them they
misjudged the situation. In the longer term they will come to realise
the viewpoint held by the SFA will be to their benefit.''
Farry, the SFA, and the 48 other members of UEFA believe it is
fundamentally wrong of the EC to expect to impose their law on an
organisation which deals with many more countries which are not members.
Being an optimist, the Scottish chief executive also believes Lenz's
opinion will not be upheld.
However, just how significantly will football have to change if it is?
''Well, Rangers will have to give a lot of their money to
Stenhousemuir,'' said Farry. ''That is what will have to happen. The
bigger and wealthier clubs will have to see a lot of the money they
currently keep being distributed throughout the game.''
Even then some clubs, the weaker and smaller, would be killed off
without the finance which they generate through transfers and it would
also be the case that in sweeping away the 3+2 rule Scottish talent
would be stifled.

THE sport will break new ground in February when Malta becomes the
venue for the European Open-Malta, the first world ranking tournament to
take place on the island.
The Maltese date is one of 10 WPBSA ranking tournaments this season,
and one of four overseas ranking events on the calendar, the others
being the German Open, the Singha Thailand Classic, and the Klosters
Thailand Open.
World champion Stephen Hendry will head the field in Malta, defending
the title he won in Belgium last year. However, most local interest will
focus upon world No.14 Tony Drago, Malta's top sportsman.
''I have played snooker all over the world and to finally have an
event in Malta is a dream come true,'' said Drago.

THE Toyota team were disqualified from the world championship by the
International Automobile Federation (FIA) yesterday for using illegal
turbo restrictors on their cars in last month's Catalunya Rally.
The team, highly placed in the contests for the drivers' and
manufacturers' world titles, were also suspended from the championship
for one year, with immediate effect.
''It is the most sophisticated and ingenious device I have seen in 30
years of motor sport,'' said FIA president Max Mosley.
Didier Auriol lost fourth place in Spain because the gadget was
adjudged to have illegally enabled the engine of his car to become too
powerful. Team-mate Juha Kankkunen had already retired but he, too, was
excluded by rally stewards.

FOOD
DALEPAK Foods has agreed to merge with chilled food products company
Cavaghan &amp; Gray in a deal worth #43.4m, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Cavaghan is one of the 10 largest food suppliers to Marks &amp; Spencer
which it has been supplying for more than 30 years.
Dalepak manufactures a range of meat and vegetable frozen products,
both branded and customer own label, for major UK food retailers other
than M &amp; S.
Dalepak is to issue 41.1 million new shares and will also raise about
#13m by way of an open offer for a further 14.3 million shares at 105p
per share on the basis of 31 new Dalepak shares for every 25 existing.
The proceeds of the offer will be used to fund the development of the
enlarged group and repay some of its borrowings.
There are thought to be significant benefits to both companies
accruing from the merger. These include reduced seasonality, increased
product range and the development of new value-added frozen products
through combined research and development programmes and access to an
enlarged customer base.
The merged company, to be known as Cavaghan &amp; Gray Group, intends to
pay a total dividend of 4.2p per share for the period ending 31 March,
1996.

THAT was the week that was. And what a week. Rob Wainwright is named
captain of Scotland, there's a bunch of fresh faces in the Scottish
side, Doddie Weir and Gary Armstrong are taking a crash course in
parliamo Geordie, and Gary is appointed captain of a very, very
interesting Scotland A outfit.
I don't want to stand accused of sucking up to my new skipper when
he's not yet a week into his captaincy, but Rob is the perfect man for
the job. Even before he was named Rob was the players' choice. He has a
quiet authority about him and he's a hell of a player as well.
He's got 17 caps, which is a bit misleading because, although he
didn't make the breakthrough into international rugby until quite late,
he's also missed a few games through injury.
We'll all be hoping that he's put that behind him and that he can have
a really good run at taking over from Gavin Hastings. That, in itself,
will be a hard task. Gav was, and is, a superstar. He is one of the few
rugby players around recognised all over the world, even by non-rugby
folk .
Rob will be my third Scotland captain. When I first got into the side
in Australia three years ago David Sole was the captain. Then there was
Gavin and now Rob. They are three very different characters.
David was very intense, and for a youngster like me, a bit of a
forbidding character. But he was a superb captain, who led by example
and who was always a first class ambassador for the game and his country
off the field as well.
Gavin was a different personality altogether. He was just as good an
ambassador as David but I, for one, always found him a much easier
individual to talk to. Maybe part of that was due to the fact that I had
been around for a wee bit longer by the time Gavin took over, but when
you put the pair of them together then Rob has got a couple of very hard
acts to follow.
I've no doubt, though, that he'll cope as to the manner born, if for
no other reason than that he possesses that most invaluable of
commodities, a finely tuned sense of humour. As an Army doctor he knows
where to find the funny bone and I wouldn't be at all surprised if he
knew that it was called the humerus as well.
Is Tyneside ready for big Doddie Weir? It seems that negotiations are
continuing between Rob Andrew, Doddie and Gary. If they go then I'm sure
that they go with the good wishes of the entire Scottish rugby
community. Gary especially deserves a break -- sorry, I'll rephrase
that, Gary is due some good luck -- and if he can get himself a
three-year deal which would help to set him up in his rugby retirement
then I can't think of anybody who deserves it more.
It must be a source of worry, especially for Border clubs, to see top
players nipping over the Border, but the times they are a-changing, and
that is something which Scottish clubs are going to have to start
thinking hard about.
My good pal Doddie gives the impression of being a big daft laddie.
Don't believe it. George is as shrewd as they come. He's a farmer, after
all. He and Gary would make some combination down in Geordie-land.
Howay-the-lads.

UK BANKING
TSB will launch a drive to do more business with with small companies
in Scotland following its merger with Lloyds Bank at the end of this
year.
''We are going to focus very heavily on the small business sector,
that is companies or partnerships with a turnover of up to #1m,'' said
Alastair Dempster, the chief executive of TSB Bank Scotland.
He said TSB would draw on Lloyds' experience in business banking and
international finance to achieve this and would increase the number of
its business banking centres in Scotland from five at present to more
than 20.
''TSB is traditionally very strong in the personal banking sector, but
it is only in the last 10 to 15 years that we have become involved with
the small and medium-sized business sector,'' Mr Dempster said.
He said there would be ''no net job losses in Scotland'' as a result
of the merger, even though City analysts expect several thousand jobs to
be shed south of the Border.
TSB has 200 branches in Scotland whereas Lloyds has only four, so
there is virtually no overlap.
TSB has closed 35 branches in Scotland during the past year, but Mr
Dempster declined to say how many more would be axed. However, he did
say: ''There are no immediate plans to close a large number of
branches.''
Mr Dempster said any job losses among TSB's 2300 employees in Scotland
would be offset by the creation of jobs in business and telephone
banking.
He confirmed that 500 to 600 jobs would be created at TSB's new
telephone banking centre in Glasgow over the next three to five years as
it expands to serve Lloyds customers south of the border.
TSB and Lloyds say their merger will produce annual savings of #350m
by 1999 as a result of integrating their head offices and computer
systems and merging their wholesale banking and mortgage operations.
But these activities are all concentrated in England, along with the
insurance and fund management operations whose future remains unclear,
so Scotland will escape any associated job cuts.
Mr Dempster said TSB Bank Scotland would retain its separate name and
corporate identity after the merger, with its own board and headquarters
in Edinburgh.
Lloyds and TSB yesterday posted details of the proposed merger to
their shareholders, along with a timetable for completing it on December
28.
Lloyds has called an extraordinary general meeting in London on
November 27 to approve the merger, which will create the largest High
Street bank in the UK, with a market capitalisation of #13.5bn.
TSB will hold a similar EGM in Glasgow two days later.
The new Lloyds/TSB Group will be 70.7% owned by Lloyds Bank
shareholders and 29.3% owned by shareholders in TSB.
Its headquarters will be in London, but its registered office will be
in Edinburgh, which means that all annual meetings will be held in
Scotland.
TSB and Lloyds said yesterday that the merged group would propose a
final dividend of at least 7.8p per share for 1995 -- equivalent to
21.1p per Lloyds share.

JAPANESE BANKING
THE BANK of England has given the all-clear to the London branch of
Daiwa Bank, the Japanese financial giant which has been ordered by
regulators in the US to close its activities there after a 24-count
criminal indictment for conspiracy and fraud, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
An inquiry mounted jointly by the Bank and the Securities and Futures
Authority found no irregularities in the bank's City of London
operations.
A Bank of England spokeswoman commented: ''We have conducted an
investigation into Daiwa Bank London under section 39 of the Banking
Act.
''There was no evidence of irregularities of the kind that affected
Daiwa Bank in the United States or anything which could constitute a
threat to depositors in the UK.''
In Tokyo, Daiwa Bank, said it would pull back overseas and might be
forced to merge with giant Sumitomo Bank.
Some analysts said Daiwa's future as anything more than a regional
bank was in doubt unless such a merger went ahead.
Japanese authorities, whose own credibility has been damaged by the
scandal, vowed meanwhile to do everything possible to keep the case from
undermining confidence in the nation's banking system and from
unsettling markets.
The Daiwa scandal, which broke in September, ignited existing global
worries about Japan's financial system, already staggering under heaps
of bad loans inherited from the bursting of the 1980s ''bubble economy''
of sky-high asset prices.

AIRLINES
ROBERT Ayling, above, managing director of British Airways, has
formally become heir apparent to Sir Colin Marshall as head of the flag
carrier.
He is to become chief executive on January 1, while Sir Colin will
remain chairman though in a non-executive capacity. However, he will
still be at the heart of things as he will devote half his time to the
group.
''I think now is an entirely appropriate time and part of the natural
order of things to hand over stewardship of the airline to a younger
man,'' said Sir Colin who is 62.
He added that he wanted to pursue other interests which include a
recent appointment as deputy chairman of the CBI and a board member of
the New York Stock Exchange. Sir Colin has been chairman since taking
over from Lord King in Fenruary 1993, after 10 years as chief executive.
Mr Ayling, a youthful-looking 48, joined British Airways in 1985,
having come to the group's notice when as a senior civil servant at the
then Department of Trade he was responsible for the Parliamentary Bill
for BA's privatisation.
He was closely involved in the group's restructuring and route
development and became managing director in 1993. He took an active role
in fighting Virgin's ''dirty tricks'' allegations.
It is thought Mr Ayling's role will not change much as Sir Colin will
still handle political and regulatory matters.

Allan Laing speaks to Scots actor Ian Richardson on the eve of his
swansong as a back-stabbing statesman
THE eyes have it. Icy and piercing. Dark enough to kill you with that
familiar fleeting glance. Dangerous and yet at the same time faintly
lugubrious. A very proper villain. Ian Richardson delivers English
upper-class superiority as if he were born to it.
Which is curious because he wasn't. Not a bit of it. You cannot tell
it from his accent, but Richardson is a Scot. And a real one, born and
raised in the capital. Indeed, it was those dreich Saturday afternoon
matinees at his local picture house in Edinburgh which inspired him to
play the acting game.
In 1957 he completed a three-year course at the RSAMD in Glasgow and
embarked upon a distinguished classical acting career with the RSC. And
then it was onwards to a series of wonderfully sinister television
roles. He played the duplicious Bill Hayden in the acclaimed adaptation
of John le Carre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and later went on to
play another spy, a real life one this time -- arch-traitor Anthony
Blunt.
Still, Scot or not, Richardson's most infamous character -- that
scheming, conniving, incorrigible Parliamentary rogue Francis Urquhart
-- has a past which is firmly rooted in the true blue English County
Set. Devious? Here is an insanely ambitious politician who could teach
Machiavelli a trick or three. Mad, bad, and dangerous to leave in charge
of a country.
Urquhart has the distinction of being one of the few figures in modern
fiction to have, to coin a phrase, coined a phrase. ''You might say
that; I couldn't possibly comment,'' he is apt to say. It is a remark
which is now common parlance. Indeed, it has been adopted with gleeful
relish by many a politician, parodying its mischievious intent at every
cut and turn. Even John Major has been heard to utter the words
(ironically, of course).
Tomorrow sees the back-stabbing statesman (Urquhart, not Major) return
for a third and last time. The Final Cut, adapted by Andrew Davies from
the novel by Michael Dobbs, signals the end of a particularly twisted
road for the old devil. Like the two previous books, House of Cards and
To Play The King, it is a juicy tale of political intrigue and
chicanery, centring upon the ageing but still villainous Urquhart's
attempts to seek a kind of Thatcher-like immortality by brokering a
peace deal between the Greeks and the Turks in Cyprus.
Meanwhile, back in the Commons, what you might call the Tory Party's
Young Turks are jockeying for position and plotting against the master
plotter. There is the ruthless back-bencher Claire Carlsen (Isla Blair)
who is embroiled in a passionate affair with Foreign Secretary Tom
Makepiece (Paul Freeman). And then, lurking in the background as ever,
is the power behind the Urquhart throne -- his devoted and equally
devious wife Elizabeth (Diane Fletcher).
The new series has already caused some degree of controversy because
of the fact that Dobbs, a died-in-the-wool Conservative and former party
official, took exception to the fact that scriptwriter Davies invented a
state funeral for Baroness Thatcher. Dobbs found this to be distasteful
-- if for no other reason than the fact that his heroine is very much
alive -- and insisted that his name be removed from the credits. It was.
Richardson, in his best Urquhart voice, ventures an opinion on the
affair. ''I would beg you to remember one thing; at the end of the first
novel it was Urquhart and not the girl (Mattie, the investigative
journalist played by Pride and Prejudice star Susannah Harker) who came
off the House of Commons roof.
''It was Andrew Davies who decided that he was far too good a
character to lose in a suicide fall. He turned the tables around and
enabled Michael to go on writing other novels about Francis Urquhart.
''That makes life very nice for us all involved in the television
series -- and Michael has done rather well out of it too!''
Richardson insists that, despite the contretemps, the pair of them
remain firm friends. ''All that lives must die. I've probably only got
about another 10 years myself. But I won't hear a word said against
Michael. As a chap he's a marvellous fellow.''
The actor, it seems, has reached the stage where he could see the
Urquhart character far enough. ''I'll be glad to see the back of the old
bugger,'' he admits. ''I've lived with him for five years and he has got
under my skin.
''There are only so many looks to camera you can do as Urquhart and
I'm an actor; I like variety. The trouble is I'm always being offered
parts as complete bastards. Luckily though, they are usually
well-paid.''
Was Ian Richardson in any way like the character he plays? ''I would
hope not,'' he remarks. ''But I can be dictatorial. I expect people to
do exactly as I say; but my wife always wins in the end -- as indeed
Urquhart's wife does in the series.''
He says that at the time when the role first came about in 1990 he had
been anxious to do anything other than television.
''When this huge script arrived I remember thinking 'Please let it be
no good' so that I could turn it down. But by the time I had read it I
knew that if anyone else was offered the part I would happily cut their
throat. Those roles come up once in a lifetime and I am proud to have
played him.''
Richardson reveals that he now wants to do something far removed from
Urquhart. He is, in fact, particularly keen to play a Scots character.
''I've not used that accent on television,'' he admits.

I FEEL the recent articles by Jill Crawshaw misrepresent the state of
the tourist industry in Scotland.
I have travelled extensively throughout the world and could similarly
have written a negative fault-finding report of my experiences for any
of the countries that I have visited. This is particularly so if
travelling in the ''off season'', alone and without forward planning or
organisation. However, I prefer to overlook the imperfections and
concentrate on the enjoyable aspects of travelling in another land.
The tourist industry in Scotland is not perfect but is improving and
adapting to customers' needs, though continued investment is essential.
Little has been achieved by sending a travel-weary critic into
Scotland other than to generate the inevitable correspondence in the
letters page. A worthwhile report may have been obtained by sending a
genuine tourist.

CONGRATULATIONS to The Herald for commissioning the investigation of
Scottish tourism; for distinguishing the city and business standards
from the nearly plebian; for taking the obvious route; and for allowing
the beauties to shine through.
My first reaction would be to say that I wouldn't have fallen into the
''disappointments''. I would have thought from experience that things
''fall off'' in October; that Inverness, Fort William and Mallaig have
always had to struggle to be more than gateways to better things.
Cyclists were always told to start their Road to the Isles from Spean
Bridge, for instance, and today one of the nicest things about Inverness
is the Kessock throughway. I recall Mallaig for the determination of a
train traveller not to leave his seat by the window (facing only a
station wall) while the rest of us turned out to stretch our eyes and
legs over the views of the west.
Yes, I would have done some homework on guide-books and balanced some
dearer against some cheaper meals and rooms. The danger zone is indeed
''take-what-you-get'' middle.
Take Fort William -- the best of all excursions needs only a car, two
legs and rainwear; up Glen Nevis to admire one of Europe's finest
waterfalls from a path well-described as ''Himalayan'', not in ascent or
risk, but in astonishing effect.
I could name two hotels (one at Banavie, again a spectacle in canal
engineering equal to any) where I would be absolutely sure of
hospitality without breaking into three figures. I would have read the
Taste of Scotland brochure and found the brilliant seafood.
In fairness it may be that the Saga/Wallace Arnold visitors are having
a wonderful time for next to no effort. In fairness, investment in a
small Scottish hotel/bar has always been on the edge of personal ruin --
and occasional breakthrough. In fairness, the worst things that happened
to your traveller were down to the failures in face-to-face and
person-to-person.
But that is very serious, as it is the goal of all tourism -- to like
and to be liked. To get into an affectionate frame of mind from which
you learn to avoid the traps.

I WOULD not care to travel with that grouchy frump Jill Crawshaw --
such a prejudiced messenger deserves no mercy.
My husband and I are touring Scotland for the fourth time because we
like learning of both the gory and glorious intrigues of Scottish
history, in combination with seeing the natural beauty of the
countryside and concluding each day with the ambience of the various
inns and hotels we selected from the information sent to us by the
Scottish Tourist Board.
The crown and symbols interpreted easily by anyone with normal
intelligence. We don't book at what obviously would be a dismal
establishment. Our choices (within the price range Ms Crawshaw implied
she paid) have been overall pleasing with plenty of soap, shampoo,
private bathrooms and only charm overflowing -- if Ms Crawshaw had done
her homework she would have discovered that ''commended'' is the magic
word.
On the other hand our experience is that the phrase to be avoided like
the plague is ''leisure facilities''. The last thing we'd wish to see at
our chosen eighteenth-century inn or country house is a swimming pool
with or without algae, or a dank sauna with or without bacteria, or a
flashing machine game room.

LET Jill Crawshaw's report on Scottish tourism be a warning to the
industry to invest more time and money in the training of their staff --
now is the time to start investing in people during the low season.
We must not tolerate incompetence, indifference, bad service and poor
value for money if Scotland is to be a serious player in global tourism.
However, the report made no mention of the time and money being invested
by the leading tourism bodies to improve standards.
Tourism Training Scotland was set up in 1992 to tackle the very issues
raised by Jill Crawshaw. We have a wide range of initiatives and
training courses to suit every kind of tourism business including B&amp;Bs,
small guest houses, visitor attractions and hotels to name but a few.
For help and advice available, your local enterprise company or
Scottish Enterprise's tourism team will be delighted to help on 0141 248
2700. We would argue you to do everything in your power to ensure that
headlines like ''Sorry, we're closed'' and ''Scotland the grave'' are
simply not applicable.

<HEADLINE>New Zealander rekindles Accies' flame. He's Greene by name but not by profession</HEADLINE>

JOHN BEATTIE meets a man, an expert on the field and off it, who has
come from the other side of the world to coach rugby in Glasgow.
THE spotlight falls on Kevin Greene, the former Waikato coach who is
taking charge of Glasgow Accies, and it shows that they do things
differently in New Zealand. After thursday night's training session, Rae
Greene, Kevin's wife, was hosting six of the single lads from the club
for their regular free nosh up.
It's a commitment Greene and his family have to the wellbeing of a
club that few others in this country will possess. It's a mark, too, of
the unassuming side of one of the world's top coaches.
Further proof that Greene is indeed a world-rated coach is the fact
that when he went back to New Zealand for his holidays in the summer, he
was asked by those in power to put his name down to coach one of the IPC
sides in New Zealand.
With Rupert Murdoch having bought over rights for the new, and
altered, ''Super Ten,'' there was room for five New Zealand teams, and
so they have combined their best provinces to make five world-beaters.
The IPC teams.
For instance, Auckland are merging with Counties, while Wellington,
Taranaki and Manawatu make up another. Frightening isn't it? ''At this
stage, I don't have any real targets of coaching up the ladder here in
Scotland, although I am happy to help if I am asked.
''My first job was to change this club because. That is why I was
brought over. All I have tried to do at Accies is teach them that
dedication is what is needed. I have been rekindling the flame, and
changing the attitude of the players.
''They are now better, harder, and fitter. But I am here for one more
year at the moment, and after that I would like to coach an IPC team
back home. One of the reasons I didn't say yes this time is that my son
is receiving such a good education at the Academy.''
But he has said yes to the Glasgow set up. Along with Gordon
MacPherson, the West of Scotland coach and former Otago player, Green
took charge of the squad at Scotstoun on Wednesday night, and he will
look after the side for the Griqualand West game later this month.
''I am very impressed by the people at the head of the set-up here in
Glasgow. Hamish Fyfe and Hugh Campbell are very capable guys.
''I am happy to work with Hugh, and I like his views on rugby. I am
impressed with his attitude and his thoughts. I am also impressed by his
results, and that is what counts. I think the place has the right guys
at the helm.''
I agree. I have to admit that I was surprised when I first met Greene
and watched him coaching. Greene is a thinker, with a quiet way about
him that suggests that the way to win rugby is through the very soul of
the human body, and the brain that powers it.
He uses the power of thought and skill and fitness. There is no blood
and fire in his team talks, more a reasoned expose of the opposition and
its weaknesses. Sometimes even its strengths.
I watched him sort out a typical Glasgow Academical discussion earlier
this year on whether the boys were to train at 6.30pm or 7pm. In years
gone by, this would have taken hours to resolve, with the end result
being a 6.30 start and the lads would be out and changed at 7.15.
Greene's word was law. And it was a quiet word too. ''We train at
seven until I change it to 6.30 when it gets darker.'' He said. There
were bemused looks all around. People don't usually speak that kind of
logical common sense.
The success of the Accies isn't all down to Greene, of course, as the
playing pool this year has been strengthened with a stealth that would
do the SAS proud. But Bobby Sloan of Grangemouth phoned me the other
day. ''That is some team you have there now,'' he said after his side
had been beaten by Greene's men.
''And some set of backs. That's the best back play I have seen for a
while. Tell me, how did the Accies get Kevin Greene?'' The answer,
perhaps, is that like the other Glasgow teams, the bold Accies, under
Brian Simmers, have rediscovered big-time ambition.
Whatever, the city has one of the world's top coaches in the world in
its midst. And he will not be here for ever. Let's learn from his rugby,
and let's learn from his humility and sociability, while he is here.

CAMERON Glasgow, disappointed about being left out of the Scotland A
team to face the touring Western Samoans, was yesterday named as left
wing for the Edinburgh team to face the Samoans at Inverleith next
Wednesday.
Whereas the A team management had expressed doubt about Glasgow's
readiness to play against the tourists because of a long injury enforced
lay-off, the Edinburgh selectors took a different view.
''We were very encouraged with his form for Heriot's in the two league
games he has played since returning from an ankle injury,'' said Ian
Barnes, the Edinburgh coach. ''He will certainly have something to prove
next Wednesday.''
Glasgow will be part of a back three all of whom are full backs.
Duncan Macrae, who played on the wing for Scotland under-21 but who has
filled the No.15 position for most of his time with Boroughmuir, is on
the right wing, allowing Nick Marden to come in at full back.
The return of Glasgow was something of a bonus for the Edinburgh
selectors, who were unable to consider Scott Hastings and Duncan Hodge
because of injuries and felt that they did not want to put any further
pressure on Stuart Reid.
David Laird, one of five Boroughmuir players in the side comes in for
Hastings while Tam McVie, who impressed in the Scotland under-21 team at
Jedburgh on Wednesday night, is at No.8.
Edinburgh -- N Marden (Boroughmuir); D Macrae (Boroughmuir), D Laird
(Boroughmuir), D Wyllie (Stewart's Melville FP), captain, C Glasgow
(Heriot's FP); A Donaldson (Currie), G Burns (Stewart's Melville FP); G
Wilson (Boroughmuir), P Haslett (Edinburgh Academicals), S Paul
(Heriot's FP), D Burns (Boroughmuir), S Murray (Edinburgh Academicals),
B Ward (Currie), T McVie (Heriot's FP), G Dall (Heriot's FP).
Replacements -- R McNulty (Stewart's Melville FP), A Cadzow (Stewart's
Melville FP), D Clark (Stewart's Melville FP), G Beveridge
(Boroughmuir), A Garry (Watsonians), F Henderson (Watsonians).

I WAS at a dinner two years ago in Glasgow where Rangers' keeper Andy
Goram was one of the speakers. ''If the championship had been for
drinking then we'd have won it by November he said.''
Well, ha ha, tee hee, giggle giggle. What a disgrace that was.
Look. None of the football writers have had the guts to say it. None
of the TV or radio football pundits have had the guts to say it. And
none of the managers have had the guts to say it.
But, just like that speech of Goram's in the Hospitality Inn in
Glasgow that night, the performances of the big Scottish football teams
in Europe were an absolute disgrace. Both Rangers and Celtic let the
country down. Raith Rovers didn't.
And you know the reason? The big teams, who pay their stars obscene
amounts of money, didn't do everything at their disposal to win games.
People who are earning half a million quid a year have not done
absolutely everything in their power to remain, or become, the best
players in the world. They are lazy.
These blokes who earn this vast amount of cash train in the mornings
only. Most of them knock off at lunch time.
As a former rugby player I can hardly believe that. I know plenty of
rugby players who train more than that -- and they don't get paid yet --
and put in that amount of time as well as holding down full-time jobs.
In this country, we are besotted by football. All of the media is
dominated by a game that, as is patently obvious, we are very bad at on
a world scale. In fact we don't even try that hard at it.
All I hear on the ''Off the Ball'' phone in on Radio Scotland is
people calling to say how bad the games have been, and yet it's wall to
wall football. It's wall to wall dross. And then, when the game in
Scotland is shown up for what it is, no one has the guts to say it.
It is mince!
Are all you football journalists scared of the chaps at Rangers and
Celtic or something?
Take rugby by contrast -- or maybe it's the same. How on earth we as a
small country have been able to get near the top is not, as soccer folk
will argue, because there are less rugby playing countries, it is
because our rugby players -- bless them they have their critics -- are
trying their hardest for Scotland to be one of the best at the game. For
the Scottish rugby team to survive on the big pitch, it has to have
trained, practised, and thought much harder than the opposition.
I actually believe that we will find it hard to beat Western Samoa.
They will be far more dedicated to rugby and the learning of its skills
than the Rangers boys are to soccer and its skills. South African rugby
players will know more about rugby and its demands than Celtic players
will know about football and its demands.
And what is the effect of money in all of this? Well, there's no doubt
that all of that cash sloshing about in deposit accounts will make some
of the more well-off players ''comfortable'' in the sense of no longer
feeling the hunger well up inside them as they go for greatness.
What ambition is left in a young man who has earned a million? But it
doesn't make the Italian players similarly second rate. They have a
pride our lads don't. They have a dedication our soccer charlies don't.
They aren't as lazy.
Their top boys train all day. They do a real day's work for an obscene
pay at their soccer clubs.
Unless you think I am defending rugby illogically, let me just say I
think that we have our lazy rugby players too, and some of them will
come a cropper this year as their eyes become diverted to the earning of
cash. For instance, a disgraceful few of the rugby players in Glasgow do
anything about their rugby skills in the good weather during the summer.
Why not? Lazy! It's just too much like hard work to practise.
And my mind goes back to South Africa, where six companies gave the
money for a #60m Institute of Sport, and it reminds me that we just
don't harbour the same desires to be great at sport as some of the other
countries.
Soccer is this country's biggest sport. It always will be. Like all
sports people I want it to be great. But, I tell you, it needs a bloody
bomb under it right now -- and the professionals have to learn what the
word really means and stop letting down this country.

FERGUS Wallace, captain of Scotland's tour team in Zimbabwe earlier
this year, makes a timely reappearance for Boroughmuir as blind-side
flanker in the premier league match against Hawick at Meggetland today.
Glasgow will need a match-sharpened Wallace for their match against
Griqualand West at Hughenden a week on Monday.
It will be Wallace's second game for Boroughmuir, current league
leaders, though the first in his own right since his ankle fracture
during the first Test of the tour in Zimbabwe.
The former GHK forward made a try-scoring debut for 'Muir against
Edinburgh Academicals three weeks ago, but his appearance then was only
in Stuart Reid's injury absence.
Nick Marden, Boroughmuir's Edinburgh full back, also returns just in
time. He has had a prolonged absence with a rib injury, but Edinburgh
named him yesterday for the match against Western Samoa at Inverleith on
Wednesday.
Lewis Graham stands in for Peter Wright, who was sent off at
Netherdale last week and who will learn his fate on Tuesday. The
suspended prop's fellow cap, Tony Stanger, has dropped out of the Hawick
team because of a groin strain. Gregor Sharp returns in a recast
threequarter line.
GHK, struggling in the nether region of the second division, have been
joined by Geoff Caldwell, the Ayr wing who played for Scotland's
under-19 team last season. His switch to Anniesland is compensation for
GHK for the loss to Watsonians of Iain Sinclair, last season's under-19
international captain.
Alan Glen, Edinburgh Wanderers' hooker, also is on the move. He has
gone to Malleny Park, and when he makes his debut for Currie he will be
the twenty-fourth former Wanderer to appear elsewhere in the premier
league this season.
Stirling County, the defending champions, recall Gordon Mackay at wing
forward against Gala at Bridgehaugh. The Borderers retain the South
African Arnie van Rooyen at scrum half because of injuries to David
Paterson, Grant Farquharson, and David Boland.
Scotland's half-backs, Craig Chalmers and Bryan Redpath, absentees
from the defeat by Hawick last week, resume for Melrose against
Watsonians at the Greenyards.

ARCHAEOLOGISTS have unearthed the remains of a prehistoric village in
Galloway.
A team from Glasgow University Archaeological Research and Development
(Guard) unit has been excavating for seven weeks as part of an
environmental study commissioned by British Gas Premier Transco, which
is laying an underwater gas pipeline from Scotland to Northern Ireland.
The pipeline has been in the news recently over the issue of munitions
dumped in the Irish Sea found washed up on the West Coast.
Premier Transco funded a #50,000 archaeological excavation ahead of
the laying of the pipeline.
Guard has excavated remnants of a bronze-age settlement dating from
around 2000BC. Very few such sites have so far been discovered on the
Scottish mainland.
Fragments of Beaker pottery and the remains of a medieval kiln have
been found on the site.
Valuable information will be collected from aerial observation of the
dig, near Castle Kennedy, Stranraer, and from crop markings detected
during the dry summer of 1992.
Mr Gavin McGregor, excavation director, described the find as
''nationally significant''.

* JOCKEY Tim Reed did well to remain on Supertop yesterday after Len
Lungo's runner blundered badly in the novice chase at Hexham.
However, the partnership stayed in tact and Supertop ran on well to
beat Crofton Lake and give the trainer his second winner of the season.
Earlier, Willie Sparkle, the 7-4 favourite, won the conditional's
chase for Fife trainer Sue Bradburne, jumping the last five lengths
ahead of the long-time leader Live and Let Live.
This was Willie Sparkle's first win from eight starts. The nine
year-old-fell on his last outing at Carlisle 10 days ago.

THANK you for the series of articles by Jill Crawshaw on her efforts
to enjoy a weekend in the Highlands. I fear her experiences are far from
unusual and you are right in calling for a review of the aims and
functions of the tourist industry, starting with the tourist board.
There does, however, appear to be some misapprehension as to the
function of a tourist board and I am surprised that there should be such
general amazement that the STB does not sell holidays. To the best of my
knowledge no tourist board does: I have today checked this with the
English, French and Irish tourist boards in London who all confirmed
that they gave out information and could not sell holidays since they
are not travel agents.
But it is in the provision of appropriate information that the tourist
boards should shine and quite clearly do not. It would seem that no-one
offered the Autumn Gold brochure which has been heavily promoted to
tourist board members as a means of encouraging more visitors to
Scotland at this season of the year.
It must be admitted, though, that the brochure would probably not have
been very helpful as the information contained therein is neither very
full nor well-presented for those who do not already know Scotland.
Beautifully produced in wonderful colours, like so many STB
publications, it does not offer a clear message to the would-be tourist.
The section entitled Highlands and Skye consists of two (A4) pages of
ramble, one mainly taken up with photographs, and later five pages of
hotels (eight of them in Inverness) less than a quarter of which mention
actual prices, thus obliging the tourist to make further inquiries.
The Marine Hotel in Mallaig seems to be the only one featured which
was approached by Jill Crawshaw. I fear my favourite is the
advertisement for Kingussie Business Association (''various
accommodation'') topped by a photograph of the roofless Ruthven Barracks
-- it must have seemed a good idea at the time.
My experience of the tourist board is that the people who deal with
the public are generally polite, helpful and hard-working -- but they
are often handicapped by lack of information and poorly organised
back-up.
Though I suspect that many of the general public are unaware of the
fact, our local tourist board is now a company limited by guarantee,
exercising on behalf of the district council their responsibility for
promotion of the area -- but specifically not responsible for the
development of tourism which rests with the council.
As far as I can tell this pattern is repeated throughout Scotland --
and the different areas are shortly to be re-grouped. Here may we hope
is the opportunity to get properly organised so that in future years
tourism in this country may be efficiently promoted.

I CANNOT understand why The Herald should commission Jill Crawshaw to
visit Scotland at this time of year when the tourist season is almost
over. She was unfortunate with the weather and perhaps that has
contributed to her adverse criticism.
She had obviously not done any forward planning as she could have
obtained a very well-produced brochure from the tourist board for the
area to be visited, giving lists of accommodation and costs from hotels
to self-catering.

ASIDE from standards of service and accommodation, a recurrent theme
in Jill Crawshaw's writing was her appreciation of Scotland's scenery.
I have no doubt that wild land is the premier attraction for foreign
tourists as true wilderness is scarce in Europe. Unfortunately,
mismanagement and unco-ordinated development threaten the capacity of
Scotland's wild spaces to move and inspire.
Examples of this are too numerous; witness the ugliness of the
newly-constructed hotels in Tyndrum, the utterly insensitive road
straightening and widening at Morar or the appalling clearcutting in
Glen Nevis.
Repeat tourist business can be encouraged by raising the standard of
hotels and service. However, Scotland must remain worth seeing. A
determined programme of conservation and regeneration must take
precedence over short-term, destructive development.

FOLLOWING this week's controversial feature on Scottish tourism, I was
particularly pleased to hear the issue discussed on BBC Radio Scotland
by the journalist Jill Crawshaw and the STB's Graham Birse.
Such a pity that the BBC's presenter did not give Jill Crawshaw the
last word and allow her to answer Mr Birse's ''warm'' invitation to come
back to Scotland. Will she haste back?

SADLY almost everything written by Jill Crawshaw and in your editorial
about the tourist industry in Scotland is true. The tourist industry is
in a mess, and I write this as a hotelier and as an area tourist board
director.
It is easy, however, to point the finger at all the problem areas but
much more difficult to suggest a strategy for improvement and I find it
sad that your leader and Ms Crawshaw's articles both mock the singlemost
important step forward taken by STB -- the introduction of the Grading
and Classification Scheme. The scheme is clearly explained in every STB
and local tourist board publication and has nothing to do with stars and
rosettes which are awarded by private commercial companies.
Your suggestion (your only suggestion!) is for a shake-up at STB
headquarters, but this has just been done with the appointment of a new
chief executive and a new chairman. In marketing terms this is probably
significant but I doubt if it will have much impact beyond that.
Radical changes at the top will not have the slightest effect on
tackling the very real problems in individual establishments around the
country, and this is where the crux of the problem lies. Introducing
quality control into tourism is very difficult due to the fragmented
nature of the industry with its many independent operators.
How do you convince the many thousands of individual accommodation
providers, retailers etc that what they are providing is crap, and
secondly how do you help them to improve their acts when many of them
are teetering on the edge of financial disaster, particularly the small
hotels which you single out for special criticism?
Starved of visitors and capital, operating on a very short season and
with a history of frequent changes of ownership, they are a recipe for
disaster and I know because I own one.
I don't have any brilliant solutions either, short of massive
Government funding for capital improvements and the introduction of
compulsory grading of establishments and training for managements and
staff, but that is pie in the sky. The present continuing dispute
between STB and Highlands and Islands Enterprise over ''who funds what''
in the Highland area does not augur well for the future.
We will probably have to muddle on with Welcome Host and the gradual
spread of STB's quality scheme.
May I suggest that if Ms Crawshaw can be persuaded to return to
Scotland, she arms herself with the relevant area tourist board
accommodation guides and that she selects small establishments in the
Highly Commended bracket which will guarantee her the quality which she
rightly expects and at a reasonable price.
Should she come to Kintyre I will cheerfully greet her, carry her bags
up to a beautifully furnished en-suite room, feed her on the best of
local produce with not a battered fish or chip in sight, pour her a dram
in front of a roaring fire and entertain her with as much local and
Scottish history as she requires until she retires to her king-sized
bed, -- but I will not provide her with a telephone in her room. BT have
just quoted me over #5000 for installing four telephones! This equals
the cost of putting in two en-suite bathrooms and the bathrooms won.
It can be done; quality can be provided, but how do you convince the
others and how do you propose to finance it?

AS A Scot, I was entertained, intrigued and embarrassed by Jill
Crawshaw's Brave Heart Tour of Scotland featured this week. (I know it
was only a long weekend in Inverness and Fort William, but it was
representative of some of the worst aspects of tourism in this country
and of missed opportunities.)
For the past 10 seasons, I have been taking tourists to the Republic
of Ireland, as coach-driver and courier, and am impressed by the way in
which that wee country -- with a population of only three and a half
million -- has not only come to terms with tourism, but has turned it
into a thriving industry worth over #2 billion last year, attracting
more foreign tourists than it has citizens. In the past five years the
number of foreign tourists coming to Scotland has declined.
The reasons for their success are outwardly simple, but are the result
of coming to terms with the fact that tourists are big business and do
expect the facilities which are commonplace in their own countries.
Training schemes with a direct bearing on the hotel and tourist
industry abound. Youngsters, even in school, are taught the importance
of giving a high standard of service and the value of giving this with a
friendly greeting and a smile.
The ''laziness'' of the Irish is as much a myth as the ''meanness'' of
the Scots; they will spend time poring over timetables with a tourist --
or just pass the time of day at length -- even if it means staying
behind to complete their work.
But, perhaps more significantly, the Irish government has introduced
the ''Business Expansion Scheme'' whereby hoteliers and operators of
tourist attractions can obtain grants to expand, upgrade or refurbish
their facilities using the same EC regional aid that we seem to plough
into ''advance factories'' (how many are empty in your area?). This has
had the effect of a greatly increasing the number of mid-range price
hotel beds that we lack in Scotland.
I have stayed in many an Irish hotel where the original building has
been retained for public rooms and a new block of bedrooms, with all
modern facilities, has been added, combining an admirable balance of
character and amenities. Scottish hoteliers tell me how envious they are
of this scheme and how much they could improve with access to these
funds without having to charge exorbitant rates to pay for the
improvements.
All this provides jobs, including the building trade. Mostly seasonal
jobs, I admit, but a seasonal job is better than no job (I should know,
as I am only seasonally employed).
You are critical of the Scottish Tourist Board in your editorial but,
given access to regional aid for distribution for hotel upgrading, they
could play a positive role in expanding tourism in this country. I am
not advocating new funds, rather a redistribution of monies which has
been proved to work across the Irish Sea.
We all know the potential value to Scotland of tourism, but are
reluctant to acknowledge it by giving such a high standard of service,
warmth of welcome and value for money that visitors will not even be
aware of the weather! Folks from sundrenched countries often tell me how
much they enjoy the ''soft'' weather of these islands and, anyway, have
not come here to do the sunbathing they can do almost every day of the
year at home. They want the scenery and the history which we have in
abundance.
Let us forget or preoccupation with our weather, rekindle the spirit
of ''Highland hospitality'' and come to terms with the fact that tourism
is important to Scotland. Investment in mid-range hotels is not only a
possibility but a necessity. Tourism is the fastest-growing industry
worldwide. Don't let us miss the bus (or the plane, or the boat).
Just an afterthought. Perhaps you could commission Jill Crawshaw to
spend a long weekend in Ireland for comparison. I know an excellent
mid-range hotel straight across the Liffey from 65 acres of Guinness
Brewery, but that's another story!

RADIO Four's new series Booked!, presented by Barnsley poet Ian
McMillan, calls itself a literary panel game but delivers a lot more
than that suggests. Roger McGough pairs up with the columnist Miles
Kington and in the opposing team are Dillie Kean (of Fascinating Aida)
and stand-up comic Mark Thomas.
Their comic rewritings of known texts were brilliant. McGough's
version of Chaucer, in his (Glen) Miller's Tale, was clever beyond
spoof, and through its wit became a quite moving little poem using song
titles to evoke the war years, while Mark Thomas delivered a delicious,
rolling Under Milk Wood. I bet Dylan Thomas would have bought him a
drink for it.
When asked to dramatise the meeting of unlikely literary characters,
Dillie Kean cast herself as the lascivious Madame de Merteuil from Les
Liasons Dangereuses attempting to corrupt Adam in an innocent Eden.
Kington's Adam was a straight suburban non-sexual Englishman, whose God,
''the absentee landlord'', forbade him to eat of the apple, which was
French and stole the livelihood of Kentish farmers.
When she mentioned his trouser snake (in a wonderfully camp accent --
like the Eurotrash boys turned aristo-femme) he thought she meant the
serpent who kept sidling up to Eve with recipes for apple pie and spare
ribs.
So we are not put off by the ''literary'' label as being overly solemn
or inaccessibly clever, the publicity machine goes crazy with its
overuse of the word ''irreverent'' and its equivalents. The line being
that the panellists ''audaciously'' are ''stretching literary reverence
to its limits'' -- as if they were risking great offence to an audience
of biblio-thumping literary Wee Frees. The truth is, of course, that
pastiche and parody and comic reversal have always been part of the
picture. Anyway, keep Tuesday lunchtimes free and enjoy.
That reverence can carry far more artistic dangers than its opposite
was proven in Michael Maloney's ubiquitous reading of Keats this week.
Actually, it was more recitation than reading, and it was awful. The
kind of thing that puts people off poetry, which was a shame because he
is normally a (in the best sense) sensitive and impressive actor, but
because he went for the beauty rather than the truth of the poems, he
ended up sounding as if he was speaking full of awe into a Grecian Urn.
There is enough fruit and mellifluousness in the verse -- the last thing
it needs is to be read with actorish fruitiness.
He was, in both senses, all over the place in a series of programmes
marking the poet's bi-centenary. To be fair, in Marina Warner's essay
(Reading Keats, R4) which he fronted with La Belle Dame Sans Merci, the
tone was slightly less jarring, perhaps because of the otherworldly
subject of the poem. Warner made the point that it was unusual for Keats
to be so vague -- the poem does not contain those visually exact words
we find elsewhere -- so with less sensual specificity there was perhaps
less for him to overdo.
Economical and illuminating as she always is, Warner took us through
the chronological stages of her own response to La Belle Dame. She spoke
first of how its distanced, dreamy erotic world spoke directly to her
adolescent self.
While the realm of fairies and elves and knights connected her back to
childhood, there was nothing cosy about this enchantress, but at the
same time La Dame's sexuality was safely unreal. She recalled that her
whole class at convent school enjoyed the notion of nuns teaching this
swooningly sexy stuff for its very medievalism was seen as an idyllic
pre-Protestant world.
Her mature self (mature in the French sense of ''ripe'', she
laughingly qualified) unpicks her teenage romantic identification as she
realises that the symbolic idealisation of womanhood as muse can operate
as a mechanism to keep the female outside the ambience of social and
human life.
Ultimately, however, she beautifully appraises this poem as one whose
existential power transcends the sexual-political, the medievalising and
the femme fatale stuff. La Belle Dame Sans Merci is about someone ''who
feels themselves growing cold''. The strongest figure is the poet about
to die -- Keats himself -- who felt, when living, that he was leading a
posthumous life.

INDIGO Time has a great chance to land Doncaster's November Handicap
on only his fifth racecourse appearance.
Paul Cole's three-year-old was running on at the finish at Newmarket
in September and then went to Ascot, where he cruised past 14 rivals to
win cosily.
Although inexperienced, he can handle big fields and should have made
the necessary improvement to score here.
Proton looks exposed and Snow Princess may not be up to this task, but
Time For Action has more class than his form figures might suggest, and
he looks likely to be there at the shake-up.
John Dunlop has had a superlative season and can add another Listed
race to his haul with Labibeh in the Serlby Stakes. This progressive
filly began the year on the lower handicap rungs but recently edged out
Saxon Maid in a Group 3 event.
Slightly unlucky in her last outing, she is preferred to her rivals,
some of whom have looked a bit jaded.
Only three of the field for the Tote Silver Trophy at Chepstow have
been out this jump season. The best performer among them was Squire
Silk, who notched up a commanding victory at Newbury in a faster time
than Balanak on the same card.
However, last season he was turned over when tried against top company
and the vote goes instead to Silver Wedge, who won first time out last
year and went on to be second in the Triumph Hurdle.
He should start fit after two respectable runs in valuable flat races.
Kibreet has the class to defy top weight in the opening chase and
should once again start his season with a win.
Bas de Laine missed last season and ran really well after such a long
absence to finish second in the Charisma Gold Cup. He should have come
on for the run and it may pay to back him to upset the claims of
Brackenfield in the Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton.
* JOCKEY Warren Marston has been stood down for seven days following a
fall from Ferrufino in the novices' hurdle at Uttoxeter yesterday.
Although he was able to walk back to the weighing room unaided and
reported that he felt fine, a later examination by the course doctor
revealed that he had suffered mild concussion.

BY the looks of things, the lucky charms of that Terry Christie duffel
coat which took Stenhousemuir on such a fine Scottish Cup run last
season will need to be in overdrive tomorrow when they take on Dundee
United in the Challenge Cup final at McDiarmid Park, writes Hugh
McKinlay.
''The coat will be there and we're in for one hell of a game,'' he
said of his side's first final in their 111-year history. He confirmed
that George McGeachie would be back in defence, but that was before he
knew about the return to Tannadice yesterday of Ray McKinnon in a
#200,000 deal with Aberdeen.
The 25-year-old midfielder, who will find great changes at United
since he left for Nottingham Forest in 1992, will go straight into a
side which went top of the first division with a midweek win over
Clydebank.
Manager Billy Kirkwood said yesterday: ''A lot of new players have
arrived here recently. It is the ideal time for Ray to kick-start his
career.''
It was Kirkwood's ninth signing since taking over at United, and that
could rise to 10 by lunch-time today with talks going on last night.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
ONE of the Highland League's top youngsters is out in the cold after a
contract wrangle with his club.
Peterhead's former Scottish juvenile international Mike Smart was
transfer-listed after negotiations for personal terms broke down. No-one
has bid for Smart and manager Dave Watson stopped monthly deals several
weeks ago.
Now Watson has vowed his #5500 signing from Buckie Thistle will not
get another game until his attitude changes.
Watson said: ''As far as I'm concerned, he's got to change his ideas.
He's turned up for only two or three training sessions lately, and he
seems to be happy enough to be out of football.''
Peterhead travelled up last night for what could prove a troublesome
match at Wick Academy. The Caithness men went through October unbeaten
and Watson reckons the expense of overnight accommodation will be
justified if they win and stay on Huntly's tails. The champions face
unpredictable youngers Clach, while second-placed Keith are at home to
Elgin.

SECOND/THIRD
DIVISIONS
TRANSFER activity dominated clubs in the second and third divisions
yesterday as clubs attempted to strengthen their squads.
Many of the managers felt it was the time of the year when moves had
to be made. However, Forfar manager Tommy Campbell was unable to talk
midfielder Marcus Dailly -- brother of Dundee United's Christian -- to
move from Dundee.
Instead, Campbell will travel with an unchanged squad to meet Queen of
the South, whose manager, Billy McLaren, is contemplating an offer for
striker Martin Scott of Albion Rovers.
Stranraer were in signing talks last night with striker Steve Kerrigan
of Clydebank, and if successful, he will play against leaders East fife.
Manager Alex McAnespie said: ''I have watched Steve a few times, but I
was convinced to go for him when we played Clydebank in a reserve match
this week.''
Montrose were successful when they signed striker Alan Kennedy from
Arbroath. He goes in against Clyde, who wait for a fitness check on the
injured Charlie Nicholas.
Ayr United managerGordon Dalziel, who also is looking around, has to
stick with his present squad against Stirling Albion at Somerset Park.
It was the same story in the third division, where Albion Rovers
signed the former Rangers and Hamilton forward Ronnie Yule and will
include him against Ross County.
Michael Watters, who left Hamilton for Malta, has returned to Scotland
and will be the trialist fielded by Arbroath as they visit Caledonian
Thistle.
Leaders Livingston will want to wipe out the memory of last week's
first league defeat when they visit Alloa.

FIRST DIVISION:
MORTON started the ball rolling by signing Marko Rajamaki and Janne
Lindberg; St Mirren thought it was a good idea to bring full back Janne
Makela over for a trial period until he lasted only 32 minutes before
taking a ligament injury that saw him on a return flight home; and now
Dunfermline have stepped into the fray.
Finland, in Scotland's group, might have no chance in the European
Championship, but their international players certainly have caused a
stir, particularly in the first division over here.
Kari Rissannen, a 29-year-old central defender who has 14 caps, has
arrived at East End Park for a two-week trial, and he could be at least
on the bench for the former league leaders in their home match against
St Mirren today.
Manager Bert Paton said: ''He certainly has plenty of experience, and
the reason the trial period is so short is that Kari must return home in
time for the match against Russia on November 14.''
Dunfermline's recent shaky period has in many ways been caused by
pressure on the defence because of a shortage of strikers through
injury. If Rissannen makes a sufficient impression in his short time in
Scotland, he could bolster skipper Norrie McCathie and Andy Tod in the
middle. And with Colin Miller from Hearts also arriving in a
deal for Paul Smith, Paton has interesting options for the match
against Saints. Although he has lost Ivo den Biemen, who was sent off at
Tannadice last week, winger Allan Moore returns after injury, and
full-back Marc Millar is back after suspension.
St Mirren will field the side who drew at Perth last week, but manager
Jimmy Bone was coy as to whether or not he would include striker Barry
Lavety for the first time since his drugs problem. Lavety hit a hat
trick in the reserves in midweek. Stuart Taylor is doubtful with a knee
knock.
Meanwhile, the on-off transfer saga of Morton's Derek McInnes is
turning into a soap opera -- so much so that manager Allan McGraw said
yesterday: ''Rangers said they would contact me, but so far they have
not. Derek is just going to have to get on with what he is paid for --
being our player -- and that means sorting himself out and playing
against Airdrie at Cappielow if Rangers don't come in by tomorrow.''
Everyone else is fit, while Airdrie's only doubt is defender Paul Jack
who is still struggling to shake off an injury.
Dundee, with neighbours and new leaders United preparing for
tomorrow's Challenge Cup final against Stenhousemuir at McDiarmid Park,
are determined to win against Hamilton Accies at Firhill. The one
cautious note is that Accies, despite being bottom of the league, took a
couple of points from the Dens men earlier in the season, and manager
Jim Duffy does not want a repeat.
Paul Tosh is missing injured, but central defender Neil Duffy returns.
Hamilton, meanwhile, signed 25-year-old Mike Geraghty from East
Stirlingshire in a #25,000 deal yesterday in a bid to solve their
striking problems since the departures of Peter Duffield, Paul Chalmers,
and Derek McGill. Manager Iain Munro is also boosted by the return of
Paul Hartley and Scott McCulloch.
Dumbarton are finding life tough in the first division, and they will
be without Martin Melvin and the suspended Hugh Burns for the visit of
St Johnstone to Boghead. Paul Martin, however, is back after injury.
Saints, who may see defender Kevin McGeowne back after a six-week
injury, have been warned by assistant manager John Blackley that a
victory is ''essential.'' He said: ''We need a good run to take
advantage of the three points for a victory. It would make all the
difference.''

IN light of recent circumstances, it was a relief to see that neither
Tommy Burns, of Celtic, nor Rangers' Walter Smith was wearing a black
arm band. The self-analysis has to be tempered when you are preparing to
send out teams for serious domestic duty the following day.
The disappointment at midweek defeats in Europe, however, was easy to
detect, probably more severe in the Ibrox instance, as they had
harboured hopes of making their mark in the Champions' League.
And yesterday it came to light the Rangers were delivered another body
blow with the news that defender Stephen Wright will be out of action
for the rest of the season. He was carried off during the Juventus match
and has been diagnosed as having severed knee ligaments.
Celtic, as Burns, pointed out, had no serious belief that they were
embryo European winners this season, rather a team hoping for the bonus
of as good run in the continental theatre.
Smith, on the other hand, had set out with genuine European ambitions
this season, and his disappointment after the 4-0 defeat by Juventus
will be immense. He did his best to keep it hidden as he talked of his
team to meet Falkirk at Ibrox today, a team that will almost certainly
not include Paul Gascoigne, who has a recurrence of a thigh strain.
There was a curious panto, a kind of Gazzamime, at the stadium
yesterday when the great man, according to his PR representatives, was
to hold court as he was presented with a new Japanese car.
The Fourth Estate duly turned up but was told that Paul was not now
prepared to give us his pearls of wisdom. It seemed that he had been
assailed as he arrived at the ground by a couple of reporters wishing to
ask questions about his personal life, and decided he would do without
any further interview.
Photographers, however, were welcome, but it would be surprising if
any of their pictures were eagerly sought by the respective editors.
There was also a separate Gazza lookalike stunt, even if the imitators
were the only ones with blond hair.
It seemed a strange piece of timing, engaging in ''promo'' events
after midweek depression when neither Gascoigne nor his mates was the
flavour of the month, even among Rangers fans.
And it does not look as if Gascoigne will get the chance to help
please the Ibrox crowd today. Richard Gough also is a doubtful starter
after having suffered from a kick on a knee on Wednesday, while Andy
Goram is out for 10 days or so with a hip injury.
Alex Cleland, Gordon Durie, and Alan McLaren are available again,
however, and Smith has indicated that all concentration must be on
league matches for the next few weeks.
''We find ourselves in the same situation as we did when we came back
from Turin a couple of weeks ago, but I hope we can show the same
determination to get a result as we did then against Hearts,'' said
Smith. ''We must not let the European disappointment interfere with our
league aims.''
Burns said that he had had ''a good chat'' with his players,
discussing various aspects of the 3-0 defeat by Paris St Germain. ''We
now have got to get ready for the domestic games,'' said the manager.
''The league is our No.1 priority and the players are fully aware of
that. Our aim is to be the best in Scotland and we are not kidding
ourselves we are ready to be European champions yet.''
Burns has no fresh injury worries, other than Rudi Vata, who has a
shoulder injury and looks an unlikely starter. Overall, Burns is pleased
with the progress of his team and will ask only that they continue
moving upwards in the graph against Motherwell at Fir Park.
As Celtic have not beaten Alex McLeish's team since Burns became their
manager, there is immediate room for improvement.
McLeish wants his players to forget about Celtic's midweek problems
and in fact, has been busy detailing their strong points. He will bring
back striker Dougie Arnott, rested on the bench last week because of a
niggling injury. ''Dougie seems to score regularly against Celtic,''
said McLeish.
Partick Thistle, who play Hearts in the capital, wait to check on flu
victims Steve Pittman and Tommy Turner, but manager Murdo MacLeod could
have Wayne Foster available again.
The most intriguing game, and maybe most exciting, of the day is at
Pittodrie, where Aberdeen will try to shake off the disappointment of
last week's defeat at Parkhead against Hibs, who are three points ahead
of them in third place.
Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken has set his players the target of maximum
points from this game and the three that follow as the club heads for
the Coca-Cola Cup final.
''That will be difficult in such a very competitive league,'' said
Aitken. ''But we have the incentive of going above Hibs if we beat them.
It does not surprise me that Hibs are up there challenging. They are a
good, strong team who have been scoring goals.''
Raith Rovers, beaten but unbowed by Bayern Munich, will need to get
their concentration right if they are to keep Kilmarnock in check at
Rugby Park.

THE return of Jim Jefferies to Tynecastle was greeted with great
euphoria by supporters of the Edinburgh club, but things have turned a
little sour since, with Hearts now in a strong position in the premier
division -- that of holding up the rest.
With this in mind Jefferies has signed another two foreigners, Italian
defender Pasquale Bruno and Swedish striker Hans Eskilsson, in a bid to
stop the rot, and both will be considered for the game with Partick
Thistle today.
The 33-year-old Italian, who had a big reputation as being
uncompromising as well as a fine player, was in the Juventus side that
won the 1990 UEFA Cup.
With Dave McPherson doubtful this afternoon, he could well be given
his chance. Jefferies awaits a meeting this morning between Colin Miller
and Dunfermline which would see Fifer Paul Smith moving to Tynecastle in
a swop deal.
Doubtful are Scott Leitch, Brian Hamilton, and Neil Poynton but Gary
Mackay will be back.

IT is dark and cold in the shed at the bottom of John O'Donovan's
garden in Stonehaven, but as the blurred wheels of the turbo training
bike, mounted on its special stand, whir mesmerically, enough heat and
energy is generated to carry one to Mexico.
That is where, in the resort of Cancun, the world duathlon and
triathlon championships are being contested in the coming days.
O'Donovan, Scottish national triathlon coach, but also a competitor,
has used the garden shed to prepare himself and team-mate Ginny Pollard.
It takes little grilling to reveal what a special breed are the
growing numbers -- 500 in membership of the Scottish Triathlon
Association -- who tackle these endurance feats.
O'Donovan, the STA's founding father and an oil company drilling
engineer by profession, and Pollard, a maths teacher, have competed for
Scotland in several sports.
The 46-year-old Cork-born O'Donovan, having long since abandoned Eire
allegiance, has represented his adopted country in canoeing, cycling,
triathlon, and duathlon. He was in the 1986 Commonwealth canoe
championships, and only when world pursuit champion Graeme Obree came on
the scene did O'Donovan surrender the Scottish 25-mile time trial
cycling record.
Eighth in the world triathlon last year, he is hopeful of doing better
''possibly among the medals'' in tomorrow's duathlon, which he will be
attempting for the first time at world level.
''I'm a poor swimmer,'' he confessed. ''Whenever I get out of the
water I'm miles behind, and have to make it up on the bike. But the
duathlon (10,000 metres run, 40 kilometre bike ride, and concluding
5000m run) is right up my street.
''Having been a canoeist, I knew one used basically the same muscle
groups for swimming. I thought I would take to it easily, but I soon
learned it doesn't work like that.''
Nevertheless, he plans to tackle the hardest triathlon of all -- the
Hawaii Ironman -- next year: 2.4-mile swim, 112 miles on the bike,
concluding with a full marathon run.
The 35-year-old Pollard did sprint and marathon canoe races in the
1986 Commonwealth event, and has also raced cross-country for Scotland.
She is contesting only today's duathlon along with Fiona Lothian, the
former British champion, who last year made her Scottish cross-country
debut.
Also in the duathlon is East Kilbride's Raymond Johnston, the former
double world champion, whose defies bad weather by training in car
parks, or even running up and down ladders -- he is a window cleaner.
Wearing his coach's hat, O'Donovan reckons St Andrews student Eleanor
Reid may prove the surprise Scot when she does the triathlon next
weekend.
O'Donovan also tackles the triathlon in which he will line up with
Aboyne's Jack Maitland, whose exotic credentials as a former winner of
the Mount Everest marathon, Mount Cameroon Race (an active volcano), and
Anapurna triathlon make previous domestic titles -- Scottish and British
hill-running champion, and Scottish triathlon victor -- seem almost
down-to-earth by comparison.
Maitland is accustomed to outrageous risks, but looks forward to the
sea swim and spectators at Cancun as a far less forbidding prospect than
the Himalayan event at Anapurna, a challenge waged on occasion under
military guard in the face of riots.
When he won, the opening leg involved a 3000m swim in a loch whose
waters were so murky and diphtheria-infected as almost to blur the twin
peaks of Annapurna and Macchu Pachare which tower above it. Competitors
were warned to drink only official watering stations.
For health reasons? ''No,'' explains Maitland, detailing how one
runner had dipped into a water-seller's stall and was stoned by locals.

Gillian Barton has been named Regional Personal Finance Journalist of
the Year. The judges of the awards, which are sponsored by the Bradford
and Bingley Building Society, were particularly impressed by ''her clear
writing style which offered common sense guidance to readers''.
CANNY investors are busy spotting new ways of making money when giant
financial organisations get together. The trick of investing a few
hundred pounds in as many building societies as you can afford in the
hope of winning bonus payments and free shares is well known. Indeed, it
has prompted several societies to raise the minimum savers need to open
an account.
Now the game of trying to spot the next takeover target, marriage of
convenience or stockmarket flotation is spreading into the world of life
insurance.
News that the giant Norwich Union life insurer is seriously
considering ditching its mutual status in favour of becoming a publicly
quoted company has given investors a potential new source of windfall
gains. Traders in secondhand life insurance policies say they've been
inundated with requests for Norwich Union plans by investors hoping to
share in the bonuses that could be paid to members if and when it floats
on the stockmarket.
Norwich Union confirms that anyone buying a secondhand policy now
would become a member and be eligible for any future payouts. However, a
spokesman says: ''It's very early days. We have seen all sorts of
speculative figures bandied about -- that members could get as little as
#20 right up to #1200 -- but absolutely nothing has been decided.''
If Norwich Union does pay it will be following in the footsteps of
General Accident, set to take over Provident Mutual on January 1.
Provident Mutual policyholders are due to vote on the deal next week
and, if it goes ahead, they can look forward to sharing #25m of special
bonuses.
A typical #30-a-month 25-year endowment taken out in 1985 might
attract a bonus of #75, for instance, rising to #100 for a personal
pension plan with a value of #8000. These amounts won't be cash
payments, but will be included in the bonuses added to with-profits
policies, boosting their growth in the long run.
If a Norwich Union flotation does take place it is unlikely to be
before 1997, but that hasn't stopped investors taking a gamble on
possible bonuses by buying secondhand life insurance policies now.
Christopher Dobie, chief executive of Beale Dobie, a major trader in
secondhand policies, says: ''We had #350,000 of Norwich Union policies
on our books on Monday and by Tuesday we only had #40,000 left.''
Anyone starting a new Norwich Union policy should also count as a
member for future bonuses, but it would, of course, be silly to commit
yourself to long-term premium payments just for the chance of a possible
windfall gain. The lure of extra bonuses certainly makes investing in a
secondhand life policy look more attractive though.
Too many policyholders simply surrender policies for a fraction of
their true value if they run into financial difficulties, often
following marriage breakdown or unemployment. But they can often get
back 12% to 15% more than the surrender value -- and sometimes much more
-- by selling their policy on to another investor prepared to pay a lump
sum and the regular premiums in return for a substantial lump sum when
it matures.
If more insurance companies told policyholders about the secondhand
policy market an estimated 1000 people a week could be, on average,
#1000 better off by selling rather than surrendering their insurance.
There are around 20 companies -- called market-makers -- which buy up
unwanted policies and sell them on to interested investors, but rather
than contact them all for the best price, individuals, as well as their
legal or financial advisers, find it easier to use firms such as
Lenzie-based Scottish Endowment Consultants.
''We're known as trawlers,'' says the firm's Alasdair Lightbody.
''When someone approaches us with a policy to sell we can fax all the
market-makers simultaneously. Because the market-makers know we are
dealing with all their competitors we can usually get a better price
than individuals or advisers who are just contacting a handful of the
firms.''
Anyone interested in investing in secondhand policies -- often those
within a few years of retirement -- can also get a stake in the market
through one of the specialist investment funds run by Kleinwort and BZW
who buy them up. The value of these funds could receive a boost from
special bonuses too if, as expected, the trend for life insurance
companies to merge or convert into publicly quoted companies continues.

TONY Hand, Britain's top striker, aims to clip the wings of Fife
Flyers when he lines up for Sheffield Steelers in a Benson &amp; Hedges Cup
semi-final.
Hand, born in Edinburgh, has scored 16 goals in five league games for
the English side, who are still upset after last Saturday's 5-3
first-leg defeat in Kirkcaldy.
''There is no way we can play that badly again,'' said Hand, the first
British player drafted by a NHL club. ''All credit to Fife, they dug in,
worked hard, and played really well -- but we were awful.
''That's the worst we have played all season and it won't happen
again.''
Hand is keen to take a winners' medal. ''I see no reason why we can't
make the final,'' he said. ''Two goals is nothing and with our fans
behind us I'll be really surprised if we don't get through.''
American goaltender Wayne Cowley, a former NHL player, is standing by
to make his deubt, while Flyers will have newly-reclassified Doug
Marsden in their squad, the ex-Paisley Pirate having recovered from a
jaw injury. Player-coach Mark Morrison also could ice Finnish defenceman
Marku Makki on-loan from Blackburn Hawks.
''We don't mind being written off,'' said Morrison, ''we're going to
win and have a two-goal lead to get us rolling.''

MANCHESTER, with no other candidate in the ring, was formally adopted
yesterday as hosts for the Commonwealth Games in 2002.
The city was approved unanimously at the Commonwealth Games Federation
meeting in Bermuda, but only after New Zealand successfully led a revolt
involving 40 countries demanding the reinstatement of shooting, excluded
on cost grounds.
The decision brings the Friendly Games to England for the first time
-- though they have twice been held in Edinburgh (1970 and '86), and in
Cardiff (1958). Marking the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations, they
will cost #56m to stage.
Organisers say they will break even and could possibly make a slight
profit through sponsorship and TV rights.
The decision will revive debate on whether Manchester or Wembley
should be the venue for the new national stadium, to be built with the
help of lottery money. Edinburgh, denied any Central Government backing
for the ill-fated 1986 event which lost millions after being subjected
to a Robert Maxwell rescue package, will watch with interest to see how
much help Manchester receives.
Bid chairman Sir Robert Scott, who twice failed to land the Olympics,
said: ''Manchester never took its eyes off the finishing line and now
the city can plan with confidence for the golden Games. I know they will
hold the most successful Games ever.''
Civic leaders say the decision should provide 4000 permanent jobs and
around #100m investment to the area.

THE chief executive of the National Farmers Union of Scotland, Tom
Brady, has been criticised by farming leaders in Aberdeen and
Kincardine, who claim that the ''hierarchy'' in Edinburgh has been
trying to tell the area executive in Aberdeen and Kincardine how it
should conduct its business.
In a debate at the Aberdeen and Kincardine area executive, prompted by
the resignation of area NFUS secretary Michael Dalton, Dunecht Farms
manager Jim Arbuckle was applauded when he said the area would not stand
for meddling by headquarters.
Mr Arbuckle said that chief executive Tom Brady had demanded that Mr
Dalton should moderate the tone of resolutions sent down from the area.
A clarification of the area secretary's status was vital for Mr Dalton's
successor, John Miskelly, said Mr Arbuckle.
''It is important that resolutions from this area are forwarded as we
intend -- if they upset HQ committees and staff, so be it,'' he added.
''It is an intolerable intrusion into the affairs of this executive for
our secretary to be asked to alter the thrust of our resolutions. They
should not be interfered with in any way.''
Mr Brady dismissed as ''absurd'' the allegation that headquarters
personnel sought to tell the Aberdeen and Kincardine area executive how
to conduct its business.
He added: ''I am not prepared to discuss in public matters concerning
NFU employees. At a recent private meeting with senior Aberdeen and
Kincardine representatives, full agreement was reached that headquarters
had acted properly.''
Area delegates at the executive meeting in Inverurie were also
critical of the lack of progress in drawing up a business plan for the
NFUS. The recent issue of a three-page document of broad outlines was
disappointing and less than adequate, they said.
Mr Arbuckle also criticised NFUS president John Ross's assertion at
national council this week that the union could not be run simply as a
commercial organisation with a business plan.
''That is an incredible statement from an organisation that is
strapped for cash,'' he said. ''Our own area, with what we know is a
highly successful structure, is finding it difficult -- and headquarters
has been ducking the funding issue for years. A business plan would
force this issue to be addressed.''
Mr Don and Mr Arbuckle clashed, however, on the NFUS decision to
resign from Rural Forum after a disagreement over a forum paper on
agricultural subsidies which the forum had wrongly presented as being
supported by the union.
Mr Arbuckle argued that the union would have got better publicity by
issuing a disclaimer along with its reasons.
In a response to these criticisms, Mr Brady said that next week he
would publish a full explanation of the work which had been done on the
formation of a business plan in line with the aims and objectives agreed
by recent council meetings.
He would also make public all of the considerations which led NFU
leaders to resign from Rural Forum. He pointed out that the decision to
resign had been ratified by the council on two occasions.

JOHN Crawley was still waiting for his first England century last
night as the weather handed him another test of patience. Crawley missed
out on a deserved hundred in Soweto a week ago when he was out for 85.
Yesterday, the 24-year-old Lancashire player was left undefeated on
his overnight 87 as rain prevented a ball from being bowled at Buffalo
Park. With England planning to bat on for a couple of hours or so today
to add to their 218 for four, Crawley should get the chance to reach
three figures against Border.
Despite occupying the No.3 spot during the final Test of last summer's
series against West Indies at The Oval -- and making a half-century --
Crawley started this tour as No.7 in the batting order. Since only six
will line-up to face Allan Donald and co in Pretoria on November 16, he
is not only forcing Mark Ramprakash to fight hard to stay ahead, but
also making himself a viable alternative to the currently out-of-form
Robin Smith.
Meanwhile, skipper Nasser Hussain led from the front as England A
chalked up their second successive tour victory with a seven-run defeat
of the Pakistan Cricket Board XI in Thatta, east of Karachi, yesterday.
Hussain's innings of 64 was the backbone of England's 168 off 44.3
overs, the match being reduced from 50 to 45 overs-per-side after a
heavy overnight dew delayed the start of play at the newly-opened Makli
Cricket Ground. Even that seemingly modest total was beyond the scope of
the Pakistani side, who were bowled out for 161 with eight balls
remaining.
Middlesex's Jason Pooley was out in the fourth over for just one, but
Yorkshire opener Andrew McGrath and Hussain repaired the damage with a
second-wicket stand of 71 in 96 minutes.
Pakistani Test bowler Kabir Khan took the last four English wickets to
finish with four for 20. With prolific batsmen Ghulam Ali, Ejaz Ahmed
Jnr, Mahmood Hamid and Zafar Iqbal in their line-up, the PCB side looked
favourites to take victory.
But only opener Mohammad Ramzan, who top-scored with 34, seemed to
have the stomach for the fight, with Ed Gittens of Sussex and
Yorkshire's Richard Stemp each taking a couple of wickets. Scores:
England A 168 (N Hussain 64, Kabir Khan 4-20), Pakistan Cricket Board
XI 161. England A beat Pakistan Cricket Board XI by 7 runs. At Thatta.
England 218 for four (J P Crawley 87 n.o., M R Ramprakash 70.) v
Border. No play -- rain. At East London.
* FORMER Pakistan captain Salim Malik, the batsman at the centre of a
bribery scandal, lasted just nine balls for seven runs on his return to
the crease yesterday after an eight-month exile from cricket.
Pakistan laboured in their four-day tour match at Adelaide Oval
against South Australia. At close of play on the second day, the
tourists were 199 for five in reply to South Australia's 392 for eight
declared.

casual observer to be a rather dull area lacking the excitement of, say,
a poorly performing but asset-rich company which cries out to be broken
up or one with few assets but which is rumoured to be on the brink of
exciting developments in medicine or computing.
Up steps Robin Angus of NatWest Securities, however, to say: ''It
ain't necessarily so''. . . or words to that effect. In his annual
review of the trust sector, Mr Angus indicates it is ripe for bids and
says: ''I feel excited about it in a way I have not done for years.''
The sector ''is now so diverse that it is brimming over with
opportunities''.
The message seems to be that there are so many trusts the market
cannot keep a proper eye on them all, and if you look hard enough you
will find high discounts which can signal and recognise the values or
perhaps, as of old, a poorly performing management.
So after the spate of new issues which took investors into all sorts
of adventurous areas, he believes the trust sector is about to see a
different sort of corporate activity. Some might call it raids on the
assets. He talks of ''restructurings, mergers, and bids within the
sector itself''.
This sort of activity will be the result of ''inefficiency''. He
comments: ''There is far more of it in the trust sector than there used
to be. The sector gets more inefficient with every month that passes and
with every new issue that appears. Trust securities can sell at very
high discounts because they have simply been overlooked or have not been
understood properly.''
He points out that there are now 332 investment trust companies, only
101 of which existed in their present form 10 years ago. But even
ignoring conventional debentures and Preference shares, the thing has
got so complicated that these 332 companies offer 634 different
securities. Among these are 21 conventional income shares and 12 annuity
income shares, 33 capital shares and 27 highly geared Ordinary shares
together with 42 zero preference shares and 165 warrants.
It all, he says, adds up to inefficiency, which is one of his
favourite words in investment because, ''where there is inefficiency
there is opportunity''. If he is correct in his analysis, investors and
trust managers should now be trawling through the sector examining
discounts and performance ratings with a view to making things more
exciting.
Meanwhile, if you go along with the view held by NatWest, Merrill
Lynch and others that the US is okay, and also agree with NatWest that
one should have a currency-hedged exposure to Japan, his message is: buy
Dunedin Worldwide, Kleinwort Overseas and Fleming Overseas. On a
12-month view their prices could rise 17% or so.
British Empire Securities is the subject of a separate buy note from
NatWest which believes a discount of around 10% at 92p makes it
''significantly undervalued''. The absorption of Selective Assets, it
comments, gives manager John Walton a bigger fund -- it now totals
around #250m -- to manage at a time when ''he sees many good
opportunities for undervalued assets investment management''.
This search for undervalued assets has led some to view British Empire
Securities as a trust of trusts, but while it finds these situations
among investment trusts it also looks for under-rated assets in
property, hotels, energy, metals, commodities, asset-related media and
leisure stocks and in emerging markets.
While the US and Japan seem to be NatWest's nap selections, Europe is
still in favour. The broker particularly likes Norway, France and Italy.
It points to Fidelity European Values which has 21% of its assets in
Norway, a market where the forecast is for a 9% gain in sterling terms
over the next 12 months, almost twice what the UK is predicted to
produce.
For France it suggests Paribas French where a discount of 15% ''could
narrow sharply'' if investors suddenly took a fancy to to the country.
And for Italy it says Schroder Mediterranean is the one to go for. This
trust is also sizeable in France with smaller stakes in Greece, Portugal
and Turkey.
In the venture capital area, NatWest spotlights Mercury Grosvenor,
commenting: ''There is a lot of strength and investment muscle behind it
now'' and predicting ''expect to see its discount narrow from its
present 21%.''
Mr Angus promises to do his best to unravel the mysteries of RIT
Capital Partners, one of the trusts he sees as out of line. He comments:
''Any big stock which has 37% of its assets in North America merits
investigation'' and notes that it stands on a discount of nearly 20%.
Regrettably, if understandably, he does not publish his ''hit list''
of stocks which should be bid for, restructured or put under new
management. But you can be sure they will be among those with the big
discounts.

KENNY Logan and Alex Marshall's aspirations of glory in the Hong Kong
Classic Pairs will be put on the line this morning when they line up in
their concluding section match against former world singles champion
Peter Belliss and his New Zealand countryman, Andrew Curtain.
The Scots, who opened yesterday with a 23-14 victory over local-side
Club de Recrieo, leading from the start, looked to have lost their
chance when they went down 22-14 in the afternoon match against
Ireland's Jackie Smyth and Noel Graham.
However, Ireland did the Scots a big favour last night when they led
all the way to beat the Kiwis 23-19, and a grateful Logan and Marshall
then took advantage when they beat Welsh pair Phil Rowlands and Robby
Price 19-18.
The Scots trailed 3-8 in the early stages but got back to all square
at 15-15 after 16 ends, and counts of 3 and 1 gave them a 19-15
advantage with three to play, where they restricted Wales to singles to
win 19-18.
Ireland's win against New Zealand always looked likely when they took
a big early lead, but the Scots supporters had some anxious moments as
New Zealand picked up counts of 4 on the nineteenth and twentieth ends
to trim Ireland to two, when a last-end double gave them a 23-19 win.
England's John Ottoway and David Ward need a miracle this morning to
survive after having lost 20-19 to Indian Recreation Club. Three sides,
South Africa, Channel Islands, and Zimbabwe are already assured of their
places in the quarter-finals.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has been warned that there is an
urgent need for an injection of cash into the hill farming sector to
stem the drift of cattle and sheep -- and therefore people -- from the
hills and upland areas.
''We left the Secretary of State with a stark message,'' said John
Ross, president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland.
Mr Ross and John Scott, convener of the union's hill farming
committee, told Mr Forsyth that higher Hill Livestock Compensatory
Allowances were essential.
Later, Scottish union leaders joined their UK counterparts in a
meeting with UK agriculture ministers to press the case for higher
HLCA's.

ALTHOUGH there are dozens of MBA departments in Britain's
universities, there is only one that looks at the problems of
management, business and enterprise from the angle of family firms. For,
while there are thousands of management consultants trained to identify
the means of producing the best possible returns to shareholders, to
maximise growth, to increase market share, to keeps costs down, there is
only one whose perspective and assumptions about business and enterprise
come from this trailblazing perspective.
That one person who recognised the need to address the problems of
family businesses in particular is Barbara Dunn, director of the Centre
for Family Enterprise at Glasgow's Caledonian University. The centre,
which was officially launched in September, is the only one in Britain,
based in a university, which is dedicated to research, teaching and
consultancy among family businesses.
Dunn's dynamism and ability have been crucial to the centre. Equally
important has been the strength of her case: she was convinced that
family firms, which are the most common form of business in Scotland,
were not receiving the sort of help they needed.
Because family assumptions about business goals, rewards and employee
relationships are different from those of large companies with multiple,
unrelated shareholders, no management consultants were properly
qualified to give assistance. They had, she says, the wrong tool kit.
Dunn's enthusiasm inspired in others the conviction that if the right
tool kit could be found, the performance of Scottish family companies
would be immensely improved, to the ultimate benefit of the economy in
general.
Scottish Enterprise and Scottish Business Insider both became involved
at an early stage. The former was already keen to evolve a strategy to
help family enterprises and provide a mutual support network; the latter
was very interested in Dunn's pilot family enterprise workshops. Support
also came from the LECs, the Clydesdale Bank and private investment.
The fact that the Centre for Family Enterprise is a part of Caledonian
University is important in several ways, Dunn says. First, it means
academic research can take place. Indeed, the university was so
impressed by her case that it gave her a year off from her business
teaching and management consultancy post to pursue research into the
nature, organisation and problems faced by family businesses.
The university also financed four trips to the US, where she
investigated a number of established family business centres. She then
undertook market research to find out whether family firms in Scotland
were interested in the idea of an enterprise centre. The response was
overwhelmingly positive.
Being located at the university also reassured family businesses that
when they came for advice, or to participate in workshops or forums,
they were entering a neutral environment, with no personal or commercial
agenda.
The centre's main aim, is to assess the needs, aims, structures and
relationships within family businesses, and then provide programmes
which can help them.
Dunn has approached her task from several angles. There is the
continuing commitment to teaching and research. She has developed an
evening class course, open to anyone and entitled Managing the Family
Business, which will count as a credit towards an MBA; and this year the
first PhD student embarks on research into ethnic family businesses.
She has also set up a wide-ranging programme of workshops and seminars
to which any member of the centre can come and learn new ways of doing
things, exchange ideas and provide mutual support. In addition, she has
established a framework in which individual families or groups of
businesses can get together in private forums to discuss their problems
confidentially and then receive management help.
The success of her trailblazing ideas is already obvious -- support
for the centre has been even more enthusiastic than she could have
hoped. And to crown her achievement so far, Caledonian University has
been invited to host the annual conference of the worldwide Family
Business Network in 1996.

<HEADLINE>Angry district leaders warn Scottish  Ministers to stop 'beating up' local government. Kynoch wants council staff cuts</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Local Government Minister George Kynoch continued to put
pressure on council leaders yesterday by suggesting they employed too
many administrators and managers.
He cited a new detailed Scottish Office staffing survey which showed
that more than 30,000, or about 13%, of council workers were not
directly engaged in delivering a service.
For their part, councillors meeting in Perth warned that unless
Ministers stopped ''beating up'' local government at every opportunity,
dialogue about the grave financial problems facing the new councils
would be impossible.
Many still were seething about Mr Kynoch's claim at The Herald's
Challenge of Change conference the previous day that the behaviour of
some councils over appointments and allowances amounted to a tragedy for
local democracy.
Councillor Keith Geddes, Labour leader of the new Edinburgh Council,
said the meeting had been united by a growing sense of anger about the
recent unjustified and misleading attacks made by Scottish Office
Ministers.
In a statement to accompany publication of the new staff survey,
conducted by Scottish Office statisticians with Cosla co-operation, Mr
Kynoch said he would be looking for reductions in the areas of finance,
central services and personnel when next year's figures were published.
The emerging new unitary councils must ensure that the structures they
set up represented value for money, he emphasised.
The Minister warned: ''Given the scale of the resources employed in
management and administration, it is clear that this is an area that
will need to be carefully monitored as we reduce from 65 to 32
authorities in April next year.''
It is planned to conduct the new-style surveys, which show the number
of council workers by salary band, service and sub service, for the next
three years.
Mr Kynoch said council tax payers would be able to assess if valuable
savings were being made on staffing levels and whether these savings
were freeing resources to be spent in other vital areas.
Cosla's Labour president, Ms Rosemary McKenna, said, however, that the
survey which relates to the regions and districts was already out of
date. The convention had published figures this week showing there had
been a 50% reduction -- equal to 600 jobs -- in senior management posts
in the new councils.
She also emphasised that administration could mean such vital work as
assessing housing benefit and working out timetables for home helps.
West Lothian Council Labour leader Graeme Morrice was anxious to
refute an earlier claim by Mr Kynoch that the new council would have 23
committees. In fact, there would be five main committees, three working
groups and and one sub-committee.
He said they had made savings of 17% in senior management costs
compared with the previous regional and district arrangements in the
area.
Cosla leaders are due to meet Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth next
week to discuss the 1996-97 financial settlement for councils which will
be announced as part of the Budget.
They agreed yesterday to press him for #100m to put right mismatches
due to reorganisation where current spending in an area is likely to be
above Government spending assessments on which the grant is based.
If he refuses, as expected, Cosla will implement a transitional scheme
designed to limit the damage in urban areas like Dundee and Glasgow
which means other councils have to give up some potential gains. Only
three SNP-run councils, Moray, Angus and Perth and Kinross did not not
give the plan their support.
Other main points from the staffing survey were that there were about
252,000 staff in Scottish councils at December 31 1994; just under 23%
of all staff were teachers; and women comprise more than 60% of council
staff and more than 90% of part-time workers.

Bonfires and fireworks make early November a hazardous time,
particularly for children. Are yours insured?
GUY Fawkes weekend can be a dangerous time for people and property
alike. Children are particularly at risk. Last year the number of
firework related injuries was the highest for 20 years and more than
half of those involved were under 15. The danger of house fires due to
stray fireworks or unruly bonfires also rockets on November 5.
It is a time when you could be extremely grateful that you have
insurance. Yet many parents are unaware they can insure their children
against injury. There are now a number of personal accident policies
available for children which pay out lump sums in the event of the sort
of permanent injury which occurs all too often on bonfire night.
The advantage of these policies is that they will cover your children
24-hours a day 365-days a year. Some policies available through schools
or sports clubs are effective only if they come to harm while involved
in school or club activities. This leaves them with no cover during
their leisure time.
In some cases of injury, you may be able to claim compensation from
another person, such as a driver if your child is hurt in a road
accident, or an organiser if he or she is injured at a big event.
However, you will have to prove negligence on that person's part and you
may have to wait a very long time before any money is handed over.
Under a children's personal accident policy, the amounts paid out
increase according to the severity of the disability suffered and the
level of cover chosen. Typically there are two levels of cover with
maximum benefits of #100,000 and #200,000. The highest amounts are for
the most serious injuries. Policies normally illustrate their scales of
benefits with different injuries, though they will pay out for any
permanent disability on a pro-rata basis.
For example, Class Cover, a children's accident policy offered by
Holmwoods, gives the maximum benefit if a child suffers total paralysis
or loss of intellectual capacity or the loss (or loss of use) of one or
both arms, legs, hands or feet. The maximum is also paid out for loss of
sight in both eyes. If sight is lost in one eye, half the maximum is
paid -- for instance under its Plan A, which pays up to #100,000, this
would be #50,000. Under the same policy the compensation for loss of a
finger or big toe is #10,000. For disfigurement affecting more than 20%
of the facial area it is #2000.
There is a daily benefit of #30 if a child is hospitalised, and #30
for each day he or she is confined at home following hospitalisation as
the result of an accident. Legal expenses cover is also available. No
policies pay out more than #6000 if a child dies, because parents may
not benefit from the death of their child. The money is intended to
cover funeral expenses.
Class Cover costs #19 a year for one child for maximum benefits of
#100,000, and #38 for two or more. For top benefits of #200,000 the
annual premiums are #28 and #56 respectively.
A new child's accident policy was launched recently by Willis Carroon
offering not just lump sum benefits but a range of other services. Child
Guard provides access to a 24-hour family helpline staffed by nurses who
can advise on childhood illnesses.
There is also professional counselling via telephone to help cope with
family and work related stress or with bereavement, access to a computer
waiting list for hospital operations, and Junior Care, a particularly
useful service for working parents. This will pay for a relative,
friend, competent carer or auxiliary to look after a sick or injured
child.
With its extra benefits, Child Guard is more expensive, starting at
#38 a year for one child for cover of #100,000 and #54 for #200,000.
Each additional child costs extra -- for five the premiums are #102 and
#179 respectively.
All parents, of course, would prefer not to have to make a claim for
injuries under such policies. A cash payout can never compensate for a
child's disability.
Fortunately, if your property is damaged on bonfire night the money
you can claim from your insurance company should enable you to put
things right again.
Most potential problems are covered. If a stray spark or firework sets
light to your shed, destroys your curtains or burns your fence, or a
rocket smashes a window or glass door, your household buildings or
contents policy will pay for the damage. But do take care. If an
incident is clearly due to an oversight on your part, you may not be
covered unless you have an accidental damage extension.
However, according to household insurer Eagle Star, your home is six
times more likely to be burgled on bonfire night than it is to catch
fire. Darkness and exploding bangers provide perfect cover for burglars
who know many people will be away attending firework displays. So it
will pay to take more precautions in relation to home security as well
as observing the firework code this weekend.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth is, we hear, fairly cracking the
whip over at the Scottish Office in Whitehall. Beleaguered officials and
civil servants are talking openly about having to work several times as
a hard as they ever did for Ian Lang.
They are possibly not being worked as hard by Forsyth, however, as
they are by some Scottish Labour MPs, who have been putting down a
barrage of questions for written reply. A total of 70 were dealt with on
Monday alone.
Champion of the cause is Paisley South MP Gordon McMaster who, by
Wednesday, had received a total of 38 replies on subjects as diverse as
police powers, fuel bill standing charges, carpet manufacturing in
Scotland, seat belts on school buses and access ramps for the disabled
at polling stations during elections.
Not far behind him were Mr Brian Donohoe (Cunninghame South) and Mrs
Maria Fyfe (Glasgow Maryhill).
McMaster says he comes across ideas for questions all the time, jots
them down and then tables them. He insists he is not just being a
nuisance and that all the questions are legitimately being asked on
behalf of his constituency.
The common belief is that it costs about #70 to answer a written
question, but one official told me this week that the actual cost is now
something like #250 to #350. McMaster insists he is not trying to
bankrupt the Scottish Office. Mmmmm . . . .
Screen test
THE aforementioned Mr Forsyth is an unlikely Braveheart, even if he
does represent Stirling, but the success of the film has led to an
initiative aimed at boosting the film industry in Scotland.
Mr Forsyth has asked Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise to consider how Scotland can best be promoted as a film
location and to establish what infrastructure is needed for the
production of commercial films. The report should be ready early in the
new year.
Spring poll?
TALKING of Tory back benchers, a growing number of them seem to be
mooching around the corridors here talking gloomily about a General
Election in the spring of next year. One senior Tory, with a majority
not unadjacent to 8000, told me: ''There will be a tax-cutting Budget in
November, and then we will go to the country next year. We cannot
possibly hang on for another 18 months.
Now you know
OVER to the Department of Totally Irrelevant Information. Conservative
Central Office took the trouble the other day to issue the following:
''Dr Brian Mawhinney MP, chairman of the Conservative Party, will
inspect the new Poletech mounted traffic lights and pedestrian crossing
at Chancellor's Gate outside the House of Commons on Thursday, November
2.
''Poletech Systems Ltd design and manufacture pole mounting sockets
for all types of poles, bollards, signs and illuminated street
furniture, together with a unique multi-purpose cable access box system.
''When the permanent underground base has been installed, no further
civil works are needed in order to replace damaged street furniture.
This means that the traffic lights outside the House of Commons can be
repaired without disruption, saving time and money.'' Re-establishes
your faith in democracy, doesn't it?
Holy terror
PARLIAMENT, as we all know, is a deeply serious place. A couple of
ladies from the House of Lords Refreshment Department were larking about
on Hallowe'en with a witch's outfit, complete with a black, pointed hat
with horrible, straggly green hair dangling from it. No wonder, then,
that there was a somewhat surprised look on the face of a gentleman,
fully robed up for his afternoon's labours, who came wandering round the
corner looking for a cup of coffee. It was one of the bishops.
Bold stroke
ALL is going well in the elaborate Royal Gallery, we hear, being

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday admitted to feeling terrified when
he faces Premier John Major at Question Time twice-weekly in the
Commons.
In an interview on Granada TV's This Morning show, Mr Blair told hosts
Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan: ''I am physically more nervous before
that than anything else I do.
''It's like the gladiators and lions in Roman times. You hesitate for
a moment, and you die there.''
And Mr Blair, whose party is enjoying the third largest opinion poll
lead ever recorded by pollsters Gallup -- of 39.5% -- told the
presenters how his children were teased at school because of who he was.
The Labour leader was also asked whether his youthful appearance had
benefited his political career.
He replied that when he was a parliamentary candidate 10 years ago,
elderly ladies would dismiss him with the words: ''Go back to school!''
''For people in the Labour Party who are saying it (the party) is a
bit too old-fashioned, it has helped,'' he said.

THE Ulster peace process was under new pressure last night after talks
failed to end the deadlock over Government demands for the start of IRA
disarmament.
A meeting between Northern Ireland Minister Michael Ancram and Sinn
Fein's Martin McGuinness broke up with the two sides no nearer reaching
agreement.
Before leaving Stormont, Sinn Fein left a fresh set of proposals for
the Government to consider.
The details have not been disclosed but with British and Irish
officials due to meet next week to discuss the worsening impasse,
Washington's hopes of a breakthrough before President Clinton's visit to
Ireland at the end of the month all but vanished in Belfast yesterday.
The Government is not prepared to move on a key demand that the IRA
must begin a process of decommissioning their weapons before republican
representatives can join all-party talks.
An independent international body agreed by London and Dublin would be
asked to ascertain and advise on how illegal weapons could be removed.
It would be advisory rather than operational at this stage, but Sinn
Fein confirmed their refusal to sign up to it.
According to Mr Ancram they put forward three proposals which included
a demand that all weapons, including those of the British Army, should
be covered by the arms commission. That he said, was ''totally
unacceptable''.
The Minister also claimed Sinn Fein wanted a date set for the start of
all-party talks, regardless of the proposed twin-track approach when
exploratory discussions could take place at the same time as the arms
commission met. A target date for dialogue he was told, was not enough.
Mr Ancram also said Sinn Fein demanded the withdrawal of the so-called
Washington Three Principle when some IRA weapons could be handed over as
a goodwill gesture before the start of talks.
No new talks are planned, but it is now clear the gulf between the two
sides at such a critical stage of the process may be even wider than at
first believed.
Last night there was no hint of a threat to the IRA ceasefire, but the
Sinn Fein leadership is under pressure as well from their own supporters
looking for some sort of progress.

ENGINEERING Ayrshire, with 44 firms on its books so far, is far from
unique. Trading alliances and common interest groups are all the rage in
many industrial sectors. The trend is intriguing, nonetheless, as an
example of how pure market rhetoric -- ''never let the competition know
what you're up to'' -- is being tempered these days by a more
collectivist approach to doing business.
In its first 18 months, Engineering Ayrshire claims to have generated
an additional #1.7m of sales for local firms, by joint appearances at
trade fairs, a source book (just updated) of Ayrshire's engineering
sub-contractors, and what the organisation describes as more ''turnkey''
approaches to winning contracts.
''I will encourage members to become lead companies, actively seeking
to sub-contract to other members, so that OEMs (original equipment
manufacturers) can access every aspect of a job, just by dealing with
one Engineering Ayrshire company,'' says Calum McPherson, the body's new
chairman.
McPherson is joint managing director of the family business, Johnstone
Castings &amp; Engineering, and increasingly uses that ''turnkey'' approach
to grow his own company.
There was a time, in the second half of the eighties, when one of this
Dalry-based non-ferrous gravity die caster's customers, supplying
fittings to the oil sector, accounted for 80% of its order book. Then
came the Piper Alpha disaster and specifications were tightened
dramatically overnight. Scrap levels soared to 40%. It was touch and go
for a while.
But far from giving up, Calum -- who was progressively taking over the
running of the business from his father Duncan and was soon to be joined
by his brother Stewart -- set about creating a new marketing strategy,
widening the customer base and offering a more comprehensive range of
services.
Some #500,000 has been invested in a CNC machining shop, a former
dance hall across the yard from the casting shop. Other services, such
as powder coating, were out-sourced. Johnstone Castings can now deliver
fully finished and packaged components to the OEMs which don't have to
be unwrapped until they reach the final customer.
Five years ago there were 12 customers on the books. Now there are 45.
Four years ago turnover was running at #600,000. Next year, sales in
excess of #2m are the target. Just before Christmas, Johnstone Castings
and its 44 staff move to a more modern 40,000 sq ft factory, across the
road from Dalry's biggest employer, Roche.
The business was started back in 1965 in converted mill permises in
Johnstone. Duncan McPherson had been works metallurgist in Rootes
Linwood plant before a business angel financed him to venture out on his
own. In 1972 the business moved to Kilwinning, then in 1982 to Dalry.
Progressively its main focus became aluminium casting, making
everything from light fittings to yacht chandlery and golf putters.
Copper-based alloys, gunmetal and brass also feature. But aluminium is
the mainstay. ''We developed a reputation for making castings others
said couldn't be done,'' says Calum. Among the customers was Ivor
Tiefenbrun's Linn Products, for whom Johnstone Castings has made
turntable platters.
Much of the raw aluminium the company casts is sourced as scrap
offcuts from the Scottish computer industry. Substantial investment in
an analytical tool allows it to monitor closely the grade of metal it
uses. ''Others thought we were mad sourcing from scrap. But it works for
us,'' Calum explains.
In his teens, he seemed destined for a career as a professional
golfer. At peak he played off scratch, representing Scotland. But at 17,
he chose to join his father's firm and train as a pattern-maker. By 21
he was running the new machine shop, created in a bid to add value to
the castings. Five years ago his older brother Stewart, who trained in
metallurgy in England and worked in Ireland for a time, also joined the
family firm. They are still only 29 and 31.
That makes the marketing-driven expansion achieved since Piper Alpha
all the more impressive. On a visit to a major trade fair in Birmingham
Calum McPherson met the Norwegian-owned, St Albans-based office
furniture manufacturer which now sources #300,000 of complex aluminium
castings from Dalry.
He is negotiating with a major manufacturer of banking terminals to
supply a range of customised metal fascias. And Johnstone supplies a
local manufacturer of forklift trucks with a range of parts which also
find their way to sister plants elsewhere. ''No-one else in the
non-ferrous casting industry in Scotland is growing as fast,'' he
claims. ''That's why we're investing in new and bigger premises.''
But, even if Johnstone is showing some rivals a clean pair of heels,
Calum McPherson can still see the competitive advantages of closer
co-operation with other member firms in Engineering Ayrshire. He is
convinced his growth targets -- sales up 25% over each of the next three
years -- will be best achieved by harnessing the complementary skills of
other Ayrshire sub-contractors to offer customers a more comprehensive
service.

* A friend and I both continued working after age 65 and eventually
retired at the same time. We, therefore, both qualified for a higher
than normal rate of state pension but, although our circumstances are
similar, he has ended up with an annual amount almost #700 greater than
me. Is there any obvious explanation for this?
* The current annual rates for basic state pension at age 65 are #3060
for a single person and #4893 for a married couple, where the wife's
pension is based on the husband's contributions.
A further pension which is earnings related can be added to these
figures and this is calculated by reference to the amount of earnings
during working life on which national insurance contributions have been
paid. Basic rates can also be reduced if the minimum level of
contributions was not achieved during working life.
Although both the basic and additional elements of pension are related
to contributions made, this is not the case with extra pension paid
because retirement has been deferred. National insurance contributions
stop at normal retiral age and the extra pension gained by working
beyond this is calculated by reference to the number of additional weeks
worked between the minimum of seven and maximum of five years.
However, if any other state payouts such as sickness benefit have been
claimed during the additional working period, the amount of extra
pension is reduced accordingly.
You can see from these comments that there could be a number of
reasons why your pension is at a lower level and if you want further
details you will need to contact your DSS office.
* My father died last January and I have recently sold shares in his
estate to pay the inheritance tax bill. There has, however, been a drop
in the price of the shares sold between the value in January and the
proceeds realised, and bearing in mind that the inheritance tax is
calculated on the January values tax will be paid on more than the
amount received for these shares. Is there any form of appeal or
procedure to change this tax liability?
* The solution to this problem is to be found in the inheritance tax
legislation where provision has been made for exactly the circumstances
you describe. Where quoted investments are sold within 12 months of
death a claim may be made to have these investments revalued for the
purposes of probate at the lower sales proceeds instead of the value at
date of death. The claim should be made by the person liable for the
tax.
On making a claim the tax is calculated as though the value of the
investments to which it relates was reduced by the loss on sale, but in
calculating the loss you have to take into account all sales of
investments within the 12-month period and not just the sales that show
a loss from date of death values.
* I was thinking of investing #10,000 in a capital growth bond with a
friendly society. I have one at present which matures shortly after 10
years paying a projected 150% profit. Do you think I could do better for
my money with another investment? I have not considered a PEP as I have
shares worth #20,000 at present.
* From your last sentence we assume that you want a lower risk
investment than straight shares and, while many friendly society bonds
will be less risky, there are some investing exclusively in equities, so
you must be sure you know what you are buying.
Friendly societies do have certain tax advantages but their products
have not performed better than other similar ones, such as with-profits
bonds. There may also be penalties for early withdrawal.
If you want security you could consider a Tessa for part of your funds
and also the guaranteed equity products which are coming forward. These
can give you a guaranteed return plus exposure to the equity market
while eliminating risk and volatility. These products also carry
penalties for early withdrawal but last five years, giving an exit at
that point.
* Our son has recently started university and is in receipt of the
maximum student grant. He has applied to the Student Loans Company for
the maximum loan (#1065) which is repayable once he leaves university.
The interest rate (APR) is 3.5%.
He does not need the additional money as he is living at home and has
a part-time job. His intention is to invest the whole sum to give the
highest return over the four-year period. Does this make economic sense,
and if so can you recommend some safe investments?
* This exercise is barely worth doing. The maximum interest you can
hope to get on #1000 is about 6.5% gross (Portman and Scarborough
building societies). So your son could earn about #30 a year if he is a
non-taxpayer. If as a result of his part-time work he is a 20% taxpayer
this would net down to #17 after paying interest on the loan. There is,
of course, no certainty that he could obtain 6.5% gross for the full
four years.
* I have decided not to join my employer's contributory pension scheme
because it cannot guarantee that it will not investment money in
activities which I would consider to be unethical. Although I am aware
that I will lose the benefits of my employer's contributions, I am
considering an ethical personal pension plan instead.
My financial adviser is steering me towards the Friends Provident
Stewardship Fund and to me it appears to be a strong performer. However,
I would like a second opinion before I take the plunge. Am I being
soundly advised or is there a better ethical pension arrangement I might
consider?
* Friends Provident was the pioneer of ethical investment in the UK
and its methodology is now followed by others. Its Stewardship fund has
the longest track record of such funds and you can invest in it with
confidence.
* I have arranged a 10-year endowment policy for my eight-year-old
grandson and will be paying the premiums which are #75 a month. Can you
say if the payment of premiums will be taken into account when tax is
calculated on my estate or are these gifts within the exemption levels?
* In the first instance the gift of each premium is a potentially
exempt transfer which falls entirely out of account seven years after
the date of the gift. In the event of your death within the seven-year
period the annual inheritance tax exemption, currently #3000, will be
sufficient to cover the amount of premiums unless it has been utilised
against other gifts.
You mention, however, that the endowment policy is for 10 years and
you will, therefore, be making gifts of the premiums for the term of the
policy. In addition to the annual exemption, a gift can be exempt to the
extent that it is made as part of your normal annual expenditure out of
income. You must be left with sufficient income to maintain your usual
standard of living so that you do not have to resort to capital to meet
your expenses.
For the gifts to be considered as made out of income they must form a
series showing a continuing pattern. The Revenue will normally accept
that a minimum of three years establishes this. Clearly in your case
this would not be a problem.
* I am starting a personal pension plan for the first time although I
have been in business for some years. Is there any allowance available
against past income as my profits this year are sufficient to let me pay
a reasonably high premium? If so, would tax relief be given this year or
against the profits for earlier years which were taxed at the basic
rate?
* Premiums can be paid to utilise unused pension relief for the
previous six years provided they are made in a year for which the
maximum pension premium has been paid. Relief for those premiums is
given in the year they are paid in addition to the maximum relief for
that year. If your current profits are liable to tax at the higher rate
then relief will be given at that rate, even though the profits on which
the unused relief is calculated were taxed at the basic rate.
If you were also liable to higher rate tax last year it could be worth
considering splitting the payment into two premiums and electing to
carry one back to the year 1994-95, as in total the premiums may attract
a higher amount of tax relief if spread over two years rather than
wholly set against a single year's income.

ADVERTISING
CORDIANT, the former Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising group, yesterday
announced its expected rights issue to reduce debt and create a sounder
base for recovery.
Long-suffering shareholders are being asked for #126m through a
one-for-one issue at 60p which is fully underwritten by SBC Warburg and
UBS.
Cordiant shares have been weak since it unveiled a first-half loss of
#29.6m but yesterday gained 8p to 92p on hopes that the new money will
at last enable the group to put its past problems behind it. It is the
third rights issue since 1991.
The high-profile accounts such as Mars and British Airways, which were
lost following the defection of the Saatchi brothers to found their own
rival agency, have all been replaced by new revenue and increased
spending by existing clients. The rights issue will end Cordiant's
financial worries, almost eliminating debt and enabling the group to
obtain facilities on better terms.
Saatchi's main priority is to reduce costs given that its operating
margins last year were three points short of rival WPP's 7%. Chairman
Charlie Scott said steps being taken this year will produce annual
savings of #27m. This will however lead to exceptional costs of at least
#51m this year, of which #27m will relate to disposals.
The American side of the business needs attention because it
underperforms the rest of the group yet generates 37% of revenue. Bob
Seelert, the chief executive of three months, is a American citizen and
will spend much of his time in the US, where the focus will be on
cost-cutting. Apart from reducing staff, and 470 people have gone so
far, the group is looking at reorganising its internal processes and in
achieving economies in accommodation costs.
Analysts suggested that the rights issue was a turning point for the
group and that it should be able to move forward. They were pleased that
accounts lost with the Saatchi split had been replaced fairly quickly.
Mr Seelert has set the goal of achieving revenue expansion in line
with the growth in advertising spending in its major markets by the end
of 1997 and achieving operating margins of 10% a year later.

US ECONOMY
Washington, Friday -- The unemployment rate slipped to 5.5% in October
but job creation was tepid for a second month in a row, the Government
said today, offering more evidence the economy slowed to a walk from a
sprint entering the autumn.
The Labour Department said last month's jobless rate, down from 5.6%
in September, was the lowest since February, when it was 5.4%.
A separate survey of businesses, however, revealed that 116,000 jobs
were created outside the farm sector last month following a revised
increase of just 50,000 in September, the department said.
The September gain previously was reported as 121,000. By contrast,
263,000 jobs were generated in August. Payroll gains averaged nearly
200,000 in the three months ending in August.
''This is not a strong economy, even though we are not sliding into
recession,'' said Sung Won Sohn of Norwest Corp.
He said today's report is consistent with a ''soft landing'' in which
the economy slows to a more sustainable pace. However, ''a soft landing
also means a soft economy,'' Mr Sohn added.
Economists said such a slowdown keeps inflation under control and
raises the odds the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this
year to give the economy a boost. -- Reuter

ASPREY, jeweller to the Royal Family and the international jet set,
has agreed to be sold to a relative of the Sultan of Brunei for #243.5m.
The acquisition is being made by Amedeo UK, the company which
represents the interests of Prince Jefri Bolkiah, the Sultan's brother.
The Sultan owns the luxury Dorchester hotel in London's Park Lane.
The offer for Asprey's ordinary shares is worth 250p cash per share, a
premium of 96.9% over the closing price of 127p, on November 2.
In order to secure the ongoing services of executive chairman John
Asprey in the strategic direction and management of the group, a
separate agreement has been reached with him and Asprey family trusts
whereby they will take a shareholding in Amedeo UK.
Asprey is 52% controlled by John Asprey and his family trusts, who
have irrevocably accepted the bid for their holdings. Offers are also to
be made for the preference shares and a loan note alternative will be
made available to accepting shareholders.
Upon the offers becoming unconditional John Asprey and group chief
executive Ian Dahl will join the board of Amedeo UK.
It is perhaps fitting that one of its best, if not the best, customer
should buy Asprey. Mr Asprey said that having considered the options
available to the group, including expressions of interest from other
parties and remaining a quoted company, the Amedeo UK offers represented
the best course of action for the group, shareholders, and employees.
Mr Asprey said: ''My family and I have known Prince Jefri and his
family for many years. His ownership of Asprey will enhance the style
and status of the group and the Asprey family is delighted to continue
to play an important role in its future''.
The financial backing of Prince Jefri should enable the group to
develop rapidly its international business, he added.
The family-owned jeweller, based in London's Old Bond Street, has
faced tough trading in the past year and has disappointed the City.
A year ago it was forced to issue a joint statement with its bankers,
the Bank of Scotland, in an attempt to reassure investors that its
financial health was not in jeopardy. In the six months to September 30
profit before tax collapsed to just #1.2m from #3m previously.
Sales were 15% higher at #93.9m. cash flow improved and there was a
small reduction in stock to #125m. Net gearing at the half-year was
25.5%. The loss per ordinary share was 2.7p compared with previous
earnings per share of 0.1p. There is no interim dividend. The
pre-Christmas trading period is the most important for the group in
determining profitability.
The appointment of Mr Dahl as chief executive, replacing the
flamboyant Naim Attallah who retired from the board yesterday, is
thought to be linked to the poor trading performance.
Mr Attallah has been criticised for expanding the group too quickly.
However, he believed that it was right to broaden the appeal of the
group away from a relatively small group of very rich people and into
other areas of the luxury goods market. In recent times Asprey has taken
over Mappin &amp; Webb, Watches of Switzerland, and Hamilton &amp; Inches in
Edinburgh.
The group's share price has reflected the decline in its trading
performance. From a high of 357p last year Asprey's shares closed at
246p yesterday, up 119p on news of the agreed bid. Their low point this
year has been 54p.

MY Scottish blood is boiling! I cannot believe that Jill Crawshaw did
not enjoy her tour of Scotland.
The Scottish Tourist Board are doing an excellent job. I have been in
the hotel trade for 35 years and watched the progress of the tourist
industry.
I have had several establishments inspected year after year, and I can
tell you the tourist board don't award ratings unless you provide the
facilities. Every year more and more establishments get grants for
private facilities.
It appears to me that Ms Crawshaw wanted to find out the worst places
to stay than write about all the hundreds of good ones. It is a pity she
did not stay at ''Coila'' as she would have got shower gel and shampoo
here!
I have put 1000 visitors through my hands this year and they have been
delighted with the food, both here and in the restaurants in Ayr.
Of course, most of the visitors want to visit our castles, especially
the Americans.
A few remarks for the visitors book includes, ''lovely warm
comfortable rooms'', ''five star accommodation'', ''too good to be
true'', ''unbelievable'', ''excellent food'', ''lovely welcome'', ''very
homely'', ''great breakfast'' -- I could go on and on.
You need to stay in Scotland and meet the tourists year after year --
not come on a flying visit and fill the press with a lot of bad
publicity.

I WAS filled with righteous indignation as I read Jill Crawshaw's
articles. What was she looking for? Why compare costs in Florida, where
produce, staff and facilities are much less expensive, to those in
Scotland? How could anyone be so negative!
But, sadly, I realised that Ma Crawshaw was seeing it as it was. I, a
sixth generation Canadian, married a Scot who lived in Canada for many
years. We spent many of our holidays in Scotland and I fell in love with
the spectacular scenery and wonderful people.
At my suggestion, we moved back to Scotland and travelled over 16,000
miles looking for a small country house hotel to buy and establish, as
we saw the need in today's market. And, I must admit, our reaction,
although not as negative as Ms Crawshaw's, was similar with regard to
the centres she visited, the lack of worthwhile attractions and the lack
of facilities in many establishments.
The Scottish Tourist Board and the numerous related groups should make
a concerted effort to really determine what today's visitor wants. Our
tourists, on the whole, are more sophisticated and educated. What do
they want? Let's find out and give it to them as best we can.
Please, let's listen to Ms Crawshaw and not stick our heads in the
sand. This is our most important industry and we have to do everything
in our power to increase the number of visitors to our wonderful country
and keep them coming back.
My strong criticism of Ms Crawshaw's articles is her constant
reference to price. Does she want ''cheap and cheerful'' (I think not if
her verdict is to be valid) or does she want value for her money?

JILL CRAWSHAW'S feature
on Scottish tourism, together with your leader article entitled
''Tartan, thistle and tat'', have focused on the downside of our
industry, and it is widely acknowledged that some attention needs to be
paid to the standards of product and service that Scotland offers its
visitors.
Coincidentally, however, I have been assisting this week with the
adjudication of the annual Glenturret Perthshire Tourism Awards, given
annually to tourist businesses in this area which have been praised by
our visitors.
This year, some 400 visitors to Perthshire from all over the world
have been so impressed with their stay that they have put pen to paper
to tell us so. I cannot help but contrast some of the following excerpts
from their (unsolicited) nominations with the more jaundiced approach of
your articles:
''Our best holiday ever'' . . . ''I want to return again and again'' .
. . ''How we can ever hope to repeat this experience'' . . . ''This is
our first time in Scotland, we will come again and certainly recommend
it'' . . . ''Extraordinary quality of meals and accommodation'', and so
on, 400 times!
Yes, standards vary across the country. Yes, there is room for further
improvement. But your series of articles should be placed in the context
that for every dissatisfied customer, there are many, many whose visits
to Scotland are memorable for all the right reasons.

JILL Crawshaw was indeed a Brave Heart to undertake a tour of Scotland
-- especally in October!
Over many years I have compiled a very short list of hotels and
restaurants that will always have my patronage. On three occasions I
''broke'' from the list and found only one good hotel -- in the Borders.
In the other two hotels -- each on one of the other Roads to the Isles
-- I was horrified by what the clients had to suffer. In one instance,
the poor punters included the Wally Arnolds and Sagas from other
countries of Europe.
In one of my recommended hotels I recently came across an employee of
the Scottish Tourist Board. She bleated that they could not sell, they
could not enforce anything and she was entirely unmoved by the fact that
I had been unable -- in my October travels -- to find any sign of the
supposed Autumn Gold initiative. I had asked about it in various places
and nobody had heard of it.

I REQUIRE the services of the Glasgow Tourist Information Centre. But
where is it? I'll look up the Glasgow Phone Book (1995) Ah, here we are,
Tourist Information Centre . . . 204 4400 -- but no address. Where is
it? ''I'm not telling,'' says the Phone Book. Oh well, I'll dial the
number and ask. ''You'll be lucky!'' Ring, ring -- no answer. Try again,
no answer. Try again, and again, and again . . . Very trying indeed!

PRIOR to the introduction of Deltic diesels to our West Highland Line
all the steam engines were fitted with sand boxes which were operated by
the driver when the need arose to get grip on the lines (October 30).
Since the introduction of the diesel engines, excluding the Sprinter,
the Deltics have been a pain in the neck. They are not fitted with sand
boxes.
From now to the end of the winter from Craigendoran to Upper
Helensburgh, and no doubt beyond, these Deltics roar in their effort to
get a grip on the track.
Those living near to the line do not need alarms as it sometimes
starts with the early morning Fort William-bound sleeper.
It sometimes takes the train half an hour to get from Craigendoran to
Upper Helensburgh.
Bring back the ''steamers''.

FACTOR. Say it north of the Highland line and it is a dirty word, with
echoes of clearances and serfdom to the big house. Even today it has the
power to arouse passion among crofters when rent rises are introduced
and the factor is seen as the oppressor.
Down in the Lowlands, the factor is something different. In rented
accommodation he is the liaison between landlord and tenant and
occasionally the focus of discontent.
However, the factor of which I wish to speak is a third and different
animal. He is the factor of private, owner-occupied flats. Sometimes he
is known by a posher title and is called a property services manager. He
arranges joint repairs and decoration, arbitrates in disputes over noise
and nuisance, liaises with local authorities on matters affecting all
proprietors, and for this he charges a fee.
Such factors abound among the owner-occupied tenements of Glasgow.
There seem to be fewer factors in Edinburgh, where I lived for 12 years.
The two cities have different traditions in house management. In
Edinburgh, buying and selling flats takes place usually through a
solicitor and estate agents are not the big players they are on the
Glasgow scene.
But when it comes to deciding whether to repaint the tenement close or
get estimates to fix the leak in the roof, for which all proprietors are
equally liable, the factor comes into his own. He is the referee for the
occasions when neighbours stop loving one another, and the tax collecter
for bills. He is, in Biblical parlance, our brother's keeper --
especially when our brother takes the attitude of Cain, who denied he
was any such thing. I heard recently of a non-factored property in which
a man would not allow his neighbour's tradesman access to the roof to
repair a leak which was causing water damage in the neighbour's flat.
Factors are especially necessary when people are slow or reluctant to
pay their share of common repairs. It is hardly conducive to good
relations between neighbours if debt collection is done within a
tenement (and in one case I know of, resulted in a threat of violence
when one proprietor told another that he did not see why he should pay
for the other man's debts).
There is another kind of factor. This kind manages a building
development with a substantial number of shared facilities, such as
gardens and lifts and carpeted entrance halls. Typical of this would be
the retirement home or sheltered housing complex. This week the
television programme Frontline Scotland featured a developer called
Bruce Miller who acts as factor for those who buy into his retirement
complexes. His face looked familiar, and I am certain I knew him as a
boy in Dundee, but now appears to be the face of factoring of this kind.
Bruce does not believe that those who pay for his pipework have any
right to call the tune when it comes to choosing the right people to do
work on the property. Further, he refuses to give them a statement of
how much they have (and it is their money, not his) in the communal fund
to pay for contingencies. Those who protest by withholding payments to
this fund are slammed with court actions, even if they are octogenarians
of limited means.
In this saga of sunset homes, Bruce's role was something of a sheriff
officer of Nottingham, while the part of Robin Hood was played (against
the run of clan typecasting) by a Campbell, the rock-climbing,
Rangers-supporting, Colin of that ilk, whom I happen to know because he
is my factor.
His company, Peverel, believes proprietors should have the opportunity
to vote on a budget for their development or flats which are guaranteed
a separately monitored bank account. Residents take the lead role in
decisions via house committees. Best of all, they implement a code of
practice for factoring property which prevents the kind of abuses which
are all too possible under a system in which the factor keeps the
accounts hidden and is not held accountable for his decisions.
Such codes for factors are now enshrined in the law of England but do
not apply in Scotland. The Scottish Office does not appear interested in
adopting this system in Scotland, nor are the majority of
factors/property managers. The ideal situation is that all live as good
neighbours in harmony with one another without needing to employ a
factor, but as we all know, this does not happen in every tenement or
retirement complex. We need not only a referee but rules of the game,
and these should have the backing of law.
For some disputed questions, such as noise pollution or failure to
agree to necessary common repairs, the local environmental health office
have powers to act, but by then it is usually too late. Peace has gone
out of the vandalised window and neighbours are at loggerheads. Or the
debtor has done a bunk and the building society is washing its hands. It
is not a bed of roses, but the factor has a positive role to play in our
society in promoting peaceful relations as well as clean and watertight
homes.
Without a legally enforceable code of conduct, the factor can exploit
difficulties among proprietors as a licence to collect money and do the
minimum. A code cannot make us love our neighbours any more than the Ten
Commandments can make us good, but at least it is a step in the right
direction.

HERCULES at least got to clean the Augean stables out himself. Lord
Nolan, landed last year by the Prime Minister with the Herculean task of
restoring standards in public life, starting with those of MPs, has had
to leave the actual cleansing to the people who made the mess in the
first place.
He has made proposals, drawn up the cleaning schedule as it were, only
to see it subsequently amended by the interested parties. On Monday MPs
will decide what to do about his report. They can carry on not quite
regardless, or come clean as Lord Nolan originally proposed.
He is a man who speaks his mind, as was made instantly clear. After
the first three days of the committee's hearings he pronounced, a rare
thing for the great and the good in such positions to do.
''It seems from the evidence so far that the rules on MPs' connections
with lobbyists need to be tightened up, that MPs need much better
guidance on what is and what is not acceptable,'' he said. ''It is also
reasonably clear that we need to consider in detail the possible
introduction of an independent element into Parliament's current
arrangements for self-regulation.''
Two calm, languid sentences, but at Westminster the warning bells
started ringing. This man was nobody's fool. The Prime Minister's
decision to clear the air of sleaze by setting up the committee was
beginning to look as if it had been over hasty in the taking. Unlike
Royal Commissions, which take minutes and last years, the Nolan
Committee was going to act.
Lord Nolan was picked to chair the Committee on Standards in Public
Life last October not by John Major, but by the Lord Chancellor, Lord
Mackay of Clashfern, a Wee Free of strong religious beliefs who
recognised in the devout Roman Catholic law lord someone with equally
strong moral principles, who would not be party to a whitewash job.
Once the panic over standards in public life had abated and MPs had
recovered their bottle that was likely to be the outcome, as events
since in the Commons have made clear.
Proof of Lord Nolan's independence lies in his judgments. In 1982 in
the High Court he granted the National Coal Board an injunction against
flying pickets in the miner's strike. In the Court of Appeal in 1991 he
allowed Judith Ward's appeal against her conviction for killing 10
people in the M62 coach bomb in 1974, describing the conviction as a
grave miscarriage of justice. In the same year he found the then Home
Secretary, Kenneth Baker, in contempt of court for having deported a
Zairean refugee in defiance of a court order, a judgement said to be
''one of the constitutionally most important for 200 years''.
It was best demonstrated, however, when Mr Major suggested in the
Commons, having announced his intention to cut out sleaze root and
branch, that the Nolan Committee would sit in private. Lord Nolan
instantly contradicted him. Oh, no it won't, he declared. It would hold
its hearings in public. And it did, to the general enlightenment of the
nation as politicians fulminated and lobbyists crept out of the woodwork
and exposed themselves to the light of day, protesting theirs was the
most innocent of professions.
His handling of the inquiry was a public relations success. He gave
the politicians who gave evidence, some of whom proved remarkably
hostile, short shrift, making clear from the outset that he intended to
propose drastic action. It was only to be expected from someone that his
close friend from college days, Judge Stephen Tumin, Her Majesty's Chief
Inspector of Prisons, called ''a man of virtue''.
It has been a rough 12 months for Lord Nolan. Alan Duncan, Tory MP for
Rutland and Melton, accosted him in the street, finger wagging and
irate, as he was going to hear the Commons debate the committee's
report. He was ''about to obliterate the professional class's
representation in the House of Commons,'' he told Lord Nolan. It was ''a
very, very dangerous game''.
Lord Nolan stared straight ahead, refusing to play Mr Duncan's game,
there being television cameras to hand. In the debate, condescending as
only he knows how, Sir Edward Heath, the Father of the House, dismissed
his right to sit in judgement. ''What saddens me about Lord Nolan is
that, although he is an admirable judge, he seems to have a certain lack
of worldliness, an ability to realise what actually goes on in this
world of ours,'' he said.
Lord Nolan ignored him as he had ignored Mr Duncan, demonstrating as
the months went by and the evidence poured in to his committee that he
knew perfectly well what went on in that world of theirs.
Michael Patrick Nolan, son of a solicitor, was educated at the smart
Roman Catholic college Ampleforth, and Wadham College, Oxford, where he
read law. It was there he met his future wife, Margaret, daughter of the
poet Alfred Noyes, and they were married in 1953, the year he was called
to the bar.
His ascent up the legal ladder was impeccable. He practised for 29
years as a gifted and unswervingly straight tax lawyer -- no tax gymnast
he, bending the law on his clients' behalf -- becoming a QC in 1968. In
1975 he was appointed a Crown Court Recorder, and in 1982 was made a
High Court judge, the same year that he was knighted. He served as a
Lord Justice of Appeal from 1991-93 and was created a life peer as Lord
Nolan of Brasted in Kent in 1994.
A tall man, he shares with another of his Wadham friends, the Northern
Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the appearance of a traditonal
Irish country gentleman, although he is the slimmer of the two.
He has a plastered-down hairstyle and a disconcertingly straight look,
which is not as severe as that might imply, and little side.
He would ride to the committee hearings on his bike, not the usual
mode of transport for a chairman who could easily command a limousine to
ferry him to work.
He lives in Westerham in a handsome six-bedroom house with a tennis
court and stables -- his wife used to breed Palomino ponies -- and for
20 years has owned a villa in the South of France. His lifestyle is said
to be expansive, scruffy rather than smart and he is very much a family
man. He has five children and 10 grandchildren.
A court usher once described the 67-year-old judge as ''a genial
cove'' and ''the most approachable man on the bench'' and he has been
called benign, unflappable, utterly impartial, scrupulously independent,
very astute, and very bright. He is, by all accounts, a man with a
tremendously strong sense of duty to the law and to his country. He was
described by one colleague as being ''one in a million''.
His career as a judge has demonstrated that the paragon there
described really does exist; that he is a man not afraid to go against
establishments of the day, whoever they are, and who plays fair.
Nor is Monday the end. The Nolan Committee was set up for three years
and the activities of MPs were only the first of its tasks.
Universities, grant maintained schools, local government spending
abuses, housing associations, training and enterprise councils, the
whole muddy world of non-profit-making bodies, also part of public life,
and possibly after the next election the funding of political parties
are on the agenda. The estimated cost is some #1.5m, of which #317,200
was spent on his report about what MPs get up to.

THE room is filled with a strange rustling sound which rises and
falls, but never fades away, and the atmosphere has that strange leaden
quality peculiar to places where people are concentrating on matters of
life and death, writes WILLIAM RUSSELL.
The room is the art deco ballroom of London's Hyde Park Hotel; the
event the fifth World Scrabble Championship, and the noise the
clitter-clatter of tiny tiles as 64 contestants plunge their hands
inside green bags containing the letters with which they will form yet
another esoteric word -- or not, as the case may be.
The ballroom in the basement of the hotel has no windows and the
cloistered atmosphere is ideal for such a highbrow event. There are 32
tables in rows of four, each covered with a white tablecloth, the green
Scrabble board providing a splash of colour. In addition, there is a
time clock, the national flag of the competitor, that tile bag, and a
jug of water.
They come from 31 countries, Scotland being represented by our current
champion, Neil Scott, a 22-year-old student from Edinburgh. It was a day
of words, words, and more words, except in his case. Scott does not talk
to the press. Words are for putting on the board, not for speaking, it
seems. Or maybe he was just shy.
The 64 competitors, 12 of whom are Britons, range in age from 15 to 58
and come from countries as diverse as Kurdistan-Iraq, Sri Lanka, Israel,
Japan, and Saudi Arabia, as well as from English-speaking countries like
Canada and the United States. They compete in English.
It is harder for some than others, but the staple diet of a Scrabble
player is dictionaries. British players use Chambers Dictionary, the
Americans and Canadians Webster's Dictionary, and the rest of the world
plays it both ways, so both dictionaries are consulted when there is a
dispute about a word. The players seek the help of an umpire, a message
is passed to the judges who sit at a long table on the stage at one end
of the ballroom, and in due course a judgment is handed down.
Scrabble is a way of life. Philip Nelkon, the 39-year-old organiser,
was British National Champion for four years and competed in the 1993
World Championship -- ''one of the nicest experiences of my life''. A
former accountant, he lives in North London and has played the game for
20 years. Since 1993 has been employed by Spear's Games, who own the
rights to the game everywhere except in the United States and Canada, to
run Britain's annual Scrabble contests and is currently setting one up
for the universities.
So far there have been no fisticuffs, and Nelkon does not think there
will be, although he admitted a stand-up fight had happened during a
contest in the United States. Here, however, the players were all
friends, he said. As for the appeal of Scrabble, he thought it was
because it was both a family game and one which could be treated as
seriously as bridge or chess.
He admitted the game tended to be dominated by Americans and Britons
and was more difficult for people for whom English was a second
language. But that did not deter them from playing and there were
contestants from one or two African countries who could do well this
time round, he said. Men played it better than women, although he
refused to speculate why this should be so, and in any case a woman,
Robin Pollock from Canada, was in the lead at the time.
The game was invented in 1931 by Alfred Butts of Poughkeepsie who was
out of work because of the Depression, and over the next 20 or so years
was revised and refined, changing its name from Lexico to Criss Cross
Words until it ended up as Scrabble. It took off in 1954 when Macey's,
the New York department store, decided to stock it and the result was
that it sold some five million sets. Currently available in 120
countries in 31 languages, it sells five million sets a year worldwide,
and can be found in the cupboards of half the households in the United
Kingdom waiting for that rainy day when the telly breaks down and
something amusing must be found to do.
The highest score ever achieved was 392 points made in a previous
contest by one of the current contestants, Karl Koshnaw, a Kurd from
Iraq who lives in Twickenham. His winning word was caziques, which is a
West Indian chief. Other useful words? Nelkon said that for players with
lots of vowels there was euouae, a Gregorian cadence, and for those with
lots of consonants crwth, a Welsh musical instrument. But what serious
Scrabble players cherish are unusual two-letter words and he offered two
-- Qi, pronounced chi, a Chinese life force, and zo, a yak.
The finals are held tomorrow and the winner will receive a cheque for
$11,000, a Royal Doulton crystal trophy and a gold-plated Scrabble set
from Franklin Mint. As I left the tiles were tinkling away, Scott, who
had been in 36th place was down to 42nd place having lost a game, and
the championship was proceeding on its stately way.
Anyone for draughts? Snakes and ladders? Ludo?

THERE has been a remarkable popular response to Jill Crawshaw's recent
Herald articles on the Scottish tourist industry, as attested by
readers' letters to this paper which are far too numerous to be
published in their entirety. Overwhelmingly they share her findings and
conclusions. The Scottish Tourist Board itself is aware of the problems:
its latest annual report identified a decline in our tourist trade and
felt the trend would continue unless something was done about it. The
board's function is to market the industry, and it is not responsible
for the individual enterprises whose failure to meet standards common
elsewhere has been much commented on. In effect, however, the board has
not just to market but to lead the industry. This must be true of
certain vital areas, like training, where not only the basic skills of
the hotelier have to be instilled at all levels, but attitudes have to
be challenged so that service is accepted as a professional attribute to
be offered to customers, rather than some servile response to them which
is grudged and therefore unpleasant to receive. The board has to lead;
it is the local enterprise bodies which provide the junior officers and
NCOs who command the workers at the front line, all of whom are the
personnel visitors actually meet and who imprint the brand of real
experience on tourists' memories.
These memories will not be unique, for part of the challenge that the
industry has to face is that its customers are far more critical than
they were even a generation ago, for they have travelled. Tourism has
become a huge industry in almost every country. Cheap air transport has
democratised it, and ushered in packaged holidays to cultures which have
very different traditions and attitudes to service. This has created a
large critical audience which did not exist, outside the really
well-to-do, before the 1950s. That audience may also have experience of
tourist cultures with very different levels of taxation. The British
tourist industry generally is fairly heavily taxed even at the most
basic level of bed and breakfast, where local taxation, usually
increased when householders admit to B&amp;B, may help to increase the
feeling many people have about excessive costs. That has the effect,
however, of making service even more important: we can all bear charges
if they are preceded by satisfaction; it is only when we are disgruntled
by poor service or casual attention that costs are really resented.
Writing along such lines should not give the impression that it is all
easy -- the tourist industry demands hard work, another reason for
insisting on the professional elements essential to its success. The
basic requirements for establishing a thoroughly professional cadre of
workers is probably in place by now, through the hotel schools and
training centres in the new universities. Yet the evidence seems to be
that this provision has yet to deliver what is expected on the ground,
outside the very best (and hence very expensive) establishments. It may
be a matter of time, but it is even more likely to be a matter of
objective criticism and complaint. The Crawshaw articles should be seen
in that context. Scotland offers a wonderful and unique backdrop to its
visitors, but their enjoyment of it will be less than it could be -- and
they will be less likely to return for more of it -- unless, when they
complain about failings, they encounter a positive response. There is
far too much to complain about; recognising that must be the beginning
of improvement. It was Cesar Ritz, arguably the founder of the
international tourist hotel industry, who coined its first law -- ''the
customer is always right''.

THE Nigerian military administration seems hell bent on picking rods
for its own back. Having climbed down in July from the savage sentences
-- including several death sentences -- imposed on political opponents,
it has now allowed a similar situation to arise in respect of Ken
Saro-Wiwa, the Ongoni rights campaigner and internationally known
intellectual. Mr Saro-Wiwa and eight others were sentenced to death in
Port Harcourt this week after being accused of promoting violence,
including murder, in Ongoniland in the heart of the country's
oil-producing region. No-one believes that the accused had a fair trial
from what was a tribunal appointed by the army. UN appointed observers
were of the opinion that the tribunal was neither independent nor
impartial. One UN human rights expert on torture believes that Mr
Saro-Wiwa had been tortured while held in detention before the trial,
which the UN observers have now condemned without reservation. The
predictable outcome has been that several countries, including the
United States and Great Britain, are now talking once more of imposing
economic sanctions on the country. There is even the possibility that an
attempt could be made to expel Nigeria from the Commonwealth, whose
heads of state are scheduled to meet in New Zealand between the 10th and
13th of this month.
The hope is that no action will be taken against Mr Saro-Wiwa and the
others until the Commonwealth meeting, though it is not yet clear if the
Nigerian Head of State, General Abacha, will attend the Commonwealth
meeting. It could be a bad omen if he does not; but no country would
want to be kicked out of the Commonwealth. It would be a loss if Nigeria
were to suffer that fate given its potential and the military pledge to
return it to civilian rule eventually, though far too slowly. The regime
stepped back from that possibility in the summer but undoubtedly now
faces it again, with both the British and Americans saying that their
sanctions will not drag on or be confined to purely commercial
operations. In fact the British Government does not want to expel
Nigeria -- once the precedent has been established it might be all to
easy to repeat it and fragment the Commonwealth, which needs as much
elasticity as a voluntary association can command. At the same time it
is hard for it to claim to mean anything if member states can ignore
such basic human rights as Nigeria's military rulers seem to demand.
The Nigerians could be given a chance to react to Commonwealth
disapproval in New Zealand. They will not be the only state in the dock
since much Commonwealth -- and certainly all Antipodean -- opinion is
outraged by the way in which Great Britain has defended the French
nuclear tests in Polynesia: Mr Major will have a hard time at Auckland.
Curiously this state of affairs may make the Nigeria military more able
to climb down when the former imperial master is also reprimanded. There
is, however, always the possibility that the soldiers will dig their
heels in and proceed with the executions. All this merely confirms the
original British (and American) view that the timetable for the
country's return to civilian rule is far too long. Of course civil
governments can turn out to be every bit as draconian as military
regimes, but they are often saved by the need to be re-elected and the
way in which that tends to moderate excess. In this case there is little
doubt that the trial was unjust and its sentences wildly excessive given
the inadequacy of the evidence against the accused. Unless the military
regime accepts that -- or something akin to it -- and takes corrective
action, a major crisis is unavoidable.

Music
CLIO Gould, stepping out of her more familiar role as leader of the BT
Scottish Ensemble, yesterday gave a lunchtime concert at the RSAMD that
turned the orthodoxy of the violin recital on its head.
From start to end, this was a dazzling display -- and not just of
violinistic technique (though that too). Of three works in a brilliantly
imaginative programme, two are almost completely ignored by violinists,
and the other -- while familiar enough through recordings -- is sadly
neglected in concert programmes.
Janacek's four-movement Sonata is a wonderful piece, blindingly
original from first note to last, shot through with the composer's
unique handling of folk idioms, and with -- in its slow movement -- one
of his finest lyrical inventions, a gorgeous ballad that rivals the most
supreme melodic moments in any of his operas. Clio Gould, with the
superb pianist Sophia Rahman, went through it like a storm, bringing an
almost gipsy-like wildness to its more rhapsodic pages, and with the
most haunting playing I have heard from this fine violinist in a
breathtaking account of the beautiful slow movement.
From one level of originality, Gould and Rahman, plunged into another
with George Crumb's Four Nocturnes from his Night Music 11. From a
similar source as Bartok's night music, Crumb has woven his own delicate
sound world, sensitively evoked yesterday by the two musicians in these
miniatures, which, typically, involved the pianist (who, apropos of
nothing, has the longest hair I've ever seen) caressing the strings
inside the body of the piano. The whole effect was ethereal and
timeless, delivered with a light touch.
Closing an outstanding recital, Gould produced an account of Ravel's
more familiar Sonata distinguished by its lyrical intensity, slinkiness
(in the second movement Blues) and torrential virtuosity in its finale.

Theatre
IN the wake of the success of Bondagers it makes absolute sense for
Stellar Quines to give us a second look at Sue Glover's The Seal Wife.
It does seem surprising, though, that no-one else has thought to do it
since it was first staged at the old Little Lyceum in 1979.
It's no great criticism to say it's not as good a play as Bondagers,
that would be asking too much, but admirers of that play will find many
similar elements: a love of everyday language, an interest in the
relationship between mankind and nature, a female-centric view that
doesn't depend on men for the dramatic action, and a style of writing
that focuses on the interplay of character and emotion.
Gerda Stevenson's production, touring for the rest of this month, is a
well-acted affair that plays up to the elemental pulse of the story, a
modern version of the legend of the Silkies, the seals who take human
shape and never quite shake off the lunar pull of the sea. Karen
Tennent's set, lit by the flickering waves of Allan Woolfe's lighting
design, looks like it's just been washed up, and Diane O'Kelly, in the
title role, sheds her seal skin early on, but holds on to her animal
gestures to the end.
There's also a lovely double-act between the beach-combing Kay Gallie
and Jan Wilson -- both as good as I've seen them. It's evocative and
engaging stuff, but the play's weakness is in the way it drifts in and
out like the tide, lapping around its themes but not shifting things
significantly -- you feel like you've visited the scene but missed the
main event.

JAMES (Hamish) Dunlop, one of Scotland's best known local government
figures of recent years, has died. Former chief executive of Fife
Regional Council, he was 73.
He will be remembered as one of the heroes of the Fight for Fife
campaign before the last reform of local government in 1974. ''If it had
not been for Hamish, Fife would have been split up,'' said Sir George
Sharp, former convener of Fife Regional Council and a past president of
the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.
Recalling that Mr Dunlop was one of the longest serving officials in
Scottish local government, Sir George added: ''He was one of the major
players in keeping Fife together. His unbridled enthusiasm and
dedication was an inspiration to those of us who were in the front line
of Fight for Fife.''
Born in Glasgow and a law graduate, Mr Dunlop served in the army from
1942-46, rising to the rank of captain. After local government service
with Aberdeen, Dumfries, Ross and Cromarty, and Fife county councils, he
became chief executive of Fife Regional Council in 1974 and served in
that post until he retired to St Andrews in 1985.
Mr Dunlop was clerk to the lieutenancy for Fife from 1980-92 and was
appointed a JP in 1981. His distinguished public service led to the
award of the CBE in the Queen's birthday honours list in June, 1978.
Married with two daughters, Mr Dunlop listed gardening and golf as his
hobbies and was a member of the R &amp; A Club, St Andrews.

George Davidson, football commentator and master mariner; born June
27, 1902, died November 2, 1995
An appreciation
by Jack Webster
GEORGE Davidson, the veteran Scottish BBC football commentator, has
died at the age of 93. Since his wife's death last year he had lived in
the Sir Gabriel Wood home for retired mariners in Greenock.
This commands a splendid view of his beloved Clyde estuary, but George
Davidson, a white-haired figure of quiet dignity, had been registered
blind for 15 or 16 years, though he retained a little peripheral vision.
Unable to read, he was glad that he could at least listen to the radio
and keep in touch with that sporting domain which was once so much his
own.
My memory of George Davidson dates from the post-war period when the
BBC Saturday night sports programme produced distinctive characters like
Peter Thomson, Jameson Clark, Jack Inglis, Bill Fraser, Andy
Cowan-Martin and, of course, George. What I hadn't realised was that he
was already a football commentator on the wireless in the 1930s. But, as
so often, it was just a hobby which took second place to a very
different professional interest.
In fact George Davidson, a master mariner, was head of the navigation
department at the James Watt College in Greenock for many years until he
retired in 1963. He had a lifelong connection with the sea.
At 17 he left Gourock and followed his father into the merchant
service, sailing five times round the world. On board the Ben Gloe, he
sailed into the Japanese port of Yokohama just in time to witness one of
the world's biggest disasters, the earthquake of 1923 which all but
destroyed Tokyo and Yokohama.
''Our ship just shook as the earthquake struck and we saw the flames
rising all the way down the coast from Tokyo,'' George told me. ''As the
lighthouse on the breakwater collapsed, we were the first British ship
ashore to take off survivors.''
On a happier adventure, George sailed into Fremantle and met Nell, the
Australian girl who would become his wife. They were married in 1934 and
settled back in Gourock, where they raised their three children, Marcus,
now a shipyard executive in Vancouver, Russell, a professor of
econometrics in Marseilles, and Lynn Chambers, a radio producer in
Scotland.
George would become an academic but his early passion for Greenock
Morton led him to the BBC, which was then based at Blythswood Square in
the heart of Glasgow. Producer Robert F Dunnett didn't take long to
employ him on the Saturday sports programme called Fan Fare, alongside
men such as R E Kingsley, better known as Rex. After the war that
programme became Sportsreel, produced by memorable figures like Eddie
Fraser, James Crampsey, and Archie P Lee, and fronted by Peter Thomson.
Even in his eighties, people would comment on his distinctive voice,
familiar from his broadcasting days.
Within that structure, George Davidson took his prominent place and
went on to become the first commentator of televised football in
Scotland. When I met him last year, he regaled me with memories of great
football occasions and the men who made them so: ''Nobody believed me
when I forecast that Scotland would beat England in the year that the
latter won the World Cup at Wembley. I told them we would do it with
old-fashioned talent like Baxter's. And we did.''
He also remembered that the film of Celtic's sensational 7-1 drubbing
of Rangers somehow failed to survive for posterity and that this led to
much ribbing of colleague Peter Thomson, whose leaning towards Rangers
was hard to disguise.
Last year, after Nell Davidson, his wife of almost 60 years, was taken
to hospital, a home-help found George unconscious on the floor. He was
taken to the same hospital, suffering from pneumonia. Still poorly, he
was wheeled to Nell's bedside and was there when she died.
Without his sight and much depressed, the wiry George nevertheless
subsquently went to visit his son in Vancouver. Then he settled back
into the mariners' home in Greenock, glad to have the loving attention
of daughter Lynn and her family, who live nearby. Glad too that, for all
the trials of advancing years, he could turn on the radio and listen to
a medium which played such an important part in his own more vital
times.

Dance
WHEN we start drifting into the venue, it's to find Matthew Hawkins
and his dancers already there. Our presence, however, marks a transition
from preparation to performance.
Presence, absence. The themes twine through the whole evening. Hawkins
himself speaks of them in occasional text as droll and cunningly
fashioned as his choreography. Some absences can be explained: mythic
icons, the dead, and the casts of big-budget, long-running shows are
destined never to be with us in the flesh.
But hark! Dead Purcell's music is suddenly among us -- partly on
pre-recorded tape, partly ''live'' thanks to the valiant efforts of
members from the recently formed SAM Gay Men's Chorus.
This revival means, of course, that Hawkins can introduce another
element of his intricate thinking: ownership. As a creative artist he
has the freedom -- and most certainly the imagination -- to take over
the music, setting his own movements and ideas to it. In fact, it's more
or less what every age does with its inherited traditions. The dance
world is full of techniques that have been handed down from foot to
foot, adapted by the fashions of the time or indeed by the bodies who
perform them according to their own strengths. Hawkins is acutely aware
of such transitions, such bridging.
His own choreography is a glorious, witty mix of period courtliness
and present steps. After various exquisite dances to Purcell, Hawkins
and his company of four fly out like some timeless sprites from a cosmic
masque to dance with vibrancy and poignancy to John Blow's Ode on the
Death of Mr Henry Purcell.
There are echoes of earlier sequences brought back into the flow of
this work, as if echoing the idea that things past can be remembered.
When the dance ends, the moments of glorious precision, of idiosyncratic
humour and sheer classic inventiveness are, technically, at an end --
but they will be summoned forth again, when the piece is repeated
tonight.

Ian Greig, a founder of the Monday Club; born October 26, 1924, died
October 12, 1995
IAN GREIG, who has died, aged 70, was one of the founders of the
right-wing Monday Club, for a period one of the influential groups
within the Conservative party. Though born in London he was of Scottish
descent from the McLeans of Col on his mother's and the Earls of
Stirling on his father's side.
He was a close friend of Sir Alec Douglas-Home although their
political views only coincided on the dangers of Communist expansion.
Greig's book The Assault on the West (1968) spelled out the dangers
which he believed insufficiently alert democracies faced from
expansionist Communism aided by those engaged on internal subversion. It
carried an approving preface by Home.
Educated at Stowe school Ian Greig was commissioned at the age of 18
in a cavalry regiment and saw service in Holland after the D-Day
landings. He had the almost accidental distinction of taking a large
number of Germans prisoner after his tank became separated from the rest
of the regiment. Surrounded by superior numbers he was relieved to see
the Germans throw down their weapons and raise their hands in the air.
He remained in the Army after the war and time spent in Palestine
prompted his lifelong fascination with terrorism and its methods. After
a spell as a Conservative constituency agent he worked as a journalist
and broadcaster. On one of his frequent return visits to Scotland he met
his wife Isabel Campbell who worked as his researcher.
The Monday Club was formed by Conservatives who looked for leadership
to the Marquis of Salisbury and were dubious about the rapid
decolonisation of Africa foreshadowed in Macmillan's ''wind of change''
speech to the South African Parliament. They were doubtful about the
former colonies' ability to rule themselves satisfactorily and worried
about the opportunities this offered the Communists to further their
strategic aims.
The group published papers on South Africa and Rhodesia and remained
well disposed to the Smith regime after it declared UDI in 1965.
Another keen interest was Ulster and Greig made frequent visits to the
province, a poor sense of direction often taking him inadvertently into
dangerous areas. He wrote several pamphlets on Northern Ireland, some
dealing with the influence of ultra-left groups.
He and his wife, who survives him, also engaged in a good deal of
charitable work which included efforts to help Vietnamese war orphans.
Greig was identifed by those unsympathetic to his views as a fully
paid up member of the ''reds under the bed'' school of thought.
Certainly he shared the views of those like retired General Sir Frank
Kitson that more should be done to prepare the armed forces to cope with
terrorism.
But evidence that there were some spies around came when he and Sir
Alex, then Foreign Secretary, attended a performance of Robert Bolt's
play Vivat! Vivat! Regina along with several Russian diplomats due to be
expelled the following day. After a reference in the play to ''spies in
our midst'' Sir Alec winked at the Greigs and advised them to read the
newspapers next morning.

Brian Easdale, composer; born August 10, 1909, died October 30, 1995
An appreciation
by Iain Sutherland
JUST more than a year ago I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the
Oscar-winning film composer, Brian Easdale, was still alive. Michael
Webber, artistic director to English Heritage, asked me to consider
including Easdale's ballet suite The Red Shoes in my Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra concert at London's Kenwood Concert Bowl in August this year.
I was delighted, being an avid fan of all Easdale's music, but was
anxious to meet the Grand Old Man himself as soon as possible, as his
age was given as being variously between 86 and 90.
Eventually a meeting was arranged at the Maida Vale flat of Easdale's
friend, the Contemporary Soul recording artist Blue Johnson, and his
fashion-model wife Melinda. Since they got talking one day six years ago
in a local St John's Wood hostelry, Blue Johnson had made it his mission
to alert the musical world to Easdale's neglect; hence my RPO concert.
In all I met Easdale four times. At our first we had a detailed
discussion about the score of The Red Shoes. Then he regaled me with
wonderful anecdotes about Moira Shearer, Robert Helpman, and Leonide
Massine, the stars of that film. And of course it was the RPO, under Sir
Thomas Beecham, who had recorded the score originally in 1948.
These reminiscences led inevitably to his student days, studying with
C. Armstrong Gibbs, and to his golden years as the ''house composer''
for the Powell and Pressburger film company, The Archers, for whom, in
addition to The Red Shoes (Academy Award 1948), he wrote music for Black
Narcissus, The Small Back Room, Gone to Earth (Venice Film Festival
Music Prize), The Elusive Pimpernel, The Miracle in Soho, Battle of the
River Plate, and Peeping Tom; he also scored Outcast of the Islands for
Sir Carol Reid, and many documentaries and TV adaptions.
Easdale started his long musical career early as a pupil at the
Westminster Abbey Choir School, before his studies with Armstrong Gibbs
at The Royal College of Music. He often referred in conversation to his
early work, an opera Rapunzel, written when he was 18. I had been
looking forward to going through the score with him -- a pleasure, alas,
no longer to be. We were also hoping to arrange a showing at the
National Film Theatre in London of the documentaries he had worked on in
the thirties with the legendary Scottish film-maker John Grierson's GPO
Film Unit and in the forties with the Crown Film Unit and the
Information Films of India.
This last posting overseas was to be fortunate. He spent all his free
time studying Indian music and transcribing folk melodies which were to
influence his later style. His most memorable score from these years was
for Johnnie Gurkha in 1945. While in Bombay he befriended the author
Rumer Godden, whose book Black Narcissus was to eventually provide
Easdale with his first commission from The Archers. His ability to write
balletic music so famously displayed later in The Red Shoes was
foreshadowed by the erotic Kanchi's dance, so fetchingly performed in
Black Narcissus by the teenage Jean Simmons.
However, apart from the pleasure of meeting Easdale, listening to his
stories, and talking about his music, I had a serious purpose too. The
sell-out audience of 12,000 at Kenwood in August had risen to
acknowledge the composer and his music when I told them that he was
there in their midst and asked for a spotlight to pick the Grand Old Man
out.
This ovation led Blue Johnson and me to develop a plan with Warner
Classics to re-record all Easdale's classic film scores. We spent our
last meeting just a few days ago discussing which scores were to be
photocopied and adapted and enjoying a quiet glass of beer. Easdale will
not be at the next meeting, nor will he be in the studio with the
orchestra and myself when we recreate his music. But I will sense his
gentle smile and his gentlemanly nod of approval.

David Healy, actor, born New York May 15, 1929, died London, October
25, 1995
DAVID Healy, one of four children of an Australian immigrant and a
Texan school teacher, came to London in 1964 and rapidly established
himself as an actor of versatility and power in both thestraight and
musical theatre.
His biggest success was probably as Nicely-Nicely Johnson in the
National Theatre production of Guys and Dolls for which he won an
Olivier award in 1982. He regularly brought the house down with Sit Down
You're Rocking the Boat.
In 1987 he scored a success as Buddy in Stephen Sondheim's Follies,
staying with the show for the entire 16-month run. His first musical was
in Anne of Green Gables, and he also appeared in the less successful On
the Twentieth Century with Julia Mackenzie, his Follies co-star, and in
Songbook with Anton Rogers and Gemma Craven, about a fictitious Tin Pan
Alley composer, Mooney Shapiro. On radio he broadcast regularly in
programmes about musicals and this last year has been heard in the Radio
2 series which has featured Kismet, Finian's Rainbow, The Music Man, and
One Touch of Venus.
His straight plays included Jules Feifer's Little Murders with the
Royal Shakespeare Company in 1967, and he stayed with the RSC to appear
in Julius Caesar, The Merry Wives of Windsor, and Arthur Kopit's
Indians.
Brought up in Texas and New York he majored in drama at Southern
Methodist University, Dallas, and after graduating was posted to England
with the United States Airforce where he joined an old friend from his
college days, Larry Hagman. Together they took part in Air Force
entertainment shows. After he left the USAF in 1964 he decided to remain
in Britain, having married an English girl, and pursue a stage career
here.
He worked with the RSC, the Royal National Theatre, on the London
fringe, in the West End and also on Broadway in plays like Stoppard's
The Real Inspector Hound. His films included several Bonds, notably
Diamonds are Forever, Patton, Twilight's Last Gleaming, and most
recently Chaplin. His last West End stage appearance was in 1993 in
Arthur Miller's The Last Yankee, and at the time of his death he was due
to return to the RSC to appear in a new play, Slaughter City by the
American writer, Naomi Wallace.
He is survived by his wife Peggy, and their two sons.

Sir Wallace Rowling, New Zealand politician; born November 15, 1927,
died October 31, 1995
SIR Wallace Rowling, a former New Zealand Labour Party Prime Minister
and ambassador to the United States, died on Tuesday. Aged 67, he had
been diagnosed as having a brain tumour in September.
He was Prime Minister for 15 months in the mid 1970s, taking over
after the death of the popular, paternal figure of Norman Kirk and being
succeeded by the powerful orator David Lange, who returned Labour to
power in 1984.
Criticised during his tenure for being weak and losing three elections
to the populist Sir Robert Muldoon, Rowling was regarded in later years
as a man of integrity who made a contribution beyond his political
career. Former Labour Party Prime Minister Mike Moore said Rowling was a
''thoroughly decent bloke.
''His misfortune was to be leading a political party during one of the
most indecent and ugly times in New Zealand's political history,'' Moore
said.
Rowling served as New Zealand's ambassador to the United States
between 1985 and 1988, when relations were strained by New Zealand's
anti-nuclear policy. He was married with four children.

Donald Eugene (Don) Cherry, jazz trumpeter; born November 18, 1936,
died October 19, 1995
WITH a few notable exceptions such as Miles Davis, jazz musicians of a
certain age are famous for their disdain of pop and rock music, so you
might be forgiven for assuming that Don Cherry's enthusiasm for his
step-daughter Neneh's Raw Like Sushi album was based solely on familial
pride.
Not so. Like the boffin who has to take apart the latest gadget to see
how it works, Cherry checked out everything he heard to see if there was
anything he could learn from it. Once, while touring Scotland with his
band Nu, he grilled a bagpipe-maker on the principles of piping for a
good two hours before pronouncing himself, regrettably, stumped.
Cherry was born in Oklahoma City and moved in his early teens to Los
Angeles, where he began playing trumpet in the high school band. In
1956, he met Ornette Coleman and became a crucial member of a quartet
which revolutionised jazz, although its music, which many found
impossible to listen to at the time, now sounds conventionally logical.
Having left Coleman, Cherry went on to play with many of the
influential figures in 1960s jazz, including John Coltrane, Sonny
Rollins, Albert Ayler, Steve Lacy, and Archie Shepp before launching his
career as a bandleader with Argentine saxophonist Gato Barbieri, bassist
Henry Grimes, and his colleague from Coleman's quartet, drummer Ed
Blackwell.
Long before the term world music came into vogue, Cherry's fascination
for music beyond jazz took him to Africa, India, and Japan, to study
with the masters. To his trademark pocket trumpet he added wooden
flutes, various percussion instruments, and his beloved doussn'gouni (a
Malinese hunter's guitar) to make music that easily, and often
excitingly, blended ethnic origins with jazz.
He also worked in rock music, with Lou Reed and Talking Heads among
others, and did a stint as a touring Blockhead with Ian Dury's riotous
assembly in the late 1970s.
In recent years Cherry's long history of drug problems began to catch
up with him and his own live performances, although full of spirit and
good intentions, and usually in the company of class musicians such as
tuba player Bob Stewart, could lapse into ponderousness. When focused,
however, he could still produce music full of wisdom, emotion, and charm
and 1990's brilliant album Multikulti, its title reflecting Cherry's
wide musical references, serves as a fitting, if accidental, testament
to his talents.

Music
OK, so maybe it was in an arrangement by Beethoven, but you'd think
baritone Alan Watt could have at least memorised the three verses of
Charlie is my Darling and not kept his gaze buried in a score. After
all, they do run to just two lines each. His partner in this duet,
soprano Mhairi Lawson, had certainly done her homework. Not surprising
then that her singing had much more feeling and verve.
Unfortunately that was the pattern throughout this programme from the
Scottish Early Music Consort under the banner title of Charlie is my
Darling? The question mark deliberately inserted by the programme
planners suggested a thesis to be expounded by their juxtaposition of
airs, dances, and songs with Jacobite connections drawn from collections
of Scottish traditional music and, in particular, Fraser's 1816 volume.
Indeed, an original printing of that work was displayed on the platform
throughout the evening, but the assembled players mostly failed to
resuscitate such venerable pages.
Saviour of the evening was Mhairi Lawson, who lavished care and
affection on the words, her voice thrilling with meaning and emotion,
her performance of Culloden Day a gem that sparkled long after the rest
was forgotten. Occasionally, in some foot-stomping ensemble numbers, a
spark threatened to light up the rather po-faces of the performers, but
then another round of grating tuning of their instruments would cancel
any auditory pleasure that might have lingered.

SCOTLAND'S great and good were out in force in Edinburgh this week for
the opening of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera. The Glasgow
glitterati were in their lime-green Versace suits. The Edinburgh
cognoscenti in diamond-studded Alice bands and ankle-length velvet
skirts. And these were just the men.
What was missing for the assembled hacks, hangers-on and first night
habitues was the absence of any celebritites. Oh, there was TV's
ubiquitous Carol Smillie displaying that neon-sign smile which qualifies
her as Miss Dental Floss or Leader of the Labour Party. Also Kenny Logan
demonstrating splendid body swerves at the post-show champagne party
which guarantees him a place in the national rugby side or as Leader of
the Labour Party.
None of which was surprising for if they could not get any big-named
stars on stage we were unlikely to find them in the auditorium. The
Phantom was Mark McKerracher, apparently a former sports star, but with
as much presence as Gordon Brown at the Comedy Factory. Had it not been
for the mask and make-up his performance would have been as embarrassing
as Lord Nolan attending a private meeting of utility chiefs.
Maybe the stars had fled the country ahead of Stephen Hendry who has
announced that he would depart rather than pay a ''tartan tax'' to
finance Labour's assembly. Certainly whichever way you approach the
Playhouse Theatre you can't but notice Calton Hill on which stands the
classic symmetry of the former Royal High School, once a centre of
academic excellence now earmarked as an institution for political
correctness.
Yet it is easy to see how Scots-born Cameron Mackintosh, the
multi-millionaire producer and impresario, has been able to scoop a
fortune. It is the topicality of his shows. What better in the wake of
the Scottish Constitutional Convention's proposals than a melodrama
whose theme is thwarted love, disillusion and illusion and, more
poignantly, that in the seeds of creation there lies extinction. It is
all there even down to the chorus standing on the grand stairway singing
Masquerade.
Although Alex Salmond would be most people's favourite as the
embittered Phantom stalking the subterranean depths of the assembly, the
role has to go to George Robertson. After all, like the Phantom in
sacrificing all to create the young opera singer, Christine, he has
surrendered everything, proportional representation, the number of
seats, to place the Liberals centre stage. Without him they were
nothing. And if it all collapses around his ears as in the script, then
so be it.
What a pity then that he won't have young Stephen's earnings to
plunder to keep the shaky edifice upright. The five-times snooker
champion rightly believes that an assembly would be a ''disaster'' for
Scotland. He is entitled to ask why, since he already pays 50% in tax on
his annual earnings of #1.2m, he should have to stump up an extra
#36,000 a year. What's in it for him? Another layer of bureacrats? A new
limo for the chief executive? Plush offices for obsequious placemen who
have wangled a seat via party lists? The star's manager Ian Doyle says:
''If Labour wins the next election and introduces a tax raising assembly
there is no doubt that he will be off. Stephen believes that he is
paying a fair whack already and he should not have to pay any more.'' He
will not be alone. How will Gazza, reputedly on #15,000 a week, feel
about stumping up an extra #400 a week just to keep Mr Robertson, Jim
Wallace and their cronies in a style to which they would like to become
accustomed?
The absurdity of the ''tartan tax'' is that it will alienate just
those individuals who we want living and working in Scotland. They
enrich the country by their very presence and by spending their own
money on goods and services create a spin off in jobs and investment.
Give the cash to PC politicians and they spend it on daft schemes like
Glasgay! You don't see them splashing out on majority interests like
heterosexuality. What about a celebration of nymphomania with repeat
showings of Joan Collins' The Stud at the GFT. Readings of Nabakov's
Lolitta at John Smith's. An exhibition of Playboy bunnies at the
McLellan Galleries. A new book on great Scottish lovers. (Admittedly a
slim volume but we could always co-opt Byron, who spent his formative
years here, and there is always oor Rabbie).
But I digress. The ''tartan tax'' will not just affect the super rich.
Everyone of us will have to pay extra. Whether you are a secretary or a
bus driver you can expect an extra tax bill of at least #200 or #300 a
year more than someone doing a similar job south of the Border.
If Mr Robertson believes that the ''tartan tax'' is propaganda then
why insist on the power of being able to raise income tax by up to 3p in
the pound? Why not call the Tory bluff and scrap it?
Because, he says, they might use the power to cut tax. I can hear
snippets of the speech in the Assembly now: ''Owing to the over-generous
block grant we have received from our English colleagues in Westminster,
we have decided that we will not spend the surplus on the National
Health Service, education or flood prevention in Kilmarnock but in
keeping with the Hendry formula, will effect a cut in income tax.''
(Applause from the Labour benches. Waving of order papers).
What will happen then to the disaffected, the disillusioned, the
discontened brought up on the politics of envy? It is contrary to
Labour's modus operandi, convincing the electorate that others will pick
up the bill. Only they won't. During the 60s, under Harold Wilson's
high-tax regime, and then again in the 70s, British stars of stage,
screen and the pop world fled Britain. As a result the burden fell on
the rest of us including those on subsistence wages and thrifty
pensioners who had been able to save a little during their working
lives.
We have suffered for generations from a brain and talent drain
primarily because Scots are mobile, willing to take their talents
elsewhere, not because of lack of love for their country, but to better
themselves. A tax-raising Assembly will merely convince them that
nothing has changed.

THERE are two main reasons why teuchters tend to get a bad press. In
this paper anyway, for one, they tend to set themselves up as figures of
fun: rabid fundamentalists who reject empty modern values like
tolerance, or undestanding (too much bad language on TV? That'll be the
Pope's fault).
There is an inherent flaw in the way we deal with ignorance; if
someone spouts a load of religious intolerance while wearing a football
scarf, he's immediately spotted for the witless bigot he undoubtedly is.
If he happens to be a softly spoken man in a cardigan, we think he's a
God-fearing moralist who's not too scared to speak the truth.
The other reason they get their bad press is perhaps more compelling
-- they deserve it. If the average Highlander is not wasting his time
policing the streets to stop anyone whistling on a Sunday, then he's
stirring up a group of like-minded whingers to gripe on about the cost
of crossing the Skye bridge. If these guys didn't annoy you so much,
you'd have to admire their cheek. Having chosen to live in some cultural
desert, and having previously put up with an expensive, time-consuming
ferry crossing, the Government have forked out the cash -- our cash --
to give them a bridge. Now they have a quicker, cheaper way of getting
to civilisation than ever before. Are they happy? Not a chance.
By the time the ceremonial ribbon has hit the ground, we've got to put
up with letters boasting of a civil disobedience campaign which
organises a mass refusal to pay the tolls after having crossed the
bridge. They can spend as much time as they want telling us that their
glass is half empty rather than half full, but all I know is that it was
our money that bought the drink -- and the glass.
My first experience of the typical Highland mentality was at
university. It was amazing to see a group of fresh-faced 18-year-old
country lads immediately split into two groups after exposure to the
best that Glasgow has to offer. Half of them became foul-mouthed
lecherous drunkards after exposure to pints of lager, while the others
sank into their books, venturing out only to visit the kirk at least
twice on Sunday.
These guys had obviously worked hard at school, but once they left
home, there was no middle ground. The drunkest, the most lecherous, and
the most drug-addled students I ever met were mostly from sheltered
backgrounds somewhere north of Stirling. Simultaneously, the most
reclusive, most pious, most introspective young men I met came from the
same places. I used to wonder what it was about the Highland psyche that
caused their brightest young minds to push the self-destruct button so
insistently as soon as they got off the train at Queen Street.
I visited Stornoway for the first time a few years ago, and saw this
Highland split personality in action on its home turf. On first
inspection, Stornoway is a small, orderly town. If towns have a
character, Stornoway has that of a prim elderly retired schoolmistress,
a personality that many of the inhabitants seemed to mirror. At night,
though, it developed an alter ego. In the pubs there was no evidence of
under-age drinking but that was because all the teenagers were too busy
outside, being sick and falling over.
I can honestly say that I have never, at any time seen such a huge
heaving mass of drunk adolescence as I did that Saturday night, but even
that was but small beer compared to the scene in the Chinese restaurant.
Most Vietnam war movies would show less racism than was on show that
night. Teenagers excuse any behaviour by claiming that there is nothing
to do. On this occasion at least, you know that for one day a week that
is literally true; if there's nothing to do on a Sunday, you might as
well stay in bed with your hangover.
I was reminded of all this when I revisited Lewis to give a talk last
week. It was nice to see the place again, and I even had a good read at
the local paper. The Stornoway Gazette is, like any other small paper,
packed full of stories that become quite funny from an outsider's point
of view. The front page is jammed with exclusives, ''Jobs Boost for
Stornoway'' (six telemarketing jobs) and ''Tyre Slashing Investigated''
were the two big ones. The letters page was full of earnest theological
debate about -- guess what -- Sabbath observance. Isn't it nice to see
the local press deal with the thorny issues of the day?
Having said which, it's all to easy to mock the minutiae of country
life, and it's a fact that there's nothing more annoying than some flash
git coming from across the water, showing off and trying to tell
''backward'' people how they should act -- our footballers certainly
hate it anyway!

There are opportunities aplenty within the European Union. So, asks
Michael Bernard, why aren't we making the most of them to combat
unemployment?
FOR many years now, we in the West have been worried by growing
unemployment, as it spread its cancerous tentacles into all sectors of
our society. At the present time, approximately 25% of those aged under
25 years old resident in Europe -- and we are in Europe -- are currently
unable to find real jobs to provide net incomes in excess of available
unemployment benefits.
This core of dissatisfied young people was brought up by a generation
who led them to expect, that, as long as they performed to the norm,
there would be a job waiting for them. Now even the generation who
raised them cannot expect such security.
One frightening aspect of this situation is that it applies to all
social strata, which means that there is a large section of highly
educated, unfulfilled, and very frustrated intelligentsia sitting
waiting for the previous generation to deliver. Of such things,
revolutions are made.
Why wait for the initiative to be taken from us? Business people and
politicians have just about enough time to rectify the position. But, to
use a metaphor, before we prune a tree to change its shape we must look
at its structure, root and branch, to see how it arrived here and
achieved its current shape.
The Industrial Revolution grew out of one man's ingenuity, his ability
to produce quantities of artefacts which would improve a multiplicity of
others' lives and throw a profit back to him. The village baker and
blacksmith were the obvious precursors to the present day scene. By
chance, the Industrial Revolution, and its precedent, but in some ways
parallel, Agrarian Revolution began in Europe -- The Root of our Tree.
Because of population movement and ties, the United States of America
quickly developed strong seedlings of its own, which, in some ways, grew
bigger and faster than those in Europe. Thus, until the Second World
War, there were two major industrialised, geographically identifiable,
blocs. Mainly because of the Second World War and its aftermath, between
1939 and 1960, further blocs developed out of the USSR and Japan,
redeveloped with Allied funds.
At present there are groups developing in the Pacific Basin and China,
while great changes are occurring within the old USSR. Basically there
are now five or six areas of the world which have economic substance
grown out of Industrial and commercial revolution. Like trees, however,
planted at different times and of differing species, there are great
differences between the structures and sizes of the various parts of
each.
Now let us look at what is perhaps the more philosophical part of the
argument. The Agrarian and Industrial Revolutions were born out of a
need to improve the material and physical conditions of the bulk of
people living in the areas where such changes took place. Once these
immediate needs were satisfied the industrialists looked further afield
to maintain, and increase, their business through commerce with other
areas, thereby creating, in many cases, businesses so large that they
lost sight of the original intentions.
Mammon became the deity to which they responded at the expense of
everything else. In the United Kingdom, with the coming of Thatcherism,
everything was considered sacrificeable to this great god. Most European
and American competitors and/or associated companies followed the new
religion.
To the people in the Western World, for whom the Industrial Revolution
had started as a boon, it had become, in part, a curse. A drive for
profit through efficiency, without thought for social consequence, led
to the massive unemployment we have today.
The next point is that striving for growth at all costs is now leading
us up an even more dangerous path which many industrialists and
politicians do not appear to recognise. The recently ratified GATT
agreement virtually opened up all markets to all comers. That is ''free
trade''.
The problem with free trade is that nothing in the commercial world is
free. One can only truly have free trade if all participants are at an
equal level -- and that is really like believing that the Millennium
will bring the Messiah.
Reverting to our tree analogy, all the industrial ''trees'' in the
world are at different stages.
This is especially true of world expectation of wages and what can be
bought with them in each country or group of countries. What we now also
have is a situation where technologically advanced countries, with
modern industrial practices, instead of selling their products are
selling their technology to others.
Here lies the seed for even greater unemployment. For example, what
can be produced, using similar technology, for four pence an hour in
China requires #3 to #5 per hour in the UK.
What should we, or can we, do about this alarming threat? First, we
must recognise, and indeed demand that our political and industrial
leaders admit, that everyone is not equal. However difficult a concept
that may be, the fact must be accepted. From that point of view, we must
then look at the world.
What do we see? We see a handful of major financial/political
groupings as described above, and a number of minor peripheral countries
or groupings, each with allegiances to one or more of the larger groups.
Each of these larger groupings, namely the United States of America with
Canada, Mexico and peripheral countries, Europe, Japan, China, the
Pacific Basin, and former USSR, each has its own internally acceptable
norms for living standards -- and very different targets to change them.
While this is obviously a global problem, let us home in on the
position as it affects the people of this country and Europe. Being the
first industrialised areas in the world, European countries have
developed over many years a lifestyle and economy with which the
majority of its people are comfortable. (This would also appear to be
the case with the majority of Americans in the USA group.)
But because of our politicians' and industrialists' thirst for power
and growth at all costs, we are now (in the last 20 years or so)
starting to see the effects of uneven wage levels in other areas of the
world on our own economies.
Many of our industries have actually disappeared under the hail of
goods rained down on us from so-called ''under-developed countries''
using technology and machinery we have sold them (in many cases financed
out of our taxes on the never-never, if at all!) and their --
ridiculously non-comparable -- low labour costs. This is what the recent
GATT agreement intends to augment.
Why should we let our politicians, for their transient glory, ruin our
lifestyle?
We as a nation, that is all of us living here in the United Kingdom,
and as a region within Europe, have the technology and the workforce to
give us the capability to produce everything that we Europeans need to
survive and to maintain our standard of living, certainly to the extent
where we can put most of our people back to work before it is too late.
Why not let the ''natural'' politico-economic divisions, which are
described above, each define themselves as trading blocs with their own
''free trade'' area internally? Europe and the American Free Trade Area
have already done just this.
Varying trading agreements and restrictions could be created with each
other as each group may, from time to time, feel necessary. Single area
trading currencies, such as America already has with the dollar and is
proposed for Europe with the Ecu, would also help actually simplify
global trading and in the long term allow for alignment of currency
values as each trading bloc caught up with another.
Countries or blocs which felt it necessary to produce in areas outside
their own would invest, as the Japanese in particular have done, in
those targeted areas, paying local wage levels, and thus not upsetting
local economies. Goods produced in such areas could only be sold into
the new ''home'' market.
The United States has already shown a lead in this direction, in
recent days, with its setting of tariffs against certain Japanese
products allied to its refusal to put up interest rates which would
increase the external value of the dollar to its own traders' detriment.
This is not trade war and the writer is not advocating such an idea.
Our Government should grasp the nettle and take us wholeheartedly into
Europe where we could play our full part in putting our people back to
work in the way suggested, using trade regulation.
Europe has a wealth of knowledge and skills, built up over many
generations. Today one hears tell, on one side, of ''no jobs for the
young'', on an other of ''not enough people trained in industrial
skills'' and yet another ''pay off every one over 50 years old''.
It does not take a genius to realise that if these three elements were
mixed up correctly we could train our youth to carry out most of the
work that enabled their fathers to make everything required, not only to
fight and come through the greatest conflict mankind had ever witnessed,
but to rebuild an even more advanced Europe.
But we must act quickly -- people of 50 do not live forever. We still
have the knowledge of how to build ships. We don't use it because
European politicians think it better to appease the Koreans and let our
shipyards waste away.
Most artefacts, from simple knives and forks to televisions, could all
be manufactured in Europe. Europe can feed itself -- why else do we need
a Common Agricultural Programme? That much maligned system has at least
preserved some of the base for our independence, saving us from the food
dumping prevalent in many parts of the world.
The design of the CAP, though faulty in many particulars, is the way
to fight to preserve a way of life for our next generation. It is a
foundation that should be re-examined for its original intention which
can then be applied to world trade policy.
Making our own manufactured goods and growing our own food for
consumption with Europe at standardised costs and prices will save and
create jobs. Controlling the system will inevitably create clerical
jobs. Even this imposition of a greater bureaucracy will have spin-off
benefits, adding to the overall internal market spending power while
imposing a democratic drag factor on any would-be dictator.
Mankind, through the ages, has demonstrated the impossibility of
controlling, or even understanding the whole world at one time.
Alexander the Great, all the great leaders of Ancient Greece, the Roman
Emperors through to Napoleon, Hitler and Stalin all tried -- and failed.
Equally, man has shown that through co-operation in ''units'' such as
were created in the past -- e g the Roman and Greek empires -- great
progressive strides can be achieved provided the leaders are not allowed
to have everything totally their own way -- that has always led to
destruction.
It is hoped this essay will encourage its Herald readers to urge our
leaders to cement our relationship with the E U, with a view to trading
with the world in the manner described; viz, an E U, as was originally
designed for the purpose of preserving and improving the lot of Our
People.
This is the only way to ensure that our children have as good a future
as we have had a past!

<TEXT>
AN EMPLOYER has been ordered to pay her former childminder
compensation after deciding she no longer required her services.
Mrs Wilma Haston took teacher Mrs Flora Keogh to an industrial
tribunal when told she was not to come back after four years of looking
after Mrs Keogh's children. Mrs Haston claimed she was entitled to a
redundancy payment.
Mrs Keogh, who was going on maternity leave for nine months, denied
she should pay Mrs Haston a redundancy payment, claiming she was
self-employed.
The tribunal heard that Mrs Haston, 43, from Hallglen, Falkirk,
answered Mrs Keogh's advert to look after her child in her own home. At
the time she was a self-employed screen printer.
Mrs Haston also looked after Mrs Keogh's second child when it was born
and was paid a retainer of half her weekly wage during the school
holidays or when Mrs Keogh was on maternity leave. She was paid #64 per
week.
In March this year Mrs Keogh said she would be going on maternity
leave again soon and would be unlikely to return until January next
year.
She told Mrs Haston that she would be unable to pay her half her wages
during that period and suggested she find another job and she would take
her back on again if she was able to return.
The relationship between the two cooled and on March 27, Mrs Haston
was told she would be paid until the end of the month but she was not to
return. She also received a #50 ex-gratia payment.
Mrs Keogh, of Cranshaws Drive, Reading, Falkirk, said she believed
childminders were a self-employed group in society.
Mrs Haston, of Garry Place, Hallglen, claimed she had four years'
service. During any periods when she was laid off she was receiving half
her normal wage. But when Mrs Keogh was to go off on nine months'
maternity leave last April, she was not prepared to pay anything to her,
leaving her redundant.
In their findings the tribunal said they were satisfied Mrs Keogh had
entered into a contract of employment with Mrs Haston for her to act as
a part-time childminder. It was a totally different form of service from
that provided by a registered childminder, who took in children from
various parents into her own premises, which were licensed for that
purpose.
In Mrs Haston's case, she was obliged to work the hours Mrs Keogh
wanted and was subject to the control of Mrs Keogh.
In this case, Mrs Haston had established that she was an employee, the
tribunal added, and ruled she had been made redundant.
The tribunal ruled she should receive a redundancy payment totalling
#398.

CRACKER gone and Taggart (ITV, Thursday) returned -- save, of course,
for the sad fact that the hero of the piece, fictional and actual, is no
longer with us. After the death of Mark McManus, is there a Taggart
without Taggart? Legends, a three-part story of music and murder, has
the look and sound of the real thing. The screen is busy with human
detail; shadows are long and deep; the incidental music beeps and fades
like a flat-lining heart monitor; and every five minutes someone shouts
at someone else. But has a substitute been found for the basilisk stare
and abraded vowels of McManus? Not quite.
The plot is better constructed than that of Cracker, if you discount
the way one crucial witness was connected with the Maryhill plods by the
simple expedient of having him run over by a detective. None of the
cast, led by James Macpherson as the now-promoted Jardine, are expected
to leap the logical chasms over which Robbie Coltrane hurled himself.
What we know of the story -- survivors of sixties pop combo meet messy
ends -- makes some kind of sense.
But what is missing is real emotional resonance. Cracker attempts to
invest murder with meaning (or at least has you feel that the
meaninglessness of it all is being addressed). The foulness of its
homicides lie not in their graphic depiction (cf Hitchcock, shower,
shadow, and just a trickle of blood) but in their arbitrary character.
Murder is the death which nature didn't allow for.
McManus reflected this. You couldn't call what he did acting, just as
you wouldn't call a blank sheet of paper an early draft of War and
Peace.
But he was the screen, stoical as an old tree in a storm, on which
carnage was projected. The performance was going on somewhere behind his
eyes.
In this Taggart, the killings are just the curtain between acts. They
arrive according to a strict, unvarying timetable. They are plot devices
rather than the events for which plot devices ought to exist, and they
maim the tempo of the piece.
That said, all the money is on the screen. The Taggart crew are
experienced and adept now, even a little slick. Their pictures look good
and their staging of the set-pieces admirable. You only wish they would
look a little beyond the help-murder-polis formula to which (and let's
not knock it) the public has become addicted and remember that every
death is different.
Keats might have agreed. His dying dash to Italy was a textbook
example of the romantic flourish. Stricken with TB, aged only 25, and
with nothing to his name but the 1820 volume (bagatelles like Autumn, a
Grecian Urn, A Nightingale, The Eve of St Agnes) the little chap made
one of literature's more stylish career moves. Growing old was not what
proper Romantics did.
Andrew Motion, no slouch of a poet himself, re-enacted the last act
for Omnibus (The Last Journey of John Keats, BBC1, Monday) in an
affecting film that told the story well but explained the craft of verse
better. It is a necessity too often overlooked when television
celebrates a writer (Keats was born 200 years ago this week): to say
what was done is one thing, to say how it was done, why it was done, and
what it amounted to, is very much harder. Motion succeeded where so many
others have failed.
Failure, though, can have its own charm. In Without Walls: Fun With
Wigs (C4, Tuesday), David Baddiel never did quite explain the connection
between the 1660s and the 1960s -- but he did seem to have a lot of fun
dressing up in funny clothes (albeit giving pubic wigs a miss) and
introducing us to some of the literary filth of the period, to the
brief, blistering life of Rochester, and to a philandering royal named
Charles.
Baddiel did well enough, with a lightish touch and a refusal to nudge
us in the ribs too often. But the affinity between Ye Swynging Sixties
and the Doped Decade was always more apparent than real. The relative
positions of women (if that's a joke I'm Samuel Pepys) was touched on
but the crucial influence of religion went unmentioned. Once again,
education fell on the altar of entertainment --  but at least there was
entertainment.
That's more, much more, than you could prise from this reviewer's jaws
without recourse to lifting gear when the subject of Mr Bean is raised.
Rowan Atkinson, having done the world of comedy several favours, owes
us all one after this deeply tiresome (and hugely successful) ascent of
Mount Idiot. Children can be excused, but adults who find physical jerks
like Bean funny need to check the guarantees on their pre-frontal lobes.
Idiots do idiotic things. There is no surprise in it, no unexpected
reversal of nature. It's the ''why'', not the ''what'', that makes a
scene funny, not Bean being endlessly stupid in a hospital queue. The
very best you could say about Goodnight Mr Bean (ITV, Tuesday) is that
it was -- and a promise is a promise, Mr Atkinson --  the last.
No such luck with My Secret Life (BBC2, Wednesday) the latest product
of factual television's obsession with 10-minute films. Once the
preserve of students who had no other choice, these unsatisfactory
affairs have become the repository of ideas that would not sustain 30
minutes even of the Open University's time.
Swinging from the Chandeliers, as this opening piece was called,
involved a nameless couple explaining why partner-swapping beats a trip
to B &amp; Q and does not, furthermore, threaten a marriage the way DIY can.
But these sad, self-deluding people should also have been asked for
their views on voyeurism (worth a look?) for that was all this tawdry
exercise amounted to.
Ex-S: Dracula -- The Count of Cruden Bay (BBC1) and The Strange Show
(ITV) both seized on Hallowe'en as an excuse to examine pagan survivals.
The former, a scholarly exercise by James Drummond, almost succeeded in
making a case for the coastline of Buchan as a crucial influence on
Stoker's novel.
The latter was a kind of semi-serious magazine that took pagan belief
almost (but not quite) seriously. Both had moments of interest; both
could have done without the obligatory ''ghoulish'' sound effects. The
unbelievable has to be believable.
Speaking of which, a prize for the best credits of the week goes to
Prisoner: Cell Block H, in which a psycho biker called Slasher was
played by one ''Slasher''. This, need we add, was the most plausible
thing in the show.

JACK McLEAN is rather naive in his simple comparison of those youths
who require the attention of our social work system and those who don't.
The equation is not simply one of the individual's recent
participation or non-participation in crime.
Those children who avoid crime have already received many blessings in
the shape of a happy family life, or its equivalent. Where caring adults
nurtured their spirits to make them feel good about themselves and the
world.
Little children crushed in their infancy by neglect and a lack of love
will be open to find comfort in some substitute corrupt form. That is
why our authorities attempt to show them, much later in life than nature
intended, that someone does care about them and that their existence is
important.
Such family dysfunction has little regard for economics, hence the
reason there are good and bad people in all spheres of our society.
People will follow the way they are shown in early life when they are
dependent on adults. Those fortunate enough to be subjected to a
positive early development should count their many blessings, and show a
little compassion and consideration for those less fortunate.
There, but for the grace of God, go I.

AFTER reading Sally Magnusson's account of a two-day excursion to
''deepest Argyllshire'' with her brood of five to-be-pitied children, I
am left feeling puzzled and angry (October 30).
Puzzled, because while I broadly believe in the feminist cause (eg,
good nursery provision for those who choose to work while having
children; the right to work even if it isn't essential to boost the
family income, etc), I fear she, in common with many other young women,
wants to ''have her cake and eat it ''.
I imagine she and her husband chose to have five children but, because
of the guilt problem of being a working mother (at present having time
out from being a well-known London-based newsreader and cushioned by her
earnings), she decides to embark on a two-day break at a caravan despite
most of her children being ill and on varying degrees of medication.
Just who are we to feel sorry for, Sally Magnusson or her children? I
think she is plain stupid. Or is she? She turns the ghastly two days
into a supposedly funny article for her current media choice,
journalism.
The article might just pay for the au pair.

THE issue of land reform is an important one in Scotland, a country
perhaps uniquely subject to residual feudalism and international land
speculation. The Danish approach to land ownership is one from which we
could learn.
Farmland in Denmark may only be owned by farmers living on and working
that land. Only foreigners with five years' residence have the right to
buy property, though dispensation can be given earlier.
All housing fits into one of two categories: holiday homes, and
permanent homes. In holiday homes, summer occupancy and occasional
winter use only is allowed, since access roads, sewerage, etc, are
designed for such usage.
Permanent homes must not remain unoccupied. Local councils have the
right to refer tenants to empty housing.
These measures regulate supply and demand for housing. They ensure
realistic property values which reflect local earning possibilities. As
a result, manufacturing industry, which is spread quite evenly
throughout Denmark, often has a competitive edge on big city rivals and
rural communities prosper. Involuntary homelessness is virtually
unknown.
In contrast, just across the German border, Schleswig-Holstein has
some of the worst unemployment rates in western Germany. The lack of
development is partly caused by a perception in the German financial
centres of the area as a peripheral northern peninsula, good only for
seaside holidays.
Massively inflated house prices have depopulated entire west-coast
islands, threatening the survival of the Friesian language. The
displaced islanders must now commute from the mainland to service the
seasonal needs of millionaire holiday home owners.
Regulating the wilder excesses of the market is the key to development
in the Scottish Highlands. Far from bringing in outside wealth,
artificially high property values prevent economically viable
investment.
Restrictions on holiday homes and absentee landlordism could give
people in rural areas control over their own lives and communities.
If adopted by an autonomous or independent Scotland, UK residence
would be a reasonable qualification for buying property. Insisting, as
some do, on Scottish residence would be seen as vindictiveness against a
former partner and could provoke retaliation against Scots in England.
In any case, I am sure that Scotland would, like its Scandinavian
neighbours, exercise its self-determination in a spirit of international
co-operation.

Theatre
A SERIES of four dramatic monologues, interspersed with game-show
antics requiring audience participation, this is a celebration of the
tack 'n' cack-style of the seventies. A Glasgay! event, it is written,
directed, and performed by the ebullient Adrian Howells who clearly
takes great relish in conjuring up taste nightmares which have the
audience howling with laughs of recognition.
Acerbic descriptions of Top of the Pops album covers featuring busty
girls clutching tennis rackets were greeted with wails, while his
enthusiastic evocation of paper dolls and their cut-out wardrobes had
all the chaps in the back row nodding nostalgically.
It's frothy, amusing stuff but very sluggish, with each monologue
stretched beyond the limits of the characterisation. Howell's persona --
a glamrock has-been singer, a campy dancer, an obnoxious old actress,
and a vituperative child star -- are all good visual gags, with their
naff costumes, but they're strictly two-dimensional and lack
originality. The ageing thesp, Dame Dorothy Darling, is merely a pale
imitation of Edna Everage.
However, what humour there is is pumped up by Russell Barr and Ian
Sizeland as able support. Barr's drag appearance as the fussy Scottish
assistant to the singing brat was quite sublime. And between the
monologues Max Sharp offered oodles of light relief as a garish
game-show host, whipping the audience into a frenzy with quick-witted
appreciations of various clapping styles.
But despite the numerous laughs it's a show long on title but short on
invention.

I AGREE with every single comment from Jack McLean on the problems of
today's delinquents.
All decent people to whom I have spoken also agree that the pendulum
has swung too far in the direction of the do-gooders and appeasers.
Only those with the power to legislate and support the necessary
changes can do anything about it, as irresponsible offspring come from
irresponsible parents.
The start of this malaise can be traced back to the cessation of
National Service. Then, any young man with no trade or profession was
called up at 18 years of age, with others following at 21.
These vital years were used to harness and control any aggressive
tendencies and after two years the majority returned to society better
equipped both mentally and physically to be responsible citizens.
Why not reintroduce something along the same lines for the youth of
today? The difference between the cost of such a scheme and dole money
would be an extremely small price to pay for the stability it would
almost certainly produce.
With a substantial reduction in vandalism thrown in, it could actually
result in overall savings.
All too simple, I'm afraid, as any party brave enough to try it would
be committing political suicide. Or would it?

FURTHER to your report on the Culloden Pipes played by Dougie Pincock
(October 28), John MacGregor belonged to the family of Clann an
Sgeulaiche which resided at Druim a' Charraigh (now Drumcharry) near the
ancient abbey of Dull in Glen Lyon.
The school of piping existed from at least the beginning of the
sixteenth century and probably as early as the fourteenth. They were
hereditary pipers to the lairds of MacGregor, during the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries to the Campbells of Glen Lyon, and in the
nineteenth century to the Dukes of Atholl. The tradition appears to have
ended in 1885 when the last piper, Archibald MacGregor, left Drumcharry
for Glen Moidart.
At the time of the '45 the Glen Lyon Campbells were split. One son of
the aged chief, known as the Black Colonel, was an officer in
Cumberland's army but other sons were out with the Jacobites as part of
the Atholl brigade led by Lord George Murray, the ancestor of the
present duke.
John MacGregor was present at the raising of the standard at
Glenfinnan and was appointed personal piper to Prince Charles. He was
part of the prince's staff throughout the rising and therefore would
have been with the prince at Culloden and would not have ''sounded the
charge for the Atholl brigade''.
Though John was wounded in the thigh at Culloden he returned home with
his pipes and died at the age of 81 in 1789, leaving four sons and eight
grandsons -- four of them called John -- and all of them pipers.
At Falkirk in 1781 was held the first recorded piping competition
following the end of the proscription on the use of bagpipes. John (1),
the prince's piper, then aged 73, took third place, playing on the
Culloden Pipes. His son Patrick took first prize.
In 1857 the Culloden Pipes were in the possession of a grandson,
another John MacGregor (5), then aged 72. This John had won the prize
pipes at the Edinburgh piping competition in 1811 playing the Culloden
Pipes. He also played them during the royal visit to Edinburgh in 1822
and before Queen Victoria when she visited Taymouth Castle in 1842.
Before his death in 1861 he gave the Culloden Pipes to the then Duke
of Atholl in exchange for a cottage on the estate. The Prize Pipes
awarded to him in 1811 were presented to the Blair Castle museum in 1980
and are exhibited alongside the Culloden Pipes.

SHERIFF John Wheatley rightly fined a gamekeeper #2500 for being in
possession of a banned deadly poison and for setting eggs poisoned with
a deadly substance in an open area of his employer's estate where
several species of animal or bird could have consumed them (November 1).
However, the real culprits are the landowners (with the honourable
exception of the Earl of Dalkeith) who by tacit or positive agreement
with their staff encourage the poisoning and otherwise illegal killing
of protected (and other) species.
They should be prosecuted in addition to their ''conscientious and
responsible'' gamekeepers.
The Scottish Landowners' Federation is pressing for a cull of
protected raptors. Why? Isn't there enough killing already?

I FOUND Alf Young's article on taxing landfill sites interesting
(October 27). However, since the majority of construction in this
country is government funded, through its various agencies, the
additional costs will be charged to the public purse. Therefore, like
VAT in the construction industry, most of the sums involved will end up
at source, ie, no revenue for the Exchequer -- 100% of the VAT collected
by us is paid by the Government only to be returned to the Government.
If this tax is indeed part of the ''Government's greener instincts''
surely it should be restricted to toxic and other harmful waste which
would limit its impact on the construction industry. After all, it is
the material from construction sites that is generally used to cover up
and contain most of the refuse tipped in landfill sites.

IT is interesting that Michael Fry nowhere uses the words England or
English (November 1). In his apologia for the concept of Britain and in
attacking Scottish self-affirmation at a political level he omits the
preponderant factor in the whole equation, ie, English nationalism.
What is wrong with Britain is England and the English hegemony in
Scotland. Given the status quo, this situation is set to continue for a
very long time. Most English politicians are happy with the concept of
Britain so long as they are convinced that Britain means England. When
their concept is challenged they turn decidedly stroppy.
Now, more Scots are becoming aware of all this and want out of a
suffocating union with a neighbour which is insensitive and still, as
far as Scotland is concerned, imperialistic.
For me, Fry's ''never mind the quality feel the width'' approach is
totally misleading.

MARTIN Blackshaw argues, ''These bishops knew very well that the Roman
Catholic Church neither encouragednor condoned the evil genocide
perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jewish race'' (October 24).
That may be so but all that is required for evil to succeed is for
good men to do nothing.
He cannot hide behind the robes of a few outraged and brave clerics
who during the war years were prepared to do something positive against
evil.
These men, though, cannot absolve the Catholic Church of its
responsibility for centuries of institutionalised anti-Semitism.
The Nuremberg Laws of the Third Reich were not dissimilar to all the
laws pertaining to Jews in the Papal States up to their dissolution in
1870.
Martin Blackshaw also writes, ''There are different degrees of evil
acts for which God demands justice and repentance'', charging Jews with
deicide and the Germans with genocide.
He concludes, ''The Catholic Church calls on the perpetrators and
supporters of both crimes to repent.'' Perhaps he should look at the
church's history of intolerance, starting with Pope Paul IV's Bull, Com
Nimis Absurdum -- the blueprint of anti-Semitism -- before apportioning
blame for crimes, and then recognise from whom repentance should be
sought.

NEW YORK: O J Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark has denied a magazine
report that she and prosecution colleague Christopher Darden are
planning to marry, although newspapers say their alleged romance is a
hot topic in the Los Angeles district attorney's office. Clark, 42, is
fighting her estranged husband for custody of their two young sons.

YOU report on the Scottish Council for Spastics' name change to
Capability.
As you have stated, it is hoped that the new name will create a
positive attitude towards people with disabilities, yet we were
surprised that you said ''those who suffer cerebral palsy and other
handicaps''.
We find the use of these terms unacceptable and outdated in 1995. As
people with disabilities ourselves we feel that to say ''people with
cerebral palsy'' or ''people with disabilities'' creates a more positive
image.

BOXING manager Frank Maloney last night claimed that the English legal
system had ''let down'' Lennox Lewis in his battle to establish his
credentials as No 1 challenger for the World Boxing Council's world
heavyweight crown.
Lewis failed yesterday in his High Court injunction to stop the WBC
sanctioning the fight between champion Frank Bruno and Mike Tyson, who
was installed as mandatory contender ahead of Lewis following his first
comeback by the WBC nearly a year ago.
Not only did it order Lewis to fight Lionel Butler in a final
eliminator, but decreed that Tyson would move back to the No 1 position
after his first warm-up fight, although it took that step ahead of
schedule.
Lewis beat Butler in the eliminator which, insisted his handlers,
should have given him a direct route to the title which Bruno won two
months ago.
Lewis issued the injunction in an attempt to stop the WBC sanctioning
Bruno's lucrative defence against Tyson.
Lewis's manager Maloney, who intends to continue their battle to
establish his charge as No 1 contender in the United States next week,
said: ''We feel let down by the system.
''However, it is only the first round and the next legal round will
start in the United States next week.''
Mr Justice Rattee set aside leave to serve proceedings outside the
jurisdiction on the WBC, a Puerto Rican corporation.
In his judgment, the judge said Lewis's claim was made on the basis
that he was entitled to have the WBC rules applied as he was the
official contender -- but this meant all the rules applied to him, and
not just those that he chose to be bound by.
But Mr Maloney said: ''For technical reasons, the court decided that
the English courts were not the appropriate forum in which to deal with
any disputes between Lennox Lewis and the WBC.''
Bruno's promoter, Mr Frank Warren, added: ''Frank Bruno would like to
invite the judge in the case to the fight. He beat Lennox Lewis in court
today and he believes he is going to beat Mike Tyson in the ring.''

STAGECOACH has been warned about its operations in Ayrshire following
its merger with Kilmarnock-based bus company A1 Services earlier this
year.
A Monopolies and Mergers Commission report published yesterday said
the Perth-based bus company's acquisition operated against the public
interest. It concluded that Stagecoach's strategy was to increase its
share of bus services in Ayrshire, weakening competition from existing
operators.
The report prompted renewed calls from both Labour and the SNP for
re-regulation of the bus industry in Scotland, with a plea to Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth to put bus services back in the hands of the
new unitary authorities.
Although the MMC said it was not convinced a sell-off was necessary,
Competition and Consumer Affairs Minister Jonathan Evans is to ask the
Director General of Fair Trading to seek a number of undertakings aimed
at maintaining competition.
Mr Evans said: ''The MMC believed that, as a result of the weakening
in competition, Stagecoach can be expected to seek increased profits by
raising fares and reducing levels of service. They concluded on balance
that the merger is against the public interest.''
However, in response to the criticisms, Stagecoach chairman Brian
Souter said that the company did not believe the merger operated against
the public interest ''as we have demonstrated in our other Scottish
companies over the past six years by reduced fares in real terms,
improved service qualities, investing heavily in new buses and
innovating with new routes''.
He also highlighted a section in a report which identified substantial
benefits arising from the acquisition of A1's Ayrshire bus services.
Since the #4.25m take-over in January, Stagecoach has spent #2.5m on 21
new double-deckers and bought a further 21 second-hand buses.
These latest recommendations over Stagecoach fares, routes and
timetables come in the wake of a number of unfavourable MMC reports over
the company's operations this year. In June, the firm was accused of
''predatory and deplorable'' actions after it lost out in the sale of
the Darlington Transport Company, but its Newcastle-based Busways
subsidiary recruited most of DTC's drivers and began running free
services. The successful bidder, Yorkshire Traction, subsequently pulled
out of the sale and the company was wound up within days.
Responding to yesterday's MMC report, Labour's transport spokesman and
MP for Cunninghame North, Brian Wilson, said that, when Stagecoach aimed
for a local monopoly, it usually succeeded. ''We desperately need a
return to regulation of the bus industry, instead of this farce of the
MMC chasing Stagecoach round the country by which time they have moved
on to somewhere else.''
SNP transport spokesman Keith Brown said that the Government's
dogmatic adherence to the free market had resulted in higher prices and
reduced services.
''The reorganisation of Scottish local government provides Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth with the golden opportunity to practise what
he's been preaching by returning to local authorities the ability to
regulate and provide bus services in their local areas.''
Stagecoach said it would now study the undertakings outlined in the
report.

GENE therapy may one day help doctors to fix ailing hearts,
cardiologists believe, after an experiment with an engineered gene was
successful in altering the beat of heart muscle cells. The trial, on rat
tissue, could be a preliminary step towards an effective treatment for
heart failure and irregular heartbeats.
Heart specialists at Johns Hopkins worked with the gene of a fruitfly
which creates special openings in the outer walls of cells that admit
electrically charged particles which, among other effects, stimulate
cell contraction.
They changed the fruitfly's gene so it produced ion channels that
stayed open longer. They then spliced the new gene into an adenovirus (a
common cold virus) and exposed rat heart cells in the lab dish to the
virus. Carried into cells by the virus, the new gene produced altered
ion channels that allowed more charged particles to enter the cells.
The Hopkins scientists next injected the new ion channel viral gene
directly into newborn rats and the gene's products showed up in the
rat's heart cells. Advances in the technique could not only change heart
rates but also stabilise the electrical properties of hearts susceptible
to fatal irregularities of cardiac rhythm.
''What we've done shows that it's possible to alter the action
potential of cells both in the lab and in a living animal through the
use of recombinant adenovirus technology,'' says Professor Eduardo
Marban who led the research.
''With appropriate targeting, such a strategy may be useful in gene
therapy not only of arrhythmias, but also of seizure disorders and
muscle diseases -- any disorder marked by an electrical impulse.
''We've shown that gene therapy doesn't only have a future for very
rare genetic disorders, but also may one day be a treatment for common
disorders such as arrhythmias and heart disease.''

TRADES unionists in Shetland last night claimed that the Bulgarian
government had welched on a deal with 27 crewmen from the
Bulgarianklondyker Rotalia.
The men ended a three month sit-in and strike on the ship at Lerwick
in April. They were paid half their claimed wage arrears and flown home
with promises that they would not be persecuted. The balance of their
pay was due to be paid by October 30.
But Mr Colin McKay, a spokesman for Shetland Trades Council, said the
men had not been paid by the deadline and they now faced an imminent
court appearance for ''crimes against the state''.
Mr McKay said: ''We are asking our Euro-MP, Mrs Winnie Ewing, and
Northern Isles Liberal MP Jim Wallace to take this matter up with the
Bulgarian authorities.''
Mr McKay said he was particularly worried about two sailors who are
seeking political asylum.

A REPORT by Tayside police is to be sent to the procurator-fiscal's
office following their investigation into allegations that a teacher
physically assaulted a pupil at St Dominic's Roman Catholic primary
school in Crieff, Perthshire.
Tayside region's education committee yesterday confirmed that the
teacher was on paid leave while it investigated the allegations.
The accusations have been made by a parent. Police officers
interviewed several pupils in the course of their inquiries.
Parents of children at the school are understood to be divided in
their views of the teacher. Some have offered their support, but others
have spoken of removing their children from the school.
Earlier this year the teacher was presented with several complaints by
a school board member. A report from Scottish Office inspectors also
gave details of poor staff-parent relationships.

* US NUCLEAR experts have developed a new system aimed at reducing the
volume of radioactive waste. Plutonium-contaminated salts are loaded
into a crucible and heated to more than 1800F, under vacuum. The
contaminated salts vaporise leaving plutonium-oxide powder in the
crucible. Most bulk residues are converted into low-level wastes with
less than 100 billionths of a curie of radioactivity per gram. It cuts
transuranic salt waste volumes by 90% and could save vast amounts of
money in storage and safety costs.
* SCIENTISTS at universities in Oxford and California have uncovered
the key to how the most common and deadly species of human malaria
parasite escapes immune detection and causes a lethal syndrome of coma
and death. Each year, up to 500 million people develop malaria and up to
a million die, according to the World Health Organization. The
scientists have newly identified a family of thousands of genes for
proteins which allow the parasite to survive in red blood cells and
enable the infected cells to attach to blood vessel walls in the brain,
causing the most serious complications of malaria -- coma and death. The
discovery may lead to the identification of molecular targets for drugs
or vaccines.

Carole Morin describes
time-honoured ways of fixing that certain smile.
LIP paint has been around since Lucrezia Borgia, but it was the
creation of the metal lipstick container by Maurice Levy in 1915 that
''touched off a great international passion for lipstick''. The Face of
the Century by Kate de Castelbajac is packed with fascinating facts like
that. It tells the story of make-up from Catherine de Medici to Nadja
Auermann, and is the perfect gift for every man who feels threatened by
clever, glamorous women.
Lipstick has always been a matter of life and death.
This affair between seduction and destruction is personified by Lana
Turner when she dies with her lipstick in her hand in The Postman Always
Rings Twice. Real-life associations are just as violent.
Mad Matthew, my high school boyfriend, shot himself soon after I
stained his favourite white shirt with Firebrand. (The school priest
failed to convince me there was no connection.) Cult novelist Anna Kavan
died in her bathroom with ''50 lipsticks the same colour and enough
heroin to kill the street''.
The same colour? Kavan's lipsticks may have looked the same to the
policeman who found her, but there is only one colour for the insanely
sexy mouth. Even in a black and white movie, the heroine's lips are
always scarlet. You can spend your life, like Diana Vreeland, addicted
to red -- searching for the ideal. Sampling Chanel's Rouge Imaginaire,
MAC's Russian Red, or Estee Lauder's Perfect Silent Red at lipstick
counters, living in hope of finding the rouge of your noir dreams.
Cyber-rave writer Jeff Noon likes ''a muted crimson, bright but not
too brazen'' and that's just on his girlfriend. Professor Lorna Sage,
Dean of the University of East Anglia, likes her red ''the colour of
recently dried blood, not black but certainly not orange or
purple-tinged. My lipsticks lead such hard lives that the name wears off
the bottom so each time I have to search for the undead colour again.
It's made by very cheap people like Rimmel and sometimes disappears
totally, but always turns up just as I've given up hope''.
Lipstick is an emotional subject. Dentist Martin Bright is ''disturbed
by the idea of intelligent women wearing red lipstick''. Bright was
brought up by new-hippie parents who taught him that ''make-up is stupid
and slaggy''. Make-up and intelligence are as old a combination as
Colette and the cosmetic shop she opened in 1932 on the Rue de
Miromesnil.
Bored with being a poor genius, Colette was keen to ''play the
saleswoman''. She put a sign on her wall inquiring, Are You For Or
Against The ''Second Profession'' Of The Writer?
Some boys, like James Brown, editor of Loaded, can't talk about
lipstick on the telephone. When asked his favourite lip colour, James
replied: ''You're frightening me. Why do you want to know that?''
Another Loaded lad, Mart Deeson, is keen on the kiss-proof formula:
''I like tarty red but I don't want it to come off all over me.'' Deeson
is the only boy who confessed to being in love with lip gloss. ''Mmm, as
wet and shiny as possible. What are you doing tonight?''
Invented in 1930 by Max Factor so that actors didn't need to keep
moistening their lips, gloss is the ultimate make-up mistake. Unless you
want to look like Joan Collins, or a melting ice-lolly.
Poor Princess Diana's biggest problem is her shiny pink lips. Girls
who wear pink are not usually the full banana, but coated with gloss a
pink mouth is the style mistake of the century. To win the divorce war,
Diana needs to dye her frosted hair dark and become addicted to MAC's
Viva Glam.
The MAC shop in King's Road is easy driving distance from Kensington
Palace, as is Harvey Nichol's -- the only other venue in Britain to sell
Make-Up Art Cosmetics.
Every Saturday afternoon, the MAC counters are mobbed by smart
teenagers spending their pocket money on Viva Glam and Russian Red. Even
beauty editors have to fight their way through -- MAC doesn't give away
samples. The Canadian company sells a thousand lipsticks a day in
London, and is easily winning the nineties Lipstick War. Rivals Chanel
and Estee Lauder are lucky to sell 200 lipsticks a week.
Part of MAC's charm is its exclusiveness which attracts both make-up
junkies and puritans. The profits of Viva Glam are donated to Aids
charities, enabling MAC to capture not only glampuss's but sour hippies
who would have to avoid cosmetics without that worthy excuse to buy. But
the main reason for MAC's success is a selection of seductive matte
shades.
Alistair Strachan, a student from Brighton, was queueing with the
girls in Harvey Nichol's last Saturday to buy ''lipstick for my
girlfriend -- honest. OK, I wear make-up myself -- occasionally -- but
only to look good, not to make some tedious gender statement''.
The Babe rules in Brighton, but Alistair predicts the end of babedom
because ''there are too many fat, ugly girls failing to be babes''.
But the babe doesn't die, she just changes her hairdo. Through the
decades make-up junkies have always had more fun. Red lipstick has gone
from tarty, to movie star glam, to arty. Worn without mascara, a red
mouth can be provocatively innocent.
In an aesthetic world where looks matter, a new lipstick can make you
want to go on living. Beauty comes as much from the outside as the
inside. It's easier to mock the relationship between the trivial and the
profound than to understand. Sometimes when I buy a new lipstick, I
think of mad Matthew and wonder. Would he still be alive if the stain on
his shirt had been Barbie-doll pink?

A SCHOOLBOY was strangled by the strap of his bag after it caught on a
nail as he climbed a wall, an inquest heard yesterday.
Conrad Butcher, 12, was hanged when the heavy bag stuck on one side of
the wall as he took a short-cut home from school.
The inquest, at Uxbridge, Middlesex, heard that the boy -- one of a
set of triplets -- often climbed over the wall.
0 Conrad's mother, Mrs Maria Butcher, of Mill End, Rickmansworth,
Hertfordshire, said: ''There is a wall bordering the Uxbridge Road where
he got off the bus. He would throw his bag over and climb over after
it.''
A friend of the youngster saw his body dangling from the bag strap in
a car park at the end of the road after the tragedy on September 18.
West London coroner John Burton heard that the 10-year-old went for
help, and a neighbour ran out and pulled Conrad off the wall.
Consultant pathologist Robert Chapman, who carried out a post-mortem
examination, said death was due to asphyxiation caused by hanging.
The inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death.

THE teenage heir to an eighteenth-century castle and multi-million
pound fortune is fighting a last-ditch battle against deportation.
Jay Khadka was rescued from poverty in Nepal by computer tycoon
Richard Morley, 53, to honour an extraordinary pact with his dying
father. The millionaire promised to care for the child after the boy's
father, Basu, saved his life in a climbing accident in 1984.
The father, who suffered from a serious heart disease, trekked for
three days to find a phone when Mr Morley punctured a lung at 17,500ft
in the Annapurna mountains.
Mr Morley returned to Nepal six years later after Basu's death to find
the son living on the streets, working in a stone mine and as a goat
herd. He brought the 14-year-old back to England and raised him as his
own son at Clearwell Castle in the Forest of Dean.
Now the boy faces expulsion because he obtained only a visitor's visa
which has not been extended. Mr Morley was unable to adopt him five
years ago because he had to claim the boy was older than 18 to get him
out of Nepal.
The teenager was educated at home, reading English classics and Greek
philosophy, and studying fine arts.
Mr Morley, who has no children of his own, has made him heir to the
family fortune, which also includes a flat in Bloomsbury, London, a home
in Margate and heirlooms.
Mr Morley, managing director of London-based computer firm IT
Consultancy, said the boy was no financial burden on the country.
He added: ''To throw him out of this country is against humanity. It's
ludicrous.
''He would be thrown back into an alien culture where he would be
isolated.''
The boy said: ''It's unfair. The Home Office has never seen me. I will
have to leave friends and family I have grown up with.''
They are fighting the deportation on the grounds of ''exceptional
circumstances on compassionate grounds'' Neighbours have raised a
petition against the deportation.
Mr Morley, whose wife Susan died in 1992, has promised to leave the
country with the boy if he is ordered out. ''Whatever happens to him,
will happen to us.''
In May 1991, he applied to change the visa to one of ''indefinite
leave to remain''.
It was refused in June 1992 with 14 days to appeal but he failed to
meet the deadline because he was recovering from an illness.
He appealed against the decision but in December 1992 he was told the
appeal would not be heard.
The deportation notice was issued in early 1994 and an appeal made.
Home Secretary Michael Howard will shortly make the final decision on
whether the appeal can be heard.
A Home Office spokeswoman said: ''When foreign nationals come over
there is a procedure to be followed.''

Stephen McGinty imagines a fantasy future and the eve of Stephen
Hendry's departure under a ''tartan tax'' cloud.
AS if by magic the future appeared. A Scottish parliament was in.
Stephen Hendry was out. The decision by the snooker player to flee the
country rather than dip into his pockets for another 3p in the pound in
taxes has caused controversy in Scotland. The final of the Regal Masters
in Motherwell is a sell-out, populated by Labour, Nationalists and
Tories. But it's the accountants, suits exchanged for advertising
T-shirts, who sit, heads high, in the front row.
The reigning world champion has exchanged snooker's standard bow-tie
and waistcoat for a new number by Versace; purple pants paired with a
neon blue silk shirt, topped with a furry angora sweater from sponsors
The Sweater Shop. His manager, Ian Doyle, rubs his neck, while the
former secretary of state for Scotland, Michael Forsyth, as new adviser
on the politics of potting, eyes the opposition.
Hamish McCue is the new Scots darling. The 18-year-old Highlander
picked up his first cue in a young offender's institute; at first to
threaten the guards then to defeat them on the table. His total
rehabilitation and sporting success, combined with a natty line in
tartan waistcoats, has seen his star rise. Now in 1999, he is the prick
to Hendry's conscience and the barrier to a 10th world championship.
Commentary, of course, by ''Whispering'' Ted Lowe.
''This is not the crucible today, it's a cauldron -- a cauldron of
emotions: anger, sadness, loss, relief. How can you not be touched by
the bright face of Mandy Hendry -- golden brown from seeking new
sunshine homes. And saddened by the nationalist faces painted, not just
in grief, but by blue crayons with little white crosses.
''The most depressed are the entire Hearts team who have turned up,
having made the decision to field the ballboys, to pay tribute to a
loyal fan who has now turned. And the news just in from Tynecastle, the
ball boys are winning.''
A few changes have been introduced by the British game's new sponsors,
the resurrected Barings bank, to accentuate the money involved. The
yellow ball is now golden, and white has been replaced by silver. The
pockets are the little plastic money bags that always break.
Hendry breaks and wins the first few frames before McCue recovers.
Seeing snooker as a contact sport he begins to whisper in his opponent's
ear as they pass to and from the table.
''How can you desert your country, man?''
''Money! I'm already paying about half my salary!''
''So, if you earn a million a year, you'll pay #500,000 tax, right?''
''Right!''
''Another 3p in the pound is #30,000 -- that's just the price of a new
motor, and you're leaving us for that?''
''It's the principle!''
''My arse -- it's the money!''
The scoreboard reads Hendry 5, McCue 4.
Later McCue comments: ''This country made you!''
Hendry says: ''Aye, I've been a decent ambassador long enough! Look, I
played, I won, I'm off!''
''It'll not be the same out there, down south, abroad, wherever.''
''I know.''
The score is now even as Hendry settles down for a black ball
shoot-out. Away from the microphone Ted clears his throat, as the
audience wrestles to get comfortable in their seats.
''As Hendry lines up for the final black the crowd is hushed. There is
only the slight crinkle of crisps to put off the nine-time champ from an
easy ball. But the cue is wavering, his head is shaking, tears are
forming. He just can't do it.
''The green baize table that has brought a casino's wealth and so much
success has become a rack. An instrument of torture. What we are
witnessing here is not the final match of a boy wonder, heading to a
warmer climate, but a scene from a movie.''
In a reversal of Mel Gibson's role in Braveheart, Hendry raises his
cue to the strip lighting and cries: ''You can take my land, my house in
West Lothian, my plot near Gleneagles. You can take my country. But
you'll never take an extra 3p in my pound!''
Turning back to the table he plays his last shot, silver ball cracking

''And he's missed. It's incredible,'' shouts ''Whispering'' Ted as
McCue hits the table to hammer the black home. The centre erupts with
noise. McCue's fans are celebrating.
Mandy Hendry leaps from her seat towards her husband, pushing manager
Ian Doyle into the lap of Michael Forsyth. Both clatter to the floor
only to rise then fall under a stampede of fans resplendent in tartan
trousers and flying saltires.
At the head of the queue is publicist Max Clifford who moves in with a
bevy of beauties suggesting a victory tour in Marbella -- perhaps he'd
like to stay awhile. McCue nods.
The umpteenth chorus of Flower of Scotland is still ringing in
Hendry's ears as his entourage drives away, depressed, in a convoy of
Bentleys and Ferraris.
The wind blows a newspaper across the windshield, its headline
announcing the Scottish parliament's first budget with no tax increase.
Hendry flicks the wipers and drives down the road, on towards Carlisle.

As Poland faces the first round in its presidential elections, Bill
Wallace predicts that whatever the result, the country will continue
towards political and economic maturity and urges the Russians to take
note
Democratise your politics, marketise your economy, and your world will
be wonderful, too.
THIS was the formula that the West transmitted to the communist world
as it began to fray round the edges in the 1980s. But 10 years after
Gorbachev came to power he is little more than a retired, half-respected
figure in a Russian Federation that, in area, comprises only
three-quarters of the former Soviet Union and, in prosperity, little
more than half.
And Yeltsin, who succeeded him on a promise to save Russia from
autocracy and bankruptcy, looks out from his sick-bed at political
in-fighting that might just produce a communist parliament next month
and a military president next year, and at an economy in which the
majority of people will be happy if they can scrape through another
winter. Reality can hardly be called wonderful. Surely the formula was
false.
Fifteen years ago, it was another man, the little shipyard electrician
Lech Walesa, who was the hope of the West and of his own country,
Poland. He saw, from the inside, the need for political and economic
change and was prepared to put his liberty at stake to achieve it. Yet
in the first stage of the presidential election tomorrow he runs the
risk of losing the office he has held since 1990. In the event, he has
not been the most democratic of presidents, and there are many Poles who
are financially worse off than they were before he became a national
figure.
Belatedly he is mending his ways and he may win, if not until the
second round of voting in two weeks. Yet oddly enough, whether he does
or not, Poland will continue along the path to political maturity and
economic prosperity in such a way as to suggest that in due course its
next-door neighbour, Russia, might be able to do the same.
That Walesa's future should be in doubt is partly his own fault. At
the moment of his greatest triumph in 1989, when he manoeuvred the
communists out of power in Poland and triggered the anti-communist
revolution throughout Eastern Europe, he decided not to become Prime
Minister and not to challenge the incumbent President, General
Jaruselski. He would guide his country from the sidelines.
But in a post-Soviet, open society this proved impossible, So in 1990
Walesa stood for the presidency and won. But despite the fact that he
did so with a weak majority over an outside candidate, he was soon
trying his hardest to increase his own powers against those of the
government and of the parliament, particularly in matters pertaining to
the economy, foreign policy and defence. In five years he has vetoed
parliamentary decisions almost 30 times.
Recently, too, he chose to associate with unrepresentative advisers
and failed to distance himself deftly enough from some generally
unacceptable political attitudes. This lowered his esteem in the eyes of
the public and politicians; and by this summer opinion polls gave him
little more than 10% of the popular vote.
Yet part of the fault lies elsewhere. Once in power, Solidarity
exercised the almost suicidal right of all reformers, including those in
Russia, to divide among themselves on often trivial matters. The
inevitable result was that some of their factions failed to secure any
seats and that, almost by default, the former communists won a coalition
majority in the guise of socialists and agrarians.
This put Walesa in the position of having to oppose many governmental
and parliamentary actions as a matter of principle. He had not fought
against the autocracy of the communists in the 1980s to see their 1990s
successors introduce a scheme of mass privatisation that might allow
them to repurchase state property.
It is his relighting of the anti-communist torch that has just raised
his opinion poll standing to 26%. If the old Solidarity could be
reunited, his rating would be much higher. But he still trails the 32%
of ex-communist candidate, Alexander Kwasniewski.
This causes shivers outside as well as inside Poland. However,
Kwasniewski, leader of the Democratic Left Alliance, is a much-reformed
communist. On the model of socialist parties in the West he accepts the
ballot and supports privatisation of much of the economy. He courts
foreign investment and wants to expedite Poland's entry into the
European Union. Youngish, lively and articulate, he clearly appeals to
modernisers.
But his support also includes at least some of those, in addition to
dispossessed communist bureaucrats, who are suffering from economic
restructuring, the unemployed, the poorly-paid, the pensioners and the
students. So either on November 5 or 19 he might replace Walesa.
Yet, what is significant for Poland is that both the main presidential
contenders accept its post-1989 change of direction. At the top, the
argument is about the pace of change and the direction of hurt. Among
voters, the issue -- against the background of the past 15 years -- is
whom to trust.
In the meantime, Poland's economy surges forward. Gross domestic
product grew 5% in 1994 and it is firmly on course to grow 6% in 1995,
the highest rate in Eastern Europe. In 1994 inflation fell from 35% to
32%; it is now approaching the lower 20s. In June the country got what
is called a Moody's rating, good enough to be able to issue $250m worth
of Eurobonds and watch them being snapped up by foreigners.
What is emerging as a result of effort and experience is a partly
marketised economy. And as is the almost standard experience now in the
West, mixed economies, not the pure market economies of the propaganda
formula, can do reasonably well despite the flaws in the supposedly pure
democracies in which they have to operate.
And who knows, in a year or two this may be the pattern, not merely in
Poland or in other Eastern European countries, but in a currently
troubled Russia as well.

Carole Morin describes
time-honoured ways of fixing that certain smile.
LIP paint has been around since Lucrezia Borgia, but it was the
creation of the metal lipstick container by Maurice Levy in 1915 that
''touched off a great international passion for lipstick''. The Face of
the Century by Kate de Castelbajac is packed with fascinating facts like
that. It tells the story of make-up from Catherine de Medici to Nadja
Auermann, and is the perfect gift for every man who feels threatened by
clever, glamorous women.
Lipstick has always been a matter of life and death.
This affair between seduction and destruction is personified by Lana
Turner when she dies with her lipstick in her hand in The Postman Always
Rings Twice. Real-life associations are just as violent.
Mad Matthew, my high school boyfriend, shot himself soon after I
stained his favourite white shirt with Firebrand. (The school priest
failed to convince me there was no connection.) Cult novelist Anna Kavan
died in her bathroom with ''50 lipsticks the same colour and enough
heroin to kill the street''.
The same colour? Kavan's lipsticks may have looked the same to the
policeman who found her, but there is only one colour for the insanely
sexy mouth. Even in a black and white movie, the heroine's lips are
always scarlet. You can spend your life, like Diana Vreeland, addicted
to red -- searching for the ideal. Sampling Chanel's Rouge Imaginaire,
MAC's Russian Red, or Estee Lauder's Perfect Silent Red at lipstick
counters, living in hope of finding the rouge of your noir dreams.
Cyber-rave writer Jeff Noon likes ''a muted crimson, bright but not
too brazen'' and that's just on his girlfriend. Professor Lorna Sage,
Dean of the University of East Anglia, likes her red ''the colour of
recently dried blood, not black but certainly not orange or
purple-tinged. My lipsticks lead such hard lives that the name wears off
the bottom so each time I have to search for the undead colour again.
It's made by very cheap people like Rimmel and sometimes disappears
totally, but always turns up just as I've given up hope''.
Lipstick is an emotional subject. Dentist Martin Bright is ''disturbed
by the idea of intelligent women wearing red lipstick''. Bright was
brought up by new-hippie parents who taught him that ''make-up is stupid
and slaggy''. Make-up and intelligence are as old a combination as
Colette and the cosmetic shop she opened in 1932 on the Rue de
Miromesnil.
Bored with being a poor genius, Colette was keen to ''play the
saleswoman''. She put a sign on her wall inquiring, Are You For Or
Against The ''Second Profession'' Of The Writer?
Some boys, like James Brown, editor of Loaded, can't talk about
lipstick on the telephone. When asked his favourite lip colour, James
replied: ''You're frightening me. Why do you want to know that?''
Another Loaded lad, Mart Deeson, is keen on the kiss-proof formula:
''I like tarty red but I don't want it to come off all over me.'' Deeson
is the only boy who confessed to being in love with lip gloss. ''Mmm, as
wet and shiny as possible. What are you doing tonight?''
Invented in 1930 by Max Factor so that actors didn't need to keep
moistening their lips, gloss is the ultimate make-up mistake. Unless you
want to look like Joan Collins, or a melting ice-lolly.
Poor Princess Diana's biggest problem is her shiny pink lips. Girls
who wear pink are not usually the full banana, but coated with gloss a
pink mouth is the style mistake of the century. To win the divorce war,
Diana needs to dye her frosted hair dark and become addicted to MAC's
Viva Glam.
The MAC shop in King's Road is easy driving distance from Kensington
Palace, as is Harvey Nichol's -- the only other venue in Britain to sell
Make-Up Art Cosmetics.
Every Saturday afternoon, the MAC counters are mobbed by smart
teenagers spending their pocket money on Viva Glam and Russian Red. Even
beauty editors have to fight their way through -- MAC doesn't give away
samples. The Canadian company sells a thousand lipsticks a day in
London, and is easily winning the nineties Lipstick War. Rivals Chanel
and Estee Lauder are lucky to sell 200 lipsticks a week.
Part of MAC's charm is its exclusiveness which attracts both make-up
junkies and puritans. The profits of Viva Glam are donated to Aids
charities, enabling MAC to capture not only glampuss's but sour hippies
who would have to avoid cosmetics without that worthy excuse to buy. But
the main reason for MAC's success is a selection of seductive matte
shades.
Alistair Strachan, a student from Brighton, was queueing with the
girls in Harvey Nichol's last Saturday to buy ''lipstick for my
girlfriend -- honest. OK, I wear make-up myself -- occasionally -- but
only to look good, not to make some tedious gender statement''.
The Babe rules in Brighton, but Alistair predicts the end of babedom
because ''there are too many fat, ugly girls failing to be babes''.
But the babe doesn't die, she just changes her hairdo. Through the
decades make-up junkies have always had more fun. Red lipstick has gone
from tarty, to movie star glam, to arty. Worn without mascara, a red
mouth can be provocatively innocent.
In an aesthetic world where looks matter, a new lipstick can make you
want to go on living. Beauty comes as much from the outside as the
inside. It's easier to mock the relationship between the trivial and the
profound than to understand. Sometimes when I buy a new lipstick, I
think of mad Matthew and wonder. Would he still be alive if the stain on
his shirt had been Barbie-doll pink?

* WELL, whatever the historical inaccuracy of Mel Gibson's painted
face, men and women slapped on gaudy make-up long before the time of
Wallace. In fact, the first use of cosmetics can be traced back 1.5
million years ago when human beings, travelling north from tropical
climes, glistened their skin with ochre, limonite and black manganese
oxide. That body suit, in all its gorgeous wonder, was not simply
flaunted as an erotic banner but applied for its healing and protective
properties against venomous insects and wild weather.
And so it has been ever since, the beauty business forever justifying
its artifice by claiming that its truest purpose is a certain kind of
physical and mental welfare, a visual expression of the soul. Sleek as
the most expensive unguents, Kate de Castelbajac's pictorial record of
beauty's past 100 years presents our second skin in all its guises and
alter-ego dreams, offering the face as an insight into social history as
well as changing fashion. Baudelaire called make-up ''a sublime
deformation of nature'', yet no matter how false its hold on youth, the
beauty industry is among the most powerful in the world.
Indeed some of us have more faith in beauty specialists than we have
in doctors, and increasingly we entrust our bodies to those forceful,
massaging hands; hands like steel in satin, soft and silky but without
mercy when they touch a sagging chin.

Castelbajac. Thames and Hudson, #29.95.

Cleavage was once viewed as an expression of womanhood, but as ANVAR
KHAN explains, times have changed.
THE period bosom, re-introduced to British society courtesy of the BBC
wardrobe department, has generated much prurient interest. The TV
adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice finished on Sunday, and
the opportunity to leer at nineteenth-century style cleavage went with
it.
It is hoped lessons have been learned and that the series has been an
education. Thrusting mammaries must be treated the same way as a rocky
crevice, you must never look down. You treat nestling bosoms the way you
would a dangerous sea while standing at the top of a cliff.
If you want my true opinion, some men want to lose themselves in a
woman's body and others don't. I remember reading a survey on men and
their relationship with the female breast. I am Clyde-built in that
department myself, and I wanted to know what I might have to deal with.
Men who prefer small breasts are somewhat prissy and exacting and don't
want to get out of their depth. Men who like big boobs are showy,
dominant, and quite chauvinist. And then there are men who prefer you.
In 1810, before Tank Girl and Madonna, cleavage was an asset. It
wasn't always regarded as intimidating, anti-social or a come-on. A gal
could get quite confused nowadays as to what to do with her endowments
for the best. Not everyone wants to put them away and let them mature
without an audience.
Breasts are potent, but in their raw, white, blancmange state during
Pride and Prejudice, they were hypnotic. Trashy authors and poets have
been known to write excitedly about ''heaving bosoms'', and I can only
assume that in instances of sexual repression, during periods in history
when nobody talked, the breast was an emotional barometer.
Different eras have asked for different types of behaviour. In
Victorian times it was thought dainty to faint. It can only be concluded
that the more trembling the breast available, the more feminine and
sexual a woman seemed.
In reality, watching ''Bonnets and Bosoms'', alias Pride and
Prejudice, is like wandering into a world overrun with milkmaids.
Breasts, then, were not portrayed aggressively, they were uniformly soft
and nurturing. When self-expression became part of fashion, boobs no
longer had to conform. They evolved, depending on the woman, as camp or
slutty accessories, or somewhere to rest your firearm. And this is
precisely why they have a contemporary fascination.
Pride and Prejudice offered the only chance to view breasts which
looked as if they would fulfil the function Mother Nature intended. For
the first time on TV, it was breast as nutritious udder.
The Bennet sisters, actresses Julia Salwalha (Lydia), Susannah Harker
(Jane), Polly Maberly (Kitty), Lucy Briers (Mary), and Jennifer Ehle
(Elizabeth), have lactose-creamy skin and cherubic curls, which lather
up at the temple. They are fresh and fleshy, the prerequisite of
sexuality in 1810 being staunch health. They each look as if they have a
good set of ovaries, can bear a son to carry on the family name, and are
strong enough to bring in the week's coal supply by themselves if they
have to.
The idea of milkmaid as sex goddess occurred during Thomas Hardy's
Tess of the d'Urbervilles, when I read the scene where her future
husband spies on her trying to learn to whistle in the dairy shed, by
pursing her full, red peony lips together. Milkmaids are the Vestal
Virgins of English farmland. Pure, untouched and fertile like the
countryside itself.
According to the BBC press office, their wardrobe department
extensively researched the Bennet period bosom. There have been rumours
that Jane Austen's peer group wore the first Wonderbra, because whatever
they wore pushed them out. But the Bennet sisters would not have worn a
bra of any sort. Underwear was a plain vest. Cotton tiers were sewn into
the muslin of the dress, at the sides and underneath the bosom. This was
standard dressmaking practice. The tiers were then tied tightly at the
back, lifting and supporting the breasts. It was in this way that the
cleavage became a drawing-room feature.
The head of BBC drama was recently quoted as saying that Jane Austen
was ''the Quentin Tarantino of the middle classes''. The drama has been
performed as knockabout and somewhat ham, and the sexual voyeurism is
integral to its success, therefore his comparison is way too highbrow.
In this interpretation, Jane Austen has more in common with Barbara
Windsor and Sid James. Altogether more of a Carry On.
* The final episode of Pride and Prejudice is repeated this Saturday
on BBC2; earlier on Saturday afternoon, Pride and Prejudice: From Page
to Screen, a documentary about the making of the series, will be shown
on BBC2. The programme includes an interview with Colin Firth aka Darcy.

A MAN described by psychiatrists as a paranoid psychotic will stand
trial in Paris on Monday charged with the murder two years ago of
wartime police chief Rene Bousquet.
It was a killing which Christian Didier, an unemployed bachelor,
described as the most important task of his life.
It also extinguished all hope of seeing the collaborationist Vichy
regime finally brought to book in France. For Bousquet, 84, a former
police chief, had been due to stand trial for his part in the
deportation to Nazi death camps of thousands of French and European
Jews. His would have been France's the most important war trial yet.
The extent to which Bousquet's wartime crimes may finally be given an
airing now depends on the skill of Didier's defence lawyer, 33-year-old
Arnaud Montebourg, who plans to haul as much Vichy history as possible
into the box.
Montebourg has provocatively chosen to depict his client as a hero and
the murder of Bousquet as what he terms ''a civic crime''.
Bousquet, who walked virtually scot-free from a trial in 1949 for
collaboration, was finally charged with crimes against humanity in 1991,
after years of investigation and lobbying by the professional
Nazi-hunter, lawyer Serge Klarsfeld. However the French establishment
closed ranks around a man who had pursued a top career in banking after
the war and funded the early election campaigns of former president
Francois Mitterrand, whose own political debut was with the Vichy
Government.
Last year Mitterrand finally admitted the open secret of his Vichy
past. He also disclosed that he had slowed up the legal mechanisms which
would otherwise have brought Bousquet to trial much earlier.
The very nature of Vichy would have come under scrutiny at such a
trial: had the regime been a courageous effort to protect a country half
under German occupation, or an active collaborationist government headed
by neo-Nazi zealots? That debate, thanks to Didier, can now drag on only
as academic argument.
The biggest surviving villain of Vichy, Bousquet stood accused of
responsibility for France's part in the Nazis' ''final solution'' of the
''Jewish problem''. Klarsfeld, for whom Bousquet's murder was
catastrophic, considers his trial would have been far more important
than that in 1987 of former SS captain Klaus Barbie, the ''Butcher of
Lyons''.
At least 40 former opponents of Nazi and Vichy regimes have been named
as defence witnesses. Some will tell of atrocities suffered at German
hands, and explain the atmosphere in which Didier, born in February
1944, grew up.
Didier's sanity will also be a key issue. Expecting to be hailed a
hero for Bousquet's murder, he was bitterly disappointed to be condemned
by the likes of Klarsfeld, whom he naively expected to leap forward as
his defence lawyer.
In May 1987 Didier had been caught in the prison at Lyons, armed with
a revolver, wanting to shoot Barbie. Two years later he was interned
after wandering into the Elysee Palace with something important to tell
President Mitterrand. Psychiatric experts have ruled him a
''borderline'' case, but responsible for his acts.
President Mitterrand, who may have been spared much discomfort by
Didier's crime, described him as ''that idiot who shot Bousquet''.

Manila
THE most powerful typhoon to hit the Philippines for years howled
across the country today, killing 66 people, sending more than 200,000
fleeing their homes, and leaving millions without power.
''This is the worst beating we have ever had,'' said Catanduanes
governor Severo Alcantara before communications with the island province
were severed.
Angela is described by weathermen as a ''super-typhoon'' because of
its size and power, up to 500 miles in diameter and with winds initially
gusting up to 155mph.
It first hit Cantanduanes then scythed across southern Luzon, the
Philippines' most prosperous and heavily populated island.
Its centre, or eye, passed just south of Manila this morning, although
its huge size meant its impact lingered for several hours.
The normally congested capital turned into a ghost town as its 8.5
million people cowered indoors.
Most deaths were drownings, although several people were killed by
objects sent flying by the gales. The dead included a three-day-old
baby.
At least 10 people died when volcanic debris loosened by rain
thundered down the flanks of Mount Mayon in the worst-hit Bicol region.
Thousands of homes were destroyed. Initial estimates put damage at
more than 1.2bn pesos (#30.8m).
President Fidel Ramos, taking charge of relief efforts in Manila,
said: ''Saving lives and reducing damage is the main event at this
particular time.''
Angela struck less than a week after Typhoon Zack killed more than 160
people in the central Philippines and devastated rice and sugar crops.

A HANDYMAN who carried out a ''despicable'' sexual assault on a blind
88-year-old pensioner after posing as her GP, was jailed for two years
yesterday.
Richard MacNeill, 66, also admitted indecently assaulting an
85-year-old woman after she rejected his offer to tidy up her garden.
Lord Johnston told the accused at the High Court in Edinburgh his
crimes were ''particularly despicable in view of the fact that they
involve victims of this age and disability.''
However, the judge said he accepted that the offences were not of the
most serious kind and took account of MacNeill's medical condition.
He was told MacNeill, of Bogganbank, Dingwall, in Ross-shire, had an
alcohol problem and that he also suffers from heart and respiratory
conditions.
The accused had admitted the two attacks at an earlier appearance at
the High Court in Stonehaven and Lord Johnston deferred sentence until
yesterday for background reports.
The court heard that on May 4 of this year, MacNeill called at the
88-year-old blind woman's home in the Highlands. She was alone in her
sitting room when she became aware of someone in her home.
MacNeill reassured her by saying: ''I'm your doctor.''
At first she was not suspicious as she had been treated by a number of
doctors, and after MacNeill indicated that he wished to examine her, she
started to undress. MacNeill touched her and tried to lie on top of her.
The elderly woman became frightened but managed to get away from
MacNeill who left without speaking to her.
A few weeks later he attacked the 85-year-old woman at her home in
Inverness after she turned down his offer to do her garden. MacNeill
admitted grabbing her, kissing her on the mouth and putting his hand
between her legs.

<HEADLINE>Grant of #2.5m will guarantee completion of lasting Glasgow memorial to former RSAMD president. Lottery high note for opera school</HEADLINE>

THE lottery committee of the Scottish Arts Council made its largest
grant so far yesterday, awarding #2.5m to the Royal Scottish Academy of
Music and Drama towards the establishment of an opera school in Glasgow
in memory of the academy's former president and founder of Scottish
Opera, Sir Alexander Gibson.
The grant will ensure the success of the appeal for the new building,
which was launched in March of this year. The cost was then estimated at
#4m, but has since risen to #5m. The appeal has already raised #1.5m,
the academy's principal, Mr Philip Ledger, announced yesterday, and the
addition of the lottery grant will enable the college to approach other
trust bodies for funding.
''We are well on course to open in 1997 for the 150th anniversary of
the academy and as a fitting tribute to our former president Sir
Alexander Gibson,'' said Mr Ledger.
The new building will be on Glasgow's Cowcaddens Road, on the other
side of the block from the present academy, but linked to it. It will
include a performance space and rehearsal facilities and be the base for
a new young opera company, drawn from the academy's third-year students,
which will tour small and medium-scale opera productions.
Mr Ledger said that the school will have links with the world of
traditional music and he emphasised the public access to the facility (a
National Lottery award requirement), noting that the RSAMD was already
one of the city's major arts venues, staging 345 events for an audience
of 67,000 people last year.
None the less, the substantial award to an opera facility -- and an
appeal committee which includes Mr Jeremy Isaacs of London's
already-rewarded Royal Opera House -- is certain to fuel the controversy
over the use of National Lottery funds. It also comes in the context of
a looming threat over Scottish Opera, which has still to find an
acceptable solution to its deficit problems.
Mr Ledger insisted yesterday that the activities of the new opera
company would be complementary to those of Scottish Opera, which tours
small scale productions as Scottish Opera-Go-Round. Co-operation with
the opera company would continue, he said, including the use of the new
rehearsal facilities. Scottish Opera itself withdrew an application for
lottery assistance towards new rehearsal facilities a mile away at
Spier's Wharf.
Another grant from the total of #4m announced yesterday points up the
anomalies in the way money is being spent on the arts. Musselburgh's
Brunton Theatre, which was deprived of its #53,000 Scottish Arts Council
revenue grant earlier this year, was awarded more than #1m for the
refurbishment of its building.
The #1,125,200 for the Brunton from the lottery, is added to #400,000
from East Lothian District Council, and #328,000 from the European
Regional Development Fund.
Mr Robin Peoples, artistic director of the Brunton, said that the
company hoped to continue a dialogue with the Scottish Arts Council over
its funding, but pointed out that the theatre's main revenue funder
remained East Lothian, which will have its integrity maintained with
local government reorganisation as it absorbed responsibilities
previously those of Lothian region.
Scottish Arts Council director Ms Seona Reid said the two pots of
money -- the Government's core funding for the SAC, and the National
Lottery -- were quite separate.
''In time there will be legislation to change that glass wall, but at
the moment we have to work within that,'' she said.
The chairman of the SAC's lottery committee, Mr Douglas Connell,
conceded that the opera school award may lead to accusations of elitism.
The lottery committee has made 82 grants of #10m, most of them to
small projects. ''But there are still many other organisations with
dreams which the lottery can help realise,'' he said. There are #50m of
applications in the pipeline.
Other grants announced yesterday were: #137,000 -- feature film Stella
Does Tricks; #93,000 -- Glasgow's Arches Theatre; #57,000 -- Wintonhill
Animation; #49,000 -- Agnew Park, Stranraer; #44,000 -- Highland
Printmakers Workshop and Gallery, Inverness; #26,000 -- Filmobile
(Scotland); #26,000 -- Glasgow's National Jazz Institute; #20,000 --
Wildcat Stage Productions; #18,000 -- Arts in Fife; #13,000 -- Johnstone
Silver Band; #11,625 -- Balnain House Trust; #4000 -- The Byre Theatre,
St Andrews; #3349 -- Dundee's King's Theatre; #1,667 -- Artlink,
Edinburgh.

Monticello
A TEENAGER convicted of killing a British tourist at a roadside rest
stop in North Florida two years ago was today jailed for life.
John ''Billy Joe'' Crumitie, 18, was convicted in September of
murdering Gary Colley, 34, of Bradford, West Yorkshire.
Mr Colley's girlfriend, 37-year-old Margaret Jagger, was wounded in
the bungled robbery on September 14, 1993, near Monticello.
She was in court to hear the couple's attacker sentenced today.
A Pensacola jury convicted Crumitie after two earlier trials ended
with deadlocked juries.
''I'm sorry about what happened to Mrs Jagger,'' said Crumitie,
dressed in a blue prison uniform and wearing leg shackles, before he was
sentenced.
He then added: ''I want to know: Is the lady on the scales of justice
really blind or not?''
After the sentence was read he showed no emotion.
Mrs Jagger, dressed in black, fought back tears as she read a prepared
statement.
''A good friend is gone,'' she said. ''To many, many people a
wonderful loyal friend has been taken out of their lives instantly for
no reason.''
Mrs Jagger, who also testified in all three trials, said she would
''live with the mental torture and memories of that horrific night at
the rest area''.
Crumitie must serve 25 years before becoming eligible for parole. He
was also sentenced to a total of 64 years to be served on four lesser
charges related to the shooting, which will be served simultaneously
with the life term.
Another teenager who pleaded guilty in connection with the killing and
provided crucial testimony against Crumitie was sentenced today to eight
years in prison.
A third youth who pleaded guilty and is believed to have fired the gun
that killed Mr Colley will be sentenced later this month. A fourth
suspect was sentenced as a juvenile last year.
Mr Colley and Mrs Jagger had stopped at a roadside rest area when they
were attacked by four youths who fired into their car when Mr Colley
stepped on the accelerator to try to escape.
It was the ninth murder of a foreigner in Florida in a year, and
tarnished the state's #15bn tourism business. It prompted a
strengthening of the juvenile justice system and led to the posting of
armed guards at interstate rest areas.--AP.

THE BBC is set to remain at its Aberdeen headquarters, site of the
Beechgrove Garden, which has already moved to pastures new.
The BBC has rejected the possibility of a new greenfield development
and will invite developers to tender with schemes for the Beechgrove
site, the corporation's Aberden headquarters for 57 years.
It seems unlikely the new studio will be contained in the original
building -- Beechgrove House, which is nearly 100 years old.
Although it is not a listed building, planning permission would be
required to demolish it.
Controller for BBC Scotland John McCormick said: ''For the past couple
of years, we have been looking at different options. We are planning for
the next 10 years and we are committed to maintaining a strong
television and radio presence here over the next 10 years.''
The new centre could be open by the end of 1997.
''Looking over the 10 years, we thought it was better to develop a new
centre which is purpose built which will be able to take advantage of
new technology and which is a bit more open and friendly as a
broadcasting centre,'' Mr McCormick said.
One of the options they considered, which was rejected as uneconomic a
year ago, was to share Grampian Television's Queen's Cross site.
The BBC then narrowed the choice down to redeveloping the Beechgrove
site or starting from scratch on a new greenfield site.
He added: ''Although we are all very attached to the present building,
the most important thing is to be able to keep broadcasting.''
The Beechgrove Garden has moved to a 2.5-acre garden at Brotherfield,
six miles west of Aberdeen, from where future series will be broadcast.

ROYAL Navy scientists are being called in following claims that
signals from one of their coastal radar installations are being picked
up by hearing aids and telephones in nearby villages.
People living near the new radar installation at HMS Cambridge gunnery
school at Wembury Bay, Plymouth, claim it also triggers off security
lighting and causes television interference.
Former Second World War radar instructor Ernie Trethowan said he heard
a bleep in his hearing aid every 4.2 seconds.
The 75-year-old retired local government officer of Heybrook Bay
calculated that he would receive 71 million bleeps a year, and said:
''It can aggravate you tremendously.''
He told how he stood outside a neighbour's house and watched a
security light pulse on and off in time with bleeps he heard in his
hearing aid.
A Navy spokesman said they were unaware of any problems caused by 56
similar radars used elsewhere in the country, but its Defence and
Radiological Protection Service would carry out a survey as a result of
concerns.

Moscow
RUSSIAN television showed a brief glimpse today of a pale,
puffy-faced, President Boris Yeltsin, the first sight Russians have had
of their leader since his heart attack more than a week ago.
Yeltsin was seen sitting in an armchair in a blue tracksuit and
meeting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
The 64-year-old president looked slightly disorientated and lacked his
usual fire. He sat almost motionless in a chair opposite Chernomyrdin in
a television appearance which lasted less than a minute.
''Subjectively speaking I'm not feeling bad now,'' Yeltsin said,
slurring his words.
''My rehabilitation is going as planned. The doctors confer with me
twice a day. I must recover my normal condition, of course. But there is
no reason to worry now.''
Yeltsin's wife Naina told reporters during a visit to a health
products company that he is now prepared for regular working meetings.
''Everything is all right, as much as is possible,'' she said.
Today's hospital meeting was Yeltsin's first with his Prime Minister
and the pictures were the first released since he was rushed to a Moscow
hospital with heart trouble on October 26.
After the meeting Chernomyrdin said he had assumed partial control of
key ''power'' Ministers who normally report direct to the president.
He said he had been ''co-ordinating'' the work of the Ministers of
defence, security, foreign affairs, and the interior in the first
admission that Yeltin has given up some presidential authority.
''The president has to be partially relieved of these duties to give
him a better chance to recover,'' Chernomyrdin said, ''but of course we
seek the president's advice on all key questions.''
Asked if it was Yeltsin who asked him to take over certain Ministries,
the 57-year-old Prime Minister replied: ''I could see it in his eyes
that Chernomyrdin should work harder.''
He is the man who would take over if Yeltsin died or was unable to
carry on.
''I believe the president should complete the course of treatment and
everything will be fine,'' he said, adding: ''I'm against overloading
the president with work as soon as he finishes his treatment.''
Yeltsin's illness, his second mild heart attack in less than four
months, coincides with political upheavals in Russia in the run-up to a
crucial parliamentary election in December.
The Central Election Commission, which has banned two leading parties
from taking part in the poll, reinstated the nationalist Derzhava today,
but the fate of the liberal front-runner Yabloko is still
unclear.--AP/Reuter.

AN Algerian Muslim extremist living in London is believed to be a key
figure in the three-month bombing campaign in France, it was claimed
yesterday.
French newspapers Le Monde and Le Parisien suggested that French
police believe the unnamed man gave orders to Boualem Bensaid, 27, who
they arrested in Paris on Thursday in connection with the attacks.
Bensaid was picked up after he made a phone call, taped by police, in
which he was allegedly heard to instruct accomplices to plant a car bomb
near Lille.
Le Monde claimed the London-based man was a senior member of the
Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA), which has claimed responsibility for
the bombings.
Le Parisien said the man supplied guerrillas in France with funds and
organised training trips to Afghanistan for Muslim militants.
His mobile phone number was found in an address book belonging to
Khaled Kelkal, an Algerian killed in a gun battle with police near Lyon
in September.
Seven people have been killed and 170 injured in France since the
bombings began in July.

THE Prime Minister is expected to face hostil-ity from anti-nuclear
campaigners when he arrives in New Zealand next week for the
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.
John Major, who has openly backed President Jacques Chirac over French
underground testing in the South Pacific, can also expect some tough
exchanges on the subject with New Zealand premier Jim Bolger and
Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating.
The row centres on France's decision to go ahead with underground
explosions on Mururoa Atoll despite an international outcry from
political leaders and environmentalists led by Greenpeace.
Paul Keating said yesterday that he would give John Major ''a smack
with a ruler'' at the summit.
Asked if he would confront the Prime Minister about the tests, he
replied: ''If I get a fair shot at him -- yes.
''John sort of runs these conferences with a bit of a school-marmish
sort of approach, because Britain always saw itself as the leader of the
Commonwealth and setting the agenda.
''Well, I think we're going to give him a little smack with the ruler
. . . a big one if we can get away with it.
''We're going to tell him that, when a democracy like France decides
to let the rest of the world know that non-proliferation doesn't matter
and that they'll detonate explosions in French Polynesia, then a body
like the Commonwealth should make its position clear and condemn such
actions.''
The Duke of Edinburgh has also stepped into the row with demands for
an investigation into the environmental impact of the three recent
nuclear tests in the atoll.
Speaking in Wellington, during the Queen's tour of New Zealand, he
said other members of the royal family shared his concern.
He said: ''It's just in case it's doing any ecological damage.
''There is a suspicion that it's doing damage and if you're concerned
with the conservation of nature, you want to make sure whether it is or
isn't.''
The Duke, who is president of the World Wide Fund for Nature, backed a
call by the WWF in New Zealand for an investigation.
''I very much support the initiative which has been taken here . . .
to ask for an assessment of the effect of these explosions -- and the
rest of the family very much supports that.''
Government sources insisted, however, that Mr Major would be going to
Auckland ''understanding very well the concerns expressed by a number of
countries in the region about nuclear testing''.

ROMAN Catholic bishops yesterday offered their support to the
controversial Divorce Reform Bill, saying it could make marriage
break-ups less traumatic.
Right-wing Tories have fought the proposed measure, which they claim
will undermine marriage by making no-fault divorces easier to obtain.
However, Peter Smith, the Catholic Bishop of East Anglia and chairman
of the Bishops' Committee for Marriage and Family Life, said the bishops
believed there were positive aspects to the Bill.
It would cut ''quickie divorces'' and encourage mediation, possibly
leading to reconciliation of couples, he said.
''The Catholic Church would not wish to encourage divorce in any way.
What we've got to do is face the reality that we have a divorce law,
that marriages do break down and what we need to do is mitigate the
damage that all that does.''
Currently 75% of divorces went through in less than six months, but
the Bill would lengthen this to a minimum of 12 months, and he made
clear the bishops would like to see it even longer.
The Bill is due to be among new laws proposed in the Queen's Speech
later this month.
However, there is speculation that the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of
Clashfern, will alter it radically or even drop it in response to
growing pressure from Tory right-wingers.
He has already been forced to abandon his Family Homes and Domestic
Violence Bill from the current parliamentary programme. This would have
given abused women the right to eject their violent partner from the
family home even if they were not married.

The President and Attorney General Janet Reno in Arlington National
Cemetery dedicated a memorial, a gift from Scotland in the form of a
cairn made of 270 sandstone blocks, one for each victim, quarried near
Lockerbie.
In his speech, Mr Clinton vowed ''never to relax'' efforts to bring
the bombers to justice.
''Despite the passage of time, nothing has dimmed our recollection of
that day when death commanded the heavens. Nothing has diminished our
outrage at that evil deed,'' he told the victims' families at Arlington.

SCOTLAND is an ancient nation in European terms. Certainly by the time
Edward I came north in the late 1200s (to lay down his version of the
law and to half-inch the Stone of Destiny) the Scots must already have
had an acute feeling of national identity.
In the mid-1600s when now powerful nations such as Germany and Italy
were still a mish-mash of pocket Rubovias, Scotland, through the
national covenant, was re-asserting her individuality and rather
cheekily, a special relationship with God. Surely the sign of a people
secure and confident in their unique background?
With such an impressive span of years behind us it's tempting to be
self-righteous when we survey the strife in places such as the former,
now much-fragmented, Yugoslavia, which scarcely lasted 75 years as a
political entity.
We must never forget that civil war, whether motivated by family and
clan feuds, or religion persisted, was commonplace in our own story
centuries after Scotland -- the nation -- was an established fact.
In 1572, for example, as the final drive to crush support for Mary
Queen of Scots gained momentum, Edinburgh bore a remarkable resemblance
to the beleaguered city of Sarajevo. Instead of Muslim, Croat, or Serb,
''King's Man?'' or ''Queen's Man?'' was the question on everyone's lips.
For thousands of Scots the answer was to mean the difference between
life and death.
Edinburgh Castle, a stronghold of the Marian party (Mary was
languishing in English custody and her son, James VI was still a
schoolboy) was under siege and atrocities were being reported on an
almost daily basis. For instance, in the north, Mary's cause was
championed by Sir Adam Gordon, a ''merciless and unscrupulous'' soldier.
Ranged against him was the Master of Forbes. After Gordon secured two
successes for the Queen he embarked on an infamous expedition against
the Castle of Towie.
Its mistress, Lady Forbes, defiantly refused to hand over the building
to the encircling force and Gordon ordered it to be put to the torch. In
the subsequent inferno 27 people, including Lady Forbes and her
daughters, perished.
The besieged garrison at Edinburgh hearing of Gordon's ''successes''
dispatched a small party of reinforcements who were to be shipped north
from Blackness on the Forth. However, a party of King's horsemen was
sent out from Leith by Regent Mar to intercept them. The Queen's men
were persuaded to lay down their arms but what followed has an
uncomfortable twentieth-century echo to it.
Fifteen men, the strongest of the band, were murdered in cold blood
and the rest driven like sheep to the slaughter at the point of spear
and sword, paraded in Leith and hanged without trial. It's said that one
of the King's soldiers captured in another skirmish during those weeks
was picked out for special attention, attacked, wounded and mutilated --
all because his name was Knox.
In Edinburgh, artillery fire made life miserable for the citizens who
had to run a deadly passage from closemouth to closemouth. The search
for fresh water and food became a daily ordeal under the guns of the
garrison in the castle. The new provost, Lord Lindsey, had created two
long screens in the centre of the city, one in front of the Tolbooth to
defend the courts and parliament and one opposite the north door of St
Giles to allow some security for folk as they went about their lives. As
a reprisal after the erection of these security walls, the guns of the
castle were turned on the new fish market, ''fishes were sent over the
highest houses and strewn in the street'' after this assault.
For many months Edinburgh was a miserable and dangerous place to live.

THE NEW system of single-tier local authorities is in danger of being
strangled at birth because of underfunding by the Government, the
secretary-general of Cosla, Mr Douglas Sinclair, warned yesterday.
Mr Sinclair, who until recently was chief executive of CentralRegional
Council, was pessimistic about the future financial health of the new
councils and how that might affect their services.
He told a British Association of Social Workers' conference in
Aviemore: ''Central government grant is planned to reduce next year by
about 1% in cash terms and that's equivalent to an increase of about 8%
in the council tax before the new councils even start to consider their
budgets.
''Secondly, the Secretary of State is planning that local government
expenditure next year should only increase in volume terms by 0.3%, not
3%, and this at a time when inflation is running at 3.9%.''
In addition, for the third year in a row, any pay award in local
government would have to be self-financed by so-called efficiency
savings. Next year's settlement would cost local government #105m.
One has got to ask the question where is the evidence that local
government can be squeezed for ever for efficiency savings to generate
cash to fund pay awards.
Mr Sinclair said: ''I have to say that we are now well beyond any
pretence of efficiency savings and the prospect I have outlined will
mean an inevitable reduction in the quality of local government
services.''
He said that, if that was not bad enough, the Secretary of State also
was planning a further reduction in the support for local government,
through a net saving of #30m, which Mr Forsyth had argued would arise in
the first year of local government reorganisation.
''It does seem to me that the Government has two policies in head-on
contradiction -- its flagship policy for Scotland of the new system of
local government and the policy of reducing public expenditure,'' he
said.
''It would be cruel irony if the advantages of single-tier local
government were not achieved simply because the new system was not
funded properly.''
He said that would have enourmous implications for the quality of
public services in our country.
Mr Sinclair also warned that given this bleak financial outlook,
voluntary organisations must accept the reality that they could not
expect their financial support to remain intact when councils were faced
with making reductions in their frontline services, such as education
and social work.

Peter Evans meets sportsmen fighting for a share of the spoils.
FISHING is Britain's most popular participant sport. The fresh air and
the challenge of landing the next big catch lure thousands of anglers
out to fish Scotland's waters every week.
For some it's an obsession; for all it provides endless hours of
enjoyment. But the bounty of our lochs and rivers is far from free. On
the great rivers, such as the Tweed, a week's fishing can cost as much
as #30,000 -- way outside the pocket of the average angler.
Like stalking deer and shooting grouse, fishing reaps income for the
great Scottish estates, and the rights to prime stretches of water are
jealously guarded. If everyone was allowed to fish, argue the
land-owners, that valuable income would disappear. It would also mean
disaster from a conservation point of view, they claim, with the
decimation of fish stocks.
Not surprisingly, there are those who believe this view is a distorted
fabrication; that the lairds are money grabbers -- out to deprive the
ordinary citizen of the moral right to pursue his pastime unhindered.
Since 1990 in Scotland, the fishermen who believe the waters of
Scotland are part of their national inheritance have had a collective
voice. The Scottish Campaign for Public Angling (SCAPA) is dedicated to
bringing all angling rights into public ownership, under a
democratically elected Scottish anglers' trust.
Its secretary, Derek Keith, who lives in Edinburgh, is not a man to be
intimidated by water bailiffs or ''protection orders'' -- Keith prefers
to call them ''exclusion orders''. In 1992, an interdict was granted
stopping him from fishing a stretch of the Spey at Fochabers. He decided
to challenge it in the High Court and lost. The #9000 costs awarded
against him are still unpaid, but despite living under the threat of a
warrant sale on his property, he sleeps easily at night.
As we speak he is pleased. A SCAPA ''fish in'' on the Tay at
Ballinluig a few days before provoked a verbal confrontation with a
water bailiff, known to have had words with other anglers over the use
of the river. ''We knew we would be challenged,'' says Keith, ''so we
decided to adopt the 'silence technique' ''.
This is one of three carefully planned strategies the group uses in
the pursuit of its cause. ''When approached do not answer any questions
or justify yourself, or stop your activity,'' advises SCAPA. ''This is
guaranteed to turn the person purple with rage and you can expect
ignorant comments about being deaf or dumb.
''Usually the harasser will depart, but if not, with authority and
politeness you should take out your pen and paper and ask the person for
his name and address, date of birth, and car registration number, as you
intend to report him to the police. This usually leaves him speechless
and it is amazing how many will actually give the details
requested.''The object of the exercise is to turn the tables on the
accuser and gain the moral high ground.
The thorn in the campaigners' side is the Freshwater and Salmon
Fisheries (Scotland) Act of 1976, ironically introduced by a Labour
government. Under the Act, for the first time in Scottish history, it
became a criminal offence to fish for freshwater fish -- everything
apart from salmon and sea trout -- without the land-owner's permission.
Protection orders granted under the act, with the promise of public
access by permit, have been abused, claims SCAPA. ''What they will tell
you a lot of the time is that the permits are out, or they can put
onerous restrictions on the type of tackle or baits to be used, say
there is no fishing on Sunday, no night fishing -- things like that,''
says Keith.
The contention that freeing up access would decimate fish numbers is
exaggerated and by no means new, claims Keith. ''They were talking in
1834 on the Tweed about the lower orders killing off all the fish
stocks.''
A 1989 survey of Scottish angling revealed the sport was worth #50m a
year and supported 3400 jobs. ''But it's worth a lot less now,'' says
Keith. ''If we are serious about rural development then let's stop
allowing our rivers to be used as a private playground and open them up
for all.''
The hope is that the 1976 Act will be repealed. Born and raised in
Perth, where his interest in fishing grew, Keith looks forward to the
day when he cannot be ''hounded off the rivers in my own country''.

RUUD LUBBERS today looked set to become the new secretary-general of
Nato, perhaps as early as next week, as a confident Dutch Government
formally announced his candidacy to replace the fallen Willy Claes.
The declaration came within hours of Lubbers, a former Dutch Prime
Minister, returning from what diplomats described as a ''positive
vetting'' interview in Washington with US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, the power behind the Nato throne.
''Over the last two weeks we have had informal soundings that gave
reasons for optimism. Now, after Lubbers' visit to the United States, we
have formalised what has been something of a reality -- which is that he
is now a candidate,'' Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo told
reporters.
Alliance diplomats noted that the Netherlands would not have put
Lubbers forward unless it had been sure not to be humiliated by a
rejection.
The formal job offer could be made to Lubbers by Wednesday. Claes quit
two weeks ago over a bribery scandal.
Germany, France, Britain, Italy, and Portugal all declared publicly
their support for Lubbers this week.
The only other candidate, former Danish Foreign Minister Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, so far has the declared support of Denmark, Iceland,
and Norway.--Reuter.

BONXIES don't scare easily. Any human with sense and foreknowledge
crosses their wild breeding moors with hood up or a stick down the back
of the neck. The alternative is a hard cuff on the head and a trickle of
blood. No other Scottish bird is as aggressive in defence of its nest.
No sooner have you retreated in disorder from the territory of one
dive-bombing pair than another comes at you from a different angle. The
sight of the scattered beaks and legs of murdered puffins round the nest
side adds a nasty psychological edge: you are entering the lair of a
gothic ogre or pirate.
For that is precisely what bonxies are -- pirates. Autumn is the time
you are most likely to see them outside their Orkney and Shetland
strongholds. You will notice a deep-keeled, heavy, gull-like bird
beating steadily south, dark brown with bright silver flashes on its
wings. Suddenly the Bonxie accelerates and twists in pursuit of a
guillemot or gull, sticking to a victim until terror makes it void its
stomach contents. Another flick of those silver wings and the fish is
transferred to the Skua's stomach before it hits the water. Skua chicks
eat twice-eaten food.
Bonxies are not averse to doing this to gannets, seizing them by the
wingtip and cartwheeling them into the sea. They have even been seen
robbing an osprey of its fish. But when piracy is likely to cost more
energy than hunting, bonxies also chase, catch, and eat seabirds from
storm petrels to swans, and kill lambs and ewes in distress -- hence one
sinister name in Orkney: the herdsman.
We protected the last of the great skuas in Shetland at the turn of
the century and they have done well from the fish we discard at sea --
especially the little ones that should not have been caught in the first
place. Our reward is to watch them harry and kill, terrorise and strike
down any of the birds of the north Atlantic, with the moral indifference
of a true pirate.

Buenos Aires
AT least nine people were killed and 330 injured today in a blast at
an Argentine arms factory that rained shells and shrapnel on the nearby
town of Rio Tercero.
President Carlos Menem, who rushed to the site with several cabinet
members, adamantly dismissed speculation about a possible attack on the
army factory in the central province of Cordoba.
''The Argentine government is telling you that it was an accident, not
an attack,'' he told reporters.
He also ruled out earlier concerns that the factory's underground
heavy explosives depot might blow up. ''The depot that was under danger
of exploding has now been completely isolated,'' Mr Menem said.
He added that the death toll could be higher than the nine bodies
found by rescue teams. ''We are not ruling out more victims,'' he told
reporters.
Cordoba's Health Ministry said it had assisted 330 injured, 11 of them
in serious condition.
The fate of 200 employees working at the factory at the time of the
first, early morning blast was unclear by sunset.
The blast ripped through the plant at 9am local time and was heard 30
miles away.
Rio Tercero, 60 miles south of the central city of Cordoba, looked
like a ghost town after many of its 30,000 terrified residents fled. Its
empty streets were littered with fragments of metal and concrete.
''It was like a battlefield. All of us who were here were hiding to
avoid being hurt by the shockwave,'' car repairman Pedro Mana said.
A man was killed by flying wreckage at a bus station 15 blocks away,
and hospital staff said they were treating residents who had lost
limbs.--Reuter.

TELEVISION newsreader Julia Somerville has protested her innocence
after being arrested in a police investigation into nude photographs of
her seven-year-old daughter in the bath.
Reports last night claimed a film processing technician called police
after developing a film handed into a Boots the Chemist in London's West
End by Ms Somerville's architect partner, Mr Jeremy Dixon.
She was arrested with Mr Dixon and questioned for seven hours by
members of Scotland Yard's Paedophile and Child Pornography Unit, but is
reported to have said: ''I strenuously deny any allegation of
wrongdoing.''
When Mr Dixon, 56, returned to Boots to pick up the prints, officers
arrested him and took him to Charing Cross police station. Ms
Somerville, 48, who has two children, Joe, 11, and Rachel, seven, was
arrested on Thursday at her home in Muswell Hill, north London. She was
taken to Charing Cross police station where she and Mr Dixon were
interviewed separately.
The two were later released on bail to return to the police station in
December pending further inquiries.
The ITN newsreader, who fought a battle against cancer and underwent a
major operation to remove a brain tumour the size of a golf ball,
protested her innocence to a London-based newspaper.
''I have given police a full explanation and I am deeply distressed
that such an untrue allegation should have been made public,'' she said.
A ITN spokesman said last night: ''Julia denies these allegations
completely and we have nothing to add at this point.''
The former presenter of BBC's Nine O'Clock News until 1987 has been
married twice before and has lived with Mr Dixon in Muswell Hill for one
year.
She successfully recovered from the brain tumour after a nine-hour
operation three years ago to return to fronting ITN bulletins.
Although a household name since she first starting reading BBC's Nine
O'Clock News after moving from radio, she has kept her personal life as
private as possible.
When first offered a job with BBC TV in 1984, she said she had to
consider whether she could ''cope with being a public person'' before
deciding to move from her job as a labour and industrial correspondent
with BBC radio.
Born in 1947, the oldest of three sisters, her grandfather was Admiral
Sir James Somerville and her father was a senior civil servant at GCHQ,
the Government's spy centre.
She was educated at public school in Oxford and then at the University
of Sussex, where she read English, before moving into journalism with
Homes and Gardens magazine.
She married student Mr Stephen Band while editing a company newspaper
in Brighton but the marriage collapsed after the couple moved to France.
After a move to the BBC, she became industrial reporter before the
chance came for the move into TV, replacing Sue Lawley as frontwoman on
the Nine O'Clock News.
Three years later, she moved to ITN. In 1992, she split from her
second husband, BBC executive Mr Ray Gowridge.

A GOVERNMENT Minister provoked anger last night after he said that
being a back bench MP was a ''part-time'' job.
Public Services Minister Roger Freeman, arguing that MPs had a right
to confidentiality about outside earnings supplementing their
parliamentary salaries, said: ''It is a part-time job being a back
bencher.
''That is what you are elected for. Parliament only meets for a
certain part of the year . . . and the pay is related to the part-time
nature of the work''.
Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes angrily accused Mr Freeman of being
out of touch. Mr Hughes said: ''For those of us who do it full time, who
gave up other jobs to do it, and who probably work 80 or 90 hours a
week, it is a bit rich for someone to say it's a part time job.''
Mr Freeman's remarks are due to be shown today on Channel 4's The
People's Parliament.
Labour front bencher Brian Wilson said: ''This is another cat out of
the bag about how Tories actually view the job of MPs. It is only a
part-time job for those who are too idle or disinterested to do the work
the job demands.''
Meanwhile Labour stepped up the pressure on the Government over the
Nolan committee recommendations in advance of Monday's Commons debate.
The Opposition launched a campaign across the country to implement the
Nolan call for disclosure of earnings received by individuals in their
capacity as an MP.
Labour said the campaign would challenge MPs to act in the public
interest for the good of parliamentary democracy, rather than for their
own narrow or personal party interests. A poster campaign which will run
over the weekend asks Tory MPs: ''What Have You Got to Hide?''
Labour spokesman Marjorie Mowlam said: ''We want to attract support
from every part of Britain, from every political party in Britain and
from all sections of the community. What is at stake is precious -- it
is nothing less than the integrity of Parliament and the measures needed
to begin to rebuild and restore faith in it.
''We are attracting more and more MPs to our cause. They see they have
a duty to their constituents to act on the recommendations of an
independent group appointed to clean up sleaze in public life. We are
looking to win on Monday, and we will be campaigning for victory right
up to the vote.''
Labour will be asking all Tory MPs with consultancies why they will
not reveal to their constituencies how much money they are earning
through their activities as MPs. Labour published a list of 125 Tory MPs
with 270 entries in the register listed as either consultants or
parliamentary advisers.
The only Scot on the list is Tayside North MP Bill Walker, who is
described as as '''Parliamentary Adviser, British Holidays and Home
Parks Association Ltd. (Caravan and Leisure Parks Association) (nominal
expenses only).''
Mr Walker said last night: ''What we want is this committee to be
operating and studying matters objectively and impartially, not just
this idiotic hype we are having from Labour which shows they are unfit
to govern. They are only interested in making narrow ideological
points.''
He said that, through newspaper columns, the likes of Gordon Brown and
Brian Wilson used some of their time as MPs to try to influence people
and change attitudes, which was far more potent than someone asking a
parliamentary question.

Iain Wilson watches as well-heeled anglers revel in Scotland's rivers.
THEY are known as the Shuttlefishers -- big spending anglers who fly
in and out of Scotland for just one day. They come from all over the
world, money is no object, in the quest to bag a salmon. One party
recently arrived in Edinburgh on an early morning flight from Manchester
for fewer than eight hours of fishing on a river, albeit with leading
angler Bob Brownless.
He organises Shuttlefishing through his Edinburgh firm, BobSport
(Scotland) Ltd, charging a basic #145-per-head -- although, for an
additional fee, extras will be laid on, from transport by Rolls Royce or
helicopter to champagne picnics by the riverbank.
Clients include the rich and famous, pop stars and politicians, so the
trio who stepped off the plane came as a real surprise.
A father and two sons, they were from Stoke-on-Trent, a former
industrial heartland north of Birmingham once famous for coal mining,
iron and steel, and rubber. The Smith family were just as down-to-earth
(with the gravelly accents to match) as the district of Stoke which is
still known as The Potteries for its production of ceramics, despite the
fact that Wedgwood is now as likely to come from Taiwan as from their
home city.
It didn't take long to uncover who had financed their #400 trip,
before air fares. Eldest son Philip Smith, 42, was the only one wearing
a ''proper'' angling jersey and jacket.
He turned out to be the managing director of a multi-national medical
publishing company with a turnover of millions, who covered the three
#100 return flights by using air miles amassed from regular travels to
the likes of Japan and the US.
His father Ron, 63, and brother Simon, 30, are fanatical coarse
anglers, with barbel and chub their favourite quarry. But they have
always wanted to catch a salmon, a frustrating ambition for many a
southerner unless prepared to head north and cross the Border.
They travelled to Ireland recently in the hope of landing the king of
game fish, but were foiled by waters as low as those which plagued
drought-stricken England this summer.
Philip, who has fished in Alaska, New Zealand, and America, is back
home after five years in Japan and the US, following the management
buy-out of the publishing firm.
He said: ''I can only get a day off every now and then. So when I go
fishing, it is quality time which I cannot afford to waste. It may seem
extravagant, or reckless, but a trip like this is very convenient for
me. I not only get access to stretches of river which contain salmon but
an expert with the experience and know-how to boost prospects of
catching a fish.''
The trio had risen at 4.30am to catch a 7am flight; landed at
Edinburgh at 8am, and were fishing by 9.30am, with all equipment
supplied, including chest waders, rods and lines.
Brownless, who has caught about 4000 salmon, including the first or
largest of a season, used all his experience to put them over the places
where fish rest on the way to spawning beds.
Simon chose to spin rather than use a fly rod on the one-and-a-half
mile long Cambusmore beat 11 at the River Teith, near Callander. Just
four casts later, at the Douglas pool, one of seven available, he hooked
and landed a 12lb salmon.
The fish, unable to travel upstream because of low water, had been in
the river a long time, and was far from resembling a bar of silver. As
far as Simon was concerned, that salmon -- his first ever -- was
magical, although he still despatched it with a blow to the head.
The fight was over in fewer than five minutes, way down on that for
some of his big barbel, but the adrenalin flowed for the rest of the
day's fishing which ended at 5.15pm in time to catch a celebratory pint
before the 7.50pm flight to Manchester.
''I got a real buzz, a real high,'' said Simon as he posed for
pictures with his prize. His brother added: ''It was worth the money,
even if we hadn't got a fish. The scenery alone was worth the cash.''
Fishing broke for lunch, including wine, ham and pate sandwiches,
cheeses, fruit and biscuits, at 1pm. Despite urgent pleas from the
party, Brownless refused to let them start fishing again until ''the
gentleman's'' one hour had passed.
He gave up a series of successful careers in advertising, publishing,
and commercial more than a decade ago to pursue his love of fishing.
Originally from Newcastle, he has been a full-time salmon guide in
Scotland for 11 years. Some 50% of clients are foreigners, many
attracted by adverts in fishing magazines or through visits to Farlows
tackle shop in London's Pall Mall, a magnet for recent arrivals from
abroad, including the Far East and Middle East.
Brownless, whose packages of one day to a week or more can also
include golfing, shooting, or skiing if required, counts Archbishops,
Russian politicians, and Wall Street hustlers among his clients.
He once ghillied for a rich African who was desperate to land a
Scottish salmon, which seemed incongruous given his occupation --
rearing crocodiles for their skins, with the reptiles fed on ostriches
bred for the purpose.
Many are corporate bookings, or tourists from Japan, Australia,
America, along with the huntin', shootin' and fishin' fraternities of
France, Germany, and Italy.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson yesterday outlined Labour's
economic strategy and reassured business leaders that a devolved
parliament would not necessarily lead to increases in taxation.
Mr Robertson was speaking at a meeting of the Scottish Industrial
Forum in Glasgow. The forum -- of which he is president -- comprises a
number of companies linked with the Labour Party to develop an economic
strategy.
His comments follow reports that snooker player Stephen Hendry would
leave Scotland if Labour introduced a ''tartan tax''.
Mr Robertson said: ''The business community will be told that
devolution is dangerous, costly and will lead to over-government. It is
all totally untrue, but that will not stop them saying it.
''Do not underestimate, but do not believe, the Tory propaganda
effort, which will be deployed against this plan. No lie will be too
big, no scare too fanciful, no warning too grave, no fear too fanciful,
as the opponents of this scheme try to destroy it.
''There is no tartan tax. The tartan tax is a lie. A power is not a
tax. Nobody in Scotland will pay more or less under a Scottish
parliament unless they vote for it.
''The business community in Scotland is an integral part of Scottish
life, and Scotland's future self-evidently depends on business and
industry feeling good, optimistic and ambitious.''
He warned that society was ''on the edge of a real social crisis''
fuelled by high unemployment, crime and the drugs trade.
But he said that could be avoided by building communities and
harnessing the ''spirit of enterprise which Scotland once famously
pioneered''.
He told the top company managers that Labour would:
* Reassure investors that Scotland was a profitable place to settle.
* Encourage diversification.
* Develop a new strategy of inward investment to attract better jobs.
* Improve training and therefore the skills of the workforce.
* Strengthen research and development.
* Develop a partnership between public and private bodies and cut down
on bureaucracy.
* Concentrate on the problems faced in rural Scotland.

A PRISON warder who attacked a woman after an all-day drinking session
was jailed for three months yesterday.
Douglas Mack, 26, an officer at Saughton prison, Edinburgh, was
convicted after a two-day trial before a jury at Haddington Sheriff
Court last month.
He was found guilty of assaulting a 31-year-old shop assistant to her
injury, but was cleared of attempting to rape her.
Sentencing Mack, Sheriff Robert McCallum said: ''This was an
unprovoked attack on a complete stranger and it was very, very
distressing for her.''
Mack, of High Street, East Linton, had denied that on March 12 this
year he attempted to ravish the woman in Fa'side Road, Tranent.
The court heard the woman tell how she dissuaded Mack by claiming she
was pregnant.
Mack said he had been drinking all day and could recall little of what
happened.
Defence solicitor Mr Alex Prentice told the court yesterday that Mack
had previously been of impeccable character.
He said Mack would lose his job and his prison service house.

CARE agencies yesterday attacked new home help charges for 1400
elderly and disabled people in Lothian.
Revised assessments introduced by the Labour-controlled regional
council mean that 10% of its 14,000 home help clients who previously had
a free service will now have to pay #4.50 an hour.
The measures, which are expected to yield between #300,000 and
#400,000, also extend to those on income support who have disability,
attendance, or other benefits.
Miss Maureen O'Neill, director of Age Concern Scotland, said the move
was regrettable.
''Home care is the linchpin of community care, but there is a great
disparity in charges levied in different areas of Scotland.
''Our great concern is that when charges are imposed, irrespective if
they are means-tested or not, people do not ask for them because they
are frightened of the cost. It becomes a form of self-rationing of
services.''
Ms Jan Killeen, assistant director of Alzheimer's Scotland/Action on
Dementia, said: ''This came as a surprise to me, and there certainly
should have been more open consultation by Lothian.
''But local authorities are being forced into this position because
there is not enough money being put into the community care pot.''
Lothian estimates two-thirds of people will still receive their home
help service free, but maximum weekly charges for those on higher
incomes had gone up from #28 to #45.
Critics say the changes have not been thought through properly and
have led to confusion and hardship among old and needy users.
However, acting senior depute director of social work, Mr Iain
Paterson, said: ''We needed to maximise income to maintain and develop
services. We have just introduced it and we are monitoring things to
keep a check on any problems or hardship caused.''

THE sunlit shores of the Firth of Forth were the appropriate backdrop
yesterday for the launch of the eleventh album by Celtic rock band,
Runrig.
Entitled Mara (the Gaelic for sea) the 10-track recording features the
Scottish National Orchestra, the Hebridean Gaelic Choir, saxophonist
Andy Sheppard and New York jazzman, Joe Locke.
It will be on sale from Monday.
The album precedes a nationwide tour, which reaches north of the
Border in December.
Meanwhile, pop chart compilers CIN is investigating allegations of Top
20 rigging in record shops across the country.
CIN removed the song Santa Maria, by Croatian singer Tatjana, from the
charts in September when suspicions were first aroused.
Now the record's producer Mike Stock -- of Stock, Aitken and Waterman,
who made stars out of Jason Donovan, Kylie Minogue and Rick Astley --
has offered a #10,000 reward to find out who was behind any ''sting''
and is understood to be threatening legal action against CIN for
dropping the record.
Ms Catherine Pusey, chart director of CIN, said: ''We monitor sales
patterns of every sale in 2000 record shops of all sizes all over the
country because it is our mandate to preserve the accuracy and integrity
of the charts.
''With this record there were unusual sales patterns and we took it
out of the charts while we began an investigation.
''We have not been contacted by Mike Stock and have never suggested he
was involved.''

A SHERIFF yesterday called for child safety devices to be a mandatory
fitting on all windows above ground level.
Sheriff George Presslie's comments came at the end of a fatal accident
inquiry into the death of 21-month-old Ewan Smith, of Moir Crescent,
Musselburgh, who died after falling 30ft from the window of his mother's
council home.
Sheriff Presslie called for special window opening restrictor devices
to be specially designed to a new national standard, and tested so they
could not be interfered with by children.
The inquiry heard that Ewan died in the Western General Hospital,
Edinburgh, on June 9 last year, two days after falling from the
second-storey bedroom window.
Attracted by the sound of an ice-cream van, it is thought the boy
climbed onto the window sill from a bed, accidentally overcame the latch
and a restrictor catch and fell to the ground.
Sheriff Presslie said the fatal accident occurred against a background
of well-intentioned action and a degree of foreseeability.
The emergency window restrictor catch in the boy's bedroom had not met
certain criteria, said the sheriff.
As a result, he saw no reason to suppose a similar accident could not
happen again.
He said there was nothing unusual or unreasonable about the boy's care
by his mother, Ms Jackie Smith, and formally found that Ewan had died as
a result of head injuries received in the window fall.
The Scottish Office is to study the fatal accident report.

A JOURNALIST with the influential France Football magazine yesterday
apologised for his ''big mistake'' in suggesting that warring Rangers
fans caused the deaths of 66 Celtic supporters in the Ibrox disaster.
Frank Simon's profile of Old Firm sectarianism -- headlined ''Glasgow,
or the clash of two worlds'' -- also described today's Rangers fans as
barbarians and ''amongst the most hated in Europe''.
That viewpoint was rubbished yesterday by Ibrox operations' director
Alistair Hood, who stressed not one Rangers supporter had been arrested
at European games, home or away, in the past nine years.
Published prior to the Old Firm being hoofed out of Europe this week,
the article makes bleak, depressing, and frightening reading for
football fans on the Continent.
The city of Glasgow fares little better. It is said to be cut in two
-- one part pro-Rangers, the other supporting Celtic -- although the
author acknowledged that ''on the evidence it is an image that has been
greatly over-simplified''.
Simon's historical account of the reasons behind Old Firm rivalry
includes glaring errors -- such as King William of Orange marrying Mary
Queen of Scots.
But the most appalling insult refers to the Ibrox disaster of 1971,
still etched in the memories of both clubs.
After pointing out Celtic had no hesitation in employing Protestant
players, and its European Cup winning manager Jock Stein was Protestant,
the article goes on:
''This co-existence, far from peaceful, has seen some dramatic
episodes, most notably on January 2, 1971, when 66 people died on the
Celtic side as they left Ibrox Park after the traditional derby
match....''
Simon admitted yesterday the tragedy was not due to crowd violence but
to ill-fated movements in a section of terracing occupied by Rangers
rather than Celtic fans, where 145 were also injured.
''I apologise for what I wrote,'' he said. ''It was a big mistake. It
was not intentional, based on a misunderstanding.
''I have taken calls from Scots fans, and we have made a correction,
pointing out the 66 killed was not due to battles but a crowd movement
at the end of the game.''
But he stood by his assertion that Rangers fans are hated in Europe,
especially when compared with the behaviour of Celtic followers. He also
defended the tenor of his article that the Old Firm's deep-rooted
rivalry, and Glasgow's image, have little to do with football but with
Scottish and Irish history, religion, and politics.
The article, which warned that the Ibrox faithful ''do not hesitate''
to bombard people with projectiles, appears to give Celtic fans a much
easier ride.
However, they ''regularly lose self-control'' when talking about their
rivals -- a reference to an interview with TV's Gamesmaster presenter
and Radio 5 Live Sportscall host Dominik Diamond.
Of Rangers fans, Diamond is quoted in the mass circulation magazine:
''These are the ugliest people on the planet. You would say they are
missing a piece of their face, or that it is completely deformed....If
the the people look like mutants, you are in Larkhall (one of the Huns'
bases).''
He said yesterday: ''I think the writer was liberal in the
translation, and no-one should take anything I say about Rangers or
Celtic seriously. It's all part of the wind-up.
''I do recall being asked the difference between the fans, and saying
Celtic's were more physically attractive. I certainly hope that is the
case. It's obvious I would never say people in Larkhall are deformed.''
Simon, who heads the magazine's section for French-speaking Africans,
argues in his report that Celtic is far less sectarian than Rangers --
and more chivalrous.
The club is said to be hopeful that ''one day they, the Papists, will
stop being targeted by their only real rival,'' and that: ''The Catholic
minority in Scotland will be accepted as it is, and football in Glasgow
will stop being a means of releasing tension and a boxing ring where
political-religious problems are fought out.''
Simon, who spent three days in Scotland and based his profile mainly
on interviews with fans, wrote that today's Rangers support --
''anti-Catholic by definition,'' is founded on descendants of Irish
Protestants who settled in Scotland last century. Loyal to the Crown and
''proponents of keeping Northern Ireland in the UK,'' club colours
corresponded to the Union Jack, the British flag.
Celtic, laying claim to Irish origins, had ''quite logically'' green
and white colours ''recalling the green of Erin''. Over the years it had
developed a much less sectarian spirit than Rangers, not hesitating to
employ Protestant players.
The article, after referring to the battery of Union Jacks, insulting
songs about the Pope or ''everything that is not blue,'' states that
hated Rangers supporters are found on every continent; are extremely
well organised, and keep in regular contact.
Mr Hood responded: ''I do not know where the author has been in the
past 10 years.''
The club had gone 21 games on the Continent in nine years ''without a
single arrest before, during or after the games''.
He said Rangers had received many letters from police, embassies, and
other authorities praising their fans for their good behaviour.
Celtic declined to comment.
* An interview in France Football last year is reputed to have led to
Basile Boli's subsequent transfer to Monaco after only a handful of
Ibrox appearances. Signed from Marseilles for #2.7m, Boli savaged
manager Walter Smith's tactics, and his team mates for having the
''wrong attitude'', for the failure to beat AEK Athens in the European
Cup.

SCOTTISH Militant Labour councillor Tommy Sheridan escaped a jail term
yesterday after appeal judges substituted a #150 fine for a 30-day
sentence imposed after a poll tax protest.
Immediately after the decision, however, Sheridan made it clear that
he would not pay the fine, since he did not think he had committed any
crime.
If he carries out his threat, in a few weeks' time the sheriff court
at Greenock will impose the alternative, which is a prison sentence of
seven days.
In Sheridan's opinion, the decision had undermined the warrant sale
procedure and hastened the day when it would disappear from the law of
Scotland.
Along with Scottish Militant Labour organiser Keith Baldassara, 37,
Sheridan appealed against the 30-day sentences imposed by Sheriff John
Herald at Greenock earlier this year.
The appearance at Greenock Sheriff Court followed a protest at efforts
to carry out debt recovery procedures at the home of a single mother in
Greenock.
At the Justiciary Appeal Court in Edinburgh yesterday, Sheridan, 31,
told Lords Sutherland, MacLean and Murray that he wished to address the
court on behalf of himself and Baldassara.
He explained that the crux of the case was the sheriff's view that
they should both be treated the same as anyone else who appeared on a
breach of the peace charge at Greenock Sheriff Court with previous
convictions.
Sheridan added: ''We do not seek any special treatment, but we do ask
that the law does not remain blind to the particular and peculiar
circumstances in this case, which involves a debt recovery procedure
using the warrant sale process.
''It is a process which we feel quite passionately has no place in a
modern and civilised society.''
Lord Sutherland warned him that the court was not prepared to listen
to a political speech, but Sheridan insisted that to put the case in its
proper context he had to explain the background that the overwhelming
majority of the poor in Scotland could not afford to pay the poll tax.
He explained that he had taken part in a peaceful protest after being
asked to go to the aid of a single mother who faced having her household
goods sold at a warrant sale over a poll tax debt.
He admitted that he had refused to move when asked to do so by police.
''We feel that to have moved would have given tacit consent to an act
which we believe to be barbaric.''
Lord MacLean told Sheridan he had presented his case very articulately
and eloquently, and asked if he had any other suggestion to make other
than that the appropriate sentence was an admonition.
Sheridan replied: ''We have nothing else to suggest. To accept a fine
or any form of punishment would be to accept that that we committed a
crime for which we should be punished.''
Lord Sutherland, who delivered the opinion of the court, said that
both men had asked to be admonished on the basis that the court accepted
that warrant sales were barbaric.
''We are not really in a position to do anything of the sort for the
simple reason that the law permits poinding and warrant sales. It is not
for us to say the law is wrong either legally or morally.''
They fined Sheridan #150, and Balassara #125.
Earlier this week, Sheridan conducted another successful appeal before
the same judges following a breach of the peace conviction at an M77
protest in Glasgow. In that case the judges reduced a #750 fine to #150.

* Meanwhile, Cardinal Winning yesterday stepped up the pressure on
Strathclyde region's ruling Labour group, which recently ducked taking a
controversial decision affecting denominational schools, writes Barclay
McBain.
Councillors decided that the new unitary councils should tackle
whether religion should be added to the tests which determine whether a
child can secure entry to a school under the placing requests
legislation.
The cardinal said that the decision could call into question Labour's
commitment to denominational schooling.
In an interview with Flourish Cardinal Winning said: ''Catholic
schools are built, in the first place, to serve the needs of the
Catholic community.
''That principle should also be applied to the placing requests
regulations.''

Kirsty Scott goes in determined pursuit of the newspaper owners who
shun publicity.
THEY'RE known as the Invisible Men, two secretive individuals so
obsessed with privacy that they haven't given an interview in nine years
and have been officially captured on film together only once.
When it became clear that David Rowat Barclay and Frederick Hugh
Barclay, better known in the plural as the Barclay twins, had set their
sights on the Scotsman after snapping up the Ritz hotel in London, the
media rushed en masse to their clippings files for more information on
the pair.
There wasn't much to work on. We knew that they were fabulously rich
identical twins who considered themselves to be Scots, favoured
pinstripe, and could, reportedly, be told apart only by the left/right
partings in their hair. They apparently enjoyed ballroom dancing and
were building a neo-Gothic castle with a moat and a 200ft swimming pool
on the remote Channel Island of Brecqhou.
So far, so soap opera, but the commercial history of the twins, the
story that will interest the staff and subscribers of the North Bridge
publications, reads more like a how-to business manual than a
mini-series. In 30 years of business, they have amassed a fortune said
to be worth about #550m.
No-one appears to be sure how old they are -- the variations range
from 57 to 61 -- but we do know they were born in London to Scottish
Catholic parents -- Frederick and Beatrice Barclay -- who had moved
south from Edinburgh to a multi-tenanted house in the west of the
capital.
Their father, a travelling salesman, is said to have died tragically
after a freak reaction to anaesthetic during an operation when the boys
were 12, and they left school in their early teens to train as estate
agents and launch themselves into the world of business.
From there, they moved into converting old boarding houses in
Bayswater, into hotels, then on to developing a wide portfolio of
business concerns, encompassing casinos, shipping and newspapers.
In 1975, they opened the prestigious Howard Hotel on the Thames
embankment; in 1983, they bought the famous Ellerman shipping line, and
two years later they bought two of London's railway hotels, the
Grosvenor and the Charing Cross and resold them to Intasun.
In 1988, they moved back into shipping with the purchase of the Gotaas
Larsen line. During the 1990s they bought stakes in Sir Tim Bell's
public relations company and in London Casinos. In 1992 they acquired
The European and earlier this month they made their highest-profile
acquisition of the Ritz, for a reported #75m.
They are also said to own Riviera Radio, which broadcasts to Monaco, a
section of Motown Records and part of the National Enquirer, the US
tabloid. Last year, they were rumoured to have paid #200m for the
Automotive Financial Group of car dealerships.
Any concerns about their takeover at North Bridge have been alleviated
by the pair's hands-off approach at The European. They bought the paper
after Robert Maxwell's death and invested in it.
At the time, a spokesman for the twins said they felt the developments
in Europe gave ''tremendous opportunities to turn what is already a
quality international newspaper into a hugely successful one''.
The editor of The European, Mr Charlie Garside, said last night that
he had written to the editors of the Scottish titles to congratulate
them on their new ownership. He said the twins were investors and had
obviously recognised potential in the Scottish publications.
''Staff here have much to be grateful for. They took us on in 1992
when we had a staff of one. Now The European employs 140 people.''
Mr Garside said he had met the twins, but they had not actually been
into the paper's London office. ''The independence I have enjoyed as
editor here is quite fantastic, and clearly we have managed to show
growth in circulation.''
There also is a belief that their acquisition of the Scottish papers
betrays a deep affection for Scotland and their own heritage. One source
recently told The Herald Business Diary that he had met one of the twins
on a luxury train and they were still ''brave at heart.''
It is also understood that they had expressed an interest in aiding
Hibernian Football Club at the time of the threatened Hearts takeover,
and in 1990 they offered #7.6m to keep the statue The Three Graces in
the UK as long, as it was put on display between the Victoria &amp; Albert
and a Scottish institution.
Another close associate of the two has also dismissed fears that they
might adopt an interventionist approach in any newly-acquired business.
''They buy businesses and let the people who've been running them go on
running them while the brothers get involved in how the businesses are
financed,'' said the associate.
''They have done it successfully for a long time. For instance, they
have owned the Howard Hotel for 20 years and many of the staff have been
with them all that time.''
The twins' spokesman, Sir Tim Bell, said that he couldn't provide any
biographical or business detail on the brothers, not even their age,
which he didn't know. ''They are a private company and everybody knows
that they value their privacy,'' he said.
He also dismissed any concern that the brothers would want to play a
hands-on role at the Scotsman. ''They're not going to sit in the
publisher's office and tell people what to do. They are private
businessmen and they have other people run their businesses.''
While their latest acquisitions have thrust them well and truly into
the business spotlight, their private lives have always been carefully
screened from public and press view.
They base themselves in Monte Carlo and are both married; David to Zoe
Newton, formerly the National Dairy Council's milk girl, with whom he
has a son, Aidan. Frederick has a Japanese wife, Miroko Kuzusaka, and
they have a teenage daughter, Amanda.
They are said to mix privately with leading businessmen and women, the
movers and shakers of the corporate world, and count Baroness Thatcher
as a friend.
The construction of the castle on Brecqhou has been the subject of
much curiosity and wild imaginings. They bought the tiny island, nine
miles from Jersey, in 1993 for a reported #2.3m.
The construction of their new home, called simply Project '95, is a
massive undertaking. Huge slabs of blue-grey granite have been brought
in from Spain and there is talk of a moat, towers, turrets and a grand
central courtyard. Contractors working on the site have reportedly been
ordered not to talk about the work, least of all to the press.
Journalists are routinely frustrated in their efforts to pin the twins
down on either their professional or private lives, and no matter how
prominent the latest acquisition, it is unlikely that the purchase of
the Scotsman will make them any more voluble.
''Privacy,'' as David Barclay once said in a rare public declaration,
''is a valuable commodity,'' and if the twins have a reputation for
anything, it is for jealously guarding that most precious of all their
assets.

A ROMAN Catholic newspaper has warned that if the Court of Session
allows Scotland's first legal mercy killing, it could open the
floodgates to euthanasia.
Appearing a matter of days before the case of Mrs Janet Johnston, a
coma patient in Law Hospital, Carluke, is due to be called, Flourish --
the official newspaper of the archdiocese of Glasgow, regarded as the
mouthpiece of Cardinal Thomas Winning -- states: ''To accept such a
principle -- to sanction killing a patient because a serious and
hopeless illness is distressing for family, friends and the medical and
nursing professions -- would establish a precedent which would open the
floodgates to euthanasia on a scale hitherto unimagined.''
Mrs Johnston has been in a persistent vegetative state at Law Hospital
for more than three years and is being kept alive by artificial feeding.
The Law Hospital NHS Trust, with the support of Mrs Johnston's husband
Peter, 53, and daughter, Linda Bryce, 30, is petitioning the court to be
allowed to withdraw artificial feeding -- a move which doctors believe
will inevitably hasten her death.
Neither Mr Johnston nor his daughter could be contacted yesterday, but
in the past they have said they wished Mrs Johnston to be allowed to die
in peace and with dignity.
Flourish added: ''With as many as 200 patients in Scottish hospitals
said to be in a condition similar to Mrs Johnston the implications of
the forthcoming judgment could be wide-ranging.''

Joe Donnelly chews the fat with a scientist who could have seriously
bad news for the dieting industry.
IMAGINE a future without the Roly Polys, without Bernard Manning; a
future where Weightwatchers might be remembered as a quaint organisation
that used to deal with some weird condition known as obesity.
Imagine a world where people could get an injection that would kill
the fat cells in their body. Not shrink them, disguise them, or somehow
disable them, but kill them off.
Believe it or not, a Scottish researcher is on the verge of making
this a reality.
Dr David Flint, of the Hannah Research Institute in Ayr has pioneered
the development of a unique method of immunisation . . . against fat. It
works in animals, and recent advances make it possible to treat humans.
He says: ''We propose to develop a treatment for obesity in humans based
on antibodies we've developed which kill fat cells. You can get
immunised against things which don't belong in the body but there are
conditions in which defences turn on parts of the body, or types of
cells, for instance in rheumatoid arthritis in which the defence system
goes wrong and begins to attack the host.
''We have used active immunisation. In countries where Hepatitis B is
an endemic disease, rather than being vaccinated, you are given
antibodies to the disease, which is passive immunisation and fine for
proteins the body has not seen before.
''Active immunisation is using a weakened form of the disease which is
identified by the defences which manufacture antibodies against the
specific infection.''
There's a rare condition called partial lipidostrophy (wasting of
adipose tissue), which causes an immune response to fat cells. A serum
containing this auto-antibody can lyse the cells (breaking down their
cell walls) in test tube conditions and it's believed that a similar
process could account for fat cell loss in live tests. The loss of fat
tissue in both humans and animals with this condition seems to be
permanent, suggesting that once adipocytes are lysed, they will not be
replaced. Now David and fellow researchers propose to develop a
treatment for obesity in humans based on the action on fat cells by
human antibodies which specifically act on cell membranes.
''Antibodies to adipocytes don't exist in nature, you have to make
them yourself. It's been demonstrated in other species, and in animals
it's not really a problem to make them. Using recombinant DNA techniques
we can get sheep cells to manufacture high quantities of pig antibodies
which you take out and give to pigs.
''We take the young animal, kill the fat cells then leave the animal
to grow normally. It grows much leaner than normal and the effects are
long lasting. By the time the animal is mature, the effect is still
there. It's a 'single dose' treatment. The actual mature weight is
unaffected. The animals are the same size and weight, but there's much
more lean tissue. We can reduce the fat in animals by 30%.''
For humans, the story gets more complex.David Flint says: ''A few
years ago the state of the art was that it could only be used in animals
because you can't use animal antibodies on humans. Based on recombinant
DNA technology, there's been a great deal of progress and it's led to
the production of human antibodies from animal tissue in test tubes in
the lab.
''It's exactly the same as human antibody as if it had been made
inside the body. It is very safe. The antibody is treated by the body as
if it belongs there. Once inside, though, it attacks fat cells.
''We believe it will be a treatment for people who are grossly obese.
We have been addressing the question of why fats are deposited by
different cells and it may be conceivable to be able to target cells in
different sites. It's impossible to get more than three quarters of the
cells to die, so there is no danger of the body being totally denuded of
its fat.
''We have shown you can get antibodies to fat cells and get them to
work with considerable effect. The biggest stumbling block is the
concept of getting it through administrative and legislative bodies for
clinical use. Once you get a human antibody, it can only be used in
humans and we have the antibody. Whether we ever get permission to treat
people with it remains to be seen.''
The trail from laboratory tests to human trials is set to be a long
and arduous one. David is on the board and scientific adviser to ObeSys
Ltd, a company formed from US venture capital to develop the research
for human use.
It seems only a matter of time before a simple immunisation will make
people thin again. Good news for David Flint in these body-besotted
times. He could become more of a pin-up than Mel Gibson.

A SCOTTISH soldier who absconded from training camp to enjoy a drunken
night out murdered a passer-by who discovered him in hiding from the
police, a court was told yesterday.
Private Gary Sinclair, 23, from the 1st Scottish Highlanders, killed
Wayne Garwood, 25, with a ''swift, competent, and savage attack'',
Norwich Crown Court was told.
Mr Garwood had stumbled across Mr Sinclair hiding in a back garden. He
had, alleged the prosecution, already attacked two Welsh Guardsmen.
Mr Garwood asked the defendant, ''Are you alright, mate?'' said Mr
Graham Parkins, QC, prosecuting.
Mr Sinclair launched himself at Mr Garwood, headbutting him, and
severely beating him around the head, it was claimed.
Mr Sinclair then removed Mr Garwood's clothes, the prosecution
contended, because his were stained with blood from the defendant's
hand.
The court heard that Mr Sinclair, based at the Dreghorn Barracks,
Edinburgh, was training at Wretham Army Camp, Thetford, Norfolk, prior
to duty in Northern Ireland.
He was in a foul mood on the night in question, said the prosecution,
and after closing time, launched an unprovoked attack on two Welsh
Guards. Mr Sinclair is also charged with stealing a wallet belonging to
one of the men.
He ran off after the attack, fearing he may be caught by the police,
went up an alleyway and scaled a wall into a garden to hide, said Mr
Parkins.
''Wayne Garwood then arrived for his fateful chance meeting.''
Mr Garwood's injuries included a broken nose, black eyes, head
injuries, bruising to his chest, shoulders, upper arms and elbows.
Mr Sinclair denies charges of robbing Welsh Guard Andrew Williams and
of murdering Wayne Garwood.
The trial continues.

* THE Rolling Stones have cut a new disc to make sure they'll not fade
away. The old street-fighting men of rock'n'roll, have embraced the age
of multimedia with their first ever CD-Rom released today by Virgin
Records.
The CD features what is billed as exclusive footage and mixes from the
double album Voodoo Lounge and invites fans to ''hang out'' with Mick,
Keith, Charlie and Ronnie in the Rolling Stones fantasy world of rock.
The Voodoo Lounge CD-ROM is designed with hardly any interface to
allow viewers to plug into the environment unimpeded by menus and
prompts, thus enabling the converted to join the band live on stage in
Paris in the midst of scenes filmed using a camera on Ronnie Wood's
glasses. There's also backstage antics filmed by Mick Jagger, plus a jam
session with Keith and Ronnie.
In addition, there are interviews with the band plus new mixes of
Voodoo tracks and a gallery of Ronnie Wood's original artwork. Described
as unpredictable and more than a little naughty, the CD scenario is set
in a 3D plantation in Louisiana, within a mansion alive with temptation,
some of it involving the band's hangers-on, unusual scenes in the
toilets, psychedelic backgrounds and scantily clad women. What a
surprise.
We can only pray that Des O'Connor doesn't jump on this bandwagon. The
Voodoo Lounge CD-Rom, developed by the Stones themselves is selling at
#29.99.

EONS ago, your frontiersman's grandad bought a Grundig tape recorder.
It was full of valves, weighed a ton, used a mile of tape and you needed
a degree in particle physics to get it started.
Fortunately the incriminating and tuneless high-pitched rendering of
Scottish Soldier is extinct, but the memory of that machine remains
fixed as a marvel of modern electronics of the day.
How things have changed. Here's Grundig's latest piece of cutting-edge
technology. At first glance we wondered what on earth it was. A second
glance still had us beat. It's called Space Fidelity and it's a
completely new concept in sound reproduction.
Grundig advises: ''Forget what you think, just believe what you
hear.'' We haven't heard it yet, but we do hear it's the bees knees.
Space Fidelity is at the very least a nice-looking piece of hi-tech
sculpture. It's a stylish silver tower that wouldn't look out of place
in a modern art exhibition. What it doesn't have is a bank of speakers
set around the room to achieve stereo sound.
It uses a system Grundig describes as APS, or Acoustically Polarised
Stereo which utilises sound particle velocity instead of the acoustic
pressure of traditional loudspeakers. That jargon, of course, has our
pair of deuces well beat, but apparently it's a ''highly intelligent''
system which delivers pure sound to the human ear no matter where in the
room the said ear is located. Space Fidelity seems all the more
remarkable in that its revolutionary sound system is achieved by the use
of mechanics rather than electronics. Grundig boast that the listener is
''coated with sound, bathed by a body of life music, with nothing lost
in the translation.'' And up to 300 watts too, with no cables to trip
over
The free standing unit has CD, tape, amp, tuner, and six built-in
speakers that target the sound directly at the listener. Even if it
didn't work, it would still look terrific in the corner, for those with
about #1000 to spare.

A WOMAN who strangled her boyfriend with his Rangers scarf after
suffering a decade of abuse, walked free yesterday.
Lord Clyde told 35-year-old Davina McAulay: ''You have, from all
accounts, been living the last 10 years with someone who seems to
deserve the title of monster.''
Deferring sentence for 12 months, the judge said: ''To describe the
case as tragic would, I think, be an understatement.
''Homicide is a serious offence, but there are cases where any
significant period of imprisonment is quite inappropriate and I believe
this is such a case.''
The judge had been told that the dead man, Daniel Mann, was a chronic
alcoholic who was obsessed with the occult, Adolf Hitler and the French
Foreign Legion.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, McAulay admitted the culpable homicide
of Mann, 42, by strangling him with his scarf on July 18 this year in
their home at McQuibbans Buildings, Shore Road, Perth.
Mr Craig Scott, advocate-depute, told the court that both had been
drinking heavily that day and, in mid-afternoon, neighbours heard a
disturbance before everything went quiet.
Later that day, McAulay went to a florist's shop in a distressed
condition and bought some flowers and a funeral card.
On the way home she told the taxi driver that she had suffered years
of misery but he was now dead and the flowers were for his grave.
That evening, McAulay's sister called at the house and was told that
Mann had crashed out in the bedroom. When the sister went in she saw
Mann lying dead and semi-naked on the floor.
When police arrived at the house, they found the flowers lying between
Mann's legs.
McAulay told police: ''Something just snapped in me. I just thought to
myself I went through too much. I said 'I am sorry Danny, I can't take
any more.' I don't even know where I got the strength.''
Mann had been lying on his back and she had got his football scarf and
tied it round his neck.
''I snapped because I went through holy torture for 10 years and I
couldn't take more.''
When McAulay was medically examimed, she was found to have old and
fresh injuries.
Mr Scott said that it was the Crown's understanding that, under the
influence of drink, Mann behaved appallingly towards McAulay and, at the
time of the killing, she had been provoked during a violent struggle.
Mr Douglas Small, defence counsel, said that McAulay, who had been
married twice, had suffered ''systematic physical, mental and sexual
abuse.
''The deceased is properly described as being a thoroughly evil
person.''
Mann was possessive and jealous and refused to let McAulay go out on
her own. He would lock her in their flat for days on end, giving her a
bucket for a toilet.
He also sexually abused and degraded McAulay, who was petrified of
him.
''On one occasion when she challenged him about his perversions, she
was knocked unconscious and her jaw fractured,'' added Mr Small.
During their time together, Mann had fractured McAulay's jaw three or
four times and, whenever she was taken to hospital, Mann threatened to
kill her mother if she told anyone what was happening.
''On many occasions she attempted to get away from him to return to
her parents, only to be pursued by him and physically brought back. Her
parents were as terrified of him as she was.''
If the case had gone to trial, many witnesses would have testified
about the brutal treatment Mann had inflicted on McAulay.
One of Mann's former girlfriends, who had also been abused by him, had
said: ''I am totally convinced he was a psychopath.''
As she left court, McAulay said: ''I'm glad it's all over and I have
got it behind me. I am so relieved and I just want to start my life
again.
''I want to thank everyone who has supported me -- my friends and
family, my lawyers, and especially everybody at Cornton Vale prison.''

<HEADLINE>New offer of #6m for Post Office building</HEADLINE>

A PRIVATE developer has bid #6m -- double Glasgow Development Agency's
original offer -- for the Post Office building which overlooks the
city's George Square.
It is unlikely that the GDA, acting on behalf of trustees who want the
property for a National Gallery of Scottish Art and Design, would have
increased its #3m bid when offers closed at noon yesterday. Another
commercial developer is believed to have offered at least #5m.
The original deadline was extended a fortnight ago when the Post
Office cited exceptional interest and wide-ranging proposals for the
building. It also introduced a new requirement, a philatelic museum,
which would reduce retail and office space by 20%.
However, despite the apparent cut in the building's commercial value,
it is understood the original front-runner, Aberdeen-based Jarlaw, has
now offered #6m.
Jarlaw, whose original tender of #4.5m was way above that of rivals,
has called on Scottish Office Ministers to block any sale until concerns
over the 11th-hour decision to extend the deadline are resolved.
A PO spokesman said the winner will be announced as soon as possible.
The tenders will be scrutinised before going to the board for a
decision.

* ICL HAVE launched a new service they claim will revolutionise the
sale and delivery of publications. ICL Commands is the first on-line
academic library, announced at the recent Frankfurt Book Fair.
The company have already sold the service to Academic Press, a leading
scientific, technical and medical publisher. ICL will be operating the
publisher's IDEAL service, an international desktop electronic access
library, said to be the first global on-line library.
IDEAL will use the Internet to increase Academic Press journals by
bringing them directly to readers' digital desktops. ICL say the
system's key strength is that it addresses major issues facing the
publishing industry today, including access control, unlicensed copying
and rights management.
EDINBURGH web creation and management company Communicata Ltd have
launched their I/PRO web users profile system to provide critical data
to measure the worth of the web and the value of electronic advertising.
The system tags users access with an ID code which identifies requests
from the same Internet protocol address then tracks and measures usage
to provide statistical information. Comunicata's operations director
Tony Purcell say they will target organisations including owners and
managers of web sites. I/PRO is designed to replace outdated and
inaccurate statistical packages. So far a standard to measure the value
of electronic advertising has yet to be devised.
THE Worms have turned . . . and stormed the Internet. Worms, of
course, is the video game which is already a cult icon. It's just over a
month since the shareware version of the game was posted on Team 17's
World Wide Web site, and already it's been accessed to the tune of more
than 20,000 hits every week.
As well as being available on Team 17's page, Worms are crawling on
the GamesMaster GamesNet pages. The game will also be available, from
this month, on all formats including PCX, CD-Rom, Amiga and Playstation.

THE throwaway waste cobs from sweetcorn may soon help produce
alternative air-conditioning systems for homes, offices and factories.
American agricultural engineer Michael Ladisch developed a system that
used ground corn grits as a cheap and renewable method of extracting
water from corn-made ethanol for use in car fuel.
The system is now used to produce more than half of all the ethanol in
the United States, 750 million gallons of ethanol processed annually
from 288 million bushels of corn.
Since the first development in 1979, Ladisch has developed ways to use
corn grits to dry air and other gases needed in industrial applications
such as paint spraying and ozone generation.
He now is studying ways to use corn grits to replace the
ozone-depleting air conditioners that cool and dehumidify homes and
cars. For example, manufacturers looking for alternatives to standard
air conditioners have started developing systems that use evaporative
coolers with desiccants, materials used to remove moisture from air.
Ladisch says he believes that, just as in industrial dryers, grits can
provide a lower-cost, environmentally-friendly substitute for the
inorganic desiccants currently used in these new cooling systems.

<TEXT>
AN 11-year-old victim of bullying was left hanging by his tie in a
school gym.
Wayne Parker, who was rescued by a member of staff, pulled ligaments
and tendons in his neck and suffered bruising to his neck and face.
Police said: ''We could easily have had a fatality on our hands.''
Colin Parker, a 36-year-old prison officer, said his son blacked out
during the incident at Hayling School, Hayling Island, Hants. He is now
wearing a neck brace after receiving hospital treatment.
Mr Parker, of Manor Road, Hayling Island, said yesterday: ''The school
rang my wife at home yesterday lunchtime after Wayne was found tied to
the wall bars in the hall.
''I was on my way home from work, but as soon as I got the message
when I got home I rushed to the school as well.''
Wayne was treated at the school's medical centre but the couple took
him to hospital ''because he said he had stopped breathing while he was
hanging there. The doctor said it could have been a lot more serious and
he could have fractured his neck.
''He certainly blacked out for some time because he can't remember
exactly what happened.''
Mr Parker said: ''Wayne told me that he had been playing with some
girls in the field during the lunchbreak and they had put mascara and
lipstick on his face.
''Wayne had found that amusing, but when he went to wash it off one of
the girls grabbed him under the arm and dragged him into the hall to
show the other kids what they had done.
''This lad grabbed him by the tie and dragged him over to the wall
bars and tied him up. He tied the tie on to one of the wall bars as
Wayne faced the wall.'' His son had been ''on tip toes'' when he was
freed.
''Wayne was struggling because he was choking and having trouble
getting oxygen because the tie had been pulled so tight around his neck
it was gagging him.''
Mr Parker added: ''This whole incident has really scared my kid. It is
really going to affect him and he's going to be nervous when he goes
back to school. But he's got another five years at that school, and I
don't intend to take him out of it.
''I'm glad that the police are involved. I did not want to get the lad
into trouble but the hospital called the police because of the injuries
they saw.''
His son, who is 4ft 3ins, will see a medical consultant on Monday,
''when it will be decided how long he needs to take off school. We are
hoping there will be no permanent damage. The scariest part is knowing
that anything could have happened. It terrifies me because it could have
ended in tragedy because it got out out of hand.
''Wayne's message to anyone who is being bullied is: 'If you're being
bullied, make sure you tell someone about it. Don't be scared of their
victimisation, just make sure you tell someone about it'.''
Wayne, who has a six-year-old brother, is a keen hockey player and
likes theatre.
Detective Chief Inspector Nick Imber, of Hants police, described the
incident as ''a nasty attack of bullying that could have had tragic
consequences''.
Derek Holmes, the school's chairman of governors, said: ''Any incident
which affects children in this way is obviously very serious and I'm
sure it will be treated very seriously by the school.''
The school was the subject of a harsh report by a Government education
standards inspector last year. The report criticised the way it was run
and expressed concerns over health and safety issues.
Head teacher Mike Ellis launched an investigation into the incident
and issued a statement describing it as ''deplorable''.
Hampshire County Council said it was awaiting developments in the
police inquiry before pursuing its own disciplinary action.
* Police said a 14-year-old boy was reported for causing grievous
bodily harm in connection with the incident.

A WESTERN Isles youth stabbed a 15-year-old for shouting, laughing and
whistling at his grandmother's funeral, the High Court was told
yesterday.
The Stornoway youngster required emergency surgery after his lung was
punctured in the attack on the night of November 25 last year.
''The surgeon considered this was a potentially life-threatening stab
wound and the boy could have died if he had not been treated,''
advocate-depute Archie Clancey told the High Court in Inverness.
Kenneth MacIver, 17, of Cearn Tharasaidh, Stornoway, admitted stabbing
the youngster on the body with a fishing knife, compressing his throat
and presenting the knife at his face, all to his severe injury and to
the danger of his life.
John MacRae, 17, of Guershader, Laxdale, Lewis, and Mark MacIver, 16,
of Cearn Phabaidh, Stornoway, pleaded guilty to assaulting the
15-year-old, by repeatedly punching and kicking him about the face and
body.
MacRae and Mark MacIver, who is 17 next week, and 16-year-old Iain
MacAulay, of Eagleton Lower Bayble Point, Lewis, admitted a number of
charges involving an air pistol at Stornoway's Nicolson Institute, on
Springfield Road, and at Seaforth Road on November 8 last year.
MacRae also admitted breaching a bail order.
Lord Cameron sentenced Kenneth MacIver to 18-months' detention in a
young offenders' institution. MacRae was given three months, as was Iain
MacAulay.
Mark MacIver, who was 15 at the time of the offences, had sentence
deferred for one year for good behaviour.
Mr Clancey said the stabbing offence was the most serious of all the
charges.
He said the teenager had been with a girl and was walking through the
car park at Cearn Easaidh in Stornoway making his way home at 11pm when
he was confronted by Kenneth MacIver, Mark MacIver and MacRae.
Mr Clancey said the teenager was first approached by MacRae and Mark
MacIver, who punched him to the ground. ''What followed was the stabbing
by Kenneth MacIver.
''He stabbed him once on the left side of his chest.''
Mr Clancey said that after the attack the boy made his way home. His
parents took him to the Western Isles Hospital where he was operated
upon for a punctured lung. He remained in hospital until December 3.
Kenneth MacIver's agent said the funeral of his client's grandmother
had taken place earlier in the day.
He said the teenager was standing with friends as the funeral
procession was taking place. ''They were shouting, laughing and
whistling. This upset my client and other members of the funeral
cortege.''
MacAulay also admitted three assaults on two pupils at the Nicolson
Institute on Seaforth Road using a knife and air pistol.
Mark MacIver also pled guilty to assaulting a girl pupil with the air
pistol.

LAST TRAIN TO MEMPHIS: The Rise of Elvis Presley, Peter Guralnick,
Abacus, #9.99.
* SINCE his death in 1977, at his nadir of critical and public
interest, the cultural rehabilitation of Elvis Presley has taken place
at the cost of a certain dehumanisation. Seized on as icon, myth,
signifier, and symbol, the man and the musician often seem to be absent
in a more than literal way. This injustice is redressed by Peter
Guralnick's awesomely researched account of Elvis's first 23 years, from
his white-trash birth in Mississippi to his Army call-up. Refreshingly
free of windy interpretation and cod psychology, Guralnick's tight focus
on recorded facts and first-hand memories creates, by sheer force of
detail, a lively portrait of the Hillbilly Cat.
SCOTT FITZGERALD: A Biography, Jeffrey Meyers, Papermac, #12.00.
* SO archetypally does F Scott Fitzgerald's life cleave to the classic
parabola of the doomed artist, the beautiful loser, that it would be
almost impossible to write a biography of him that was less than
readable. Jeffrey Meyers's book, however, goes beyond the basics of
booze, self-loathing, and picturesque Jazz Age background to create a
truly human picture. Fitzgerald at last has the biography he deserves.
THE METROPOLITAN CRITIC: Non-Fiction 1968-1973, Clive James, Picador,
#6.99.
* ONLY Clive James could re-release a 20-year-old collection of
critical essays and journalism and subtitle it Re-Issued With An
Auto-Critique. Each piece is suffixed with a short or long alibi, or
more often a justification, explaining why and how the Kogarah Kid had
been right or wrong at the time. The effect is of bombastic
self-deprecation, a tune called Humility scored for brass and drums. The
matter is a mess of postgraduate cleverness, humbly conventional in its
judgments and painfully hip in its expression. One thing that makes it
readable, however, is the cockroach-in-amber way it preserves the
idiocies of its time.
THE LIVES OF THE GREAT SONGS, Tim De Lisle, Penguin, #6.99.
* BEGINNING as a series of essays in a national Sunday newspaper --
fan testaments to the music that held the writers' lives in a vice --
this collection of meditations on 40 of the songs that make you break
down and cry is a blindingly nostalgic tribute to the potency of cheap
music from Irving Berlin and Cole Porter to Nirvana via Tamla Motown and
The Beatles. Somewhere here most people will meet a kindred spirit who
loves your favourite song as much as you do.
DAVE BARRY IS NOT MAKING THIS UP and DAVE BARRY DOES JAPAN, Dave
Barry, Pan, #5.99 and #4.99.
* SUBJECTED at birth to an operation that removes the irony glands,
Americans have a different sense of humour from us and consequently a
different kind of humorist. Dave Barry, staff funnyman on the Miami
Herald and syndicated everywhere, is an easy-going comedian whose humane
and commonsensical approach passes for seriously whacky in the States
but to our eyes looks straight enough to use as a plumb-line. These two
books, a selection of his newspaper columns and a mildly satirical
travelogue, represent an intelligent humour that we just don't have
here: good-natured, democratic, and friendly. Shame it isn't all that
funny.

FINGERS intertwined, face carved from stone, boxer Drew Docherty
squared up to confront his fears and emotions yesterday when he spoke
publicly for the first time about the death of his ring rival, James
Murray.
Looking down at his fists clenched on the table, he announced: ''I
have decided that I will fight on.''
In a quiet voice the Condorrat fighter said that before considering
even training, he would undergo special counselling.
Chillingly, he nodded. Yes, he was aware that the crumpled figure,
lying fatally injured in the corner of that ring at Glasgow's
Hospitality Inn, could equally easily have been him.
Anguish etched on his features, he choked: ''Jimmy . . . '' paused,
shook his head, '' . . . the last round -- it could have gone either
way.''
Since their fateful Friday 13th encounter, after which Murray
underwent brain surgery but never regained consciousness, 29-year-old
Docherty had agonised over his own future during a spell in Cyprus with
his fiancee, Caroline, and daughter, Rachel. The decision, however, was
his alone. ''It was left entirely to me. She knows -- it's my job.''
Flanked by manager Tommy Gilmour, whose hand protectively clasped his
fighter's left wrist when media interrogation plucked at too-raw nerves,
Docherty confirmed that he had reached his decision only thanks to the
support of his own family and of Murray's parents, Kenneth and Margaret,
who were contacted yesterday before he went public with his intentions.
''If it was me, my own mother and father would not have held it
against Jim Murray,'' said Docherty.
Though talks with his younger brother, Wilson, also a champion
fighter, helped make up his mind, it was the sympathy and understanding
of Kenneth Murray, the dead man's father, which carried the greatest
impact.
''I found it incredible that he was able to say, after such a blow,
that he wanted me to continue my career, and also that boxing should not
be banned,'' Docherty revealed.
However, he will receive bereavement counselling before restarting
training, which, says Gilmour, may yet be another three or four weeks.
''You don't know what is in your mind,'' confessed Docherty. ''Maybe if
you hurt a guy with a punch, you may not want to hit him again. But you
can't be like that if you're a boxer.''
Tactlessly, he was asked if he had suffered nightmares. One must sleep
to have a nightmare. Docherty replied: ''The first three days I could
not get a sleep at all, and I still wake up. I don't want to forget
James Murray, but I just want to forget that night.
''While I was away on holiday, I could sometimes put it out of my
mind, but not back here in Glasgow.''
Though nobody he has met blames Docherty, he explained: ''I have been
in the house, because any time I showed my face, people would mention
the fight. They would not mean any harm, and they were asking after me.
But it kept coming up, so I was virtually a recluse.''
Docherty hopes to meet London's Johnny Armour for the European title,
possibly in February, and make a further attempt at the world crown. But
all future contests will be dedicated to 25-year-old James Murray,
pronounced dead in a Glasgow neurosurgery unit two days after their
British bantamweight title fight.
''If I go on to better things, it will be in Jimmy's memory,'' said
Docherty.
It was also announced yesterday that Murray is to have a more tangible
memorial. A fund has been launched for a statue, in full boxing regalia,
to be erected at the cross in Newmains, Lanarkshire, Murray's home town.

Julian Arguelles, Home Truth (Babel)
* Every bit as wonderful as we had every right to expect, the album
that spawned the music that spawned the recipient of the Outstanding
Performance award at this year's Glasgow Interantional Jazz Festival is
world class stuff. The chap in question is guitarist Mike Walker and
while he certainly shines here, so does the leader and an ace rhythm
section of drummer Martin France and bassist Steve Swallow. Arguelles
himself impresses as much for his writing as for the superb playing we
already knew about. And who can resist a title like A Month In Tunisia?
Beat It Up, The Kaisers (Imperial)
* The studied period perfection of George Miller's Kaisers sits
somewhat uneasily on CD. ''See Inlay for details'' the disc advises, but
you'll search in vain among the pictures of 60s amps and vehicles for
credits. But rest assured it is the genuine classic Leave My Kitten
Alone and the kitsch The Hippy Hippy Shake that are featured.
Inappropriate or not, more folk will be converted by this release than
bought the EPs on which some of the tracks were originally brought out.

A BAN on homosexuals serving in the armed forces was upheld yesterday
by the Court of Appeal.
The three sacked Servicemen and one Servicewoman, who brought the
case, have now vowed to continue their fight in the European Court of
Human Rights.
In the historic test case, three judges ruled that the Ministry of
Defence's automatic bar on gays, said to be necessary to maintain the
morale and efficiency of the fighting forces, was neither irrational nor
unlawful.
The judges rejected accusations by the four who were dismissed that
the ban, which continues to be maintained by Defence Secretary Michael
Portillo, was ''absurd, outrageous, perverse and impossible to
justify''.
Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames welcomed the ruling but pledged
that the current review of the ban would continue and the results
presented to the Commons Select Committee on armed forces discipline
early next year.
One of the four, Mr Duncan Lustig-Prean, who had been a
lieutenant-commander in the Royal Navy, said: ''What I find a shame is
that our admirals and generals continue to dance a hornpipe of
homophobia. Discharges continue and lives are being destroyed.
''It's about time Michael Portillo ordered the generals and admirals
to dance to a different tune and act to end their administrative
impotence.''
He said he was not surprised by the judgment, but took great heart in
what the judges had to say and added it was only a matter of time before
the ban was overturned by Parliament or in Europe.
Mr Lustig-Prean, who is from London, has fought the case with Ms
Jeanette Smith, 28, an ex-RAF nurse from Edinburgh; Mr Graeme Grady, 32,
an ex-RAF sergeant from London; and Mr John Beckett, 25, a former navy
weapons engineer from Sheffield.
The appeal judges refused the four leave to appeal to the House of
Lords.
Lord Justice Thorpe, sitting with Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the
Rolls, and Lord Justice Henry, said: ''Although I am of the opinion that
the current policy is ripe for review and for consideration of its
replacement by a strict conduct code, I conclude that the appellants'
attack on the Secretary of State's rationality falls a long way short of
success.''
After the judgment, Mr David Pannick, QC, appearing for three of the
four, said if the Law Lords would not hear the case, they would be off
to the European Court on Human Rights in Strasbourg ''on the first
available plane''.
During the appeal hearing last month, lawyers for the applicants
argued the blanket policy was impossible to justify.
Mr Pannick said the ban breached equal treatment directives from the
EU and Britain's obligations under the European Convention on Human
Rights.
It was ''absurd'' to suggest the ban was necessary to ensure sound
discipline in the armed forces.
Such discipline was displayed in the police, in the fire service and
in the armies of other Nato and Commonwealth countries, none of which
banned homosexuals as a matter of policy.
However, Mr Stephen Richards, representing Mr Portillo, said the ban
was based on a rational judgment ''born of experience''. It continued to
be justified because of the risk homosexuals posed to the morale and
effectiveness of the armed forces.

<HEADLINE>New designer drinks attracting very young, warns counsellor</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975552795</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of drinks company bosses are being forced to produce sweeter
and more potent alcoholic drinks for teenage drinkers because designer
drugs are putting them out of business, according to a schools alcohol
counsellor.
It means school children as young as 10 or 12 are getting hooked, Mr
Jim Smith, said yesterday.
Speaking at a Scottish Council on Alcohol conference in Glasgow, he
said youngsters attending raves were opting for designer drugs like
ecstasy rather than alcohol.
This, he said, was encouraging drinks companies to market gimmicky
alcoholic drinks to claw back that sector of the youth market.
The most popular are vodka jellies, MD 20/20, and ''test tube''
cocktails, he said.
''Most of us were reared on sweet drinks like Coca-Cola and Irn Bru
and the first time we tasted alcohol we thought it was awful.
''But drinks companies have changed that, making alcohol sweeter,
nicer to look at and far more palatable. Trouble is it's younger
children that are buying the drinks.''
Drinks which attract school-age drinkers are Shock Cider -- the bottle
comes in the shape of a light bulb and Shooters -- tequilla in a
bullet-shaped bottle.
A particular favourite is Kiwi Lemon Ravers -- fruit-flavoured lime
with vodka and kiwi lemon. It comes in a luminous green bottle and has
an alcohol content of 13.5%.
''Children start at 12 years old on these drinks and are hooked on
alcohol by the age of 16. Drinks manufacturers get through the moral
loopholes by saying they are aimed at 18 to 25 year olds,'' said Mr
Smith.
''But I go into schools and it's the primary kids who tell me about
new drinks on the market.''

SIX times world snooker champion, Steve Davis, is a chess nut. Like
many who simply play for fun, he enjoys playing with family, friends and
computers. Recently his computers have been getting too much the better
of him, so he sought to improve his game by taking lessons. The result
is a jump in his playing strength and a book, Stevie Davis Plays Chess
(#9.99 Batsford), by Steve himself and his grandmaster teacher David
Norwood.
I must say the book seems to me to be a success. There is a massive
market of Steve Davises out there who will, I am certain, get a lot of
information, inspiration and sheer enjoyment from reading its pages.
Most chess books cater mainly for the serious player or the pure
beginner. This book aims for the many more hobbyists in the middle, who
have already been introduced to the game and can play a bit, but who
have rarely if ever stepped into a chess club.
Norwood has a nice touch with his student. He helps him understand how
to think about chess without deluging him with mainly useless
variations. This is not only the key to playing better chess, but also
to enjoying the game. His crash course takes Steve through the openings,
endgames, planning and positional play, tactics and playing against
computers. Then we follow Steve in his first visit to a chess club and
his first outing in a tournament.
Steve thoroughly enjoyed the experience. He has even paid a
subscription in advance to his local Brentwood chess club. His many
games and comments in the book will readily strike a chord with all
those who play chess principally for social enjoyment. Here is one of
his wins in his first tournament. Neither side is a budding world chess
champion, but if you think you play chess at this sort of standards,
Steve's book may be a tonic for you.

A TEENAGER was in hospital last night after being wounded by a
point-blank blast from a gun pushed through a letterbox.
Kevin McNulty, 19, suffered chest wounds and collapsed in front of his
mother in the hallway of her home in High Blantyre.
Seconds before the shooting, Mr McNulty and his brother, Ryan, 17, had
formed a human shield at the front door of the mother's house in the
town's Calderwood Drive to stop three men forcing their way into the
house.
Last night the victim was fighting for his life at Hairmyres Hospital
while detectives pursued ''a definite line of inquiry''.
Earlier a brick and a baton were hurled through Mrs McNulty's front
windows.
Ryan McNulty claimed the shooting was a result of a long-running feud
between a group of men and his brother.
He said that earlier on Thursday night, as he was waiting for a lift
to work on Main Street, High Blantyre, he was chased by a group of men
armed with wooden batons. They had come out of a local pub.
He ran home to Calderwood Drive, then to the house in Waverley Terrace
where his brother lives with his grandfather.
Mr McNulty said: ''When Kevin and I got back to my mum's house the
front window had been smashed.
''About 12.30am on Friday we were sitting upstairs and heard a bang. I
thought it was another window going. I heard my mother screaming.
''Me and my brother rushed down to be with mum. Three men were beating
in the front door.
''Kevin and I tried to hold the door shut. The next moment there was a
bang. My brother fell against the stairs.
''They had put the gun through the letter box and fired. At first I
didn't realise Kevin had been shot in the chest.
''He screamed at me, 'I've been shot.' I shouted on mum to call an
ambulance and I ran upstairs to get a towel to stop the bleeding.
''Kevin was gasping for breath.''
Mrs. McNulty spent yesterday at her son's bedside at Hairmyres, where
doctors said he remained seriously ill.

Washington
THE Lockerbie memorial stands among a grove of oaks in Arlington
cemetery where the red and brown leaves were falling and scattering
across the ground, as it was dedicated under a steady rain yesterday.
It is a circular tower of red sandstone, made up of one block for each
of the 270 people killed on PanAm flight 103 or on the ground. All those
names were read out at the ceremony, one after another, by a series of
the victims' relatives.
President Clinton, members of the Cabinet, members of Congress and
other dignitaries joined a crowd of around 2000 people carrying flowers
that they put on the memorial when the ceremony was over. Most of them
were members of the families of the dead.
Father Pat Keegans, of Lockerbie, dedicated the memorial. His house,
and he himself, survived when fragments of the plane fell upon his
neighbourhood, destroying houses on either side of his. ''The real
memorial to those who died,'' he said, ''is not made of stone. It is we,
and our duty to go on living and loving.
''Our memorial to them is to live our lives joyfully, for that is the
way they would wish us to live.''
MrGeorge Williams, whose 24-year old son was killed, spoke for the
bereaved. He spoke warmly of the people of Lockerbie and of Scotland in
general, for the help and comfort they gave him and other families who
went there after the disaster.
He also denounced Libya with undiminished bitterness, and was
applauded when he said: ''Libya is a pirate state and we ask Congress to
work with the President to enforce a naval oil blockade against Libya if
it cannot be done through the UN.''
Sir Hector Monro, Conservative MP for Dumfries, and thus for
Lockerbie, led the large Scottish delegation. He spoke with emotion of
the terrible night of the crash, and of the four memorials that have
been placed in Lockerbie itself. He also spoke of the great friendship
that has sprung up between the village and the United States.
The memorial, described as a cairn though it is built of dressed
stone, was a gift from Scotland to the United States. It was paid for by
contributions from many people and institutions, including many of the
families.
The St Andrew's Society of Washington provided a pipe band and its
members, in kilts, helped manage the affair. After the concluding
prayers, by Fr Keegans, two ministers from Lockerbie and a rabbi, a
piper played the Flowers of the Forest.

IT was the measured tone of the gravelly Gloucestershire voice that
made it all the more chilling.
It was so matter-of-fact. Frederick West could have been chatting
about a change in the weather and not the killing of his 16-year-old
daughter Heather, and the dismemberment of her body.
In the dock, Mrs Rosemary West bowed her head and wept. Her large
oblong glasses slipped down her nose. In the lapel of her black jacket
was a Remembrance Day poppy.
At the beginning of the proceedings yesterday, she was passive as
usual. However, as the voice of her dead husband boomed around the
court, tears welled. He was, in effect, giving evidence in her defence
from beyond the grave.
With the first mention of Heather, whom she is accused of murdering,
Mrs West raised a white handkerchief to her nose. Within minutes, the
tears began to flow.
As Fred told how he cut up and buried Heather, Mrs West was holding
her head so low in the dock she had all but disappeared. The female
prison officers sitting on either side of her were impassive and looked
straight ahead.
Mrs West stopped crying and occasionally bobbed up to sip water from a
white plastic cup.
''No, no, no, Rose had nothing to do with any of it,'' was the message
Fred was delivering from the grave but Mrs West was pale as police
officers told the court that her late husband had constantly lied
throughout all of these interviews.
At the end of the day's proceedings, Mrs West was half-hearted as she
made her customary bow towards the judge. She seemed more than happy to
return to her cell.

Do You Like My Tight Sweater, Moloko (Echo)
* You shouldn't merely like Moloko's loose and ironic grooves, you
should love them to bits. Imagine the unravelling lyrics of Beck and MC
900Ft Jesus. Imagine the sloppily-propulsive beats of Massive Attack and
Black Grape. Imagine the loping loops of Portishead. Imagine all this
underpinned by the surreal funkateering of George Clinton . . . and you
still won't have gained the impact of Moloko's full-freakwency
sculptures in hip-trip sound. Moloko are Mark Brydon and Roisin Murphy.
Note their names and mark my words: they could prove to be a whole lot
more than the Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox of the dance-generation.
Inner City Blues, various (Motown)
* When I die, think only this of me: ''The best tribute we could each
pay him would be to go out and buy extra Partick Thistle season-tickets,
thus funding a Firhill resurrection.'' That would be the very dab, that
would. I certainly wouldn't thank you for assembling a superstar cast to
read my collected Seal, Deacon Blue, and Genesis reviews. And neither
would Marvin Gaye appreciate Bono being overly-reverent with Marvin's
Save The Children if he was still around to hear it. Ditto most of the
other celebs attempting to pay homage to the King of Sweet Soul's
immortal back-catalogue. Haud me back from the clueless Madonna, seeking
hipness-by-association with Massive Attack, on a bloodless I Want You.
Lisa Stansfield and Boyz II Men? Eek, no! Thumbs up, though, to Stevie
Wonder for a breezy Stubborn Kind Of Fellow; Speech, of Arrested
Development, for re-inventing What's Goin' On; and Sound of Blackness
for a creamy Mercy Mercy Me.
Working Class Hero, various (Hollywood)
* And the tribute albums keep on a-oozin' out of the woodwork. This
one is, of course, for Beatle Johnny Lemondrop, and features such Yankee
post-grunge retro-guitar boogie-boys as the Red Hot Chili Peppers,
Collective Soul, Toad The Wet Sprocket and Blues Traveler. Old goats
Cheap Trick are the only ones to emerge with pass-marks, however, for a
re-working of Cold Turkey which is both crisp and brooding.

Transatlantic Airs, Michael Hashim (33 Records)
* Impressive calling card from an imminent visitor to Scotland.
Bronx-based Hashim is equally fluent and full of ideas and tonal
variations on soprano and alto saxophones, and writes a good tune. The
mood here varies from the tender Love Song from Threepenny Opera to the
down-home-and-dirty Corn Squeezin's to a quicksilver Tickle Toe, with
the rhythm section of Dave Newton (piano), Dave Green (bass) and Clark
Tracey (drums) matching all the way.
Ao-Tea-Roa, Rua (Greentrax)
* From Auckland via Cockenzie, Rua present a veritable cornucopia of
Celtic connections from keening slow airs and smouldering ballads to
jazz-folk, country-folk, folk-rock and folk-raucous, with the
combination of controlled (just) electric guitar and windswept
Northumbrian pipes a particular winner. They push their luck following a
set of tunes called Bannd (sic)on the Run with a highly individual and
percussive Eleanor Rigby, but on this live recording Rua are on a roll
and might have got away with murder.

BUILDER Fred West described how he killed his teenaged daughter,
Heather, when she said she wanted to leave home, in the first of the
four tapes played at the trial yesterday.
West, speaking quickly on the 38-minute recording made on February 25,
1994, at Gloucester Central police station, said: ''What happened was
Heather was going to leave home the day before and we stopped her.'' He
had asked her to stay the night to ''talk it over''.
He went on: ''We talked it over for most of the night. Heather went
down to bed because she slept with Mae and Stephen in the same room.
Heather cried all night because she wanted to leave home.
''Rose said: 'Let her go. I will go out and draw money out -- #600 --
and give her, and let her go'.
''I said: 'All right, then'. Rosemary went to get the money. I said:
'Don't hurry back, and give me a chance to talk to Heather'.''
Later, Fred West told the detective that Heather was standing in the
hallway, where they then kept the washing machine.
''She's standing there with her hands on her hips like this, against
the washing machine -- you know, the big lady business.''
Heather, he said, had told him: ''If you don't f...ing let me go, I
will give all the kids acid and they will all jump off the church roof
and be dead.''
Fred West said he knew Heather had given acid to his son, Paul, who
had then jumped off the church roof.
''I lunged at her and grabbed her round the throat, like that. I held
her for a bit, how long for I don't remember. I can just remember
lunging for her throat and the next minute she has gone blue.
''I put her on the floor. I blew air into her mouth and then I pumped
air into her chest, but she just kept going bluer. At this stage, I
didn't know what to do. Rose was due back and anyone else could walk in.
I tried to get her to breathe again.
''I tried to put her in a dustbin. I put her back on the living room
floor and tried to breathe into her mouth again. But then she started to
go cold, and by then she had already wet the floor. I thought 'What the
hell's gone wrong. I never intended this'.''
Fred West said he would have smacked his daughter ''across the face''
but he was ''nervous'' about doing that because some years earlier
Rosemary had a dislocated jaw after he slapped her.
He considered putting Heather's body ''in the Wendy house'' but it was
too big.
He tried to put his daughter into a dustbin, he said, adding: ''At
that time, we used to have this big ice saw for cutting ice blocks and I
cut her legs off with that.''
He was then able to put the body into the bin, which he rolled down to
the bottom of the garden and placed behind the children's Wendy House.
He collected Heather's possessions and took them to an area nearby
where people disposed of rubbish, where he ''stacked'' her things,
knowing it was bin day and confident they would be removed.
''Then Rose came back -- it must have been an hour or more later. She
said: 'Didn't you persuade Heather to stay?' I said no, she decided to
go.''
Heather's body stayed in the dustbin all that day, Fred West said.
That night, he said: ''I sent Rose out with a coloured bloke that night,
to stay with him that night.''
He said he went to the foot of the garden where a wooden fence hid him
from view. ''I dug a hole and buried her behind the fence,'' he said.
He said it stayed that way for around a couple of months. He recalled
there was a lot of cold and wet weather at that time and nobody went
down to the bottom of the garden.
Shown a number of photographs of the garden and asked ''where is
Heather now'', Fred West began to give some detail of where the Wendy
House had stood, saying it was close to a barbecue.
The officers noticed he had some difficulty in viewing the photographs
and volunteered to get his spectacles for him.
Fred West then began to detail where he said he buried the body. He
gave the detectives details of the layout of the back garden and where
they could find Heather's grave.
Asked what police would find, Fred West said Heather would be in three
pieces -- ''two legs, head and body''.
''Clothing?'' -- ''No''.
''Material. Covering?'' -- ''No, nothing,'' said Fred West quietly.
Pressed further, Fred West said he put the main part of Heather's body
in the middle of the hole, with her legs at the side, and the head in
front. He had covered it with earth topped by two two-foot slabs.
Asked who else knew about Heather, Fred West said firmly: ''Nobody at
all. That's something I have had to live with. It's not easy, I'll tell
you.''
He added: ''Rose knew nothing about it at all.''
Detective Constable Hazel Savage told Fred West that there were now an
awful lot of questions they would have to ask him to resolve the matter
quickly.
He replied: ''Over the past eight years there has been quite a few
times I have actually decided I will come down and see you personally
and do something about it, but then I backed off for some unknown
reason.''
He referred to the ''patio business'' and said he did not know where
it had come from.
But he thought that Anna might have started it off, saying that
Heather was under the patio. He thought she had mentioned it in a
statement in connection with earlier proceedings.
Fred West maintained that his daughters Mae and Anna did not know
about the patio statement. He added: ''All I am worried about is Rose. I
am not going to get any backing from Rose at all. Once Rose finds out
about this, I am finished.''
The jurors then began to hear the second interview -- 44 minutes long
-- which was conducted on the evening of March 4.
Fred West's lawyer, Mr Howard Ogden, said his client had prepared
drawings of the basement at 25 Cromwell Street. There were now matters
which Fred West wished to admit regarding the deaths of various women.
Detective Constable Savage asked Fred West how many bodies there were
in Cromwell Street.
Mr Ogden said: ''I think we are talking of an approximation.''
Fred West began to describe the basement area of 25 Cromwell Street.
The court heard his recorded voice detail where bodies could be found
beneath 25 Cromwell Street, as they referred to a sketch plan during the
recorded interview.
The builder agreed it would not be difficult for police to reach the
remains of Lynda Gough, who, he said, was buried in what had been a
car-repair pit beneath a garage now converted into a bathroom.
There were no other bodies beneath the ground floor of the house, he
said.
''The reason was because they would have been too close to Rose,'' he
told police.
Other bodies were under the cellar, he said, explaining how he had
altered the access to the cellar over the years.
The first spot beneath the cellar, where he indicated that a body
would be found, had been used for ''a girl from Newent'', he said.
But when detectives asked if this was a girl they had mentioned to him
before, he said this was a different one, and the girl they had
mentioned was ''safe''.
Fred West went on: ''All these girls I had affairs with and that's why
they ended up this way -- because they threatened to tell Rose.''
Asked how many of the girls were pregnant, he said he did not know.
After being told that the girls' bodies were being numbered, he said:
''Body one is right in the fireplace of the basement. As you go down the
stairs there's a fireplace straight in front of you.''
He said of the victim: ''She and I had an affair. I think she was
Dutch or something. She was having a holiday over here, and then she
threatened to tell Rose.
''Every one of them did exactly the same thing -- 'I love you, I'm
pregnant, I'm going to tell Rose and I want you to live with me'. That
was the problem,'' Fred West went on.
DC Savage asked: ''What was the very first body?''
Fred West, quietly: ''That was Rena.'' (His first wife, Catherine
Costello).
Rena had threatened Rosemary and had gone round to 25 Midland Road to
collect their daughter, Charmaine, Fred West said. He took Rena out to a
pub and got her ''absolutely paralytic''. Charmaine was in the back of
the car, asleep.
West drove them out to Kempley, near his former home on the
Gloucester-Herefordshire border, strangled Rena, and buried her there.
''I strangled Rena, cut her up and buried her,'' Fred West told the
officers. He returned to the car and, on seeing Charmaine, thought to
himself ''What am I going to do now?''
Fred West added: ''Charmaine must have been about six or seven, little
for her age. I strangled her while she was sleeping. No way I would have
touched her in any way.''
He wrapped the dead child up and drove her back to 25 Midland Road,
where he hid her in a basement area. Later, he buried her at the house.
When he had to return to the house in later years to build an
extension for the owner, he put the remains even further down in the
footings ''to make sure of it''.
West said they were sitting near a bus stop when Lucy Partington
started to talk about him meeting her parents. She also spoke about
having his home telephone number.
West said he believed she lived near Bishops Cleeve but he had never
gone there. They never met at her place, always in the park. He claimed
his relationship had been going on for about three months.
An interviewer suggested West thought it was getting serious. He
replied: ''I reminded her, I have told you no messing with my home or
you are in deep trouble, kid, or hen or chick or something. I used to
call them that. I still had the Scottish thing then.''
He claimed the girl ''got nasty'' and he just grabbed her by the
throat. It was then early in the morning and he drove back to Gloucester
in his green A35 van. He told how he had a ramp on the pavement was able
to drive the van to the side of the house.
He cut the engine and the lights as he ''cruised'' down to the back.
At that time, the basement was reached by a ''hole'' and by a flight of
steps.
He then indicated to the officers where in the basement he believed
the body was buried.
And, looking at a plan, he told them that ''Rose was asleep'' above
numbers 5 and 6.
DC Savage asked him: ''Are you responsible for killing all these
people, Fred?''
West: ''Yes.''
DC Savage: ''Can you tell me whether the way you killed them is
different?''
West: ''No, all exactly the same, strangled and then cut up.''
DC Savage: ''Are you responsible for burying them?''
West: ''Yes.''
Fred West maintained that all the bodies were dismembered as far as he
could recall and nobody else was involved.
Fred West said the girls who died were aged 18 to 20, apart from
Charmaine.
Asked if he had known a girl called Lucy Partington -- one of the
alleged murder victims -- he replied simply: ''Yes, she's there.''
He went on: ''I met her in Pittville Park one day when I was with the
kids. It was all secret, hush-hush, because she had a boyfriend besides
that.''
Pressed for more information, he said ''It was an awful long time
ago.''
When DC Savage asked why he could not remember Lucy Partington, when
he remembered seeing her (DC Savage) as a policewoman years before, Fred
West said: ''When I first met you, you had to be the beautifulest woman
in Gloucestershire.''
Asked how Lucy Partington ''came to meet her end'', he said he had
taken her back to a bus stop near the park in Cheltenham.
He went on: ''What she had done, she had found our phone number. It
was when we had the phone put in. She wanted to give her boyfriend up
and come to live with me and all this rubbish. We had a row, the same as
Shirley and me had rowed over it. It was always made clear to these
girls that there wasn't an affair. It was just purely sex, end of
story.''
The jury then heard a third tape, made on March 5, 1994, in which Fred
West was further questioned about bodies in the basement. He told
detectives he now thought two of the girls were from the Worcester area,
and said he was earlier mixed up about whether another victim was Dutch
or German.
The detectives concentrated their questions on the second Worcester
girl mentioned by the builder -- body number four on their list at that
stage of the interview.
Fred West said he had picked the girl up while out in his lorry near
Worcester, saying he believed she was a prostitute.
''I was driving along when the next minute she was messing about with
me. I stopped and that was it. We made love and that was it.''
They were almost into Tewkesbury when the girl demanded ''a fiver or
something''. ''She said: 'Don't forget to pay me','' he said.
He refused to pay and the girl told him that he could either pay up or
she would report him for rape.
''I stopped the lorry. I slammed her up against the window and she
just dropped. I strangled her, or put my hands around her neck. She just
slipped down to the bottom of the seat in the lorry. I just went home.''
He ''could not be 100% sure'' if he cut the girl up before burying her
in the cellar.
He was asked: ''Did you take their clothes off? Were they naked when
you buried them, or not?''
There was a long silence and he was reminded that he had seemed to
suggest the day before that his daughter Charmaine was the only victim
who was not mutilated.
Fred West said: ''She was young, she was seven, she was pure.''
West then referred to the ''Dutch girl''. He told detectives: ''It was
exactly the same thing, coming out of Worcester one night I picked her
up.
''I gave her a lift along and the same thing happened. She started
messing about. On the lorry you get a lot of girls like that.''
Fred West then had a discussion with the officers about a German girl
he was involved with but who had since ''gone''.
He then referred to another girl in the basement who, he claimed, he
had also picked up in Worcester.
''The next minute she is sitting on the engine, and the next minute
she has got my flies undone and she is messing about.''
He pulled into a layby and they twice made love. She then said ''That
will be #10,'' he claimed.
He said he told her he did not carry money and would not pay for a
prostitute anyway, and then told her to ''get lost''.
''And then she said: 'You are the sort of person that goes with
slags', or something to that effect. I lost the head with her. Whenever
she said that I thought of Rose and Rose is no slag so far as I was
concerned. I went for her and the same thing happened with her.''
He indicated that the ''same thing'' had happened to three of the
girls in his basement plan.
In a fourth and final tape lasting 45 minutes, a police officer
referred to the attack on Mrs Caroline Owens and Fred West agreed he had
picked her up as it was an opportunity to get Rose involved in lesbian
affairs.
He said: ''I had no intention of going too far with Rose that night.
Anyway, it was just to try her on lesbianism and see how she would react
to it. That's all it went, it really went wrong after that. After that
Rose was not involved in anything.
''But Rose did not want to know about it. Never mind what the girl
said, Rose did not want to know.''
West maintained Rose never had anything to do with bondage. He added:
''We tried it in later life but no way did Rose have anything to do with
it.
''It was just a thing that I was trying out with Rose, this bondage
thing with this girl. But once Rose touched her and she screamed, then
that was Rose finished. Rose just said: 'Drop her home,'.
''I said: 'I can't. Not just like that.' I couldn't just take her and
drop her at the door like that.''
He was questioned about the allegations Mrs Owens had made to police
that after the attack in the car she was taken to 25 Cromwell Street and
subjected to an overnight sexual ordeal, which included oral sex and
rape. She had told them that for some of the time she had been gagged
and bound with tape.
Asked about the rape, he said Mrs Owens had been just lying there and
had not tried to stop him. Asked by a police officer if she had just
''laid there and thought of England'', he said: ''I don't know what she
did but she just lay there, she wasn't tied up then.''
He said Rose was not there at the time. ''Rose backed out completely
of it,'' he said.
Rose had gone out in the morning to get breakfast for Caroline Owens,
he said. It was then that he had sex with her. Asked again if she had
agreed, West said: ''Well she didn't do a lot about it. She wasn't taped
up then. She could have screamed, the whole house would have heard.''
He added: ''Rose looked after her and felt sorry towards her.'' The
claim that his wife had oral sex with their victim was rubbish, he said.
Asked why Mrs Owens should have made up such a claim when she clearly
felt embarrassed talking to police about it, West said: ''Rose never
touched her sexually apart from her hand up her skirt. That's all Rose
did to her.''
DC Savage then showed him a silver buckle ring and West said he
recognised it as one of a pair that came from Scotland. He believed his
son, Stephen, had the other one.
West told the officers that Rena Costello had bought him a silver ring
in Glasgow's Barrowland as that was a place where jewellery could be
bought cheaply.
Fred West was reminded that people had made statements about being
abused by Rose, using vibrators, at his house.
West replied: ''No, that was voluntary.'' He said there were two girls
involved on a couple of occasions. The officer suggested that there was
no doubt it appeared that Rose was ''very heavy'' into lesbian
behaviour.
West retorted: ''Only when I persuaded her and if I was there with
her. These girls will always tell you I was actually there with her, and
they were lesbians anyway.''
Detective Constable Darren Law told the jury that police recorded 145
tape recorded interviews with Fred West with a total playing time of
more than 110 hours.
He had been present during 80 interviews but was aware of what West
was saying in others. The officer said it was correct that at no time in
any of the interviews did Fred West implicate Mrs West in any of the
killings.
DC Law said Fred West gave different versions for each of the victims
found at Cromwell Street. He said Fred West told ''lie after lie'' when
the detective was able to demonstrate he was not telling the truth. In
the main, Fred West's response to accusations of lying was to change his
story, he said.
DC Law read out a transcript of an interview with Fred West. In it,
West told officers how he had strangled Shirley Robinson in the hallway
of 25 Cromwell Street. He claimed that Shirley had been supplying drugs
to Heather to supply to schoolchildren.
West claimed Rose was in hospital having a baby at the time he
strangled Shirley. ''I don't think Rose ever had anything to do with
Shirley,'' he added.
Detective Constable Geoffrey Morgan said West had told him that Lynda
Gough, another alleged victim, was heavily into kinky sex and bondage.
Fred West had given an account of how Lynda Gough had died. He told
the officer the girl had been in the basement where her hands were
secured to a ceiling beam. West had claimed that the girl had wanted her
''massive'' bust tied up. He claimed that the girl was roped to the beam
and was making weird noises.
''She was tied up across this hole and she had a rope around her neck
and her arms,'' he said. West said the girl's arms were underneath the
beam and she was holding herself against it.
''She was just hanging there and she was enjoying every minute of
it,'' he said.
He said he heard a doorbell ringing. He realised he would have to go
up and answer the door because whoever was calling knew he was there.
''When I get back down the flipping rope that was holding her legs was
away. It moved or something. It snapped and she was killed. She was
hanging there, strangled, hanged by the neck into this hole,'' he said.

OUTBREAK (rental, cert 15).
* ANY movie which involves people catching a disease in a movie
theatre -- and not in the back row, neither -- is giving a lot of
hostages to critical fortune. If Couch Potato wanted to be cute about
Outbreak, we could point to the special-effects sequence in a smalltown
cinema where plague germs (made visible) fly from an infected patron's
cough to the mouth and airways of unsuspecting victims 20 rows away, and
make some appropriate cracks about how the general cinema audience
treated this picture as though a dose of Aids came free with every
ticket.
Fortunately, however, we're not feeling quite so mercilessly cute
today. Outbreak may be a very silly and badly written movie -- it's the
kind of picture where characters tell each other things that they both
know already, but the audience needs to be kept informed -- but its the
kind of silly movie that people who love the movies do like.
For a start, it's got Dustin Hoffman in a blissfully unsuitable
action-hero role as a military scientist landed with the job of
containing a virulent and 100% fatal monkey-borne African disease in a
small American town. It's got Donald Sutherland as a military bad-guy
who knows it's all to do with a secret biological-warfare programme, and
who would rather see thousands die than give away the CIA's secrets. Its
got Morgan Freeman as the military good-guy who won't let Sutherland . .
. but let's not give the story away entirely. And it's got a monkey --
or did we mention him already?
At the heel of the hunt, it all adds up to a good old-fashioned
disaster movie, though one free from the sadism that marred thrillers
like Towering Inferno. Also, it's Agin The Government -- and when did
Dustin Hoffman ever star in a film that wasn't? Best of all, after 70
minutes of messing about, we get 30 minutes of high-class action thrills
on land and in the air. Sophisticated it ain't, and you might well find
yourself laughing in the wrong places, but it's jolly good fun for all
that; and for that, these days, Couch Potato is grateful.
FRESH (rental, cert 18).
* CONSCIENTIOUSLY crafted and impeccably PC, screenwriter Boaz Yakim's
first outing as director is an all-black ghetto melodrama that does no
favours for its presumed constituency. Although nominally in the same
vein as black-pride movies like Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing and John
Singleton's Boyz 'n' The Hood, Fresh is finally nothing more than a
blaxploitation thriller that doesn't even thrill.
Here's the story: 12-year-old Fresh (a brilliant debut by Sean Nelson
that he should have saved for a better movie) is a drugs runner and
gofer for two rival death merchants, one of whom (Giancarlo Esposito) is
doing Fresh's big sister wrong. After two of Fresh's friends get wasted
in ghetto gunplay, Fresh avenges them by playing both ends against the
middle and making the bad guys kill each other.
The story might have worked well, if the script and action hadn't been
calculated to rob young Fresh, the nominal hero, of any sympathy we
might have felt for him: so unlovable is he the Ku Klux Klan could just
about use this picture as racist propaganda. Another problem is the way
it wastes the brilliant Samuel L Jackson (Fresh's father) in a handful
of throwaway scenes that only show up the inadequacies of most of the
other players. Let this one slip by.

In a Soulful Mood, Charlie Parker (Music Club)
* Another brilliant value (#5.99 for 26 tracks) selection from Music
Club: Charlie Parker's 1946 and 1947 recording output for the Dial
label. Among the better known tracks (selected by compiler
extraordinaire Roy Carr) are such bebop classics as Night in Tunisia,
Yardbird Suite, and Ornithology -- all three with Miles Davis and tenor
saxophonist Lucky Thompson. Possibly the most interesting numbers,
however, are two which were released against Bird's will: the emotive
Loverman and Gypsy were recorded in July 1946, during a session which
was soon terminated because the drugged-up alto player was losing
control of his body. Definitely worth a listen.

<HEADLINE>Lockerbie anger as the President gives way to Friday Sportscene. Clinton speech cut off by BBC</HEADLINE>

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton promised last night to bring the Lockerbie
bombers to justice, but in the special television programme from
Washington his pledge was not heard when BBC Scotland ended it in favour
of a scheduled sports programme before he delivered his speech.
Angry viewers swamped the BBC switchboard in Glasgow with calls last
night after live satellite coverage of the Lockerbie memorial service
was cut off.
In his speech, Mr Clinton vowed ''never to relax'' efforts to bring
the bombers to justice.
''We continue to press for the extradition of the two Libyan suspects.
We want to maintain and tighten the enforcement of our sanctions and we
want to increase the pressure on Libya,'' he told the victims' families
at Arlington.
He added: ''This cairn reminds us that we must never, never relax our
efforts until the criminals are brought to justice.''
Several viewers telephoned The Herald to express their anger and
disgust at his speech being missed and questioned BBC Scotland's ''sense
of priorities'' describing the switch as ''shameful''.
BBC Reporting Scotland had trailed its live coverage of the dedication
of the memorial to the 270 who died in the 1988 Lockerbie disaster on
several occasions during the week.
There was live coverage of the President's arrival on Reporting
Scotland, but it was abruptly ended at 7pm to accommodate Friday
Sportscene before Mr Clinton delivered his speech.
Lockerbie community councillor Joe Meechan described BBC Scotland's
action as ''diabolical'' and said it was ''very disappointing'' for the
people of the town.
He said: ''BBC Scotland told us all week that they were going to bring
live coverage of the memorial ceremony. I can see no reason why if they
can run late for a football match that they can't run late for something
as significant as this.''
BBC Scotland said it had received about 100 calls of complaints about
the switch.
Mr Tim Luckhurst, editor of news programmes with BBC Scotland, said:
''The President's arrival at Arlington Cemetery came later than
scheduled. Unfortunately at such short notice it was impossible for us
to change our schedule more than we had already changed it. Although we
were able to bring coverage of the President's arrival we very much
regret that we were unable to bring live coverage of his speech.''
In a call to The Herald, Mr George Miller from Kilmarnock accused BBC
Scotland of a ''serious misjudgment'', while Mr William Bell, from
Giffnock, questioned the station's ''sense of priorities''.
Mr William Layhe, from Ayr, said he was shocked and disturbed at the
BBC's action.
He said he had phoned BBC Scotland and was told by a newsroom employee
that ''some people considered football more important''.
BBC Scotland gave brief coverage of Mr Clinton's speech in its 9.30pm
news bulletin last night. A special documentary from Arlington National
Cemetery will also be shown tomorrow.
At the ceremony, some people sobbed under the steady rain.
Mr George Williams, president of a victims' group, who lost a
24-year-old son, said: ''They were blown out of the sky four days before
Christmas in 1988. That day is burned into our psyche as no other day in
our lives.''
There had been a boycott of the service by relatives of several
victims as a protest against what they described as a lack of US resolve
to force Colonel Gaddafi's hand.
They were backed by former US Secretary of State, Mr Lawrence
Eagleburger.
The families had urged the Justice Department to release all of its
evidence against the two Libyans charged with the bombing of PanAm
Flight 103.
Mr Eagleburger said he had great sympathy for the families because of
what he described as the increasingly remote possibility that Gaddafi
would hand over Abdel Basset Ali Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah for
trial.
The two men were charged by Britain and the US four years ago.
The White House provided little hope for a breakthrough soon.
Spokesman Mike McCurry said: ''We continue regular diplomatic contact
with some of our closest allies on ways in which we might even further
tighten that pressure on Libya.''
As for Mr Eagleburger's urging that the Justice Department release all
its evidence against the two Libyans, Mr McCurry said this would have to
wait until the two suspects were brought to trial.

NONE of the obituaries of Sir Kingsley Amis the other week referred to
the role he held as jazz critic of The Observer in the mid-fifties, one
where he did what he was always so good at doing -- cocking a snook at
the Establishment.
This time the men he took on were those who wrote for the major jazz
magazines and also for the Melody Maker, in those gilded days something
of a jazz bible instead of the pop parade it has become.
Amis refused to acknowledge the accepted order of things. He did
recognise the overwhelming majesty of Louis Armstrong, the irreverent
genius of Fats Waller, and the improvisational glories of Coleman
Hawkins.
But while his head told him these were the giants of the music, his
heart led him elsewhere and he took myself and others with him. In one
memorable article, written around the time of the epic British tour by
Eddie Condon and his Barefoot Gang, he declared: Make Mine Chicago
Style.
That was the route chosen by Amis and by former Oxford comrade-in-arms
Philip Larkin, who eventually wrote about jazz for the Daily Telegraph.
They listened to the Muggsy Spanier Ragtimers, the Chicago Rhythm
Kings, and the Condon Commodore sides and admired the free-wheeling
anarchism which seemed to them to enrich the music.
These were the men they idolised and these were the men whose music
they praised in their columns. Amis had little truck with those who
wished to make jazz too respectable, after all it was the music's lack
of respectability which had first attracted him.
When Condon arrived in Britin in early l957 he said in one interview
jazz was no more of an art form than canning peas. Amis responded some
weeks later: ''With this I take leave to disagree, but the right to say
it must be defended to the death at a time when solemnity, artiness and
academicism are threatening jazz's good name.''
He went on to mock the absurdity of those critics who wished to call
Dizzy Gillespie, John Gillespie, in ''the interest of general decorum''.
I have carried that cutting around with me for the best part of forty
years and parts of it I can recite because Amis, for me, struck a chord
which was different from the recommended listening guides offered by the
established critics.
His message was fairly simple and it was that you should listen to
what you enjoy most rather than what people say you must listen to.
To the end of his life I remain convinced that Amis, away from the
Garrick Club and the curmudgeonly public persona he adopted there, was
still listening to these men and still extolling the virtues of The
Rhythmakers with those Billy Banks vocals and the front line partnership
of Russell and Red Allen.
He helped me discover these sides and it is to the discredit of the
record companies they have not so far appeared on CD. Not that I could
see Amis ever accepting the CD; records were his thing and somewhere now
in whatever artistic Valhalla he occupies he will be playing them and he
and Eddie Condon will not be canning peas, they will be sampling the
delights of a decent whisky while talking of the days tht used to be . .
. or that's how it should be.

THE QUEEN'S oldest grandson, Peter Phillips, is on the verge of
becoming the first royal to represent Scotland on an international
sporting field. He has been selected to play in a Scottish Rugby Union
trial at Murrayfield next Wednesday.
A good performance in the trial could earn the 17-year-old, ninth in
line to the throne, a place in the Scottish schoolboys' XV for the
international series against England, Wales, Ireland and France which
starts next month.
A sixth-former at Gordonstoun, and a flanker, he is among 40 boys
selected for the trial and has been described by SRU secretary Bill Hogg
as an ''outstanding prospect''.
The selection is thought to be particularly pleasing for his mother,
the Princess Royal, who is the SRU patron and a keen follower of
Scotland at rugby.
He was chosen along with five other Gordonstoun pupils after an
impressive display for a boarding school XV which beat South of Scotland
schools 21-0 in Kelso on Wednesday.
Although born in London, he is qualified to play for Scotland, up to
the senior international side, under SRU rules, having been resident
north of the border for more than three years. He has been a pupil at
Gordonstoun since 1990. All pupils at Scottish schools are eligible for
the schoolboys' XV.
Mr Hogg said: ''Peter is a very skilful player. He moves forward a lot
and has very much an attacking style. We certainly look on Princess
Anne, Peter and Zara as being Scottish. There is no doubt about that and
I think that is shared by the nation.''
A spokeswoman for Gordonstoun said last night: ''Staff are delighted.
He is a very enthusiatic rugby player.''
Also in the trial is Gordonstoun school captain Fergie Gladstone,
great-great-grandson of the Victorian Prime Minister.
The Princess Royal and Mr Mark Phillips represented Britain in
equestrian events at the 1972 Munich Olympics.

FREDERICK WEST gave evidence from beyond the grave in his wife's
defence yesterday, his taped voice heard confessing to murders, and
saying she knew nothing about them.
It is the first time a court has heard the evidence of someone who,
but for his death, would have been a co-accused on a multiple murder
trial.
In the most dramatic day of evidence at Winchester Crown Court so far,
the jury heard Fred West speak in a calm, matter-of-fact way of killing
young women and girls, including his first wife, daughter and
step-daughter.
Speaking in a broad Herefordshire accent, he listed his victims and
told how he dismembered most of them before burying them in the cellar
and garden of his home at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester.
Even his eldest daughter Heather had her legs and head removed with an
ice saw before being bundled into a dustbin for burial close to a
children's Wendy House in the narrow rear garden.
Mr Richard Ferguson, QC, defending Mrs Rosemary West on 10 counts of
murder, had asked that only four of 145 of Fred West's taped interviews
with police be played to the jury.
However, months into the investigation over the remains found at 25
Cromwell Street, Mr West admitted to police he had not told the truth.
The jury heard a tape declaring that from the first day of the inquiry
Mr West held matters back.
''The reason for this is I wanted to protect another person or other
persons,'' West, who committed suicide on New Year's Day while on
remand, is heard saying.
Police officers told the court that throughout the many taped
interviews, which lasted for 110 hours in total, Fred West had
consistently lied. When found out, he merely changed his story.
Mrs Rosemary West wept in the dock as her late husband gave his
account of how he murdered their 16-year-old daughter, Heather.
Without a hint of remorse or shame, he told police he strangled
Heather after she had threatened to give ''acid'' to her younger
brothers and sisters and thereafter encourage them to jump off the
church roof next door.
''She had a smile and a sort of smirk on her face, like, 'You try me,
I'll do it'. I lunged at her and grabbed her around the throat and I
held her for a minute.
''The next minute she had gone blue. I was shaking from head to foot.
I put her on the floor and blowed air into her mouth and pumped her on
the chest. She just kept going bluer.''
Later, when she had gone cold, he dismembered her body by cutting off
her legs and her head with an ice saw. This operation, he said, was
carried out in a bathroom.
Later that evening, after he sent his wife out to spend the night with
a black man, he buried the remains in the garden at the Wendy House.
''I think the main bulk of her body is in the middle and her legs are
on the side. The head is at the foot,'' West said when asked by police
what they might expect when they excavated his garden.
He told officers: ''I've had to live with this for eight years. It's
not easy, I tell you, because I loved Heather.''
Later he added: ''Rose knew nothing at all.''
When police went back to him after discovering other killings, he
alleged he murdered to prevent young girls telling his wife they were
having affairs with him.
''They ended up this way because they threatened to talk to Rose,'' he
told police.
At one stage he told the officers that all of these girls had fallen
in love with him. Nevertheless, he could not remember their names.
''They were all around 17 or the 20 age mark,'' was all he could tell
the police.
In the taped interviews, West insisted the first person he killed was
his Scottish wife, Rena. He told police she came from Scotland to take
charge of her daughter, Charmaine.
Mrs West is accused of murdering Charmaine when aged eight and at a
time Fred West was in prison.
Yesterday the voice of the dead man described a visit by Rena to his
home after he had been released from Leyhill Prison.
''Charmaine got mixed up in it,'' he said in the taped interview.
He said he took Rena to a public house where he got her ''absolutely
paralytic''.
Charmaine was in the back of his van, asleep.
He described how he then took Rena out into the country, an area he
knew well, strangled her and buried her.
''I think Rena had given Charmaine a drink . . . a bottle of lager or
sommat . . . and she was sound asleep and I'd forgotten all about . .
.'' the tape continued.
At this stage of the interview, Fred West turned the van into a
Vauxhall Viva car. ''I went back to the car and there was Charmaine in
the back of it. I thought 'Shit, what am I going to do now?' ''
Charmaine, he thought, was about six or seven at the time.
''So anyway I strangled her while she was sleeping, 'cos there's no
way I could have touched her any other way and wrapped her up in the
back and drove back to Midland Road 25.''
At that time there was a garage at the side of the house and he buried
Charmaine there.
The trial continues.

Clare Henry finds an artist who is relishing his retirement amid the
roar and clatter of a forge.
JOHN CREED is a happy man. His blacksmith studio sits in an old byre
up a farm track amid the Campsie Hills, an idyllic setting at any time,
but an especial joy this sunshine year. ''At lunchtime I eat outside,
soaking in the landscape and watching the cows.''
The land belongs to the Stirling family. ''I couldn't have a better
landlady. And of course I can make a din hammering and banging without
disturbing the neigbours!''
The day I happened to visit, he was on cloud nine. It was his first
''official'' day in retirement after 24 years' teaching silversmithing
at Glasgow School of Art and he was busy on a new major project: huge
ironwork gates for the Usher Gallery at Lincoln Cathedral. His big forge
was blazing away while two anvils, a power hammer, fly press, hydraulic
pallet truck, Mig welder, argon gas cylinders, three phase electricity,
cutting torch, kiln, chains, pulleys and piles of mild steel rods stood
at the ready. Tools reminiscent of medieval torture tongs and forks line
the walls. This is no arty crafty place, but a traditional farrier's
workshop.
One gate for Lincoln is pretty well complete, bar its stainless steel
ornamental discs, gold leaf finials and a cheeky bronze Lincoln imp to
be tucked in near the centre.
''The Lincoln Imp is famous. The original is stone carved on the
cathedral. Around 1900 a silversmith called Usher made a fortune selling
miniature silver reproduction imps as keepsakes. It's his bequest that
founded the Usher Gallery in the 1920s so it seemed apt to include
one.''
The second gate, in progress, was lying on the bench under a heavy
hoist and chain. ''It took two of us half-a-day's work just to move it.
Each six-metre high gate weighs 350kg -- almost a ton the pair. A gate
has to swing. Calculations for hinges strong enough to carry them were
done by a structural engineer friend, Daphne Wassermann,'' Creed
explained.
Creed trained as a silversmith at Liverpool before working in the
design department of Sheffield's well-known firm, Walker &amp; Hall. Here in
the 1960s, silversmithing and electro-plating, pewter and stainless
steel were dealt with under one roof and he learnt the complexities of
cutlery production. Sheffield also introduced him to the new thinking in
metalwork through the famous David Mellor. Later he saw the last members
of the Guild of Spoonmakers hot forging silver cutlery in Kent. After
setting up his own workshops in Cheshire and Yorkshire he moved to
Glasgow in 1971.
They say life begins at 50 -- and sure enough Creed's new-found
passion for large scale ironwork took off that year. ''I had regularly
hot forged silver cutlery -- forged iron had always appealed -- but it
never occurred to me to do it myself.''
The leap from silver to steel is a big one. Working silver takes an
exact, regimented course. Working steel is the complete antithesis: hot,
yielding, spontaneous. Yet Creed's mix gets the best of both worlds. The
revival of creative blacksmithing in the1980s and a visit to the first
American Artist Blacksmiths Conference in summer 1988 provided the
catalyst. ''I got a term's sabbatical from teaching, went to the
conference, met Albert Paley, my mentor -- and caught the ironwork
bug.''
Creed's enthusiasm for his work is infectious. He believes the shape
of the work should develop naturally under the hammer, waxes lyrical on
the properties of iron and steel and the physical joy and energy of it
all.
''You take some metal, put it in the fire, take a hammer and you work
it. It is so honest and direct. With the simplest of tools you can
produce lovely objects. So I thought, 'this is absolutely for me'. The
quality of hot iron is superb, so lovely -- it's alive! It swells,
bends, folds, tapers, curls. It's like drawing in 3D. When it's white
hot and nearly melting it's a bit like clay. You can punch holes through
it and the hole displaces the iron so you get a swelling. I use these
qualities in my designs.''
Punching holes through a flat rod at right angles is one thing but for
the gates, which are based on a Gothic lancet arch to link in with the
cathedral, it needed holes punched on the diagonal. ''I didn't think we
could do it. It was hell. But Christoph Friedrich came over from
Switzerland to help me. I usually forge in isolation so it was a real
joy to be working with Christoph. He's an artist too, not just a
technician. The job was a real swine to do but we managed.''
It took six months. The budget for the gates, railings and grilles is
#56,000, which took a lot of fundraising till a #16,000 lottery windfall
in July clinched the project, five years in total from competition,
(Creed was the unanimous winner) to completion.
Creed is keen to emphasise the team effort aspect between client,
architect, landscape designer and himself. ''Janita Elton was the
driving force. She made it happen.''
Creed's designs for the Lincoln competition (he also won the
commission for railings and grilles for the city museum) were done at
home on the outskirts of Glasgow where his stone villa ajoins that of
Annan, the nineteenth-century photographer. Here in the 1870s the famous
Annan negatives of Glasgow's old wynds and closes were developed in smog
and smoke-free sunny Lenzie.
But gates, however splendid, are merely one aspect of this versatile
artist whose work is in international colllections from the Vatican to
London's Goldsmiths Hall. This spring he created splendid doors for the
Royal Museum of Scotland. He's also made seats for Cumbria's Sustrans
cycle way; planned entrance columns for the National Library, forged
magnificent gates for a Lenzie house, designed himself a music stand
(which will hold a pencil to mark his manuscript when turning a page),
and regularly makes mirrors, coat stands, stools, benches, candle
holders and wind vanes, the best of which rotates in his garden.
His latest extravaganza is the reconstruction of a pictist Carnyx: a
bronze war horn the height of a man, which made a chilling noise and
helped drive the Romans from Scotland. The original fragments belong to
the National Museum but it was the enterprising John Purser who
instigated the reconstruction by Creed. The fearsome bronze instrument,
in the shape of a dragon, is now in the Museum collection, and played by
Professor Kenny has just last week been released on CD under the title,
Voice of the Carnyx.
Nothing is too big nor too small to focus his attention. People
grumble about architects but he's found them excellent. ''Andrew
Merrylees saw a small, silver salt and pepper of mine and on the
strength of that asked me to make the Library's 30ft poles. A visionary
leap!''
Other silver commissions include a chalice for the Pope's visit to
Scotland in 1982; goblets to celebrate the 300th birthday of Edinburgh's
assay office; a gift for the Princess Royal; a rose bowl for Pollok
House; a crook for Strathclyde University and a present for a Greek
millionaire which involved a silver Alpha embedded with a piece of
Ravenscraig ore.
He shows regularly at Edinburgh's Scottish Gallery, where he designed
a post for their new Dundas Street sign. ''Amanda Game who runs their
applied arts side is very good; very informed.'' Creed also recently
made a bannister for one of the partner's Portobello home.
Creed's Quaker upbringing and love of music obviously plays its part.
His approach is thorough; his finish meticulous. But celebration and an
appetite for the bold gesture feature prominently too. He's a big strong
man who laughs a lot, relishes life and in his leather apron and grimy,
soot-speckled face, his hair under a kerchief, looks more like a jolly
pirate than the proverbial ''bohemian artist.''
His son has followed in the family trade, albeit in a minimalist
direction. An invitation card for Martin Creed's current show in Rome
sits proudly on the kitchen table.
Meanwhile dad's gates have just gone off to be galvanised before being
installed this month and dedicated next Easter. Creed is pleased with
them. ''They don't look heavy; they are sculptural, yet have an airy
finesse.'' He's right too.

The die is cast. After much hard negotiation with his Highland chiefs,
the prince wins their support for a march on London. Michael Fry
continues with the Jacobite troops as they descend on Kelso.
KELSO, November 4 -- Prince Charles Edward Stuart reached this little
town in the Borders today, poised to invade England.
His march out of Edinburgh five days ago, at the head of 5500 troops,
ended weeks of speculation about his intentions. It was fuelled by
fierce disputes within the council of Jacobite leaders, between the
prince's closest Irish advisers advocating a rapid advance southwards
and the Scots wanting to consolidate in their own country first.
Charles favoured the first course, but won consent to it only with
difficulty. Having taken the offensive again, he means to join battle
with the Hanoverian army as soon as possible, rouse the English
Jacobites and race for London to link up with forces which he expects
the French to ship across the Channel. King George II would then be
faced with war on two fronts on British soil. But several of the
Highland chieftains think it a tall order to conquer a Kingdom by
marching across more than 400 miles of hostile territory.
The discord seems to be reflected in some confusion over the
Jacobites' immediate objective. They have, for the time being, split
their army in two, after mustering at Dalkeith and Newbattle on the day
after their departure from Edinburgh. The prince led one column on foot
over Sourtra Hill, along the main eastern route towards the Border.
He has with him the entire Jacobite artillery, 13 cannons sent from
France by way of Montrose. He would need them to attack the nearest
Hanoverian troops, at Newcastle under General George Wade.
The other half of the army set out by way of Roslin Moor to Bridge the
Esk at Auchendinny, heading for the western end of the Border and
Carlisle. It is led by the Jacobites' military commander, Lord George
Murray. He favours an assault on undefended Cumberland, where the
terrain is better suited to the Highlanders' style of fighting than the
more level ground on the eastern side. Wade could only cut off his route
south by a fatiguing march across the Pennine Hills.
So, though Charles may keep the Government in London guessing about
his tactics, his die is cast, with everything staked on invasion of
England. He is convinced that the English Jacobites will rise as soon as
he can cross the Border, and that English troops will not risk death for
a Hanoverian monarch, as the Battle of Prestonpans showed.
But there can be no doubt of the deep misgivings over his course of
action among the senior Scots in his entourage. In principle, they are
more interested in dissolving the Union and restoring Scottish
independence. As a matter of strategy, they would prefer the promised
French help to materialise before advancing further, while leaving it to
the Hanoverian forces to attempt the reconquest of Scotland if they
dare.
The dangers of failing to secure his position in Scotland were exposed
even before the prince marched south. In two burghs which he thought he
controlled, Perth and Dundee, anti-Jacobite demonstrators took to the
streets on October 30, the birthday of King George II. In Perth one man
was killed when Highland soldiers opened fire on the crowd. In Dundee,
the Jacobite governor, David Fotheringham of Powrie, was chased out of
town for a while.
There was chaos in Edinburgh as soon as the Highland army left,
because civil government has ceased to function during the six weeks of
Jacobite occupation. Soldiers from the castle, which had held out all
through that time, came down into the city on the pretext of searching
for arms. They wrecked and plundered the rooms of Holyrood where Charles
had stayed. They also ransacked the townhouse in the Canongate of a
Jacobite commander, the Duke of Perth.
They sought out Lady Cameron of Lochiel, wife of the chieftain who is
with the prince, and insulted her, calling her a bitch and whore and
spitting in her face. They went to the Royal Infirmary to beat up
wounded Highlanders left behind.
Meanwhile the capital, along with other ports, is being blockaded by
the royal navy. The squadron patrolling the waters off the eastern coast
of Scotland has been strengthened to five ships, with several
transporters, headed by the 50-gun Gloucester under Admiral John Byng.
They completely control the Firth of Forth. While some French ships
carrying volunteers and arms have managed to reach Montrose and
Stonehaven, the chance of landing large reinforcements is now small.
That is another reason why the Scots Jacobite leaders are so worried.
The prince has in effect lost touch with the French. He does not know
what stage their preparations for the invasion of England have reached,
and cannot co-ordinate with them. By the treaty signed last month at
Fontainebleau between him and King Louis XV, all possible aid was
promised to the Jacobite rebellion. Yet it remains uncertain whether the
true aim of French policy is to depose the House of Hanover from the
throne of Great Britain, or to restore the Stuarts in Scotland only, so
breaking up the United Kingdom and permanently weakening England as a
rival, especially for colonial power.
Their support for Charles, who insists on ''three kingdoms or
nothing'', may in the event fall short of what he hopes.
In an interview, the French ambassador accompanying the prince on his
march, the Marquis d'Eguilles, gave little away. He criticised the
Jacobites for ''their divisions among themselves, their shortcomings and
above all their indolence, the main weakness of their army''. But, he
added: ''I can console myself by relying on their courage, their pride
and the terror they inspire in their enemies''.

Brothers win Scotsman race as Mail group looks to north
BROTHERS David and Frederick Barclay, who own The European newspaper
and the Ritz hotel in London, yesterday took over the Scotsman newspaper
and its sister titles, the Edinburgh Evening News and Scotland on
Sunday, in a deal reputed to be worth #90m.
Mr David Barclay's son, Aidan, will become the new chairman of the
Scotsman Publications, with the group's current managing director, Mr
Warwick Brindle, retaining his post. The present Edinburgh papers'
editors will stay in place.
Northcliffe Newspaper Group Limited, the regional arm of Daily Mail
and General Trust plc, is to take over the Aberdeen-based Press and
Journal and Evening Express newspapers at a cost of #82m, subject to
review by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and clearance by the
Department of Trade and Industry.
Yesterday's sale of the Scottish titles by the Canadian-based Thomson
Corporation brings to an end its long-term links with UK publishing,
although it will continue to manage the Aberdeen centre until the DTI
gives the official go-ahead for the sale.
Political reaction to the sale of the two newspaper groups to
different buyers has been mixed, with calls being made for assurances
that the editorial freedom of the papers, particularly the Scotsman,
would continue.
The Scottish National Party said it was disappointed that the
ownership of the five papers in the two newspaper groups in Aberdeen and
Edinburgh would be held outside Scotland.
A spokesman for European Press Holdings Ltd, the new owners of the
Scotsman, said last night it was ''absolutely committed'' to maintaining
editorial freedom for its papers.
The announcement of the takeover of the Scotsman was made to staff at
North Bridge yesterday afternoon by editor Jim Seaton. A senior North
Bridge journalist said the announcement had been greeted with applause
by editorial staff.
At boardroom level, the new chairman, Mr Aidan Barclay, will have Mr
Bert Hardy, the current chief executive of European Press Holdings, as
his new deputy chairman. Mr Glen Chip will remain as financial director.
Mr Hardy said: ''We are extremely pleased to have acquired the
Scotsman Publications. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and we
are proud to be the new owners of these quality titles.
''It is our intention to retain the present management and editors, to
whom we offer our wholehearted encouragement and support.''
Mr Charles Garside, editor of The European newspaper, bought by the
Barclay brothers in 1992, said the editors and staff of the Edinburgh
newspapers should be ''reassured'' by their new owners.
Mr Peter Williams, finance director of the Daily Mail and General
Trust plc, said that, subject to DTI approval, the Aberdeen papers would
be an excellent stablemate to Northcliffe Newspapers' other British
regional titles which include the Hull Daily Mail, Nottingham Evening
Post and Leicester Mercury.
In the year ending 1994, Aberdeen Journals Ltd made a profit of #7.7m
on a turnover of #32.3m before group charges, said the Daily Mail and
General Trust, in a statement to the Stock Exchange. Its net assets were
#15.3m at that point.
Mr Williams said: ''We can give no cast-iron guarantees, but we do not
expect redundancies.
''We believe they are very good provincial newspapers and we don't
expect anything to change. I would be very surprised if the readers
notice any difference.
''It is a growing newspaper in a very vibrant area, so we hope to look
for development from that point of view, though the papers are clearly
geographically limited by the position of Aberdeen.''
Last night, Scottish National Party MP Roseanna Cunningham said she
would be seeking assurances on all of the papers' editorial freedom.
Ms Cunningham said: ''The criteria which the SNP wanted met were the
establishment of Scottish ownership and no editorial interference in the
independence of these newspapers.
''While we are obviously disappointed that ownership will be outside
Scotland, we will now be watching very closely for any meddling in the
editorial policy of the papers.
''The readership of both the Scotsman and the Aberdeen Journals rest
upon their editorial freedom, and any attempts to interfere would be
extremely detrimental to circulation figures.
''We will now be seeking assurances from both of the new owners --
although Northcliffe still have the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
hurdle to clear -- that they will respect the vital principle of
editorial freedom.
''The record of the Barclay brothers suggests that they are likely to
adopt a hands-off approach, and it is essential that they do so if the
Scotsman is to re-establish itself after this period of uncertainty as a
major national institution.''
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said: ''I am pleased that
arrangements for the sale of the Scotsman and other Scottish titles of
Thomson Regional Newspapers has been settled, ending uncertainty and
offering the prospect of stability for staff.
''The Scotsman and its sister papers have served Scotland well for
many years and I am sure will continue to do so under the new owners.''
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist
Party, said: ''The Barclay brothers are two formidably successful Scots
who have an excellent track record in business. The Scottish
Conservative and Unionist Party wish them well in their efforts to
revive this group of newspapers.
''The change in control of both the Aberdeen and Edinburgh-based
newspapers comes at an exceptionally interesting time in Scottish
politics and we hope that under new management the Scottish Conservative
and Unionist party will have appropriate opportunity to promote its
message to the Scottish people.''
Shadow Scots Secretary George Robertson said: ''The Scotsman is a real
part of Scottish public life, and its editorial independence is
crucially important for free opinion in Scotland.
''I hope the Barclays will recognise their heavy new responsibility
and ensure the independent voice they have purchased continues to speak
with authority.''
A Scottish Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ''We hope that these
papers will now enjoy a period of stability after the uncertainty of
recent months. However, the new owners must beware of tampering with the
editorial staff of these newspapers -- each have their own distinctive
and independent identity and we will be continuing to monitor the
situation.''

The aurora borealis can be awe-inspiring. John Fowler was disappointed
but sees the light in illustrations by Mark McLellan.
ONE night after visiting kind people in the Western Isles I set off in
pitch darkness to stumble my way home along the machair. ''Look,'' said
my host, framed in the doorway and pointing up to the sky, ''the
northern lights.''
I lifted my eyes eagerly from the dim stony track towards the starlit
sky, hoping to see wonders. It was a sad disappointment. All I could
discern above was a faint veil of phosphorescence undulating against the
sooty sky. I was inclined to believe all I was seeing were shreds of
cloud reflecting the soft starlight. Certainly, it was not the dazzling
spectacle I had imagined.
Perhaps if I'd had something stronger than a cup of tea, the vision
might have been brighter. But the household was teetotal, as so many in
Harris are.
However, Mark McLellan's illustration now reveals what I might have
witnessed in other circumstances. I can imagine myself standing
somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Arctic Circle, slightly uneasy
perhaps at the presence of that mean-looking wolf, gazing up at a
full-scale display of the aurora borealis, to give the northern lights
their text book name.
Another fine image of the northern lights can be seen in this month's
BBC Wildlife magazine, in a photograph taken from the snowy wastes of
Finland.
Borealis means northern; Aurora was the name given by the Romans to
the goddess of the dawn, so perhaps the ancients saw the phenomenon as a
kind of false dawn. Maybe they'd been at the vino.
The further north you are, the more flamboyant the aurora is likely to
appear. Air travellers on the Polar route are well placed for a
grandstand view.
The same lightshow can be observed in the southern hemisphere There,
of course, it gets another name. I've not heard of the southern lights
(which sounds a bit drab, anyway) but there it's often called the aurora
australis.
These shifting curtains of bright light, usually green but often
mingled with blues and reds and other tints, occur some 60 miles above
the earth. They are the visible results of the disturbance caused when
tiny charged particles released from the sun enter our atmosphere as
they're whirled along on the solar wind. Earth's gravitational field
pulls them towards the poles, which is why the aurora can be best
observed in far northern or southern latitudes.
Sunspots give rise to these particle emissions and therefore the
occurence of the northern lights is linked to the regular increase in
sunspot activity which reaches its peak every 11 years.
THE radiant Leo hangs on the eastern horizon in the early hours of
November 15-19 and from it spray showers of meteors known as the
Leonids. Conditions are not ideal for viewing but we may be lucky.
Look out also for the Taurids (associated, naturally, with the star
Taurus), slow moving and brilliant meteors occuring at a rate of ten per
hour in the early days of this month.
Moonlight, alas, will intefere with observation. Bring out the
binoculars for a good sight of the Pleides, whose leading star,
Aldebaran, is noticeably ruddy in complexion. Directly above is another
of the brighter stars, Capella, in the constellation Auriga.

Lindisfarne, as it was, or Holy Island, as it now is, has been a haven
of tranquillity throughout the centuries. Iain White crosses the famous
causeway to learn if burgeoning tourist traffic is threatening the
peace.
WHEN the metalled causeway across the desolate, empty sands to Holy
Island was completed in 1954, many of the locals believed that the
character of the isle would be lost forever. Forty years on, however, it
is perhaps the nature of the causeway, rather than a bridge, that has
allowed it to retain its charm and a degree of separateness from the
mainland.
Although the tiny island is host to many visitors, the majority only
remain there for a few hours and are subject to the rigid and unyielding
timetable set down by the incoming tides. Holy Island is cut off for
about five hours every day and as the long caravan of traffic makes its
way back across the tidal flats of the estuary, those lucky few who have
secured accommodation here can settle down to enjoy the tranquillity and
peace of this unique place.
For centuries Holy Island enjoyed this remarkable isolation despite
the fact that at its southern end it is a mere 400 yards across the
water to the mainland. The barnacle-encrusted marker poles that line the
causeway, however, are a vivid reminder that the danger of drowning is
real enough and the Parish Register records several deaths as the tide
caught unwary travellers. Tidetables are posted at each end of the
three-mile road across the flats and as you head past the tiny wooden
refuge built high on stilts above the road you begin to experience the
magic of the island's serene atmosphere.
Originally known as Lindisfarne, the island has often been referred to
as the Cradle of Christianity in England. In 634 AD Saint Aidan of Iona
founded the original monastery at the invitation of King Oswald of
Northumbria. The monastery had a further sixteen Bishops in all, the
most celebrated being Saint Cuthbert to whom many miracles were
attributed. He spent much of his life in total isolation on the nearby
Inner Farne island but when he died his body was returned to Holy
Island. Constant Viking raids, however, prompted the monks to remove the
bones of their saint and abandon the island. His disinterred remains
were found to be in exceptional condition 11 years after his death,
prompting further credence to the saintliness of the man, and for a
further 12 years the monks wandered with his body before finally laying
him to rest in Durham Cathedral.
Today, the Priory, although a shadow of its former self, exudes a
strong atmosphere of spiritual solitude, for despite the ravages of
Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, there is much to
admire. Only two of the original Norman arches remain on the north side
but the gravity-defying stonework of the 13m rainbow arch miraculously
survived. To the west of the priory is the twelfth-century St Mary's
Parish Church whose beautiful carpet was woven by islanders from artwork
found in the Lindisfarne Gospels which are now held in the British
Library. The superb award-winning museum in the village offers visitors
a further insight into the life of the monks, with its exhibitions and
reconstructions.
Tourism is the main island occupation today and the Lindisfarne Mead
Company attracts over 200,000 visitors to their winery in the village.
This famous mead is made traditionally to a secret recipe handed down by
the original monks. Visitors can sample the mead first before buying the
product in a myriad of forms including liqueur, honey, marmalade and
fudge.
The picturesque village itself is a colourful mixture of
flower-bedecked cottages and houses, many of which offer bed and
breakfast and also sell local crafts including pottery, jewellery and
paintings. The islander's traditional occupation has always been
involved with the sea, and the upturned herring boats which line the
shore by the harbour are a reminder of better times. At the turn of the
century, two-thirds of the population were involved in fishing but
nowadays the boats are more likely to be ferrying visitors out to the
bird sanctuary of the Farne Islands than landing fish.
From the village it is only a half-mile walk to the sixteenth-century
castle which sits dramatically on a small pyramid of rock offering
superb views of the Farne Islands and the Northumbrian coast. Built by
Henry VII using stones taken from the desecrated priory it was a vital
stronghold during the civil war, being held by both the royalists and
parliamentarians, and was later even captured for a short time by two
Jacobites in 1715. Visitors today can enjoy the austerity of the
building among the huge stone fireplaces, columns and arches and explore
a delightful hidden garden behind the high battlements.
The island is fringed with long, quiet sandy beaches which can be
walked round easily in a few hours. Much of it is run as a National
Nature Reserve and over 300 different species of birds have been
recorded in a single year. The habitats of sand dunes, mudflat, and
saltmarsh provide much of interest for the birdwatcher or botanist and
during my stay I was lucky enough to share the foreshore with some
basking grey seals who caroused into the evening sunset.
Further afield there is much to explore with Bamburgh Castle sitting
majestically across the estuary and Seahouses, a lively fishing village
to the south where regular boat trips head out to the Farne Islands. To
the north is the fortified market town of Berwick whose walls and castle
have been fought over for centuries, whilst inland are the wild Cheviot
Hills and the Northumbrian National Park. The whole are is deeply
steeped in history, but as you travel over the safe passage towards Holy
Island there can be few other places where you will find yourself
literally, following in the footsteps of history.

THE young man with the floral waistcoat sings and plays into the
microphone, oblivious to the hum of multilingual conversation around
him. He looks much too robust to be a bar pianist. Then he brings across
three sheets of paper closely typed with his repertoire. I choose Miss
American Pie and that cynical little Beatles' number with the haunting
tune, Norwegian Woods. He performs them beautifully. His name is Paul
James and you'll find him in the green purlieus of the Polo Bar at the
Westbury Hotel in London's Mayfair.
The hotel, part of the Forte group, is well placed for expeditions to
Oxford Street and Piccadilly -- as well as the more stratospheric
shopping of New Bond Street with its fashion emporia ranging from Armani
to Versace. Sotheby's is on the doorstep.
The Westbury is offering a special Christmas shopping weekend package
of #164 per person (based on a shared twin or double room) from November
3 to December 18. It will look after armfuls of purchases if you want to
make repeated sorties into the consumer paradise outside, and offers the
same facilities to non-guests who have lunch (a la carte or set menu,
#15 for two courses or #22.50 for three).
The hotel itself is quietly elegant rather than ostentatious -- and
none the worse for that. The food in la Mediterranee, as its restaurant
is called, is served on art-deco-style plates of turquoise and
terracotta that match the sunny decor. Chef Geoff Balharrie has created
special Christmas dishes. There's a pre-theatre menu at #12.50 with
guaranteed 45-minute service. Staff will also arrange theatre tickets --
maybe, as they did for me, for Crazy for You, the energetic and tuneful
Gershwin musical at the Prince Edward Theatre in nearby Soho.
Rooms are modestly sized but with all the conveniences expected of a
highly-graded hotel. A white towelling robe waits to swathe you in the
bathroom. The television screen is programmed to welcome you by name --
an individual touch in an impersonal age, as are the roses on the table.
A morning newspaper -- honesty must reveal it to be a southern
broadsheet -- is delivered automatically in the morning. No doubt a
request would produce a Herald!

Dubai is a city which is still growing at a prodigious rate, and
offers guaranteed winter sunshine to the weary traveller. Magaret
Greenwood sampled it.
WHEN I left the plane at Dubai the heat that wafted over me was
blissful after the frosty autumn nip at Gatwick. Therein lies the secret
for travellers from the UK, guaranteed glorious summer weather at the
height of our winter. But be careful of visiting in June, July or
August. Then the humidity can be as high as 95% and even locals shudder
at the thought of it.
One of the seven members of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai must be
one of the fastest growing places on earth. Cranes, half finished
buildings and traffic cones are everywhere. You can soon see past them,
however, to the lovely city growing before your eyes.
At the Bur Jurman Centre, one of the air-conditioned shopping malls,
you can eat and drink at reasonable cost from restaurants serving food
from all over the world as you watch some of the 120 nationalities that
work in Dubai pass by.
Be wary of the glossy boutiques, and do haggle when prices are not
stated. It is expected. This is particularly important when using taxis.
If you don't haggle, you'll pay too much for everything. Gold and luxury
goods at duty-free prices are excellent value.
Dubai is fast becoming a centre for lovers of golf. There are three
international standard courses where you may be expected to be a good
player and pay high fees. But there are cheaper pay-as-you-play
facilities for less serious golfers and tuition is available. The Dubai
Desert Classic, the first Middle East tournament on the European PGA
circuit, is played in January. Hybrid Bermuda Grass makes the game
possible in the arid desert climate.
May welcomes the Dubai Sailing Boat Race, but for something completely
different go camel racing. The animals are specially bred for racing and
ridden by children.
If the fancy takes you, hire a boat for deep sea fishing and try your
hand with shark and barracuda. Or do nothing much at all but lie on the
sand and enjoy the sun.
Dubai gets most of its water from desalination. Little or nothing
grows naturally. Experts travel abroad and choose plants that will
survive the harsh conditions. To make sure, each will have its own
individual watering system, small pipes that gush at intervals
throughout the day.
Walking through Creekside Park you will see flowering trees and
shrubs. On one side is The Creek, an inlet from the Arabian Gulf and the
centre of Arab trading for centuries. The quay is piled high with
cargoes of all kinds and the dhows, now motorised, wait alongside for
loading. The prosperity of modern Dubai comes from exports and
re-exports. Tourist dhows will take you on a trip round The Creek, or
see Dubai by night.
It is possible to walk in perfect safety at any time, even through the
souks (markets) or past the crammed shops and stalls of the trading
quarter.
Four and five-star hotels are in abundance, western in ambience and
equal to any in the world, but not so expensive. We had a marvellous
dinner for three in the Ramada Hotel for 350 Dirhams (#21 each). Alcohol
is freely available in restaurants, bars and clubs, but not outside.

There is precious little wild land left in Europe but, on a remarkable
journey, Ian Mitchell discovers a route which takes him through
hauntingly beautiful country - and to sex, death and madness.
AFTER a couple of weeks' strenuous climbing, I fancied something
different. Something long, but flattish. My finger had often traced an
obvious route following the lines of the rivers flowing out of the
Atholl mountains, linking the old drove roads through the passes of
Gaick and Glen Tilt. A route which appeared trackless, and which I had
never heard or read of anyone doing. It was time for my feet to follow
my dreaming finger on a three-day hike through the wilds accompanied
only by sex, death and madness.
To the Tarf Hotel.
I got off the train at Blair Atholl station on a fine summer's
afternoon, and fortified myself before starting on the first leg of the
trek, at the grand tea shop in the Water Mill beside the station. The
sustenance was welcome as I was only lightly provisioned. My destination
that night was the Tarf Bothy, about 15 miles away. That far, I would be
on familiar ground.
The route goes up Glen Tilt on the west side of the river from the old
bridge of Tilt, before crossing to the east below Croftmore, re-crossing
again at Marble Lodge. This is a private estate road, part-tarred, part
Land Rover track which makes easy walking until it reaches the stalker's
house at Forest Lodge. There are a few inhabited houses in the Glen, and
this is the last, eight miles from the station. In fact, Mr Pirie, the
''gamie'', was the last person I saw for almost two days.
The lower reaches of the glen are delightful, with mixed woodland and
deep river gorges framed by steep hillsides. Everywhere are the ruins of
crofts and shielings from the days when the glen had a population of
several hundred; today it has about 10. Hundreds more passed through
annually, driving cattle from the Highlands to the lowland trysts. Today
Braemar-Blair Atholl is a popular long-distance walk, but not the one I
had in mind.
After Forest Lodge the glen narrows and becomes barer, with fine views
back towards Bheinn a Ghlo. At Dun Beag, a fairly recent Land Rover
track has been bulldozed westwards to the Tarf, but I resisted its
temptation and carried on north to the delightful Falls of Tarf and the
Bedford Memorial Bridge. This bridge was built in 1885, to commemorate
the loss of life of an English student in Tarf Ford. It was erected by
the Rights of Way Society, formed after a celebrated case in 1847
against the Duke of Atholl which opened the glen to public access.
This magical place is worth an extra couple of miles walk. It was much
admired by Queen Victoria, who forded it on horseback in 1861.
From the falls a good track leads, past ruined shielings, to a pony
shelter high on the moor; I found it bereft of ponies, but full of frogs
which seemed to be breeding profusely. I had been to the Tarf Hotel, as
the Feith Uaine bothy is popularly called, a couple of times before,
when it was semi-ruinous. Recently restored by the Mountain Bothies
Association, it lies a bittock short of 2000 ft, with little in the way
of a path between it and the pony-hut, so I was very pleased to cross
its portals, about six hours out from Blair Atholl.
Though previously more used since restoration, the Tarf was empty when
I arrived, and I passed the time reading the hut log book. Epic tales
were there of people floundering in deep drifts and battling blizzards
in winter, but most memorable was of a walker finding the rivers Tarf
and Feithe Uaine joined in a loch, and of a six-foot wave of ice and
water-melt crashing against the side of the ''hotel!'' I bedded at dusk
hoping for a good sleep and an early start next day, facing about the
same distance but over immeasurably rougher terrain.
Maybe I was mad, like a certain Robertson who escaped from a lunatic
asylum in 1883, and made his home in the Tarf Bothy 'til captured?
The country around Tarf is high rolling moorland, achieving its impact
from loneliness and desolation, rather than from dramatic grandeur.
There can be fewer ''emptier quarters'' in our islands. My plan was
simple; to follow the waters of the Tarf to their head below Beinn
Bhreac, and from there navigate a route through to Gaick. The sun
struggled with mist on the tops as I set off, sticking close to the
green sward at the riverside. This made pleasant going, occasionally
helped by traces of animal-made paths.
Landscape mirrored the sense of isolation; every hill was contoured
like its neighbour and I thought this would be hard country to navigate
in bad weather. The monotony was relieved by the chirping and bobbing of
the dippers in the river, each pair of which seemed to inhabit its own
particular stretch.
Apart from places where landslips on the banks forced river crossings,
the going was easier than expected, until I reached the watershed and
the river banks vanished in a mass of rutted peat hags and bogs. Here I
encountered my first human artefact since the bothy; a line of cairns
crossing the hags, apparently guiding the way to Beinn Bhreac, for what
reason I could not imagine.
The descent down the Allt a Chuil was rougher, the sides of the glen
hemming me in, picking up deer tracks now and again. But visually it was
a delight after the uniformity of the Tarf, as side rivulets created
enticing Glens and waterfalls to refresh my eye. Finally, at a couple of
ruined shielings about a mile from the head of Glen Bruar, a track
(definitely man-made) guided me down to a point where the old Minigaig
pass (yet another of the so-called Mounth passes) dropped to Bruar.
And I dropped, for sustenance, four hours out from my ''hotel''.
Gaick was still far off, and after lunch I was pleased to find a
stalker's path leading off the Minigaig over the moorland above the
Faith Ghorm Ailleag, a pleasant gorge with trees clinging to the
waterfalls along its tributaries. The day was now clear and sunny, but
this could be the most difficult part of the trek to navigate. The path
ended at a group of butts, and in bad weather it would be so easy to
continue along the burn which heads south into trackless territory. But
a little nick in the steep banks at 8100-8050 is the key to unlock the
route to Gaick.
After some rough and tussocky hags, the Allt Garbh Chaig began to fall
out of the moors until -- a bit further on than the OS map indicates --
a reasonable path traces a route down. This glen is a little Khyber
Pass, steep and rocky above the tumbling burn.
Late afternoon brought hunger after my fasting in the wilderness, and
also a rising wind, so I had eyes peeled for somewhere sheltered to
light my primus when I saw a strange stilted structure ahead. On
reaching it, I discovered it was surrounded by abandoned barbed wire and
fence posts, and looked like a prison-camp tower. Had a Stalag film been
shot here, or was it a proposed concentration camp for rights of way
agitators? A ladder led between its legs, and I climbed up.
Inside there was floor space and a seat, giving a fine view of the
wind combing the hair of the waterfalls on Sron Bhuirich. Though it
shoogled in the wind, I knew it would do -- and for more than a kitchen,
as I was uncertain of dossing possibilities further down-glen. The rest
of the daylight hours, and those of night, were spent in hermit-like
elevation.
On coming out of the hills towards Gaick Lodge (a brilliant white
against the ultramarine Loch ant-Seilich) the country changed
dramatically into a model of glaciated landscape. Steep hills fell to
huge verdant flats around the lodge. Near it was a monument to the
''Loss of Gaick'', when four men were killed in an avalanche here in
1800 -- one of the victims reputed to have had a pact with the devil.
But the area was witness to a more diabolical tale of temptation
hundreds of years before that. Walter Comyn was the feudal lord of
Badenoch, and set off to supervise the building of a road through Gaick
to Atholl, ordering that on his return all women between 15 and 30
should be working naked in his fields.
But he never returned to feast his eyes. His foot was found first, in
the stirrup of his horse, maddened with terror and foaming at the mouth.
Further searching revealed Walter's battered body with two eagles
feasting on it . . .
Until a century ago, a favourite curse of the old Badenoch people was
''Diol Bhaltair an Gaig ort!'' (Walter's fate in Gaick on you.)
Hunger rather than lust was my problem, and I hoped to be spared
Walter's fate as I faced the last, easier stage of my trek to Kingussie,
down Glen Tromie. This glen reminded me of the Tilt, both in its wooded
aspects, and the fact that it was traversed by a private estate road,
with the occasional habitation. At Lynaberock stood a solitary ruin of a
clachan that once had 200 people, church and school. By Tromie Bridge I
sat down, and ate my last few cold potatoes, hoping I looked pathetic
enough to offer a lift to -- and had success.
I was so hungry, I feared I might hallucinate, and begin to see naked
damsels in the Badenoch fields. But again luck was in, and I waited only
five minutes for a train at Kingussie, and on board indulged my gluttony
after the sparse fare of the past couple of days. But Walter's cruel
fate kept all lascivious notions at bay until I was far from Gaick.
I had thoughts that this track was a ''first'', of patenting the route
and producing the T-shirts and mugs, but later found I had been beaten
to it -- by a mad horse. After Walter's death in Gaick -- by witchcraft,
avalanche or at the hands of outraged husbands -- his horse dragged him
to the Ghaig headwaters and left him there -- minus foot. It then
careered to the vicinity of the Tarf Falls, where it was found -- with
foot -- at a place still called Ruig Leth-chois (shieling of the one
foot).
The mad beast had found the Atholl High Route as logical a one as I
had, if not as enjoyable.
The walk requires OS Landranger 35,42 and 43. and I estimate it at
about 50 miles in total. Train times, Scotrail Glasgow. Youth Hostel at
Kingussie, if needed.

Special travel correspondent Katie Wood selects the best bargains in
short breaks an long hauls.
WHERE will you be on Christmas Day? Slumped in front of the telly
awash with plum pud and surrounded by boring relatives? This year why
not break free and go to the Moon? OK then, the Mountains of the Moon.
Leave December 11 with Sherpa Expeditions (0181 577 2717) and on
Christmas Day you could be in the Queen Elizabeth National Park where
you can spot ''tree-climbing lions'' (the ground is so dusty they take
to the branches). This is just one highlight on a 19-day trek in Uganda
that includes a visit to a chimpanzee sanctuary, a boat trip along the
Kazinga channel with hippo viewing, plus sightseeing in Kampala. The
cost to spend this alternative Christmas is #1555. This covers scheduled
flights from Heathrow, transfers, four nights hotel, B&amp;B, the remainder
camping with all meals, porters while trekking, and a Sherpa leader's
services throughout.
* SOLOS -- the singles specialist -- have two departures to Mombasa
this month. One is on November 19 for those aged 30 and upwards, and
another is on November 26 for the 50+ age group. Accommodation is in the
Indian Ocean beachside hotel featuring watersports galore plus an
evening entertainment programme. The cost is #745 including return
flights to Gatwick.
* IF you've no kids, or far worse -- have left your own at home to
sneak off for a week's R&amp;R -- one of the worst scenarios is to arrive in
a ski resort, be allocated your chalet and find out that you're sharing
with a young family. Thin walls and crying babies do not a successful
skiing holiday make. If this sounds horribly familiar, try Ski Beat this
year. This Bristol-based company offer child-free chalets and run
various locations in Europe. Prices are average. Tel 0117 955 7361. They
also offer chalets and packages tailored just for families, and in La
Plagne this year they have an all-day ski school for kids who have
graduated from the nanny service.
* SUNSET Travel Holidays has organised a one-off package to Reunion
Island and Mauritius to include flights from Paris to Reunion by
Concorde and by subsonic flight for the 20-minute hop to Mauritius. Talk
about the ultimate weekend away? The two-day break departs London
December 3 (via Paris) and you return December 6. Stay at the deluxe Le
Tousserok or other suitably up-market properties and the price is a
mere(!) #4195. A nice little pre-Christmas treat for all the lottery
winners out there. Call 0171 498 9922.
* IF you're looking for a Scottish farmhouse in which to base a
self-catering holiday give a call to the Scottish Farmhouse Holidays
(tel 01337 830451) and ask for a free copy of their 1995 brochure.
Detailing almost 100 properties in all regions, prices start from just
#19 per person per night. Ideal to book a base for a festive break away
from city fumes.
* AIRTOURS has increased the choice of destinations offered in its
Weddings of Fantasy brochure, which runs from May 1996 to April 1997.
Now on offer are the Dominican Republic, Cancun in Mexico, Walt Disney
World in Florida, Banff in Canada, and Sri Lanka. Also featured again
are Jamaica, Barbados, Las Vegas, Florida, Thailand, Cyprus and Austria.
Travel agents should have brochures now.
* THE number of overseas visitors to the UK in July 1995 was the
highest ever recorded, according to National Heritage Secretary Virginia
Bottomley. Good news for all in the tourism industry as 2.62 million
tourists came to Britain in that month, bringing the total from January
to July 1995 to 12.85 million visitors -- up 11% on last year. They
spent #6060m -- a 15% increase over 1994-95.
* IN A recent survey on the overall efficiency and product knowledge
of travel agents in Glasgow run by Travel Weekly, Trailfinders in
Sauchiehall Street and Going Places in the same street came out tops.
The travel industry newspaper commented that in Glasgow ''overall the
standard of agents was very high'' -- good to know. Trailfinders won a
certificate of commendation and were deemed ''friendly and knowledgeable
consultants''.
* TURKEY specialist Sunquest Holidays has spoken out against industry
rumours that it is in financial trouble. Coming just a couple of weeks
after the company went on view-data as part of its plans to increase its
market share by being available through more travel agencies, the
company MD Ali Killic commented: ''There is no way that we are
vulnerable''. So if you're thinking of Turkey for 1996 you can still
book confidently with this company which is regarded as one of the best
running to Turkey.
* SCOTTISH hotelier Ken McCullough is close to completing a deal to
develop Malmaison properties into a nationwide concern. The plan looks
to open Malmaisons in Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Birmingham and
London as a joint venture with hotel operator Arcadian International.
The success of his Edinburgh and Glasgow properties were crucial to this
development but there seems no problems on that score -- Malmaison
Glasgow achieved a 79% occupancy average in the first six months of
1995. Plans are afoot to expand the Glasgow operation from 21 to 74
rooms.
* BRITISH Airways has held top position among international airlines
in the latest rankings from the International Civil Aviation
Organisation. BA notched up 81.4 billion international passenger
kilometres in 1994. Second was United Airlines and third Lufthansa, but
more miles are put in on BA planes than any other airline in the world,
and that's official.
* SKIING in Norway is becoming increasingly popular, so much so that
in response to demand the Norwegian Tourist Board has introduced a
Winter Travel Planner detailing information on skiing resorts, tour
operators and flight connections to the country. For Scots the SAS
Aberdeen flights are an attractive option, or if you're prepared to
travel south both Crystal Holidays and Ski Scandinavia are operating
charters to Norway for the second year. NSR Travel offer the best value
package deals, and a copy of their brochure can be had by calling 01425
278829.

GARDENING
Instead of worrying over the perfect compost or blanketing your crops
in chemicals, Rose Piper argues that a more sensible solution is to
return to simple ways of keeping the soil nourished and healthy
WHERE'S there's muck there's brassicas. A while ago, while idly
looking through a collection of old gardening books, I found a real
treasure by one A C Marshall. In this comfortingly slim volume, Simple
Gardening for All, Marshall opens with an arcadian vision of the
vegetable garden: ''That we shall find content there is no doubt
whatsoever, and the health that follows labour in God's good fresh air.
A little profit may go hand in hand with a lot of pleasure, and the joy
will proceed from planning and sowing, from keen anticipation, and
finally from the reaping. And yet, with it all, no garden is ever
finished . . .''
Judging from my own allotments, Marshall's vision is still realised by
many, but for others the ''reaping'' remains an unfilled joy, and plots
are soon abandoned as their owners discover they have neither the time
nor energy it demands. But there are other reasons for failure, the most
obvious being absence of manure. However much time and energy we put
into our beloved ground, the absence of this essential ingredient will
mean ''a little proof'' soon becomes no profit at all.
On the subject of ''how to use manure'', many modern gardening books
soon have you falling on your hoe with wellies turned skywards in
despair after plodding through endless details about how to make the
perfect compost heap or calculate the precise square yardage of toxic
additives needed to bring that prize-winning abundance so many crave.
Forget all this.
We need simpler solutions, and these do exist provided you are not
concerned to show off the longest leeks this side of Newcastle.
I have two solutions to offer, both tried and found satisfactory. The
idea for the first one came from a Yorkshire gardener who claimed that
to spread manure on the soil surface in late autumn was every bit as
effective as double-digging in it. By March the manure has broken down
into a fine enough tilth to be turned over easily just before sowing
time. The humus this creates not only nourishes the crops but provides
the essential texture to hold moisture in the soil, even in periods of
drought.
No more back-breaking trench digging, though you need a stout back and
barrow to get the manure to your plot in the first place. I buy a ton of
well-rotten zoo manure every two years or so for about #25. I spread it
straight on to the soil at a thickness of roughly three to four inches.
The surplus can be stored in a heap and used in the spring or following
autumn.
There are, of course, many other organic sources of nutrient --
homemade compost for one. The problem with the latter is that although
it costs nothing to make, it is difficult to produce enough to feed an
area the size of an allotment. It is also fickle.
Much care, and more grass clippings than most plot holders have, is
needed in the making otherwise all that results is a stinking heap of
cold, nutritionally-barren mush.
My second solution is green manure -- particular kinds of plants which
can be sown as seed then dug in as leafy plants to give structure and
plant food to the soil. The first trick is to find a source for the
seeds. The one I use is Chase Organics, the retail arm of the Henry
Doubleday Research Association. The seeds cost much less than the #25
needed for a load of manure, and all varieties can be sown in late
September after most of the mid-season vegetables have been dug up. The
lush green foliage leaves little room for unwanted weeds and produces
good moisture-retaining humus after it is dug in during late March (but
don't leave it until the grain develops or nitrogen will be robbed
rather than given to the soil).
Green manures belonging to the pea family, such as field beans and
lupins, have the added advantage of nitrogen-gathering bacteria in the
lumps of their roots (which is why it is wise to leave the roots of
legumes in the ground as long as possible). The problem with these is
that they can be grown only in spring and summer when most of the ground
is needed for vegetables. Mustard can be planted late in the year but is
susceptible to the dreaded clubroot.
There are many more varieties to choose from to suit your rotation,
and the list grows every year. So, if you want a cheap alternative to
animal manure, and a less creaking back, try going down the green path
next time.

THE worst film that I've ever seen is Free Willy which I went to with
my son. I'd be a real sad case if I'd gone on my own. It was such a bad
film. It was about this dolphin -- no whale -- called Willy that this
little boy makes friends with. These baddies want to capture Willy so
the boy gets caught up in this adventure where he tries to help the
whale escape and go back into the sea. It's so sentimental and over the
top. There just seems to be so many children's films that have no
imagination at all. My son quite liked it but I was completely irritated
by it. Kill Willy or Finish Willy Off would have been a lot better.

HOW would the man (or woman) in your life react if you called them a
stuffed shirt? Probably not too favourably . . . but if you were to give
them a Stuffed Shirt you'd be flavour of the month.
If your looking for inspiration for Christmas, this is just one of the
many superb gift ideas at Gladstone &amp; Brooke in Princes Square, Glasgow,
especially if you're Christmas shopping for the more difficult members
of the family.
After two years, Gladstone &amp; Brooke have established themselves as a
provider of fine quality luggage and leather goods, but there is more to
the store. Apart from the wonderful aroma of leather, the welcoming
decor of light wood and soft lighting, the first thing the customer will
experience at Gladstone &amp; Brooke is an extremely friendly and relaxed
atmosphere accompanied by a high level of service.
The staff are clearly au fait with every aspect of each product the
store has on display, and are happy to spend time with customers to give
advice and ensure they have all the information they need to make their
decisions.
That service doesn't just apply to large purchases. At this time of
the year, Christmas shoppers will be heading to Gladstone &amp; Brooke to
chose smaller gifts that can be appreciated not only for their
usefulness, but for fine craftsmanship and the ability to last longer
than just through to the next Christmas.
The Stuffed Shirt, as mentioned earlier, is just one excellent idea.
It is a compact overnight case in a selection of leathers or canvas
which can keep a shirt or blouse in pristine condition for those
unexpected business trips or important meetings. The case, which is A4
size, will also hold a tie, underwear, socks, and a small amount of
toiletries, perfect for a briefcase or desk drawer.
On the shelves throughout the store there is a wide selection of
perfect gifts for men and women of taste.
Any business person would be delighted to receive a new briefcase --
especially one that gives them a sense of individuality that office
clothes sometimes take away. Gladstone &amp; Brooke have looked to the
United States to introduce the innovative range from Zero Halliburton.
Constructed from aerospace quality aluminium they have a decidedly
futuristic appearance. Other distinctive attaches come in deep reds and
forest greens. Traditionalists can breath easy however, there are ranges
of stylish briefcases and a superb selection of personal organisers in
the most beautiful leathers from respected names such as Pielle and
Texier.
To complete the professional business image, chose a leather suiter
which will keep sharp suits looking freshly laundered, even after a
journey half-way round the world.
In a constant search to bring new and better names to Glasgow's
shoppers, Gladstone &amp; Brooke are introducing carefully chosen new
product lines.
For this autumn/winter the Davidoff range of wallets will delight
those looking for something different. Made from the softest leather,
the Davidoff range will never be bent out of shape and has no sharp
stiff corners to wear away at trouser pockets -- and of course they look
great too.
From Italy, long recognised as the centre for style, comes the
Coccinelle range for women. A range of framed bags which is the
essential look for this year and for spring/summer '96.
More Italian labels such as The Bridge and Enny are well represented,
from small purses and keyrings to beautifully styled handbags.
Even the untrained eye can gauge the superior finish and quality of
the leather, but should you wish to know more, the staff can tell you of
the techniques employed in creating each finished look.
For the finishing touch to any winter outfit, Gladstone &amp; Brooke also
stock one of the most varied ranges of leather and suede gloves in the
city.
With winter breaks becoming increasingly popular, the store has a wide
choice of luggage available all year round.
The Brics range has typical Italian flair and style, but it is built
to last on a good solid frame. The range goes from large suitcases
through various styles of holdalls to beauty cases and toilet bags; it's
a versatile range to cover you from a weekend away to the family
holiday.
Whatever you choose, when you buy a gift from Gladstone &amp; Brooke the
lucky recipient can rest assured that they won't see many other people
around town with it. Some of the names found in the store are limited
editions, and are exclusive to Gladstone &amp; Brooke in Glasgow, some are
even exclusive in Scotland.
It would be an extraordinarily difficult person to please, who
wouldn't be delighted by a gift from Gladstone &amp; Brooke. But, in that
event, there is another solution. Give them the store's gift vouchers
and present them with the added pleasure of experiencing Gladstone &amp;
Brooke for themselves.

HOLLYWOOD glamour was an unexpected by-product of the goldrush, don't
you know? Early American pioneers followed that wagon trail way out
west, stopping just short of the Pacific Ocean, and set up camp in the
hills high above Hollywood. Although they struck neither gold nor oil,
they discovered right there this resource more fabulous by far. And
Hollywood has been camping it up ever since.
Not to be confused with the chique which emanates so effortlessly from
the world's most elegant women, Hollywood's particular strain of glamour
is all about artifice. It is the sensation which radiates from every big
screen icon, and continuing inspiration and fascination for the fashion
world.
It is bold, brash, and very big -- big screens necessitate big
statements -- an extravagant cocktail, all show and sensuality.
Few women these days can accommodate the trappings of glamour within
the pressurised reality of their nine-to-five lifestyles. It is hard to
be taken seriously if you arrive at the office wearing a cute cocktail
hat, wristfulls of diamante and a floor-length sweep of faux fur. But,
in reaction to the pared-down athleticism which had begun to blur any
distinction between the contents of a gym locker and the lingerie
drawer, glamour has returned to underwear.
First, back came the Wonderbra -- and before you could say ''Marilyn
Monroe'' or ''Jane Russell'' those clever manufacturers had this
remarkable piece of engineering recast in shimmering satin.
Leopard print was not contrary to popular misconception, invented by
Jackie Collins or Bet Lynch. Big cat patterns have been part of the
language of glamour for as long as there have been moving pictures. To
fashion designers as disperate as Yves Saint Laurent and Dolce &amp;
Gabbana, leopard remains an irresistable motif defining the sexy edge of
glamour.
Bring a touch of Sunset Boulevard opulence to your own little boudoir
with Ralph Lauren's leopard-print bed linens -- or the charmingly kitsch
faux fur table lamps from The Furnishing Union. And if you think, like
Norma Desmond, that you are ready for your close-up, Mr De Mille will of
course expect to find you in Anna Sui's saucy leopard-print satin slip.

The Magic Magyars and Jimmy Johnstone. Liz Taylor believes the
memories will come flooding back at a superb footballing auction.
FOOTBALL jerseys and caps, winners' medals, and championship cups are
all coming under the hammer at Christie's in Glasgow next Wednesday,
November 8.
Every year the auction house holds a Football Memorabilia Sale which
is attended by people who would not otherwise spend time in a saleroom,
for they are not interested in the nuances of brushwork in the Old
Masters, but revel in the kicking and tackling techniques of past heroes
of the football pitch.
This year they will be tempted by a selection of jerseys worn by such
famous footballers as Graham Roberts whose Tottenham Hotspur 1981 FA Cup
final jersey is expected to fetch around #400, and Ernest Taylor who
played for Newcastle United in the 1951 FA Cup Final in a black and
white No. 8 jersey and black satin shorts which are in the sale at
around #800.
A cap and blue cotton England international jersey and a cap which
Taylor also wore are in the sale estimated at around #500. The cap
graced his head for one of the greatest football matches ever played,
the memorable match between England and Hungary in 1953. The result was
totally unexpected because the ''Magic Magyars'' beat a previously
undefeated English team at Wembley by six goals to three, using tactics
which left the distinguished English players bewildered and dazzled.
Some other jerseys, particularly a red and white Feyenoord jersey No.
10, a red and white Queen's Park Rangers No. 2, and a red and white
striped Barcelona jersey No. 5, were acquired by Graham Roberts by
swopping with other players after international matches. They are in the
sale with estimates ranging from between #100 and #600.
Medals are even more avidly collected than jerseys and there will be
keen bidding for two which were awarded to Dr James Paterson, a Glasgow
minister's son, who, as ''Boy'' Paterson, joined the Rangers team in
1910. He played for them while he was studying medicine at Glasgow
University and was on the winning side when Rangers won the Division 1
League Championship in 1912.
Paterson graduated as a doctor in 1916 and immediately went to fight
in France where he won the Military Cross. On his return home, he joined
his old team again and in 1919 achieved a personal record of 22 goals in
one season. When he took over a medical practice in London in 1920, he
signed for Arsenal as an amateur and played on till 1926.
Of his two medals in the sale, the most expensive one, with an
estimate of around #700, is 9ct gold and enamel, inscribed ''Scottish
Football League Championship 1919-20'', and the reverse inscribed
''Rangers Football Club Ltd Won by J Paterson.''
Even more expensive at around #3000 is the 9ct gold medal won by
Ernest Taylor when he was a member of the Newcastle United team that
defeated Blackpool 2-0 in the FA Cup Final of 1950-51. Both goals were
scored by the famous Jackie Milburn.
Taylor participated in three FA Cup Finals for three different clubs
-- Newcastle United in 1951; Blackpool in 1953; and Manchester United in
1958. Twice he was on the winning side and when Blackpool won in 1953,
it was because Taylor managed to get the ball out to Stanley Matthews
who was waiting on the wing. He ended his career by becoming coach for a
team in New Zealand, New Brighton Football Club, which he joined in
1964.
A Scottish Cup winner's medal for 1971-72, awarded to one of Celtic's
most famous players, Jimmy Johnstone, is also in the sale. In that match
Celtic defeated Hibs by six goals to one. The medal is estimated at
around #1200.
Another football ''great'' from the 1950s was Ian Crawford who played
for Hearts. His Scottish Cup winner's medal for 1955-56 when Hearts beat
Celtic by three goals to one, with Crawford scoring two of the winning
goals, is in the sale with an estimate of between #700 and #900. His two
League Championship medals for the seasons 1957-58 and 1959-60 are also
included with the same estimates.
There is a huge interest in collecting old football programmes, of
which there are several lots in the sale. The most hotly contested will
probably be a rare Notts County versus Bolton Wanderers programme for a
game played at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, on December 26, 1885. Both
teams featured famous players and future internationalists.
Although the programme is folded, lightly soiled and torn at the
folds, it is expected to sell for around #700.
MARKET NEWS
A FINE pair of politicians will feature in a sale to be held in
Phillips in Edinburgh on November 17. They are Gladstone and Disraeli,
Gladstone looking gloomy and Disraeli very dashing, and they are rare
ceramic figures, 40cm high, standing on mottled turquoise and brown
bases. The figures are marked W R, and were retailed by Whitman and
Roth, a Victorian firm of importers and wholesalers. The estimate for
the pair is between #2000 and #3000.

What a difference a day makes. The winners of our Herald/Cheynes
Makeover Competition turn up looking the same, and leave with Anvar Khan
marvelling at the difference.
THE collective years of the winners of the Herald/Cheynes Makeover
Competition came to an amazing 134, but upon leaving the salon the
number had dwindled to an insignificant 90. If beauty is a matter of
genetics, then the morning makeover at the Edinburgh salon broke
bar-codes imprinted at birth.
The aim of the Herald/Cheynes Competition, launched by Beauty Box, was
to furnish winning readers with professional and friendly advice.
Neither Pat Matheson, 49, from Lenzie, Sally Hislop, 37, from East
Kilbride, or Eleanor Calder, 48, from Galashiels, however, needed a
critical appraisal. They are, frankly, a bunch of good-looking women
who, mysteriously, all turned up at the salon wearing the same thing.
They say that the moon and the female condition are intertwined, that
our moods are as cyclical as the tide. This is biological folklore,
supposedly relevant only to ovaries, not wardrobes. But nevertheless,
Pat, who studies marriage counselling, Sally who is more than two months
pregnant, and Eleanor, a college registrar, all complete strangers to
one another, each wore a white shirt and a coloured waistcoat to their
rebirth. A fact which was much commented on and mulled over in disbelief
as the day unravelled.
Only teenybops experiment, the middle-aged can talk themselves out of
anything. ''They are so nice,'' said Lorraine, a salon director and our
organiser and welcomer, on the fact that The Herald had supplied three
women with no fear. ''They are really into it.'' The gals were game and
all credit to them.
''I'm quite happy just to go with the flow,'' said Pat, reasoning that
it might be time to take a chance and step into the breach. ''I just
think you are all so wonderful for doing this,'' said Sally, beaming,
addressing the attentive throng of journalist, make-up artist and
stylist. ''I've been so looking forward to this,'' said Eleanor, quietly
hopeful.
Cheynes supplied fresh orange, scones, chocolate biscuits and coffee
while each winner popped upstairs for a consultation with Dawn, the
salon's colour technician. Pat and Eleanor decided to stick to a basic
colour created at home using dye-kits, but opted for a different shade.
We chatted about how easy it is to get into a rut. Women and men always
play safe. If someone says you look great in an indigo shirt you'll buy
the one in beige because ''it'll go with everything''. But today,
caution was abandoned in favour of a slice of excitement, adventure
even, the most gratifying journey in the world where the fantasy of
being able to look good, solidifies.
Hairwise, Pat ended up with a warmer, more coppery shade of russet;
Eleanor went from ash blonde to bright silver. Sally, a natural
brunette, went from brown to dark chocolate with mulberry and auburn
highlights.
It is, as we agreed during the few available moments of quiet, truly
amazing how much properly applied bold colour a woman can take. Each
winner relaxed as make-up artist Felicity Brown first cleansed the face
with Clarins. Pat has an autumnal skin tone so she suited gold and taupe
around the eyes and copper lipstick. Eleanor is wintry, so blues and
bold pinks brought her features out. Sally's warm skin tone and dark
hair means she can take any dramatic colour, and was completely
re-invented with smokey greys and pinks.
''I've never worn red lipstick in my life,'' she said, as Felicity
painted on a pot-full.
In between the spraying, tinting, brushing, cups of coffee and
thumbs-up, compliments were exchanged. Eleanor, the first one finished,
had a wee wander round the salon, where smiles double as applause, to
see how the other two were shaping up. I was awarded the serious duty of
watching to see how everyone was getting on, too. An everlasting image
is that of Pat and Eleanor, on either side of a double-sided mirror in
salon overalls, looking down at a spreadeagled glossy mag with their
glasses on the end of their nose.
And after the makeover, a change of clothes and a photocall. Pat in
cream linen, Eleanor in a powder blue Thierry Mugler, and Sally in
Moschino purple.
''My hair is more strawberry than I would do it,'' Pat commented.
''But I particularly like the colour. It's very warm.'' She and Eleanor
agreed, that while looking rather fantastic, it would be great to go and
see someone you really wanted to impress.
''I feel wonderful,'' said Eleanor. ''I like my hair very short and
this is soft and feathery. If it's cut too drastically it's aggressive
and butch. I can be a bit pasty too. I really like the way I look. Now
I'm going to go somewhere I can intimidate and strut my stuff.''
Sally did not seem to recognise herself but liked who she saw. In
fact, she performed the litmus test. Fearing that her husband and child
may not have been able to find a parking space when the time came to
pick her up, she ran, literally, out into the street and around the
corner. We tried not to but wondered if we'd ever see the jacket and
earrings again. No sweat. She returned intact minutes later, but without
success.
''I couldn't see the car anywhere,'' she said, ''but I saw a man
waving at me, so I ran closer to have a look and he was still waving at
me and I thought, that's not my husband!'' Indeed.
I guess the phantom driver thought it just might be his lucky day.

Poet and novelist Ron Butlin lives in Edinburgh with his wife and
their dog. His latest collection of poetry Histories of Desire was
published last month.
MY wife Regi is a very good cook and I am a very good eater. Heralded
throughout the day by way of a toast and tea breakfast, a sandwich with
a virtuous-but-rare yoghurt lunch, and the later afternoon crumpet and
jam, dinner gloriously approaches.
The evening meal is our family meeting place for browsing, sluicing
and talking; Anja -- no longer a dog but all-mouth -- joins in under the
table. I like starters: peppered mackerel, seafood, avocado, olives,
gherkins, spring onions, anything.
The main course provides the centre of gravity: roasts, curries,
gammons, elaborate casseroles, game, sausages.So long as there's meat:
chopped, fried, boiled, minced, spiced, marinated -- for me no meat
means nearly the same as no meal. Sometimes I have a bad conscience but
have learned to live with it.
I've tried to be a veggie but always cautiously enough to be assured
of failure. Regi would prefer a less carnivorous diet and ensures there
is an exotic salad to follow. I rarely eat sweets but enjoy wedges of
home-made fruit tart.
Usually we have red wine, delicious blackberry-tasting Bulgarian is
our favourite.
My between-meals are sensitively catered for by Grosi and Dora who
send illegal parcels of sausages and chocolate from Switzerland. When my
pangs of guilt overcome my digestion I offer to cook.
More a heater-up than a creative culinary force, I manage vastly
over-quantified spaghetti that we struggle to finish off during the
following week.
I once tried a real recipe but when it came to doing something with
flour, which doesn't even look like food, I gave up.The final wriggles
of pasta fed to the dog, Regi takes over again and such are the joys of
domestic feeding we rarely eat out unless at friends'.

Conrad Wilson climbs to the heights of Stirling to discover an
Austrian restaurant which offers substancially more than a Wiener
schnitzel.
THOUGH Mozart's -- and doubtless also Schubert's -- favourite dish was
trout, most of us now associate Viennese cuisine more with Wiener
schnitzel than with the blue fish poached in vinegar and served with
melted butter, which is one of the traditional Austrian methods of
cooking trout.
Schnitzel is as familiar as beefburgers, ''foreign'' in the safest
sense, and thus more inviting than tafelspitz (boiled beef with
horseradish), that other staple of the Viennese table. The assumption,
moreover, is that Austrians cook it with aplomb.
In my experience, however, they do nothing of the kind. The chances
are that you will get an infinitely better schnitzel in Milan, under the
name of scaloppine Milanese, than anywhere in Vienna. Since Austria is
said to have introduced Italy to the idea of veal escalopes fried in
flour, eggs, butter and breadcrumbs, it therefore seems ironic that the
result should look and taste so appetising on one side of the Alps and
so soggily uninviting on the other. But then, apart from sausages,
cakes, and coffee, which can all be wonderful, Austrian cooking is often
really quite depressing.
Why, then, did I look forward to sampling Hermann's at the Tolbooth,
Stirling's recently opened Austrian restaurant? Partly, no doubt,
because of its prime position near the splendid Church of the Holy Rude,
but also because Austrian restaurants are real rarities in Britain, with
a novelty value which, in a town as gastronomically lifeless as
Stirling, can only be worth encouraging. There was, in addition, the
hope that it might actually be good, run by someone not only genuinely
Austrian, but capable of proving that there is more to Austrian cooking
than the ubiquitous schnitzel.
Hermann Aschaber, its proprietor, is certainly Austrian, a proud
Tyrolean from one of the villages around Kitzbuhel, as the decor of his
restaurant proclaims. Though the building's solid stone walls and barred
windows once enclosed Stirling's old courthouse, their stern effect has
been softened with the obligatory alpine addition of pine. Alpine
pictures -- displaying virtuoso skiers on their slopes or more ordinary
people struggling towards the door of a welcoming chalet -- set the new
mood.
The operative word is gemutlich. Hermann's mountain refuge may be no
more than a stop on the climb to Stirling Castle, but on a cold Scottish
night it is surely welcome.
By day, on the other hand, its ambience is cooler and more impersonal.
The premises, before Hermann acquired them, functioned for a while as a
pub, and the conservatory where lunch is served, overlooking a small
courtyard, seems still to be shaking off a history of bar snacks. But
the food undoubtedly has more personality than that. Whether a starter
portion of smoked cheese mousse with redcurrant coulis is preferable to
a ploughman's lunch is perhaps debatable, but the hot sausage platter,
with a dollop of sauerkraut, is as spicy as it should be.
If the touch is lacking delicacy, that is the nature of the cuisine.
The wild mushroom omelette lacks the moist succulence a good French
restaurant would give it, and the platefuls of cold meat come with an
excess of garnish. But the Linzertorte, made on the premises, is a
triumph, authentically nutty and resourcefully light.
The evening menu, which may include venison with a bramble and red
wine sauce, a cheese crepe with cashew nuts, and -- yes -- Wiener
schnitzel, is more elaborate and brings into service a second, perhaps
cosier, dining area near the bar. The wine list ranges far -- rather too
far beyond Hermann's homeland, but it does include one lovely fresh
Austrian Pinot Blanc, or Weissburgunder, from the Neusiedersee region
near the Hungarian border. This and its equivalent red are what to go
for, especially as they are more attractively priced than some of the
other wines.
There is likewise no need to look beyond the charming Swiss wines that
grace the cuisine at the Alp Horn, Edinburgh's long established and
continuingly successful simulation of high Alpine cosiness. Though its
juxtapositions of venison with fruit, veal and spatzli, or avocado with
mustard no longer seem a novelty, the touch remains assured and the
addition to the menu of a page of budget-priced dishes, including rump
steak with parsley butter or a vol-au-vent of seafood, is a special
asset in the evening, when most restaurants in Scotland tend
automatically to double their prices. Otherwise, fondue remains a
convivial favourite and air-dried meat a great treat.
It may take Hermann in Stirling some time to achieve an atmosphere as
seasoned as this, but at least he is trying.

Lady Claire Macdonald can feel only sorrow that some of her guest turn
up their noses at a vegtetable which is at the root of so much of our
culinary heritage.
THERE is always confusion with turnip. For a start, having been born
south of the Border, I could easily refer to turnip as swede. Were I
American, I would call what we think of as turnip Rutabaga.
So whenever turnip features on our menu, which is at least once a
week, it inevitably brings forth questions about its identity, depending
on where our guests are from. I've mentioned that we frequently have
turnip on our menus and we do. This is because I think it is one of the
best of all vegetables.
We cook them by boiling the peeled, hard flesh in salted water till
just tender. After draining off the water, we steam dry the turnip in
the dry saucepan and then whizz them to a velvet-smooth puree in the
food processor, adding butter, cream, salt, plenty of black pepper, and
a grating of nutmeg. We serve fried, slightly salted cashew nuts
scattered over the pureed turnip. I think this is wonderful and luckily,
so do very many of our guests. BUT, during the course of the nine months
we are open as a hotel, we will inevitably get two or three guests who
complain about being served turnip. They feel demeaned by being given
what they consider too lowly a vegetable to be worthy of being eaten.
I always imagine such guests would prefer what I personally despise --
baby sweetcorn. But I have to remind myself that taste is a very
personal thing -- they think I'm wrong to give them turnip and I think
they are mad to complain about something I consider to be delicious!
Hugo, our youngest, loves to crunch on raw turnip. I quite like it
raw, but only quite. But cooked, turnip is versatile, useful in a
surprisingly wide number of dishes, and invaluable in stews because of
its sweetness.
An oxtail stew, for instance, made without turnip really lacks flavour
in my opinion. Turnip retains its cut shape no matter how long a cooking
time it has, and with oxtail it is probably the lengthiest cooking it
will get. Much as I love carrots, for me turnip has far more taste. I
have mentioned it in an oxtail stew but it is just as good in any other
beef or venison stew or casserole, or served as a vegetable with any
meat or game dish.
Apart from being pureed, the other way I cook turnip for our family is
to cut off the skin, and slice the turnip into neat chunks about 1cm in
size. I gently saute some chopped onions till they are soft and just
beginning to turn golden, then I add the turnip. Cook till the bits of
turnip are soft, over gentle to moderate heat and with plenty of black
pepper, salt to your taste and you have a very good vegetable dish. You
do need to stir the cooking turnip, both to prevent it from sticking to
the pan as well as to make sure it cooks evenly.
What you cook it in depends on what you like; either oil, olive or
sunflower, with butter, or dripping from a beef or lamb roast if you
have some. And a non-stick saucepan helps make the washing-up less of a
chore. It may sound almost too basic to be worth mentioning, but cutting
a turnip is hard work, and it is made so much easier if you have a sharp
and heavy knife and a large board -- a lightweight and blunt knife is a
sure way to cut yourself instead of the turnip. I remember how awful I
used to find it in the pre-pumpkin days for Halloween; cutting and
chiselling out a turnip to make turnip was arduous, to say the least!
Turnip is world renowned as the accompaniment for haggis. I can't
think of anything that goes better with haggis than mashed turnip. For
this I don't bother to puree the cooked turnip in a processor, I just
mash it with a potato masher, which leaves it fibrous. But mashed or
pureed turnip is so good with sliced black pudding, and with mince. It
also, when pureed, makes a delicious alternative top for a shepherd's
pie to the more usual mashed potatoes. This is especially good if the
shepherd consists of venison rather than beef or lamb. To get a slightly
contrasting crunchy texture I fry brown breadcrumbs with parsley till
crisp (I use butter in my non-stick saute pan) then scatter this over
the surface of the pureed neeps.
Complementary tastes with turnip, whether in soup or in pureed form,
are ginger and curry. If you like -- and I do -- you can make croutons
and cook medium-strength curry powder in the butter in which the
croutons cook, and serve these scattered over a turnip-based soup, as in
the recipe today. Turnip is an extremely useful vegetable for soup. This
recipe has lentils in as well, and it is a very sustaining soup --
perfect for a cold winter's day. If you serve croutons with the soup I
think bread or rolls are really superfluous to requirement, but it
depends on the appetites of those eating the soup!
Turnip and Lentil Soup
Serves 6
1[1/2] pints good stock, chicken, ham, or vegetable
3 tablespoons sunflower oil and 1oz butter
2 onions, skinned and chopped
1 turnip, peeled and chopped
4oz lentils -- the orange lentils
1 stick of celery, washed and trimmed and sliced
1 leek, washed and trimmed and sliced
salt, pepper to your taste
1-2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
Heat the oil and gently saute the onions till they are soft and just
beginning to turn golden. Add the celery, leek and chopped turnip. Cook
for a few minutes then stir in the lentils and the stock. Simmer gently
for 20 minutes, the pan half covered with a lid. Squash a piece of
turnip against the side of the pan with the back of your wooden spoon to
check that it is cooked. Cool the soup a bit, then liquidise it till
smooth. Taste, and season with salt and pepper. Reheat before serving,
and just before ladling it into soup plates or bowls, stir the chopped
parsley through the soup -- this lifts its appearance as well as adding
flavour, but beware adding the parsley too soon as it loses its bright
fresh colour and taste if it sits for any length of time in the hot
soup.

Michael Fry enjoys a no-nonsense approach to good food
CATHERINE Brown's book on Scottish cookery, a standard almost from the
day of its first publication 10 years ago, has come out in paperback at
a very reasonable price. In most respects it even supersedes the
pioneering classic of Marian McNeill, now three-quarters of a century
old, and certainly outdoes the paler imitations which appeared in
between.
Perhaps one fault common to them all, in the absence of a historically
distinguished gastronomy, is a tendency to dwell on picturesque lore,
not much good for the modern cook. It is hard to forget Mrs McNeill's
tip for haggis, that when boiling up the sheep's innards you should
leave the windpipe hanging over the edge of the pot ''to permit
discharge of impurities.''
Catherine Brown actually gives the same advice, though she concedes
that this method of preparation is unappealing. She offers the old
recipe for those who really want it, but the tenor of her remarks is
that the volume and variety of haggis available from good butchers are
such as to make a messy task redundant for everyone except the most
determined patriots. Then she gets on with novel and useful ideas for
serving the stuff -- the eternal garnish of neeps and tatties can, after
all, be a bit monotonous.
This is typical of a no-nonsense approach which, without extravagance,
will allow you to make dishes as delicious as your granny used to, or
sometimes still better by the application of modern international
techniques. Thus, porridge can nowadays be enlivened with Greek natural
yoghurt, while oatmeal can also produce a version of the delicious
sourdough bread eaten in America, and a Scots muesli can excel a Swiss
one.
The book complains, quite rightly, that we make far too little use of
the beautiful fish from Scottish waters. None of the recipes will really
frighten an unadventurous palate, though Orkney squid sounds almost a
contradiction in terms. For the bold there are suggestions on how to
cook limpets, spoots and seaweed. I missed a recipe for the delicious
shoulder of lamb stuffed with oysters that I once consumed at one
sitting, but a dulse broth with mutton must be just as good.
Game is another resource of which many Scots are absurdly scared, even
though it comes cheaper here than in any country I have been. What is
more, it is a pure product of nature, lean on account of the agility
needed to escape predators, and by definition free of additives.
Catherine Brown has especially tempting recipes for venison.
I could go on, but my advice is just to buy this excellent volume.
From baking to sweeties, the author includes everything Scots are known
to like, while opening up new vistas of taste which require of the home
cook only a minimum of extra time and trouble. It would be nice, too, if
our many mediocre restaurants took several leaves out of Catherine
Brown's book, and started offering their customers a real taste of
Scotland.

IF there's one thing I learned at the recent launch of Whirlpool's new
range of built-in ovens, it's this: the Trophy Room at Ibrox Park is
really interesting.
Seriously. If you'd asked me before the launch, I would have said that
football trophies were all much of a muchness: big silver cups with
fancy handles and twirly bits on top.
Now I know better because that room was just stuffed with rearing
horses, Chinese ginger jars, royal Copenhagen maidens, jewel-encrusted
brass lamps, mini totem poles, stags' heads and even a full-size
push-bike, for heaven's sake -- and every one of them a football trophy,
apparently.
So what were Whirlpool doing launching their new ovens at Ibrox? Good
question.
The point is, you see, that the event was being staged, not for the
customers (mainly female) who buy ovens, but for the people (mainly men)
who sell the things. The theory goes that most men like football -- so
why not show off the new product at Scotland's premier football ground?
And it worked. The company said they'd never experienced such a
successful launch. Hundreds of eager salesmen poured into Ibrox for a
tour of the premises (including the visitors' blue-tiled shower room and
the hallowed pitch itself), a slap-up buffet washed down with Rangers'
own label Vin de Table plus a glimpse of Ian Ferguson who appeared
briefly to draw the raffle.
And then there were the goodie bags featuring an extra-large size
black T-shirt with the Whirlpool logo, a dinky LCD alarm clock, one
novelty keyring and a copy of Oven 95 -- the video.
A night to remember? I'll say!
Yes, but what about those ovens? Well, they're splendid. I was
particularly taken with the top of the range Chef d'Europe model (#799)
which comes ready programmed with 100 recipes. Sadly, this doesn't mean
that the oven makes the food for you but it does tell you what
temperature to cook it at, what shelf to place it on, and how long you
should keep it in for.
I told group trade marketing manager, Richard Thompson, that when my
free-standing English Electric Rapide 58 (circa 1975) finally packs in,
I might even consider buying one myself.
* Tours of Ibrox Stadium, including the Trophy Room, take place every
Sunday from 9.45am to 4.30pm. For a booking form, phone public relations

LIKE many topers whose memories go back to the sixties - and a little
earlier in my own case - Stephen Brook first made his acquaintance with
the name Sauternes on the labels of cheap sweet Spanish offerings. In
Glasgow at any rate this wine was widely offered in the first generation
of curry shops.
It was abominable and certainly nothing even remotely like the great
drink whose name it purloined. It is the real thing which is the subject
of Brook's book which is a model of its kind, a constant stimulus and a
pleasure to read.
Possibly only reviewers and enthusiasts will read it through at one
go, for it also doubles for tourists and wine-loving visitors as a
reference book and informed guide to where to live, and especially where
to eat, in the Sauternais. It also deals with the wines in considerable
detail with a point of view which is formidably informed, always
critical, but basically sympathetic to the growers and makers,
especially those who have to cope with the problems of the smaller
estates.
A good example of his critical stance is in his consideration of
Chateau Gilette, a legendary wine - ''the most bizarre Sauternes of them
all,'' says Brook - which undergoes very long maturation in concrete
vats before being released to delight. Brook cannot see the point of the
very long maturation, and has the self confidence to make his own
opinions about how it might be made clear; and he gives Gilette the high
marks it deserves.
Confident, yes, but never over-assertive, as is evident in his
treatment of chaptalisation - adding sugar to wine to boost its alcohol.
On balance he does not like the idea but recognises how necessary it is
for some growers, especially smaller ones, and on some occasions when
its use counters nature's climatological failings.
Sauternes is a great sweet wine made in five parishes about 25 miles
south of Bordeaux. He analyses the soil structure of each parish,
identifies the main grapes used and shows how the wine is made. At one
point he says: '' Sauternes, more than any other wine, is made in the
vineyard.''
This is because the grapes have to be rotten before they are pressed
and have to be picked in several passages through the vines rather than
all at once as is normal elsewhere. The rot is essential to the wine's
success for it dehydrates the grape (so that it looks vile!) and
concentrates all its vital characteristics including its sugars. The
picking is mostly of rot-affected bunches of grapes - Brook's sceptical
nature queries the often mentioned picking of individual grapes - and
this process, as well as the low yields helps account for the cost of
the wine. Good Sauternes in never cheap, the best is dear and the very
best extremely dear.
The greatest of the wines, and the only Premier Grand Cru, Chateau
d'Yquem, gets a chapter to itself, in which he notes that it is an
acquired taste. He does list and assess all the other famous names -
fortunately none is nearly as expensive as Yquem. He establishes their
varying characteristics - and they do differ significantly - and their
qualities in different vintages. (About vintages generally he has a
separate chapter, dealing in most detail with the years since 1967.)
This book has all the felicity of the wine it describes, and does not
ignore complexities, but explains them. It will be obligatory reading
for those who use Sauternes as an aperitif, or as an accompaniment at
dinner to rich dishes, like foie gras, or as a post prandial drink. (He
has a chapter on how the wine should be served as well as how it should
be kept.) Its paperback price is less than most bottles of the wine
whose many charms it celebrates with a combination of scholarship and
enthusiasm.

Manchester I bought this blooming carpet that is so thick that it comes
up through my feet. It's got a big heart shape with a circle round it
and walking on it is like walking on the surface of the sun. Having been
designed in Sweden, made in India, bought in Manchester and ended up in
Gourock I like to think of it as my very international carpet. I walk on

DISCREET ARRANGEMENTS
THE phrase, ''Sir Walter Scott's Abbotsford -- the house he built and
lived in'', from the advertising blurb seems rather an understatement
for his large and impressive home overlooking the Tweed, set in
undulating pasture land with sweeping views of the surrounding hills and
the woodlands planted by Scott in his lifetime.
All the ground-floor rooms of the house are on view to the public in
the summer, apart from the private rooms in one wing of the house which
are occupied by Scott's two great-great-granddaughters.
Dame Jean Maxwell-Scott has, among other things, the task of keeping
these rooms filled with flowers. On the day we met she had filled the
rooms with the last of the summer annuals and was bemoaning the onset of
autumn.
''I enjoy flowers and am fortunate to have access to an enormous
walled garden and one of the best gardeners in the country, whose family
connection spans almost a century. It makes flower arranging much
simpler for me. This is a country home and I suppose my style of
arranging reflects this.''
The sun was shining through the long stained-glass windows of the
entrance hall as we spoke, reflecting amber and gold lozenges of light
on the stone floor. That, I decided, was the colour scheme to follow for
a flower arrangement in the hall.
Any flowers would have to be large and bold with strong lines of
foliage not to be lost in the magnificence of the surroundings.
The focal point of the hall is the stone fireplace -- a copy of a
stall in the cloisters of Melrose Abbey -- with a basket grate which
once belonged to Archbishop Sharp, murdered in 1679. A biscuit tin was
unearthed from the kitchens to fit inside the grate and two large soaked
oasis blocks were wedged firmly inside -- one across the tin and the
other standing vertically behind it. Oasis tape was wound around the
oasis and tin to hold it firmly.
To make a similar autumn display for an empty fireplace or an alcove
in your own home, the procedure is exactly the same once you have fixed
the oasis is a suitable container -- a shallow flan dish is ideal.
Simply use smaller blooms and less of them, with shorter lengths of
greenery.
You will need -- Foliage: beech and rowan; hosta leaves; large and
small-leafed variegated ivy. Flowers: large single chrysanths; dahlias;
roses.
Cut three well-shaped sprays of beech to fit the alcove. Insert one to
the back of the oasis and the others to the sides, allowing them to
trail forwards or downwards. Add shorter sprays of rowan and
large-leafed ivy, keeping within the outline and bringing some foliage
forwards to avoid a flat one-dimensional look.
Only when you are satisfied with the foliage shape, is it time to add
the flowers. The secret of flower arranging is to imagine a central
point within the oasis and insert the flowers with all the stems
pointing towards it.
Remove all the foliage from the chrysanthemums. The leaves of
chrysanths die before the flowers and give off bacteria which shortens
the life of the plants. It is quite common to see offensive, decaying
foliage on a vase of otherwise perfectly healthy blooms.
Add the larger, brighter colours of chrysanths to the centre of the
arrangement and the smaller heads to the top and sides, following the
outline of foliage. Insert the dahlias and roses within this outline,
varying the length of stems so that some are recessed to give depth.
Insert three or four large hosta leaves to the centre, this helps to
pull the arrangement together and hide the stems. Finally, add a few
trails of small-leafed ivy to add lightness and soften the front edge of
the display.

5pm, Sundays 2-5pm. It reopens in March. Tel: 01896 752043.

HOME IS WHERE THE ART IS
The threads of a successful business have been skillfully pulled
together by tapestry expert Emma Jo Webster. Ann Donald joins her in her
studio to see, among other works, a tribute to The King of Rock 'n'
Roll.
Bursting out of cupboards and drawers are a panoply of wools, linen
threads, lurex, silk and cotton in all the colours and shades a Dulux
paint wall chart could possibly cover.
EMMA Jo Webster believes ''most people in the seventies thought that
tapestries were brown and orange hairy monsters.'' For many years this
art form was indeed dealt a bad press, thought to be the exclusive
terrain of ethereal ex-hippy types you'd encounter at summer solstice
fairs selling crudely fashioned brown and orange wool monstrosities.
Thanks to artists like Webster, with her own decidedly non hairy
monster-like discipline of tapestry design, this is no longer the case.
In her tiny studio, no bigger than a box room, in the West End of
Glasgow, the 28-year-old Edinburgh College of Art graduate has managed
to cram in the tools of her trade. An industrial-sized loom composed of
four serious tubes of steel scaffolding, hint at the beginnings of a new
piece of work, while bursting out of Mother Hubbard-sized cupboards and
drawers are a panoply of wools, linen threads, lurex, silk and cotton in
all the colours and shades a Dulux paint wall chart could possibly
cover.
Small wooden school desks are covered with jars of paintbrushes.
Bottles of blue, pink and yellow poster paints, pens, pencils and tiny
hanks of multi-coloured tangled linen threads take up every centimetre
of available space. Elsewhere photographs of friends, a TV, a sink and a
healthy number of newspaper cuttings about ''good friend'' madcap
comedian Phil Kay, decorate this hive of industrious artistic activity
where Elvis was, in fact, created.
Yes, that's right. The King once honoured this very studio with his
presence. In fact it was a postcard of a magnificent tapestry Webster
made as a tribute to her rock'n'roll idol that first alerted this
journalist to the artist's original work. Unfortunately Elvis is on tour
at the moment as part of the 62 Embroidery Group exhibition, but he will
return home at Christmas for some well-earned R&amp;R (rest and
recuperation).
Titled Los Recuerdos Dulces Del Rey (The Sweet Memory of The King),
the singer has been captured just before that unfortunate blubbery Las
Vegas period as he croons in a pink lurex suit and mohair, a little
tubby perhaps but the sideburns and facial expression are caught in
perfect detail while framed against a blood-red background and a
glittery gold star twinkling beside the woven latin title.
Elvis is only one example of Webster's colourful and vibrant work
which appears to move like an animated illustration as the eye skims
over each undulating shape, be it figurative or abstract, of each
section of the tapestry. In fact, not one of the very painterly works,
can be faulted in possessing a flat uninteresting area, since tiny
flecks of colour rise out of the most unexpected places.
This special quality can, according to Webster, be traced back to the
influence of her grandfather, the Cubist stained-glass artist Gordon
Webster. As a child, she spent hours working with him in his studio
helping to assemble the hundreds of minute pieces that composed the
challenging ''glass jigsaw puzzles''. ''My job,'' she explains, ''was to
lay out each bit of numbered glass on to its exact place on the
plan/cartoon lying on the table. You could stand there for 20 minutes
puzzling it out.'' Not only did this unusual weekend pastime bequeath
the young Webster with an eye for detail but it also gifted her a
lifelong passion and wonder for colour and the way in which light can
affect the quality of colour.
''What totally fascinates me is trying to get light to work for my
tapestries in the same way as medieval stained glass,'' she says.
''Because textiles absorb light in a different way to everything else, I
like to try out the effects of using linen or silk instead of always
wool.'' In the same way, having observed the ''huge flat slabs of very
dead and boring'' stained glass that she cites as having been
fashionable in the 1820s, Webster instinctively knew that her tapestries
would have to incorporate what she describes as ''those tiny wee flecks
of colour that make a piece move and sing'' to counteract any lingering
flatness.
The two works hanging on her studio wall not only testify to this but
also her obvious love of the latin which she incorporates into the
titles of most of her work. Regarding this use of the ancient language
she notes: ''I like it because it's so magical and contains many
subtleties and nuances of meaning.'' Sic Itur Ad Astra (This is the way
to the stars) is a wonderfully buoyant and colourful piece predominantly
in hues of blues and green, that marries the figurative with the
abstract in portraying a female figure who gazes out of the work
directly at the viewer, wondering whether to pursue the ''yellow brick
road'' of choppy waves and yellow stars that lie dauntingly in front of
her.
While the 6ft by 4ft Persta Et Obdura (persist and endure) is a
testament of tapestry's power to convey a whirlwind of motion as it
portrays a delicately defined face being squeezed by the purples, golds
and reds encompassing it in a maelstrom of kinetic energy. And above the
anxious face, as if carved in ancient gold lettering, is the latin title
standing obstinately in the face of adversity.
As with many of Webster's works, the tapestries tell a personal story.
Referring to the former, she says: ''That was all about me leaving
college in 1989 and setting up in business, while Persist and Endure is
all about me being pressurised by the negative side of business and
telling myself never to give up whatever the demands are.''
Thankfully those rocky salad days have receded into the background and
the tapestry designer is now swamped with so many private and public
commissions, that she has little time to exhibit. ''I love what I do,''
she enthuses. ''I love the challenge of researching a private
commission, spending time with someone and getting to know them and
working in to a tapestry those symbols or aspects of their life that
have been important to them.''
As for tapestry design itself, the vivacious Webster is at odds to
understand why anyone could contemplate defining her chosen art as
boring. ''People ask me that all the time,'' she says somewhat
perplexed. ''There's no way it's boring because with weaving you don't
just go across in straight lines, you're weaving shapes and building up
every little different bit with colours, with effects of luminosity, or
using different warps for detail. The weaving itself is basic, it's what
you do with it that matters,'' she adds defiantly.

SHIPYARD WELDER
Men moving along tunnels run a gauntlet of sparks flashing from
compartments where hooded figures are crouched over cold blue flames.
It's a dark, dank, dirty job - but the Clyde yards are full of men
glad to do it. Gavin Bell joins them in the bowels of a ship.
IT is still dark when the small army of men troops board the ship.
Their heads are bowed, and their collars are turned up against a chill
wind whipping across the slate-grey waters of the river.
At first there is only the tramp of feet, an occasional greeting, and
the clatter of tools being assembled. Then it begins, hesitantly at
first then with growing stridency: the ding-dong of hammers, the hissing
of welding torches, the scream of grinding machines, and a host of other
indefinable bangings and clangings, a cacophony familiar to generations
of Glaswegians as the song of the Clyde.
In a compartment below decks, a man in dark overalls is silhouetted
against a shower of sparks cascading from a watertight door. He is
working in a confined space, and soon it is filled with acrid fumes.
After a while he switches off his grinder, removes his breathing mask,
and wipes grime from his face. ''It's a manky job this,'' he says.
Alan Britton should know, because he's been doing it for nearly 20
years. A welder to trade, he began working in a Govan shipyard soon
after leaving school at the age of 16, and he expects to be doing the
same job until he retires -- if he's lucky.
''It's no' a nice industry tae work in,'' he says. ''It's hard and
dirty, and ye'll never be rich. But it's a steady job.'' The last point
is of paramount importance in an area that has seen its lifeblood of
shipbuilding drain inexorably away. An old-timer in the yard says when
he was a boy you could sail down the Clyde and hear ships being built
all the way to Greenock. Now about all you hear is the seagulls.
It's true. Once there were more than 60 yards on Clydeside producing a
sixth of the world's tonnage of shipping, and now only three are left.
So Alan is one of the lucky ones. ''When I left school they used to
start a hundred apprentices in the summer and a hundred at Christmas.
Now you hardly see an apprentice in the yard. We used to have about 9000
men here, now there's no' much more than a thousand.''
The fact that there are any at all is due to the takeover of the
ailing British Shipbuilders' facility, formerly Fairfields, by the
Norwegian company Kvaerner seven years ago. At the cost of slashing the
workforce, and by introducing new construction techniques and flexibile
working practices, the yard has survived in an increasingly competitive
marketplace dominated by the Japanese and Koreans.
One of the biggest improvements is an assembly shop, which looks like
a giant aircraft hangar, where ships are put together in massive
sections rather than piece by piece out of doors. Jamie Webster, the
boilermakers' convenor, says: ''If they hadn't built that, we'd have
gone under. We've improved our performance beyond all recognition, but
we had to.''
Alan agrees, but regrets the price they had to pay: ''We'd rather have
kept the jobs, but in reality it wasn't going to happen. We had to
change to survive.'' In Alan's case, change meant learning new skills.
He points to the door he has been welding and says: ''In the old days,
somebody else would dress it and take away the scars, then the welder
would come back and fill in the holes. Now I do everything except paint
it. But the changes have worked out good for the yard, they've kept us
in work.''
The rewards of such flexibility include the ship he is working on, HMS
Ocean, a #149m helicopter assault vessel being built for the Royal Navy.
Half-completed, she is moored in what is still known as Fairfield's
Basin, festooned with hundreds of power cables trailing from her sides
to the dock. It is as if she has been tied down by the tiny figures
swarming over her, like a maritime version of Gulliver in Lilliput.
In the maze of gunmetal grey and rust red corridors inside her, the
scene is more reminiscent of an Indiana Jones movie. There are tangled
masses of cables everywhere, curling out of dark holes in the floors and
ceilings like serpents; disembodied hands and feet wriggle from
portholes and hatches; men moving along tunnels run a gauntlet of sparks
flashing from compartments where hooded figures are crouched over cold
blue flames; unnerving sounds of hissing and hammering punctuate a
steady hum of machinery from somewhere in the depths of the ship; neon
lights illuminate mysterious hieroglyphics on the bulkheads, arrows and
crosses and cryptic messages: ''48 holes APV'', ''signals cable
penetration''. One half-expects to see a sign above an arrow saying:
''Temple of Doom this way.''
In fact, what one sees are prosaic signs indicating emergency exits.
Alan points out that they are luminous, so that they may be seen in the
event of a general power failure. ''That's another thing we didn't have
in the old days,'' he says.
Safety is an important consideration in what has always been a
hazardous industry. When the Govan yard was acquired by Kvaerner in
1988, its accident rate was five times worse than any in the Norwegian
company. It now has the best safety record of all of them.
According to Benny McGoogan, the health and safety manager, the
improvement is due in part to most of the work taking place in the dry
and relatively warm conditions of the assembly shop, rather than in
sub-zero temperatures and howling winter gales on the river.
Alan says HMS Ocean is a relatively safe ship. ''It's no' like the
bulk carriers that have 60 foot holes ye can fall through, this one's a'
decks.'' You take his word for it, but walk carefully along a narrow
gangway on the flight deck where only a scaffolding rail surrounds the
cavernous main hold which looks at least 60ft deep.
''Ye've got tae watch your eyes and your skin are protected,'' he
says. He demonstrates the point by donning goggles and a breathing mask,
and enveloping himself in a dark hood and heavy industrial gloves, to
work on the door with a grinder. As the sparks begin to fly, surrounding
him in a glittering curtain of fire, he looks as if he is engaged in a
chemical warfare project.
''I've been quite lucky,'' he says. ''Just a few wee cuts and eye
injuries.'' But he knew at least one man who died after a fall, and
another who has been in hospital for a year since a similar accident. As
if on cue, a man passing us snags his foot on a cable, stumbles, and
curses succinctly. ''Ye cannae be too careful,'' Alan says.
Big ships are magic places, even while they are being built. One
senses life beginning to course through HMS Ocean, a week after her
launch, as if she was responding to the feel of the Clyde on her hull
and the movement of men. It is easy to imagine her in tropic climes,
with sailors and airmen in smart uniforms strolling across her decks, or
perhaps running in response to a call to arms.
Alan has no time for such romantic illusions. He is here to do a job
of work, not to indulge in daydreams. ''The ships don't really mean
anything to me. We've built that many over the years. It's just a job,
it's work.'' He takes no particular pride in what he does, but he does
it as best as he can. ''Ye have to do a good job. Ye cannae do a bad job
and just walk away from it.''
In an industry which still requires men to work in dirty and
potentially dangerous conditions in foul weather, companionship is
important. Without it, Alan says, the job would be hard to tolerate.
''The company's good, ye get a good laugh with your mates. That's the
only thing that keeps ye going. Apart from the money, of course.''
The rough humour of Clydeside is legendary, and the tradition is
maintained by the workforce at Kvaerner. The greetings, the taunts and
the wisecracks fly thick and fast. Everybody's a Billy Connolly and the
gaunt shell of HMS Ocean is their stage. Alan is a Rangers supporter,
and during a tea-break he is ribbed mercilessly about the team's
drubbing by Juventus of Turin the night before. ''Yer team's pasta its
best,'' is one of the less ribald comments.
A season ticket at Ibrox is one of Alan's few luxuries. He goes to
every Rangers game except European ties, which he can't afford, and he
has a few drinks in his local pub on Saturday nights. If there's any
money left over at the end of the week, he and his wife will go out for
a meal on Sundays.
With his wife working part-time in a whisky bond, they have taken a
mortgage on a small flat. They managed two weeks in Benidorm with their
eight-year-old daughter this year, but had to take out a loan for it
which they're still paying off. ''Ye cannae think far ahead on what we
earn,'' Alan says. ''Ye just live from week to week.''
On reflection, he reckons he has not a bad life although it could have
been better. When he goes straight from the yard to a midweek football
match, he is aware of being grubby compared with friends who have come
from offices. ''Sometimes I think it would be good to have clean work in
an office, but there's no point in bothering about it. I don't have the
qualifications.''
When he left school, almost everybody he knew worked in shipyards.
Welders were relatively well paid, and he was glad to be taken on as an
apprentice. ''In those days the welder was the main man in the yards. It
was the choice I made at the time.''
So he carries on walking a couple of miles to the shipyard on workdays
at a time when most people are just beginning to stir from their beds.
He enjoys the walk, and looks forward to a cuppa and a chat with his
mates before they start work.
Asked if he expects to be in the yard until he retires, he says: ''If
the orders keep coming in, it wouldnae surprise me. There's no' many
other jobs.''

SOMETIMES you come across a novel which makes your heart skip a beat
when you suddenly spy it in a book shop. It will be a new work from a
favourite author and you will have to have it -- there and then.
And then you will take it home, place it on the bookshelf . . . and
you will leave it there. There will be a curious reluctance to start it
because, once you do, it then becomes only a matter of time before you
arrive at its end. And then the pleasure has gone; only the joyful
memory remains. So instead you tease yourself, waiting for that
wonderful moment when you determine that the time is finally right to
cast your eyes upon chapter one. And then read on.
Larry McMurtry's latest Western is a classic case in point.
''Prequel'' is a horrible word. Invented, one suspects, by Hollywood for
follow-up movies which take you back instead of forward. Still, they do
have one advantage. At least you can rest easy in the full knowledge
that your hero is going to survive.
We have met Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call before. First in the
wonderful Lonesome Dove, as the ageing and ornery Texas Rangers who
embarked upon that epic and fateful cattle drive from the Lone Star
state to Montana. Then came the sequel, The Streets of Laredo. With Gus
gone and Call a pale shadow of his former self, the spotlight fell
instead upon ol' Pea Eye Parker, the pair's trusted lieutenant.
Now McMurtry takes us back to the early years, a time when the Alamo
was still within the bounds of living memory and Texas stood alone as a
proud republic. Gus and Call are tenderfoot Rangers, young bucks with
the bounding energy of youth and the touching innocence of inexperience.
Together they volunteer to join the forces of Caleb Cobb, a legendary
land pirate of dubious provenance, who sets off on a foolhardy
expedition to capture Santa Fe from the clutches of the Mexicans. It is
Gus and Call's excellent adventure.
Here they come face to face with the great Comanche war chief, Buffalo
Hump, a savage man the likes of which you would not wish to meet on a
dark night. Fierce and merciless, he stalks the white man -- before
dispatching him to oblivion with the most cruel and unusual punishments.
Murder for him is an opportunity to stretch the imagination. Like some
supernatural demon he lurks behind every page -- appearing silently,
then slaying, then vanishing.
In Dead Man's Walk, the author paints a broad and sweeping canvas. The
literary landscape is truly wondrous to survey. He writes simply and yet
elegantly, capturing the spirit of the Old West's great pioneers in
every word of every sentence. Old friends return. We witness the first
meeting between Gus and Clara, the passionate flame which is to light
his entire adult life. She is little more than an outspoken child,
running her father's store in Austin. Yet Gus, still a teenager himself,
becomes instantly infatuated by her. And then there is a fleeting
appearance from the young Charlie Goodnight, later to come to prominence
in Streets of Laredo.
But there are also McMurtry's new creations, colourful characters like
Matilda Roberts, the biggest whore in the West, and Bigfoot Wallace, the
famous hawk-eyed scout. Above all else, Dead Man's Walk is an
old-fashioned adventure yarn. A compelling tale of hard men and hard
times. The good, the bad, and the just plain evil.
As a literary genre in this modern age, the Western is fast becoming a
thing of the past. And that is sad (and slightly curious given that
Hollywood has re-discovered the cowboy). McMurtry is one of the few
writers who, in between his contemporary work, cussedly continues to
ride the range. We should treasure his devotion to times long gone. He
is a natural storyteller with the power to touch the soul and make the
heart race (not to mention skip a beat). This is the kind of book which
makes reading a sheer delight.

LIFE ON THE RUSSIAN COUNTRY ESTATE
Priscilla Roosevelt
Yale University Press, #30
AT the beginning of the seventeenth century, Peter the Great, ruthless
son of Alexis the Gentle, pledged his soul to lead his empire out of its
medieval primitivism and into the modern world. The reason for such zeal
was Peter's first trip to Europe in 1697 when, free of Moscow's
barbarity, he was utterly captivated by the refinement of western
architecture, scholarship and manners.
Moscow itself had long dazzled foreign voyagers with the gold onion
domes of its churches and the flaming walls and buildings of the
Kremlin. But beyond that, the Russian capital resembled nothing so much
as pillaged territory, its raw, prefabricated wooden buildings regularly
turned into infernos by a wind-borne spark, and even its nobility
ignorant of any semblance of politesse.
So the sophisticated tastes of Germany, Holland and England stunned
that wayward entourage of Peter's, just as its odd appearance and
behaviour appalled its hosts. Following a three-month occupancy of an
English suburban villa, called Sayes Court, the Russians left the place
in such devastation the outraged owner, John Evelyn, demanded vast sums
of money in recompense.
But vanity combined with autocratic rule is a wondrous transformer.
Once back on home ground Peter insisted his courtiers adopt the caprices
of western taste. They were told where to live, how to behave, what to
wear. They were obliged to build masonry houses of prescribed design, to
devise heraldic coats of arms, to shave off their beards, and shed
oriental caftans for clothes inspired by Paris.
Eventually it would be St Petersburg, not Moscow, that would rise as
the tabernacle to Peter's new sacred vision: St Petersburg conjured,
like Venice, out of a swamp by the finest architects and artists that
Europe could offer. And as rulers changed and generations developed and
matured this implanted sense of style, the Russian country estate
emerged with its own brand of art and craft decoration, its follies and
fantasies, its spirit of intellectual vigour, political and social
reform.
The 1917 revolution tore down many of the walls surrounding such
cultural family homes but now for the first time, in both the east and
the west, there has appeared a study of such bright eloquence and detail
that many of the lost, great manor houses of Russia suddenly become like
humming hives. Priscilla Roosevelt's Life on the Russian Country Estate
is a piece of graceful erudition, faultless in its vivid prose and
evocative illustrations recalling the playfulness as well as the
melancholy of the Russian pastoral scene.
Between 1750 and 1800, when Catherine the Great was using architecture
to create her ideological worlds, the Scottish architect, Charles
Cameron, was emerging as a maestro of neo-Gothic. Cameron, in fact,
became one of the most significant figures in the empress's
distinguished architectural troupe commissioned to create the model
estate of Pavlosk for her son.
By the nineteenth century the country estate had become in many cases
the everyday experience of the Russian litterateur. Gogol, Chekov,
Pushkin, Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky were just some of the writers
who observed first-hand the power of privileged living: the aristocratic
master with his legions of serfs.
''Dostoevsky's empathy with the peasants because of his father's harsh
treatment of them, and his admiration of their humane, moral qualities,
may have sown the seeds of both his early liberalism and his later
devotion to Orthodoxy and pan-Slavism,'' notes Roosevelt. Turgenev's
liberal conscience, she reflects, was undoubtedly awakened by the sight
of his tyrannical mother destroying what he called the peaceful ''nests
of gentlefolk'' by her irrational punishing of servants.
In view of the many cruelties inflicted on serfs, is any of this
gilded social history worth celebrating? Roosevelt's expansive text
contains many references to honourable behaviour by aristocrats towards
the poor but she maintains that re-assembling an image of the vanished
life within these most imposing dachas is vital if Russians are to
reclaim their burgled heritage.
However her book also includes a cautionary painting by Maximov, now
in Moscow's Tretiakov Gallery. It is 1889, the serfs have been
emancipated for 25 years, and a haughty but decrepit noblewoman sits
with her old maid outside the servant's cottage which the mistress is
now obliged to share. In the background the empty, ancestral house is
fading like a spectre.
''The fury to build is a diabolical thing; it devours money, and the
more one builds, the more one wants to build; it is as intoxicating as
drink.'' Catherine the Great said that, and 250 years later it neatly
summarises the material lust of those New Russians who now maim the
forests with their crude, rich temples to themselves. One thing is sure:
either as the real thing or a reproductiom, Maximov's telling canvas
will never adorn their walls.

MICHELANGELO: A Biography
George Bull
Viking, #25
WHEN in Rome do what the Romans do. Look at Michelangelo's cupola on
St Peter's and wonder about worship and step inside the Sistine Chapel
to look up at heaven made on earth by Michelangelo and look foward to
the last judgment of faith in a fresco on an altar wall which features
Michelangelo himself as a flayed face under the critical gaze of Christ.
Some -- having seen the movie The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965) with
tall, hunky Chuck Heston playing small, chunky Michelangelo -- suppose
the artist sacrificed himself on the altar of his own attitude but most
know better than to believe the film's image of a creative God who
failed to save himself.
Think of an image of a God and you think of Michelangelo up there on
the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Come to think of it, most folk who
think about fine art think of Michelangelo as the most Godlike of
creators. Yeats thought of him ''on that scaffolding'' with his mind on
higher matters than the surface he was staring at. An old stonemason
mate of mine, who professed to have no interest in aesthetics, admitted
he felt stunned and pleasantly stoned out of his mind when he saw the
marble statue of Michelangelo's David in Florence.
Michelangelo thought of himself as a spiritual artist whose works of
art were acts of faith not commercially conceived artefacts. To one who
addressed him as The Sculptor Michelangelo, he replied: ''I have never
been painter or sculptor, in the sense of having kept a shop . . .
though I have served the popes; but this I did under compulsion.'' In
his own mind what mattered to him was making art more than an illusion.
If you drew a graph of the technical development of art, it would
curve upwards to a high point at the High Renaissance then drop
downwards into a gentle decline. After Michelangelo made his glorious
marks on the world, technical standards were never the same though
imaginative efforts persisted.
Picasso's neo-classical paintings crudely caricature Michelangelo's
monumental style, Leger's linear compositions poorly parody
Michelangelo's muscular figures. Michelangelo was recognised in his time
(1475-1564) as the master of art and remained the talk of the cultured
classes.
Talking of Michelangelo, Vasari called him ''utterly immortal'' and
other contemporaries deified him as divine. Lorenzo the Magnificent
thought young Michelangelo magnificent enough to be patronised and Pope
Julius II thought him special enough to paint the Sistine Ceiling.
Yet the master was more than a painter -- so good a sculptor that an
enraged rival broke his nose with a swift blow and so rearranged the
architecture of his face. So good an architect that, with no
professional training, he displayed what George Bull praises as
''stupendous originality and competence''. So good a poet he was
compared to Dante and composed confessional verse suggesting more than
mere self-indulgence: ''It was here that my love took my heart in his
pity . .. It was here that his love promised help with his beautiful
eyes, which then withdrew it.'' He was possibly thinking of Gherardo
Perini.
According to Bull, Perini was a main man in Michelangelo's life: ''Was
there someone who had had on him the effect he anguishedly described?
Perini was the cause of Michelangelo's first documented ''presentation''
drawing. Whatever happened between them, he may also have inspired
(some) verse. About the time Perini faded from his life, Michelangelo
formed another warm but different, and professional, kind of
relationship with the sixteen-year-old Antonio Mini . . . '' Ostensibly,
Mini was Michelangelo's assistant but may have been another main man.
Around 1530 Michelangelo replaced Mini with another assistant,
Francesco d'Amadore known as Urbino, and was then ''introduced to and
captivated by the nobly born young Roman, Tommaso de' Cavalieri''. You
get the picture if complicated by Michelangelo's relationship with a
woman, Vittoria Colonna, and Bull's comment that his ''friendships . . .
with the well-born Tommaso de' Cavalieri and the noble Vittoria Colonna,
were in contrasting ways love affairs, and he loved his servant Urbino
like a father.''
If Michelangelo was gay he was sad at the time. He had everything
except everyday, and every night, happiness: an admirer reminded him
''not to go about at night and to abandon practices harmful to mind and
body -- so that they may not harm the soul.'' Michelangelo agonised over
his art, despaired of the artistic pressure applied to him by admirers,
distressed himself by thinking of the demands of the seven popes he
served. He served the popes well and probably saved his soul in the
process.
Bull certainly thinks so. In 1512, when the scaffolding in the Sistine
Chapel was taken down, Pope Julius wanted the ceiling retouched with
gold. Michelangelo wanted it left as it was. Julius, talking to
Michelangelo, said: ''It must still be necessary to have it retouched
with gold.''
Michelangelo, talking familiarly to the pope, said: ''I do not see
that men should wear gold.'' And the pope replied: ''It will look
poor.'' And Michelangelo replied: ''Those who are painted here were poor
themselves.'' Michelangelo spoke for himself and won the day and indeed
the century. Bull is best retelling such anecdotes.
When he contemplates the art of Michelangelo all Bull (or anyone else)
can do is express awe: ''In painting the ceiling, Michelangelo . . .
painted for the glory of God and for the pleasure of his patron, for the
approbation of the papal courtiers and cognoscenti, and for his fellow
artists.'' Bull is an excellently affirmative guide to the genius of
Michelangelo but Bullish phrases like ''fertile creative genius'' takes
us no further than Bull's profound faith in the artist as an immortal
and most of us already accept his immortality.
Michelangelo was, as Bull observes, an artist of ''sublime
virtuosity''. Read Bull's enthusiastic, articulate book for the
background to the sublime virtuosity, then look again at the art in
Florence or Rome or feel at home in illustrations in purely pictorial
books that speak volumes about Michelangelo.

ITEND to read in fits and starts but I did read Irvine Welsh's
Trainspotting and The Acid House back to back.
I liked the latter book in bits -- especially the short story Where
the Debris Meets the Sea. What he does is transpose Leith and Hollywood.
So he has Kim Basinger, Kylie Minogue, Madonna and someone else lying in
Malibu looking at glossy magazines of Leith hard men and saying how
fantastic it would be to get off with them.
One of the stars says: ''och you're just dreaming there's no way we'll
ever get to Leith''. Apart from reading Spike 20 years ago, it's one of
the few books that I've ever laughed out loud at. Not all the stories
are like that though they're pretty hard hitting.
In Trainspotting there's a pretty horrific scene where a guy pretends
to murder a child to get revenge on the bloke who has passed AIDS on to
his ex-girlfriend. That really caused emotions in me that got to the
stage where I couldn't read any more.
I try to read as broad a mix as possible so last year I read a few
books by Charles Bukowski who was recommended to me by Parrot. Post
Office and Factom are about a character called Henry Chinaski who I
think is pretty well autobiographical. He's a drunk with writing
capabilities looking at a side of life that exists but is completely
alien to me.
I've also read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness because it's always
been on my list of books to read and because so many people have said
it's been such a source of inspiration to them. It was good enough but
it certainly wasn't any landmark for me.

HANNIBAL
Ross Leckie
Canongate, #14.99
THERE is a lovely moment near the beginning when Hannibal's father
wakens him before dawn. Storks are calling from the garden and horses
whinny towards the coming sun.
Hannibal, who is maybe four or five, is led through the house, past
the cypresses, past the orchards, gardens, fish ponds, and the great
pits where the elephants are stirring, through the dark to the great
wall of Carthage, 40 feet high and 30 feet thick for 22 miles around the
city, stabling 300 elephants and 4000 horses, with barracks for 20,000
soldiers and 4000 calvalry.
''A city within a city above which soared up towers, each of strong
battlements, shrouded in bronze shields.''
It is a defining moment. ''Carthage has no friends,'' his father tells
him. ''We rule through fear and greed . . . What you see is an island,
alone against the world. We must trade to live and the Romans would pen
us in.'' The father fought for the city's survival and passed the fight
to his son, whose childhood was over. This was the start of his training
to be a soldier.
It is the third century BC, Roman power is wearing thin and Carthage
is recovering from a desperate defeat in the Punic War. They are still
the dominant powers in the Mediterranean, struggling for established
trading routes and colonies. Hannibal's father, Hamilcar Barca, believes
in confronting the enemy, effectively declaring a truce by trading
within Africa.
Ross Leckie is obviously intent on restoring Hannibal's credibility,
of giving him his place as a great military commander, rather than a
minor irritation who took elephants across the Alps, or, at best, a
leader who refused to crumble against Roman might.
As with many first novels, the problem is explanation. Having accepted
what is now the established fictional autobiographical convention of
using Hannibal's voice to tell the story through a series of Greek
tablets, the narrator is frequently forced to explain what would have
been obvious. This is more than a niggardly point of stylistic
interpretation; it interrupts and in places intrudes upon the narrative,
slowing the pace, often where the tone and drive are affected.
The aim is obviously to achieve an intimacy, to let us know how
Hannibal developed, what guided his thinking and motivation; to let us
know how he felt. He dominates the narrative. Everyone is seen through
his eyes and are often ciphers. Hannibal is carefully constructed,
pieces of his background and character are fitted together like a
jigsaw. Others are less capably drawn.
This is an energetic novel, at best when the canvas is widest,
describing places or battles, describing the matter of fact cruelties
and detailiing the politics which dominated his life.
Hannibal's explanations are always plausible. The atmosphere and use
of set-piece battles are superb, especially his winter journey across
the Alps, driving his army and their elephants with an obsessive zeal.
He seems to defy the impossible, driven by a hatred of Rome and a love
of what his father held dear. The triumph is in how he eventually
transcends his obsessions to embrace a humanist dimension which may not
have brought peace but allows him to understand his enemies and their
motivation.

AUDIO BOOKS
WHEN it was first published, Iain Crichton Smith's Consider the Lilies
struck me -- to my shame -- as a slight book with jarring anachronisms.
Now this deceptively simple tale of the Clearances has been released on
tape by Canongate (an appropriate gesture to the aftermath of the '45)
and it gleams in its true colours as a little masterpiece.
It's not just an ironically understated account of that black period
in Scottish history -- making its impact through the specific story of
one old woman, Mrs Scott -- but an exploration of the infinitely subtle
world of a human soul.
As Donald MacLeod -- the atheist opponent of the Clearances --
perceives, his fellow citizens not only have to oppose the Patrick
Sellars of reality but the Sellars within themselves who destroy the
wellsprings of love and emotion. A particular lesson, perhaps, to those
of the Calvinist inheritance.
Eileen McCallum interpets the text beautifully, charting old Mrs
Scott's descent from quiet dignity to panic and anger, and finally to
partial reconciliation with herself and her fate. She also gives
convincing voice to the rasping bullyboy of the Duke of Sutherland and
the temporising minister. (Canongate, two tapes, #7.99)
Crichton Smith finds no need for overt violence in his story. However,
it is astonishing how one human voice -- albeit that of an accomplished
actor -- can conjure up a world of warfare more potently than the
literalism of cinema or TV and their mega-buck production costs. Two
sets of tapes serve as demonstration.
Alistair MacLean's best seller HMS Ulysses was of course successfully
filmed, but reader Denis Quilley invokes with desperate immediacy the
mini-world of the ship as it pursues its escort duties on a nightmarish
Murmansk convoy in the teeth of arctic storms and German malevolence.
Studio ice and wind are not half so cutting as those of the wordsmith.
MacLean may not have been the greatest of stylists but he well
understood the importance of a cast of diverse, interacting characters
and stuffs Ulysses to the gunnels with them, from the compassionate,
ailing captain to the obligatory Scots doctor. (HarperCollins, two
tapes, #7.99)
The interplay of characters -- officers and men, Brits and the rest --
not to mention the attractions of Sean Bean, no doubt explains the
unlikely success of Bernard Cornwell's TV adventures of the Peninsular
War.
In Sharpe's Battle the non-establishment Captain Sharpe deals with a
French opponent with a penchant for wolfskins and castrating prisoners.
A fair amount of blood and guts are expended in the high, dry mountain
frontier between Portugal and Spain. But there's humour, too. Sharpe
himself verges on the sentimental. As for his sugar-almond-eating
superior, one almost warms to the great slob of a man. (HarperCollins,
two tapes, #7.99)
More blood and guts, though of the canine sort, are spilt in Jack
London's The Call of the Wild. Buck, the great St Bernard-collie cross,
kidnapped for a sledge dog in Alaska, has a life ruled by ''the club and
the fang''. He is heroic in his capacity both for savagery and love.
London does not so much anthropomorphise the dog as project himself into
the beast's thought processes. The final image of Buck running free with
the wolves has an inevitability that satisfies. The dark romanticism of
Rubinstein's Second Symphony mirrors the text. (Naxos, two tapes, #6.49,
also available on CD at #7.99).
Alaska, not the chancers' playground of the gold rush but the great
northern landscapes themselves, entranced John Muir, the Scottish
naturalist. It was in the company of another dog, a little black
mongrel, that he experienced the adventure on a glacier, recounted with
so much eloquence and sense of wonder at nature in Stickeen.
Man and dog meet their moment of truth on the traverse of a fragile
ice bridge over a crevasse and the man sees almost human fear turn to
elation in his hitherto enigmatic companion. A lovely wee tape, with
Robert Trotter reading. (Scotsoun, #6.10)
Robinson Crusoe also has a dog but he's a pretty dull one. Defoe's
tale of the shipwrecked mariner (based on the real Scot Alexander
Selkirk) has been rendered in three tapes by Naxos with Nigel Anthony as
the reader and Handel for accompaniment. This is not just child's stuff
(though the fearsome cannibals and boy-scout resourcefulness of Crusoe
must appeal to the young). The book is also an extended rumination on
the individual's inner resources and capacity for conscience-led thought
in ''that great highway of the mind''. (#7.49 for tapes, #9.99 for CDs)
These are only a small sample of the audio tapes available in what is
not so much an expanding as an exploding market. For those brought up to
believe that eye-to-book contact is an essential part of fiction's
pleasure, this may be disconcerting. But there is, perhaps, a moral.
Viz, as Crusoe is wont to say, a good story's a good story whatever the
medium.
Incidentally, Naxos -- which draws on the Naxos and Marco Polo
classical music catalogues for its inspired parings of music to texts --
has just won two prizes (for James Joyce's Ulysses and Heathcote
Williams's Whale Nation) -- in the first ''Talkies'' awards for the
spoken word industry. A well deserved accolade.

THE LIFE OF ADAM SMITH
Ian Ross
Oxford University Press, #25
ADAM SMITH said: ''I am a beau only in my books.'' This is a judgment
to which others might subscribe without disrespect to the great man. He
spent his time largely in reading, writing and ratiocination, much of it
while staying at home with his mum in Kirkcaldy. Though kind and
agreeable, he was nobody's first choice for a night out on the town, and
Dr Samuel Johnson declared him insufferably boring when drunk.
In other words Smith possessed, for all his giant intellect, a less
than fascinating personality. So he presents a problem for biographers,
and has not in fact attracted many. The standard work of long standing
is John Rae's, published in 1895. Andrew Skinner and Roy Campbell added
a sketch of Smith's life to the Glasgow edition of his works. But
otherwise there is not much, scholars having concentrated on what he
wrote rather than on how he wrote it, which is perhaps as things should
be. All the same, Ian Ross of the University of British Columbia has not
been deterred from producing the definitive biography for modern times.
What can a new biographer add to any given subject? Well, there is
always the pleasure of digging up, then showing off facts so far
undiscovered, and Ross has certainly been diligent in that respect. He
clears up many small obscurities, rounds out accounts of various matters
in greater detail and sometimes introduces material of genuine
importance, such as that on relations between Smith and the Aberdeen
philosopher, Thomas Reid.
In other circumstances where there are no new facts to discover, one
has to shift as best one can, and clothe old facts in some new guise.
''Oxford was an appreciable distance to the south when Adam Smith rode
there on horseback in 1740,'' writes Ross, no doubt for those who
assumed the route from Kirkcaldy to be variable in length. It is not the
only example of padding in the thinner parts of the story, and overall I
am unsure that, as an exercise in factual narrative, this biography
alters in any profound way what we know of Smith's character and
experience.
In that case, the focus of interest must lie in the life of his mind,
which is surely where he was himself pointing us when he told us to look
not in his face but in his books. This is an especially fascinating
enterprise because his great published works, The Theory of Mortal
Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations, are an incomplete record of his
endeavours. Just before he died, he ordered a large quantity of his
papers burned, being reluctant to leave to the judgment of posterity
anything that did not meet his own highest standards.
We can be reasonably sure that they contained drafts of two or more
major volumes, one on the government and law, the other on literature
and aesthetics, which for all we know might have been revolutionary in
their impact as those he did get finished.
So it ought to be possible to gain something from informed speculation
on what the lost volumes might have contained. There is an effort at
this, by reference to notes from Smith's lectures on the relevant
subjects at an early stage of his career, and to various other hints in
his writings: Ross's industry among neglected sources does pay off to
that extent.
Ross is doubtless wise not to launch into detailed discussion of the
two published books except where they bear on events falling with
Smith's personal experience, as in his comments on the outbreak of the
American Revolution added just as The Wealth of Nations was going to
press.
Yet perhaps more could have been done with them to illuminate that
lifelong project which had in the end to be left unfulfilled. Little is
said of the ''Adam Smith problem'', the paradox that in some parts of
his work he seems to assume that society is a product of individuals'
character and instincts, while in other parts he seems to assume that
the individual is a product of society.
The paradox has led to a great deal of controversy, and probably it
could only ever be resolved at some higher level obscure to us because
he did not complete his task. In his eventual analogue with the
Newtonian system -- which he surely would have called ''moral
philosophy'' -- he might have been able to combine natural religion,
ethics, political economy and jurisprudence, with the passions taking
their place as one aspect of human nature among others. It would be
asking a lot of anyone to complete the system for him, but Ross appears
to lose interest in it once it rises above the level of a problem in
textual criticism.
That approach, unless it really is accompanied by important new
discoveries, may call into question the rationale for an updated
biography. In the 200 years since Smith's death, his reputation has
undergone huge changes. In the Victorian era he assumed a virtually
divine authority, while at one stage in the middle of the twentieth
century he was reduced to a sort of antiquarian curiosity. Now he is
back on his plinth again, as tutelary deity of global capitalism. But
you do not need to read very far past the first three chapters of The
Wealth of Nations to see that this is obviously a distortion, that the
basis he provided for abstract capitalist analysis was to him a means,
not an end.
A means to what, though? We come back again to the unfinished system,
a system which was yet so rich and persuasive in its severally completed
parts that readers of many different opinions and circumstances can
reach into it and deepen their own understanding of the world they live
in, as they can from Shakespeare or the Bible. Just as, to do that, we
need not know much about the lives of Shakespeare or of the prophets and
evangelists, so are further facts about Smith perhaps little to the
point. In any event, the product of Ross's toil goes if anything to show
that few further facts can be found.

JENNIFER HARBURY
Kirsty Scott meets an American and a Scot fighting to make a
difference to the lives og ordinary Guatemalans
IT WAS an unlikely but powerful union, a bond so unusual yet so strong
that it continues to unsettle Governments and rattle official
consciences four years after it was brutally ruptured.
When Harvard-educated US lawyer Jennifer Harbury hiked for six hours
to a remote guerrilla settlement in the highlands of Guatemala in 1990
she was looking for information for a book on women in combat. What she
found was 33-year-old Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, a poor Mayan Indian who
had risen to become Commandante Everardo, one of the top guerrilla
commanders in the rebel movement. Six months after they married, Efrain
disappeared while visiting his troops and Harbury was told she had
become a widow, another name to be scratched onto the endless list of
Guatemala's grieving and bereaved.
For the authorities it was all supposed to end there. Harbury would
buckle under her grief, forget to ask where her husband's body lay and
limp home to the US where she belonged. They could not have been more
wrong.
The official line was that Efrain had killed himself, presumably to
safeguard the rebels' secrets, after being wounded in battle in March
1992. But in early 1993 two guerrillas said they had seen her husband --
alive -- in a secret military prison in June of 1992.
In the three and a half years since then Harbury has put herself
through hunger strike three times, caused untold embarrassment to the
Guatemalan authorities and the US government and helped uncover the
unpalatable allegation that the man who ordered Efrain's death was a
CIA-sponsored operative. She still does not have his body, but she knows
where he probably lies now, dead after months of torture, in a mass
grave that may hold as many as 2000 other people.
She must have presence, this woman who was dragged half-starved
through the jungle to watch the Guatemalan authorities exhume and offer
up the wrong corpses to try and break her, but I can't spot her in the
crush of the National Film Theatre cafe in London. Then something about
the direct gaze of the small, slim stranger in the corner pulls me over.
She's a wisp of a woman, but her eyes are startling; wide and clear and
fierce with resolve.
There were hints that she might have followed Rigoberta Menchu and won
the Nobel Peace Prize this year, for everything she does is not just for
Efrain, it's for every widow and every family whose lives have been
brutalised by the tragedy of Guatemala. She is a thorn in the side of
the authorities and in particular the military and it is a role she
relishes.
''We're talking about an army that has torture and assassination
without trial, and kidnapping and methods of terror as their basic
weapons against a civilian population,'' she says. ''They're not really
fighting the guerilla movement. They're fighting to keep a
socio-economic structure in place with no change. That means
cannibalising their own country. They're not fighting to protect their
own frontiers. It was just a useful excuse for massacring the Mayan
people whom they don't consider to be human. One of the standard
statements they make to me is: ''you can't possibly be married to him.
You're a white woman with a Harvard law degree and he was an Indio, dark
with big lips.''
She's on a whistle-stop speaking tour of Europe, hoping to keep
Guatemala at least partway in the headlines and trying not to be
discouraged that few people are aware of the country and its problems.
In the meantime she is pushing to prosecute those who tortured and
killed Efrain -- she has their names -- and will be filing a civil
rights suit against the CIA and the US State Department. Longer term,
she wants to get all human rights cases declassified by the CIA.
It will take years if not decades, but Harbury will stick with it. She
doesn't flinch when asked about the risks, about the reports of hired
hitmen, about the death threats and the fears so publicly expressed for
her own safety.
''I refuse to think about it at all,'' she says, eyes blazing.
''That's how they keep getting away with this -- they make it so
terrifying that you feel like you can't do anything, then they get off
scot-free once again and feel free to do it again to someone else. So,
do you know what I do? I don't waste time worrying about it.''

COLUMBIA'S ISLAND
E Mairi MacArthur
Edinburgh University Press, #12.95
BAILTEAN IS ATH--GHAIRMEAN
Niall M. Brownlie
Argyll Publishing, #6.99
CALANAIS
Patrick Ashmore Calanais: The Standing Stones Calanais Visitor Centre,
Calanais, Isle of Lewis HS2 9DY #5.95 (by post)
Splendid isolation
Islands hold a fascination for most of us. They lie over the horizon
of our strenuous lives as places we want to reach to refresh ourselves.
Iona is an exceptional island with a unique history and atmosphere. E
Mairi MacArthur is its eloquent chronicler.
In 1990 she published a seminal study called Iona: The Living Memory
of a Crofting Community 1750-1914 (Edinburgh University Press). Her new
book is particularly appealing for its account of the history of the
isle from the First World War onwards.
She has the great advantage of belonging to an old Iona family, and
her father, Dugald MacArthur, former librarian of St Andrews University
and Iona ethnologist, has given her assistance in the preparation of
Columba's Island, as have elderly Iona residents.
Iona's history is as fragile as the marran dunes stopping the erosion
of the ocean. Columba landed in 563 to found a monastic settlement which
was torched repeatedly by the Norsemen. Reginald, Lord of the Isles,
built a monastery on more or less the same site -- it was wrecked in the
Reformation. In the 1930s George MacLeod landed with a vision of
restoring the medieval ruins.
MacLeod's Iona Community is now world famous. But MacArthur's book is
so valuable because it deals with that other community of crofters and
fishermen living for generations alongside the ruined monastery, no
doubt helping themselves to consecrated stones to build houses and
dikes, and supplementing their earnings by taking in summer visitors
from the steamers.
In MacArthur's evocative narrative we hear the Gaelic voice behind the
plough coaxing on the horse in the field above the sound, and the
resignation of islanders who had to contend with the treachery of the
sea. We witness islanders dancing on sandy roads, and detect, underneath
MacArthur's measured account, the murmur of voices calling into question
George MacLeod's rebuilding programme because it could damage what it
was setting out to protect.
Mairi MacArthur mixes the sacred and the mundane in a memorable study,
cautioning us all that Iona ''is a small place to carry such a burden of
history and legend, of beliefs and expectation, and we should all
perhaps tread lightly''.
A day's sail from the sacred isle by favourable wind, Tiree was the
garden of Iona, under the firm control of the monks, Niall Brownlie
points out in Bailtean is Ath-Ghairmean (Townships and Echoes), a
bi-lingual history cum guide book of his native island. Like Iona, Tiree
was the property of the Argyll dynasty. In 1846 it had a population of
around 5000 souls. But then am Baillidh Mor, the big factor of the Duke
landed, and in 20 years through oppression and eviction he had reduced
the population to around 2000. A crofter uprising brought in the marines
with fixed bayonets.
Tiree is famous - or notorious - for its stories of the second sight.
The local airport is at Reef (Gaelic ruighe, sheiling), a base for
bombers who assisted in the Battle of the Atlantic that sent the bodies
to Iona's shores.
''John Maclean (the famous Tiree seer) . . . over a hundred years ago
predicted the coming of the Second World War. He foretold that large
birds would rise and land on the reef, controlled by beings with snouts
like pigs. Moreover, he prophesied that the island would be full of
military personnel and that they would be residing in strangely shaped
houses.''
Brownlie describes the fresh beauty of a low lying island with a
population of 800 where surfboards instead of Viking longships ride the
swell. He is hopeful that the island's fine dialect of Gaelic will
survive, and he gives a list of charming Tiree riddles in Gaelic.
''Four came over, without boat or ship: one yellow and white, one
brown and abounding in twigs, one to handle the flail, and one to strip
the trees.''
Answer? ''The four seasons.''
The Hebrides are rich in standing stones. I have stood among the
pillars of Calanais on Lewis on a summer evening and sensed their power.
In his informative and superbly illustrated study of Calanais: The
Standing Stones, Patrick Ashmore of Historic Scotland speculates on the
function and significance of these enigmatic stones.
''The most attractive explanation for the building of the stone
settings in this area is that every 18.6 years, the moon skims
especially low over the southern hills. It seems to dance along them,
like a great god visiting the earth. Knowledge and prediction of this
heavenly event gave earthly authority to those who watched the skies. At
Calanais, this power was given material expression by a people for whom
the cycles of the sea, of their lives and of the heavens provided the
foundations for a rich set of beliefs.'' Likewise on Iona, Tiree, and
these other islands of the spirit over the horizon.

KATE COOK
KATE COOK has more than 30 children, a ragged, scrawny brood whose
easy smiles and juvenile antics hide cautious, careworn spirits. There's
Florie who doesn't know how old she is and hides her head to cover the
deep welts raised by her father's belt. And the 12-year-old who pinched
her purse while she was reading to him, but still turned up for lessons
the next day.
Kate's a teacher and her classroom is the heaving Democracia
marketplace at the heart of Qeutzaltenango, Guatemala's second biggest
city. She's been here for more than a year, by way of Lochgelly, a
languages degree and the desire to do some volunteer work before she
hopped on the career track.
All of her children work, and work hard, up at dawn and out by first
light trading their wares and minding the stalls, old before their time.
Lessons have to be snatched in brief breaks or held as they sell.
It took Kate and her colleagues at the Ecumenical Centre for
Integrated Ministry a while to gain the trust of the youngsters and
their parents. In a country with an almost medieval attitude to human
rights, the needs and rights of children were never going to be a high
priority.
''They love to learn though, they really do,'' she says. ''A lot of
them have never been to school and they want to learn, but their parents
want them to work to earn money. A lot of the work we do is more fun
than formal education. We do games, we do a lot of work on children's
rights, we do painting, colouring, lots of creative things, sports,
anything to get them motivated and at the same time trying to teach them
basic literacy skills. A lot of them are maybe about 15 years old and
can't write their own name, they don't know when they were born, they
don't know how old they are, they don't know their surnames. At 15, to
not know how old you are or even who you are. Think about it, it's such
a shame, it really is.''
They call her ''Gringa'' and she calls them her own, keeping a sheaf
of snapshots with her. But she's careful not to get too attached because
they can disappear with no warning and no goodbye. ''They don't even
tell you, they just go. One day they're there and the next day they're
not. And you're left with their jotters with all their work in it. You
just have to hold on to them and hope they come back.''
Disrupted schooling is one thing, but abuse delivers a more harrowing
set of problems. ''There's a lot of it that goes on and it's difficult
to know how to deal with it. For example Florie. She's a little wild
woman, always running around in her bare feet with her hair all over the
place. She came in the other day and she was hiding her head in her
hands. She wouldn't lift her head. She had lost something the day before
and her mother had told her father and he'd taken a belt to her face.
Her whole face was covered in big welts.
''We spoke to the mother and said children have a right to be happy,
to have an education, to lose things and not be hit about and not have a
belt taken to their face. But the mother doesn't want anything to do
with it because she's scared if she complains then the father will hit
her. What do you do?''
With such pressing concerns facing her charges, Kate is not confident
that the upcoming elections will make one iota of difference to their
lives. In Guatemala politics is for the privileged and election promises
as flimsy as the gaudy party fliers littering the market square.
''The children themselves and their parents don't really know much
about this election. They won't vote, they don't know they're supposed
to vote. Their life is what it is, they don't really see anything
outwith the life they have, which is getting up at 4am, making
breakfast, taking the kids out to the market, sitting in the market,
selling all day, going home at night, preparing food then going to bed.
It's the same every day. They don't really think about the future. They
just thank God that they've got enough money to live off at the moment
and a lot of them genuinely believe that the way they live, the life
that they lead, however hard, is God's will.''

Kirsty Scott visits a refugee community abandonded in the remote
reaches of the Guatemalan rainforest
WE'VE been walking for four hours now and the light is starting to go,
casting uncertain shadows on the rainforest floor and amplifying the
chorus of squeaks and hisses swelling around us. Overhead, the howler
monkeys swing in for a closer look, cackling as we stumble through the
mud and swipe ineffectually at the clouds of mosquitos which rise with
every squelching step. A rustle of leaves to the left and a large black
and red tarantula scuttles out from a rotten tree stump and lurches
towards the path.
Then suddenly the canopy breaks and we smell the first acrid whiff of
woodsmoke. A dog barks, followed by the thin distinctive wail of a child
and we push out through the undergrowth and into the heart of La
Quetzal.
There are more than 1000 people here, mostly crammed into small,
makeshift houses fashioned from wood and plastic on this broad swathe of
land scraped out of the rainforest. That walk, that four hours of
sticky, strength-sapping, sweat-soaked endurance is their only link with
the outside world.
They are Mayans, some of the 40,000 or so who fled to Mexico in the
1980s, when the Guatemalan military were at the height of their
scorched-earth campaign. They are also among the first to return,
brought back in April this year under a deal with the Guatemalan
government, which bought them the finca (plot of land) at La Quetzal.
It was quite a homecoming. A caravan of people moving slowly across
the northwestern portion of the country, cheered by onlookers who
gathered at the side of the road and buoyed by the thought of their own
land in their own country. They knew it was isolated -- four hours drive
on a potholed dirt track from the region's main town of Flores, then at
least four hours walking -- but the deal was to include a new road which
would link them with the outside world. It has not been built and they
are now a community adrift from civilization.
It speaks volumes about the warmth of the settlement that they accept
us unquestioningly, sorting out sour-smelling mattresses for our beds in
the makeshift clinic and arranging for us to eat the following day with
different families. Exhausted, dehydrated and with the whine of
mosquitos still ringing in our ears, we head for bed and sleep soundly,
woken only once by the agonised groans of a malaria victim brought to
the clinic just after midnight.
By 5am the buzz of cicadas is replaced by the raucous crowing of
scores of cockerels and the rasping coughs of children roused from their
beds to fetch water and firewood. Health is becoming a serious concern:
one child has succumbed to malnutrition and others are close to death;
respiratory disease is rife and dengue fever and malaria commonplace.
Oscar Mendoza, of the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund, has
come to pay his first visit to the community to see what help might be
offered. He is, quite simply, stunned.
''Coming out of the forest and into the clearing it was obvious
conditions were very, very basic.'' he says. ''People are facing real
problems. There are cases of malnutrition among the children, malaria
has also been a terrible curse on them. They are really suffering. If
there is no outside assistance, they will go hungry and the weak, the
elderly and the children will die. It is an inevitable conclusion to
this situation.''
While we are clinically assessing their chances for a viable future, a
small, skinny girl with a slide-away smile comes to fetch us for
breakfast, leading us to a ramshackle dwelling near the main compound
where her mother, still suckling a newborn, has set out bowls of beans
and a stack of steaming hot tortillas. For every one that we eat,
another two or three are whipped off the griddle over the open fire and
put down before us.
The scratchy, blaring call of a loudspeaker calls us to the first
meeting of the community's leaders, squatting on logs of wood under a
tin-roofed shelter. There are around 12 of them, all responsible for
different aspects of settlement life. The leader, Sebastian, tells us
that isolation is the most pressing concern and the need for a road
grows more desperate with every week that passes. They are running short
of food, the rainy season has put paid to any plans for growing crops
and the health workers who have been helping then out will be leaving by
the end of November.
The education spokesman, a quiet, fiercely intelligent man, whose eyes
slip away with frustration when you look at him, clenches his fists when
he speaks of their situation. In Mexico, their life in exile was
infinitely more sophisticated: some of the younger people worked in the
tourist resort of Cancun; there were proper houses, food, support and
work. Now they are back home with next to nothing. ''We are Mayan people
and we want to live among nature,'' he says, waving his arm towards the
thick hedge of rainforest on all sides, ''but we do not even have the
most basic tools to do that.''
At dinner that night we meet Raoul. He says he doesn't know how old he
is, but thinks it might be 20. He was about seven or eight when he was
last in Guatemala. ''When I was in Mexico, I often dreamed of the town
we would build ourselves when we came back,'' he says. ''We would have
houses and shops and a market place, a meeting point, and jobs. We would
be able to work the land and feed ourselves.'' He looks around him, at
the dark shapes of his family as they move about the shack; and slaps
the mosquitos that descend on his arms, raising small bursts of blood.
''It is so hard here for us now,'' he says sadly. ''We have so many
problems.''
Despite the hardships the community is keen to show off their
accomplishments; the two schools, desks and chairs rough-hewn from tree
trunks; the shop which sells mostly bottles of soda brought in by
tractor and a meagre selection of soaps and detergents; the football
pitch; the water system pumped up from the river and into a series of
faucets. It's mildly chlorinated and drinkable, but still pretty dodgy.
The clinic is the focal point of the settlement and has a steady
stream of visitors all day; two young children with high fevers who
cling to their mother crying distractedly; a man with an ugly gash on
his leg; more malaria cases; a sick baby.
By 7pm, the light starts to fade and by 9pm, La Quetzal settles in for
the night, enveloped in darkness so black you can't see your hand in
front of your face.
On our final morning, we eat breakfast with a different family. They
have laid on noodles and tortillas and we share the table with a tiny
boy, who looks no more than three, but turns out to be six.
In a put-up bed next to the table a smaller child is lying, awkwardly
inert, her skinny chest rising and falling with laboured breaths. The
mother explains that she is three but has been paralysed since an
illness at the age of 10 months. She says an aid worker who had visited
the camp some time ago had promised to try and help her but had never
been back in touch, and she is growing increasingly worried about her
offspring. A fly, which has made it under the mosquito net, settles on
the child's stomach and crawls around in small circles.
Oscar Mendoza is careful not to make unrealistic promises to the
community leaders, but believes SCIAF can help in the short and long
term. ''Our aim is not for them to continue to depend on SCIAF or any
other external forces. There need to be mechanisms for the people to
become self-reliant and self-sufficient so our help is unneccessary,''
he says.
As we get ready to leave, a small group gathers outside the clinic to
say farewell. There are smiles and rounds of vigorous handshakes. Then
we turn away from them and slip back into the rainforest.
That same day we drive to Tikal, one of the most important sites of
Mayan civilization in the world. It boasts the only paved road in the
region and a cluster of American-style jungle lodges with ceiling fans
and gaudy printed fabrics.
There, next morning, we clamber up the ancient stones until we rise
above the canopy of trees. Somewhere out there, past the temples and the
clouds of butterflies towards the horizon lies La Quetzal. It's not in
the guidebook which extols the sophistication of the ancient Mayan way
of life. But there is one interesting fact included. The quetzal, it
turns out, is the national bird of Guatemala, a gorgeous vision in
irridescent blue and green. These days it is almost extinct and rarely
spotted in the forest's thick foliage. But the curious thing about this
creature, says the book, is that if it is held captive or caged in any
way, in a surprisingly short space of time, it will close its colourful
feathers about its back, turn its head from the sky and, ultimately,
give up the will to live.
* Donations for the community of La Quetzal or any of Sciaf's projects
in the region can be made to SCIAF, 5 Oswald Street, Glasgow, G1 4QR.

The small Central American nation of Guatemala has become synonymous
with some of the worst human rights abuses in the world. Despite a
decade of civilian rule and fresh elections next week, Herald journalist
Kirsty Scott found a nation still living under the shadow of la
violencia.
WHERE is he now, this man? Stuck in some cold dank cell as we stroll
past his workplace, heading for lunch in the heat of the midday sun?
Maybe beaten, bruised, unconscious, tortured, dead. Dead? Almost
certainly. It's been a week now and his tormentors will surely have
tired of their play.
We only know about him by the small notice, handwritten in the urgent
scrawl of a black marker pen and stuck defiantly in the shop window -- a
faint reminder of the dirty little secret which still haunts Guatemala.
''We demand the return of our colleague, disappeared last week,'' it
says.
On the other side of the glass, Guatemala City goes about its
business; the street vendors, the shoe polishers, the beggars, the
schoolchildren, and everywhere the little clusters of soldiers, grim,
unsmiling and weighted down with semi-automatic weapons.
This notice speaks volumes about Guatemala. While other countries in
Latin America unclench from corrupt and crisis-riven regimes, Guatemala
can't seem to shake off the horrors of its past, can't let go of the
fear, the deep abiding sense of menace. But these days there are those
who are just that little bit more unwilling to accept it. One small
scrawled notice, but one more demand for the horror to end. The voice of
Rigoberta Menchu, the Mayan peasant woman and 1992 Nobel Peace Prize
winner has so far been the loudest, but there are others waiting to be
heard, clamouring for real, meaningful, unalterable change.
Next week Guatemala will go the polls to elect its fourth civilian
government since military rule ended in 1985, and for the first time the
indigenous peoples, the Mayans, are pushing for proper representation
and putting forward their own candidates.
They have a real fight on their hands. Since the Spanish conquest, the
Mayans have been forced into grinding poverty and political purgatory by
the country's ruling elite. They make up more than 50% of the
population, but suffer appalling deprivation and have a lifespan which
lasts, on average, into their mid-40s. Recent estimates suggest that 82%
of Guatemalans are living in poverty and 62% in extreme poverty where
they cannot even feed and clothe themselves.
In the past few years, the Guatemalan authorities have gone on
something of a PR offensive, luring tourists with the gloss and glitz
they have applied to the Mayan heritage, and ignoring the horrors of the
early 1980s when a scorched earth campaign burned 440 villages, killed
more than 150,000 people and sent 40,000 others fleeing as refugees.
''There have been great changes which have been recognised by the UN
Mission in Guatemala,'' says Edmundo Nanne, the Guatemalan ambassador to
the UK. ''Unfortunately there are still transgressions. It's very hard
to stop that sort of thing completely overnight and it is especially
hard when you still have an active guerrilla war. But a lot of steps
have been taken.''
Even the military, the root of almost all evil, has hired an American
PR firm to try and spruce up its image. But none of it has worked on
Oscar Mendoza, a project officer with the Scottish Catholic
International Aid Fund, and a regular visitor to the region.
''The problems here are to do with the exclusion of the vast majority
of people from the political process, the marginalisation of millions of
indigenous Guatemalan Indians and their acute need for even the most
basic of services in terms of medicine, health, employment,'' he said.
''There continue to be gross violations of human rights and, in spite of
the rhetoric, extra-judicial killings and disappearances continue to
happen.
''Why has Guatemala not moved as quickly or dynamically on human
rights? Because the military are fairly independent and don't depend on
funding and aid from the US. The army is an institution with a great
deal of infrastructure, they even own their own bank, and in a sense
they can ignore pressures from outside sources.''
Mendoza is here to visit a variety of projects funded by SCIAF, most
notably Conavigua, the national co-ordination for Guatemalan widows and
one of the most prominent pressure groups in the country.
Their offices are housed in a small yellow building in the heart of
the chaotic fume-filled sprawl of Guatemala City, a stone's throw from
the seat of Government. We approach carefully, checking parked cars and
doorways because Conavigua representatives are routinely followed and
harassed. A few minutes after ringing the bell, a grille slides open and
we are ushered in to meet Lucia Quila.
She's a shade more than five feet tall with a calm, strong face and
the broad capable hands of someone who has worked hard all her life.
Thirteen years ago, she was a peasant mother in the district of
Chimaltenango. Then her husband disappeared. ''Soon after that one of my
brothers was kidnapped and subsequently my father and elder sister were
murdered,'' she says quietly. ''It was very hard battling through on my
own and I felt very strongly that there was a need not to stay alone and
silent, so I started organising women with similar problems in my own
community. I was quite isolated until I realised that there were other
groups, similar groups.''
In 1991 the army accused Lucia of belonging to the URNG, the guerrilla
movement which is now in the midst of peace talks with the authorities.
The accusation was an effective death sentence and Lucia had to leave
her family for long periods to try and keep them safe. But safety is a
unreliable concept here and just a few weeks ago, her 14-year-old
daughter was kidnapped off the street and released a short while later,
terrified but unharmed.
Lucia got the message, but she's not budging. ''At times there is real
danger, not just for us but for our families and our friends. But when
my husband disappeared there was no-one to speak on his behalf and now
we have an organisation. As long as we have life we will be able to
denounce and be able to tell things as they are and try to seek
solutions -- that's what keeps us going. That's what gives us
strength.''
It will take almost superhuman strength to overcome the human rights
impasse which still exists despite a global agreement on the issue
between the government and the guerrillas.
Lucia sighs deeply when questioned about it, twisting a paper clip
distractedly around her fingers. ''The situation is not improved in any
way and at times it has worsened,'' she says. ''Almost daily there are
killings in different parts of the country and kidnappings are rife,
sometimes even of children. The circumstances of the killings are never
ascertained.
''And the main obstacle to putting an end to the human rights
violations is the lack of political will on the part of the Government,
the military, the courts. It could come about but it will only come
about if people actually pressure the Government.''
A few streets away, at the offices of the Centro de Accion Legal en
Derechos Humanos, Frank La Rue and his team deal with the nuts and bolts
of investigating human rights abuses and try to keep the global
spotlight on the atrocities. In recent months they have been scraping
the detritus of the 1980 massacres from one mass grave in the Ixcan
region -- 10 bags of bones, the largest of them three inches across,
5000lbs of ash, some shrapnel fragments and what looks like bits of
bullet. The CALDH offices have been under clumsy surveillance for so
long now that they can laugh about the crisp-munching operatives who
listen in to their phone conversations.
''The human rights situation in Guatemala varies frequently but
actually in the last few months it has gotten pretty bad,'' says La Rue.
''We are, as you know, negotiating a peace process in Guatemala between
the Government and the guerrillas which is the biggest hope for the
future of the country. But there are also a lot of sectors, sectors in
the military and businessmen linked to corruption who are trying to stop
this peace process because it affects their interests. They have had a
way of life where they have benefited financially and politically from
this sort of lawlessness that existed. These are the sectors that always
try and increase the degree of threats and violence and to halt the
negotiations going forward.
''What can be done in respect of human rights? More pressure from the
Guatemalan people. It's interesting even today, human rights are not
being understood, and the way that private citizens can challenge their
own state. This is new in a country like Guatemala where oppression and
discrimination against the indigenous peoples has been such a hallmark
for centuries.''
It seems fitting somehow that Guatemala City is the centre of power
because it is the only truly ugly place in this whole country. Outside
the city limits and away from the medieval slums which cling to the
rubbish-strewn cliff faces, Guatemala is a jewel, a patchwork of lakes
and volcanos and clear-aired mountain villages, and up to the north,
mile upon mile of pristine rainforest. At the roadside, the peasants, or
campesinos wander along in thin lines, bright in their embroidered
clothes and bent double under piles of wood.
At Tecpan, some two hours north of the capital, we drive along an airy
track until everything we can see is below us, half-hidden in valley
mist. We've come to visit a small Mayan community, one of many trying to
turn their situation around by living as simply and effectively as they
can from the land around them. The concept of land, of Mother Earth, is
a fundamental one for the Mayan people, but the vast bulk of the country
is held by a small coterie of rich and powerful landowners. The
indigenous groups are left to rent small plots or work as hired help in
someone else's fields.
Here at the community of Xecocol the people have grown a herbal garden
with solar drying sheds to make their own medicines. The neatly terraced
fields hold broccoli for export and corn for their own consumption, and
they've devised a different kind of oven which makes better use of the
firewood fuel. Last year they opened a brand new school.
The work at Xecocol is funded by a group called ADECOGUA and its
director, Toribio Say, is delighted with their progress.
''As Mayans we want to live with the ladinos (non-Indians), together,
in harmony. We do not want separation. We want to work the land, to live
off the land, like this, as the others did before us.''
We point out the beauty of the region and its potential as a prime
tourist destination and Toribio laughs uproariously, shaking his head.
Tourism is now Guatemala's second biggest source of revenue after
coffee, but the Mayans see little of its benefits.
''There is a saying amongst the Mayan people about those who greet
people wearing someone else's hat,'' he says, ''and that is what the
Guatemalan authorities here are doing, they are using the Mayan culture
for their own benefit when in reality the Mayan people don't even have
the choices or the opportunities that they require.''
In truth, tourism is the least of their concerns. With the election
looming there is a thick, almost palpable sense of tension here.
Toribio, for all his bluster, believes the indigenous groups will not
make their mark this time round, but will gather strength for the
elections at the turn of the century and will start to see real change
then.
Frank La Rue, who some believe has political aspirations of his own,
thinks it will come sooner. ''I am an optimist. I think peace will be
signed within the first six months of next year. The closer we get to
peace the worse some people react. Those that are linked to corruption,
to drug trafficking and to abuse of power obviously will do whatever
they can to stop this negotiation process. So at the moment, we are to
live a very tense period until peace is signed and we all have a big
degree of risk, but after that, after peace is signed, I think things
will begin to shape up.''
Back at the Conavigua offices, Lucia Quila is not so sure. She
believes they are in it for the long haul and that however important
this particular election for the indigenous people, there is still much
work to be done, and still much suffering to be borne.
As she leads us out to the iron-barred front door we ask her if she is
ever frightened, ever considers the risks she takes on a daily basis to
be too much. She has ducked the question earlier and now laughs at our
insistence before she answers.
''As human beings, there are moments when there is fear,'' she says
finally. ''But we have never allowed fear to overcome us. We have
overcome fear because we know we have to do that. The reason why the
military try to impose fear is because they know that it tends to stop
people from acting, and now, because we are aware of that, we have never
let fear stop us. We never will.''

William Hunter talks to a man who created a fascinating local history
and found, to his surprise, some very personal recollections
TWICE in its story Bellshill, the Lanarkshire former coal and iron
town, has surprised itself by appearing in unexpected places. First, it
was on maps. Bellshill is not where it used to be. Ramblers in the
byways of its rural past put its roots elsewhere than next to Mossend.
They place it nearer the east end of Viewpark. There was a quarry whose
owner's name was Bell. For his workers he built a row of houses. They
became Bellshill.
When the quarry stone played out and the cottages emptied, Lanarkshire
had one more place-name than it had a place to attach it to. Yet it was
the name that survived. When people left Bellshill, they took their
address with them.
Jack Fisher, a local historian, explains: ''A neighbouring village
called Crossgates (situated at what we now know as Bellshill Cross)
became the focal point of the local area. In about l810 this growing
village itself took on the name of Bellshill, and in its expansion
gradually absorbed surrounding villages such as Black Moss and
Sykehead.''
He suggested that the change in Bellshill's geography might have been
the work of a map-maker who gave up trying to fit in all the rural names
that local people used.
It is to Fisher that Bellshill owes its second unlikely location. He
has put it in a book, Old Bellshill in Pictures.
Until now its story had been available exclusively and in compact form
only in a scholarly booklet by a former teacher at Bellshill Academy.
Uniquely, however, Fisher has chosen to make his chronicle pictorial.
Picturesque is not a descriptive word that instantly adheres to
Bellshill. But for 30 years -- although he wonders if 40 years may be
nearer it -- Fisher has been collecting what images have been felt worth
taking of the town's streets, public buildings, churches, and shops, and
of people going about their everyday lives.
Many of the old photos were issued as picture postcards.
Enthusiasm for local history has produced many similar collections of
unlikely places to have albums of picture-postcard scenes made about
them, although few are less likely than Bellshill. But a rare treat of
Fisher's researches was to find an old card that includes himself in it.
It is a little-changed streetscape which remains recognisable to young
readers, but also contains features that will bring a gleam of
recognition to those whose memories stretch back to l935.
North Road, as viewed in the picture from a bridge that carried a
coal-pit railway, is almost traffic-free. Heading towards the camera are
a horse-drawn van and two lorries. There is an ice-cream barrow. Across
a side-street from a branch shop of the Bellshill and Mossend
Co-operative stands a wooden telephone box.
Coming out of the Co-op dairy is a small boy on a tricycle.
The passing of 60 years has added a shimmering idyllic quality to this
picture of an ordinary decent suburban street. Fisher's memory has added
more.
In his book he can give names to some of the people passing the time
on North Road. He remembers that of the two men across from the
ice-cream barrow, one was Sam Arnott a window cleaner. The ice-cream man
is Tony Coia and the friend he's speaking to was Bob Smellie, a farmer.
While Fisher remembers that the front lorry in the picture was a
Price's coal lorry, he is irked that he has not yet identified the one
coming behind it. He is almost sure it was a fruit and veg lorry, but
not sure enough for a historian to say so in the picture's caption.
The boy on the tricycle, although a racing blur on the photo, he
spotted with no bother. ''I got him right away, no doubt about it. I was
the only one around there who had a trike,'' he explained.
''You knew everybody in Bellshill at that stage. It was a village.''
He conceded that nostalgia had taken its own sweet time to catch up
with him. ''History was a bad word to me when I was at school,'' he
said. He left Bellshill in his mid-twenties to follow his trade as a
joiner and building inspector to Bute and elsewhere.
His first shy steps into the past came after an illness when an
elderly neighbour took him for gentle strolls into ancient Roman times.
Fisher, now 71, first helped with the excavation of legion's bathhouse
in Strathclyde Park and the fort at Twechar.
It was while assisting to gathering material for a Motherwell museum,
planned to open next spring, that his curiosity focused closer to home
and nearer to now.
''Really, it has taken me 30 or 40 years to put this little book
together -- a wee bit here and a wee bit there,'' he said.
At first, he went raking over the past of Motherwell, where he lives,
only to find the ground had at least enough diggers. Bellshill, however,
was untilled soil. ''It has had only this one book, called Old Bellshill
by Ian Cormack, all to itself. So I found myself tending to keep going
back to my own town.''
If holiday postcards seem an unlikely source, their explanation lies
in Bellshill's history. With the discovery of iron and coal in the
l830s, it became a frontier town. Work-hungry immigrants arrived from
many other parts of Britain and Ireland. More exotic late-comers
included Poles and Lithuanians.
A photograph in Fisher's book has a group of Bellshill-Lithuanian
miners, from around l9l0, in their Scotch bunnets and holding their
working gear to bore holes for explosives.
His caption explains: ''Lithuanians came to the area as far back as
l860 as prisoners of war from the Crimea: they came to escape poverty
and persecution. America was the original goal of these emigrating
people but it was cheaper to get to Scotland, and many decided to stay
rather than go on.
''By l900 there were an estimated 3000 in Bothwell parish, with many
settling in Bellshill and Mossend; at the time this picture was taken
there were around 200 Lithuanian families living in the miners' row
behind Main Street.
''Today there is still a strong Lithuanian community in the area and
there is a Lithuanian Club situated on the Calder Road.''
Other local items include what Bellshill did when a town baker fenced
off its common washing green and where it has a house built of railway
sleepers. On the site of a cash-and-carry place a coachbuilding firm
once made stylish cars for worldwide customers.
How old Bellshill got the heavy and dirty end of work comes contained
in the picture story of a flax mill that in turn was used to make
blackening and then wheel barrows before it was converted to a foundry,
a sawmill, and finally an ice factory.
Picture postcards of such places are not beautiful. Even Bellshill
people agree that their finest building was the central shops for the
old Co-op. But they are happy photos just the same.
The modest magic of the town's first picture-book is that by recalling
old scenes it promises also to link new generations. ''I'm told it is
doing quite well,'' Fisher said. ''Many of the early copies have been
sent to places in the world I've hardly heard of.''

Council.

I had to go in, do the work, and fight for it. Really fight for it!
What I really am is dogged. I'm a worker. I pursue things persistently.
Phil Penfold meets the actress best known for her portrayal as Annie
Hall who has laid claim to the director's chair for an inspired and
critically acclaimed movie
IT IS raining and the sky is darkly overcast. ''It looks,'' says Diane
Keaton, ''like a bad luck omen.'' She has to be joking. Unstrung Heroes,
her much-praised debut as a big-time movie director, has just opened in
America and the buzz is almost uniformly positive. Just as it was back
in May when the final credits on the film rolled and the Theatre Claude
Debussy at the Cannes Film Festival filled with the kind of applause
most directors only dream about.
Mind you, the film does boast flavour-of-the-moment actress Andie
MacDowell. She is paired with John Turturro and they play a 1950s
husband and wife with emotional and physical problems. It is a movie
about mothers and fathers and children and dying -- and the mystery of
it all. The hero is a 12-year-old boy, alienated from his father, trying
to survive while his mother fades away.
The script, based on a book by Franz Lidz, had Keaton ''crying for
hours after I first read it; it was beautiful. But I didn't want to make
something that pulled on the heartstrings and nothing else. The casting
was all-important, and Andie was my first choice as soon as I was
onboard''.
MacDowell's role was ''terrifically demanding'' says Keaton. ''But she
pulls if off so well. Finding her son was very difficult indeed. New
York is full of child wannabe actors. So I really put Nathan Watt
through it before we signed him up. He came to so many readings that he
can't have liked me very much!''
She was attracted to Unstrung Heroes because of the mother, who is
wonderfully played by MacDowell as the very essence of motherhood. The
mother is the very heart of the piece, according to Keaton, who says she
has very strong personal feelings about her own mother, ''a very special
person to me. I wanted to make Andie the kind of mother you want,
somebody you just couldn't stand to see die''.
Keaton's own 73-year-old mother, Dorothy, is still very much alive,
although her father, Jack Hall, died five years ago. His illness -- he
had an inoperable brain tumour -- brought Keaton back home to Los
Angeles, where she now lives alone with only her dogs and a Land Rover
in a house in the Hollywood Hills once owned by the silent-screen star
Ramon Navarro.
She says: ''I wanted to be closer to my mother, my sisters, my
brother, all of whom -- with one exception -- live in California.'' Time
is precious, declares Keaton, important. She does not want to miss any
moment she can have with her family.
Howeer, she admits nowadays she has to work hard; much harder since
her stardom dimmed somewhat in the 90s. She says she is much more aware
of working harder. The roles have been difficult to come by for the
actress who will always be etched in our memories as Annie Hall. Once in
a while, the roles aren't too hard to find, she says, mentioning her
latest acting vehicle, Father of the Bride II (in which she again
co-stars with Steve Martin). But that's a sequel, she says. Everything
else has been hard to get.
''I had to go in there and audition for Unstrung Heroes,'' she
confesses. Audition? ''Well, meet the producers and tell them what I
visualised it as. They seemed to agree with me . . . so I got the job! I
had to go in, do the work, and fight for it. Really fight for it! What I
really am is dogged. I'm a worker. I pursue things persistently.''
She never announced her intention to direct. She just started doing it
quietly, mainly because of her abiding love of photography. She started
with rock videos (Belinda Carlisle's Heaven Is a Place on Earth) and an
after-school special for children, working her way up to episodes of
Twin Peaks. Her first directorial project, Heaven, got truly hellish
reviews from the critics.
Heaven featured all sorts of people talking about their idea of what
the celestial neverland might be like. ''It took me to all sorts of very
strange homes,'' she recalls. ''I thought actors had bizarre lives, but
boy, you should see some of the locations there! Which made me realise
that the look, the design of a movie, is also very important.''
This is a woman, of course, who has perfected her own trademark look.
This is a woman who has specialised in ditsy, strung-up heroines. In her
most acclaimed work she has transformed self-doubt and high enxiety into
performance art. A sort of one-woman comedy of manners. This is also a
woman who has never conformed to bosomy, movie-star expectations. She
has hidden in whimsical, thrift-shop, high-neck wardrobes, subdued her
sex appeal under a series of chic Chaplinesque bowlers, ''hiding out
like a recluse in the residential hotel called Hollywood,'' as someone
once remarked. A rebel with clothes.
At 49, she says, the things they mythologised about her are over.
Although, the residue remains, like wearing too many eccentric clothes,
hiding out, being insecure, not finishing a sentence . . .
Today, Keaton is dressed in a cool grey suit and cream polo-necked
wool sweater. Her blonde hair is expensively cut around her face, the
fringe is overlong, and she peers at you through clunky round glasses
with metal frames, which are perched perilously on the end of her nose.
Woody Allen's Annie Hall has appeared in some of the classic films of
the last two decades. Manhattan Murder Mystery, Father of The Bride,
Reds, Looking For Mr Goodbar . . . And, of course all three movies in
The Godfather trilogy. Who can forget her in Manhattan breaking down
over the unavailability of her analyst (''Donny's in a coma. He had a
very bad acid experience'')? Or the moment in Shoot the Moon, when
Keaton as the abandoned wife, sits in the bath getting stoned and softly
singing an old Beatles song as the tears fall?
Diane Keaton grew up watching movie greats like ''Katharine Hepburn,
Irene Dunne, Jean Arthur -- all the ladies who could do comedy so well.
It never entered my mind that I would be anything but an actress, so
when I found myself on the set of The Godfather, overwhelmed and
consumed by truly great actors, I then thought how impertinent I was!
''Working with Coppola was an experience I'll never forget. He's a
gift to a player on his set. Working with Woody Allen is different
again, but just as elevating. I couldn't possibly hope to aspire to his
greatness. I haven't got his imagination or his vision. But one thing I
learned from him as a director was basically to leave actors alone.
Don't mess them around.
''Curiously, you do find yourself distanced from your performers when
you direct, because you have so many other responsibilities as well . .
. answering to producers, getting the thing in on budget, looking at the
location, seeing that everything is perfect. Telling performers what to
do is the least of it!
''So as an actor, you hope you bond with all your peers, and make an
ensemble. As a director, the barrier inevitably comes down between you
both. Sad, but there it is -- you can't be pals with your cast. And, of
course, a director has to look at every frame, every image on film of
their project. As an actress, I never ever see anything. I can't bear
watching any of that. I see the finished product once, and that's it --
nothing else ever again.''
She wasn't there to hear the Cannes Film Festival audience's responce
to Unstrung Heroes. You would think a director might enjoy watching her
movie with an audience. ''But I absolutely never want to do that again.
I'm too sensitive about the response. I can't take it!''
Nevertheless, she really enjoyed making the movie and ''definitely
wants'' to do more, ''blending acting and directing if at all possible.
But, no, I cannot pretend that I was sorry when we wrapped. Five months
of solid responsibility and hard work, even in the company of people you
really like, is enough. I remember that final day, my jaw was so set and
tense I could have screamed. My assistant director, who never ever
drinks -- he's absolutely teetotal -- went out that night and got so
smashed, he was incoherent. That's what it was like.''
BECAUSE of her?''I hope not,'' she laughs. ''No, I don't think so.
Because of everything. The wrap was a blessed event, believe me.'' So
directing is what? ''Telling stories,'' she declares firmly. ''Mixed
with work, work, work, work. Woody is my idol -- he has a great bullshit
detector. He looks and watches and knows when to leave you alone as well
as when to offer encouragement.''
What's next? ''I'm doing a very sad, poignant film with first-time
director Gerry Zacks, called Marvin's Room, with Meryl Streep and Robert
De Niro. I shall certainly appreciate what Gerry has to go through; I
don't envy him.'' Then she starts filming The First Wives Club with
Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn. ''I'm always busy; I can't not do
things.''
''And yes, I do have time for a private life. Though what that is, I'm
certainly not going to share with you -- constant night clubbing, it's
not.''
She has been romanced by some of Hollywood's bigest names -- Woody
Allen, Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, but always tells interviewers that she
''can't talk'' about those men.
Still, Miss Keaton, I did like Unstrung Heroes a lot, and I tell her
so.
''I love you!'' she trills. And, before you can say ''la-di-da'', I
get a kiss on the cheek. Being snogged on a dreich day by Diane Keaton
proves that life isn't so bad after all.
