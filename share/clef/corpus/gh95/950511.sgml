BARCELONA-based French golfer Marie-Laure de Lorenzi rolled back the
years when she fashioned a sixteenth European victory in the American
Express Costa Azul Open in Portugal.
A closing round of 66 in which she never exceeded par to equal the
course record at Montado left de Lorenzi with an 11-under-par total of
205, two ahead of Switzerland's Evelyn Orley.
In 1988, de Lorenzi established a Tour record with seven victories.
''I was more aggressive and holed a lot of putts then, but I believe
that I am now more experienced and hitting the ball much better,'' she
said.
Lora Fairclough, second last year, was the leading British player
sharing fifth place on 213 with Scotland's Kathryn Marshall four strokes
behind leading the Tartan challenge.
Orley, chasing a first win since 1990, made a brave attempt to catch
de Lorenzi. She gathered four birdies and holed in one at the 139-yard
eleventh hole in a final round of 67, but it was not enough.
De Lorenzi threw down the gauntlet with four birdies in an outward 32.
A putt of 18 feet earned a 2 at the short eleventh before striking a
No.2 iron shot on to the green for a birdie 4 at the long sixteenth.
Marshall's undoing was a second round of 76 following an opening 69.
In the closing round the Monifieth golfer could muster only two birdies
in her 72. Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
205 -- M-L de Lorenzi (France) 72, 67, 66 (#8250).
207 -- E Orley (Switzerland) 68, 72, 67 (#5580).
208 -- C Dibnah (Australia) 67, 72, 69 (#3850).
212 -- K Webb (Australia) 67, 76, 69.
213 -- L Fairclough 73, 67, 73; V Michaud (France) 69, 69, 75.
Scottish scores: 217 -- K Marshall 69, 76, 72. 219 -- D Reid 75, 73,
71. 223 -- G Stewart 74, 77, 72. 225 -- T Craik 74, 77, 74; L Irvine 76,
74, 75.
* KELLY Robbins overcame miserable weather and a three-shot deficit
over the final seven holes yesterday in Wilmington, Delaware, to win the
LPGA Championship by one shot from holder Laura Davies of Britain.
The American won her third career tournament and first major with a
three-under-par 68, victory coming with a two-foot par putt at the last
to finish at 10-under 274 and win the $180,000 top prize.
Davies shot a 70 -- 15 pars, one bogey, and two birdies but had to
settle for the $111,711 second-place purse.

ANDY Monteith is one of those lucky guys who has played his cricket in
both hemispheres. He is the first to admit that the club-style game in
Perth, Western Australia, and that for Strathmore County at Forfar, not
that far from Perth, Scotland, may not be the highest level in the
world, but he's enjoyed every minute of it.
The batsmen facing this medium pacer each week cannot claim something
similar. For example, last season's figures for the county champions had
him top of the averages with 31 wickets at an average cost of only 11.45
runs, with fie for 17 being his best display.
The 35-year-old, born in Abernethy in Perthshire, but who has spend
much of his life in Australia before returning five years ago, is still
wreaking havoc. Four for 25 against Aberdeenshire last week, four for 29
in the 26-run victory at Clackmannan on Saturday.
''Out in Australia, most of the club cricket is played on artificial
turf, so when I came back here, it took me some time to adjust. However,
I seem to have found the line and length.''
And he added: ''When I began my career, I was actually an opening
batsman, but gradually moved on to the bowling side.'' Possibly a reason
why he is so successful at out-guessing the opposition's openers these
days.
Clackmannan's Tom King was the only one to put up any resistance with
40, while Strathie's Mark Mudie, weighing in with three for 9, was the
final straw in the home side's total of 115.
Bowling honours as Strathmore had set a target of 141 on a
traditionally difficult wicket at The Arns went to Bruce Auchinleck with
a respectable five for 50, while Kevin Thomson showed his Strathmore
colleagues how it could be done despite the conditions with a fine 45.
Stirling County remain top of the league, despite their game at
Mannofield against Aberdeenshire being abandoned because of rain.
A solid battling performance by Stirling from Kyle Wealleans (39), Jon
Taylor (46) and Bruce Russell (44 not out) seemed to hae given them a
reasonable base at 170 for five. The heavens intervened with the home
side on 18 for one.
A lightning set of strikes by Aslam Raza with four for 11 destroyed
Perthshire at McKane Park as they slumped to 68 all out.
Fifeshire, with professional Ashok Malhotra stillin fine form with the
bat with 35, were given their main contribution from Wayne Sullivan, who
hit 55 in their total of 188. Ewan Ogilie weighing in with 40 also was a
major factor as Perthshire's Robin Crouch took three for 10 and Jimmy
Muir a bit more expensive on three for 53.
Dom Rigby hit 47 as Ayrshire's modest total of 124 still proved to be
too high for Forfarshire at Forthill. And that was despite excellent
figures from bowlers Bryce Robertson, with four for 30, and James
Girolami with fie for 46.
The main reason for the home side's meagre 57 is that David Harper was
in devastating form, taking six for 17, which even managed to put Drew
Parsons' three for 13 in the shade.
Amazingly, considering the other results, the runs positively flowed
at Boghall -- all 400 plus of them -- where West Lothian and Arbroath
County batted themselves into a draw.
For the home side, Sanjay Patel hit 84 and David Fleming 56, while the
unbeaten 109 from Arbroath's George Salmond speaks for itself. His was
the only county century of the day.
Strathmore and Ayrshire take up second and third place, and with the
free-flowing West Lothian taking on the champions -- and Andy Monteith
-- at Lochside Park, and Prestwick Oval the venue for the visit of
Arbroath, who's to say that situation won't change by this time next
week.

WITHOUT a win since last year's Tennant Cup, Graham Rankin proved
worthy of his place in the Scottish team when yesterday at Stirling he
won the West of Scotland Open by six shots.
The Palacerigg man, runner-up in the event two years ago, almost shot
a course record. But a birdie putt at the seventeenth lipped out, as did
a 15-foot eagle effort at the last, and the 29-year-old had to be
content with a closing six-under-par 66 for victory from Scottish Boys'
Champion Steven Young (Inverallochy), who finished with a two-under 70.
Craig Hislop (Powfoot), after a course-record 65 on Saturday, closed
with a 74 for a share of fourth.
Rankin, who avoided any bogeys in his final two rounds, said: ''I have
been hitting the ball well for about five weeks now, even though my
results haven't shown that.'' Leading aggregates:
273 -- G Rankin (Palacerigg) 69, 68, 70, 66.
279 -- S Young (Inverallochy) 72, 67, 70, 70.

GRAHAM Cowdrey's eleventh boundary, off the last ball of the match,
gave Kent -- last season's AXA Equity and Law League runners-up -- a
four-wicket win over Leicestershire at Canterbury.
The four capped a tremendous innings of 92 not out off just 68 balls
and gave Kent their second successive victory.
But it was cruel for Leicester skipper Nigel Briers, who was the
cornerstone of his side's innings. He carried his bat for an unbeaten
108 in Leicestershire's total of 235 for five.
Graham Lloyd slammed a 50-ball half-century as Lancashire reinforced
their title ambitions with a five-wicket win over champions Warwickshire
at Old Trafford.
Lloyd, who dislocated a finger while fielding, showed no sign of
discomfort, blasting his way to 50 not out to guide the home side to
victory with 15 balls to spare.
A half-century from Peter Bowler and an invaluable 23 not out from
Pakistan Test star Mushtaq Ahmed, who hit the winnings runs, helped
Somerset to a two-wicket win off the last ball at Northampton.
Northamptonshire had made 195 for seven, thanks largely to an unbeaten
48 from former England all-rounder David Capel. Australian Tom Moody
struck a magnificent half-century as Worcestershire crushed Middlesex by
77 runs at New Road.
Moody, who hit 106 in the Sunday League opener against Essex last
week, was in destructive mood, his 57 coming from 74 balls. That helped
the home side to reach 199 for six and it took them just 33.3 overs to
dismiss Middlesex for 122.
Batting was again difficult at Chesterfield, where Yorkshire beat
Derbyshire by 59 runs. The visitors struggled to make 167 for seven,
with Allan Warner picking up four for 14, and Derbyshire, who lost the
championship match between the counties inside three days, collapsed to
108 all out in 32.4 overs.
Peter Hartley, who claimed a career-best nine for 41 yesterday, bowled
a miserly two for seven in six overs.
Alistair Brown's 79 helped Surrey to a seven-wicket victory over
Durham at The Oval. Brown smacked three 6s and passed 2000 runs in the
Sunday League as Surrey reached their target with 4.5 overs to spare.
Earlier, Tony Pigott took three for 34 to help restrict Durham to 189
for eight.
Glamorgan, champions in 1993, cruised to a nine-wicket victory over
Sussex at Swansea. After the visitors had been dismissed for 132,
Glamorgan's second-wicket pair of Stephen James and Matthew Maynard
shared an unbroken stand of 124 to steer their side home.
New Zealand Test star Chris Cairns' 45 proved crucial as
Nottinghamshire beat Gloucestershire by four wickets with four balls to
spare at Bristol. In a match reduced to 33 overs by rain,
Gloucestershire were dismissed for 115 in 30.2 overs, with former
Lincolnshire bowler Jon Wileman taking four for 21.

HOLDERS Forfarshire made a winning start to the defence of the Whyte &amp;
Mackay Scottish Cup yesterday when they defeated Freuchie at Forthill by
eight runs. Peter Drinnen made 62, Bruce Ferrier 37, and a quick 37 from
Angus Hay saw Forfarshire to 209 for seven. Freuchie's reply swung one
way then the other, until they needed 12 off the last over, and 10 from
the last two balls.
Chris Hepplewhite lofted Barry Stewart's penultimate delivery towards
the boundary. However, instead of a glorious 6, Hepplewhite found Hay on
the ropes to end the contest.
Poloc, runners-up 12 months ago, are in the same group as Forfarshire.
And they too began the round-robin section with a 179-run win against
Border League side Dumfries.
David Nairn opened the Poloc innings and gave them a superb start.
From the off, Nairn smashed everything that came his way, crashing 57
from just 37 balls. The momentum was continued by Sajid Ali, who for the
second day on the trot made 83.
Skipper Brian Spence scored 44 as the Shawholm side piled up 262 for
eight from their 50 overs. Dumfries never came close to challenging that
total, with Ian Holten and Ronnie McGregor claiming four wickets each as
the visitors were bowled out for 83 in 31.2 overs.
There were mixed fortunes for the other Borders representatives.
Robert Haynes hit 84 to see Kelso to a four-wicket win against West
Lothian, but Berwick lost at The Tryst where Stenhousemuir were the
victors by six wickets.
Berwick made 157, having looked set for a bigger tally until Terry
Leahy produced a three-wicket over. Graham Gardner (71 not out) and John
Bell (40 not out) then shared an unbeaten fifth wicket stand of 92 to
see their side home.
Jon Williams hit an undefeated 105, joining in a second-wicket
partnership of 87 with Nigel Clarke and an unbroken stand of 114 with
Craig Wright (47 not out) as West of Scotland reached 237 for two
against Gordonians, who were pegged to 147 for eight in reply.
New Zealander Mike Pawson conceeded just 10 runs from his 11 overs, in
addition to his four wickets, as Ferguslie limited GHK to 110 for nine.
Pawson then added a half-century to see his side home by five wickets,
while Strathmore had little trouble in seeing off East Kilbride by 10
wickets.
Grange collected this piece of silverware in four successive seasons
between 1990 and 1993. But their chances of reaching the knockout stages
were dealt a blow by Drumpellier, the Coatbridge side running out
winners by six wickets.
The Aberdeenshire-Ayrshire match may be replayed having been cancelled
after two members of the Ayrshire side had their vehicles set on fire at
Broughty Ferry overnight. Skipper Andy Tennant had his car destroyed,
which included his playing kit and that of two team-mates.

* WITH rounds of 71, 74, and 77 for a collective total of 222 -- just
11 over the day's standard scratch score -- Scottish Life headed the
Lothians NCO Team Tournament at Haddington yesterday.
Six non-course-owning teams reached the Lothians final at Musselburgh
and Royal Musselburgh on 29 July. Leading scores:
222 -- Scottish Life. 227 -- Bank of Scotland. 228 -- Lochcraig,

POISED Ernie Els compiled four birdies in the final six holes to win
the $1.3m Byron Nelson Classic by three strokes in Dallas yesterday.
South African Els recorded a tournament record low 17-under-par 263
total in stifling heat and humidity.
It was not easy, however, for the US Open champion, who surrendered a
three-stroke lead before storming back with his late birdie blitz.
A good par-save at the twelfth kept Els within one stroke of the lead
and proved to be the turning point. He then birdied Nos 13, 14, 16, and
18 for a two-under-par 68.
Americans D A Weibring (65), Mike Heinen (66), and Robin Freeman (68)
tied for second on 266, while Britain's Nick Faldo finished equal
twenty-first, nine strokes behind after a 66 that included six birdies.
''I was scrambling the first nine and when I three-putted No.11, I
thought it was slipping away,'' said Els, who received $234,000. Final
scores (US players unless stated):
263 -- Ernie Els (South Africa) 69, 61, 65, 68.
266 -- D A Weibring 65, 69, 67, 65; Mike Heinen 67, 66, 67, 66; Robin
Freeman 65, 65, 68, 68.
268 -- Jay Don Blake 64, 69, 69, 66; Scott Verplank 67, 69, 67, 65;
Kenny Perry 65, 66, 70, 67; Gil Morgan 68, 66, 68, 66.
269 -- Loren Roberts 68, 67, 69, 65; Bob Tway 68, 66, 69, 66.
270 -- Steve Lowery 72, 67, 69, 72; Keith Fergus 67, 66, 71, 66; Mark
Brooks 68, 66, 69, 67; Craig Stadler 66, 67, 68, 69; Glen Day 63, 69,
67, 71.
Europeans: 272 -- Nick Faldo (England) 66, 71, 69, 66. 274 -- Jesper

AJAX clinched the Dutch league title when they beat Volendam 4-1 at
Amsterdam's Olympic Stadium yesterday.
It was the twenty-fifth league title for Ajax, who play AC Milan in
the Champions League final later this month. The Amsterdam outfit twice
beat the Italian holders in the qualifying stage of the competition.
Ajax remain unbeaten in the Dutch league and the victory secured
back-to-back titles for the first time since the two successive triumphs
in 1982 and 1983.
Goals from Frank de Boer in the nineteenth minute, Danny Blind in the
forty-eighth, Ronald de Boer in the sixty-seventh and Jari Litmanen
eight minutes from time sealed victory in front of 40,000 fans.

* A DOUBLE century opening partnership between Iain Sutcliffe and
Chinmay Gupte -- their second in successive days -- ensured Oxford
University a comprehensive 112-run victory over Cambridge University in
the first one-day Varsity match at Fenner's yesterday.
The Oxford pair, who put on 283 against Hampshire on Saturday, scored
204 in 43 overs after Oxford had won the toss in the 55-over contest. If
that was not enough to ensure victory, a rapid 63 off 27 balls by Oxford
skipper Gregor Macmillan made sure the game was beyond Cambridge's
reach.
Cambridge did not help themselves by dropping four catches and being
guilty of sloppy fielding as Oxford sprinted to 329 for six. The target
was never likely and Cambridge made only 217 all out.

WASPISH critics used to say of Lloyd-Webber musicals that the audience
emerged humming the scenery.
There was something of that flavour about the Ryden East League match
at Grange Loan on Saturday where the cricket was of a quality that
reduced everyone to talking about the magnificence of the setting.
Wickets fell to indifferent deliveries met with ill-judged shots, and
fielding frailties were all too frequent. Ultimately the outcome hinged
on the performances of the professionals.
Robin Singh held the Carlton innings together with 68 before a leading
edge yielded a catch to mid-off. With solid support from Jim Govan's 35,
the target was 184. Watsonians' West Indian recruit, John Pollard,
claimed five for 43 and Robbie Gilmour chipped in with four wickets.
Honours were thus around even at the interval.
When the roles were reversed, Singh was soon among the wickets,
including an athletic return catch to dismiss Steve Lockhart.
Pollard soon became the key figure and he battled to 59, surviving a
stumping chance and a dropped catch before succumbing leg before to
Govan. But he lacked any decent support and Watsonians' reply
disintegrated as Singh accounted for six of them and Govan three.
Meanwhile, at Stenhousemuir, Falkland required 52 overs to accumulate
113 for six, a total surpassed without difficulty by the home side, Ian
Philip contributing an unbeaten 67. There was more of the same at
Raeburn Place where Corstorphine crawled to 118 all out in 48 overs,
Graham Hurlbatt knocking over five for 43. Gordon McGurk and Alec Davies
steered Grange home comfortably.
The highest scoring match was at Barnton where Royal High helped
themselves to all the twos, providing the Heriot's batsmen with
something to get their teeth into. Ian McKinlay and Mike Allingham rose
splendidly to the challenge and Heriot's cruised home with eight wickets
to spare, McKinlay undefeated on 79.
However, the examination set by Edinburgh Academicals at Freuchie was
inadequate to ruffle the home side and with Dave Cowan again in scoring
form (44 not out), the victory points were well harvested.

FOUR of AC Milan's most experienced players -- Franco Baresi, Paulo
Maldini, Roberto Donadoni, and Degan Savicevic -- have agreed new
contracts to boost morale within the Italian camp before the fortieth
Champion Clubs' Cup final with Ajax on May 24 in Vienna.
There also has been a change of heart over Gian-Luigi Lentini, who was
made available for transfer only six weeks ago.
Sampdoria's offer of #5m for the player who cost #13m was rejected
because of his improved form.
Coach Fabio Capello said: ''He is on his way back after the car crash
which almost killed him. There is still the chance for him to prove he
is still among the best players in the world.''

TWO German clubs, Dynamo Dresden and FC Saarbrucken, have been
banished from the Bundesliga to the amateur ranks for failing to clear
their debts.
This extreme sanction applied by the German FA is in line with the
policy within UEFA to ensure clubs balance their books or be ineligible
to play in their major leagues.
Between them, Dresden and Saarbrucken had a combined debt of #20m. In
the case of Dresden, once run by the Stasi, the East German secret
police, there was particular concern that, from the #6m received from
the transfers of two of their players, Ulf Kirsten (to Bayer Leverkusen)
and Matthias Sammer (VfB Stuttgart), not a penny reached their bank
account.
A spokesman for the German FA, who investigated the deals which took
place when East and West were being integrated, said: ''We are clearing
out all the rotten apples in the barrel.
''Our football is blossoming once again and we are determined this
growth will not be affected by any further financial scandals. The game
must be kept healthy and clean.
''Leagues in other countries should be aware that such reckless
behavior can undermine their foundations.''
Both clubs have appealed the decision. They will be heard on Friday
but have no chance of having it overturned.
FC Nurnberg, St Pauli, and Herta Berlin also came under scutiny but
were allowed another year to improve their financial standing.
* DIEGO Maradona is considering re-launching his career in America
after having resigned as coach of Racing Club in Argentina. His decision
to quit came after his mentor, Juan Destefano, failed to be re-elected
as president.
New York Centaurs, one of the clubs in the newly-formed A league in
the USA, whose season began yesterday, have offered him #1.3m to make a
comeback when the suspension imposed for drug-taking offences during the
World Cup expires in September.
Maradona would then be able to participate in the play-offs if New
York Centaurs were involved. The prospect certainly appeals to the
striker whose entire career has been steeped in controversy.
''I am excited that there are people who still want me and believe in
my ability,'' he said yesterday. ''I started very well in the World Cup
but FIFA robbed me of my hopes for success. This move would provide the
opportunity to make up for the many disappointments last summer.''
Yet more trouble is awaiting Maradona. A court in Mercedes has ruled
that, if he is found guilty of firing an airgun at journalists last
year, he will go to jail.
* FORMER Arsenal manager George Graham, sacked earlier this season, is
another who could make a return to the game.
The Scot is in line for the manager's post at Atletico Bilbao along
with the Dane Morten Olsen, who is currently with FC Cologne.
The Spanish club originally wanted Sweden's national coach Tommy
Svensson but he has opted to remain put and proceed with the
increasingly difficult task in qualifying for the European
Championships.
* BELGIUM and Holland will be confirmed later this month as joint
hosts for the European Championships in the year 2000. The principle of
two countries staging a major championship is likely to be adopted for
the World Cup Finals.
UEFA president Lennart Johannson explained: ''With 32 nations now
competing in these finals, only 10 countries in the world are capable of
organising it.
''If this change does not follow, it would mean the event always going
to the same countries which is not good for football.''
UEFA will also issue new instructions to referees this summer to crack
down on foul play, allowing them a year to implement them before the
championships in England.

GREENOCK and Poloc had both started the new season with two wins from
as many starts. When they met at Glenpark on Saturday, one of them could
have secured outright leadership of the DM Hall Western Union. Instead,
they played out an uninteresting draw, enabling Progress Software
Clydesdale to take over top slot.
At Glenpark, Poloc had first use of the wicket, with Sajid Ali looking
a class apart. Already with a century and a 50 in his two previous
championship innings, Sajid knocked out another half-ton, his 76 the
leading score in the Poloc innings of 185 for nine.
Greenock did not look likely to overtake that target, or for that
matter, be bowled out. After 29 overs, the Union winners of two years
ago had crawled to 62 for one. By then the draw was inevitable, and
while Poloc knocked a few wickets over, Greenock were never in trouble.
Meanwhile, Clydesdale moved into pole position with a simple
six-wicket win against Uddingston at Titwood. The Lanarkshire men again
batted for an additional four overs to total 163 with four wickets down,
Scotland opener George Reifer remaining unbeaten on 83, Sandy Bawa
adding 25.
Clydesdale's chase was led by international all-rounder Greig
Williamson. Aamir Hanif and Rennie Keith played the supporting roles,
leaving opener Williamson to stroke his way to 70, with just 36 overs
needed to complete the win.
West of Scotland are not having the happiest of times this season,
with more pain inflicted by Tilbury Pheonix Kelburne at Hamilton
Crescent. On a difficult batting track, Alan Williamson came in at No.7,
his 67 helping the home side to recover from 40 for six to 142 all out,
a total boosted by 22 extras. Most of those were conceeded by the rapid
Roger Telemachus who struggled to bowl a standard six-ball over, the
South African professional overstepping no fewer than 14 times.
Telemachus did however, pick up four wickets for 46 runs before Alan
''Archie'' Gemmell and Dougie Wylie picked up their bats, remaining
undefeated on 57 and 46 repsectively to see Kelburne home by seven
wickets.
Paisley neighbours Ferguslie looked on course to upset champions Ayr
at Meikleriggs when on a softish wicket the holders made just 104.
Adrian Holdstock managed 34, one of only three players to make double
figures as Gary McLaughlan and Kiwi Mike Pawson took four wickets
apiece. Ayr though, were far from beaten.
Marty Haywood may have earned much of the credit for the Cambusdoon
club winning the Union title last term, but others made sizeable
contributions in that triumph. Pace man Andy Baird was one of the unsung
heroes, his 39 wickets helping in no small part to that success. And
'Bairdseye' was again on target at the weekend.
By the time Brian Shaw walked to the wicket, the hosts were rocking on
30 for five. But in tandem with pro Pawson, Shaw nudged Ferguslie to 66
before the wickets started to tumble again. Pawson's 47 dominated the
reply as the locals lost their last four wickets and the match with the
scoreboard stranded on 71, Baird bombing out the last three to end with
six for 46 off 17.2 overs.
His however, wasn't the best bowling stint of the day. That honour
instead went to former Scotland seam bowler Billy McPate, who skittled
out Kilmarnock for 85, ending with match-winning figures of eight for 34
to give Drumpellier their maiden win of the season.

SCOTLAND'S rugby players leave tomorrow for the Rugby World Cup in
South Africa where, during the month-long competition, they will have an
unlikely ally in Richard Gough, who will be back in the country where he
grew up.
It was typical of the former Scottish football side's captain that he
was willing to speak out in support of the move to make rugby
professional.
Having fallen foul of the SFA during his career -- a much-documented
difference of opinion between the Rangers captain and former manager
Andy Roxburgh helped cut short his international career -- the prospect
of making a few moustaches bristle in indignation within rugby's
corridors of power was never likely to bother Gough.
''I know some of the Scottish players, especially Craig Chalmers, and
I've met Gavin Hastings on occasions,'' he said. ''I admire them all
because they work extremely hard at their sport while also holding down
jobs, and being a sportsman myself I can appreciate how tough that must
be.
''Now they are about to go into a major competition against sides like
South Africa and New Zealand, whose administrations perhaps take a more
lenient view towards payments while by comparison our players get petrol
money. They have been exploited long enough.''
Gough did call it precisely the way he saw it, and although he was
crossing into another sporting domain, he spoke from a position of some
knowledge having been a rugby player during his school days in
Johannesburg. ''It's my second sport and I'm glad South Africa have been
welcomed back into the sporting world,'' he said.
Imagine what might have happened had he preferred the oval ball. The
infamous head-to-head with Roxburgh in Glasgow Airport on return from a
particularly traumatic international match a few years ago could have
been Gough v Duncan Paterson but for a twist of fate.
All in the realms of conjecture, of course, but it can be assumed with
a fair degree of certainty that Gough's forthright views would not have
been appreciated or tolerated.
The chances are he wouldn't have lasted long, but at least the world
would not have had to wait for Will Carling to take the wind out of the
sails of the chaps who run rugby.
Gough will be in Cape Town visiting his mother, Lisa, during the group
stages of the world cup while the Scots will be based in Pretoria in the
north of the country, but he will be following their progress against
the Ivory Coast, Tonga, and France through television, the newspapers,
and his father, Charlie, who lives in Johannesburg. ''He's been there
for 30 years and has South African citizenship of course, but he's still
a Scot and both of us would like to see Scotland win, but I think the
winners will be New Zealand or Australia.
''I believe Scotland can qualify from their group and reach the
quarter-finals, but I'm praying the English don't win. I couldn't handle
that.''
The English, of course, will be well supported during the tournament,
but Gough said the Scots may be pleasantly surprised by the level of
support for them. ''There are a lot of Scots in South Africa, and the
northern parts are not short of a Scottish influence which should help
the cause a little,'' he said.
''I believe Scotland will have a good welcome in the country where
they will find most of the people well-mannered and educated. Also, as
everyone knows, things are changing for the better because apartheid was
wrong, but when I was growing up I had to live with the problems
associated with that kind of system.
''Children didn't realise there was something wrong until they started
going to different schools. There were schools for black kids, schools
for English-speaking white children, and then there were the Afrikaans
schools.
''In fact, it was almost like the religious problem in Scotland with
Catholic and Protestant children playing as friends and then attending
different schools, and it's probably only then they begin to realise
there is something different about them. I don't think that should be
happening to children at all anywhere.''
While Gough was at an English-speaking primary school in Johannesburg
he played football, but at all secondary schools the sport was rugby.
It was compulsory, and if anyone wished to continue playing soccer he
had to find a club. Gough left home and headed for Dundee where he
signed for United, and although he walked out a couple of times because
he was homesick, he eventually settled.
''I think that being on my own at that age helped make me mature and
perhaps that is also why I tend to be single-minded about most things I
do in my life,'' he said. ''Although I did get very homesick at times I
can now look at players who might come from Abrdeen down to Glasgow and
feel homesick, and think to myself that I didn't do too badly. After
all, I wasn't just down the motorway from home, I was 6000 miles away.
''I suppose it was also a help that with my father being in the Army I
was brought up in a very disciplined way.''
Gough, who was born in Stockholm, is recuperating from an operation on
the toes of his right foot which he had done a couple of weeks ago after
Rangers had won their seventh successive premier division championship.
He could have waited until after the last match, but he has learned
that injuries should be treated as soon as possible to avoid aggravation
and perhaps more severe problems.
His current injury is the same type as the one which cut short his
time in the 1990 World Cup finals only then the toes on his left foot
were giving him problems. Surgeons then as now, had to cut in and work
on nerves between his toes but last time he left it too late and was out
of action for some time.
The 33-year-old prides himself on his physical condition and intends
playing on as long as he possibly can, but talk of the World Cup in
South Africa brings home his longing for the old country. ''I'll go back
and settle there, I don't know exactly when, but I'll return,'' he said.
''It may depend on what opportunities present themselves when I finish
playing football, but all being equal I would want to go back in four or
five years provided, of course, the country develops properly now that
change has come.
''At the moment I don't know if South Africa is a better place to
live, but it is certainly a fairer place than it was, and if I believe I
could provide a good and secure environment for my wife, Fiona, and our
family then we will go.
My mother went back to Sweden for a couple of years, but she returned
to South Africa and settled in Cape Town because I think she missed
waking up in the mornings and seeing blue skies. It is a beautiful
country.
''However, there are more trophies to be won with Rangers before the
day comes when I will go back, although it will be exciting being there
over the next few weeks watching the rugby.''

A NOT-so-young anymore, clean cut, unremarkable couple appear and
their fans break into rapturous applause. The cheering is reminiscent of
a Beatles concert at the height of their fame. The majority of the
ecstatic fans are middle-aged women. Certainly, men are thin on the
ground.
In childhood, boys are eager to follow, follow in Ally McCoist's
footsteps or emulate heroes like John Wayne and Biggles. Girls see
National Velvet once and plan a career in showjumping. Alternatively
they watch skaters with sparkling dresses and their partners in bow
ties, interpreting music ranging from Stravinsky to Little Richard, and
are lost in the desire to appear in the spotlight.
Last week thousands of the wannabees of yesteryear were at Glasgow's
SECC to cheer on Torvill and Dean when their Face the Music Farewell
Tour rolled along.
Ice dancing falls into a strange sporting category. Like synchronised
swimming it brings out scathing condemnation (mainly from men) or
unrestrained enthusiasm (mainly from women). Last week the latter were
to the fore.
The British public have an almost ghoulish interest in the lives of
the skating pair who originated in Nottingham, on and off the ice. For
years they had played the boy and girl next door card and their fans
wondered, just wondered, if the fairytale would have a happy ending.
Like Coronation Street, the romances and tragedies of the King and
Queen of Ice have been chewed over and discussed ad nauseum. Then Dean
married and split up from French-Canadian skater Isabelle Duchesnay and
chose America for his next liaison, with skater Jill Trenary. Torvill
married too, to Phil Christiansen. The fairytale romance was not to be.
Since they first set out together in 1975, Torvill and Dean have won
medals galore. Their interpretations including the remarkable maximum
score of nine 6.0s for artistic impression for their performance of
Bolero on their way to Olympic Gold in Sarajevo in 1984. Years of tours
on the professional circuit followed.
Their decision to return to competitive skating in 1993 was greeting
with undiluted joy. What heroes. The dream was shattered in Lillehammer,
where they scraped a bronze medal and the Russian pair walked off with
the gold.
The preparations for their return to competition weren't without
incident either. Christopher Dean has the unsympathetic approach of an
unrelenting perfectionist. A recent documentary watched them at practice
as he berated Jayne Torvill for not trying. In tears, she protested. A
skate embedded in his sternum would have been a better riposte.
However, there can be no doubting the professionalism of Britain's
leading skating pair or the international troupe with them on their
tour. The company includes skaters from Russia, Canada, America, and
Sweden. Torvill and Dean have taken ice dancing to a new level and their
fluid movements and finely choreographed dances are incomparable. The
crowds adore it.
But somehow there is an underlying tackiness. It is all just a touch
too glitzy and slick, a bit like Zeigfield Follies on ice.
The lighting system was superb, the outfits sparkled, and the routines
were executed with precision and panache. But the athleticism of the
skaters themselves was almost a by-product. To the strains of a
selection of Beatles tunes the skaters whirled round the ice while Dean
acted out the part of Paperback Writer with Torvill as his muse. One
particular routine was specially choreographed for women who may have
gone to the wrong show and was somewhat reminiscent of One Chippendale
on Ice.
But the greatest cheers were saved for the comfortably familiar and
faultless performances by the King and Queen themselves, ending with the
Let's Face the Music and Dance routine which ended their Olympic dream
in Norway.
Those used to the hype of pop concerts would not have been
disappointed. The glossy programme which raises the pair almost to
sainthood costs #5 and if inclined, instead of a tour T-shirt (although
they feature too) fans can always splash out on a fridge magnet,
binoculars, a tour jacket, or an embroidered ski hat. At least there
were no Torvill and Dean dolls with a selection of outfits, although who
knows, that might be next.
The caravan has moved on now but there is some good news for the
sprinkling of men who go to see it: there's no queue for the loo. A few
words of advice for the women: go before you go.

IN ''Windows of no opportunity'' (May 8), Jags fans Neil McLure and Dr
Colin Berry seem to be irked that, having turned up at an all-ticket
match (Celtic v Partick Thistle) without tickets, they were unable to
gain immediate entry.
First, in the case of most all-ticket games anywhere else, this would
have meant no admittance, full stop.
Secondly, it was a condition of Celtic's tenure of Hampden this season
that, to satisfy the police and nearby tenants, all their games would be
all-ticket.
As a Celtic supporter I attend virtually every away match the club
plays in Scotland -- almost all of which are all-ticket.
To do so, I must apply for a ticket on average four weeks in advance
of each fixture, money up front.
Frequently, after going through this procedure, I arrive at grounds to
find sections of the stadium allocated to home supports half-empty --
notably at Firhill, for example.
I remember fondly when all that was required was to turn up with the
admission money, but times change.
It seems Mr McLure and Dr Berry are unwilling to change with them.

IN your issue of May 5, your Chief Rugby Correspondent states: ''a
semi-professional position.'' There is no such position, neither is
there any ''semi-amateur status.'' There are two categories in sport,
honest professionalism and honest amateurism.
Unfortunately, in recent years there has been an instrusion into many
athletic activities of ''sham-amateurism.'' It is to be hoped that the
governing bodies of rugby in Great Britain and Ireland, will reject this
dishonest and corrupt intrusion into the Corinthian Code.

DEREK Douglas recently referred to Craig Joiner and Kenny Logan as the
''glimmer twins.'' I am not sure that the two aforementioned players
would necessarily care to be compared to the original ''glimmer twins''
who were never noted for their athletic prowess. They, of course, being
Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.

IT is ironic that a sport like cricket which spans the globe and
involves players of all colours and creeds should be open to charges of
discrimination. And in such a hallowed institution as the Western Union
league.
Our story begins with the joining of forces of Western Union club
Kilmarnock and the Glasgow league side North Kelvinside Old Aloysians
(NKOA).
Kilmarnock, founded in 1852, and a venerable member of the Western
Union had fallen on hard times. They had been anchored at the foot of
the league for a number of years. There were no young players coming
through. As a mainly working-class club they had no wealthy sponsors.
Their ground, in the middle of an industrial estate, had been
subjected to systematic vandalism. Only the fact that the Western Union
is a closed shop, with no relegation, kept them in the top rank.
NKOA was a predominantly Asian club with aspirations to play at the
highest level in Scottish cricket. They had a rich source of young
players and no shortage of wealthy patrons. NKOA president Riaz Ahmed
approached Kilmarnock captain Alan Hill with a view to joining forces
and a mutually beneficial deal was done.
''It is not a merger,'' says Hill, ''but we now call the club
Kilmarnock NK to reflect the input from our new members. We have 20 new
playing members with five or six former NKOA players featuring in each
of our first and second teams.''
It has not taken Kilmarnock NK long to encounter Scottish cricket's
attitude which applied to the former NKOA. It can be summed up bluntly
that they are bunch of wily Asians, they all look the same, and who
knows what ringers they have brought along. Any NKOA player who hit a
bit of form was actually a Pakistan international who had been flown in
at great expense.
Thus it was that when Kilmarnock had a good game against West of
Scotland two weeks ago, their new player who took four wickets and
scored 43 runs, came under the microscope.
There was much nodding of heads when it was discovered that the
player, Idress, was a former pro in the Lancashire league and that,
while he had been reinstated as an amateur, his papers had not been
forwarded to the Western Union.
Kilmarnock NK were ordered to forfeit the points from the game. Hill
feels the punishment is harsh. He says the problem with the paperwork
was an oversight on his part.
The controversy will not help the process at Kilmarnock NK in which
two cultures are trying to come together in pursuit of a common love of
cricket. It was never going to be easy. The Asians tend to keep
themselves to themselves. They are definitely not going to swell the bar
takings.
But they do have something to contribute to the social life.
Kilmarnock NK has just had its first pakora night.
* MENTION the name, Aberdeen, and does the average Scottish football
fan think of the club's European glory days under Alex Ferguson? No. Do
they hark back to such kenspeckle players as Joe Harper and Gordon
Strachan? Probably not.
Mention Aberdeen and and various phrases containing the word, sheep,
usually spring to mind. Even when the setting is a religious service.
The Boys Brigade took over Fir Park, Motherwell, last weekend for an
event called the BBig Service.
Former BB boy Brian Irvine, the Aberdeen and Scotland defender, was
called upon to do a Bible reading. Hardly had he got halfway through his
delivery of Luke, chapter 15, verses one to 10, when there were
widespread smirks and the odd dunt in the ribs of the BB person in the
next seat.
Luke 15 is, of course, the bit about the sheep: ''What man of you
having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them doth not leave the
ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until
he findeth it?''
* IT did not come to pass that the Hearts of Midlothian were
despatched unto the First Division by the 3-1 defeat inflicted on them
by Hibernian. But the Hibs fans were revelling in the prospect. To the
extent that they picked up the VE Day theme and serenaded the Hearts
fans with a few choruses of ''We'll meet again, don't know where, don't
know when.''

I HAVE read John Beattie's article in your edition on the Monday after
the Scotland v Romania game on April 22 and I have now also read various
letters commenting thereon appearing in the edition of the following
Monday.
Could I please make the following points:
* Tickets were available to the public for the South Africa, Ireland,
and Wales games as well as for the Canada and Romania games, through
more than one outlet.
* Debenture tickets, when not taken up by a certain date by the
debenture holders, are made available to others.
* Clubs were advised that there were more tickets available for all
matches, they were asked for numbers, and many did in fact take up
additional tickets.
This season, therefore, tickets were available for the general public
and additional tickets were available for club members.

WITH the VE Celebrations fresh in our minds, it will come as a shock
that the Fascist Movement is alive and well, in the disguise of the 57

MOST of the nation spent yesterday afternoon gathered around
television sets to see the outcome of the Premiership title battle and
the latest struggle between two soccer legends from Glasgow.
Blackburn's Kenny Dalglish was the winner, taking the title away from
Manchester United's Alex Ferguson, despite a 2-1 defeat by his old club
Liverpool at Anfield in front of the supporters who still worship him.
It had been a title battle envied by most people north of the Border,
where we saw Rangers triumph weeks ago.
Ironically, it was those two gritty Glaswegians, Dalglish and
Ferguson, who gave the title down south a climax which could not have
been scripted better for the viewing public; two men from similar
working-class homes and backgrounds but from vastly different playing
careers, whose rivalry has been stage-managed into a feud by tabloid
journalists in the south.
What the English cannot recognise is that the two men were
pitch-forked into confrontation when Ferguson moved south to manage
United, while Dalglish was still in charge at Liverpool. The bitterness
between these two clubs rivals that which exists in Glasgow between
Celtic and Rangers.
Ferguson arrived at Old Trafford knowing that he had to restore the
club's former glories. To do that meant pushing Liverpool from the
position they enjoyed at the top of the heap.
Dalglish had the job of maintaining the rich run of success Liverpool
had enjoyed while he was a player. If that meant taking on Fergie, then
so be it. Neither man was ever inclined to walk away from a fight.
What the English don't know, of course, is that Dalglish and Ferguson
knew each other socially long before any rivalries began. When Fergie
was learning how to run a pub prior to opening his own shop in Glasgow,
it was Dalglish's future father-in-law, Pat Harkins, who taught him the
trade.
When Dalglish was receiving a deserved testimonial from the Scottish
Football Association, Fergie, then team manager, was hugely supportive.
There are other instances, too, of a rapport between these two
Glaswegians the English have often found difficult to understand, and
yet it's strange now to see them crossing swords once again for the
biggest prize in English football.
Dalglish is the most gifted player of his generation, winner of 102
Scottish caps and more than 20 medals with Celtic and Liverpool.
Ferguson won nothing as a player and ended his time at Rangers playing
for the third team in the half-holiday league after a fall-out with then
then manager Davie White. Ferguson was treated cruelly then, blamed for
losing a crucial goal in a Scottish Cup final against Celtic, and
shamefully jettisoned by the manager.
It was management which gave Ferguson his chance at glory and his list
of achievements can match those of anyone.
Dalglish, too, took a league-and-cup double in his first year as
manager at Liverpool. Now he has re-built Blackburn, and while critics
say he has simply bought his way to success, there is little difference
in the spending between himself and Ferguson.
There is little difference, too, in their uncompromising attitudes.
The late Jock Stein, no slouch at off-field propaganda, would have
enjoyed the outpourings from the rival camp this week. The Big Man would
have afforded himself a quiet chuckle or two as the two men, both
influenced by Stein's managerial magic, talked up a storm.
Most of it came from Fergie, as it had to do. He was the man who was
doing the chasing after all, the man who was looking to upset the
opposition and make them crack. So, at the start of the week, he
criticised the Blackburn celebrations after their victory over Newcastle
at Ewood Park. ''They went too far,'' he said sniffily.
Then Brian McClair was let loose to talk about last-day dramas and how
Celtic had taken the premier division title from Hearts when things had
been stacked against them, and how that gave McClair and his team-mates
heart.
On, then, to Fergie again to remind Kenny of how Arsenal robbed him of
a second double with a Michael Thomas goal scored at Anfield to win the
championship for the Londoners.
It was the end of the week before Dalglish replied, carefully keeping
his ammunition until it would count very positively in his favour -- a
tactic the old fox, Stein, would have approved.
So we had the Kop's King Kenny talking about the glory days he spent
at Anfield, and reminding his adoring public -- as if they needed their
memories jogged -- that the hated Manchester United would take the title
if Blackburn failed.
''I'm sure,'' he added, ''that if Liverpool fans cannot see their own
team win then they would be happy if Blackburn were champions.''
With that Dalglish had the final word before the action commenced
yesterday afternoon.
There were more words in yesterday's aftermath and there will be more
to come in future seasons as these two men, one from Cowcaddens,
Dalglish, and the other from Govan, Ferguson, continue their relentless
search for the most glittering prizes available in the English -- and
European -- game.
There will be brushes, too, between them, brushes the English won't
understand but Glaswegians will accept as natural. It would be strange
if two such strong-willed characters were to tiptoe gently through the
tulips in their continuing quest for glory. Neither one of them, after
all, would be willing to give way. That is not in their nature.
What we are looking at here are winners, men who are accustomed to
being quite simply the best.
In any case, if these two didn't clash on occasion, didn't have their
little flare-ups, then their fellow citizens might see them as
imposters.
And that would never do -- for either one of them.

KELBURN COUNTRY CENTRE. Let us put that in capitals, not least because
it transpired that wur ain blatt's Deputy Sports Ed. spent his honeymoon
there, and anybody who thinks of going to Largs with his sweetheart for
a honeymoon deserves capitals.
Yet there was undeniably not sufficient capital at the weekend which
saw the West of Scotland Sports Fair at Kelburn. A decent turnout true,
but there should surely be more. Saturday saw over a thousand, and
Sunday, a rather colder day, about the same. But there should have been
more, for the event is smashing and the venue magnificent.
Let me tell you a little of Kelburn Country Centre. It is sort of
between Largs and Fairlie. Kids love it and so do the mums and dads. It
has a Secret Forest. The pamphlet which tells you all about this is very
explicit. Myself, I would rather encounter a Secret Pocket in my pyjamas
than this nonsense.
Here are the injunctions which go along with discovering the Secret
Forest: ''Please keep to the walkways and paths and do not attempt to
break through the undergrowth. Please do not run in the Secret Forest.
Do not throw stones or attempt to climb walls.''
There is a bit of the Secret Forest where you can attempt to smoke, it
appears, but the rest of the wood is not suitable for dogs or pushchairs
and ''regrettably it cannot accomodate wheelchairs.'' Ach well there you
are.
However Kelburn is very big and big enough to have a Country Sports
gala on Sat and Sun. There was falconry and sheepdod handling, (lovely
things sheepdogs, splendid creatures sheep, pity about the owners of the
both). Gundogs and terriers running about daft. Also at the Sports Fair
were clay pigeon shooting and equestrian events and more dogs and crafts
stalls and go-karting and over 2000 people turned up to enjoy everything
over both days. And I enjoyed it myself.
Though it has to be confessed that I was disappointed at the fact that
the foxhounds weren't there. I was looking forward to the foxhounds. But
they weren't there because they were barred, rather like frisky little
chaps in dinner jackets coming from a Burns Supper in case they would
disgrace the company. And I will tell you why.
It was the decision of Lord Glasgow to bar the hounds from turning
themselves out in front of us all. He was probably -- absolutely --
correct in this matter. Foxhounds are lovely dogs, and very nice to
meet. I know they do tend to pursue foxes, but, then, have you the
slightest idea what foxes themselves tend to pursue?
Lord Glasgow worries me a bit. Which part of Glasgow is it, for a
start, which he represents. I want my lord to stand up for the Soo-Side,
bugger the rest of it. Maybe we can have a Lord Glasgow North and a Lord
Glasgow South. I suggest myself for the latter. But anyway, Lord Glasgow
took the decision at the West of Scotland Sports Fair at Kelburn to stay
the parade of the foxhounds quite simply because he had been warned that
the Anti Blood Sports League were going to turn out in six coachloads to
prevent these nice little dogs showing off. Without a fox in sight.
Now if you want to demonstrate against the boys and girls in pink
coats who are the unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable, do it. But I
can't see the slightest reason why anybody should demonstrate against
decent wee hounds. And furthermore, I cannot understand the notion that
because one holds a rather understandable hostility to rich bastards,
this means you should insist that hunting, for foxes or anything else,
should cease.
Country sports are healthy for everybody, including oddly enough,
foxes, for the alternative to hunting foxes is gassing them, snaring,
them, and what far too many farmers continue to do, put down poison.
Believe me, country sports are by neccessity a trife crude, but they are
are a damned sight more humane than any alternative. Take this from a
city boy at that.
There is an economic measure to this as well. The annual spending on
Country Sports, mainly salmon and trout fishing is 50.4 million
spondulicks a year, which is a lot of greenery in a small country.
Shooting commands even more. More than seven thousand people are
involved in one way or another, in Scotland, in full-time shooting, more
than 12,000 in part-time work. Obviously a great deal of this work
opportunity exists in the spin-offs of it, but then that is the leisure
industry.
I spoke also to Brian Pitchers of the clothes shop firm. He was
adamant that he was an animal lover and I believe him. I know the man.
He shoots clays, not live birds, though live birds have to be shot, too.
We really do have to cull the animals we breed: ask anybody who knows
anything about deer.
I spoke to Wendy MacCallum from Glasgow, out there in the beautiful
wilds of Kelburn Park. She had two georgeous dugs with her and nothing
less than a tormentor of foxes could one imagine. One of her dugs I fell
in love with; it is called Tweed. Are you seriously telling me that
either of them, and all the other field sports people are sadists,
intent on pursuing the uneatable? We didn't get to see the wee hounds
parading. You will next Sunday at the Raehills Estate near Lockerbie.
Will the saboteurs want to ruin that too? I hope a wee dug bites one at
that.

St Johnstone 2, Airdrie 1
ON a day when the spotlight fell elsewhere, Airdrie paraded a shadow
side in advance of the Scottish Cup final at Hampden.
Manager Alex MacDonald dismissed St Johnstone's late winner as
''irrelevant'' to the club's preparations for the clash with Celtic,
pointing to a cluster of Diamonds settled in the stand because of
concerns prompted by injury and suspension.
But key personnel like Jimmy Sandison, Alan Lawrence, Jimmy Boyle,
Kenny Black, and Steve Cooper will be ready for the final day
examination. Veteran keeper John Martin, shielded from danger with a
place on the bench at McDiarmid Park, will reclaim the No.1 jersey.
MacDonald maintained the cup final would only now be allowed to
intrude on the thoughts. But he allowed the mask to slip when he
admitted withdrawing defender Paul Jack after a second-half booking.
Assessing the challenge looming against Celtic, Jack insisted: ''We're
in with a good chance of winning. When we lost to Rangers two years ago
we were just happy to be at Hampden. There's a different mood among the
players this time. There's more confidence in the squad.''
Airdrie looked set to sign-off with a draw, when Sandy Stewart
cancelled out Phil Scott's second-minute opener for Saints, but the
Perth side snatched a win bonus when striker Kenneth Twaddle volleyed in
a Gary Farquhar cross four minutes from time.
St Johnstone manager Paul Sturrock was already looking ahead with the
#85,000 weekend signing of Stenhousemuir full back Euan Donaldson
signalling the start of a major investment programme.

PRESENTED with the premier division championship trophy prior to the
game, Pollok proceeded to complete their league programme in convincing
style with a 4-0 victory over nearest rivals, Arthurlie.
Consolation for Arthurlie as they scooped the Central League's Team of
the Month award for April, and the teams will meet again before the end
of the season in the semi-final of the Evening Times Centenary Trophy.
Ardeer Thistle secured promotion to the first division of the Western
Stagecoach League, while Dalry Thistle look favourites to clinch the
remaining promotion position following their 3-1 away win over Muirkirk.
Victory for Largs against Kilbirnie gave them a lifeline in their fight
against relegation.
It was mixed fortunes for OVD Cup finalists Whitburn and Camelon in
the build-up to next week's cup final.
Camelon moved two points in front of Whitburn at the top of the John
Walker League with a 3-1 win over Linlithgow, while a depleted Whitburn
team being comprehensively defeated 5-0 by Bo'ness United.

Falkirk 0 Aberdeen 2
IT was a strange sight to behold at Brockville after Aberdeen had won
their final premier division game of the season. The Pittodrie club will
hope they have not tempted the fates by allowing their players to take a
lap of honour.
Normally when I have seen Aberdeen players go back out to run around
pitches they have been holding some tangible sign of success. A European
trophy in Gothenburg, for example, or a few Scottish Cups or League Cups
at Hampden.
I never thought I would see them troop out to take a bow for scraping
their way into two play-off games which will now decide their fate.
Some of the players did look slightly embarrassed. Little wonder. This
was not a day for celebration. All this current Aberdeen team have done
so far is to avoid being relegated automatically and, to be fair to
them, they have done so with three fighting victories in their closing
games.
However, that is scarcely enough to justify the over-the-top scenes we
saw at Falkirk. If they wanted to salute their supporters they should
have left it until next Sunday when they are back at home and may have
gone a step closer to survival by winning their first play-off match
against Dunfermline.
Behind the scenes, manager Roy Aitken and defender Brian Irvine showed
more sense when they looked at the task that faces them. By then, the
crazy euphoria had gone and sanity had returned and, while the Aberdeen
people know they will be favourites, they talked with more caution than
the earlier post-match scenes could have had us expect.
Probably the most valid point of all came from Irvine, restored to the
side towards the end of the campaign only because of an injury to John
Inglis.
The powerful former Scotland centre half pointed out: ''Sometimes when
you look at play-off situations you wonder whether the team from the
lower division might have some kind of advantage because they have been
getting the better results.
''Often the team from the higher league has been having a bad time.
However, we have finished very strongly with three wins so that won't
apply to us. In a way we are going in on a high.''
Aberdeen also are tempering their current mood of confidence with a
fair degree of caution, according to Irvine. He added: ''No-one at the
club will be making any silly claims about what we are going to do.
Hopefully, we can keep up the momentum we have built in our last three
games. That is what we have to aim for.
''We all realise everyone is in this together. There is no use in
looking back and saying that this result or that result earlier in the
season would have made us safe now. It didn't happen so we have to look
at what has to be done now.
''The supporters have been tremendous and we need their help again.
That way we can stay in the premier division. We know the games against
Dunfermline will not be easy, but if we can get through them then we
have to start building a reputation for this current team.
''The Aberdeen achievements everyone talks about came from different
teams. This is the l994-95 team and we have to make a place for
ourselves in the club history.''
It was clear that Irvine wasn't ready to settle for being remembered
as a team barely able to remain a top-10 club.
Stand-in manager Roy Aitken, praised by Irvine on Saturday, as he has
been by other players in these critical closing stages of the season,
admitted: ''Look, all we have done here today is to take another step
towards survival. We have not done any more than that.
''We have still to turn the corner and we won't have done that until
the play-offs are won. But we expect these games to be difficult.
Dunfermline are a good side, an attractive side and, as well as being
important matches, I am sure they are going to be attractive and
entertaining as well.
''I can't say enough about the attitude of the players in the past
five or six weeks. They have all been magnificent. I have kept saying
this is a squad effort and when you see Scott Thomson and Stephen Glass
get the goals today you must know what I have been talking about. When
we have had to call on the younger players they have done a job for us.
''The fans have played their part, too. I think, maybe because of the
position we found ourselves in, the fans have felt closer to the
players. There is a greater bond between us and that has helped
enormously.''
But still more help is needed and only when it's all over should we be
seeing celebrations. Not before then.

Dundee United 0, Celtic 1
MAYBE it took 10 minutes, maybe 12, but it needed very little time to
determine that United were kidding themselves on that they could get
their own bit of the escape trick right, never mind expect Falkirk to do
the rest.
Long before half-time, anybody who was willing to bet on United
beating Celtic was either wearing a tangerine shirt or badly in need of
psychiatric help.
That much, therefore, explained why this proud wee club had descended
to a level of quality which probably had not been seen since its
Cinderella days.
They are not much of team, the current United, but perhaps we should
temper criticism with the realism that Gordan Petric, Billy McKinlay,
Brian Welsh, and Dave Bowman, every one a winner, were absent.
Will they be there next season? Who will be there next season?
According to the man who has had the most miserable start to a
managerial career in modern times, Billy Kirkwood, all the good players
will be asked to stay.
That does not mean he will be able to keep them all, but Kirkwood, who
had made plans to begin the revolution is determined to try.
''Now that we are relegated we have to keep our fingers crossed that
we will still be able to persuade new players to come and players to
stay,'' he said. ''The majority of the squad here is good, but maybe we
should look at the indiscipline that has cost us quality players in the
run-in to the season. It happened at the beginning, too.''
Kirkwood, however, did not consider the latest incident, near the end
on Saturday, when Christian Dailly was sent off after having thrown a
punch at Pierre van Hooydonk, as one of the more serious examples of
letting the side down. He did not want to say too much, but clearly felt
that the clash was not a pistols-at-dawn affair.
He has already pin-pointed players who are to come in and players who
are to go out. ''We definitely need an influx of better-quality players
and I have some in my mind.''
Kirkwood, who joined United from his backroom job at Ibrox, has
already been linked with former Rangers' men Steven Pressley of
Coventry, and Gary McSwegan, of Notts County, but whoever he has in mind
he hopes to get the transfer moves in motion soon.
He has nothing but praise for the United fans who have stood behind
the side during his depressing seven-game stint during which he has seem
his team win only once, losing all the rest. He said:
''They have been fantastic, surpassing my expectations and they have
been let down very, very badly. The players realise that.''
Some of them did take it very much to heart, none more so than one of
the oldest, Maurice Malpas, and one of the youngest, David Hannah, both
of whom were very distressed as they went on parade before fans who
insisted they come out and say farewell for another season.
The players threw their jerseys into the crowd, applauded the fans,
wiped away tears and slumped into the dressing room, as devastated a
bunch of sportsmen as you will see.
Malpas, a man who has been an integral part of the good times, just
could not face the reality of relegation. A player of quiet talent, self
effacing personality and total commitment, Maurice hit the bottom rung
in his career on Saturday night.
He, the excellent Dailly, and the determined and energetic Jim
McInally, who might well have been sent off, yet was not even booked for
the wild tackle that ended in Peter Grant being carried off, and the
willing Hannah, were the best of a United side that had very little in
the way of cohesive play going for them.
In the first half, McInally tried to lift them by example, but his
enthusiasm was too much at times and he committed a number of fouls
before he was let off, inexplicably, by referee Andrew Waddell after his
foul on Grant. He was booked later but the deed had been done by then,
and Grant looks a non- starter in the cup final.
Van Hooydonk might have suffered the same fate when he pushed Dailly
after having been fouled. Waddell judged it right this time, sending off
the man who swung a punch and booking the player who had been guilty of
silly frustration rather than violence.
The game itself was eminently forgettable, even if Celtic did try to
pass the ball about, and succeeded occasionally.
They might have had more goals than the single counter scored by Phil
O'Donnell 15 minutes from time, as Brian McLaughlin could have had two
himself and Van Hooydonk at least one, but they were never in danger of
losing.

CROATIAN internationalist Davor Suker joined the list of players being
linked with Rangers last night after the Ibrox club watched him at the
weekend.
Rangers sent Ewen Chester, a member of their backroom staff, to see
Suker in action for his Spanish club, Seville, against Sporting La
Coruna.
Suker joined Seville four years ago from Dynamo Zagreb for
#600,000.Now the Spaniards want several million pounds for the
27-year-old, who has scored 57 goals in 116 league games for the club.
This season Suker has hit the net 14 times.
Last night Ibrox manager Walter Smith confirmed: ''We did have a look
at the player, because he has been recommended to us.
''We knew of his reputation and so we sent someone over to Spain. But
that is all. He is just one of many players we have been watching.''

MICHAEL Schumacher majestically spearheaded a Benetton one-two with
Johnny Herbert as Damon Hill suffered a demoralising blow to his
championship hopes in yesterday's Spanish Grand Prix.
The German completed a crushing 51 seconds victory to regain the lead
in the title race after leading team-mate Herbert to the highest finish
of his 67-race grand prix career.
Londoner Herbert has struggled with the car this season despite his
fourth place in Argentina amid rumours that his fellow driver was
withholding vital information. But the 30-year-old shrugged those doubts
off to sweep past Hill on the final lap to claim his first podium finish
after several near misses.
Hill saw his four-point championship lead turn into a one-point
disadvantage when he developed hydraulic problems crossing the finishing
line for the penultimate time and lost two vital places.
David Coulthard, his Williams Renault colleague, added to his team's
woes when he was forced out of contention with gearbox problems just
five laps from the end.
Nigel Mansell also made a sad and early exit when the redesigned
McLaren Mercedes developed handling problems to extend his disappointing
return to Formula One.
There was relief though for Jordan Peugeot -- the team tipped to break
into the top four this season -- and they got their first points when
Eddie Irvine came home fifth.
But the day belonged to rejuvenated Benetton as world champion
Schumacher answered those who doubted he could handle the pressure of
defending the title.
The 26-year-old showed his pole position was no fluke by leading from
green light to chequered flag and ending any complacency in the Williams
camp about their early superiority.
Hill began brilliantly by moving from fifth to third, leaving
Coulthard trailing with the Scottish driver complaining he didn't see
the start light come on.
But Hill -- who opted for three pit stops to Schumacher's two -- could
not match the searing pace of the Benetton car despite taking over
second place when Jean Alesi saw his Ferrari engine give out.
He was content with holding on to second -- which would have
maintained his lead in the drivers' standings going to the next race in
Monaco in two weeks' time -- until he suffered the late blow.
Coulthard was also on course for third until his problems set in to
spark a double blow to Williams on a track where they had never been
beaten since the race moved to Barcelona four years ago. Results

FOR a man who had just witnessed the end of a golden era in which he
played the leading role, Dundee United chairman Jim McLean was positive
about the future after he surveyed the ashes of his beloved club's
premier division history.
''Like most folk here, I have had tears in my eyes,'' he said after
the 1-0 defeat by Celtic which meant relegation from the premier league
for the first time, ''but tears of anger.
''It is what the fans of this club, who have been magnificent, have
had to suffer. They do not deserve a team like this current one.
''I can't comment about the first division because I have never been
part of it, but looking at it from the outside, there is no doubt in my
mind that the quality of players we have at the moment is in no way good
enough to bring Dundee United back to the premier league.''
On an afternoon when there were many tears shed as the players took a
relegation lap of depression -- some throwing their shirts into the arms
of fans who chanted the club's name long after the final whistle --
McLean insisted that relegation meant no difference to the board's plans
to support the manager, Billy Kirkwood, as he begins the rebuilding
process.
The chairman, who managed United during the glorious years of the
eighties when they won the League Cup twice, the premier division once,
and reached the final of the UEFA Cup, believes that the way forward has
to be far seeing and not merely chasing a return to the top league.
''It is a tragedy to go down but if we look simply at finding a team
to get us back, we will be giving the supporters similar to today's
side.
''I don't think Billy Kirkwood realised how bad it was before he came
here but he has the backing of every one of the board and, equally, he
has the important players backing him.''
McLean said that players would have been leaving and new players
coming whatever had happened at the weekend.
He emphasised that, while the Tannadice purse is not bottomless,
Kirkwood will get the money he needs, not just to build a team to get
out of the first division but to stay in the premier.
In one of those typically ironic twists, it was the winning manager,
Celtic's Tommy Burns, who sounded more despondent. His concern was for
Peter Grant, carried off with knee damage after a scything tackle by Jim
McInally.
''It looks very unlikely at this stage that he will be able to play in
the cup final,'' said Burns.

KENNY Dalglish's Blackburn Rovers took the English Premiership title
on a day of intense drama yesterday.
It was a day when the script, written by the cynics beforehand, went
wrong.
The preconceived notion was that Liverpool would lie down to their
former hero, and their old manager, allowing Blackburn an unchallenged
run towards their first title in more than 80 years. It did not work out
that way.
Instead, Liverpool scored a free-kick winner three minutes into injury
time at Anfield, after Blackburn had squandered several scoring chances
in the closing minutes of the game.
The agony etched into Dalglish's features was evident to the watching
millions -- and then, transformation.
Within 20 seconds someone took him aside and told him that rivals
Manchester United had only been able to draw 1-1 against West Ham at
Upton Park.
Suddenly there was that Dalglish grin, the one he wore after he scored
his goals. Victory belonged to him and his players in spite of defeat on
the day.
And up in the Anfield stand sat Jack Walker, named earlier in the day
as the twenty-first wealthiest man in Britain, and obviously willing to
give up his #400m fortune for this one moment of championship glory with
his beloved Blackburn.
Superfan Walker brought Dalglish in as manager four years ago. He
handed him money to spend on players, and has spent money in rebuilding
Ewood Park.
He supported the club as a boy in the days when Blackburn were
recognised as a power in the land. Now his fortune has helped to carry
them back to the position he wanted.
Last week he said: ''We had a five-year plan to win the title. If we
get it now, we are a year ahead of schedule.''
Dalglish delivered ahead of time. When he danced on to Anfield, scene
of so many of his own triumphs, it was easy to recognise the extent of
his achievement.
In the time available to him he has built a team which challenged
ferociously for the title last year and now, this season, has whipped it
from the grasp of Manchester United and Alex Ferguson, his great Glasgow
rival.

Liverpool 2, Blackburn 1
KENNY Dalglish returned to Anfield in triumph to lift the Premiership
title despite a last-day slip that left the Blackburn fans with their
hearts in their mouths.
Blackburn knew that the championship was theirs if Manchester United
failed to win at West Ham, but the championship race, which has twisted
and turned so many times this season, looked to be making a dramatic
diversion.
Everything had seemed bright for Rovers when Alan Shearer's
thirty-seventh goal of the season -- a record-equalling thirty-fourth
Premiership strike -- gave them an interval lead.
Then John Barnes dragged Liverpool back on terms just after the hour
and Jamie Redknapp's injury-time free-kick might have started a wake.
But as the dispirited Blackburn side returned to the centre circle,
news of the result at Upton Park raced round the ground to spark dances
of delight.
The ecstasy -- shared by the Liverpool fans' delight at their greatest
rivals' misfortune -- was seen again at the final whistle as Rovers
realised they had completed the task which seemed impossible when
Dalglish took charge less than four years ago.
The Kop stood to applaud the new champions as they raised aloft the
trophy that signalled the end of United's dreams of an unprecedented
double double, and placed Dalglish alongside Herbert Chapman and Brian
Clough in winning the title with two different teams.
''Dalglish'' was the refrain from all around the ground as Blackburn
paraded in triumph. For the moment, #28m looked a price worth paying.
The celebratory mood was evident before the start, with both sets of
fans cheering the rival team line-ups and the Kop even shouting their
encouragement when David Batty won the ball in the first minute.
Liverpool, without a whole defence and with Ian Rush also missing,
made the more measured start, and when Tim Sherwood was caught in
possession after 11 minutes, Steve McManaman showed he was in the mood
to provide a sting in the championship tail by powering to the dead-ball
line, only for John Barnes to spoon over.
Blackburn were breathing even more anxiously six minutes later, when
Nigel Clough's shot on the turn from close range beat Tim Flowers, only
for Sherwood to hack off the line.
But if the nerves were beginning to show, Shearer picked the perfect
moment to calm them with a goal which summed up his incredible season.
Henning Berg played the ball forward from right back and Shearer's
brilliant first-time lay-off put Ripley into space.
The winger carried the ball forward before pulling it back into the
box just as Shearer arrived, and his emphatic strike from 14 yards hit
the bottom corner before David James could move.
Rumours of a West Ham goal caused more exultation around the ground,
repeated when news of Michael Hughes' strike was relayed through the
Anfield bush telegraph, and that sparked a better period from Liverpool.
The graft of Batty and Sherwood allowed Rovers to keep a grip on
midfield at the start of the second period, although knowledge of Brian
McClair's equaliser at Upton Park made for an edgy atmosphere.
Suddenly, in the sixthy-fourth minute, the mood of the afternoon
changed utterly. McManaman fed Kennedy in space on the left and when the
Irishman swept in a low cross, Barnes caressed the ball into the same
corner Shearer had found earlier.
The championship that had seemed destined for Ewood since they went
top in November was slipping from their grasp.It should have gone
further away from them 13 minutes from time. McManaman slipped inside to
Robbie Fowler and as the striker shaped to shoot, Batty whipped his legs
from under him.
Referee David Elleray saw nothing wrong, McManaman earning a yellow
card for his angry protest.
Then an effort by Sutton took a wicked deflection off Barnes, James
grabbed Ian Pearce's shot and then even Shearer showed his fallibility
by blasting over.
Three minutes into injury time Redknapp's brilliant free-kick, after
Hendry had fouled McManaman, left Rovers momentarily crestfallen.
But it did not matter. After 81 years the championship has a home at
Ewood Park.

HENRY MURDOCH, who looks after matters legal and commercial for the
Ayr area executive of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, has
learned the art of endearing himself to an audience by having something
amusing to say -- especially when the base material looks distinctly
unpromising.
Thus it was that at this month's meeting he was able to conjure up a
smile, and the occasional full-blown chuckle as he disposed of draft
national policy guidelines on flooding.
He did have some good stuff to work with, courtesy of a civil servant,
somewhere, who was probably only trying to be helpful.
The document solemnly pointed out that last year's December flooding
had been caused by exceptionally heavy rain over one weekend. Well, we
might have forgotten or misunderstood the effects of that downpour.
Backing-up, it explained, was what happened when high volumes of water
were unable to be absorbed into the system.
By this time the writer had obviously become convinced that the more
explanations that could be offered the better. That could be the only
reason for the inclusion of a glossary which offered meanings for
difficult words such as climate (average weather conditions for a long
period over that place) or risk (chance or likelihood of a hazardous
event occurring, usually expressed as odds, eg 100-1). So now we know.
There is a serious side to all of this, of course, not least the
suggestion that planning permission may be required for a whole range of
works on the farm which could have an effect on river flows. It may no
longer be possible automatically to carry out repairs to drains without
reference to the authorities.
For those who were interested Mr Murdoch was able to reveal that, in
terms of the European Union directive on habitats, Cockenhead Moss is an
active raised bog and the Lendalfoot Hills are classified as mountain
grassland. The list of protected birds extends to 174 species with a
further 74 listed in two annexes.
These matters were, however, just an hors d'oeuvre in a session which
went on to deal with some very meaty topics indeed. There was a
thoughtful debate on the future of farming with fears beginning to be
expressed that the European support bubble could burst.
Concern, too, about milk quotas. Milk convener Ian Kerr said the
indications were that supply figures in April were down on last year --
''but that doesn't mean that everyone can go off and produce extra milk
in the summer''.
On the European front, he said, allocation of an extra quota of
900,000 tonnes to Italy and 100,000 tonnes to Greece had just been made
permanent, with the support of British ministers. ''That beggars belief
when we could be faced with a 6% cut here under the Gatt arrangements.''
The imminent introduction of a farm-assured scheme for milk should
hold no terrors for Scottish farmers, he said. The standards being set
were based either on existing practices of good husbandry or legal
requirements. Scottish milk had for generations been produced to higher
standards than anywhere else.
The new farm-assured scheme for beef and lamb came under attack from
beef producer Alan Parker who felt standards had been lowered in order
to draw more people into the system. Livestock convener David Gemmell
suggested that the thing to do was to push for a high membership and
then to begin tightening up provisions. Under the old way, he recalled,
many farmers had just not signed up.
The final hot potato was animal welfare, raised by Tom Reid who will
be attending a meeting in Edinburgh next month between the NFUS and
representatives of Advocates for Animals, Compassion in World Farming
and Animal Concern Scotland. What, he asked, was he to tell them.
His message to the meeting on June 6 will be a strong one. Alastair
Love of Muirhouse Farm, Kilmarnock, spoke with a passion born from
strong conviction of the cruelty of bullfighting in Spain.
The welfare groups, he suggested should be picketing airports to tell
British holidaymakers of the kind of barbarity they were supporting --
even if only indirectly. The only way to make the Spanish authorities
sit up and take notice was by hitting their tourist trade, he insisted.
Despite the publicity attracted by cases of neglect or cruelty on
farms the majority of cases dealt with by the SSPCA involved pets, it
was pointed out.
One speaker said the most horrific experiences he had had in farming
concerned sheep worrying by dogs. ''These dogs belong to animal lovers
-- but they are left to roam because, according to their owners, it is
cruel to do anything else. The owners have no idea of the havoc and
distress their dogs can cause.''
It would do no harm, the meeting agreed, to hit the ball firmly back
into the animal welfare court.

Kilmacolm for hills and heather,
Brig o' Weir for rainy weather,
Johnstone for it's raggie weans . . .
THAT can't really be it all, but then there were a lot of distractions
at Ayr Show and not everyone was sober when I was getting that poetry
lesson.
It is amazing how little of a show you see when you are on a
commercial stand. Really you are confined to one small part of one
alleyway for most of the time. If any part of the show doesn't pass down
your alley you don't see it.
Mind you, I did meet a wheen of folk who seemed to be enjoying the
uncharacteristic fine weather. Certainly it was my third Ayr Show and
the first time I had seen it in sunshine.
I met Allan Black who told me that Hereford crosses are far worse than
Limousins for destroying dry stane dykes. This sounded like good news
for the breed that is generally believed by people who don't breed them
to be very nervous. It wasn't though. The Limousins, he explained, are
far better. They don't knock down your dykes because they clear them.
I also met two Irishmen from Crosshill. Sammy and Willie Rownie are
big men with hands for knocking in stobs. They milk 300 cows and have a
reputation for making a good job of things. I was convinced of that when
it turned out that the two were philosophers of the game of rugby.
We agreed that the game was now played in all the wrong spirit, and
they illustrated that belief with the story of the time that an opponent
jumped on Sammy's back. ''Hey, that's my brother, you're fightin,'' said
Willie, and swung a great fist and broke the offender's jaw in three
places. ''That stopped him.''
And I met another Irishman when I got away from my stand for a few
minutes to see the judging of the native beef breeds of cattle. The man
looked like a cattle dealer and I think he was having me on. ''Would dat
be de Aberdeen-Angus?'' he asked.
''No, that's the Galloways. The Aberdeen-Angus are over there.''
''Dems de Galloways, mother. And what would dem be?'' he asked
pointing to the Highlanders.
I thought everyone in the world knew what they were but I told him
patiently. ''Dems de Hoillanders, mother,'' he said.
I thought I should complete my man's education. ''And do you know what
those are?'' I said, pointing to the only remaining breed on show.
He looked at me as though I was soft in the head. ''Sure, everybody
knows dems de Herefords, surely.''
Everyone was delighted about the fine weather except me and I have
regretted it every day since. You see, while I was away enjoying myself
in Ayr the boys were all catching up with the crop spraying.
I got a load done on Friday before disappearing again to Neilston Show
on the Saturday, and then I got another load done on Sunday before the
heavens opened. As I write we are into the fourth day of rain. The
barley is growing half-an-inch a day and the Twerp-all is still mixing
away in the sprayer. I have now got the tractor parked under the diesel
tank. If it hasn't stopped by tomorrow I think I'll just connect her up.
And at least twice a day Mossie is on the phone. ''How much did they
pay you to go to Ayr? And how much have you lost because you werena at
home to spray your barley? It's nae for me to say, but mine's all
sprayed.''
I dread the phone, for he has a point.
But it is very difficult nowadays when the farm is a one-man band. And
the weather is so uncertain. If I had declined the invitation it would
have been the usual Ayr Show weather and no work would have been
possible anyway.
And if he but knew it, the penalties of my swanning off to the shows
are greater still. When I was away at Neilston a pure Simmental heifer
had produced a big bull calf in the wood. Had I been at home I might
have been able to help. I still might not have seen her of course, but
hurrying away to judge cattle isn't the best way to look after the
calving.
It has cost me #200 to replace that calf with a Simmental cross
Holstein, and I reckon when I sell, it will be worth #200 less than the
natural calf and it will likely have eaten more per kilo of weight-gain.
Still, there is an entry on the credit side. Even though the sun shone
again I did enjoy the Neilston Show.
They're a canny lot. When the learned judge arrived the committee
invited him most civilly to have a dram. He accepted. As there would be
a good six hours before he would have to drive he could safely have two
large ones. It might help with the judging.
But it was not to the usual committee tent that we repaired. My hosts
piloted me straight into the magnificent mobile premises of the
Clydesdale Bank. I thought it a very economical move and only fair
considering how much the farmers have contributed to the welfare of the
bankers over the years.

<TEXT>
NOW that the IACS form-filling has just finished, one of the major
form-filling exercises of the year has now passed, and all businesses
will, hopefully, have kept a copy for their own records.
The volume of records which every farm business is now required to
complete and retain is not inconsiderable, with many records requiring
to be kept for periods of up to 10 years.
The effective management of the records of a business is a further
talent that farmers and managers are having to develop and implement.
An effective storage system need not be complicated, and the benefits
of having ready access to this basic information of the business are
many fold.
The planning and accurate budgeting of a business is made much more
difficult where these records are unavailable. Even the relatively
simple task of calculating the arable area payments and the livestock
subsidies (eg extensification) due to a business can become a problem.
It can be of considerable benefit if all the correspondence is kept
from official bodies, especially those regarding notification of quota,
retention periods, etc.
In most cases, a manual storage system is all that is required, and
despite the volume of records, it does not normally require a filing
cabinet. A few large lever-arch files can be sufficient. Some producers,
however, have looked at the option of computerising their recording
system, and this has been achieved to good effect in many businesses.
Software is available from SAC and others for livestock recording,
offering a system of record keeping that keeps track of animals, and
even provides action lists to help ensure compliance with retention
periods, etc. In some cases businesses have set up their own recording
systems to meet their own requirements. The benefit of such computerised
systems is that useful management information can be more easily
gathered.
By recording a few live weights, and sale prices, for example,
livestock performance can be calculated, thereby enhancing the
information available from records that are kept for statutory purposes.
A computerised system will not replace entirely the manual storage, but
it should allow the recording to be simple yet productive.
The financial records of the business include the cashbook, invoices,
receipts, bank statements, VAT returns as well as the final accounts of
the business. A well-managed cashbook allows a very effective monitor of
performance of budget against actual. The accounts, however, are often
under-utilised as a management tool. Many businesses may have just
received their 1994 crop year accounts, and if the income trends quoted
recently are correct, then many of these accounts will be looking good.
But this only reflects the profit figure.
A more detailed analysis of the profit-and-loss account and the
balance sheet can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the business
performance, addressing areas such as technical efficiency, labour
costs, power costs, as well as balance sheet strength and viability.
In summary, every business now needs an effective record-keeping
system of some form. Where possible, the system should allow useful
management information to be obtained also. This applies to all the
records of the business, whether it is the livestock movement record,
the IACS form, the cashbook, or even the formal farm accounts.

IN A busy week for official statistics, the retail sales figures for
April on Thursday look like providing the key numbers. Sales have been
weak in recent months with consumer spending diverted away from the High
Street shops to holidays, eating out, and the National Lottery.
City analysts are expecting a bounceback in April. The economics team
at stockbroker James Capel is forecasting a 0.5% rise in the volume of
sales on the back of a bullish CBI distributive trades survey on Friday.
Even so this would still leave the annual rate of increase edging down
from 1.9% in March to 1.8%.
Further evidence of mounting factory gate price inflation is expected
to emerge from the April producer price figures today. A 0.5%
month-on-month rise would take the headline rate up from 3.8% to 4.1%,
the first time it had been above 4% in the current upturn. Input prices
are expected to increase by around 0.3%, but the annual rate should
moderate from 11% to 10.3%.
On Wednesday, attention will switch to the April minutes of the
meeting between the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor
of the Exchequer for further signs of a policy rift. But the May minutes
are the ones the City wants to see.
April's unemployment figures, also due on Wednesday, should yield a
further fall in seasonally adjusted unemployment of around 25,000, if
the recent monthly trend is to prove a reliable guide. Unchanged average
earnings of 3.5% in March are expected with the rate depressed by the
drop in bonuses paid in financial services.
Also due on Wednesday are the PSBR figures for April. This is the
first month of the new fiscal year. Capel expects a PSBR of #4000m
against #4600m in April last year after excluding privatisation
proceeds.
M4 figures on Friday will be swollen by the continuing boost from the
cash element of the Glaxo bid for Wellcome. Broad M4 is expected to rise
by around 0.6% taking the annual rate up from 5.5% to 5.9% in April. M4
lending will be a hefty #5000m after the #8500m in March.

THE Stock Exchange will this week be telling us how it is getting on
with the build-up to the formal launch of its new Alternative Investment
Market better known as AIM which is scheduled for June 19. Do not judge
it by the first figures. They may look a little disappointing compared
with an estimated potential of 250 companies although an Exchange
spokeswoman said: ''The level of interest has been encouraging. It is
early days but there has been tremendous interest.''
Regardless of how many companies join at the start, there are certain
to be others on the way. The Exchange has already conceded that more
preparation time was needed. So companies currently trading under the
concessionary Rule 4.2 have been given until the end of September to
make their arrangements instead of having to rush into AIM by June 19
will be traded off market.
The new market had a number of objectives. One was to replace the old
unlisted Securities Market for smaller companies which comes to an end
next year. Another was to bring regulation to the Rule 4.2 market where
deals are done in unquoted companies. This had become much more active
than originally intended.
AIM will have more regulation. Each company will have to have an
officially approved Nominated Adviser who will be responsible for
ensuring that the company conforms to market rules and makes proper
announcements about profits and so on. AIM was also seen as a market for
smaller, often locally-based, companies to raise modest amounts of
capital for expansion and get a recognised quotation for their shares. A
number of Scottish companies are reported to have advanced preparations
both to join the market and to raise capital. Others are ''sitting back
but watching with a lot of interest.''
The launch date of June 19 has for sometime been looking a bit tight.
For a start the Public Offer of Securities regulations being brought in
to comply with Brussels directives were only presented to Parliament a
few days ago. More important was the requirement that each company
should have its Nominated Adviser who will in effect take on the job
regulation. Arranging this and the Exchange's vetting of people wanting
to be Nominated Advisers has taken longer than originally hoped.
The Exchange had more than 150 applications to become Nominated
Advisers with interest expressed by accountants, solicitors and banks as
well as stock broking firms. The Exchange has not yet published its list
of approved advisers but already some of the big firms of accountants
such as Touche Ross are holding seminars for owners and managers of
small companies. Justin Urquhart Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers said:
''AIM has brought in a new element of competition for the people who
traditionally brought companies to the market. People are packaging
services and costs are coming down.''
One estimate is that the necessary investigations and reports for a
launch on to this market can cost as little as #50,000. Ongoing fees are
more difficult to estimate but Mr Urquhart Stewart said: ''Competition
has brought a breath of fresh air -- fees are coming down.''
AIM will have smaller and newer companies than have so far been traded
under the Stock Exchange's umbrella. They are the little acorns and you
buy their shares in the hope that they will grow into mighty oaks but
also in the knowledge that they may trampled underfoot and you will lose
your money.
Mr Urquhart Stewart commented: ''You have to go in with your eyes
open. Small companies are risky and it is a case of buyer beware. You
don't buy them if you are looking for a quiet and cosy return of 5%. You
don't look for dividends but hope to make 200%.''
He is not sure how much private client interest will be shown at the
start but is confident that the fund management industry will be there
offering investors products which spread the risk over a number of
companies.
Not all the companies who currently use the Rule 4.2 market will be
switching to AIM.
John Jenkins, whose J P Jenkins market-making firm specialises in
them, is setting up his own off-Exchange market to be named Ofex to take
over from Rule 4.2 when the Exchange effectively abolishes it at the end
of September.
Mr Jenkins's firm will also be a market-maker in AIM shares.
Winterflood Securities the leading market-maker in USM and other small
company shares will also be a key operator in AIM. A number of other
member firms may also act as market-makers, probably in companies where
they have a relationship.
When it gets going AIM will be a very modern electronic market. The
Exchange has enhanced its SEATS screens and a new SEATS-plus which will
display information, prices and share offerings and will have the
facility for member firms to deal with each other on a push button basis
is scheduled to go live a week before AIM opens. The software is
currently being tested but not everyone is happy about dealing on a
push-button basis. Some will still prefer to haggle about prices and
strike deals over the telephone.
AIM will not be a market for widows and orphans but it is likely to
attract a fair amount of interest.

FEW could challenge John Macleod on the need to stimulate the economy
of Harris, or his assessment of our myopic council (May 2).
Sadly, though, it is not munifience but contempt which brings Redlands
so far from home. They see a desperate council, unable or unwilling to
pursue investment, who will naively accept any offer of new employment.
When the quarry has killed the fishing, and scared away the tourists,
what then? When the handful of jobs they have to offer are all that
exist in South Harris, what will be their incentive to behave
responsibly?
They perceive Harris and its people to have no value other than their
ability to be exploited. If we reckon our own worth no more highly, we
will truly deserve Redlands and their kin.

A SMALL Scottish heating and ventilation firm established only two
years ago has achieved BS5750 and ISO9000 quality accreditation in the
remarkable time of seven months from start to finish. The firm,
Heatmaster Limited of Cumbernauld, also expect to achieve a #2m turnover
this year.
''From the moment the company began in business I decided to shape all
our procedures exactly to match those in BS5750 and ISO9000 standards,''
said managing director and sole shareholder Scott Ramsay at Heatmaster's
base in Deardykes View, Westfield Industrial Estate. ''That gave us a
tremendous advantage. Other firms had to adapt their existing procedures
to match what would be required. We knew that everything we did had been
shaped that way from the word go.''
Heatmaster, which he began with an empty office, a phone and a fax
machine, now covers the whole of Scotland with work being carried out in
places as far apart as Peterhead and Dumfries. Still at the same office,
it now has 14 employees, all under 35 years of age.
''We are a young team, but every step of our way ahead has been
carefully planned,'' said Scott Ramsay.
In its first year of activity the Cumbernauld company achieved a
#500,000 turnover. Last year that grew to #800,000. This year's turnover
is expected to achieve the #2m mark.
''We then took the formal BS5750 part two and the ISO902 route just
last year,'' said Scott Ramsay. ''This was first from a marketing point
of view, the need to show potential customers that we had quality
accreditation. But it quickly developed that we were directly benefiting
from the further procedures we were putting into place.''
Aided by Quality Consulting Services of Cumbernauld, the work involved
was tackled vigorously. Scott Ramsay found that a major benefit of
having a young workforce was that they all knew what quality
accreditation was about.
''They knew that we were a young company, that we planned a lot of
growth in the future, that quality accreditation was part of that
growth, and that if the company grew then they stood to grow with it,''
said Scott Ramsay. ''A lot of the extra work involved was carried out in
voluntary extra evening sessions. Everyone was encouraged to contribute
ideas to the manual of procedures that had to be prepared.''
An early emphasis was on tighter controls, both within the office
structure and at the different work sites. The sites yielded clear cut
examples of what could be done.
''Drawings and similar documents had often ended up pinned to a wall
in haphazard fashion or left lying on the floor or a desk,'' said Scott
Ramsay. ''Now each site has a ''site file'' in each employee's name. It
includes programmes of work to be done along with purchase orders and
similar documents.
''Workers at every contract site are now better informed. In addition,
immediate checks can be made whenever a contractor delivers material to
a site. Gone are the days when these checks could only be made by
reference to the office back at Cumbernauld. The same checks can now be
made immediately a delivery arrives, shortages are identified, and
delivery drivers can be told straight away.
''At the same time, our system results in faults of any kind on site
being identified so that they can quickly be put right.''
Heatmaster's managing director's wealth of experience in the building
services industry at all levels has proved invaluable to his firm's
growth.
Success was acknowledged when both quality accreditation certificates
were presented to the company in Cumbernauld last week by local MP
Norman Hogg. There have been congratulations from many customers and
clients.
''The value of the work that was involved is already very clear,''
says Scott Ramsay. ''It is becoming more and more certain that in the
future any firm that wants to tender in many aspects of business will
require the possession of a quality system. But in addition to that,
although we always knew we were an efficient company, we have improved
further in many ways to our own benefit as well as that of our
customers.''
The Cumbernauld firm has already developed a strong client base with
end users who include the Benefits Agency, PO Counters Limited, The
Forestry Commission, Stirling University, and the College of Commerce.
Construction companies who are clients include Laing Construction
Limited, Ogilvie Builders, Amec Construction Limited, and Barry D
Trentham.
The firm uses computer-aided design equipment together with the latest
Engineering Technology 2000 estimating systems.
''This allows us to prepare fully computerised estimates with detailed
summaries to suit client needs,'' said Scott Ramsay. ''This means that
valuable management time within Heatmaster is increased. Our
computerised 2000 estimating package maintains our company's tenders on
a computer suited to our needs.''
The system also provides facilities to maintain prices and labour
norms. At the same time it gives flexibility in creating tenders in a
way to suit the company packages. The system is enhanced by a digitiser
table from A4 to A0 and above, all in the ways required by today's
fast-track construction service industry.
''We believe that in a short time we have emerged as being among the
leading specialist contractors in the heating, ventilation and air
conditioning industry,'' said Scott Ramsay.
''Having achieved BS5750 part two and ISO9002, we are now poised to
advance further.''

I DO wish cyclists would make an attempt to obey some elementary

and the concepts of giving signals and offering some means of auditory

CONSTRUCTION REGULATIONS
M Stuart Macdougald-Dentond, Hurd Rolland Partnership
IF you are considering instructing any construction work you should
seek professional advice. On March 31 the Construction (Design and
Management) Regulations 1994 came into effect. These are intended to
make everyone involved in a construction project, including clients,
take notice of the safety aspects, and so reduce the number of serious
injuries on building sites. Failure to comply could lead to a fine or
even imprisonment.
If you are only thinking of getting your house extended or building
yourself a new one, you probably needn't worry. If, on the other hand,
you are constructing houses for sale, the building or extension is for
the purposes of a trade or business, you are undertaking earthworks or
installing fixed plant, or if the building work involves any demolition
or dismantling, then you must read on.
There are many other spheres of work which you may not consider to be
actual construction, but the regulations do, and you should seek
clarification from a suitably qualified professional before starting.
Unless construction on your project had already started by March 31,
you will have to employ a planning supervisor, and when you next decide
to build this ought to be the first person you take on. You must ensure,
however, that the person you employ is competent and adequately
resourced to perform the duties imposed on him or her by the
regulations.
Thereafter, you will have to provide as much information as you can
about the site or state of the building being altered. He or she, in
turn, will advise you on the competence and resources of all the
designers, not just the architect, and the principal contractor.
The regulations require that two new documents are produced. The first
is the health and safety plan. This will include all the information
about the site or buildings, from the client, and all the hazards the
designers have not been able to eliminate from their designs.
The second is the health and safety file. This is a development of the
plan during the time construction work is taking place, and culminates
in a file of information being delivered back to the client at the end.
This will include all the hazards involved in the new construction, how
these might be overcome when it is maintained or altered and how it
might be demolished. It will need to be made available to anyone doing
such work in the future, and will be sold on with the construction, to
be used by the new owner in the same way.
The planning supervisor will ensure a health and safety plan is
prepared before the construction work starts and will pass this on to
the principal contractor for his or her information. The planning
supervisor will also be responsible for ensuring the health and safety
file is prepared and delivered to the client on completion of the
project.
There is no lower cost limit to the application of the regulations.
However, if the project has less than five people carrying out the
construction work at any one time, will last less than 30 days in total
or 500 man-days then you may be exempt, unless, of course, you are
undertaking any demolition or downtaking. You may also be exempt if your
project is under local authority enforcement. Again, you should seek
clarification from a suitably qualified professional.
There are some transitional provisions which will apply, but these
only have any real effect on design work done before March 31 or if
construction had already begun by then and will end by January 1 next
year.

HOTELS AND LEISURE
By David Reid, Chesterton International
MANY of us have heard stories over the past decade about people going
into the licensed trade or buying hotels then selling for huge profits.
I am constantly being asked if, in today's notoriously difficult market,
it can still be done.
The answer quite simply and realistically is yes, but there are
unquestionably less people able to make such massive capital gains as in
the eighties. And those who do make large gains will admit it requires
much harder work than ever before.
Chesterton has more than 120 offices worldwide and has recently used
its international knowledge to look at the overall market trends within
the licensed leisure and hotel market. We are noticing an increase in
interest from the Far East, where expatriates are looking mainly for
country house hotels in Scotland.
Owners of such hotels should not be overly optimistic as overseas
buyers are fully aware that hotels are cheaper now than six years ago.
Expatriates also realise that those selling are often in forced sale
situations brought about largely because of over-borrowing.
In fact, banks have had a considerable amount to do with the changing
market by introducing far stricter borrowing criteria. No-one can really
blame them for their more cautious approach because they have taken the
biggest hits over recent years.
However, we have noticed in recent months that most banks have become
very keen to lend on hotels of all types, and this is encouraging
because many of them had frozen lending for a few years on licensed
premises. They are, however, more discerning and nowadays most new hotel
lending is geared towards those who have some experience of the trade.
Too many people who bought in the eighties and have now failed had
romantic notions of purchasing a hotel for around #300,000, with often
in excess of 70% borrowing, and expected a champagne and Mercedes
lifestyle before selling five years later for #600,000.
Such lifestyles can be achieved and such returns gained on an
investment, but only if turnover and profits are similarly increased.
The reason banks like those with experience and preferably 50%-plus
deposits is that such people are realistically committed to making a go
of a hotel, recognise the unsociable hours involved and are aware that
the successful hotelier must have a chameleon character which will adapt
to all types of guest and diner.
We have recently sold the Annfield Hotel in Ayr on behalf of
well-known country and western singer Sydney Devine. He would be the
first to admit that running a hotel such as his required expertise and
100% commitment. Unfortunately, with his commitments in the
entertainment world he could not devote the required time to it. The
Annfield was snapped up by fast-expanding Eagle Taverns, which has the
expertise and resources to expand and develop the business.
A larger hotel, but with the likelihood again of being sold to an
experienced operator, is currently on the market. Situated in glorious
grounds less than 17 miles from Edinburgh, Barony Castle Hotel by
Peebles is for sale at almost half what it would have achieved in 1988.
With 30 rooms with en-suite facilities, a swimming pool complex,
ballroom, function room and 22 acres (further ground may be available),
the #850,000 price tag offers exceptional value for money and has
already attracted interest from the Middle and Far East.
The hotel currently qualifies within the meaning of Section 19 of the
Capital Allowances Act 1990, which we are advised means that major tax
advantages will be made available to it over the next 21 years.
Overall, hotels are still a good buy and excellent profits can be
made. Scottish success stories such as Stakis and MacDonald Hotels can
be repeated right down the line, and true entrepreneurial first-time
buyers who are snapping up bargains available on the current market will
undoubtedly be the success stories of the future.
It is important anyone considering buying a hotel or leisure concern
should realise it must be a mid to long-term investment, however, and
that some money should be left for refurbishment.
Good deals can be done with agents such as ourselves where, more often
than not, hotels are selling for less than advertised asking prices.
Asking prices indicate what the vendor is looking for, but there is
little question that experienced purchasers are realising it is still a
buyers' market with some incredible bargains available.

CONTAMINATED LAND
By Kemp Lindsey, Grimley
EVERYBODY in the property world must now be aware of the Environmental
Bill, the Government's response to consultation papers issued last year
by the Department of the Environment, Welsh Office and Scottish Office
Environment Department.
The Bill, having passed through the House of Lords returned to the
other place earlier recently for its second reading. Before it receives
Royal Assent, expected to be in July, there may be significant changes
to the proposed provisions contained in the published version.
So what are the implications for the property world as things stand at
the moment? The Bill, a lengthy and on the whole verbose document, which
appears to be the product of the legal spin-doctors at the DoE, or even
that famous French footballing philosopher, is primarily aimed at
repealing legislation to enable the establishment of the Scottish
Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Environment Agency in
England and Wales.
It does, however, contain provisions for contaminated land, extending
to some 15 pages, which are to be enacted through an amendment of the
1990 Environmental Protection Act by introducing a new Part IIA
containing Sections 78A to 78P.
Under the proposed provisions, due to come into force at the same time
as the new unitary authorities commence business, all local authorities
will have a duty to carry out inspections of their respective areas to
identify contaminated land. The Bill defines this as ''any land which
appears to the local authority in whose area it is situated to be in
such a condition, by reason of substances in, on or under the land, that
(a) harm, or (b) pollution of controlled waters, is being, or is likely
to be caused.''
Having identified contaminated land, the authority and, in certain
specified circumstances, SEPA have a duty to serve a remediation notice
on the ''appropriate person''. This will set out the means of remedying
the contamination and the period for compliance. The enforcing
authorities will be required to keep a register of notices served.
In preparing the notice the authority must determine the standard of
clean-up required, based on what it considers reasonable, having regard
to the likely costs and the seriousness of the harm or pollution
involved.
There is a right of appeal against the notice, provided it is within
21 days of service, to the sheriff for a local authority notice, and the
Secretary of State for a notice served by SEPA. Failure to comply with a
notice carries the threat of a fine. Non-compliance with the terms of
the notice could lead to the enforcing authority entering the land and
carrying out the remediation itself and then recovering reasonable
costs.
So who does the enforcing authority serve the remediation notice on?
In line with the Government's ''polluter must pay'' principle, it will
pursue, where possible, the person responsible for the contamination or
pollution. If it is unable to identify them, or if ownership of the land
has been transferred, the current owner or occupier will be responsible.
The implications to the property world are abundantly clear. It is
imperative anyone acquiring or disposing of an interest in land
commissions an environmental review to determine the likely nature and
extent of contamination in, on, under and adjacent to it and assesses
the risk in terms of intended final use criteria so likely remediation
costs can be determined. Only when in possession of this information
should any agreement to acquire or dispose of the interest in the land
be completed.
This goes back to the heart of the reason for drafting the Environment
Bill in the first place: the Government's policy to ensure that existing
contamination is treated on the ''suitable for use basis''.
The cynic might say that the Bill was drafted by lawyers for the
benefit of lawyers, particularly when it comes to the preparation of
lengthy dispositions and leases that will aim to ensure that liability
for contamination and any subsequent clean-up costs is allocated to the
right ''appropriate person''.
A further implication for the property world is the likely impact the
Bill will have on companies' insurance provisions. General pollution
cover is usually based upon ''an acts occurring basis'', where a claim
is covered by the policy in force in the year the pollution occurred.
Most general cover is heavily qualified, with the result that it is
primarily for sudden and accidental pollution, but not for that which
happens gradually. It is important to check the small print.
This limitation on cover may leave the current owner or occupier
exposed to the clean up cost associated with historic contamination if
served with a remediation notice by an enforcing authority.
A recent article in the Estates Gazette advocated that the property
industry urge its insurers to adopt a ''usable risk assessment''
approach, so that environmental risk could be reliably assessed and
costed. The carrying out of an environmental review could be seen ''as
the most practical and cost effective way that property managers can
make certain their insurers have adequate information to provide them
with the necessary year-in year-out cover''.
The Environmental Bill also contains new statutory nuisance
provisions, with the repeal of the Public Health (Scotland) Act 1897 as
amended, and alterations to the Control of Pollution Act 1974 in
relation to water pollution regulatory powers and the abandonment of
mines with effect from December 31, 1999.

RETAIL DEVELOPMENT
By Tom Johnston, Peter Campbell &amp; Co
THE recently published Scottish Office draft National Planning Policy
Guideline (NPPG) on retailing sets out the Government's stall on future
policy for all new retail development in and out of town.
The general thrust of the proposals is to create a presumption in
favour of town centre or edge of centre development over out of town
development. The NPPG does not propose a bar on out of centre
development but much tougher criteria will require to be satisfied.
The NPPG should be studied closely by all active participants in the
retail business including property investors, developers and
professional advisers as well as retailers themselves. Comments on the
draft NPPG must be submitted to the Scottish Office Environment
Department by May 15, so time is of the essence.
My view is that the proposals represent an over-reaction against
perceived concerns about out of town retailing which are totally
invalid. I would, therefore, encourage interested parties to make
representations to the Scottish Office.
As ever, the retail market continues to evolve, and over the last year
there have been a number of very significant changes in the momentum of
food retailing, in particular relating to the identity of the principal
players.
The takeover by Tesco of Wm Low and the effective takeover of Shoprite
by Kwik Save has eliminated two leading names from the local grocery
scene. This has been combined with the general slow down in activity by
other retailers such as Argyll (Safeway), which has itself been touted
as a possible takeover target in the financial press in recent months.
Tesco has opened a second Metro store in Glasgow, while the Co-op
further rationalises branches, with Asda and Sainsbury making steady, if
not spectacular, progress in their opening programme.
Despite the demise of Shoprite, the discount food market has seen
Netto fail to make any impact, and Lidl appears to have slowed down its
acquisition programme, while Aldi has entered the frame more actively
and is now perceived as the main competition for Kwik Save and Lidl.
As a result, despite the tightening planning environment, food retail
land values have been in decline, and we are now a long way from the
very heady days of the late eighties and early nineties.
The non-food out of town retail market has, however, continued to
strengthen significantly, to a point where in some instances non-food
land values are in the same ball park as food values. It is also seeing
further signs of maturity, as consolidation has led to Sainsbury's
complete a takeover of the Texas Homecare chain for its DIY subsidiary
Homebase.
With increasing movement into retail parks, there are also some signs
that retailers with mature property portfolios require to react
positively to maintain market share, an example being B&amp;Q's recent
opening of a new 80,000 sq ft warehouse store in Aberdeen.
The NPPG will almost certainly impact on non-food retailers,
fortunately however we are starting to see some planning enlightenment,
with a number of authorities taking a more relaxed view towards
acceptable uses in out of town retail parks and retailers such as
Children's World, Pet City and Sports Division becoming increasingly
accepted. This discourages duplication of uses and makes for a more
interesting trader mix.
In contrast with the food market, viable non-food retail park sites
are generally achieving very keen land values, as was shown by the
recent closing date for a site in Livingston which attracted around 25
offers. This degree of developer interest is a product of Government
policy since it anticipates future restrictions on non-food retail park
planning consents.
Other factors set to make a greater impact on the retail market will
be the further growth of complementary users such as leisure and
restaurant operators. The next 12 months will see ever increasing
numbers of bingo clubs springing up around the country, with County,
Gala, Paramount and Top Rank leading the way. New multi-screen cinemas
will also be on the agenda, with operators such as Odeon, MGM, Showcase,
UCI and Warners all active.
For the future, I see us moving towards an acceptable balance between
out of town and in town facilities -- there is clearly room for both,
the consumer having already voted on this topic.
The current NPPG proposals represent an over-reaction and if, as
appears likely, they are implemented, it will only be a matter of time
before the pendulum swings back in the other direction. I foresee the
major retail food groups continuing to expand steadily, albeit
selectively, providing they are not unrealistically forced to look at
town centre or edge of centre sites, which must in many cases be
impractical.
There must be an accepted role for food discounters who provide
choice, while the successful experience of both Tesco Metro and Marks &amp;
Spencer in town clearly demonstrates there is a market for grocery
retailing in town centres, but only to complement the large superstores
-- not as an alternative.
The future for non-food retailing is influenced by the vagaries of the
planning system, and I would urge the authorities to adopt an
increasingly enlightened attitude, achieving a balance between in and
out of town. Glasgow need only look towards Edinburgh for guidance.

INCREASING legislation regulating the waste management industry is
forcing everyone involved to focus on how it is perceived. And there is
more to come. People are very critical of the sector. Is this justified?
Clearly, sustainable and stringent controls are needed, but without
crippling it. After all, we need waste management and businesses
prepared to take it on.
There are a number of increasingly intrusive and demanding measures
under consideration in the UK and EU arenas.
But, the industry seems to be in shock. Having fought a long, hard
battle in the run up to the 1994 Waste Management Licensing Regulations,
the spokesmen have dropped behind the parapet again. Too busy (perhaps
understandably) making sure their respective organisations are complying
with the legislation already in force -- and working out how this is
going to be financed -- to notice that the next advance is taking shape.
Is the industry going to defend itself? Because it needs to.
The National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors said in April
last year it would be encouraging members to lodge appeals (in the
context of new licensing requirements) so precedents might be set on
important issues. It would appear this is not happening in Scotland.
Operators are continuing to negotiate away local problems.
This is fine when there is little consistency in approach and even
less liaison among waste regulation authorities, but the regulators are
changing their practices now, and we are moving rapidly towards a
unified enforcement body -- the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency
(SEPA).
There is no doubt high profile operators are feeling the effect of the
tighter regime and are making every effort to abide by it. Their
complaint is that the regulatory and enforcement activity is not
penetrating the whole industry. This is a problem SEPA will have to
tackle.
One thing is certain: the effort being put into implementing the new
legislative measures by industry and regulators alike will be diminished
unless the penalties given to transgressors by the courts are
meaningful.

ABERDEEN INDUSTRIAL
By Roddy Pearson Ryden
THE level of new inquiries circulating in the Aberdeen market has
continued to fluctuate over the last six months, although in general
activity has been high, with 43 separate transactions concluded,
amounting to approximately 355,000 sq ft of accommodation leased or
purchased. This represents an increase of 67% over the previous six
months.
This rise in take up level has been achieved mainly because several
substantial company requirements were satisfied during the period. The
upturn in the market can be linked to the improving economic conditions
in the UK and, more specifically, in Aberdeen itself, where confidence
within the oil industry has been boosted by the recent find west of
Shetland and the more stable oil price of around $17 per barrel.
The majority of the latest industrial developments have been bespoke
design and build projects because of the lack of speculative building
and the inferior quality of much of the vacant second-hand space,
leading an ever increasing number of companies to choose the
custom-built option.Developments of this type are currently under
construction at Kirkhill (Kvaerner), Raiths (Pentagon Freight, Adam
Cunningham &amp; Sons), Wellington Road Industrial Park (FMC Corporation)
and Wellheads (SGS Redwood). It is also encouraging to note that the
only significant speculative building, a 30,000 sq ft facility at
Badentoy, is now under offer ahead of completion. The building has a
prominent site at the entrance to the park and has been finished to a
high standard of specification and a flexible design.
Developers can still be successful if they build the right product on
a well located site. The supply of new space on the market remains at
around 60,000 sq ft, although this is likely to drop by at least 50%
before the end of the year. Developers seeking to identify suitable
sites face a difficult task, as there is a shortage of prime industrial
land available within the city's established industrial estates.
The supply of second-hand space has fallen to just over 1.5m sq ft
with approximately 50% of the accommodation in properties above 20,000
sq ft.
Despite the significant and encouraging increase in take up figures,
there has been little effect on mainstream rentals due to the continuing
high level of vacant properties, although many of these offer
sub-standard accommodation. Average rentals, therefore, remain at around
#4.50 per sq ft for modern standard-sized units in good locations. The
favoured lease length is still five to 10 years, particularly for oil
related companies.

GLASGOW RETAIL
By Chris Reis Montagu Evans
OVER the past 12 months, we have witnessed a strong recovery in the
take up of retail floor space in prime Glasgow retail locations such as
Argyle Street.
During 1993 and the early part of 1994, there were a number of large
retail units openly available on the market and each of these has now
been acquired. The Mothercare transaction at 87/91 Argyle Street (where
the children's wear operator acquired a 8000 sq ft retail store
providing with approximately 100 feet of frontage to Argyle Street)
reflected the turning demand for Glasgow's prime shopping street.
Also indicative of the resurgence of the street is the development and
subsequent letting of the former Arnotts store at numbers 167/201,
Argyle Street, where the entire development is either let or under
offer.
The decision by our clients Easter Morrison Partnership and Scottish
Amicable to purchase the store and re-develop has proved to be extremely
successful. Woolworths and The Gap have reported healthy trading, and in
addition J D Sports has linked up with Nike to create the latter's first
ground floor High Street Nike presence in the UK.
The Arnotts scheme will assist in strengthening the west end of Argyle
Street between Union Street and Buchanan Street.
Buchanan Street is itself is also experiencing strong occupational
demand, and this has resulted in transactions reaching approximately
#130 zone A, witnessed on one particular deal within the Buchanan
Prospect scheme towards the southern end of the street. As Buchanan
Street becomes increasingly more expensive, it may be seen that Gordon
Street may soak up some of the latent tenant demand. that exists for
Buchanan Street. This will lead to a steady rise in zone A within that
location.
The resurgence of Buchanan Street will be further strengthened by the
development of the Buchanan Centre proposed for a site adjacent to the
Royal Concert Hall at the junction of Buchanan Street with Sauchiehall
Street. The scheme currently being developed by Slough Estates and AMP
will provide 550,000 sq ft of retail floor space, including a 300,000 sq
ft anchor store occupied by the John Lewis Partnership. Work on site is
due to start this year.
The precise impact on Sauchiehall Street of the Buchanan Centre
remains to be seen, but at this stage it is apparent it will draw the
prime pitch eastwards and, in addition, the north end of Buchanan Street
will benefit substantially.
Retail demand for Glasgow city centre is ever increasing, and the City
Centre area will undoubtedly be able to support a scheme of this
magnitude.
In broad terms, Glasgow city centre is now seen by the London-based
fashion sector of the market based in London as possessing a population
with strong spending power, and that embodied with the young being
fashion conscious by nature, has led to Glasgow being identified as of
strategic importance on a UK scale.

FARMING, By Gordon King, DM Hall
ACCOUNTANTS have always seen farming as an attractive and tax
efficient business. Perhaps this is just as well for the health of the
Scottish farmer, for whom paying tax is almost a crime.It is often said
that if you want to make #1m out of farming, you should start with #2m.
But while it is true that not all sectors of agriculture are profitable,
there are compensations.
Traditionally, agricultural estates have often been owned and
developed by money which was made outside farming. In the case of many
of the estates where spectacular developments and improvements were
carried out during the 19th century -- extensive road schemes, drainage
and model steadings -- the work was done on the back of money from
industry or trade. Recently, DM Hall's country department was involved
in a survey of farm sales and purchases. We found most of them still
involved cash generated from outside agriculture.
So if it isn't for the profit, why do so many people invest in
agricultural property? The kudos of living in the country has always
drawn investors, although it is possible the farming community's
unjustly beleaguered status in the public eye recently might have
reduced its attraction.
Sporting interests often pull people towards rural land ownership. But
deer, grouse and salmon are more significant on the marginal farms. They
don't have any impact on quality commercial arable farms in, say, East
Lothian, Fife or Angus.
The growing anti-hunt lobby -- and the recent vote against hunting in
the House of Commons, with the threat of campaigns against deer stalking
and grouse shooting to follow -- may cause landowners to question
whether sport alone is a sensible reason for investment.
The best reasons for putting money into farming, however, are the tax
breaks. The pleasure of using a farm as a tax haven for some of your
home or tax expenses is well known -- as long as you are prepared to
make a profit at least one year in six.
But the real appeal of making farming a financial haven is the capital
tax benefit -- as long as you act before the next Labour Government
does!
The situation at the moment is that if you sell your home and invest
the money in a farm for more than two years, 100% business property
relief will take care of the inheritance tax when you pass it on to the
next generation. And the present Government intends to extend this
relief to land that is let.
It is easy to operate, and you don't even need to get your hands
dirty. You can rely on contract or share-farming agreements with a
specialist to turn in the gross margin which funds the fixed costs. It
needn't involve more than a quarterly meeting with your farmer either.
If you prefer to retire and enjoy your hard-earned cash for yourself,
retirement relief will take care of the worry of capital gains tax. This
is particularly attractive if you manage to get away with that 10 acres
for development.
So if you think a Labour Government is a real possibility at the next
election, this may be the year to buy the farm.

WEST OF SCOTLAND SECONDARY
By George Nisbet, DM Hall
RECOVERY in the prime property market in Glasgow and the West of
Scotland is still some way off. But the good news is that there is a lot
more activity in the secondary market.
Our offices on this side of the country -- Glasgow, Kirkintilloch,
Hamilton, Irvine and Ayr -- all report that a large number of the
secondary properties which have been around for a long time have either
been sold or are attracting a lot of interest.
The market has been in a state of flux for several years, with a
limited number of transactions taking place. Much of this was due to the
depressed economic climate. The property market seems to be one of the
last industry sectors to move out of recession. One of the reasons for
this is the vast number of poor quality, repossessed properties which
have been clogging it up for the past two years.
Although these have distorted the market, we are successfully
concluding transactions on many of them, and it looks as if the stock of
repossessions is slowly but surely being taken up. We sold more than 60
properties of this kind in the last year, with most of the sales taking
place in the second half.
Some heritable creditors seem to have decided to move repossessions
from their stock, and public roups or auctions have been a very
successful way of marketing them.
DM Hall has been joint auctioneer for some repossessed properties over
the last six to nine months. Most were sold, but this has been at the
cost of very low reserve and sale prices. In many cases the purchasers
were picking up genuine bargains. The best examples are in the
repossessed licenced trade sector. Buyers have been acquiring
closed-down pubs at knockdown prices, carrying out minor refurbishment
and redecoration, re-opening them and subsequently re-marketing them as
going concerns -- at dramatically increased values and prices.
The market for poorer quality secondary retail properties -- where
there is a general over-supply -- is still depressed. The problem is
more severe in specific locations. Tollcross and Shettleston, for
example, are still adjusting to the opening of the Parkhead Forge
development. A plethora of traditional tenement shop units are available
in these locations; demand is low, so values and prices have dropped.
This is not the case for most of the other secondary retail locations,
such as Dumbarton Road in Partick, though. Properties are still
available, but rents and prices have held up well and we've seen several
increases, particularly in the best pitches.
The office market is still slow, particularly in the Park area of the
city, where the over-supply situation is acute -- especially in the less
popular streets. This hasn't prevented a few transactions taking place,
but as a rule tenants are being offered strong incentives and buyers are
acquiring properties at pre-1989 prices.
Our firm is marketing a fully refurbished, open-plan office with car
parking on the first floor of Trinity House. Extensive efforts have been
made and the asking price is reasonable -- but there has been no serious
interest in the past six months.
The industrial market has been very active, however, and it is in this
sector that we have achieved most of our successful sales and lettings.
The strongest demand is for units under 3000 sq ft and on a sale rather
than lease basis. We have sold some units in this category at closing
dates. Two at Hillington Industrial Estate attracted a great deal of
interest. Both were under 2000 sq ft, and they went for more than the
upset price within six weeks of going on the market.
There is also a demand for poorer quality dated industrial properties
inside the city boundary -- at the right price. We sold five in the
Bridgeton and Dalmarnock areas in the last six months. It has to be said
they were available for some time, but eventually we concluded
satisfactory transactions.
Currently there is a great deal of interest in what we would describe
as hybrids. Prominence is an important factor here, and two good
examples are properties in Aikenhead Road and Lochleven Drive, where we
achieved quick sales at the closing dates at prices well above the
upset. We had several offers for both -- an encouraging sign.
Outside Glasgow the market is still poor, with few enquiries and
general difficulty in getting a satisfactory disposal. Exceptions are
better quality properties of the industrial or warehousing kind.
We have found an upsurge in demand for good quality land for
residential development too. Over the last 12 months we have sold
several sites in the West of Scotland, ranging from small infills to
four acres in Troon, and we successfully marketed a development site in
Bishopbriggs which went to a closing date for offers last month.
The demand for residential land isn't coming only from the national
house builders. Local builders and developers are in the frame as well,
and we are confident this will continue, as there is now a shortage of
good quality development land and strong demand across the board.
There are a few clouds on the horizon which are largely outwith the
control of the property professionals. The biggest concern is the
imposition of rates on vacant properties at 50% of the normal level. It
is difficult to predict what effect this will have, as it will depend to
some extent on the approach taken by the individual rating authorities.
We could find ourselves in the same position as a developer who
completed a modern office or warehouse and couldn't find an occupier,
leaving him responsible for the rates for an unlimited period. This
situation would also affect the occupiers of business premises who were
thinking of relocating to somewhere larger. The imposition of rates on
their existing property might discourage them from relocating, as it is
unlikely they would move until it had been let or sold.
The recovery in the property market is delicate at the moment. It
wouldn't take very much to halt the movement back to normal activity --
and there are any number of things which could mean a return to very
poor market conditions. These include loan finance becoming less
available, vacant rates charges and another increase in interest rates.
The signs of recovery we are beginning to see need to be fostered and
nurtured if everyone is to benefit.

GLASGOW INDUSTRIAL
By James Thomson, DTZ Debenham Thorpe
THERE is a growing sense of frustration in Glasgow's industrial
market. Companies looking for buildings capable of servicing modern
requirements lack choice across the size and specification range.
To an extent, the problem is masked at present as demand for
industrial property remains muted. However, when occupiers with exacting
requirements do enter the market they often face a choice of compromise
or relocation. Over recent years, this has benefitted the new towns,
with the final straw for many being the announcement that AG Barr will
relocate its manufacturing facility to Cumberanuld. The Lanarkshire
Enterprise Zone threatens to continue the trend.
For footloose operations and inward investors, the logic of the
incentives, choice and established environments variously offered by
these alternatives are often irresistible. However, for many Glasgow
companies the move is made with great reluctance. A recent snapshot
survey by DTZ Debenham Thorpe of Glasgow's ''emigrants'' reveals that if
opportunities had been available many would have preferred to stay.
Furthermore, in dealing with inward investors Locate in Scotland finds
that Glasgow is a destination in its own right, and that many companies
would prefer it to new town or enterprise zone locations if
opportunities existed.
So why does Glasgow continue not only to miss out on inward investment
opportunities but also to lose local companies? According to Glasgow
District Council, from an industrial stock of 4.75m sq ft only 5% to 8%
is new or good quality refurbished space. Of that which is vacant, 50%
is in units of less than 11,000 sq ft. The bulk of industrial stock,
therefore, is in small units and lacks the format, specification and
image to attract increasingly demanding businesses.
Current development is not addressing the problem. Of 460,000 sq ft
under construction at the turn of the year, the majority comprised two
bespoke buildings and the remainder did not include a single substantial
speculative development. There is currently only one such scheme on site
in Glasgow, Portal Holding's 10,000 sq ft building at No 1 Houston
Street in Kinning Park. This is surely a remarkable state of affairs for
a major UK city.
There are planning consents for 100 hectares of land, however the
timing for development on the key sites is uncertain due to a
combination of contamination, required infrastructure and funding.
Currently, therefore, there is no identifiable development programme to
address the lack of quality space. Development is choked by a shortage
of good and unencumbered opportunities and a lack of confidence among
investors, developers and occupiers alike.
But perhaps this supply picture accurately reflects Glasgow's demand
profile. After all, it is an area of industrial decline which
experienced an 8.1% fall in manufacturing employment during 1981-91 and
has seen the decimation of traditional industries.
This is not the full story though. Recent research by DTZ Debenham
Thorpe demonstrates that the overall picture of decline masks industrial
change. While traditional industries have contracted, new sectors such
as telecoms, printing and publishing, electrical engineering and the
manufacture of transport equipment have grown. Furthermore, substantial
growth in the office-based service sector has generated opportunities
for new industrial companies.
The nature of demand is also changing. Increasingly we are
encountering companies in research-based fields such as pharmaceuticals,
bio-technology, computers and electronics who require a new breed of
buildings with high office content, better environment and an improved
image. For example, London and Clydebank's scheme at Dunrobin Court in
Clydebank Business Park is now experiencing strong demand from the
medical research sector, drawn by its attractive appearance and
flexibility.
The change to a more mixed and balanced industrial base in Glasgow
will be accompanied by a desire over time among many existing companies
to upgrade their accommodation and from national companies to secure
buildings for regional operations to the standards they apply elsewhere.
So although the overall industrial base in Glasgow is declining, the
emerging blend of industries will not be satisfied with yesterday's
buildings.
The prevailing economic conditions have instilled a make-do attitude
among occupiers, but this cannot last indefinitely as conditions
improve. The upturn in demand, when it comes, could be sudden and
substantial.
The response to this problem lies with the big sites such as
Cambuslang Investment Park, Springhill Farm, Robroyston and Cardonald
Park, where there are opportunities to develop good quality well-managed
schemes able to address the concerns of investors and developers and
satisfy occupier needs. They are the opportunities for Glasgow to
develop industrial parks able to compete in the wider Scottish market.
Inevitably, creating the pre-conditions for development is costly,
particularly bearing in mind the history of some of the sites. Great
strides have been made at Cardonald and Cambuslang though, demonstrating
the way ahead. It will, however, fall to the public sector to pump-prime
these sites to the stage when private investment will come forward.
There is now the chance for the various public sector bodies to
co-operate and help shape these opportunities to address the full
spectrum of demand, and to draw out both private sector experience and
resources to their maximum potential. The cost of failing to do so will
be further additions to the long list of companies lost for Glasgow.

REVALUATION
By Gordon McArthur, James Barr &amp; Son
WITH the mountain of information and advice on the revaluation and
changes in business rates, any businessman or woman could be forgiven
for failing to see the benefits of such an upheaval.
The dust surrounding the issue of the 1995 revaluation notices is now
beginning to settle, but out of that is emerging a smog of valuation
techniques which, in many cases, have left businesses blinded by rating
science.
There is a temptation to push aside this barrage of information, but
the danger is that not only could you end up paying over the odds in the
next five years, but in doing so you may set a precedent for rates
thereafter which is not necessarily appropriate.
Appeals must be lodged with the Regional Assessor in writing by
September 15, or within six months of the date of issue of the
revaluation notice. It is important, meanwhile, that payments are be met
in full to avoid the imposition of a non-recoverable penalty.
Even if the rateable value of a property has fallen, resulting in a
reduction in rates payments, this should still be investigated as if you
later become unhappy for any reason with the bills you are receiving you
may find it is too late to appeal.
The so-called harmonisation has been both positive and negative in
Scotland. The setting of a uniform business rate was welcome,
particularly in the central belt where the new rate of 43.2p showed a
substantial reduction from, for example, Glasgow's 52.9p. Countering
this was the complete abolition of industrial derating in Scotland, set
at 10% in 1994/95.
The transitional relief arrangements limit the increase on property
rates from 1994/5. They also aim to provide additional protection for
businesses with a rateable value of less than #10,000 at April 1 this
year.
The most significant change is the levying of rates on unoccupied
property. Certain classes of building, empty continuously for more than
three months, will now be faced with paying 50% of normal rates. Such
properties will receive full relief for three months, and only 50%
relief thereafter, although they will still receive 100% relief on water
and sewerage charges. The Scottish local authorities have interpreted
the qualifying empty period as from January 1 this year.
Ratepayers with shops or offices are looking for ways to avoid this
new liability. Discussions have taken place with some Scottish assessors
as to how far ''soft stripping'' should go to render a property
incapable of occupation, or at which stage construction should be
suspended on a new development to avoid its appearance on the valuation
roll, but as yet no decisions have been taken. It may require litigation
to resolve some cases.
One suggested solution is persuading a charitable organisation to
occupy the premises, freeing the owner of any liability. The
organisation may then, if it satisfies the local authority, enjoy full
remission of rates.
The revaluation may be harmonising rates north and south of the
Border, but it remains to be seen whether businesses UK-wide, which are
struggling to focus in the fog of facts surrounding the revaluation
procedure, view it in such a positive light.

By Ian Carruth, Jones Lang Wootton
IHAVE recently been writing my business plan for 1995/96 and, like all
good surveyors, I have been trying to sound as positive as possible with
regard to future prospects and, in particular, the opportunities for
development over the next 12 months.
However, even with my rose-tinted spectacles on, I am struggling to
become enthusiastic. Most sectors of the market will continue to see a
considerable amount of work being carried out on development appraisals,
consultancy, research and exercises in forward funding, but, whether
this will lead to any bricks being laid in the ground is debatable.
In Glasgow, there is clear evidence that the existing office supply
within the central business area is below that of an average year's
take-up. Although there is another 150,000 sq ft of either new or
refurbished space due for completion this year, this should hopefully be
compensated for by at least double that amount being leased even if only
around 40% of the known requirements reach binding agreement stage.
The classic signs are, therefore, in place for an office development
boom, so why is this is not taking place? There appears to be no easy
answer but a combination of reasons. There is a lack of quality sites
where properties can be developed without the restrictions of retaining
listed facades and the effect this has on layouts, floor to ceiling
heights and cost.
There are a number of opportunities arising for the redevelopment of
existing early seventies buildings, which are now nearing the end of
their original lease terms. In most cases, these can be demolished and
replaced with larger, more attractive structures.
However, the majority of properties are owned by institutions and
pension funds which are reluctant to commit themselves to carrying out
speculative development, although there are a number of notable
exceptions. Scottish Life is extensively refurbishing 48 St Vincent
Street; Friends Provident will shortly commence work on the
redevelopment of Alhambra House in Waterloo Street, and Scottish
Amicable is preparing plans for the redevelopment of Ashley House in
West George Street.
Competition from out of town business parks and the new concept of the
mid-urban office park may also be deterring developers from carrying out
speculative development within the central area.
During the past few months, a number of sites have been acquired by
developers for business park-type development within the city. Miller
Developments has acquired a site, in conjunction with Catren Properties,
at Shields Road/Scotland Street and, in conjunction with CTP, is the
nominated developer for Pacific Quay.
The latter, for instance, is suitable for a mid-urban office park.
Typically, this type of site contains a mix of office, leisure and
small-scale retail space, providing a complete working environment
rather than offices in isolation.
Their development is in response to the changing needs of occupier
businesses, which require low-density office parks without leaving towns
and cities altogether. There is strong evidence that businesses that
cannot find such an environment in their preferred location will select
other towns and cities for relocation or continued growth. Consequently,
this form of provision is a crucial component of urban economic
development for the nineties.
Hopefully, the development at Pacific Quay will provide an actual
example of this type of development -- it is planned to include the
Scottish National Science Centre, a 10-screen cinema, a restaurant, bars
and a budget hotel. There will be approximately 357,000 sq ft of
business space plus a major office development of 150,000 sq ft,
suitable for an inward investor.
The market, therefore, appears to be divided between the possible
redevelopment or refurbishment of existing seventies buildings, which in
the majority of cases will be carried out by their institutional owners,
and more traditional speculative development in a business park
environment, preferably close to the city centre.
From the perspective of the city, there are compelling reasons for
provision of a quality mid-urban business park, as well as the more
traditional city centre office development. Glasgow requires an uplift
in its profile to be able to compete more effectively on the
international stage.
The provision of a mid-urban office park as one component of a broadly
based portfolio of property products would give it the ability to offer
international and national companies the environment they are now
seeking. The emergence of high quality office and business park
accommodation has helped the UK hold a competitive advantage over other
European countries in attracting Japanese and American companies, which
have traditionally liked this type of accommodation and the benefits it
provides.

TRAILBLAZING, when applied to this week's ground-breaking
entrepreneur, is no mere metaphorical adjective. For not only do Charles
Gulland's All Round Buildings demonstrate a completely new concept in
terms of design, materials, and construction but they are also to be
found literally, constructed at various points along Scottish highland
trails.
Charles Gulland's trailblazing buildings are made of timber but all
the same, they are a radical alternative to traditional wooden buildings
for the new philosophy on which their design rests is an undiluted
concern for the future of the environment. About half the world's timber
-- one of its most precious resources -- is being wasted by the practice
of thinning to make way for the full growth of the trees, he explains.
Young trees are either pulped or burned because nobody can find a good
use for them.
However, since 1993 and the establishment of Gulland's All Round
Buildings at Redgorton in Perthshire, Scotland's wasted forest thinnings
are being utilised in a more ecologically sound as well as valuable and
useful manner.
Gulland produces a number of different rural buildings or shelters,
all of them made of freshly felled forest thinnings. The most popular
structure is the Wigwam. It is a rounded pyramid in shape, not unlike a
wooden tent, the conifer poles which form the framework being bent while
fresh to form the prestressed timber structure. This makes for strength
and a natural form which reflects the curves of the surrounding
landscape. The framework is then clad outside in timber clinker, while
inside is a non-combustible lining which fully insulates the building.
The floor stands clear of the ground to encourage air circulation
beneath, and also to allow for erection on uneven ground. Inside is a
cooking area, sleeping platforms and room for a stove.
Two of these all-weather all-season cabins, which can sleep up to six
people, have already been constructed for farmers with camp-sites on the
West Highland Way. The Wigwams provide basic accommodation at a low cost
for passing walkers and back-packers, and the rate of return has been
more than satisfactory to their farmer owners. Two more are on order.
And there are others, isolated havens erected in the wilder and remoter
parts of Scotland, from Sutherland in the north to the Southern Upland
Way in the south, and all used as bothies for weary walkers.
Gulland also makes a landscape shelter which is similar in design, but
without the lockable door. It can be used as a fishing-hut, summer-house
or barbecue hut or a shelter for golf-courses or beaches.
Smaller structures include the All Round Shelter, a simple
construction of wooden canopy above four spruce poles. This has been in
great demand from district councils, countryside parks and other rural
authorities, and they are used for a variety of purposes including
information shelters, sheltered picnic table, barbecue seat and so on.
A new and exciting design is shortly to be executed for Muirshiel
Country Park in Renfrewshire. Again the bent wooden framework of two
shelters has the look of an ancient Pictish dwelling and blends well in
the natural landscape; but this time there is a barbecue picnic area to
be constructed between the two wigwams.
The Longhouse is the largest of Gulland's buildings. One of these -- a
spacious, well-lit, fully insulated building -- has been in constant use
since it was first constructed as a home for a dairyman and his wife in
1990. And in order to exploit its commercial potential more fully,
Gulland's next project is the participation in an engineering research
project with Heriot Watt University. The resulting engineering
certificate will allow him to market the Longhouse more professionally
as a durable, sound and comfortable year-round home as well as the
product of sustainable home-grown resources which blends naturally into
every rural landscape.
In fact this design was Gulland's first. It was the culminating
achievement of his two year course at Hooke Park College, Dorset. The
aim was to provide graduates with the skills necessary to establish
rural manufacturing enterprises.
And as far as Charles Gulland is concerned, it has emphatically
succeeded. In 1992 as Designer in Residence with the Countryside
Commission for Scotland he was winner of the Nat West/National Farmers'
Union Venture Cash Business Award. And since 1993, when he established
his rural enterprise, he has had to take an assistant to cope with the
demand; while on the basis of this year's figures he expects that next
year's turnover will top #100,000.
His association with trees looks like being as commercially productive
as it has been innovative. The odd thing is -- he comes originally from
Caithness where there are no trees at all.

Ian Harland speaks to a man who has an unpaid but very large and
devoted workforce. His only problem is that their output depends on
sunny weather.
JIM Ballantyne has nearly 10 million workers, and does not pay any of
them. It seems an employers dream, especially considering the workfoce
could double in summer if the weather is good.
Based in the village of Weston, near Dunsyre in Lanarkshire, Jim is a
beekeeper, and with his wife Lesley, runs the Pentland Bee Farm. ''It
started when I was a child,'' said Jim, ''my father bought two hives. I
couldn't keep my hands off them. I've been hooked since then.'' After a
variety of different jobs, in 1975 Jim's passion for bees became a
full-time occupation.
The main income of any professional beekeeper is from honey. It is a
business fraught with difficulties. ''Over a 10-year period, it probably
averages out at 20lbs of honey each year per hive. Although it's very
much a glut or nothing, depending on how much sun and rain we have
through the summer months.''
Scotland is not the ideal place to keep bees. In England an average
hive can produce double the amount of honey. There are several different
strains of the European honey bee, Jim uses the dark black type, which
is much more tolerant of the Scottish climate. ''It flies at lower
temperatures,'' said Jim, by way of explanation.
To produce a reasonable amount of honey from each hive requires
careful management. ''To obtain a good crop, we have to continually move
the hives from one site to another, you cannot just put them in one
place and leave them there. You have to follow the nectar.'' Jim's hives
can be found from Stirling south to Edinburgh and the Clyde Valley.
In spring the bees are moved to the oil seed rape fields, then to
clover, and finally to the hills for the heather, (known as ling). They
then return to the winter sites, awaiting the first spring flowers, such
as snowdrops, before the cycle begins again.
The honey bee has a continuous requirement for nectar to produce
honey, and pollen to breed. During the summer the average worker bee
lives for six weeks, and the queen breeds constantly to provide
replacements. At the end of the year, the bees overwinter, relying on
food stored in the hive to sustain them until spring, when they begin
breeding again. The average winter hive contains over 15,000 bees.
Using bees to pollinate crops, such as oil seed rape, enables farmers
to harvest them two weeks later than they would otherwise be able to. In
England, the Beefarmers Association, of which Jim is a member, have
negotiated a deal with farmers so that for each hive in an apple
orchard, the beekeeper is paid #25. No such arrangement has been made in
Scotland, and no income is generated from the placement of hives.
After several successful years building the business, in 1985 disaster
struck. It rained constantly throughout the summer. In bad weather the
bees will not fly. Although it was not a problem feeding them, there was
no pollen to enable the bees to breed.
''By the following spring we had lost 90% of our bees. Only 20 hives
remained. 1986 was a difficult year, we lost several customers because
we could only supply a limited amount of honey.''
Looking back, Jim believes the experience has made him a better
beekeeper. ''If the weather was as bad again there is a pollen
substitute available to feed them. However, at the time it seemed like
the end.''
Since that low point, the business has been rebuilt. Starting with 20
hives, through a constant breeding programme, Jim now has over 500
hives. The number of customers taking honey has increased annually since
then.
In 1991 the couple introduced a range of beeswax candles.''From spring
to autumn we have always been very busy, in summer 18-hour days are
usual. But in winter we were relatively quiet. The candles gave us an
opportunity to use this time.'' The candles have been more successful
than the Ballantynes imagined, and now account for one third of their
turnover. ''We are now making candles all year to meet the demand.''
All occupations have their downside, and beekeepers are not immune to
stings. However, this is more than compensated for by the constant
supply of honey. Once tasted, it is difficult to contemplate returning
to the jars bearing the same name on the supermarket shelves.
The growth of the business goes hand in hand with the health of the
hives; ''to keep bees successfully, to earn a living from it, you have
to love bees,'' says Jim. ''In some ways it seems bees are in my blood.
My great-grandparents kept bees, and today I put hives on the same sites
they used in the 1850s.''
Jim is constantly looking for new markets, and is currently talking to
a customer in America who wishes to sell the honey and candles through a
mail order catalogue. He is also talking to the Clydesdale Development
Company and Lanarkshire Development Agency: ''I would like to find a way
of demonstrating to the general public the wonder of the honey bee in
its natural surroundings.''

SCOTTISH export orders stagnated over the past for months to April,
albeit from a high level, lagging behind overall Scottish demand which
continued to grow, according to the CBI's Regional Trends Survey
produced jointly with Business Strategies, the regional economic
consultancy group.
The survey also shows, though, that manufacturers' export orders grew
faster than total orders in six out of the 11 designated UK areas. And
for the coming four months Scottish firms expect export demand to grow
but at a slower pace than total orders.
The findings would appear on the surface to contradict those of the
Scottish Council Development and Industry's latest quarterly export
index which had exports soaring in the first quarter of 1995 but this
was in comparison with the first quarter of 1994 and the CBI says that
Scottish exports were strong throughout 1994.
The CBI survey reveals that confidence about export prospects for the
year ahead has risen further in every area.
Scottish manufacturers remain cautiously optimistic about general
business conditions, perhaps helped by a sharp rise in total orders
after a weak four months to January. Firms expect that this upward trend
in total orders will be sustained over the next four months. However,
for the second survey in a row, Scottish export orders have marked time.
That said, Scottish manufacturing export growth did outstrip that of
the rest of the UK throughout 1994 and export levels may, therefore, be
strong. Moreover manufacturers expect this halt in export growth to be
only temporary and are looking for a rise in new exports in the next
four months -- although they are not so optimistic about prospects for
the coming year. Other evidence supports a rise in exports in the first
half of 1995.
Scottish manufacturing output has recovered and expectations are that
this growth will continue in the next four months, but at a more modest
rate. Manufacturers indiciate that despite continued output growth,
there will be pressure on stocks of finished goods in the next four
months.
Although just under a quarter of firms in the last survey indicated
that they intended to expand capacity, the number of firms working below
capacity has fallen to 28%, the lowest level in the UK. Just under a
third of all firms indicate that capacity remains a constraint on
output.
Estimates of Scottish manufacturing employment derived from the survey
indicate that the downward trend is continuing although at a slower
rate. Employment is forecast to be 337,000 in June, a fall of less than
1% compared with March.
So far as costs and prices are concerned, average unit costs rose in
the last four months, roughly as expected. However, domestic selling
prices rose at a lower rate than anticipated in the January survey.
Manufacturers consider that costs will continue to rise, albeit at a
less dramatic rate, over the next four months.
Domestic prices are expected to continue rising at roughly the same
rate as unit costs. Export prices rose along with domestic prices over
the last four months although the rise was well below that expected.
Export prices are expected to continue rising over the next four months
at a more moderate rate than anticipated in January.
The survey shows that Scottish business optimism increased by 9%
compared with 13% for the UK as a whole.

EDINBURGH should heed the lessons of Birmingham if it is make a
success of its new international conference centre.
Bernard Zissman, former Lord Mayor of Birmingham and a key figure in
the setting up of its international convention centre in 1991, said a
great deal of effort was required to develop business tourism.
''There is no doubt that the business tourist is a very different
being to the holiday tourist and has to be looked at in a different
way,'' he said.
''In Birmingham the business community did not believe the convention
centre was going to happen until it actually opened. People were late in
getting on board the bandwagon.
''There are a hell of a lot of opportunities for hotels, restaurants,
nightclub, coaches, taxis, catering and a range of services actually at
the centre itself.''
Mr Zissman, who will address a seminar organised by the Edinburgh
Chamber of Commerce tonight, said there was a need to avoid the pitfalls
of Brighton, Bournemouth and Blackpool where local populations were used
to holiday tourism but tended to treat conference delegates with disdain
as an interference in their daily lives.
He said the convention centre had changed the profile of Birmingham
from a fairly dirty manufacturing city to a thriving business and
financial centre, second only to London.
It had also rekindled a sense of pride by the people who lived there
and depended on the centre, directly or indirectly, for their
livelihoods.
''I suspect that pride is already there among the citizens of
Edinburgh. They are already well-used to leisure tourism, but they are
going to have to look a business tourist in a slightly different way. It
is a more demanding market'' Mr Zissman added.

KPMG tax partner Donald Adamson explains what to to expect and how to
survive a tax investigation
LAST year in Scotland the Inland Revenue carried out just over 3500
tax investigations, well ahead of their targeted figure.
So what can you expect if, as a small business owner, one of the
dreaded brown envelopes comes crashing through your letterbox? It is
then that you will want to ensure your tax advisers are experienced in
dealing with tax investigations.
First thing to remember is that the arrival of this unwanted
communication is not the first step.
The inspectors will have established that you have, on the face of it,
a case to answer and unknown to you you will have been the subject of a
thorough preliminary review. Their case could be based on a range of
things, from late filing of returns, or failure to notify to more
detailed examination such as inadequate margins, low drawings or
inconsistent business ratios.
In some cases, the investigation will be part of a national sweep
taking in all companies within a certain industry. In the recent past
the music industry and fishing boats have been targeted.
The Inland Revenue should set out their grounds for investigation at
the outset. Don't be afraid to challenge them. If the initial reasons
are groundless and demonstrably so, then the investigation should cease
there and then.
Many of the assumptions made in their decision are based on Revenue
publications called Business Economic Notes (BENs) which are produced
for specific industry sectors. These give a general background in the
industry and a guide to running costs, some industry jargon, labour
costs, prices and profit margins.
This latter area can sometimes be the key that triggers an
investigation. If your overall profit margin is down on the generally
accepted norm for your business sector then that discrepancy may
encourage suspicion.
It may be useful to you to obtain a copy of these BENs so that you
know what the benchmarks for your industry actually are for the tax man.
Once you have a better understanding of what the case is against you
the key to the whole process is preparation.
With your adviser you should review your accounts and look carefully
for genuine mistakes which need to be brought to the inspector's notice.
In addition, work out with your adviser a mark-up exercise to see just
what your levels are, and again apply against the norms.
Following on from the initial letter the next step is a meeting with a
tax inspector.
Depending on the complexity of your affairs and the inspector's
workload this can sometimes take months to happen and one of the key
issues for you in the interim has to be the stress that an event such as
this creates.
Not only do you have to keep one hand on the tiller of the
investigation preparation but you have to run your business too -- and
often in a painstakingly almost over-careful way as you try not to run
the risk of adding further problems to those you may already have.
At the interview be polite and co-operative as this is all part of the
process, but don't try to be overly or inaccurately helpful. Remember it
is better to go away and research a point than take a guess and find out
at the end of the day that you are being held to your word.
Honesty is the best policy, but don't let the inspector away with
points you disagree on.
Keep detailed and accurate notes of the meeting as these could be
useful later.
If at the end of the day it is discovered that there is a problem and
you have to agree a settlement, prepare an accurate and careful
statement of your living expenses and make sure that's on the table
early. Don't forget however that the Inland Revenue is increasingly
conscious of the need to be cost-effective and consciously or
unconsciously you will find it fits the size of the settlement to
available means of the taxpayer.
But equally this is the time when your preparation and courtesy may
pay off. The inspector will start with the assumption that you will pay
100% of the settlement figure and this will come down depending on your
level of co-operation, the size and nature of the error.
This is an area where professional help can be invaluable, as it may
be possible to make a good case for limiting the timescale.
More particularly, your tax adviser should be taking the initiative
throughout; should not be merely reactive to the investigation; and be
supportive of you.
You also have the right of appeal to the Tax Commissioners. This is an
informal tribunal where you can appeal if you cannot reach agreement. If
your case is sound then you shouldn't be afraid to exercise your rights.

Harry Conroy finds a flourishing independent film and television
production company in the Highlands
CROMARTY, a tiny village on the northern tip of the Black Isle, would
not be the first choice for most people as the location for an
independent film and television production company serving mainly London
masters.
Don Coutts did not think of it first either. Indeed, you could say it
was his third choice. He spent the past 27 years, first working in
broadcasting in London before making what could be described as a
halfway house move to Glasgow.
Then, last year, when his partnership with Stuart Cosgrove in the Big
Star in a Wee Picture independent film production company broke up, Don
decided to go back to his roots in the Black Isle.
At 45, Don was not considering early retirement when he and his wife
Lindy Cameron returned north. Instead they had decided to try and have
the best of both worlds, doing what they were good at -- producing
television films -- while at the same time enjoying a better quality of
life with their two young children Erin and Eva.
Together the couple formed the aptly named Move On Up film and
television company and headed for Cromarty.
''I was born in Laggan Bridge near Newtonmore and wanted to go back
north to see if it could work,'' says Don.
All the signs are that the move has been a success although he admits,
''there are added problems being in the north''.
To ease those problems, Don and Lindy purchased an AVID machine which
Don describes as a ''digital non-linear editing machine'' which is
housed in a workshop in the garden.
''The machine means that we can do everything right up to the
finishing touches here. We only go to Glasgow or Edinburgh for the final
edit,'' he says.
The writing and other pre-production work is also done in Cromarty,
although the pair have to move around when actually filming but that
would be the case no matter where they were based.
''Lindy does most of the editing but I am away from Cromarty about 30%
of my time, and if it remains at this ratio then we can handle it. I
want to spend as much time as possible with my kids.''
Don began his career in film and television production as a clerk with
Columbia before moving on to the cutting room and editing. He was a
director of the BBC Open Door series which he described as an
''enjoyable experience'' but left in 1981 and launched himself into the
uncertain world of independent production.
However his partnership with Stuart Cosgrove proved to be a success
and the Big Star in a Wee Picture was one of the most successful
independent companies with an annual turnover approaching #2m.
Starting all over again from a location 30 miles north of Inverness
was a big gamble but Move On Up has been working flat out since it was
launched last June.
Tonight Scottish Television viewers can see one product of this hard
work when the documentary Cowboys in Skirts is screened. The programme
follows the production of the Rob Roy feature film. At present Don is
working on a video for Capercaillie's new single.
He may be living proof that you can be based in Scotland and be a
successful independent film producer but Don is not convinced that
Scotland will succeed in breaking the dependence on London, or that a
feature film industry can be established in this country.
He points to the heavy concentration of film and TV companies in
London giving it certain advantages.
''I remember sitting outside on the pavement at one of the Charlotte
Street restuarants with Stuart Cosgrove when a TV producer happened to
walk past and joined us. By the end of our conversation we had fixed up
a deal to make a film.
''On the shuttle back to Scotland Stuart and I joked about how it was
impossible to land such a job sitting in Glasgow but that is how
business is done in London.''

TENS of thousands of people took to the streets in Zaragosa last night
chanting: ''Nayin! Nayin!'' after the former Spurs midfielder's goal
brought the industrial city in north-east Spain its first European
trophy in 31 years.
The whole of Spain exploded in a fiesta as the 29-year-old Nayin, who
England coach Terry Venables brought out of obscurity as part of the
Gary Lineker transfer deal from Barcelona to Tottenham, scored the most
dramatic goal in any European final.
''Gol! Gol!'' was the shout as Zaragosa took to the streets. In live
reports they had heard Nayin saying: ''What could I have done? It was
the final minute of extra time. I took a chance and hit the ball. I hit
it right -- that's obvious -- to beat such a keeper.
''This is not a dream. It was like winning a fortune. When I saw the
ball drop over the outstretched fingers of the Arsenal keeper I just
sank to my knees, and then I was smothered.''

From KEN GALLACHER in Paris
Arsenal 1, Real Zaragosa 2 (after extra time)
ARSENAL goalkeeper David Seaman, the man whose saves in the semi-final
penalty shoot out against Sampdoria brought his club to the Parc des
Princes last night, seemed to blunder seconds from the end of this final
to allow Zaragosa victory.
Yet as the last line of defence was left with his head bowed in
despair as the European Cup-winners Cup was snatched from the Highbury
team's grasp in the cruellest of ways, Stewart Houston, the Scot who
guided Arsenal to the final, sprang to the defence of his keeper after
the match.
Houston said: ''I don't blame Seaman at all. I don't know if he is
blaming himself, but as far as I'm concerned he played very well for us
tonight.''
The goal from the former Spurs player Nayim was scored with Seaman off
his line, and the Zaragoza man more than 50 yards from goal. But Houston
insisted: ''It was a magnificent strike. I did not think it was a fluke.
''I feel very bad for David Seaman. He was the man who got us here
with those penalty saves in the semi-final. He has been remembered for
that. Now he'll be remembered because that ball dropped over his head.
That's not right.''
''There was a sting in the tail against Sampdoria, there was another
sting in the tail tonight -- unfortunately it went against us.
''I don't think I could have asked for any more from my team. Actually
I was thinking about who would take the penalty when they scored.''
Houston refused to comment on his own position regarding the permanent
manager's job at Highbury.
The final word on that goal came from Nayim himself, who admitted: ''I
don't know if it was a brilliant goal or not. I think maybe I became
lucky.''
That will be little consolation to Arsenal this morning.
The game had looked as if it was heading inevitably towards yet
another sudden death ending when the fatal error arrived to hand the
Spaniards the trophy. Nayim took possession far out on the right side of
the field some 50 yards or so from goal.
The player, barracked throughout by the Arsenal fans, then exacted his
revenge. He looked up, saw the Seaman had strayed dangerously far off
his goal-line and sent a long high ball towards goal. The keeper was
slow to recognise the danger and by the time he did it was too late.
Arsenal had arrived in Paris confident of becoming the first team to
win the trophy in successive seasons. They left for home last night in
tears,
And, yet, this patched-up Highbury side came so close to pulling off
yet another famous result. They saw Martin Keown and Nigel Winterburn
both go off injured.
Keown was stretchered off at the end of the first half. Winterburn
went within minutes of the start of the second half.
David Hillier and Stephen Morrow replaced them and in that spell as
the new men tried to settle in, Zaragosa began to play with a flowing
confidence.
Their little captain Bardeza, easily the man of the match, began to
run the show and Arsenal had no answer to his skills. He had one chance
himself when he went past Stefan Schwarz in the fiftieth minute and then
saw Seaman save his shot at the near post.
Then he set up a chance for Esnaider which Seaman saved again. But by
now, as the game progressed, the Spaniards seemed to grow in stature and
after 67 minutes, they scored a stunning opener.
Esnaider, an Argentine youth international, powered in a shot from 30
yards which Seaman made no effort to stop.
Somehow Arsenal battled back. With Tony Adams limping badly, they drew
on all their reserves of grit and determination to claw themselves back
match.
Quarter of an hour from the end, they equalised. Parlour began the
move on the right, Paul Nerson pushed a ball towards the Zaragosa
six-yard line where John Hartson reached it just before Ian Wright to
score with a close range shot, and the Zaragosa defence lying in ruins.
Eight minutes from the end, that man Bardeza was sent crashing in the
box after a Lee Dixon tackle. It looked a penalty, but the referee waved
play on despite the fierce protests from the Spaniards.
And so it was into extra time with Arsenal beginning to look tired and
Adans injury obviously causing him great distress.
Adams, the inspiration for this Highbury team was struggling badly and
the players around him knew that.
In the ninety-eighth minute, Aguado got to a Nayim cross before the
Arsenal skipper and directed a header for goal.
Seaman pushed it on to a post, it bounced back from there into his
arms, and Arsenal breathed again -- but not for long because that little
man, Nayim, was to have the last laugh on his tormentors in the stands
with the goal that gave Zaragosa the trophy for the first time.
There were five bookings, with two of them arriving in the first six
minutes as the Italian referee clearly decided he would not allow things
to get out of hand.
John Hartson saw the first yellow card in the second minute and
Higuera followed him four minutes after him.
Then, Paul Nerson was cautioned in that first half with two more
Spaniards being booked after half time, Belsue and Aragon.
On the night Arsenal eventually just did not have any more to give.
They did not reach the heights of their epic performances against
Auxerre in the quarter final and Sampdoria in the semi-final.
The injuries upset their game plan and they found Zaragosa
accomplished opposition.
Now caretaker manager Stewart Houston must wait to see if the Arsenal
board will confirm him as team manager on a permanent basis.
Before the game Arsenal maintained that this final would not affect
the decision no matter the result.
I hope they meant that. It would be a tragedy if Houston were to lose
the job he wants because of a mistake made by the goalkeeper in the last
moments of the match.

Manchester United 2, Southampton 1
DENIS Irwin held his nerves together to score a controversial late
penalty and take the title race into the final furlong.
Referee Paul Danson had upset Saints all night with contentious
decisions but United failed to take advantage until only eight minutes
remained.
Andy Cole seemed to have missed his chance when Dave Beasant raced
from his line to clear. But to the relief of United, the official
decided an offence had been committed.
Irwin strode up to tuck home his sixth goal of the campaign and ensure
that title rivals Blackburn must win at Liverpool on Sunday to be
certain of claiming United's crown.
In only five minutes, Old Trafford was silenced when Saints went
ahead. Gordon Watson slipped Jim Magilton through and Peter Schmeichel
could only parry the midfielder's chip into the air. Simon Charlton had
an easy task to nod into the empty goal.
It was the first goal the Dane had conceded in the Premiership at Old
Trafford since Graeme Sharp scored for Oldham last April -- 13 months
and 1472 playing minutes ago.
A second should have come in 13 minutes. Gary Pallister gave the ball
straight to Matt Le Tissier and he put Watson clear, but the striker
shot wide.
United hope was restore after Brian McClair's ball in from the left
had gone beyond Cole and when Ken Monkou and Simon Charlton got in each
other's way, he accepted the gift.
Southampton looked to be denied a clear penalty in the first minute of
the second half when Watson seemed to be brought down by Schmeichel, but
referee Danson once again upset the visitors.
United raised their game in response. Irwin had a shot deflected wide
and Paul Ince's flying header was brilliantly kept out by Beasant.
However, with eight minutes left, referee Danson spotted a push from
Monkou and pointed to the spot. Television replays confirmed there had
been contact from the Dutchman.
* SKY TV will be broadcasting both Sunday's games live. Liverpool v
Blackburn will be on Sky Sports, with simultaneous coverage of United's
game at West Ham on Sky Sports 2.
Bookmakers William Hill still make Blackburn favourites at 4-9, with
United 7-4.

Hibernian 1, Celtic 1
HIBS did themselves no favours but gave city rivals Hearts a lift in
an early evening premier show at Easter Road which had a lot going for
it, even if the net result means that Hibs' hopes of winning a place in
Europe next season are at an end.
Their point assures Motherwell of second place, no matter what happens
on Saturday when Hearts, still chasing safety, may not be as severely
tested as they might have been if Motherwell, whom they meet at
Tynecastle, were needing points for Europe.
Only a Cup-winners' Cup place now remains to be decided. That looked
no good bet for Celtic, either, after a sloppy first-half show.
In contrast, Hibs were full of life, fire, and confidence and might
have had more to show for their work than a single-goal lead, scored by
Kevin Harper. Celtic reappeared in more serious mood, and when Willie
Falconer equalised they looked capable of taking all three points.
The home side opened up with a tremendous enthusiasm, making the cup
finalists look pedestrian in the process, and Willie Miller, marking
Brian McLaughlin, found himself causing more damage as a left winger in
his own right. His runs down that flank had the Parkhead defence in
trouble from the off. In fact, Hibs utilised Pat McGinlay and Kevin
Harper down that beat whenever possible.
McGinlay, anxious to do well against his old team, overdid the diving
bit on the edge of the box, but the goal was on its way. Graham Mitchell
rolled a free kick to McGinlay, who flicked it ahead of Harper. The
young striker, a candidate for young player of the year, made no mistake
with his well-hit, left-foot effort after 10 minutes of almost complete
Hibs' domination. Typically, Celtic responded with a good attack which
ended with a Rudi Vata cross headed well by Willie Falconer and saved
equally impressively by Jim Leighton.
Hibs had left Harper, who had taken a knock, inside at the interval
and brought on Gareth Evans. Whether it was that change or a renewed
Celtic effort, the pattern was different for a while. Even so, the only
threat came from a Falconer header which went wide. It was fitting,
therefore, that he did get the equaliser in 60 minutes when he tapped
the ball over the line after a McLaughlin left-foot shot had been
stopped but not held by Leighton.
HIBS -- Leighton, Miller, Mitchell, McGinlay, Tweed, Hunter, Weir,
Millen, Wright, Harper, O'Neill. Substitutes -- Tortolano, Evans, Reid.
CELTIC -- Bonner, Boyd, McKinlay, Vata, O'Neil, Grant, McLaughlin,
McStay, Van Hooydonk, Falconer, O'Donnell. Substitutes -- McNally,
Nicholas, Marshall.
Referee -- J Herald (N Mearns).

James Robertson meets a former newspaper man who is set to make waves
with a charter vessel working the West Coast
WHERE does a cut-and-thrust newspaperman go when, after more than
three decades in the words factory, he falls victim to redundancy? Does
he stick to the last he knows and sleep with a mobile phone? Or does he
dwell on past ''splashes'', haunt newspaper pubs and donate his final
cheque to the drinks trade?
A good few years ago, one eminent editor, faced with the chop, found
another chair and invested his pay-off in a boat he named The Golden
Handshake.
Ian Metcalfe produced a scoop or two for that editor, and for many
others, until, at just over 50, he left the industry a year ago -- not
with a golden handshake but with one that was more of a silver-copper
alloy.
Ian too, has invested -- ''Don't say sunk!'' he pleaded -- in a boat,
but no plaything.
A man of many parts, he spent as much as possible of the spare time he
had as an employee learning the skills of seamanship. He has crewed on
the Banff-to-Stavanger yacht race and on the Clyde Cruising Club
Inverkip-to-Brittany event. And he has worked alongside fishermen and
lifeboatmen and coastguards in his home waters of the Firth of Forth.
Along with partner Peter Marr, who is 66 and has fished for 52 of them
-- not just off his own East coast, but on farther-off seas and oceans,
including the exotic West African coastline -- he has set a new course,
in business.
The pair have spent the past year preparing their MV Harold John, one
of a sturdy breed built by the Danes to fish the North Sea and the
Baltic in all weathers, to work Scotland's West Coast and the islands,
bays, inlets and sea-lochs as a charter vessel. Their prospective
clients will be divers, bird-watchers, historians, whale-watchers -- in
fact any special interest groups -- or groups of people who simply want
to relax and soak up the wondrous scenery.
The 61-ft Harold John is equipped with fast, inflatable tenders, which
can take guests where they wish for swimming parties, beach barbecues or
explorations of the myriad of uninhabited small islands.
Guest accommodation is in four generous-sized two-berth cabins, with
two reduced-rate traditional fishermen's berths for those happy to rough
it a little up for'ard with the crew. For day charters, the Harold John
is licensed to carry 12.
The guests can indulge in locally produced meat, game, and the fruits
of the sea. Suitable refreshments are prepared for them by a man who
always loved his grub and is well-used to catering for a mini-multitude.
Or, if they choose, they can self-cater.
Meals included, the cost is roughly #50 per head per night on board,
and of course, lower for self-caterers and those looking for only a
daytime cruise.
For divers, the company, Island Cruises (Scotland) has an on-board
Baeur compressor to fill air bottles at no extra cost. As well as her
modern electronic navigation aids, the Harold John has two sounders and
a colour plotter to track down wrecks and zoom in on exciting underwater
features which divers will delight in exploring.
The vessel will be operating from Oban from the beginning of May. Ian
and Peter will have a third crew-member to assist. And they have a
genuine sea-dog as mascot -- Ian's perky little Cairn terrier, Bobby.
With bookings starting to come in, Ian is keen to set off from
Cockenzie Old Harbour in East Lothian, where the final finishing touches
are being completed, and down the Caledonian Canal to Oban.
''When you've done nothing but spend money for a year, without
bringing anything in, you want to get moving,'' Ian says.
''It's been a horrendous experience at times, starting up a business
from scratch and using only your own cash. We've been through a
multiplicity of problems, particularly because of the exacting safety
standards that have to be satisfied when you are taking the public on
board.''
Ian made initial approaches for assistance and advice to local
enterprise bodies at home and in the venture's operating area but he and
Peter ended up carrying the financial burdens entirely on their own.
''East Lothian Enterprise were reasonably helpful but we got a very
negative response from Lochaber Ltd,'' he said.
He feels particularly sore at the lack of response from the Scottish
Tourist Board to a request for marketing and other advice. ''They did
not even have the courtesy to reply. Other Government agencies seemed
totally disinterested, so we just got on with it by ourselves.''
So Ian sets sail into new business waters at his and Peter Marr's own
expense. It's unlike his earlier existence, when the former wordsmith
worked as well on his expenses sheets as he did on his crime exclusives.
One particular accountant will remember the phrase: ''To hire of
passing yacht.''
Ian collected in the end after providing a fuller explanation. In the
best tradition of the popular newspaper journalist, he had been anxious
to get himself and a photographer as close as possible to a vessel
sailing into Edinburgh's Granton Harbour after an incident at sea in
which a shot was supposed to have been fired at another boat.
Leaving a posse of rivals to look out to sea, he negotiated a
relatively inexpensive deal with a local boat-owner and sailed out with
his colleague to get the exclusive picture.
Ian will regale his guests with further recollections as the sun sets
in the West -- at no extra expense.

Avenue, Haddington. EH41 3PG. By telephone -- 01620 823250.

THE impact of the newspaper cover price wars stands out starkly in the
first-quarter results from The Telegraph.
This along with higher print costs have cut operating profits from
#12.1m to #4.5m on turnover 11% lower at #61.3m against #68.8m.
Operating profits are therefore just over 7% of turnover compared with
17.5% last time.
At the pre-tax level including a #7.5m one-off from the sale of the
holding in Carlton Communications and income from associated companies
up from #5m to #5.9m, the figure is little changed at #16.2m.
The Daily and Sunday Telegraphs saw sales rise by 13% and 21%
respectively but there was a 40% slump in circulation revenue over the
same period last year as a result of lower cover prices.
Newspaper advertising revenue rose by 8% on the same period last year.
This was attributable to the strong performance of classified
advertising which rose 27% year-on-year. Display revenue remained at a
similar level to last year due to the poor performance of financial
advertising which has affected the whole industry.
The company said that the changes in circulation levels over the last
nine months, following the reduction in cover price, appear now to have
settled and sales of the Telegraph's titles are being well maintained
and, in the case of the Sunday Telegraph, increased. Overall advertising
revenues, in spite of a disappointing start in the financial area,
continue to show encouraging improvement.
In difficult circumstances, the Telegraph says it is thus able to
weather current trading conditions. Looking further ahead to the second
half of the year, operating performance will continue to depend on
further newsprint price inceases and on newspaper cover prices.
The paper takes the view that it is up to Rupert Murdoch to make the
first move to end the price war and there is no sign of this happening.
Meanwhile, owners of the 41% of the Telegraph shares not in the hands
of Conrad Black should shortly be receiving an offer from him to buy
them out. Yesterday the shares stood at 445p, down 4p.

THE food war is hotting up. This time it is not the ''Big Three''
supermarket chains against the limited range discounters such as Aldi
but Sainsbury battling it out with Tesco. Figures published yesterday
show that in some respects Sainsbury is losing the battle.
While J Sainsbury's pre-tax profits before exceptional and property
items rose by 10.5% to #808.2m, its market share fell in real terms.
Although market share in Sainsbury's supermarkets and Savacentre
hypermarkets together rose by 0.3% this was before taking into account
food price inflation which averaged 0.8% in the year.
Total group sales grew by 8.3% including a like-for-like increase,
excluding new stores, of 1.1%.
However, of more interest to shareholders, will be Sainsbury's stated
intention to run down its currently high dividend cover and provide
future divided increases as much as 3% above the growth in earnings per
share.
The dividend per share is raised by 10.4% to 11.7p after a final
shareholders' payment of 8.5p. It is covered 2.5 times by fully-diluted
earnings per share of 29.0p.
Tesco has lead the industry for several months following a series of
innovative marketing initiatives including its new national loyalty card
scheme called Clubcard. While Tesco may be the biggest in market share
terms, Sainsbury continues to have the best financial performance of any
UK food retailer.
Anyone can get market share, the knack is to make money out of it.
Sainsbury's chairman and chief executive David Sainsbury said that ''you
can always gain share by giving it away''. He added that in recent weeks
Sainsbury had won back some of its lost sales.
Sainsbury has probably allowed itself to become a little complacent
given its long period of market leadership. However, today's competitive
retail climate, particularly in food, leaves no room for complacency.
Sainsbury has been busy introducing new products and customer services
and is about to launch a marketing offensive to draw customer attention
to the attractiveness of its retail offer.
It continues to have an active product development programme. Last
year 1200 new own-brand lines were introduced, including premium
whiskies and dry cure bacon instead of the normal water-filled bacon.
For serious foodies, a special selection of over 350 specialist
cooking ingredients and gourmet foods from Britain and around the world
was introduced in a few shops last November and will be rolled out into
more stores this year. It includes oils, pastas, teas and sweetmeats
normally only found in specialist outlets or Harrods' Food Hall. This is
to be found alongside the new Cookshop range of high-quality cookware,
including utensils, bakeware, crockery and textiles.
Sainsbury has blazed a trail through existing markets which are
dominated by major proprietary brands. It already has its own Classic
Cola, Performers nappies, First Menu baby food and Novon detergent. Last
week saw the launch of Indiana Gold beer. This premium beer costs 15%
less than competitive major brands.
Having a smaller land bank that those of its competitors Sainsbury has
been placed at a disadvantage in the current stricter planning
environment. It plans to open 12 new supermarkets in the current year
compared with 20 last year. Taking into account six store closures, net
selling space rose by 511,000 square feet.
Unlike Tesco, Sainsbury has no plans to open city centre stores in any
great numbers because they are not as cost-effective as out-of-town
sites. Instead it plans to remodel existing stores and extend some to
include a wider product range. Where this has already ocurred, there has
been an encouraging uplift in sales and gross margins.
Fortunately for J Sainsbury, its retail subsidiaries are performing
well and have attractive growth potential. Savacentre, its hypermarket
chain offering its own-label clothing range alongside food, reported
6.5% growth in profit to #40.9m on 6% higher sales of #698m. Second-half
clothing sales were hit by the mild weather. The group has planning
consent for two Savacentre hypermarkets, at sites in Braehead, Glasgow
and Leeds.
The Homebase DIY business continues to be one of the best performers
in the market second only to Wickes. Its profits jumped by 36% helped by
good cost control and augurs well for the recently acquired Texas
Homecare business.
Talks with Ladbroke are continuing on a final price for the business
which is expected to be less than the #290m provisionally agreed. Fewer
than 60 Texas stores are to close with final details of the closure
programme to be released next week.
Sainsbury has decided to grow overseas in America rather than
Continental Europe where there are already major retailers, the markets
are saturated and there are strict planning regulations.
In North America, its Shaw's supermarket chain reported a 1.1 increase
in underlying sales. Better gross margins and lower costs enabled its
profits to rise by 34%. Giant Food, in which it has a 16% minority
stake, also turned in an encouraging performance and is busy expanding
its store portfolio.
City analysts were pleased with Sainsbury's improved profits and
recommended the shares. ''It's not too exciting in the short term but
long term it's a buy,'' said SGST's food analyst Philip Dorgan. ''Tesco
is trading well but Sainsbury is not trading badly,'' said BZW's David
McCarthy.
Sainsbury shares dipped 4p to 430p where they yield 3.4%.

THE other half of Scotland's exciting ''new firm'' of sprinters, Ian
Mackie, braved a bitterly cold evening to win the 100 metres in 10.6sec,
his fastest time of the season so far, in the annual match between the
Scottish Universities and two Scottish League teams last night at
Grangemouth Stadium.
Following Scottish relay team-mate Douglas Walker's impressive British
Universities 200m win at Meadowbank on Monday, the long-striding Mackie
won by eight metres, despite having been given only 20 minutes' notice
of the start time of his race.
On a miserable night marked more by the reluctance of the Scottish
League's first two divisions to support their team -- the League A team
-- victory went easily to the lower divisions' side over the Scottish
Universities.
James Beattie (Lochgelly) sliced half-a-second off his best 400m time
to win impressively in 48.3sec. and 17-year-old Bruce Robb (Pitreavie)
surprised himself with a personal best of 15.03m to win the senior shot.
Results:
100m -- I Mackie (SL A) 10.6sec; 200m -- G Welsh (SL A) 22.4; 400m --
J Beattie (SL B) 48.3; 800m -- D Begley (SL B) 1-57.8; 1500m -- W

Final match score -- 1, SL B (Divisions 3, 4, 5) 168pts; 2, Scottish

RAPIDLY expanding Dundee-based convenience stores and food
distribution group Watson &amp; Philip yesterday announced the purchase of
18 Scottish Presto and Galbraith stores from supermarket group Argyll
for #1.8m.
The news followed hard on the heels of Tuesday's announcement that
Presto was to close 27 stores, 18 of them in Scotland. However, although
the numbers coincide, these are not the stores Watson is taking over.
The Dundee company is acquiring outlets which can be easily converted
to its proven Alldays convenience trading format. Over the next five
weeks, the stores will be transferred from Argyll subsidiary Safeway
stores to Watson's Alldays stores, through which the acquisition was
made.
Under the sale agreement, all 150 people employed by Argyll in the
stores at present will transfer to Watson.
The Dundee company's convenience store chain has quadrupled in size
during the last two years. The latest acquisition takes the total number
of Alldays outlets to 410, of which 84 are in Scotland.
Watson hopes to increase its number of outlets north of the Border to
100 by the end of this year, through a series of smaller purchases.
Of the 18 new stores, three are in the Lothians, and one is in Fife.
The remainder are in the West.
With an average size of 2000 sq ft, they are relatively small stores
in the context of Argyll's operations. Up to nine of the new outlets
will be operated for Watson by franchisees.
Watson chief executive David Bremner said: ''These 18 stores trade in
locations ideally suited to convenience store retailing. They underline
our over-riding principle that quality locations are vital in building a
sustainable business.''
In addition to the #1.8m purchase price, Watson will pay for the stock
in the stores at the date of transfer.
Only last week, Watson added Alexander Clark, a small Glasgow-based
company, to its Foodservice catering supply division.
Watson reached the halfway point of its current financial year about
two weeks ago and, with results pending, the company is restricted in
what it can say about trading. However, good weather is likely to have
boosted results.
In February, Watson said it remained on course for a current year
profits boost of up to #1m from National Lottery ticket sales through
outlets in its Alldays stores.
For its previous financial year to October, Watson reported a 26%
increase in operating profits to #16m. Disregarding a #4.6m exceptional
charge relating to goodwill and a one-off disposal gain, underlying
pre-tax profits were up 21% at #14.2m.
Yesterday, shares in Watson added 2p to 389p.
The stores acquired by Watson are at: North Berwick; Armadale; Currie,
near Edinburgh; Cupar; Kilmacolm; Whitletts, Ayr; Beith; Gourock;
Greenock; Sanquhar; West Kilbride; Galston; Lenzie; Newton Mearns, near
Glasgow; Clarkston, Glasgow; Crow Road, Glasgow; Castlemilk, Glasgow,
and Neilston.

KINGUSSIE and Oban Camanachd, who meet on Saturday in this season's
Marine Harvest national league final at Inverness, have scooped the
sponsors' club-of-the-month awards for March and April.
The respective north and south first-division champions will be going
on to contest the two main prizes in the next four weeks.
Their first meeting is in the national league final, which Kingussie
have won 10 times since it was first played 13 years ago, including
eight in a row up to and including last season's victory over Oban.
Camanachd are bidding for their first grand slam and it is the fifth
time they have played in a national league final, but they have yet to
record a win. Club president Duncan MacIntyre said: ''We feel we have
come a long way since Kingussie defeated us last season. Our defence is
much more solid and we have greater strength in depth.
''Having been pushed so hard in our south league this year undoubtedly
helped, and I think that could count in our favour on Saturday.''
Oban could well be without Stephen Jamieson, who failed to last the
whole match against Newtonmore last Saturday. But Fraser Inglis will be
available after suspension and should slot into midfield, allowing his
brother Andrew to return to his regular defensive chores.
Kingussie will be without the suspended David Borthwick and he is
likely to be replaced in defence by Ian Borthwick. Manager Ian Ross
said: ''Too many people have written us off, saying that a few of our
team are over the hill. That has only served to make us work harder all
year. We could take nothing for granted this season, as the north
championship has been more competitive than it has been for years.
''We proved in the end that we were good enough to do it, and the fact
that we lost just one league game is a measure of our consistency.''
The fourth north national league place could be decided tomorrow, with
Glenurquhart needing a draw against Fort William to force a play-off
against Skye.

A GOOD night's rest did nothing to mellow American Mike Evans
yesterday as he spent his first full day in Scotland in preparation for
Saturday night's heavyweight showdown with Britain's Frank Bruno at the
Kelvin Hall.
The big fellow is courteous and amiable to the Press -- except when I
suggested that his boast in haing gone the distance with Michael Moorer,
Tony Tucker, and Tony Tubbs had to be put into perspective, because I
didn't consider any of them among the heaviest hitters in the sport --
but when it comes to discussing Bruno, he is positively mean.
He went as close as possible to making a declaration of war, which
should make today's head-to-head between the two fighters very
interesting.
''I don't fear anybody, and that includes Bruno,'' he said. ''I rate
him highly, but I would rate him even higher if he fought more top-class
opponents more often. In the States all the top guys fight each other --
you have to bump off all the leading contenders to get a shot at the
world title.''
That was a swipe at the fact that Bruno, after just two easy fights in
the past year, is being lined up for a world-title challenge against
Oliver McCall in the summer.
Evans would just love to wreck that dream. He also reassured the fans
that he would not be cheating them, saying he resented the fact that
some people were claiming he had come to Britain to fall over for Bruno.
''Anyone who really knows me will tell you different,'' he said.
''I'm ready and willing to put up a war on Saturday. It will be like
two trains colliding and anything can happen. When I retire, I want to
say I fought the best. I'll be able to say I won some and I lost some,
but I fought. And if I lose on Saturday, it won't be because I fell
over. I'll get more glory for being knocked down than for falling
down.''
Lennox Lewis is another British heavyweight who will be chasing a
world-title shot this weekend when he takes part in a final eliminator
against American Lionel Butler at the Arco Arena in California. It will
be his first contest under new trainer Emanuel Steward.

BENSON AND HEDGES INTERNATIONAL OPEN
HE Benson and Hedges International Open which starts today over its
headquarters course at St Mellion, is not only the first of this year's
PGA European Tour events to pitch its tent on mainland Britain. It is,
in effect, the beginning of the season for almost all of the leading
professionals.
Whereas Sam Torrance is competing in his tenth tournament out of a
possible 14, this will be Jose Maria Olazabal's second, the third for
Severiano Ballesteros and Bernhard Langer, and the fourth for Colin
Montgomerie. Ian Woosnam, who has played once, and Nick Faldo, not at
all, have absented themselves from the felicity of a #650,000 prize
fund.
Little wonder that while the main players have been away, mainly in
America, their place at centre stage has been usurped by lesser lights,
to the extent that there have been six European first-time winners
already. Unless the signs mean more than they appear to do, however, the
high ground is about to be regained by a spring offensive.
Over the next five weeks total prize-money will amount to more than
#3.4m, a figure less than #1m behind the aggregate dispersed so far. The
significance of that statistic is that open season now seriously begins
on the accumulation of Ryder Cup team points -- wherein lies a distinct
difference of view.
Not one of the players mentioned does not want again to be in the side
to meet the United States in September and they look genuinely baffled
that anyone should think otherwise. Yet a body of players of the middle
rank now seem positively anxious to distance themselves from this major
occasion. Exression to that approach was given recently by Phillip
Walton, who won the Irish Professional championship at the weekend. He
spoke not only of the pressures of playing in the match but also of
trying to make the team. ''I've seen players with their eyes in the back
of their heads with worry,'' he said. ''They'd have to pay me very big
money to play.''
Considering that no money is ever paid for taking part, that attitude
indicates Walton wants no part of the contest. Montgomerie definitely
does want to be part of it ''just as I wanted to be part of the Walker
Cup match as an amateur.'' Ballesteros and Torrance echoed that view.
Ballesteros said: ''The match is not over-hyped. I would always want to
be on the team and also be sure to reach the week in good form.''
Torrance added: ''Since Europe began to make a match of it the pressures
are greater, but the consoling factor is that the fellow you are playing
against is feeling them just as badly.''
As for the immediate objective, winning the first prize of #108,330,
Montgomerie is optimistic. He has twice finished in the first 10 and the
fact that 12 of the 14 driving holes require a faded shot -- the
trademark preference of their architect, Jack Nicklaus -- makes the
7054-yard course an attractive challenge to Montgomerie.
True, Montgomerie has only once completed 72 holes since the US
Masters but he may be in a more settled frame of mind than Ballesteros
who, having recently changed his manager and his caddie (now working
with Gordon Brand Jr), does ''not feel comfortable with my swing.'' The
Spaniard's mood was of a man facing a mid-life crisis somewhat ahead of
time.
Still, 12 months ago Ballesteros's morale was equally low before he
ended a two-year victory drought by beating Faldo by three strokes --
his first success in the tournament, which this year celebrates its
twenty-fifth anniversary, 20 years after he first played in it at
Fulford. He then earned #186 for thirty-fourth place compared with
#108,114 for first.
Torrance, joint fifth last year, was still warm in the glow of his
Italian Open victory, but non-committal about repeating so quickly. ''My
whole game was better in Milan,'' he explained, ''but I'm not usually
good two tournaments running. I wish I knew the secret, then I'd play
like that every week.''
Olazabal, who won in 1990 when the tournament transferred from
Yorkshire to Cornwall and will probably warm up for the Open
Championship by playing in the Scottish Open at Carnoustie, partnered
three members of the Walker Cup squad in yesterday's pro-am -- Stephen
Gallacher, Gordon Sherry, and the Welsh Champion, Craig Evans.
The Spaniard was particularly complimentary, on first acquaintance
with the Scots, two of 15 in the 150-strong field. ''They have good,
solid swings,'' he said, ''and when Gordon hits his best drive he is 40
yards past me.'' Tiger Woods, the US Amateur champion with whom he
played in the Masters is ''longer still, but their iron play and putting
are at the same level.''

PETE Sampras was forced to sweat on his return to action after injury
while fellow American Andre Agassi enjoyed an easy day's work in the
second round of the German Open in Hamburg yesterday.
World No.2 Sampras, back on court for the first time since he was
forced to retire from last month's Monte Carlo Open with an ankle
injury, had to fight to find a way past Spanish clay-court specialist
Carlos Costa in a 6-3, 7-5 victory.
But world No.1 Agassi, by contrast, cruised to a 6-2, 7-6 win over
German Marc Goellner in just 74 minutes in a one-sided match played in
some of the coldest conditions on the ATP Tour.
Sampras and Costa shared dramatic long rallies in their entertaining
clash. The American needed luck to gain a crucial service break to lead
5-3 in the first set when a Costa volley at the net hit the cord and
bounced back on the Spaniard's side.
The American had to produce two big serves to save break-points in the
next game before serving out for the first set after 43 minutes and
going on to take the second 7-5 after a battle in the sunshine.
Agassi, however, was rarely tested by Goellner in their earlier match
played in overcast conditions. He broke the German's serve in the first
and third games to race into a 3-0 lead as the German struggled with his
forehand, and Agassi never looked backed.
* FORMER world No.1 Tracy Austin will team up with Britain's John
Lloyd in the Tennis Legends Tournament to be held alongside the Women's
World Doubles Championship at Craiglockhart Tennis Centre later this
month.
The American, still only 32, played her first overseas tournament in
Edinburgh in 1977 and is looking forward to returning to the city.
She and Lloyd will meet Lloyd's former mixed doubles partner Wendy
Turnbull -- the pairing twice won the Wimbledon title -- as well as
Britain's Roger Taylor in the opening Legends match on Wednesday, May
24.
Other big names of the past in the Legends event include former
Wimbledon singles champions Virginia Wade and Australian Roy Emerson.

UNITED Biscuits, the McVitie's biscuits and KP crisps and snacks
group, has had little to be cheerful about in recent years despite
frequently expressing its confidence in the future. As one part of the
business improved another would run into difficulty.
A forecast from chairman Sir Robert Clarke at the annual general
meeting yesterday that pre-tax profits in the first half will be
''significantly below'' the 1994 figure seems par for the course and
sliced 16p off the share price to 330p.
It should perhaps not come as too much of a surprise given the warning
noises on tough trading conditions made at the time of the full-year
figures in March.
Although he told shareholders attending the meeting that the
first-half outlook should not be indicative of prospects for the full
year as a significant year-on-year improvement is expected in the second
half, market sceptics will want to see the hard evidence of this first.

BYRON NELSON CLASSIC
NICK Faldo has no great expectations as he returns from a three-week
break to play the Byron Nelson Classic starting in Dallas, Texas, today.
''It would be nice to have a good week but basically I just want to get
back into it,'' said Faldo, who joins an impressive 156-man field.
Faldo spent the first 14 weeks of the year in the US, winning the
Doral Open in March, before finally returning home to England after last
month's Heritage Classic.
He spent the first week at home with ''the kids'', the second week in
''physical training'' and the third week at St Andrews working on an
instructional video. ''I did a bit of fishing, a bit of practice, a bit
of everything really,'' he said.
Faldo was reluctant to criticise publicly the American lifestyle, but
he admitted that after more than three months in the USA, it had been a
joy to go home. ''I don't want to get into hot water, but we're worlds
apart,'' he said of the two countries. ''I missed the scenery of
Britain. Everything over here is a four-lane freeway and the news has a
commerical break every two sentences.''
Faldo is back in the USA for the Byron Nelson Classic and next week's
Westchester Classic in New York, before returning for the British PGA
Championship at Wentworth starting on May 26.
Also returning to action after a three-week holiday is US Open
champion Ernie Els, who arrived here on Monday after relaxing at his
South African beach home.
''I never took time off in December and I was pretty busy through to
the Masters,'' Els said. ''I needed three weeks off. I wanted to get
away from golf. I feel more relaxed now.''
Faldo is joined in the field by fellow Europeans David Feherty, Jesper
Parnevik, and Stephen Keppler. Englishman Keppler, a club pro who has
lived in Atlanta for a decade, finished a surprising third at last
week's Atlanta Classic.
* BEN Hogan, a golf great in the 1940s and 1950s, is said to be
recovering well from emergency colon surgery. Hogan, 82, was in fair and
stable condition at the intensive care unit of All Saints Hospital in
Fort Worth, a hospital official said.
Dr Peter Rutledge removed a tumour on Monday from the golfer's colon
during a six-hour surgery, said Valerie Hogan, his wife of more than 50
years. ''The doctors all say he's doing remarkably well,'' she said.
''They removed all of the tumor and said he'll be fine. It's just going
to take a few weeks to get his strength back.''
Hogan rebounded from a 1949 car accident to finish with 63 victories
in US PGA Tour events in a career that spanned more than three decades.
On February 2, 1949, as he and his wife were returning from a
tournament in Phoenix, Arizona, his car was struck by a bus near El
Paso, Texas. The collision fractured his left collarbone, left ankle,
pelvis, and several ribs. Doctors said he might not walk again.
Hogan not only walked, but resumed tournament golf and won the US Open
in 1950, the US Open and Masters in 1951, and the US Open, Masters, and
British Open in 1953. The remarkable comeback was featured in the movie
''Follow the Sun,'' with Glenn Ford portraying Hogan.
A statue of Hogan is to be unveiled during a ceremony on May 23 at
Fort Worth's Colonial Country Club. That is the day of the opening round
of the Colonial National Invitation Tournament, which he won five times.

DARING to be different, Bruce Brage is opening a new golf course on
his Dakota County family farm that will feature llama caddies.
Brage, 37, figures using llamas to carry golf bags is just different
enough to convince some golfers to give his new course a try. Elmdale
Hills Golf Course, just south of Miesville in the southeastern corner of
Minnesota, is expected to open in July.
The Brage family has been working for about a year picking rocks,
cutting trees, and putting down sod on what used to be farm pasture.
Brage, who studied farm management in college, admits transforming
part of his farm into a golf course is a risky and expensive venture. He
expects to lose money in the first year but turn a profit after that.
There are about 100 golf courses in the Twin Cities metropolitan area.
Brage is hoping the remote, peaceful setting of his course will attract
golfers.
Then there are the llama caddies. Warren Rebholz of the Minnesota Golf
Association said he knows of no other course in Minnesota or the
surrounding states that has llamas to carry golf bags.

IVORY &amp; Sime's UK Smaller Companies Trust suffered minimal losses in
net asset value during the year to March 31 and kept its full dividend
unchanged at 2.8p.
The trust's portfolio survived stock market jitters over political
uncertainty and higher interest rates relatively unscathed.
Its 3.6% slide in net asset value to 108.57p per share was well short
of the 10.2% fall registered by its benchmark FTSE Small Cap (ex
Investment Trusts) Index.
According to the specialist magazine Money Management, Ivory &amp; Sime's
UK Smaller Companies Trust was the leader in its sector, outperforming
more than 30 other UK trusts specialising in small companies last year.
Ivory &amp; Sime's business development manager Gordon Neilly said the
trust had recovered all last year's losses as a result of a stock market
rally in April. ''We have currently recovered every thing we lost during
the previous year,'' he said.
Earnings per share increased to 3.10p from 2.67p during the year to
March, reflecting growth in underlying company dividends as well as the
effect of income being recognised on an ex-dividend basis.
The trust declared a final dividend of 1.8p per share making a total
of 2.8p for the year, unchanged from 1994.
Trust chairman Michael Walker said the overall outlook remained
positive, despite continuing stock market concerns over interest rates
and the political situation.
The trust was geared up from zero to 25% of shareholders' funds with a
#6m five-year loan at a fixed rate of 9.22% in August last year. This
gave it total assets of #29.4m at the end of March.
''We believe that over the longer term smaller companies are going to
do well and we can enhance shareholders' funds, especially since we had
the opportunity to borrow at a good rate,'' Mr Neilly said, justifying
the move.

<HEADLINE>Terms disappoint market. Swiss Bank bid values Warburg group at #860m</HEADLINE>

SG WARBURG has agreed terms from Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) which
values the merchant banking group at #860m, excluding the 75% owned fund
management side, Mercury Asset Management.
The terms are a little above expectations but disappointed the market,
where Warburg shares tumbled 27p to 810p.
The complex deal involves a cash distribution to Warburg shareholders
plus the demerger of MAM to them. It will result in shareholders
receiving at least 365p cash plus 0.538 MAM shares for each Warburg
held, equivalent to 850p when the deal was struck after a week of hectic
talks. But with MAM down 19p at 882p, it was worth 840p when markets
closed. Completion is expected in July.
Warburg has been in a vulnerable position since the failure of the
Morgan Stanley approach and SBC's bid rates Warburg's investment banking
business at a modest 7.5% above asset value.
So there is a possibility of a counter bid, particularly as Warburg
has had talks with a number of other potential bidders. There have been
recent reports that the American Smith Barney group was interested in
buying the business.
Sir David Scholey, Warburg chairman and chief executive, has pinned
his colours firmly to the SBC mast and said that he did not expect a
counter-bid. The investment banking business will be merged with SBC's
equivalent operation under the name SBC Warburg. Sir David will be
chairman, with SBC's international supremo Marcel Ospel chief executive.
MAM directors said they had great confidence in MAM's future as an
independent company, though analysts consider it is a possible bid
target, with National Westminster Bank cited as a potential buyer. MAM
is capitalised at #1600m.
Both Warburg and SBC maintain they are a good fit, going together
''like the clunk of a Roll-Royce door,'' according to Sir David. Warburg
is strong in mergers and acquisitions, equity research and corporate
finance and it has a wide international client base. SBC has established
a leading position in derivatives, fixed income and foreign exchange.
The merger will still leave SBC as a relatively small investment
banking player beside the powerful American groups but its resources
will provide the capital backing which Warburg's needs to develop the
strong cards it has.
SBC would not be drawn on staffing implications, saying the situation
would have to be assessed. But some cuts in Warburg's 4500 workforce are
widely expected, though these might well have happened in any case given
a need to reduce overheads.
SBC is keen to retain key staff and incentive arrangements will be put
in place to try a prevent a haemorrhage of top people. There have
already been some defections to Morgan Grenfell.
Sir David refuted reports of discontent among employees, saying that
they were ''positive'' towards the merger.
That Warburg is going through a difficult time is shown in its results
for the year to March, released yesterday, showing losses on investment
banking of #16.9m against profits of #205m, though MAM improved profits
by #2m to #111.5m. The loss-making bond operations were closed and
corporate finance activities reorganised.
Sir David said the Asian equity interests performed particularly
strongly. MAM continued to attract new business, having raised its funds
under management by 50% in three years.

CAIRN Energy has announced plans to sell off a further 10% stake in
its US subsidiary for nearly #9.8m to help fund its purchase of a Dutch
gas exploration and production firm and expand its activities in
Bangladesh.
The Edinburgh-based oil and gas company once owned 100% of Cairn
Energy USA Inc (CEUSA) but has reduced its holding progressively since
1992.
The latest sale will reduce Cairn's stake in CEUSA, which produces oil
and gas in the Gulf of Mexico, the Texas panhandle and the Appalachian
region, from 15.5% to 5.4%. Cairn said it would seek authority from its
shareholders soon to sell off this residual stake as well.
Cairn chief executive Bill Gammell said the proceeds of the latest
CEUSA sale would help pay for Cairn's #17m purchase of the Dutch firm
Holland Sea Search Holdings (HSSH) and the run down of HSSH's #11m debt.
The money would also help fund gas exploration and development in
Bangladesh, where Cairn is operating in partnership with HSSH, he added.
''The development of Bangladesh is going to be a very key part of our
strategy,'' Mr Gammell said.
Earlier this week, Cairn announced plans to build and operate a
gas-fuelled power station in Bangladesh in a joint venture with Midlands
Electricity, the English regional electricity company.

COSTA AZUL OPEN:
SCOTLAND'S Kathryn Marshall, a reserve for Europe's last Solheim Cup
side, launches her bid for a place in next year's match in the Costa
Azul Open, the American Express Tour's first tournament of the season
which begins in Portugal today.
A field of 106 will be divided over both the Troia and Montado courses
on the first two days with the final round of the 54 holes event being
played at Montado on Saturday.
This is the first counting event for Solheim Cup points for the match
next year at St Pierre.
Marshall, not eligible to play in the LPGA Championship this week,
their second major of the season, has also entered next week's Ford
Classic.
Since finishing third in the British Open in 1993, Marshall has
concentrated her efforts in America but a Solheim Cup place is high
among her prorities.
A change of rules regarding qualification for an order of merit
ranking also poses problems.
It is now necessary to play in six events rather than four to be
ranked on the final merit table.
Europeans such as Marshall who are international members are committed
to playing 15 tournaments on the LPGA Tour.
Already the International Management Group's Stockholm office have
confirmed that Lotta Neumann, Helen Alfredsson, and Annika Sorenstam,
who also have commitments in Japan, will not be playing in six European
events this year.
This happened last year when Neumann played in four events, won three
of them with a tour record of #102,750 prize-money and topped the order
of merit.
A similar performance this year could again make the Swede the leading
money-winner, but under the new ruling she would not qualify for the
merit title.
It could also take some explaining to spectators at St Pierre the
reasons why Neumann, Alfredsson, and Sorenstam, three of the leading
professionals on the women's golf scene, are in the European Solheim Cup
side yet do not appear on the Ford order of merit table.
One person who will be at St Pierre is Sweden's Pia Nilsson, who has
been named Mickey Walker's vice-captain for the match.

SCOTTISH Value Trust, which mainly invests in other UK trusts,
weathered a difficult winter better than its benchmark index and
recouped during April its net asset losses of the previous six months.
The net asset value per share fell 4.5% to 104.31p during the six
months to March 31, slightly less than the 5.3% decline of the FTSE
Actuaries Investment Trust Index over the same period.
But Edinburgh-based Scottish Value Management said the net asset value
per share recovered 5.1% in April to 109.63p at the end of the month.
The trust manager declared an interim dividend of 1p, unchanged from
last year, and said that barring unforeseen circumstances, it would pay
a similar final dividend.
The six months to March marked ''a turning point for the UK stock
market and the investment trust sector,'' Scottish Value said.
''The nervous sentiment which dominated the stock market during much
of 1994 gradually gave way to a recognition of underlying value,'' it
added.
Colin McLean, managing director of Scottish Value Management, said the
trust benefitted from the excellent performance of Aberdeen Trust, which
accounts for 20% of its entire portfolio.
It also received a boost from Worth Investment Trust, which was
transformed into a cable television operator, Caledonia Media
Communications, in January.
''Quite a number of underlying investments have moved ahead quite
strongly. I think there are signs of things improving,'' Mr McLean said.
He said Scottish Value Trust had increased its gearing to 10% from
about 5% a year earlier and this accounted for a trebling of interest
charges to #452,000.
Although the trust mainly invests in the UK, about 10% of its #52.5m
of net assets were held abroad at the end of March, mainly in France and
Chile.

<HEADLINE>Kirin Cup a lengthy expedition for little return.  Scotland send shadows to Land of the Rising Sun</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>JAMES TRAYNOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THERE was really only one question to be asked after the Scottish
squad for the Kirin Cup competition in Japan was announced yesterday:
Why?
The squad contains only a single player from Rangers or Celtic, Gary
McAllister isn't in it either, and the player who has become Scotland's
recognised striker in recent matches, John McGinlay, also is missing
while Duncan Shearer will be another absentee if Aberdeen are involved
in a play-off for their premier-division place.
So why is a shadow squad of would-be internationalists being dragged
across the globe to play against Japan in Hiroshima's Big Arch Stadium
(May 21) and Ecuador in the first international match to be held in the
Toyama Prefectual Sports Park Stadium (May 24)?
Obviously, given the competitors, the Kirin Cup is hardly a
prestigious happening and that was always the case even when the SFA
accepted their invitation some months ago.
At the time the association and Craig Brown, who was lecturing at a
European coaches conference in Slovakia when the squad was announced by
his assistant manager, Alex Miller, felt it was important to keep the
players who will be required for the European Championship qualifying
match against the Faroe Islands in June sharp.
Travelling to Japan seemed like the solution, but the majority of the
players who will line up in the Faroes are not going to Japan.
Of the 13-strong first-choice group -- a back-up group of seven from
which five will be selected after Saturday also was listed -- only four
players could be regarded as certain starters in the European
Championship tie. Colin Calderwood, Colin Hendry, Jim Leighton, and Alan
McLaren have become key players for Scotland in recent times, but the
others listed alongside them are no more than hopefuls.
Also, all of them have still to negotiate the final league games of
their seasons safely and if history has taught us anything it is that
Scotland squads are usually depleted by injury. If a few players are
hurt on Saturday the group which eventually sets of next Wednesday could
be seriously devoid of genuine internationalists and that would do our
credibility no good at all.
A fair proportion of the players who will be called in for the Faroe
Islands task will come from Celtic, who will not stop working after
Saturday because they must remain in a state of readiness for the
Tennents Scottish Cup final against Airdrie, and Aberdeen and Dundee
United, who may also have to put in some overtime in the play-off for a
premier division place.
McLaren apart, the Rangers players who could be considered for
international duty are unavailable for the Japan trip because of injury
while the same applies to the team captain, Gary McAllister, who will
have an operaton when Leeds United stop playing this weekend.
It seems an awful long way to travel merely to keep a handful of
players, who can be certain of recalls for the real thing in June,
ticking over and the SFA ought to have reconsidered their invitation.
All they are doing is helping Japan, who are bidding for the 2002 World
Cup finals, and at the same time risking Scottish stock abroad.
Miller was adamant that because so many of the players have points to
prove the squad will do well and that there may be one or two of the
group who will emerge and challenge strongly for inclusion in the
future. ''You might say we could have played closer to home, but this is
a good opportunity for these players,'' the Hibs manager said.
''After all, who had heard of Colin Calderwood up until a couple of
international matches ago and he plays like someone who always has been
with us.''
Oldham's Paul Bernard, Craig Burley, of Chelsea, and Nottingham
Forest's Scot Gemmill will be used by Brown and Miller in Japan because
this trio have always been in the manager's mind since the days when
they played for him in the under-21s. Squad:
Paul Bernard (Oldham), Craig Burley (Chelsea), Colin Calderwood
(Tottenham), Scot Gemmill (Nottingham Forest), Colin Hendry (Blackburn),
Darren Jackson (Hibernian), Jim Leighton (Hibernian), Rob McKinnon
(Motherwell), Alan McLaren (Rangers), Brian Martin (Motherwell), John
Spencer (Chelsea), Nicky Walker (Partick Thistle), Stephen Woods
(Motherwell).
A further group will be added next week from the following: Stephen
Crawford (Raith Rovers), Paul Lambert (Motherwell), Craig Levein
(Hearts), Stewart McKimmie (Aberdeen), William McKinlay (Dundee United),
John Robertson (Hearts), Duncan Shearer (Aberdeen).

GLASGOW'S John Greaves scooped the #1000 first prize in the Highland
Steel Assistants' Tournament at Inverness yesterday following a
final-round tussle with Scottish Assistants' champion Scott Henderson,
of Kings Links.
The pair had started the final round of the 54-hole event level on
four-under-par, yet Henderson had soon relinquished the lead to Greaves
after covering the first four holes in four-over-par.
Both birdied the fifth and sixth, but Henderson had left himself too
much to do, and even birdies at the final two holes left him with a
one-over-par final round and two strokes adrift. Leading scores:
202 -- J Greaves (Glasgow) 69, 65, 68.
204 -- S Henderson (Kings Links) 67, 67, 70.
207 -- A Tait (Cawder) 71, 68, 68.
209 -- P Wardell (Longniddry) 68, 73, 68.
210 -- N McGill (King James VI) 70, 73, 67; D Herd (Alloa) 71, 69, 70.
211 -- E McIntosh (Braid Hills) 68, 72, 71.
213 -- J Wither (Paisley) 69, 77, 67; D Nicoll (Letham Grange) 68, 71,
74.
* WINDYHILL'S Gary Collinson posted a four-under-par 68 in the
Water-Aid Pro-Am at Haggs Castle yesterday to win by a shot from
Downfield professional Andrew Crerar. Leading scores:
68 -- G Collinson (Windyhill).
69 -- A Crerar (Downfield).
71 -- B Marchbank (Gleneagles); R Arnott (Caddyshack).
72 -- C Elliott (Dubai Creek); G Harvey (Grangemouth).
73 -- M Brennan (Campsie); G Weir (Braid Hills); S Stephen (Braid
Hills); R Weir (Cowal); B Lockie (Kilmarnock Barassie).
* JANICE Gardner and Ruth Rankin tied on 78 yesterday in the scratch
section of the Lanarkshire Ladies Foursomes at Crow Wood. Leading
scores:
SCRATCH
78 -- J Gardner (Drumpellier), R Rankin (Lanark). 85 -- E McCormack
(Cawder) and R McLay (Cawder). 86 -- I Kempsell (Cambuslang) and A
Burden (Cambuslang).
HANDICAP
76 -- M Allan (Bothwell Castle) and H Carlton (Bothwell Castle, 14).
77 -- A McGregor (Bothwell Castle) and J Wiles (Bothwell Castle, 13).
77[1/2] -- A Tannock (Callander) and M Anderson (Cathkin Braes,

GRAHAM Gooch yesterday voiced his concern about the ''foreigners'' he
fears are waltzing into English cricket under a flag of convenience.
And as the debate hots up -- stoked by Andrew Symonds' controversial
arrival at Gloucestershire -- Gooch said: ''I just wonder how these
players feel deep down.''
England's selectors have raised eyebrows -- and, in some cases hackles
-- around the world by picking Andy Caddick, Martin McCague, and Craig
White in recent years.
Caddick, born in Christchurch, could have played for New Zealand while
the other two learned much of their cricket in Australia and were dual
qualified.
''You cannot deny people their birthright,'' said Gooch, England's
most successful batsman of all time.
''And I have no problem with people who have qualified like Allan
Lamb, Robin Smith and Graeme Hick.''
''But where I do have a problem is with people who come in just to
play cricket for England and don't want to spend the rest of their lives
here. Just to swan in and play cricket and then swan out again is not
right to me.''
Gooch, who retired from the international arena at the end of last
winter's Ashes series has touched upon the ''foreigners'' issue in his
autobiography.
At yesterday's launch party in London, the 41-year-old Essex opener
was careful not to condemn the likes of Caddick, McCague, and White.
''Under present rules they qualify, but it is a concern,'' he said.
''Everyone goes on to the field and tries their hardest. But what do you
draw on when times are tough?
''I've played my career proud to be English. When they played the
National Anthem during the last World Cup, it was the best thing that
could have happened for me.
''I just wonder what players coming in from outside England feel deep
down about things like that.''
As for Symonds, the 19-year-old Birmingham-born Aussie currently
appearing for Gloucestershire as an England-qualified player, Gooch is
clear in his contempt for the rules.
''I've nothing personal against the lad, but I have no respect for his
standpoint.''
Symonds, like all other qualified players, has signed a declaration
saying he will be available for England this summer if selected.
Yet, after having scored a century for Queensland against Mike
Atherton's team last winter, the teenager agreed he was a ''fair dinkum
Aussie'' whose greatest ambition was to wear the baggy green cap.
And asked by a journalist a week or so ago whether he would play for
England this summer, if picked, Symonds replied: ''No comment.''

OUTPUT in the production and construction industries in Scotland fell
by 0.3% in the last quarter of 1994, it was shown by provisional
estimates released yesterday by the Scottish Office industry department.
The manufacturing index in Scotland fell by 0.5% in the same period,
the department's economic and statistics unit said.
Within the Scottish manufacturing sector in 1994, the largest decrease
in output was in mechanical engineering, with an 11% fall.
Over the whole of 1994, the production and construction index rose by
2.3% and the manufacturing sector showed an increase of 5.6%.
The estimates revealed that manufacturing output in Scotland in 1994
was 5.6% higher compared with a 4.1% rise in the UK as a whole.
The manufacturing industry with the largest increase in output in 1994
was electrical and instrument engineering which showed a 24% rise.

JIMMY River will be Kevin Anderson's only mount at the Border
Point-to-Point at Corbridge on Saturday but the Dumfriesshire rider is
so far ahead of his nearest rivals that he can afford to relax.
Anderson had his second treble of the season at the Lauderdale meeting
last weekend, although he did collect a #40 fine for improper use of the
whip in getting Howayman home by half-a-length to beat Little Greyside
in the restricted.
Howayman, owned by Dennis Waggott, recorded the best time over the
Mosshouses course, and was winning for the third time this season.
Anderson won the confined on Miss Enrico, also completing a
three-timer, and the open on Jimmy River, despite doubts about the old
boy being able to cope with the good to firm ground.
Although Jimmy River is returning to his old form, owner Graham
Winstanley would be the first to admit he did not have much to beat in a
reduced field of five.
The 12-year-old, who has won 16 point-to-points and hunter chases,
will face a much stiffer task at Corbridge against some tough
Northumbrian opposition.
Anderson, the five-times Northern area champion, has ridden 14 winners
so far, three less than last year's total, with two meetings to come.
In the current championship he has 71 points, a lead of 17 over Andrew
Parker, who missed the Lauderdale meeting. Most of Parker's best horses
are finished for the season so he will have to do something dramatic
over the next 10 days if he is to overtake Anderson.
On Saturday he has only two booked rides, but he may pick up some more
on the day.
* JUMP jockey Steve Slade was described as ''fairly comfortable''
yesterday in Plymouth's Derriford Hospital where he was detained
overnight after a fall on Tuesday.
The amateur rider was flown to the hospital by air ambulance after a
fall at Newton Abbot. Slade was said not to have any serious injuries by
a hospital spokesman.

MARK Davis, of Essex, is a doubtful starter at St Mellion today --

Davis is nursing a swollen and grazed right arm after crashing into a
tree and fence on Monday and said: ''I don't know if I'll be able to
play. I've been getting treatment, but it still feels sore.
''I was lucky. I was going at quite a speed when the throttle stuck
and I couldn't avoid the tree.''
This is the twenty-fifth Benson and Hedges International, and to mark
the occasion a special prize is on offer to anyone achieving a 2 at the
472-yard par-4 eighteenth -- a 1971 MGB car worth #15,000.

THE Scottish end of the Bank of Scotland's UK cash-flow finance
specialist, Kellock, led the subsidiary's profits advance in the 14
months to end-February.
During the extended accounting period, which brings Kellock's year-end
into line with its parent company, Kellock made pre-tax profits of
#3.95m. Glasgow-based director Peter Burr said: ''It is encouraging to
see profitable growth for Kellock as a whole and particularly satisfying
that, for the second year in a row, Scotland is leading the business.''
Kellock helps clients' cash flow by ''buying'' their sales debtors for
cash, providing working capital to fund day-to-day activities and future
growth.

ALISON Sheppard, who has competed at two Olympic Games, is the latest
defector from the City of Glasgow swimming club. The 21-year-old
departed this week to rejoin coach Alex McNeil at Milngavie and
Bearsden.
Sheppard's switch co-incides with Fraser Walker's move south to join
Warrington Warriors, and is a major disappointment for the Glasgow
scheme run by coach Dave Bance that was intended to provide the
facilities and financial assistance to enable our top-class swimmers to
train on a full-time basis.
However, after just seven months as a full-time athlete, Sheppard is
job-hunting, and back at the club where she launched her career at the
age of eight.
''My training wasn't going too well, and my times at last month's
European Championship trials were disappointing,'' she revealed. ''I
wasn't going any faster than at the same time last season when I was
only training part-time.
''I'm still going to continue swimming, and next year's Olympics are
still the target. But I'm pleased to be back at Milngavie.''
Her next major event will be the Scottish Championships at Edinburgh's
Commonwealth Pool next month, a meet that is vital for selection for the
Scottish team to compete in the Canadian National Championships in
Calgary in August.
Meanwhile, Euan Stewart, another senior internationalist who joined
the City of Glasgow this season, is currently resting, and contemplating
retirement.
The 25-year-old, who competed in last summer's Commonwealth Games,
pulled out of the European trials due to lack of form, and is unlikely
to continue his quest for an Olympic debut.

PAUL Gascoigne seems destined to attach his footballing future to
Rangers -- despite the fact that Aston Villa have made a late bid to get
the volatile midfielder to move from the Italian Serie A and join them
in the English Premiership next season.
Rangers and the club from Rome have already agreed a fee of #4.5m for
the player, and the view of Lazio coach Zdenek Zeman is that Gascoigne
will plump for Glasgow. ''The only problem I can foresee could be the
negotiations between the players' agent and Rangers over money,'' he
said. ''I believe that Gascoigne will go to Rangers.''
Villa chairman Doug Ellis and secretary Steven Stride are understood
to have flown to Rome yesterday.
0
Leeds, Coventry and QPR are other Premiership sides to have declared
an interest in the player, but Rangers have been one step ahead of them
all the way.
Villa, however, are ready to make a final effort, having failed to
sign Nottingham Forest's Stan Collymore and Inter Milan's Dennis
Bergkamp before deadline day.
Manager Brian Little would make no comment as he prepared for the
final match of the season at Norwich with Villa needing a point to be
safe.
The signing of a player such as Gascoigne would appease Villa fans who
have voiced their disapproval of Ellis, and who have still not forgiven
him for sacking Ron Atkinson as manager in November.
It is almost certain, however, that with Rangers almost home and dry
in this particular race, the Midlands club will have to turn their
attentions elsewhere.
Meanwhile, Derek Whyte, the former Celtic defender, has signed a
two-year contract with Middlesbrough. ''Negotiations went well,'' said
the player, ''and I'm delighted to pledge my future to the club.''

<TEXT>
FORMER Dons manager Willie Miller has lodged a claim for unfair
dismissal against the club. Miller, who was sacked earlier this year
after 26 years as player and manager, said he had made the claim because
club directors refused to meet him.
''I have made a couple of approaches to the club over the past few
month, but each time I have not been accommodated,'' he said. ''It is
the last thing I want to do after being with the club for 26 years. I
would have thought the directors would have wanted to sit down with me
and sort it out.
''I would instruct my lawyers to withdraw the application even now if
I could get a meeting with the directors,'' he added.
Aberdeen director Gordon Buchan rejected Miller's claim that the board
had refused to meet with him. ''The lodging of the claim merely
preserves his position because of the time limit. It would be entirely
wrong to read into that some form of breakdown in negotiation,'' he
said.
''There is no reluctance to meet with him at all, but we have to
establish the basis of why we are meeting.''
Meanwhile, Roy Aitken, the Aberdeen acting manager, yesterday hailed
the ''extra man'' who has made such a difference to his club's survival
fight. Not since the heady days of Gothenburg has the Red Army rallied
behind Aberdeen in such numbers.
The Pittodrie club have sold out the last of their 7000 tickets for
the relegation decider at Brockville on Saturday. ''It's incredible the
commitment and enthusiasm they have shown for our cause,'' said Aitken.
''Some fans queued all night to ensure they would have tickets to be
at Brockville.
* COWDENBEATH have appointed reserve-team coach Tom Steven as manager
in succession to Paddy Dollan.

THOSE of us whose understanding of economics is a bit on the feeble
side are currently nonplussed. We all know that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer went to meet the Governor of the Bank of England: there were
even TV pictures of Ken and Eddie grinning at each other across a large
table, flanked by acolytes in suits who were also grinning at each
other.
Next day's headlines were full of the grave import of this meeting.
The two men had certainly met to discuss interest rates, with the full
panoply of the photo-opportunity-but-no-comment industry, and absolutely
nothing had happened. A typical headline would be -- Chancellor Does
Nothing Shock.
At our morning coffee debate in Nerd House, I said things were getting
really weird. ''I remember when a hike or a drop in interest rates would
have the newspapers in a ferment. Now they're getting excited when
there's no hike or drop. This does not help my understanding of the
economy one little bit.''
The Braces said we had to understand the tricky situation in which
economics writers found themselves. ''They were sure interest rates
would rise. They told their editors to hold the front page. But when
zilch happened, they still had to fill acres of space with
colourfully-phrased speculation.''
Ms Angelica Banana-Skyne, the High Whitecraigs Polymath, said history
was full of lessons like this. She recalled a satirical poem about a
battle in the Borders where both sides had run away from each other.
Very amusing. We asked how it went. She said that even better, she would
recite an updated version to cover the Ken and Eddie standoff:
''I grinned and he grinned,
And he grinned and I grinned,
We sat there grinning away, sir:
The outcome was dour,
But of one thing I'm sure,
A meeting occurred on that day, sir.''
Aha, I said. I think I'm beginning to get a better grasp of economics
already. Thanks Angelica. She threw me a look that meant I was a twerp,
and said it was my turn to clear away the cups and saucers.
ACCORDING to a ''colour specialist'' with a London ''image
consultancy'' power-dressing is now out for businesspeople of both
sexes. It is ''far too Eightes'', whatever that means. Instead, the
image for the Nineties is ''casually smart''.
This was fascinating. I learned that women should curb their tendency
to overdress for work, and try to look ''businesslike but feminine''
rather than sexy. Men should avoid funeral black or anonymous grey --
particularly if they hoped to achieve promotion.
I decided to keep this useful information to myself for a while, and
carry out a private survey of my office acquaintances. Here are a few
extracts from my notes.
Georgeous Georgette (Exogenous Variables): See-through blouse
revealing tangle of sub-outerwear equipment, teamed with last year's
overstretched black skirt, black shoes. Image assessment: either not
terribly serious about her career, or going straight to some dubious
club afterwards.
Sleekit Sam (PEP Sales): A strange ensemble of tomato-coloured jacket
with matching tie, light grey trousers. Image assessment: probably
applying for other jobs but definitely going out for a plate of
spaghetti at lunchtime. The splashes won't show up on his jacket or tie.
One terrifying fact I picked up from the London ''image consultant''
was that really ambitious people should copy the dress style of the
company head rather than that of their immediate boss. My notes show our
Chairman wearing a ravaged verdigris-assaulted tweed jacket, knitted
brown tie, unspeakable trousers. ''Obviously out for sea-trout before
dawn,'' is my assessment. Thankfully, I'm not that ambitious.

PETER Conway feels comfortable with the position of managing director
of Melville Dundas, though he has only held the job for a shade under
nine months. He puts feeling at home with the job down to the fact that
he spent 24 years with a sister company when both were part of the
ill-fated Lilley Group.
''I knew Bill Shearer the previous managing director, and I knew the
company's philosophy. It was not like a fresh start,'' says Peter.
The other reason why he feels comfortable is that Peter believes
Melville Dundas has put the bad times behind it and is well on its way
to achieving the ambitions set out at the time of the management buy out
in early 1993.
''We set ourselves the target of regaining the position the company
once held in the central belt of Scotland within five years, and we are
on track to fulfil this despite the recessionary pressures which the
industry has experienced.''
These pressures are still being felt says Peter but the company, which
has its headquarters in the Hillington Estate between Glasgow and
Paisley, has won more than #30m worth of orders since last August.
In addition to starting work next month on the prestigious five-star
Inter-Continental Hotel project in Glasgow, Melville Dundas's order book
includes a #3m contract for work at the Parkhead Forge and almost #10m
worth of house building contracts for housing associations in Glasgow.
Peter Conway has his eyes set on Melville Dundas re-entering the civil
engineering sector and believes that there are business opportunities to
be had in the North of England.
The pressures of the construction industry and a young family means he
says that he does not have a great deal of time for leisure activities
but when he returns home to Cumbria at the weekends he enjoys hill
walking, and while in Glasgow he works out when he can in the gym.
While breaking sweat in the gym Peter Conway thinks of ways he can
further boost the #45m turnover he expects the company to achieve this
year.

THE Scottish Claymores have cut out-of-form kicker Arden Czyzewski
after five weeks of World League action, replacing him with another
American specialist.
Czyzewski, who was a top kicker in his college days at the University
of Florida, was released by head coach Jim Criner yesterday, following
the Claymores' disappointing 11-10 loss to the London Monarchs last
Sunday at Murrayfield.
Ironically, Czyzewski booted a 42-yard field goal during Sunday's
defeat after having been brought off the bench in the fourth quarter.
He had been sidelined in favour of wide receiver Allen DeGraffenreid
-- who took over the kicking duties -- before Sunday's game because of
poor form in previous matches. Czyzewski made only two field goals in
eight attempts, although he was five out of six in point-after-touchdown
conversions. He was the league's fifth-rated punter, averaging 32 yards
a punt, his longest having been a 46-yarder.
But Czyzewski's most notable miss was a dramatic slice from 27 yards
in the dying seconds of Claymores' home opener against Rhein Fire,
which, as a result, they lost 19-17.
Taking over from 26-year-old Czyzewski will be Sean Conley, a graduate
of the University of Pittsburgh and a former kicker with the NFL's
Indianapolis Colts. He will join the team in Germany this weekend and
play in Saturday's rematch with Rhein Fire in Dusseldorf.
Criner said: ''Arden was having a tough season and felt he was going
through a kicking slump. He felt a change would suit him and we felt we
needed a new kicker.''
World League kickers have been under pressure this season. With teams
limited in the number of players on their rosters, kickers are required
to carry out both field-kicking and punting duties -- a situation
Czyzewski was not comfortable with.
After having missed the game-winning kick against Rhein, he seemed to
lose confidence. His benching and then replacement by a wide receiver,
with limited kicking experience, was tantamount to a vote of no
confidence by Criner.

SCOTLAND'S rugby captain Gavin Hastings earned two awards yesterday.
He was named Player of the Year in the prestigious Whitbread Flowers/
Rugby World Awards, and then received a unique honour when he was made
an honorary blue by Heriot-Watt University last night.
A Heriot-Watt spokeswoman said it was believed to be the first time a
British university had made an award for sporting achievement to anyone
who had not played for it.
England's honours go to Jack Rowell -- Coach of the Year, which he
also won in 1993 for his work at Bath -- and Mike Catt, who is named
Most Promising Player. The International Player is South Africa's
Francois Pienaar, who starred on the Springboks' tour of Scotland and
Wales last year.

IAN Wright smiles when he recalls how 10 years ago he established the
Berry Birch &amp; Noble presence in Scotland.
''There was a slight hiccup over our office premises,'' laughs Ian,
''which meant that I had to work from home''.
No big deal you might think as a lot of people work from home but it
seems that the comings and goings at the Wright household raised a few
eyebrows in the neighbourhood.
''My wife Val was a nurse and she left home just before 8.30 am every
morning, and then the female administrator I had hired arrived at 8.30.
She left at 2.30 in the afternoon and Val returned home at three
o'clock. Some of the neighbours were looking at me rather strangely.''
Ian Wright is now the director on Berry Birch and Noble's financial
services board with responsibility for Northern Ireland and a large
chunk of the North of England.
This entails a considerable amount of travelling but Ian still manages
to cram in time to help raise money for his other love, Heriot's FP
Rugby Club.
He played rugby for the school as well as cricket and in his last year
at school was named Sportsman of the Year. He is also a keen golfer,
having been introduced to the game at the age of six by his father, and
is a member of Royal Burgess where he plays off a handicap of eight.
When he was not playing rugby, cricket or golf, Ian managed to turn
out for the Edinburgh Northern football team.
Although injuries halted his active playing days for Heriot's 1st
Fifteen they did not stop his money raising activities for the club.
He is a member of Heriot's Fund Raising Committee, and over the years
has helped to raise well over #100,000 to send the team on international
tours to California, Vancouver, Hong Kong, and Boston.
''I help to organise the international lunches the club holds every
year to raise cash as it is an expensive business to finance a tour
which can easily cost more than #30,000,'' says Ian.
This year the club is considering touring South Africa, and once again
Ian will be involved in raising the necessary finance.
Berry Birch &amp; Noble are also looking further afield and Ian Wright is
actively considering the possibility of establishing a physical presence
in Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Northern Ireland.
''At present we cover the whole of Scotland and Northern Ireland from
Edinburgh but we may now open offices in these areas as our business has
grown,'' he says.

MURRAYFIELD rugby club confirmed last night that they will appeal
against a five-year ban on theirprop Billy Blyth.
He was suspended until the end of the century by SRU officials after
having been found guilty of an off-the-ball assault on Leith Accies
player-coach Ian Jeffrey, who suffered a double jaw fracture.
Murrayfield president Fred Ainslie said after an emergency club
meeting: ''While we do not condone violence on the rugby field, we are
shocked and dismayed at the severity of the punishment imposed by the
SRU disciplinary committee. The suspension imposed on Billy Blyth is in
effect a life-ban -- and this highlights an apparent inconsistency of
sentencing.''

IF you were to take a helicopter ride over the city centre of Glasgow
and look down on the flow of traffic and people, you would see three
streets -- Sauchiehall Street, Buchanan Street and Argyle Street --
packed with shoppers and fed by a constant stream of buses and traffic.
A block away, on either side of these city strips, the streets are quiet
and the buildings are run down and even derelict.
Like many other cities, Glasgow seems to service big traders on
selected streets, while other retailers slowly die, starved of passing
trade.
Many businesses in the Trongate area, for example, have not been
trading profitably for the last three to five years. Ask them why and
their answer will be the lack of interest shown in the area by city
planners. The old argument that Glasgow Cross is a secondary shopping
area isn't a fair assumption. Traders still have to maintain their
customers and deal with competition from large shopping centres, such as
the St Enoch's Centre which has the advantage of bus stops outside its
main entrances.
Further competition is coming in the form of a mammoth retail centre
development at Buchanan Street where another 70 shops will appear in the
next five years. This new centre will have a disastrous effect on
traders in Glasgow Cross, the Trongate and the West End of the city.
One simple solution would be to divert buses and traffic, putting an
end to the dangerous congestion caused when buses race up and down two
or three streets in an effort to beat each other to passengers. I
realise that city planners have to relate routes to passengers, but
consideration should be given to the way in which decisions about
traffic flow impact on retail outlets and residents. We should ensure
that the flow of pedestrian traffic travels smoothly from one end of the
city to the other.
There has to be some kind of compromise, especially when one considers
that areas outside a few well-serviced streets are dying a slow death.
The Trongate Traders Association has put the following suggestions to
city planners in an endeavour to revitalise affected areas:
* Cut existing rents to a realistic rate.
* Encourage new businesses to enter the area and take up all vacant
units.
* Encourage shoppers to patronise the Trongate City Centre
* Re-open Glasgow Cross railway station on the existing Argyle Street
line.
* Re-route buses from servicing only a few main streets.
* Remove pedestrian barriers that discourage people from crossing into
the Trongate.
* Pedestrianise the Trongate and Merchant City areas.
Anyone who knows the history of Glasgow should be ashamed at the
neglect of the oldest part of our city from Glasgow Cathedral down into
the Trongate, Merchant City and Glasgow Cross area. This area should be
a focal point for the city, yet we seem happy to ignore it. The whole
atmosphere and environment should embarrass anyone who lives or works
there.
Although known as the ''dear green place'', apart from the city parks,
there is very little greenery, shrubbery or trees in Glasgow. This is a
harsh city. Streets could be filled with greenery, yet there seems to be
no enthusiasm or encouragement from city planners.
Visit other European countries such as Holland and you can walk along
traffic-free streets with entertainment, cafes and shops. Their
environment is friendly and pleasant. Why can't we adopt the same
attitude on behalf of visitors to our cities? In Tokyo pedestrain
crossings are wide, every street is tree-lined, every street has shops
and everything is scrupulously clean. You never see dilapidated
buildings or smashed windows left boarded up. The heart of Glasgow, is a
disaster zone where historic buildings are left to fall into extreme
disrepair until they fall down or lie dormant, plastered with To Let
signs.
The millennium fund may provide one answer and there are plans in the
pipeline to redevelop the Trongate area. This provides a great
opportunity to improve environmental conditions in the city centre; to
create a more secure, livelier and friendlier atmosphere. But, despite a
questionnaire having been issued to local retailers, it is very
difficult to obtain information on what the city is actually planning.
Surely, more effort must be made to ask the people who live and and
work in the area for their views.
Reasons offered by city planners for the lack of action to date have
been financial but I think it is more a lack of will. Redeveloping and
cleaning up areas outside the main shopping belt simply doesn't appear
to be a priority.
I am sure I speak for many traders in the UK when I say that town and
city planners should cater for the whole retail industry and not just
the large, national stores.
Someone who is in a position of authority in the city must take the
initiative now and have the vision to see our city as it could be.
* Martin Groundland, a founding member of the Trongate Traders
Association and managing director of Symingtons Gold Shops, was talking
to Yvonne Wightman.

TOP shares closed at their highest level for more than 14 months as
financial markets ignored the risks of fireworks this morning when the
Bank of England publishes its inflation report.
The FTSE-100 share index came within five points of regaining the 3300
mark in response to the recent record-breaking run on Wall Street,
strong company profits, and the #860m Swiss Bank bid for SG Warburg.
Gilts were also strong, inspired by the continued good showing of US
Treasuries. The pound retrieved some lost ground from the Deutschmark
but this was partially offset by weakness against a stronger dollar.
The pound's international value has fallen sharply since the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, refused to raise interest
rates on Friday -- against the advice of the Governor of the Bank of
England, Eddie George, it is believed in the City.
It is feared that the Bank will be forced to conclude that this has
endangered the Government's objective of containing underlying inflation
to the bottom half of the 1% to 4% target range by the end of the
current Parliament.
The Bank's quarterly report will be preceded by last month's inflation
figures, expected to show the underlying rate edging down from 2.8% in
March to 2.6%, still in the top half of the Government's range.
Sterling rose above DM2.20, and closed 2.07 pfennigs higher at
DM2.2004. It lost 0.55 cents to $1.5876 as investors abandoned safe
haven currencies, such as the mark and the Swiss franc, in search of the
higher yields which can be found in the likes of the dollar.
The pound faces its big test this morning when the inflation report is
published at 11.30.

SCOTTISHPOWER managed a 7% rise in pre-tax profits to #375m in the
year to end-March, in spite of a fall in electricity sales at home
because of the mild winter. An increase in the capacity of the
transmission link to England and Wales, however, resulted in a #41m
advance in wholesale electricity sales outside Scotland.
Within three years, ScottishPower expects about one-third of all its
electricity sales to be outside its home patch.
Retail, a business which ScottishPower has been expanding, put in a
strong performance.
Overall, the profits figure came within the spread of City forecasts,
which ranged from #368m to #390m.
ScottishPower raised its total dividend by 10% to 13.65p, after a
final payout of 9.1p. The company reiterated its aim of increasing
dividends by between 5% and 6% annually in real terms. However, shares
in ScottishPower lost 7p to 338p, in a generally buoyant sector.
Group turnover was up 9% at #1716m. Sales by the core electricity
operation, which accounted for 85% of the total, were up #39m overall
because of the increase in wholesale business outside Scotland.
However, electricity supply revenues in ScottishPower's home patch
were #18m lower at #1199m, as a result of a 3.2% drop in unit sales to
domestic customers because of the unusually warm winter.
During the year, the capacity of the interconnector to England and
Wales averaged 1100mw, up from 850mw the previous year.
ScottishPower's 570mw share is expected to remain constant this year
but, assuming National Grid obtains planning permission to upgrade its
system in North Yorkshire, it is hoped a total capacity of 2200mw will
be available in early 1997. The company's share would then increase to
1365mw.
A decision on the proposed 250mw transmission link to Northern Ireland
is also pending. Assuming public inquiries on both sides of the Irish
Sea rule in favour of it, this should be up and running by 1998.
Electrical retailing has been built up significantly during the last
two years, particularly with the acquisition of 50 stores from the
collapsed Clydesdale chain. Turnover from retail leapt by 93% to #199m.
ScottishPower said its developing Caledonian Gas subsidiary and its
ScottishTelecom operation, which was launched during the year, were
making reasonable progress.
The strength of its balance sheet gives ScottishPower plenty of
expansion opportunities. However, analysts are not expecting the company
to adopt a gung-ho attitude.
Prior to regulator Stephen Littlechild's pronouncements earlier this
year, ScottishPower had been seen by the City as a potential suitor for
another regional electricity company.
Speculation had focused on Northern Electric because of its contiguity
to the Glasgow-based company's existing area.
Finance director Ian Russell has admitted that ScottishPower ran its
rule over Northern following the announcement of the Trafalgar bid.
However, it did not wish to become involved in a competitive situation.
Analysts believe a bid for another REC is now off the agenda, at least
until the current review of electricity distribution pricing controls is
concluded.
Declining to comment specifically on speculation, chief executive Ian
Robinson said: ''We are the third-largest electricity company in the UK.
We have clearly declared we are a builder of businesses.
''In all respects, through our core businesses to our developing
businesses to the outside world, we assess every opportunity to see if
it adds value to us as a company.''
Yesterday's results were ScottishPower's first since the arrival about
two months ago of Mr Robinson from Trafalgar House.
ScottishPower chairman Murray Stuart believes the wide range of
business experience possessed by the strengthened management team
provides the company with a greater capability in its search for new
growth opportunities.
Any expansion will be related to ScottishPower's core competencies.
The company is currently evaluating opportunities in Australia and the
US, although Mr Robinson said ScottishPower would be looking for only
between 5% and 10% of its business from international operations over
the next five to 10 years.
At its forthcoming annual general meeting, ScottishPower will seek
shareholder approval for powers to buy back up to 10% of the company's
issued share capital.
With a number of its southern counterparts having already bought in
shares, the City was perhaps disappointed by ScottishPower's statement
that there were no current plans to use the proposed powers.
ScottishPower takes 75% of Scottish Nuclear's output, under a
long-term contract. From an initial look at the Government's nuclear
privatisation White Paper, published yesterday, Mr Robinson believes its
proposals are neutral for his company.

A MILD winter in Europe and North America reduced insurance claims,
giving General Accident, the UK's second-largest insurance group, a 79%
increase in first-quarter profits.
Perth-based General Accident said strong business across the board in
the UK, but particularly in life insurance, had also boosted its
performance.
Pre-tax profits for the three months to March 31 soared to #110.2m
from #61.6m in the first quarter of 1994.
The result beat analysts' forecasts of #82 to #106m and sent the share
price up 13p to close at 586p.
''We have made an exceptionally strong start to the year,'' General
Accident chief executive Nelson Robertson said. ''More than half this
improvement has come from North America where there has been a welcome
reduction in catastrophe losses during the period,'' he noted.
North America accounts for nearly half of General Accident's global
business and this year's mild winter followed particularly bad snow and
ice conditions there in 1994.
As a result, underwriting losses in the US fell #17.5m in sterling
terms to #23.4m, while underwriting losses in Canada were down by #12.9m
to #15.9m.
An equally mild European winter boosted underwriting profits in the
UK, which accounts for a further third of General Accident's business,
by #10.2m to #41.5m.
General Accident, which ranks second after Commercial Union among UK
insurers, said every major branch of its business flourished in Britain
during the first quarter, despite tough competition and a fall in its
premium income to #378m from #391m previously.
''New business production in the UK remains encouraging -- against the
market trend -- and reflects the benefit of a strong distribution
network and growing consumer confidence in General Accident Life's
investment performance,'' the group said.
Deputy chief executive Barrie Holder said General Accident was
managing to hold its own against direct insurers who arrange policies by
telephone.
General Accident already had its own direct operation which accounted
for some 150,000 of its 700,000 motor policyholders, he noted.
General Accident said its worldwide net premium income fell in
sterling terms to #1029m from #1047m, but this was mainly a result of
currency movements over the past year.
Premium income in the original currencies was virtually unchanged.
Net investment earnings rose #2.3m to #114.7m in the first quarter and
General Accident's net asset value rose to 501p per Ordinary share from
427p previously.
The group had a total net asset value of #2322m on March 31, but this
rose further to #2519m on May 5, reflecting an improvement in world
equity and bond markets, despite the weak US dollar.

TOP CEES, beaten in controversial circumstances last time out,
galloped away with the Chester Cup yesterday.
The 8-1 shot was sent to the front by Kieran Fallon at the furlong
pole and galloped on well to win by five lengths.
Top Cees appeared to be tenderly ridden when a close fifth at
Newmarket last month.
Fallon and trainer Lynda Ramsden were exonerated over the running and
riding of the horse on that occasion but Fallon later admitted he may
have overdone the waiting tactics.
Ramsden said: ''It was not intentional what happened at Newmarket and
Kieran has apologised for it.
''He is an odd sort of horse,'' added the trainer. ''Only yesterday he
whipped round on the gallops and dropped his lad. He just has a mind of
his own.''

JIM Goldie had his first runners on the Flat at Ayr yesterday and he
produced a 4-1 winner.
Keep Battling, twice successful for the trainer over hurdles, came
from a long way back to take the feature handicap from Drummer Hicks
5-1.
His previous form on the level had been unimpressive but since joining
Goldie's stable at Uplawmoor in November, the five-year-old gelding has
proved himself more than capable as a staying hurdler, winning at
Edinburgh and Perth and going down by a short head at Sedgefield.
Goldie, 39, in his first full season as a trainer, was granted a Flat
licence just last month. Teejay 'N' Aitch, his first runner, failed to
show in the opener.
Success came an hour later when Keep Battling, well ridden by Gary
Bardwell, took advantage of his low weight to burst through the field
from the three furlong marker.
He took over from Drummer Hicks approaching the final furlong and from
there the outcome was never in doubt.
Goldie, who has already had eight winners over jumps, plans to run
Keep Battling in the Top Of The North hurdle final at Newcastle on
Saturday evening, provided he comes out of yesterday's race sound.
Persian Fayre, trained by Jack Berry and owned by Kirkcaldy
businessman Murray Grubb, was an easy winner of the first, taking over
from the favourite, Takeshi, a furlong out and winning by three lengths.
Linda Perratt's sprinter Diet ran his hundredth race in the Greig
Middleton Handicap, but despite showing prominently in the early stages,
finished out of the frame behind Rich Glow.
Diet has won 10 times, his last success was at Ayr in August, 1993.
Steve Williams, who rode Broadstairs Beauty, runner-up in the last
race, was called before the stewards and banned for five days for using
the whip with undue frequency and hitting the horse down the shoulder.
The ban starts on May 19.
The spotlight switches to Hamilton this evening, where Pomorie, twice
a winner recently over hurdles at Perth, takes her chance.
The mare, owned by Raith Rovers chairman Alex Penman, will carry top
weight in the Carlsberg Tetley Handicap but she has the advantage of
being fit.
Greatest danger should come from course specialist Mentalasanythin,
who finished third in an amateur race over the course on Friday. Also in
the field is Len Lungo's Noyan.

LEAVING Cowdenbeath Junior High School at the age of 16 to begin an
apprenticeship as a heating engineer, Scott Ramsay has vivid memories of
having to catch a 6.30am ''Mills'' bus each morning -- the only
transport which could get him to work in time for an 8am start.
Now, the 32-year-old managing director of Heatmaster Limited heads his
own Cumbernauld company and in his spare time is highly rated as a
semi-professional racing driver with Formula Ford who is already tipped
for faster things on the European circuits.
''I will never forget that 6.30am bus,'' he admits. ''But it was worth
it.''
Scott Ramsay finished his apprenticeship at around the time of the
miners' strike. Soon afterwards, the time-served young heating engineer,
married and with a young family, was seeking work. Thanks to a Job
Centre travel warrant and with #7 in his pocket, he found himself in
Newbury, Berkshire on his way to a new job. Within a few years he had
moved to another post in Swindon as his engineering skills began
developing to include management expertise.
Eventually, in 1989, family reasons brought him back to Scotland where
he worked with British Coal as a district technical officer and then
with other companies.
''But I had decided I wanted to set up on my own. I registered the
company name Heatmaster in 1992 and the following spring I took over
these premises with no carpet on the floor, no staff, and an old desk.''
As the new company's staff gradually grew in numbers, Scott Ramsay put
some basic principles into practice.
''I had learned, for instance, that communication always matters. I
still make sure I keep everyone informed about everything that is going
on -- and that works both ways. We have an ''always open door'' policy.
That, and our determination to provide a quality service, have always
been main factors in the way in which we have developed and grown.''
His staff of 14, all fully trained and qualified in their relative
disciplines, are headed by a skilled management team.
Heatmaster currently has over #1.1m in orders on its books. Recent
contracts completed include several in the six-figure bracket.
One example was R &amp; R Construction (Scotland) Limited at Carrick
Street, Ayr. Heating, ventilation and plumbing services to a contract
value of #262,000 were installed in the prestigious four-storey office
block in 12 weeks.
''We aim to maintain a constantly high standard of professionalism in
our work,'' said Scott Ramsay. ''That policy has won our company a
reputation for providing the best solution at the best prices in the
best possible timescale. We work hard to establish close partnerships
with our clients and then build these relationships to further
understand our clients' needs.''
Building on recognised technical expertise, attention to detail and
management ability, the Heatmaster team only received word of their
quality accreditation successes last month.
''But already we are seeing excellent customer reaction and their
congratulations are being backed with increased work orders.''

A FILM about the Lockerbie bombing is to be screened by Channel 4
tonight, despite strong criticism from Scotland's top law officer.
The Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, said he deprecated all
attempts to give a version of the atrocity ''from whatever angle'' while
criminal proceedings were pending.
''The proper place for the issues in the case to be explored is in a
criminal court,'' said a Crown Office statement.
However, the move to show the documentary, The Maltese Double Cross,
has been welcomed by relatives of passengers killed in the bombing of
the Pan Am flight.
Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter died, said the relatives' view was that
they wanted as many people as possible to watch the film ''and make up
their minds''.
He said: ''We have been repeatedly refused an inquiry to look into the
intelligence aspects of this disaster.''
The Prime Minister will be questioned tomorrow by Linlithgow Labour MP
Tam Dalyell on claims made in the 90-minute documentary, which was
directed by Mr Allan Francovich who says that a huge cover-up has taken
place.
The film maintains that Iran and Syria plotted to bring down the
aircraft as revenge for the US shooting down an Iranian Airbus months
before the Lockerbie tragedy in December 1988.
It says VIP passengers, including the then South African Foreign
Minister Mr Pik Botha and US secret service agents, were pulled off the
plane at the last minute before it left Heathrow.
It also claims Libya was not behind the bombing and that the British
and US Governments are wrong to pursue two Libyan suspects.
The Lord Advocate said he could not comment on specific allegations
while criminal proceedings were pending but ''if Mr Francovich -- or
anyone else -- considers he has any evidence relevant to the Lockerbie
investigation he should make it available now to the police.''
Adding that the Crown Office had seen what was apparently the full
version of the film, he emphasised the criminal charges in the case were
brought upon the basis of corroborated evidence supporting these charges
and therefore inevitably conflicting with much of its content.
Meanwhile, Mr Dalyell has claimed Scottish police have been barred
from interviewing key witnesses -- two baggage handlers at Frankfurt
airport -- as part of an official cover-up for an inquiry.
The MP said that he knew some policemen who had been told that the
Libyan connection was the final version of events ''and to stick with
that''.
He said the Crown Office behaviour had been disgraceful.
Channel 4 said the film raised serious issues which deserved a much
wider audience, adding: ''It is in the public interest to show it.''

A LAWYER yesterday criticised the Scottish Prison Service for failing
to safeguard a prisoner who hanged himself a week after a psychologist
found him to be mentally ill.
Paul Henderson, 25, who was serving a six-year sentence for assault
and robbery, was found hanging in his cell at Perth, two days after
being transferred from Aberdeen.
Lawyer Michael Monro, representing Henderson's relatives, told a fatal
accident inquiry at Perth that, but for breakdowns in communication,
involving Craiginches Prison, Aberdeen, and Perth Prison, Henderson
''would be alive today''.
He was one of seven inmates to have committed suicide by hanging at
Perth in 15 months.
Mr Monro said that only a week before Henderson's death a psychologist
at Aberdeen formed the opinion that he had gone mad.
But that assessment was neither recorded in Henderson's medical file,
nor passed on to Perth when he was moved there.
Mr Monro said there should be strict guidelines to ensure that
opinions about a prisoner's mental state were properly recorded in
future.
Mrs Caroline Lyon, representing the SPS, told the sheriff: ''With
hindsight it would have been useful for Perth Prison to know of the
psychologist's opinion. But you cannot go as far as to say that the
transfer of that information to Perth would have made any difference.''
Sheriff John Wheatley formally found that Henderson had hung himself.

A MOTHER who claimed that she fought off a bogus health visitor who
tried to snatch her four-month-old baby is to be the subject of a report
to the procurator-fiscal.
A spokeswoman for Lothian and Borders Police said yesterday: ''We are
not seeking anyone in connection with the incident. The case is now
closed. A report will be going to the procurator-fiscal.''
The force said that it would not be re-examining earlier attempted
baby-snatch incidents, which had been linked to the case.
It is thought that mother-of-two Mrs Lynne Stewart, 35, may have
invented the story as a cry for help. The police report will detail all
circumstances of the case and is expected to be sympathetic towards her.
However, Mrs Stewart later denied inventing the story.
Holding baby Erin in her arms, she said: ''As far as I'm concerned,
I'm sticking by my story. It's no hoax, it all happened as I said.
''I'm not going to be charged with wasting police time. I've heard
rumours about this. The inquiry is now over, and if you want any more
information then you'd better speak to the police.''
Stunned neighbours said that Mrs Stewart had spent four to five hours
with CID officers on Tuesday -- the day the search for the would-be
abductor was called off.
Officers are thought to have focused attention on Mrs Stewart after
attempts to trace the woman allegedly responsible drew a blank.
A major police hunt, involving dozens of officers, was launched three
weeks ago after Mrs Stewart claimed that a smartly-dressed woman, posing
as a health visitor, had tried to abduct her baby daughter.
Her convincing story received widespread media coverage when she
relived her ordeal with Erin and her husband, Michael, by her side at
Lothian and Borders police HQ, at Fettes, Edinburgh.
She said that she had punched the woman, forcing her to drop the baby
after the woman had tried to take the infant from her home in South
Gyle, Edinburgh, on April 25.
Mr Stewart said at the time that he was ''very proud'' of his wife.
Mrs Stewart said that she had been ill all night after the attempted
snatch and had been seen by her doctor.
Police had linked the incident to an earlier abduction attempt at
nearby Hermiston Court, and issued a photofit picture of the woman
thought to be responsible, along with a full description.
Next-door neighbour Mrs Rosa Stewart, 34, (no relation) a mother of
two boys, said there would be great anger within the close-knit
community about what had happened.
''There are lots of young babies in the neighbourhood. Everybody has
been scared to leave their children alone because of all the upset.
''I feel she's put everybody through hell, but she obviously must be
ill and needing help.
''I will be there to help her, but I don't think she'll get much
sympathy from other people. I think there will be a lot of anger.''
Mrs Stewart said that she had had doubts about her neighbour's claims.
''I had my suspicions from the beginning. She had a panic alarm upstairs
in her home, and I wondered afterwards why she hadn't hit that.
''She also appeared the next day in full make-up, and if someone had
tried to snatch my kids, I wouldn't have been in make-up.
''This is a quiet estate and we all look out for each other. There is
no way something like this could happen without anyone seeing it.''

GLASGOW University yesterday entered the last lap of a seven-year
marathon to establish new #7m sports facilities at its Garscube campus.
The university's plans envisage using about 30 acres of the 150-acre
''green belt'' campus to provide nine pitches for a variety of sports
including rugby, football, American football, shinty and hockey, as well
as a cricket square, running track and six tennis courts. There will
also be a pavilion and maintenance facilities.
Outline planning permission has already been secured for the changes
but the university will now seek detailed planning permission from the
two councils involved, Bearsden and Milngavie and Glasgow district.
The cost is being met by the university through the sale of its former
playing fields at Garscadden and the proposed sale of the Westerlands
playing fields.
In addition the university is also undertaking a #5m refurbishment of
the Stevenson Building, which provides a pool, gym, squash courts and
other facilities on the Gilmorehill campus.
The decision to rationalise the university's sports facilities was
taken in 1988, prompted by problems with facilities at Garscadden
including inadequate drainage, inadequate changing facilities and
vandalism.
A later study then ruled out an expansion at Westerlands because of
the lack of available extra land. Finally a proposal for an integrated
sports complex at Garscube was accepted in 1989 and outline planning
consent was secured in 1992.
Professor Sir James Armour, vice-principal for planning and external
relations, said: ''With this development and the current refurbishment
of the Stevenson Building, the university is aiming to provide the level
of sports facilities required by a university of Glasgow's size. We now
have 16,000 students and among them you will find interests in a wide
variety of sports.
''The previous provision of playing fields at Garscadden and
Westerlands dated from the days when we had half that number of
students. Neither site offered the opportunities for expansion and no
other open space within reasonable access of the university was
available.
''When the Garscube development is completed Glasgow students will
have one of the finest university playing fields in the country.''
The move was welcomed by Mr Jonathan Macdonald, president of Glasgow
University Athletic Club. He said: ''We fully support the development.
This project is long overdue and if the unversity is to continue to
compete on a level footing with other major Scottish universities then
this development must be undertaken as quickly as possible.
''I am positive that this development will greatly benefit the general
student population and I sincerely hope that these plans will become a
reality in the very near future.''
The land scheduled for pitches is currently used for grazing by the
university's veterinary school. To meet this need in the future it has
bought extra grazing land next to the university's farm at Cochno, on
the outskirts of Clydebank.
The plan for Garscube has been designed to maintain and enhance the
woodland of the estate.

THE City thought the Royal Bank of Scotland's 15% rise in the
half-time dividend to 4.6p was a trifle too canny and said so by marking
the shares down 8p to 404p. The bank retorted that its interim payments
were always prudent and asked which English bank had shown an increase
in operating profits in its latest reporting period.
Chief executive George Mathewson played a straight bat on whether
there was any intention to buy a building society, saying only that one
might be ''attractive to our group to achieve strategic objectives''.
But the question of what these are remained unanswered.
The basic figures are encouraging, with pre-tax profits rising 34% to
#270m on income rising 9% to #951m and pre-bad debt profits up to #341m.
The Royal has expanded its loan book by 12% with a 20% or #900m rise
in the mortgage book to #5300m and a #1100m jump in corporate lending.
Treasury profits were little changed at #44m -- the bank ran down its
bond book last year when storm clouds appeared on the horizon and all
derivatives trading is for customers
Bad debt provisions were unchanged on the second half of last year at
#70m and were #41m down on the six months to March 1994.
The Scottish bad debt position has shown little change over the past
year and there is some concern that the economy is slowing on this side
of the Border.
Overall staff numbers rose slightly because of the Direct Line
expansion and Citizens in the US, but those working within the branch
network fell by 200 to 9500 compared with 13,500 in 1991 at the start of
Project Columbus. That is designed to take #200m of costs out of the
branch network by 1997.
Branch banking saw a 60% rise in profitability to #106m because of the
improving bad debt position and growth in the loan book.
Chairman Lord Younger said that the bank was much better placed to
weather the next downturn in the cycle because of the great improvement
in credit control.
Direct Line contributed an extra #4m of profit at #45m, helped by its
19% cost advantage over the average of its rivals. That resulted in it
raising the number of its motor policies by a third to 2.1 million. The
Royal has a second string with its Citizens banking subsidiary in the US
-- the fastest growing financial institution in the US over the last
three years. Its contribution soared 81% to #49m and is making a return
of about #100m a year to its parent, which invested just #600m in the
New England bank. Thinking small and thinking locally has been the key,
and Citizens, already bigger than Direct Line, seems to be the unsung
hero despite vastly exceeding expectations.
A third division is emerging with the one-third owned Newton
Investment Group, which absorbed the Royal's under-performing Capital
House fund management activities last November. That contributed #3m in
the period and should bring in at least #10m for the financial year.
There is now in excess of #8000m under management and this is growing
fast.
Full-year profits seem set to advance to a record #590m to leave the
shares trading at nine-and-a-half times likely earnings, with a 20% rise
in the dividend total to 16.5p probable for a 5.1% yield.

<TEXT>
LABOUR MPs have demanded that a multi-million-pound deal transferring
3500 council homes to a private association be halted for an
investigation into alleged breaches of Scottish Office guidelines.
MPs John McAllion (Dundee East) and George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock
and Doon Valley) have tabled parliamentary questions on the transfer of
Wigtown District Council's entire housing stock to the specially-formed
Wigtown Housing Association.
They allege a lack of consultation and a conflict of interest for
councillors sitting on both the Independent district council and the
board of the new association -- effectively the buyer and seller of the
properties.
Since the controversy arose, three councillors involved have declared
a non-pecuniary interest.
But both MPs say the conflict of interest has not been properly
addressed because the consultants and lawyers involved still represent
both the council and the association.
They also claim tenants have been presented with a fait accompli. They
say a newsletter to tenants gave unfair backing to Wigtown Housing
Association by offering no alternative landlords.
The council insists the transfer is legal, popular, and in the
interest of tenants.
In a letter to Mr Lang last month, Mr McAllion, Labour's Scottish
housing spokesman, said tenants should have been given full information
about potential landlords and the implications of the transfer before
any decision was made.
He said: ''I am concerned that the interests of the tenants themselves
are not being taken into account . . . they are being presented with
what is in effect a fait accompli.
''Secondly, the independence of the specially-formed housing
association has to be questioned. It is still operating from council
premises and being funded by council resources.
''I also understand that its management committee is likely to include
both councillors and staff from Wigtown District Council. In other
words, the seller and the buyer are one and the same body.
''Your own guidelines on voluntary transfers of local authority
housing to private bodies stresses how important it is that alternative
landlords should be 'independent of the local authority' and clearly, on
that ground alone, the specially-formed housing association should be
disqualified.
''Thirdly, the timescale for this transfer is being imposed by the
local authority on the tenants. This is completely unacceptable since it
virtually guarantees that there will be time to consider only the option
of the specially-formed housing association.''
In questions put down last week, Mr Foulkes also queried the
consultation process.
In a letter to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, he asked if the council
was acting legally by spending money, including #160,000 which has been
set aside for a ballot and consultation process, without Scottish Office
consent.
The chairman of Wigtown district, Councillor Willie Service, insisted
the transfer was legal. He added that there was no conflict of interests
and that tenants were being fully consulted.
Mr Service added that the buyer and the seller were different bodies
and there would be no council staff on the management committee. He said
Scottish Office consent was not required for the #160,000.
He was surprised that Mr Foulkes and Mr McAllion had not written
expressing their concerns.
He added: ''As a 'not for profit' organisation, the housing
association has no interest other than providing a local housing service
for the people of Wigtown district.
''A transfer will mean that we can not only keep the housing service
local, but we will be able to fund new homes for rent out of the capital
receipt.
''There is no doubt in my mind that tenants' interests are of
paramount importance. The council is currently consulting with them on
the proposal and plans to hold a ballot of all tenants later this
summer.
''There can be no transfer without the agreement of tenants and to
pretend otherwise is to mislead tenants into believing their voice does
not count.''
Wigtown's Labour housing spokesman, Councillor Willie Scobie, cast
doubt on the security of new tenancy agreements, saying tenants would be
better represented if the properties remained in the control of a
democratically-elected authority.

FOOD safety watchdogs are to appeal against a judge's decision to stop
almost a tonne of Lanark Blue cheese being condemned because it
contained excessive levels of the germ listeria.
Lord Weir, at the Court of Session, effectively overruled a justice's
decision, taken in private, that the suspect cheese should be seized and
buried on a dump.
The decision was made during a private hearing on February 24,
attended by cheesemaker Mr Humphrey Errington, of Dunsyre, Lanarkshire,
at which it was alleged the cheese could be hazardous to health if
consumed.
Yesterday, Mr Bob Russell, Clydesdale District Council's director of
environmental health, confirmed his department would appeal against Lord
Weir's decision.
At a meeting from which the press and public were excluded, Mr Russell
gave a full report on the case to the environmental health committee.
Later, he said: ''We will appeal against Lord Weir's decision, which
really puts both parties back to the situation before the February
hearing. Counsel are drawing up our appeal, and we are very confident.''
Mr Errington, who said he had expected the council's demand to destroy
the cheese would be heard in open court, said yesterday: ''According to
Mr Russell, Lord Weir made his decision on a technicality, so, if he
believes he has such a strong case, why not go before a sheriff?''

SCOTLAND'S farmers have only three days left to submit claim forms for
Common Agricultural Policy compensation payments worth more than #300m.
Scottish Office Agriculture Minister Sir Hector Monro and John Ross,
president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, have combined to
urge farmers to make their returns.
So far just over half of Scottish farmers have submitted returns which
are due in by Monday if penalties -- and eventual total loss of subsidy
-- are to be avoided. Updated copies of farm maps are also required by
then.
Sir Hector said: ''An area aid application must be completed by
farmers who wish to claim arable and livestock aid under the Integrated
Administration and Control System (IACS) schemes this year.''
Mr Ross added that the NFUS knew of some farmers who lost out heavily
last year, due only to silly mistakes made when rushing to get forms
completed.

A STRING of expensive court actions involving farmers and seed
companies could be in prospect this summer, the National Association of
Agricultural Contractors has warned.
The forecast follows the failure of the European Commission to decide
a royalty rate which should be paid to plant breeders in respect of seed
-- including potatoes and grain -- saved by the farmer from his or her
own crops.
Negotiations over legislation to implement European plant variety
rights regulations stalled in April and are now expected to be completed
by the end of this month. That legislation will entitle plant breeders
to charge farmers a royalty on farm-saved seed.
At present draft legislation says the royalty rate should be
''sensibly lower'' than the existing royalty paid on C2 certified seed.
''If they don't set a rate, then the breeders will try to do so by
legal means,'' warned the NAAC. ''Farmers could well end up receiving
royalty bills calculated at around #30 a tonne for cereals, or 80% of
the C2 rate -- which is what the breeders have been demanding. When
farmers refuse to pay, the breeders will see them in court.''
Tim Rogers of the NAAC said that in a court battle the giant seed
companies would throw all the resources they could muster behind their
case to establish a high royalty rate. ''In our view a thriving, low
royalty, farm-saved-seed sector is essential in ensuring there is
competition within the overall seed market. Without it there would be
little to act as a brake on the royalties breeders will impose in future
on certified seeds.''
The European Commission, he said, should be responsible for setting a
rate which was acceptable to farmers. ''So far it has dodged that
responsibility. If it continues to procrastinate, then it will cause
great difficulty for the farming industry.''
The plant breeders take the view that royalty income is essential for
them to meet the costs of research and development of new varieties.

<HEADLINE>US targets pig and poultry markets</HEADLINE>

AMERICAN producers, who are already planning to become big players on
the world market for dairy products, are also targeting Europe and the
Pacific basin as outlets for pig and poultry products, it was claimed
yesterday.
Leaders of the of the pig and poultry meat industries are intent on
capturing an increased share of these markets at some cost to British
and other European producers.
The European invasion is being fuelled by the recent GATT agreement
which allows greater access to our markets and by low-cost grain
production in America which enables intensive livestock to be produced
more cheaply there. Feed is the biggest single cost factor in both pig
and poultry production.
The warning on this developing economic war was given by UK industry
commentators on the opening day of the British Pig and Poultry Fair at
Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, following the revelation that Britain racked
up record pigmeat exports of over #150m last year, with this year's
total running at nearly 20% ahead of 1994 so far.
Colin Baldwin, the Meat and Livestock Commission's pigmeat strategy
manager, said Britain would continue to face strong competition from
France, Denmark and Holland. ''In the longer term, I am told by the
National Pork Producers' Council in the United States that within 10
years the US will be the largest pigmeat exporter in the world.
''If this objective is achieved, American pigmeat will become a
formidable least-cost competitor in markets around the Pacific rim,
forcing EU exports to seek alternative markets. This will put the UK
under even greater pressure.''
Also speaking at the conference, Dr David Charles, head of poultry
development with the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service,
issued a similar warning for poultry producers.
''The UK's poultry industry must not underestimate the threat of
imports because of low material and input costs in key producing
countries and GATT arrangements increasing international competition
through its minimum access rules,'' he said, pointing out that each of
the three biggest poultry companies in the US was larger than the whole
of the UK industry.
Both speakers stressed the need for British producers to retain their
edge on technical efficiency. Mr Baldwin said the top 50% of producers
could withstand competition from anyone in Europe, while the top 10% to
15% could even withstand that from the US. But both emphasised the need
to form collaborative and marketing links.
In addition to the US threat, UK pig producers face a heavy investment
bill as a result of unilateral welfare legislation. This is expected to
lead to a substantial exodus from the industry, reduced home production
and through-put at meat plants and an increased import bill of #230m a
year.
''All sectors, MLC and Government must work together to find a
solution which will not damage further the competitive position of
British pigmeat,'' said Mr Baldwin. He indicated a new strategy document
would be published in the next few months.
Meanwhile, leading breeding companies are helping to ensure Britain's
pig farmers are provided with top raw materials. The Cotswold Pig
Development company unveiled a new formula for producing more low-cost
lean meat, while PIC launched two new bore lines designed to improve
production from what are seen as diverging markets: rind-on consumer
products such as bacon and chops and the growing added-value cuts
sector.
Scottish producers also showed their strength with the first national
pigmeat marketing award going to Scotlean Pigs, one of the largest
independent marketing co-ops in the UK handling more than 12,000 pigs a
week. The co-op, which has recently expanded into Yorkshire and the West
Midlands, revealed yesterday it had signed an agreement with another
co-operative, Nupork, increasing through-put to 15,000 pigs a week with
a joint turnover of #46m.

On the football field, striker Duncan Ferguson seems able to control
everything but his temper -- a failing which has had off-field
repercussions too. Ian Paul reports.
ANY footballer who is the subject of a public wrangle between two men
of such single-minded determination as David Murray, chairman of
Rangers, and Jim McLean, chairman of Dundee United, has to be different
from the norm, and whatever else is said about Duncan Ferguson, he is
not the boy next door.
Like Paul Gascoigne, the man who might walk through the same welcoming
doors at Ibrox as he did back in July, 1993, Ferguson has been known to
take up more time fending off news reporters than the sports writing
brigade.
Controversy and Ferguson were fellow travellers long before he became
Britain's costliest player (a status since relinquished to others) when
Rangers paid #4m to bring him down the M80 from Dundee, but even he
could not have been considered culpable for the long-running row which
featured the two chairmen. Ferguson was at its heart, but a pawn in a
game that, financially at least, outstripped anything of its kind ever
seen in Scotland.
McLean's long-standing belief that it is best to avoid selling club
assets to rival clubs in this country met head-on with Murray's
conviction that Ferguson should become a member of the Ibrox squad. The
rammy exploded into the public domain in January of 1993 when Dundee
United reported Murray, his manager Walter Smith, and the team captain,
Richard Gough, a former United player, accusing them of breaching the
league rules which prohibit enticing a player from another club to join
them.
Rangers were fined #5000 and the people involved warned as to their
future conduct, and so the stage was set for a protracted tug-of-war for
the 21-year-old striker between the two clubs, which went on for many
weeks. United seemed determined to sell him to Leeds United, who bid
#3.5m, but Ferguson wanted to go to Rangers and, in the end, Murray won
his point, but it cost him a British record fee to secure it. The
Rangers chairman was to make a profit on the deal in due course but
there were problems along the way before Ferguson's stint at Ibrox was
over.
Born in Stirling in December, 1971, Ferguson had perhaps indicated a
precocious nature when he walked out on Dundee United, whom he joined
from Stirling juveniles Carse Thistle, in February, 1990, after going
home to Stirling without permission. Even as a teenager, it seems, he
did things his way.
He made his first appearance for United against Rangers that November
as a substitute, but then had a series of disagreements with McLean,
culminating in a Tannadice statement saying that he would not be
considered for the first team unless he learned to accept the club's
code of discipline.
In January, 1993, he was fined two weeks' wages and banished to the
reserves, a punishment against which he lodged an appeal with the
Scottish League. However, his protest failed and although he made an
impressive return to the back pages when he played for Scotland against
Germany at Ibrox, he was to bring further trouble upon his head when he
injured his toe in a pub brawl. That put him out for the rest of the
season and did little to enhance his reputation with the Tannadice
management.
He had made other entries into the news pages, notably when he had
been fined #125 for head butting a policeman in Stirling in 1991, then
in March, 1993, when he was fined #200 for kicking a Hearts fan, who was
on crutches, after an argument at a taxi rank.
Four months later he signed for Rangers but was hampered by injuries
and the continuing good form of Mark Hateley, the man he was bought to
replace eventually, from making more than a limited number of first-team
appearances. He still managed to attract the wrong kind of headlines off
the field, however. In August, 1993, he was back in court on an assault
charge,
This time he had played a role in a bar-room brawl when his victim had
been knocked off his stool in an Anstruther hotel and kicked about the
head and body. At the time, Cupar Sheriff Court heard, Ferguson was
wearing a flower behind an ear, a single glove, a ladies' earring and
dark glasses.
Convicted of assault, Ferguson was given a dressing down by Sheriff
Charles Smith. He was told, effectively, that because of his high
earnings (about #5000 a week at Ibrox) a fine would be of little use. A
custodial sentence had been considered, said the sheriff, but the
sentence would be one of probation for a year.
''During that time you must get into no further trouble . . . and you
will get counselling to help you grow up,'' said Sheriff Smith.
The controversial trail moved back to the field, however, and his
collision with Raith Rovers defender John McStay, although not seen by
the referee, ended up in his appearance before the SFA on the evidence
of the referee superisor, and he was suspended for 12 games.
The player appealed against that ban which was then put on hold until
his court appearance on a charge brought for the same incident. In the
meantime, he was loaned to Everton where he was such a success that the
Liverpool club offered, and Rangers accepted, a #4.3m bid.
He still has to serve the 12-game ban, normally passed on from one FA
to another, unless his reconstituted appeal is successful (the SFA said
yesterday that they would reschedule the date for the appeal once the
court case was completed) but has since suffered further unhappy
headlines in Merseyside.
In March he was fined #500 and banned for a year for drink driving.
The striker had seemed to be out of the FA Cup final with Manchester
United on Saturday week because of injury but is still fighting to
recover in time.
An extrovert whose personality can entertain as well as infuriate,
Ferguson has been known to take over the mike in the Scotland team coach
to offer his renditions. He was also a whiz at computer games, reputedly
unbeatable in Nintendo contests, and, like his dad, a great
pigeon-racing fan. His temper has never been his best point, however,
and eventually seemed bound to land him in serious trouble. That
particular pigeon came home to roost in the Sheriff Court yesterday.

ONE man's vision can become another family's living hell. That is a
recurring theme in The Pied Piper of Hutchesontown, a community
performance about a community that has so often suffered at the hands --
and adjectives -- of others: the Gorbals.
The misleading guru of the title is, in fact, Sir Basil Spence -- here
named Spasil Bence and played as something of a Bloomsbury eccentric by
Anthony ODoibhailein -- who was feted for his visionary redevelopment of
post-war Gorbals. And the wide-eyed weans he led into the high-rise
towers of Queen Elizabeth Square? Well they were families like the
Cairns, whose life, with its ups and downs, we trace across the
three-and-a-bit hours of this piece.
Jim, the father, is fond of a drink. Mary, the mother, is a resilient,
hard-working, caring wummin whose heart and eye is, initially, in the
new hoose, complete with its dinette -- that's French, as she tells us
proudly.
But as the play unfurls it soon becomes clear that the move away from
the old tenements has also meant a move away from old securities, old
standards. For each one of the Cairns's children becomes a casualty of
what has been presented to them as upward mobility, a better standard of
living.
Linda, the oldest, finds that her romance -- smart hubby, bought house
in King's Park -- is really a ticket to a life of domestic violence and
estrangement from her family. Son Bobby takes to glue sniffing, daughter
Alice truants from school. Now not all of these disasters can be laid at
the designer doorstep of Basil Spence. But the message is clear. You
cannot bulldoze a community and expect that cement blocks will be
sufficient structures to replace flesh and blood ties, the human heart
of a community.
Just how important community is is borne out by this warm-hearted,
thoroughly committed project which is presented in a disused church, St
Francis, once the living heart of the area that now sprawls in
dereliction around it. People care about where they live. There is a
different kind of squalor which has nothing to do with poor sanitation
or overcrowding. This squalor is when someone who knows nothing about a
community decides they know what's best for that community.

AS the Festival Theatre's chorus-in-residence, Eric Ibler's Schola
Cantorum of Edinburgh has an ideal opportunity to learn to suit its
sound to its surroundings. Last night, in Mozart's Coronation Mass,
there were hints that this was happening, but they were too sporadic to
transform what looked on paper a marvellous programme into a meaningful
event.
If the Mozart was what you went for -- and it was, after all, the
concert's raison d'etre -- at least you heard one good performance. The
joy and sweetness of the music were nicely caught by Ibler's small-scale
forces, and the anticipations of The Marriage of Figaro tenderly voiced.
But the rest -- and more substantial part -- of the programme fared
less well, the opening account of Handel's Nisi Dominus sounding
particularly limp and out of focus. Here the soft-edged singing and
orchestral playing seemed to demand quite different surroundings, and
the way the solo singers gradually retreated from the front to the back
of the stage was distractingly suggestive of Haydn's Farewell symphony.
Mozart's Vesperae Solennes de Confessore sounded as if it had lacked
the rehearsal time given to the Coronation Mass, though Susan Leslie
rose to the exquisite Laudate Dominum, as Alison Williams, in spite of
some wispy articulation, also did to the drama of Haydn's Scena di
Berenice.
Too ambitious a programme? Sadly, yes. This was not really the sort of
event for which the Festival Theatre was designed.

IT began by sounding as though it was going to be -- musically --
massively overproduced. The thunder of the Paragon Ensemble intoning the
opening bars of Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001 theme)
sounded like a bad idea: start with a cliche.
But as Terry Neason took the stage and began a performance of a series
of superb songs, overproduction was not the order of the night. Here is
something worth hearing. (And Ms Neason's own critique of her first-half
dress -- ''ma bin bag'' -- saves us from further comment on the fashion
front.)
Her strength is her versatility of characterisation. Terry Neason
draws on an enormous range of dramatic vocalisation -- the brashness at
the end of her opening Sondheim song melts into the velvet of Cole
Porter's Do I Love You? There are some extraordinary interpretations
here: a slow, moody, reflective version of Stompin' at the Savoy; the
dramatic power and emotional range of her Porgy and Bess selection; the
vicious sardonic edge (utterly authentic) to Kurt Weill's Pirate Jenny;
and the poignant vulnerability of the beautiful As if We Never Said
Goodbye.
Occasionally (as in Every Time We Say Goodbye -- not a song to sing
when you're breathless -- and the title song of the show) she tends to
overinterpret; less is more on some occasions.
David Davies and the Paragon Ensemble, in highly unfamiliar territory,
play it to the hilt (Adrian Drover's arrangements occasionally over the
top at climaxes). Some of them are beautifully pointed -- the contrast
between vocal passion and classical instrumental purity in Jacques
Brel's If You Go Away was heartbreaking. Excellent show. Till Sunday.
See it.

Prosecution authorities are becoming more involved in sporting
incidents, but is the judicial stick being wielded uniformly? Derek
Douglas reports.
JUST six years ago the spectacle of a footballer appearing in a court
of law for a crime committed on the playing field was so rare that one
of Scotland's senior Queen's Counsel involved in just such a courtroom
drama referred to it as a unique test case.
Donald MacAulay QC was appearing for his client, the ex-Rangers
footballer Graham Roberts. It was 1988 and Roberts, along with fellow
Ibrox stars Terry Butcher and Chris Woods were standing trial on breach
of the peace charges at Glasgow Sheriff Court alongside Celtic's Frank
McAvennie.
The Old Firm four were said to have committed the offence as they
jostled each other during a highly charged clash between the two great
Scottish rival clubs.
''No football player in this country has had to face a charge of this
nature. It is a test case. Footballers are not immune from the law but
the action complained of was totally within the field of play and not
calculated against the crowd,'' said Roberts's lawyer who, as Lord
MacAulay of Bragar, is now the Labour Party's Scottish legal spokesman.
MacAulay served his client well, the case against Roberts being found
not proven. Butcher, however, was fined #250 and Woods #500. Frank
McAvennie was found not guilty.
Woods and Butcher took the matter to appeal and lost again. However,
the dissenting but minority opinion of Lord Murray, who found in favour
of the footballers, raised some of the questions which, to many minds,
have not yet been satisfactorily answered.
Lord Murray said the central issue raised by the appeals was whether
the footballers' conduct constituted not only an infringement of the
laws of the game but also a criminal breach of the peace.
The appeal judge accepted that what might constitute a breach of the
peace in the ordinary context of the offence was not necessarily the
case within the context of a contact sport.
''Once it is accepted that violent physical contact can be legitimate
under the rules of a particular sport, subject no doubt to further rules
which limit the legitimacy of that violence, I consider that a radically
different context is set up from the ordinary public street or other
public place.''
But the decision by Lord Justice Clerk Ross and Lord Allanbridge that
the convictions should stand has acted as a pointer for prosecutors ever
since.
As a result of the huge publicity the case attracted and the growing
awareness among police and prosecutors that the sporting arena was no
longer a ''law-free zone'', there has been an increased willingness on
the part of the legal authorities to expose sporting miscreants, and not
just footballers, to the full majesty of the law.
In October last year Sheriff Francis Lummy jailed Hamilton Accies'
winger Scott Henderson for 60 days after he had admitted head butting an
Uddingston opponent.
The Crown Office, while accepting at face value the contention that
more sportsmen are being prosecuted, is adamant that there has been no
policy decision to treat sporting offenders in the same manner as are
participants in a street brawl.
''There hasn't been a change of policy. Cases are still dealt with
strictly on a case-by-case basis but the circumstances in which the
alleged offence has been committed is also taken into account and in
cases involving offences in a big public stadium the possibility that
the offence might have an inflammatory effect on the crowd would also be
taken into account.
''I don't know what we can attribute the apparent increase in these
cases to. It is not for me to say that sport is becoming more violent
and I wouldn't do so, but whatever the reason it isn't because of a
policy decision by the Crown Office and prosecuting authorities,'' says
a Crown Office spokesman.
There is no doubt, though, that with special allowance for the
exceptional nature of a highly charged footballing encounter, the police
wish to see upheld the same standards of decency and propriety that they
would expect to be observed outside the stadium.
Strathclyde Police has the vast majority of Scotland's top football
clubs within its jurisdiction and the Strathclyde policeman with overall
responsibility for policing these grounds at the time of the Ferguson
incident was Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Peter Gibson.
Mr Gibson said: ''No specific guidelines are laid down in respect of
police involvement in 'sporting incidents'. The conduct of sport
participants on the field of play is governed and controlled by the
rules of the game, the sports' governing bodies and associations and, on
the day, by the referee.
''Nevertheless, in the event of the police receiving a complaint
alleging that an offence or crime has been committed, then in the normal
course the police would carry out a full investigation and report all
the circumstances to the procurator fiscal. Thereafter, it is a matter
for the procurator fiscal to decide whether those involved are proceeded
against through the courts. It is certainly true to say that complaints
of this nature to the police, including complaints made by spectators,
have increased over recent years.''
Chief Superintendent Alan Naylor is secretary of the Lothian branch of
the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents. Leith, the Edinburgh
police division which he oversees, includes the Hibernian football
stadium at Easter Road.
He says: ''Our main objective is ensuring public safety. In the
context of a big football match any incident on the field of play which
might endanger public safety will be looked at very closely. What we
have been trying to do is to encourage football to become the kind of
family entertainment which it used to be.
''Common sense has to be employed. If we were to report everyone who
swore at a football match then I would be locking up 20,000 every
Saturday at Easter Road. If, however, we see a violent incident on the
field of play then we will stand back and await the outcome. If there is
a complaint of assault from a player or a complaint from a spectator
that the player's action has amounted to a breach of the peace then we
will prepare a report and it will go to the procurator fiscal.''
Chief Superintendent Naylor adds that, as a football match commander,
he briefs the match officials. ''I tell referees that they are
responsible for the green bit in the middle and that will remain the
case until we see an event which so overpowers them that we have to
become involved. Happily, unlike other countries, that happens very
rarely here.
''If I am a match commander and the two managers are swearing at each
other in their dug-outs and I receive a complaint from a spectator who
says that their language is disgraceful and upsetting his five-year-old
boy then we have an obligation to act,'' says Chief Superintendent
Naylor.
But here another problem arises. Because of the quasi-independent
nature of the procurator fiscal service it is apparent that fiscals are
not dealing even- handedly with sporting ''crimes''.
In the Ferguson case, the Glasgow procurator fiscal, Mr Andrew
Normand, ordered an investigation and, when that investigation was
complete, decided that there was a case to answer.
Meanwhile, last August, two Heart of Midlothian players, Craig Levein
and Graeme Hogg, fell out in spectacular fashion during a ''friendly''
match against Raith Rovers at Stark's Park.
Eyewitnesses say they saw Hogg push his skipper Levein who, they
claim, twice lashed out at his fellow defender, the second blow
connecting and sending Hogg to the ground. Both men were sent off by the
referee, Hogg making his exit on a stretcher.
Subsequently, the Tyncecastle management decided that condign
punishment was in order. Levein was stripped of the Hearts' captaincy
and both men were suspended, fined and placed on the transfer list.
But neither Levein nor Hogg faced prosecution? Kirkcaldy procurator
fiscal Frank Crowe told The Herald that the police did not submit a
report, he did not ask for a report and therefore no action was
intended.
No doubt the fact that both men were from the same team, and as a
result one set of supporters did not have their passions inflamed,
played a part in the decision not to prosecute. Nevertheless, here we
had an apparent assault which went unpunished by the law of the land.
Another sport, another procurator fiscal. Last autumn the Hawick and
South of Scotland rugby forward Brian Renwick was playing for the
Combined Scottish Districts in a showcase game at Mansfield Park against
top the New Zealand province Auckland.
In the course of a not particularly bad-tempered game Renwick was
felled by a vicious blow from one of the Auckland forwards. The punch
shattered Renwick's jaw and the young Hawick player was hospitalised as
surgeons rebuilt his face. The blow was caught on camera by the BBC who
were video-taping the match.
As a rugged Border forward, Renwick is used to the rough and tumble
which accompanies top-class rugby. But he felt the assault went beyond
the bounds of acceptability. ''This is different,'' he said as he
reported to matter to the police.
Renwick was hoping his assailant would be charged with common assault
but he was disappointed. The procurator fiscal in Jedburgh decided to
take no action.
The Hawick forward, for one, would welcome uniformity of approach
throughout the land and wishes, too, that the same willingness to
prosecute which saw Duncan Ferguson in the dock at Glasgow Sheriff Court
had been displayed when he found himself on the receiving end of an
Aucklander's right hook.

ANOTHER female-fronted band. The T-shirt may belong to someone else
but the statement and sentiment applies equally to Salad, whose
emergence has coincided nicely with that of the likes of Sleeper,
Elastica, and Echobelly who have become music-press darlings in the past
year.
Marijne van der Vlugt is the female front person in question, and the
main cause of preconceived doubt about Salad's credentials. A
model-cum-media personality fronting a band on a major label disguised
as independent. Contrived? Suspicious? Should we be?
Perhaps not. Van der Vlugt is definitely their main selling point, a
fantastic performer and stage presence, all flailing arms and wide-eyed
expressions, with a voice which, while often threatening to
disintegrate, is idiosyncratic enough to overcome its most obvious
precedents -- Janis Joplin and Marianne Faithfull in more sensitive
moments.
Maybe the intrigue comes from the strange mixture of European,
Cockney, and mid-Atlantic in her singing and speaking voices, but
Salad's real failing is in the music.
With the exception of the openers, Drink the Elixir and Statue, and
their one moment of pop brilliance, Motorbike to Heaven, it is fairly
undistinguished fare, resembling a trawl through the worst parts of 4AD
roster, where nice ideas and textures are lost in a sea of off-kilter
guitar.
It's a frustrating occasion: van der Vlugt's guttural energy alone
holds together an otherwise unmemorable showing. Her stardom is assured,
but Salad's has yet to come.

HEARING the news of Kennedy's assassination in the company of Andy
Warhol is pretty unbeatable in the ''where were you when'' stakes, but
that's John Giorno for you. In jeans and a plain shirt, like a camp
longshoreman, he minces and skips his way through a history of sexual
and other encounters with the personalities that pepper the pages of the
Golden Age of Promiscuity and Glorious Substances.
Much of the material is drawn from his latest collection, You Gotta
Burn to Shine, but lots isn't. The already notorious Jane Bowles's Pussy
comes from an unpublished memoir, the philosophy of Stretching It Wider
dates from 1982: ''Nobody ever gives you what you want, except by
mistake.''
Giorno's performance has the vibrancy of a man living in extra time,
as he clearly believes himself to be. When so many of his former friends
and lovers have died of Aids, how come he is still HIV negative? His
recollection of a subway toilet encounter with one subsequent victim and
his own escape (then -- on to the train, now -- on to another chance) is
''one of many miracles''. Now there is something to boast about.
If his memoirs are geographically specific (275 East 54th Street, 220
Bowery), his imaginings are as precise -- disturbingly of the
self-induced violent death of Robert Mapplethorpe, refusing to give in
to the disease that is killing him. Giorno's poetry is often little more
than monologue with repetition, meant to be spoken, or rather delivered,
in his own warm voice, but it is compulsive. ''How the hell did I end up
doing this job?'' he wondered at one point. Because you're damn good at
it, we all replied, wordlessly.

DAVID MAMET'S Edmond, the second production by the recently formed
Theatre Works and the first under the direction of Catriona Macphie, is
an ambitious and perhaps rather curious choice for a company dedicated
to the training and retraining of unemployed actors and would-be actors.
Mamet's current notoriety, thanks to the controversy surrounding his
Oleanna, undoubtedly lend it a popular, if somewhat sensationalist
appeal.
It is not a small play. Edmond is a regular North American guy who
leaves his wife and rapidly descends into an underworld of sex, crime,
and violence. In the process, his prejudices are confronted; his beliefs
and values shaken. It has the quality of an odyssey, the epic journey of
an everyman, providing meaty material and a challenging showcase for the
sizeable cast.
Strong performances throughout -- despite some mid-Atlantic slippage
in the accents -- carry the narrative convincingly enough, recreating
Mamet's vision of the thin line between normality and madness,
lawfulness and criminality. The cast work well together summoning up a
succession of low-life characters and archetypes.
Unfortunately, the play's relentless drive towards Edmond's destiny,
the over-arching sense of fate which pushes forward the succession of
short episodic scenes, is dissipated by clumsy and awkward scene
changes. Intrusive and increasingly irritating blackouts sap the
production's momentum. Alan Reid's seedy sepia set, while suggesting a
suitably Chandleresque mood, is spaciously unadventurous, hemming in the
action and diminishing the scope and scale of the piece.
Theatre Works show courage, and considerable success, in staging this
play, but big themes need bold solutions. The commitment to acting
skills and textual analysis needs an equally strong vision and
consideration of production values.

William Russell enthuses over another movie devoid of swear words and
violence -- and wonders if the film world has gone mad.
SUMMER and sunshine and falling in love -- ah, one's salad days! Two
enchanting, innocent movies in succession: Before Sunrise last week,
Circle of Friends this. Has the film world gone mad? A film with no
swear words, no violence, and sex is something boys long for but which
nice girls don't do?
The time is 1957, the place Ireland. The basis for this gorgeous
little film is Maeve Binchy's novel about three girls from the small
town of Knockglen at university in Dublin. Bernadette (Minnie Driver),
known as Benny, meets Jack Foley (Chris O'Donnell), a medical student,
the dishy, albeit diminutive, star of the college rugby team -- judging
by his lack of inches he is a cox manque -- and they fall in love.
The ambitious Nan (Saffron Burrows), who has been dallying with Simon
(Colin Firth), a penurious sprig of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy,
discovers what happens to bad girls after indulging in sexual
intercourse with the bounder in a cottage belonging to Eve (Geraldine
O'Rawe), the third member of the trio.
After her father dies, Benny is forced to stay at home minding the
family draper's shop, which places her relationship with Jack under
strain. He gets drunk at a Dublin party, Nan, needing a father for her
child, seizes her opportunity, seduces him, and a shotgun wedding is
arranged. Poor Benny. Spinsterhood looms.
But enough of plot. It all ends happily anyway. What gives the film
its charm, Pat O'Connor's impeccable direction and Andrew Davis's
splendid screenplay apart, is the excellence of the playing and the way
that preserved-in-aspic period-look television dramas have made so
familiar is avoided.
O'Donnell radiates niceness as the boy, Driver is astonishing as one
of those big fat Irish girls who are neither beautiful nor plain, a
veritable Georgy Girl -- her trip to the college ball in the sort of
ballgown no longer worn, big bosoms oozing tremulously over the
decolletage, is hilarious -- while, as the creepy shop assistant who
wants to marry her, Alan Cumming is both repellant and sad. He would
have stolen the film were it not for Miss Driver, who is a find indeed.
Should anybody wonder what it was like to be young in the fifties,
this is as true a picture of the age as could be and the songs on the
soundtrack are a delight. Little things mean a lot. For some the
attraction will be anthropological, for others it will be a trip down
memory lane. Either way this is a circle of friends worth joining.
It is also by far and away the week's best, which, with films from
Roman Polanski and Woody Allen, is saying something. Polanski, after the
dire Bitter Moon, has come up with a sober treatment of Ariel Dorfmann's
celebrated play, Death and the Maiden. He has wisely not opened it out,
but much of the ambiguity which made the piece so compelling and
disturbing in the theatre has gone.
The scene is Chile, the dictatorship has fallen, the men responsible
for the reign of terror are to be prosecuted. Paulina (Sigourney Weaver)
is in a lonely house by the sea waiting for her husband, Gerardo (Stuart
Wilson), who has been appointed the state prosecutor, to come home.
He is late, his car has broken down, and he arrives in one driven by a
stranger, Dr Miranda (Ben Kingsley) who has given him a lift. Paulina
hides. Miranda learns who Gerardo is and professes admiration, leaves,
then finds a reason to return. Paulina emerges from hiding and a vicious
game of cat and mouse begins.
Paulina, arrested, tortured, and raped 15 years earlier by the secret
police, refused to reveal Gerardo's whereabouts, and is convinced
Miranda was her torturer. She ties him up and tries to extract a
confession, with a sceptical Gerardo acting as his defender.
Weaver is good, but much too tough for the role, which requires a more
neurotic edge than she can give. One should wonder whether Paulina is
imagining it all, allowing the tensions of the moment -- she knows
Gerardo is to preside over a cover-up -- and her desire for revenge to
warp her judgment. Kingsley, as Miranda, also radiates insincerity too
strongly on his first appearance so that one begins thinking him guilty
and that impression persists.
The film's examination of how perfectly ordinary people can do
horrible things and revert to their earlier selves -- or perhaps not, if
Miranda is innocent -- does hit home, but Polanski has failed to dispel
the feeling that there is an even better play in there somewhere.
Miranda's guilt is never in doubt, in spite of a highly equivocal last
scene implying Paulina might have imagined the encounter.
Set in the 1920s, Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway follows what
happens when an impresario gets the cash to stage a young playwright's
latest drama from a gangster. The quid pro quo is the gangster's dumb
moll (Jennifer Tilly in fine strident form) has a starring role.
Lushly photographed, handsomely dressed, and with a jazz score to melt
the hardest of hearts, it is little more than a mildly amusing
collection of back-stage cliches as the company of grotesques rehearse
under the writer's direction. As the Tallulah Bankhead-type star, Dianne
Wiest is amusing -- she won an Oscar -- but it is not hard to think of a
dozen actresses who could have done it as well, or better.
John Cusack's author is a charming innocent bumpkin, and Chazz
Palmentieri as the moll's bodyguard who, after sitting through
rehearsals, volunteers his advice about a rewrite and proceeds to take
the play over. Pleasant, although not actually all that funny, it is
very minor Allen.
Episodic, and brash, Kevin Smith's Clerks, however, is genuinely
hilarious -- and rather filthy. Dante (Brian O'Halloran) works at the
QuickStop convenience store, Randal (Jeff Anderson) at the video shop
next door, and the film follows a day in their working lives.
Smith, only 23 when he made it in his spare time for $27,000, has a
keen eye for the vagaries of human behaviour. Dante's troubles involve
his present girlfriend, his previous one, and the way Randal will try,
unasked, to tidy up his tangled life for him, plus an endless string of
peculiar customers and the weird drug dealer who hangs out on the
corner. It makes the Allen film seem tired.
In Boys on The Side Whoopi Goldberg is a Lesbian, Mary-Louise Parker a
fey girl who is HIV positive, and Drew Barrymore a fun-loving slut. It
is a case of Thelma and Louise go to Philadelphia, although they
actually end up in Tucson, where their messy lives are sorted out.
Miss Parker is better than the film deserves, Goldberg acts nicely
butch, and Miss Barrymore makes a splendid good-natured little trollop.
Clearly intended to be a celebration of sisterhood by the director,
Herbert Ross, something of a woman's picture man, there are times one
wishes they would drive their car over a cliff, any cliff.
GFT and Filmhouse are screening a new print of Georges Franju's
classic horror film, Les Yeaux Sans Visage, made in 1959. Unmissable, if
you like that kind of thing.

IF there was a prize for the jazz musician who has visited Scotland in
the biggest variety of settings over the past seven years, then Andy
Sheppard would have to be a front runner.
In addition to the hard bop-styled Andy Sheppard Quartet, Quintet and
Sextet, his adventurous Big Band, his jazz/rock group In Co-motion and
its ''Big'' cousin, Bristol-based Sheppard has ventured north as a
member of George Russell's Orchestra and with Carla Bley, in both her
Very Big Band and their trio with Steve Swallow.
The list goes on and will expand further as Sheppard returns twice
over the next few weeks, first with fellow saxophonist John Harle and
keyboardist Steve Lodder in a concert at Edinburgh's Festival Theatre to
celebrate the saxophone's prominence in twentieth-century music, and
secondly with Lodder and Brazilian percussionist Nana Vasconcelos at
McEwans' Old Fruitmarket, Glasgow, on June 30.
The group with Lodder and Vasconcelos is an extension of Small
Co-motion, which played a delightful concert during Edinburgh Festival
last year and seemed complete as a saxophone/keyboards duo.
''Well, yes it was, up to a point, and I liked the intimacy of it,''
says Sheppard. ''But I always heard a percussionist in there and it's
more fulfilling playing with Nana. We played a week at Ronnie Scott's as
a trio and recorded an album, which should be out by the end of June,
and then decided to make it a regular group.
''The only problem is, Nana lives in New York and is a big
international name, with lots of other demands on his time -- and Steve
and I are still working on that!''
Sheppard and Vasconcelos had worked together previously, whereas the
concert with Harle, a featured member of the Michael Nyman Band and
widely regarded as the leading classical saxophonist of his generation,
breaks new ground.
The pair met while playing independently at a concert in London last
year, marking the centenary of saxophone inventor Adolphe Sax's death.
''I'd heard John play before,'' says Sheppard, ''and I thought:
'That's fantastic but it's not jazz.' But then, it wasn't meant to be
jazz. It's interesting for me to work with people who come from that
European classical tradition because they have a discipline that I've
never had.''
In Edinburgh, they'll play separately first, with Harle playing
Debussy and Nyman pieces and Sheppard playing something by Carla Bley
and some of the music he wrote for BBC TV's Arena programmes about Peter
Sellers, then together they'll play a Stockhausen piece followed by some
new, specially commissioned pieces of their own.
''At least that's the plan,'' says Sheppard, who isn't used to having
a programme to work to and announces himself mightily impressed by the
three days' rehearsal they'll have beforehand. Though something of a
luxury to a jazzer, it's one he may become used to if his reputation as
a composer continues on its upward curve.
He is currently working on a concerto for pianist Joanna MacGregor,
and aside from assiduously checking that the notes he hears certain
instruments play in his head are not technically impossible, he is
enjoying himself immensely.
''I've written myself a great part, given the saxophone loads of space
for improvisation. It's been very time consuming -- about six months
that I could have spent writing for my own band, and it's a big
responsibility for something that might only get played once.
''I'm frightened of that, to be honest, and it would be easier to go
out and tour -- but it's exciting, and I'd like to do more.''

THIS year's exhibition of contemporary embroidery by Embryo, the
Dundee Textile Artists, titled Parallel Threads, is now showing at the
Smith Art Gallery in Stirling.
The title tries to force a connection between the work in an
exhibition which, at best, makes us spoilt for choice and, at worst,
confused by what has been chosen. It shows not only embroidery; not just
the work of Dundee artists; and in deciding to broaden its horizons
Embryo has perhaps limited its impact.
Tapestries from the Edinburgh Tapestry Workshop, excellent in
themselves, seem out of scale, stranded among a sea of smaller framed
embroideries. An In Memoriam section dedicated to the late Ann Innes
services sentiment well, but does a disservice to her talent by not
separating it from the rest, and risking it appearing outmoded.
The stuff of now has more than enough to satisfy. Dyed fabrics are
stitched into architectural order by Elaine Fraser, in columns of secret
symbols. Pauline Hann uses new technology to create an exuberance of
colour and texture that appeals to the tactile.
In her commission for the Royal Bank of Scotland, Rosemary Campbell
presents a tree-trunked landscape which, while not large, gains greater
depth the further you move away, and Frances Justice's Fairground
Attraction captures, in metallic threads, the irresistible gleam of the
carousel.
Aileen Neilson's coy but cleverly conceived hens Keekin' Out, as one
title aptly says, from pressed and sown leaves, are delightful. Jane
McArthur, well known for her waxy images of birds and fish, turns her
attention to Hogmanay in a well-crafted homage to our national drink,
and Claire Hemingsley charmingly reveals Two Wee Birds Chatting in a sky
of embroidered gold.
More resonant in meaning are Ruth Fitchet's tiny prayer rugs, Marcelle
Kelly's bag banners, and Carrie Varjavandi's The Lotus of Bahapur, with
its strong colour patchwork and tiny stitched images. All are inspired
by other cultures and each, in different ways, reminds us of the
mysteries of other people's faiths.
The exhibition runs until June 25.

ENGAGE the feet -- engage the mind. That, in a nutshell, is what Ludus
Dance Company have been doing very successfully for over 20 years. In
schools, community centres and various venues up and down the country,
Ludus have presented dance works that are really inventive and hugely
entertaining -- technically superb to boot -- but which also encourage
audiences to think about the issues that affect their own lives.
Take the piece which Ludus have brought back to Glasgow this year. The
Spark is a very funny, modern take on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet
that goes on to examine the advertising industry -- how it portrays
relationships, for instance, and what it pretends to offer us in the
name of soap powders, designer jeans, insurance policies.
The idea spiralled out of a slogan that caught James Mackie's eye.
Mackie is the company's director and a passionate believer in
encouraging people -- all ages, all abilities -- to think, creatively,
for themselves.
''It just lodged itself in my brain: 'If money can't buy you love,
you're with the wrong bank.' And I can remember thinking how clever, and
how utterly misleading and manipulative it was.
''So we started doodling round with what it was saying and came up
with our own slogan that we used to publicise the show -- 'You can't buy
it, but it sells everything', because once you start looking, you see
that love -- whether it's sex, or family, the boy-girl romance or some
mum making special sandwiches -- is used to influence people into buying
products, into buying something in the hope they will turn out like the
advertising image.''
The show deservedly won enthusiastic responses wherever it went. And
few were more exuberant or intense than those of Easterhouse's
Bishoploch community. James Mackie positively delights in the bonds
they've formed there over recent years. This Mayfest is their fourth
visit, and, he hopes, the beginning of a new initiative that will link
them further into the cultural life of the area.
Throughout this current residency, Ludus will be working with a
resiliently enterprising local group called Visual Statement, who have
been giving performances and running projects off their own bat for some
time. The aim, now, is to consolidate experience and expertise, for
Visual Statement to inherit and develop the workshop strands which Ludus
and the team at Bishoploch Residents' Hall have nurtured through a
succession of Mayfest projects.
''After 20 years of learning from experience, we have,'' says Mackie
with a chuckle, ''arrived at what funders call 'models of good working
practice'. Now Visual Statement are coming in, ready to benefit from our
experience, and willing to keep contact with the centre and the groups
we've seen there.
''Really you're talking about some kind of mutual support-system. If
there's some sort of year-round continuity, then Ludus can pop in at odd
times outwith Mayfest. We can demonstrate that ours is not a one-off,
hit-and-run, approach. We really do have a commitment to this community.
''We want to keep track of what the groups are doing, see what they
have come up with themselves, encourage them to go for it in their own
way -- because it is a real intention to have them show their own work
as part of a future Mayfest.''
In truth, the Ludus team never imagined things would turn out so
brilliantly, or so quickly. Mackie remembers when they first arrived in
Easterhouse. ''People there are very vocal if they don't like something,
or don't see a point in it. What were we there for? What's modern dance
doing in Easterhouse? They were incredibly sceptical when we first
turned up in the van.''
But during their first performance things changed. ''The room was
partitioned off, but so many people kept dropping in, to see what was
going on, and staying, that they had to move the partition -- which
opened up the cafe area behind. All these people, sitting smoking,
drinking coffee, suddenly became onlookers . . . But it worked. It was a
like a triumph in a gang show environment.''
It certainly worked, and primary school kids arrive at workshops,
eager to follow in the creative footsteps of older brothers and sisters
who brag about what they get up to with Ludus.
''It's not about building an audience for modern dance,'' says Mackie.
''It's about using dance to change people's perceptions. About getting
them to think about complex issues, yes, but also about encouraging them
to explore their own creativity, and to learn about trust and
responsibility and co-operation through the process of performing with
other people.''
To the notion of engaging feet and mind add -- engage emotions. Out in
Easterhouse, they know that Ludus can move parts other dance companies
don't bother to recognise.
* Ludus Dance Company and Visual Statement are giving performances at
Bishoploch, in Easterhouse, tonight and tomorrow night.

Hong Kong, Wednesday
CALLING him a self-styled James Bond, a judge jailed a wealthy Briton
for five years for possessing a loaded, unlicensed revolver, and a false
passport.
Ronald Milhench, 57, was arrested in November as he arrived in Hong
Kong after police acting on a tip-off raided his safe deposit box in the
colony.
The former British army sergeant major with a #1m penthouse in the
Philippines, a stable of yachts and a stake in a gold mine, was also
carrying packets of stink bombs in his briefcase, the High Court was
told.
Passing sentence, Judge Stuart Moore said Milhench, who pled guilty in
the bizarre case, had been ''playing silly games like an overgrown
schoolboy, pretending to be a James Bond figure''.
Milhench had teamed up in Manila with the late Lord Moynihan, a
British nobleman turned massage parlour owner, to break up a ring of
traffickers in illegal immigrants. He got the false passport from
Moynihan, said his lawyer, Robert Forrest.
Lord Moynihan died in 1991, but Milhench continued to work on his own
anti-smuggling operations. He went to Hong Kong to meet the traffickers,
lent them money to gain their confidence, and was given fake immigration
stamps.
A psychiatrist, Karen Singer, testified that Milhench suffered from
''mild hypomania'' an addiction to risk-taking and an inflated sense of
self-importance.
During the trial it emerged that Milhench was convicted in the 1970s
of forging the signature of former prime minister Harold Wilson on a
letter concerning a property deal. He then attempted to sell the letter
to a Fleet Steet newspaper for #25,000.
He was sentenced to three years in prison, after which he moved to the
Philippines where he built up a business as a wheeler-dealer.

Serzhen-Yurt, Wednesday
RUSSIAN helicopter gunships blasted a village in eastern Chechnya and
troops swarmed into the area today soon after President Boris Yeltsin
said there was no fighting in the region.
At least five helicopters swooped low overhead near Serzhen-Yurt, 12
miles south-east of the capital Grozny, and fired into a cluster of farm
houses on the edge of the village. Thick black smoke rose into the sky
and the sound of the firing echoed over nearby hills.
''The fighters have all gone to the mountains. There were only
civilians living in Serzhen-Yurt. They had returned to their homes
because of the ceasefire,'' said Lechi, a Chechen villager living close
to the scene of the attack.
The helicopters struck just minutes after Yeltsin, in a joint news
conference after summit talks with President Bill Clinton, sought to
play down Moscow's role in the region, which wants to break away from
Russian rule.
''There are no military actions going on in Chechnya . . . the armed
forces are not participating there,'' he said. ''The interior ministry
is now simply confiscating weapons still in the hands of some small
rebel bands.''
Yeltsin last month unilaterally introduced a temporary ceasefire to
cover the period of Russia's Victory in Europe celebrations, attended by
some 50 world leaders, and Clinton's visit. But both sides have
repeatedly violated it.
''We do not think Russian policy (in Chechnya) will change after
Yeltsin's meeting with Western leaders. After all, it is part of a
long-standing tradition in the west -- they accuse Russia of crimes but
do nothing to stop them,'' Movladi Udugov, chief Chechen spokesman,
said.
Immediately after the helicopters left, wheeling away and scattering
onlookers in panic, explosions that sounded like tank or cannon fire
shook the ground.
Shells slammed into nearby hills and three armoured personnel
carriers, loaded with marines, thundered down the road towards
Serzhen-Yurt. They were followed by four army trucks, mounted with
howitzers.
New Russian checkpoints had sprung up along the road out of
Serzhen-Yurt, a tiny agricultural village clinging to a hillside in
rebel-held territory.
Clinton said he had urged Yeltsin to make the ceasefire permanent and
bring the conflict to a rapid conclusion.
Asked about the attack on Serzhen-Yurt, White House press secretary
Mike McCurry said, ''The president very firmly expressed our grave
concern that Chechnya fighting that involves innocent civilians is most
troubling to us.''
''The prolongation of the conflict has been a damaging blow to Russian
prestige internationally,'' he added.
Itar-Tass news agency quoted a federal troops' spokesman saying
Russian forces had killed 38 Chechen fighters in 24 hours. One Russian
soldier had been killed and 11 wounded.--Reuter

BEFORE embarking on that spring diet in readiness for slender summer
clothes, it's worth taking a look at Jane Dunkeld's The Good Diet Guide.
With relentless thoroughness Dr Dunkeld appraises virtually every diet
under the sun, looking at the theory, the problems and the effectiveness
of each one, including diets she believes are pointless, even dangerous.
Until now, says Dr Dunkeld, there has been no objective overview of
diets, despite the fact the slimming industry is big business.
''So far books have covered really silly diets, and diets published in
science magazines aren't so accessible to the general public,'' she
said. ''Some people say I shouldn't have included diets I don't approve
of, but it's important to draw attention to the dangers of any method
that isn't safe and healthy.''
As many of us know from our own experience, typical dieters want to
shed the pounds in a few days and then return to their usual eating
habits while staying miraculously slim.
''People lose weight -- the problems usually come after you're off the
diet,'' said Dr Dunkeld. ''With any diet you're going to find people for
whom it was successful and those for whom it wasn't. The dieter's
comments included in the book are often both positive and negative.
''It's very difficult to choose a diet, because people have such
different lifestyles and family considerations.''
A busy working mother for example, might select something like the
Fatfield diet, which includes fare such as bubble and squeak and pork
chops, and allows convenience foods. A single person is more likely to
have the freedom to stick to a rigid weight-loss plan.
The Good Diet Guide is clearly written and amidst the information
are scattered enjoyable little snippets about food. Hippocrates, for
example, loathed fat people and advised they sleep on a hard bed, walk
around naked, never bathe and be panting with exhaustion before eating
one meal a day: and apparently the Ikung people of the Kalahari Desert
provide themselves with their daily nutrition through eating 150 ants.
(Suddenly lettuce looks more attractive!)
More practical information includes an examination of issues
surrounding weight loss (no, dieting will not cause a permanent change
in your metabolism) and a guide to standard requirement tables and food
labelling. She also dispels a few common misconceptions. Did you know
that cellulite is simply the French word for fat and is no different to
fat anywhere else in the body?
The  guide aims to present dieters with all they need to know to make
an informed choice about weight loss. According to Dr Dunkeld, reading
it will not only help would-be dieters to choose a weight-loss programme
to suit them, but also to avoid costly mistakes.
''One of my favourite stories is of a woman in Glasgow who paid #200
for a block of wood to put on top of the TV, where it would give out
ions to make her thin,'' she said. ''It didn't -- and even more
ironically her husband was a joiner and she could have had a block of
wood for free.''

FROM time to time I receive inquiries from young people engaged in
school ''projects''. I would guess that the pupils concerned are in the
15-to-18 age bracket and the subjects of their inquiries are usually
highly contentious issues like abortion and voluntary euthanasia.
The letters are invariably polite and they are not so numerous as to
make my task of replying other than pleasurable.
Nevertheless, I am disturbed by the apparent lack of any prior advice
from the schools as to how the pupils should familiarise themselves with
their chosen subject.
If my experience is typical, I feel there is a real need for a more
systematic approach when preparing pupils for their first foray in the
arena of public debate.

Joan McFadden delves into a childbirth guru's new catechism of
pregnancy and has the distinct feeling of being preached to rather than
being enlightened
JAN DE VRIES promises to take you step-by-step through conception,
pregnancy, labour and the birth of your baby, enlightening you while
simultaneously allaying doubts and fears. The merest thought of
conception seems to encourage most people to read every available piece
of advice, and subsequently there is a plethora of books on the subject.
As a renowned practitioner in alternative medicine, Jan de Vries could
be expected to extoll some revolutionary theories regarding pregnancy
and childbirth. His book certainly covers a range of subjects rather
different from the norm, but it is not the easy guide described by the
blurb.
Chapters on diet, vitamins and the early weeks of baby care are
straightforward, providing the kind of information given during good
ante-natal care. Similarly, advice on contraception and conception
centres on the Billings Ovulation Method, which is fairly standard.
Infertility is considered in a more unusual way. De Vries gives
details not only of all the common causes and treatments available, but
also suggests acupuncture and osteopathy where everything else has
failed. Furthermore, he recommends a positive outlook, which would
possibly be better applied to both possible outcomes of fertility
treatment.
Remaining convinced that you will definitely bear a child could
ultimately be too distressing if this never happens; encouraging his
patients to consider an optimistic outlook on a life without children
would be more realistic.
The sections dealing with alternative medicine were the most helpful
and informative, and not just for pregnant women. Since the book is
peppered with references to homeopathic remedies, further details of
relevant medicines would have been helpful, as would consultation
advice.
The title of this book is a misnomer, as so little practical detail is
given about the whole experience. Every chapter has some connection with
either pregnancy or post-natal care, but as a definitive guide it is
sadly lacking. There are a number of factors contributing to this
overall feeling of missing the point, and at the risk of being sexist,
there are certain parts which could only have been written by a man.
For example, the ''step-by-step'' description of labour takes up all
of one paragraph, culminating in the somewhat whimsical ''. . . after
this first gulp of air, surely the most welcome sound to a mother must
be to hear her baby cry''. It sounds lovely, but if this was the extent
of preparation for labour for the average first-time mother, she would
be incoherent with rage at her doctors by the time she actually gave
birth.
Any parent reading this book will certainly empathise with the
anecdotes and nostalgia throughout, but despite the passions involved in
becoming a parent, there is no point in attempting to describe them to
someone who has not experienced them, without risking becoming a baby
bore.
De Vries is clearly a very spiritual man, and has no hesitation in
stating his Christian beliefs along with his medical knowledge.
Unfortunately, this leaves a lingering feeling of reading a catechism,
and by the last page I was suffering from a distinct surfeit of
''elation'', ''joy'', ''the miracle of life'' and ''God's little gift''.
Considering that the only chapters I found interesting and innovative
were those on alternative medicine, I have a sneaking suspicion that De
Vries is jumping on the baby bandwagon, which is normally a surefire
bestseller. Health advice which could apply to anyone accounts for less
than a third of an already slim volume, and the tenuous links to
pregnancy do not make for an easy read.
I appreciate this is a difficult subject, and a very emotive one, but
a simpler approach would be better for the majority of new parents. Over
the past few years I have read, studied and assimilated a great deal of
literature of this genre, but I have to say this one would be well down
my list for recommending to others. In fact, I would be very surprised
to see it become a well-thumbed reference in anyone's bookcase.

* SHARKS don't get cancer. Neither do they get a whole range of
bacterial and viral infections, because they have a strong and effective
immune system. Now, for the first time, you can buy shark oil capsules
from health food shops in Glasgow. But is this just another health fad?
Is there any evidence that shark oil boosts the immune system?
Well, surprisingly, yes. Scandinavian countries have long known the
healing properties of liver oil from certain sharks. Fishermen used the
oil to heal wounds. They also used it for general debility, chest and
stomach irritations.
So what's so special about sharks? Well, their bodies contain the
highest concentration of alkylglycerols found in any living creature. We
all produce this key chemical within our own body -- essential for the
production of white blood cells -- but in nothing like the quantity of
sharks.
A number of studies have been carried out in Sweden under Professor
Ingema Joelsson of the University of Umea, showing that shark oil has
proved useful in combating a number of medical conditions, particularly
uterine cancer, and also helps to reduce the damaging effects of
radiotherapy.
The studies have found, too, that it enhances the immune system and
promotes the formation of antibodies. A wealth of anecdoctal evidence is
accumulating, claiming that it helps with other diseases too, such as
asthma and psoriasis.
Now several scientific projects are under way in Sweden and America to
evaluate the medical effectiveness of shark oil and its effect on
cancer. Meanwhile, if you want to try it, a pack of 60 capsules costs
#9.95p and can be bought from Neven Health Foods, 73 St Vincent Street,
Glasgow (0141 221 7865) or 27 Townhead St, Hamilton (01698 281415).
* MORE evidence has come from America that conservative therapy for
early-stage breast cancer confers the same long-term survival rate as
mastectomy, says a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Cancer specialists at the US National Cancer Institute followed up 247
patients with early-stage breast cancer. Half had undergone radical
mastectomy, while the other half had lumpectomy and radiation therapy.
Ten years later there was a survival rate of 75% for mastectomy patients
and 77% for those who had conservative therapy.
* BE healthy. Get active: that's the message from the Glasgow-based
Women's Outdoor Programme. Surprise yourself: try your hand at cricket,
canoeing, hillwalking, cycling, rowing, climbing, skiing or even scuba
diving this summer. Sessions will be held in Glasgow Sports Centres or
organised trips arranged into the countryside for hillwalking and
cycling. No experience necessary. These are women-only events. Further
details from the Women in Sport Team on 0141 227 5933.
* A nervous tic or, more serious, involuntary muscle movement can be a
distressing condition. Known officially as dystonia, it affects about
30,000 people in the UK.
Dystonia sufferers find it difficult to get a correct diagnosis, as
many GPs know very little about it, and even less about the treatments
and support available. To mark European Dystonia Awareness Week, from
May 13-20, the Dystonia Society is launching a freephone information
line, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until June 9. Ring 0800 55 66
29. Further information from the Dystonia Society, Weddel House, 13-14

* IF you suffer from irritable bowel syndrome you will be able to buy
over the counter from this month the antispasmodic drug alverine
citrate.
* SEXUAL difficulties faced by cancer patients are discussed in a new
guide produced by the cancer charity BACUP. Copies available from:
Sexuality and Cancer, BACUP, 30 Bell Street, Glasgow G1 1LG. Or ring
0141 553 1553.
* THE better educated you are, the less likely you are to suffer from
senile dementia. At least that's the conlusion of a Dutch study which
found an inverse relationship between dementia and level of educational
attainment. The report, in the current issue of Monitor Weekly, the
doctors' magazine, found that dementia was much more common among people
of low educational attainment.
* YOUNG women who suffer from migraine have more than a three-fold
risk of suffering a stroke. While the absolute risk is small, says a
report in the British Medical Journal, the researchers say young women
with migraine should be encouraged to smoke less, and they should not
use the oral contraceptive pill.

BILL MANN, despite much commonsense, makes his own contribution to the
confusion regarding the origins of the two world wars (May 8).
The outbreak of hostilities in 1914 and 1939 came as no surprise to
informed observers. Ominous signs had been visible for years. A
populous, well-armed, and aggressive Germany at the centre of Europe
posed a very real threat to the freedom and integrity of all her
neighbours, including Britain. Understandably, if somewhat belatedly,
they grouped together in self-defence.
In neither case did Britain enter the war till after hostilities had
begun and despite her serious unpreparedness. The implied suggestion
that Britain should have stood aside and given the Kaiser and Hitler a
free hand was decisively rejected by the British Government and people
in both cases then, and no doubt would be equally decisively rejected
should similar circumstances arise in the future.

AS A young student living in lodgings in Aberdeen I was asked by my
landlady to help her fill in her spot-the-ball coupon. Seeing myself,
even then, as a non-gambler, I declined the offer, only to be reassured
that she did want me to have a try. ''Just put a cross anywhere,'' she
said, ''it's not gambling; you just take a chance.''
I suppose in many ways I have been trying to sort out the difference
between a gamble and a chance ever since. But one thing I do know is
that if it is true that the love of money is the root of all evil then
the desire for undreamt of millions in return for a #1 ticket has to be
looked at with some care.
The Methodist people have traditionally set their faces against all
forms of gambling in ways that, in the past, seemed almost too draconian
for words. Such was our zeal to ensure that everyone got proper value
for their money that frustrated stall-holders at church bazaars went to
great lengths to look for ways of helping to support church funds with
games of chance that would get round the strict rule that no gambling
was allowed. Tombolas and raffles were definitely out, but could we
guess the weight of a cake or the name of a doll?
Such questions had the makings of nervous breakdowns for those who
were supposed to give a ruling on their acceptability or no. So over the
past five to 10 years our church has looked again at its stance on the
gambling issue, and has come to realise that there are some things that
you cannot do without taking a chance, and indeed to take a chance
offers some form of enjoyment as you wait to see if you have won.
Clearly we would not want to make folk do without everything that
involved a chance. I am just as wedded as anyone to playing ludo or
snakes and ladders with the family. I think I can even begin to
understand the way in which a small wager on the outcome of each hole
adds some needle to the game of golf. Where I think the serious
questions have to be asked is at the point at which people have their
lives radically changed by a fantastic win, or seriously blighted by a
near miss.
So much has changed because of the National Lottery. Shops have had to
dedicate particular tills to the sale of tickets; television has altered
its schedule to include the draw; sports, arts, local authorities, and
now even hospital trusts are looking for projects to develop which will
qualify for money from the Lottery Fund; and charities, which can only
benefit from little more than five pence in every pound ticket bought,
are already acknowledging that their receipts are down, with inevitable
consequences for their work.
What are we doing when we need to be bribed with half our money back
as prizes just to give generously? Already there are stories of folk who
decide not to buy a ticket in a week when the prize pool is not so big.
Do we really want to bring up a generation who wait for the #10m
jackpot, and think the #5m one not worth the chance? My real fear is
that the National Lottery will devalue our concept of money, devalue our
concept of giving, and devalue our concept of a reasonable reward for
reasonable endeavour.
And what support will we offer to those who do become ''victims'' of
the lottery? The two major Methodist charities (Methodist Homes and NCH
Action for Children) have decided that they will not seek any monies
from the Lottery Fund, and local Methodist churches will follow suit. We
will be trying to look at ways of helping those who find the lure of the
tickets too strong and their finances unable to cope.
At least one of our churches in Scotland is already host to a Gamblers
Anonymous group. Families and individuals will suffer, and as we have
seen already, some winners are quickly losers of privacy and
friendships. To the Government and the organisers such losses are
apparently acceptable; a reasonable price to pay for profits and taxes,
and some help to good causes.
What I hope many of us will ask is whether we want our society to be
changed in the way it is being changed, for the sake of a game. Some of
us are far from convinced that the end justifies the means, and worry
that a heavy price will be paid by a few whose plight will be obscured
by the much trumpeted good that is said to be done. To the damaged
players, this lottery game may be a chance too far.

Church in Scotland.

Stavanger
A MINIATURE city was christened yesterday before the start of its 109
mile sea voyage to become the most northerly offshore oil production
platform in the world.
The float-out of the Heidrun TLP (tension leg platform) will be the
climax of a $3.5bn project by Conoco to extract around 750 million
barrels of oil and 46 billion cubic metres of gas from a field near the
Polar Circle.
The giant Heidrun, undergoing final work off Stavanger, is the world's
first floating concrete platform and has numerous innovative features.
Conoco produced the world's first commercial tension leg platform for
their Hutton Field in the UK sector of the North Sea in 1984 and they
continue to break new ground with Heidrun, named after a mythical Norse
goat which ate from the Tree of Life and provided an unending supply of
mead to the gods and warriors.
Conoco will be happy with 200,000 barrels of oil a day by the end of
the year.
The Heidrun project is the largest ever for Conoco and its parent
company DuPont and represents a significant step in deep-water
production technology.
The platform is massive with its accommodation module alone the
equivalent of a nine-storey hotel. It even has a dance floor for discos
for the crew, which is about 20% female.
The distance from the seabed to its flare tip is 12 times the height
of the Statue of Liberty, the platform's on-board power system produces
enough electricity to supply a medium-sized town and apart from anything
else feeds 8000 light bulbs.
Conoco chose to install a TLP for a variety of reasons not least that
it enables production of oil and gas in deep waters where it would not
be technically and economically feasible using a fixed platform.
One of the benefits of the TLP design is that it can be largely
completed onshore before being towed to location and it is expected that
seven tugs will tow Heidrun out at the end of next month with production
starting just six weeks later.
There are no oil storage facilities on the platform. The oil will be
produced straight into three dedicated shuttle tankers and by using
direct loading an estimated $100m has been saved on the project. The
tankers lock on to special buoys around 50 metres beneath the surface of
the sea and the oil is pumped on board through a hole in the hull.
The platform itself is held in place by 16 tethers, each 250 metres
long, which were made at the HiFab yard at Ardersier.
The tethers are latched into four concrete foundation anchors on the
seabed and the buoyancy of the platform keeps the tethers under constant
tension preventing any vertical movement of the platform but allowing a
small degree of horizontal movement. The Heidrun's five modules sit on
two massive support beams, also a technological first for a tension leg
platform, which double as a safe haven in the event of a disaster.
At the moment just over 2000 crew are working on the installation to
prepare her for tow out and at its peak around 8000 worked on the
project.
The routine crew when production starts will be 220.
Immediately the oil starts to flow the operation will be handed over
to the Norwegian state oil company Statoil under the license agreement
signed in 1987 which made Conoco development operator and Statoil
production operator.
Statoil has a 75% stake in the field.
In the planning of Heidrun considerable attention has been paid to
future possibilities and it has been designed for a life of at least 50
years, approximately double the normal platform design life.

DAVE STEWART advocates the teaching of languages at primary school
level (May 3). The trouble is that the language chosen for this teaching
at that level will, as always in our schools at all levels, be French.
Everyone knows nowadays that French is in a state of decline. Former
French colonies such as Algeria and Vietnam have abandoned French. In
China, Japan, and Russia they waste no time at all on French.
I urge that French should be scrapped in our schools and that there
should be made available to pupils those languages which are of
substantial world use, namely Spanish with Portuguese, Russian, and
Arabic. There is a case for German in our schools but not nowadays
French.

LEADING businessmen last night delivered a snub to the Government
after two Cabinet Ministers pulled out of their annual conference.
More than 500 delegates at the British Chambers of Commerce meeting in
Aberdeen refused to propose their normal toast to Her Majesty's
Ministers.
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo was due to be last night's guest
speaker but pulled out to vote in the crucial Commons health debate.
Originally, last night's dinner was to have been addressed by
President of the Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine, but he too pulled
out because of Government commitments.
The three-day conference, normally seen as friendly territory for
high-ranking Conservatives, will not now be attended by any Tory Cabinet
Ministers.
But Labour leader Tony Blair will make a keynote speech to the
conference tomorrow.
The chamber's president, Robin Geldard, said last night: ''I find it
inconceivable that the debate in the House is more important than being
here tonight.
''Is it, I wonder, indicative of where business features in the minds
of Government Ministers?''
''It is a reminder that we should set our agenda which differs
importantly from the agendas of the politicians, the City, and the
media.''

THE Government last night easily beat off a challenge to its health
service policies in London, despite a lacklustre Commons performance by
Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley.
Two Tory MPs voted against the Government on a Labour motion noting
the public's concern over the closure of accident and emergency services
in London.
They were ex-Cabinet Minister Peter Brooke and Hendon North MP Sir
John Gorst. Two others, Sir Rhodes Boyson and Mr Hugh Dykes, abstained.
In the second vote, on the Government motion, commending the
Government's record on hospitals and its health plans for the capital,
at least five Tories did not vote: Mr Brooke, Sir John Gorst, Mr Dykes,
Mr Roger Sims, Sir Rhodes Boyson.
The Labour motion was defeated by 320 votes to 308, a Government
majority of 12.. The second vote, supporting Government policy, was won
by 319 to 302, a Government majority of 17.
The real casualty of the night was Mrs Bottomley, whose job is on the
line in the likely summer reshuffle likely to follow the Tories'
drubbing in the recent local elections.
Her task was to convince the public and, perhaps more importantly, her
own backbenchers, that she is on top of the job, but she struggled to
head off what would have been a potentially embarrassing Government
defeat on a key area of policy.
She was left battered and bruised by angry opposition to her plans
from several senior Conservative backbenchers.
Mrs Bottomley told the House: ''There can be no going back,'' as she
warned that to do nothing would be to sentence London's hospitals to
years of decline.
However, Mr Brooke swiftly delivered a blow to her credibility,
announcing that he would vote against the Government.
Sir John Gorst added to her problems, dismissing the Government's
palliatives and insisting ''we are still left with an insuperable
argument against closure'' of Edgware's accident and emergency
department, in his constituency.
Labour piled on the pressure, with Shadow Health secretary Margaret
Beckett saying: ''If this House wishes to send a message which even Mrs
Bottomley cannot misinterpret or misunderstand, that message must be
clear.
''It must be bold. It must be defeat.''
The embattled Health Secretary won crucial backing from Tory MPs with
constituencies outside London who resent the amount of health cash
soaked up by the capital and others who backed her strategy.
Mr Brooke, who has fiercely opposed the closure of Bart's in his City
of London and Westminster South constituency, told Mrs Bottomley: ''You
have said you will pay attention to the view of the House and I must, on
current knowledge, vote against you.''
He warned: ''If this House endorses the death warrant on Bart's, each
and every one who votes for it is responsible.''
Mr Brooke told the Health Secretary: ''I respect your certainty that
you are right, for you know how appallingly your reputation will be
undermined if you turn out to be wrong.''
Sir John Gorst, who has opposed the closure of Edgware's accident and
emergency department in his constituency, said he would vote against the
Government ''because there has been no meaningful concession''.
Sir John said that ''to force hard-pressed citizens, few of them
having their own transport, to struggle to find medical attention in an
emergency not a few steps away from their doorstep but up to an hour
away is a blind and insensitive form of planning.''
Warning Ministers to listen to grassroot opinion, he added: ''We must
be responsive to something more than cost efficiency and clinical
factors.''
To applause from the public gallery, he said: ''Human beings come
first, not balance sheets!''
Sir Rhodes (Brent North) also attacked the accident and emergency
closure decision, warning he would be unable to support the Government
in the vote.
''I know there has to be reorganisation but I never believe in the
rule of experts,'' he said.
''What worries me about the Health Secretary is that she spends so
much time talking about the experts as against the people at the bottom
of the pile.''
''There has never been real consultation with the man in the street.
Mr Dykes (Harrow East) said that unless the Government announced major
new concessions in the debate, he could not support it in the vote.
Mrs Bottomley, who faced Labour demands for her resignation, was
backed by Tory ex-Cabinet Minister David Mellor (Putney) who defended
her against the ''campaign of vilification'' he said was being waged
against her.
Mr Mellor, a former Health Minister, said: ''What Mrs Bottomley is
doing needs to be done. What is clear is that London cannot go on in the
circumstances that it finds itself.''
Mrs Bottomley sought to placate angry Tory backbenchers by promising:
''There will be no closures until alternative and better services are up
and running.''
She said: ''We have a crucial opportunity to prepare for the 21st
century.
''The price of doing nothing ... would be to let our hospitals and
services slip into decline -- to fail London and Londoners.
''And we are not prepared to pay that price. We will succeed by
holding firm, by being prepared to lead and not surrender.'' Amid loud
Opposition barracking, Mrs Bottomley said: ''There are no instant
answers or scratch-card solutions.''
It was time for a better balance of services. London had for too long
suffered from ''duplicated and fragmented'' specialist services.
The SNP's parliamentary leader, Mrs Margaret Ewing, said last night:
''The Government has scraped through but this is not much of a victory.
Health service workers and the public are angry at cavalier attitudes
towards the NHS. Eventually this Government and its unacceptable
policies will be rejected.''

DAVE STEWART says many Scots living in Europe have acquired foreign
languages ''by dint of necessity without them having delved into the
complexities of grammar'' (May 3).
Remarkably, Willa Muir and her husband, the poet Edwin Muir,
translated Kafka's novels and other works in German into English with
virtually no knowledge of German grammar.
As a student at Newbattle Abbey Education College in the 1950s I had
German lessons from Mrs Muir for a time. By way of correcting my work
she would read out loud what I had written and if it sounded right to
her would pronounce it so.
As I was using a German grammar book she would then ask me what
particular grammatical rules pertained, which I in turn would tell her
and we would go off to tea mutually enlightened.

DAVE STEWART'S letter, Language problem for the Scots (May 3),
reminded me of a recent visit to one of Scotland's top tourist
attractions. Preceding me was a group from a European country, whose
language I speak, according to one certificate, extremely competently,
so I tagged on.
The guide, resplendent in tartan, proceeded to address the group in
language frequently lacking the finer points of grammar essential for
clarity of communication.
Our foreign guests deserve better than the perpetuation of the myth of
British linguistic incompetence.

United Nations, Wednesday
NORTH Korea today quit the UN conference that is trying to extend a
key nuclear arms treaty.
UN spokesman Joe Sills said a letter from the North Korean mission
said it ''would no longer participate in the taking of decisions or
associating with documents emerging from this conference''.
North Korea is a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a vital arms
control agreement that for the last 25 years has had the job of stopping
the spread of nuclear weapons.
The hardline communist North is already locked in a dispute with the
United States over its nuclear programme and has been accused of
developing nuclear weapons in secret.  In 1993 North Korea warned it
could withdraw from the treaty but subsequently dropped the
threat.--Reuter

Moscow, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Clinton agreed to back Russian calls for changes in a major
weapons treaty, but only after Moscow first honours the deal as signed
five years ago.
''We believe some modifications are in order,'' President Clinton said
after summit talks with Russian leader Boris Yeltsin.
''We are supporting the Russian position there. What we want to do is
figure out a way for us to preserve the integrity of the treaty and
compliance with it but, in the end, respond to legitimate security
interests in Russia.''
The 30-nation Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty limits the amount
of non-nuclear weaponry that countries can deploy, but Russian officials
have warned they may not be able to meet the terms in the Caucasus
region.
They say the pact was drawn up when the threat to the Soviet Union
came from Nato to the West rather than from volatile regions to the
south of Russia.
Strict adherance to the final stage of the treaty, which comes into
force in November, would mean Russia reducing the number of tanks and
armoured personnel carriers in the Caucusus, the site of Russia's bloody
conflict with rebel Chechnya.
''The Russians are several hundred over the CFE limits in tanks so
they will have to come down substantially to meet the limits,'' one
senior official said.
The US has opposed renegotiating the CFE treaty because it fears it
could unravel completely if it is changed.
A senior US official insisted the United States was still determined
''not to fundamentally renegotiate the treaty''.
But if Russia complied with the final stage of the treaty, Washington
would support ''narrowly drawn'' modifications when the pact comes up
for review in May 1996.
Clinton and Yeltsin reached agreement on other aspects of conventional
arms at their Moscow summit, the seventh meeting between the two men.
They:
* Agreed details of Russia' commitment to halt new conventional arms
sales to Iran and to stop honouring existing contracts after 1999.
* Reaffirmed their commitment to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty but set terms to allow both countries to develop theatre missile
defences, which Washington is eager to do.
* Agreed that long-range missiles decommissioned under the Start arms
reductions treaties can be used for commercial purposes if the other
side is given specific details.--Reuter

Washington, Wednesday
A SECOND suspect, Terry Nichols, has been charged in the Oklahoma City
bombing. He is one of two brothers who were arrested two days after a
truck bomb demolished the Albert Murrah building, killing 167 people on
April 19.
The Nichols brothers are close friends of Timothy McVeigh, who was
caught speeding away from Oklahoma City 90 minutes after the bombing and
is suspected of driving the truck bomb and parking it outside the
target.
The two Nicholses have been charged with causing illegal explosions on
the other brother, James's, farm in Michigan.
The charges were evidently intended to allow the police to hold the
two while their possible involvement with the Oklahoma City bombing was
investigated.
Terry Nichols lives in central Kansas, about 200 miles north of
Oklahoma City. McVeigh was staying near there just before the bombing,
and is alleged to have rented the Ryder's removal truck that was used
from a rental agency at Junction City, Kansas.
He was accompanied by a second man who has not been caught, known so
far as ''John Doe number 2''. McVeigh was John Doe number 1 until he was
arrested.
Police have reportedly found evidence at Mr Nichols's house.
He appeared in court in Topeka, Kansas this afternoon. Prosecutors
want to move him to Oklahoma City.
They have also invited Mr Nichols's ex-wife and 12-year-old son to
return to Kansas from their home in Las Vegas. They have already
interviewed the son once, presumably to ask him the classic question
''When did you last see your father?'' The boy may be asked whether he
saw Timothy McVeigh then.

Sarajevo, Wednesday
FIGHTING spread in Bosnia on Wednesday as mortar and sniper fire
inflicted casualties in Sarajevo and ethnic Croats and Serbs fought an
intensive artillery duel in the north.
UN peacekeepers, who came under fire in the Bosnian capital, said
rebel Serb forces were tightening a siege of the city and demanded a
review of their mission by UN chiefs to make it more effective.
Four people were wounded by mortars which crashed into Sarajevo's old
town in mid-morning and sniper fire injured four other people during the
day.
A rifle-fired grenade hit a French UN armoured car on the city's
notorious ''Sniper Alley'' but its three crew on anti-sniper patrol were
unscathed.
France is already considering the future of its UN peacekeeping
contingent -- the largest provided by any country in Bosnia -- after
snipers shot dead two of its soldiers last month.
Bosnian Serbs used artillery and tanks to attack the Croat Orasje
enclave beside a vital supply corridor Serbs hold in northern Bosnia to
link their territories in the east and west of the country.
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported one person killed and two
wounded when a shell, allegedly fired by the Muslim-led Bosnian
government army, hit Mali Zvornik on the Serbian side of the Border with
Bosnia.
The fighting was the most widespread though not the most intense in
Bosnia since a four-month ceasefire ended last week.
Mission chief Yasushi Akashi refused a request by the UN military for
the intervention of Nato jets because of the risk of Serb reprisals.
UN spokesman Gary Coward said that the Serbs were closing the noose on
Sarajevo again, targeting supply lines, moving banned weapons back into
the area and hitting it with mortar fire.
The UN was also coming under restrictions to its movements. ''It's
part of the overall squeeze of the city,'' Coward added.
In neighbouring Croatia, tense after the government seized back a
rebel Serb enclaves, the two sides exchanged fire across a UN buffer
zone in the east of the country.--Reuter

Paris, Wednesday
CONSERVATIVE Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, defeated in France's
presidential election, resigned today clearing the way for
President-elect Jacques Chirac to form his own new government.
Balladur's move was a formality since outgoing President Francois
Mitterrand hands over power next week to Chirac, the conservative Paris
mayor who won last Sunday's run-off election.
In preparation, the new president held consultations with Foreign
Minister Alain Juppe, the man he seems certain to appoint prime
minister, and met advisers and potential cabinet members out of the
public eye at his city hall office.
Parliamentarian Elisabeth Hubert, tipped to be Chirac's health
minister, said she hoped the new government would include more women.
There were only three in Balladur's cabinet of 29.
Balladur's office said the outgoing premier sent his letter to
Mitterrand on this morning. The president was expected to meet him later
to formally accept the resignation.
On the 14th anniversary of Mitterrand's election as France's first
Socialist head of state, removal vans left the Elysee presidential
palace taking files to the National Archives and personal documents to
an office he will use on Paris' Left Bank.--Reuter

LT-COL GIBSON correctly slates the English for their parochialistic
celebrations of the VE Day anniversary (May 8). However, being an Army
woman, she ventures no further than the Army, Navy and Air Force
convention and makes no mention of the Mercantile Marine where every man
went to sea and whose losses were greater percentage-wise than any other
service.
I also served for four years in the MN and, my only link with the
Army, came out in '44 with a Major's pension.

MR JACQUES SANTER's presentation of the European Commission's vision
for the EU in the next century will cause a frisson in Whitehall if not
exactly throughout the United Kingdom. The commission's views are not a
blueprint and are not in any sense a diktat, despite what some
Eurosceptic Tories will claim, but they are a fair reflection of
mainstream European thinking as we approach next year's Maastricht
review. Why revise the treaty when it is only 18 months old? Well, the
answer is to be found in the paralysis which affects its workings,
notably in defence and foreign affairs and in the effort to find a
common justice policy. Both of these important fields are a failure
because they are in the domain of governments which cannot agree -- and
foremost among the recalcitrants is ours. This is exactly the type of
thing which leads to bumbling bureaucracy and paralysis, which in turn
give Brussels a bad name, causing ordinary Europeans to feel detached
from the new Europe. Mr Santer is correct, therefore, to argue for not
so much a new treaty, just one which is put to work with some critical
refinements.
Of all the changes required to make Maastricht more workable and, in
the buzzwords of the day, to ''bring Europe closer to the people'', the
most obvious is an oiling of decision-making procedure. The need is
patent: today there are 27 procedures by which the European Union can
reach decisions, and most of them are undemocratic. Mr David Martin,
Euro-MP for Lothian, is probably correct to point out that if the EU
were to apply to itself today for membership it would be rejected
because it is too anti-democratic. Change is essential, not just for
political decency's sake but for efficiency. This means a reduction in
the ability of member states to block measures they dislike: in other
words, an end to the national veto.
It is at this point that the British (mainly, it must be said, the
south British) cut up rough. Conservative Euroscepticism, allied to an
unusual influence inside the parliamentary party, has served to propel
Mr Major into making a fuss about the veto for all but the most
exceptional cases where issues of genuine national interest are
involved. The Government will lose the war, despite its nationalist
talk, but it might win some skirmishes along the way (and President
Chirac's intentions will be illuminating on this issue when he and Mr
Major get around to chatting as potential allies).
Finding a way of presenting defeat as compromise is now exercising
British minds. Several scenarios are contemplated in the rush for what
Mr Major calls a fairer voting system, by which he means an unfairer one
where the big EU states strive for an undue influence against the sudden
power of the increasing number of smaller members). And there is always
the social chapter, which is no more than a great fuss about very
little, given that it confers insignificant benefits on workers. Mr
Major's celebrated opt-out was calculated to earn him his
post-negotiation standing ovation in the Commons and some street cred,
and to that extent it worked. Nowadays it merely provokes conflict with
our EU partners. The opt-out's days are numbered, assuming Labour takes
office at the next election. A thought exercising many European minds
now is that British voters surely hold the key to the outcome of the
Maastricht review. By far the simplest way to avoid strife provoked by
Mr Major for domestic electoral purposes would be to delay the whole
process until after the British election.

Washington, Wednesday
The United States announced today it is ready to hit Japan with
punitive tariffs on its products in a bid to force open Japanese markets
to US cars and car parts.
Accusing Japan of ''unreasonable and discriminatory'' trade practices,
US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced the prospective
sanctions at a White House briefing and said the United States would
also file a complaint against Japan with the new World Trade
Organisation.
Although Kantor declined to go into specifics, other US officials have
indicated the trade sanctions -- if finally put into effect -- would
amount to billions of dollars worth of punitive tariffs on Japanese
products including luxury cars which are extremely popular with US
consumers.
Asked whether such reports were accurate, Kantor replied: ''The
overall amount (of tariffs) will be consistent with the problem we are
facing.''
''What we are looking for is reciprocity or a level playing field,''
he said.
He said a specific list of items on the prospective tariff list would
be published in a few days and that the sanctions would take effect
sometime after 30 days if the dispute was not resolved.
''If the Japanese want to address the issues we asked them to address
in a meaningful way, obviously we would listen, but we're going to
proceed (with the retaliatory steps),'' he said.
The announcement followed the collapse of talks to open the Japanese
car market to American products and help trim a record $66 billion
(#41.25m) annual US trade deficit with that nation.--Reuter

I FOUND the VE Day issue of Weekender very interesting and on the
whole comprehensive (May 6).
However, I was surprised and disappointed that a passing reference to
the sinking of the Jervis Bay was the only mention of the important part
played by the Merchant Navy in the survival of this country.
These ships carried the men, munitions, and food which were essential.
Without the courage and devotion of these seamen, an island nation would
have been overwhelmed -- 32,000 merchant seamen lost their lives and yet
their heroism has been largely ignored.
It was the Russians, not the Government, who gave medals to the men
who endured the Arctic convoys and survived. I note that the Queen in
her speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet did refer to the vital support of
our Merchant Navy during the War.
Your omission is all the more surprising since many of these ships
were built on the Clyde and very many men from the West of Scotland,
with its seafaring tradition, joined the Merchant Navy.
The dense concentration of shipping at the Tail of the Bank, inside
the protective boom which stretched from Dunoon to the Cloch, was proof
of the vital importance of keeping our seaways open.
The Merchant Navy did that -- and we should never forget it.

Britain is almost alone among developed countries in not having some
form of minimum wage. Ann Johnstone asks if we are the only ones in step
. . .
FRANCE has had one since 1950, and Japan has 547 different ones. But
Britain doesn't have any. And suddenly, the debate about a national
minimum wage is back on the political agenda with a vengeance.
This week, Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman restated
Labour's commitment to the concept for Britain, but attempted to divert
attention from the vexed issue of where to set the figure.
Next week, business leaders will reject the concept of a national
minimum, at whatever level it is set. A CBI paper will look at the
possible impact on different economic sectors and industries and give
the whole idea the thumbs down, despite research evidence appearing to
show that it has helped rather than harmed the economies of our
competitors.
Until now it has generally been assumed that Labour would set a
minimum wage figure in relation to earnings. Last year, Labour's Social
Justice Commission suggested #3.50 an hour. Several unions, including
Unison and the Transport and General Workers Union, have been pressing
for a commitment to #4.15, half of male median earnings.
But if Labour decides to opt for a price-linked figure, then it will
be impossible for them to hitch their wagon to any figure until after
the next General Election, on account of price fluctuations. With Blair
and Co under increasing pressure from both right and left to set a
figure, this looks distinctly like a body-swerve. If so, is it clever or
short-sighted?
Some would argue that it lets Labour off the hook rather neatly. After
all, if they had set the figure too low (eg #3 an hour), they would be
in trouble with the left and the unions, who would argue that it was too
low to tackle poverty and exploitation in the workplace.
If they had set it too high (eg #5.88, the current European Union
so-called ''decency threshold''), the Tories and right of centre
economists would have had a field day predicting that the move would
provoke millions of job losses and unleash an unstoppable inflation
spiral.
It is possible that Labour is damned if it does produce a figure and
damned if it doesn't.
Chris Pond, head of the Low Pay Unit, believes that Labour is shooting
itself in the foot by avoiding specifics because it leaves the party
open to reckless speculation and scare-mongering from both the Tories
and their own left wing.
British employers now pay some of the lowest wages in the developed
world. Here are some recent cases reported to the Low Pay Unit:
* a 23-year old working in a hairdressing salon for 53p an hour for a
66-hour week.
* a 17-year old working in a butcher's shop for #1.37 an hour.
* home workers employed at an average rate of 28p an hour.
* a dental nurse paid #1.55 an hour for a 45-hour week.
Low wages are either a proud boast or a shameful indictment, depending
on which side of the political divide you inhabit. Ironically, Britain
was one of the first countries in the world to recognise the need to
protect vulnerable workers from exploitation and ''sweating'', as it was
known, with the creation of Trade Boards in 1909.
Winston Churchill argued that without minimum wage protection: ''The
good employer will be undercut by the bad and the bad employer is
undercut by the worst.'' The boards were the forerunners of the wages
councils, which set minimum pay rates in hairdressing, shops, hotels and
clothing manufacture until their abolition in 1993. Now only the
Agricultural Wages Board survives.
This means Britain is now the only EU member state without minimum
protection for its workers. In France, the current rate is #4.19 an hour
and in the Netherlands it is set at #799 a month. Austria, Denmark,
Germany and Italy set a minimum through legally- binding, industry-level
collective agreements.
Labour argues that Britain's free-for-all results in the taxpayer
subsidising bad employers. Harman says the public purse currently spends
#2.4bn a year in benefits to those who aren't paid enough to live on.
But the main Conservative argument is that a minimum wage will force
up employers' costs and cut jobs. This will be the main thrust of a CBI
policy paper due next week, after a detailed consultation exercise with
companies most likely to be affected.
Meanwhile, right-wing economist and ''Treasury wise man'', Patrick
Minford, put the Conservative case earlier this week. The minimum wage
(which he puts at #5.50 an hour) and other European wage legislation
could wreck the British economy, he said.
He estimates it would put 1.4 million British workers on the dole.
And, he claims, wage-regulated Germany is losing investment and jobs to
the deregulated, cheap-labour firms of Britain.
The Low Pay Unit dismisses Minford's fears as scare-mongering and says
the figures are based on fanciful Treasury models which aren't validated
by experience in Britain and elsewhere.
If higher wages mean fewer jobs, you would expect the reverse to be
true, too. And yet although the abolition of the Wages Council has
resulted in the pegging or cutting of wages, there has been a decline of
jobs in the sectors affected.
And despite Minford's gloomy talk about Germany poaching jobs from
Britain over the past 20 years, they have created proportionately four
times as many jobs as we have, says Chris Pond.
Recently, Labour's Denis MacShane used Employment Department
statistics to show that the economies of most leading market economies
with minimum wage laws had achieved higher employment growth than
Britain in the last 14 years.
''There's a lot of evidence, particularly from America, that where you
have rises in minimum pay, you have employmemt growth,'' says Chris
Pond.
I suppose it comes down to whom you choose to believe.
Perhaps statistics, like bikinis, hide more than they reveal. Wasn't
it Winston Churchill who said that, too?

The future for viable heart replacements could lie in the pigsty,
reports Alan MacDermid, Medical Correspondent
REACTION to the death of the world's first patient to have an
''artificial heart'' permanently installed was optimistic yesterday. For
ex-stuntman John Cornhill's widow the device had brought him nine extra
months of active life; for surgeon John Wallwork, who installed it, it
has produced more information for the clinical trial he is running.
But the way forward in the search for a viable replacement for
diseased hearts is still uncertain, and has two directions beckoning --
the factory and the pigsty.
Strictly speaking, what Mr Cornhill received was not an artificial
heart but a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD), a servo-assistance
pump to boost the output of his own heart's main pumping chamber.
The plastic and metal device was implanted in the wall of his abdomen,
connected to his heart, and powered by a battery pack attached to a belt
round his waist.
It was still working when he died from kidney failure. Two other
patients have had the #40,000 devices installed at Papworth, one of whom
survives. Mr Wallwork plans to recruit more patients to a trial of the
device, comparing those who are fitted with it to patients receiving
standard drug therapy.
He said yesterday: ''We have learned an enormous amount, but the whole
issue of trials means you cannot come to any conclusions until you have
results, and you have to have reasonable numbers of patients to be able
to do that.''
Doctors in the US turned to the augmentation approach after
difficulties with attempts to install entire artificial hearts on a
permament basis -- the first four patients to receive them, in 1985,
died.
In America, however, even the assistance devices continue to be used
as a stop-gap until a donor heart can be found for transplant, although
they have been used in this role for as long as a year.
Until now the best replacement for a human heart has been another one
but, while demand grows, progress in areas like road safety is reducing
the supply. In Britain about a quarter of transplant candidates die
waiting for a suitable donor heart to turn up.
Manufactured organs will face problems of rejection and blood
clotting, and for this reason scientists have turned to the animal
kingdom as a possible source.
The current favourite is the pig, which -- contrary to its grubby
image -- can be bred and reared in sterile conditions to avoid the
passage of infections which might be harmful to humans.
Heart valves from pigs have been extensively used on humans. There is
less of a problem of rejection or clotting than with mechanical valves,
but they are more likely to wear out and need further replacement.
Going the whole hog and transplanting a heart across the species would
require a series of feats of genetic engineering, but at least three
companies, two in the US and one, Imutran in Britain, are working on it.
The first obstacle is hyperacute rejection, a powerful immune response
that surpasses the threat which human donor grafts face from the body's
white cells. That can be stemmed with immuno-suppressive drugs like
cyclosporin, but a cross-species organ would be attacked much more
quickly and aggressively by a group of blood proteins known as the
complement cascade; if the white cells are there to fight the invaders
on the streets and in the hills, the complement cascade is there to take
them on before they hit the beaches.
So the first stage has been to inject into pig embryos human DNA which
will fool the sentinel proteins into thinking the organ is ''one of
ours''. So far this technique has passed the basic laboratory test of
having human blood pumped through the pig heart without provoking a
hyperacute response.
After that, though, the picture gets increasingly complicated. If you
need a pig's heart not just any old transgenic pig will do. A whole host
of genes that make up each individual's major histocompatibility complex
will have to be matched to that of the transgenic pig. The new heart
will come, not off the shelf, but made-to-measure through the transfer
of mind-boggling stretches of DNA, well in advance of the medical
problem which gives rise to the need for it.
The kidney transplant pioneer Sir Roy Calne has already looked
forward, at least half-seriously, to the day when we all have our own
custom-made transgenic pig standing by to provide a liver, kidney, or
heart as the need arises.

POLITICIANS will be brought to book today when the Nolan Committee
makes its first attempt at wiping out ''sleaze'' in public life.
Government Ministers giving up office will find their immediate job
opportunties in industry curtailed, and backbench MPs their chances of
picking up money on the side vastly reduced.
The whole question of appointments to quangos also is expected to be
scrutinised and formalised.
It is widely anticipated that the Nolan Committee will recommend in
its first report that such is public disquiet MPs should no longer be in
sole charge of policing themselves.
The committee is likely to say that the vast majority of MPs are above
reproach.
However, it is anticipated that a watchdog will be appointed to look
into their extra-curricular activities.
Should it be found there were any suspicion of wrongdoing, Parliament
at the end of the day would decide on any penalty.
Through this proposal, the report will ensure an effective policing
operation but at the same time safeguard the sovereignty of the House of
Commons.
It is anticipated that potential lucrative directorships for Ministers
who lose office in future will be scrutinised by the independent
ombudsman.
From now on, those giving up ministerial duties will be expected to
follow the rules that already govern senior civil servants.
When they give up their jobs they might be forced to wait up until two
years before taking up positions in private companies with which they
might have had direct contact.
In the wake of the sleaze scandals, Lord Nolan and his team are
expected today to produce a unanimous report that will declare Members
of the House of Commons must clean up their act.
The Prime Minister, having set up the committee to wipe out the sleaze
factor, will have no option but to ensure the initial recommendations
are adopted in full.
It is widely anticipated that the committee will recommend that a code
of conduct should be drawn up for MPs declaring what is and what is not
acceptable.
This code will govern what work they can and cannot undertake for
outsiders while at the same time fulfilling their role as MPs. It will
certainly set the ground rules over payments from lobby organisations to
MPs.
In setting up the committee, the Prime Minister emphasised the
requirement of high standards for those in public life.
Speaking at a lunch in London last month, Lord Nolan said that the
public always had been sceptical about politicians.
However, in recent years their cynicism had become stronger and deeper
rooted.
The Law Lord -- who dislikes what he considers any decline in
behaviour or standards -- said then: ''As long as the people of this
country have confidence in the House of Commons then I believe nothing
much can go wrong.
''Without that confidence nothing much can go right.''

MALCOLM Campbell is not mistaken (May 9). During the war years bananas
were in demand for the treatment of coeliac disease, a food intolerance
not then understood except that these patients, mostly children, could
digest bananas.
Most supplies for the Sick Children's Hospital in Glasgow came from
ships from the Caribbean, which tied up at Yorkhill Quay, and whose
Masters would bring a ''hand'' in the ship's refrigerator.
Supply was intermittent, but then much in excess of requirements, so
that the nurses, of whom my sister was one, forbidden to take any out of
the hospital, became weary of eating bananas while the rest of us
yearned for even one.
Later research found that gluten, absent in bananas, was the offending
protein and gluten-free products continue to be provided on prescription
for coeliac sufferers.

I WRITE in reply to the letter of J C Weir (May 2) and in support of
the Rev Ian Hamilton of Nairn Old.
In upholding the law of the Church on baptism, Mr Hamilton is not
attempting to stop children or anyone else coming to Jesus.
He is encouraging parents to receive Christian instruction and then to
come into the fellowship of the Church on a permanent basis and to bring
their children with them so that together they will be part of the body
of Christ.
It is important to note that real grace is costly -- free, but not
cheap. It involves a willingness to learn about Jesus and to serve him
-- a new way of living, nothing less.

I TOO have an orange badge for a family member who is wheelchair-bound
and we have no problem with parking or access to the Royal Concert Hall
in Glasgow. (May 2).
We park, usually in the compound next to the hall, entering from
Sauchiehall Street and parking on the north side of this area where
there is a ramp and exit to Killermont Street, which is only a short
distance from the north entrance to the concert hall.
After that, no steps have to be negotiated as there are lifts at each
stage. (There is also disabled parking in the Buchanan Car Park,
opposite the same entrance.)
I can only assume that the ''apologetic young man'' encountered by J
Radwanski was a relief attendant as we always find the staff
exceptionally pleasant, helpful and welcoming.

One stop, shop till you drop, superstore rivalry over the top --
Margaret Vaughan checks it all out
YOU dump the kids in the creche, pause for a cappuccino in the coffee
shop, snap up a bunch of tulips, pop in to the dry cleaners, stop by the
chemist, browse through the discount books, pick up the holiday snaps
from photo-processing, get your hair done and your eyes tested, fill up
with cheap petrol, nip back in for a stamp at the post office . . .
And you still haven't got the messages.
Shop till you drop? As consumers, we seem to have gone off our
trolleys since the advent of the superstore. What has all this activity
to do with food? Not much. But it has a lot to do with changing consumer
habits and the money that can be made from them.
With Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway slugging it out for the victor's
spoils in the superstore wars, and casualties reported to be imminent in
the fight to the death amidst the dowdy pile-them-high decor of the
discount stores, Scotland is about to be gripped by a bout of trench
warfare fever. The battle is on for a bigger share of the purse in the
message bag.
Over the next six to nine months, says Leigh Sparks, Professor of
Retail Studies at Stirling University, we will see some more intense
competition amongst discounters, forcing some to the wall, and a big
push by Tesco, which is experimenting with its #257m acquisition of Wm
Low stores.
Safeway, keen to hang on to top billing, will inevitably respond and
Sainsbury's will continue to sniff around for sites to keep up its
expansionist efforts in Scotland.
Good news for shoppers? Well, it will mean a short-term reduction in
the check-out bills, with price reductions in the prices of basic food,
Professor Sparks predicts.
The costs, however will be met by the vanquished. More butcher's
shops, florists, newsagents and booksellers will vanish to metamorphose
into charity shops. The well-documented collapse of Main Street shopping
will intensify.
In the retailing world, big is increasingly beautiful. A recent report
from the Institute of Public Policy Research showed that the market
share of the big grocery chains (those with more than 10 stores) has
risen from 24 per cent in 1983 to more than 50 per cent and is forecast
to rise to 70 per cent by the end of the decade.
Scotland, though, still has some catching up to do when it comes to
one-stop-shopping. Food retailers, having saturated the market in
England, are targetting the #4bn spent on food every year in Scotland.
The big chains believe Scotland still offers big opportunities for
expansion.
The superstore was virtually unknown in the UK until the 1980s. By
1997, according to Euromonitor, there will be more than 2,800. The
origin of the superstore phenomenon lies in a fierce battle between the
grocery giants for market leadership, share price, dividends and profit.
Opponents call this greed. The superstores say it is normal, healthy
competition.
The other big competitors are the breed of hard discounters which sell
a narrow range of products at very low prices. There were virtually none
in Scotland before 1990.
Since then Shoprite, first to gain a toe-hold which became a
stranglehold, has been gobbled up by Kwiksave: Aldo, Netto and Lidl, all
privately-owned invaders from continental Europe, continue to grab a
bigger slice of the market.
It was the advent of the discounters, and the threat they posed to
what retail analyst Robert Clarke, of Corporate Intelligence, calls the
''multiple oligopoly'' of the superstore chains, which is credited with
keeping down food bills over the past few years.
''The threat from the discounters is still there, it's intense and
life for the superstore giants is not going to be the same again,'' he
says.
The major chains, he points out, have had to cut prices to compete.
But they still manage to have bigger operating margins than their
European and US counterparts.
The big three's operating margins -- a measure of how many pence they
make on a pound spent by customers after taking away operating costs --
have fallen now to around six per cent, Robert Clarke says. They were
way up at around eight per cent in 1990.
''The average operating margin of supermarkets in continental Europe
is about one per cent net. The monopoly of the few here ensures they can
make much more. There's less competition.
''It's also fair to say that in Europe the supermarkets tend to be
privately owned. They don't have to make big dividends for their
shareholders, as they do here.''
So are we still paying too much for our food?
''Food baskets here tend to take a higher proportion of disposable
income than in Germany or France. The evidence does suggest that our
prices are relatively higher.''
So could the big grocers cut their prices and still be as profitable
as their counterparts overseas?
It's not that simple -- is it ever? -- insists Professor Sparks.
He says it is impossible to compare shopping basket prices in the UK
with continental Europe: ''We eat cornflakes, they don't. They eat
Nutella chocolate spread, we don't. Prices reflect that.''
Still, the retail market research analysts Verdict had a go. Their
latest survey bears out the view that it is discounters who have held
down food prices. In April, the cost of 40 items bought at a superstore
was #31.86. From discounters the bill was #30.56. The gap has narrowed
dramatically. In September 1992, when the discounters were first moving
in in a big way, the price difference was 18 per cent.
In an age when work hours are longer and more women move into the
workforce to stay, ''one-stop-shopping'' makes a certain sense. From the
consumer's point of view, it may be more convenient. From the
supermarkets' point of view, it's a dream.
It has implications of course, for those who cannot drive to a
superstore, for those who run shops in the High Streets.
The paradox may be that consumer choice, freely exercised, could lead
inexorably to its own negation. A point worth pondering on your next
one-stop shop to dump the kids in the creche, pause for a cappuccino . .

IT USED to be the case that when reporters went to the Glasgow
headquarters of the Student Loans Company it was to cover angry
demonstrations outside and against a Government-funded agency charged
with the tasks of lending money to help students with their maintenance
and collecting it from them later. But these are changed days. Student
loans have become a fact of undergraduate life, as yesterday's news that
more than half of students are expected to have taken out a loan by the
end of the session shows. And the company now operates an open-door
policy. There is no-one, it seems, to whom it will not speak. This is as
it should be. It is no coincidence that this welcome policy has
coincided with the appointment of Sir Eric Ash as part-time chief
executive of the company until the end of the year, by which time a
full-time appointment should have been made.
The company has consulted widely in its quest to find a system for
repeat borrowers which will avoid last year's shambles, when thousands
of students did not receive their forms at their lodgings, or lost them.
It resulted in much hardship. All renewal applications will now be sent
to students' homes next month and, to make sure students do not put them
in the bucket, a decision was taken to signal, in loud and clear print
on the envelope, that this was an important document from the company.
Of those consulted about the proposal, eight out of 10 thought this was
fine, but the remainder were worried on behalf of those students who
would not want their parents to know they had taken out a loan. Well,
it's a tough old world and democracy had its day. But the episode has a
greater relevance. It tells us something about cultural attitudes --
that higher education representatives, students, and parents still have
grave reservations about going into debt to make ends meet during term
time.
It is not the fault of the Student Loans Company that it was in at the
beginning of, and indeed was the vehicle for, a cultural shift away from
free grants to an element of self-funding. Even if loans continue to be
taken out reluctantly, their uptake shows that borrowing to live has
become a fact of student, and parental, life. It will become
increasingly so. We should remember that the Government will take the
brakes off higher education expansion again and, against a background of
growing student numbers and increasing pressure to find ways of reducing
public expenditure, it will search for additional sources of funding.
Students are now contributing. The other options are few, but they will
be vigorously pursued because challenging higher education participation
targets for 18-21-year-olds have been set. That will mean recruiting
students from disadvantaged areas where there has been little or no
involvement in the sector. It is now quite common for ''mentor''
students to visit schools in such areas to promote higher education.
They talk about life as a student and take questions from pupils: How do
you get by? Well, I take out a loan and pay it back later. Who would be
a salesman in such circumstances? We can just see the job description:
Strongest of shoulders required to shift cultural attitude.

IT may seem odd that someone who had been brought up a mere 50
old-fashioned yards from Beardmore's Parkhead Forge could be a
Churchillite. But I am, nevertheless, just that. And so when Jack McLean
evinced knowledge, forgiveness, and generosity in his fine tribute to
the cigar-chomping, whisky-guzzling old bulldog, I was much pleased (May
5).
My working-class and perceptive grandmother maintained that no-one
could match Winston Churchill; and that was good enough for me. He
surely had his faults which were many and sometimes serious,
particularly during those exhausted and least-inspired years of postwar
premiership following his second coming. He won neither the war nor the
peace.
But the Churchill legend is not about sound-biting, back-biting,
domestic and ''meltdown'' politics. It has to do with the survival of
civilisation. And if history is merely a script written in some place,
then the great Director made a wise decision -- perhaps the only valid
choice -- in His selection of an experienced, multi-talented actor to
play opposite the man in Germany in a terrible saga of life and death.
Leadership is what Winston Churchill gave, that vital commodity still
in short supply 50 years after the end of the war.
What might have happened had Britain and France not signed that treaty
with Poland; or had not later honoured their obligation? Would the
ensuing battle of the tyrannical titans -- Germany and Russia -- in the
east have provided the necessary lebensraum sought by the Reich? The
instrument of organised human mass destruction in Europe was already
established by 1939.
What if Hitler had won in the east? What if Stalin had conquered the
west? What would have become of Britain and Europe without Winston
Churchill?
''You have just been listening to the Prime Minister,'' said the BBC
radio announcer (following that fateful first Battle of Britain
broadcast to the nation), then nodded across the desk. Churchill leaned
back in his chair, blew out a cloud of smoke, and said, ''Well, now.''
That bundle of sanctified old bones interred at Bladon will never be
forgotten. He was the man, and that surely was the moment of history.

AN attempt to bring only the third private prosecution this century,
against three men accused of raping a 25-year-old woman more than two
and half years ago, is incompetent, three High Court judges were told
yesterday.
Defence counsel for one of the men argued that the 12-month time
limit, within which the Crown has to bring cases on indictment, also
applies to private prosecutions.
The woman alleges that she was attacked in her home in Dunfermline in
September 1992, by Mr Alistair Forsyth, 24, Mr Graeme Naismith, 24, and
Mr Christopher Blount, 22, all from Dunfermline.
The case was set down for trial at the High Court in Kirkcaldy in
September 1993, but an essential Crown witness failed to turn up because
of a mistake by police in England.
The Crown asked Lord Clyde for an extension of the 12-month time
limit, but the judge refused and the case collapsed.
The alleged victim has now brought a Bill for Criminal Letters, the
means by which a private prosecution in Scotland is pursued.
If she succeeds, it will be only the third successful private
prosecution in Scotland this century.
Normally, prosecutions in Scotland are brought by the Crown under the
direction of the Lord Advocate. Private prosecutions have to be
sanctioned by the High Court, and are unlikely to be allowed in the face
of opposition by the Crown.
Yesterday, at the High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Rodger, QC, said he
could not concur in a private prosecution, but would not oppose the Bill
for Criminal Letters if the court thought it was competent.
That is the same stance as was adopted by the Crown in the Glasgow
Rape case.
Mr Edgar Prais, QC, counsel for Mr Forsyth, argued that in the
circumstances it would be incompetent to allow a private prosecution.
He pointed out that private prosecutions were extremely rare, and
there had been only two this century -- once in a fraud case over a
shipment of coal in 1909, and the Glasgow Rape case in 1982.
Mr Prais argued that in a private prosecution the individual stepped
into the shoes of the public prosecutor and was subject to the time
limits laid down by Parliament.
Under those limits, if a person was not brought to trial within 12
months of first appearing in court on a serious charge he was free from
further proceedings on that charge for all time.
In the present case, the 12-month period had been exhausted.
Even if the court was against him on the issue of competency, Mr Prais
would still argue that the private prosecution should be refused.
In the Glasgow Rape case, the court had laid down that there had to be
very special circumstances for taking the exceptional course of allowing
a private prosecution.
Mr Prais said that it could not be said there were such special
circumstances in this case.
Indeed, Lord Clyde had decided that the non-appearance of the witness
at the original trial was something that could and should have been
anticipated, and steps taken to ensure that he attended court.
The hearing continues.

Alan Watters describes how ME completely changed his life
IMAGINE you had an illness which no-one believed you had; that crushed
you and wrecked your life; that your GP did not recognise as all blood
tests proved negative. No support, hemmed in on every side by doubters,
you feel like a prisoner in a world of disbelief. Often this is the
experience of those who suffer from myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME.
My life was shattered by ME I had done well at school and had achieved
a university place for Law. However, literally overnight, I was struck
by a flu-like virus for which time proved no remedy.
I visited my GP, who told me I had a post-viral illness. All the
routine blood tests were performed to no avail. I was fortunate to
receive a diagnosis, although as time went on my doctor was very
unsupportive, as he did not recognise the scope of the illness.
All the time I was suffering from muscle fatigue to the point of being
virtually housebound. For someone in their teens that's tough. However,
the worst symptoms were those associated with impaired brain function,
such as malaise, poor concentration, memory loss and headaches. This
fatigue had a tremendous thirst which no rest could quench.
The breakdown in friendships was the most difficult aspect for me. My
friends' inability to sympathise made them a burden rather than a source
of solace. Their lives were progressing at university: making new
friends and having their first relationships, while I was experiencing
increasing isolation.
Marginalised by society, with decreasing self-worth, humanity seemed
to have failed me. But this disillusionment was the beginning of a new
life, and my eyes were opened to those others on the fringes, those
trampled underfoot and considered unimportant. I realised that life
could not be attained, only given. This repatriation to the spiritual
life has been an enduring strength and consolation.
One of the best decisions I made was to change my GP. Through the ME
Association I found a very sympathetic and knowledgeable doctor who has
a great interest in the illness. He recognises ME as a serious organic
illness. I was referred to the Southern General Hospital, where
important research is taking place, and the findings are making the
sceptics eat humble pie.
I was sent for a brain scan which showed a reduced blood-flow to two
areas of the brain. At last I had some definite proof! A significant
number of sufferers are proving to have this symptom. Other research has
identified enterovirus persisting inside the cells of muscles and the
central nervous system, altering their normal function. These results
are claiming attention in the medical world.
Thankfully, we are moving away from the time when the illness was
associated with high achievers who had burned themselves out, therefore
acquiring the name ''yuppie flu''. Now such a title is regarded as an
insult to the sufferers who come from all walks of life and from every
age group.
Finally, the advice I would give to those who meet people with this
condition is simple -- believe that person has a serious and
debilitating illness. Love can release them from the prison they have
had to endure.

TORY Euro-rebel Bill Cash, in Glasgow tonight for a European
Foundation Meeting, is to call for a new Act of Parliament to define
devolved powers for Scotland.
At the meeting in the Merchants Hall, he is also expected to chastise
the Prime Minister for being too slow to reject, outright, a single
European currency -- a cause he expects new French President Jacques
Chirac to adopt.
On the eve of Mr Major's address to the Tory conference, Mr Cash is
expected to claim that some of the defunct Scotland Act of 1978 on
devolution could be taken up by the Government.
He wants an Act of Parliament to set out clearly those areas of policy
best dealt with at Westminster, and those best dealt with in Brussels.
He will tell his Glasgow audience: ''It is right and proper that more
real responsibility should be delegated to Scotland.''

WE ARE very concerned about the morale of the Tory Party which has
congregated at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall for its Scottish conference.
Its members are so disspirited and out of sorts that there is not a
single motion on the agenda to bring back hanging.
The closest we get is a suggestion by the Gordon Conservative
Association that all children should be sent to prison. Unfortunately
only for the day because, ''a compulsory prison visit for senior school
pupils would act as a substantial deterrent to all would-be
defaulters''.
Other Tory conference traditions survive, with sundry old ladies (only
one wearing a blue hat, however) snoozing their way through the business
at hand. The comfy seats and the high ambient temperature in the concert
hall certainly helped in this respect.
Also to the fore, as usual, is that Tory conference trait of dissent.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke came north to face fierce criticism of his
stewardship of the economy. He had to reply to a motion which ''notes
the sustained recovery from recession'' and ''confirms the Conservative
Party's commitment to low taxation and sound public finances''.
The dissent came in the form of a Mr John Love, chairman of Monklands
East Tories, who suggested that putting VAT on fuel and taking tax
relief off mortgages were not exactly vote winners. Mr Clarke rejected
this pinko-Labourite approach and the matter went to a vote of the 300
delegates.
''Those in favour?'' asked chairman David McLetchie. Up went most of
the hands. ''Those otherwise minded?'' No hands as far as we could see.
Even when the Tories are in dissent they are not exactly against the
party. They are just otherwise minded.
Cathcart cure-all
JOHN YOUNG, veteran Glasgow Tory and a leader of the Otherwise Minded
Tendency, will today come up with a blueprint for a way out of the
party's current difficulties. In conjunction with four other former
chairmen of Cathcart Tories, with a combined 182 years before the mast,
he will announce a 10-point plan. Loosely based on a document of some
historic importance to our nation, Mr Young and Co have entitled it The
Declaration of Cathcart.
Sir Nicky's show
THE late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn was the biggest success of the
conference so far. A collection of his entirely individual and colourful
paintings is on sale in the foyer of the concert hall (probably entirely
without the artistic imprimatur of Pat Lally). Ten out of the 16 works
on display, from his Spanish and Mexican period, were snapped up on the
first day.
Precisely
A COPY of a letter from Scottish Provident, the life insurance and
pension people, to a school in Fife passes across our desk. It is a
reply to an invitation to participate in a management training
conference for the pupils.
The letter says: ''As we do not run a management training programme we
would therefore have difficulty in targeting a meaningful
presentation.'' The letter is signed ''Nia Parry, Management Trainer''.
Confused? So were the school.

PASSING through Perth this week, the only sign of canvassing we could
see was a young lady attempting to hand out a colour magazine to passing

reject the offer with the words: ''Most certainly not.''
Further investigation revealed that the publication in question was a
catalogue issued by the Ann Summers organisation. Among the offers
spurned by the Perthshire ladies: a condom which glows in the dark,
exotic underwear specially designed for sizes 16 to 28, and the chance
to host an Ann Summers party at home. No? Not even to raise funds for
the party?

TORY candidate Mr John Godfrey must be wondering if he has a ghost of
a chance in Perth and Kinross after the claim that former Tory
Government Minister Neil Hamilton had offered a newspaper a spoof
interview with the spirit of Sir Nicholas Fairbairn.
Mr Godfrey tried to limit the damage yesterday by condemning the
rather sick suggestion. ''It shows very bad taste indeed, and a crass
lack of judgment. To upset and cause distress to Lady Fairbairn was
absolutely disgraceful.''
According to the paper, Mr Hamilton -- who reluctantly resigned from
the Government after allegations about a free stay at the Ritz in Paris
-- would pose with a crystal ball and would claim that Sir Nicky's
spirit wanted voters to back the Scottish National Party.
The Liberal Democrats say the mock suggestion took politics to a new
low. ''People here in Perth have been just stunned by it. Sir Nicholas's
widow is a well-loved figure here,'' Liberal Democrat MP Archy Kirkwood
said yesterday.
Cheshire MP Mr Hamilton attempted to step back from the idea
yesterday, insisting: ''The article was a satirical spoof. It was sent
without my knowledge. When I spoke to them, I told them I did not
consent to their publishing it in any form. For their own political ends
they have blown up, distorted, and misrepresented this out of all
proportion.''
While Tory candidate Mr Godfrey has no truck with anything which would
be distasteful to the widow of the former Perth MP, he had of course no
such reservations about attacking his opponents.
At a public meeting this week he dubbed SNP candidate Roseanna
Cunningham ''Republican Rose''. Last week he was comparing nationalism
with Nazism, and now he appears to be comparing Ms Cunningham with Tokyo
Rose, the Japanese broadcasting propagandist of the Second World War.
With Chancellor Kenneth Clarke visiting the constituency yesterday,
the parties concentrated on economic issues. Mr Clarke said a Scottish
Parliament would send ''shivers down the spine of foreign investors''.
Mr Godfrey said that a higher rate of taxation in Scotland would be
catastrophic for the country's economic prospects.
In return the SNP, the party ahead in the opinion polls, produced
figures claiming to show that Scotland, relative to the UK, enjoyed a
budget surplus of #30m a year.
Away from the rather arid world of economics, the political issue
yesterday was trying to discover who was the most left-wing candidate.
The SNP's Ms Cunningham, Labour's Douglas Alexander, and the Lib Dem's
Veronica Linklater, all described themselves as ''left of centre''. Not
one, though, and considering the conservative nature of the constituency
perhaps not surprisingly, claimed to be the most left wing.
The candidates rather smartly said that as the other parties kept on
changing their positions it was difficult to say who was the most left
wing.
As Mr Alexander put it: ''When you've got an incoherent party
ideologically, like the SNP, it's difficult to say. I don't know where
Roseanna Cunningham stands on a number of questions.''
Or as Mrs Linklater put it: ''I would be pushed to tell you where
Douglas Alexander stands. I haven't a clue. I know he's a very bright
young man, but he's got to come clean at some point on where he stands
on issues.''
Ms Cunningham did admit that she was to the left of Labour leader Mr
Tony Blair -- but then added that almost everyone would be.
With nominations closing today for the by-election, three minor
candidates have so far broken the surface. Edinburgh teacher Mr Robin
Harper is standing for the Scottish Green Party, and candidly says that
saving his deposit would be progress for the party.
Mr Vivian Linacre is standing for the United Kingdom Independence

JACK WEBSTER'S article regretting the demolition of the Alhambra
Theatre in Glasgow struck a chord with me (May 8).
It was not pop-stars who were my teenage idols but the leading actors
and actresses of the Wilson Barrett Theatre Company. Names which have
remained with me are Richard Matthews, Pat Sandys, and Elaine Wells.
During the season a new play was put on every week, so that the cast
could be acting in one play whilst rehearsing for the next production.
My friend and I queued every Thursday night for a seat in the gods
priced around 1s 6d (7[1/2]p), from where we could see and hear quite
clearly, and all without the aid of microphones.
One very famous actor I saw in the Alhambra was Donald Wolfit. He
louped about the stage playing Richard III and when the final curtain
came down he hung on it portraying sheer exhaustion. Looking back, I
realise what a great ham he really was, but then that was theatre!
Glasgow has a history of theatres burning to the ground but the
deliberate destruction of a beautiful Victorian theatre was a real
crime. Nothing has replaced it.

FOR an actor playing the role of a Tory Cabinet minister caught with
his trousers down in the company of a young woman who is not his wife,
Trevor Eve has one very serious credibility problem. He is far too
handsome.
In Channel 4's forthcoming three-part drama, The Politician's Wife, he
is, one supposes, an amalgam of David Mellor, Timothy Yeo, and Lord
Caithness. All of these men had one thing in common; they were (and
remain, sadly) as sexy as a lamp-post. Trevor Eve, on the other hand,
cuts a dashing figure with his rugged good looks.
Still, he plays the part of weasel uncomfortably well. Here we have a
prize shit. A hypocrite of immense proportion. A two-faced politician
(tautology, surely) with no conscience but a great instinct for
ministerial survival. In The Politician's Wife, writer Paula Milne
doesn't miss and hit the wall. She could have softened the blow; set her
drama ''sometime in the future'', made Mr Eve an MP from an unnamed
political party.
But she didn't. This is now. And it's the Conservatives with no hint
of dubiety. The Politician's Wife is a compelling (and at times quite
steamy) study of long-term political power and how it can morally
corrupt those who hold it. It examines the mendacity behind the public
image of the politician. It is also a delicious tale of a woman's
revenge against the infidelity of her husband. The excellent Juliet
Stevenson delivers a wonderfully subdued and utterly convincing
performance as the wife in search of retribution.
Duncan Matlock (Eve), a ruthlessly ambitious and self-assured
politician, is Minister for the Family. His high-flying ambitions take a
dent when the press expose the scandal of his affair with a former
escort girl turned ''political researcher''. It is damage-limitation
time as his adultery threatens to embarrass the Conservative Party.
Then the cynical, sly, Matlock goes for the sympathy vote. He made a
very human mistake, he tells the party and the public. He was an old
fool who fell for a beautiful temptress. He lays his heart on his gold
cuff-linked sleeve and begs forgiveness. And forgiveness (not to mention
political survival) he'll get just so long as his faithful upper-class
wife stands by him.
Flora Matlock (Stevenson) is a Tory woman steeped in the politics of
the Shires. Her rich father is big in the party and she's spent her
entire married life dutifully supporting her husband. The party
spin-doctors persuade her to forgive and forget Duncan's betrayal. Cut
to the familiar picture of compromised Tory minister playing Happy
Families. With his arms around his wife and weans, he attempts to put
the whole affair behind him.
And there the high drama would rest were it not for the fact that
Flora discovers a series of audio tapes, recording the erotic
conversations between her husband and his mistress. In them she
discovers that the affair was no passing fling; it was a passionate,
sexually rampant, long-term relationship; a systematic betrayal of her
marriage. Flora then sets out to exact a bitter sweet revenge upon her
husband -- striking at his career, the spot where it will hurt him most.
Paula Milne came to write the series because she was intrigued by the
fact that so many politicians' wives stick with their husbands after the
public humiliation of a sex scandal. It is, she suggests, because they
often have an allegiance, not only to the stability of the family and
the children, but also the survival of the political party. But why, if
it is not a somewhat academic question, home in on the Tories?
''Well, they've been in power for a very long time. They come from
this cloistered atmosphere of the public school and then they go to
university and on to some job in the City before they become MPs. All
along there is this institutionalised order to their lives which needs
some release. They're so out of touch with certain aspects of life which
most of us have to face,'' she says.
Speaking to both Eve and Stevenson, the impression that is left is,
well, Left. There is clearly no great love lost between the two actors
and the Tory party. What did Eve, the former Shoestring who is now more
renowned for playing the role of scoundrel (witness Andrea Newman's A
Sense of Guilt) think of his character in The Politician's Wife?
''Now that it's over I dislike him but while I was doing it I had to
find things in him which propelled him through his life. You have to
like the person you play. Mind you, this was a tough one to like.
''You don't approach him as a rotter because he doesn't think he is.
And his presentation to the public doesn't show him as such, so it's
important to present him as he is in reality -- cynical and treacherous
behind the public face,'' he says.
Stevenson was similarly unimpressed by her character. Does she think
that women would associate with Flora?
''It depends on their history. If women have had that kind of
experience then I guess they will. I have almost no feelings about these
people (the two principal characters) at all. I'm not a great lover of
the Tory party but to some extent if you are committed to that kind of
public life then, sooner or later, something of this nature is likely to
trip you up. I'm capable of feeling slightly sorry for this woman
because of that mask between the politics and the personal.
''She is at her most vulnerable when she discovers that her marriage
was not what it was. She also becomes more powerful if she stands by her
man; powerful in the sense that she can shape the future. But she also
becomes fantastically manipulative. She has always had this deep
political commitment, which she inherited, and she has never had to
question that before. But now she does,'' she explains.
The actress was drawn to the role because the drama took a well-known
public story and delved behind it. There is, she says, a public edifice
and, if you look beyond it, you get some private access.
There is nothing new about sexual scandal involving MPs; Lloyd George,
for instance, was famously known to be as randy as a goat. But what is
new, in relative terms at least, is the often prurient tabloid publicity
which such matters now attract. In The Politician's Wife, the press is
described by the Tory party chairman (Ian Bannen in sparkling form) as
''a species with all the sensitivity of a kerbstone''.
But there is a deliberately misguided belief, running through the
narrative of The Politician's Wife, which is constantly repeated by the
Tory party machine. And it is that senior politicians like Matlock,
makers of history, are exempt from the normal course of life and that
they are morally justified in covering up the truth of their
indiscretions. They are not, of course. They do so simply to cling on to
power.
* The Politician's Wife starts on Channel Four on Tuesday, May 16.

A SHETLAND councillor died when senior doctors failed to give adequate
support to junior staff after a routine gallstone operation went wrong,
a fatal accident inquiry at Lerwick Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
Councillor Alex Arthur, 68, died after a second operation on his gall
bladder failed to save his life.
The court heard that consultant surgeon Mr John Parkin performed a
keyhole operation on Mr Arthur on the afternoon of May 9, 1993.
Nurse Claire Heath, in charge of Ward 1 at Gilbert Bain Hospital, said
Mr Arthur started losing significant amounts of blood from the wound and
his blood pressure was falling.
Mr Parkin was phoned at home, and one and a half hours later he came
in to see the patient. According to Nurse Heath the junior doctor
expressed concern to Mr Parkin about the loss of blood. ''I heard him
say: 'Panic not. That's what drains are for','' she said.
''We all knew by this point this was not a normal recovery from
surgery.''
Later Mr Parkin performed a second operation during which Mr Arthur
died. Pathologist James Grieve said he had haemorrhaged after his gall
bladder became detached from his liver. He could not say when or how
this had happened.
Nurse Heath wrote up a report immediately after Mr Arthur's death.
When the procurator-fiscal, Mr Keith Adam, asked her why, she said: ''I
felt very strongly that something had gone wrong that evening. It was
not normal for someone to have planned surgery and for them to die
within 12 hours.
''As far as I am concerned the junior house doctor was not receiving
the support she needed from her senior house officer and in turn from Mr
Parkin. It was a very distressing evening.''
The fatal accident inquiry continues.

NATIONAL issues were to the fore in last week's local government
elections in England and Wales despite the best efforts of the Tories to
try to get the electorate to focus on local ones. However that does not
detract from the fact that people still want good, efficient local
services provided for as little money as possible.
The Tory Party's belief that private is invariably better than public
has in fact often led to a deterioration in service. That is plain to
see in the increasing commercialisation of the National Health Service
and will be even more apparent when the railways are privatised.
However, one area in which the Tories have been proved to be right is in
the effective privatisation of local government services through
compulsory competitive tendering (CCT).
Traditionally local authorities supplied their own direct labour
force, land, buildings, and machinery to provide blue-collar services
such as refuse collection and street cleaning, building cleaning, school
and welfare catering services, vehicle maintenance, and leisure
facilities. In many cases these services are now provided by private
companies.
The introduction of CCT obliged authorities to specify quality levels
and to implement independent monitoring. Although few local authorities
have demanded higher standards in their service specifications for
contracts, the possibility of private companies winning such contracts
has in many cases, including in my own Labour-controlled local
authority, galvanised the local council into ensuring that its services
are more customer friendly and efficient. In the past many authorities
regarded the provision of local services as a benefit for their staff
rather than the local taxpayers.
CCT has been particularly noticeable in refuse collection and road
sweeping. As these are two of the council-provided services that I use,
I take a particular interest in how good they are. Although the
quarterly community skip and monthly supply of free refuse sacks have
been scrapped as part of a cost-cutting exercise, the service is still
good.
However, one outcome of CCT in general that does concern me is that it
appears to be having an adverse effect on the advancement of equal
opportunities in local government. Research into the gender impact of
CCT in local government by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC)
suggests that women's terms and conditions of employment have suffered.
Analysis of 39 local authority case studies in England, Scotland, and
Wales between September 1993 and March 1994, showed pay rates did not
increase in the predominantly female catering and cleaning services, and
in some cases they declined. This was particularly so for part-time
workers. By contrast, in the predominantly male refuse collection
service pay levels increased during the first round of tendering.
In addition, job creation appears to have suffered in the CCT process
as costs have been cut. Contracting out has boosted the number of
full-time non-manual jobs, such as support staff employed by local
authorities (Direct Service Organisations, or DSOs), and staff
responsible for monitoring contract performance. But according to
research from the Department of the Environment, these are more than
offset by job losses associated with contracting out.
The EOC report says a two-tier workforce has become prevalent within
local authorities, driven by a combination of economic pressures and
CCT. Existing differences between permanent and casual work, between
full-time and part-time jobs, and between male and female employment
have been accentuated. Attempts to tackle this worrying situation could
include an equal opportunities stipulation by local authorities in the
awarding of any contracts and careful monitoring of the implementation
of equal opportunity policies. In addition, some form of undertaking
could be given to honour previous terms and conditions where they are
better than those of the incoming service provider.
There have been problems with particular contracts. Some contractors
have proved unable to meet required service standards, have withdrawn
from contracts, and have even gone bankrupt. However some problems are
inevitable given the scale of the CCT exercise nationwide.
On balance it strikes me that the principle of CCT is the right one
given that the provision of many local services is effectively a
monopoly. It is only the prospect of possibly losing a contract that
will keep service providers on their toes and mindful of the needs of
local taxpayers. So far CCT has been concentrated in blue-collar local
government services. However there would appear to be scope to transfer
it to white-collar activities which are currently done by local
government departments.
In areas such as urban planning, legal and computer services there is
no natural monopoly on expertise in the public sector. Indeed in the
case of computing it is arguably in the private sector that many of the
most up-to-date computer staff will be found, reflecting their greater
exposure to new software packages and systems.
As the debate over public service provision versus lower taxes hots up
ahead of the General Election, local authorities could find CCT working
in their favour. The deliverance of better quality local services could
translate into positive votes for the incumbent council. But the rights
of workers, particularly part-time women, must not be ignored in the
process.

AN INNOCENT man was left with horrific injuries and permanent brain
damage after a vigilante attack, a court was told yesterday.
One of the men who inflicted summary justice on 39-year-old Mr Raymond
Hunt was jailed for eight years for the frenzied attack.
Stephen White, 25, admitted kicking, stamping and jumping on the head
of Mr Hunt at the victim's home in Trondheim Parkway, Dunfermline, on
August 21 last year, to his severe injury, permanent disablement and the
danger of his life. Moments after the first attack, he dropped a TV set
on the head of his unconscious victim.
Mr Hunt suffered multiple fractures to his skull, smashed facial
bones, and broken ribs in the attack. He is still in hospital, and
doctors have said there is no hope of any real improvement in his
condition.
White, of Boreland Road, Inverkeithing, Fife, had originally faced two
charges of attempting to murder Mr Hunt, but the Crown accepted his plea
to the less serious charges.
Mr James Campbell, QC, Advocate-depute, told Lord MacLean at the High
Court in Edinburgh that a totally unfounded allegation had been made
that Mr Hunt was a rapist.
White, Michael Wilson, 24, and David McIntyre, 19, went to Mr Hunt's
flat about 2am. They kicked in the door and Mr Hunt was knocked down
before White launched a frenzied attack.
McIntyre left the flat, and Wilson realised that things had gone too
far.
White took a TV set from Mr Hunt's home to a neighbouring flat, but
was told to take it back. He took the set back and dropped it on Mr
Hunt's head.
Defence counsel Ms Frances McMenamin said White had drunk half a
bottle of vodka, 10 cans of lager and whisky before the assault. She
added: ''He had never met Mr Hunt in his life.''
Lord MacLean told White: ''You completely lost the place. As a result,
Mr Hunt is now in a vegetative state with, plainly, a limited
lifespan.''
The judge deferred sentence for reports on Wilson, of Trondheim
Parkway and McIntyre, of Law Road, both Dunfermline, after they admitted
assaulting Mr White by knocking him down and punching him.

HAVING enjoyed the melodrama, we know now that Tony Blair is afraid
neither of Tories nor trade unions. With a dexterity granted to few, he
wads paper tigers into little balls and tosses them into history's
dustbin. The past holds no fears for the Labour leader. What does the
future do to his courage? Blair slays dragons -- every one of his loyal
squires says so -- but hitherto they have been dragons of his choosing.
The leader picks fights carefully, playing only to win. For that reason,
perhaps, he has had nothing very interesting to say about media
ownership.
This is odd, for reasons that are far from new. For decades Labour has
endured coverage both hostile and dishonest from the bulk of the British
press, like a runner facing a marathon with a stone in his shoe. Blair
may have acquired fans among maverick Tory journalists lately, but he
knows that when a General Election campaign begins it will be business
as usual: lies, smears, and hysteria.
Yet Labour seems reluctant, all of a sudden, to question the
concentration of media power. Once it promised to bring barons to heel;
now it wants only to level the battle field. At best, we hear, Labour
would reform cross-ownership rules, meaning that one Australian/American
would be joined in the arena by a few other suits who think, speak, and
behave exactly as he does.
There are echoes here of Labour's economic policies. The party
modernisers tell us governments can no longer act alone, that
multi-nationals and the markets they inhabit cannot be influenced by any
one country. Now, while Rupert Murdoch makes pleasant noises about their
leader, they seem to accept that the media, the globalised information
industries fast penetrating every aspect of life, are also outside their
remit.
A pity, really. After all, it was David Mellor, of all people, who
noted recently that anyone who wants to achieve true international power
these days shouldn't bother with politics but take a leaf from Murdoch's
book. It isn't hard to see why.
This week Rupert's emissaries were in Milan to negotiate, like
imperial legates, with Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest, the company that
controls the largest part of Italy's media. According to Variety, a
publication that tends to know about such things, Murdoch is interested
in acquiring all three of Berlusconi's TV networks and his vast
advertising operation, Pubbitalia.
If it comes off, it will be a huge deal. The Forza boss, in debt and
under pressure to divest himself of the instruments he used to engineer
his election last year, needs to sell. Italy is to hold a referendum in
June and one question will propose that any single individual or company
be forbidden from owning more than one network. Berlusconi is playing a
weak hand.
Step forward Uncle Rupert: he'd like all three networks but might
settle for two, one to keep and one in which to retain a stake. In the
process Berlusconi would get some desperately needed cash -- and a
chance to improve his tarnished image.
You might ask what this has to do with Tony Blair. The answer is
nothing and everything. Nothing because Italy is not Britain; everything
because, in this, Blair's people resemble politicians the world over.
They all fear Uncle Rupert and they all make the same arguments about
the threat he poses. In the end, though, they all allow him his way.
In Italy, Murdoch is poised to replicate a pattern. He owns 30% of the
British press, a publishing business, and the largest part of a
satellite network. In Australia he owns three-quarters of the press and
his satellite footprint is stamped across Asia.
In the US he controls the fourth TV network, big city papers, a film
studio, and more besides. South America and Eastern Europe are on his
schedule. Meanwhile, he has launched himself on to the information
superhighway.
It is global domination by any other name. Where once war was
diplomacy by other means, the media are now politics in a new guise.
Laughing at the Sun, fretting over rugby league, or wondering what
Murdoch was up to with his joke bid for Channel 5, it is easy to lose
sight of what is going on.
If there's one commodity whose value will increase exponentially as
the 21st century dawns, it is information. The millions hooking up to
satellite, cable, and the Internet each month are proof enough of that.
The rich mixture of news, entertainment, communications, and technology
is creating its own vast, expanding market. If actions speak louder than
words, Murdoch is saying he wants to own most of it.
Yet this industry is different from other global enterprises.
Burgers shape few opinions; cars don't influence elections; oil wells
don't censor news, break politicians, or turn entire societies into
captive subscribers. The media moguls do that.
Equally, this isn't a quaint terror from the dark ages of socialism;
this is as modern as it gets. We should be told exactly what Mr Blair
thinks. Otherwise Labour's champion might be accused of tilting at
windmills.

THERE are fewer slaughterhouses than there were back in the good old
pre-Euro-conformity days, but one suspects that the expression on the
faces of those fated-to-be-fodder beasts has not changed one whit.
There is the look of surprise, a certain bovine fear, dull suspicion,
a wish to be somewhere else entirely.
Such is the look on the face of the politician's wife when she is
dragged out before those arbiters of public propriety to bolster her
husband's flagging esteem.
He's been caught, yet she's the sacrifice. He's been nabbed with his
trousers down, so to speak, yet she's the one stripped of her dignity in
the public glare. It has become a sign of our times, a strange, haunting
ceremony, a slow waltz of lie and cheat, cheat and lie. The politician's
wife is the one who most often bears the brunt; stoic, eyes bright with
held-back tears while he grins and grits his teeth, knowing that a week
is often a long time in politics and someone else's gaffe must soon
shade his own, especially if he's Conservative.
In recent times, the politician's wife has increasingly been hauled
from obscurity to stand cuckolded in every living-room in the country.
Who knew Judith Mellor? Who had ever heard of her first name?
Then came Antonia de Sancha, an actress by repute, romps in a Chelsea
strip, strips in a London flat, odd little pedestrian games. From Toe
Job to No Job, screamed one banner headline, and David Mellor's
gap-toothed, myopic picture was on every screen, for a while at least.
Prior to the no-job, but certainly after the other, the little lady
had been paraded in a poignant and subsequently futile show of
solidarity with her dearly beloved, her elbow cleeked on his, bravely
smiling. He still lost his job, then his wife.
One got the impression that she might have forgiven him his
middle-aged romp with an alleged actress but the sheer embarrassment,
the shame of being paraded as his sacrificial lamb on the altar of the
media's morality seemed more than she could bear. The Rt Hon David
proved to be neither right nor honourable in this instance.
The sham, of course, was revealed to those of a credulous disposition
when he toddled off with the new and classy Viscountess Cobham, smiling
once again for the cameras. The politician's wife had been dumped on
once, twice and once again. She is not the only one.
It seems, but is not quite, a purely British trait to seek absolute
moral superiority from our politicians. It has always seemed to this
writer to be rather a contradiction in terms. To be a politician, one
has to have a remorseless drive, an incandescent ambition, a greed and a
need for power. You have to be devious, able to compromise dearly-held
principle, dish the dirt. To expect such qualities and abilities not to
pervade a politician's life is to be naive.
The British expect them to be whiter than white and when they turn out
to be clay coloured in the foot department, fingers point, then wag. And
then the dear wronged lady is brought out as his pillar, only to be
pilloried instead.
Paddy Ashdown was different. He was a gentleman about not being a
gentleman. Hands up, game's a bogey, mea culpa. He confessed first, said
he was sorry, promised not to do it again and appealed to party and
public on the grounds of being a little bit of a sinner, but not that
much. Good tactic.
Yet the Lib Dem leader's biggest iniquity, if we have to be moral at
all, is not in the infidelity. Every tabloid, and not a few of the
quality press, lists regular statistics which prove beyond doubt man's
incapability of being faithful. We're a bad lot, but we're not all
politicians. Paddy's wife Jane stood by him. She faced the cameras, made
the statement even though it sounded as if the words stuck in her craw.
But only she can tell how it feels to live with a man known now as Paddy
Pantsdown.
The politician's wife may have to be a saint, as well as a martyr.
Take Lady Ann Parkinson. In the days before everything governmental
seemed to melt down into a cauldron of sleaze, the Brylcreem boy almost
kept his job, despite his sins.
He did not reckon with the redoubtable Sarah Keays, the woman scorned
and left holding the baby. Worse, she was left holding a disabled baby
who needed much care and attention and the Right Honourable Cecil seemed
a reluctant helpmate.
Poor Ann Parkinson has had a number of years to watch this drama roll
on and on, probably cringing with every new episode: Parkinson -- Fatal
Attraction; Parkinson -- The Name of the Father, Parkinson -- The Early
Years.
Purgatory done, penance over, Parky tholed his assize. He's now a peer
of the realm, lording it over us, gone on to sin no more, one assumes.
In France, until recently, a politician's declaration never to have
been unfaithful might have provoked headlines and possibly even loss of
office. They have an understanding about the drives, the needs, the
motivation, those Frenchies. Things are changing now, however, because
of the incessant need to know.
Daniele Mitterrand stands by her husband's side, supporting him in his
illness. More than 20 years ago, at the age of 57, his affair with
museum curator Anne Pingeot resulted in a daughter, Mazarine.
With typical Gallic aplomb he has carried on his liaison over the past
two decades while the whole establishment looked on. Now almost eighty,
at the end of his presidency and in poor health, he still keeps in touch
with mistress and daughter who enjoy accommodation normally reserved for
senior officials.
Daniele Mitterrand, however, has publicly stood by her Monsieur
President, because that's her job.
The politician's wife, it seems, has it rougher than most because of
the immediate attention focused upon the innocent; the wife, the kids,
fed to the beasts for the sake of a career. That's the British way.
Norma Major, on the other hand, need have no worries on that score.
Her husband was once reputed to have had a scenario with a catering
lady, a completely false accusation as it turned out. Norma can rest on
her laurels, knowing the Prime Minister is a man of fidelity and that
she will never have to stand at his side, blinking in the merciless
flashes, helping him cling to his career.
Stands to reason, though. He just doesn't look as if he's got the
smeddum, does he? It could be that the revelation of casting an unlawful
leg is the one thing that could possibly assist the quailing resident of
No 10. If he's hanging on by the fingertips, we can be sure that it's
politics, and not sex, that's responsible. Norma can sleep easily. But
can the rest of us?
This is not about infidelity, for human males, no matter their
posturing, are genetically primed to take all evolutionary advantage.
Fidelity has never been a winner in that race.
This is not even about politicians because we have come to expect them
to be sleekit and two-faced.
It's about the woman, his other half, even his better half. The
long-suffering politician's wife has put up with his latecomings and his
non-arrivals. She has backed him every step of the way and then when
she's let down badly and in public, she sets herself up to take his
flak, going above and beyond the call of duty. That must be the most
difficult job, facing the hungry cameras and pretending that all is well
when clearly it is not.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if just once, a Judith or a Jane or an Ann,
faced with a barrage of paparazzi at the front door, came storming down
the garden path after publicly giving him a swift knee in the privy
seal, leaving him gasping for breath and unable to dally for several
days. Wouldn't it be wonderful if she came out with a mouthful of
expletives, told them what a rat he was and then advised every voter in
the constituency to put a cross forthwith in his rival's box.
Much better that than the slaughterhouse look of a woman who in all
innocence is made to pay the price for his public position.

TWO women failed to secure a job as a women's equal opportunity
officer because they did not meet the criteria for the position, an
industrial tribunal was told yesterday.
Ms Neelam Bakshi and Ms Pramila Kaur are claiming at the Edinburgh
tribunal that their failure to get on the short-leet for the post with
Falkirk District Council was a case of racial discrimination and are
seeking compensation.
Ms Bakshi is a member of an industrial tribunal panel in Glasgow and
representative of Glasgow Summerston Ward for Strathclyde Region.
She has made it through to the final of the Scotwoman of the Year
contest run by the Evening Times newspaper.
Thirty-eight people applied for the officer's job and seven women
eventually made it to the short-leet -- all white.
Mr Bernard McCallum, Falkirk's assistant director of personnel, said
yesterday that any suggestion racial discrimination was involved was
totally untrue.
Ms Bakshi and Ms Kaur, he said, failed to make the short-leet because,
in his opinion, they did not meet the essential criteria for the
position.
He said the authority was looking for someone with an education up to
degree standard or the equivalent, with managerial ability, maturity,
and expertise in an equal opportunities work situation.
Ms Bakshi, he said, had the educational qualifications and strong
inter-personal skills, but she did not have the relevant work
experience.
He said Ms Kaur did not meet the educational or work criteria.
Mr McCallum pointed out that the first holder of the position had been
a person of Chinese origin.
Mr McCallum's evidence lasted the whole day and the tribunal was
adjourned until July 4.

SCOTLAND'S governing body for angling has recommended that all anglers
stop hunting sea trout in areas where stocks are threatened.
Such a moratorium would cover almost the entire west coast from the
lower Clyde to Cape Wrath, according to the 35,000-strong Scottish
Anglers National Association (Sana).
It also wants the immediate removal of all salmon farms within 20
kilometres of river systems which have migratory fish -- and a ban on
extending salmon farming into pristine coastal waters where sea trout
populations appear normal.
Sana blames collapses in sea trout populations on infestations of sea
lice after feeding near salmon cages. The evidence is circumstantial,
but bans on salmon farming near sea trout rivers have already been
adopted in Iceland, Norway, and parts of Ireland.
The association issued a policy statement yesterday after concerns
that a working party aimed at setting up West Highland salmon and sea
trout trusts had failed to address the sea lice issue. Sana spokesman
Matt Walker said: ''We cannot stand by and watch a vital part of
Scottish heritage sacrificed on the altar of commercial farming.''
0 The policy document, lodged with the Scottish Office, also
recommends ''the immediate cessation of all fishing of threatened sea
trout stocks by both nets and rods''.
It welcomes the creation of West Highland sea trout and salmon trusts,
which Sana and the Salmon and Trout Association believe will help
relieve pressures ''exerted on the fragile environment of the west
coast''.
The Salmon Growers' Association, which represents fish farmers,
declined to comment yesterday.

THERE is a lesson to be learned, even for the mass of
non-rugby-playing Scots, from the Will Carling affair. A sporting hero
disgruntled with the status quo, confident that immunity came from
popular support, he spoke out rashly and was kicked into touch. A
banquet of humble pie later and he is once more back in play, but the
message today for the Will Carlings of this world, indeed for us all --
as in the 1930s Chicago of Al Capone, the French village of Oradeur in
the summer of 1944 -- is clear: Don't Mess with the Mob.
Will Carling possibly still thinks rugby union's hierachy is a
collection of flatulent old buffers, that he was right to tell the world
so and at no risk to himself -- just as goons with ambition may have
believed they could, with impunity, open a bootleg enterprise to rival
that of the pudgy wee guy in the pearl grey fedora; the French Maquis
might, just, have imagined that they could harass German armour racing
to stem the D-Day invaders, without bringing down a tempest of brutality
on the innocent.
But they were all wrong. Carling, temporarily, got his jotters from
the 57 old farts, Capone's hoods used Thompson guns to reinforce the
message that the Prohibition hooch was a monopoly affair, and German
soldiers raised the village of Oradeur sur Glane and slaughtered the
population without so much as a blink. Befehl ist befehl -- orders are
orders -- they said later in court, but the true message of their
murderous rampage is that authority will brook no challenge. The French
neatly catch the mood with their saying ''pour encourager les autres''.
In a land now cluttered with government charters to ease this pain and
guarantee that recompense, the summary sacking of Will Carling as
captain of the England rugby squad came as a timely reminder of the real
world and how it wags. In rugby, as in life, ground rules obtain and
Carling's Folly -- as it may come to be known -- was to forget the way
they work. Let me explain how the system functions.
First, the role of the court jester, an important one for he -- or she
-- alone is licensed by authority to speak the public mind,
outrageously, in public, providing feed-back to authority of the way the
wind is blowing. Court jesters, thus, are an institution in their own
right -- beloved by those they speak for and marvelled at for their
daring, tolerated and kept in place by authority for their value as a
safety valve and an intelligence source. In contrast to their great use
and considerable privilege, court jesters are near the bottom of the
status league in whichever organisation they operate -- happy with their
Jack-the-Lad role and status as a protected species but never, even in
an entire season of RFU U-turn, a prospective challenge to the powers
that be.
Next we come to individual complainer in the ranks, let us say someone
who fills the role of a ''B'' team prop-forward in the great game of
life . . . no injury time here. Should he speak up loud and out of turn
he can safely be ignored, for it is beneath the dignity of authority to
concede a challenge from any quarter not within its own immediate
sphere.
If our complainer persists then possibly he will be pulled up for
insubordination, a charge much used in the Army -- an organisation run
by old gents prone to explosion, an institution where two insubordinates
make a mutiny which is dealt with accordingly -- quick drama, instant
disgrace, immediate dismissal.
What is an absolute racing certainty is that anyone near the top of
the heap -- let us say the captain of an ''A'' team hoping to win a cup
-- who opens his mouth to criticise the chief and his 56 windy
lieutenants can expect a metaphoric pill in the head. Old farts with the
power to blow off will undoubtedly raise a stink like the old farts they
are.
The wonder is that Will Carling did what he did, so readily fell
victim to the wooing of the fans and a belief in his invulnerability.
Did he not know that tomorrow's yesterday's men are made up from teams
of today's heroes?
In may seem odd in these allegedly egalitarian times, when all are
urged to do their own thing, that so many bodies in Britain still hold
the power to squash free speech and criticism. As Carling's narrow
squeak demonstrates, the power is with those elderly gents whose glory
days were not yesterday nor the day before. Antiquity notwithstanding,
when it comes to a scrum they are full of beans.

<HEADLINE>Majority expected to borrow now, pay back later. Student loans at a record #500m</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>BARCLAY MCBAIN, EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

MORE than half of Britain's higher education students are expected to
have taken out a maintenance loan by the end of the present academic
session, with #500m already handed out.
The landmark will confirm the growing acceptance of the Government's
student loans scheme, which is based in Glasgow.
There is also to be a new system for renewing loans to prevent a
recurrence of last year's pay-out delays for many.
There was widespread opposition to the establishment of the Student
Loans Company five years ago, and its image reached a new low recently
with the dismissal of former chief executive Ron Harrison.
However, the company has become more responsive to the needs of
students and HE institutions, and more open in its dealings. It is also
confident the results of an investigation headed by the Department for
Education into allegations of expenses irregularities -- described as
largely ''sheer fluff'' -- will not dent its image.
A separate National Audit Office inquiry to establish if the company
is providing value for money is under way in its Glasgow headquarters.
It is not likely to be considered by MPs on the Commons Public Accounts
Committee before November.
Sir Eric Ash, the academic appointed to run the company on a part-time
basis after Mr Harrison's sacking, said of the company: ''It was a very
successful enterprise and it will be again.''
About 450,000 loans have been paid out to students at an average of
#1075 per student, giving an outlay of nearly #500m.
The company estimates there will be about 520,000 loans by the end of
the session, representing 56% of the 980,000 students in the UK. The
proportion is expected to rise to 65% next year.
The company at present recoups nearly 95% of debt and does not expect
the proportion to fall as the amount students borrow rises.
The Government's policy is to shift more of the maintenance burden on
to students by equalising grants and student loans by 1997. A company
source commented: ''Although the present declared policy is a 50/50
split most people would guess that over the next few years, and probably
irrespective of which party is in power, loans will take over from
grants.''
Although the Government would like to take student loans out of the
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement there is little prospect of the
company being privatised.
Pressure on the public purse also explains why postgraduate students
-- who account for an increasing part of the student body -- remain
excluded from the scheme. Sir Eric said he would like postgraduates to
be able to benefit from loans, perhaps involving them paying real
interest rates on sums borrowed. Loans for undergraduates are only
index-linked to inflation.
Sir Eric agrees with higher education chiefs who have argued that the
present repayment system -- triggered when graduates earn #14,600, 85%
of national earnings -- is unfair.
''The company started with a simple criterion and in my opinion it
does need improving,'' he said. He believes that the more former
borrowers earn, the more they should repay over shorter periods, but
also thinks that a graduate earning #12,000 for example should be asked
to start repaying at a lower level.
Agreement has been reached on a simplified system for renewing loans
for existing borrowers. Last year thousands suffered hardship because
they did not receive their loans until the New Year.
The system worked for the 65% of forms which went to home addresses
and this year simplified forms will be sent to all students' homes in
June. The company hopes many students will return the forms during the
summer, in the understanding that this in itself does not commit them to
taking a loan.
As a back-up, they will be able to pick up application forms at
college or university and the company will send loans to the addresses
at which students are living. There will also be free-phone lines for
student inquiries.

POLICE warned mothers to be on the alert last night after a bogus
health visitor tried to get into a house containing a five-month-old
baby.
The woman told the mother that she was calling to see her son. She was
able to give the name of the registered health visitor and wore an
identity badge.
The badge did not have a logo, but had ''health visitor'' and
''Lillian'' written on it.
But the boy's mother did not let the woman into her house in Brechin,
Angus. Tayside Police are investigating the incident, which took place
at 1.15pm on Tuesday.
Inspector Mark Watson said: ''Mothers should be on their guard and
make sure of identification. If there is any doubt whatsoever, they
should not let the person into their house and should contact the
authorities.''
Police, who are not naming the mother, described the bogus health
visitor as 5ft 5in tall and of slim build with short, black, curly hair.
She was in her late 30s and was wearing a grey skirt and jacket and a
white blouse.

A GROUP of businessmen with the potential to inject millions of pounds
into the Scottish economy arrived in Ayrshire yesterday.
They had travelled from different parts of England at the invitation
of Engineering Ayrshire, a group of local firms formed to promote
business in an area better known for Burns and golf than for its
manufacturing industries.
The group was set up last year and at the time was seen as an
innovation in business as it was striving to break down traditional
barriers and rivalries in an industry once fraught with jealousy.
In Troon yesterday, the 12 buyers from a range of companies met
potential suppliers, then toured their factories to discuss their
requirements.
One buyer candidly admitted: ''I had never associated this part of
Scotland with engineering and manufacturing until I was contacted.''
Mr Andrew Nixon, operations development manager for Longwall, a
company which turns over #85m a year in making hydraulic supports for
the mining industry, said: ''I can remember when we had customers in the
Ayrshire coalfield but, quite frankly, I had never looked on Ayrshire as
a potential source of products for our company.
''I had been looking around Eastern Europe for the kind of parts we
need for building and structural work when I was contacted by
Engineering Ayrshire and sent their source book which lists the member
companies and the products and services they have to offer.''
He added: ''The potential orders in this particular series of
contracts is in excess of #3m and if things work out I would hope that
some of this will come to Ayrshire.
''I certainly like what I have seen so far.''
Mr Nixon said he was not aware of any similar partnership in the UK.
Mr Alan Macdonald, marketing director of Ailsa-Perth Shipbuilders in
Troon and chairman of Engineering Ayrshire's steering group, said:
''From our launch last autumn to date we have seen the number of
companies involved in the group rise to 50 and the order books of member
companies boosted by around #500,000.
''That is a great start and something on which we plan to build.''

TARZAN'S joints may creak a little now as he swings through the trees
-- or rises from the Treasury Bench to the despatch box -- but he still
looks capable of mixing it with any of the few big beasts left in the
Westminster jungle.
Not that any really big ones crossed his path yesterday, only Dr Jack
Cunningham, his Shadow, who appears to have mastered the difficult art
of the rambling soundbite.
The main attraction was watching the man to whom the Tories may yet
turn to get more than 200 of them back into the next Parliament pour
scorn on Opposition policies or claims, like a man born to be a party
leader -- then relapse into almost monastic rectitude when a subject was
raised which stirs internal differences within the party, which he
always says is not planning to change its leader.
Thus, when Mr David Knox (Staffordshire Moorlands -- Con.) -- than
whom Tories come no damper -- sang out in praise of stable exchange
rates with the sub text ''please re-enter the ERM'', Mr Heseltine, whose
inclinations probably lean the same way -- but who is well aware that
those of a large chunk of the electoral college do not -- observed
judiciously that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had this matter ''in
the forefront of his mind'' and sat down.
He cunningly incited Mr Dennis Skinner (Bolsover -- Lab.) to repeat
his allegation of the previous day about a ''crooked deal'' in
connection with the privatisation of the coal industry.
Mr Skinner was duly suspended for a day by the Speaker for refusing to
retract. Tarzan was well aware that one vote was definitely worth
disposing of, with some of his colleagues of a mind to join the
Opposition in crucifying Mrs Virginia Bottomley later in the day.
But Mr Skinner, if hardly a great beast, has been around the jungle a
long time. Though anything that annoys the National Union of Mineworkers
annoys him, he kept his cool sufficiently to call for an investigation
into the deal, thus avoiding being asked to leave for the second day
running.
For most of the rest of the time DTI questions were the usual thing of
Opposition MPs quoting unfavourable trade statistics and Ministers
replying with favourable ones. The Sketch didn't bother to keep score.
There was a moment of rare modesty from Mr David Amess (Basildon --
Con.), who praised a firm in his constituency for making ''the finest
plugs in the world''. Until then, one rather thought that Mr Amess held
the title himself as he plugs his constituency even more incessantly
than any other MP, never asking a question or making a speech without
mentioning its name.
This is perhaps getting on the constituency's nerves and at last
week's local elections it returned a Labour council.
What Mr Amess may have done for Basildon, Mrs Bottomley undoubtedly
did for her London colleagues. At the end of a long, disorganised and
unconvincing speech in defence of her NHS reforms in the capital, she
had clearly failed to save herself and would have to rely on the unity
imperative if the Government was to avoid a rebellion and defeat.
Several London back benchers could be seen swallowing hard.

Conference report
THE Scottish Tory conference spoke with actions more than words
yesterday, hedging around its concerns for the future of the party from
the podium and then voting with its feet -- standing to applaud
right-wingers Michael Portillo and Michael Forsyth.
In contrast, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke was given a muted few bursts of
applause and no ovation, while most speakers seemed content to churn
through the middle ground of Majorism and trust to the traditional
values of loyalty.
Party president David McLetchie admitted: ''We've taken a pasting in
the last three rounds of the electoral contest over the past year but
the bell is now ringing again and we have to come out fighting.''
Scottish Conservatives, he said, had been through a longer period of
self-reflection than those in the South and had conceded that they had
''lost the confidence and trust of a significant number of people in the
key groups who form our natural constituency.''
One of those whose confidence and trust had clearly been lost was
Monklands East chairman John Love, who spoke of the saboteurs at work in
Tory Central Office in London.
''We can't hide,'' he told delegates, referring to the party's current
standing in Scotland.
He claimed that only outside saboteurs would have dreamed up a policy
of VAT on domestic fuel and allowed it to be inflicted over a prolonged
period on old people, or advised the Chancellor to carry out changes
which would have threatened the very people who had been encouraged by
the Conservatives to become home-owners.
However, most Tories tempered their criticism of party policy, not
least Scottish Tory Reform Group chairman Arthur Bell.
His scorn was directed mainly at local environmental health officials
in Clydesdale -- he regretted only that he could not repeat his crime of
publicly eating Lanarkshire Blue cheese on the platform yesterday -- and
at Labour's lack of an economic policy.
Mr Bell drew laughs and applause for depicting this as something that
could be drawn on the back of a postage stamp, a stagnant, defeated,
moribund and dead economy.
Edinburgh Central delegate Malcolm Cameron also sent a warning shot
across the bow of his party's economic policy, saying that stupid
economic policy resulting in lost jobs and repossessed homes lay behind
the catastrophe of last month's local election results.
A similar note was sounded by Councillor Pam Paterson of Kyle and
Carrick, who said that as someone rejected by the electorate in last
month's elections she felt she had the right to enter the debate.
She felt the party had let down voters on promises of low taxation,
particularly VAT on fuel, on home ownership, and on family values, with
the cut in the allowance for married couples.
As she laid out this effective request for a change of direction in
Scottish party policy, it was noticeable that Scottish Office Minister
Sir Hector Monro applauded enthusiastically.
However, for all the rumblings of one-nation Toryism to be found in
Glasgow yesterday, the sentiments rarely broke the surface. The response
to the Chancellor was no more than polite at best -- indicating less
than wholehearted belief in his promises of tax cuts in the future.
He ridiculed Labour promises on taxes as alien to their nature and
said: ''Reduce taxation we must and reduce taxation we will. It is just
a question of when we do it, no whether we do it.''
Business-friendly policies, he said, mattered as much to an English
Conservative as to a Scottish Conservative.
''We can try to beat eachother on the rugby pitch, but in today's
global markets we have both got to win togethern,'' he said.
''Labour's devolution policy is a policy of appeasement towards
Scottish separatism and a perilous step towards full Scottish
independence. Under Labour's devolution plans, all your economicv
nightmares would come true.''
Cathcart Tory Kenneth Ross pointed out that Scotland's unemployment
figures had shifted dramatically from being the worst in the UK to being
among the best. Inward investment was burgeoning and business confidence
was high, but he sounded a note of caution.
''Perhaps, for example, we should be looking at the large number of
people who are on short term contracts and who as a result have
difficulty in obtaining mortgages and loans to purchase cars. These are
things which we should constantly be looking for.''

SCOTTISH Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton sought to give
reassurances yesterday in the row over hospital provision in Stonehaven.
He told the Commons in a short debate that the plans did not mean
people would be asked to pay for services, did not represent a
fundamental change of policy and did not mean a reduction in the quality
of service.
Grampian Health Board announced recently that it had been told by the
Scottish Office to invite open competition for the future provision of
hospital services in the town.
Angry Opposition MPs have claimed that the move is a further step
towards full privatisation of the NHS, and yesterday the issue was
raised in the Commons by the Liberal Democrat MP for Gordon, Mr Malcolm
Bruce.
He told the House: ''I am concerned about what was done, the way it
was done and the knock-on effects elsewhere. I submit this takes the
private finance initiative way beyond anything that has been tried so
far in the health service and beyond what the Government's own
guidelines suggested.
''Construction companies, breweries, property companies -- everyone
from private companies to individuals can bid, and it really is
preposterous for the Government to suggest that this is not transferring
fundamental national assets to the private sector.''
Mr Bruce said the Government was treating public opinion with ''total
and utter contempt,'' and added that the announcement had outraged the
local community.''
However, Lord James told the House that the proposals, on which no
final decision had been taken, would mean a new hospital for Stonehaven
with the opportunity of providing it earlier than might be possible
under a conventional NHS solution.
He said: ''The proposals for Stonehaven are not about privatisation.
They are about seeking to achieve a high-quality, responsive service,
tailored to the needs of the local community.
''The NHS is primarily about patient care and putting the interests of
patients before all other considerations.
''Despite the alarmist and somewhat misleading press reports about
Grampian Health Board's announcement that it intends to put hospital
services in Stonehaven out to open tender, nothing in the board's
proposals is inconsistent with these principles.''

<TEXT>
THE Prince of Wales yesterday praised the timeless quality of the
island of Sark, in the Channel Islands, where there are no cars and
where he enjoyed a moonlit trip out to dinner in a pony and trap.
The prince was paying his first visit to the island, marking the 50th
anniversary of its liberation from Nazi occupation.
He told residents of an enjoyable evening he had on Tuesday,
travelling in a pony and trap to dinner and returning by moonlight with
candle lamps on the trap.
''It was a very special experience,'' said the prince, who joked:
''Quite what the horse felt I don't know.''
The prince said people talked of Sark as being as things were on the
mainland 50 years ago.
''In fact, what I think you have here is something utterly timeless,''
he said.
''Don't let anyone tell you you are old fashioned. Fashions change.
The most important thing is that quality of timelessness where certain
values and certain qualities of life really matter.''
The prince added: ''This kind of approach you have here is perfectly
relevant I think, whatever century you live in.''
As he had done on Tuesday in the islands of Jersey and Guernsey, the
prince read a message from the Queen to her ''most loyal people in the
Channel Islands'' before unveiling a photograph of the Queen in the
Island Hall.
Earlier on Sark (population 550), a notice warned carriage drivers
that helicopters would be coming and going during the celebrations. The
prince arrived in a horse-drawn open carriage at the church to attend
the service of thanksgiving.
He then walked to the nearby school, stopping to chat to people on the
way and pausing at the building which houses the island's two
tractor-drawn ambulances.
Chief ambulance officer, Mr Ian Bent, explained how patients who
needed urgent treatment were transferred by boat to Guernsey.
During the five-year occupation hundreds of Nazi soldiers were on the
island, where the ''seigneurie'' was the Dame of Sark, Sibyl Hathaway --
famous for taking a strong line with the occupation forces.
It was on May 10, 50 years ago, that a British officer arrived by
naval launch from Guernsey to tell her he could not immediately spare
any troops for Sark. He asked if she could cope for a few days and she
replied: ''As I have been left for nearly five years, I can stand a few
more days.''
The present seigneur, Mr Michael Beaumont, grandson of the dame, said
her most abiding memory of the occupation had been the lack of food.
''She said she was always dreaming of the smell and the taste of fried
bacon and eggs,'' he said.
The prince met one of the Germans who was on Sark during the
occupation and who now lives there after marrying an islander.
Mr Werner Rang spent six months on Sark as a medic and said yesterday:
''I had no choice but I came here and I looked after the people whether
soldiers or civilians.''
He met his wife Phyllis, who was an interpreter, on Sark, and he was
later taken prisoner on Guernsey at the end of the hostilities. They
married in 1948 and returned to live on Sark the following year.
Mr Werner, 75, runs a jewellery shop on the island and was awarded the
BEM in 1991 for his services to the Sark community.

Brussels
BRITAIN'S two European Commissioners, Mr Neil Kinnock and Sir Leon
Brittan, yesterday backed EU demands for an end to the United Kingdom's
opt-out from the Social Chapter of Maastricht and a weakening of the
national veto.
After an unusually protracted meeting of the Commission in Brussels
they joined in a call for next year's Maastricht review conference to
support the idea of more majority voting in the Council of Ministers --
in direct contravention of British Conservative policy.
Mr Jacques Santer, Commission president, who has been courting Britain
in recent times, also gave his personal support for a more integrated
European Union. ''We cannot afford to have a Europe a la carte,'' he
told reporters.
The Commission, whose findings are always presented as unanimous,
produced a detailed report on its attitudes to the Maastricht revision
which is expected to provoke new tensions between the British and
mainstream EU thinkers as well as deepening divisions inside the Tory
party.
Mr Santer appeared in diplomatic mood when he emphasised that the aim
was not to widen the competences of Brussels but to make the existing
treaty more workable. This supports the British wish that there should
be no ''great leap forward'' in EU integration. But, significantly, he
underlined the EU's determination to make the European integration
process political. ''We don't want a democracy to turn into a
technocracy,'' he said.
Meanwhile, leading Cabinet Euro-sceptic Michael Portillo launched a
trenchant attack on Brussels, saying it was packed with people who had
never created a job in their lives but who told businesses how to
consult their workforce and what hours employees could work.
He derided the Social Chapter as a ''compendium of restrictions''
devised by European bureaucrats to buy off their trade unions.
''John Major's refusal to be dragged into the Social Chapter has paid
dividends for Britain,'' Mr Portillo told Scottish Tories in Glasgow.
''We enter foreign markets with both hands free, not one tied behind
our backs.''
Mr Santer's remarks received a frosty reception from Euro-rebels at
Westminster. Seven of the nine Tory back benchers kicked out of the
parliamentary party -- and later readmitted -- issued a statement after
a meeting at Westminster, warning of an inevitable ''bust-up'' with the
Commission.
''It seems clear that the Commission has it in mind to challenge these
two essential British opt-outs and in these circumstances the group
considered that it was vital and urged the UK Government to publish and
make known its proposals for the 1996 IGC (inter-governmental
conference),'' the statement said.
''It is clear that the UK agenda will be wholly different from that
set out by the Commission and the sooner these issues are clarified, the
better.
''We could be heading for a bust-up with the EU. We feel that it is
something which may be inevitable. Our aims and those of the Commission
are poles apart.''
The statement was issued in the names of MPs Sir Teddy Taylor, Mrs
Teresa Gorman, Mr Christopher Gill, Mr Richard Shepherd, Mr Tony Marlow,
Mr John Wilkinson, and Mr Nicholas Budgen.
The Commission's views are a fair measure of mainstream EU thinking
but are not binding. All decisions on how to review Maastricht and make
it more relevant to ordinary, sometimes confused, European citizens will
be taken by heads of state at the 1996 IGC, where Mr Major has already
sworn to block attempts to water down the national veto.
Mr Santer argued that a reduction in the veto powers of member states
in all areas except the most essential to vital national interests was
required if the EU were to increase its membership from the existing 15
to 20 or 25 members. Otherwise, community decision-making would become
paralysed, he said.
Of all the issues facing the UK, the question of losing the veto is
uppermost in the minds of Ministers following Mr Major's lead of moving
tactically towards the Conservative Euro-sceptics' view of the IGC.
Britain last year embarrassingly lost one skirmish on the issue when
Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, found himself isolated at an
informal council meeting in Greece. He called then for a ''root and
branch'' review of voting procedures.
On the other big issue -- the Social Chapter of Maastricht -- the
Commission remained apparently implacable. Britain has an opt-out
negotiated by Mr Major which a Labour government would abandon. It was
this issue that earned Mr Major his standing ovation in the Commons but
which has since brought increasing criticism that British workers are
now the least protected and most exploited in the EU.

MAYFEST shows set for Glasgow's Kings Theatre could be under threat
from strike action after changes in long-standing working arrangements.
Two meetings will determine whether more than 50 house staff will
stage a walk out of the Bath Street building during the busy Mayfest
period.
The workers, who include ushers, bar staff, ticket sellers and others
represented by the Broadcasting Entertainment and Cinematograph
Technicians Union (Bectu), claim they are losing out after a change in
the shift rota system.
They say that a practice whereby long-serving staff were allocated the
majority of shifts each week has been altered under a new management
system.
One workers' representative said that some staff who have worked at
the Kings for more than 15 years have found their wages slashed by more
than two-thirds in some weeks.
A union meeting was held at the Kings Theatre last night and workers'
representatives are set to meet with management tonight after which they
say direct action may take place in an attempt to rectify their
grievance.

<HEADLINE>BR decides sleeper ruling does not include car service  Court victory fails to save Motorail</HEADLINE>

BRITISH Railways has decided the reprieve for the Fort William sleeper
does not apply to the Motorail cars service, and has told ScotRail it
will come off on May 28 as planned.
Highland Regional Council leaders, whose declared aim in raising the
legal action had been to save both the sleeper and Motorail, were
furious last night, viewing the BR board's action as vindictive. While
Labour's Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish called on the board
''to get off ScotRail's back and call an end to this saga''.
On Tuesday ScotRail told The Herald that its interpretation of Lord
Kirkwood's ruling had been that the Motorail element was an integral
part of the service and would therefore continue to run until public
consultations had been completed. That was still ScotRail's position
yesterday morning.
This could have meant that the Fort William/London Euston Motorail
would have survived months, perhaps more than a year, after the service
was withdrawn from all other UK routes.
By yesterday afternoon that had changed because the BR board, which is
to appeal against Lord Kirkwood's decision to grant Highland interim
inderdict, saw things differently.
A board spokesman told The Herald: ''There is no mention of Motorail
either in Highland Regional Council's original writ or in the court's
order. It is therefore clear that the ruling does not apply to the
Motorail cars. As a result these will come off the Fort William service
on May 28 when they will come off all other services.'' Highland
Regional Council's legal challenge had been based on Section 37 of the
1993 Railways Act, which refers to passenger services and not freight or
Motorail. Highland convener Duncan McPherson said last night: ''British
Rail remains intent on attacking the element of the service that could
not be afforded the protection of the courts. This approach seems both
petty and illogical, given that the present court order will require
that the trains continue to run.''
British Rail did not seem to care about shooting itself in the foot,
Mr McPherson said. Fort William Councillor Iain Macdonald, questioning
BR's motives, thought the loss of Motorail was bound to affect the
viability of the service. ''If you lose the cars you lose the
passengers.''
Meanwhile Mr McLeish said: ''This is nit-picking of the worst kind. It
smacks of Big Brother in the form of British Rail stepping in and trying
to make life as difficult as possible to take the shine off Highland
Regional Council's magnificent victory.
''This is simply unacceptable. British Rail must acknowledge the
court's decision immediately. We had been led to believe both Motorail
and the sleeper were included and I would hope BR would acknowledge the
spirit of the judgment.''
Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber MP Sir Russell Johnston said: ''Though
the court decision only applies to the Fort William sleeper, a general
point has been made about the underhand and reprehensible way that
British Rail tries to deny the people of the Highlands the right to have
their say on these services.
''There is now a moral obligation on BR to announce that Motorail will
also be retained, pending proper consultation. It would be inexcusable
for Motorail now to be closed, when the courts have ruled that the
sleepers must stay open.''
At present eight Motorail trains run daily between Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Aberdeen, Inverness, Fort William, Carlisle, Plymouth, Penzance, and
London.
The Fort William service has one Motorail car during the winter
timetable and three in the summer, a maximum capacity of six and 18 cars
respectively.

FORMER Rangers striker Duncan Ferguson was yesterday found guilty of
deliberately head-butting another player during a game, but will have to
wait two weeks to discover if he faces imprisonment.
Ferguson, now playing for Everton, showed no emotion as Sheriff
Alexander Eccles pronounced his verdict following a two-day trial at
Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Sentence on the footballer, who has three previous convictions for
assault, has been deferred for background and community service reports.
However, the Scotland internationalist has been cleared to play in the
FA Cup final a week on Saturday. The Scottish Football Association said
that a 12-match ban imposed in connection with the incident would not
come into effect until after the court sentence.
The attack, which was captured by television cameras and seen by
millions of viewers, took place after a tussle for the ball between
Ferguson, 23, and Raith Rovers defender John McStay, 29, during a
Scottish Premier Division match at Ibrox Stadium on April 16 last year.
Ferguson, then Scotland's most expensive player following a #4m
transfer from Dundee United, lunged at McStay striking him in the face.
He said in court it was an accident and he had been ''clumsy''. However,
before delivering his verdict, Sheriff Eccles said the action was ''not
accidental, but deliberate''.
The sheriff said he appreciated the incident had to be looked at in
the context of a highly-charged atmosphere, ''in a game which involves a
considerable amount of body contact and aggression''.
But, it had happened after play had stopped ''and the accused, in his
evidence, admitted play had ceased''.
After being given details of Ferguson's previous convictions, Sheriff
Eccles refused a defence request to deal with the matter immediately,
saying he wanted to see background and community service reports first.
Earlier, Ferguson had gone into the witness box to give his account of
the attack. He admitted he had been under intense pressure at the time
of the incident, because of his highly publicised transfer to Rangers
and the fact he had not yet scored for the club.
Describing the incident, he said that after facing up to the Raith
Rovers player he had misjudged his distance and his head accidentally
bumped into him.
The Everton striker said: ''There had been a tangle for the football,
then the two of us squared up to each other, eyeballed each other. I
stepped forward and I clashed with Mr McStay. Mr McStay fell to the
ground.''
Ferguson, at that point, said he was not aware that the referee's
whistle had blown. When asked by defence counsel Mr John Baird if he
remembered striking Mr McStay full in the face with his head, Mr
Ferguson replied: ''No. I didn't strike him in the face.''
Describing the consequences of the action, he said: ''The referee
spoke to us about tangling arms and told us to get on with the game.
Neither of us got cautioned, or anything.''
Under cross examination by fiscal Mr Alasdair Youngson, Ferguson
agreed he had been ''clumsy'' with his head while being ''annoyed and
aggressive''.
While trying to establish that Ferguson had accidentally struck McStay
with his head, the fiscal asked him: ''Do you not consider yourself to
be famous for heading the ball?'' To which Mr Ferguson replied: ''I
consider myself to be famous, but not for heading the ball.''
In his summing up, Mr Youngson said that a blatant late tackle or blow
in the course of the game might not constitute assault, but in this case
play had been stopped by the referee before the head-butt took place.
He stated: ''The evidence has shown beyond reasonable doubt that Mr
Ferguson's purpose was to inflict physical damage or to attack McStay in
pursuance of a quarrel which was taking place at the time.
''He was annoyed at not getting the ball and that was what gave Mr
Ferguson a motive for doing what he did. Play had stopped, but he didn't
continue chasing the ball, which he was so keen to get, and lunged at
McStay with his head.''
Mr Baird said it was ''quite artificial'' to say that once the game
had stopped there was a complete suspension of the match from a sporting
context and the criminal law then applied.
He said all games police themselves, and that there was a referee,
linesmen, and a disciplinary system. He added: ''Violent conduct in the
context of sport can't be justified as a criminal assault.
''Of course players get aggressive -- they are supposed to be
aggressive. It is a contact sport played at a professional level, and it
would be nonsense to say that seizing hold of a player's shirt or
lunging at another player constitutes an assault.''
Sentence has been deferred until May 25.

<FLAG>SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE PARTY ANNUAL CONFERENCE</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>978452818</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DIVIDED Scottish Tories -- faced with a choice of direction after
recent electoral setbacks -- last night took a right turn, attracted by
the allure of the party's Thatcherite wing.
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo earned a standing ovation from
the Scottish conference -- in stark contrast to the sullen response to
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke -- and many of the party faithful stayed on
last night to give an enthusiastic hearing to the darling of the
Scottish Tory right, Home Office Minister Michael Forsyth, as he painted
his vision of the future at a fringe meeting.
Leaving the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow, Mr Forsyth insisted that
his lecture had been a personal view. Asked whether its content, which
was very close to that of Mr Portillo's speech, represented a concerted
attempt to drag the party back towards Thatcherite verities, he said
that was for others to judge.
Today will see a fight back by the rival ''One Nation'' approach, when
supporters of that strand of party thinking present the ''Cathcart
Declaration''. Tory stalwarts from the area will lay out a 10-point
plan, aimed at dragging what they see as a mortally-wounded party closer
to mainstream Scottish electoral thinking.
Councillor John Young said yesterday that office-bearers with more
than 180 years of accumulated party experience would call for a more
populist and distinctively Scottish approach to overcome Conservative
difficulties, including a referendum on the constitution.
On the evidence of yesterday, however, the moderates and modernisers
face an uphill task, as it was the unreservedly Thatcherite wing that
captured the popular mood.
Mr Portillo told delegates that they could overcome recent setbacks if
they were candid about what had gone wrong. However, in contrast to
conventional thinking that the Conservative Party has drifted too far to
the right of the Scottish electorate, he then outlined a vision of
unreconstructed Thatcherism.
The party, he said, had to win back alienated supporters such as
retired people, home owners and ''responsible people who have made
provision for themselves -- the sort of people we value and admire''.
Mr Portillo said: ''My task is to make it even easier for one person
to offer another a job: for one person to say to another, 'Work for me
and I will give you money.' Every time government intervenes it makes
that simple human transaction more difficult, whether with taxes,
regulation, subsidy or, most lethally of all, with misguided good
intentions.''
Attempting to place himself beyond the current European debate dogging
his party, he said the Tories had a truly global vision. ''Let others
fuss over little Europe,'' he said, and added a strong attack on
Scottish devolution.
Of Labour, he said: ''In their craven fear of the SNP and in their
shameless cringeing to Brussels, there is nothing of principle, nothing
of worth, nothing Labour cherish or hold dear.''
Mr Portillo won a standing ovation, and about 100 delegates stayed on
for Mr Forsyth's lecture. He, too, received a warm reception, which is
certain to reopen the internal debate over the direction the party must
take to regain electoral confidence.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw claimed last night that Mr Portillo
and Mr Forsyth had proved that the far right of the Tory Government was
now ''rampant''.
He asked: ''How else do you explain a speech from Mr Portillo that
only just falls short of calling for our withdrawal from Europe and once
more flies in the face of overwhelming Scottish opposition by rejecting
any devolved government for Scotland.''

SCOTRAIL services will be slashed unless budget cuts demanded by the

night.
They said ScotRail faced financial strictures even before the Court of
Session's reprieve for the Fort William to London sleeper, which has
losses alone of #2.5m.
Since April 1, ScotRail management has been wrestling with an order to
reduce costs by at least 5%, with similar savings expected in subsequent
years as the Government further reduces subsidies.
ScotRail's statutory duty to balance the books has already led to 119
voluntary redundancies, cutting staff to 4100.
It also aims to save money by replacing loco-hauled Highland Explorer
trains with Sprinters this summer; reducing Inverness-Wick services, and
adopting ''good housekeeping measures''.
But one official warned ScotRail still has ''a long way to go to
achieve the budget targets,'' let alone cover the sleeper's losses.
He also warned that further job losses would probably ''impact on the
quality of customer service.'' He said if that option was deemed
unacceptable, the only other choice available was to run fewer trains.
ScotRail's finance director, Mr Alex Lynch, has already said more
painful service cuts affecting up to 10,000 passengers will arise from
the Fort William sleeper reprieve.
Last night, other officials pointed to Mr Chris Green's forecast in
November that ScotRail would be run down unless more money was made
available.
Mr Green, who resigned as director in February, said that even budget
cuts of #3m -- let alone the #6m-#10m figures being bandied about --
would mean fewer trains, up to 600 job losses, and fare increases. The
last option is now unlikely because of Government proposals to cap fare
increases.
ScotRail's turnover is in excess of #300m, with #98m from revenue, and
the remainder in subsidies from Strathclyde Regional Council and the
Office of Passenger Rail Franchising. Council subsidies could slump
after the region's abolition next year, and the Director of Opraf, Mr
Roger Salmon, wants more cuts in the money it provides.
However, fixed outgoings include #175m to Railtrack and #50m to train
leasing companies. That leaves only about #50m in managed costs -- staff
and services -- open to cutbacks.
It is understood Mr Salmon was to issue ScotRail's minimum passenger
service requirements yesterday, but the announcement was put back a
fortnight because of Highland region's court victory.
The BR board has served notice of an appeal. Yesterday, it also
appeared to be trying to save money by opting not to resurrect the
Motorail service attached to the sleeper.
If the appeal is unsuccessful, ScotRail ''will have to look at
economies elsewhere,'' to save the sleeper's #2.5m losses.
Likely targets are trains in the Edinburgh and Fife areas; the West
Highland line; the Glasgow-Stranraer route, and services from Inverness
to Kyle, Wick, and Thurso.
Meanwhile ScotRail plans to accept bookings for the reprieved Fort
William sleeper -- including a 24-berth sleeping car added at Easter to
meet demand -- after May 28 when it ceases to be in the timetable.
Customers will be warned that if an appeal against Lord Kirkwood's
decision is upheld then there would be no sleeper and their money will
be returned.

THE Government last night met Sinn Fein chiefs face to face -- and
insisted there must be movement on decommissioning IRA weapons before
the party can progress into substantive political talks on Northern
Ireland's future.
During three-and-a-half hours of tough talking at Stormont between
teams led by Northern Ireland Minister Michael Ancram and Sinn Fein's
Martin McGuinness, the sides set out very different demands.
The Government insisted there had to be progress on the arms issue
before doors opened; Sinn Fein called for immediate entry to the
political mainstream.
It was clear that for the Government weapons were the number one
priority, but for Sinn Fein it was equality of treatment with other
parties and fast entry into discussions about the province's future.
The party also called for an early meeting between Ulster Secretary
Sir Patrick Mayhew and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams. Mr Ancram
offered the republicans three dates next week for a further meeting. But
Mr McGuinness hinted they might not go unless the Government agreed to
the meeting with Mr Adams.
In practical terms, that could not take place before next month as Mr
Adams flew to the US on Monday for an extended 12-city tour.
Mr Ancram gave a commitment to report back on the meeting to Sir
Patrick and to pass on Sinn Fein's demand.
He also announced that the ban on meetings between Ministers and Sinn
Fein local councillors was being lifted -- for so long as his dialogue
with the party continued.
The historic meeting began with a handshake behind closed doors in the
parliament buildings where Sinn Fein has already held a series of
exploratory talks over recent months with British officials. Mr Ancram,
who survived the IRA bomb attack on the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984,
is the first Minister to meet an Irish republican delegation since 1972,
when Mr McGuinness was part of an IRA group which held secret talks in
London.
According to those outside, the meeting took place just inside the
door of the small ground-floor conference room where Mr Ancram was
already on his feet waiting to receive the Sinn Fein representatives.
First in was the leader of the visiting delegation, and without
further ado, the Minister in a smart charcoal grey suit reached out to
offer the handshake of all handshakes which confirmed the developing
peace process in Northern Ireland.
The time was approaching 11.35am and Martin McGuinness, the republican
once loathed by the British establishment and still hated by Ulster
Unionists, greeted his opposite number with the same graciousness.
Asked for his emotions when he shook hands with Mr McGuinness and his
team, Mr Ancram said later: ''I shook hands with them when they came in
on a formal basis as I would any delegation I meet.
''This was a significant meeting, but it was only one step in a
process and that was how I dealt with it.''
Mr McGuiness said afterwards: ''The mood of the meeting was
business-like and frank and we had a very detailed and interesting
discussion on all matters concerning the peace process.
''It remains to be seen if we make the type of progress which is
essential to move the peace process on.''
Meanwhile, Mr Adams yesterday rejected any idea of UN peacekeepers in
Northern Ireland, but said the world body might play a role in case of a
deadlock in negotiations.

A MOTHER told a court yesterday that she has been haunted by guilt
since her daughter's death at a swimming-pool.
Mrs Roberta Clark, 33, sat and cried as she told a fatal accident
inquiry at Dumfries Sheriff Court how she had wanted to accompany
10-year-old Kerry, a non-swimmer, to the council-owned pool in Dumfries.
But, she claimed, play scheme organisers who arranged the outing,
would not allow her go along as a helper. ''I asked three or four times
but they insisted they had enough helpers,'' she said.
Soon afterwards, a policeman called at the play scheme, where Mrs
Clark was helping with other children, and told her that Kerry had been
involved in an accident.
The girl was later certified dead at Dumfries Infirmary where she had
been taken after she was found at the deep-end of the pool on July 5
last year.
Mrs Clark, of Criffel Court, Dumfries, revealed that Kerry had nearly
drowned when she was five after falling from a boat in to a lake. Her
older sister, Stacy, had saved her.
Mrs Clark, who has another daughter Emma, said Kerry had wanted to go
to the pool to play on a flume.
''I cannot understand how she was at the 12ft-end when she couldn't
swim,'' she added. ''I feel guilty because if I had been there she would
have been here today because I wouldn't have let her go to 12 feet.''
Her husband, Mr George Clark, 36, said he was concerned about the
level of supervision by the play scheme organisers at the pool and the
fact that there seemed to be no checks to find out if the children could
swim.
Parents had been sent consent forms by Lincluden and Lochside
Playscheme group, and Mrs Clark had signed hers just before the party
left. Three adults had accompanied the 22 children to the pool.
A committee member, Mrs Grace McLaren, 36, said Mrs Clark had asked if
she could accompany the helpers but this had been arranged the previous
day. She said she had no recollection of Mrs Clark asking several times.
Questioned by the Clarks' solicitor, Mr Lyall Moodie, Mrs McLaren said
the consent forms did not ask if the child could swim. It had not
occurred to her until recently to include such a question.
Health and Safety Inspector Ms Jennifer Barrett said no-one had seen
Kerry get into difficulties at the pool.
She said the pool had sufficient lifeguards on the day but she had
recommended increased staff levels to cover a blind-spot on the pool
when an aqua-flow was in use.
The inquiry continues.

THE FIRST Church of Scotland minister to hold the post of Chaplain
General to the Forces yesterday admitted to being nervous about his
forthcoming role as Moderator of the General Assembly which meets later
this month.
The Rev James Harkness also expressed some surprise at his
appointment, and his discovery of it: he was told by phone on an
InterCity train. ''I knew my name was being considered and had been
urged to keep in contact. I managed to get hold of a mobile phone and
was informed on a 225 about 10 minutes out of York station.''
On whether the Assembly held any fears for him having served in the
Army, he said: ''Anyone who is not nervous really ought not to be
here.''
He told a news conference in Edinburgh no-one other than a lunatic
would want to have anything to do with war in any shape of form. ''I
believe in a certain sense I'm a pacifist . . . Ultimately for a
chaplain we're not in the business of saying praise God and pass the
ammunition.''
On church unity, Mr Harkness, who was born in Dumfries-shire, said he
believed the churches were moving together to what he hoped might be
''the ultimate goal'', adding: ''I'm talking about unanimity, not some
kind of stultifying uniformity.''
* Cardinal Thomas Winning is to be the Roman Catholic Church's
official delegate at the Assembly, the first time a Cardinal has filled
the task. It is believed he will be asked to address the Assembly.

THE Government last night comfortably beat off a threatened defeat
over its shake-up of London hospitals.
A Labour motion attacking the closures and mergers was defeated in the
Commons by 320 to 308, a Government majority of 12.
Two Tory back benchers, former Cabinet Minister Peter Brooke, and Sir
John Gorst joined Labour in the voting lobbies, while Sir Rhodes Boyson
and Mr Hugh Dykes abstained.
Defending her reforms, Mrs Bottomley told MPs: ''We have to deliver a
health service which is right for the future, not a health service which
is right for the past.''

THE train drivers' union Aslef claimed yesterday that ScotRail may
have to send drivers by taxi from Glasgow to Fort William to keep the
sleeper services running, because it had already agreed to make five
drivers redundant.
ScotRail negotiated the redundancies with Aslef in anticipation of the
sleeper service from Fort William being axed. Five drivers agreed terms
and will leave in June.
However, now that the courts have ordered ScotRail to keep the service
running, it is unclear how the trains will be staffed after June.
Mr Pat O'Connor, Scottish secretary of Aslef, said yesterday: ''We
told them that they should not go ahead with the redundancies, but they
wouldn't listen. As far as we can see the only alternatives are to take
drivers by taxi from Queen Street to Fort William or to cross trade with
Railfreight and get the freight firm to supply the drivers.''
A ScotRail spokesman said it would not be a problem getting drivers
from other parts of the rail business.
However, Mr O'Connor said if drivers came from the freight company,
Railfreight, it could charge ScotRail a high price for the service,
adding to the costs of the sleeper.
At its general meeting in Glasgow yesterday, the pressure group West
Coast Rail 250, campaigning for improvements to the West Coast Main
Line, welcomed the reprieve for the sleeper, but warned the fight to
secure a permanent victory was just beginning.

A MAN accused of shooting another in the head at almost point-blank
range left the High Court in Glasgow yesterday, after a charge of murder
was found not proven.
A jury returned from spending a night in a hotel to find charges
against Mr Robert Morrison, 33, not proven.
Mr Morrison, of Blackhill, Glasgow, had denied murdering Mr Thomas
Welsh and attempting to murder his two brothers and six other people
last November.
He declined to give evidence during the week-long trial.
The dead man's brother, Mr Martin Welsh, 31, who told the court that
he saw Mr Morrison carry out the shooting near the Provanmill Inn,
Glasgow, said he had at first refused to help murder squad detectives
because he wanted to kill Mr Morrison himself.
But he told defence solicitor-advocate, Mr Paul Burns, that he changed
his mind when he could not get to Mr Morrison to kill him.
He said his brother was shot as a group of men watched a fight between
two others. The group had to dive for cover as, he alleged, Mr Morrison
shot several times.
No alleged motive for the shooting was offered during the trial.

<TEXT>
SCIENTISTS believe that a huge increase in the incidence of Crohn's
Disease, a chronic bowel disorder, is linked to a bacteria found in beef
cattle.
The bacteria found in 3% of all cattle slaughtered in the UK has for
the first time been identified in all Crohn's Disease sufferers tested.
Vets believe the disease originates from infected rabbits. Cattle are
infected when they eat tainted grass or lie down on infected pasture.
The bacteria found in rabbits is known as myco bacterium para
tuberculosis (MTB) and causes Johne's disease in cattle.
Crohn's disease is doubling among adults and quadrupling among
children. It brings misery to thousands and there is no known cure.
Professor John Hermon-Taylor, professor of surgery at St George's
Hospital Medical School in London found MTB in all of his patients.
He has been studying Crohn's Disease for 10 years, and has spent two
and a half years developing a test for MTB in humans.
He said: ''You don't have to be a genius to work out how this can get
from cattle into humans.''
His study, linking MTB to Crohn's Disease, has been published in
Analytical Biochemistry magazine and the findings have been passed on to
the Ministry of Agriculture. However, he also found that MTB is not
found in people suffering from bowel disorders other than Crohn's
Disease.
Mr Ken Ingram, chairman of the Tayside branch of the National
Association for Colitis and Crohn's, revealed the disease is spreading
from the east of Scotland, where it had been confined, to the west
coast, where support groups have been set up in Ayr and Glasgow.
He said: ''Over 500 people are being treated for Crohn's in Aberdeen
and Dundee. We are seeing a four-fold rise in children and a
two-and-a-half times increase in adults.''
Mr Alastair Greig, assistant director of veterinary services at the
Scottish Agricultural College in Perth believes it ''highly probable''
that his research will prove cross-transference of the disease from
rabbits to cattle.
''Cattle infected with MTB waste away. They suffer from enteritis and
just scour away. It is a chronic debilitating condition which is seen in
3% of all cows slaughtered in abbatoirs.
''It is more of a problem in Scotland than in England and farmers may
have to kill up to 15% of affected herds.''
He believes that cows may become infected by rabbit droppings and
speculated that chewing grass could be a source of infection for humans
as well.
A spokesman for the Meat and Livestock Commission said: ''MTB sticks
only to the gut wall of affected cattle. It is not found in the muscle
which is the part that you eat. We are confident that there is no way it
can cross the boundary between cattle and humans.''

STRICTER controls on Temazepam were announced by the Government
yesterday, in an attempt to cut drastically the amount of the drug
available on the streets as part of a far-reaching Government plan
against illegal drugs.
Mr Gordon McMaster, Labour MP for Paisley South, said later: ''This
will hit the drug barons hard and smash the drug rings that are
exploiting young people.''
Mr Phil Gallie, Conservative MP for Ayr, whose question in the Commons
produced the announcement from Mr Tony Newton, Leader of the House,
said: ''He went much further than I expected. It will take some time to
run down the huge stocks of the drug currently available, but these new
controls will steadily erode that and cut fresh supplies.''
The Government will impose the safe custody provisions of the Misuse
of Drugs Act on manufacturers and wholesalers who stock Temazepam,
ensuring tighter security of stocks. It is starting the consultations
legally required immediately with a view to banning GPs from prescribing
gell-filled capsules.
Ministers are still discussing a proposal to reschedule the status of
Temazepam from a schedule four to a schedule three drug, which would
require doctors to write each prescription out by hand and any possessor
to produce a personal prescription or be guilty of an offence.
The Scottish Office is believed to be giving strong backing to the
move, with the support of Home Office Minister Mr Michael Forsyth. The
English Health Department is thought to be worried about the increased
prescribing costs involved.
Scotland's Health Minister, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, will address the
Scottish Conservative conference in Glasgow today on the fight against
drugs.
A White Paper, Tackling Drugs Together, was presented for England and
Wales by Ministers from five Government departments which have
co-ordinated their efforts to combat drug abuse. It estimates that three
million people in the UK take an illegal drug in any one year, and calls
it a major and growing problem.
Ministers dismissed the option of legalising drugs and plan to
intensify the campaign against drug dealers while strengthening efforts
to reduce the demand for illegal drugs through prevention, education and
treatment.
Mrs Anne Taylor, for Labour, welcomed the campaign, but questioned
whether the Government was making sufficient cash resources available
for success. She took a side-swipe at the resolution passed by the last
Liberal Democrat assembly, calling for the legalising of cannabis, which
Labour opposed.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Alan Beith welcomed the Government's
approach, but said that the funding available for individuals schools
for anti-drug campaigns was insufficient.
Mr Newton said that #13m extra would be provided for England and Wales
-- comprised of #5.9m for education, #1m for health, #4.6m for prisons
and just under #2m for drug action teams to be increased in the next
couple of years.
The Government's moves were given a cautious welcome by the police in
Scotland.
Mr Tom Rowatt, secretary of the 6500-strong Strathclyde branch of the
Scottish Police Federation, said: ''I am pleased with these measures,
because they are steps in the right direction. I have to qualify that by
saying that it is imperative that Temazepam's classification is made
schedule three, which would make it even harder to acquire.
''If these discussions on rescheduling are still active, then it is
pleasing, and so is the idea that Temazepam in jelly form may be banned
altogether. It is away beyond time that this drug was tackled, because
it has caused untold misery. For years it has been the common factor in
practically all the Glasgow drug deaths, with addicts injecting
cocktails for greater effect.
''Unless Temazepam is rescheduled, then we will never get to the
bottom of the horrific drug problems in the West of Scotland and other
major Scottish cities. The time for more words is really over and we
need strong action.''

THE Scottish Office last night signalled a complete U-turn on nurses'
pay, instructing trusts to make immediate offers to staff.
Labour and union officials said it was a cynical attempt to buy off
criticism at the time of the Scottish Tory conference and a visit by the
Prime Minister.
The Herald has seen a copy of a letter sent by Mr Geoff Scaife, chief
executive of the Scottish NHS to trust chairmen and chief executives,
demanding offers on the table within 48 hours.
Dated Tuesday, it calls on trusts to make formal offers by today to
unions representing nurses, midwives, and paramedical staff. It stops
short of specifying the full 3% sought by the unions.
However, last night a health trust chairman told The Herald he had
been instructed by Government officials to offer the full 3%, and to
seek immediate means to fund it through cost savings.
''A managers' training course in pay bargaining was cancelled at the
last minute when this edict arrived,'' he explained. ''It is quite
obvious that the Government is concerned next week's nurses' conference
will seek to remove their no-strike agreement and this is to pre-empt
that.
''It is basically a new deal to bribe health workers to curtail
industrial action.''
He said they were being given no extra money. ''It appears one problem
is being ameliorated for political purposes, while another has been left
to us to sort out.''
The letter says: ''We would ask that you make a clear statement of
your trust's position in respect of local pay bargaining directly to the
staff concerned and to their representatives, by the same date.''
It discloses further details which directly contradict earlier
Government claims that the issue of local pay was one entirely for
trusts. ''To allow us to ensure that all trusts are aware of the level
and nature of offers being made, please let us have details of your
offer or your statement, as soon as possible,'' it adds.
The rush for immediate settlements follows four months of stand-off in
Scotland. In England and Wales more than 100 trusts have already offered
3% after encouragement by the NHS management executive: only two trusts
have made such offers in Scotland.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''This is obviously a
panic measure for the Tory conference. It is all the more galling
because it overturns everything they have said in the past.''
Ms June Andrews, Scottish secretary of the Royal College of Nursing,
said: ''This is a remarkable change of tack. They have had since
February to come up with something, and I am surprised at the short
timescale left now for trusts.''
She said the failure of trusts to make offers had influenced the
college's position on industrial action, the subject of an emergency
resolution at its congress next week. She warned that a rush of offers
below the demand of 3% without strings would only inflame nurses.
Mr Jim Devine, spokesman for Unison, which represents nurses and other
NHS staff not mentioned in the letter, said it was ''dishonest, divisive
and demoralising''.
The Herald can also reveal details of active involvement by the
Scottish NHS management executive in setting the agenda for local pay.
It has spent #45,000 on seminars organised by an outside consultancy for
trust personnel directors to train them in negotiating techniques.
Directors were required to submit reports back to the management
executive.
The Scottish Office denied any U-turn on pay. ''It remains a matter
for individual NHS trusts to enter pay negotiations with their staff.
Our policy on that has not changed,'' a spokesman said. He defended the
spending on seminars and said it was standard practice to assess their
effectiveness afterwards.

THE days when a woman was happy to trust her partner with financial
affairs without investigating too deeply are numbered.
According to a study of family finances conducted in April among more
than 600 married or co-habiting couples, more women are taking charge of
the money rather than leaving everything to their partner.
The study, by insurers Eagle Star, shows that women today tend to
belong to the Agatha Christie school of thought.
The crime writer once noted: ''Where large sums of money are concerned
it is advisable to trust nobody.''
The study showed:
* 74% of women claim to know what their partner earns, compared with
only 64% of men.
* 81% of women know what their partner's pension arrangements are,
against just 61% of men.
* 79% of women know whether their partner is insured against serious
accident, illness, or death, compared with 71% of men.
* Nearly one in seven women admits to keeping a sum of money unknown
to their partner for emergencies or rainy days, while fewer than one in
10 men make the same claim. Approximately 40% of these hidden nest eggs
amount to more than #1000.
Ms Pam Taylor, business manager for Eagle Star, commented: ''In this
day and age, ignorance about finance is not bliss when it comes to
living together.
''Women are clearly not taking the principle of sharing their
partner's worldly goods at face value.
''They are becoming much more aware of their financial affairs and, in
many cases, they are assuming responsibility for important financial
decisions.
''Evidently, they feel it is too important a subject to leave to their
partner, particularly at a time when so many are finding their partner's
job security is under threat.
''If the trend highlighted by this survey continues, it may not be
long before most women -- housewives and working mothers alike -- insist
on having their own pension arrangements and their own pot of savings.
Too many women today find they do not have enough to fall back on if
their partner leaves them or loses his job.''
The survey also shows that women have more responsibility for paying
household bills, that they are dominant when it comes to choosing a
holiday, and the weekly shopping is their preserve.
However, 39% of couples' decisions about which car to buy are made by
the man alone, against just 9 per cent of households where the woman
decides.

POLICE were last night trying to unravel the macabre mystery of the
murder of three young children and the body of a woman, believed to be
the mother, found nearby.
The youngsters, two boys and a girl, had been stabbed to death. They
were found by officers at their home in Gloucester Way, Thetford,
Norfolk.
The woman's body was discovered later, face down in a pond in a
woodland glade several miles away. She had earlier been seen staggering
through the wood by two people walking their dogs, and her damaged car
was found abandoned about three-quarters of a mile away, just over the
border in Suffolk.
Norfolk Police said they were treating it as a triple murder and
suspicious death.
Several people have been interviewed, but a spokesman said no one was
under arrest. They are thought to include the dead woman's estranged
husband, who was described by detectives as ''totally distraught''.
The alarm was raised shortly after dawn yesterday when a passing lorry
driver reported seeing the damaged green Vauxhall Cavalier.
''Police officers went to the Brandon Road, outside Thetford, just
into Suffolk, where a green Vauxhall Cavalier was discovered damaged,''
said a spokesman.
Ownership of the vehicle was traced to the house in Gloucester Way.
Police broke into the end-of-terrace property on a council housing
estate and made the grisly discovery in the childrens' bedrooms.
Detective Superintendent Terry Maxim of Norfolk Police said that ''a
substantial domestic knife'' was found nearby. What he described as
''paperwork which may be significant to the inquiry'' was also
discovered in the house.
The woman's body was discovered later.
Post-mortem examinations were being held last night to establish
exactly how and when all four victims died.
Neighbours spoke of the ''lovely young mum'', whom they named as
29-year-old Joy Senior, and the children: Curtis eight; Cheryl, six; and
four-year-old Clinton.
Ms Joanne Smith said: ''Her kids came first with everything. She
devoted herself to them -- they were her life.''
Mrs Brenda Harper said: ''She was always so jolly and her children
were polite and immaculately dressed. You couldn't have wished for a
better family.''
Another neighbour, retired transport manager Mr John Hatch, 82, who
lives opposite the house, said they were ''a perfect family''.
He added: ''She was always with them and playing with them, in fact
they were outside last night all playing football.''
Neighbour Mr Hatch said he understood the children's father lived
elsewhere in the town and that the parents were not married.
He said the father turned up at the house after police had discovered
the bodies.
''He was screaming and demanding to get into the house, but the police
wouldn't let him,'' said Mr Hatch.
Police said it could be some time before the woman's body was formally
identified.
They were last appealing for witnesses who may have seen the car --
registration A96 MSH -- in the vicinity of the B1107 Brandon Road on
Tuesday night or early yesterday to contact the incident room at
Thetford on 01842 762878.
