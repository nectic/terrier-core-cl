GHK director of rugby Andy Little was amazed and surprised at his side's fast
reversal of fortunes at Philiphaugh. Down 14-0 at half-time, GHK stepped up a
gear in the second half to consign Selkirk to Division Three next season.
Both clubs still have cup glory to seek, but it is doubtful if any game will
match the complete transformation on Saturday when GHK rattled up 40 points in
a breathtaking second half, for which the final whistle was welcome relief for
the home side.
There was no indication of such a turnaround at half-time, when Selkirk led
with a try by Darren Hulme and three Rodney Pow penalty goals. But, according
to Little, the turning point was Graham Agnew's opening try in 47 minutes, when
he took full back Gerry Hawkes' pass to go over in the right corner.
GHK went on to add a further five tries as Selkirk ran out of steam, and the
home side was left to regret not having built on their first-half dominance.
Tries by Cammy Litttle, Murray Wallace, Harry Bassi, then Agnew and Wallace
again added to the Selkirk misery, with John McLeod slotting five conversions.
Selkirk's consolation was two further Pow penalties.
For Selkirk coach John Rutherford it was almost unbearable. ``I am gutted,'' he
said. However, selector Nick Bihel said they had to look to the future: ``We
are down, but we are by no means out. We will be back.'' He added that Selkirk
would have to bring in younger players for the regional league matches.
Rutherford is to continue as coach, but a question mark must hang over the
future of international centre Scott Nichol. He confirmed that he would be
staying until the end of the season, but beyond that he could say no more.
Selkirk - R Pow; D Hunter, K Johnston, D Gage, D Hulme; S Nichol, A Lindores; B
Johnson, D Graham, I Purves, D Cameron, K Sinclair, K McConnell, R Evans, D
Nichol. Replacement - M Jaffray for Hunter (71min.).
GHK - G Hawkes; G Agnew, H Bassi, T Sanderson, G Caldwell; J McLeod, C Little;
S Gray, C Docherty, G McIlwham, K Wilson, C Du Plessis, S Unkles, M Wallace, R
Sweeney.
Referee - D Girdwood (Stewart's Melville).
SCORERS: Selkirk - Hulme, 1t; Pow, 5p. GHK - Agnew, 2t; Wallace, 2t; Little,
1t; Bassi, 1t; McLeod, 5c.
Selkirk 20, GHK 40

MY daughter was singing as she polished the furniture. I hadn't asked her to
polish the furniture. I never do. But where one brother is happiest with a
computer, one a football, and one a model car, her idea of bliss is a can of
Spring Fresh and a duster. Where have I gone wrong?
While the boys have to be nagged, bribed, or tricked into doing their
infinitesimal share of the household chores, and can't be seen for dust when
they think they're finished, she's up on a chair with the Fairy Liquid before
you can say ``dishes'', scrubbing at pans as if her life depended on it.
Being a bit of a tomboy myself and not too hot on the domestic skills, I used
to argue till I was blue in the face that the differences between men and women
were all about upbringing and expectations. Nobody could have approached
motherhood with a grittier determination that all children would be treated the
same, not channelled along some pre-ordained path. Boys would be offered soft
toys to cuddle, girls would play with cars and trains. I would breed the New
Men and female engineers of the future.
I dare say there are indeed small boys and girls who do such things, but not
mine. The hubris awaiting me was a family in which every politically incorrect
stereotype in the book is rife.
Ten years ago, as I gazed at my first-born in his cradle, I fantasised about
the gentle soul he would be. No guns or nasty aggressive games for this little
peach-blossom. He would be taught to turn away wrath with a soft word. His toys
would all come from the Early Learning Centre. He would grow up to be
Secretary-General of the United Nations.
The fantasy sustained me until he was about two, when he proudly presented me
with his first Duplo model - a rifle. Later on, at playgroup, he and his pals
daily assassinated each other with the creative output from the Sticklebrick
table. In the garden he and his brother began doing such heart-stopping things
with sticks that in the end I went out and bought them a couple of plastic
swords.
We went downhill fast. A decade and three more sons after those early dreams,
we now house an arsenal of swords, rifles, water pistols, bows and arrows,
hatchets, daggers and tanks tht would be the envy of the British Army. Not so
long ago, we were all nearly arrested when a most life-like revolver in our
luggage caused a security scare at Heathrow Airport.
I have now resigned myself to the fact that little boys simply enjoy aggressive
games and love weapons. It's in them from the start. Mind you, I'm quite
prepared to admit my boys are probably worse than others. I imagine, for
instance that my third son is probably alone in feeling the working day has not
begun properly until he has brandished a chop-stick at his nursery teacher. Nor
is my once-cherubic first-born perhaps typical in his enthusiastic membership
of the Scottish Amateur Wrestling Association.
But I think, all the same, it's just a matter of degree. Cuddly and
affectionate and lovable as they are when you get them on their own, most small
boys en masse provide a sobering spectacle for optimists about the future of
the world. One wonders less at how many wars there have been through history,
than at how few.
And what of my daughter, the lone sandwiched sister? Has the overwhelming
presence of boys, train sets, guns and footballs in her life produced a tomboy?
Not a chance - any more than the accumulation of dolls and Little Ponies and
Polly Pockets has had the slightest civilising effect on her brothers. She
never knows from one minute to the next whether her favourite doll will be
found strung up by the neck from her bedroom door or kicked down the garden to
score the winning goal for Aberdeen.
She can hold her own all right when push comes, as it frequently does in our
house, to shove. She can punch with the best of them and used to have a
dangerous line in teeth. But the idea of fighting for fun, for pleasure, would
never occur to her.
She plays all the boys' games because she has to. You'll find her from time to
time teetering round the house in plastic high heels, with a handbag (pink) in
one hand and a shot-gun in the other, and she can manage a tolerable football
dribble down the left wing when they need someone to make up the numbers. But
her heart is not really in it. She would much rather be drawing or writing or
cutting out stars or polishing shells or - dear heavens - cleaning the
bathroom, while waves of boys surge and roar around her.
I finally faced up to the fact boys and girls are simply born different on the
day, a few years ago, when I was hanging out the washing and gave her and the
next brother up a couple of clothes-pegs to play with. He shot me with his. She
cradled it in her arms and sang it a lullaby.
These days, while they all love our real baby equally and with a passion, she
at five is the only one I can trust to look after him for more than two
minutes. The seven-year-old does his best but is easily distracted, the
eldest's idea of child minding is to birl him around in his baby-walker so fast
that his head nearly spins off, and the second-youngest thinks there's nothing
like a few swift taps on the head to cheer a baby up. She alone has the
patience to sit picking up discarded rattles and replacing them time and again.
So naturally she is the one I tend to ask for help with the baby. She is also,
in the throes of her current love affair with the duster and the toilet
cleaner, the one who helps most with the housework, while the energy required
to pin a son down for long enough just to pick a biscuit off the floor makes it
tempting not to bother.
But I won't give up. I'll continue to try to treat them equally and expect the
same of them. And by the time they're all in their teens, I imagine they'll be
equally impossible to get to do anything. But right now nature is wearing down
the nurture. Equality is hard work.

TILLY WILSON has until April to complete post-graduate research on the
relationship between the church and the gospel and how the two interact with
the travelling community, its culture, and traditions. Heady stuff. But then
Wilson is uniquely qualified to tackle it. For a start, she was born into the
gipsy community herself; and second, overcoming a lack of formal education and
with not a single school exam pass to her name, she succeeded in becoming a
Church of Scotland minister. This month marks the fifth anniversary of her
ordination.
During that period the Reverend Matilda Wilson has fulfilled a unique role. She
is sole non-Catholic cleric responsible for the spiritual welfare of travellers
in the UK. ``It was an area the national church hadn't covered. I didn't have
to build up a relationship first; I knew how we travellers think,'' she says.
Eight months of the year Wilson works as associate minister of Greenhills
Church, East Kilbride; for the rest, operating under the auspices of the Church
of Scotland's national mission department, she takes off on the caravan trail
with a Yorkshire terrier to a world where she claims pastoral care is part of
everyday life.
Innate in travellers, she says, is an absence of class distinction based on
material possessions - a bond of equality enables gipsies worldwide to
recognise each other. Open with her own kind, restless and often defensive in
the settled community, she has spent the past decade (she trained first as a
Church of Scotland deaconess) with a foot uneasily in both camps.
It has been far from straightforward. When her own aspirations were nearing
fulfilment, relationships with kinsfolk were often strained. Wilson has since
led four members of her extended family to become professed Christians. Her
freewheeling gipsy temperament made formal study and routine difficult. Hardest
of all, Wilson frequently comes up against discrimination on both sides of the
divide. Sympathetically she cites the example of a Christian primary school
head forced to choose between welcoming children from a nearby site, and losing
established pupils when prejudiced parents threatened to withdraw them.
The Edinburgh-based Scottish Gipsy/Travellers Association tells a similar
story. ``We're having to deny our heritage. Even housed-up travellers are
discriminated against,'' says the association spokesman who, as a traveller
himself, believes he would cease to find work in the building trade if he were
named.
While Tilly Wilson's professional responsibilities lie first and foremost with
the spiritual welfare of her flock in East Kilbride and her people on the road,
she acts as SGTA resource person, helping to raise awareness of the travellers'
lifestyle. It is an education process she continues through her ministerial
role by accepting invitations to address rotaries and guilds several times a
month. The word gipsy, she tells her audience, is regarded as pejorative. But
in recent years it has regained some favour to distinguish between New Agers
who travel through choice, and gipsies who travel through instinct. All,
however, are subject to the same restrictions and thereby hang some sorry tales.
``I can no longer always visit my relatives and family in Scotland's 33
designated sites. Regulations curtail our freedom,'' explains Wilson. The
year-old Criminal Justice Bill means travellers have to book sites ahead.
Permission to move on depends on the outcome of local council vetting as to
conduct at the last site visited. Equally inhibiting is a stipulation that most
pitches must house only one caravan - while most travelling families possess
two. The SGTA is unhappy about high rents at campsites too. ``They run from #36
to #65 a week, while council house rents are #30 a week in some towns,'' says
the SGTA spokesman.
Scotland's gipsy community (anything between 23,000 and 40,000 - it's difficult
to keep track of housed travellers) is part of Europe's biggest minority group.
According to Isabel Fonseca's book on the history of the Roma people, out this
month*, gipsy activists are edging into the world of international diplomacy
and the gipsy identity is officially recognised by agencies of the UN.
But the author's findings on travellers' predilection for religion - she
records that they have no God and live entirely for the present - strikes Tilly
Wilson as stunningly off course. Certainly it doesn't square with the thousands
of Catholic travellers who descend on Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer every year to
honour St Sarah, patron saint of travellers. ``Even folk who profess not to be
Christian have a real sense of a power ordering the universe,'' says Wilson.
``But the majority do claim to be Christian. There's an evangelical movement, a
Protestant revival across Europe. There is spirituality and the Church of
Scotland has recognised that a more flexible approach is needed to draw it
out.''

Naming your son after you is the most stupid thing a father can do, HUGH
DOUGHERTY
has discovered
THERE are lots of dads who make the same basic mistake as me. For reference to
the births column of The Herald reveals a distressing number of proud fathers
who fall into the trap of naming a son after themselves.
Nineteen years ago, just like them, we named our first son Hugh. And it seemed
quite logical, with the name stretching back over the generations to the
Donegal roots of the clan Dochartaigh, to give it its proper title.
The problem is that Young Shug, now a second-year university student, with a
regular Saturday job, receives nearly as much mail as I do.
Regularly, I open his mail by mistake, while he returns the insult,
intentionally or otherwise, usually working on the assumption that if it looks
like a bill, it's mine, with the more interesting or hopeful going to him.
X-ray vision, holding letters up against a bright light, and speculation about
the postmark are all the tricks of the trade used to try to ensure that you
don't open Hugh Dougherty's mail, if, that is, it's the wrong Hugh Dougherty.
Who, all those years ago, as the new baby looked up at you with a milky smile,
could have imagined that such problems were on the horizon? Naming him Hugh
seemed like a good idea at the time.
But it's the events of recent weeks that have convinced me, for all time, that
naming your son after you is the most dangerous and stupid action you can take
as a father.
Basically, Young Shug has a current account with a leading building society.
And I also have an account with the same society.
A new cheque book arrives, addressed to Hugh Dougherty, my old one has expired,
and we're going off for a week in Yorkshire.
So, in all innocence, I pocket the cheque book and spend a happy week writing
cheques for the rent of a cottage, film, and sundry other holiday pursuits.
It was only when the real Hugh Dougherty went to withdraw funds from his
account with a cash card that the problem came to light. The machine referred
him to his branch where a bemused cashier spelled out the tale of woe to him.
He had been writing cheques: funds were almost at zero.
And then the penny dropped. Young Shug chequed it all out, and it transpired
that he had not been subject to a phantom withdrawal but that his father had
been writing the cheques using HIS book.
Incredibly, even though the signature was wrong, the cheque card didn't match
the account, and the account number was wrong in any case, the building society
paid out every time to the payees, to the tune of #237.
``Technically,'' a now amused cashier told her customer, ``your dad has
committed an offence.''
So it was that the reckoning came that night at home. And how he lorded it over
me.
All those lectures about managing your money were thrown back with interest.
And there was the most biting comment of all: ``Most students have to take
loans to finish their courses. But here's a case of a student giving a loan to
his father. I must be the only one in the country.''
He's never actually revealed to me what the cashier said when he arrived at the
counter with a cheque reading ``Pay Hugh Dougherty Two Hundred and Thirty Seven
Pounds, signed Hugh Dougherty,'' but I did make sure that it was the right
cheque book this time.
Take note: baby sons grow up. They get mail. They even have cheque books, and,
if they have the same name as their father, disaster is the only outcome.
Being swayed by paternal pride and naming that new son after you, can be a
costly mistake you can't afford to bank on. The best thing you can do with a
name is cheque it out for the future.

THE novelist A S Byatt said recently that what she likes most about being a
woman in the 1990s is a kind of freedom that is the opposite of waiting to be
asked to dance. But have women truly never had it so good? Are greater freedoms
and expectations not a mixed blessing? Has a woman's lot really improved? Has
feminism led us on a merry dance, albeit to our own tunes?
In her latest book, Hidden Lives, the writer Margaret Forster has produced what
appears to be an autobiographical account of her family's hardships and the
sacrifices they made, beginning with the birth of her grandmother in 1869.
Although secrets surrounding her grandmother's early life first inspired her to
delve into family history, the end result encompasses a great deal more than a
simple personal chronology.
This is a commentary on women, how their lives and aspirations have changed
over three generations. Forster provides a documentary full of relevant
details, which results in a vivid portrait of three generations of ``ordinary''
women.
She asks us to recall how bad things once were, to look at the punishing life
of a woman such as her grandmother, Margaret Ann. A working-class girl born in
1869, she accepted her lot and, despite the hardships endured, Margaret Ann
felt she had succeeded, especially in material matters such as actually being a
house owner.
Her worry for her daughters took over a great deal of her life, to the extent
she wanted to make their decisions for them, and ultimately had to accept
rather than welcome the lives they led. The last few months of her life were
overshadowed by unhappiness and this pattern repeated itself in her daughter,
Forster's mother, Lily, who ended her days consumed with envy at how her
daughter lived and the choices she had before her.
She could see how life had changed and was continuing to change, but was bitter
there appeared to be nothing for her in this improvement in the lot of women.
There is such sadness in this summing-up of a life, which in many ways
illustrated the transition between life in the forties and fifities and now.
Margaret Ann accepted her life, Forster's mother resented hers, and now the
daughter is happily doing exactly what she wants with hers.
Life is undoubtedly better for women when compared to a century ago and this
welcome change is duplicated throughout generations of women in this country,
as I found when I talked to one woman about her family's story.
Johanna MacLean was born in 1883. In 1974, her great-grand-daughter was named
Joanna in her memory. The decades separating their births have seen many
changes for women, and yet throughout the years there are also constant
parallels.
Johanna was the youngest of six girls whose father was a farm manager on the
Balranald Estate on North Uist. She had a good education and yet left school at
15, as any further education was rare for women at that time, especially in the
Highlands and islands. The most obvious job available was in domestic service,
despite both her educated status and family background, and she duly took up a
post at the Church of Scotland manse in Castlebay on Barra.
It was extremely hard work, with long hours and very little time off, but
Johanna had no real options. When she decided to move to Glasgow a couple of
years later she did so in the same line of work and was employed by the
Marshall family, the well-known food manufacturers.
PURELY by chance they discovered she was an excellent cook, and sent her to
``dough school''. When she completed her course they continued to employ her,
but as a cook, which was a much higher status than her previous post. The job
still involved long hours and hard physical work, but was better paid, offered
an outlet for her obvious talents and avoided the sheer drudgery of life as a
domestic servant.
She got married at 30 - on the 12th of the 12th, 1912 - to Angus Maclean, and
returned to North Uist. Angus had the reputation of being a ``successful
crofter'', a rare accolade and one which was achieved only through sheer hard
work. Johanna's life also became much harder as they lived in a croft without
running water, with all clothes washed by hand in water heated on a big stove,
and lighting provided by paraffin lamps.
Their first son, Archie, only lived for six months, during which time he
apparently cried constantly in pain. The healthcare available was inadequate
both in diagnosis and cure, although it is almost certain that he suffered from
pyloric stenosis, which is now easily treated.
Angus and Johanna went on to have five more children, and she died of a stroke
at 50, having suffered ill health for some time before her death. Angus died
eight years later at the age of 63, almost literally working himself to death.
Their elder daughter, Mary-Flora, was born in 1915, and considers her life easy
in comparison to her mother's, although she does remember her mother as a very
happy person. She left school initially at 14 to help at home, but returned a
year later and finally gained her Leaving Certificate at 16.
The following two years were spent looking after her ailing mother, and
continuing to run the home and care for the rest of her family after Johanna
died. By the time she was 21 her younger sister, Mary, was old enough to take
over, and Mary-Flora moved to Glasgow to train as a nurse.
She was quickly disillusioned by poor pay and dreadful working conditions, and
within a matter of weeks sat the Civil Service exam instead hoping to get a job
in the ``social'' in Greenock, looking after orphaned babies. However, the
place offered to her was in the prison service based in the Women's Prison in
Duke Street.
Her probationary year was divided into four training periods, spent in turn in
the laundry, cookhouse, cutting-room, and reception. There was a short exam at
the end of each training session and a longer exam at the end of the year, all
of which Mary-Flora passed. Now qualified, she continued to work in the
different departments as a supervisor.
She thoroughly enjoyed her time in Glasgow, finding the work ``easy'' and her
living quarters comfortable. Food and laundry were provided and there was a
great social life, although theceilidhs and dances were rather curtailed by
having to be back sharp at 11 in the Officers' Quarters. Then she met Johnnie
Macleod, and started courting. Everything was going well, until she decided to
go home on leave. Johnnie was very keen and wanted to buy her an engagement
ring before she left, but Mary-Flora persuaded him to wait until she returned.
That decision changed her life. The ferry-crossing to Uist was stormy and she
clearly remembers the discomfort she felt. She also remembers that she was
wearing a black suit and bright yellow oilskins, and she must have been a very
striking sight as she stepped onto the pier. Certainly Ewen Ferguson thought
so. He had been waiting to meet his brother, and was totally enchanted by this
beautiful girl appearing out of a miserable day. His initial reaction was ``Oh
what a topper!'' and marked the start of a whirlwind romance and over 30 years
of a very happy marriage.
Ewen was 14 years older than Mary-Flora and had trained as a ship's carpenter
at Brown's on Clydeside. He had started there at age 14 and plied his trade
until the depression of the thirties when he was forced to turn to joinery,
which he didn't enjoy. Just before the beginning of the war he helped to build
the airport at Benbecula and thereafter worked for the council, repairing
schools.
He married Mary-Flora in 1942, and when her younger sister and brother left the
Maclean croft to pursue their careers Ewen and Mary-Flora took it over. He
became a gamekeeper in 1953 and although he got his livelihood from them, he
had no respect for the landlords. He was a great poacher, and as he firmly
believed birds and fish belonged to all men his family ate a very varied diet.
Their daughter Joan was born in 1943, followed by their first son, and then in
1951 they suffered a loss which mirrored Johanna's. Their second daughter Mairi
suffered from a heart defect and lived for only three days, and the anguish of
that time is as fresh for Mary-Flora as it was 40 years ago.
There is still pain in her voice when she quietly says: ``The hardest thing was
coming home with empty arms.''
Although she was very young, Joan can still remember watching the funeral in
total shock and bewilderment. Years later, she too experienced similar pain to
her mother and grandmother when she suffered three miscarriages. None of the
women received any of the special care or counselling available now, but had to
learn to live with their grief.
Another parallel in their lives is that Joan also left school at 15, due to a
very bad bout of appendicitis. However, this in no way hampered her career as,
inspired by an aunt who was a district nurse, she had very clear ambitions. She
is currently a G-grade Practice Nurse, having sailed through a series of exams
giving her qualifications which include District, Family Planning, and
Practical Work Teacher.
As a wife, Mary - Flora undoubtedly worked hard, as at times she supplemented
the family income by working as a cook in what she termed the ``big house''.
However, she also considered herself fortunate her husband had paid employment
and they weren't scratching a living from a croft. When her children were young
her favourite mod con was a stove called the ``Modern Mistress'', which had a
tank at one end so water could be boiled with the minimum of fuss. Likewise,
Joan feels that her childhood was easy, as she didn't have to work on the croft
as she grew up. Culturally they were certainly at a bit of a loss, as there is
a dearth of cinemas and theatres in Uist.
Mary-Flora now lives in Cupar, near her two sons, as does Joan and her husband
Bill Phillips, who was an Officer of Customs and Excise until he retired last
year. The most devastating time of their lives was when they thought they
couldn't have a family, and Joan admits to feeling completely unfulfilled until
they adopted Joanna and then William.
Mary-Flora has ``a lovely wee house and garden'' with central heating and every
comfort she could ask for. Both she and her daughter enjoy their lives, and
despite any heartaches of the past are very content with what they have
achieved. Mary-Flora misses her beloved Ewen who died in 1975, but wistfully
concedes the only price she's paid for a very happy marriage is that she's
``been lonely now for 20 years''.
Grandmother and mother alike are looking forward to next year, when young
Joanna will get married and clearly wish her all the happiness they have had in
their own marriages.
When Joan looks at her daughter and remembers her grandmother, she is very
conscious of the practical changes in the past 100 years. Joanna's education
options and all the choices open to her sum up the generations in this family
and draw a very welcome conclusion. Women may still be fighting for equality
but much of the drudgery has been left behind, providing freedom and
opportunities for Joanna that her great-grandmother could never have imagined.

SINCE no politician cares to be seen standing around for too long, David
Trimble clips through the corridors of Westminster with a marching impatience
to get things done. Of course, ever since the Big Heat of last summer we have
known him to be an effective marcher, the victor of Drumcree, where a multitude
of Orangemen laid siege to a couple of fields for 48 hours while their
delegates quarrelled with the authorities about the right of way.
Even if nothing had been amiss, this was not the best of weather for all those
sombre suits and bowlers as a fiery sun increased the chances of combustion.
Determined to pursue its traditional route into County Antrim's Loyalist
citadel of Portadown, the Orange parade had been halted at Drumcree by the RUC,
intent on preventing any confrontation with a Catholic housing estate nearby.
To the crowd, that instruction was one more sell-out in a year of betrayal, and
into the fray came Trimble, be-ribboned in the manner of an Orange grandee but
holding his peppery temper in check. Abrasive by nature, Trimble has never been
known for mediation but he sensed that this was a defining moment for both
Unionism and his role within it. Adroitly he applied his lawyer's skills and,
after long and sticky negotiations, the march proceeded, but now at 10.30 in
the morning, the Catholic neighbourhood being skirted in an agreed and
unaccustomed silence.
By the time the whole event had ended it was locked in Loyalist folk memory to
endure forever. In commemoration, a Trimble medal was struck but, more
significantly, Drumcree appeared to prove that the MP for Upper Bann was at one
with the rank and file, and within weeks he had been elected to take over James
Molyneaux's stewardship of the Unionist cause. ``I got lumbered,'' he says,
with just the faintest hint of irritation, one small clue perhaps that Trimble
is not the implacable hardliner most suppose.
When the leadership came up, it was his wife who suggested he should put his
name forward as a matter of routine. ``Well, hang on a minute,'' he advised,
``if I do that you realise I might win.'' He downplays personal ambition but
there is no doubt he is pleased by the election's outcome. Yet real regret does
exist that the job now means his young family - four children aged three to 13
- will grow up seeing considerably less of him.
Quick to indignation, Trimble is 51 and although he possesses nothing of Ian
Paisley's booming caricature, it is by his muscular truculence that most of us
recognise him. But offstage, so to speak, his voice has a soothing, almost
whispery calmness as he sits at his Commons desk, appraising the future. Much
has been made of his impatient temperament, and certainly it is true that in a
matter of months he appears to have surpassed Paisley as the most influential
Protestant leading the fight to keep Northern Ireland under British control.
It is obvious, too, that his elevation to the head of the Ulster Unionist Party
shook both London and Dublin where there is a feeling that, under Trimble, the
old No Surrender cry might rise again and add its own particular mischief to
the peace process. But while securing the Union is his stark imperative,
Trimble scoffs at those who would brand him an unimaginative reactionary.
``People are far too narrow in their perception of things,'' he says. ``Of
course I am a Unionist. I am also a liberal Unionist, and a forward-thinking
Unionist. There is no conflict between these three.''
At least, no conflict in his mind, and he is far too clever to cut himself off
from options behind the scenes. But Trimble's scepticism about the actual peace
process has been evident from the start. So, too, has been his anger at
Washington's ``meddling'', although the exasperation seems to have dwindled
since his own ``valuable'' encounter with the White House at the start of the
month. So, if he is low key about the American President's visit to Belfast
this week, the reason is no longer that he thinks it out of line.
In fact Trimble is the only party leader who will be honoured with a one-to-one
meeting with Bill Clinton on Thursday evening. (John Hume will play host to the
President for several hours when he tours Derry earlier in the day, while Sinn
Fein's Gerry Adams, and the Alliance's John Alderdice are expected to meet him
at separate Belfast functions.)
But, in Trimble's view, those who expect the President to make some
progress-on-peace announcement have got it wrong. ``He has to be extremely
careful about this. It's all very well charging into Belfast and declaring, on
November 30, 1995, that peace has regained momentum. But how is that momentum
going to look on November 4, 1996, polling day in the United States. Clinton is
coming to associate himself with peace but the fact is he doesn't want to be
too closely identified now with something which might be a failure in 12
months' time.''
What the administration requires, he says, is nice, warm TV footage of the
President wandering around Ireland, attending functions and meeting people.
``Once he's got that, he will be satisfied. But he will be cautious of
investing presidential prestige in any one political strategy.'' However, even
Trimble's cynicism acknowledges one less facile motive for the hoopla. The
longer violence ceases to threaten, the more public confidence builds in doing
business with Northern Ireland, and this is where Clinton's long weekend will
be most beneficial. ``He is bringing a huge entourage which includes lots of
businessmen, and they are going to see what Belfast now can offer. Believe me,
the contrasts between the worst parts of our city and any US inner urban area
are immense. Indeed, you're a damned sight safer in Belfast than you are in
Washington.''
Trimble's suspicions about the sanctity of the ceasefire are partly conditioned
by the fact that his own security has been increased during the past year. ``I
became aware that I was being actively targeted, and while I don't think there
will be a return to the previous type of IRA campaign I'm very conscious that
if the IRA thinks there are certain people who are obstacles to its plans it
may well try to remove those targets.''
Given those circumstances he professes to see no real point in forging sounder
links with the South, and vehemently opposes the Downing Street/Dublin
Framework for Peace document which refers to cross-border institutions with
executive powers. He believes it is in the South, ``where the IRA has its
base'', that there are people who might indeed wish to kill him, and, anyway,
he has already been to Dublin, he says with the blunt finality of one who
doesn't much care if he never sets foot in the place again.
There are also those who claim David Trimble is profoundly annoyed with Mary
Robinson because he views her various goodwill missions to the North as
usurping the functions of the Queen. It seems he can accommodate the American
President on his home turf, but not the President of the Republic down the
road. Yet ask Trimble what he regards as his character flaws and he admits to
being easily infuriated by people. And his strength? That runs close to being
one and the same: ``I'm argumentative, confrontational.''
Just for a second, though, you wonder if Trimble, in his easy ascents to high
dudgeon, isn't role-playing, for sometimes when he goes into full glare there
is almost a bold irony in that unflinching eye. And take his claim that, to
date, his political career has largely been a chapter of accidents. It is true
he came late to Westminster, after lecturing in law at  Belfast's Queen's
University, where he himself had gained a First. His interest beyond the law
then was current affairs, but by the mid-seventies he was elected to the
Constitutional Convention, although ``I had to be persuaded to do that''.
In 1990 he arrived in the Commons, yet despite enjoying the adversarial nature
of Parliament he says he never really tried hard to get there. ``And now the
leadership of the Unionists - three landmarks but in none of the cases did I
initiate the events. The fact is, once I was in politics I never managed to get
out.''
TRIMBLE'S apparent uncompromising stance on most things hardened during the
seventies when he joined the Vanguard Unionist Party, to the right of the UUP.
Perhaps something of its old fundamentalist zeal stirred in him again when he
emerged in that front line of protest at Drumcree, but the summer siege has not
stopped him from declaring a wish to modify his party's special relationship
with Orangeism which is perceived as having outdated and disproportionate
influence in the UUP's administration and affairs.
``What we are hoping to do is change the way in which the Order appears to be
deeply involved in the internal workings of the party. I say appears because
the reality is otherwise. But we won't turn our backs on our own particular
heritage. I am an Orangeman and I am a Unionist, and I am not going to cease to
be either.''
Still, if Trimble is the radical moderniser he claims, he must dilute the
Orange content of the UUP so as to pursue his pluralist goal of making Unionism
user-friendly to less dogmatic nationalists. One year ago such a notion would
have seemed not merely fanciful but absurd. Even now, with a lifestyle of peace
restored to Northern Ireland, does it make any sense? ``These days most
Catholics are not old-style nationalists. The Republican movement is losing its
coherence, and latest opinion polls show that only 17% of respondents want a
united Ireland. That percentage works out at roughly half the Catholic
population.
``In fact, I believe there is a greater chance of Scotland leaving the Union
than Northern Ireland doing so. You also see old-fashioned nationalism's
decline in the South, where the principal nationalist paper, the Irish Press,
founded by De Valera, has been forced to close because of falling sales.''
But is it realistic to think the UUP could woo John Hume's SDLP voters? ``The
other weekend pollsters asked 100 delegates at the SDLP conference if John Hume
should stand at the next British General Election: 44% said yes; 44% said no,
and presumably the other 12% were undecided.
``What accounts for Hume's popularity among Catholics is that he gave a modern
gloss to nationalism, but when you strip away the rhetoric there is no
difference in objectives between Hume and Eddie McAteer whom he defeated in
1969. The shine is off nationalism, and perhaps that's part of the reason why
so many think Hume should now leave Westminster.''
Trimble warns that the paramilitaries' desire for peace may be a temporary
fling, and he remains anxious that the British Government may fudge the
decommissioning of weapons issue in a frantic bid to revive the talking. ``I'm
prepared to keep an open mind, but I have to say evidence does indicate the
ceasefire is a tactical manoeuvre on the part of Sinn Fein/IRA.
``We know the IRA is continuing to gather information. I'm told by police in my
own constituency that it is still recruiting members, and, on both sides, there
is this business of social control in the form of paramilitary beatings for
those who offend. Since the ceasefire there have been 250 such incidents,
two-thirds by Republicans, one-third by Loyalists.''
Yet in the past 12 months the mood and energy of Northern Ireland's ordinary
folk have been so transformed by momentous optimism even the most unbelieving
cannot fail to be impressed. And Trimble himself has a story which points up
another change. In Glasgow recently he was approached by a man in his thirties
who introduced himself as a Catholic from Derry, now working on the mainland as
an executive for Marks &amp; Spencer.
``He is still a Catholic with a Republican background, but he is now active
within the British economy, and his horizons are no longer the Bogside or even
nationalist Ireland.''
If peace holds out, Trimble's Derry pal may yet find himself back in the North,
with a challenging management future. But maybe that tale's real significance
is this: here was the Unionist's pugnacious champion being greeted by a native
Bogsider. Before the guns and bombs were stilled, who would have dared to
believe in the simple civility of that?

Let there be byte,
minister tells Kirk
A MINISTER has criticised the Church of Scotland for its lack of positive
thinking towards the computer revolution.
``The Church must be there on the Internet to be a positive force for good,''
claims the Rev Iain Morrison, minister at St Ninian's Craigmailen Church,
Linlithgow, in the latest issue of the Kirk's magazine Life and Work.
Mr Morrison, a member of its board of communication, says contacts between the
Church's administrative centres and its congregations have been poor.
Mr Morrison maintains the Internet is the most important communication tool
devised.
``It offers unlimited potential to communicate the gospel throughout the world.
There can, however, be no room for complacency.
``In the past, the Church has been guilty of offering a poor image in its
presentation of the good news, with badly photocopied newsletters and
ineffective posters having been its stock in trade.
``On the Internet, a professional approach is demanded, requiring high-quality
resources to be displayed for the interests of viewers.''

FIVE rare Scottish birds face an uncertain future because of the impending
closure of their home.
The capercaillies, renowned for their flamboyant courtship rituals, have lived
in captivity in a Dutch tulip garden in Banffshire for the past four years.
The birds are tame and it is highly unlikely they could survive in the wild.
Their home - The Dutch Flower Bulb Garden at Deskford - is the victim of cold,
wet Scottish springs.
It has failed to cover its costs and the disappointed owner Mr Arnoud Kwint has
returned to Holland.
The birds were hatched from imported Norwegian eggs as part of a breeding
scheme to redress the dwindling numbers of capercaillies.
The birds, two males and three females, have bred 10 chicks this year which
have been successfully introduced to the wild.
Mr Kwint said: ``I have not decided on the future of the birds yet. As they are
tame birds they cannot be released into the wild.''

SCOTLAND'S mail at Christmas was saved last night after the country's 5500
striking postal workers agreed to return to work.
They will begin clearing the huge backlog of 12 million letters and packages.
However, the agreement lasts only until the middle of January and some workers
were predicting further action then if Royal Mail management attempts to force
through changes without full agreement.
The return-to-work decision was taken at meetings in Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Although a large majority voted in favour of a return, it was clear many were
doing so reluctantly.
Last night, some staff were already back on duty, making a start on clearing
the backlog resulting from the dispute which started with a row over a change
in duties at a delivery office in Portobello, Edinburgh.
Plates that had been put over letter boxes by the Royal Mail were being removed
in the wake of the return-to-work decision. It is likely it will take staff,
working overtime, around a week to catch up.
At its height, more than 5500 workers had supported the action, which spread
quickly throughout Scotland. Negotiations between management and unions finally
led to a 14-point peace plan being hammered out.
Mr John Keggie, divisional officer for the Communications Workers' Union for
Scotland and Northern Ireland, said after yesterday's meeting in Edinburgh's
Usher Hall - where workers gave union officials a standing ovation - that
services would be restored as soon as possible.
He declared: ``This dispute was not sought by the union and there won't be any
more disruption or strikes because of the superb agreement we have achieved. We
now have a period of calm where nationally we will look at the underlying
problems.
``We can assure the customers that the experts, not the casuals with the
balaclavas who have been used, will be back on their doorsteps from tomorrow
morning and we also thank the public for their support on this.''
Mr Keggie said the underlying current was that his members feared for their
jobs. The Portobello staff were going back on a set of duties acceptable to
them. The union, he said, had agreed to suspend plans to ballot members on
taking official action against possible job losses and changes in the
deliveries system.
``This back-to-work agreement will resolve outstanding problems, open up
national negotiations, more than likely avoid any further national ballot, and
also deal with back-to-work arrangements as quickly as possible.
``We feel this could all have been avoided. It was unnecessary but hopefully
now we will resolve the long-term problems.''
Mr John Mackay, general manager for Royal Mail Scotland and Northern Ireland,
said: ``I'm dreaming of a good Christmas.''
He rejected as ``absolute rubbish'' any suggesting of humiliation for the Royal
Mail. ``There's no humiliation for anybody in this. We are very pleased good
sense has prevailed and the only winners today are our customers.''
Mr Mackay said the two sides had reached an agreement which meant an immediate
resumption of services as well as a period of calm.
``Both sides have agreed to a UK-wide review of arrangements for provision of
delivery services. A joint approach between Royal Mail and the CWU has been
agreed to look at delivery structures in the Portobello office, the flashpoint.
``We are confident that with renewed flexibility on both sides we will achieve
a staffing structure which delivers the service and efficiency improvements
which our original revised duties were designed to bring about.''
Mr Mackay gave a ``cast-iron'' guarantee that the Christmas post would not
suffer disruption. ``It's our busiest time of the year and we will be pulling
out all the stops as a team.
``We don't want a repeat of last week and we are all fired up to come to a
sensible arrangement for providing delivery services nationally, in Scotland
and in Portobello.''
Asked about disciplinary action arising from the unofficial dispute, he
replied: ``A wonderful job is done by 99.9% of staff. Passions run high at a
time like this with a very few hotheads.''
Any incidents of criminal damage, he said, would be dealt with under normal
Royal Mail disciplinary procedures.
Mr Alan Johnson, CWU joint general secretary, who had flown from London for the
Edinburgh meeting, said the problem was a UK one.
``There is an undercurrent that needs to be resolved and I think the
constructive part about the settlement today is that Royal Mail has agreed
these problems are nationwide. This is just indicative of these problems and we
will now spend six to seven weeks seeking to resolve them so we can guarantee
service to the public.''
Postal workers in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, are still on official strike and
separate talks are being held on their action. The Royal Mail is confident
staff there could return to work tomorrow.
The breakthrough came after the Royal Mail eased its hard-line stance that
staff at the Portobello office had to return and work new duties before further
talks could take place.

<TEXT>
ALLEGATIONS about the safety of nuclear weapons convoys are to be investigated
by Dumbarton District Council.
It wants to check accident procedures for the convoys, which carry warheads for
Clyde-based submarines.
The move follows a report by two Faslane peace campers who were invited to
attend the first conference under the Government's new ``open doors'' policy on
nuclear issues.
Mr Peter Callaghan and Mr Dave Dragonetti claim that Ministry of Defence
officials admitted local emergency services would be limited in their role and
isolated from the command structure.
Mr Dragonetti said yesterday: ``Snap decisions have to be made in an accident
situation - but this won't happen. They admitted that decisions would be
reached through compromise.
``Quite simply, the armed soldiers travelling with the convoy would throw a
cordon round the spot, nobody would get inside, and the accompanying fire unit
would deal with the needs of the military.''
Among the speakers at the conference in Manchester were Commodore Barry Morgan,
the Defence Ministry's nuclear policy director, Group Captain Ken Proctor, of
RAF Logistics Command, and Mr Ken Johnson, chief scientist at the Atomic
Weapons Establishment.
In their report to the council after the conference, the campers, who both have
tried to halt convoys during demonstrations, warned: ``Local authority
involvement in an accident was not clearly defined. It was not clear what
agency would ultimately take command of an accident situation and how the local
authority would fit into the command structure.''
After a 90-minute question session with the experts, the delegates reported:
``The panel's response was that there would be no overall command, that
decisions would be reached through compromise, and that local authorities would
be informed of the situation as necessary.''
They admitted leaving the conference with the view that the various departments
shared a ``genuine concern'' for the safe transportation of nuclear warheads.
However, they claimed that the experts ``reluctantly'' admitted that fire
services, though skilled, might be limited in their role during an accident.
They also claimed that the experts admitted the huge trucks carrying the
weapons had suffered from faulty braking systems but that the vehicles have
since been overhauled.
The district council is to discuss the claims with the Ministry.
Councillor Jack Duffy said yesterday: ``We are very concerned at the contents
of this report. These matters have been brought to our attention for the first
time.
``We will be seeking assurances from the MoD in connection with safety and
other issues.''

AN action group trying to keep an ancient Celtic cross in the village where it
has stood for   a millennium are taking the fight to a public inquiry which
will decide its final resting place.
The Dupplin Cross has stood in a field overlooking Forteviot in Perthshire for
more than 1000 years but experts are unanimous that the 10ft-high cross should
now be moved indoors and protected from weathering.
The cross was erected by the Scots king Kenneth McAlpine to celebrate the union
of the Scots and the Picts and the birth of modern Scotland.
The Museum of Scotland wants it to be moved to Edinburgh to become the
centrepiece of a new building - but villagers have formed an action group, the
Friends of Dupplin Cross, to keep it in Forteviot.
The Friends, led by local minister, the Rev.Colin Williamson, want the cross to
be moved to the recently refurbished parish kirk to become a focal point for
worship and a tourist attraction.
Their case has the backing of the general trustees of the Church of Scotland.
Whether their two-year campaign succeeds will be decided on December 12 at a
public inquiry ordered by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The Rev.Williamson welcomed the news of the public inquiry. He said: ``It is
high time this matter was resolved and we will put the case for local retention
with confidence.''
The inquiry ordered under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Act of 1979
will take place in Perth on December 12.

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke was urged yesterday to cut tax on whisky in his
Budget.
The GMB, the largest union in the industry, called for a phased reduction in
tax.
Mr Harry Donaldson, the union's chief negotiator for the industry, wrote to Mr
Clarke condemning last year's extra 26p on a bottle of Scotch as a tax on jobs.
He said: ``UK sales are down by some 2% and the loss in revenue to the Treasury
is also down by about #40m.
``We want you to address the fiscal inequality which is clearly depressing the
performance of an industry so vital to the British economy.''
Mr Donaldson said that the whisky industry supported 14,000 direct jobs, and
50,000 employed in cereals, production, bottling and packaging, transport and
distribution, marketing, advertising and financial services.
``The only solution that will ensure support for this national asset is the
immediate cut on duty as part of a phased reduction of spirit rates cuts so as
to reach an equitable system of alcoholic drinks being taxed according to
alcoholic content,'' he said.

A COMPANY chief said yesterday he planned to take legal action against a
leading insurance company which he claimed had reneged on a #200,000 policy for
sales director Gavin Stuart, who died suddenly.
Mr David Munro, head of Unitec Corporation Ltd, in Uddingston, Lanarkshire, had
signed the final papers and payment mandates with Eagle Star for Mr Stuart, a
close friend.
Six days later, Mr Stuart, 41, a father of four, died of a freak illness while
looking after his sick mother at her home in Cathcart, Glasgow.
Mr Stuart, who fell asleep in a chair, died after he inhaled gases from the
gastric juices of his stomach and inhaled his own vomit on August 22.
A week after the funeral, Mr Munro contacted Eagle Star but was told by a
senior executive: ``Sorry, your man was not on cover.''
Mr Munro, 36, said: ``The policy had not been underwritten so, in effect, there
was no cover.''
He said the insurance was a Keyman policy which many top companies take out on
behalf of senior executives who - should they die suddenly - would be difficult
to replace quickly, costing the business thousands of pounds in lost income.
Mr Munro said: ``Gavin's death was a terrible shock to us all. He was an
integral part of our business strategy to develop the business into the next
millennium, including the establishment of an American operation in 1998.
``The insurance was taken out simply for peace of mind. I never, in my worst
nightmares, dreamed I would ever have to call on it. It has been an enormous
personal loss.
``Once we signed everything, Eagle Star's appointed representative told us that
Gavin might need a medical.
``We heard nothing and I expected to start paying the #200-a-month premiums
straight away, because I signed the bank mandates.
``I am not being mercenary when I say I am furious with Eagle Star. They may
have a legal responsibility here - certainly a moral one.
``Would they have started taking the premiums soon after we had signed if
nothing had happened to Gavin?''
Mr Stuart's official starting date with the company was August 21 but he had
already been working as a consultant for four months, prior to starting, at the
multi-media company. It produces videos, software, and training films for
companies including Standard Life and General Accident.
The insurers offered an ex-gratia payment to Mr Stuart's widow Marci, who was
not part of the original insurance plan, and a #5000 ``gesture of goodwill'' to
Unitec.
Mr Munro said: ``I think this is a cynical move to avoid bad publicity. I would
certainly have provided for Marci if the policy had paid out in full straight
away.
``But I refuse to be treated like this by Eagle Star, so I am planning to start
a legal action based on an existing precedent in Scots law.''
Eagle Star spokesman Tony Solomon refused to say how much Mrs Stuart was
offered.
He said: ``These are tragic circumstances. Unfortunately, at the untimely event
of Mr Stuart's death, the underwriting had not taken place and therefore no
contract existed between us.
``He was asked to go for a medical examination as part of our acceptance terms.
It was between that period that he died.
``It is a very tragic set of circumstances and although in law we have no
liability, we have provided a gesture of goodwill to the family.
``Underwriting time depends on how quickly the person taking out the insurance
takes in getting an examination. That is normally a couple of weeks.''

Eight fire engines brought the outbreak under control after more than an hour.
The blaze was in a basement of the building which is part shops and part
residential.
A fire also caused damage at Thomas Muir High School, Wester Cleddans,
Bishopbriggs, Glasgow. The school will be closed today and parents have been
advised to telephone the school on 0141 762 3110 for the re-opening date.

IRISH Prime Minister John Bruton last night sent fresh proposals to London in
an attempt to break the deadlocked Northern Ireland peace process.
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams had warned earlier of a return to armed
conflict if the Government refused to set a date for all-party talks.
The move marked the third exchange of documents about the peace initiative
between   Mr Bruton and Mr John Major.
It is believed that Mr Bruton had submitted suggestions for a formula for
compromise on the differences between London and Dublin over Britain's
insistence that there has to be an IRA move towards decommissioning arms before
Sinn Fein allies can enter all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
The latest Irish document came after a London meeting of senior civil servants
from the British and Irish Governments failed on Saturday to make progress
towards settlement of the arms question.
Mr Major and Mr Bruton spoke four times on the telephone about the issue last
week and are expected to be in touch again today.
Mr Bruton sent a settlement plan to London earlier this month and later
received a reply from Downing Street.
Discussions since then have centred on those two sets of proposals and the
Irish Premier's action last night was seen as an intensification of efforts to
resolve the arms impasse.
A Dublin Government spokesman said they were working intensely towards having a
UK-Irish summit meeting at the earliest possible moment.
Downing Street confirmed that the documents had been received from Dublin and
were being studied.
Mr Adams claimed there was no expectation within the British establishment that
any of the armed groups would disarm at this time.
He said: ``None of the armed groups are going to disarm unilaterally or as part
of a precondition. The biggest achievement is the silencing of the guns.''
He said he did not know if the IRA was gearing up for a resumption of violence
and was not in a position to comment on claims that MI5 had warned Mr Major a
ceasefire breakdown was imminent because of the deadlock.
Going back to conflict was inevitable only if an alternative was not found and
the alternative was to talk, Mr Adams told London Weekend's Jonathan Dimbleby
programme.
With President Bill Clinton due in Belfast on Thursday, Mr Adams said the US
administration had accepted, in an even-handed way, Sinn Fein's contribution to
the process. It was not within his gift to persuade the IRA to do anything more
than they had done.
However, Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said a whole list of
substantial moves had been made by the Government in response to the ceasefire
and people were anxious about the refusal of the paramilitaries even to make a
gesture. What had been asked for was that a start be made to getting rid of
weapons which, it had been conceded, were redundant.
Mr Major sent Mr Bruton an overnight message on Saturday expressing his
disappointment at the impasse.
The possibility of a summit between Major and Bruton ahead of Mr Clinton's
arrival has been effectively ruled out but the Clinton visit may still turn out
to be crucial.
A US administration source was quoted as saying: ``London and Dublin are
important but Northern Ireland is the reason for this trip. This is something
he has wanted to do for a long, long time.''
One report, unconfirmed by Downing Street, which said the programme had still
to be finalised, said Mr Major and Mr Clinton would meet under Belfast's
Christmas tree in a gesture of international support for the peace process.
Senior RUC officers confirmed to the Press Association that there was a strong
possibility the two leaders would meet at the City Hall on Thursday night, when
thousands of people will watch Mr Clinton switch on the Christmas lights. The
two leaders are to have talks at Downing Street before the president travels to
Belfast and Londonderry.
However, Deputy Irish Prime Minister Dick Spring said yesterday that Mr Clinton
was not visiting Ireland with any ``tricks up his sleeve'' about the peace
process.
Mr Spring, who is also Ireland's Foreign Minister, told Irish Radio: ``We are
trying to find a way round the impasse and will continue our efforts. We are
attempting to establish a twin-track procedure, effectively as a means to an
end of establishing all-party talks. There are different opinions held by the
British and Irish Governments and we have to try to overcome those.''
On the Clinton visit, he said: ``I don't think President Clinton has any tricks
up his sleeve. He is not coming in that light and it would be very unfair if
either Government expected him to offer the solution in the context of our
present dilemma. The US want to help but the Irish and British Governments have
to find their way through this themselves.''

TWO inquiries were under way yesterday after 43 people, many of them children,
were taken to hospital after being overcome by ammonia fumes during a junior
ice hockey tournament.
Health and Safety Executive officials launched an inquiry into a leak of
ammonia gas used to freeze the rink at Inverness Ice Centre. Management also
said it was carrying out a full investigation into the incident, which happened
during an under-12 hockey match on Saturday.
Four teams had been taking part - the Comets, Black Hawks, and Tigers, from
Glasgow, and Inverness Spartans.
The leak, which happened just after 5pm, led to more than 200 people, including
players, officials, and parents, being evacuated from the          centre.
Fifteen children and three adults were detained overnight in Raigmore Hospital,
Inverness, suffering from breathing problems, but were released yesterday.
Thirteen of those detained were from the Glasgow area.
Many parents, allocated accommodation in the hospital to allow them to be near
their children, said yesterday they were angry with the evacuation procedures
at the ice centre and demanded a full investigation. One called for the centre
to remain closed until the results of the HSE investigation were made public.
The company, CAC Leisure, initially refused to answer questions over
allegations that ice rink officials had refused to abandon the tournament,
despite repeated warnings about leaking ammonia gas.
But CAC did issue a press statement late yesterday confirming an incident
involving the release of a ``limited quantity'' of ammonia gas from the ice
making plant and that the company was carrying out a full investigation.
It said: ``The escape of gas was mainly confined to the plant room, although a
small amount found its way into the main rink area. The rink was immediately
evacuated in an orderly manner without any public panic.
``The emergency services promptly attended the incident as well as the Health
and Safety Executive.
``Within 90 minutes of the leak being reported, the cause had been identified
and repaired. The ice rink reopened for business from 2pm on November 26.''
A spokesman would not answer any complaints made about the handling of the
matter, saying the company was making no further comment.
During the evacuation, Inverness Spartans' net-minder, John MacLean, 9, from
Maryburgh, near Dingwall, collapsed with breathing difficulties.
His father, Bob, said paramedics successfully revived his son with
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation after he stopped breathing. The youngster, who is
slightly asthmatic, was recovering at home yesterday after being released from
hospital.
He said: ``I felt a tight sensation across my chest and my stomach was sore.
Then I collapsed and the next thing I knew I was in an ambulance.''
Mr MacLean, manager of the Spartans' under-12 side, claimed that rink officials
had seemed ``unconcerned'' after being warned of the gas leak.
``There was no evidence of an evacuation procedure,'' he said. ``The clubs and
first aiders decided to evacuate the teams. But as we were leaving, people
started collapsing. It was frightening. Children were dropping like flies. I
shake when I think about what could have happened.''
Another parent, Mr Hamish Quinn, of Maryburgh, whose son Grant, 8, was detained
overnight in hospital, said: ``This was a most disturbing incident for all the
children. I have never heard of an incident like it before at an ice rink.''
Firefighters carried out an investigation after the building was evacuated.
Inverness Ice Centre, which opened in 1969, still uses a liquid ammonia gas
system to freeze its ice surface, unlike the majority of Scotland's 30 ice
rinks, which now use Arcton, or R22 refrigerant gas. This process too is being
phased out soon because of the presence      of CFCs.

PLAYWRIGHT Peter McDougall was recovering at home yesterday after an assault
which left him needing 20 stitches.
Greenock-born Mr McDougall, 48, author of a series of hard-hitting TV dramas
often featuring Glasgow hardmen, described how he was set upon in Great Western
Road, Glasgow, just before midnight on Saturday by thugs with knives.
The writer said he was chased into Belmont Street and left unconscious and
bleeding from head wounds. He was taken to the Western Infirmary, where his
wounds required more than 20 stitches.
Last night, Strathclyde Police confirmed they were investigating the attack.
Yesterday, with one eye closed and blood still seeping from lacerations, he was
visibly shaken as he recalled how he feared for his life.
``There was no provocation, I was walking home with my son, Willie, 23, who was
on a visit from London. I noticed a couple of guys eating chips at the corner
of Belmont Street.''
He said that, as he walked past, one of the men shouted: ``You want some of
this?''
He continued: ``I turned and he had a long blade in his hand. I yelled at
Willie to run. He took off into the main road. I ran into a crescent off
Belmont Street.
``The guy had the knife above his head. He was close behind me. I fell in front
of him and tripped him up. Then the other guy started kicking me.
``The next thing I remember, is waking up in the Western in a wheelchair. The
random     way this happened was really chilling.''
McDougall began writing plays in his early 20s. His best-known dramas include
Down Among the Big Boys, which starred Billy Connolly; Just Another Saturday,
about an Orange Walk which won the Prix Italia film award in 1975; Jimmy
Boyle's A Sense of Freedom; and Down Where the Buffalo Go.

THE standard of Scottish football, currently the cause of anxiety throughout
the game, could be improved by putting players under more stress, a
psychologist claimed yesterday.
Dr Howard Khan, an organisational psychologist at Heriot Watt University in
Edinburgh, and Ms Sarah Hurry, Scotland's top women's table-tennis player,
undertook a nine-month study of the effects of stress on players.
Dr Khan was due to deliver their findings at The British Psychological Society
(Scottish branch) conference in Crieff on Friday but could not attend through
illness.
Questionnaires about stress were distributed to 512 football players in the
Scottish Premier and First Divisions and the results are based on the comments
of 185 players who returned the forms.
They show that players were most stressed by the desire to play well, keep a
place in the team, and get good results for their club. ``Switching off'' from
unfavourable press reports, bad refereeing decisions, and abuse from the crowd
also featured as stressful factors.
However, Dr Khan said Scottish players were not being put under enough stress,
or pressure, and could improve their performance with professional advice.
He said players generally displayed lower stress levels than most of the fans
watching a match.
Dr Khan said: ``Players seem to have a pretty easy life. They train for a
couple of hours every day, play for another couple of hours on Saturdays, and
have a relatively secure job.
``Their performance may improve if they faced increasing demands or their jobs
were less secure. People need to be under pressure to do a reasonable job.
Footballers do not seem to be under enough pressure.''
Dr Khan outlined a series of measures which could revitalise Scottish football
including giving sports psychologists a more active role in helping players and
introducing a ratings system for players and teams to provide achievement
targets.
Players should be given feedback and encouragement.

THE Irish Government is to raise a pre-divorce referendum intervention by the
Pope with the Vatican.
Deputy premier Dick Spring, speaking yesterday after confirmation of the narrow
result in favour of the divorce ban, said he would be speaking soon with the
Papal Nuncio in Dublin.
The Pope angered Irish Ministers promoting divorce reform with his
thinly-veiled ``vote no'' message issued 28 hours before polling day last week.
Talking to Irish Catholic pilgrims in Rome, the pontiff urged ``reflection on
the unbreakable bond of marriage''.
Mr Spring said: ``I will be having some discussions with the new representative
of the Vatican and I am sure that will form part of them.''
Mr Spring added that he did not believe the Pope's comments affected the
outcome of the referendum.
Mr Spring promised early moves to enact the referendum call for divorce in the
light of what he called ``a huge change in social attitudes in Ireland''.
Friday's poll will go down in the history books as the formal ending of an era
in which the Founding Fathers of the Irish State such as Eamon de Valera
colluded with powerful prelates such as Archbishop John Charles McQaid of
Dublin to create a political system whose core values were founded on Catholic
social ethics.
One Vatican expert yesterday compared the result in Ireland as a blow to the
Pope as equal in severity to Lech Walesa's presidential defeat in Poland.

<HEADLINE>Scot advises on road safety in Syria</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHELL has turned to a Scot for help in cutting the high level of road accidents
among its drivers in Syria.
Safety expert Stewart Wight - the first director of the Scottish Road Safety
Campaign - was approached by the company to produce a 36-page guide for its
Middle East employees.
Entitled Expect the Unexpected - the booklet is intended to reduce the high
accident rate in the wealthy oil state, where there is scant regard for driving
regulations, said Mr Wight.
``It is not uncommon to find a horse and cart coming towards you on the fast
lane of the motorway as the rider makes his way to the quickest exit for his
destination,'' he said.
Mr Wight, 44, who is based in the Grampian village of Laurencekirk, added:
``They have jumped literally from the camel to the car, and powerful modern
cars at that.
``They do not have the knowledge which has evolved to us through decades of
driving and being aware of safety issues.
``They exist on a welter of misconceptions and folklore. One of them is that
you do not leave a space between yourself and the car in front because someone
else will just nick it.
``When I explained that you should just leave a bigger space to compensate,
their logic was that you would end up going backwards.''
Mr Wight has developed a highly successful business based on his road-safety
knowledge and skill in training professional drivers in everything from
anti-kidnap manoeuvres to off-road driving.
The booklet is aimed at British personnel being relocated to Syria but is
already being requested by foreign embassies based there.
``It gives them some knowledge of what they are going to face. They need to
know the problems they are likely to encounter,'' said Mr Wight.
These include no markings around road works, virtually no use of indicators,
animals wandering freely, and tractors sharing the motorways with
top-of-the-range Mercedes cars.
``Indeed, there are so many hazards, Shell has virtually forbidden night-time
driving,'' said Mr Wight.
Syria presently has a highway code consisting of an A3 sheet of paper with
rules on one side and road signs on the other.
``It contains such things as do not drive a car without doors and do not wash
your car in a public place,'' said Mr Wight.
He has high hopes that the Syrian Government, which has become more aware of
road-safety issues since its president's son was killed in a crash, will look
at the possibilities offered by the booklet.
``It could easily be amended to form the basis of a Highway Code,'' claimed Mr
Wight.
His company, Safedrive UK, has previously printed booklets in Arabic, including
one aimed at improving road safety among children. It also operates a mobile
classroom to get the safety message across.

THE Armed Forces no longer have the capacity to launch a Falklands-style
operation, according to a highly classified Government report.
An investigation by experts reporting directly to Defence Secretary Michael
Portillo discovered that Britain no longer has the shipping needed to carry out
an operation on the same scale as in 1982, the Press Association revealed
yesterday.
The crisis is intensified by a delay in orders because of a row over tenders
for two amphibious assault ships each priced at #100m more than expected.
The investigation, by the newly-formed Directorate of Operational Capability,
whose existence is known only to a small group of senior Ministry of Defence
figures, confirmed what Royal Navy chiefs have feared privately for years.
The directorate targeted a number of areas to give Mr Portillo a snapshot of
Britain's ability to meet crises around the world.
The Army's 5 Airborne Brigade and the Royal Marines' 3 Commando Brigade
received the seal of approval.
However, the investigation into amphibious shipping unearthed disturbing proof
that Britain did not have the vessels to respond to a sudden, distant crisis
such as the Falklands, which requires a large-scale naval operation.
The two existing amphibious assault ships, HMS Intrepid and HMS Fearless,
played key roles in the Falklands conflict.
Intrepid is now in mothballs and the Navy has no confidence that the 12,500-ton
ship can even float until trials are carried out and the steam engines fired
up. There is no prospect of trials as there is no money to carry them out.
Fearless is 30 years old and undergoing yet another refit. She remains
steam-driven and has an ageing communications system.
Orders for two replacement ships, which were expected by next month, will be
delayed at least until March because of acrimonious negotiations between the
Ministry of Defence and the sole bidder, VSEL of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.
The tenders, #100m more for each ship than the Ministry expected, shocked
contracts staff, who are now trying to beat down the VSEL price.
The sale of the Falklands flagship HMS Hermes to the Indian Navy eventually
forced the Ministry to order a helicopter assault ship.
However, the 20,500-ton HMS Ocean will not enter service until 1997 at the
earliest, after being holed during her launch in October.
The directorate also found that using one of the Navy's three aircraft carriers
as a stop-gap was not a viable alternative as it could only accommodate half
the number of armed commandos and helicopters as HMS Ocean.
The report confirms years of concern among defence experts and merchant seamen
about the scale of the run-down of the British-flagged merchant fleet.
Recently, a number of merchant ships have had to be hired for amphibious
training exercises in Norway.
Despite concerns over amphibious capability, defence sources emphasised that
the current defence of the Falklands was not at risk because the islands'
military infrastructure had been built up.

A SCOTTISH diplomat has been shot in the neck during a high-speed chase in
Kenya as he tried to shake off a gang of car-jackers.
A spokeswoman for the British High Commission in Kenya said Mr Graeme Gibson,
43, from Glasgow, who is second secretary (commercial), had been seriously
wounded in the incident.
Mr Gibson was attacked on the outskirts of the capital Nairobi as he drove home
in his Land Rover Discovery at about 8.30pm on Friday.
A gang in a stolen Peugeot tried to run him off the road but after a chase they
shot him several times, according to the Sunday Nation newspaper.
Mr Gibson was wounded in the neck and lost control of his car which crashed
into a gate.
A police patrol took Mr Gibson to Nairobi Hospital's intensive care unit. The
gang made their getaway after hijacking another car, said police. No arrests
were made.
British High Commissioner Simon Hemans said Mr Gibson, who was driving home
from a commercial reception, took a circuitous route to see whether he was
really being followed.
``They suddenly overtook him, pulled in front of him, one man leapt out and
fired straight at him. Then the car sped off and he was left wounded in his
car,'' he said.
Discovery vehicles were particularly the target of armed hijackers at the
moment, he said. Normally, there was no violence.
``We are still thinking that this was a failed hijack, that the hijackers
thought that they had somehow signalled him to stop, and he hadn't stopped, so
they shot. But he himself is not aware of any signal that he should stop and
hand over his vehicle.''
Mr Hemans said he was concerned for his staff, particularly those with
four-wheel drive vehicles, though the attacks were not restricted to diplomats.
``This is not an anti-foreigner campaign, it's a general phenomenon at the
moment but of course we are concerned.''
He said he had spoken to senior police officers and was satisfied that they
were doing enough.
``They have found the car that the attackers were in when they attacked. It
seems that they had a traffic accident as part of their getaway, and they
abandoned the vehicle, so the police are examining that and are also able to
interview a number of people who witnessed the original attack.''
Mr Gibson has worked in Nairobi in the commission's commercial department since
last November, promoting trading links between Britain and the former East
African colony.
He joined the Foreign Office in 1971 and has also served in several other
African and European countries. He became a second secretary, a middle-ranking
diplomatic position, in 1990.
Twice-married, Mr Gibson's second wife Pamela was at his bedside yesterday. He
has two teenage daughters from his first marriage.
The shooting is the second assault on a diplomat in Nairobi this month. India's
ambassador and his wife were taken to hospital with serious injuries earlier
this month after they were attacked at their home in the exclusive suburb of
Muthaiga, where most diplomats and wealthy businessmen live.
Kenya's Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said last week that the Government
planned to provide police protection to the homes of diplomats, but gave no
details.
q Last week, businessman Lee Bennett, 46, who left Bradford, west Yorkshire,
for South Africa in 1977, died after he was shot in a raid by three men as he
drove to his house in Johannesburg.
One man fired a gun through the driver's window of Mr Bennett's car. He was hit
in the head and died in hospital next morning without regaining consciousness.

<HEADLINE>Brown stands by windfall tax</HEADLINE>

LABOUR said yesterday it would press ahead with plans for a windfall tax on the
privatised utilities despite reports that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke is about to
levy such a tax in tomorrow's Budget.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said claims that Mr Clarke was about to impose a
one-off #3000m tax on water and power companies exonerated Labour's stand.
The proposal is a key Labour economic policy but it is claimed that Mr Clarke
wants to capitalise on public resentment over ``fat cat'' utility directors. In
a BBC television interview yesterday, Trade President Ian Lang did not deny
that the windfall tax was a possibility but said Mr Clarke would not go for
``cheap, short-term gimmicks'' in his Budget.
Mr Brown said on GMTV's Sunday Programme: ``If Mr Clarke accepts my case, then
this is a further exoneration of the Labour argument, made not just this year
but since 1992, that these profits are excessive and cannot be justified.''
He said it would be an about-turn on the part of the Government, since Mr Major
had described Labour's plan as ``foolish and stupid''.
Mr Brown denied, however, that such a move would shut the door on Labour's
proposals.
``No, I don't think it would,'' he said. ``We will have to look at the
Government's proposals but if the Greenbury Committee on top people's salaries
is anything to go by, the Government never does enough. Anything that is done
is too little, too late. I do not believe that the case for a windfall tax will
disappear after the Budget.''
He confirmed that Labour was considering plans to make another bid to cut VAT
on fuel. Last year, the party defeated the Government on the issue and
prevented a 9.5% VAT increase on gas and electricity bills.
``We are considering that because VAT on fuel is the most unpopular tax we have
seen and we stopped it going up from eight to 17.5%. I would like to see VAT on
fuel go even lower. We cannot get it down to zero but we could get it down to
five per cent and that is one of my long-term objectives.''
Towards the end of last week and again over the weekend, Treasury officials
moved to dampen speculation about substantial tax cuts in the Budget, claiming
there might be just 1p off the basic rate.
This could be accompanied by a rise in tax thresholds to increase incentives
for the lower paid and modest reductions in inheritance tax and capital gains
tax.
However, sources close to the Chancellor have been reported as saying that his
room for manoeuvre is severely limited by spiralling public borrowing.
A limited tax-cutting Budget could disappoint those Tory back benchers who are
pressing for a substantial reduction in the basic rate in what could be the
last Budget before the next General Election.

POLICE and safety officials are investigating a wall collapse in which one
worker died and another was injured at the ICI site at Cargenbridge near
Dumfries.
The collapse killed Luke Ashford, 19, of Chester. His workmate, Anthony Rees,
46, of Essex, suffered back and knee injuries.
They were part of a contractor's squad which was demolishing a building at the
Melinex One site on Saturday. The two men became trapped under rubble when the
wall collapsed and brought down part of the roof.
Emergency services, including more than 20 firefighters, began removing the
bricks and debris by hand. Mr Rees was quickly freed from the rubble and
admitted to Dumfries Infirmary.
Another worker was taken to the hospital suffering from shock but was released
after examination. It was hours before workers were able to free the dead man
from the debris.
Building control officials from Dumfries and Galloway regional council visited
the scene and the Health and Safety Executive were informed.

earlier this year.
In Craigton Mr Davidson won by 29 votes to six and in Crookston by 35 votes to

Drugs seized
POLICE said yesterday that they had made a ``substantial seizure'' of
controlled drugs at an undisclosed address in Dumfries. Two men will appear at
the town's sheriff court today.
Body on beach

Scots' share
BBC Scotland viewers raised #730,000 for the 16th annual Children in Need
appeal after an evening of televised fund-raising events across the country.
Nationwide the seven-hour television and radio event raised more than #11m,
slightly less than last year.
Ward blaze
POLICE are investigating a fire which broke out shortly before midnight on
Saturday in a ward at Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria. Twenty-three

firefighters arrived. A section of the ward used for medical rehabilitation was
damaged and the hospital said it expected it would reopen within 48 hours.
Police said a patient had been interviewed about the incident.
Heart help
GLASGOW'S Royal Infirmary and Kirkcaldy's Victoria Hospital have each received
#25,000 from the British Heart Foundation. The hospitals are among 19 across
the UK to be given cash in a bid to prevent sudden cardiac deaths. The

SERIAL killer Rosemary West is starting to come to terms with having to spend
the rest of her life behind bars, according to a prison source.
The 41-year-old, convicted last week of the killings of 10 young women and
girls, was in a state of shock when taken to Durham Jail on Thursday.
She was devastated as she was placed in her cell in the top security section of
the jail known as ``She Wing'', which houses long-term women prisoners
including Moors murderer Myra Hindley.
According to the source, she spent her first 24 hours sitting on her iron-frame
bed looking blankly at the floor and walls. The source said: ``In that time,
she didn't eat anything, sleep or speak to anyone. It was as if her mind was in
turmoil.''
However, the source said she had since spoken to a prison officer and had
started eating, an indication that she was coming to terms with her situation.
The source dismissed claims that West had struck up a relationship with
Hindley, 51, while on remand awaiting trial.
There have been claims they made unsupervised visits to each other's cells and
prayed together in the prison's chapel, but the source described this as
``absolute rubbish''.

IN a historic first, two women will lead Aberdeen towards the millennium when
the new unitary authority takes control of the city in April.
Mrs Margaret Farquhar, 65, a veteran Labour councillor and the current policy
convener, was expected to become the city's first female Lord Provost, so it
was something of a surprise when Mrs Margaret Smith, 64, who has never
previously held a major position, was elected to the most powerful post on the
new council.
She was chosen by a single vote at the Labour Group's closed-door session,
defeating local political stalwarts Jim Wyness, the present Lord Provost, and
former regional convener Bob Middleton.
Mrs Smith, a former community education worker, is the council's women's and
equal opportunities committee convener, but the two Margarets, Scotland's only
two female council leaders, do not intend to create a women's rights council.
Women's rights will, of course, take its place but they see their role as
trying to provide Aberdeen with the best possible services - without breaching
Scottish Office guidelines.
Indeed they are determined not to give the Scottish Secretary any opportunity
to call the council irresponsible. They are examining whether any cuts are
necessary because of funding reductions but see it is important to explain to
Aberdonians their view that it is Government cuts, not local authority
management, which is causing difficulties.
``I think we will make as good a job of it as any council,'' said Mrs Smith.
``I am encouraged by the co-operation between the councils in looking at the
whole funding problem and realising the cuts are coming from central
Government, and that, in doing our duty to the people of our cities, we are
going to have to make a job of it.
``I think we can. It won't be very easy but I hope we are able to explain to
people what we are doing and why we are doing it in plenty of time so the
citizens of Aberdeen know exactly the position we are in.''
Mrs Farquhar agrees: ``The Secretary of State has cut the budget figures for
Aberdeen and other cities, and we now have to consider whether there will be
cuts and how we can work on the budget we are getting.
``At the end of the day, we have to work on the figures the Scottish Office
give us.
``We have always had a raw deal in Aberdeen but we have always come up trumps
at the end of the day and we will do it again.
``We will behave responsibly and the way we will do that is put the blame
fairly and squarely where it lies and that is with the Scottish Office.
``We are being told time and time again that local authorities are being
irresponsible but before we spend any money, we look very carefully first and
we will continue to do that. That applies on the staffing side, which is often
what is attacked.
``Aberdeen is always seen as a prosperous city and many people are prosperous
but, equally, we have people who are not prosperous. Prices are higher - food
prices, house prices - but we are always totally judged on this prosperity. It
is felt we don't need as much money, we can get it from other sources.''
Mrs Smith said: ``There are a lot of people right on the borderline and new
legislation on benefits will mean even more. We have our fair share of people
who are homeless, people who are very poor, people who are on the breadline.
``Aberdeen has more than its fair share of low pay, particularly for women. The
gap between average earnings and the bottom earnings is enormous.''
The existing district and regional councils have not enjoyed a harmonious
relationship but Mrs Farquhar, who has been involved in discussions over staff
transfers, is encouraged by the early signs.
``I am hoping we can get on together and there are signs that there can be
co-operation,'' she said. ``There will be certain functions which will be
jointly managed by the three councils.''
Mrs Smith said: ``A large number of people came to the consultation meetings,
which showed that people are prepared to turn out and talk about the city they
want to see, from all sections of the community including from the private
sector.''

<HEADLINE>Mother to be `given a say' in adoption Mental illness `no bar to her interests'</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE McKAIN Law Correspondent</BYLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

THE courts have stepped in to protect the legal rights of a severely disturbed
mother whose one-year-old baby is on the verge of being adopted.
Strathclyde region, which wishes to dispense with the 28-year-old woman's
consent to the adoption, objected to someone being appointed to look after the
mother's interests.
However, the Sheriff Principal for Glasgow and Strathkelvin has ruled that the
interests of natural justice demand that the mother should be represented at
any future hearing.
Ms Lynn Welsh, of the Glasgow-based Legal Services Agency, a community law
centre, has been appointed as curator to ensure that the mother's interests are
safeguarded.
She said she regarded the sheriff court decision as ``very significant'': ``If
the region's position were correct, no parent with a mental illness would be
entitled to be protected when action of this kind was being taken.''
The mother was detained under the Mental Health (Scotland) Act the day before
her daughter was born and the baby was immediately taken into care by
Strathclyde's social work department last October.
Earlier this year, the region applied to Glasgow Sheriff Court for an order
freeing the child for adoption.
The court was asked to dispense with the mother's consent on the basis that she
was incapable of giving agreement because of her mental state and also that she
was withholding her consent unreasonably.
The mother, who has a history of psychiatric illness, has been diagnosed as
paranoid schizophrenic with intelligence bordering on mental deficiency.
The baby girl is in foster care and the fosterers have been identified as
potentially suitable adoptive parents.
The mother's consultant psychiatrist became concerned that she was not in a fit
state to instruct lawyers or sign legal documents and expressed his concern to
the LSA.
At a hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court in June, Miss Irene Henery from the LSA
appeared as a ``friend of the court'' and suggested that the mother's interests
should be represented by a curator.
Strathclyde region objected, but Sheriff I G Pirie decided that the appointment
of a curator was an essential preliminary step before considering the case.
Strathclyde appealed to Sheriff Principal Norman MacLeod QC, arguing that since
adoption proceedings were private, Miss Henery was not entitled to be present.
Miss Henery submitted that the court had a duty to consider the appointment of
a curator because of its concern for people like the mother who might not be
able to represent themselves or instruct a lawyer.
She added that natural justice demanded there should be an inquiry into the
mother's position.
The Sheriff Principal has now issued a ruling that Sheriff Pirie was entirely
justified in deciding to investigate the mother's capacity to agree to the
adoption order.
He declared: ``It is a question that has attached to it considerations of
natural justice. In arriving at his decision the sheriff is going to have to
consider and to weigh in the context of the interests of the child her
severance from her natural mother and, in the context of fairness to the
mother, the question whether proper consideration is being given to her loss of
parental rights and duties.''
Sheriff Principal MacLeod described the region's argument that Miss Henery's
presence at the hearing violated the privacy of adoption as ``unnecessarily
rigid''.
``Miss Henery's presence at the hearing was concerned with considerations of
natural justice and it would be regrettable if, for any reason, the door of the
court were closed in the face of natural justice.''
As far as the appointment of a curator was concerned, the sheriff had the power
at common law to appoint a curator whenever he considered justice demanded it.
The mother was sometimes detained under the Mental Health Act and sometimes
released suggesting that her mental condition fluctuated.
``It seems to me that her interests are of the very kind that a court should be
alert to protect,'' added the Sheriff Principal.
``Miss Henery's purpose in appearing (as a friend of the court) was to express
concern about the protection of a mentally impaired patient, a concern already
shared by the sheriff, and to suggest to the court a course of action that
might meet that concern. Her intervention was simply that of one offering help
to the court.
``It seems to me quite conceivable that in circumstances such as those
presented here, persons in a position to offer help to the court might include,
for example, a mother's parents, a relative, a neighbour or a social worker
independently aware of the mother's circumstances.''
He refused the region's appeal and the case will now go back to Sheriff Pirie
to consider the issue of the adoption.

<HEADLINE>Blackmail concern as CCTV video sex footage goes on sale</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975175712</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SPY-ON-THE-WALL video cameras which filmed couples having sex in doorways
yesterday sparked demands from MPs for a Government crackdown.
Their anger follows a row over the sale in video shops of ``juicy bits'' from
closed-circuit TV cameras fixed in high streets and stores to detect crime.
Footage from these cameras is set to go on sale today in the run-up to
Christmas.
One extract shows a couple having sex in a doorway, unaware they were being
watched.
Labour MP Tam Dalyell has written to Home Secretary Michael Howard urging him
to legislate to outlaw the video sales.
``This situation plainly leaves people wide open to blackmail,'' he said.
Mr Dalyell said some of his constituents in Linlithgow had recently been
compromised by such a video.
In his letter to the Home Secretary, Mr Dalyell said: ``Like other MPs, I am
hugely disturbed by what is happening. Films taken for supposedly legitimate
security purposes are being abused for purposes of gratification quite
unrelated to security.
``This brings legitimate video surveillance into disrepute. Do you not think
you should look into this with a view to legislation? At the very least, should
not these films be erased when there is plainly not going to be a security
problem?'' Mr Dalyell added.
Mr Barrie Goulding, maker of the #10.99 video Caught in the Act! said he wanted
to fuel debate about the lack of safeguards on Britain's burgeoning
surveillance industry - by showing just how far he could go in his video.
``It's voyeuristic, I wouldn't deny that,'' he said.
``It is a commercial film and I will make money from it. But there is a message
- who watches the watcher?''
Mr Roger Gale, Conservative MP for Thanet and chairman of the backbench media
committee, said: ``It is essential that the responsible use of closed-circuit
TV (CCTV) as a crime-prevention tool is not undermined by the irresponsible use
of footage showing unwitting and possibly unwilling members of the public in
embarrassing or compromising situations.
``Used properly, CCTV makes a significant contribution to crime prevention and
to seek to make capital out of material gained from these recordings plays
straight into the hands of those who believe that these cameras constitute an
infringement of civil liberties.''
He also urged the Home Office to take steps to prevent any abuse of
closed-circuit surveillance systems.
Liberal Democrat family spokeswoman Diana Maddock said: ``Material caught on
closed-circuit TV must not be used for commercial purposes. That this sale has
been allowed is a disgrace and will undermine the trust the public has in
cameras designed to cut crime.''
She said there was no law prohibiting the sale of these videos although
organisations bidding for #15m of Government money available for CCTV projects
would have to comply with a strict code of practice saying that material must
remain confidential and only for countering crime.
The issue also is being taken up by the pressure group, Liberty, whose
treasurer, Mr John Lyons, said: ``There is nothing wrong with having
closed-circuit TV to protect people and to prevent or detect shoplifting and
other crime but people certainly do not expect to be spied on in this way or
for the material to be sold as entertainment.
``The real danger is that the information could be used by unscrupulous people,
like blackmailers, where, say, an illicit affair is discovered.''
A Home Office spokesman said: ``We have not seen the video but, judging from
what has been said about it, it would have to be classified by the British
Board of Film Classification if it is being sold.''
Mr Goulding said he had thousands of hours of film and planned more releases.
Mr Goulding has courted controversy before with Executions, a film using
footage of actual killings, which he argued was a campaign against capital
punishment. Video stores voluntarily withdrew it after an outcry.
The commentary on Caught in the Act says a low-paid security guard could easily
have been tempted to supply the footage and adds: ``There is nothing to stop
him selling it, us showing it or you watching it.''
Most of the tape shows CCTV performing a valuable service by recording crimes.
Mr Goulding said all the sequences used were supplied ``legitimately'' and that
the identities of innocent people were protected.

DIVISION FOUR
A 58-19 win for Kilmarnock at Haddington, which could have been even more
substantial had six conversions not been missed, sees the Premiership IV flag
destined to be unfurled at Bellsland. With Glasgow Southern slipping up at home
to Ayr by 20-15, Kilmarnock take the title by a clear four points.
With three tries in the opening quarter-of-an-hour, Killie's victory was always
going to be substantial, as was the final try bag of Tony Finnigan - five. Both
Phil Gordon and James Adams grabbed a brace with Stuart Jenkins touching down
once.
Southern played as if accepting the championship was already sewn up. In the
first half, they conceded three penalties, which Ayr's Craig Foster slipped
home. A third success by James Dunlop seemed to have tied the score at the
break but the restart kick brought a penalty and Foster gave Ayr a 12-9 lead.
In the second half, Foster kicked one more to put Ayr 15-9 ahead after 55
minutes. Dunlop's penalties brought the score back to 15-15. But into stoppage
time Ayr's pack rumbled forward for the ball to be whipped blind to centre
Richard Good, who went over.
Gordonians won their home encounter with Langholm by 21-6 to finish third, a
point behind Southern whom they defeated home and away.
Gordonian Kane Barrie and Langholm's Ken Donaldson were ordered off for their
involvement in a mass brawl. Gordonians' Bruce Doney put over seven penalties
from eight attempts.
Edinburgh Wanderers scored 13 tries in beating Wigtownshire 81-3.

DIVISION THREE
THE shape of the top of Premiership III wasn't decided until the final day, but
there was no surprise. Already promoted, Glasgow Accies did the business at
home to Peebles, 37-12, to take the pennant. Biggar finished second, thanks to
a 64-3 win at Corstorphine.
Kirkcaldy kept on Biggar's heels with a 50-12 home win over Musselburgh but
were effectively excluded by last week's defeat at Peebles.
Accies performed as they have of late. An early try, from full back John Mason
with Calum MacGregor converting, was followed by a sag and then a late push.
Terry Greenshields scored a good try for the Borderers to make the half-time
score 7-5. Mike Davis then had two of the second-half tries. Torquil Mathewson
scored once and temporary front-row replacement David McFadzen capped a
two-minute appearance with a touchdown.
MacGregor kicked two more conversions and two penalties. Peebles had the last
word with a penalty try converted by Bell.
Corstorphine go down without a win and their final defeat, at the hands of a
larger Biggar side, was a heavy one. But it could have been worse. With 10
tries scored, usually reliable kicker Dennis Lavery managed only one conversion.
Kirkcaldy's hammering of Musselburgh was revenge for an important early season
slip-up. John Mitchell passed a milestone which few others will even sight.
With 30 points from three tries, six conversions, and a penalty he moved his
points total in league rugby through the 1000 points barrier.
At home, relegated Grangemouth beat Preston Lodge 18-11.

LABOUR is set to take up Mr Michael Forsyth's appeal for a ``constructive
approach'' to national issues by presenting him with a 10-point proposal -
including a standing committee of MPs - to tackle the drugs epidemic.
Mr John McFall, the party's Scottish Home Affairs spokesman, has drawn up a
strategy he intends to submit to the Scottish Secretary in an effort to take
the politics out of the fight to stem the drugs trade.
The scale of the problem has become such that he argues an all-party national
strategy is required, and Labour is prepared to co-operate with the Government
to build it. Drugs-related deaths in Glasgow at the weekend brought the annual
death toll to 95.
The measures Labour are considering include the establishment of a permanent
Commons standing committee on drugs that would report to the Scottish Grand
Committee, which is made up of all 72 Scots MPs and is expected to receive
greater powers under reforms due to be announced by Mr Forsyth on Wednesday.
Mr McFall said: ``The scourge of drugs effects the whole of Scottish society
and we have to adopt an approach in the public interest and that means people
working together. Labour is consulting the community and interested parties on
what the best way forward is.
``We think it is essential to take the politics out of this issue. We will seek
all-party consensus for these proposals and will be presenting them to Mr
Forsyth as part of our campaign.''
In a recent interview with The Herald, Mr Forsyth emphasised his desire for ``a
more constructive approach'' to issues in Scottish politics.
Labour proposes to:
q Consult every chief constable in Scotland to improve the co-ordination of
information and policy.
q Seek further legislation to control the use of Tempazepam. Last month, the
Government announced a ban on certain forms of the drug.
q Increase protection for witnesses by improving co-ordination between police
and housing authorities.
q Improve provision of specialist sheltered housing and training for drug users
in rehabilitation. In a significant number of drug-related deaths, homelessness
is sited as a factor.
q New legislation to tighten up laws on shotguns. Under current statutes, a
shotgun owner is not required to obtain further certificates from the chief
constable to own extra shotguns.
The strategy document is reaching its final stages and will be submitted to the
party's policy forming bodies for further consideration. However, the outline
of Mr McFall's proposals are considered ready to be taken forward and he will
seek Government support for them.
q Strathclyde's drug death toll for 1995 rose to 95 at the weekend. Ms Tracy
Mirrlees, 26, of Inchfad Drive, Drumchapel, died in hospital after being
admitted on Friday.
Early reports put last year's total number of drug deaths for the region at 95.
Later figures showed the total for Greater Glasgow was 97.

DUNDEE soccerites obviously had Hampden in mind but the rugby fanatics were at
Mayfield as High School confirmed their second division status next season.
The comprehensive victory over West made sure of that. It was all about
motivation and the scoreline in that sector was Dundee a lot, West none.
It was difficult for West to put everything into the game, they already knew
they were safe. But pride is still a powerful ally and West coach Sandy Service
felt his boys did not display as much of that ingredient as he would have hoped.
One big difference between the sides was at fly-half. Chris Robinson and David
Barrett both wore the No.10 jersey, but any similarity ended there.
Dundee's Kiwi controlled the match and collected a personal tally of 21 points.
Barrett got off to a bad start by putting the kick-off straight into touch when
an effort straight down the park might have put Dundee under pressure. Instead
the home side snatched a simple three minute try from Sean Longstaff and never
looked back. Robinson converted.
Paul Rouse careered over for an unconverted try in 29 minutes, then, just after
the interval, Robinson extended the lead with a penalty.
In 53 minutes, the fly-half made it 18-0 with another penalty then he helped
himself to a try, a conversion, then penalty No.3. He kept his best kick until
the seventy-second minute when he slotted a cracker from well out on the right
touchline.
Only two minutes remained when Dundee finished it off with a slick try from
McWhirter. It was all over and the Dundee leaps of joy reflected the released
tension.

TOUR GAMES
SECOND-half tries by skipper Steve Cottrell and winger Nick Walne earned
Cambridge University a remarkable 22-14 victory over Western Samoa on Saturday.
The tourists, fielding 11 internationalists and eight of the side that drew
15-15 with Scotland, were well below par and never came to terms with
enthusiastic opponents.
Rob Ashforth, the former England Colts full back now playing fly-half, landed
three penalty goals and a long-range drop goal to give Cambridge a 12-9 lead.
Western Samoa had rarely threatened and their points came from two penalty
goals by Cameron Burns and
But, in the second half, the students upped the pace and began to find holes in
the tourists' midfield, scoring two tries, one from New Zealander Cottrell, the
second from Walne.
At last, Western Samoa stirred themselves and five minutes of incessant
pressure, the ball going first to one wing and then the other, led to a try,
which was scored by Patu, but it was too little too late.
q.ALAN McGowan kicked Leinster to a comfortable 15-6 victory over a
disappointing Transvaal side in the first of the South African province's two
games in Ireland at Donnybrook on Saturday.
The fly-half landed five penalties as below-strength Transvaal were made to pay
for a series of errors in a game devoid of tries. Leinster were  6-0 ahead at
the break, and although the tourists got on the scoreboard, McGowan's
consistency clinched victory.

Skater stabbed
BERLIN: Japanese skater Nami Nemoto was stabbed by a group of six youths in
Berlin yesterday as she was warming up for a World Cup speed skating event.
Nemoto, 20, was jogging outside the Hohenschnhausen rink to warm up for her
3000 metres race when she was attacked, but thick clothing saved her from
serious harm and she was able to compete. Police could not give any motive for
the attack.
Leader sworn in
TBILISI: Former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze was sworn in as
Georgia's president yesterday and promised to bring peace and prosperity to the
volatile Transcaucasus state. Shevardnadze, 67, who survived an assassination
attempt in August, won 75% of the vote in this month's presidential election.
Coins minted
BEIJING: China's central bank will next month issue one silver and two gold
coins carrying pictures of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to mark the return of
Hong Kong in 1997.
Gipsy claim
ROME: Police are investigating the case of a nine-year-old gipsy girl who said
a passer-by broke her wrists to punish her because he thought she stole his
wallet. The move comes as Italy plans tough new laws on illegal aliens and the
city of Rome plans to move gipsy communities towards the outskirts.
King in clear
MADRID: Spain's chief prosecutor has dismissed reports linking King Juan Carlos
to two disgraced financiers who allegedly tried to blackmail him over favours
they had provided to the crown. Carlos Granados said he found no evidence of a
blackmail attempt and said the king was not involved in dealings between his
friend and former personal manager Manuel Prado and financier Javier de la Rosa.

INTERNATIONAL scientists and government experts are set to agree finally and
formally this week that man-made global warming is already a reality.
The view of hundreds of scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) is that recent temperature rises cannot be explained away by
natural climatic variations and there is a ``detectable'' human influence on
the world's weather.
However officials fear that the Geneva-based IPCC's ``scientific working
group'', which meets in Madrid tomorrow to finalise its report to governments,
will still come under pressure from energy interest groups to back away from
that conclusion.
``For the first time we're saying that there is human influence on climate, in
the past we've said we're not quite sure - that's a qualitative change,'' said
IPCC executive secretary Narasimhan Sundararaman. ``I don't think people are
going to let that go without a challenge,'' he added.
In their first report in 1990, the IPCC scientists noted a substantial increase
in man-made ``greenhouse gases'' such as carbon dioxide and methane but said it
was too early to say with certainty whether they were responsible for the rise
in average temperatures over the past century.
In the last draft of its new report, the scientific working group notes that
greenhouse gas concentrations are continuing to rise, that recent years have
been the warmest since at least 1860, and that its own ability to predict
climate change through computer modelling has improved.
``Emerging evidence points towards a detectable human influence on climate,''
says the draft report, which will be presented to an inter-governmental
conference of the IPCC in Rome on December 11-15.
Reports on the two other IPCC working groups, on impacts and solutions, have
already leaked out. In them, the IPCC experts predict that as temperature and
sea-levels continue to rise, some small island states could all but disappear,
many of the world's poorest people will see their already arid lands become
deserts, and entire forest types could be wiped out. Floods and droughts will
become more common.-Reuter.

Boroughmuir 40, Heriot's 40
THE eyes had it at the end of a pulsating match that produced four tries, four
conversions, four penalties, and 40 points apiece. Bruce Hay and Henry Edwards
looked down at the grass, perhaps sensing that Boroughmuir had now lost their
chance of glory by failing to despatch Heriot's.
And then the sad news came that Iwan Tukalo is to call it a day after the
leagues have finished. ``I've had a great innings,'' said Tukalo, a double try
scorer on the day. ``Yes, I've had my injuries, too, but I don't have any
regrets from my career. There are a lot of young guys putting pressure on me
and I am finding it harder.
``It's sad that we've blown it today. We have blown it haven't we?'' Maybe, but
the two tries, and the instinctive jink from left to right off his left peg
that has been his trademark over the years, were a joy to behold and a reminder
of a great talent that has been around since 1981. Have a great retirement,
Iwan. Same to you, Kenny Milne.
Before the match, a lonely and limping Darren George provided a sad sight for
the home side, and with his injury came the inevitable problem of producing his
kind of possession at the lineout. So, both sides came to Meggetland with
running rugby in mind, and the scores flowed.
First, Teri Rahui and Bryan Easson swopped penalties before a Heriot's attack
swept upfield and Hugh Gilmour swooped in from close range through a ruck of
defenders. It's difficult making your mind up about Hugh Gilmour. He has size,
and fabulous pace, but, like the young Craig Joiner, his aggression seems to
stop in contact.
Joiner grew up on Saturday with a stormer. The realisation that there are few
as strong as him no doubt giving him real confidence coming back from injury,
and Gilmour needs a dose of the same medicine if he isn't to end up as one of
Scotland's greatest ever wastes of talent.
Not content with being 10-3 down, Boroughmuir came back with a try from Tukalo
after Sean Lineen had veered out and given the winger a sniff of the line. A
sniff's enough. What do we make of Lineen then? The best centre playing in
Scotland? Undoubtedly.
Still worth a place in the national team? If he wanted it, yes.
But I rather suspect that he may be thinking of quitting after this season.
``Jeez, it gets harder. I'm too old for this,'' he said afterwards, holding a
pint pot in his hand.
Gilmour retaliated with his second, a long-range one after Stuart Lang had
started it from his own line, David Stoddart made further ground, and Gilmour
roared away from 50 metres. There's the contrast of the man. Absolutely
uncatchable. Lineen replied with a scramble through some dreadful tackling, and
Lang barged over on the line for Heriot's.
So we had arrived at half-time, breathless after five tries, but questioning
whether it had been the great handling, or some slipshod tackling, that had
made the day.
Some good players were having quiet afternoons, notably Stuart Reid and Fergus
Wallace in the 'Muir pack, which had an unconvincing look to it, in spite of
its ability to get the ball back when the backs went up the middle.
An intriguing little duel took place between Graham Beveridge and Fraser
McMillan, two very good scrum halves, and Beveridge will need to learn to be
less obvious in the darker aspects of unsettling his opponent if he is to
escape the wrath of the best refs. That's all I'm saying.
More kicks followed, then the ball was spun left to Tukalo who, yes, came in
off his left foot to dance over. With Easson's conversion it was a staggering
30 points apiece.
A kick each from Rahui and Easson took it to 33, and when a Stuart Reid charge
was halted and a slow maul formed, the ball was popped out to Lineen, who
coasted through an imaginary gap and popped the ball down. Absolutely shocking
defence, frankly.
Would this mean Boroughmuir could still be title contenders? Not if Cameron
Glasgow had his way, and he romped home under the posts to pull the margin to
two points, Rahui's conversion levelling the scores.
It had been a great day's fare for the paying spectators, but there was no
hiding the sense of disappointment in the Boroughmuir camp as they should have
beaten Heriot's but too often lost the ball. There's a lesson there somewhere.
Just before the end, a Boroughmuir replacement came on. ``He's really good
looking isn't he,'' said the journalist beside me. Luckily, she was a girl.
Times are changing.
Boroughmuir - N Mardon; A McLean, D Laird, S Lineen, I Tukalo; B Easson, G
Beveridge; G Wilson, N Dickson, L Graham, A Cadzow, D Burns, F Wallace, S Reid,
J McKinlay.
Heriot's - S Lang; C Glasgow, D Stoddart, G Lawrie, H Gilmour; T Rahui, F
McMillan; M Livingstone, K Milne, S Paul, P Young, S Gilmour, S Elliot, T
McVie, G Dall.
Referee - R Megson (Edinburgh Wanderers).

ISRAELI authorities may have needlessly kept hundreds of Holocaust survivors in
psychiatric hospitals for nearly half a century, health officials admitted
today.
Dr Motti Mark, head of the Health Ministry's mental health department, said 900
people - nearly one-fifth of Israel's institutionalised mental patients - were
Holocaust survivors.
Most, he said, arrived without families in the late 1940s and were immediately
taken to hospital. With more sophisticated treatment, he admitted, some might
have been able to begin normal lives.
The disclosure followed a report on Israeli television which alleged systematic
negligence for decades in dealing with the trauma of some immigrants who
arrived after surviving the Second World War slaughter of millions of Jews.
``It definitely did not have to be like this,'' said Mark. ``These people came
to Israel alone and got help, but when the treatment ended there was nobody
outside to receive and support them . . . We, Israeli society, did not become
their families.''
q Israeli police are interrogating at least two rabbis suspected of issuing a
religious ruling that justified the killing of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
Assassin Yigal Amir reportedly believed Rabin was under such a ruling because
of his policy of turning over land to the Palestinians. The rabbis could be
charged with inciting murder.-AP.

CHIEF Minister just failed to land a gamble at Newcastle on Saturday, coming
late in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle but just failing to catch Padre Mio.
The bookmakers were well pleased that Tom Dyer's Chief Minister finished
second, as many punters had plunged heavily on the 15-8 favourite.
``He ran to his best form and might have won given another 100 yards,'' said
the Tayside trainer.
Chief Minister may not have won yet this season, but his recent third at
Cheltenham and Saturday's second place, earned a total of #11,000.
q.COULDNT Be Better produced a fine display of jumping to land the Hennessy
Gold Cup after One Man's chances of running were washed away by heavy rain.
The winner was well ridden by understudy Dean Gallagher to secure the #50,000
prize, the most important success so far for either jockey or trainer Charlie
Brooks.
Couldnt Be Better's task was made easier by One Man and Young Hustler's
defection.
``I've been so close in so many big races. To ride in and win the Hennessy is a
dream come true,'' said Gallagher.
q.JODAMI, Cheltenham Gold Cup winner in 1993, is assured of a tremendous
welcome at Kelso today when he runs in the Hinchliffe Champion Chase.
Peter Beaumont's 10-year-old was to have run in the Hennessy, but was withdrawn
because of the threat of firm ground and having to take on One Man, who beat
him at Ayr two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE>Parachute bombs kill 37 in Kabul</HEADLINE>

REBEL jets bombed residential areas of Kabul today, killing at least 37 people
and wounding more than 140 in the heaviest air raid on the besieged Afghan
capital in more than a year.
A Defence Ministry spokesman blamed rebel Islamic Taleban militia, who seek to
topple President Burhanuddin Rabbani, for the attack. At least nine bombs were
dropped by SU-22 planes, none hitting a military target, he said.
A ministry statement also accused neighbouring Pakistan of responsibility,
saying it had ``strong evidence'' indicating Islamabad's technical and
financial aid in repairing the SU-type jets Taleban seized from the western
town of Herat in August.
Pakistan rejected the charge. ``This is utter nonsense,'' said a Foreign
Ministry spokesman in Islamabad.
An Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman said the Taleban used three SU-22 bombers
in the air raid, making two passes over the city 15 minutes apart.
At least 12 people died when one bomb destroyed three homes and severely
damaged four others in the western suburb of Wazir Abad. Neighbours said the
device was a 1100lb parachute bomb that exploded in the air above the suburb.
The parachute bombs are designed to explode about 90ft above ground, spraying
their target with shrapnel.
A similar bomb killed seven people in a three-storey mud-brick building, where
neighbours said three families were living. Rescuers dug frantically through
the rubble but found only corpses, including the bodies of two infants.
``This is the most barbaric war,'' cried one neighbour as he watched the
rescuers cover a two-year-old child dragged from the dust. ``The Taleban are
more cruel than Ghengis Khan. Even the Russians were not as bad as these
people.''
``This bombing is the biggest crime,'' said another resident, Najim Khan. ``God
will not forgive those who committed this.''
Doctors in Kabul's four main hospitals said they treated about 150 bomb
victims, eight of whom died later, bringing the death toll to 37. The air raid
followed two nights of heavy fighting between the Taleban and government
fighters.
A Western analyst said the air attack could be a response to recent Taleban
setbacks, although it was hard to see any military logic in the raid.
The Taleban is attacking Kabul on at least four fronts in a bid to capture the
city and force Rabbani from power. It has also imposed an energy blockade on
Kabul in an apparent attempt to freeze the defenders into submission over the
coming winter.
The Taleban has rejected UN proposals for a multi-party council to replace the
government and has pledged to occupy Kabul by force.

THE shadowy militant group holding four Westerners in Kashmir today repeated
its threat to kill them if India did not meet their demands as soon as possible.
An Indian Government official said: ``They warned that if government does not
concede their demands as soon as possible they will execute four Western
tourists.''
Indian Government negotiators made contact with the Al-Faran militant group
today after a gap of three days.
``Government representatives had meaningful talks with Al-Faran this afternoon
and hopefully talks will continue,'' said K B Jandial, a spokesman for the
government of Jammu and Kashmir.
Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells, American Donald Hutchings, and German Dirk
Hasert were kidnapped by Al-Faran guerrillas in July. A fourth captive,
American John Childs escaped. A fifth, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, was
found beheaded in a remote Kashmiri forest on August 13.
Al-Faran, unknown before the kidnappings, has demanded the release of 15 jailed
separatists, including three Pakistanis from the Harkat-ul-Ansar militant
group, in return for freeing the hostages.
India has refused to bow to the militants' demands and has ruled out a rescue
raid for fear of endangering the hostages' lives.
Authorities say they believe the four tourists are unharmed and their captors
might be considering releasing them.
``This is just pressure tactics, hopes for the captives' freedom are high,''
said an official.
The hostages have been sighted from time to time, as their abductors lead them
through isolated villages.
Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, is torn by a five-year separatist
rebellion in which more than 20,000 people have died.-Reuter/AP.

KELSO ensured they would still be playing Division Two rugby next season with
an emphatic win over relegated Stewart's Melville at Poynder Park. It was a
relieved Eric Paxton who watched his team put the luckless Colleges to the
sword.
The Borderers' earlier encounter with Stewart's Melville was the first in a run
of victories which brought them out of the doldrums, and on Saturday they
quickly set about making Colleges the only side to lose to them twice.
Kelso's opening passage of play set the scene - their back row making deep
inroads into the Stewart's Melville defence.
Stuart Bennet's commitment brought him an early head injury but within seconds
of his return to the field, the Kelso captain took a clean lineout catch and
sprinted through a bemused defence for the first try. Graeme Aitchison added
the conversion to his opening penalty goal.
Kelso maintained their pressure and their back row combined well for Bennet to
send in Adam Roxburgh for a try at the corner. The flanker underlined his fine
display with a second touchdown as he backed up a break by Aitchison. The full
back converted and, with a second penalty goal on the stroke of half-time, gave
Kelso a 25-0 lead.
Midway through the second half, Kelso struck again, John Jeffrey scoring at the
posts off good lineout provision from his pack. Aitchison, having slotted a
third penalty goal, added the goal points to Jeffrey's try and Kelso were out
of sight.
They weren't quite finished, however, for, with six minutes to go, replacement
lock Alasdair Stewart celebrated his return to first-class rugby after a
three-year break by scoring the final try.
Kelso - G Aitchison; S Ross, G Laing, B Manion, J Thomson; S Tait, I Fairley; J
Ramage, K Thomson, R Hogarth, S Rowley, C Meade, S Bennet, J Jeffrey, A
Roxburgh. Replacement - A Stewart for Meade (53min).

SO that's the leagues nearly over, and the big question is: What's going to
happen to loyalty now, then?
Keeping up to date with all of the machinations is like trying to catch the
bits of an exploding hand grenade as they fly here and there.
``What happens now?'' folk often ask.
Something to do with regional leagues, and cup, and a few other things, I think.
I think that the players will use everything at their disposal to weed out the
best deal from the SRU, but I can't help thinking that the reason some of our
big boys aren't doing so well is because all of this money chat is diverting
attention away from the core skills of rugby.
To heck with the players earning some dosh, the important bit is that the clubs
survive and, as I survey the leagues, I ask myself: What on earth has happened
to Stew-Mel? They are down. And one of the ramifications of a club like that
going down is, unless they can stop their demise, then they are on a downward
spiral. It seems just like yesterday the club had its Calders, Scotts, and
Brewsters. All of whom made up one of the best club sides in the land.
Alan Kittle has left, Graeme Burns, their scrum half, is on his way to Saracens
in England, Ross McNulty is going to Currie, and No.8 Dave Clark is considering
a move to Boroughmuir. All of which will remove more players from the staff at
the club, and ask questions of director of rugby Finlay Calder as the club
slips into the third division.
He blames the lack of regard for club loyalty. ``I think club loyalty is going.
Players will give their current club one season, but, at the end of that, any
loyalty will be stretched in the current climate,'' said Calder. ``I believe in
the traditional values, and I think it's wrong to leave.''
Who can argue with Calder? Players are going to start shifting in their droves
now, as they do in football.
And Calder, who has long been an advocate of giving the clubs their place at
the head of rugby's table instead of districts, goes further than that to say
that too many clubs in Edinburgh vying for the top spot is bad for the game.
``I wouldn't mind if some of the stronger clubs merged to form very big
clubs,'' he said. ``But you have to say that the present set-up is too tight.
``I accept that the success or failure of our side has been down to 15 men on
the pitch, but we have been playing to avoid relegation since the start of the
season. Eight teams and two down is just too tight.''
As for the suggestion that he might now take the easy route and take his leave
from his club, he scoffs.
``Stewart's Melville are part of my life. It's part of my family. I can't just
turn my back,'' said Calder. ``If I am asked to go on then I will.
``Our lack of success hasn't been down to bad coaching, or a lack of kit, or
anything like that.
``The players have been well looked after. Nervousness has crept in. If all
five of our teams had been getting beaten then I would be terribly deflated and
things wouldn't have been working, but our seconds beat their Stirling County
counterparts on Saturday and they really shouldn't have.''
Calder cites his game against Kelso on Saturday - he came on after five minutes
- as proof that club rugby has to be the way ahead for the game, despite all
that has been said after the Western Samoan game.
``I can't get excited by district rugby,'' said Calder. ``On Saturday, Kelso
had their biggest crowd for years. The people appeared because they wanted to
tell the players that the club meant something to them. Clubs are the
foundation of the game, but the structure of the season has placed a noose
around our necks. It is just too tight.''
He has a point, and it has been aired many a time by others. But it's a good
one about club loyalty.
One of the end results of placing district rugby ahead of club rugby - and they
say the SRU players' contract has a clause about bonus payments for playing
district rugby - is that clubs, without stretching the point, will become
places of convenience for aspiring players to play and be seen. Just as they
are in football.
You are loyal to the man who pays you the most. And where that takes us, God
only knows.

THE European Union and a dozen Mediterranean countries haggled today over the
details of a political and economic alliance aimed at creating a free trade
zone by 2010.
Diplomats debated arms control and terrorism issues to be included in a joint
statement the foreign ministers of the 15 EU and 12 Mediterranean nations will
issue on Tuesday.
The two-day Ministers' conference starting in Barcelona tomorrow will launch
the EU's most ambitious bid to date to improve relations with countries on its
volatile southern doorstep, from Morocco to Turkey.
``Tomorrow begins a new chapter in relations between Europe and the
Mediterranean nations,'' said Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana, who will
chair the 27-nation conference.
It is seen as a bid by the West Europeans to become more assertive in a region
where it has long played second fiddle to the United States.
The EU is offering #4000m in aid over five years to its 12 partners: Algeria,
Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey,
and the Palestinian Authority.
Libya has been excluded because EU nations consider it a sponsor of terrorism.
The EU wants to stop the flow of illegal immigrants from North Africa and
stifle Islamic fundamentalism around the Mediterranean that is seen to threaten
Western Europe's security.
Diplomats tonight tried to reconcile different interpretations of
``terrorism'', with Syria and Lebanon insisting it must not be confused with a
people's right to use violence to gain freedom.-AP.

<HEADLINE>Meningitis student an isolated case</HEADLINE>

THE 18-year-old Scots university student who was taken to hospital on Thursday
suffering from meningitis, remains in a critical but stable condition.
Forth Valley Health Board yesterday insisted the case of Mr Christopher Scott,
a first-year student at Stirling University, was isolated.
A spokesman sought to reassure the public by saying that friends who had come
into contact with the student had all been traced and given treatment.
Mr Scott, who is understood to come from Falkirk, remained in the intensive
care unit at Stirling Royal Infirmary yesterday. He became ill on Thursday and
was taken to hospital, where his condition deteriorated.
The latest news of the student's illness has been confirmed amid growing
concern south of the Border where health officials say they have identified
five separate clusters of meningitis outbreaks since October.
As an immunisation programme got under way on Saturday in Lincoln, where five
people have died and two are still seriously ill from the disease, the Public
Health Laboratory Service confirmed meningitis had also appeared in
Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Norfolk, and Sussex. Health officials said there
had also been individual cases, including one in Liverpool.
Dr Andrew Riley, consultant in public health medicine with Forth Valley Health
Board, said yesterday the case of Mr Scott was isolated and there was no
connection with any other cases as far as health officials had established.
Last week, after consultation with public health officials, Professor Andrew
Millar, Principal of Stirling University, sent a statement to all 2000 students
residing in campus accommodation.
The principal said the symptoms to look for were flu-like with severe headaches.
He urged students who believed they might be at risk to contact their GP or the
porter or security at the university on 01786 467000.

A TERRIFYING new threat to the prospects of a lasting peace in the Balkans is
exposed with the discovery that Serbia has factories capable of making deadly
nerve gases.
World In Action claims it uncovered proof that the former Yugoslavia was
producing the nerve gas sarin and assisted Saddam Hussein by helping build
Iraq's main chemical weapons plant at Samarra. The Yugoslavs also developed the
Orkan multiple rocket launcher for Saddam to deliver the lethal gases,
according to the programme.
Former US Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger says international sanctions
on Serbia should not have been lifted until the Serbs gave an ``absolute
assurance'' that they would scrap their chemical weapons.
Major David Craig, chemical warfare adviser to General Sir Peter de la
Billiere's in the Gulf War, went to an abandoned nerve gas factory between
Muslim and Bosnian Serb front lines north of Mostar.
Analysis of samples from the plant confirmed that sarin had been produced there.
Major Craig said: ``What you have discovered is that Yugoslavia was producing
weapons of mass destruction and that the Serbs still have the capability to do
so.''
Former staff in the top-secret nerve gas programme describe the capability and
locations of several factories in Serbia which can still make sarin.
Secret Yugoslav army documents and manuals detail Serbia's preparedness to wage
a chemical war.
Former Yugoslav President Stipe Mesic explains how he made a secret trip to the
United States to brief the Pentagon on the threat posed by his own army's
collaboration with Saddam.
Although he was head of state, his trip had to be kept secret from his own
forces and he used a ``private'' visit to Austria to board an American jet for
his clandestine trip to Washington.

EX-SERVICEMEN who were used as human guinea pigs in the 1950s will learn this
week if they have won a 12-year fight for compensation.
The British Nuclear Test Veterans' Association, which is pressing for a #2000m
award from the Government, claims its members have suffered cancers and other
life-threatening diseases from radiation exposure.
More than 22,000 servicemen, many of them Scots, witnessed the Pacific bomb
testing programmes between 1952 and 1958. Many subsequently died or are in ill
health.
The European Court of Human Rights this week will consider three cases - all
involving Scots - during a two-day sitting due to start tomorrow, with a final
ruling expected on Thursday.
The move will bring an end to a 12-year struggle started by Renfrew Councillor
Ken McGinley, a former Royal Engineer who was sent to Christmas Island in 1958
and witnessed six explosions.
When Mr McGinley, 57, and his colleagues started their fight for compensation
in 1983, the group from Johnstone, Renfrewshire, alone numbered 11. Since then,
five, all of whom had cancer-related illness, have died.
Of his time on Christmas Island, Mr McGinley said last night: ``We were ordered
to face an explosion with fists firmly clenched and pressed into our eye
sockets. I was wearing a white boiler suit.
``Some of the men said that when the heat and light hit us, they could make out
the bones in their hands, like an X-Ray.
``The heat was so intense that I felt it burning my bones and, a couple of days
after, I broke out in a bad skin rash.''
Mr McGinley, who is adamant that there has been a massive cover-up, said the
European Court's decision was the ex-servicemen's last hope of a victory.
Mr McGinley has also suffered from medical problems since his involvement in
the tests but he is not allowed to discuss them for legal reasons.
He said: ``This is not just a fight for the veterans but for the widows and the
dependents, sons and daughters, who have been affected.''
The British Nuclear Tests Veterans' Association has 3000 members throughout
Britain and they are being represented by Paisley-born lawyer Ian Anderson, now
a leading New York attorney, through public donations and financial aid from
sympathetic local authorities.

DOCTORS have demanded action to stop the secret trade in personal medical
records by private detective agencies.
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell was urged to launch an inquiry into the
disclosure that confidential health files can easily be bought from High Street
agencies for #150.
Doctors want to see the leaking of medical records made a criminal offence and
a general rule imposed that any NHS employee who breaches patient
confidentiality is sacked on the spot.
The scale of the problem was revealed by a Sunday newspaper which gained
permission from a number of politicians and other influential figures to obtain
their medical records.
Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the British Medical Association, was one of those
who took part in the exercise.
He was shocked by the ease with which his confidential records were bought from
a detective agency for #150. The information was faxed to the newspaper within
three hours of the order.
In a statement yesterday, Dr Macara said: ``I am appalled that the media has
been able to obtain my personal medical details but I'm not at all surprised.
``The BMA, supported by all the health professions, has been demanding adequate
protection for the confidentiality of identifiable personal health information
for several years. But we have been unable to persuade Ministers that there is
any cause for concern.''
One year ago, the BMA published a first draft of its own proposals for a law
making the unauthorised divulging of medical records a criminal offence.
The idea was rejected by the Government but the BMA hopes to gain backing for a
revised version of the Bill.
The spokesman said new European rules on health confidentiality due to come
into force by 1998 would eventually compel the Government to support such
legislation.
Fears about confidentiality have been further heightened by plans to link
computers in an information network covering the whole NHS.

A RUSSIAN MP was murdered today on a campaign trip for next month's General
Election, prompting an outcry over the government's failure to stop crime.
Sergei Markidonov was shot in the head and a bodyguard received head wounds
while campaigning in the eastern Siberian town of Petrovsk-Zabaikalsky, about
3000 miles from Moscow.
Early reports by Russian radio suggested the bodyguard had shot Markidonov,
possibly after a row in a hotel room, and tried to kill himself.
``After killing the deputy, the bodyguard tried to commit suicide,'' the radio
said. ``He was found in a serious condition at the scene of the crime by local
police and taken to hospital.''
Markidonov, a liberal, was the fourth MP from the State Duma to be killed since
the last election in December 1993. The other deaths were linked to an upsurge
in gang murders and violent business rivalries.
Markidonov was elected to the Duma in 1993 for the reformist Russia's Choice
party. He later crossed to the pro-government group Stability.
The Communist Party quickly denounced the authorities.
``No matter how Markidonov was killed, the whole thing has a touch of
politics,'' said senior party member Viktor Ilyushin. ``Our grief has a great
deal of regret about the complete impotence of the bodies created to fight
crime in the country.''
q The Communists are confident of achieving a spectacular comeback in the
Russian elections on December 17.
Opinion polls show that the successor to the party which ruled with an iron
grip for more than 70 years could win most seats in the Duma.
Communists and nationalists, riding a wave of discontent over market reforms,
look set for a sizeable share of votes at the expense of the liberals.-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Sarajevo `will be new Beirut run by Nato' Bosnian Serb leader claims capital `is going to bleed for decades'o</HEADLINE>

BOSNIAN Serb leader Radovan Karadzic warned today that Sarajevo would become
the Beirut of Europe if the city was reunified as laid down under the Dayton
peace plan.
However the Bosnian Government derided his words as scaremongering and said the
Bosnian Serb army was to blame for the city's predicament because of its siege
and bombardment of Sarajevo for more than 3!s years.
Karadzic spoke on British television from his headquarters in Pale outside
Sarajevo as part of a growing Serb campaign of opposition to parts of the peace
plan initialled on Tuesday in Dayton, Ohio. Diplomats say the Serb moves augur
badly for the chances of its complete implementation.
However the chief US negotiator for the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke, ruled out
altering the accord to suit the Serbs. He told US television today that there
would be no change when it is formally signed in Paris next month.
The Bosnian Serbs are incensed that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic,
negotiating on their behalf, agreed to Serb-held Sarajevo suburbs reverting to
Bosnian Government control.
``Bosnian Serbs in the city of Sarajevo . . . will require special status,''
Karadzic said, calling for changes in the plan.
``What is wrong with the Dayton agreement is that it has created a new Beirut
in Europe. It is going to bleed for decades,'' said Karadzic, playing to
Western fears that Nato troops will become bogged down in further fighting in
Bosnia.
Beirut was divided by a Green Line battle zone into warring halves during the
brutal 15-year civil war which wrecked the Lebanese capital in the 1980s.
A Bosnian Government official dismissed Karadzic's predictions that reunifying
the city would lead to disastrous intercommunal fighting, saying Sarajevo was
never ethnically divided before the war.
``Karadzic was fighting for four years to make Sarajevo look like Berlin before
the wall there came down,'' said Bosnian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mirza
Hajric.
``The peace plan means that terrible dream has not come. But since Karadzic
couldn't create Berlin he'll do everything in his power to create a Beirut,''
he said.
Karadzic repeated a call first made on Serb television on Friday for at least
five years of international protection for civilians in Serb-held suburbs.
``Serbs in Sarajevo have their own rights and their own fears,'' said Karadzic.
``They are not willing to accept Muslim authority.''
Diplomats said that if Nato troops ``protected'' Serb civilians in the way
Karadzic wanted, their presence would simply bulwark the Serb hold on areas
around the capital which they do not want to give up.
Belgrade analysts said Karadzic's provocative comments came of desperation, as
he had been cut out of the Dayton talks by Milosevic.
The Bosnian Government says human rights guarantees, and its pledge not to
victimise Serbs who opt to stay in areas that fall to its control, should
satisfy the concerns of Bosnian Serbs, who have begun to demonstrate against
the peace deal.
Karadzic mixed conciliation with defiance in his interview, pledging to accept
the overall peace plan but declaring open rejection of clauses that bar him
from staying in power.
``I am the legal and legitimate representative of my people . . . I did not
issue any single wrong order or decision,'' he said, denying that he was guilty
of war crimes.
NEW YORK: Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said that the US and Europe should
work more closely to end wars such as that in the former Yugoslavia.
``One of the lessons we should learn is that the United States and Western
Europe should decide jointly from the very beginning what their common course
of action should be,'' he told Newsweek International.
Citing difficulties with decision-making when the US became involved in the air
in Bosnia, he said: ``Either we should all be there on the ground or no-one
is.''-Reuter.

Nagpur, Sunday
AT LEAST nine cricket fans were killed and 50 injured when a stadium wall gave
way today as crowds were leaving for lunch during a one-day international
between India and New Zealand.
Part of the back wall on the eastern stand at the Vidarbha Cricket Association
(VCA) Stadium collapsed as spectators were making their way out.
``At one moment I saw the wall, in the next I saw several people falling
down,'' said journalist Joseph Rao.
Three spectators, including a 23-year-old woman, were killed immediately and
another six died in hospital, police said. At least 14 of the injured were in
serious condition.
Witnesses said a 10ft wide section of the brick wall appeared to give way in
the crush of people trying to leave the top level of the stand.
Some victims fell over the edge as the wall collapsed, plunging 50ft to the
ground, while others were hit by debris.
More than 100 people had been perched on the wall.
The cricket club announced it would pay 50,000 rupees (#1000) compensation to
the families of each of the dead.
The match, the fifth one-day international between India and New Zealand in the
Kiwis' current tour, continued despite the tragedy. New Zealand beat India by
99 runs.
``There would have been a riot if we had suspended play,'' said a VCA official.
The stadium is to host one of the world cup cricket matches, between Australia
and Zimbabwe, on March 1. The eastern stand had only recently been
completed.-Reuter.

and revealed she had already warned her daughters about the perils. Daughter
Beatrice is seven and Eugenie is just five but the duchess said that the
earlier parents started educating children about their well-being, the better
it will be for them in the long run. ``The best people to educate a child about

THE uncharitable viewpoint might be that Mose Allison is a know-all. Advice? He
gives it. For naive country folks moving to the big city, he's got the lowdown.
For those who just don't know when to stop, he's got the red light. For the
writer of You Are My Sunshine, he's got the inside track on how it was really
meant to scan.
Coming from a different source, all this agony uncleship might get a mite
tiresome. But not coming from a man who, with heavy self-disparagement, sings
of sitting there in his cowboy suit, lookin' cute, who admits that one of these
days he's gonna get things straight, and whose version of Sunshine makes you
think, damnit, he's got a point.
A man so disposed towards giving advice might also take some: play solo. His
piano playing, with its quaint digressions into Monkish baroque, wasn't best
served by a rhythm team forced to rehearse some fairly fussy moves as they
went. Neither was his naturally light singing, although his own instructions to
the sound engineer (who thankfully knew better and gradually undid the wrong)
didn't help.
Allison is anyway a performer best suited to the most intimate of settings. His
quick-thinking hipster word play demands closer concentration than this
restive, not to say impolite, audience allowed. But distractions aside, his
blend of jazz sophistication and his native Mississippi blues, taking in Nat
King Cole and Muddy Waters songs, together with a ready wit, make for one of
the most entertaining and idiosyncratic talents around.

Stirling County 15, Melrose 15
JUST about the only thing left cut and dried after this riveting clash between
these two championship contenders was Brian Edwards' scalp.
The Stirling County coach was sporting what in the tonsorial trade is termed a
``No.1 all-over.'' Edwards declined to go into detail but it was, he divulged,
a legacy of the celebrations which followed his North and Midlands boys'
victory over Western Samoa.
A win for Melrose on Saturday would have placed them in pole position for a
championship-settling outing against Gala on Saturday. The draw now means that
a victory against their near neighbours next weekend, in their final
championship outing, will place them on 19 points.
County, however, are currently on 15 points with two games to play. The
Bridgehaugh men meet Boroughmuir on Saturday, and Heriot's the weekend after.
They, too, have the potential to finish on 19 points.
Currently, Melrose are 41 points to the good on scoring differential and it may
yet come down to that.
The scenario of another batch of drawn games next weekend underlines how this
eight-team premiership has turned into a mathematician's nightmare and was not
at all what the spin-doctor ordered.
The most immediate concern for Stirling, though, is just how they contrived to
let a 15-point lead dribble away into the sand and especially so when it is
considered that for most of the time that they were those 15 points to the good
they were more than worth that lead.
County had Melrose under the cosh for almost the entire first half. Mark
McKenzie missed three kickable penalty goals inside the first quarter of an
hour and, inexplicably, chose to run another well within range to no avail
after 30 minutes, and, had these chances been turned into points, then we may
well have witnessed an entirely different ball game.
Let us, though, take nothing away from Melrose. They got their lineout working
in the second half - Weir plucking some choice balls from the ether - and Craig
Chalmers banged down some telling positional punts which kept County on the
turn.
Craig Joiner on the Melrose right wing, recovered from the foot injury which
has kept him out of the premiership since September, had one of those ``great
to be back'' days. He had a try but that was the least of it. The sustained
power of his running was the thing that most caught the eye.
Joiner had the hex on his international team-mate, Kenny Logan, the County
left-wing experiencing one of those ``I wish I was anywhere else but here''
days.
The exuberant Logan's loss of form is a concern, certainly for County but
equally for the national selectors. Good players don't become bad players
overnight. Some remedial work might be in order but both County and Scotland
need Logan firing on all cylinders.
County appeared to have taken the lead after six minutes when Colin MacRobert,
displaying electrifying pace, skinned Gary Parker on the outside and stormed in
for a ``try'' which was disallowed after the touch-judge Jim Johnston flagged
for some unnecessary footwork by Bob Cairney on Rowen Shepherd.
Stirling did take the lead after 23 minutes after the nervousness which
pervaded Melrose's first-half effort manifested itself in a defensive guddle by
Shepherd and Bain. Logan swooped on the scrap ball, fed Davie Elliot - the
under-rated mystery man of Scottish back-rows, said Edwards - who set Gareth
Flockhart off on a 50-metre dash for the line. McKenzie converted and, at last,
County had something to show for their efforts.
Ten minutes later, Ian Jardine, who was beginning to capture the form which
made him a pre-injury mainstay for Scotland last season, scored a timely try
after severe Stirling pressure but in the closing minutes of the first period
Melrose began to grab a semblance of the control which set them up in the
second half.
It was, though, first blood to Stirling after the interval with a McKenzie
penalty goal but, thereafter, they never troubled the scorers again.
Craig Chalmers began the resurrection shuffle with a sparkling try which Parker
converted.
Then Joiner had his try as Melrose continued to prove the dominant force, and
Parker kicked the equalising penalty goal 10 minutes from the end.
It was a real pressure kick, the more so as Parker - like McKenzie - had not
experienced the best of afternoons with the boot, but the ball flew true and
Melrose take their championship aspirations down to the wire.

JUST in case there is anyone out there who hasn't heard yet, 1995 is the
tercentenary of the death of English composer Henry Purcell. While Radio 3 is
broadcasting in the year every extant piece he ever wrote, more than a few
local music organisations have also marked the occasion.
On Saturday evening it was the turn of Cappella Nova to add their contribution,
seeking to give a Scottish dimension by focusing on Purcell's sacred and
secular music composed during the reign of the last Stuart king, James II and
VII.
Whatever the excuse for revisiting Purcell, his sacred music transcends the
merely temporal and in the opening anthem the voices of Cappella Nova soared
towards a celestial plain. This kind of piece exemplifies the group's
extraordinary power to sublimate individual voices to a greater overall unity,
in this case Purcell's intended heavenly harmonies.
For the rest of the anthems the choir was augmented by the chamber group,
Concerto Caledonia, who provided instrumental introductions as well as the
continuo. Their generally light, delicate playing provided a sensitive balance,
underscoring rather than overwhelming the vocal lines. Where solos were called
for, such was the high quality of performance throughout that it would be
unfair to mention individuals other than to remark on the superbly rich and
powerful basses.
Not so satisfying was Welcome Song for James II, the secular work which closed
the concert. A less measured direction by Alan Tavener, with a little
decoration here and there, might have yielded a more expressive result.

HAVING travelled all the way from the sticks of West Aberdeenshire, and paid
#38 to support Scottish Rugby and watch that abysmal performance on Saturday
afternoon, my wife and I feel we have been cheated.
Any more of that type of entertainment, and there will be two debentures on the
open market to the biggest bidder, and I shall seek better value from watching
Tom &amp; Jerry on the TV.
The only entertainment we got was the commitment of the Samoans to run the ball
forward and their dance of appreciation at the termination of the match.
What did John Beattie write in your journal last week? ``He hoped, Oh how
forlorn, he hoped we would see some entertaining running rugby from the
Scottish team,'' and what did we get?
A fusilade of misguided kicks from our ``stand off,'' who, in June, was
described by a Scottish scribe as one of the great tacticians of the game. That
was in a World scenario you know.
The arrogance of some of those who wore our National Colours is beyond
comprehension. They are so unfit it is unbelievable. To put in a performance
such as that, how can they ask for and command a fee, let alone a jersey?
A number of players came out with credit, but they were few. Oh, and John
Beattie, don't run away and hide, you are the only guy in the game scene who is
speaking some sense, and that includes the hierachy of the SRU.

LOYAL supporter that I am, I joined those thousands of other good Scots rugby
enthusiasts at Murrayfield for my forty-eighth year of indulgence in this
pilgrimage.
I am obliged to conform to the new rules of ``not even a hip flask for
medicinal purposes,'' and I can accept the need for this ruling.
However, I cannot accept the whistles, yells, and bugles that erupt from a
considerable percentage of the Scottish supporters on the occasion of the
visitors penalty conversion attempts.
Why, why has this crept in over the past few years? It is hardly noticeable at
the other Five Nations' grounds.
I honestly want to cover my face in shame when this happens. I was delighted to
hear the SRU's tannoyed plea to cease this foul practice on Saturday.
Who are the culprits? Could that army of stewards searching for the
middle-aged, grey-haired businessman having a fly sook at his flask secreted
behind his moth-eaten sporran, not be better employed pinpointing the whistlers
or howlers from the schoolboy ranks?
What are the guardian teachers or school-masters doing about it?
Come on Scotland. Let's play the game. We can ``stand against them'' without
this disgraceful display of unsportsmanlike bad manners.

IT SEEMS little changes in men's indoor hockey, on the evidence of play on the
first weekend of the new season at the Bell's Sports Centre in Perth. With the
standard of play and umpiring continuing to drop, Menzieshill and MIM remain
the leading sides in the country and John Christie is by far the top
personality.
Christie, the Scottish internationalist, proved his worth to Menzieshill, the
defending champions, scoring four of their goals in their 5-1 defeat of
archrivals MIM.
Officials have clearly become alarmed about the deteriorating quality of play
but until such time as there is a break between the indoor and outdoor season,
little will change. The plight of the umpires wasn't helped by the cancelling
of the pre-season briefing meeting, particularly with some new umpires coming
into the game.
Insights Inverleith gifted equalisers in their two matches yesterday on the
final hooter against Torbrex Wanderers and Grange.
Their biggest embarrassment came in their tussle with Grange. Four minutes were
remaining in the match when Derek Batchelor elected to introduce Norman McLeod
as a kicking back in an attempt to eliminate Insights' 3-0 lead. The tactical
move worked, with Colin Pretty, Andy McBride, and Gary Boomer all scoring.

FOR 25 years Kenneth Clarke has been marked out as a Tory leader to come. As a
newcomer to the Commons in 1970 the plaudit used to both please and irritate
him. Teased about it, he used to say: ``Thanks a million - I now join the long
list of Tories who fail to become party leader.''
It was still fashionable in those days to camouflage one's brilliance if one
wanted to get on. He worked at his natural bloke's temperament, his man's man
nature. Football, beer, jazz, cheap cigars, crumpled suits, suede shoes.
Tomorrow Kenneth Clarke will not mind a bit if, having delivered his Budget,
people start marking him out again as the next leader. It will indicate this
man of the world has given the Tories a fresh chance of retaining power. This
could make him the heir apparent whether Major wins or loses.
In short, the Chancellor could be back in the frame if he gets his judgments
right. Over the last two years or so he has not found favour in the right of
his party, despite his description of himself as coming from ``the hard
centre''.
It is five years since he told Margaret Thatcher she should bow out gracefully
before she was thrown out by the parliamentary party, but the Thatcherites'
grudge is still there. He is thought to be soft on Europe, refusing to denounce
outright a single currency, and that is another score against him on the right.
At the same time his views on abortion and capital punishment are too liberal
for them.
Coincidentally, as long as Michael Heseltine was a possibility for leadership,
support for Clarke was muted. Now Heseltine appears to have committed himself
totally to Major as his Deputy, Clarke could be poised as the best man to lead
the reviving One Nation concept of Conservatism. Tomorrow is a watershed for
his prospects and those of the Government.
At 55, he has more than sufficient experience for the top job. A Cabinet
minister for 10 years, he has been involved in trade and industry, and
employment. Before becoming Chancellor two years ago, he was Home Secretary,
Education Secretary and Health Secretary. For Margaret Thatcher he took on the
doctors, nurses, firefighters, police, and teachers in a series of bruising
encounters over pay and conditions.
When he was confronting the ambulancemen, perhaps the most rancorous of his
disputes, a petition of 4.5 million people was delivered against him. By
October 1990, he was the Cabinet's low man in an ICM poll with a 60%
disapproval rating and only 18% aprroving his deeds. This was despite the fact
he secured an additional #2.6 billion for the NHS from the Treasury in
November, 1989.
Norman Tebbit thought highly of him in those days, describing him as ``vigorous
and combative'', a future Tory leader, ``getting on with things I would like to
see done''.
Two years later, in October 1992, the then Chief Whip, Richard Ryder, had to
seperate the two men as they were about to come to blows at Lord Jeffrey
Archer's conference party. They were arguing about Maastricht, and Clarke (who
had been accused of not reading the Treaty) told Tebbit: ``You have declared
war on the Government; we have no choice but to take you on.''
This was unusual for Clarke who normally laughs his way out of this kind of
trouble and remains, as his wife Gillian says, ``impossibly calm''. But he
likes to give as good as he gets and Tebbit fights rough. Major and his whole
Government were being destabilised by the Tory Eurosceptics at the time. The
following year, Major appointed Clarke as his Chancellor, replacing Norman
Lamont.
He had been part of the Black Wednesday emergency Cabinet team and had seen the
pound demolished and the decisions to raise interest rates twice in one day to
15%. Still, as Chancellor, he refused to rule out the possibility Britain
should return to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) one day.
``Our membership (of the ERM) certainly helped us to achieve the low level of
inflation which is one of the best bases for making industry competitive as we
move into the recovery,'' he said.
``The five-point reductions in interest rates before we left the ERM were as
valuable as the four additional point reductions we have made since we left the
ERM.''
By this time all but the Europhiles in the party were of the opinion the Tories
would gain by coming right out against the ERM for ever. Some saw it as being
used by the likes of Clarke at a future date to ease us into a single currency.
But Mr Major was not prepared to rule out the ERM for ever and, as Clarke told
the Tory conference in October 1993, ``Any enemy of John Major is an enemy of
mine''.
This was the year that he introduced a Budget with the biggest increases in
taxation and the toughest restraints on public spending since the Second World
War. Tory taxation has increased by seven pence in the pound and the party's
reward is to find itself at its lowest-ever ebb in public opinion.
Clarke states his political philosophy is ``free market economics combined with
enlightened social reform'', much as Mr Major might say. There is no doubt this
Cambridge Law graduate and former QC has the intellect to cope with his immense
task. His oratory skills are better displayed at the Despatch Box than on a
platform; his administrative record is patchy, but civil servants who have
worked for him give him the benefit of any doubt. He is now a shrewd politician.
He has the common touch. One pacifist grandfather sold the Daily Herald at
trade union rallies; the other, a Raleigh bicycle toolroom engineer, was a
Communist. He is named after his father - an artisan who sent him to Nottingham
High School before Cambridge where he became President of the Union and, some
say, the brightest of the ``mafia of Tory politicians'' who made it to Cabinet
rank.
All the attributes for leadership are in place. Tomorrow he has the chance,
perhaps his last, to use them to get the Tories out of the mess they are in.

THE action of Mother Courage and her Children in its current revival at the
National Theatre is preceded by a giant crow circling above the stage. The crow
returns to haunt her at each change of scene. Somebody must have decided that
an audience raised on TV commercials would be unable to comprehend a play about
the waste and depredation of war without a hefty visual nudge to ram the point
home.
It's a shame because such false notes are rare in Jonathan Kent's
well-considered production. For the most part we're given a welcome reminder of
the power of Brecht's kind of theatre. The scope is huge, the versatility
breathtaking.
Songs, settings, and language work together to build up the overall effect.
Even the smallest role in this large company is finely characterised. This is
theatre of epic ambition achieved through mastery of detail. Jonathan Kent,
well served by David Hare's lively new translation, refuses to shirk the play's
many ambiguities. Mother Courage is both indomitable and cowardly; we find her
superb even while we shrink from her cynicism.
Diana Rigg, in the title role, eschews histrionics in favour of a performance
carefully judged to fit in with the whole company. We are not asked to pay
homage to a great actress at work. Instead she achieves her effect by a wealth
of well-observed detail. Rigg reveals every side of the role and we are left at
the end devastated as much by her laughter as by the fate of her children.
For some reason Brecht has gathered a reputation for heaviness on the British
stage. Any doubts on this score will be removed by this lively and imaginative
revival.

WISDOM and politicians are not always the most obvious bedfellows. However, the
Irish Premier, John Bruton, discarded triumphalism for compassionate
commonsense when the campaign to permit divorce, which he had supported,
squeaked home at the weekend.
Bruton insisted the result should not end in acrimony since he believed both
Yes and No voters were only about 60% convinced of their decision.
That was a wise, shrewd, and almost certainy accurate observation. Like all the
pieces of legal Elastoplast we attempt to apply to wounds in the human
condition, divorce is an imperfect healing mechanism. Many people who changed
their vote from last time will still harbour genuine fears about the impact on
Irish family life.
And many still persuaded to vote No will have personal knowledge of loveless,
violent unions in which partners have been trapped until death do them part.
Nevertheless, I believe Ireland was right to take the difficult step it did,
not least because in a modern multi-cultural society, one whose citizens
embrace several faiths and none, it should not be the business of any one
church to blackmail the State.
Nor should it be the business of an elderly, celibate, unmarried male Polish
Pontiff to dictate to the men and women of Ireland how they should conduct
their personal relationships.
It is even being supposed this morning that his intervention in the debate
pushed many waverers into the Yes camp; if so, it is a neat form of secular
retaliation.
Nevertheless, while the availability of divorce in Irish society should be a
cause for quiet celebration, not least for those second families who will now
be able to enjoy a formal blessing if they so wish, nobody should suppose the
act of legal separation is without serious consequences.
Undoubtedly, there will be many thousands of men and women in Ireland for whom
the possibility of divorce represents a long overdue escape from the dire
domestic consequences of a disastrous union. But there will be those who are in
the midst of one of those negative patches familiar to all married couples who
would be foolish to suppose a trip to the courts is a surefire recipe for
instant sunshine.
Marriage, sharing your entire life with one other human being, could be said to
be a triumph of optimism over logic. But the fact so many divorcees seem
hell-bent on giving it another whirl, regrettably with less chance of success
than before, suggests most of us still believe in its potential for emotional
satisfaction.
However, there is another consideration more important than the immediate needs
of the adults concerned in a failing relationship, and that is the long-term
interests of the children. In their recent report on childhood, Barnardo's
reflected on the fact the post war generation had managed to convince
themselves a civilised divorce was better for children than a battle-scarred
marriage.
Barnardo's concluded that assumption to be badly flawed - more of a useful
alibi for parents than a sustainable analysis. The uncomfortable reality for
parents contemplating separation is almost all the evidence suggests the
reverse . . . children whose parents break up are more likely to have a range
of problems than those whose parents stay together.
An examination of the background reports on children who go through the
Childrens Panel system, or young adults who find themselves in court, will
provide a depressingly similar picture of disrupted childhood. Equally,the
statistics on homeless or abused children or those who become victims of street
violence will contain a disproportionate number of young people who have spent
many of their formative years in care.
The more we research this subject as a society, the more it become absolutely
clear the best chance we give children is as stable and loving a childhood as
is possible to deliver; inevitably that will often mean the best interests of
the children being given priority over the personal inclinations of the adults.
None of which is to argue adults should be obliged to tolerate any kind of
distress or abuse in order to keep the domestic show on the road. At the
extreme end of the spectrum you have instances such as Fred and Rosemary West,
both of whom came from households littered with violence and sexual abuse.
Households where that kind of monstrous rewriting of the rules of civilised
behaviour has gone on are not households in which you want to maintain the
status quo for the children. Nor should women be expected to tolerate routine
and drunken violence as the price of maintaining a two-parent home.
There will be many people in Ireland who have had to do just that with little
hope until now of a legal settlement which would afford them justice and the
means to embark on a financially independent lifestyle.
However, there are other kinds of marital breakdown, less dramatic and not
involving violence or abuse. Relationships where people become indifferent
rather than hostile, bored rather than battered - marriages where that boredom
leads to affairs or semi-separate existences. Where there are children involved
it seems to me you need a better excuse than the absence of bliss to throw
their vital years into emotional disarray.
It's absolutely no accident the army of therapists now plying their trade on
this side of the Atlantic as well as the other go about their business by
having their clients try to identify, confront and then deal with difficulties
they faced with family relationships when they were young - that is the period
when the seeds of success or otherwise for all future relationships are sown.
It's absolutely no accident children whose parents separated are less likely to
suppose partners living together for a lifetime is a sustainable option.
Ireland is lucky in the sense its long debate over law reform has allowed it to
witness how the rest of the world has handled the reality of broken marriages.
If it has learned anything it will be that while divorce affords certain
freedoms, it rarely comes with solutions attached and always implies casualties.

JOHN Beattie suggests that, in liaising with the Western Samoan authorities to
that country's tour to Scotland, I telephoned them in the middle of their
night. A light-hearted quip in his Diary piece it may have been, but a quite
outrageous and damaging accusation to make without checking facts first.
The SRU's policy in dealing with overseas Unions is to contact them at times
which are convenient to them - and, therefore, sometimes at great inconvenience
to us. As a courtesy to a visiting country, it meant that telephone calls made
by me to Western Samoa were made in the middle of our night.
John Beattie, as a columnist and former player, is entitled to express his
sometimes trenchant views. However, he should have had the courtesy of first
checking his facts with the SRU.
I A L Hogg,
Secretary,
Scottish Rugby Union plc,
Murrayfield,
Edinburgh.
q.The ``outrageous and damaging'' accusation to which Mr Hogg refers, was in
fact contained in an after-dinner speech by the Western Samoan manager, the Rev
Dr Faitala Talapusi, at the post-match banquet. The reference was light-hearted
in intent, and did not detract from a fulsome tribute to the SRU for the manner
in which they had hosted the Samoans. Similarly, as Mr Hogg notes, the diary
item was a ``light-hearted quip'' and in no way intended as a slight on the SRU
secretary.

FIFE Flyers' player-coach Mark Morrison aimed to build on the encouragement of
pocketing three points out of a possible four from their last two games but his
hopes of moving up the premier division table were dashed at the weekend.
Flyers were put to the sword 13-3 by Sheffield Steelers last night, a far cry
from their encouraging recent Benson and Hedges Cup semi-final clash with the
Yorkshiremen, who were forced into extra time after the sides were level at 8-8
after two closely-fought legs.
Sheffield won through to Saturday's final with a quick strike in sudden-death
over-time.
Last night it was a different story as Sheffield dominated the three periods,
winning the first 2-0, the second 9-2, and the third 2-1.
On Saturday, Flyers' weekend got off to a bad start when they were caught cold
by Basingstoke and never recov-ered. They lost the first period 4-1 to the
former league leaders, and went down 7-3. Results:
Saturday: Premier division - Basingstoke 7, Fife 3; Milton Keynes 3, Sheffield
3; Nottingham 4, Cardiff 2; Slough 6, Humberside 11. Division 1 - Bracknell 19,
Billingham 0; Dumfries 4, Medway 3; Paisley 6, Blackburn 7; Swindon 10,
Manchester 6; Telford 12, Murrayfield 4.
Yesterday: Premier division - Humberside 9, Milton Keynes 2; Newcastle 4,
Cardiff 13; Sheffield 13, Fife 3. Division 1 - Billingham 6, Medway 9;
Blackburn 11, Bracknell 4; Chelmsford 1, Guildford 6; Murrayfield 2, Manchester

Gala 24, Hawick 23
IN the Gala committee room afterwards, I was bold enough to suggest that this
had been a terrific game of rugby, the kind to win supporters back to the
terraces and great fun for all concerned.
``Aye,'' came the immediate response from a worthy. ``I suppose it was grand if
you were a neutral.'' They have been battling with each other since 1876, after
all.
No matter that Gala appear doomed to demotion next term - although the latest
reconstruction rumour suggests we might have a 12 team First Division - this
was the Border Old Firm and pride is always more valuable than points. There
were Grants and Suddons and Patersons about and most of them have been fighting
since Flodden.
Gala should have won by the length of the High Street. Throughout the game,
their forwards, inspired by John Amos, who has been a light in the darkness all
season, sent back enough ball to win a championship.
Their backs, though, were not so slick and actually contrived to present two
tries to the opposition. Hawick could hardly believe they were back in the
match - then almost win it right at the death.
There was a wee bit of history made at half-time. When John Graham went off
hurt, on came Grant Harris for the Greens. This is the lad who has been
reinstated following a spell in rugby league with Carlisle. I cannot recall
such a happening in this fixture before. May it be the first of many.
Scott Welsh kicked the opening penalty for the visitors but Gavin Dalgleish
soon equalised that and added a second for good measure.
Robert Hogg knocked down a lineout ball to Tom Weir, who galloped away for a
Gala try of which brother Doddie would have been proud. Dalgleish converted and
added a penalty goal.
With the interval looming, Scott Paterson, an enterprising full back, joined
the line, Amos was there, too, and they made a try for Chris Dalgleish.
Hawick heads were hanging and fell even lower when Gavin Dalgleish put over
another goal. Welsh reduced the deficit with a penalty before Keith Suddon
pounced for the first of his two tries.
A breakdown in a Gala handling movement gave him the chance and when he was
gifted an interception and raced the length of the field for his second, he
must have checked the date on the calendar. Welsh converted the first, Colin
Turnbull the second.
Turnbull's next penalty cut the margin to a single point and the last quarter
was frenetic. Weir was almost over, so was David Liddle for Gala, but Jim Hay
took a vital strike against the head then very nearly grabbed to winner.
Referee Eddie Murray kept good control and his final whistle was greeted with
much joy. Among those celebrating was the Gala debutant Brian Laidlaw, son of
Scotland and British Lions hooker Frank.
Kent his faither.

q GLASGOW have lost John Lonergan for the inter-district championship programme
next month. The 32-year-old West of Scotland No.8, who has played three games
for Glasgow, most recently in the 21-7 win over Griqualand West last month, is
unavailable because of business commitments.
Lonergan's West colleague, David Barrett, had previously declared himself
unavailable. So had Stuart Simmers, Glasgow Academicals' scrum half and
captain. To those three losses can be added two Stirling County players, Mark
McKenzie and Brian Robertson, who have opted to switch from Glasgow to North
and Midlands this season.
Glasgow's team is expected to be named early next week for their opening match
in the district championship, against North and Midlands on Wednesday week, at
Beveridge Park, Kirkcaldy.

AS Stephen Gallacher departed for the European Tour Qualifying School in Spain
last week his uncle Bernard offered him some wise words. ``Don't try and win
the thing, just try and get your card,'' was the Ryder Cup captain's advice.
Though he has adopted a sensible approach in Spain this week, the 21-year-old
nevertheless trails the commanding leader, Thomas Buhrmann, by just four
strokes entering the critical final two rounds, having posted a three-under-par
69 across the harder San Roque course on the Costa del Sol yesterday.
With a stiff wind buffeting competitors the youngster's round was the lowest of
the day as scores soared into the high 80s. Gallacher played superbly and
recorded five birdies and only two bogeys.
The severity of playing conditions was best illustrated in the exploits of
Jeremy Robinson, a European Tour player for some seven seasons. Entering
yesterday's play at one-over-par he was comfortably positioned to make the
four-round cut, but crashed out dramatically with a 15-over-par 87.
Excellent putting on slick surfaces has been the key to the Scot's success this
week, although he revealed that some slight swing changes had brought an upturn
in fortunes.
``I noticed that I was coming over the ball slightly at the point of impact, so
I worked hard on the practice ground. I struck the ball superbly today,'' he
explained.
Raymond Russell of Longniddry posted a similar score, carding four bogeys, two
double bogeys and four birdies, including a sub-par score at the demanding
final hole. The 23-year-old fired a No.6 iron to the water-guarded green and
calmy rolled home a 20-foot putt.
``That left a nice taste but overall I am extremely frustrated, said Russell.
`` I am playing well but not scoring well. It has been the same story every
day, so hopefully soon something will happen.''
Sadly, the only other Scots to join that pair in the final two rounds are Scott
Henderson of King's Links and William Guy of Buchanan Castle. Leading

JOAO Havelange travels the globe like some benign overlord with the interests
of the world's poor occupying a large place in his heart. Sometimes he is
photographed with groups of Third World children, smiling down on them as
though he will make everything better and ensure decent futures for all of them.
Some might suggest, however, that instead of offering warm comfort his taut
grin might reveal that coldness which seemed evident when Margaret Thatcher
tried to speak softly and in motherly fashion to the nation. The former Prime
Minister usually appeared darkly threatening those times when she was
attempting to empathise with her people.
Whatever else Havelange may be, the Brazilian president of FIFA could be a
student of Machiavelli. How else could he be in his sixth four-year term as
leader of all of the world's footballing nations and threatening to hang around
for a seventh after the 1998 World Cup finals in France. He must be resisted.
When the finals open in France, Havelange will be 82 and, although age often is
little more than a state of mind, that really will be too old. Already he has
been around too long and claims of his greatness, as spouted by those who have
propped him up all these years, should be dismissed as no more than propaganda.
Many may have self-interest at heart, nothing else.
Like all leaders Havelange is a master of playing people off against one
another while surrounding himself with acolytes. Travel is undertaken in style
and comfort and domestic association would be wise to accommodate all the
president's men. Havelange, with the might of FIFA behind him, is a powerful
man.
Dissenters don't disappear in the still of a dark night but, suddenly, doors
which used to swing open might become jammed. Favours may be scattered
elsewhere and the pavement outside the establishment can be an exteremely cold
place.
FIFA, like the SFA and all other member associations, is a pyramid structure of
committees which makes manipulation possible. Say and do the right things, as
perhaps suggested by the main office, and a person's future could be assured
with that delegate absorbed into the system to be relied on to cast the correct
vote at the correct time.
Havelange has fended off challenges to his authority from within UEFA in the
past, but it is said the Europeans remain resentful of the president's almost
total dominance of the sport. UEFA were also further annoyed when some of their
people were removed from key FIFA committees after Lennart Johansson, UEFA's
president, challenged unsuccessfully Havelange's re-election last year.
However, Johansson is strong also and the struggle for supremacy between the
two continues with Europe's man having won a victory last week when both
presidents and the heads of the six FIFA regional confederations met in Zurich.
That gathering decided there should be a reorganisation of the sport by
widening the spread of authority and by boosting profits from the World Cup.
These changes were at Johansson's insistence and he also secured an agreement
in principle to rotate the World Cup finals on a strictly geographical basis,
although the decision on which continent would get the first open slot was
deferred. Japan or South Korea will host the 2002 finals, Europe, with Germany
already favourites, want the 2006 event.
South Africa also has made it clear they would want the finals at some point
and, of course, South America are complaining loudly that they haven't been
hosts since 1986.
During his lengthy reign Havelange, who ousted Sir Stanley Rous in 1974 and is
the only non-European to hold the FIFA presidency, has manoeuvred himself into
a position of power which is almost invincible. He angered many within football
and outraged the outside world when he promised Nigeria the next World Youth
Championship in 1997.
This so-called guardian of the people's game toured the African country on the
eve of the execution of nine human rights activists, and his presence there was
at odds with international condemnation of Nigeria's military regime. It was
the behaviour of a man perhaps distanced from reality, yet Havelange is the man
his people within FIFA would have the rest of us believe is a caring,
grandfatherly figure who feels for the under-privileged and all peoples
supressed by poverty and force.
Havelange comes from a country which carries the Third World's largest foreign
debt and the upper-class whites do not do enough to alleviate the suffering or
offer hope to the masses who exist in heart-breaking poverty.
Football needs a new leader, someone with more compassion and feeling and also
a president with vision. Johansson, who is 66 and will be too old himself soon,
was said to be one of those outraged by Havelange's visit to Nigeria and the
Swede should press ahead with his challenge to the Brazilian and continue to
dispute his actions.
Johansson is striving to erode Havelange's power base and has presented a
reform document, Vision, which is currently being discussed in the corridors of
power and the early indications are that UEFA's president is gaining ground,
although Johansson would never make the mistake of underestimating an opponent
with the durability of Havelange.
However, last week's Zurich meeting agreed to UEFA's proposals to boost
television and marketing income from the World Cup by opening up the bidding to
competition. FIFA's contract with its long-time marketing arm, ISL, expires in
1998 and offers have already been received for the selling of the 2002 World
Cup in Asia, worth an estimated $1 billion.
UEFA haved long believed the rights to the World Cup should generate at least
$800m, even though the 1994 World Cup finals in America brought in only $184m.
UEFA feel they have been sold short and they and the other regional
confederations want a greater share of the profits in future. UEFA and
Johansson also want the time-span of future presidential reigns clearly
defined, but Havelange and his people have not moved on that yet.
Naturally, they wish to perpetuate their rule and it is likely, if and when
Havelange decides he has to go - although that might only happen when the
pall-bearers finally catch up with him - he might have in mind a replacement of
his own who could challenge Johansson or any other European. Havelange has not
built a power-base around himself and his chosen ones only to have it crumble
when he relaxes his grip.
The power struggle between him and Johansson, the only European to criticise
Havelange repeatedly and to stand up to him in public, will continue and grow
in intensity. It is one we should hope Johansson wins, because the game can do
without more of Havelange's posturing and power-broking. He has enjoyed enough
of the good things the game has to offer and it is time someone more in touch
with the people took over.
Johansson is a determined and strong-willed character who understands the
machinations of those who crave position and influence and he is well aware of
the dangers in having one man in possession of so much power. He feels the
workings of FIFA should be more transparent to outsiders and wants to introduce
a greater degree of democracy into the world association and who could possibly
wish to deny either of these desires? Only one man perhaps, which is why
Johansson must fight on.

JOHN Higgins claimed his third victory of the season over Jimmy White in last
night's Royal Liver Assurance UK Championship third-round clash - and then
branded it ``one of the worst matches I have ever played in.''
The match was expected to be one of the highlights of the Preston tournament
with the winner facing 1991 champion John Parrott or Welshman Mark Williams in
the quarter-finals. After clinching a 9-6 success, Higgins described it as
``rubbish'' while White admitted: ``That was total garbage.''
White added: ``We were missing balls that weren't even pressure shots.''
Higgins, who had beaten Mark King and Alain Robidoux with fluent displays to
set up his showdown with White, said: ``I suppose you cannot make 100 breaks in
every frame unless you happen to be Stephen Hendry.''
The 20-year-old was never behind in the match after taking the first frame with
a 55 clearance. White levelled at 1-1 with a 66 break - his highest of the
match - but then trailed 4-1 and 5-3 at the end of the first session.
When the match resumed last night White should have snatched the ninth frame
but missed a yellow and Higgins went three frames ahead once more. Higgins had
a run of 73 to seal the match in the fifteenth frame.
Earlier, world No.12 Nigel Bond took the first three frames of the second
session to overwhelm Welshman Wayne Jones 9-2 and now plays Peter Ebdon, who
finished off Steve Lee 9-5.
History was made on Saturday when Hendry became the first player to achieve the
perfect clearance of 147 three times in competition.
Hendry, who made a maximum also in the world cham-pionship in Sheffield earlier
this year, repeated the feat in the fifth frame of his 9-2 success over Gary
Wilkinson.
The Scot then revealed the moment he knew he was on cue to compile this latest
147. ``I had made 72 when I began to realise the possibility,'' explained
Hendry. ``I could have taken a lower-value colour at that point, but you don't
get many chances to make a maximum, so I decided to go for it.
``It wasn't as nerve-racking this time because the one at The Crucible was my
first on television. However, the heart beat a little faster toward the end.''
In addition, Hendry also knocked in breaks of 100 and 105 to extend his total
of centuries in the event to seven - making it 18 for the season and 316 in his
career. In the quarter-final he will meet an Irishman - either Dennis Taylor or
Ken Doherty.
Weekend results (third round): S Hendry (Scotland) beat G Wilkinson (England)
9-2; P Ebdon (England) beat S Lee (England) 9-5; N Bond (England) beat W Jones
(Wales) 9-2; J Higgins (Scotland) beat J White (England) 9-6.
Today's order of play: 2pm and 7pm: K Doherty (Ireland) v D Taylor (N Ireland);
2pm: R O'Sullivan (England) v C Small (Scotland); 7pm: A Hicks (England) v J
Wattana (Thailand). Both matches resume 7pm tomorrow.
q THIS year's runner-up in the women's world championship, Kim Shaw, gained
some consolation yesterday by beating Anglo-Scot Lynette Horsburgh 4-3 for the
Scottish Regal Masters title in the John Spencer Snooker Club, Stirling.
In a tight match, Shaw took the deciding frame with a break of 52 to collect
the #1000 first prize.
Earlier in the day Blackpool-based Horsburgh beat No.1 seed Karen Corr 4-3
while Shaw defeated last year's Regal Masters runner-up Kelly Fisher 4-2 in the
other semi-final.

Edinburgh Academicals 15,
Watsonians 28
EDINBURGH Academicals are now contemplating a future which, barring any
alteration to the size of the leagues, will mean second division rugby for them
next season.
The result against Watsonians at Raeburn Place perhaps spared Academicals what
might have been a more protracted demise determined by other clubs, but there
is little question that they might have preferred a lingering death to a swift
exit under the ignominious cloud of a sending off.
The dismissal of Academicals' hooker Kenny Day just before half-time for
stamping arguably turned the game for Watsonians, who until the unsavoury
incident occurred had trailed 15-3. Watsonians ran the ensuing penalty,
resulting in an easy try for Mike Stanaway and a simple conversion by Gavin
Hastings. Seven points - but due punishment for behaviour that rugby does not
need.
Dave McIvor moved to hooker and not without some success, the Academicals'
flanker achieving a strike against the head. But stuck in the middle of the
front row, McIvor was lost to the fringe defence, making it much easier for
Watsonians to put together attacking moves that ultimately brought tries for
Andrew Garry and Gavin Hastings.
Watsonians might have scored more but for the loss of Duncan Hodge with a
recurrent shoulder injury (which could force the stand-off to miss Edinburgh's
opening district championship game with Scottish Exiles).
Martin Waite and Scott Murray are the kind of players Academicals must retain
if they are to make a return to Divison 1.
The other imperative is to have quality back-up players. Three of their backs
on Saturday are 19 while stand-off Sammy Dow has just turned 20.
Edinburgh Academicals - S Burns; C Newton, C Murray, M Duncan, G McKinley; S
Dow, P Simpson; J Fayers, K Day, D Graham, S Murray, M McVie, D McIvor, M
Waite, R Houle. Replacements - J Scott for Fayers (70min), A Adamson for Houle
(58).
Watsonians - G Hastings; F Henderson, S Hastings, A Garry, J Kerr; D Hodge, J
Weston; M Stanaway, S Farland, A Kittle, C Mather, S Grimes, G Hannah, C Brown,
J Macdonald. Replacement - S Carse for Hodge (55).
Referee - I Ramage (Berwick).
SCORERS: Edinburgh Academicals - Burns, 2t; Duncan, 1c, 1p. Watsonians - G
Hastings, 1t, 2c, 3p; Garry, 1t; Stanaway, 1t.

BRIAN McClair could return to the substitutes' bench for Manchester United
tonight despite having scored two goals recently against Coventry.
United manager Alex Ferguson must decide between Paul Scholes and McClair
before naming his team to face Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. Scholes,
United's top scorer this season with 10 goals, missed the 4-0 victory at
Highfield Road because of a cold - but may get the nod.
``There is always that possibility,'' said McClair. ``But I always look at
whatever game I play in, in the same way. I try and enjoy it and take whatever
I can from the game. We must wait and see what happens, but the club and team
are more important than individuals.''
United are out to narrow the gap on Premiership leaders Newcastle to three
points, and Ferguson said: ``Brian has given this club great service. He has
never complained and has always set out his stall to make sure whatever I ask
him to do he has the mental capacity and strength to do it.''
Forest's last match in the Premiership resulted in a 7-0 defeat at Blackburn,
which ended an unbeaten league record stretching over 25 matches. However, they
put the trouncing behind them in their next game by beating Lyon in a UEFA Cup
game.
Paul McGregor, who scored against the French side, is injured and will have a
fitness test before the United match. Forest also will be without Dutchman
Bryan Roy, out for a month after a cartilage operation, and striker Jason Lee,
who has yet to overcome a thigh injury.

WHAT do Malcolm Rifkind, George Galloway and Kenneth Clarke, to name but a few,
have in common? You won't guess so I'll tell you. They've all been pictured in
the papers recently puffing fat cigars.
Time was I would have envied them. What bliss, the curl of aromatic, blue
wisping smoke, the satisfying, blood-tingling fix from a fragrant corona. How
beautifully it complimented a glass of after-dinner malt.
My trouble was I could never smoke them in moderation. When you've been a
cigarette addict, especially a 40-a-day man like me, you cannot smoke cigars
without inhaling.
I know. There was a time an age ago when I quit cigarettes and cigars for two
whole years. One day, on the first tee at Gleneagles, I found myself being
tempted by a free packet of five half-coronas by the Wills tobacco people who
were sponsoring a press golf outing. Just one, I thought . . .
My colleague Ian Paul from the sports desk tutt-tutted when he saw I was losing
the battle of will.
``Look, if you must give in here's how to smoke without getting hooked again,''
he said. ``Just take a very deep breath before you take a draw - that way, you
physically can't inhale.''
Rubbish, of course. By the time I was on the 18th I had binged on the lot. But
I never went back to cigarettes. Worse, I became one of those idiots who think
they're doing themselves a favour by ignoring cigarettes in favour of deadlier
small cigars. Soon I was doing 10 and sometimes 20 cigarillos a day.
Next month I will have gone nine years without a smoke of any kind. I can
honestly say it is something I never - well, almost never - even think about.
Except at times like last week when I saw that picture of Gorgeous George
pulling on an expensive cigar with all the evident pleasure of capricious
self-indulgence.
The good news for those of us who have kicked the habit is that Europe is on
our side. Life for those who still choose to smoke, at least in non-consenting
company, is going to become yet more difficult.
Anyone who has visited the United States recently knows the problem. Smoking in
America is now near to treason. Its suppression is imposed with neo-Fascist
zeal. Smokers are hounded from restaurants, airports, hotels, even bars. They
cannot fly, travel by bus or rail, or even sit at their desks at work.
As a quitter, I sympathise with them, but only up to a point. I've gone
weedless long enough now to be offended by tobacco breath or by a stranger
recycling inhaled cigarette or pipe smoke in my face. But, like the kid
sniffing Bisto, I still love the bouquet of a passing cigar.
Philip Morris, the US tobacco conglomerate, is currently in a fight to the
death with the anti-smoking lobby in America and engulfed in litigation as it
runs a multi-million dollar publicity campaign claiming smokers are persecuted
and deprived of their individual rights.
Well, they have just made themselves a powerful enemy in the European
Commission which is taking up cudgels on behalf of non-smokers. In justifying
its partisanship, the commission argues that six major studies have all
concluded passive smoking definitely causes lung cancer, especially in children.
Smokers should be more considerate about the rights of non-smokers, it says,
pointing out smokers enjoy the same civil liberties in law as non-smokers. This
is not an area in which Brussels legislates, at least not just yet, perhaps for
the simple reason that smoking on the Continent is still much more prevalent
than it is in Britain.
Europe's turn of the screw on its smokers will be cranked another notch next
week when health ministers meet to discuss a proposed ban on tobacco
advertising. This is a touchy subject because the commission, to its shame,
gives far more of its millions every year to tobacco growers than it does to
the relief of cancer. For once commissioners will not be able to claim the
moral high ground.
British Tories, who don't want newspapers banned from carrying advertising,
will find the debate tricky, not least because the tobacco giants are
traditional funders of the Conservative Party.
If you are a smoker you might find all of this depressing. Be warned, it gets
worse.
You know how social trends in the United States inevitably become all the rage
in Britain? The really bad news is the Americans are now campaigning for an end
to drinking.

HEY everybody, guess what? Playwright Arthur Kopit has had this penetrating
insight into the workings of Hollywood. He reckons it's run by money-grabbing
philistines with shallow personalities and drug habits. And he's not afraid to
say so! Devastating critique, or what?
I wouldn't want to suggest the heart of the international movie industry is not
worthy of satire - Tim Robbins's The Player proves otherwise, for one - but
Road to Nirvana barely manages to tell us what we already know, never mind
broadening our knowledge, subverting it and throwing it back in debased form.
Take the portrayal of the titular pop star Nirvana (Tara Hugo), a send-up of
Madonna (the grunge associations presumably passing the playwright by). The
problem is we are all so thoroughly well-versed not only in the outward
achievements, the hit singles, the ambitious personality, the giant ego, but
also in the nature of the hype itself - our showbiz appetite being so voracious
we eat the machinery once we've chewed through the product - there really is
very little left to say.
So superstars surround themselves with yes-men to confirm an overblown sense of
their own importance - so what?
Kopit could have got away with it if he hadn't written something so
theatrically static. In Justin Greene's production it's a real
tables-and-chairs show, in the way of the most routine modern American drama,
with Michael Taylor's sets leaving nothing to the imagination.
It can be quite funny and there are some sparky stand-offs between Stephen
Frost, as a bullying would-be producer, and Lou Hirsch, excellent as his
degraded partner. However, lacking in purpose or surprise, the play never
survives longer than the moment.

THERE was a big sign on a lorry parked just round the corner from Kingston
Heath golf course in Melbourne yesterday. It read: ``Take no prisoners, Great
White Shark. Go get 'em, Greg.'' It was signed by Mark, with a note in the
corner saying: ``Dad helped.''
``That sort of thing's really special. It makes you feel nice,'' smiled Greg
Norman, the Great White Shark in question, who had been and gone and got 'em
and won the Australian Open.
The 40-year-old Australian surged home in 32, four under par, for a round of 68
and a total of 278, 10 under, and two shots better than fellow Aussie Peter
McWhinney. Frenchman Jean-Louis Guepy and Craig Parry, another Australian, tied
for third on 281.
``No win is ever easy,'' said Norman, who proved it with his second shot at the
thirteenth, where his drive finished on a sandy lie under the trees to the
right of the fairway. ``I hit a No.7-iron and I had to slice it 40 yards in a
130-yard shot.''
The ball ended 18 feet from the hole, the putt went in for a birdie 3 and,
since it was sandwiched between two birdie 4s, it took Norman to the head of
affairs on nine under par, alongside the tenacious McWhinney.
He, Guepy, Parry, and Stuart Appleby, a young Australian of whom great things
are expected, all shared the lead at one time or another, but they all slipped
away over the closing holes.
Norman hit a No.2-iron second shot from 212 yards just as he wanted at the
459-yard, par-4 seventeenth and holed the 40-foot putt to seal victory.
The first prize of #76,500 was less than John Daly won in the casino, where he
had more success on the blackjack table than he did on the course. A round of
73 left him sharing forty-third place on 294, but it was the 80 on Saturday
that ended his chances, a 9 at the sixteenth, where he four-putted, doing most
of the damage. Leading aggregates (Australian unless stated):
278 - G Norman 72, 69, 69, 68.
280 - P McWhinney 68, 70, 72, 70.

q SEIKI Okuda birdied the last two holes as he charged from behind with an
eight-under-par 64 to win the Casio World Open by one shot in Ibusuki, Japan.
Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki started the final round with a two-stroke lead and shot
a 68, but it wasn't enough. Leading aggregates:
274 - S Okuda 69, 72, 69, 64. 275 - M Ozaki 70, 69, 68, 68. 276 - K Tomori 69,

OFPANTS - the official pantomime watchdog - has been to Cumbernauld . . . and
declares that - after a few false sightings in other venues - panto-time has
really, truly, started.
Checklist at the ready, Ofpants was able to tick the following essentials:
audience participation, traditional tomfoolery - a bit of slapdash baking, a
ghostly flap, rampant flatulence, that sort of thing - and a very definite
set-to between good and evil, rooted in the Grimm scenario of Rumpelstiltskin,
but with equally grim echoes of our own market forces, for the sometimes
(overlooked) element of sharp topicality.
That said, the Cumbernauld show is more a piece of children's theatre than a
full-blown pantomime. Writer/director Simon Sharkey has fashioned a strong
narrative which incorporates the rarely-staged fairy tale within an appealing
wider framework.
The miller's daughter forced to spin straw into gold now has a friend - David
McGowan's Simon, a gentle wild boy who lives in the woods (which cunningly
allows for frequent appearances by cuddly furries, much pounced on by front-row
tots) and who upholds shinier values than the ``don't just get rich, get
richer'' greed factor that Rumpelstiltskin (a throatily threatening Tony
Ventre) relies on to beguile the king and country.
This is a show that needs the kids to listen, as well as shout out - not always
a priority with some age groups. But Sharkey's script, with Rumpelstiltskin's
world domination spell constantly linking the different adventures and setbacks
together, quite obviously caught the imagination of the young and the very
young children all around me on Saturday afternoon.
They weren't just enthralled, they were involved in puzzling it out. It also
looks marvellous - and a green forest glade which translates at the push of a
prop into market-place, throne room, or bedroom, which Richard Cherns's music
adds in wispy magical shivers of its own.
Well done the team for bringing a favourited but somewhat neglected classic
tale of good gold and greed before a new generation. And for doing it with such
style. I found myself thinking - this is the stuff that Disney used to be made
on, complete with winsome animals and, of course, a highly-animated cast.

In the age of desk-top publishing,
Clare Henry finds handmade books all the more noteworthy
Approaching Christmas, art exhibitions have a lighter touch, as though the
festive season and dark nights demand cheerful, witty, optimistic work. And
diversity. The current rash of new shows also demonstrates the high calibre of
indigenous Scottish art.
We are fortunate to live in a place that produces talented folk like Frances
Walker, Glen Scoullar, and Laura Harrison who, with a whisk of a brush, can
transport us to Tiree's idyllic beaches or sunny Tuscany.
But first there's Brought to Book at Glasgow's Collins Gallery till December
21. In a former life I was, fleetingly, a typographer. I still have a fondness
for fine print, especially when combined with beautiful images. Here 70 artists
show 200 handmade books, from immaculate letterpress (like Norman Ackroyd's Co
Mayo or Llandogo's Old Stile Press who produced George Mackay Brown's Margins
or W S Graham's Letters enhanced Douglas Thomson's woodcuts) to wacky pop-up
books, books with spinning pages, books in the heel of a shoe, covered in
tartan dolls - even books that have to be cooked to be read!
As you see, artists books are something special, often produced in very small
editions - a mere three-of-a-kind - and intended for intimate perusal by a
single ``reader''. In an age when desk-top publishing and electronic imaging
make uniform printing child's play, it might seem perverse that artists beaver
away at something unique. But the appeal of creating a work of art to be
scrutinised in the hand, while still providing the element of surprise that
turning over a new leaf brings, has obviously not palled.
Curator Morag Davidson sets the show in context with an introduction of
Matisse's famous Jazz (an all-time great), Warhol's Index Book and Alan Davie's
Magic Reader. Other big names include Jarman, Kosuth, Gillik, Breakwell,
Beattie, Tyson, Simon Cutts, Les Coleman, Cornelia Parker - and Simon
Lewandowski whose books are embellished with electric motors.
Scots to look out for include Elspeth Lamb, with a brand-new Birch Wood, a
dream of lyrical lithographic washes combined with text; Eileen Lawrence's
gentle watercolours; Jacki Parry's handmade paper book; Hamilton Finlay's
Garden Proposal from his son Alec's Morning Star Publications; Robert
Hamilton's Facadism; Margaret Hunter's Binding, printed in Berlin; and Karen
Strang's Insanadiorama.
While artists like Nicholas McDowall can conjure pure typography to make a
Charade book of humerous Bodoni typeface characters (25), Karen Strang's 28-box
series pushes the concept to its limit. Yet it's an eyecatching exhibit and
beneath its superficial, banal, sweet, and happy surface - with silver sparkle
hearts and roses, plastic Barbie dolls, madonnas, and toy clothes pegs - lurks
a dark subtext. Burning books is still seen as a sin. Burning women has not
long gone out of fashion.
``Lift the lid off any house, and there are undercurrents. Fred and Rosemary
West are the extreme example,'' says Strang. ``I began looking at witchcraft
around Stirling, where I live, and extended my research into the male view that
women, `bad or mad', need to be punished, via Freud, hysteria, insanity, and
religion.''
The last legal execution of Scottish women was in 1727. The Koran states ``men
have authority over women because God made the one superior to the other'' and
recommends beating.
In the 1950s assertive American housewives were routinely subjected to
lobotomy. Even the 1993 Journal of Psychiatry lists Plica, a medical condition
where ``high nervous female tension was found to vent itself in tangled hair''.
Stang interprets true yet bizarre historical examples, from Snow White to
eggplants and the Marian Cult. My favourite is Housework Fairy, ``discovered
between a skirting board and a settee''.
n FRANCES WALKER's childhood walks along the Ayr coast inform spectacular
screenprints commissioned for the new South Ayr Hospital, which she hopes will
provide something ``calm and contemplative for apprehensive pre-op patients''.
(At #200 they are cheap too.)
At Edinburgh's Talbot Rice she records other journeys, both literal and
spiritual, in two huge, memorable eight-panel screens, Machair Walk and
Atlantic Watch. They are a triumph - and a paean to her beloved wide horizons,
leaden skies, and spatial panoramas of the green, blue unfenced world of Tiree.
Less lyrical, but evoking the stubborn rocks and strata of the land, her pencil
carves the track of the Dun Burn, the dunes, Craignish strand: in snow or storm
an intelligent celebration of the land.
n AT Glasgow's Billcliffe Gallery Glen Scouller explores Italy. The heat sears
off the pantiles; the deep purple of Trevi, Val d'Elsa, Assisi, and San
Gimignano looks welcome. Known for his big, fluid watercolours, these new oils
have an engaging spontaneity. However, pattern has gained the upper hand in the
gate and hen pictures; in others heavy-handed bravado replaces panache. These
traits are symptomatic of a transitional phase; interesting to see what comes
next.
n CLAIRE BANKS has also been to Italy, courtesy of Alastair Salvesen's generous
travel award. Minimal and flat, I was disappointed by these pale, misty grey
compositions of colonnades, windows, and doorways. The best is Santo Spirito
with its precise yellow slits. At the RSA till December 13.
n AT William Hardie, Laura Harrison and Francis Farmer show colourful pictures.
Farmer views characteristic architectural motifs from Findhorn, Wiltshire,
Aberdour, and Italy from on high to create overlap designs. Harrison
immortalises flowers from her Whitecraigs garden in lush still lifes of roses,
lilies, carnations, and sunflowers. The small studies, like Amaryllis,
Courtyard, and Yellow Jug are a delight.
n MEANWHILE don't miss Sam Bough's lively nineteenth-century landscapes of
Dysart, Fife in general, and Newhaven at Bourne Fine Art, Edinburgh; Wendy
McMurdo's spectacular photographic illusions at Portfolio Gallery, or the
intense poetic blue installation by Moon Beom and off-the-wall sequinned fish
by Bul Lee; both in Korean Artists at the Fruitmarket.
As I said, diversity is in the air.

ANOTHER day and yet another fresh initiative. The weekend news that the English
and the Welsh have hammered out a plan which creates a new Anglo-Welsh league
from next season begs the question, where does that leave us in Scotland?
The Irish might well be asking questions along similar lines, but at least they
are already involved in Europe with their provincial sides. In Scotland, you
get the feeling that the game is charging on at an unfettered pace and we are
being left at the starting gate.
Basically, the Anglo-Welsh deal is this. Both domestic leagues will continue as
normal and the top four clubs will fly their respective national flags in
Europe. The remaining top eight clubs will play in the new cross-border league
and there will also be Twickenham and Cardiff games between the English and
Welsh cup and league champions.
The agreement was hammered out against a backdrop of ``club power'' in both
countries, the clubs flexing their muscles with the threat of a breakaway from
the national unions. The driving force is the need to pay the players, with the
potential revenue from glamorous club competitions being seen as the means to
that end.
So, the English and the Welsh have set in place a structure which, once fleshed
out with sponsors and a TV deal, has the makings of a nice little earner and -
equally importantly - a competition which the paying public will want to watch.
Meanwhile, north of the Cheviots what do we have to look forward to? Nobody
knows, and that is the sad truth of the matter. We will be in Europe next
season but whether we will be represented by club or district sides remains,
still, a matter for conjecture and it is high time that this matter was
resolved once and for all.
On Saturday past, the club championship would have been decided had it not been
for the messy postponements caused by the international commitments of the
country's leading players. Surely the clubs should have known by now whether
they were playing for a place in Europe or not.
Representation by district sides - or some hybrid amalgamation of the districts
- is the route favoured by the Scottish Rugby Union. Whether this remains the
case we do not know. We simply have not been told.
On the basis of playing strength, districts make sense. We have said that
before. But then what happens? The opening game in the district championship
between the the Exiles and the South, which was to have been played next
weekend, is cancelled. Cancelled mark you, not postponed, because premiership
business remains unfinished. Oh, what a tangled web we weave . . .
At a stroke, the district championship, from which so much is expected by
Murrayfield officialdom, is diminished and devalued. It is difficult, in the
face of such apparent perversity, to argue with clubs who say that they and not
the districts should be allowed to fly the saltire in Europe next season.
At Bridgehaugh on Saturday, Stirling County and Melrose - two of the most
prominent members of the pro-clubs lobby, and throw in Watsonians and
Boroughmuir, maybe, for good measure - were arguing privately that perhaps with
their present pool of players they might not be able to compete with the Baths
et al but if they got their hands on the pot of gold that European competition
guarantees then they could build teams to compete with the best.
And, they say, they could keep Scotland's star players in Scotland and, even
more pertinently, lure those who have gone south - or are about to - back to
their ain folk. They make a pretty convincing case.
Time marches on. We are almost at the turn of the year. What we principally
require is a decision from the SRU. The clubs have shown over the past couple
of months that they are, mostly, all at sea. The issue of European competition,
not least from a financial standpoint, is of the utmost importance. The time
for a decision is now.

BLACKBURN'S Graeme Le Saux and David Batty have buried the hatchet and are
staying with the champions, manager Ray Harford said yesterday after this draw
in London.
Club chairman Robert Coar will issue a statement today outlining the punishment
the England pair will face for last week's altercation in Moscow.
It will be at least one week's wages, a sanction Le Saux accepts but that Batty
was said to be unhappy with, fuelling suggestions that the club are prepared to
sell both men, with Arsenal and Leeds among the potential purchasers.
``Both are staying,'' said Harford, praising their apparent Highbury
reconciliation. ``It looked that way on the pitch - they were playing close
together as usual and I think they'll feel better for having played that game.
``They have sorted it out between themselves, and we have sorted it out too -
the fines and everything. We've tried to handle it as clean as we can, to be
firm and fair,'' he said.
The manager expects Coar to signal that an incident which split the Rovers
dressing room is over as far as the club is concerned, though both players
still face UEFA sanctions.
``Officially we want to make it as clear as possible that the affair is
ended,'' said Harford. ``I have spoken to Gordon Taylor (PFA chief executive)
and he was of the opinion that we should make the statement, take whatever
action we propose and, if UEFA or the FA want to know, we will tell them what
we have done.''
Yesterday's result gave Rovers only their second away point of the season. ``It
was important after the week that we've had that we went out and performed like
that,'' said Harford. ``We needed an away result, an away point.''
And the result came a no great surprise to Arsenal manager Bruce Rioch. ``After
the events of the last couple of weeks, Blackburn could have gone one of two
ways,'' he said. ``It either de-motivates you or you turn it to your advantage.
They set their stall out and were difficult to overcome.''
Rioch was disappointed with his side, adding: ``That was a disjointed
performance. It was a battle for us right from the early part of the game and
those are games you can lose 1-0.
``So there is a degree of satisfaction that after conceding four goals in the
last couple of games, we kept a clean sheet.''
Neither manager would criticise referee Graham Poll, who booked seven players,
with Rioch gagged by the FA after having criticised Martin Bodenham after a
recent game against Chelsea.
``I don't want to talk about the referee - I've had a letter from the FA in
regard to the last comments I made,'' said the manager.
The best chance of the afternoon yesterday came after 15 minutes when Mike
Newell beat the Arsenal central defenders to a cross from Stuart Ripley, but a
well-timed tackle from Lee Dixon on the six-yard line saved the day for the
Gunners.
Rovers had the ball in the net inside the last minute when Newell turned in a
cross from Alan Shearer, only for the goal to be wiped out by an offside flag,
much to the delight of the Arsenal support.
Arsenal 0, Blackburn Rovers 0

WHEN a concert consists of works by Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, and Shostakovich,
it is safe to guess that at least two of them will be stock favourites. But
there was nothing predictable about Alexander Lazarev's choice of music on
Saturday.
Even the structure of the evening was unusual, with a leisurely orchestral
suite in the first half, a tight-knit concerto and symphony in the second.
Surprisingly, given the conservatism of RSNO audiences, there was a full house,
which suggested a degree of trust in Lazarev as a purveyor of neglected
Tchaikovsky and in the brilliant young Jean-Yves Thibaudet as soloist in a by
no means user-friendly piece of Rachmaninov.
It was, in fact, Tchaikovsky's second suite that was the evening's revelation,
if not in performance terms, it's most complete success. Music as idiosyncratic
as this - the third of its five movements calls for a band of accordionists -
needed to be played with more character and charm than Lazarev's efficiently
cool but rather ruthless conducting of it allowed.
The accordion episodes, played in rather strait-laced fashion by two members of
the orchestra, went for nothing, and the slow movement lacked atmosphere. Nor
could a programme note that failed to mention the accordions or to provide a
meaning for the word ``kazachok'' (a species of folk dance) have been said to
serve the work's best interests.
But the Rachmaninov, which can sometimes sound like pages of empty passage-work
in search of a theme, suffered no such setbacks in a performance so vividly
integrated that neither its structure nor content was ever in doubt. Even
better was Shostakovich's ninth symphony, a masterpiece beneath whose terse,
brittle jollity lies an abyss of melancholy and bitterness.
Lazarev's lacerating performance conveyed its tensions with chilling,
disturbing precision.

THE five-strong Scottish contingent in the Great Britain women's hockey squad
certainly can't be accused of not pulling their weight in the successful
Olympic qualifying campaign in Cape Town, for they were responsible for nine of
the team's 10 goals.
Topping the British scorers' list was Rhona Simpson. She had failed to find the
target for Britain in 43 internationals, but she hit form in Cape Town, scoring
four in their last five matches, including the confrontation on Saturday
against South Africa.
Simpson hit the target after 29 minutes meeting a cross from the right by Jane
Sixsmith with all the energy she could muster, to give Great Britain a 1-0
victory which should have been more impressive.
Indeed, it might have been had Susan MacDonald enjoyed some luck, for she hit
the crossbar with a penalty.
The other contributors to the Scottish scoring tally were Susan Fraser (three),
and Pauline Robertson (two). Britain's victory gave them second place in the
event and they go to Atlanta with victors Korea, along with Germany, Argentina,
and Holland where they meet defending champions Spain, world champions
Australia, and hosts USA.

Just when everything looked lost
in France, the BBC SSO came
up with a real winner,
says MICHAEL TUMELTY
THE experience was likened to touring Poland in the mid-eighties: ``We don't
know where we're going, how we're going to get there, if we're going to get
there, or how long it's going to take,'' said a veteran BBC Scottish Symphony
Orchestra musician, as the 72-strong orchestra piled on to three coaches for a
motorway race between Paris and Metz in an attempt to beat a national transport
strike on Friday and get the SSO to its next concert.
The orchestra was never supposed to have been in Paris. The strike had meant
that the charter flight on its mini tour from Bordeaux in the south to Metz in
the north couldn't go, and only the persistent inquiry of the group's courier,
representing the promoters - the Paris-based IMG group - had uncovered a single
flight from Bordeaux to Orly airport in Paris; and one, moreover, that could
accommodate such a large party.
The concert in Metz was within a hair's breadth of being cancelled, and the
orchestra kept in Bordeaux. Having made it, the unanimous feeling in the party
was that it was worth it - in fact, that all the vicissitudes and uncertainties
gave the playing a real edge. Not only was the Arsenal concert hall in Metz an
absolute stunner - a cathedral in wood with an explosive acoustic - but the BBC
SSO, with conductor laureate Jerzy Maksymiuk, turned out a series of scorching
performances that brought it an ovation from the large crowd.
What, above all, made it worth it was a classic BBC SSO performance of James
MacMillan's percussion concerto, Veni, Veni Emmanuel, with soloist Evelyn
Glennie in consummately theatrical form, turning out a real display piece for
the audience.
Glennie has done this concerto so many times now that she has its technical and
almost balletic elements absolutely at her fingertips. What was particularly
interesting was the SSO performance. It had had a single rehearsal session with
the concerto (which it had not played before) in Glasgow. Then there was the
first performance in Bordeaux which demonstrated the phenomenally rapid rate of
absorption of new material by this orchestra, which is used to turning over
unfamiliar music faster than any other.
But the Bordeaux performance lacked that final touch, where the whole thing is
absolutely together - there's an indefinable moment when you know that an
orchestra has stepped over a threshold with a piece and has acquired the feel
for its size, structure, shape, momentum, climaxes, and the rest. That happened
the next night in Metz, where, enhanced by an acoustic that gave the piece an
enormous impact, everything starting locking into place. It was a cracker.
As was the performance - typically Maksymiuk: big shapes, rolling climaxes,
boiling intensity - of Sibelius's Second Symphony, infinitely better played
than Dvorak's New World Symphony the previous night. And the same went for
Elgar's Introduction and Allegro, dry and boxy in the poor Bordeaux hall, big
and burnished in Metz.
The SSO doesn't get abroad much any more. (Who does?) The Metz Arsenal
performance, in a tiny if eventful little tour, made it absolutely worth the
bother.
Michael Tumelty reports on the future of the BBC SSO in Wednesday's music
column.

IT is a well-known fact that dreams rarely come true. But if yours was to run
down the tunnel at Hampden with Kenny Dalglish, then the good news is that
after 1998, it will probably be possible.
For when the National Museum of Football opens in the new South Stand at
Hampden, there will be a themed, Disneyesque element to it and with advances in
technology you, too, could play with the greats.
Of course, the proposed museum will be, first and foremost, an archive for
football history with memorabilia coming from many different sources including
the League, SFA, and Queen's Park Football Club.
Austin Reilly, director of the national stadium, says Hampden is the ideal site
for the museum. ``After all, Queen's Park is the oldest club in the world still
playing at senior level. They treasure that tradition.''
The museum also will have an educational element. ``Many schools have projects
about football and the museum plan provides for educational rooms, so that
youngsters can come in and key in to the library and trace all they want to
know about the players and clubs,'' said Reilly.
``We are taking the museum plan very seriously. It's a crucial part of our
submission to the Millenium Commission.''
The museum would be the first of its kind in the UK. But what about another
first - a Museum of Sport for Scotland.
The country has a myriad of art and cultural galleries but nowhere that honours
the many sporting achievements of Scots in one place. As well as the Hampden
plan there is a golf museum in St Andrews but we could follow the example of
the Sports Museum of New England in Boston.
It incorporates computers, videos, interactive exhibits, and memorabilia from a
range of sports including baseball, golf, American football, boxing, racing,
basketball, and motorsport.
Visitors can trace the life of local man Johnny Kelly, a working-class hero who
became a sporting legend at marathon running. He ran in 61 Boston marathons and
was 83 when he gave up. During his career he was the winner twice and second
seven times and at 62, was as fast as he had been at 25.
There's even the opportunity for visitors to experience Heartbreak Hill as a
wheelchair competitor.
Many cases are given over to exhibits of strips and details of classic baseball
clashes and there is a fascinating insight into ferocious contests between Yale
and Harvard.
Football is also covered in the museum. There is a line-up photograph of the
Clan MacPherson team of 1928. With names like Anderson, Munro, MacTavish,
Haldane, and Dundas, it's plain that Boston immigrants from Great Britain
didn't just come from Ireland.
There's even a programme from a game in 1928 when Rangers went to Boston. The
league-and-cup winners played in front of a crowd of 10,000. And in 1967 the
Shamrock Rovers of Boston played Dundee in May and then Dundee United in June.
One aspect of the Boston example Scotland would hopefully avoid. The museum is
in a shopping mall. But others examples are worthwhile.
We would have the opportunity to pay tribute to the achievements of athletics
heroes like Allan Wells and Liz McColgan, boxing greats like Benny Lynch and
Ken Buchanan, motor racing legends Jim Clark and Jackie Stewart, and a myriad
of others. A Museum of Scottish Sport has much to commend it.
But if the planners are looking for ideas for the football museum there are
plenty of galleries and rooms that could be included at Hampden. Why not
include an interactive mock-up street so that today's youngsters can savour the
atmosphere of where the great players came from?
Or a virtual reality of all our yesterdays at Hampden. Essential equipment
would be two cans of lager. First you drink them and then teeter perilously on
them for a glimpse of the game through the swaying, 100,000 crowd.
There would have to be a punishment block. In it, Scotland's World Cup songs
could be constantly played. Imagine an hour of Yaba Daba Doo We Support the
Boys in Blue, followed by We're on the March with Ally's Army - if you dare.
The House of Horrors could show all the cruel and wicked deflections and
another gallery would have sunglasses provided on entry. This room would be
full of Arthur's jackets. Mind you, Mary Hateley could probably provide a few,
too.
Finally, there would be a look into the future. In 2020, Traynor would still be
bemoaning the state of football in this country and demanding that we follow
the example of the Ajax system.

ALAN Lorimer wrote that it was a blow to John Manson, the Stirling County prop
forward, perhaps to miss the chance to play against Western Samoa because he
had been selected as a replacement for the international last Saturday. So I
was sorry for John Manson. Better to play than watch any day.
He did, however, get a better chance to meet the Samoans than any member of the
Glasgow team. While Edinburgh, the South, the North and Midlands, and Scotland
all had fixtures against the tourists, there was no fixture for Glasgow.
Moreover, there were two fixtures in Edinburgh and none in Glasgow. Yet Glasgow
is the largest centre of population in Scotland.
What is the Scottish Rugby Union's game? Is it scared that rugby will develop
in Glasgow and become such a popular sport here that the Edinburgh and Border
domination of SRU officialdom will be overthrown?
And what about the Glasgow committee men? Are they not strong enough to obtain
for Glasgow its fair share of matches against touring sides? My recollection is
that the last two were well run at Old Anniesland and very well supported by
the Glasgow public.
A bit of democracy would do the trick.

Currie 7, Jed-Forest 31
THERE had been talk that this end-of-league encounter, during which only pride
was at stake, would be given over to a feast of running rugby.
It did not quite turn out that way but on a perfect afternoon at Malleny Park,
we did see some flashes of what these teams do best - attacking at pace and
turning unlikely opportunities into exciting passages of play.
Jed-Forest's only disappointment from an excellent Premiership campaign is that
they are not going up to Division 1 as champions. Yet they can take
considerable satisfaction from the fact that they twice inflicted heavy defeats
on Currie in whose clubrooms the trophy will rest.
Jed coach Donald Miller was full of beans after his charges had run in four
tries and outplayed the champions in most departments.
He and his colleagues will be considering life after Gary Armstrong, who is now
99% certain to be teaming up with Rob Andrew at Newcastle.
It was probably Gary's best performance of the season, and with Ronnie
Kirkpatrick, Scott Foster, and Howler Brown in sparkling form, this was
approaching a vintage Jed display.
Currie were without playmaker Ally Donaldson, resting a sore back, and their
regular front row and seemed a little out of sorts.
So out of sorts, indeed, that they were 21 points adrift inside half an hour
after Brown, Kevin Barrie, and Norman Kerr - replacing hamstring tear victim
Chris Richards and playing a blinder - had crossed for tries and Kevin Amos
added goal points.
Amos, kicking superbly, added a penalty goal before big Mike Blair finished off
a Currie attack with a try which John Morrison converted.
It was left to Brown to finish matters off with a try as Jed took charge of the
game following hooker Alan Glen's concussion and departure to hospital for a
precautionary check-up. Amos, needless to say, added the final conversion.
Currie - D R Sheppard; G W Keen, M J Plumb, D C Wilson, S Forrester; J
Morrison, D Rogerson; D Massey, A R Glen, M Smith, C Eagle, M Blair, B W Ward,
F Thompson, S Logan. Replacements - N Matthews for Sheppard (59min), I Russell
for Glen (73).

Foster, R M Kirkpatrick, C J Brown. Replacement - N Kerr for Richards (6).
Referee - J L Bacigalupo (Edinburgh Wanderers).
SCORERS: Currie - Blair, 1t; Morrison, 1c. Jed-Forest - Amos, 4c, 1p; Brown,

IN selecting the Rachmaninov Trio for their final act, the organisers of the
Fifth Anniversary Celebrations of Jewish Arts in Glasgow could hardly have made
a better choice. Incredible though it seems, this particular combination of
players has been appearing since only Mayfest last year, notwithstanding the
much longer association between violinist Lev Atlas and cellist Alexander
Volpov. In such a short space of time this trio has firmly established its
reputation for displaying a consummate musicianship that brings a thrilling
animation to whatever they play.
For this programme a familiar work by Mozart and Tchaikovsky respectively was
placed outside a piece by the now forgotten Moscheles, whose personal contacts
stretch from Salieri through Beethoven to Chopin.
The Mozart Trio K548 saw Phillip Silver particularly relaxed at the piano
despite an obvious throat irritation. His bright touch was echoed by his string
partners in a thoroughly jolly account.
Moscheles Piano Trio given here as a Scottish premiere 165 years after its
composition, was entertaining stuff with a couple of false endings and a cute
19th-century Disney view of Scotland in the Scherzo alla Scozzese movement. The
vintage performance though was reserved for Tchaikovsky's mammoth Piano Trio.
Only two movements, but the first can seem to go on a bit in less skilful
hands. These performers, however, have a magneticism that draws the listener in
to live the music with them. No surprise then that the Rachmaninov Trio now
have a recording contract.

UNITING THE KINGDOM, THE MAKING OF BRITISH HISTORY
Edited by Alexander Grant
and Keith Stringer
Routledge, #25
THE British history mentioned in the sub-title of this book carries a novel
connotation. In the traditions of the historical profession in the United
Kingdom, the terms British history and English history have been fairly well
interchangeable.
This, of course, echoed the linguistic usage of English people, who make little
distinction between Britain and England. They assume everything which happens
to England also happens to Britain as a whole, and nothing can happen to
Britain unless it happens to England.
Sloppy as the usage is, the run of historians has followed it. Until recently,
it was in no way abnormal for books of supposedly British history to give not
so much as an entry in the index for Scotland, Wales, or even Ireland. To
devote a chapter to them would have been thought superfluous to the point of
eccentricity.
Scottish, Welsh or Irish history were specialised subjects, like the history of
sewerage or the history of ladies' underwear. Almost by definition, they could
not enter into the great epic of British history, of which the vast bulk was
provided by English history, for the reasons just stated.
With this present collection of essays, however, the term British history comes
nearer to its literal meaning. In the principle, English, Scottish, Welsh and
Irish history are treated as deserving of equal consideration. On the axiom
that the whole is greater than the parts, a genuine effort is made to bring out
the contributions to the United Kingdom of its smaller nations.
The aims are thus worthy, though they do little more than respond to what
historians of the smaller nations have tried for years to put across to English
colleagues, to be greeted with indifference or scorn. What makes the difference
now is that English historians have been driven to conclude their grand
tradition no longer explains their country's past or present.
This sea-change is here ascribed primarily to John Pocock, a New Zealander who
has spent much of his career in the United States. In the volume's envoi,
addressed to the British, he recalls how he felt in 1973, ``after the great
divorce which occurred when you told us that you were Europeans, which we, as
New Zealanders, were not; so that after all those generations in which you had
allowed the notion of empire to shape your identity, we were to learn that you
cared as little for our past as for our future. What you did, of course, was
irrevocably and unilaterally to disrupt a concept of Britishness which we had
supposed we shared with you.''
That same year Pocock
Now he can say: ``I told you so.'' It is generally admitted Whig history's day
is done, and academics are busily constructing the new subject Pocock called
for. He himself is the guru of endeavour. In 1994, the prestigious annual
Anglo-American Conference of Historians sought to find out how far things have
gone. This book is the result.
Things seem to me to have some way to go yet. The collection has no doubt
turned out the better for being edited by two Scots at Lancaster University,
which for some reason is, in literature and politics as well as in history, a
more impressive centre of Scottish studies than most institutions in Scotland.
They reproduce 19 papers from the conference, covering 1000 years of history,
Most of them - despite the worthy intentions not quite all - deal in dense
academic detail with some aspect of relations among the four nations.
It still struck me as odd that not one comes from a Scot working in Scotland,
though there are three from Scots working in England. Nor is there any from a
Welshman. There are two from Irishmen, one each from North and South. The other
14 are from Englishmen, most out of the Golden Triangle of Oxford, Cambridge
and London.
Evidently Celts are unfit for high table just yet. There may be fears they
would get drunk and throw bread-rolls; some would. This is, however, not just a
matter for whinging Jocks. I was impressed with the aspersions on the whole
proceedings as in passing, before he discoursed learnedly on centralisation in
the sixteenth century, by Nicholas Canny, a wild-haired man from Galway who
still manages to be an excellent historian.
He had several criticisms of British history as conceived by recent coverts to
it. It is so fixated on high politics that it widens the existing gap between
political history and social or economic history. Then it implies an integrity
for the British Isles in excess of any that ever existed, and passes over links
between their different peoples and Europe. New British history often comes out
looking like old English history, for the concern is still with events regarded
as pivotal for England. Again, it ignores deep diversities which have made it
hard for the British peoples to live within one state. Finally, it can be
written by scholars who have not just English but three Celtic languages and
Latin.
Canny hits his nails right on the head. Talking to English historians, I have
often been struck by an immutable attitude among them. They might once have
dismissed Scottish history as an antiquarian subject on which there was nothing
useful to say for the period after 1707. If not, why had no Scottish historian
said it? Indeed, no Scottish historian had said very much.
Recently, the tune has changed somewhat. It will be conceded that more and
better history is now being written in Scotland than at any time since the
eighteenth century. But as this sets out from the view that Scotland was and is
a distinct community, a nation no less, it is regarded as lacking the wider
reference new British history demands.
In other words, there can be no internal dynamic in Scottish history, no
independence in it, to use a loaded word, and nothing to be undestood on its
own terms. While that view persists, I believe no properly British history will
be written, because it will remain too anglocentric.
So Scottish and other exotic historians should be allowed a place at the high
table. It might be found that, despite their odd table manners, they have
something to say.

PARTICK Thistle, crippled by injuries for most of the season and fighting for
premier division survival on a shoestring budget, were hit by more trouble at
the weekend when keeper Nicky Walker suffered a broken cheekbone during the 2-0
defeat by Raith Rovers at Firhill.
Walker took the knock early in the match, but played on with the help of pain
killers. ``I don't know who else was involved in the incident, but I felt it
straight away,'' said Walker. ``I was in a fair bit of pain in the latter
stages of the match.''
The keeper, who has been having an outstanding season, went straight to
hospital for X-rays and treatment, and the outcome is that he has played his
last match this year.
Said manager, Murdo MacLeod: ``I was pleased that Nicky got through the match,
but it was obvious the injury was causing him a lot of pain. He will now have
an operation and the doctor has told us he could be out for eight weeks. It's a
terrible blow on top of all the other things that have been happening.''
Thistle had five players undergoing fitness tests before Saturday's match, and
although four of them played, they were obviously not fully fit. Such is the
shallow strength of MacLeod's squad that such risks have to be taken.
``We have been trying to bring new faces to the club, but it isn't easy,'' said
the manager. ``However, we must do something positive. What with all the
injuries and other players nearing suspensions, we don't have a lot to fall
back on.''
That is one of the reasons why MacLeod will delay moving for a replacement for
Walker. Instead, he will field 26-year-old reserve keeper Mark Cairns, signed
from Gala Fairydean, against Aberdeen at Firhill on Saturday.
Said MacLeod: ``Our priority must be outfield players. Already we are talking
with three clubs about possible deals and something could move early in the
week.
``As far as the goalkeeping situation is concerned I am happy to go along with
Mark Cairns at the moment and then we will have another look at the situation.
He has been playing well in the reserves and will now get his chance to see
what he can do at the higher level.''
q.MORTON manager Allan McGraw did not forget about a farewell evening for new
Ranger Derek McInnes on Saturday, despite the fact that he had been rushed to
hospital in Dunfermline after suffering what was, at the time, believed to be
chest pain.
McInnes, who recently left Cappielow to join Rangers in a #300,000 deal, laid
on a special evening out for his former team-mates and McGraw was also invited.
The manager, however, was detained in the Dunfermline hospital - but he still
managed to get a special message to McInnes.
Morton coach John McMaster said yesterday: ``We were all worried about Allan.
But it is so typical of the man that when Eddie Morrison and I went into see
him on Saturday evening, he gave us a message for Derek.
``He told us to get in touch, let Derek know what had happened, and that he was
fine, and that everyone should enjoy the night out.
``But we were really worried beforehand for he was sweating and complaining of
a pain in his chest. However, he reckons it is a stomach problem.''
Tests were carried out over the weekend, and the Morton manager was allowed
home from the cardiology unit. What did he do? Watched the Coca-Cola Cup final
on television.
It's really difficult to keep a good man down, is it not?

THE confusing incident towards the end of the match between Scotland and
Western Samoa indicates the need for a new rule about which I have written
previously. Again, I propose that penalty kicks for illegal offences (i.e.
against the person) as opposed to technical offences, should be taken from a
designated penalty spot no matter on which part of the pitch the offence has
taken place.
The same rule could be considered for all team sports.
