EVERY man on Earth today is related, linked by a Y chromosome to a common
ancestor who lived about 190,000 years ago, a new study suggests.
This so-called ancestral Adam was among many males who lived before
anatomically modern humans evolved but he's the only one purported in the study
to have a genetic legacy that persists today.
``We would all have a Y chromosome that existed in the same guy,'' said Mr
Michael Hammer, an assistant research scientist at the University of Arizona,
whose study appeared yesterday in the journal Nature.
The Y chromosome is one of the 24 kinds of microscopic threads that hold genes.
Unlike the other chromosomes, it is passed only from father to son.
Mr Hammer compared the detailed makeup of a tiny piece of the Y chromosome
sampled from eight Africans of various backgrounds, two Australians, three
Japanese, and two Europeans. The idea was to look for how varied that piece was
among the different ethnic groups and then calculate how long it would take for
evolution to produce the diversity he found.
The results suggest that all men alive today could trace their Y chromosomes
back for about 188,000 years to the same person.
Mr Hammer said his findings also suggest a single place of origin for modern
humans. The findings don't indicate where but Africa is a good bet, he said.
The study found evidence that modern-day humans resulted from a relatively
small breeding population over the past 200,000 or so years. The group was so
small that it is hard to believe its members could have been spread out over
more than one continent, Mr Hammer said.

A YOUTH told a court yesterday how a policeman banged his head against the
inside of a police van.
It was alleged at Perth Sheriff Court that Constable Graham Howie, 31, also
grabbed Richard Hind, 17, by the neck and pulled him off his bicycle.
Richard Hind told the court Mr Howie came up to him in a street where there
were a group of youngsters ``mucking about''.
As he was pulled off the bike, he claimed said he pleaded with the constable:
``Get off me, you're choking me.''
He claimed Mr Howie banged his head off the side of the van.
Richard, of Ainslie Gardens, Perth, admitted that he struggled but said he
should not have been arrested.
Mr Howie denies assualting the youth in Gowans Terrace, Perth, on October 27
last year.
He also denies assaulting Mr Daniel Ferns, 19, on Octoer 23 last year.
Mr Ferns claimed he had been left with marks on his neck after the constable
grabbed him at his house.
Mr Ferns, of Strathtay Road, Perth, said Mr Howie and a policewoman came to his
door just after midnight and wanted to speak to him about an assault on a
police officer.
After he said would not talk to them at that time, he was told he was being
detained and that Mr Howie took a hold of his wrist.
Mr Ferns said he was then pinned to the wall.
Mr Howie had originally faced five charges of assault and four charges of
breach of the peace when his trial started on Wednesday.
During yesterday's proceedings, the constable, whose address was given as c/o
Tayside Police headquarters, Dundee, was cleared of three charges of breach of
the peace and two of assault.
Sheriff David Sutherland adjourned the trial until December 18.

THE sister of Tory MP David Ashby, who is suing for libel over a newspaper
allegation that he was a homosexual, was out to destroy him, the High Court in
London heard yesterday.
Mrs Lynne Garling and her solicitor husband, Victor, made anonymous phone calls
to the Sunday Times in January 1994 which led to the newspaper's story that the
55-year-old MP had shared a bed with a male friend on a holiday in Goa the
previous November, said Mr Geoffrey Shaw, QC.
He referred Mr Justice Morland and a jury to the article in which Mr Ashby is
quoted as saying that Mrs Garling was a ``vicious, sick woman motivated solely
by malice and who despises me''.
Mr Shaw said Mrs Garling believed the MP for North West Leicestershire was
having an affair with a Dr.Ciaran Kilduff and had often spoken of exposing him
to the media.
When he was in Goa - alone - she had made call after call to try to track him
down and gather evidence against him.
The calls to the newspaper, alleging that Mr Ashby was having a homosexual
affair with Dr Kilduff and that he had left his wife for him, could only have
come from Mrs Garling and her husband, even though they denied it.
``It certainly seems she was out to destroy him,'' said Mr Shaw. He believed
her objective was to force her brother to resign as an MP.
Mr Ashby is claiming damages over the January 1994 article which, he says,
alleged he was a practising homosexual who had misled his wife, Silvana - from
whom he separated two months before it appeared - about the nature of his
sexuality.
It also meant he had lied to the public about having an affair with Dr Kilduff
during a trip to France early in 1994, and was a hypocrite in emphasising the
importance of the family in his last election address.
Times Newspapers Ltd, and former Sunday Times editor, Mr Andrew Neil, deny
libel, although they accept Mr Ashby did not holiday with a man in Goa.
Mr Shaw said their defence of justification included the assertion that Mr
Ashby was and is carrying on a homosexual relationship with Dr Kilduff.
Mr Shaw said it was clear that Mrs Garling had ``hated'' her brother since
early 1993 at the latest.
He dismissed a letter from the Sunday Times to Mr Ashby which denied that Mrs
Garling was the original source of the information.
``We say, of course she was.''
The hearing was adjourned until today, when Mr Shaw will continue his opening.
Mr Ashby is not likely to go into the witness box until Monday.

BILL Wyman's wife Suzanne was so overcome with the excitement at the premiere
of the new Bond film GoldenEye that she went into labour.
The ex-Rolling Stone and his wife are now the proud parents of daughter Jessica
Rose, they announced yesterday.
``Most women find it pretty exciting just watching Pierce Brosnan and obviously
Suzanne is no exception,'' their spokeswoman said.
Suzanne Accosta, 35, started feeling contractions during the Royal premiere of
the film at the Odeon, Leicester Square on Tuesday evening, though she had not
expected to have her baby for another two days.
The Prince of Wales was in the audience, as were Brosnan, Tina Turner, and a
host of other stars.
Immediately the film finished, Bill, 57, and Suzanne rushed to hospital, and
Jessica was born at 3pm on Wednesday.
She weighed 6lb 5oz.
``Both mother and daughter are doing very well and Bill and Suzanne are very
happy and delighted,'' the spokeswoman said.
The couple already have one daughter, Katharine Noelle, aged 14 months, and
Bill has a grown-up son, Stephen, from a previous marriage.

A WOMAN spoke yesterday of her shock at being stranded on a bridge when flood
waters immobilised her car, shortly before it collapsed and two teenagers
drowned when their car plunged into the River Kelvin.
Mrs Margaret Brownlie, 43, told a fatal accident inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff
Court, that she was going to pick up her husband from work on the afternoon of
Sunday, December ll last.
Because of severe flooding, she asked her son Stewart to go with her, and his
wife and baby came along, also in the car was her 85-year-old mother.
Mrs Brownlie, of Gartshore Crescent, Twechar, Strathclyde, told Mrs Margaret
Porter, leading the evidence, that as she approached Gavell Bridge there was
water across the road and in nearby fields.
She said: ``We decided to go on very, very slowly. when a deluge of water
washed over the car and the engine cut out.
My son jumped out of the car and the water came in. Stewart went to the back of
the car and tried to push it across the bridge but it would not move.''
She told the inquiry that the water was up to six-foot Stewart's waist and a
man standing at the bridge wall shouted: ``You had better get them off the
bridge, it's going to go.'' Her car was eventually towed off the bridge by a
man who attached a rope to his van.
Mrs Brownlie was giving evidence at the inquiry into the deaths of John Furay,
l7, of The Strone, St John's Way, and James McClement, l7, of Kelvin View, both
Kilsyth.
They drowned when the red VW Polo car being driven by John plunged from the
collapsed bridge.
A third youth, James Gibson, l7, of Differ Avenue, Twechar, kicked the car door
open, jumped into the river, and managed to reach safety.
Mrs Brownlie said she should never have been allowed to go on to the bridge
that afternoon and that it should have been closed.
The inquiry before Sheriff Bruce Kerr QC, continues.

CABINET Ministers yesterday delightedly leapt on evidence of discontent within
the Shadow Cabinet about the role of Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown which
forced Mr Tony Blair into a declaration that Mr Brown had his ``101% support''.
There had been murmurs that some Shadow Ministers were unhappy about the
intervention of Mr Brown into their departmental responsibilities.
A meeting of Labour back benchers was mostly critical of the complaints, and Mr
Blair let it be known that he was right behind Mr Brown, whose influence rivals
that of deputy leader John Prescott.
However, he also reassured Shadow Cabinet members that they will be involved
from the start in any tactical or policy decisions involving their areas of
responsibility taken by the team headed by Mr Brown, which deals with
day-to-day reactions to events.
The Prime Minister sought to cast doubts on the Blair-Brown solidarity in the
Commons. He said: ``The 1% I am sure is correct, the 100% I am not so sure of.''
Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said he was anxious to
protect Mr Brown against the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Mr Robin Cook, or anyone
else who wanted to take him on.
He said the Government wanted Mr Brown kept in his job and also the Shadow Home
Secretary, Mr Jack Straw.
Mr Brown's role goes beyond that of Treasury affairs and he has ruffled some
colleagues' feathers for not consulting them sufficiently, in their view.
A senior Labour official said: ``Gordon is in charge of a committee which meets
daily to discuss news management and that sometimes means decisions are taken
to promote one idea or another or respond to events as they happen.
``That is special responsibility and it sometimes means ranging into other
peoples' territory.
``Some of them feel on the detail of the Budget strategy they were not
consulted properly.
``To that extent, there will hopefully be much closer co-operation right across
the board when things are being planned.''
Some Shadow Cabinet members are thought to be unhappy at not being more closely
consulted about Mr Brown's announcement on a lower-band income tax target of
10p, which has been attacked by other parties and some independent experts as
not the most efficient way of helping the poor and denounced by the Government
as ``a gimmick.''
As well as giving Mr Brown his full backing, it is understood Mr Blair has
warned dissatisfied colleagues that dissatisfaction of this kind should be
settled within the Shadow Cabinet and not leaked outside where it could be
presented as a damaging row which neither the party in the country nor the
public would understand.
One Shadow Cabinet member said ``Gordon has been making assumptions about
certain things and people were getting sick of it, but I don't think there will
be a repeat in future.''

Phnom Penh, Thursday
BRITISH doctor Gavin Scott left a Phnom Penh prison today at the end of a
five-month jail term for sex attacks on five boys.
Scott stepped through the main gate with a lawyer and a British diplomat. When
asked about his health, he said: ``I'm still alive.''
On October 24, a court found Scott guilty of the attempted rape of five teenage
boys. He was fined and sentenced to two years in jail, with five months to be
served and the rest suspended.
Scott had been in custody for four months by the time of his trial, at which he
protested innocence.-Reuter.

A BRITISH soldier accused of killing a Danish tour guide in Cyprus accused one
of his two co-defendants of taking away the woman who was later found battered
to death, a Cypriot court was told today.
A police officer stationed at the British bases in Cyprus told the Assize Court
in Larnaca that rifleman Jeff Pernell, 23, had blamed co-defendant Alan Ford
for what happened to the woman they are charged with killing - 23-year-old
Louise Jensen.
Inspector Democritos Georgiou told the court that shortly after the three
soldiers were detained near the Dhekelia base, Pernell told him: ``Alan did it.
I stayed in the car and can't remember anything else, I was drunk.''
Georgiou quoted Parnell as saying: ``The girl was sitting behind with Alan. I
was sitting in front. Alan got out of the car and returned alone.''
Ford sat expressionless as Georgiou read the statement.
Pernell and co-defendants Justin Fowler and Ford, both 27, stationed at
Dhekelia, have denied charges of abduction, conspiracy to rape, and the
manslaughter of Miss Jensen, who worked in the holiday resort of Ayia Napa,
last year.
Fowler is from Falmouth, Ford from Birmingham, and Pernell from Oldbury, West
Midlands.
The three soldiers serving with the Royal Greenjackets are accused of bundling
the woman into their yellow mini moke after knocking her off her boyfriend's
motorcycle on the outskirts of the resort.
Pernell's defence lawyer, Antonis Andreou, urged the court to rule Georgiou's
testimony inadmissible. He said the accused was not in a position to give a
voluntary statement at the time because he was drunk.
The court is expected to issue a ruling on the point raised by the defence
tomorrow.-Reuter/AP.

THE biggest mass slaughter of deer in Scotland's mountains is under way with
around 30,000 hinds expected to be shot by February.
Some estates are using taxpayers money to pay for the cull. The action has
provoked an angry response from animal rights campaigners.
Mr John Robins, of Animal Concern Scotland, said: ``The only reason there is a
problem is because greedy estate owners encourage the deer to breed in the hope
that they will get more stags. Now they are reaping the reward of that greed.''
Professional deer hunters are being drafted in to keep the numbers down.
Mr Donald Fraser, a full-time stalker at the 16,000-acre Glencannich Estate,
Inverness-shire, said: ``The contract killers fire indescriminately and just
fulfil their quota of hinds regardless of age or health.''
Mr Iain Hope, liaison officer at the Inverness-based Red Deer Commission, said:
``It is true that taxpayers money is being used for the culls in some cases.
The hind culls are not profitable for the estates and there are places where we
want to see numbers cut right back.''
New legislation which is currently going through Parliament will give the Red
Deer Commission the right to impose deer culls on landowners where the
interests of nature are threatened, for example, by overgrazing.

GOVERNMENT plans to crack down on illegal immigrants were thrown into turmoil
yesterday with a warning from MPs of the potential for widespread abuse of
National Insurance numbers.
A report from the Commons Social Security Select Committee shows there are 20
million numbers floating round the system, mainly of people who are dead or are
abroad.
Committee member David Shaw (Con.) admitted the system was ``very insecure''
and ripe for racketeers.
The report comes just days after Home Secretary Michael Howard gave details of
his proposed crackdown.
He wants all companies to check NI numbers of all new staff to ensure they are
in the country legally.
Companies would face #5000 fines if they did not check on employees.
The report warns that the ``availability of false or multiple National
Insurance numbers provides a route to large-scale social security fraud''.
Members say they are ``not convinced'' that the Contributions Agency and other
Government agencies dealing with National Insurance numbers are giving
sufficient priority to security.
Agency heads told committee members that there were no ``loose numbers''. Old
ones were kept because there were sometimes queries on people's contributions.
Committee members are demanding a review of all the procedures concerning NI
numbers security.
Mr Shaw told a news conference the millions of numbers in the system was an
``extraordinary saga''. He believed not all the numbers could be accounted for.
He added: ``A lot more numbers need to be investigated. If illegal immigrants
got hold of some past numbers, there is a chance they can get round the
system.''

THE Princess of Wales was the queen of hearts for handicapped children,
battered wives and tearaway youngsters in downtown Buenos Aires yesterday.
She kissed a Down's syndrome boy, comforted victims in a women's refuge and
lent support to problem adolescents hooked on drugs, glue-sniffing or crime in
the Argentine capital.
It was vintage Diana: holding children's hands, stroking hair and always caring.
She swept into Argentina, brushing aside the controversy of her TV revelations.
Now it was Diana the roving ambassador and caring princess embarking on a
four-day working visit on behalf of Argentine charities.
As she did so, the Prime Minister hinted that Armed Forces Minister Nicholas
Soames, a friend of Prince Charles, had been rebuked for claiming she had
displayed ``the advance stages of paranoia'' in her television interview which
laid bare the problems which wrecked the royal marriage.
The princess is hoping to leave Monday night's Panorama interview, in which she
cast doubt on her estranged husband's suitability to be king, 7000 miles behind
in Britain. The media pack has other ideas.
Mr James Hewitt, with whom the princess admitted an adulterous affair, has not
been seen at his Devon home.

MYSTERY, what mystery? Canadian business tycoon Ron Dixon, whose absentee
chairmanship of Dundee FC has given rise to an industry of rumour, speculation,
and innuendo as the club profile has risen in the build-up to Sunday's
Coca-Cola Cup final against Aberdeen, broke silence from his Vancouver home
this week to ask what all the fuss is about.
``It's very curious,'' he said in a relaxed tone. ``Most of the stuff I read is
about these interfering, egotistical chairmen. Then you find a chairman like me
who stays the hell out of the way and lets them get on, and the next thing you
know is you get criticism for that. I guess the rule of the game is if you try
to do anything in the modern world, someone's going to take a pot-shot at you.''
In a three-hour interview 56-year-old Dixon displays insight, optimism, wit and
obvious affection for the club in which he has a #2m investment and whose
progress he monitors closely from a distance of 6000 miles.
He talks highly of the sheer character and motivational abilities of manager
Jim Duffy, with keen excitement of rising young stars Neil McCann and Jim
Hamilton, and with appreciation for the loyalty of an unpaid board, led in his
one-year absence from Dundee by vice-chairman Malcolm Reid and managing
director Nigel Squire.
``I see the results and I see some of the write-ups,'' he confirms. ``I've
known they made the Coca-Cola final since they beat Airdrie.'' The question
everyone wants to ask is will he fly over to join the club for its sell-out
date at Hampden? ``I've still got some time to try and work it out,'' he
responds. ``If I'm not there my heart will still be with them, as it always is.
If I go over it will have to be spontaneously because I have a very busy week
for me to be hot-footing it off for pleasure, because I really have no business
reason to come over.''
This same business instinct, developed over 35 years with interests that have
spread to a dozen different countries in five continents, cautions him it might
be best to stay away. ``It's taken me a long time to work out that if it ain't
broke, don't fix it,'' he says.
It is a formula he may be tempted to apply to Dundee FC this weekend.
Neither would this appear to represent the only strategy over the portrayal of
Dixon as a chairman whose telephone numbers have all been discontinued, who has
not been in touch since the spring and who has displayed apparent indifference
over his financial and personal involvement. He decides it is time to blow the
myth.
With wry amusement, he explains: ``When I said to Nigel, `Why did you encourage
this business of me not being around?' He says, `Well, Ron, I'm trying to get a
buzz going here. We've got a winning team, a great coach, a great young team,
but we're getting crowds of 2700 to 2800.' So, he says, `I went live with this
story. The next game we got 10,000 fans.' He says it's all part of marketing. I
said it seemed a strange marketing strategy to me, but strange or not, it
works.''
He claims the reality is different, even if it ruins something of a Dixon
mystique: ``I stay in touch in various ways. In the last two months I've
probably spoken to eight or nine people. I've spoken to Nigel Squire in the
last month since I got back from Asia.
I wasn't in touch for a long period of time because I bought a new business in
January with 4000 employees that was in trouble. That occupied me for six
months. Then, with my regular trips back to Asia, it's been a busy 1995.
``The club is now financially secure, so they don't need to phone me every two
weeks asking me for money. So, there was a combination of reasons. It was no
big deal from my point of view, but it was obviously a big deal to some people.
``Nigel Squire said I was this man who knows as much about soccer as he does
about ice hockey, and he's got that right. The other directors evidently gave
him hell for saying that. I disagree. I think that part of Nigel's charm is
that he shoots from the hip and is a bit of a wise-cracker. I don't hold a
grudge for that.''
As recently as last Friday Mr Squire was still perpetuating the line that he
had received no word from Mr Dixon. Yesterday he admitted a private contact
from his Canadian chairman two weeks ago, the first in a number of months. ``It
wasn't a scam,'' Mr Squire denied. ``The board has had no official contact, and
no-one on the board has said that they have heard from Mr Dixon. I was telling
the truth as I saw it.
``I was asking the fans to come out and support the team because Mr Dixon was
in Canada and we could not expect any more money or support from him. We were
on our own. It would have taken a far more intelligent man than me to think
that up as a marketing strategy.''
Asked if contingency arrangements were being made to reserve a seat in the
directors' box for Mr Dixon at the final, Mr Squire said: ``There won't be a
seat because by tomorrow we'll have sold our 17,000 ticket allocation. Maybe he
can see Jim Duffy about one of the players' wives' tickets. Or maybe he can sit
with Jim Duffy in the dug-out. I'm not keeping him a ticket if he can't pick up
the phone to tell us he's coming.''
As the mystery was promoted over ``Where is Ron Dixon?'', it fed inevitably
into the next question of ``Who is Ron Dixon?''
Exhaustive inquiries in Scotland and Canada produce an intriguing range of
answers, leads, evasions, red herrings, and caution.
``Who is Ron Dixon?'' asks Dr Patrick Pettman, a former business associate in
Vancouver, and a friend of twenty years. ``That's a good question. There are
two Ron Dixons. To be a successful businessman I think you have to have that
kind of schizoid personality. In private life he has a great sense of humour.
And the business side? I don't want to describe it. He's an achiever.''
Getting through to the man himself is like setting off down the Rosebud trail
and walking into an interview with affable Citizen Kane. He is discovered in
expansive mood after returning from a business trip to the United States and
being called to the phone from raking leaves in the high security grounds of
his large mansion in Delta, Vancouver.
``I'm not a big spotlight guy,'' says the man whose full range of business
activities are low profile even in Canada. Yet in the course of a conversation,
interrupted only by his taking a couple of personal calls, he volunteers enough
details of his private domestic world - the minor leagues ice hockey coaching
medal from the US Senate on his desk, the photograph on his wall of a kilted
Dixon posing with Jim Duffy and Neil McCann, the racquetball court where he
gets a daily work-out to keep his six foot three frame in condition - to almost
allow you to cheat by putting a Vancouver dateline at its head.
It emerges he has been returning my calls, and he does impersonations of
security declining to take a message.
Everyone who has ever encountered Dixon will testify to his engaging qualities.
His soft-voiced style is pleasant. Urbane, well-informed, sharp, he talks
easily and listens with an attention that is undeniably flattering.
Friends say he is a brilliant psychologist and that it is no coincidence that
in his earliest days he excelled as a salesman. The remarkable thing, given the
absentee image, is how open he is prepared to be.
``I didn't have a particularly happy childhood, but so didn't fifty million
others,'' is his candid response to probing. ``My mother and father were
divorced at an early age when I was nine. I left home at a fairly early age and
went out into the world and got pummelled pretty good.''
Dixon is his mother's name. ``I'm terrible with names,'' he confesses at a
couple of points, struggling to remember one. In fact, he is ingenious with his
own. In North America he has used Ronald Barry Dixon. In Europe he has signed
himself Ronald Noble Dixon. In his business dealings in Asia he is Ronald Noble
Barry Dixon. Given that a whispering campaign suggests that Dixon has used a
pseudonym, although nothing has ever been proved, this requires an explanation.
The one he provides is disarmingly simple. With unfazed amusement, he responds:
``It's one of the things I do to keep my life somewhat organised. I use one
middle initial in one part of the world, and the other middle initial in
another part of the world, so I know if anyone's contacting me or leaving me a
message, at least I know what part of the world it's coming from. When you do
business in twelve of thirteen countries you use any little trick you can to
keep track of things.''
For years opponents have tried to investigate a suggestion that his real name
could be Barry Nowakowski, and that this Nowakowski identity might reveal a
``past''. The creation of a mystery over his absence has led to a resurfacing
of these lurid stories, and Dixon is aware of them.
``The Nowakowski thing is pure bullshit,'' he replies evenly. ``I don't mind
people taking a shot at me that I'm too competitive, or I'm too ruthless, or
I'm any of the other negative things. But I would sue immediately if anyone
ever said I was Nowakowski. You promise to buy me six Glenfiddichs and a nice
steak, and I'll show you my birth certificate.'' It shows Ronald Barry Noble
Dixon.
His mother was born to Scots-immigrant parents in Canada, a heritage of which
he is intensely proud. His grandmother, Elizabeth Duncan, went to Canada as a
teenage serving girl and met Horace ``Happy'' Dixon, a miner in southern
Alberta who had gone over independently from the Gorbals.
His paternal grandfather was an Anglican minister, but the subject of his
father evidently exposes old scars. This and the tragic death of his son in a
motor accident in the late 1980s are the only two subjects he refuses to
discuss.
On leaving home in East-end Vancouver at the age of 16, Ron Dixon went to work
on construction of the Trans-Canada oil pipeline. He had a variety of early
jobs, posting For Sale signs for a real estate company and working as a
security guard, to pay his way through college.
He left midway through his degree to enter business with a friend. He was
offered a half share in the Vancouver firm City Janitorial if he could save it.
``Yes, I've swung a mop in my time, but basically I had to sell some
institutional accounts,'' he recalls. ``The Bank of British Columbia was my
first big one. We ended up with eight trucks on the road and a reasonably
successful business.'' He was 22 and on his way.
Through the sixties and seventies he went through the ``nursing home
business'', construction, hotels, and manufacturing. His base spread to Seattle
and Australia, after marrying his Tasmanian wife Joan. He started developing
interests in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Since 1978 his main field of
operations was in computers and hi-tech information supply.
He developed Telecheque, a credit card and cheque verification service.
Nevertheless, he managed to keep his growing private and business wealth on the
lowest key.
``When you're wealthy you're automatically perceived as a bastard, and taking
advantage of your money,'' he reflects. ``In actual fact money can be a huge
anvil. And that's why I've always kept a low profile. For many many years I was
one of the wealthiest men in Vancouver, and no-one knew me except the guys I
did business with. I kept it that way on purpose.
``I can remember my kids saying to me one time when they were twelve or so,
`Are you rich, daddy?', and I'd say `No. Not particularly.' For many years they
had know idea we were any different from anyone else.
``The only commonality I've seen among wealthy men, and I know a lot of them,
is that they all worked hard, sacrificed in some ways their relationship with
their families, they were all ego-driven, they are all perfectionists, and they
are all good with numbers.'' He believes these attributes apply to himself.
In 1990 a rare profile of Dixon appeared in the Vancouver business magazine
Equity. The story was subsequently discredited, and the publisher fielded five
separate law suits. The journalist, Don Ramsay, remarked to contacts that
putting together a piece on Dixon was like doing ``reconstructive surgery''.
He guessed the business fortune of ``our city's most mysterious
multi-millionaire'' at $150m, but the figure was almost certainly meaningless.
Yet even as recently as January this year the same article was circulating
among employees seeking information on Dixon when he was negotiating takeover
of the ailing National Real Estate Service (NRS). The ruthlessness of Dixon's
business character has been revealed in drastic pruning to revive his new
company. NRS employees and agents on commission have been leaving in large
numbers since the takeover. The former company president, Joe Pearson, with 25
years' service with the firm, claimed constructive dismissal when he was
informed he was on paid holiday.
When he tried to resume work, two days after the takeover, he was escorted
personally to the lift by Dixon. The law suit was settled out of court for an
undisclosed figure.
``I'm a fairly honest guy,'' says Dixon. ``I do have a steely side, there's no
doubt about that. I hate when people try to cheat me, or one-up me. I don't
spend a lot of time explaining. I just do my thing. Don't complain, and don't
explain. I don't do all the things that are supposed to get you a nice polished
image in the market place.''
Had it not been for his lifetime passion for sport, his name might never have
reached public awareness. In the early days he coached kids at baseball,
basketball, and ice hockey. He is proud of his certificates and of his level
five coaching jacket.
Inevitably, he moved into ownership, first with the New Brunswick Bruins and
then the Tri-City Americans, based south of the border in Washington State at
Kennewick. It was ice hockey that took him to Dundee. Fraser McCall, a former
player with the Perth Panthers in Scotland who emigrated and got rich enough to
be called the ``Bank of Victoria'' and finance Stagecoach in the early days,
was going to go into the then Dundee Tigers with Dixon as a joint venture.
Dixon eventually had to go alone and emerged from a complicated takeover and
shares battle for Dundee Angus Ice Rink with no team and no rink. A previously
negotiated deal for the site went through in a #1.9m deal with William Low, and
Dixon's plans for a new facility were dropped after failing to attract local
government support.
Buying Dundee FC has been portrayed as a rich man's indulgence, but he claims
that it was part of a personal commitment to his grandmother. ``She's the one
who got me into Dundee,'' he reveals. ``She lived to be a ripe old age and by
then I was a businessman of some repute and had some money. She asked me if I
ever got the chance to do something for the old country. That's what got me
started at Dundee.''
The football club and Dundee Leisure plc are not his only interests in
Scotland. In 1991 he sent an agent to buy a 2000-acre hill sheep farm,
Ballygroggan, south of Machrihanish and running down the coast to the Mull of
Kintyre, sight unseen.
It was made over in the name of his wife, Joan, with the clearing of the sheep
stock made a condition of purchase.
``He had no time for sheep,'' says his first manager, Duncan Brown. Locals had
little time for an incomer multi-millionaire. A row over land access for
hillwalkers was conducted in the columns of the Campbeltown Courier, with Dixon
writing to protest that his only object was to protect wildlife from campers.
This was fuelled by claims of tradesmen that bills were unpaid for renovation
work on properties at Ballygroggan. Dixon's infrequent visits to the farm
created delays before accounts were settled. Then there was a classic rural
altercation with Colonel Hector Macneal, his nearest neighbour, descended from
three centuries of Macneals as local lairds on Losset Estate.
Dixon damaged two of the colonel's pillars when attempting to transport a
caravan down a narrow track. The colonel remonstrated.
``He arrived at the front door of our house here,'' reports a still indignant
Colonel Macneal. ``He said, `I'm Ron Dixon.' He was clutching a bottle of
spumanti wine. I don't like spumanti wine. This was his peace offering. He came
into the house and we sat in the garden. He looked at the trees and said, after
five minutes, `Gee, Hector, I'll buy this place tomorrow if you're prepared to
sell it.'''
It would have taken more than repaired pillars to set right the damaged
reputation Dixon suffered. A recent planning application to establish a wind
farm with wind-harnessing pylons was rejected by Argyll and Bute District
Council after a petition of objection was received from locals.
``It has basically got to the point that if the guy wanted to put sheep back on
the ground and return it to a sheep farm the locals would still object,''
admits Dixon's new manager, Dr Simon Lawrence. ``A lot of this bad feeling
dates back to the initial days. If you're a North American and you contract
someone to do a building job, and it's not done to your satisfaction, the guys
don't get paid. They all got paid eventually.''
Three Scottish legal firms, Simpson Marwick and Fyfe Ireland in Edinburgh, and
A. B. &amp; A Matthews of Newton Stewart, have continuing actions against Dixon
over disputed arrears of fees dating back to 1992.
DIXON claims bills should have been presented to his companies, not as personal
accounts. ``I'm very demanding on lawyers,'' he confirms. ``I think they're
hired guns. It's not the kind of profession I admire.''
Not least among the paradoxes that surround Dixon is the fact that he
encouraged his daughter Lynn to attend law school at Edinburgh University
before she completed her degree in Chicago.
Another is a tendency to spontaneous gestures of generosity. He once organised
a truckload of goods for a Romanian orphanage after witnessing poverty and
distress on a business trip there.
Steve Martin, a former Dundee FC director, testifies to witnessing numerous
handouts - #100 notes given to people on the street, a #50 note to kids to buy
a better football, and his presentation of a signed football to a Dundee fan in
a wheelchair, after bidding #500 for it at a club centenary ball in the Angus
Hotel.
Dixon does not believe he is likely to gain a reputation as a ``soft touch''.
But he admits: ``Although I'm very serious about business, I've made some
investments with the heart rather than my head in the last five years. I don't
regret it.''
Dundee FC appears to come into the category of an ``investment of the heart''
in his own estimation. He denies that he will be anxious to sell when his
five-year commitment to the club expires in January. ``Not necessarily,'' he
counters. ``I've made certain commitments to certain people, not the least to
Jim Duffy. I will keep all my commitments before I go. I just said it would be
no earlier than five years.''
His parting shot over the phone concerns the final. ``I'll bet you a #1, and I
know you're going to give me 4-1, that we win that game,'' he offers, without
finding a taker. His thoughts turn to the former Dundee player whose goals got
Aberdeen into the final to meet his old club. ``I just hope Billy Dodds gets my
cheque, that's all. Just a joke. Just a joke.''

<HEADLINE>Sentence deferred on doctor who stole drugs</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>13</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975224847</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A DOCTOR who fed his addiction with drugs stolen from the practice where he was
a partner has had his sentence deferred for six months.
Sheriff James Smith, at Kirkcudbright Sheriff Court yesterday, was told the
General Medical Council had started proceedings to determine Colin Malone's
professional future.
Sheriff Smith said he would defer sentence until the medical council reached a
decision.
Malone's agent, Mr John Innes, said the doctor had not taken drugs since the
offence came to light. He was making a determined and disciplined response to
his problem and had sought medical help.
Mr Innes said the problem had been brought on by a viral illness and that
Malone had suffered an undiagnosed depression caused by an increasing workload.
Malone admitted stealing 380 drug injections over a four-month period while
working in a Dalbeattie practice.
Malone, 32, of Rounall Avenue, Dalbeattie, pleaded guilty to having pretended
to four pharmacists that he required quantities of the controlled drugs
diamorphine, cyclimorph, and pethidine for use in connection with the treatment
of patients in the course of his business.
He induced the pharmacists to supply him with the controlled drugs and
thereafter appropriated them for his own use.
Procurator-fiscal Frank Walkingshaw said the offence came to light when the
principal of the chemists in Dalbeattie informed police.
The drugs are used mainly in the treatment of pain and in cases of terminal
illness.
Mr Innes, for Malone, produced testimonials which he said were evidence of the
high regard in which colleagues and patients held Malone and said preliminaries
to the hearing by the General Medical Council were proceeding.
``The next month or so will decide his future in the profession,'' Mr Innes
said.

A VAN driver who killed a woman in a crash was jailed yesterday for three years
at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
David Scott, 25, had been found guilty of driving carelessly with
one-and-a-half times the alcohol limit in his blood and causing the death of
Mrs Jennifer McGeachie, 49.
The sentence was welcomed by Mrs McGeachie's husband, John, 54, who was in
court to hear the outcome of the case.
``He got what he deserved, he should not have been drinking and driving,'' said
Mr McGeachie, of Woodside Drive, Penicuik.
``But at the end of the day this doesn't change anything, it will not bring my
wife back.''
The jury heard that Scott had been drinking beer and playing pool in a
Gorebridge public house on January 8.
Scott, a plumber, of Powdermill Brae, Gorebridge, later drove his van and
crashed with Mrs McGeachie's Mini at Cockpen Crossroads, Bonnyrigg.
Mrs McGeachie, an auxiliary nurse, was pulled from the wreckage after the crash
but was found to be dead.
Defence solicitor George More said Scott was ``full of remorse and regret''.
``He has had great difficulty coming to terms with what he did, it is something
that is with him every day of his life.''
Scott was a young man of previous good character who had made a ``dreadful
error of judgment'' and was very well aware of the consequences of his mistake.
Scott told the jury how he came to a bend at about 40-45mph and braked gently.
The back of the van began to slide away from him and he braked harder but the
van went to the other side of the road and hit banking.
Scott could not remember anything until after the crash with Mrs McGeachie's
car.
Police officers said that if Scott's van had been going at a safe speed, he
would have been able to stop before the crossroads.

A DRUGS dealer wrote a letter from his prison cell asking a friend for help in
providing evidence for a police corruption probe, a court heard yesterday.
The High Court in Aberdeen was told that convicted drugs trafficker Ronald
Cormack wrote to an associate, Mr Gavin Clark, seeking help in corroborating
information for an investigation by officers from Strathclyde Police into
Grampian Police.
Details of the letter were revealed at the trial of Grampian Police constable
Neil Cooper, 36, who denies two charges of attempting to defeat the ends of
justice and one charge of corruption.
On the corruption charge, the Crown alleges that Mr Cooper accepted more than
#6000 from Cormack as a reward for providing information to him about Grampian
Police surveillance operations on him during 1994.
Mr Cooper has lodged a special defence against the corruption charge,
incriminating another Grampian police officer, Mr James Grimmer.
Charges of attempting to defeat the ends of justice relate to Mr Cooper's
investigations into an assault and a separate housebreaking, both of which are
said to have involved Cormack.
Mr Cooper's defence counsel, Mr Kevin Drummond QC, read Cormack's letter
yesterday during cross-examination of Chief Superintendent Ronald Coutts, head
of Grampian Police CID.
In the letter, Cormack says to Mr Clark: ``Expect to have a visit from the feds
investigating police corruption. Don't worry, you'll have no trouble coming to
you but you can help us by corroborating certain things for us.''
The trial, before Lord Macfadyen, continues.

SCOTLAND'S Roman Catholic leader Cardinal Thomas Winning last night called on
the Government to appoint a Minister responsible for co-ordinating the fight
against drugs.
He was speaking at a poignant service in Glasgow's St Alphonsus Church in the
East End attended by some of the families of the 93 people who have died as a
result of drugs in Strathclyde this year.
They were joined for the candlelit service by friends and relatives of other
victims of drug abuse.
The ecumenical service was organised by the Glasgow Association of Family
Support Groups which called for unity in the fight against drugs.
In his address, Cardinal Winning said that in the face of a worsening epidemic
of drug-associated deaths there was a need for a co-ordinated attack.
``The appointment of a Government Minister to create a national strategy
heavily concerned with enabling local people to spearhead the fight back should
be a matter for urgent consideration.''
There were, he said, an estimated 10,000 drug injectors in the West of Scotland
and one in 10 of all 10 to 13-year-olds experimented with drugs.
He said whatever the causes of drugs misuse it would be foolish to deny that
the problem was a symptom of spiritual poverty.
``Drug addicts are human beings. If compassion is to come alive among us it
will only do so when we see the drug addict as a person with a problem rather
than a problem in the shape of a person.
``Tonight, perhaps, and tomorrow, it will be somebody else's child, somebody
else's tears. Your pain, your witness here this evening in this Church is a
grim warning.''

<TEXT>
DUNCAN Ferguson walks free from prison today, with half his three-month
sentence still hanging over him.
Ferguson, 23, is being freed from Glasgow's Barlinnie jail having served half
the sentence he received for headbutting fellow player John McStay.
However, the remaining half of his sentence could be reactivated if he falls
foul of the law before the sentence expiry date - in his case, 45 days' time.
In any event, he may not be able to resume his playing career until mid-January.
He still has 11 matches to serve out of a 12-match ban imposed by the Scottish
FA, although his present club, Everton, is seeking a judicial review - arguing
he is being punished twice over.
Ferguson will be one of at least 100 prisoners freed from Barlinnie early today
- Friday is traditionally a busy day for releases.
He is unlikely, however, to speak to the media waiting outside the grim
Victorian-built jail designed to hold 900 but now holding 1200 prisoners.
A prison service spokesman said it was likely that he would leave by a car from
the ``sterile area'' inside the gates.
Everton yesterday declined to discuss arrangements for his release but it was
thought likely he would be picked up either by club officials or members of his
family.
Ferguson made football history by becoming the first professional to be jailed
for an on-the-field assault on a fellow player.
It was his fourth conviction and Ferguson spent his first of his 44 nights in
Barlinnie on October 11.
The prison service said he had got on with his sentence in ``quiet and
unremarkable'' fashion.

SCOTTISH Nationalists' leader Alex Salmond last night accused Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth of putting key sectors of agriculture in Scotland at
risk.
It follows the announcement in a Commons written reply that the Scottish Office
will conduct ``prior options reviews'' of the work of the Scottish Crop
Research Institute, Macaulay Land Research Institute, the Scottish Agricultural
Science Agency, the Fisheries Research Services and the Forestry Commission's
Research Establishments.
This would assesses whether units could be privatised further and whether there
is scope for further commercialisation.
Mr Salmond said last night: ``This is a clear threat to key industries in the
north of Scotland. ``These institutions provide crucial support to the vital
fishing and farming industries in Scotland.
``It is a further demonstration of the powder-puff policies of Michael Forsyth
by allowing key Scottish institutions to be threatened.''
He also criticised the January 8 deadline for interested parties to make
submissions about the work of the institutions, saying it was ``ridiculously
short''

JOHANNESBURG: A British-born man was murdered outside his home in South Africa
on Tuesday in a bungled car hijacking, it was revealed yesterday. Lee Jeremy
Bennett, who moved to South Africa in the 1970s, was shot dead in front of his
10-year-old daughter Samantha as he stopped his car outside the family's
Johannesburg home.
Justice Minister Dullah Omar pledged maximum sentences for the perpetrators.
Jackson wins
PARIS: Michael Jackson was voted best male singer and Iceland's Bjork best
female vocalist at the MTV Europe Music Awards. From Britain, Take That won the

best newcomer, and U2 the best group. Bon Jovi were best rock group and the
Cranberries won best song with ``Zombie''.
Milat for trial
SYDNEY: Ivan Milat, the 50-year-old Australian accused of murdering seven

Briton held
WASHINGTON: A Briton who allegedly assaulted two flight attendants and a pilot
on a trip from Heathrow to Dulles International Airport was arrested by federal
agents when he got off the plane and will appear in court today. Janzen Coles,
who was drinking, had to be restrained in his seat until the plane landed.
Killer forgiven
ANKARA: As a Turkish schoolboy began a six-year prison sentence yesterday for
gunning down a British doctor, the victim's wife described the 15-year-old
murderer as a ``lost little sheep'' who needed psychiatric care. Zeki Demir
killed gynaecologist Dr Martin Kettle in June last year at Ula, where he was on
holiday. Demir's has had mental problems since his brother shot his father dead
when he was a toddler, and Mrs Frankie Kettle said she had forgiven him.

A HOUSE blaze which claimed the lives of seven children was started
deliberately, a fire investigation officer told an inquest yesterday.
Clwyd Fire Service divisional officer Stuart Mason ruled out the possibility
that a carelessly discarded cigarette could have caused the fire at the house
in Nelson Street, Hightown, Wrexham, on August 10.
He said neither of the smoke detector alarms in the four-bedroomed council
house had batteries fitted at the time of the fire.
Matthew Foulkes, eight, Philip Foulkes, seven, and twins Stephen and Robert
Davies, three, died on the day along with family friend Louise Jones, 12, who
was staying with them for a few days. Sarah Foulkes, 11, and Heather Davies, 20
months, died later at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital.
Their mother Mandy Devery, 35, and her 63-year-old husband Dennis, the father
of the youngest three, managed to escape from the fire after being woken by
smoke.
A fire service video of the gutted house was shown at the inquest yesterday and
Mr Mason said a polyurethane-upholstered rocking chair in the dining room was
the point where the blaze started.
He said his investigation had ruled out gas or electrical causes, leaving a
discarded cigarette or a deliberate act - though not a malicious one - as the
only possible causes.
Mr Devery gave evidence on Wednesday that he had been smoking while watching a
late-night film sitting in the rocking chair the night before the breakfast
time blaze.
He had gone to bed leaving his tobacco tin and disposible lighter on a table by
the chair.
``In my opinion, it had nothing to do with smoking materials,'' said Mr Mason.
``The fire was of a rapidly developing nature and not consistent with a slow
burning, smouldering fire that would be necessary for a carelessly discarded
cigarette to be the source of ignition.
``The time factor, six-and-a-half hours, would be too long a period of
incubation for such an incident to develop unnoticed.''
Coroner John Hughes reminded Mr Mason that there was no direct evidence that
any of the children had gone downstairs that morning before the fire broke out
and that all of them were found in their bedrooms in nightclothes when
firefighters got them out.
Mr Mason said this did not alter his conclusion.
Mr Hughes asked: ``The cause of this fire was a direct flame igniting a
polyurethane foam upholstered rocking chair?''
Mr Mason replied: ``That is my opinion, yes.''
He added that no batteries were found in either of the two smoke detectors
fitted by the council as a matter of policy on the stairs and first-floor
landing of the house.
``A survey of other houses in the vicinity indicated that this was the norm
rather than the exception,'' said Mr Mason.
Families removed the batteries to minimise nuisance when they were cooking or
to use in toys.
The coroner said: ``Given the enormity of this tragedy, it seems to be a pretty
trivial nuisance to have this bleeping when cooking if it could save a life.''
Mr Mason replied: ``Yes sir, I agree.''
The inquest was told by council officials that both smoke detectors were
checked and were working when the house was inspected in October 1994, before
the family moved in.
The coroner read a statement from 14-year-old Wayne Foulkes - who survived the
fire in which his brothers and sisters died because he stayed overnight at a
friend's house, in which he said he removed batteries from the detector above
the stairs.
He said he had not handled the detector on the landing.
Pathologist Dr Anthony Burdge told the inquest that the five children who died
on the day of the fire had all suffered lethal levels of carbon monoxide and
cyanide poisoning after inhaling toxic smoke of the type given off by furniture
foam.
Mr Devery had bought the rocking chair as part of a second-hand three-piece
suite for #24 from a local auction house.
Modern furniture has its foam treated to make it slower to catch fire but the
inquest was told that when the foam does ignite it still gives off cyanide and
carbon monoxide.
Wrexham Maelor Council principal building surveyor David Berwyn Davies said the
authority was one of the first in the country to instal smoke detectors in all
its council houses.
The inquest concludes today.

FISHING boats should keep equipment on board capable of releasing net-towing
wires in an emergency, a Government agency recommended yesterday.
The Marine Accident Investigation Branch issued its report almost a year after
the skipper of Inverness fishing boat the Heather Bloom died when his vessel
sank in heavy seas off Shetland.
The boat, with a crew of six, had been fishing in waters 100 miles west of
Shetland when she ran into difficulties on the night of December 3, 1994.
The skipper, father-of-five John McLeman, 53, from Avoch in the Black Isle,
died after being swept from the listing boat into storm-lashed seas. His body
has not been recovered.
The boat was dragged under after her fishing gear became entangled in an
underwater obstruction. The rest of the crew were rescued by a nearby trawler,
the Ambassador, and a coastguard helicoper.
In its report, the agency said the immediate cause of the accident had been a
sudden intake of water. The report said the vessel's electrical system had
subsequently failed, preventing the crew from releasing the snared fishing gear.
The report also said a Mayday signal had not been sent until just before the
boat sank. Because of the angle of the boat, the signal was weak and not picked
up for about an hour when a search and rescue operation was launched.
It also called on the Marine Safety Agency to issue information to skippers on
when to send out Mayday signals. It warned fishermen to send distress signals
at the earliest opportunity and to be aware that signals were weakened in
certain weather conditions.

SIR Marcus Fox last night was re-elected chairman of the influential Tory
backbench 1922 Committee.
Sir Marcus, 68, successfully fended off a challenge from fellow right-winger
and former Minister Bob Dunn. Details of the voting were not released.
Later, Marcus said he was honoured by the vote of confidence in him.
It was the second year in succession that Sir Marcus had to see off a challenge
to his position as leader of the Tory back benchers.
Last year he defeated Sir Nicholas Bonsor - now a Foreign Office Minister - in
a contest widely seen to be testing the water for a possible leadership
challenge to John Major.
This year, however, with the mood in the party very different, the contest was
seen to be more about the contrasting personal styles of the two men. Some MPs
backing Mr Dunn wanted to see a younger chairman installed before the General
Election.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the backbench finance committee, failed in his bid
for one of the two posts of vice-chairman. Party grandees Sir Geoffrey
Johnson-Smith and Dame Jill Knight were re-elected.
All executive members of the 1922 committee were re-elected except Mr Donald
Thompson, MP for Calder Valley, who failed to submit nomination papers. His
place was taken by former Minister Sir Archibald Hamilton.

UNION leaders yesterday claimed the Government's private finance initiative,
used for capital NHS projects, could be expanded to nursing and other clinical
services.
The social services committee of the STUC predicted the move was on the cards
after a two-hour meeting with NHS managers, including chief executive Geoff
Scaife at the Scottish Office in Edinburgh.
Mr Campbell Christie, STUC general secretary, said: ``The prospect is that
large tranches of the health service in Scotland will be provided by the
private sector and run by the private sector.''
He said there had been an indication at the meeting that the restriction on
clinical services not being included in private finance initiative would not
apply in Scotland.
Mr Grahame Smith, assistant STUC secretary, added: ``This is the first time we
have had it confirmed to us that the privatisation of clinical services is
actually an option for trusts pursuing the finance initiative for building the
facilities.''
Mr Christie believes this is the biggest push yet on the road to privatisation
and warned that unions would campaign strongly against it.
Grampian Health Board invited private companies this month to tender for
contracts to build, equip, and run a hospital in Stonehaven.
The STUC believes the hospital will be used as a pilot for hospitals under
construction in Scotland, including the new Law Hospital in Lanarkshire and the
Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh.
Strong disapproval at the move was voiced by the British Medical Association,
which described such a move as ``a double-edged sword'' which went against the
ethos and principles of the National Health Service.
Opposition parties united in a chorus of dissent. A spokesman for the Labour
Party said: ``This simply confirms our worst fears.''
Dr Iain Glen, SNP health spokesman, said: ``Against the overwhelming wishes of
the Scottish people, the Tories are clearly set on fragmenting and privatising
Scotland's national health service.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats said the party was opposed to
the private finance initiative being used for capital projects.
A Scottish Office spokesman said the STUC obviously had ``ideological
difficulty'' with the private finance initiative but stressed that the
potential was enormous, with several hundred schemes under active
consideration, including NHS schemes worth around #700m.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday secured Cabinet approval for his
plans to change the way Scotland is governed.
However, his hope of upstaging the Scottish Constitutional Convention on St
Andrew's day has been partially thwarted by opposition MPs who have insisted
that they be first to hear of the changes.
Mr Forsyth will produce a ``devolution to people rather than institutions''
package when he anounces changes in an eagerly awaited speech in Glasgow on St
Andrew's Day.
However, the Cabinet agreed yesterday that he should outline to the House of
Commons the procedural changes in their business arrangements which his plan
requires but he is thought to be planning to keep other details of the package
for his Scottish audience.
SNP leader Alex Salmond attacked Labour for demanding that Mr Forsyth announces
the changes in Westminster before making his speech in Scotland. He said:
``Surely on St Andrew's Day, of all days, the responsibility of the political
parties is to present their views first to the people of Scotland.''
Some of the changes Mr Forsyth will be proposing will affect the way Scotland
handles Scottish business. The Scottish Grand Committee is likely to be allowed
to take some Scottish Bills through all their stages without the whole House of
Commons being involved.
However, the thrust of many of the proposals will be the empowerment of
individuals through greater ability to make decisions about the area where they
live, wider choices over education and health, and more opportunities to make
their views known.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, speaking in Inverness, said they
would be ``panic measures which amounted to an admission of failure''.
The Liberal Democrats Scot-tish spokeswoman Ray Michie said that while
Ministers talked about measures to improve the government of Scotland, the fact
was that Scotland was actually being sidelined by Westminster.
The Forsyth package may seek to address some of these problems by passing
comparatively uncontroversial Bills to be dealt with only by a Scottish
committee, although it seems certain they will have to preserve the right of
Westminster to deal with more controversial measures by the traditional
procedure, to ensure a Government majority.
Meanwhile, Labour and the Liberal Democrats claimed they were making political
history in Inverness yesterday when they signed the Constitutional Convention's
agreement to achieve equal numbers of men and women in the first Scottish
Parliament for three centuries, writes David Ross.
As such an occasion demanded, the ceremony was performed by a woman and a man
from either party. Rhona Brankin, who chairs the Scottish Labour Party said:
``This is a historic occasion and I think it now gives us an opportunity to
begin to create a parliament which is actually fit for the twenty-first
century, a parliament which seeks to represent all the people from Shetland
right down to the Borders.''

White House says Clinton `will
not pull rabbit out of the hat'
Slim hope
of ending
impasse
in Ireland
THE prospects for a UK-Irish summit ahead of US President Bill Clinton's visit
next week were looking slim last night after John Major and John Bruton failed
to clear remaining ``roadblocks''.
The British and Irish premiers are expected to speak again today. Their
officials worked overnight to try to find a way to end the log-jam.
There is still a possibility that they could meet in Dublin on Sunday before Mr
Clinton's arrival. However, last night there was no sign that Britain will
shift on the demand that the IRA must, at the very least, take some significant
step towards the decommissioning of its weapons.
London, Dublin, and Washington all agree that an independent commission should
be established to handle decommissioning, while Sinn Fein could be brought into
bilateral constitutional talks. Mr Bruton wants a target date limited to about
three months - but Mr Major is still resisting this approach.
Downing Street remains confident of an agreement based on the twin-track
approach, which involves establishment of an international commission to
oversee the decommissioning of paramilitary arms while providing an opening for
the two Governments and the Northern Ireland parties to consider round-table
talks.
Mr Bruton telephoned Downing Street on Wednesday night to spell out his
critical views of a speech delivered earlier in the day by Northern Ireland
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew.
Sir Patrick repeated in stark terms Britain's demand for moves by the IRA
towards the decommissioning their stocks of arms before the entry of their Sinn
Fein partners into all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
In America, US officials were seeking to damp down expectations that Mr
Clinton's visit - which is being put back by 24 hours so he can address the
nation on Bosnia - will produce a dramatic breakthrough.
A senior White House official commenting on speculation that Mr Clinton ``is
going to pull a rabbit out of a hat in Northern Ireland'', cautioned: ``It's
not going to happen.''
He said the trip was more of a celebration of 15 months of ceasefire.
Mr Major was today said ``to fully understand'' Mr Clinton's decision to delay
the start of his visit. White House officals contacted Downing Street on
Wednesday night to inform them Mr Clinton would be putting back his arrival by
24 hours.
Meanwhile, one of the most bitter campaigns for votes in Irish history was
continuing to the last minute ahead of the referendum on divorce.
Accusations of lying and other strongly-worded comments were hurled around by
bishops and Government Ministers in the final days of the battle for support in
a plebiscite that has exposed deep rifts in Irish society.
At stake was one of Europe's final legal barriers to divorce.
A Government-backed bid to end the constitutional divorce prohibition failed in
1986, when the move was rejected by 2-1 majority. Polls this time suggest a
repeat result could be on the cards. Resistance to reform has been led by the
Roman Catholic church hierarchy.However, Ministers remained confident that the
swing against them had been checked.

PROPER procedures were abandoned in the hiring of a councillor's daughter, the
inquiry into employment practices within Monklands District Council was told
yesterday.
Mr Ian Crawford, head of human resources, had been recalled to explain how Miss
Catriona Smith, a daughter of human resources convener Jim Smith, came to be
employed as a clerical assistant.
He told Mr William Nimmo-Smith QC, who is holding the inquiry in Coatbridge,
that he himself had conducted the interview late last year.
He admitted that the interview should have been carried out by the
administration and legal services department where the vacancy existed.
However, Mr Crawford insisted that Miss Smith's relationship to Councillor
Smith had ``no bearing'' on the outcome of the interview.
The inquiry heard earlier this week that Miss Smith and a friend of hers, Ms
Jackie Davies, who had worked together in a florist's shop, both secured jobs
as clerical assistants at Monklands.
Referring to Miss Smith, Mr Crawford said: ``Rightly or wrongly, I took the
interview myself. Whether I would still do that......''(he tailed off speaking
at this point).
Mr Nimmo-Smith said: ``With all the allegations about nepotism, surely proper
procedures should have been followed?''
Mr Crawford: ``I was trying to be very conscious of that. I took the decision
to interview her myself. I did not want to put pressure on other staff.''
q.Dover MP David Shaw, a persistent critic of Monklands, surprised Parliament
yesterday by stating that council leader Jim Brooks had threatened him outside
the inquiry room on Wednesday by saying he would visit him and his family.
Councillor Brooks said: ``I was astounded when I heard what Mr Shaw had said.
Many people witnessed the incident. No-one had the same view of it as he did.''

Srinagar, Thursday
GUERRILLAS holding four Western hostage in Kashmir said today that the Indian
Government would soon regret its actions if it did not release jailed Kashmiri
separatists.
``If the government does not meet our demands as early as possible, they will
be sorry,'' the kidnappers, who have already killed one hostage, told
government negotiators.
The threats by the Al-Faran guerrillas were relayed by official sources who
said that negotiators had a 10-minute exchange with the guerrillas by telephone
or radio today.
The kidnappers asked for a radio and said they would contact the authorities
again on Saturday.
After Al-Faran captured the tourists in July, it demanded the release of 22
jailed separatists, including three members of Harkat-ul-Ansar, a
Pakistan-based Muslim militant group, in exchange for the hostages.
It later softened its demand, asking for the release of 15 separatists
including Harkat-ul-Ansar members.
Indian authorities have been in regular touch with the guerrillas since
November 9, when contact was re-established after a gap of more than 50 days.
Al Faran sent a hand-written statement today to some newspapers in Kashmir's
main city Srinagar to deny it was bargaining for the release of Maulana Masood
Azhar, a leader of the Pakistan-based militant group Harkat-ul-Ansar.
It described the story, given to the media this week by a senior official, as
``mere propaganda of the Indian Government'' and insisted: ``We still stand by
our earlier demands.''
Indian officials had hoped that an offer to bring Azhar to trial might buy
freedom for American hostage Don Hutchings, who is said to be critically ill
with frostbite.
The other hostages are Briton Paul Wells, said by Indian officials to have
recovered from viral fever, fellow Briton Keith Mangan, and German Dirk Hasert.
They were kidnapped while trekking. Norwegian captive Hans Christian Ostroe was
found beheaded on August 13.-Reuter.

A 22-stone, 6ft 4in psychopath, who had killed twice and had an extensive
criminal record for acts of violence, was jailed for life at the Old Bailey
yesterday.
There were cheers in court as black-bearded Ian Baker, 36, was led handcuffed
to the cells.
Outside court, the grieving relatives of Baker's latest victim called for a
review of all cases in which excessively violent criminals had been released.
Relatives of 27-year-old graphic designer Michael Davis said they were
``shocked and stunned'' that a persistently vicious attacker had been ``free to
roam and take another innocent life''.
After the jury convicted Baker of murdering Mr Davis, they were told he had
been on parole on a manslaughter sentence at the time.
He had also been granted bail by magistrates, despite police objections, on
charges of dealing in crack and possessing three knives.
Baker, who always carried a lock-knife, was also convicted of wounding three
other people, including the dead man's girlfriend Ms Sue Parrish, 27, in a
frenzied and unprovoked attack in March this year.
Mr John Bevan, prosecuting, said Baker turned ``a jolly and friendly''
fancy-dress party at a pub in New Cross, south-east London, into a bloodbath.
Without any provocation, and posing as a bouncer although he did not work at
the pub, Baker stabbed Mr Davis through the heart and in the back after
ordering him to put out a cannabis joint.
Mr Bevan said Baker had deliberately gone out ``spoiling for trouble'' and was
looking for an opportunity to use the knife.
Miss Parrish stepped between the two men to try to save her boyfriend, who was
a foot shorter than his attacker, and was slashed on the arms. Two other men
who tried to intervene were also knifed, one almost fatally.
The court heard that Baker, of Alexandra Street, New Cross, was jailed for
three years in 1978 for plotting to steal, five robberies, three attempts and
carrying a knife.
He reappeared at the Old Bailey in 1982 and was jailed for seven years for
robbery and wounding. These included four knife-point muggings and stabbing a
prison officer in the heart while escaping from a prison van. In the ensuing
chase he stabbed a motorist and kept a police negotiator hostage during a
five-hour siege.
In 1988 he was jailed for nine years for the manslaughter of a youth outside a
pub. He was working as a bouncer and stabbed his victim through the heart
during a brawl. He was released on parole in May 1993.
Last November he was returned to jail for supplying drugs and possessing
knives.
Sentencing Baker, who was flanked by six prison officers, Judge Geoffrey
Grigson said: ``It is plain you are a grave and continuing threat to the
public. You carried a knife and didn't hesitate to use it. It is only a matter
of chance that you did not kill others.''
Afterwards Detective Inspector Andre Baker said: ``This is one of the most
dangerous men I have ever dealt with. He should not have been at liberty to
take another life.''
And the dead man's brother Mr Trevor Davis said: ``The family would like to
thank the police for putting this beast behind bars. He should not have been
mixing with ordinary people, his record shows he is an animal.''

THE killer of a convicted child molester had his eight-year jail sentence
reduced to seven years by three appeal court judges yesterday.
Paul Strathearn, 34, stabbed Lawrence Leydon, 36, eight times, including once
through the heart, in a frenzied attack at the victim's home at Southhouse
Medway, Edinburgh, on February 11 this year.
He was charged with murder but, after trial at the High Court in Edinburgh, a
jury convicted him of culpable homicide on the basis that he had been suffering
from diminished responsibility at the time of the killing.
They heard psychiatric evidence that Strathearn's state of mind had been
bordering on insanity.
At the time of the stabbing, Leydon was serving a sentence of two years'
probation for indecency offences against a 10-year-child.
The trial judge, Lord Prosser, said he took into account that an attack of
murderous quality had been reduced to culpable homicide because of Strathearn's
dimished responsibility but it remained a very serious offence.
Before yesterday's hearing at the Court of Criminal Appeal, Strathearn's
supporters staged a demonstration.
Mr Jamie Gilchrist, for Strathearn, accepted that a significant custodial
sentence was inevitable but argued that, given the background to the case,
eight years was excessive.
Lord Ross, Lord Justice-Clerk, who heard the appeal with Lords Morison and
Gill, said it appeared that Strathearn had become obsessed with what he
perceived as the injustice of Leydon going unpunished for the sex offence.
``In the present case, we are satisfied that the diminished responsibility
should have been taken into account as having some mitigating value,'' Lord
Ross said.
``What the trial judge said in this regard to the effect that it did not have
any great mitigating value, was, we think, wrong.''
The trial judge also appeared to have attached some weight to the fact that
there was evidence that Strathearn had made earlier threats to Leydon.
However, that part of the indictment had been deleted by the Crown and, in
these circumstances, the appeal court felt that Lord Prosser's approach to
sentencing had, to some extent, been flawed.
Lord Ross added: ``Taking all the relevant considerations into account, we have
come to the conclusion that the appropriate sentence in this case was one of
seven years.''
Strathearn gave a thumbs up to supporters in the public benches as he was led
from the dock to resume his sentence.
Outside the court, his wife Katrina said: ``The more that would have come off
(his sentence), the better but he is just highly delighted that they took
something off.''

<HEADLINE>Clients left legal firm `in droves' Partner tells industrial tribunal he wanted to get rid of agency lawyers to improve service</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975224867</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PARTNER in a leading Scots law firm yesterday admitted to an industrial
tribunal that clients had left the firm in droves because of poor legal
representation.
He revealed that lawyers frequently were only handed the case papers for trials
minutes before the trial was due to begin.
He also said that Ross Harper Murphy &amp; Co solicitors, trading as Ross Harper,
had been regarded as ``a very soft target'' by other solicitors who took
clients away.
The tribunal was hearing evidence into the case of lawyer Eileen Paterson who
is claiming unfair dismissal and sexual discrimination after being fired for
refusing to work at night because of her family commitments.
Mr John Carruthers, 34, the managing partner at Ross Harper Murphy's Ingram
Street office in Glasgow, gave evidence that when he was put in charge of the
criminal department in April 1994 he had no experience of criminal legal work
and had never conducted a criminal trial.
Questioned by Mr Jack Quar, representing Mrs Paterson, Mr Carruthers said he
wanted experienced lawyers on the night time call-out rota who would see
clients in the police station and then the same lawyer would represent them in
court next day when they appeared in the custody court.
However, he refused to confirm that, recently, a man who was in police custody
charged with murder and allegedly a client of his firm had been seen by an
unqualified paralegal assistant and not a solicitor.
He did admit that paralegals, as well as solicitors, were still used on the
night-time rota to see clients in police stations.
Mr Carruthers decided last December to put Mrs Paterson on the night-time rota,
after she had been off it for eight years because of her children and her
husband's work commitments.
Mr Carruthers said that when he took control of the criminal side they were
losing a lot of clients to other lawyers.
He added: ``People weren't coming to us things were so bad.''
He also claimed he didn't want to get into a ``mandate war'' with other
solicitors and if a client from another firm wanted to transfer to Ross Harper
Murphy he would send them back to discuss it with the other firm.
He added: ``We were looked upon as a very soft target. We had a very soft
underbelly.
``No-one had seen fit to do anything about it until I arrived. The place was
just under managed.''
Mr Carruthers placed a lot of the blame for losing clients on agency lawyers
used by Ross Harper Murphy and said: ``Some really didn't care.
``There was no real follow-up. No real input.
``We had, in some cases, some agency lawyers working for us who would not have
got full-time employment elsewhere.
``For some reason, they seemed to be attracted to our firm.'' As part of a
policy to improve service to clients, he said: ``We wanted to get rid of the
agency lawyers and get people on staff who wanted to do a good job, who wanted
to go that extra half mile.''
Mrs Paterson, 36, in giving evidence, said she had made it clear that because
of the ages of her two sons, nine and four, and the workload of her husband's
growing civil court advocacy business in Edinburgh, she couldn't work at night.
Earlier, Mr Cameron Fyfe, the firm's managing partner, told the tribunal that
he hadn't investigated Mrs Paterson's personal circumstances before firing her
earlier this year.
When asked by Mr Quar yesterday why her mother couldn't look after the
children, as suggested by Mr Fyfe, Mrs Paterson became upset and explained:
``My mother was very ill, suffering from cancer, during this period.''
Asked whether any compromise had been put to her before she was sacked, Mrs
Paterson confirmed that Mr Fyfe had suggested she should transfer to civil
legal work.
However, she said: ``I haven't done any civil work since 1979 when I was an
apprentice.
``I had 14 years' experience in criminal work and had no interest in doing
civil work.''
She also rejected evidence given by Mr Carruthers who claimed her husband
``wasn't away from home as often as was made out'' and also denied he had been
in her home more than twice as he claimed in evidence. When questioned by
tribunal chairman Alistair McArthur, Mr Carruthers confirmed that Mr Liam
O'Donnell, who joined the firm as a criminal lawyer last November/ December,
had complained about Mrs Paterson not being on the rota.
He said: ``It's an example of a fresh eye coming into the firm. Liam came from
one of our competitors.
``He asked about Eileen not being on the rota and said, `My wife is pregnant.
We have a baby on the way and I will be in exactly the same position as
Eileen'.''
He then told the tribunal that Mrs O'Donnell was a primary schoolteacher and
finished work at 3.30pm.
The tribunal continues.

A SHERIFF has reported a prominent firm of Scottish solicitors to the Law
Society of Scotland, for ignoring solicitor's practice rules and acting for
both sides in an ``unsavoury'' house purchase deal that went sour.
Sheriff Richard Davidson has accused the blue-chip firm of Blackadder Reid
Johnston, of Dundee, of ``a profound and cynical disregard for their
professional obligations'', in a written judgment that he has sent to the Law
Society.
In the judgment, the sheriff criticises solicitor Donald Hutcheson, a senior
partner at Blackadder Reid Johnston, for not being ``a credible and reliable''
witness.
Mr Hutcheson, a solicitor of 23 years' standing, acted for property developer
John Duncan in the sale of a flat to Miss Lesley McCann, a legal secretary at
Blackadder Reid and Johnston.
The firm also acted for the Alliance and Leicester building society in
arranging a mortgage for Miss McCann, now of Shielhill Gardens, Aberdeen.
The firm acted for Mr Duncan in the purchase of the flat in Morgan Street,
Dundee, for #9500 in April, 1989. Then, the following month, they acted for
both Mr Duncan and Miss McCann in the resale of the flat, for #12,000.
As part of the deal, Mr Duncan was to receive up to #9450 in improvement grants
to make the flat habitable but the council insisted on extra work and Mr Duncan
decided to sue Miss McCann for the additional costs.
Sheriff Davidson found that it put the defender (Miss McCann) in possession of
an unmodernised, uninhabitable flat, with just a personal obligation by the
pursuer to modernise the property''.
He found that the full circumstances and consequences of this were not
explained to Miss McCann, and noted that Blackadder Reid Johnston continued to
represent both parties in the house purchase from June 1989 to June 1990, in
contravention of the Practice Rules.
He also found Blackadder Reid Johnston in further breach of rules by acting for
the Alliance and Leicester in the transaction, when it had purchased the
property for Mr Duncan the previous month, for #9500.
The deal went sour when Dundee District Council insisted on extra works to the
property at Morgan Street, and Mr Duncan decided to sue Miss McCann for #5800
toward the cost of the additional works, after she sold the flat for #22,500.
Sheriff Davidson found the grant application ``tainted with fraud'', and
refused to find in Mr Duncan's favour.
He concluded that for the firm to maintain there was no conflict of interest
appeared to demonstrate ``a profound and cynical disregard for their
professional obligations''.

FORMER futures trader Nick Leeson is due before a Singapore court today to face
fraud and forgery charges over the #860m collapse of Barings Bank.
Mr Leeson, 28, ar-rived in Singapore yesterday after being flown from
Frankfurt, where he had been in custody since early March.
Mr Leeson was taken from Changi airport to the headquarters of the Commercial
Affairs Department, Singapore's financial police, for questioning.
His lawyer, Mr John Koh, said Mr Leeson would not enter any pleas at today's
hearing.
Mr Leeson is accused of forging documents and opening a fictitious account to
conceal his unauthorised trading while working as the Singapore general manager
of the bank's futures trading arm.
Singapore legal experts said that, after the hearing, Mr Leeson will probably
be remanded in custody for a week and sent to the Queenstown jail pending trial.
It is considered highly unlikely he will get bail.
Next week, the judge may set a date for a pre-trial hearing, which would allow
the judge and lawyers to narrow down the issues which will be at the heart of
the trial. A trial date will be set after that hearing. He faces a maximum
prison sentence of 14 years.
Mr Koh said Mr Leeson was calm but concerned: ``He's not scared but there are
certainly a lot of things going through his mind.'' Earlier, Mr Leeson was
escorted by officers from the fraud squad during the 12-hour flight from
Frankfurt. Also on the plane were his wife Lisa, 26, his British lawyer, Mr
Stephen Pollard, and Mr Koh.
A dozen reporters were on the same flight but security guards kept them from
ap-proaching the group.
Mr Leeson and his wife sat together through most of the flight but were
separated after breakfast was served, about two hours before the plane landed
in Singapore.
A flight attendant said there was a tearful parting as a Singapore policeman
took Mrs Leeson's place.
Mr Leeson was ar-rested immediately on his arrival by a Commercial Affairs
Department official, who told him: ``It is my duty to inform you that you are
taken under arrest for the 11 charges you have been extradited on.''
Mr Leeson made no reply.
Mr Leeson, who handled contracts worth millions of pounds as a derivatives
trader on the Singapore International Monetary Ex-change, originally fought
extradition to the city-state.
The Leesons left Singapore in February as news spread that the bank was in
trouble. He was arrested in Frankfurt on March 2 and initially resisted extra-
dition, saying he wanted to be tried in London.
Last month, he agreed to return.

THE warder who found a teenage prisoner hanging from the bars of her cell
window stopped supporting her legs in order to answer a panicked call from the
jail control room, a fatal accident inquiry heard yesterday.
The second day of the joint inquiry into the deaths of Kelly Holland and Arlene
Elliot at Cornton Vale Prison, Stirling, in June, heard evidence of delays in
cutting down the girls from their makeshift nooses. The two girls committed
suicide at the prison in separate incidents within four days.
Prison officer John McFadyen, 32, said he had been on active duty in the
Scottish Prison Service for only two months when he found himself working alone
in the remand block on the night Miss Holland died.
He said he had checked her cell at 15-minute intervals after coming on duty at
9.30pm on June 22.
He saw her writing a letter and noticed that her eyes were red but he thought
she was simply writing an admission letter which many prisoners did on their
first night. ``She looked as if she had been crying but I asked her how she was
and she said she was OK.''
At 12.30pm he saw her lying on her bed and thought she was asleep. At 12.45pm
he found her hanging. ``I saw her silhouette at the window.
``I shone my torch in and that's when I noticed the ligature from the top bar.''
Mr McFadyen said he ``immediately realised the enormity of the situation'' and
radioed for assistance.
He said: ``I opened the door and rushed to the window. I grabbed her body and
supported the weight of it.'' He then radioed again to ask the whereabouts of
the night patrol. They said they were on their way.
Miss Holland seemed lifeless, he said. ``I was looking for a wheeze, a gasp,
anything. There was nothing.''
Then he was distracted by a call from the jail control room on an intercom
outside the cell.
He said a ``panicky voice'' asked: ``What's happening, what's happening?'' The
night patrol still had not arrived.
He said: ``At this point, I realised I had to get Kelly down. This became my
priority.''
He let Miss Holland go, ran to the intercom, and stressed he needed immediate
assistance.
Then he ran to his office and grabbed a ``crash pack'' which he knew from his
college training would contain a knife to cut down a suicide.
When he got back to Miss Holland's cell the night patrol was just in front of
him. She was cut down and heart massage and resuscitation were attempted to
revive her.
Asked how long the delay was in getting the crash pack, Mr McFadyen said he
thought about 10 seconds.
Later, senior prison officer Pamela Ligget, 29, night shift supervisor in
charge of the jail after dark, denied there had been delays in reaching Miss
Holland. She said the night patrol had been on the scene no more than 30
seconds after receiving Mr McFadyen's radio call for help.
The inquiry, before Sheriff Principal John Maguire at Stirling Sheriff Court,
continues.

HERITAGE projects in Scotland have been boosted by more than #770,000 in the
latest National Lottery grants announced yesterday.
The 10 awards from the Heritage Lottery Fund include #300,000 towards the
National Gallery of Scotland's purchase of a painting which once belonged to
King Charles I, and nearly #165,000 to help the Burrell Collection in Glasgow
to buy a sixteenth-century masterpiece.
The National Gallery's new acquisition is a small panel painting by early
seventeenth-century Italian artist Giulio Procaccini, entitled The Madonna and
Child with the Infant St John the Baptist and Attendant Angels.
It is first recorded in the collection of King Charles I. The collection was
dispersed following his execution in 1649.
The painting belonged latterly to the British Rail Pension Fund and has been on
loan to the Edinburgh-based gallery since 1979. The acquisition's cost of
#600,000 has been met with the help of a #100,000 grant from the National Art
Collections Fund (NACF) charity as well as the lottery cash.
Mr Michael Clarke, keeper of the National Gallery, said: ``It is widely
recognised as one of the artist's most beautiful small-scale paintings and must
surely have been the first work by him to reach Britain, where it has remained
ever since.''
At the Burrell Collection, officials yesterday unpacked their latest
acquisition, a painting by German master Lucas Cranach the Elder. The work -
Judith with the Head of Holofernes - is dated 1530 and depicts the biblical
heroine, dressed in the manner of Cranach's day, after she has beheaded her
enemy with a sword.
The work is believed previously to have been in the collections of both the
Duke of Hamilton and the Second Baron Aberconway of the Maclaren family, whose
descendants put it up for auction last year.
It was saved from export to the US in March this year and has been bought for
the Burrell at a cost of nearly #315,000, with the aid of #50,000 from the NACF
as well as the lottery grant. The Burrell Collection Trustees provided #100,000.
Mr Stefan van Raay, senior curator of art for Glasgow Museums, said: ``This is
a very good painting by a very good artist who is already represented in the
collection. Looked at with the other paintings, this will give an overall view
of what he did.''
In a further lottery grant, the Burrell gets #20,000 towards the #60,500 cost
of buying a goblet, dating from 1688, engraved by Willem van Heemskerk, which
it plans to add to its collection of Dutch glass.
The seven other Scottish projects receiving grants are:
q.#80,000 towards purchase of Bressay Lighthouse Buildings, Shetland, for
conversion into maritime heritage centre. (Applicant - Shetland Amenity Trust.
Overall cost of project - #100,000)
q.#59,150 towards repairs to Garnethill Synagogue, Glasgow, which houses
Scottish Jewish Archives Centre. (Garnethill Hebrew Congregation, #485,000)
q.#35,000 towards restoration of the Athelstaneford Doo'cot, East Lothian, and
its conversion into flag heritage centre. (Scottish Flag Fund, #83,650)
q.#33,962 towards restoration of Westerkirk Parish Library, Langholm,
Dumfriesshire. (Westerkirk Parish Library Trust, #120,000)
q.#30,000 towards purchase of sixteenth-century merchant's house in High
Street, Kirkcaldy, Fife. (Scottish Historic Buildings Trust, #31,000)
q.#27,710 towards restoration of library building at Wanlockhead Lead Mining
Museum, near Biggar, Lanarkshire. (Wanlockhead Museum Trust, #226,500)
q.#19,720 towards Portmoak Moss, Scotlandwell, Kinross, woodland area being
managed as a nature reserve. (Woodland Trust, #97,800).
Welcoming the grants, Scottish Arts Minister Lord Lindsay said: ``Once again,
we have seen worthwhile projects the length and breadth of Scotland benefit
from the lottery.''
The Scottish awards were among a total of 56 Heritage Lottery Fund grants,
amounting to #13.7m, announced yesterday.
The director of the National Lottery Charities Board in Scotland yesterday
stressed that playing the lottery was not a substitute for giving money to
charity.
Mr John Rafferty, speaking at the annual meeting of the Glasgow Council for the
Voluntary Sector, said that if people wanted to give money to charity, they
should do just that.

COUNTER-espionage expert and career civil servant Stephen Lander yesterday was
given the job of heading MI5.
He will take over from Stella Rimington as director-general of the security
service next Easter.
Mr Lander, 48, will have the key role of leading MI5 as it enters a new era in
heading the fight against drug-smuggling and organised crime.
The Government is to bring in legislation to expand the role of the security
service from its traditional counter-intelligence work to tackling serious
crime.
Downing Street also announced the appointment of another experienced civil
servant, David Omand, 48 - who was educated at Glasgow Academy - to the
delicate job of heading the Government Communication Headquarters in
Cheltenham. He will replace current director Sir John Adye in July next year.
Mr Lander joined MI5 in 1975 and has held a variety of jobs throughout the
service, specialising in anti-terrorist work.
He has been responsible for monitoring Soviet spying activity in Britain and
domestic subversion.
Mr Lander said last night: ``I am very pleased to have been invited to take the
service forward at this time, building on the achievements under my
predecessors.
``There remains much difficult work for us to do against traditional threats to
this country such as those from terrorism and espionage, but the service is
also looking forward to new arrangements building on long-standing
collaboration with the law enforcement agencies which will involve us in
helping them counter organised crime.''
Mr Omand, 48, moves to GCHQ, where he started his career, from the top post of
Deputy Under Secretary of State for policy at the Ministry of Defence.

<HEADLINE>Killing goes on as Pope attacks Mafia</HEADLINE>

Palermo, Thursday
THE Pope launched a broadside against the Mafia today, using a visit to the Mob
stronghold of Sicily to demand an end to killing.
However even as he spoke, another organised crime murder was taking place
across the island in the eastern city of Catania.
Matteo Romeo, 21, son-in-law of a local Mob boss, was shot dead in Catania fish
market.
The Pope's 10-hour visit to Sicily had begun on a controversial note when
Palermo's anti-Mafia mayor, Leoluca Orlando, stalked out of a welcoming
ceremony in protest at the presence of a bishop suspected of having Mob ties.
Orlando's gesture focused on the sometimes blurred relations between organised
crime and the Roman Catholic Church in Sicily.
The Pope forcefully returned to the theme of a 1993 trip to Sicily which he
turned into an anti-Mafia crusade.
``Do not kill,'' he told a church convention. ``No man, no human association,
no Mafia can change or trample on the right to life, this most holy right that
belongs to God.''
The Pope praised Sicilians for continuing attempts to uproot crime. He said he
felt compelled to repeat his words of two years ago because they were ``a cry
from my heart''.
The Mafia responded to the 1993 crusade by placing car bombs at two churches in
Rome, including St John's Lateran, the Pope's cathedral in his capacity as
bishop of Rome.
Since his election in 1978, the Pope has thrown his weight behind bishops and
priests who have spoken out against the Mafia. Previously, the local hierarchy
had been accused of turning a blind eye to the Mafia.
Some Sicilian priests have openly defied the Mafia and paid with their lives
for their preaching. The last to die was Father Giuseppe Puglisi, who was
killed in Palermo in 1993.
Later the Pope celebrated a stadium mass for 35,000 people, including relatives
of judges killed by the Mafia, with a tribute to Father Puglisi.-Reuter.

THE current dispute is only the latest of 100 wildcat actions which have hit
the Post Office in past two years.
In 1993 there were 32 illegal stoppages in the UK and last year this figure
doubled to 65, including protracted disputes in Liverpool and Newcastle which
achieved national prominence.
Both sides were set on a collision course as a result of heavy investment in
computer technology during the abortive run-up to privatisation and new
legislation curbing powers of unions, according to Peter Bain, lecturer in
human resource management at Strathclyde University.
``I think it is all about cutting costs,'' he said. ``It is clear that large
numbers of line managers and local managers are being told from national level
this is the way you will manage. That is coming across as a heavy-handed and
macho style.
``If this is not the case, it must be a fantastic coincidence that up and down
the country in dozens of locations similar events have taken place.''
The 1990 legislation requiring unions to repudiate unofficial action was
introduced in the wake of a spate of unofficial strikes the previous summer.
In the Post Office at least, it has achieved the opposite effect, particularly
in the light of 1993 legislation which made the ballot process much more
cumbersome and difficult.
``That's really what's causing much of the trouble at present. It is a very
long drawn-out process before employees can get to the point of legal
industrial action and workers confronted with certain situations are now acting
spontaneously,'' Mr Bain said.
The penalties for unions who fail to issue sufficiently strong repudiations can
be harsh. In the biggest dispute in London which involved 15,000 workers, the
CWU made repeated public statements and even sent out individual warning
letters to its members.
Nonetheless, it was fined #7000 and ordered to pay costs of #100,000.
The Post Office, like other public sector bodies, has had to embrace an
aggressive managerial style from the private sector which many private firms
have long since abandoned.
It was also geared into a new philosophy for privatisation which was abandoned,
leaving it in limbo. Mr Lane thinks privatisation may still be on the agenda.
Many employers welcome the discipline unions can give to the workforce, but if
law removes this, then industrial anarchy prevails. At this year's conference,
rank and file postal workers rejected their own leadership's recommendations to
co-operate with management on certain changes.
``Some of the more far-sighted employers are concerned about these events. A
lot of them are worried that the law is so restrictive and prohibitive,'' Mr
Bain said.
Either way, as attitudes harden, there is a broader risk of a legacy of
bitterness which may sour industrial relations in the Royal Mail for some time
to come.

HIS workmates jokingly call him ``Postman Pat'', remarks made by several postal
workers as they left a highly-charged meeting in Edinburgh yesterday.
Mr John Keggie, divisional officer for Scotland and Northern Ireland and
national executive council member of the Communications Workers' Union, would
probably agree because for 12 years he was a postman, delivering mail around
Edinburgh.
For the past eight years he has been a committed member of the union and says
that he realises the frustration of his colleagues in the latest dispute which
is affecting mail deliveries all over Scotland.
Before joining Royal Mail, Mr Keggie, 36, a bachelor, was a welder working for
10 years with former Leith shipbuilders, Henry Robb and Co, where he became
full time convener of the Boilermakers' Union.
He was appointed to the national executive of the Communication Workers' Union
and, despite his call to get his members back to work, is adamant that talks
must take place with management.
Having been shouted down at a stormy meeting in Edinburgh yesterday, he
retorted at one point that he had the microphone and could talk louder than the
audience.
His tactic did not work - his members decided that they wanted to stay out.
During an unofficial strike over similar issues in May, the union leader was
pelted with coins and beer mats by workers when he asked them to return to
work.
Over the course of the dispute he also clashed with management, accusing them
of ``trying to take second deliveries behind the backdoor and actually
hoodwinking the public''. Yesterday, Mr Keggie told The Herald: ``I delivered
mail around Edinburgh for 12 years and I fully understand the anger and
frustration.
``I also understand that we must work within the legislation and have a ballot,
and I am prepared to sit round the table, for 24 hours or more if necessary, to
resolve this.''
He denied allegations that his union was acting illegally and said there was no
evidence of unofficial union involvement in any of the strikes. ``We have a
long tradition of abiding by legislation,'' he said.
Mr Keggie admitted that he was frustrated by the situation, but repeated that
he could understand the attitude of his members.
He felt Royal Mail was gradually chipping away at staff and the service it
claimed to provide. ``Latest proposals take out 156 second deliveries in
Edinburgh alone,'' he stated.
He also claimed that with a profit of #481m last year in a postal service which
was the most efficient in the world, Royal Mail was insistent on imposing
conditions affecting staff by the desire to remove second deliveries.
Mr Keggie, responsible for some 13,000 members in Scotland and Northern
Ireland, said: ``I think there will always be a service, but it could decimate
second deliveries, particularly in rural areas.''
The union leader added that it was not an impossibility that a ``poste
restante'' system, as operated in France, where customers have to collect their
own mail, could be introduced by Royal Mail.

ROYAL Mail boss Alex Gibb strenuously denies he is the hard man at the face of
macho management.
``I'm definitely not one of the new management breed,'' said the 49-year-old
Royal Mail delivery director for Scotland and Northern Ireland who has been
given the tough job as the public voice of management in the increasingly
bitter dispute.
His own career in the Post Office started 30 years ago as a junior executive.
Since then he has taken in London, Oxford, Bristol, and Aberdeen before
returning to Edinburgh.
Mr Gibb defends the Royal Mail's industrial relations policy during a period of
dramatic change in working practices.
``We have not made one person compulsorily redundant despite the fact that we
have virtually fully automated the sorting process in Scotland. I think that's
a good record,'' he said.
The process of change has been rapid. Mail volumes are increasing and through
use of aircraft and automated processing it is getting through faster. ``Almost
90% of the mail is now available to go out in the first delivery whereas
previously it was 60%.
``The impact on second delivery is that we have less mail. We have no intention
of getting rid of the second delivery but it is the number of people available
to make that second delivery. That is the issue at the core of this particular
industrial action,'' he said.
Royal Mail has sought to introduce a computerised system Card to revise
delivery rounds. That means fewer posties.
Mr Gibb says there is extensive consultation with the Communication Workers'
Union over the introduction of changes and ample time is left should the union
wish to ballot.
``Mail volume is increasing and with it the workload of postal workers. I think
they genuinely feel a bit under pressure, but we do increase the amount of time
into those deliveries to help them.
``There is always a strong resistance to change. It is not about managers
pushing harder, it is about people managing that change,'' he said.
Mr Gibb concedes that management could at times explain better the reasons
behind moves to its staff and take them with it. However, he insists this was
not the case at Portobello, where the current dispute broke out. Managers had
proposed converting seven duties to part-time but then agreed to a staff
proposal reducing this to four.
``What we asked them to do in Portobello were the new duties the postmen
themselves proposed to us. It was the intervention of their divisional union
representatives which changed this. They said these were not acceptable and not
in line with the union's policy.
``That's how crazy this is. I don't think the postmen themselves understand it
and I find the whole thing absolutely incredible''
Mr Gibb claims the union's position is further compromised by the presence of
some officials on picket lines when the union had told its members to go back
to work.
He said the Royal Mail's job was to improve services to customers, using new
technology and taking its staff with it. ``This is about changing so that we
grow the business and jobs. We want to improve quality and value for money.''
he added.
The trouble is that for all the technological investment the Royal Mail is
still heavily labour-intensive at the point of delivery. Posties still have the
power to exercise their industrial muscle, legally or not.

THE Royal Mail fears the postal dispute could permanently damage its business,
as Scottish couriers reported booming trade yesterday.
The Union of Communications Workers - which has repudiated the unofficial
action - dismisses this claim as ``scare tactics''.
But industry analysts maintain postal workers are shooting themselves in the
foot by forcing business to look at alternative services for delivery of legal
and financial documents.
``Business cannot grind to a halt and many documents have to get through,''
said Mr Bill McCall of Edinburgh stockbrokers Tilney &amp; Co. He added that the
Royal Mail should be concerned that firms would not return with their business
after the dispute because of the standard of service rendered by competitors.
ScotRail never recovered a large number of customers forced to use alternatives
such as buses or cars during a recent series of strikes.
``For the postal workers it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' said Mr
McCall.
``Depending on the amount of business Royal Mail loses, they could find
themselves out of a job. But for the independent contractors - it's a
heaven-sent opportunity for them to make their mark.''
Royal Mail confirmed it was worried about the potential loss of business.
``All past experience of strikes means that we will lose customers,'' a
spokesman said. He suggested that all the strikers were doing was damaging the
long-term prospects of the business ``and in effect their jobs''.
Courier firms across Scotland were reporting greatly increased activity. Pony
Express in Edinburgh said its workload had doubled: ``Mainly from lawyers and
accountancy firms.'' The company charges about #7 for an overnight door-to-door
delivery, but firms are willing to pay the price and it has even had to turn
away business.
Mr Donald Hendry, at Falcon Couriers in Glasgow ,said it was equally busy. ``We
are building up a head of steam. We hope that some of the business will remain
with us after the dispute is over. It is making companies realise they have
other options.''
Eagle Couriers in Edinburgh reckons its normal workload has increased ``at
least six-fold over the past few days and is continuing to rise''. It has been
transporting franked Scottish bulk mail, destined for addresses in England,
across the border in a bid to get mail moving.
On Wednesday night the plan to ship mail to a sorting office in Newcastle ran
into difficulties when local management refused to accept Scottish mail in case
it caused a knock-on dispute. The mail was eventually accepted at Darlington.
A broadly similar dispute over changed working practices, which the CWU sees as
undermining second deliveries, closed Royal Mail operations throughout
Newcastle during April when official action by 900 staff at 15 offices halted
deliveries in the area for two weeks.
Earlier this year the union was fined #7500 and made to pay costs of some
#100,000 by the High Court when it was deemed not to have acted sufficiently
firmly to damp down an unofficial stoppage by members in North-west London in
protest at moves to improve first deliveries.
The union maintains that the action by its Scottish members, which it wants
legitimised through a legal ballot but is unable to achieve because ballot
papers are caught up in the postal backlog, is designed to preserve postal
services not undermine them. It accuses the Royal Mail of seeking to delay
second deliveries in order to load first deliveries.
Management rejects this, claiming that more post is going first delivery and
therefore fewer postal workers are required for second deliveries - which they
emphasise are not at risk.
The Royal Mail - subject to poor industrial relations - has suffered a series
of disputes over the closure of Crown post offices and revised working
practices, both of which impact on jobs.
The union sees little long-term damage to Royal Mail business because it still
enjoys a monopoly of letters under #1 and few businesses tend to stick with the
far higher courier rates once regular postal deliveries are restored.
Parcels are a different matter, but even so the Post Office's ParcelForce
subsidiary, which is the only carrier with an obligation to deliver nationwide,
still handles some 90% of domestic packages. But other carriers, such as TNT,
DHL, and United Parcels Service continue to make inroads.

Pretoria, Thursday
WHEN Nelson Mandela last met Percy Yutar, 31 years ago, the diminutive
prosecutor was trying to lock him up forever. Today, they had lunch.
Mandela has shown a knack for charming former enemies to bring reconciliation
to South Africa, but the meeting with Yutar stood above most.
In 1964, Yutar prosecuted Mandela and nine others for plotting sabotage to
bring down white minority rule in a trial that came to symbolise the injustice
of apartheid. All received life sentences.
Yutar criticised the defendants for appointing themselves to ``tell the entire
(black) population of this country, and indeed the whole of the world, that
they were suppressed, oppressed and depressed.''
Now 84, Yutar saw Mandela freed in 1990 and elected the nation's first black
president last year. That he was invited to lunch with the president
represents, say Mandela's staff, South Africa's need to forgive without
forgetting.
What does Yutar say now, after Mandela dined with him, put his arm around him,
shook his hand before the news media, and gently joked about remembering him
being taller?
``It shows the great humility of this saintly man who has done so much in this
short space of time, and I have no doubt whatsoever that he will achieve very
much more,'' Yutar said. ``All I can say, with all the sincerity at my command,
is may the Almighty bless him with good health and years.''-AP.

NINE members of the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee set off yesterday for a
12-day visit to New Zealand, at a potential cost to the taxpayer of more than
#50,000, leaving Westminster fuming at what one MP described as a ``costly and
nonsensical junket''.
Although the MPs - three Labour, one SNP, and five Tories, of which three are
English - were given permission to travel, they will miss next week's
announcement on constitutional changes by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth,
as well as Tuesday's Budget.
Last night, MPs on all sides expressed dismay at the length and purpose of the
visit, which is part of the committee's study of Scottish agriculture. Some
Scottish MPs questioned the usefulness of any research by a committee which
includes a number of English Tory MPs.
They said it was inappropriate for the committee to undertake a questionable
fact-finding mission just weeks after the Commons agreed to tighter controls on
MPs' behaviour. Conservative, Sir Teddy Taylor, said there was nothing for the
committee to learn about Scottish agriculture in New Zealand.
``It's the most costly and nonsensical parliamentary junket I've ever seen in
31 years at Westminster,'' he said.
The MPs are travelling business class - current full-fare #4544 - and will
receive a daily living allowance of #120. Their visit includes several nights
in Queenstown, the exclusive mountain resort used by Commonwealth leaders at
the recent summit. A frontbench Labour MP dismissed the committee as ``a bunch
of wasters'', and added: ``I hope they're slated for it'', while an adviser to
Labour leader Tony Blair said, with obvious irony: ``I'm sure they will derive
a lot of benefit from it.''
Two members of the committee, Tory Allan Stewart and Liberal Democrat Ray
Michie, refused to go.
A spokesman for Ms Michie said: ``She would have liked to have gone but felt it
was too far and too long to be out of the country, and I'm sure the cost factor
was in her mind.''
The MPs who have gone are: Chairman William McKelvey, Labour MP for Kilmarnock
and Loudon; Mr David Marshall, Labour MP for Glasgow Shettleston; Mr Robert
Hughes, Labour MP for Aberdeen North; Mr Phil Gallie, Tory MP for Ayr; Mr Bill
Walker, Tory MP for Tayside North; Mr Andrew Welsh, SNP MP for Angus East; and
three English MPs, Mr Terry Dicks, Mr Tim Devlin, and Mr Peter Atkinson.
The presence of urban Labour MPs on an agricultural mission amused Tory MPs.
Dover MP David Shaw said: ``The interest of Glasgow Labour MPs in agriculture
is perhaps eccentric'', while Mr Alan Duncan, MP for Rutland, said: ``I look
forward to the greening of the Gorbals on their return.''
According to committee staff, the MPs will return on December 4. Two members,
Mr Dicks and Mr Marshall, left last Friday, a week ahead of their colleagues.
The MPs have permission from their whips to be away. They will be back in time
for the vote on the Budget.

Brussels, Thursday
NATO members are becoming worried over the time it is taking to find a new
chief for the Alliance - just as it faces the job of sending thousands of
troops to Bosnia.
``We have to settle this soon, but we don't seem to be making any progress. No
new candidates are emerging,'' said senior Alliance diplomat.
The delay is being blamed on a clash between the US and France.
When Belgium's Willy Claes resigned as secretary-general on October 20 over a
corruption scandal, Nato sources predicted he would quickly be replaced.
Former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers emerged as the first choice of the
main European allies but was vetoed by Washington, which was concerned about
his knowledge of Bosnia.
The US subsequently made it clear it favoured former Danish Foreign Minister
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, but Paris has said no to him.
France has shown no inclination to back down even though most other allies, and
particularly Britain and Germany, have indicated he would be acceptable.
Paris is upset about outspoken Scandinavian criticism of its nuclear tests in
the South Pacific and French diplomats say privately that President Jacques
Chirac will not give in, even at the cost of straining Alliance unity.
Last week Spanish Foreign Secretary Javier Solana was mentioned as a possible
compromise candidate, but Madrid has yet to present him and an early bandwagon
in his favour appears to have run out of steam.
Nato Foreign Ministers meet in Brussels on December 5 and want to anoint a new
secretary-general before despatching 60,000 Alliance troops to Bosnia in Nato's
riskiest operation yet.
``It is inconceivable that we have every one here and cannot name a new
secretary-general,'' said one Alliance source.
Diplomats say the issue is complicated by domestic American politics and by the
failure of London and Bonn to come out strongly for Ellemann-Jensen and
persuade France to fall into line.-Reuter.

SCOTTISH Catholics are finding it too expensive to travel to the shrine at
Lourdes in France, according to the Scottish Catholic Observer newspaper.
All of Scotland's Roman Catholic bishops are due to meet on Monday to discuss
ways to cut the cost - including pooling resources for a national pilgrimage by
Euro-rail, instead of separate diocesan trips.
Sentence delayed
A YOUTH who grabbed and stripped a lollipop lady on her way to her duties in
Helensburgh, Dumbartonshire, was ordered to the High Court for sentencing
yesterday. At Dumbarton Sheriff Court, William McPhee, 21, of East Princes
Street, Helensburgh, admitted assaulting Mrs Mary McLean, 60, and resisting
arrest after he had been drinking.
Braveheart plea
AN SNP councillor has criticised Falkirk District Council for failing to mark
the Battle of Falkirk - when William Wallace fought the English - this year
instead of on its 500th anniversary in 1998. Councillor David Alexander claims
the area could benefit from an annual celebration to cash in on the so-called
Braveheart effect.
Motor cyclist killed
A MOTOR cyclist died last night after a four-vehicle pile-up on the A75 Gretna
to Stranraer road between Annan and Carrutherstown. The dead man's identity was
not disclosed as police tried to contact his next-of-kin. No-one else was
injured in the incident which happened near Stenries.
Deacon Billy
COMEDIAN Billy Connolly is to star as Deacon Brodie in a new 90-minute Screen
One film for BBC TV. The film will be shot in Scotland and London, starting on
January 22. Brodie was convicted in 1788 of a series of crimes in Edinburgh and
sentenced to be hanged on gallows he had designed.
Bomb warning
THE RUC issued a warning yesterday after phosphorous flares were washed up on
beaches along Northern Ireland's Antrim coast. Similar devices washed up in
Donegal were dealt with by the Irish army. Hundreds of the flares, believed to
have been dumped in the Irish Sea by the Army, have been washed up on
Scotland's west coast.
Pump alert
LOTHIAN Trading Standards warned yesterday that Penn Plax aquarium pumps,
possibly issued to 1000 outlets in Scotland, fail legal standards on electrical
insulation. They should be returned to vendors.
Wedding belle
ERSKINE-based designer Betty Macmillan won the Best Scottish Designer award at
the Best of British Bridal awards in London yesterday with a wedding outfit
modelled by Eileen Catterson - who is engaged to Wet Wet Wet singer Marti
Pellow. Ms Macmillan set up in business only a year ago.
Somerville inquiry
METROPOLITAN Police are to investigate how details of the arrest of ITN
newsreader Julia Somerville, 48, and her boyfriend Jeremy Dixon, 56, over
family snapshots, became public, it was announced yesterday.
Body found
A 28-YEAR-OLD Ayrshire man was found dead in Ruchill Park, Glasgow, yesterday.
Mr William McKenzie, of Darg Road, Stevenson, was found in bushes in the park.
His death may have been drug-related. A report will be sent to the
procurator-fiscal.
Fox rescue
FIREFIGHTERS in Edinburgh last night struggled for two hours to release a fox
trapped between two houses in Dean Path. They had to remove parts of an
internal and external wall before finally freeing the animal into the hands of
the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

LABOUR was last night celebrating a St Andrew's Day political sting against
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth by making him subsidise plans for a Scottish
parliament.
Through the Labour-dominated Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla),
devolutionists have booked Scotland Europa, in the heart of Brussels, for a
presentation of its plans for a parliament in Edinburgh.
The presentation will be made by STUC general secretary Campbell Christie and
Labour Lothians Euro-MP David Martin, a vice president of the European
Parliament, on November 30 on behalf of the Scottish Constitutional Convention.
It will form half of a dual presentation for Labour's Home Rule plans. At the
same time Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson will be formally unveiling
the convention's blueprint for Scottish Home Rule in Edinburgh.
Mr Forsyth, an implacable opponent of a Scottish parliament, has made elaborate
plans to torpedo Labour's efforts by making his own St Andrew's Day
announcement on how the Tories would return a measure of political
decision-making to Scotland.
But last night it emerged that he had been outflanked in Brussels where the
Scottish Office is the paymaster of Scotland Europa whose members include
Labour-dominated Cosla.
As one of Scotland Europa's main members and financial subscribers, Cosla is
entitled to the use of the Brussels premises at no extra charge. Scotland
Europa - Scotland's ``embassy'' in the European Union - is funded by Scottish
Enterprise but makes a loss which is annually written off by the Scottish
Office under Mr Forsyth's direction.
This means he will, in effect, be subventing Labour's home rule presentation
which has the backing of the Liberal Democrats, trade unions, churches and many
other organisations, excluding the Tories and the SNP.
Mr Christie was travelling last night and unavailable but his deputy, Mr Bill
Spiers, confirmed the convention's move. ``In our campaign for a Scottish home
rule parliament we have in the past toured around the embassies of several EU
member states and petitioned the European Parliament,'' he said.
``It is entirely appropriate, therefore, that the Scottish embassy in Brussels
should be the launching pad for a parliament which is supported by such a wide
section of the Scottish people.''
Under Labour's proposals Scotland Europa would be transformed from a lobbying
force into a stronger political presence, in the style of a powerful German
lnder, and made directly answerable to a Minister in the Scottish parliament.
A Scotland Europa official last night described the booking as ``routine''. He
said a Cosla booking was not something which would be interfered with because a
conference room for a presentation was ``something which they have already
bought into''.
He added: ``This is not something we would refer to Edinburgh.''

CHAOTIC business deals cost the Beatles a fortune and contributed to their
eventual split, a new documentary claims.
As their first new single in 25 years is about to hit the charts, Channel 4's
All You Need is Cash, to be screened on Monday, reveals that the Fab Four
received only 1p for a double sided record in royalties from EMI in their
heyday because manager Brian Epstein was so desperate to get a deal.
George Martin, who produced the records said: ``I don't think the deals he did
were too bad. He had no option and EMI were notoriously tight-fisted.''
The royalties even had to be split between the four and Epstein so they
actually only ended up with a fifth of a penny each.
Better contracts were renegotiated in 1967 and 1969 but by then Epstein was
dead after having also missed out on lucrative American merchandising deals
allowing an American company to take 90% leaving them only 10%.
The documentary, the result of extensive research in Britain and America, says
that when the Apple Corp was formed to look after their business affairs things
improved dramatically but the more Paul McCartney became involved, the more
John Lennon became annoyed and it began to sour their relationship.
Their accountant Harry Pinsker says that in their early days they had even
turned down a $3m Coca-Cola contract because they were afraid it would all go
in tax.
Now with the release of the new single, a series of albums and a six-part
documentary they are set to make around $100m this year alone, the programme
says.

Tel Aviv, Thursday
A SUSPECT in the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin told investigators that Prime
Minister Shimon Peres was to have been the next target, it was revealed today.
Police investigator Arieh Silberman told a Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court that
Dror Adani, suspected of conspiracy in the murder, admitted that he plotted
Rabin's assassination along with confessed killer Yigal Amir.
``Investigators asked Adani: `Was your ultimate intention to strike at both
Rabin and Peres and in this way to halt the peace process?' '' said Silberman.
``His response was: `Let's just say that both were defined as murderers whose
fate was death but we did not decide who was first. Perhaps if things had gone
smoothly with Rabin, we would have moved on to Peres'.''
Judges today ordered both Adani and Yigal Amir's brother, Hagai Amir, to be
held until November 30 when police expect to issue indictments.
Yigal Amir, a 25-year-old religious Jew, said he murdered Prime Minister Rabin
on November 4 to halt the handover of land for Palestinian self-rule but
insists he acted alone.
Police have arrested at least eight others since the murder, all religious Jews
in their 20s, suspecting them of various offences including conspiracy to
murder the 73-year-old leader and planning attacks against Palestinians.
In other developments today, new Foreign Minister Ehud Barak said Israel should
hold on to large tracts of occupied territory in any final peace settlement
with the Palestinians.
In a speech in central Israel, the former army chief made a clear grab for the
security mantle of his slain mentor, Rabin.
``We are now considering the possibility of making compromises with the
Palestinians and also with the Syrians. But we will not do this in a way that
will harm the basic security of the state of Israel,'' he said.
Barak went on to draw a map for the area in which East Jerusalem and areas in
the occupied West Bank captured in the 1967 Middle East war would remain under
Israeli control.
Israel, Barak said, should keep the Jordan Valley and Etzion areas in the
occupied West Bank as well as a corridor of Jewish settlements just over the
pre-1967 Middle East war border in the western part of the region.-Reuter.

RELATIVES of French peacekeepers killed in former Yugoslavia threatened to
disrupt the signing of a peace deal in Paris unless two French pilots believed
held by Bosnian Serbs are freed.
The group said the formal signing of the peace deal clinched in Dayton,
expected early next month, must be put off until Captain Frederic Chiffot and
Lieutenant Jose Souvignet are released.
They have been missing for 11 weeks since their Mirage 2000 was shot down over
Bosnia during Nato raids around the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale. The group
said it ``demands that the Paris conference for the signing of the peace
accords be postponed indefinitely until the release of our fellow-
``If this is not done, a spectacular action may take place,'' it said.
The French National Assembly foreign affairs committee decided today to send a
mission to Belgrade to investigate the fate of the        two airmen.
The pilots were caught by Bosnian Serb forces but Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic has since said they were seized from a hospital by unknown kidnappers.
French officials have voiced fears they have been killed.
The relatives had earlier urged President Jacques Chirac to veto the lifting of
UN sanctions imposed on Serbia for its armed support of separatist Serb forces
until the pilots were released, but the request came hours after the Security
Council suspended the embargo.-Reuter.

TALKS in a bid to end the postal strike broke down for the third successive
time last night. A three-hour meeting between union leaders and Royal Mail
managers in Edinburgh ended in deadlock.
A Royal Mail official claimed that progress had been made on a number of key
issues. However, management stuck to its three demands of an immediate return
to work, flexibility to deal with the backlog of mail, and resolution of the
flare-up at Portobello, which led to the strike, on terms agreed with the staff
before the intervention of officials of the Union of Communication Workers.
The postal workers continued to defy their full-time union officials yesterday,
despite having been told that the union could not help them unless they went
back to work.
The unofficial strike spread to Perth and Dundee, crippling deliveries across
the whole of Central Scotland. Up to 5000 workers have now gone on strike and
those attending meetings in Glasgow and Edinburgh voted to continue their
action.
Police in Edinburgh said a 28-year-old man was arrested after an incident
involving a Royal Mail van in Craiglockhart Avenue. A police spokesman said a
report was being prepared for the procurator-fiscal.
Earlier in the day, Mr Alex Gibb, Royal Mail delivery director, said they could
not resolve the dispute while the workers remained on strike. Management
attempted to persuade workers not to join the dispute by setting up a
confidential helpline on which management put their case. The strike began at
Portobello in Edinburgh where staff are unhappy at changes to their working
day. The changes would mean more mail going out in the first delivery. They
fear that it would eventually lead to the loss of thousands of full-time jobs
across Scotland and the greater use of part-time and casual workers.
The strength of support elsewhere suggests that postal workers are fed up with
what they describe as bullying tactics by a thoughtless, macho-style of
management.
Mr Gibb claims their fears are ``total rubbish''. He said: ``This illegal
action is taking place because of the last-minute intervention of the CWU in
objecting to plans worked up and agreed with staff in Portobello which were
aimed at improving service to customers who want to get their mail as early as
possible.
``The reality is we are now getting a great deal of mail through for the
morning's first delivery and we need to change the staffing structures to
ensure we have enough postmen and postwomen to deliver the extra mail on the
first delivery but that we are not over-staffed for the now very light second
delivery.''
Mr Bill Speirs, deputy general secretary of the STUC, said it was obvious from
the way the strike was spreading rapidly that something had gone badly wrong
with industrial relations in the Royal Mail in Scotland.
He urged management to ``see sense'' and set aside the changes imposed at
Portobello until they were properly negotiated with the union.
The Royal Mail confirmed that staff in Dundee, Perth, Inverclyde, Renfrew,
Bridge of Weir, Cupar, Glenrothes, and Burntisland had joined the action taken
by colleagues in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
More than 400 staff walked out in Perth and Dundee after they were asked to
process mail normally handled in Edinburgh.
Mr Joe Malone, CWU Tayside branch secretary, said: ``Staff decided on
industrial action after they were asked to carry out duties they wouldn't
normally carry out. As this is an unofficial strike, I must ask my members to
return to work but I fully understand their frustration and their reasons for
this action.''
He added: ``We are working to resolve the situation but when workers are asked
to carry out the duties of their striking colleagues, it is no wonder the
dispute has spread to Tayside.''
A Royal Mail spokesman said it had not been an unreasonable request. Because
the strike is unofficial, any support from the union could leave it open to
punitive damages in the courts. The union has attempted to stay within the law
by giving each striker a letter from the union's general secretary stating that
the union repudiated their action.
That was why Mr John Keggie, CWU East of Scotland organiser, told the workers'
meeting in Edinburgh: ``The official position is that until such time as we
return to normal work, we are going to have a difficulty and must abide by
trade-union legislation. There is no question of the union supporting us
without a ballot.''
However, he was shouted down and slow-handclapped by his members who voted
unanimously to stay out.
Later, on leaving the talks with Mr Gibb, Mr Keggie said he was deeply
disappointed no solution had been found.
He said: ``At first, the Royal Mail had been making very positive noises and
were even talking about arrangements for the recovery period for clearing the
backlog of mail when everyone was back at work.
``Then we had an adjournment and, for whatever reason, when we came back into
the room the mood of the management had changed. Yet again, talks broke down,
which we find very disappointing. And so the strike continues`.
Mr Gibb said: ``The stumbling block again concerns the work duties of staff at
our Portobello depot as implemented on Monday.
``While the union are prepared to discuss clearing the backlog of mail that's
gathering, the offer they made to us about the Portobello depot was quite
frankly rather woolly. Their attitude is one of let's wait and see what happens
once the backlog is cleared. We can't accept that attitude.''
Meanwhile, courier firms in Edinburgh say their business has doubled in the
last two days, and Jobcentres are making provisions for unemployment benefit
giros caught up in the mail backlog to be reissued in person.
Last night Royal Mail admitted it was using contract lorries to send batches of
mail for sorting at English centres to clear mail due for delivery south of the
Border.
The union's divisional officer, Mr George Robertson, said he was aware of the
practice but the union had issued instructions against any sympathy action.
``This is a Scottish issue at the moment and we have made it quite clear to our
colleagues in England that we do not want them to take any action. This is an
unofficial dispute and all we want to do is get our members back to work.''
q The public service union, Unison, has predicted a spring-time of industrial
unrest if the Government does not provide financial support for future pay
increases in the public sector.

THE head of the company appointed by the Government to run one of the only rail
franchises to make it to privatisation was exposed last night as a director of
a double-glazing firm that went into liquidation with a trail of debts.
According to documents obtained by Labour, Mr John Ansdell was one of two
directors of Conservatories and Windows (UK) Ltd, which was wound up in May. He
is now director of Resurgence Railways, the Government's approved bidder for
the Great Western franchise.
Labour's transport spokeman Brian Wilson last night called for the resignations
of Transport Secretary Sir George Young and franchising director Roger Salmon
in the face of what he called ``a farce''.
``It confirms the depths of farce and desperation into which rail privatisation
has descended, that they are prepared to hand over the historic Great Western
Railway to a failed double-glazing salesman.
``This company has no record of running a passenger railway, yet they have
cleared every hurdle prior to the franchise being granted,'' he said.
Great Western Railway, which runs from London to the West Country and Wales, is
one of only three passenger franchises to have emerged with a chance of being
privatised before the next election, despite the Government's promise to sell
half of them by 1997.
Earlier this month, the Government announced it had chosen Resurgence Railways
Holdings Ltd as its favoured bidder for the franchise. Mr Ansdell is managing
director of the company, an off-the-shelf company set up earlier this year.
According to Labour, Conservatories and Windows Ltd had about 30 creditors when
it was wound up in court in Southampton. Mr Wilson said: ``Young and Salmon
must answer some questions. Did they know about Mr Ansdell's business record?
If not, they are incompetent beyond belief. If so, why was a liquidated double
glazier deemed fit to run a railway?''

<TEXT>
RUC chiefs in Belfast were yesterday considering an offer to pinpoint the
burial sites of 30 unarmed IRA suspects allegedly killed by the SAS in Northern
Ireland.
The killings are alleged in a book by a man, who uses the pseudonym Paul Bruce,
and claims to be a former SAS soldier.
The author faxed a letter to RUC Chief Constable Sir Hugh Annesley offering to
identify the exact position of the alleged burial sites.
In his book The Nemesis File, published this week, he alleges his squad carried
out the killings between 1971 and 1972 as part of a covert war against the IRA.
But the Ministry of Defence said it had serious doubts about Bruce's
credentials as a member of the SAS.
A spokesman said the book contained consistently inaccurate descriptions of SAS
recruitment and selection procedures, as well as references to SAS capabilities
that did not exist at the time.
Referring to the author's claims about the murders of members of the IRA, the
spokesman said: ``If that were the case it would be extraordinary if they had
not come to light before now.
``If the RUC take these allegations seriously then we are sure they will
investigate them.''
A Sinn Fein spokesman described Bruce's claims as ``totally outlandish'', and
said they should be taken with ``a large pinch of Siberian salt''.

A NEW scanner which will revolutionize diag-nosis of a wide variety of medical
problems was unveiled at Ayr Hospital yesterday.
Mr Matthew Torrance, 43, from Cumnock, became the first patient to use the
Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner at Ayr - and received the good news that his
knee problems may be treated without surgery.
The #1m scanner, the first of its kind in a district general hospital, has been
bought by Ayrshire Medical Support Ltd and will be operated by hospital staff.
The company is a non-profit making organisation headed by local businessman Sir
Donald Maclean, who stressed that there is no question of any patient having to
pay for the MRI service.
He said: ``This is an excellent example of a joint venture between the private
and public sectors.
``The facility will operate within the NHS and there is no question of patients
having to pay. It's a free NHS service, full stop.''
The new scanner uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to transmit the
clearest internal pictures possible for use in detecting and diagnosing a wide
range of problems, especially in the fields of orthopaedics, vascular
disorders, ENT, and gynaecology.
Dr Keith Osborne, consultant radiologist, said: ``The MRI scanner opens up a
wide range of possibilities for us where other investigative methods are not
available.
``It means in many cases that invasive surgery will be avoided because we
obtain such a clear picture of the area involved.''
Mr Torrance gave the scanner full marks for avoiding the need of an exploratory
operation.
q A similar scanning facility has now been installed at Crosshouse Hospital,
giving Ayrshire a choice of two of the revolutionary machines.

Milosevic, boosted by lifting of UN
sanctions, wins pledge to negotiate.
SANCTIONS on Serbia ended and Bosnian Serb leaders agreed to accept the Bosnian
peace deal negotiated by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic despite
objections to key parts of it, Yugoslav news agencies reported today.
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Milosevic summoned hostile Bosnian Serb
leaders, including ``president'' Radovan Karadzic, to talks near Belgrade where
they endorsed terms he negotiated in their name at a summit in Dayton, Ohio,
this week.
However there was no authoritative confirmation from Bosnian Serb leaders and
the Bosnian Serbs' own media said tonight that the results of the Belgrade
talks were not yet known.
Bosnian Serb leaders have denounced the deal as a betrayal. The Bosnian Serb
news agency SRNA issued a commentary tonight demanding that its key territorial
provisions, including the handover of Serb areas of Sarajevo, be renegotiated.
Tanjug said Karadzic and the rest of the Bosnian Serb leadership had agreed to
``implement it in its entirety''.
The independent Belgrade news agency Beta quoted an unidentified ``high Bosnian
Serb official'' as saying: ``We had no choice, we must accept all points
provided by the peace agreement.''
Bosnia's Prime Minister welcomed the news. ``If it's true then it's good news
for all in Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' Haris Silajdzic told government television.
``We should start with co-operation for implementation as soon as possible,''
he added.
Bosnian Serb television told its viewers the results of the Belgrade talks were
not yet known.
Bosnian Serb agreement to the Dayton pact would be a fillip to President Bill
Clinton's drive to overcome opposition in Congress to the deployment of 20,000
US troops in a 60,000-strong Nato peacekeeping force.
Diplomats in Sarajevo say they fear Serbs might attack UN personnel to frighten
Congress into refusing to send them.
Karazdic's participation in the Belgrade talks was possibly one of the last
decisive acts of his role in the Bosnian Serb rebellion against Bosnian
independence.
He and army commander General Ratko Mladic are wanted by a UN war crimes
tribunal and so are barred from power by the treaty.
Some Bosnian Serb leaders are furious that Milosevic surrendered the Serb
sector of Sarajevo and agreed to impose a corridor across their territory from
the capital to the Muslim enclave of Gorazde.
Milosevic was determined to put the war and sanctions behind him and to stop
one million or so Bosnian Serbs holding hostage the economic future of rump
Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro.
Any serious violation of the treaty he agreed in the United States could lead
to the re-imposition of the trade and oil sanctions which the United Nations
suspended yesterday.
The sanctions were imposed in May 1992 to punish the Serbian leader for helping
the Bosnian Serbs fight Bosnian independence and have helped to cripple the
Yugoslav economy.
Countries neighbouring Serbia and Montenegro began to lift border controls as
ordinary Yugoslavs hailed a rebirth. The daily Vecernje Novosti trumpeted:
``Goodbye Sanctions!''
However economists ruled out a swift improvement in living standards and called
for market reforms of the state-dominated economy.
Yugoslavia will still lack access to credits, through organisations like the
International Monetary Fund or World Bank, to revive its decrepit economic
infrastructure.
Many people hoped that supplies of essential foreign goods and petrol would
improve.
Bosnian Serb leaders have only limited scope to defy Milosevic since their part
of Bosnia is effectively bankrupt and depends on economic and military support
from Serbia.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic weighed in with a warning that his
Muslim-led government would pull out of the peace treaty if Nato did not arrive.
Several thousand from the Nato contingent are already in Bosnia as part of the
UN peacekeeping contingent that Nato will replace. They will simply switch
allegiance.
US Defence Secretary William Perry said during a visit to Macedonia today that
25 countries had said they would send troops to join the force.
Newcomers, including the US troops, will be deployed next month after the
presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia formally sign the treaty in Paris.
The Nato mission will be laid down at a follow-up conference in London on
December 8-9.-Reuter.

<TEXT>
A WOMAN who claimed she was sexually harassed said she confronted her alleged
harasser and asked if he was aware of the stress he was causing.
The 47-year-old telephonist and receptionist claimed the man made abusive and
offensive gestures in front of her in the street on two separate occasions and
had deliberately bumped into her.
She also claimed he used to glare and stare at her while she was working at the
reception desk.
The woman and a 37-year-old colleague have taken their employer and the man
they accuse of sexually harassing them to a Glasgow industrial tribunal. The
tribunal has ordered that none of the parties can be identified until its
decision is issued.
The 47-year-old woman told the tribunal how the man had made a rude gesture to
her in the street. She said he had raised his hands and moved his lower body in
a thrusting motion.
On another occasion, she claimed he stuck his fingers in his mouth as if to be
sick.
She claimed her alleged harasser used to miaow as he passed her after they had
been to the theatre to see Cats.
She confronted him and asked if he was aware of the stress he was causing. ``I
was informed he was receiving counselling. I pointed out that I also was in
distress.''
She claimed he was trying to poison the atmosphere at the workplace and
contacted the Equal Opportunities Commission.
She received an advice booklet and decided to confront him over the telephone
but she said he replied: ``Don't be silly.''
After complaining about him, it was agreed that there was to be no eye contact
between the two for a period of four weeks.
She admitted a mirror was perched on the reception desk and used to see what
was going on behind as well as for cosmetic reasons. She also brought in a tape
recorder so that she could ``speak into it if things were happening to me''.
Solicitor Raymond Williamson, for the company, asked her: ``Wouldn't colleagues
think it odd you sitting at your reception desk with a rear-view mirror and a
tape recorder?'' Referring to the mirror, she replied ``It is sitting there in
front of me. It is dual purpose.''
The company and the alleged harasser deny sex discrimination. The EOC is
supporting the two women in their fight. The hearing will continue for a week
in the New Year.

GREENOCK has been selected as a destination for the Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race
in 1999, raising hopes that up to #30m could be injected into the local
economy, it was announced yesterday.
The event was a big success when it was held in Edinburgh earlier this year. Up
to one million tourists provided a multi-million pound boost for the capital.
The ships' four-day stay in the town could bring similar benefits.
Around 100 of the world's most historic ships, with 3000 crew members, will
sail into Greenock for the event. The town beat off competition from 10 other
destinations in Belgium, Denmark, France and the United Kingdom.
The Greenock bid was backed by Inverclyde District Council, Renfrewshire
Enterprise and Clydeport.
Inverclyde provost Mr Allan Robertson said: ``This is a major event which will
give worldwide publicity to our area and will set the seal on the current
redevelopments under way in the town.''
The 1999 event will involve a race from St Malo in France to Greenock. From
there the ships will cruise up the west coast and on to Lerwick before
completing the final stage of the race to Aalborg in Denmark.

INFLATION was 9.5% when he became Prime Minister. Now it was 2.9%, Mr Major
said proudly.
The Opposition howled with laughter, remembering, as Mr Major apparently
didn't, that his previous job was Chancellor of the Exchequer, to whom the
higher figure could be attributed.
A couple of Labour MPs thought the Commons should join the rest of the nation
in discussing Princess Diana's broadcast but Mr Major was constitutionally
correct or stuffy about that, though he did snap out one of the most menacing
one-liners of his career when asked about the intervention in the
post-interview debate of Mr Nicholas Soames. ``I do not expect any more
comments,'' he said quite fiercely.
The massive Mr Soames could crush Mr Major by sitting on him, but Prime
Ministers punch at a much heavier weight than Ministers of State. Mr Soames
could indeed be reduced to the role of butler to the Prince of Wales ascribed
to him by the populist Mr Andrew Mackinlay (Thurrock - Lab.) if, indeed, a
royal butler does rank lower than a Defence Minister in the great scheme of
things.
In the last Treasury exchanges before the Budget, the Chancellor perhaps spoke
for many of us in saying he was getting fed up with Labour harping on about
economic league tables. We have dropped from 13th to 18th in a world prosperity
league headed by Luxembourg, we were told for the umpteenth time. We are 20th
out of 24 in the OECD employment growth league. We are 21st in something called
the World Economic League.
Mr Michael Jack, a Treasury Minister, suggested this was Fantasy League stuff
and one would be inclined to sympathise if it were not that Ministers look with
such a benevolent eye on education league tables.
Mr Clarke, one of the few Chancellors bold enough to deliberately conjure up
the picture of a predecessor's resignation, said cheerfully that his Shadow's
position now looked ``unassailable''.
Mr Brown and Mr Alistair Darling challenged Ministers to deny that Labour's 10p
income tax band target was fairer than Mr Major's aspiration to abolish the
inheritance and capital gains taxes.
Mr Jack performed a couple of arias about the wonders of inherited wealth which
seemed to make it clear that the Budget will be aimed at those lapsed from the
true faith rather than seeking converts among the less well-off.
Mr Major successfully countered the latest Blair sound-bite about the 7p in the
pound of extra tax raised by his Government, saying that people now had much
higher net disposable income and lower mortgages than they had when his
Government started. The election will tell us which argument the electorate
find most impressive.
Mr Clarke, being lofty about Mr Brown's 10p tax, told him: ``I am not going to
counter you with 5p - we are not in a silly auction.'' So there we are. We know
in advance there will be no question on Tuesday of taxes being cut while we are
still borrowing heavily - don't we?

THE Glasgow-based Student Loans Company is working well, the Government's
financial watchdog has found after a thorough review of operations.
But university chiefs say the loan repayment system remains fundamentally
flawed. They say it is off-putting, unfair to students and graduates, and
should be changed.
Sir John Bourn, head of the National Audit Office (NAO), began an investigation
after the state-owned company's system for processing loans for repeat
borrowers broke down last year. The break-down resulted in lengthy delays
before about 35,000 students received their money, leaving many in distress and
hardship.
Sir John blamed weaknesses in planning and management in the company but these
difficulties had since been corrected, he said in his report.
About 50% of eligible students now take out a loan. According to the latest
figures, the company had collected almost 95% of monies due to be repaid.
However, the NAO said that, of a total outstanding loan portfolio of #1.8bn,
the company estimated #127m may not be recovered because of its borrowers'
entitlement to defer payment.
In an effort to recover money from defaulters, it has forecast a 75% increase
in collections department staff.

ARMED Forces Minister Nicholas Soames is to play no further part in defending
the Prince of Wales against the media onslaught by his estranged wife.
The Prime Minister told the Commons curtly yesterday: ``I do not expect any
more comments.'' He was being urged to sack Mr Soames for accusing the Princess
of Wales of ``paranoia''.
Mr Soames, former equerry to the Prince of Wales, has been told by the Palace
and by the Prime Minister that he should make no further public comment.
At the same time, Mr Soames remains in his ministerial post with the full
confidence of the Prime Minister.
Mr Major's brief observation at Commons Question Time yesterday follows his
audience with the Queen last Tuesday night and a further meeting with her on
Wednesday night at the annual reception for foreign diplomats.
The Queen has not asked the Prime Minister to offer advice as to the
constitutional implications of the princess's insistence in her BBC Panorama
interview that she is not seeking a divorce. Both the Prince of Wales and his
wife have now publicly admitted adultery.
Yesterday's Cabinet was not obliged to discuss the situation because the Queen
has not asked her Government for advice.
The princess left yesterday for an unofficial ``charity'' visit to Argentina
and chatted happily to journalists on her plane during the 13-hour flight.
She expressed her delight that British public opinion after her broadcast -
watched by more than 21 millon viewers - has swung behind her in sympathy for a
woman who believes that the royal establishment cold-shouldered her when she
needed help and support, when suffering from post-natal depression and bulimia.
Buckingham Palace officials are now trying belatedly to bring her onside and
find a way to fulfil her publicly stated desire to be of service to the nation.
Yesterday the logistical details of her sensational broadcast - which is to be
repeated in Argentina and the United States over the next 48 hours - were
emerging.
The princess and the BBC worked on the Panorama interview over 17 hours of
filming which was edited down, with her having the final say, to an hour-long
broadcast. She was word-perfect and professionally projected as a result of
this immense effort.
In the Commons yesterday, Mr Major dead-batted an attack on Mr Soames from
Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay, who asked: ``Can you tell us whether or not you
will tolerate the Minister of State for Defence continuing to act as the Prince
of Wales's butler?
``Can we have an undertaking that the Minister will not speak on constitutional
matters, which are the sole preserve of the Prime Minister? Will you sack the
Minister of State for Defence for speaking out of turn against the Princess of
Wales?''
The Prime Minister replied: ``I do not expect any more comments, Madam
Speaker.''
Earlier, another Labour back bencher, Mr Tony Banks, had asked Mr Major: ``Do
you agree with the words of Mr Soames that Princess Diana is in an advanced
state of paranoia?''
The Prime Minister said that he had no intention of getting drawn into any
comment.
Immediately after the princess's Panorama interview on Monday, Mr Soames went
on television to state that she seemed paranoic in her comments about the
establishment - which she also described as ``the enemy'' - being against her.
q.There was no little evidence of support for Mr Soames among Tory MPs. Mr
James Hill, secretary of the Conservative Constitution Committee, said the
Prime Minister was ``quite right'' to take the action he did.
Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, said: ``I am delighted the Prime
Minister has made this statement. To have the Government involved in any way
whatsoever in this difficult and complex situation does no good for anyone.
``Most of us have sympathy for the Princess of Wales and what she said.''

<TEXT>
Madrid, Thursday,
SPAIN'S Parliament today stripped a former Interior Minister and close ally of
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of his immunity so that the Supreme Court can
interrogate him on a 1980s ``dirty war'' on Basque Eta rebels.
In one of the worst blows suffered by Gonzalez in his 13 years in office,
Parliament voted to allow the top tribunal to question Jose Barrionuevo,
Interior Minister during the illegal 1983-87 campaign, as a suspect on charges
of kidnapping, misuse of public funds, and association with an armed band.
``I have nothing to say, beyond accepting the outcome and facing the
circumstances ahead, legally and politically,'' Barrionuevo told reporters.
The vote does not in itself disprove the government's assertion that it knew
nothing of the ``dirty war'', but it brings the charges closer than ever to
Gonzalez.
Far from distancing himself from his former superior, Barrionuevo described him
after today's vote as ``one of my companions and one of my friends''.
The premier, who has reluctantly promised an early General Election in March,
blames a huge conspiracy by dark economic forces for mounting accusations over
the anti-Eta campaign and a series of corruption scandals. The opposition
scorns the theory.
Barrionuevo was Gonzalez's first Interior Minister from 1982 until 1988, when
he took over transport and communications in a reshuffle coinciding with early
court inquiries into the campaign of bombings, kidnappings, and murders which
killed 27 people between 1983 and 1987.
The Supreme Court heard a former head of covert operations testify yesterday
that Spain's military intelligence service had provided arms, forged documents,
and crucial information to the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups (Gal) - a front
for security forces and hired gunmen.
Gal's campaign, most of which took place in southern France, was a war of last
resort aimed at ending the bloodshed by Eta (Basque Homeland and
Freedom).-Reuter.

in Bordeaux
THE BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, which is on tour in France, looks set to
be marooned in Bordeaux today by a 24-hour national transport strike.
The 72-strong orchestra - due to give a concert tonight - was to fly north to
Metz, near the German border, and set out for Bordeaux airport early this
morning, with no real idea if its charter plane would be able to take off, or
any guarantee of reaching the next destination in its two-concert tour.
Paris-based tour promoter, the IMG group, was in constant touch with the French
Ministries of Transport and Culture in a bid to find alternative routes and
methods of transport for the orchestra.
Last night, after a highly successful concert with percussionist Evelyn Glennie
in Bordeaux, BBC's head of music Hugh MacDonald announced to the orchestra that
the group would assemble early and go to the airport this morning.
``There is just a small chance that our plane might be able to take off,'' said
Mr MacDonald. ``We won't know until we get to the airport, but we really ought
to try.''

CONSERVATIVE councillors are insisting that disciplinary action against a
council accountant, who admitted doctoring a direct labour department's books
to make them look good, does not go far enough.
The minority Conservative group on Strathkelvin District Council feels that as
well as instituting disciplinary proceedings against Mr Alex McKenzie for
falsifying the accounts of the authority's Community Maintenance Services, a
report should be submitted to the procurator-fiscal.
The Conservatives are expected to push for this at a full council meeting next
week.
Councillor Ian Young, leader of the Conservative Group on Strathkelvin
district, declared: ``I've got reservations about the whole issue. In addition
to the disciplinary action, I want a report sent to the procurator-fiscal.
``I'm also concerned that the report has been collated, to a greater or lesser
extent, by people who were potentially culpable in allowing the situation to
arise. In so doing, they are being protected by the administration group who
for years have held up the CMS as a prime example of a direct labour
organisation.''
According to a council report, Mr McKenzie had admitted falsifying the accounts
in order to protect CMS and ensure it achieved its statutary 6% rate of return
for maintenance services.
The initial problem had arisen as a result of unexpected additional costs of
around #100,000 in respect of municipal trading contracts with Clydebank
District Council. These accounts had effectively been closed by the end of
1991/92 minus the additional costs which meant that these had to be ``lost''
during 1992/93.
It had also been established that certain other costs relating to purchases of
material and services had not been included in the correct years. Having
discovered the cost omission error, Mr McKenzie had decided to write the
balance of costs against 1992/93 trading.
However, this did not succeed because of reduced profit levels and the scenario
was carried on into 1993/94.
Consequently, CMS's results for the trading years 1991/92 to 1993/94 were
distorted by a final total of more than #246,000 arising from the
``fraudulent'' action taken by the accountant, plus nearly #71,000 arising from
accounting errors, giving a total of just over #317,000.
It was established that the falsification of income figures was effected by
arbitarily adding seemingly random amounts to genuine entries to achieve the
desired result.
Explaining his course of action to his superiors, Mr McKenzie said he had
perceived a distinct need to protect and support the organisation, especially
as the main problem contract was with another local authority.
While municipal trading was lawful, he had been aware of the Accounts
Commission's hostility to such trading and feared that a poor performance in
this particular contract might have provoked a prohibition order from the
commission which in turn would have had a detrimental effect on CMS's future
commercial viability.
Mr Michael Donohoe, a senior member of the Labour-controlled council, said the
council would take steps to address the problem and might possibly call for
further investigation.
q.THE Scottish Office said yesterday it had saved more than #10m on the
contracts for the by-pass linking Edinburgh to the M8 extension and the A74
extension.
A statement said that, under its Alternative Tendering Initiative, launched six
years ago by the Scottish Office Roads directorate, #8m had been saved on the
#40m M8 by-pass and #2.6m on the #13m A74 project.
The initiative allows contractors freedom to design and manage works - speeding
the resolution of difficulties.
The A74 Ecclefechan-Eaglesfield by-pass is being opened today by Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish Office Roads Minister. On December 11, he will
open the M8 extension (Claylands to Edinburgh city by-pass).

Colombo, Thursday
THE Sri Lankan army has cut off the rebel-held town of Jaffna, leaving no
escape route for an estimated 2000 Tamil tiger guerrillas holed up there, an
army spokesman said today.
Brigadier Sarath Munasinghe told a news conference: ``Tigers are trapped in the
town. They have to jump into the sea, bite cyanide, or surrender.''
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam usually carry a cyanide capsule to avoid
capture.
Munasinghe said troops had killed at least 100 rebels in heavy fighting, and
wounded more than 250. Seventeen soldiers were also killed, with five officers
and 88 soldiers wounded.
The capture of the Jaffna to Kandy highway - a supply lifeline - and a ban on
travel across the Jaffna Lagoon, a waterway used by civilians and rebels to
reach the mainland, had also helped tighten the army's grip on the rebel
capital, he said.
Earlier, officials said the army advance on Jaffna had been slowed, but not
stopped, by the fatal crash yesterday of a transport plane loaded with
troops.-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>`Gagging' teacher goes back to school Hotline set up for worried parents</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

A HEADTEACHER who gagged a chatterbox pupil with sticky tape has kept his job.
Mr Alex Christie, 46, will go back to work on Monday at the school in Central
Scotland where he assaulted a 10-year-old boy by wrapping tape around his mouth
in the classroom.
The reprieve was revealed yesterday by Central Regional Council.
An education authority spokeswoman said a special telephone ``hotline'' had
been set up for any anxious parents who wanted to discuss ``concerns'' about
the teacher's return to school.
Last night, the boy's father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ``I
am not making any comment until I have seen my lawyer.''
After the assault earlier this year, the boy's parents demanded that Mr
Christie be given the sack. They said then: ``We don't want that man anywhere
near our son again.''
Yesterday, the region's acting director of education, Dr Graeme Young, said a
disciplinary hearing had found the head teacher guilty of ``gross misconduct''.
He said: ``The education service held a disciplinary hearing to discuss Mr
Christie's case and try to make sure an incident like this does not happen
again.
``We found Mr Christie guilty of gross misconduct. He has been issued with a
final written warning, which will remain in force for two years, and cautioned
on his future behaviour.''
Dr Young added: ``In making this decision, we have taken into account Mr
Christie's long record of teaching with the school and the education authority.
``Mr Christie himself has assured us that he wants to put the incident behind
him and that he will do his best for the pupils at the school.
``We believe Mr Christie will use all his efforts to achieve this.
``In the interests of the pupils, we hope we can now consider this matter
closed and allow the school to return to normal.''
Last month, Mr Christie was put on ``probation'' by his profession's watchdogs,
the General Teaching Council.
The council's disciplinary committee branded his action as ``professionally
disreputable and foolish''.
Nevertheless, they left the door open for him to go back to the classroom by
deferring judgment for a year.
His career hinged on the decision by his employers, Central Regional Council.
Mr Christie was fined #350 at Falkirk Sheriff Court in June this year, after he
pled guilty to the assault.
Mr Christie had been suspended on full pay in February, when police launched an
inquiry into the primary classroom assault.
The court heard that the teacher taped the boy's mouth as a joke after the lad
kept talking instead of getting on with his school work.
However, procurator-fiscal Sarah Livingstone said: ``The joke went too far and
the youngster was humiliated in front of his pals.''
She added: ``Mr Christie was taking the class because the normal teacher was at
a funeral.
``The boy had been shouting out answers in response to various work in the
classroom.
``Mr Christie beckoned the boy out with his finger. He put Sellotape around the
child's mouth.
``It didn't completely cover the boy's mouth or nose but the boy had difficulty
breathing.''
The fiscal said the boy later told police that he was beginning to cry because
he was humiliated. ``He felt uncomfortable in front of the class who were
laughing at him.''
After five to 10 minutes, the headmaster helped the boy remove the tape.
In a statement to police, Mr Christie, head of the school for 12 years, said he
had done it as a joke. He said: ``The child was amused by it.''
His solicitor, Mr Stewart Neilson, said Mr Christie deeply regretted his
actions. ``It was foolish and wrong.
``He had no intention of causing any suffering, harm or distress to the child.''
Mr Christie said after the court hearing he would not comment until all
disciplinary procedures were complete.

AN 11-year-old boy charged with stealing more than #4657 from a locked safe
told a police officer his mother and his solicitor had advised him not to
answer any questions.
The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also swore at another police
officer shortly after he was arrested in Dundee on suspicion of stealing the
money, Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
He denies stealing the money from the safe at the Cocket Hat South Filling
Station in North Anderson Drive, Aberdeen, after opening it with a key in
January this year.
Detective Constable Laura McKay, 27, of Grampian police, told the court that
shortly after starting an interview with him, the boy pulled a piece of paper
out of his pocket. ``It stated, and I saw it: `On the advice of my solicitor
and my mother I am not prepared to answer any questions','' said DC McKay.
Earlier, the petrol station's assistant manageress, Marie Glennie, told the
court the boy had been found at the rear of the offices after his mother had
reported him missing.
The trial was adjourned until November 28.

<HEADLINE>Row over separate time zone for Scotland</HEADLINE>

A FRESH Commons row broke out yesterday over the prospect of Scotland being in
a different time zone from the rest of the country, and indeed the rest of
Europe. Dumfries, for example, could be on different time from Carlisle.
The idea was strongly attacked by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, who put
himself at odds with Mr John Butterfill, the Tory MP for Bournemouth West, who
is putting forward a measure to move the clocks forward an hour, bringing
Britain into line with Central European Time.
His proposal has topped the ballot for Private Member's Bills in the coming
session of Parliament, but last night Mr Forsyth argued it was unworkable and
could undermine the Union.
The effect of Mr Butterfill's proposal would be that if the sun rose in London
at 9am it would be at least 10am, or even 11am, in Scotland before children
could walk to school in daylight, farm workers could take to the fields in
daylight or construction workers could work without using floodlights.
Mr Butterfill's Bill may not become law, but the fact that he is first in the
ballot means that at least the subject will once again be raised in the Commons.
He told The Herald yesterday that the statistical evidence supported his
proposals, but he said that if Scots MPs tabled amendments against his plans he
would not stand in their way.
He questioned whether ``the whole of British time and the whole of how we run
should be dictated by crofters in the west of Scotland,'' and added: ``If
Scotland wants its own time, it would then be different from the rest of
Europe, but if Scottish MPs want to propose that on my Bill I would not oppose
it.''
Mr Butterfill, who claims to have support from organisations such as the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Accidents, the Police Federation, Age Concern,
the British Tourist Authority and the CBI, said there would be huge benefits
from what he is putting forward.
He claimed there would be 660 fewer deaths a year from road accidents because
there would be more light in the evenings, the benefit to tourism would be
about #1bn a year, and the reduction in road accidents would save health
authorities about #200m annually. ``There are other major reasons for this,
quite apart from the benefit to business,'' he said.
Mr Forsyth said: ``I would be very surprised if the Government gave such a Bill
the time of day, because the case for change has not been made.''
He claimed it would profoundly disadvantage Scots and was not something
farmers, in particular, would welcome. ``It is the sort of thing I would expect
to hear from a Scottish Nationalist, not a Conservative and Unionist.
``We are one United Kingdom and we do not want to be divided by a time zone. I
think if something is working and working well there is no need to fix it.''
Opinion among Opposition Scots MPs varied, but most were hostile.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said he personally was opposed to
the idea but recognised there would be a range of views within the Scottish
group. He said he had seen the statistical evidence, but was not persuaded by
it. However, Labour MPs would have a free vote on the Bill.
Scottish Labour MP George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) said he
would support the Bill. He realised Scots MPs were divided on the matter, but
he believed there was evidence that road accidents would be reduced by a change
to ``universal time.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Fife North-East MP Menzies Campbell said: ``We have
no party line on this, but my views on this issue are based entirely on the
interests of my constituency because the further north you are in Britain the
more disruiptive change would be.
``In a rural seat like mine, farming would be substantially inconvenienced and
school children who have to travel many miles to school by bus would have to do
so in the dark.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said he was concerned about Scottish children going to
school in the dark, and argued he would be happy to have a separate time zone
if it reflected ``geographic reality.'' He also said that if Mr Butterfill was
in favour of Scotland having its own time zone, perhaps he could extend that to
supporting Scottish independence in other areas.

A LOYALIST delegate at the Northern Ireland peace talks came to Scotland with a
gun, it was claimed yesterday.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that Mr Lindsay Robb lifted up a man's leg in a
Falkirk public house and placed what looked like a gun in a polythene bag under
his trouser leg.
Mr Michael Anderson, 23, told Mr Ian Bonomy, QC, prosecuting: ``It felt like it
was there for two minutes. Then he lifted my leg up again and took it back.''
Mr Anderson said Mr Robb had arrived from Northern Ireland on June 22 at Tam
Bain's public house in Laurieston, Falkirk, with fellow members of the
Craigavon Protestant Boys' Flute Band.
While they had gone by bus, Mr Anderson claimed that Mr Robb had come by plane.
However, Mr Anderson said Mr Robb had asked one of the band members to get his
bag out of the bus and he brought out what appeared to be a gun.
Mr Robb, 28, of Mournview Avenue, Lurgan Avenue, is one of six men on trial
accused of conspiring to further the cause of the outlawed Ulster Volunteer
Force by acquiring firearms, ammunition, and explosives, intending to endanger
life or cause serious injury to property in the UK or the Irish Republic.
They also deny trafficking in drugs to raise money for terrorism.
On trial with Mr Robb are: John Johnston, 49, of Campbell Crescent, Laurieston;
Francis Hives, 45, of Prescott Road, Liverpool; William McArthur, 42, of Ure
Crescent, Bonnybridge; David White, 23, of Northburn Avenue, Airdrie; and
Alexander Davidson, 23, of Greenhill Park, Lurgan, Northern Ireland.
Mr Anderson claimed Mr Johnston said he was going to Liverpool to ``see two
gangsters'' to get sub-machineguns and ammunition for the UVF.
Earlier, Special Branch detectives and tactical firearms officers told of a
surveillance operation on Mr Johnston and the two other Scots accused, Mr
McArthur and Mr White, who travelled by car from Falkirk to a Liverpool public
house.
On the return journey, the car was stopped in Airdrie by armed police. The jury
heard that the three men were hauled out at gunpoint.
The trial continues.

CHARGES to be levied by the new water authorities which take over council-run
services in April are causing concern at the Scottish Office.
Ministers are understood to have told the three new public authorities that
they will not sanction increases of more than 15% next year.
They have apparently decided that any larger rises in the first year of the
controversial new quangos would not be publicly acceptable.
The chairman of the new Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers' Council, Mr Dick
Douglas, has already warned that rises of 15% would be hard to justify.
Even if the rises were eventually pegged at 15%, increases of four or five
times the rate of inflation would be bound to provoke a damaging political row,
with the Government's opponents united in claiming that the services should
never have been removed from council control.
The threat to cap charges is also likely to worsen the extremely difficult
financial situation facing the water quangos, some of whose members and
officials are now complaining privately that the Scottish Office has seriously
underestimated the cost of changing over to the new regime.
The Herald understands that the East of Scotland Authority, based in Edinburgh,
has calculated that it actually needs an increase of around 25% in charges
compared to this year to meet its spending requirements. However, it also
recognises that such a huge increase would be unacceptable.
ESWA takes over water and sewerage services previously run by Lothian, Borders,
Fife, Central, and Tayside regions. It is known to be facing a serious lack of
funding in its first year and severe Government restrictions on the amount of
money it can borrow. Also, it cannot call on any reserves. These were spent by
the regional councils last year to keep down charges.
As a result it is believed already to face serious problems in carrying out
even essential parts of its planned capital spending programme.
Earlier this year, ESWA identified a shortfall of #300m in the total spending
plans of the outgoing regional councils over the next five years and the amount
of Government funding likely to be agreed.
Charges proposed by the three new authorities have to be approved by the
customers' council, which was set up to act as a public watchdog. Charging
schemes were originally due to have been submitted to the council by the end of
last month but have been delayed.
In the event of a confrontation between any of the new authorities and the
customers' council, the matter goes to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to be
resolved. At this stage, he would be expected to refuse any increase of more
than 15%.

Journey's end for Rosemary West as she arrives by prison van at Durham's
maximum security jail.
THE detective superintendent who headed the inquiry that led to Rosemary West's
conviction on 10 counts of murder yesterday warned other forces, including
Strathclyde Police, not to expect any assistance from her in investigations
into other possible killings.
``She is a prisoner and has the rights of a prisoner but she has never helped
this investigation from the first day,'' Detective Superintendent John Bennett
told a news conference. ``I can't see, in the short term, that she will help me
or anyone else.''
He can only hope that once appeal procedures have been completed, West might be
able to throw some light on investigations into other deaths.
In Scotland, it is possible that Fred West killed four young girls.
He had spoken of 20 additional victims in the Gloucestershire area before he
committed suicide in prison on New Year's Day.
Yesterday, Gloucestershire Constabulary made it clear there would be no fresh
diggings for bodies based on speculation.
However, it was equally obvious that the force fear that the remains of other
young girls lie buried somewhere in their area.
As Gloucestershire officers yesterday spoke about the investigation which began
on the suspicion that only Heather, eldest child of the Wests, might have been
buried at 25 Cromwell Street, Rosemary West was being transferred from
Winchester to Durham prison.
Police motorcycle outriders led the way as her van pulled out of Winchester.
The police driver and the officer who sat in the passenger seat wore
bullet-roof vests. In the back, Rosemary West was in a special cage with
officers sitting just outside but keeping a close watch on her.
She will be scrutinised 24 hours a day to ensure that she does not attempt
suicide. The prison authorities are well aware of Fred West's suicide note in
which he declared that he waited for her to join him and fulfil their promise.
In Durham, Rosemary West will renew an acquaintanceship with Myra Hindley.
The pair met when Rosemary West was sent there as the investigation into her
crimes proceeded.
It was a decision which infuriated her trial judge, Mr Justice Mantell.
Rosemary West and Myra Hindley are the only women in Britain who know that they
are likely to spend the rest of their natural lives in jail.
Yesterday, in Cheltenham, Chief Constable Tony Butler told journalists that,
despite speculation about other bodies, there was no evidence to support a
search for more remains.
He would await recommendations from Detective Superintendent Bennett about
future actions and would not be pushed into decisions based on media
speculation.
Mr Bennett said that following the police appeal concerning nine untraced girls
immediately after Rosemary West had been sentenced, information had come from
12 individuals. That, he said, was a reasonable response.
The police, he said, were seeking information on the nine girls who had been
linked to 25 Cromwell Street for the sake of completeness. Nevertheless, he had
good information on one of the nine girls. He would not elaborate on what that
meant.
His team alone still had more than 1000 further lines of inquiry of all
descriptions.
Rosemary West's solicitor joined in the criticism over the money being paid by
the press to witnesses.
What has not been disclosed is that, in the midst of the trial at Winchester, a
London-based tabloid newspaper put in a bid for her story. Had she been
acquitted, the money on offer was far in excess of anything that will be paid
to anyone as a result of this trial.

By ROBBIE DINWOODIE, Scottish Political Correspondent
THE SNP yesterday urged the Chancellor to stop ``victimising'' the Scotch
whisky industry and called on Labour to back its call for a 10% cut in duty as
a step towards equalising tax on drink.
The #7.37 taken by the Government on each #11 bottle of Scotch means that of
the eight billion nips downed each day the value of 5 billion are ``washed down
the Treasury's gullet,'' the SNP said.
Party business spokesman Fergus Ewing said Scotland had suffered the hangover -
``12,000 direct jobs have been lost, tens of thousands more indirect, and 40
distilleries have closed since 1979.''
The SNP's recent budget provided for a 10% cut in excise duty on spirits, which
would have cost a Scottish Exchequer up to #13m but boosted the industry.The
SNP figures were checked with the Scotch Whisky Association, which - although
it shies away from party politics - confirmed their accuracy.
The SNP implied tacit SWA support yesterday, and also disbursed, with
permission, nips of Macallan malt - again hinting at covert industry support
fuelled by growing frustration with the Government.

LAW chiefs yesterday threatened to ban the media from making payments to
witnesses in court cases in the wake of the Rosemary West trial.
The Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, has commissioned a high-level report into
cheque-book journalism after several witnesses in the case at Winchester Crown
Court admitted receiving up to #100,000.
Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell yesterday argued there was ``a strong
case'' for a change in the law.
Lawyers fear the lure of massive payouts may encourage witnesses to exaggerate
their evidence to boost its financial value.
Sir Nicholas told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that he was ``seriously
considering'' making cheque-book journalism illegal in court cases.
The newspaper watchdog, the Press Complaints Commission, announced on Wednesday
it would review the issue of payments to witnesses at a full meeting next week.
At least seven witnesses at the West trial admitted taking payments from the
media, ranging from #750 to a possible #100,000. There were allegations that
some witnesses were not called at all because of concerns that their evidence
would be undermined by the cash they had received.
The chief constable of Gloucestershire is preparing a report on media
involvement in the West trial which is to be sent to the Attorney General.
Sir Nicholas told Radio Four's Today programme: ``This case has seen more
buying up of witnesses' stories than we've seen for very many years. It does go
back to the Moors murders and since then in the Jeremy Thorpe case and in the
Yorkshire Ripper case there has been some incidence of it.
``But here we've got something like 20 incidents and it goes absolutely
contrary to the code of practice that was agreed by the newspaper industry
themselves.''
Both defence and prosecution lawyers had expressed concern over press buy-ups,
he said.
However, solicitor Christopher Murray, head of law at Kingsley Napley - a law
firm involved in the Jeremy Thorpe trial - said he would not ``be very
comfortable'' with a change in the law.
He told BBC Radio Four's World at One that ``as soon as you start to put
statutory legislative controls on the press, it is perhaps the first step down
the slippery slope.''
Top media barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC - who conducted an inquiry into the
commission's predecessor, the Press Council - denounced press self-regulation
as an ``utter fraud''.
He said: ``It is a confidence trick played by an organisation called the Press
Complaints Commission, which is funded by and acts entirely in the interests of
the media and the newspaper industry.''
Chief Constable Tony Butler, the man preparing a report on media involvement in
the West trial, told a Cheltenham press conference yesterday: ``My concern is
that the officers felt there was a sense of Russian roulette being played in
this trial.
``We were never sure that there was something that would not happen tomorrow
that would blow it out of the water. We should not have these anxieties.
``Are we running criminal justice as an entertainment business, or something
that the public has confidence in and that will deliver justice?''

YARROW Shipbuilders clinched a major new contract yesterday which will
temporarily safeguard the future of more than 100 jobs at their Glasgow yard.
A total of 415 redundancies were announced two months ago and the future of 315
workers still hangs in the balance as the company waits to hear if any other
orders are in the pipeline.
Yesterday's contract was for a 1500-tonne gas tanker hull for shipbuilders A&amp;P
Appledore. Work will start immediately at the Scotstoun yard and is expected to
be completed mid-1996.
Mr Murray Easton, Yarrow's managing director, said the contract came about as a
result of months of effort to reduce redundancies.
The results of tenders submitted for a contract to build three Type 23 frigates
are expected next month. Even if Yarrow wins the contract, Mr Easton said it
will not safeguard the future of the 315 workers.
``The contract will affect any future redundancies we may have to make in the
New Year,'' he said. ``But we are searching for work in the market and we have
lots of enquiries in that respect.''
A shop steward at Yarrow, who did not want to be named, said last night: ``The
news that we have got the Appledore contract has been welcomed by everyone at
the yard.''
Ferguson shipbuilders of Port Glasgow yesterday launched the third ship it has
built for an English ferry company and the fourth vessel it has launched this
year.
However, the company admitted that it is still trying to secure its first order
since the yard was taken over by millionaire businessman Frank Dunnet five
months ago.
The #8m ship Red Eagle was built for the Red Funnel Group and will be the new
flagship for the Southampton-Isle of Wight ferry operator.
Ferguson's made a pre-tax profit of #1.5m last year on sales of #19.3m.
Mr Dunnet described yesterday's launch as a highlight, because it was the first
since the takeover, and said he was delighted for Ferguson's workers ``who can
be proud of another splendid vessel''.
The new 500-tonne deadweight Raptor-class ship will join the Ferguson-built Red
Falcon and Red Osprey ferries, which entered service last year, when it does
likewise next March.

SB Holdings, the largest bus operator in Strathclyde, yesterday announced a
212% jump in pre-tax profits to #6.55m in the year to March 31.
The company was created by an employee buy-out of Strathclyde Buses from
Strathclyde Regional Council in 1993 and operates a fleet 1350 buses under the
banners of Strathclyde Transport, GCT, and Kelvin Central Buses.
The company doubled its profits despite an exceptional #1.1m charge relating to
its merger with Kelvin Central Buses 12 months ago.
Turnover was up 24% at #72.1m as passenger numbers continued to grow, but
before it can expand further it must settle the future of a controversial 20%
stake owned by Stagecoach.
The Perth-based bus group is resisting a Government order to sell the stake in
SB Holdings, which it purchased for #8.2m in December 1994.
The Board of Trade ordered the divestment in April after protests that
Stagecoach was infringing competition rules, but the case comes up for judicial
review in January.
SB Holdings is delaying decisions on future acquisitions or a possible stock
market flotation until the issue is resolved.
``We are in a position to pursue a number of alternative strategies but, until
we know how this (divestment ruling) turns out, it's hard to commit to any one
course,'' said executive chairman Peter Shaw.
``We are clear about our objectives, which are to enhance shareholder value
while taking account of the interests of our employees and customers,'' he
added.
Mr Shaw said, that if Stagecoach was forced to sell, SB Holdings would buy its
stake. The 20% share will not be sold to another minority investor.
SB Holdings has increased the number of passengers carried per year by 3% since
1986-87. That compares favourably to a 20% decrease in bus passengers
throughout the UK during the same period.
Mr Shaw attributed the company's success to the efforts and positive attitudes
of its 3700 employees, who own 80% of its shares.
SB Holdings has spent #9m on new buses over the last year and #16m has been
committed to purchases in 1996 to help modernise the fleet.
All its buses meet the latest European emission control standards. ``There is
no current requirement to conform to the Euro Two standards, but we thought it
was the best way to go,'' Mr Shaw said, adding that these would probably be
made mandatory in the future.

ABERDEEN manager Roy Aitken will celebrate his thirty-seventh birthday today
with one wish in mind - to upstage his one-time understudy, Dundee manager Jim
Duffy, once again.
The pair were rivals at Celtic Park for a central defensive role, but it was
Roy who emerged the winner.
Duffy, who will face his former adversary in the Coca-Cola Cup final at
Hampden, admitted: ``It was no contest really for that first-team place at
Celtic, more of a slaughter.
``Roy won hands down. Only twice did we ever play in the same team. He went on
to captain them as a teenager and win almost everything the game had to offer.
``But I was never envious of his achievements. Those sort of feelings can
destroy a person.
``I moved on from Parkhead to Morton and various other clubs and have enjoyed
my own magical moments.
``Never for a minute did I ever think we would meet up as rival managers at
Hampden.
``This is my first-ever national final and undoubtedly the highlight of my
career. I am very proud that I have managed to take Dundee to such an occasion
for the first time in 15 years.''
Aitken, who has led Aberdeen to Hampden after less than a year in charge,
added: ``I knew Jim at Parkhead, but we were never friends.
``He was a Glasgow boy whereas I was from Ayrshire.
``He has done exceptionally well at Dundee and I'm sure it will be a very
entertaining final for the fans.''
q PARTICK Thistle defender Steve Welsh's move to Lincoln City could be on the
verge of collapse.
The English third division side have agreed a #60,000 fee with Thistle, but
Firhill manager Murdo MacLeod refuses to release Welsh until he has found a
suitable replacement.
Last night, Lincoln manager John Beck warned he wasn't prepared to wait forever
to land his man. He said: ``The delay causes major problems for us. We agreed a
fee with the club and personal terms with the player and thought that was it."
q.LIBERIAN striker George Weah scored both goals as AC Milan beat Sparta Prague
of the Czech Republic 2-0 in the UEFA Cup third round, first leg in Italy last
night.
Weah's first came in 32 minutes when he headed home a Franco Baresi cross. He
added the second 14 minutes from time when he volleyed home a Marco Simone
cross.

Bill McLean describes the spectacular package which will accompany the
switch-on of Glasgow's Christmas lights
GLASGOW has never been a city to hide its light under a bushel, but Shine On
Glasgow '95, a visitor-attracting initiative on the part of the Glasgow City
Centre Association, will reveal the dear green place in all its glory when the
Christmas lights are switched on in George Square on Sunday.
Now in its second radiant year, the Shine On Glasgow campaign is being
sponsored by Coca-Cola, whose Alternative Christmas party earlier in the
afternoon before the switch-on ceremony, performed by Burgermeister Dr Pieter
Schnlein, the Mayor of Nremberg, will be a spectacular city centre occasion
to remember. Some of the country's top dance bands will be taking part, and joy
is likely to be unconfined.
Adding lustre to what promises to be a brilliant Sunday afternoon will be the
Parade of Light starting at around 4.30pm when almost 2000 participants from
local amateur, youth and community groups will process via the pedestrian
precincts of Sauchiehall, Buchanan and Argyle streets to the official switch-on
in George Square. Glasgow celebrates not only the 10th anniversary of its
twinning with Nremberg but also the second of enterprising Shine On in a
golden moment.
Instantaneously 20,000 colourful balloons will be released, fireworks will be
set off from the roof of the City Chambers and 850,000 glittering gold stars -
one for every man, woman and child in the city - will fall like snowflakes.
Colour and light will combine harmoniously to make Shine On Glasgow '95 with
Coca-Cola the most sensational civic Christmas event in the whole of the UK.
The Shine On Glasgow campaign receives funding from Glasgow City Council,
Strathclyde Regional Council and Glasgow Development Agency as well as the
private sector. In its second year its aim once again is to attract as many
visitors as possible to the city centre in the run-up to Christmas to do their
festive season shopping, with a four-week programme of entertaining events, and
exciting illuminated features.
From November 26, with a focus on Sundays, the main shopping streets will be a
great draw in themselves, offering a back-drop for entertainers and performance
art with visual works of light and sound.
Project director Alastair Wyllie said: ``There really is nowhere in the country
outside of London that compares to Glasgow in terms of shopping and
entertainment.
``Where else can you find the range of designer labels and quality merchandise
at such down-to-earth prices in one of the finest shopping environments in
Europe? The city's choice of hotels, restaurants, theatres and bars only
underlines what a great place Glasgow is to shop in - it really can't be
beaten!''
Throughout the Shine On programme three custom-built illuminated structures
will grace Glasgow's three city centre pedestrian precincts. At the corner of
Buchanan Street and Gordon Street a 17m steel Christmas Tree donated by British
Steel and British Steel Distribution will dominate the scene with choirs to
make it sing.
At the corner of Sauchiehall Street and Cambridge Street a giant Cuckoo Clock
designed by Steve Edgar will open its doors every 15 minutes to reveal a
circular stage where live performances will take place to delight passers-by.
In Argyle Street a 20ft orrery - a steel and mechanical sculpture of the
circulating planets and stars - designed by Jules Goss will add its seasonal
magic.
Neil Butler, director of Uz Ltd, the Shine On events and illumination producer,
said: ``Pre-Christmas Glasgow offers an excellent opportunity for local
performers and artists to promote their work and entertain the city and its
visitors. It is very satisfying to work in both the UK's Christmas shopping
capital and its events capital at the same time.''
The Parade of Light plays a significant part in the Shine On Glasgow '95 with
Coca-Cola proceedings. It involves close co-operation and participation among
local amateur, youth and community groups which have been working resolutely
together over the past three months. Costumes and floats have been created with
materials provided by Shine On, and design and build expertise and experience
by a dedicated group of community artists.
The volunteers come from unemployed workers' centres, community centres, youth
projects, after-school care programmes, women's groups and performing arts
groups. They will present a theme of shining light, bringing together images of
the sun, moon, stars and candle-glow, reflecting their light on the seasonal
elements of snow and ice. ``Pure, dead brilliant'' in Glasgow patois.
The big parade will be divided into sections led by 20ft-high constructions
depicting specific images of light. There will be visually striking costumes
and an ice-cracking sound from marching bands, and bands aboard the decorated
floats, highlighting the energy of this winter carnival.

MONKLANDS District Council last week notched up what is believed to be a UK
first - and certainly a unique event in Scotland - when its housing department
was presented with the prestigious Investors in People National Standard Award.
The award was handed over by Mr Tom Farmer, chief executive IIP (Scotland), who
is himself one of Europe's leading business figures, courtesy of his other
position as founder and chief executive of Kwik-Fit.
At a ceremony in Coatbridge, Mr Farmer made the presentation to representatives
of the housing department management team, including director of housing, Tom
McKenzie, housing convener Betty Leitch and senior housing officer, Joe Dewar,
who also acted as project manager during the run-up to the event.
Investors in People is an initiative with the express aim of raising the level
of commitment to training and development amongst employers, no matter their
field of operation.
The National Standard is based on the principle that employees' skills are a
major factor in the success or otherwise of any organisation and it identifies
commitment, planning, action and evaluation as key areas for assessment.
In some other businesses, such as manufacturing or distribution, these
standards, it could be argued, are not quite so difficult to attain. With
BS5750 or ISO 9002 in place, the daily routine is - or should be - a matter of
following a defined routine, with ready access to manuals whenever anything
unusual occurs.
But to attempt to apply the same standards to what is essentially a people
business, where every member of the public to visit an office has different
problems and varied expectations, elevates matters to a different plane
altogether.
Individual responsibility becomes vitally important in a decision making
process, and the old stalling tactics of I'll need to check that out, or can
you come back next week and see what Mr or Ms has to say? simply will not
suffice. Not if you want to reach IIP standard.
Monklands District Council Housing Department says it regards the award as a
vital part of its overall strategy and plans for future development. This is a
strategy that will come to fruition through the most effective training and
development of all personnel to meet their main aims and objectives - which
involve providing the best possible service to the department's tenants.
Its successes to date indicate that these efforts can produce positive results,
the bottom line being that IIP can be achieved through what it terms natural
communication from the top to the bottom of the chain.
Director of housing, Tom McKenzie, said at the ceremony: ``Through the total
commitment shown by all of the department's employees, we have demonstrated
that we have a highly trained, highly motivated workforce better able to serve
the needs of our tenants.
An equally jubilant Betty Leitch, housing convener, added: ``The housing
department's success follows two years of intensive work by everyone on the
staff and we are delighted to be the first to have reached this position.''
As senior housing officer, Joe Dewar is very well aware of what is required
when dealing with people on a one-to-one basis. He said of the award: ``As well
as helping with regard to staff training, motivation and morale, the winning of
this award also sends a clear signal to the people who are our tenants that the
council has been working very hard on their behalf, and that far from being the
end of the story, the process of continuous improvement remains in place, to be
fine-tuned as and where necessary.
Mr Dewar pointed out that Monklands District Council housing department
administers the letting of 21,000 houses, making it one of the largest public
sector housing providers in Scotland.
Recent improvements to this stock have resulted in 100% having some form of
central heating installed. Another 80% are double glazed, and 60% of
multi-storey blocks have been structurally improved, most having a concierge
service. A further eight blocks will shortly be upgraded to the same standard,
giving tenants better security, a quieter living environment and an enhanced
lifestyle.
Given the spectacular progress made over the past few years, perhaps this in
itself would have qualified the department for an award.

OUR overseas competitors used to regard British industry as something of an
anachronism when it came to the business of training and motivating staff. They
wondered how on earth we managed to survive in a competitive environment when
many of our training procedures owed more to the gaining of hands-on
experience, usually through costly trial and error, than by following a
carefully structured plan.
We in turn were faintly amused by the sight of German workers marching to their
machines at the start of each shift or the Japanese singing company songs and
spending part of their lunch breaks attempting to devise methods whereby
productivity could be increased and an advantage gained over the perceived
opposition.
But while we, quite rightly, continue to shy away from extremes, we have
conceded in recent years that what was once good enough for us is no longer
what will suffice for a greatly expanded market - or even for our own.
It was to help raise standards that the Investors in People initiative was
launched by the Department of Employment in 1990, and it started with the
express aim of raising the level of commitment to training and development and
increasing an awareness of its value among British employers.
So what is the real value of IIP? Perhaps its primary attraction is that it
offers an audit of existing training and development practices against a
national benchmark. It is always easier to measure progress when you have
something to aim for, a standard to reach, no matter how difficult it may
appear at the outset.
IIP has proved a useful tool in identifying those awkward gaps in training
programmes, the point at which people stopped and asked where now?
But in the case of Monklands District it also helped to encourage and motivate
staff at a time when sections of it, such as the housing department, were
already in the process of major change.
The IIP National Standard is based on the simple premise that the success of
any organisation depends to a great extent on the various skills of its
employees.
It then goes on to consider four general principles: commitment, planning,
action and evaluation. Taking each of these concepts, it adds assessment
indicators: six to commitment, seven to planning, six to action and five to
evaluation.
That makes 24 IIP indicators to be taken into account, which should already
dispel any notion that the achievement of IIP standard is simply a matter of
getting your head down and following a set of simple guidelines.
The department doesn't claim it was easy, but quite rightly feels that the
sense of achievement runs all the way through the various offices under its
roof. And this in itself, they would argue, is sufficient to justify the effort
required.

MONKLANDS District Housing Department's drive to IIP began in earnest in 1993
when external consultants were drafted in to carry out an in-depth survey of
staff attitudes.
The results were mixed. Staff generally saw themselves as being involved in a
task-oriented service which was good at achieving results, but there were areas
which caused some concern.
The prevailing level of staff morale, which was rated as being low, was the
most obvious worry. Employees in general showed signs of low self-appreciation
and considered there was both a need to alter management style and to improve
channels of communication.
It was hardly what the management team could have hoped to hear, but rather
than sweep the findings under the carpet and either forget the whole project or
employ another consultant in the hope that he would come up with a different
result, all of the findings were acted upon and remedies introduced. Management
weekends were arranged at which the way forward was charted and an action plan
drawn up for implementation.
Several working parties were formed, including a housing action team and a
communication working party as well as the appointment of an employee to attend
management meetings.
At the same time the IIP project manager, Joe Dewar, was involved in a
continuous programme of training and development, (training courses were made
available to all employees), and their parallel evaluation.
When it was felt that significant progress was being made in these areas a
second employee attitude survey was commissioned, this time with markedly
different results.
Some 88% of employees indicated that they now understood the aims and
objectives of their section. A similar number better understood the aims and
objectives of the department they worked in, and a hugely encouraging 92% said
they knew what was expected of them in their present role.
Similarly good results were achieved when employees responded to questions
relating to the department's aims and to whether improvements had been achieved
with regard to better services, operating efficiency, quality and customer
satisfaction.
Encouraging feedback was also received with regard to the department's record
in the provision of equipment and resources, investing in training and
implementing programmes and processes.
Perhaps best of all from the department's point of view were the findings that
91% of employees enjoyed the work they were doing, and 78% would recommend the
department as a good one to work for. And this bearing in mind that, by general
consent, such departments in any district council are by nature more subject to
customer-driven stresses than any others.
By now the department had put together a portfolio of evidence to support each
of the prescribed 24 IIP indicators, these ranging from the aims and objectives
of the housing department through employee appraisal schemes, minutes of
working parties and training plans to a complete evaluation of the department
in its development of its personnel.
It was a lengthy process, with a requirement for each part of the structure to
be examined in minute detail before the final appraisal by IIP administrators
took place.
Lanarkshire Development Agency had been charged with overseeing the entire
project, but assessing standards were IIP, with an external assessor from IIP
(UK) examining the organisation.
The inspector selected 33 employees from the personnel roll and embarked on a
two-day period of individual and group interviews.
The assessment of the portfolio of evidence and plan took another week and it
was then presented to the IIP recognition panel.
On September 29 Monklands District Council Housing Department became the first
in Scotland to be formally recognised by IIP.
Given its day-to-day workload it has to be rated a considerable achievement .
Joe Dewar, who was instrumental in taking the process from the idea stage to
implementation, says the ultimate beneficiaries will be the department's 21,000
tenants.
``Our role is to provide the very best service we can, with resources that are
necessarily limited. Having a motivated staff who take great pride in what they
do is an enormous help in this regard, he said.''

MONKLANDS District Council Housing Department currently employs 265 people, 173
staff and 92 manual workers.
Earlier this year it went through a restructuring process which saw it with
four offices covering Coatbridge North, Coatbridge South, Airdrie North and
Airdrie South, each administering around 5000 properties.
One of the most important benefits here from a tenant's point of view was the
creation of a one-stop inquiry service, meaning the end of waiting in three
different queues or - worse still - different offices, to get the answer to
several questions.
A recent poll of tenants in the area showed that most felt that there was still
room for improvement, a narrow majority (47%) claiming to be generally
dissatisfied with the service they received from the housing department, while
45% claimed to be generally satisfied.
Areas for concern centred on repairs, capital improvements,
security/anti-social behaviour and estate management (gardens).
The housing department intends to get to grips with these concerns by
continuing the decentralisation process, giving staff a wider remit, setting up
a new complaints procedure, establishing tenant panels and providing an
improved information and advice service.
These objectives are being pursued despite the fact that even bigger changes
are on the way.
Next April 1, the housing departments of Monklands, Motherwell, Cumbernauld,
Kilsyth and part of Strathkelvin will merge, giving North Lanarkshire around
63,400 houses, 53% of the total North Lanarkshire housing stock and making it
second only to Glasgow in terms of size.
Staff numbers will climb to 530 full-time and 50 part-time and the combined
budget will be #167m, including #83m revenue and #36.6m capital.
All of this means more headaches in store. Each merging authority apparently
has a different housing allocation policy, Monklands and Motherwell favouring a
date of application/category scheme while Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Strathkelvin
use a points-based system.
There is also the fact that none of the other areas has either the same
percentage of homes with central heating or - in the case of Motherwell - such
a high proportion of refurbished multi-storey blocks, so some earnest budget
discussions will have to be implemented.

ONE weakness of Scottish athletes in recent years has been a reluctance to test
themselves against England's best, either through lack of ambition, fear of
failure, or simply fear of blowing a hole in the pocket.
Glen Stewart has had to endure some criticism since rejecting selection for an
international at Margate earlier this month. Tomorrow, however, he plans to
race twice in the Safeway international meeting at Gateshead.
Last year, Andrew Pearson won both the 1900 metres event for track athletes and
also the 3500m international event. Tomorrow Racing Club's Stewart will have
just 30 minutes between the two, and the chance to put some outstanding
Scottish performances into perspective.
The short race includes English internationalists Matthew Yates, Adrian Passey,
and Darren Spawforth, plus his Scottish clubmate Frank McGowan, Ian Gillespie
(Birchfield), Chris Robison (IBM Spango Valley), and Gary Brown (Falkirk).
Pearson, top Briton at this year's world cross-country, contests only the
longer race, because he heads the UK team for the European championships a week
tomorrow at Alnwick.
Other Scots with the possibility of high placings include Clydesdale's Des
Roache, who runs in the junior event, and Kilbarchan's Robert Quinn, over 6900m.
q CHANGING for Bellahouston's meeting on Sunday is at Cartha Rugby Club.
Declarations from 11am.

THE infuriating journey of Roddy Frame around the margins of genius continues.
Much as his entire recorded output has teetered on greatness before taking one
of its innumerable diversions, cul-de-sacs or hiatuses, it is hard to tell from
Aztec Camera's current live show quite where Frame's head or music is at in
1995.
There are contradictions everywhere: Frame's last three albums have seen him
veer from r&amp;b to punk to more laid-back soundscapes, and before that Dylan and
Knopfler seemed to be his major influences. Now, with a new album, Frestonia,
which contains some of his best songs in 10 years, he has the chance to shine.
He merely glitters round the edges.
The main complaint is the show's apparent complacency. The band, for all their
ability, do little to augment or accentuate either the tenderness in Frame's
lyrics or his wistfully soulful vocals.
After they have bludgeoned their way through Black Lucile, it comes as some
relief to see Frame don his acoustic for Boy Wonders but it fares little
better: another leaden version of a timeless song.
Admittedly Spanish Horses and Pillar to Post fare better, and the wholly
acoustic interlude does much to redress the balance in favour of Frame's
songwriting talent.
Method of Love, Sun, and Rainy Season are all fine adverts for his recent work,
where the songs are given ample breathing space, but his reliance and in some
cases destruction of his back catalogue will do little to entice his audience
into buying the new album.
Much as the set still contains more than its fair share of brilliant songs,
Frame's muse seems to have become steadily more erratic with age. The hope
remains that one day Frame will do something wholly rather than partially (like
this show) great.

SPECIAL travel arrangements have been made to make Glasgow easily accessible
during the four-week programme. ScotRail, for example, is offering a 25%

Record prices for top
quality spring barley
EXCELLENT weather conditions this year saw many spring barley growers achieve
record prices.
Most spring barley was combined in exceptionally good conditions and grain
quality was rated superb in South-east Scotland with low nitrogen and excellent
grain size. A high proportion of the crop made the malting grade with the main
varieties - Chariot, Derkado, and Prisma - all yielding above average.
Malting barley was attracting a premium of #42.66 over feed prices which
averaged #102.75 a tonne.
Speaking after the judging of the National Malting Barley Competition for
Scotland, Robin Pirie, of Pauls Malt, Newmarket, said record tonnages had
accompanied record prices. ``So far, the malting industry has bought more than
750,000 tonnes of spring barley in Scotland, compared with 685,000 tonnes last
year,'' he said.
During the harvest some 60,000 tonnes were sold for export. In UK terms,
400,000 tonnes were exported from a total supply of 1.5 million.
The good summer also resulted in more demand for malt from the lager industry,
Mr Pirie said.
The malting barley competition, organised by the Institute of Brewing, was won
by Marcus Findlay, of Pitcox Farm, Dunbar. His winning sample of Derkado had
been entered by Hugh Baird and Sons of Pencaitland, who hosted this year's
judging at Pencaitland Maltings.
Runner-up was Hamilton Farmers of East Linton, again with a sample of Derkado,
entered by IM Cowe &amp; Co, of Edinburgh.
The Tayside, Fife, and Central regional winner was David Arnot, of Hatton Mill,
Arbroath, with Camargue. Highland and Grampian winner was JM Fraser, of Lethen,
Nairn, with Prisma.
The competition, now in its eighteenth year, is designed to encourage the
production of malting barley of the quality required by the distilling and
brewing industries at home and abroad. The winners will receive their awards in
London in the new year.

THE world championship will continue to be shown on terrestrial television
after the sport's governing body yesterday announced a five-year deal with the
BBC.
The agreement means the BBC have retained the rights to broadcast the event,
along with three other leading tournaments, until the year 2001.
The new deal, which starts from season 1996-97, also covers the Royal Liver
Assurance UK Championship, Benson and Hedges Masters, and the Grand Prix
Championship.
Jonathan Martin, head of BBC Sport, said: ``This new contract means the many
millions of viewers, who remain keen snooker fans, will still be able to see
the world's best players compete in the most prestigious tournaments into the
next century.
``We are delighted to maintain our links with a sport which continues to hold
such a wide appeal, particularly the world championship, which is firmly
established in the portfolio of top sporting events.''
The BBC's coverage of the Royal Liver Assurance UK Championship at Preston
begins tomorrow.
q.ENGLAND'S David Lilley reached the final of the world amateur championship in
Bristol yesterday when he defeated No.1 seed Rom Surin, of Thailand, by four
frames in their best-of-15 semi-final. He will meet Thailand's Sakchai Sim-Ngam
in the best-of-21 frame final. The Thai beat London 16-year-old David Gray 8-4.

EXACTITUDE is all when you're assembling a bible. That's why there's a six-page
style guide for each contributor to the newly-launched six-volume second
edition of the Guinness Encyclopaedia of Popular Music. Grandly sub-titled
Amended Version XVIII, the guide offers considerably more than ten commandments
on the proper annotation of rock and pop.
Thou wilt give neither hyphen nor capital letters to country rock, although
country and western shalt abbreviate to C&amp;W. Thou shalt distinguish between
b-sides and T-shirts. Covet ye not greatest-hits compilations when thou
compileth discographies.
Rock'n'roll raciness? Just the one inadvertent bit: ``the term rock `n' roll
should be written with inverted commas in the 69 position.'' Oo-er.
More importantly, Guinness compilers must heed a host of rigorous prohibitions.
Bangeth ye not on about chart positions. No wild-eyed opinionating - reflect
the critical consensus! Above all, servants of the Guinness encyclopaedia must
eschew lazy rock-hackisms.
I am thus unable to describe Guinness editor Colin Larkin as having cracked the
charts or scored a hit with a tome which offers a plethora of facts. Helmed by
Larkin, the book is no cheesy organ.
This po-faced air of pop-picking nit-pickery is, however, misleading. Let us
record the truth that Colin Larkin smiles a great deal in his north London
office, pulsing with a palpable love for music and the minutiae of its making.
He jokes zestfully at the ridiculousness of the unending task he's set himself
and his select band of fact-checkers and their ever-expanding data-bases.
Whence does his passion spring? Larkin recalls precisely. From falling in love
as a child in 1953 on the Dagenham council housing estate where he was raised.
``It was hearing Guy Mitchell's She Wears Red Fathers - brackets - And A Huli
Huli Skirt, close brackets. On the Columbia label.''
Larkin embraced artier forms of rockaboogie music in his teenage years, yet in
one crucial respect he stayed true to the working-class origin of his love for
twang'n'thump.
``I developed a real chip on my shoulder about rock and pop not being accorded
the respect given to `serious' musical forms.''
Having begun his own publishing business, Larkin became obsessed with
establishing a rock and pop version of Grove's, the authoritative guide to
classical music. Against a fraught background of home-remortgagings and marital
disintegrations, he succeeded. So much so that this year the US publishers of
Grove's decided to distribute Larkin's Guinness work in America.
``They came to us, having decided not to do their own version, having accepted
us as the definitive work.''
Larkin's four-volume first edition, published in 1992, sold almost 5000 copies
at #195. ``Erring on the side of caution, I actually predicted less demand for
the second edition, around 3000. In fact, we sold all 3000 copies in the first
week of publication, and are confidently expecting sales of 6000.''
At #295, it's predominantly a music-industry purchase. ``Jools Holland carries
the books everywhere on a special leather strap. He's on his second set of the
initial edition, someone having stolen the first lot. He quotes us on telly on
Later With Jools Holland. It is gratifying to be acknowledged.''
Not everyone is as honest. Larkin was miffed to see most of Jerry Garcia's
Fleet Street obituarists pilfering his book. ``Hacks all re-writing the same
entry for cash. Very sad. And frightening. The power we have. Our
responsibility to get things right.''
Because mistakes are always noticed. Popsters love their heroes, well-kent or
not, with a ferocity which can manifest itself in heated missives. Woe betide
any pop encyclopaedia that misidentifies the birth-date of Syd Gubbins, of Syd
Gubbins and His Gub'nors fame.
``An angry Rare Earth fan wrote in berating us most horribly for having missed
out three of their albums, and for having mis-spelt one group-member's name.
``He was right to complain, but people often don't appreciate the nature of our
task. We have no malice. We don't go to town on the acts we loathe.
``Unfortunately, however, we're perceived as dull, boring pen-suckers. I reply
politely to all the letters we get, patiently thanking the writer for having
spotted any errors and assuring them we will rectify them - and add the
writer's name to our list of acknowledgements. Sometimes, though, I'd love to
employ the same abusive tone as the complainer.''
Of course, it's not only fans who write in. Jack Bruce volunteered his own
obituary. And orchestral arranger Martin Ford wrote in very pleasantly,
pointing out that, contrary to his first-edition entry, he hadn't actually
faded into relative obscurity over 20 years ago. He had in the interim made
contributions to chart-topping albums by Phil Collins, Paul McCartney, Elton
John, Bryan Ferry, and Harry Nilsson, to name but a few.
Ignorance: the encyclopaedia-editor's ultimate failing. Larkin laughs a
terror-stricken laugh as he recalls Martin Ford's reasoned reproach.
It contrasted strongly with that of one member of free-thinking folk-rockers
the Oyster Band, who wrote a series of inexplicably truculent letters which
culminated in a threat of legal action if all mention of their career wasn't
expunged from the Guinness book.
Larkin complied. Now under the second edition's heading Oyster Band, the
there's simply a sentence explaining the band's decision, an erroneous one
which makes them look silly and sad.
Mistakes, mistakes. They happen. Larkin shudders. ``We wrote about Steve Race
in the past tense, which is potentially sue-able.''
Indeed, the Guinness contributors' list has been drastically pruned since 1992,
reduced from 82 to 26, with a nucleus of 14. ``Inability to adhere to house
style,'' Larkin hisses, shaking his head.
Heck, but there's an up-side, too. Doors opening backstage at the Hammersmith
Odeon where Larkin was given a hug and a sweaty plectrum by one of his heroes,
BB King. Lost guitar-hero Peter Green, well again, wandering into Larkin's
office one Monday afternoon a few weeks back with news of his re-born career.
``And we took a stand at the Midem music festival where I met Jac Holzman, the
man who founded the Elektra label and discovered the Doors. And publisher Del
Bryant came along and quietly read the entry for his mum and dad, Felice and
Boudleaux, the creators of the Everly Brothers' hits...... and as he read it, I
saw a tear run down his face.
``When he'd finished, he just said: `OK.' That was rather special.''
Just like Colin Larkin's good book, by Guinness goodness. It's the gospel. Amen.
The world of popular music has been condensed into a new six-volume guide.

BRAWLING Blackburn stars Graeme Le Saux and David Batty face a carpeting from
manager Ray Harford today after their astonishing fight during the European
Champions' League defeat in Moscow.
But while Harford has indicated the two England men face disciplinary action -
with both likely to be landed with fines of two weeks' wages - it is probable
their punishments will not be made public.
Harford and his squad refused to comment further on the affair when they
arrived back from Russia yesterday.
But chairman Robert Coar gave a brief, official response to the amazing scenes
he had witnessed in the Luzhniki Stadium, a game missed by millionaire owner
Jack Walker and Kenny Dalglish.
``The club is disappointed with the incident,'' said Coar. ``Ray Harford will
sit down with the players tomorrow. If disciplinary action is deemed necessary,
it will be carried out.''
Whatever punishment Rovers hand out to the two players, who had to be separated
by skipper Tim Sherwood, Henning Berg, and Colin Hendry when the punches were
flying, it seems unlikely it will be the end of the matter after the Football
Association urged UEFA to investigate.
FA spokesman Steve Double said chief executive Graham Kelly had authorised a
letter sent to UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, asking the European
game's governing body to act - which could lead to European bans for both
players.
`We are very concerned at what happened in Moscow,'' said Double. ``Something
must be done and we want it to be done.
``We cannot do anything as the game was not under our jurisdiction. It is up to
UEFA to act as they see fit but they have the power to charge players under the
code of unsporting behaviour.''
Unlike the FA, UEFA are reluctant to accept video evidence of incidents on the
field of play, and a spokesman said no action could be considered until they
had received the reports from Italian referee Pierluigi Pairetto, and the
Danish official delegate.
Certainly the Batty-Le Saux fight was an embarrassment for the 250 Rovers fans
who braved the near-arctic conditions to watch a match of only academic
importance.
Supporters flying home admitted a sense of shame, and Rovers legend and former
England captain Ronnie Clayton, still an Ewood Park regular, spoke for many of
them.
``I just could not understand it,'' said Clayton. ``It cannot do anyone any
good and the club will need to act.''

FAIRGROUND or madhouse? Therapist or murderer? Lunatic or lone voice of reason?
What makes a tale like The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari so abidingly fascinating
is the way it plays sleight of plot with truth and illusion. Just as you think
you know, for sure, who's to be trusted and who is the manipulative maniac -
the situation spins one more time and, like an Escher drawing, you're left with
a trick perspective where water falls up and stairways never come down to
earth. Nothing, no-one, can be taken at face value here.
Visually, this Arches version of the story effectively suggests an
out-of-kilter time and place without following slavishly in the surreal
imprints of the German silent film. Instead of wildly drunken angles and
oversized furniture, there's a grim rookery of doors and crannies that
compresses all the action into one claustrophobic enclave.
Murders are sudden silhouettes against upper blinds, while down below - in
faded costumes of black, white, and occasional red - the fairground continues
its freakish dumb shows. A twitching aside of various veils - and the place is
an asylum where Caligari and his somnambulist slave, Cesare, are part of
another freakish ploy.
Where things come adrift is in the text and its delivery. Andrew Dallmeyer's
device of using blank verse as a means of conveying the heightened pitch of
expressionism really needs a more pointedly stylised delivery than the cast
give at present. There really needs to be a chilling sense of something
extraordinary, strange and estranging, in the way even ordinary words strike
our ears.
As it is, we have to rely on Derek McCluckie's Cesare - with make-up that would
do justice to Nosferatu, if Andy Arnold does decide to do that one - to give us
the thrill and the sense of weirdness that haunts the film but doesn't
sufficiently haunt this staging.

<HEADLINE>tale of three bridges tolls for thee</HEADLINE>

On the day they hoisted the first of the massive chains supporting the Menai
Bridge in north Wales, friends who went looking for the engineer to
congratulate him found him on his knees engaged in prayer.
Thomas Telford, the son of a Scots shepherd, was giving thanks for the success
of one of his greatest engineering achievements, and possibly adding a plea
that it might endure as a monument to his vision and skill.
If that were the case, his supplication was heard. Some 170 years after it was
built, his handsome suspension bridge with its twin piers of rough-hewn stone
is still standing, and carrying more traffic than ever between the Isle of
Anglesey and the Welsh mainland at Bangor. Apart from providing a lifeline to
the island, it is beautiful to look at. A slender structure extending from a
wooded hillside, it spans 580ft to an island village named after it with lofty
grace.
Local folk regard it with the kind of pride and affection Scots profess for the
Forth Railway Bridge. It features on paintings and coffee mugs in island shops;
if the Welsh made shortbread, it would be on the tins.
It has the additional attraction, as critics of the Skye Bridge have pointed
out, of being free of tolls. Skye and Lochalsh councillors have indicated they
may cite it in a legal challenge to the tolls, based on the 1707 Act of Union
between England and Scotland which states that taxes must be the same across
the two countries. Telford's construction, they believe, established the
precedent of toll-free bridges.
Unhappily, that is not the case. A Herald investigation has discovered that
anyone who wished to cross the Menai Bridge on the day it opened, and for years
afterwards, was required to pay a penny. The charge for a mule or an ass was
twopence, for a drove of oxen, cows or ``neat cattle'' a shilling per score,
and for a stagecoach 2/6d. History does not record any protest demonstrations,
although tolls continued to be collected until 1940.
Elizabeth Jones, who runs a bookshop in Menai Bridge village, vaguely remembers
her parents complaining about paying to cross the bridge. ``I can't imagine
what it would be like if they imposed the tolls again,'' she says. ``A lot of
people rely on the bridge to get to work in Bangor every day. It would be
awful. I don't think people would accept it.''
There is no suggestion of tolls returning to Menai, but reports of charges on
the Skye Bridge have reminded the residents of Anglesey how fortunate they are.
``There's a lot of sympathy here for the people of Skye,'' Jones says. ``We
know how they must feel. It seems terribly unfair.''
It is a common sentiment on the island, which like Skye retains an independent
spirit despite its technical attachment to the British mainland. Sue Davis, who
manages a bistro perched on the island side of the bridge, says she would
object vigorously to paying tolls. ``It's still Wales on the other side, and
we're all Welsh after all,'' she says. ``I don't know how they put up with it
on Skye, it's almost like they are being segregated.''
A measure of the islanders' resistance to such impositions was when the
authorities installed parking meters in the village a couple of years ago. The
locals promptly sealed them with super-glue, and a desultory war of attrition
between repairmen and the saboteurs is still going on.
There is, of course, a price to pay for maintaining the bridge, but Gwynedd
County Council on the mainland is happy to meet the expenses from public funds.
Wynne Jones, its assistant director of highways, takes the view that the bridge
is a vital public service which should be financed by local taxpayers.
It has required strengthening over the years with new chains and girders,
painting it is an on-going job, and the two-lane roadway was recently
resurfaced with waterproof membrane at a cost of #250,000. Jones estimates
general maintainance at about #1m every five years, but he reckons it is money
well spent.
``I think it's enough to pay your road fund licence without having to pay
transport tolls on top,'' he says. ``The problem is this Government seems
hell-bent on private enterprise, regardless of the cost.''
There are other similarities between Skye and Anglesey - both are essentially
rural communities dependent on farming and seasonal tourism. However Telford's
bridge is no longer the only road link over the Menai Straights. In 1977 a road
deck was added to a nearby railway bridge, which now carries most of the heavy
commercial traffic on a Euroroute to and from the ferry terminals for Ireland
at Holyhead. But the original bridge is still favoured by local traffic,
amounting to an estimated 14,000 vehicles a day.
Its admirers include Meurig Owen, a committee clerk on the island borough
council and local historian. ``Once upon a time,'' he recalls, ``if there was a
serious crime committed on Anglesey the first thing the police did was block
the bridge, then they'd say `that's the front door shut'.
``When you think about it, it's a marvel it's lasted so long and coped with
modern traffic. It's done well up till now, very well indeed.''
At the opposite corner of Wales, a very different public attitude is developing
towards a more modern bridge. The #330m River Severn Bridge, due to be
completed next April, will be the longest in the UK and one of the longest in
Europe. With an overall length of more than three miles, it is designed to
carry up to 27 million vehicles a day between Avon and Gwent, thereby relieving
intense pressure on an existing bridge two miles to the north.
It is badly needed to service high-tech industries which have proliferated
along the so-called M4 corridor in south Wales following the demise of the coal
mines, and to improve access to channel ferries for commercial traffic from
Wales and Ireland.
All this, it will assuredly do. The only problem is that, like the Skye Bridge,
it was conceived under the Government's private funding initiative - which
means it will be a toll bridge. Not only that, but as part of the deal the
consortium building it has acquired the existing bridge which opened 30 years
ago and sharply increased the tolls on it. So anyone driving to south Wales
from the West Country will have to pay more than ever for the privilege, unless
they are prepared to make lengthy detours.
The result is a growing protest movement, with motorists being urged to boycott
the bridges, and Swansea city councillors suggesting that lorry drivers mount a
French-style blockade of the crossings. The more moderate reaction of the
Freight Transport Association has been to petition the Government for
concessionary tolls.
The issue is complicated by a system of tolling in only one direction - on
entering Wales. To improve traffic flows, no tolls are charged on leaving the
country. As a result, an estimated 1000 commercial vehicles a day heading for
Wales make a detour around Gloucester and through the Forest of Dean, to the
intense annoyance of local residents. One supermarket distribution centre on
the Welsh side, serving the West Country and the Midlands, reckons it is saving
#200,000 per annum by instructing its drivers to avoid the Severn on their
return to Wales.
Yet despite recent increases, the tolls are still substantially lower than
those of the Skye Bridge. It now costs motorists #3.80 and lorry drivers #11.50
to cross the Severn both ways, while standard one-way charges at Skye are
between #4.30 and #5.20 for cars depending on season, and #9.80 to #25.40 for
goods vehicles. Even with a book of 10 tickets, a private motorist ends up
paying #4.88 for a two-way crossing.
The explanation is simple - a great many more people cross the Severn than Loch
Alsh. While the Skye Bridge hopes to attract 500,000 paying customers a year,
the operators of the new Severn Bridge expect more than 20 million. On this
basis, they should pay off their debts and presumably make a tidy profit within
their concessionary period of 30 years, after which both bridges revert to
public ownership. The rationale here, as on Skye, is that the bridges should be
paid for by the people who use it.
Norman Haste, the project director for the new bridge, is justifiably proud of
the achievement, and pleased that it has attracted 40,000 visitors for lectures
and tours of the construction site since work began four years ago. ``It may
sound twee, but one of my personal campaigns on this job was to bring civil
engineering closer to the people it serves,'' he says.
Hostility to the tolls is thus a disappointment, but Haste insists there is
little the consortium - led by John Laing Construction and GTM-Entrepose of
France - can do about it. ``We have to raise financially viable tolls to pay
back our lenders in a reasonable period of time, and we have no freedom to
adjust the tolls to suit ourselves. They are engraved on tablets of stone in
the Severn Bridges Act, and can be changed only by a movement in the retail
price index.''
The construction industry is seriously concerned about such restrictions,
according to Haste. ``While we are prepared to accept Government policy on
private funding quite willingly, and the risks that go with it, we would like
to see greater flexibility in operating such schemes. We cannot, for example,
offer discounted tolls to attract customers, and strict controls leave little
room for innovation in design and financing. Public accountability is rightly
important, but where private companies are taking commercial risks they should
have greater flexibility in dealing with them.''
Such views are shared by Frank Cook, the regional director of the Freight
Transport Association in Bristol, whose members regard the tolls as highway
robbery. Cook says it recently commissioned a study which indicated that a
relatively small concession of around 10% would pay for itself through
increased customers. ``On this basis, we're calling on the Government to
reconvene a meeting with the bridge company that began last January, at which
it said it would consider sympathetically any proposals for discounts that fell
within the existing concession agreement.''
Compared with the higher charges and fewer options for residents of Skye,
however, the people of south Wales are getting a better deal. Neil Jones,
business editor of the Western Mail in Cardiff, agrees and says most locals
have adopted a philosophical attitude. ``Tolls have been charged on the first
Severn Bridge since the start, so we Welsh are used to them. It seems curious
they only operate one way, but I suppose we have to expect to pay for the
privilege of entering Wales.''
Regrettably, the days of stagecoaches trundling over marvels of Victorian
engineering for 2/6d are long gone.

EVERY year as the Budget draws near an avalanche of paper descends on the
luckless Chancellor. Somewhere in the Treasury, I imagine there must be a very
large room and, as the great day approaches, the piles of recommendations,
submissions, suggestions, and complaints remorselessly grow towards the ceiling.
It is not just from such quarters as industry, chambers of commerce, trade
unions and trade associations, economists and the Economist, companies large
and small, charities and the like that all these helpful offerings come.
Newspapers feel that their readers will be shortchanged if they do not also
contribute to this great national festival of advice.
It is a game where - as with the National Lottery - a very modest and
superficial numeracy is the only qualification required to play. Unlike the
lottery, however, there are no real losers. If, by complete coincidence, the
Chancellor actually follows your advice, you have won. If he does not, then you
have the warm satisfaction of knowing that you were right and he was wrong. In
such circumstances, I was delighted to be asked to write this article, and
contribute my own advice to Mr Clarke.
The first self-evident proposition about all Budgets is that they must
reconcile political and economic demands. On the rare occasions when the
political and economic weather is simultaneously balmy, the Chancellor is a
lucky man and this task is not so very testing. Today, with a General Election
rapidly approaching, and with the opinion polls showing his Government held in
extraordinarily low public esteem, the Chancellor is placed in a most
unenviable position. But he is a throughly capable and clear-thinking man, with
a robust attitude. How should he react - and how will he react - in the face of
such problems?
Clearly the emphasis of his Budget must be to address political demands. He
must, however, show great care in the way in which he does this. Otherwise our
low rate of inflation which is a hard won and invaluable prize could easily be
jeopardised by imprudent actions. Second, the foreign exchange markets are
nervous and fragile.
Whatever he does, the Chancellor must also avoid any market perception that he
has acted rashly. Any sustained fall in sterling, as a market reaction, would
have direct repercussions on inflation quite apart from other undesirable
consequences. Moreover, given the electoral timetable, such inflationary
consequences would be likely to feed through with the worst possible timing
from a political point of view.
We should ask ourselves what these political demands really are, and then how
far the Chancellor can go towards meeting them while avoiding the penalties
which inflation and the loss of market confidence would impose.
In political terms, the Chancellor should direct his action at the middle
section of taxpayers. That is where elections are won. The upper echelon of
taxpayers, in spite of their grumbling, will mainly vote for his party in any
event, and the lower echelon generally will not, so there is little political
mileage in doing anything significant in those particular directions.
As to the specific tax cuts he should make, the choice will surely be dictated
more by the need to meet fixed perceptions than by reality. The fixed
perception in the minds of most people is that tax is higher or lower depending
on whether the standard rate of income tax moves up or down. The fact that the
overall tax burden on the middle band of taxpayers has increased considerably
since 1992 through changes in allowances and National Insurance is an
interesting subject for the fiscally sophisticated. To the voter it is the
standard rate which matters.
Mr Clarke will reduce it for the best political reasons. It is also pretty
clear that he has headroom for a meaningful reduction, without severely
prejudicing his overall financial position, and undermining market confidence.
Incidentally, what the markets will be watching for is whether the general
shape of his budget seriously prejudices his longer term policy of reducing
public borrowing.
Just as the perception of high or low tax is so specifically linked to the rate
of income tax so, for a great number of people, the perception and indeed the
reality of their own wealth is inextricably linked to the housing market, and
the value of their home. The fall in house prices, negative equity in mortgaged
homes, the fear and reality of repossession, and the like have surely been the
largest influences in political disillusionment with the Government.
There are dangers, however, in attacking this problem. The housing market is so
large that any wholesale dramatic measures are prohibitively expensive. There
is also the ghastly precedent of the damage done to the economy by previous
runaway housing booms. The Chancellor's position is considerably eased however
by two important factors.
First, there is no supply side constraint. There is plenty of slack in
construction and building materials where employment continues to fall. Land
prices have weakened and mortgage lending is feeble. So there is little fear of
a runaway boom.
Second, the most politically sensitive part of the housing problem is at the
fringes of the market. Thus, wholesale measures which could cost an enormous
amount are not needed.
Major political benefits can be won, with a little ingenuity, by affordable
marginal changes. I would be very surprised if we do not see measures in such
areas as stamp-duty, and temporary or tapering increases in mortgage tax-relief
as examples.
Not only would such measures be politically popular, and help to alleviate a
real social problem, but they would quickly help to revive the economy
generally at a time when it is clearly slowing down, and ease unemployment.
I also believe that the Chancellor should concentrate on income tax and
housing, and try to avoid cluttering his Budget with too many other proposals
which would simply distract from the political impact of those two measures.
Now that Mr Clarke knows what to do, I can happily await Budget Day and enjoy
either the satisfaction of seeing my advice taken, or the equal satisfaction of
his being wrong and myself being right. I just hope he reads The Herald in time.

Frankfurt, Thursday - Bundesbank council member Guntram Palm said today nations
should make binding pledges that they will uphold fiscal austerity after having
joined the planned European Monetary Union.
``The Maastricht Treaty has no sufficient means to guard against individual
nations' unsolid fiscal policies,'' Mr Palm said, adding: ``This is the real
weak point in the agreement. This has to be improved in an appropriate way.''

MANUFACTURING industry in the UK reported a slight weakening in overall demand
in November confirming - if any confirmation was needed - that the recovery has
slowed but the prices outlook remains promising, according to the latest
Monthly Trends Enquiry from the Confederation of British Industry which is now
forecasting a ``sustainable'' interest rate cut of half a point in early 1996.
It will, though, require a ``prudent'' Budget on November 28, which takes no
risks with inflation and maintains a credible downward path for public
borrowing. The CBI is also forecasting that economic growth will continue at a
sluggish rate into 1996, leading to a growth rate of 2.5% next year. However,
stronger growth from the middle of next year is expected to raise the growth
rate to 2.8% in 1997. Manufacturing output is also projected to grow strongly
over the next two years.
The survey shows that 20% of firms said their order books were above normal and
29% below normal, giving a negative balance of 9%, one more than the preceding
month. Total order books have now been below normal for the past three months.
Demand from overseas also continues to be less buoyant than earlier in the
year, with a balance of 1% reporting order books below normal. Companies have
reported export demand to be close to normal for the third survey in a row,
although this month's balance is the lowest in a monthly survey since June 1994.
More firms expect to increase domestic prices over the next four months rather
than reduce them. November's positive balance of 15% is four percentage points
up on last month, although half of the companies surveyed expect prices to
remain unchanged.
However, Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economic analysis,
said the ``prospects for factory gate price inflation remained more promising
than in the first half of the year, as competitive pressures in the home market
continued to restrain the ability of firms to push up prices. The pick-up in
price expectations this month was not surprising, as it partly reflected the
revisions to price lists that companies undertook at the turn of the year.''
Kate Barker, chief economic adviser at the CBI said: ``With the recent slower
rate of growth now expected to persist over the next few months, inflationary
pressures in the economy have lessened. The balance of risks points more to
concern over weaker growth than over higher inflation.'' That the CBI's
interest rate forecast of a 0.5% cut next year is linked to the Budget is not
surprising. The CBI has been stressing the need for a cautious Budget for
months.
On a positive note, Mr Junankar said that consumer spending had performed
better than expected so far this year, and was set to underpin economic growth
in the next two years. He added: ``Encouragingly, private business investment
seems likely to make an increasing contribution to the growth forecasts for the
next two years.''

<TEXT>
ONE-OFF charges totalling some #30m sent fuel distribution and port services
group Powell Duffryn plummeting #13m into the red, half year results showed
yesterday.
Discounting exceptionals, the group would have made a pre-tax profit in the six
months to September 30 of #16.8m.
In the corresponding period last year, the group made a taxable #17m profit
after exceptional gains of #2.2m.
The latest one-off costs were made up of #13m in settlement of a long-standing
German lawsuit, net losses estimated at #10m following a fire at a fuel storage
depot in the United States and a goodwill write-off following the purchase of a
bulk powder tanker producer.
The Reading based company listed subdued trading in many of its markets and, in
particular, in the oil and gas distribution business where the weather and fuel
prices had a major impact.
On the positive side, its port division, which recently bought interests in the
ports of Tees and Hartlepool and in Humberside Holdings, was trading well.
Itsengineering division was also enjoying expansion.
Chairman David Hubbard said the board was concentrating on businesses which
provided the best opportunities for growth.
``Prospects for the second half are tempered as always by the unpredictable
effect of the winter on our oil and gas distribution activities, where
automotive fuel margins are also under intense pressure.
``That apart, there is no reason to believe at this stage that the year will
not see another sound trading outcome for the group.''
Shareholders will receive an interim dividend payout of 8p, unchanged from last
year, while earnings per share of 17.9p last time were converted into losses of
18.5p.

GRAHAM Thorpe finally left the starting blocks yesterday and ended any
lingering doubts about his right to a place in next Thursday's second Test
against South Africa.
The left-hander has spent the first five weeks of England's tour in a daze,
worrying about problems at home while struggling to find his feet on South
African soil.
But against a friendly Orange Free State attack, and given a flat Springbok
Park pitch, he scored a century that will have delighted manager Raymond
Illingworth.
Thorpe had flown home           earlier in the month to comfort wife Nicky
after she had lost the baby the couple had been expecting.
Then, on his return, he failed twice during the defeat by South Africa A before
being dismissed cheaply when the Test series began in Pretoria. But yesterday,
Thorpe looked much more like the batsman who has become a highly consistent
member of England's middle order over the last 18 months, helping himself to an
undefeated 131.
``I had only played four innings before this, so it was a bit early to be
putting pressure on myself,'' said the 26-year-old. ``But you could say it was
a relief to make some runs here.''
Illingworth, with only a hint of a smile, had suggested Thorpe should steer
clear of the pavilion if he repeated the ugly shot which led to his second
innings stumping against South Africa A. In fact, there were a couple of loose
drives outside off-stump yesterday.
But with Surrey team-mate Alec Stewart providing inspiration and advice from
the other end, Thorpe gradually settled, then blossomed into an innings that
yielded 20 confidence-boosting boundaries.
``It was good to get into some form and rhythm with the second Test coming
up,'' he said.
``I do not think I was really with it at Kimberley, having just flown back from
England, but I knuckled down here and now, hopefully, I can carry on.''
With Stewart blazing his way to 110 in 182 deliveries and with 21 fours, the
county colleagues added 141 at the rate of a run a minute after England had
slipped to 45 for two.
Mike Atherton's ninth ball duck, fending off a bouncer from Nicko Pretorius
into Louis Wilkinson's hands at gully, was no real cause for concern, given the
captain's high class first Test knock of 78.
But Mark Ramprakash's failure, dragging on a delivery from medium-pacer Chris
Craven after having made 15, should give England food for thought.
They seemed determined to stand by Ramprakash next week, despite his poor track
record at Test level, and their loyalty is commendable.
But an alternative for the No.3 spot exists for John Crawley, who had little
chance to shine here, with England declaring after he had contributed 28 to a
total of 316 for four.
The Lancashire youngster is, however, in prime form and clearly brimming with
confidence. Scoreboard:

IN Arab countries, wealthy families who used to go into the desert with their
camels nowadays often use Toyota Landcruisers instead. In Third World
countries, it is remarkable how frequently aid workers and staff of development
agencies are seen doing the same.
The Landcruiser seems to be omnipresent in places where really tough, powerful,
but in certain specifications air-conditioned and quite luxurious transport is
required. Toyota has built more than 2.5 million examples since going into the
all-terrain vehicle business seriously in 1951.
Some 4x4s sold here are lifestyle accessories, but the Landcruiser is a
massively built rough-country vehicle or impressive tow car. It has the ground
clearance, traction and tremendous pull to make it a fine mud-plugger, but
somehow the usual British off-road exercises seem quite small beer when you
look at a four-wheel-drive machine like this, designed to batter along for long
distances in real journeys through difficult terrain.ddddddd
Toyota believes in plenty of power and plenty of torque for its top-line 4x4.
The eight-seater Land- cruiser VX automatic at #38,689 comes with a 4477cc
six-cylinder petrol engine peaking at 202bhp, but I have been driving one of
the turbo diesel versions, able to meet the European Step 2 emission
regulations coming into force next year.
This engine is fitted to the VX manual at #39,120 and the more modestly
equipped five-seater GS manual at #29,630. All three models are provided with
serious off-tarmac items like a high and low ratio transfer box, as well as
front, centre and rear-locking differentials.
The 4164cc turbo diesel engine is one of the few in the world using multi-valve
technology. Its 168bhp output will haul the Landcruiser to 60mph in 12.5
seconds, but the most important performance element is the 280lb ft of torque,
which gives it immense mid-range pull. Lumbering along in slow traffic, the
diesel engine sounds like something which ought to be powering a bus. Moving
more quickly, it is quieter and freer of vibrations than most of its rivals.
With a high seating position and easy power steering, the Landcruiser is simple
to drive, although really wide in the rear flanks and with a large turning
circle. Scrapes on the nearside rear wheel arch, caused when I skelped the test
car against my own garden gate, are embarrassing evidence of that.
From its general specification many people might suppose that the Landcruiser
scores virtually no marks for ride quality. One of the surprises of this
well-matured       design is that the suspension intended to take so many Third
World shocks lets            it progress remarkably smoothly on ordinary
Scottish roads.

New assets
benefit
Currie
European
By ROBERT POWELL
MARTIN Currie European Investment Trust has done well over the last six months,
benefitting from strong dividend growth and a good performance by some of its
new investments.
Fully diluted net asset value per share rose 8.1% to 127.1p during the half
year to October 31, outperforming a 7.2% increase in the FT Actuaries Europe
(ex-UK) Index.
Dividend income rose by 50% #486,000 and the #30.5m trust benefited from the
selective purchase of new issues such as the Italian mobile phone company
Telecom Italia Mobil, the shoe and luxury goods manufacturer Gucci and the
German pharmaceutical company Merck. Edinburgh-based fund manager Martin Currie
said the outlook for 1996 in Continental Europe was promising, given the
prospects for low inflation and a further cut in interest rates.
``We are likely to see more new issues and further privatisations in the months
ahead which could provide some selective opportunities,'' it said.
Holdings in France and Germany were reduced from a combined total of 35% of the
portfolio to 29% as the German market appeared increasingly expensive and
long-awaited monetary reforms in France failed to come through.
The trust, meanwhile, boosted its position in Switzerland, which accounts for
12% of the portfolio, and Italy, which accounts for 7%. As usual, there was no
interim dividend.

IT was a typical Open opening day. A posse of unheralded, little-known
journeymen and youngsters cluttered the upper reaches of the leaderboard
yesterday after the first round of the Australian Open in Melbourne, while the
superstars failed to sparkle.
A nap hand of Aussies - Rob Whitlock, Lyndsay Stephen, David Bransdon, Peter
McWhinney, and Lucien Tinkler - shared the lead on 68, four under par, while
the group on 69 included former US PGA champion Wayne Grady and New Zealander
Michael Campbell.
Greg Norman, making the worst possible start, was three over par after eight
holes, but finished on level par after making three birdies. The other big
attraction, John Daly, shot 73.
There are plenty of trees at Kingston Heath and Daly was more constrained than
he ever was at St Andrews last July. Even using an iron off the tee, the
American could out-hit both his playing partners, but they outscored  him.
Campbell had five birdies in his 69 and Wayne Riley, who won this title in
1991, shot 71.
Daly had trouble reading the greens and Norman found them as fast as anything
he has ever putted on. Leading scores (Australian unless stated):
68 - D Bransdon, L Tinkler, L Stephen, P McWhinney, R Whitlock.
69 - P Devenport (New Zealand), G Waite (New Zealand), M Campbell (New
Zealand), P Moss (USA), W Grady.
70 - B Faxon (USA), C Gray, P Fitzgibbon, C Parry, G Ogilvy, R Pampling, S
Tait, T Price, C Spence, J Morse (USA), J Evans, L Wastle.
71 - S Elkington, R Willis, S Conran, P O'Malley, D Iwasaki-Smith, N Smith, T
Gale, M Harwood, R Allenby, W Riley.
72 - G Norman, O Moore, M McGrath, K Valentine, D McKenzie, D Podlich, G
Stratfold, M Cain, R Green, R Brook, S Appleby, P Fowler, C Parker, D Cole, G
Dodd, M Hallberg (Sweden), P Tataurangi (New Zealand), M Long (New Zealand).
q IRELAND'S Philip Walton and Ryder Cup team-mate Costantino Rocca both fired
opening rounds of 70 to lie five off the lead in the #1m Casio World Open in
Japan.
Japan's Kiyoshi Maita shot a seven-under-par 65 for a one-stroke lead over
fellow countryman Hajime Meshiai.  Also on 70
are Jumbo Ozaki, Lee Janzen and Vijay Singh.
q DEFENDING champion Isao Aoki fired an opening seven-under-par 65 yesterday to
take a one-shot lead in the Japan Senior Open championship in Kitaura.
q SCOTLAND'S Derek Crawford was four shots off the pace after the opening round
of the Zimbabwe Open yesterday in Harare. Leading scores (South African unless
stated):
66 - W Westner. 67 - B Pappas, B Lincoln. 68 - A MacKenzie (Britain), W
Coetsee, S van der Merwe, G Muller, L Wells.
Others included: 70 - N Price (Zimbabwe), D Crawford (Britain).

TAM Dalyell, the West Lothian Labour MP, is famous for being persistently
loquacious on the subject of the Lockerbie Pan-Am bombing. Tam has bombarded
Lord Rodger, the Lord Advocate, with letters on the issue.
Imagine, then, the horror of Lord Rodger to find himself plonked side by side
with Tam on the London Shuttle with the prospect of an hour-long grilling from
which there could be no escape. Alas for Tam, he was oblivious to the identity
of the gent occupying the neighbouring seat.
Mind you, who do you know who would definitely win a prize in a Spot the Lord
Advocate competition?
One bark for aye
THE important deliberations of Strathkelvin Council licencing board were
delayed this week when only four members turned up - one short of the required
quorum. The councillors were debating what to do next when who should be
spotted walking his dog in the adjacent park but one of the duly elected
members of the board.
A polisman in attendance was duly dispatched to ask the councillor if he would
make himself available for civic duties. He did so and the due processes of
municipal majesty went ahead thanks to five cooncillors and a dug.
What's in a name
WE have mentioned once or twice before Mr John Reid, principal of Bell College,
Hamilton. He is famous for his direct manner of speech (giving rise to his
nickname Rab C. - one of many affectionate cognomens) and for the impressive
rise to some #90,000 a year he managed to achieve in his annual salary as a
reward for taking the college (or University of Hamilton as it will surely soon
be known) ever upward further-education-wise.
We hear Mr Reid has yet another nickname - JC. Not because he is a godlike
figure. The initials stand for Johnny Cash, a reference to his salary.
A belly laugh
A SPHERICALLY challenged chum of the Diary (not unlike the Diary really) tells
us the Panorama interview with Lady Di struck a chord. He now knows that during
a recent period of low self-esteem he too was suffering from bulimia. Sad thing
was he got the bingeing bit just right but did not realise you were supposed to
throw up afterwards.
Sounds like a Derek Johnstone joke to us.
Fare enough
THE quantity of beggars in post-ceasefire Belfast may be small but there is no
doubting the quality. Engaged in conversation with a wee guy called Bobby in a
city centre bar we were first asked what team we supported - Kilmarnock seemed
to cause little reaction either way - then tapped for a couple of quid.
Declining to pay up but offering him a pint in lieu we were told: ``No, it's
not for drink, I want to get a taxi up the road.''
q PASSING Campbell College near Stormont our party was informed this was the
only public school in Belfast and catered for the cream of Ulster society -
so-called because they are all rich and thick.
Job creation
LOOKING through the situations vacant columns (as you do - you never know the
minute) we notice Glasgow City Council has vacancies for a ``creative services
officer (electrician)'' and a ``creative services technician (joiner)'' for its
museum and art galleries department.
We wish all applicants well and can imagine the celebrations of the successful
candidates in whatever pub. ``Are you still at the joinery?'' an acquaintance
might ask. ``No. I'm in creative services.''
``And what about big Willie the spark?'' ``He's doing awfy well. He's just been
appointed creative services officer.''
``Do you still do homers?'' ``No problem. And if you want a few pictures hung,
we'll throw that in for free.''
q In the same edition of the Herald jobs pages, a Glasgow company advertised
five vacancies for psychics, clairvoyants, and fortune tellers. A reader asks:
``Surely all these posts were filled before the advert appeared?''
q Finally, on the jobs front, we see an advert for ``experienced chick
sexers''. Before you get out your CV, we should point out it appeared in
Poultry World. Yes, those kind of chicks.
Gobstoppers
We at the Diary are second to none in our furtherance of the Scots tongue. Thus
we recommend, for those inevitable lulls in the pub conversation, a book of
Scottish proverbs published by Birlinn at #5.99.
It includes such handy phrases as:
q Ye was wheedle a laverock frae the lift. You would charm the birds from the
sky.
q What makes you sae rumgunshach and me sae curcuddoch? Why are you so rude and
unpleasant to me when I am so friendly and anxious to please you?
q She that fa's ower a strae's a tentless taupie. A person who falls at the
smallest of obstacles is a fool.
We should point that trying to read the whole book at one go can lead to
feeling ``forjidged, forefoughten, and forejeskit'' - An alliterative
expression denoting extreme fatigue.
And please remember: ``A bonny bride is soon buskit and a short horse is soon
whispit.'' Which, of course, needs no translation but we we will tell you
anyway - it means a slight task is soon finished.

Dallas, meanwhile, ended Kansas City's seven-game winning streak and a chance

IF Billy Dodds helps Aberdeen to success in the Coca-Cola Cup final he might
not be seen around Pittodrie for a few days, because the little striker is
planning a massive party to make up for all the bad times which have blighted
his career.
Dodds saw his dream move as a teenager to Chelsea axed, then he was relegated
from Scotland's top division with both Dundee and St Johnstone.
He said: ``If we lift the cup you won't see me for a while. That would be the
highlight of my career and would compensate for all the hard times.
``When I signed for Aberdeen I never thought for a moment that we would be
embroiled in relegation. Even my mates were giving me stick that I was a jinx.
I simply kept my head down and stepped up my work-rate.
``Last season was a fluke. Basically, it is the same team who were fighting
relegation which has taken us to this final, as Paul Bernard is the only
newcomer.
``We could not afford to look back or we would have found ourselves in exactly
the same position once again. But manager Roy Aitken has drummed into us that
we are winners.
``This is a huge club desperate for success. If we play as we did in the
semi-final we must have a great chance. But it won't be easy against Dundee.
``Jim Duffy has them playing quality football and his team has a bit of
everything - experience, youth and flair. But we have a lot of talent and know
we are a good side now.
``It would make my day at Hampden and mean so much to win this trophy.''
Eoin Jess and keeper Theo Snelders stepped up their training yesterday and are
confident of being fit for Hampden.
q MOTHERWELL striker Tommy Coyne, who has been out of action for a month with a
knee injury, has seen his comeback delayed yet again.
Fir Park manager Alex McLeish said: ``Tommy went to a specialist and his
return, unfortunately, looks like being later rather than sooner. It's
disappointing because he is a very important player for us.
``But we will not rush him back. He'll receive the proper rest and will only
return when fully fit.''
McLeish was forced into playing himself at Kilmarnock last Saturday and he may
have to turn out again for the basement battle with Falkirk as his problems
mount.
Said the manager: ``Apart from our long-term victims, John Philliben, Eddie
May, Jamie Dolan and Rob McKinnon are struggling a little.
``I would say Rob has the best chance. He made his comeback last week after
being out for 10 weeks and he felt a bit of tiredness within his muscles.''

THIS was stop-over Glasgow for the London Festival Orchestra on their annual
round Britain Cathedral Concert Series tour. The format this time at each of
the five venues visited is to engage the local cathedral choir for a couple of
choral numbers and then flesh out the rest of the programme by selecting
assortments from the band's extensive repertoire.
So last night it was Glasgow Cathedral Choir's turn and their contributions
opened both halves of the concert. While the 16-strong group looked splendidly
bright, garbed in scarlet robes, their performances unfortunately sounded
muffled and colourless under the baton of their director John Turner. Not
entirely the choir's fault, perhaps, as building works in the cathedral
resulted in the audience seated facing down the nave towards the entrance with
the singers standing on the rear steps, backs tight up against the huge doors
and required to project over the orchestra.
Where in the Haydn works and even in forays Cantique de Jean Rancine the
ensemble playing tended towards the thick and woolly, textures became
immediately cleaner when Ross Pople, LFO director, took over to conduct the
purely instrumental pieces. Janacek's Suite for Strings was suitably astringent
in tone and Lucy Wakeford tripped delicately through the Debussy Dances for
Harp and Orchestra.
For the concluding work Ross Pople directed from the cello desk, joining an
account of Dvorak's Serenade for Strings that tipped the programme dangerously
close to an excess of saccherine.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH champion Bruce Flockhart boosted his Olympic hopes when he put out the
3/4 seed, Chinese-born American Kevin Han, in the second round of the Scottish
Open at the Kelvin Hall yesterday.
The 23-year-old Stirling University student is the first Scot in 20 years to
reach the men's singles quarter-finals.
Ranked 26 places below his opponent in the world, Flockhart now has a prime
opportunity to prove himself, with the race to Atlanta fast gathering momentum.
He will meet fellow Brit Anders Nielsen at the next hurdle, another player
keenly contesting an Olympic berth.
Flockhart took time to find his feet against Han, struggling in the first game
to lose out 15-4 in a matter of minutes. But the twice National champion
rallied to win the next almost as comfortably, 15-5, and made the most of Han's
errors in the last to win 15-12.
Scottish champion Anne Gibson also battled through, defeating Poland's
Katarzyna Krasowka by an easy 11-2, 11-8.
``I play England's Tanya Groves next, and I just hope it's not third time lucky
for her, because we've met twice this season and I've won both times,'' said
Gibson.
Victory for 27-year-old Gibson could be enough to propel her above rival Julia
Mann in the world rankings, so fuelling her Olympic dreams.

PROFIT-taking and two Monopoly and Merger Commission referrals forced most
equities to finish lower after Wednesday's record close, but dealers said the
market's upward trend was still intact.
``But for the electricity referrals, it was a pretty steady day considering it
was (US) Thanksgiving,'' one trader said. ``It was always likely that we would
have a down day, especially with the US on holiday.''
US financial markets were closed yesterday in observance of the annual
Thanksgiving holiday. American markets will close early today.
The UK Government's decision to refer two electricity sector bids to the MMC
sent the FTSE-100 index of leading shares back down to the 3600 level. Key
support held, but the market closed down 29.9 points at 3602.5.
The referral to the MMC of PowerGen's bid for Midlands Electricity and National
Power's offer for Southern Electric unsettled the electricity sector, that had
grown used to the Government nodding through takeover bids.
Southern Electric shares finished the day at 913p, down 62p, while Midlands
Electricity dropped 59p to 918p.
National Power lost 16p to 478p while PowerGen finished down 21p at 540p.
Despite the referrals, dealers said bid activity was likely to continue,
resulting in further highs for UK shares.
``We haven't seen the last of the bids,'' one dealer said. ``Company balance
sheets are pretty strong and they have to do something with the cash.
``Companies can either give the cash back to shareholders or they can make
bids,'' he added. ``Our bet is the bids will continue well into 1996.''
In the bond market, gilts closed higher during light trading in a market with
few sellers. Traders expect bonds to remain quiet until Tuesday's budget speech.
December long-gilt futures reached a new contract high of 109-08 during the day
before closing 9/32 up at 109-04.
In the equities market, the water sector saw the first-ever takeover of a
privatised group by a foreign company when Northumbrian Water agreed to a #823m
bid from French group Lyonnaise des Eaux.
The Newcastle-based group's shares jumped 35p to 1169p in reaction to terms
worth 1179p a share in cash and special dividends.
Other water group shares went higher on rumours of further bid moves. Severn
Trent led the way at 665p, up 8p.
North West Water was up 4p to 609p after its interim results showed growing
profits.
Forte saw quieter trading than yesterday at 351p, up 4p, as dealers learned
that Japan's Suntory did not want to make a counter-bid to Granada's #3.3bn
offer. Granada gained 4p to 653p.
Paper and packaging group Ferry Pickering improved 24p to 192p on a #26m
takeover by Wace, which also expanded its greeting card business with a
separate acquisition in Dublin. Wace fell by 6p to 239p.
Polar raced up 52p to 430p after a merger deal to create a stronger electronic
components firm with Abacus, which improved by 1p to 279p.
Powell Duffryn was a big loser as it reversed 74!sp to 480!sp on losses,
including almost #30m of one-off charges, and after a cautious statement on
prospects for its fuel business in the key winter months.
Storehouse advanced by 10p to 332p after better-than-forecast interim profits
of #34.5m, up 42%.
Its Mothercare stores made up for poorer trading at the Bhs chain. Chief
executive Keith Edelman said that September and October had been bad months,
though the stores group had seen some improvement in November.
The insurance sector stood out while most other top stocks were hit by
profit-taking.
Legal &amp; General, which recently announced a #160m windfall for with-profits
policyholders, was up 11p to 706p. Commercial Union was another in demand with
a 8p gain to 643p.
Inchcape was a major loser at 238p, down 18p, on the belief that it will lose
its status as a FTSE member and be relegated from the list.
Publisher Dorling Kindersley added 24p to 528p after Microsoft sold its 17.9%
stake at 507p.
A profits warning at money broker Exco sent it 21p lower to 120p and a grim
trading update from property group Regent Corporation sent it diving 2!sp to 5p.
Cable &amp; Wireless gave up 13p to 453p after a run on the shares of its Hong Kong
Telecoms subsidiary in the wake of the C&amp;W boardroom upheavals.
Engineer Babcock International was cut down 13p to 148p after a downbeat
results statement and losses in its German business.

IT is now almost eight years since Dundee player-manager Jim Duffy was advised
by specialists that he should stop playing football. Yet, on Sunday, the
indomitable defender seems sure to lead his team on to Hampden and into his
first major final as a player.
At 36 years of age, Duffy genuinely believes that now is the time when he can
pick up his first medal, even though his damaged knee has become a standing
joke among the medical profession in Scotland.
Yesterday, as he began the serious preparations for the Coca-Cola Cup final
against Aberdeen on Sunday, Duffy grinned: ``The doctors, the surgeons, the
specialists, they all just laugh at me now. ``If I tell any one of them after a
game that I can't straighten my knee they just shake their heads, laugh, and
walk away.
``I suppose that's because they know that I won't do what they tell me to do,
which is stop playing football.
``They did tell me before, back in 1987, and I did listen and I took their
advice and I continued to do that for two-and-a-half years. I stopped playing
for that length of time and I hated it. I wanted to keep on playing and that's
what I have done ever since.
``Yes, I still feel pain after matches, but the pain is no worse now than it
was eight years ago.
``People say that I'm not as good a player now but, then, even without the
injury I'm not likely to be as good at 36 as I was at 28.
``I don't let it worry me, but I don't make a big deal out of it because there
are a lot of people worse off than I am. After all, all I've got is a sore
knee.''
Now, before the final, Duffy must decide whether or not he picks himself for
what is the biggest match of his career. He is in charge. But he will listen to
others and not make any sentimental decision about his own big day.
Yesterday he pointed out: ``This is a major match for this club, for this team,
and for these players. It is not about me. It is about all of us and I have to
make the right decision for Dundee Football Club.
``There will be no sentiment involved. If I think I am the right player for
this game, then I'll play. If I don't think that, then I will still be there on
the bench, still at Hampden, and still involved because I'm the manager.''
There is a strong belief within Duffy, which appears to have spread to his
squad, that Dundee can follow Raith Rovers' example of last season and produce
a shock result, though Duffy does not talk too much about the Ibrox final when
Celtic lost out.
He says simply: ``That was Raith's day. It was their big occasion and it has no
bearing on this weekend. We have to do it for ourselves.
``If anything the Raith result might work against us, because Aberdeen will be
more on their guard. They won't want to suffer as Celtic did.''
Even allowing for the possibility of caution from the Dons, Duffy reckons, like
so many at Pittodrie, that this will be an open final, a flowing final and
perhaps even a high scoring one. He admits: ``We have midfield players who want
to get forward just as they do. Goals can arrive from different areas. I think
we are better when we're up against a team with the same outlook as ourselves.
This will suit us.
``You know, I don't believe any of our youngsters will freeze on the day
despite their relative inexperience. The older players will worry more than the
young lads.
``Look, when you're a kid and you climb a tree, you get up there to the top and
you don't think anything about it. When you're a little bit older and you do
the same you start to think about what would happen if you fell.
``I would never say before a game like this that we might lose, but I have a
real belief that we can win this one.''
Duffy will decide tomorrow morning whether he will play himself or not.
So far, he has given his players his thoughts about the game and how the team
will be asked to play but the personnel remains secret.
My own belief is that Duffy will be in the team giving on-field guidance to the
young men around him, coaxing and ajoling then towards possible glory.
It's a role made for this man who has simply refused to quit the game he loves.
q SPANISH club Union Deportivo Salamanca are preparing a move for Brazilian
World Cup star Romario.
Salamanca, currently 18th in the Spanish first division, are poised to make a
#2.6m bid for the Flamengo striker.
Romario is understood to be unhappy at Flamengo, who have struggled in the
Brazilian league this year, and expressed his desire to return to Spain after
scoring a hat trick in a charity America versus Europe match in Barcelona last
month.

<RECORDNO>975224943</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PAN-GERMAN gross domestic product growth was static in the third quarter of
this year from the second quarter, the Economics Ministry said yesterday in its
latest monthly report.
Economists said the news confirmed their belief that the recovery from
Germany's deepest post-war recession in 1993 had ground to a halt in the second
half of 1995.
The Ministry said: ``We expect that seasonally adjusted real GDP was near
enough unchanged in the third quarter from the second and that the year-on-year
change was clearly lower than that of the first half of the year.''
Pan-German year-on-year GDP growth was 2.6% in the first half of this year.
The Federal Statistics Office is due to release detailed data on third-quarter
GDP on December 7 but the Economics Ministry often releases its own estimate in
advance.
The Ministry said the situation on the labour market remained very
unsatisfactory. Unemployment has risen for the last three months in a row.
``In West Germany there is not enough economic activity to bring any relief to
the labour market.''
It said a clear improvement in the jobs situation was not yet in sight largely
as a result of the economic slowdown. Industrial orders and output fell in the
third quarter from the second.
``The development in this economic cycle is clearly much less favourable than
than in previous cycles,'' the report said.
The main reasons for the slowdown were a less buoyant world economy, the
strengthening of the mark against most currencies which has led to firms losing
share in world markets.
``These problems were exacerbated by high wage rises and rises in supplementary
wage costs,'' it said. - Reuter

MANY of the Scottish contingent yesterday set about restoring pride from poor
past performances in the PGA European Tour Qualifying School in Spain with
strong opening rounds over the more demanding San Roque course.
Longniddry's Raymond Russell and Scott Henderson of Kings Links both carded
two-under-par 70s across the 7044-yard course on the sun-drenched Costa del Sol
to settle in third place. Buchanan Castle's William Guy was on 73.
Former Walker Cup player Russell enjoyed calm morning conditions and carded
three birdies and a single bogey. The 23-year-old narrowly missed qualification
at his two previous attempts.
With temperatures as high as 30C, Russell rolled in an eight-foot putt to
birdie the 395-yard second and made pars until the 443-yard eleventh, where a
20-foot putt dropped. A later bogey was countered at the 207-yard sixteenth,
where his No.4-iron tee shot ended two feet from the hole.
Former Scottish assistants' champion Henderson crashed with a closing 80 at
Montpellier last season. The 26-year-old's opening effort improved on that
total by 10 in a round which included five birdies.
Guy's round comprised two bogeys and a birdie. Having failed last season at the
fourth play-off hole, the Glasgow golfer could contend again this week.
At Guadalmina, Walker Cup player Stephen Gallacher posted a one-over-par 72
while Downfield's Andrew Crerar was round in level par. Leading scores:
San Roque: 67 - R May (USA). 69 - F Cea (Spain). 70 - O Sellberg (Sweden), R
Russell (Longniddry), G Clark (England), S Henderson (Kings Links), N Henning
(S Africa), R Muntz (Holland).
Other Scottish scores included: 73 - W Guy (Buchanan Castle). 77 - B Marchbank
(Marchbank Golf Enterprises). 81 - D Scott (Letham Grange).
Guadalmina: 66 - J Mellor (England). 67 - H Buhrmann (S Africa), I Feliu
(Spain), T Gogele (Germany).
Scottish scores included: 71 - A Crerar (Downfield). 72 - S Gallacher
(Bathgate).
q AMATEUR champion Gordon Sherry kept holders Kilmarnock Barassie in the hunt
in the European Club Cup at Vilamoura yesterday. His three-over-par 75 was the
pick of the Ayrshire trio yesterday and it helped his club to a two-day total
of 300, five behind French outfit Racing Club. Leading scores:
295 - France (Racing Club) 149, 146. 296 - Norway (Vestfold Golfklubb) 150,
146. 300 - Scotland (Kilmarnock Barassie) 148, 152 (G Sherry 75, J Milligan 77,
A Reid 82 - did not count).
Others included: 306 - England (Sand Moor) 155, 151. 313 - Wales (Ashburnham)
159, 154. 325 - Scotland (Kelso) 169, 156 (I Ford 77, I Lauder 79, W Lawrence
85 - did not count).

HEATOVENT Electric, an East Kilbride based company which manufactures heating
appliances, has been forced into receivership, placing 75 jobs at risk.
Coopers and Lybrand, which was yesterday appointed receiver, said it would try
to sell the company as a going concern.
Heatovent specialises in manufacturing storage heaters and has annual sales of
#4.5m, but the expenses involved in a move to new premises led to a cash
squeeze.
``The company moved to larger premises in East Kilbride in 1993,'' said Coopers
&amp; Lybrand corporate recovery partner Ian Rankin. ``The increase in overheads
unfortunately coincided with a downturn in the market leading to cash
difficulties.''
``With an order book of #700,000, we will continue trading with a view to
finding a buyer for the business as a going concern. Some interest has been
show, even at this early stage.'' he added.

ALISON Ramsay, the former Great Britain internationalist and the most-capped
woman player in the world, last night joined the list of all-time Scottish
greats when she was presented with the MacRobert Thistle Award for her services
to hockey by Glasgow's Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall at the City Chambers.
Ramsay retired from the international scene in June after having played in a
record 257 internationals (150 for Scotland and 107 in the colours of Britain)
including the defeat of Korea for the bronze medal at the Barcelona Olympics.
Ramsay's interest, like the rest of British hockey, will be focused on the
Hartleyvale Stadium in Cape Town this afternoon when the current British side
will attempt to secure a place at the Atlanta Olympics.
Britain still require two points to be certain of advancing as one of the five
qualifiers but their task was simplified yesterday when China beat South Africa
1-0 and Canada surprisingly beat European champions Holland 1-0 from a goal by
Karen MacNeill three minutes from time. Results:
South Africa 1, China 2; Holland 0, Canada 1. Placings - 1, Germany, 8 points;

Amsterdam, Thursday - DUTCH banking and insurance giant Internationale
Nederlanden Groep (ING) today announced its net profit rose 15% in the year's
first nine months while total income went up 7.1%.
The income rise was fuelled by steady growth in its insurance activities and an
improved result from financial transactions in its banking activities, ING said.
Net profit for 1995's first three quarters was 1880m guilders, up from 1640m
guilders for the same period last year.
ING's total income reached 29.13bn guilders, 7.1% higher than the 27.19bn
recorded at this stage of 1994.
Earnings per share rose to 6.87 guilders, from 6.24 guilders in the
year-earlier period.
ING said its pre-tax result from banking and insurance activities combined in
the first nine months rose 16.1% to 2760m guilders.
After deduction of dividend payments on own shares, ING was left with a pretax
result of 2720m guilders.
ING reiterated earlier forecasts that net profit per ordinary share for the
whole of 1995 will top 1994's level.
The group said the growth of income and operating expenditure in its banking
activities was influenced by the inclusion of Barings in the consolidated
accounts.
ING bought the failed British merchant bank after it collapsed early this year
amid massive losses blamed on rogue dealer Nick Leeson who arrived today in
Singapore to face trial for his deals.
Barings showed a modest positive result, according to ING, with Barings Asset
Management making a contribution to this.
On the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, ING put on one guilder to close at 100.90,
after its results gained a good reception from investors. - AP/Reuter
n Warsaw, Thursday - General Motors Corporation and its German division, Adam
Opel, are planning an investment worth up to $390m to build a production plant
in Poland.
Opel Chairman David Herman met Polish Industry and Trade Minister Klemens
Scierski to pave the way for opening detailed negotiations next month.
Mr Herman said the company was considering a greenfield production facility
with capacity of up to 100,000 passenger cars a year.The overall investment
could range from $280m to $390m, he said.
The location of the site will be established during negotiations and Opel
planned to make its final decision next year.
The announcement follows the November 14 decision by GM's Polish partner,
Warsaw's FSO car factory, to sell a controlling stake to the South Korean giant
Daewoo. The Koreans agreed to invest more than $1100m in the Polish carmaker. -

WEE boys born during the War were practically princes. Mind you wee girls were
equally royalty. Mums looked after their children and held them close in those
dark days when their men were off getting killed and maimed or, more often,
more stupid with the tedium of battle. Very proud of wee boys, mothers were
then. After all, mothers knew that their sons would grow up to defend them, the
poor bleeders. Fifty years on most mothers probably still do, but not if you
were to go by every bloody blatt in a quarter of a century.
Not one single daily rag exists without an egregious onslaught against the
gender with the sticky-out bit from women. Not ordinary women of course.
Ordinary women make splendid mums by and large, and decent enough wives, and
lovely girlfriends, and as for aunties and grandmas . . . But every blatt has a
special combination of special pleading and outright penis envy which must
surely embarrass media women.
Our own paper saw two serious onslaughts on males within the past five days and
very cliche-ridden they were at that. Truth to tell I mind the cliches rather
more than the insults, but it might be suggested that were male writers or
broadcasters to state that kind of near-racist contumely which it is thought
enlivens blatts and TV and radio programmes, they would be sacked.
I have had the insensitivity of men and the tenderness of women up to the point
at which one begins to question questions.
Sensitivity? The past 20 years has seen a grand array of sensitive women who
have challenged the male establishment. Mrs Marcos, Mrs Thatcher, Mrs Windsor,
and now, I suppose, Mrs West. No doubt there is some excuse for these sirens
which female commentators can put up and I shall be interested to discover such
ingenuities.
I feel, most men I know, feel, beleagured at every turn by the media, the
social agencies, the politicians, the bloody know-alls, and the professional
jeremiahs of the gender war. But the last straw came with one of my colleagues
this week. She complained about men of course, but the complaint was that we
always won quizzes in pubs.
This is a bit like saying that the reason why I win quizzes is because I know
more or, come to think of it, the reason why the other team won was because
they were better. What possible harm can pub quizzes be, or any other quizzes,
including the ones I have been happy to take part in of a Christmas dinner with
my family?
Our commentator the other week in the blatt suggested that men were incapable
of asking the serious questions about emotions and feelings and . . . I never
heard such drivel. The overwhelming majority of bleeding violets who make up
the poetic tradition since the Greeks for heaven's sake right through to the
Romantics, and the Georgians, and then the War poets, and then on to - until
the monstrous regiment of lady neurotics in the post-War years - have been men.
Just give me one - one female Love poet to touch Donne, or Spencer, or
Shakespeare, or Burns, or Yeats, or any bloody one at all. Now get out of my
way.
But why do the ladies get up so much of a head of steam in their condemnation
of men, what they get up to, the games they play, quizzes, rugby, and football,
and why do they become so upset when it turns out that with a few exceptions
men are the better musicians and writers and artists and politicians and
anything else and why do they crack up most of all when it is proved that any
woman can be as good as any man in any field. All they have to be is just as
good.
Why do I have to find myself pressing the button on Women's Hour because I
can't cope with any more serials about a mulatto girl in St Helena whose father
was the younger son of the wicked Duke of Buckingham? (Anybody who listens in
to Women's Hour has come to heart-sinking when the dread phrase ``And now time
for our serial'' slides across the airwaves.)
Why do I have to read the sort of bar-room punditry from birds in Jaeger suits
and find myself throwing away damn-near every newspaper and magazine which
comes my way?
When my mother had me during the War I was doubtless a young warrior to be. But
in those days, even a wee boy was loved for being a child who would become a
man: not a figure of ill-placed and resentful hostility, as it seems to be
today.

IT has not been a week to make light of things, but stuck in a groove in my
head has been the famous exit line of Voltaire's novel, Candide. ``True
enough,'' says Candide, who has finally learned he cannot change the course of
history, ``but we must go and work in the garden.''
A colloquial English translation misses the precision and philosophical charge
of the French: ``Il faut cultiver notre jardin.'' Our garden, our own backyard.
We must not neglect it, we must make it productive. Voltaire's hero has decided
a strategy of benign and constructive parochialism better serves the world than
high-minded interference in its broader business.
It's an attractive position, but one which looks risky when parochialism turns
malign and destructive. In the vicious parish-pump politics of the Balkans,
heads are knocked together by ``the international community'', mainly America,
whose high-minded president whistles in the dark of a confused agenda.
Will the patchwork peace work, or will the intervention of its brokers cause
more and wider blood-letting?
In the handsome English town of Gloucester, Fred and Rosemary West cultivated
their garden and turned it into a mass grave. What could be more parochial than
their own little world - the exclusive intimacy of their shared hobby? Who
could be more disastrously provincial than the neighbours, relatives, friends
and acquaintances who have crawled out of the woodwork to maximise the assets
of long-held misgivings and suspicions? But the surface brutality of the Wests'
life, the squalid sex, the beating of their children, was ``none of our
business''.
Among the least successful horticulturists in their own gardens are the media,
whose useful function of reporting the news has long since been overtaken by
the urge to interfere through explaining it, sometimes helpfully, sometimes
fancifully, but always officiously. And if we can't lay our hands on an
explanation, if we can't understand the neighbours' war in Bosnia, if we talk
to all the experts and still find nothing to explain the Wests, then an opinion
will do.
I, for example, have an opinion this week on the postal workers' unofficial
strike which began in Edinburgh and spread elsewhere, and my opinion couldn't
be more parochial, even if it's hard to cultivate your garden when you haven't
had any mail for four days. I try to see the broad picture of a workforce made
nervous by doubts about an uncertain future which we all share - as much in the
newspaper industry as anywhere - but it isn't easy to get past the view from my
overdraft.
Between them the Royal Mail and their workers have brought bitter new meaning
to the promise: ``The cheque's in the post.'' The bedrock of my monthly income,
the cheque for my freelance work for The Herald, has been lying all week in a
sorting office somewhere in Edinburgh.
I won't starve, of course; I have funds elsewhere and a pack of credit and
account cards, and if the worst comes to the worst I can always borrow pocket
money from my husband.
But there will be bank charges to pay on all the regular transactions the
cheque normally covers, and there will be many other people for whom the
disrupted mail service means real hardship.
The private customers, the business ones, all of us feeling aggrieved by the
poor return on the support we gave to postal workers when the Royal Mail was
under threat of privatisation; some of us now cursing their panicky
pariochialism and making plans for a future which will be less and less
dependant on a method of communication which looks more and more inefficient.
I'm not just talking about the indifference and incompetence of individual
postal workers, although we've got those, too, in Edinburgh. (Among the mixture
of personal, business and junk mail which arrives daily in our household there
are regularly misdelivered, not misaddressed, letters.) I'm talking about the
cumbersome business of physically transporting envelopes and their contents
between senders and receivers. It already seems quaint. Its days are surely
numbered.
The modest, one-woman business run from a back room in our home was very slow
to enter the age of electronic communications, but it now uses the Royal Mail
much less than it did. The hard copy which once went into the post, sometimes
into Express if deadlines pressed, now disappears down a telephone line with
the help of a modem. Documents and letters come and go by fax. The National
Magazine Company, occasional employers, electronically deposit their fees for
my work straight into my bank account.
I'm not sure why Caledonian Publishing, who are much more regular employers,
don't pay me electronically, too, but I'll be making inquiries; and if all
that's required is some information about my bank account then one more regular
delivery will be lost to the Royal Mail. Perhaps a little bit of tangible
satisfaction - the comforting crackle of a freshly-issued cheque - will also
disappear, but in my first job they used to hand out banknotes in little brown
envelopes. It's a long time since I had any sentimental feelings about this
insecure and often grubby method of payment. I'll adjust.
Lately, I've begun to feel we've been too sentimental about the Royal Mail and
the parochial nirvana which is the status of the sub-post office. There are two
sub post-offices within a few minutes walk from my house/place-of-work and at
least one of them is one too many.
Support your local post office? Why? It closes every lunchtime and takes half
the day off on Wednesdays and Saturday. It's an anachronism.
Support your local postal workers? They'll have to give me a better reason than
their vital contribution to the Christmas card industry. I can live without
second deliveries, and I'm sure I can learn to live without first.

BIDDING fever spread to the construction sector yesterday with Kvaerner, the
Norwegian shipbuilding and offshore engineering group, acquiring a 12% stake in
Amec.
Kvaerner, parent to the Kvaerner Govan shipyard in Glasgow, paid 100p a share
for 20 million Amec shares.
Talks between Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman and chief executive of Amec and Erik
Tonseth, chief executive of Kvaerner, broke down yesterday as they were unable
to find a way forward with their negotiations.
Kvaerner, which believes that the two businesses complement each other, is
considering its options. If it decides to mount a full cash bid for Amec, it
will not be at a price in excess of 100p per share, barring any rival offer.
There was some surprise among City analysts that anyone would want to buy
control or a stake in any UK contractor given the sector's current problems.
In the first half to June, Amec reported a drop in profits from #9.1m to #6.1m
and earnings per share were only just positive. However, the dividend was
maintained at 1.5p.
If a competitive bid situation for Amec does arise, analysts have speculated
that German or Middle Eastern groups may enter the fray.
There have been market rumours of a merger between Amec and McAlpine following
the recent asset swap between Tarmac and George Wimpey.
News of Kvaerner's share raid, carried out by SBC Warburg, pushed Amec shares
up 21p to 99p in heavy trading.

THE threats of a new law to ban the media from paying witnesses, in the wake of
the Rosemary West trial, have all the feeble force of plastic sabres rattling.
For legal remedies already exist which could have been used to keep cash out of
the courtroom at Winchester, according to senior legal figures who believe the
Attorney General already has the power to deal with such cases. They cite the
1981 Contempt of Court Act and criminal law which can be used against those
suspected of interfering with witnesses.
The real question is not how to stop lucrative liaisons between witnesses with
a lurid tale to tell and those willing to pay for them in future. It is why it
was allowed to happen at all in the West case.
Yesterday Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell argued there was ``a strong
case'' for a change in the law and said he was ``seriously considering'' making
cheque-book journalism illegal in court cases.
The Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, commissioned a report into the issue after
several witnesses admitted receiving up to #100,000 for their stories. And the
newspaper watchdog, the Press Complaints Commission, announced it will conduct
an inquiry because payments to witnesses is contrary to its voluntary code of
conduct.
At least seven witnesses at the West trial said they had taken payments ranging
from #750 to a reputed #100,000. It was revealed in court that witness Janet
Leach - who gave evidence about her conversations with Fred West while he was
held in prison - had a #12,000 agreement with a newspaper group for ``exclusive
rights'' to her story and a #100,000 agreement for a book.
Although Mrs Leach, a prison visitor, had at first lied about the payment in
court, she later admitted the offer, denying she had embellished her evidence
to make it more marketable.
There were claims that some witnesses were not called at all because of worries
that their evidence would be seen as tainted by the cash they had received.
Rosemary West's solicitor, Leo Goatley, said the defence team had ``very real
concern'' about the activities of certain members of the media. But aside from
the forlorn pleas from the defence lawyers and a rap on the knuckles for a
small local paper, the Attorney General did not tackle the antics of the
powerful national media giants who wafted tens of thousands of pounds under the
noses of witnesses.
Scotland's former Lord Justice General, Lord Emslie, Edinburgh University's
Professor of Scots Law, Robert Black, and the Crown Office all confirmed
yesterday that existing laws can be used against those who approach witnesses
in the run up to a trial.
Although England and Scotland have separate legal systems, the 1981 Contempt of
Court Act applies in both countries. And on both sides of the Border there is a
law to deal with interference with the course of justice.
Lord Emslie believes that approaches to witnesses before a trial are covered by
the common law: ``It's my impression that this is already covered by the law on
the perversion of the course of justice, or attempts to do so, or by acts
calculated to do so.
``It would cover the danger of witnesses being persuaded, or encouraged, to
polish their evidence to suit the fee they were to get. Presumably the fee is
calculated on the view that the witness is able to give a fairly dramatic
account of a particular event. If the witness felt like it, I suppose the
testimony could be made dramatic, whereas in the truth of the matter it might
not be.''
He did not believe the Contempt of Court Act, which says that any publication
which creates a substantial risk of serious prejudice to forthcoming legal
proceedings and is punishable by imprisonment of up to two years, could have
been applied in the West trial.
Professor Black, however, says that while the Contempt of Court Act is
basically about publishing things likely to influence a jury in a trial, it
could have been applied if the witnesses were influenced by payments:
``If it can be established, and there is some evidence that witnesses were
giving evidence in a dramatic way because of the arrangements with newspapers,
there is no reason why the Attorney General shouldn't have taken proceedings
against them. It is too late now. But where was he when the problem was
extant?''
If the behaviour of newspapers was likely to influence the testimony that the
witness gave, that could well amount to contempt of court.
Similarly, the Crown Office indicated that it would come down hard on anyone
who made approaches to witnesses in a trial: ``Anything which interferes with
the course of justice may amount to the crime of attempting to pervert the
course of justice, or in certain circumstances contempt of court,'' a spokesman
explained.
The West case, arguably more than any other, illustrates how the law on
contempt of court, and the attendant substantial risk of prejudicing a fair
trial, are viewed north and south of the Border.
In Scotland, the legal strait-jacket ensures that when someone is arrested on a
serious charge you will read only the bare bones until the case comes to court.
In England, as the West case shows, the media will provide readers, viewers,
and listeners with a wealth of details about the case, publishing pictures of
the accused, background information, even apparent motives. The lurid reports
of Frederick West's case, after his suicide, but before his wife was tried, is
only the latest in a dishonourable list stretching back beyond the Yorkshire
Ripper.
In Scotland, journalists trying something similar would be viewing the case
from a small spartan cell. Yet in England, the Attorney General, responsible
for initiating contempt of court proceedings has more often sat on his hands.
A spokesman at the Attorney General's office yesterday sighed in admiration
over the ``very robust'' response taken by Scottish courts to the risks of
prejudicing a trial (although he wasn't aware, until he made checks that the
same law is on both sides of the Border) but he said the view of legal experts
in England was that the contempt of court act did not cover cheque-book
journalism.
While the law on interfering with witnesses exists, it would have to be proved
that there was intent to subvert or pervert the course of justice.
``If the journalist simply enters into an arrangement for payment or pays on
account of the story later, he would not have any malicious intent as far as
proceedings are concerned, he is merely interested in securing his copy. ``I am
well aware that the Scots tradition is much more robust, and it's not unusual
to find fairly similar offences having a rather different outcome in Scotland
and in England.''
In Scotland, newspapers and broadcasting organisations know to their cost the
risk of falling foul of the law. There have been heavy fines for publishing
articles that their English counterparts wouldn't even bother checking with a
lawyer.
Martin Smith, a Glasgow solicitor who advises on media law, was in no doubt
about his response to any journalist who might think about approaching a
witness: ``You are not allowed to approach witnesses, simple as that. You are
not supposed to question witnesses prior to their giving evidence. In my view
that could constitute contempt.
``If the West trial had been held in Scotland, no paper would have signed up
any of the witnesses before they gave evidence. That is the law.''
But then, to borrow a phrase from a court regular, Ian Hislop, the editor of
Private Eye - the law in England, as it applies to contempt hearings, is a
``banana''.
The case of the Taylor sisters who were freed after being found guilty of the
murder of a love rival because of prejudicial reporting during their trial. It
is but one outrageous case in point. Another includes the aborted trial of
Geoffrey Knights, the boyfriend of EastEnders' actress Gillian
Taylforth, for assault.
Then there is the Press Complaints Commission which says ``paying witnesses or
potential witnesses in current criminal proceedings'' violates its code of
conduct. Apart from a sharp skelp over the legs for an intrusion of privacy
given to the News of the World editor, Piers Morgan, it has yet to instigate
action in cases where gross contempt of court has been shown.
The purchase of a prostitute on Sunset Boulevard, by the News of the World, who
paid #100,000 to Divine Brown to deliver a blow to Hugh Grant's image with her
story of their late-night liaison in a car, may be held out as justification
for the practice. The paper sold 150,000 extra copies the week it appeared.
The qualities may still balk at such naked cheque-book journalism, not least
because they cannot afford it, it is hard to deny that bad practice soon drives
out good, and the need to sensationalise to sell means that straightforward
reporting is lost. That is one argument. The real risk though is that by
refusing to stand up to the powerful media forces who flout the law the chance
of real people seeking real justice is lost - along with respect for the
independence of the law. But that may be another argument entirely.

<HEADLINE>Minister changes laissez-faire approach on power company takeovers Lang catches City on hop</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT of the Board of Trade Ian Lang took share markets rather by surprise
yesterday when he referred PowerGen's bid for Midlands Electricity together
with National Power's offer for Southern Electric to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
He has perhaps given the impression that as far as the privatised utilities are
concerned it is virtually a free for all and anything goes.
In fact, though, there is a difference in that in both these cases a power
generator will be taking over an electricity distributor. The generating
companies and the distributors are in the same industry and, therefore, more
open to criticism that they could operate against the public interest after a
merger.
ScottishPower's bid for Manweb was waived through. It could be argued that
ScottishPower was already vertically integrated and operates separately
geographically, while Manweb can still shop around. But it still looks
anomalous in the light of yesterday's decision.
So far as the Trade Minister is concerned he still takes a somewhat
laissez-faire approach, stating yesterday that he did not believe vertical
integration between electricity generators and distributors was objectionable.
In fact, he said he did not find it objectionable in any sector.
So possibly on this occasion he has been rather pressured to make what could be
considered an uncharacteristic decision. But he admitted these two bids did
raise competition concerns, hence the referral.
It is the first time any of the bids in the electricity sector have been sent
to the MMC following the wave of takeover activity that has swept the industry,
not least from outside the UK.
In fact, Mr Lang earlier this month overruled the advice of the new
director-general of fair trading, John Bridgeman, and cleared North West
Water's #1800m bid for Manchester-based electricity distributor, Norweb. Mr
Bridgeman had recommended referral to the MMC. But it seems the Minister has
now drawn the line. And not before time.
No spree
APART from a few short-lived pockets in the year, the domestic retail
environment has been tough and if anything has recently shown signs of becoming
even more competitive. Consumers remain reluctant to go on a collective
shopping spree. This presents retailers with a problem because many of them
have grown fat in the past on the back of buoyant consumer spending and higher
selling prices.
Such paths to increased profitability no longer exist and may indeed be lost
for ever. Consumer spending is not expected to recover strongly in the months
ahead, despite the fact that billions of pounds are to be released in the new
year from the expiration of Tax Exempt Special Savings Schemes (Tessas). Having
acquired a nose for value for money merchandise, consumers show little signs of
giving it up.
If sales growth is to be smaller than in the past, costs have to be cut if
profits are to increase. Given that shop workers are not among the most highly
paid members of the workforce there is little scope to cut labour costs. The
supply chain is where many organisations are looking to streamline their costs.
Storehouse has joined Marks &amp; Spencer and Burton in seeking to concentrate on a
smaller number of key suppliers which provide around three-quarters of their
merchandise. These tend to be the larger suppliers, many of whom work for a
number of the major retailers.
The aim is to make the supply chain more responsive to customer demand. It is
early days yet for Storehouse but already its ``Breakthrough'' supply
initiative is starting to bear fruit in terms of better stock control and lower
markdowns.
The electronic revolution has provided an opportunity for retailers and their
suppliers to restructure traditional relationships, to speed up product
development and store replenishment, and to transform the accuracy and
efficiency of buying and merchandising processes.
This in turn enables retailers to provide customers with new standards of value
in terms of design, price, quality, and availability.
PFI problems
CBI Scotland has joined the long list of organisations expressing their concern
at the lack of progress in the Government's Private Finance Initiative, (PFI).
The organisation's new director, Iain McMillan, has written to Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth, requesting action on the stalled PFI.
Members of CBI Scotland are still reporting considerable difficulties with the
PFI. Mr McMillan says that some major infrastructure projects have slowed
dramatically because of PFI considerations. He added that despite earlier
substantial progress on the M74 project, there is little sign of construction
activity between the completed northern and southern sections.
The PFI was meant to breathe new life into the moribund construction sector but
has failed to live up to earlier expectations, with many projects tied up in
red tape. Accountancy firms and construction groups have have said what they
think needs to be done to kickstart the initiative. Namely, for the Government
to pick out a number of flagship projects and effectively manage them.
While there are no shortage of firms willing and able to participate in the PFI
they need some organising. It is unrealistic and short-sighted to expect them
to plan and instigate major infrastructure projects which have strategic
economic importance

IN liberal democracies most people balance any resentment about paying taxes
with the acceptance of their necessity to meet collective need, from defence to
welfare. All existing systems have however grown up over time and, in Britain
in particular, it seems hard to institute much root and branch reform. Every
tax has its defenders as well as its victims and any change which moves
attention away from the last, is as likely to re-focus it elsewhere: the
Revenue has to feed a persistent hunger and it can hardly be surprising that
its attention is concentrated in extracting more from all existing sources
rather than on making these more rational and efficient. Yet the present
structure of UK taxation is both complex and confusing. It is fortunate that
millions are not expected to make tax returns, for they have a nightmarish
aspect which forces many to employ others (expensively) in their compilation.
The onset of self-assessment is likely to make matters worse in this respect,
however; and the draconian impositions now at the disposal of the Inland
Revenue may yet breed a far more hostile response to the whole business.
The onset of the Budget is a good time to give such matters an airing. It would
make many lives, politicians', administrators' including tax officials'; but
also taxpayers', easier if the tax system were simplified. That is especially
true of income tax which may now produce much less than half the revenues but
still impacts most on everyone's consciousness. The way in which the tax and
benefits systems interact sometimes means, for example, that some individuals
in effect encounter tax rates of 80%, now widely recognised to be destructive.
A thorough reform would disentangle the two systems as they at present
interact, though it would be even more desirable to integrate them, a
dispensation which seems, so far, to have been found practically impossible,
although the Lib Dems still champion it in theory. We certainly ought to take
millions out of the tax net altogether, and keep them out. Most Budgets do take
large numbers out but the phenomenon known as fiscal drag inexorably brings
them back. Low inflation and modest earnings increases may keep them out now.
Several tax bands make for complexity. Labour's new 10% band is an error as is
the partial switch to 20% from 25% on which the Conservatives are engaged,
while retaining 40% as a top (to which Labour might add a new 50% rate). The
fewer the separate rates the better; and changes should have the effect of
taking taxpayers out of the net altogether rather than merely complicating the
arithmetic all have to endure when additional rates are introduced.
Somewhat similar logic should apply to tax concessions designed to add to the
attractions of various activities the state would wish to encourage, from
direct saving to home ownership. This is quite apart from the way in which the
tax system, in its corporate form, is supposed to encourage investment. The
outcome produces huge volumes of paper work; but can sometimes have other more
beneficial effects. The question is whether it is worth the candle. The
abolition of tax relief on insurance premiums did not for long damage the
British propensity to buy endowments. Mortgage tax relief has seriously
distorted the housing market, though its reconstruction in recent times has
suffered the most unfortunate timing. The benefits of house ownership should
not be skewed by considerations of tax: indeed the basic rate, whatever it was,
could be lowered if this practice could ever be abolished.
As for encouraging savings there are many devices apart from tax relief that
could be utilised. The difficulty has to be faced in all of these areas -
income tax is seen as almost as much a social agent of redistribution as much
as a source of revenue (hence our desire to keep some onerous taxes which raise
little revenue). The two aims can run in tandem but the main aim is to raise
money fairly, in order to spend it wisely. That must mean reform. Too many poor
people pay income tax (sometimes at astonishing rates) and everyone's liability
is complicated by a clutch of exceptions and special provisions.

MOST of us will suffer inconvenience if the postal dispute remains intractable
but for Scottish business the effects will be serious and long-lasting. For
this reason, if for no other, the heads of all those involved should be
collectively banged together. If that implies that both parties to the argument
appear culpable it is clear that this is the growing perception. The role of
the postal workers in the unofficial industrial action is the most obvious
element and it cannot be emphasised sufficiently how wrong they are. The law
affecting industry and the relations between management and workers is not the
happiest piece of legislation ever framed. Although nobody wishes to return to
the days of free-for-all strike action when workers walked from their jobs at
the slightest provocation, and sometimes with no provocation at all, the
current law is not equitable and badly needs to be reviewed.
Disputes become heated because of the difficulty of achieving legal industrial
action and penalties against even innocent unions are grossly punitive.
Nevertheless, it is the law and as such should be respected and followed until
it is changed, not least because of the legal and financial repercussions.
Unofficial action will not advance the cause of the postal workers one whit,
and this has been made abundantly clear to them by their union which is
justifiably worried about what will happen if it cannot demonstrate its
innocence in all that has taken place. The actions of Royal Mail management in
the dispute appear equally open to criticism. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce
said yesterday that what has happened is a sad reflection on modern management
and employee relationships; the comments of the Scottish Chambers go straight
to the heart of the problem. In preparation for privatisation the management of
the Royal Mail invested heavily in new technology with the aim of cost cutting.
This was combined with a management style which demonstrated implacable
determination to get its own way, with obvious effects on the level of stress
and uncertainty imposed on the people in the organisation. Royal Mail workers
are not noted for militancy but unofficial stoppages doubled in the past two
years, apparently as a direct result of the new style of management. Much of
what the Royal Mail leadership says can be excused, of course, on the grounds
of efficiency. It may be more efficient to move the bulk of postal deliveries
to the morning, and management may be utterly truthful when it says that there
is no intention to remove the noon post. But at what level will the noon post
run, and if it is reduced, what are the implications for this in terms of
employment, be it full or part-time?
It is becoming clear that over-powerful management in British industry is
beginning to result in diminishing returns. Management and workers in the Royal
Mail, faced with growing competition, must work together or they will not work
at all.

SCOTRAIL'S efforts to rent a few more nearly new diesel trains (apparently
surplus to South of England's needs) may offer a marginal improvement to the
woefully inadequate Sprinter railcars whose 50-minute Glasgow-Edinburgh
schedules are now seven minutes slower than achieved in 1975.
But why the silence and lack of push for early electrification of Scotland's
most intensively used Capital Cities route, which carries nearly eight million
passengers per annum?
Electrification and some modest upgrading of our country's finest engineered
route could achieve the crucial 30-35 minute station-to-station journey time
necessary if rail is to become more attractive relative to ongoing motorway
improvements, eg, nearly #300m for recent/proposed M77, M8, M74 extensions.
With a pathetic 23% of our rail network improved by electrification, Scotland
now ranks almost bottom of a 20-nation European league table - a curiosity
corner out of step with the worldwide railway renaissance taking place around
us.
ScotRail and Railtrack must forcefully remind this Government over the justice
and more enduring benefits of electrifying the Glasgow-Edinburgh line,
deserving of more than just another quick-fix with improved diesel trains.

COUNCILLOR Margaret Murray is right when she says the Labour Party campaigned
vigorously to have the Parliamentary Register of Members' Interests improved.
She is wrong when she asserts that Labour is silent on having principles
applied to local government.
Last year the Prime Minister announced the setting up of the Nolan Inquiry into
standards in public life and its terms of reference. These terms of reference
included ``elected members and senior officers of local authorities'' and
``members and senior officers of all non-departmental public bodies'' (Hansard
October 25, column 758). The Parliamentary Labour Party, far from being silent,
supported the setting up of the Nolan Inquiry, supported in full its terms of
reference, supported the total application of its recommendations in respect of
Members of Parliament, and succeeded in persuading the Commons, despite the
Prime Minister's opposition, to adopt full disclosure on earnings from
consultancies. Councillor Murray should inform herself of the facts before
rushing into print.

TWO of your correspondents describe Arthur Scargill as courageous.
Many readers will say that a more appropriate description would be foolhardy.
Arthur Scargill succeeded Joe Gormley as general secretary of the NUM whose
wise leadership greatly strengthened the unions. I often wondered at Joe
Gormley refraining from publicly criticising his successor. He must have been
sorely tempted to do so.
What a contrast between his brilliant and constructive leadership and Arthur
Scargill's performance, so tragic for the coal-mining industry.
He should gracefully retire from the trade union and Labour Party scene - the
best thing he could do for the cause of socialism.

(November 14).
I was particularly struck by your statement that Camelot's director of
operations admitted that there was little that Camelot could do to enforce the

Surely the logic of this would then require that they cease operating the

A GOOD example to illustrate Lawrence Kemp's point that rail fragmentation is
bad for the customer occurred recently at Larbert (November 17).
Glasgow to Inverness passengers were denied access to their onward train for 10
minutes after their connection had been terminated due to flooding.
Passengers waited on the platform in the pouring rain while permission was
sought from three control centres for the doors to be opened to let them on
board.
Apparently, Railtrack had omitted to tell InterCity East Coast that there were
problems on the tracks and ScotRail had not advised that passengers had been
detrained short of their normal transfer point of Stirling.
You also report that Railtrack will now depend on road cranes to cover
derailments in future. Do they not realise that many Scottish rail routes run
through very boggy terrain? How would they get a road crane to the middle of
Rannoch Moor?

Are ScotRail/Railtrack so removed from the actual facts that they are unaware

The route passes under the main Paisley/Renfrew road and bridges over Wright

SCOTTISH political history is obviously not one of Ian Doyle's stronger points
(November 16). A little research on the topic would have helped him to discover
that by 1979 Brian Wilson had long outgrown ``shortpants''.
During that year he was old enough to enjoy his propensity for sharing
political platforms with right-wing Tories in his crusade against Scottish
devolution.
Indeed, if Ian Doyle were to dig a little deeper he would also learn that his
own recent statements on the subject of Labour's current plans for a devolved
assembly were but a mild whimper compared to some of the stuff which emanated
from Brian Wilson's lips back in 1979.
Time does change some things and Brian Wilson, MP, now claims to support the
creation of a devolved assembly. Unfortunately, however, his support for Tony
Blair would indicate that he has still not lost his old admiration for some
right-wing Tories.

JACK WEBSTER'S article, Scots who made America dream, triggered memories of a
period I spent in Canada in the early 1970s (November 18).
I worked in a psycho-geriatric hospital in a place called Terrace, 1000 miles
north of Vancouver. Residents, elderly men from all over the world, with a fair
proportion from Scotland, had few local visitors, and no family contact.
Often they'd left their homeland when young, travelled extensively, had not
retained familial links, and eventually due to poor mental functioning were no
longer able to do so. Few had local connections to the town of Terrace, and
little of their history was known.
One resident, Jimmy McDonald, originally from Glasgow, was oblivious to those
around him, but constantly muttered, ``Celtic two, Rangers nil''. This was
generally ignored by residents, but on July 12 when everyone was treated to a
drink, arguments would ensue.
On one occasion quick action by staff prevented Jimmy from being hit over the
head by a walking stick by an irate English inmate.
Another Scotsmen was convinced that tap water was poisoned, so he would open a
valve from waterpipes along the road and drink his supply before water entered
the hospital system.
A well-spoken gentleman, a Jack Mackay from Stornoway, during a period of
lucidity gave me relatives' address in that town, asking me to get in touch
with them. He'd left when he was 15 years' old and never returned.
My inquiries drew a blank, but unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, Mr
Mackay's dementia deteriorated so he did not ask the outcome.
On visiting the remote small town of Hyder, on the Alaskan border, I came
across a cemetery where Scots names on gravestones were evident, but few
details given.
I'm sure that many at home in Scotland have wondered about the fate of those
who left never to return nor maintain contact.

This is misleading. What the developers are worried about is that they need so
much EU money to make this scheme viable that, unless they get in quickly,
Objective 1 tourism money will be used on other projects.
It would be much better if a number of smaller, more sustainable, projects
could be developed which spread both economic benefits and environmental

CURLING
SCOTLAND'S top curlers gather in Kilmarnock today for the first qualifying
steps towards the Winter Olympics, while Foresthills, in Aberfoyle, will host
one of the most important club level events on the calendar with the Calor Gas
Province championships being staged there.
Six Scottish teams, in both men's and women's divisions, will go on to the ice
at Kilmarnock along with representatives from both the English and Welsh
Curling Associations. By the end of the weekend's round-robin play, the eight
teams currently in the Olympic preparation squads will be whittled down to six.
The Scottish men's teams involved include those skipped by Gordon Muirhead,
current Scottish champion and world silver medallist; Hammy McMillan, reigning
European champion; and Tom Brewster, the current world junior champion. The top
women's skips include Kirsty Hay, Jackie Lockhart, and Claire Milne.
The 1998 Winter games in Nagano, Japan, is the first time that curling will be
a full Olympic sport and this momentous move has helped create the British
Curling Association to supervise British team selection.
Earlier this year, the selection procedures being proposed by the BCA were a
major topic of disquiet at the annual meeting of The Curlers Association, a
players' organisation that includes many of the top internationalists, but
since then, relative peace has broken out with both sides glad to agree that
all selection action will take place on the ice.

As the debate grows over mad cow disease and the dangers of chewing the fat,
Victoria Freedman weighs up the arguments for vegetarianism
Being vegetarian doesn't necessarily mean they will be eating healthily
THE recent investigation into the death of a farmer from an incurable brain
disorder has refuelled debate over whether Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human
equivalent of BSE - bovine spongiform encephalo-pathy, also known as mad cow
disease - is proving to be a bigger threat than has been officially admitted.
It could be that the disease can be transmitted to humans handling cattle feed
containing infected sheep offal - or simply through eating the meat.
No more appealing is poultry where chickens or turkeys have been artificially
fattened, the birds unable to support their own weight.
Perhaps, the argument runs, we had better become vegetarians - but recently it
emerged that some vegetarian meals, including Linda McCartney's Beefless
Burgers, contain an excessive amount of fat, almost twice that stated on the
packet. And doesn't cheese have a higher fat content than meat?
The question is whether vegetarianism is as healthy as we have been led to
believe. If consumers are not concerned, they might certainly feel confused,
unsure of which diet to follow and which of the organisations representing meat
eaters and vegetarians is to be believed.
On BSE, Alistair Donaldson, general manager for Scotland of the Meat and
Livestock Commission, says: ``The position is clear cut. It's an animal health
problem. There is absolutely no scientific evidence of linkage between BSE and
CJD.''
That is so, there is no definitive evidence. Yet there is undeniably reason for
confusion since microbiologist Professor Richard Lacey believes it is more than
99% certain that mad cow disease has spread to humans. ``Whatever the
powers-that-be claim, CJD and BSE are one and the same,'' he says.
Retired neuropathologist Sir Bernard Tomlinson says he had changed his mind and
was now ``far from certain'' that the disease could not be transmitted.
The nutritional value of meat far outweighs any remote risk of CJD, but many
people give up meat for ethical rather than health reasons. Methods of rearing
pigs, and production practices in general, anger many vegetarians.
``The idea that sows and litters running outdoors are more welfare-friendly is
absurd,'' says Alistair Donaldson. ``There are weather problems, pests such as
foxes, and contamination by seagulls which are carriers of a whole heap of
diseases.''
He points out that the level of prosecutions for abuse against domestic pets
far exceeds that of farm animals and that production practices are
independently monitored.
Similarly, there is a range of legislation and policing regarding slaughtering.
The use of hormones has been banned since 1988 and the use of antibiotics, for
health reasons, is also governed by regulations.
Donaldson adds: ``As for the belief that animals are fed or bred unnaturally -
I think that relates to the concept of genetic engineering and I'm sure the
industry will look at ways to harness it to the advantage of production but not
the abuse of animals.
``We have to dispel the image of an industry that is mischievous and has ill
intent, run by monsters out to do nothing but make money. What is produced has
to be produced competitively, but farmers are certainly not making fat
profits.''
Around 97% of the population are meat eaters, he claims, and if beef
consumption has been reduced it is due to agricultural-support policies which
have affected supplies. ``If it's not there, you can't eat it.''
If it is there, John Carlisle will certainly eat it. ``I don't feel guilty that
animals are bred to be eaten. I look at sheep in fields when I'm driving but I
don't think of the lamb on my plate,'' says the 34-year-old father of two young
children.
``I wish humans didn't try to change nature for the sake of producing bigger
animals more quickly, but nothing would persuade me to give up meat. I believe
my body needs it. It gives me energy.''
Carlisle would accept any decision by his children to become vegetarian but
presently encourages them to eat as he does, and that includes meat surrounded
by fat.
``Unless I have evidence that it alone definitely produces heart disease then I
will continue to eat it,'' he says. ``I've always been very healthy and never
overweight.''
But then so has Joy Hamilton, aged 78, from Edinburgh who has been a vegetarian
for 40 years - a perfect advert for the claim that vegetarians suffer 30% less
heart disease and a 40% reduced risk of cancer.
As a child she disliked the idea of ``eating dead flesh'' and became a complete
vegetarian when pregnant.
Hamilton, who has never needed to take a vitamin pill in her life, says:  ``It
isn't difficult to stay healthy providing you're replacing the protein in meat
and balancing proteins in meals such as beans on toast.''
A typical meal for her might be home-made vegetable soup with lentils and bread
followed by fresh fruit. ``You do have to spend more time cooking to eat
healthily,'' she concedes.
Both her children were boarders at the school she attended, St Christopher's in
Letchworth, a progressive co-ed and completely vegetarian.
``Funnily enough they both eat meat now - my son even married a girl whose
father was a butcher - but my grandchildren are vegetarian,'' says Hamilton.
``It's the thing now for young people. What worries me is the young girls who
become vegetarian thinking it is slimming or because pop stars do it - but
they're living on junk food.''
Julie Tomlinson, of the South East Scotland Vegetarian Society, agrees that not
all vegetarians eat sensibly. ``People become vegetarian for different reasons.
Some, like my sister, gave up red meat because they were shocked by how much
food we imported from Third World countries to feed our animals - such as
peanuts from Ethiopia at the height of the famine there. Or they feel that land
should be put to other uses. Some become vegetarian for economic reasons. But
it doesn't necessarily mean they will be eating healthily.''
Indeed, according to a report by the Food Commission, an independent consumer
association, several manufacturers of ready-made vegetarian meals use a kind of
vegetable fat at least as dangerous as saturated fat.
``We also thought manufacturers were cashing in on the growing interest in
vegetarianism,'' says Sue Dibbs, commission co-director. ``We were quite
surprised by how expensive many of the ready-made meals were - especially when
we looked at the ingredients, which were not terribly expensive.''
Eman Nakshabendi, senior dietician at Glasgow's Royal Maternity Hospital,
believes that the advice given to pregnant women should apply to the whole
family.
They divide food into groups and believe the main part of the diet should come
from the bread, pasta and rice group, accompanied by fresh fruit and
vegetables, at least three times a day.
Food that should be eaten moderately includes meat, chicken, fish, eggs and
dairy products. Food to be limited are those with sugar and hidden fat - such
as pies, chocolate and processed items.
As it is harder to absorb iron from vegetables than from meat, pregnant women,
children and teenagers who are vegetarian are advised to increase the Vitamin C
content in their diet by eating more food and raw vegetables, and to drink a
pint of milk a day.
``It's not a question of good and bad food but good and bad habits,'' she says.
``For example we would advise people to grill their burgers instead of frying
them, to cut down on fat. We would never say you should or shouldn't eat meat,
both can be healthy, in the same way we wouldn't say don't eat chocolate. After
all, eating is also something that should be enjoyed.''

ELECTRICITY share prices tumbled yesterday after President of the Board of
Trade Ian Lang announced he was referring PowerGen's #1900m bid for Midlands
Electricity and National Power's #2800m offer for Southern Electric to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Midlands Electricity fell 59p to 918p and Southern Electric by 62p to 913p. The
bids automatically lapse on referral.
Mr Lang said he had decided to refer the PowerGen and National Power bids to
the MMC because he considered that each raised competition concerns in the
generation and supply of electricity.
``In general, I do not believe that vertical integration is inherently
objectionable whether in the electricity industry or elsewhere,'' he added.
``However, in these two cases, the structural change proposed could have an
effect on the development of competition in the industry.''
Both bids had virtually been triggered by the Government's decision on the
advice of the Office of Fair Trading not to refer Scottish Power's hostile bid
for Manweb to the MMC. Mr Lang at the time said that the industry regulator
could make licence changes to satisfy concerns raised by vertical integration.
Undertakings signed by ScottishPower included agreeing not to sign contracts to
supply Manweb with electricity and to make clear to customers which company
they were dealing with, and also that Manweb sold its stake in National Grid
when it is floated.
At the time there had been strong speculation that the ScottishPower bid, the
first by a power generator for a distributor, was most likely to be put before
the MMC. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator had wanted the
bid referred.
Yesterday's referral of the two bids - the MMC is required to report on its
findings by March 22 - was followed by a statement from National Power that it
was concerned whether as a result of the competition issues in relation to
generation and supply to which the Secretary of State's announcement referred,
its proposed sale of 4000 megawatts of power plants, which it was close to
securing, could be completed as planned.
The industry regulator had threatened both National Power and PowerGen with a
monopolies inquiry unless they disposed of a substantial amount of their
generating capacity.
The MMC investigation now means that the whole situation will be looked at
afresh. National Power had expected to complete the plant sale by March 31
having selected a buyer by the end of December as agreed with the regulator.
Representatives of electricity consumers have been demanding a monopoly enquiry
from the time the bids were made some two months ago though it was felt that
the Government was far less concerned, particularly given that ScottishPower
had been allowed to go ahead with its bid for Manweb, albeit after making the
aforementioned guarantees.
The Government all along has insisted that it was not against vertical
integration in principle and the two generating companies had been confident,
at least in the earlier stages, that the bids would be waved through.
While there are differences between the ScottishPower Manweb situation -
vertical integration was already in play in Scotland - and other issues could
be decided by agreement with the authorities, as proved to be the case, it is
difficult to see why Mr Lang has decided to act tough now.
Unless he feels that geographically and in other respects, it would not be
enough to just seek assurances. Either that or he is proving that the
electricity industry is not a free for all despite what has gone on before.

LYONNAISE des Eaux duly launched its expected bid for Northumbrian Water
yesterday and the agreed deal values the group at #823m.
Shareholders will receive 1179p cash per share, including a special 14p net
dividend. They will also be paid the interim dividend of 11p already declared.
There is a loan note alernative.
Northumbrian said the price was ``four to five times ahead of any other in the
sector and at a 40% premium to the rest of the sector, we believe we achieved a
significantly better price for shareholders by accepting Lyonnaise's offer''.
The French water group said it would be creating a strong North-east
England-based group which should create ``significant employment and investment
opportunities in the region''. It promised that there would be no compulsory
redundancies.
Northumbrian claims to be one of the best water groups in Britain. It says it
has the lowest levels of leakage and has made the greatest efficiency gains
during the last 18 months.
The group is also well known for owning the Kielder Reservoir, which is the
largest man-made lake in Europe. Lyonnaise already owns the adjacent company,
North East Water, which has 1,400,000 customers, and aims to make savings by
combining the two operations.
``Northumbrian and our local water company, North East Water, already work
together in a number of areas and we strongly believe that merging our UK water
interests with Northumbrian will strengthen both businesses,'' said Jerome
Monod, chairman of Lyonnaise.
The French utility has been interested in Northumbrian for some time and was
finally given the go-ahead to bid by the Government earlier this month, so long
as prices were cut by 15% over the next six years.
``We believe that the terms agreed for the acquisition of Northumbrian by
Lyonnaise fully reflect the value and unique qualities of our company,'' said
chairman Sir Frederick Holliday.
Northumbrian deals with all the sewerage waste from the Scottish Border to
Teesside, serving 2,600,000 customers. It also provides drinking water to
1,200,000 customers.
Lyonnaise also owns the smaller Essex and Suffolk water companies and these
will be joined together in the new company called Northumbrian Water Group.
``We will retain the Northumbrian Water name and the new group will build on
the considerable strengths of the two companies to provide levels of customer
service which are unmatched in the rest of the country,'' said a Lyonnaise
spokesman.
n NORTH West Water, the British water company in the process of buying
neighbouring electricity distributor Norweb, on Thursday announced a 22% rise
in pre-tax profits in the first half to September 30.
NWW posted profits of #167m compared with #136.8m in the first half last year.
It raised its interim dividend 11% to 9.27p per share, having already announced
and paid a special 3.8p per share special dividend funded by efficiency gains.
Chairman Brian Staples warned that NWW intended to sue The Times newspaper over
a report alleging the company had supplied water contaminated with sewage to
700,000 cutomers, unless the paper retracts the story and apologises.
NWW, which will change its name to United Utilities from January 1, said the
period ahead will be demanding as it tries to deliver and even exceed the
benefits it said would derive from the Norweb acquisition.
``Our early examination of the business has confirmed the robustness of our
assumptions and nothing has fallen short of our expectations,'' Mr Staples said.
Following controversy over supply restrictions during last summer's drought,
NWW said these were no longer ``palatable'' to customers and it pledged to
greatly reduce the likelihood of water cuts.

THE director of investment capital group 3i's Glasgow office since 1990, Willie
Watt, is to become director in charge of the entire Scottish operation on
December 1.
This newly-created role gives Mr Watt, 36, overall charge of the three Scottish
offices in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen, a seat on the group's six-strong
British management board and UK-wide responsibility for independent,
family-managed businesses in 3i's portfolio. He will continue to be based in
Glasgow.
Mr Watt says his new role will enable 3i in Scotland to act as a unified
business - reflecting the trend among advisers and competitors - while
maintaining local decision making and service across the three regional
offices. ``All three offices will remain fully resourced to handle the whole
spectrum of investments from start-ups to large MBOs,'' he said.
Two areas where the more unified approach will be quickly felt are emerging
technologies, capable of rapid growth, where a Scotland-wide expertise will be
established, and the Government's private finance initiative, where 3i is keen
to help plug the shortage of equity but the average deal size is likely to be
significant.
Mr Watt, who joined 3i from Aberdeen University in 1984, says 3i Scotland is
anxious to segment its own marketplace before competitors do the job for it.
Thirty years ago, its predecessor ICFC had 100% of its market. Now that market
share - investments in 286 Scottish companies valued at #242m - is between 50%
and 60%.

GLENMORANGIE malt distiller Macdonald Martin is seeing the first fruits of its
reorganisation programme, which has helped boost first half operating profits
by 32% to #4.12m.
This was achieved on turnover up 10% at #18.1m, with the impetus coming from
rising volumes as price increases prove difficult to achieve.
Malt accounted for just over 40% of turnover with Glenmorangie volumes up 4%
and undisclosed profitability 10% greater.
The US, German, Italian, and Dutch markets were outperformers while Japan was
dull. French markets continue to be uncertain.
At home, Glenmorangie - volume up 3% - remains market leader in both Scotland
and the UK with a 14% share, although it is being pressed hard by the United
Distillers Classic Six selection.
The blends saw good performances from the Martins 20-Year-Old in Portugal and
from Bailie Nicol Jarvie, which is at the top of the premium blends and priced
about #1 higher than Highland's Famous Grouse.
The standard blends had a tough time due to the continuing polarisation of the
market between the own labels and the premium end. In export markets, there was
a downturn in volume due to the hiatus caused by a change in distributor in the
United States.
However, this is not a particularly significant part of the overall business in
terms of profitability.
Sales of new fillings amounted to perhaps #1.5m but profitability is coming
under pressure because of rising malted barley costs. But the likely price
recovery looks fairly minimal at just 1p on a 150p listed price per litre.
Macdonald Martin is spending heavily on product promotion which is taking some
of the cream from profits in the short term. It is also looking ever harder
into Asia where Highland Queen is a market leader in the Indian bottled
scotches although that led to a #125,000 half time loss as the market is
developed. And there are expectations that a deal should be completed soon in
China.
Nearer home, the #11m investment in the recently acquired Broxburn plant will
add 50 people to the current 200 strong payroll. The development will bring
about substantial savings with some #500,000 annually from bringing all group
stocks into the one complex while offering superior bottling facilities once
the capital programme is completed.
The sale of the Commercial Street premises in Leith to Forth Ports brought in
#1.9m of which there was a net #499,000 gain after allowing for repairs to
Broxburn.
That surplus helped boost pre-tax profits by 52% to #4.02m with last year's
figure being depressed by #440,000 of exceptional reorganisation charges.
Chairman Geoffrey Maddrell is expecting real profit growth in the second half,
albeit at a slower rate than in the first six months.
Analysts are pencilling in a full year total raised from #5.71m to about #6.6m.
That points to the A shares at 645p trading at around 19 times likely earnings.
The interim dividend has been raised 10% to 275p with 12p probable for the year
for a 2.3% yield.

IT was billed as a party for the doyen of Scottish poets. And Norman MacCaig
was there - a tall rather frail figure now, but still with that imperious head.
What a gift of nature not only to be, but so completely look, the poet! A
sell-out audience of more than 500 greeted him like a pop star in the foyer.
He stayed the silent centre of attention. Others read from his works. They gave
a fair taste of his laconic style and deadly wit, from No Choice (``I think
about you/in as many ways as rain comes'') to his skewering of the Street
Preacher (``He howls outside my window. He howls about God'').
But the evening turned out to be rather a giant cabaret by fellow Scottish
poets. The night-club ambience was helped by the audience's sitting at tables
rather than in pious ranks. And if the corner bar kept up a ground base of
clinking through the proceedings, it was perhaps more disconcerting than
disrespectful to the man who penned the Ballade of Good Whisky.
Joy Hendry of Chapman and Dolina Maclennan commred. Their shepherd's crook to
haul off longwinded contributors was not needed. Douglas Dunn acted as
warmer-up with a poem about school dinners. Brian McCabe pursued darker themes
in his funny food poems.
Sorley MacLean, looking rather fierce, rendered two poems uncompromisingly in
Gaelic. Liz Lochhead was pawky about pawkies and much else. Adam McNaughtan
sang his comic reprise of Hamlet. In an equally sonorous voice, Hamish
Henderson provoked the audience's deepest response with his Free Mandela
rallying cry to a Spanish Civil War tune.
The Boys of the Lough and piper Allan MacDonald made music classily.

EVEN though it was the morning after the night before, world rally champion
Colin McRae had dried out enough brain cells to think reasonably and look to
the future by appealing for his sport to be given the recognition it deserves
and also suggesting Formula One might be his next challenge.
It is thought moves in that direction might already have been made on behalf of
the 27-year-old Scot, and if he should feel now that having become the first
Briton and the youngest ever winner of the world rally championship he needs a
greater adrenalin rush he won't have far to look for assistance. One of his
neighbours in Monaco is fellow-Scot David Coulthard, and he said yesterday he
would be more than happy to offer any assistance and advice.
Coulthard, who has just finished his first full F1 season and has left Williams
for McLaren, believes McRae could make the transition if he so desires. ``I
would welcome Colin into F1 and although you can't really compare our cars with
rally cars, success depends a great deal on confidence and experience and Colin
has both qualities,'' Coulthard said.
``His achievement in becoming world champion is absolutely brilliant. It is
excellent and you have to say he is up there with Michael Schumacher. Michael
currently is the guy who does it best in F1, but Colin is the best in rallying.
``As far as I am concerned a world champion is a world champion and I'm sure we
will be meeting when Colin gets back here to Monaco. He lives just across the
harbour, which makes us virtually neighbours, so no doubt we'll be going down
to the pub for a celebration, even if it is an English pub.''
McRae made it clear yesterday, the day after his Network Q RAC Rally triumph,
that he would relish the opportunity to drive a F1 car, and pointed out: ``I
like fast cars and the F1 car is probably the fastest you can get. I would love
to try one.''
Coulthard, who had a traumatic season, was enjoying his last few days ``just
chilling out'' before beginning testing work with McLaren-Mercedes next week
and he added that it should not be too difficult for McRae to secure a test
drive. ``If there was any way I could help him I would and I have to say it is
probably easier for a driver of a two-seater car to switch to a single than the
other way around,'' said Coulthard, who finished third in the F1 drivers'
championship behind Schumacher and Damon Hill.
``If someone can drive a car which always seems to be out of control he would
be able to handle one which, while quicker, is much more controlled,''
Coulthard added. ``I drove an Escort Cosworth rally car recently, but it felt
unnatural the way it slithered around corners.
``My environment is much more controlled, but also much faster. Everything
happens quicker in F1 but you always feel you have more control of the car even
if it can get up to a speed of around 210mph at a circuit like Hockenheim.''
McRae insists no formal moves have been made regarding a switch of cars and
circuits, but the challenge has great appeal. ``I wouldn't mind giving it a
try,'' he said, ``but it may never happen.''
McRae, who divides his time between homes in Monaco, Switzerland, and Lanark,
then asked that rallying be given the coverage he believes it merits,
stressing: ``Rallying is on a par with F1, but we don't get the same coverage
as grands prix although we are getting closer and closer.
``However, I hope my victory will raise the status of rallying because a sport
tends to be given more attention in a country which has the world champion.''
His #3000 prize for defending his RAC crown - less #1075 in fines for speeding
on the ``recce'' of the course - is loose change compared with the several
million pounds Schumacher picked up in bonuses for winning the F1 title.
McRae's salary is unlikely ever to match that of the German's reported
#15m-a-year deal with Ferrari. However, McRae's own contract negotiations are
sure to be strengthened by his lofty new status.
McRae-mania was quickly apparent at Chester on Wednesday when several thousand
people - the rally was watched by more than two million - packed the racecourse
to hail the hero after his victory over Carlos Sainz, his team-mate and rival.
There was friction between the two Subaru drivers after the Scot was ordered to
let the Spaniard win on the last day of the Catalonian rally - the team wanted
both their drivers to go into the RAC level on points to secure the
manufacturers' prize - but yesterday McRae said the bad feeling had subsided.
He could afford to be magnanimous, but McRae's willingness to forget was a
further measure of his maturity as a sportsman, who seems destined to collect
more championships if he decides to remain in rallying.
``Colin has proved that not only does he have the talent, but also that he can
control it,'' said his co-driver, Derek Ringer. ``At times on the rally he
raised his level to a point which defied definition. He has been so committed
yet so relaxed. He found his own pace.''
Where that pace, the astounding speed at which he can drive a car around dirt
and tarmac, will take him now remains to be seen. He says he can win the rally
title again, but F1 is the ultimate in speed and another Scot in that business
would do the image of this nation no harm at all.

Interims  1995       1994
Pre-tax profit #19.2m      #2.8m
Turnover #393.7m     #348.9m
EPS  10.77p       0.85p
Dividend 1.25p       nil
BABCOCK International, which is on its way to becoming the new owner of Rosyth
naval dockyard, has boosted its profits at the half-way stage with the sale of
its energy division to Mitsui of Japan.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 rocketed seven-fold to
#19.2m as a result of the sale.
This gave the group sufficient confidence to pay an interim dividend of 1.25p,
its first half-year payout since 1992.
However, the #26m net gain from the sale of a 75% stake in Babcock Energy to
Mitsui was partially offset by a #9m charge for cutting back loss-making
operations in Germany.
The group's manufacture of cement handling equipment in Germany has been hit by
the strong mark and about 200 local employees are being laid off.
Stripping out exceptional items, operational profits fell to #2.2m from #2.8m,
leading Babcock shares to fall 12p to 149p.
Nevertheless, chairman John Parker was confident that Babcock had turned the
corner and had set itself on course for a more profitable future.
``Following the sale of Energy, group management is now in a position to
concentrate fully on the strategic development of other core businesses and we
now have significant financial resources to fund our plans,'' he said.
Much of Babcock's #33m of cash balances are likely to be invested in purchasing
the dockyard at Rosyth, which is expected to fetch #20m to #25m.
Babcock already manages the Rosyth yard, which is currently engaged in the
refit of two nuclear submarines and could be in line for further submarine
contracts in view of safety problems at its rival Devonport near Plymouth.
Babcock has been negotiating to buy the Rosyth dockyard for a year, but these
talks have been held up by the problems at Devonport, which is also up for
privatisation. Nevertheless, Babcock hopes to complete the purchase by March.
The company is also part of the Rosyth 2000 consortium, which has been declared
preferred bidder for privatisation of adjacent port facilities at Rosyth which
have just been vacated by the Royal Navy.
Babcock has a 25% stake in Rosyth 2000, alongside Forth Ports, ScottishPower,
and the Bank of Scotland.
Negotiations for the purchase of the 355-acre site, which is due to be
converted into a commercial port and industrial site, should also be completed
in March. The price tag is thought to be around #20m.
Further down the line, Babcock also has its eyes on the future privatisation of
Portsmouth dockyard.
Following the sale of its energy division, which includes factories making
power station equipment at Dumbarton and Renfrew, Babcock is concentrating on
the management of facilities such as Rosyth and the manufacture of equipment
for handling bulk materials ranging from timber to grain and cement, and the
repair and maintenance of railway rolling stock.
It has formed a joint venture with Siemens called Railcare, which last June
bought the Springburn railway workshops in Glasgow and a similar facility at
Wolverton near Milton Keynes.
Despite limp reaction to the company's interim results, Broker Tilney is
maintaining its forecast for full-year pre-tax profits of around #19.5m.

THE highly successful Lottery has passed its first anniversary. It brings two
thoughts immediately to mind. First, that a personal win is long overdue;
second, to distribute the Lottery money in our own way, to our own good causes.
As far as sport is concerned, the arrangements were set by Parliament. Scotland
receives around nine per cent of the Lottery money allocated to sport. This is
distributed by a special committee of the Scottish Sports Council.
They have done their job wisely, and spread the money both geographically and
to where the need is most urgent.
With the exception of the Millennium Fund, Parliament made it very clear that
the distributing committees, whether they be sport, the arts, charities, or the
heritage, should be absolutely clear of any ministerial or Governmental
influence. The Government also made it clear Lottery money should be over and
above the normal funding by departments.
So far so good. But I think we should have a rethink and a change of emphasis.
There must be a greater flexibility in the award system. The Sports Council has
a guideline - not a requirement - that grants should be matched by a 50% input
by the applicant. That is a reasonable approach, but it is restrictive in that
the Sports Council can only fund capital projects, and not support a body
through revenue funding. Applications can only be for buildings and facilities
and not for running costs.
This is open to argument and as time passes, I am sure there will be a change.
The sooner the better. This is essential if we are to help individuals as so
clearly set out by Craig Reedie a few weeks ago. The Sports Aid Foundation, the
Sports Council, the Foundation for Sport, and the Arts, help where they can,
but it is at the level just below the top - the emerging stars, without
sponsorship, who need assistance in many sports. From here will come our
successes, if not at the Olympics at the next Commonwealth Games.
It is also essential if some of our capital projects are to be serviced. A
swimming pool is an obvious candidate. Running costs are high and even with
local authority assistance, support would be required from the Lottery.
I believe too, and I certainly was not allowed to suggest it to the Sports
Council or the Millennium Commission, that in the sporting field there are two
projects above all else that the Scottish public want to see.
A completed Hampden Park with the new stand, medical centre, library and other
facilities, and the final touches to Murrayfield.
Yes, we want the forests, canals, museums and sports grounds already approved,
but I think the Scottish people want us to have the two finest national
stadiums in the United Kingdom.
Together they could cost another #20m, but they would be an important factor in
any application for a major world event to go alongside the excellent
facilities of Edinburgh and Glasgow.
It may mean holding back on some small projects now, but in the long run, it
could be best for Scotland.
The Lottery has succeeded beyond our dreams. Now let us have a pause for
thought leading to greater flexibility, and the achievement of even greater
successes in the future.

IN a quiet week for local sporting events, details have been issued of the
Scottish Motor Racing Club's 1996 season. It includes all the race meetings at
Knockhill except for the British Touring Car Championship weekend and a BRSCC
event in June, and also takes in two meetings at Croft near Darlington.
The season opens at Knockhill on April 7, continues with Croft on the 20th,
then returns to Knockhill on April 28 and May 26. The second Croft visit is on
June 8, and the later Knockhill meetings are on June 30, August 11, September
1, September 22, and October 6.
Road saloons, road sports cars and Formula Ford will all have their own
championships. There have been almost 100 enquiries about the new Escort and
Fiesta XR Saloon Cup, which is a very heartening response. Historic Ecosse
drivers will have their 1996 outings - probably five at Knockhill and one at
Croft - formalised as a championship. Being there and finishing each race are
the most important things, because ten points are offered for starting and ten
more for finishing, compared with three, two and one for the first three
drivers in each class.

Arrol-Johnston is still an evocative name. ROSS FINLAY recalls its birth and
trip into motoring history
LAST month's feature on George Johnston's 1895 Panhard concentrated on him as a
pioneer private motorist. But he was also the founder of Arrol-Johnston, which
outlasted all the other original Scottish car manufacturers.
Johnston experimented for several years before actually going into production.
Two of his associates were so put out by the slow progress that in 1899 they
went off and founded Albion. He formed the Mo-Car Syndicate, and it was Sir
William Arrol's presence as one of its members which gave the car itself the
Arrol-Johnston name.
Arrol was one of the most highly regarded personalities in late Victorian
Scotland. A blacksmith turned brilliant civil engineer, he gained both a
knighthood and immense public esteem by building the Forth Bridge.
He was on the board of several engineering ventures, and was, for instance, a
founder director of Babcock and Wilcox in Renfrew. But the Arrol family recall
today that he took no direct part in the running of Johnston's company.
Arrol-Johnston's factory at Yate Street in the east end of Glasgow was
operational by 1901. Johnston favoured already obsolete styling with the driver
sitting high up in the centre of the car, passengers fore and aft.
The Yate Street works, a stock of part-completed cars and detailed company
records were all destroyed by a fire which broke out on the evening of May 8,
1901. The Coats family of Paisley, investors in the syndicate, offered the
disused Underwood Mill in the town as a replacement. Production restarted there
in 1902.
The late George Oliver, historian of the Scottish motor industry, had the
opportunity to drive an Arrol-Johnston of the original design. He was impressed
by the smooth operation of the very complex but effective horizontally-opposed
engine and also by the car's unexpectedly quiet running.
Sir William Lithgow owns an early Paisley-built Arrol-Johnston. He says it is
``not easy to drive, but very robust and can scamper along at 20mph. I was
advised that great difficulty was experienced in getting these engines to run
properly.
``I suspect that the biggest problem has been in understanding the
characteristics of the low-tension magneto, and timing the break to match the
voltage peak. The engine is started with a recoil system similar to a Flymo,
tricky if you have never tried to start a three-and-a-half litre Flymo.''
In 1905 William Beardmore of Parkhead Forge bought out the loss-making Mo-Car
Syndicate's original members and installed John Napier as managing director.
Johnston himself left.
Arrol-Johnston made a splash when one of its cars, modernised by Napier, won
the inaugural Tourist Trophy race on the Isle of Man. Napier himself drove the
winning car, beating no less a make than Rolls-Royce into second place.
The company continued losing money, though, a situation which changed very much
for the better in 1909 when T C Pullinger, with experience at Darracq, Sunbeam
and Humber, arrived as yet another new broom. He moved production to a new
factory at Heathhall on the outskirts of Dumfries, which is why this week's
Classic Car  (left) is a Doonhamer.
Post-war, business prospects for the smaller firms within the UK industry, as
mass production arrived, were bleak. In 1927 Arrol-Johnston merged with Asters
of Wembley. There are still some Arrol-Asters about, including one in the
Museum of Transport in Glasgow, sharing exhibition space with examples of
Beardmore and Galloway, other makes once part of the Arrol-Johnston group.
As the Depression loomed, publicity in connection with the company's rebuild of
Sir Malcolm Campbell's Bluebird made little impression. The liquidators arrived
in 1929, and the original indigenous Scottish motor industry was about to put
up the shutters.

IN March 1965 the famous Sword Collection was auctioned off at East Balgray
Farm near Torranyard in Ayrshire. One anonymous member of the Royal Scottish
Automobile Club bid successfully for the 1922 15.9hp Arrol-Johnston registered
DL 2560 - and promptly presented it to the club.
The Arrol-Johnston remains in the RSAC's ownership today, and is seen every
summer at vintage runs and parades all over the south of Scotland. This is its
home territory, because it was built at Arrol-Johnston's Heathhall factory on
the outskirts of Dumfries, now occupied by Gates Rubber.
Just as signficantly, it was bodied by the coachbuilders A C Penman, also of
Heathhall, and it is the successor company, Penman Engineering, which restored
the car, just before the Dumfries Octocentenary celebrations in 1986.
Managing director Edwin Hunter takes his turn at the wheel, but Ian Gray, a
supervisor at Penman Engineering, is its most regular driver, notching up 1500
miles in an average summer, when the car may take part in events at places like
Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Selkirk and Biggar.
Many people do a double take at the drophead body, because it does indeed have
only one door - on the front passenger's side - and the spare wheel is mounted
where the driver's door would normally be.
Gear lever and handbrake are to the driver's right, because there is no need
for an uncluttered door opening. Another notable feature is the three-piece
windscreen of unusual style for its time.
Ian Gray reckons the top speed with the 2613cc engine to be about 38mph, but
Arrol-Johnston built very torquey power units and believed in big flywheels. He
can leave Heathhall for Biggar, and stay in top gear all the way up the climb
past the Devil's Beef Tub on the A701.
Two features which take some getting used to are the central throttle pedal and
the rear-wheels-only brakes. Like many vintage car drivers, Ian Gray wishes
modern motorists, seeing the Arrol-Johnston, would make more allowances for it.
Once off the road for the winter, DL 2560 will stay under wraps at Penmans
until March. Then Ian Gray will simply put petrol in the Autovac, clean the
plugs and check the battery, and this sturdy vintage machine, in its 75th
season, will be raring to go.

Many a driver could
faint or scream when the whole expensive, catalytic truth comes out with the
new emission regulations, warns Ross Finlay
COME January, many people presenting their cars for an MOT test may either
faint or run screaming from the test centre on hearing the result. New emission
regulations come into force then, and it is dead certain that hundreds of cars
all over the UK will fail each year, because their catalytic converters are out
of action.
The point about these devices is that they either work or do not work. There is
no intermediate just-about-good-enough stage.
And the really bad news is that, if a car fails the test and cannot be issued
with a pass certificate until a new catalytic converter is fitted, then,
depending on the model of car and the size of the replacement converter, the
owner will be looking at a bill for a new unit of anything between #300 and
#800, and even higher in some cases.
Jim Corbett of Citroen Glasgow is one of the service managers who has been
looking closely at the implications of the Vehicle Inspectorate's new test
schedules. They include measuring four types of exhaust gases - carbon
monoxide, carbon dioxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and oxygen.
He has also been studying the results of a series of informal roadside tests
carried out in the south of England. As many as 15% of the vehicles examined
could not meet the 1996 requirements, many because their converters were
useless.
From workshop experience, he knows that there are two main reasons why a
converter fails. One is that an owner has put in a quantity of leaded petrol.
Admittedly, some converters will continue to work after a small amount of
leaded fuel has found its way into a tank otherwise filled with unleaded, but
the general rule is that lead wrecks converters.
It does happen that someone runs out of fuel in a converter-equipped car,
manages to get hold of a gallon can of fuel which turns out to be leaded, and
runs the car, perhaps just for a mile or so to a filling station, on a
part-tank of undiluted leaded petrol. In fact, running the tank dry will
probably ``kill'' the converter anyway.
Although some people still fail to realise this, a catalytic converter is not a
filter which can be cleaned out if the wrong materials clog it up. It is a
sophisticated device in which a chemical reaction, between the exhaust gases
and some very expensive metal plates through which they are led, ``cleans up''
the exhaust.
The fact that the metals involved are such things as platinum and rhodium is
what makes a converter cost so much. They do not, to mix a metaphor, grow on
trees.
As Jim Corbett has seen on several occasions, the other reason for the failure
of a catalytic converter is that it suffers physical damage and cannot be
repaired. We tend to think that converters are safely tucked away, but they are
in fact quite vulnerable.
A rough stretch of road which wrecks a car's exhaust may also terminally damage
the converter. And the consequence of some apparently unconnected incident - a
small front-end collision, perhaps - may be that the service manager says:
``Repairing the body damage will cost #100. And, by the way, there'll be
another #600 to replace the converter which got dislodged by the impact.''
When all this becomes generally known, owners will no doubt try to have their
cars put through the test in the best possible conditions. For instance,
somebody whose car blows a bit of smoke when warm may try to put it forward for
the test cold. The Vehicle Inspectorate will not allow that.
Test centres must ensure that the car is well warmed-up following a standard
routine. A hand-held computer gives a digital print-out showing not only the
emission levels of the gases concerned, but also the exact engine oil
temperature reading, to show that the test was carried out correctly. Centres
already have charts giving the temperature requirements for each make and model
of car likely to be presented.
The #28.38 test fee currently charged is a fairly silly non-round amount of
money. But the much bigger amounts some people will have to stump up afterwards
will not seem so funny.

AS well as wondering what MOT customers will make of the 1996 tests, Jim
Corbett is mulling over the implications for the garage trade of the new
requirements. Its reaction is anything but enthusiastic.
Several test centres have recently given up, and it is quite possible that more
will follow suit. The problem is that the expense of installing the exhaust
test equipment, then paying for the operator's time - and operators will
obviously take longer to complete the more complicated 1996 tests - is crazy
when set against the revenue that comes in.
The test fee recently went up from #26.10 to #27.38. Trade representatives had
lobbied for #30.95 as a more sensible figure, but were given a dusty reception
by officials.
Even people who think the motor trade is composed entirely of millionaires may
realise that the extra #1.28 per test will not go very far, even allowing for
the fact that the equipment is probably written down in the books over a
ten-year period.
A typical deal may see the garage paying something like #4500 for its new test
equipment. It would take 3515 tests at the extra #1.28 each to cover that
figure. And that is before any calculations about how much, at a typical hourly
labour rate, the operator's extra time will cost - a cost which cannot be
passed on to the customer.
Partly because of discounting in their retail sales, many dealerships are
trying to maximise profits from their service departments. But it is impossible
to improve the working of an operation which more or less by definition must
run at a loss, certainly in its early stages, and cannot either increase its
charges or reduce the time taken over its work.
In addition, there are concerns in the trade that the 1996 regulations may be
only a first step. If new standards are brought in, say in another two years,
bang goes the advantage of writing down the cost of the equipment over ten. The
test equipment manufacturers may well say that the 1996 equipment cannot be
modified, and that garages will have to invest in an all-new set-up once again.
In the end, it may be that only main dealers for individual makes of car will
continue as test centres. They can hardly refuse to provide that service for
their franchised make. But few of them will regard it as much more than an
unavoidable and barely profitable duty.

OF all the vehicle manufacturing companies in the world, Toyota is one of the
keenest at letting people know the statistics of its business. They make
intriguing, and at times highly entertaining, reading.
The first Toyotas were built exactly 60 years ago, when a tiny automobile
department was set up in the founding family's loom factory. In the table of
production numbers, against the year 1935 there appear the figures: total
vehicles 20, passenger cars 0. All the first-year Toyotas were trucks.
Contrast these with the corresponding statistics for the most recent full year
of production, 1994. They read: total vehicles 3,508,456, passenger cars
2,769,359. At first the temptation is to think that these numbers represent the
total Toyota production since the company was started, but they are single-year
figures, and from the Japanese factories alone.
They take no account of the manufacturing and assembly plants in the United
Kingdom, North and South America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand, and
elsewhere in Asia.
Toyota is so big in the Japanese economy, and so concentrated in its production
facilities, that its head office and 12 individual manufacturing plants are
located in a metropolitan area called Toyota City. Cars, truck and bus chassis,
engines, electronic and other components are all built within a small radius,
with two shipping complexes nearby.
Selling is a huge international operation, and often started on a small scale
in an area where Toyota now dominates certain sectors of the local market. For
example, the company took its first tentative steps in Africa in 1957, when it
set up a small import business in Ethiopia, of all unlikely locations. Now it
sells throughout the continent, and the Landcruiser is the          most
prominent 4x4 in several countries.
Like most Japanese companies, Toyota uses different model names in different
markets. Some of them are hardly to British tastes. Showrooms in Japan, for
example, display vehicles like the Caldina, Estima, Emina, Cynos, Chaser,
Sprinter, Carib, and Deliboy.
We chuckle at the quaint Nipponese names. But if you recall what has happened
to the home-owned British motor industry, who should be doing the laughing? One
notable thing about one of the world's biggest motor manufacturing companies is
that members of the founding family still help to direct its affairs. Their
name is actually Toyoda.
A mysterious Japanese enterprise involved in a lagging-behind London property
development recently pretended to have an entirely imaginary spokesman called
Mr Toyota. That may have gulled the London property writers, but it would not
have fooled the motoring staff, who know the two names are, confusingly, not
the same.

BROWN Brothers, the Edinburgh-based engineering firm, has won a multi-million
pound order for equipment to transfer oil and gas from undersea wells on to a
floating storage vessel moored in the North Sea.
The 100-tonne swivel stack will be mounted on the converted tanker Dagmar
Maersk. This will be linked by pipelines to undersea oil and gas wells in
Conoco's MacCulloch field when it comes on stream in December 1996.
The seven-metre high swivel stack will control the flow of oil and gas pumped
aboard the vessel, however much it may pitch and roll in heavy seas.
The exact value of the contract was not disclosed.
Brown Brothers, which specialises in the manufacture of motion control
equipment for merchant vessels, warships, and offshore platforms, is a
subsidiary of the Vickers engineering group.

AFTER the bonanza that shareholders of the English electricity companies have
enjoyed it could now be the turn of shareholders in the privatised water
companies.
Lucky holders of shares in Northumbrian Water are to receive #11.79p for each
share following the #823m takeover bid for the company from Lyonnaise des Eaux.
This means that since the start of the year they have seen a 73% profit on
their investment.
A typical holder of 200 Northumbrian shares since privatisation in 1989 has
seen a total profit of #1878 plus dividends of about #280 on his original #480
investment. Had the same amount been invested in an average quoted company the
gain would have been just #206 plus dividends of roughly #100.
The Northumbrian return is on a par with the profits seen by shareholders in
the English electricity companies (recs) following the bidding frenzy in the
industry which has left just four out of the 12 as independent companies.
Shares of two companies, Norweb and Seeboard, have about doubled this year and
the smallest gain in the sector still came to 59%. Even companies like South
Wales which have not received a bid have seen huge rises on their shares.
Now to cap it all shareholders are going to receive a further bonanza from the
listing on the stock market of shares in National Grid. As the company was
formerly owned by the recs, part of its value is being passed on to them
directly. Each rec shareholder will receive on average of about eight Grid
shares for every 10 rec held. This is equivalent to a windfall of some 180p for
each share they own.
The electricity bonanza reflects the perceived value in terms of profits and
cash flow of the recs to other companies and the Government's decision, taken
against the advice of the electricity industry regulator, to allow a
free-for-all to develop. The value of the companies stems basically from the
cheap price at which they were privatised and the subsequent relatively light
regulation of the industry.
Increased efficiency through manpower cuts have enabled the companies to reduce
the price of electricity in real terms but more of the benefits have gone to
shareholders, who in addition to huge capital gains have received large rises
in dividends each year since privatisation.
To take the example of Manweb which received a #1100m bid from ScottishPower. A
holding of 200 shares bought on privatisation cost #480. At the bid value, it
is now worth #2040, giving a profit of #1560. It will also have brought in
dividend income totalling #210, spread over five years.
While these figures are on a par with the Northumbrian Water case, shareholders
in the other water companies have not done nearly so well. On average the
shares have risen by 15% this year, slightly less than the market as a whole.
Since privatisation a holder of 200 Anglian Water shares for example has seen a
gain of #680, though dividend income has been similar at #260.
Scots have missed the utilities bonanza because water was not privatised and
ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric were not sold off as cheaply. They
were privatised after the English electricity and water companies, when the
Government had learned more about valuing them. They are also different in
being integrated power companies, generating and distributing electricity, and
of less interest to bidders.
Since privatisation, shareholders of ScottishPower and Hydro have seen gains of
57% and 48% respectively which is insignificant when compared with the fourfold
rise in an investment in the average rec.
More predators are likely to be looking at water companies now that the
Government has allowed the Lyonnaise bid through, albeit with some pretty
stringent conditions, notably that prices to consumers have to be reduced by
15% by 2001. But they will not generate same excitement as the electricity
companies.
There appears to be limited interest from within the UK, not least because of
the heavier regulatory hand when compared with the recs. North West Water is
spreading its wings by bidding for the rec which operates in its geographical
area, Norweb, and Welsh Water is contemplating doing the same for South Wales
Electricity. There may be attempts by two adjacent water companies to merge,
though this will be resisted by the regulator.
The water companies face a new round of heavy capital expenditure to achieve
higher standards of supply and waste treatment. In contrast, the recs have few
spending obligations and generate large amounts of cash.
The attraction for overseas companies is that Britain will allow them to buy
actual assets, the water plants, sewage works and distribution networks. Water
suppliers around the world generally do not own their plant. Instead it is held
by local or central government, which may well hire a private sector company to
operate the system and collect the revenue.
While margins for Lyonnaise's domestic operations in its home market may be 2%
or 3% they may range up to 25% in Britain because it will own the assets. As a
result the industry will be of particular interest to overseas utilities.

THIS week a Scottish visitor to Ireland remarked that the anti-divorce
campaigners were so well organised that he reckoned that they would pull off a
surprise publicity coup ahead of polling in today's referendum.
This pre-vote coup was accomplished in spectacular style yesterday with the
intervention of Pope John Paul II when the 75-year-old Pontiff urged the Irish
people to pray more intensely to preserve ``the unbreakable bond of marriage''.
The Pope's appeal to Irish electors to block the introduction of divorce
publicly signals the Vatican's blessing of the strenuous efforts taken by the
Roman Catholic hierarchy.
This papal intervention came after several Government ministers and the leader
of the SDLP in Northern Ireland, John Hume, had appealed to voters to take
account of the sensitivities of Protestants in Ulster, especially the possible
negative effect on the peace process if the divorce referendum is perceived to
have lost out to ``Rome Rule''.
While the anti-divorce campaigners rejoiced that the Pope's message would
copper-fasten victory for them today, Rome's intervention was seen as
interference by the six political parties in the Dail which have been taken
aback by the volatility of public opinion.
A lead of over 20 points in opinion polls in favour of law reform measure at
the start of the referendum campaign has been cut to a mere three points, with
the swing still heading for a No vote.
The nightmare for the Government is of a repeat of 1986 when a similar attempt
to introduce divorce swung from a 2-1 margin in favour at the outset to a 2-1
defeat on polling day.
This time the political establishment and the media have responded more
vigorously to the barrage of propaganda and scare tactics of the anti-divorce
lobbies. Today's referendum result could be the closest since Eamon de Valera
drafted the Constitution in 1937 with its prohibition against divorce.
The proposed amendment to the Constitution would allow divorce in cases where
couples have been separated for at least four of the previous five years. A
couple would have to prove reconciliation efforts had failed completely. The
courts would be empowered to make orders about property rights and the welfare
of children.
Although 18 separate pieces of legislation had been put in place since 1986 to
deal with such contentious money and property issues for an estimated separated
80,000 couples, the anti-campaigners have rallied support by claiming that the
first family would lose its constitutional rights, that marriage would no
longer be a permanent contract, and that the introduction of no-fault divorce
would accelerate marriage breakdown as in Britain and the United States.
These social arguments have been skilfully presented by a small group of
dedicated activists that include Des Hanafin, a reformed alcoholic; Joe
McCarroll, a teacher whose own marriage has broken down; a retired High Court
judge, Rory O'Hanlon, who is a member of the ultra-right Catholic body Opus
Dei; and a constitutional lawyer, William Binchy, the brother of novelist Maeve
Binchy.
A second group of even more zealous Catholic fundamentalists want to roll-back
recent liberal social changes in Ireland and have smeared the two Jewish
members of the Dail. An instance of scare tactics was a poster stating ``Hallo,
divorce, Good-bye, daddy.''
The evidence shows that many women have been influenced by this propaganda that
reduces them to chattels of errant husbands. Opinion within the main Opposition
party, Fianna Fail, has swung solidly against divorce, recreating a de facto
alliance of the Catholic bishops and Fianna Fail that was so decisive in 1986.
In an end-of-campaign appeal, Prime Minister John Bruton tried to counteract
the impact of the Pope. Today the Irish people have ``the opportunity to vote
for a more pluralist and tolerant country,'' he said, urging respect of
minority rights.
The Pope's remarks merely add a new chapter to the intimate relations which
have characterised Vatican policy towards Ireland since its independence in
1922.
During the 1932 Eucharistic Congress the voice of Pope Pius XI was heard for
the first time in a radio broadcast by the vast crowd of pilgrims attending
Mass in Dublin's Phoenix Park. ``The silence of the people as the Holy Father
spoke became almost painfully intense. There was a catch in each one's throat,
and every eye was moist. Over the whole multitude surged a tide of pride, and
gratitude, and exaltation,'' according to the Congress chronicle.
Five years later, as the archives now reveal, Joseph Walshe, the secretary of
the Department of External Relations, was sent by de Valera to secure advance
approval by Pope Pius XI for the draft Constitution - ahead of its publication
in parliament and presentation to the electorate.
While Pope Pius XI withheld his full approval, he and subsequent Popes have
lauded the Irish Constitution as reflecting Catholic values, particularly in
regard to the family. So much so that when Dr Garret FitzGerald tried to
persuade Pope Paul VI in the 1970s to approve the removal of sectarian features
from the De Valera Constitution, he was strongly rebuked by the elderly Pontiff.
``Ireland semper fidelis - Ireland always faithful'' were the last words
uttered by Pope John Paul II after his historic visit in 1979 when 2.7 million
people flocked to hear him.
In 1987 and in 1992 when the Irish bishops made their ad limina visit to Rome
to account for their stewardship, Pope John Paul made it clear he wanted them
to hold the line against divorce, abortion, and a secular Ireland.
The firmness of the Pope's intervention shows no weakening of his policy
towards Ireland, despite the dismay felt in Rome at the recent spate of sexual
scandals involving senior clergy.
The odds are that the measure may narrowly be accepted - but don't be surprised
by a No vote.
The outcome will be closely watched for evidence of the extent of the influence
of the traditional alliance of Pope and bishops in a referendum which has at
its core the question of whether the Constitution should reflect Roman Catholic
or pluralist values.

TRIED &amp; TASTED
DEEDEE CUDDIHY puts instant meals to the test
LAST month, the managers of a pub near Glasgow University de-cided to hand out
free Student Survival Kits in a bid to get even more useful customers through
the doors. The kits included a condom (yawn), toothbrush and toothpaste and
some pot noodle, the instant dried snack food that you pour boiling water over
and eat straight from the container.
It wasn't the original Pot Noodle - launched by Golden Wonder in 1979 and now
selling in Britain at the rate of 110 million units per annum - but one of an
increasing number of pot noodle imitators which the public, nevertheless,
insist on calling pot noodle (in the same way that vacuum cleaners are referred
to as Hoovers).
The point is, do students really survive on this stuff? Some of us who
experienced the 1979 prototype will find it hard to believe that anyone could
eat a whole container of pot noodle, even under duress.
But perhaps the product has changed over the past 16 years? We bought five
varieties of eat-from-the-pot snack meal and with the help of lecturer Pauline
Devlin, tested them on six, second year students from Cale-donian University's
Department of Consumer and Manage-ment Studies.
Sinead, Louise, Eleanor, Claire, Natasha and Leigh tried out Pot Rice chicken
curry, Pots of the World Texan hot chilli and beef and tomato Pot Noodle (all
by Golden Wonder) as well as Pasta Regale tagliatelle parmagani and Nissin beef
Cup Noodles. All the products were priced at around 75p per pot in supermarkets.
Pot Rice - Sinead thought the flavour was good, Grace said she liked it, the
other four were put off by the smell, flavour and texture which they pronounced
artificial and over-processed.
Texan hot chilli - Louise and Eleanor liked this better than the Pot Rice,
Grace and Natasha both said it was too spicy, Leigh and Sinead didn't like,
respectively, the texture and the taste.
Beef and tomato Pot Noodle - the variety which drew the least violent reactions
from our testers, with most agreeing it wasn't bad and Eleanor going so far as
to say she might buy it.
Pasta Regale - Sinead and Louise were very impressed with this nicely
presented, vegetarian product, declaring it good enough to put on a plate.
Eleanor also liked it, Grace pronounced it ``boggin''', Natasha said it was
disgusting, Leigh was put off by the smell and appearance.
Nissan Cup Noodles with beef - although Sinead remarked on the rather bland
flavour of this product, all the testers were impressed by its real food
flavour and appearance.
At the end of our testing session, five of the tasters said they might try one
or more varieties of pot noodle again - especially if they were drunk. Natasha,
however, declared that she had been put off for life.

FAST bowler Michael Kasprowicz took a career-best seven for 64 to put
Queensland in command against the Sri Lankan tourists on the second day of a
four-day match on Thursday.
Kasprowicz's superb spell helped dismiss Sri Lanka for a paltry 178 in reply to
Queensland's first innings 305. At the close, Queensland were 13 for no wicket,
and with a lead of 140, were well-placed for victory with two days to spare.
Only Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga offered any resistance to the
Queensland attack, top scoring with 77 before he was caught by former
Australian captain Allan Border off Kasprowicz.
q FOUR West Indies players whose behaviour was considered ``unsatisfactory''
during the team's tour of England this year have appeared before a disciplinary
hearing. West Indies Cricket Board of Control (WICBC) have still to name
officially the players involved, but the Caribbean News Agency (CANA) said it
was known Brian Lara, Carl Hooper, Curtly Ambrose, and Kenny Benjamin met the
disciplinary committee on Wednesday.

THERE is a note of apology in Michael Radford's voice. ``I'm afraid that I'm
rather rootless,'' he says, ``and that's a direct result of being a child of
the remnants of the Empire. My father was in the services, and was posted just
about all over the place. I always say that White Mischief is one of my least
personal films - all about the ruling classes in Kenya in the early forties -
but then I think about it and realise that it is probably more reflective and
personal to the way I was brought up than anything else.
``If I had to have a home anywhere, I guess it would be in Scotland, where I
spent a lot of my professional growing-up, and a lot of childhood holidays. And
I still love the place. But as for settling down anywhere, I find that
terrifically difficult.''
Radford, at 45, is one of the younger British film directors who has made his
mark with a series of movies that, while perhaps they did not perform to major
box office bucks at the time of release, are now considered either landmarks of
film - or cult classics. ``White Mischief is shown by request on cable stations
in the US about once every month,'' he says.
Radford, born in New Delhi to an English father and an Austrian mother (``which
complicates things still further,'' he laughs), worked as an actor and a
teacher before becoming one of the first students at the newly opened National
Film School. He graduated with another distinctive film-maker, Bill Forsyth. He
started off making documentaries, and then his film of Jessie Kesson's novel,
The White Bird Passes, received Scotland's best dramatic picture award in the
early eighties. Then came Another Time, Another Place, an adaptation of another
Kesson novel, which won prizes at festivals all around the world.
It was Radford who directed Richard Burton in his last film, 1984, (possibly
one of that much-maligned actor's better pieces of work on film) and then came
White Mischief.
``The critics jumped on it. Trampled it,'' says Michael. ``And naturally, I got
very disheartened by that. Who wouldn't? So, licking my wounds, I went off to
France and started writing screenplays and making commercials to keep body and
soul together.''
Meanwhile, the Italian actor and humourist Massimo Troisi had seen Michael's
work, and made contact. The two men became friends and vowed they would make a
film together. It all came to be in the movie released this month in the UK, Il
Postino (The Postman).
The film has already been a phenomenal success in the US. ``As I speak, I think
it's the biggest-grossing foreign language film of all time,'' says Radford
with a broad smile.
``How it's captured the hearts and minds of so many people I really don't know,
though I'd like to think it was because it tells a story, that it offers people
a chance to think about what they're seeing, and it reflects a very human
drama.''
And drama in real-life, too. Tragically, Troisi died the day after shooting
finished. ``His ill-health was no secret at all,'' says Michael sadly. ``He'd
had heart problems since his late teens, and had to take things easy. He knew
he had a problem. And ironically he had been offered a heart transplant just as
we went into production, but declined it. Massimo said he believed in Il
Postino so much that he'd put it off, that the film was more important, and
that, as far as making it went, it was now or never.
``We had to bear all this in mind, and not over-tax him. It meant that he could
do about two hours actual work a day. And shoot around the `problem' by using a
stunt double who was so like Massimo that it was uncanny. I defy anyone to spot
the joins - where it's Massimo and when it's the double.
``Basically, Il Postino has some of its roots in truth. There was a poet called
Pablo Neruda, he came from Chile, and he wrote some amazingly effective work.
He was exiled from his home country for some time.
``So we decided that we would place him on an Italian island, and have him
befriend this rather gauche postman. The film is about how the younger man
falls in love with the most beautiful girl on the island, and how he achieves
his ambitions with the help of the poet.''
Il Postino has a celebrity following in the US. ``So much so,'' says Michael,
``that we've issued a CD of Neruda's work, with people like Madonna, Julia
Roberts, Ralph Fiennes and Ethan Hawke reading it. Julia turned up at the
studio with this dog-eared copy of his collected works that she said she'd read
over and over again since her teens. And Madonna has everything he's ever
written. She just begged to be allowed to read something - and when she did, it
was just amazing. Very emotional. Perfect.''
Il Postino has now given Radford the opening einto big-time Hollywood. ``And
one of the reasons for that is that Jack Nicholson got up at some function or
other and said that the film was one of the most moving things he'd ever seen.
When Jack says that, people in LA listen. And listen hard.
``So I'm going to relish the moment, and take a little time to discover what I
want to do. Not too much time, because things move on very quickly in
Hollywood. You can be very hot one day - and luke-warm the next.
``One project I've got to consider is maybe a remake of Anna Karenina, with
Michele Pfeiffer in the title role."
He adds: ``Postino tells all of us that to have a mentor is a wonderful thing,
someone who can open that door of appreciation for you, and then guide you
through it. I think that it's a movie for intelligent people, people who want
to laugh and cry and be touched emotionally.
``Who was my own mentor? My history teacher at school, who just made me see
that books were the key to appreciating so many great things.
``I don't see why a film can't be both popular and intelligent, and that's
certainly the sort of film I want to make. You know when you're going to make a
stinker, because you're seduced by the size of the cheque.''
He chucked in acting himself, he says, ``because when the biggest role I had
was as the Dormouse in Toad of Toad Hall, with one line to say, I realised that
I wasn't getting anywhere fast.''
Does he see himself making films again in the UK? ``Well, yes because you can
never rule anything out. But I would, I confess, find it difficult to make a
movie in Yorkshire or Glasgow or wherever because my own personal mood isn't
right. I use my own personal instincts and let them guide me. You just can't do
anything else, can you?''

RANGERS are considering the possibility of preventing a few of their players
from appearing before the SFA disciplinary committee to answer allegations that
they behaved badly on the field of play recently.
Justice and the interests of the game might be better served if the Ibrox club
kept all of their players indoors on Champions' League nights and made them
study the art of movement.
Rarely can a group of players be so determined to put so much into a match yet
appear static. While Steaua Bucharest strolled, sprinted, and drifted often
unnoticed into spaces in support of their man in possession, Rangers worked
extremely hard to get nowhere.
Hardly any Rangers player on the pitch in Wednesday night's match made
intelligent runs in support of attacks and indeed it was partly because of this
failure that Paul Gascoigne set off on the remarkable run which created his
team's goal in the 1-1 draw.
Gascoigne took a pass from Brian Laudrup and when he had no-one available in a
position potentially dangerous to Steaua, he went on alone and scored a
wonderful goal. It was fortunate for Rangers that it was Gascoigne who was in
possession because no-one else, apart from Luadrup, could have engineered a
breakthrough from within his own half of the pitch.
The Romanians, by comparison, were casually fluent without ever producing
football which took the breath away, but when they moved forward, support
travelled swiftly as it should do. Sometimes the player with the ball had two
or three options while the Ibrox side's play suffered from a woeful lack of
vision within.
Steaua's coach Dumitru Dumitriu was not lying when he said too many Rangers
players seem always to be waiting for Laudrup and Gascoigne to do something
instead of doing it for themselves. The problem is, of course, that too many of
the players who are likely to win an eighth successive domestic championship
are incapable of seeking out space or making the telling run.
There is a profound lack of awareness about this Rangers team and they cannot
become European graduates until they can think on their feet like their foreign
opponents. Rangers actually had more possession than Steaua, but endeavour
without direction equals sweat, and that alone will not do, even at Ibrox where
they have been vulnerable.
This season alone Hibernian, Raith Rovers, Aberdeen, and Celtic as well, of
course, as Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, and Steaua Bucharest have taken points
from Ibrox. That should alarm the management, and if his players won't, Walter
Smith will have to apply some thought to the deficiencies highlighted in five
Champions' League matches which have yielded only two points and four goals.
Rangers have conceded 12 goals, although eight were scored by one team,
Juventus, which also suggests the defence is not nearly as strong as its early
season promise. Indeed, more than #25m has been spent building a team for
Europe, and clearly Rangers are still not good enough.
Players like Gary Bollan and Alex Cleland were bought in as fillers, squad men,
and surely it was never the intention to rely on them on the big occasions,
although injuries to others reduced Smith's options considerably to the point
where he has had to turn again to John Brown, who thought his playing days were
over.
Neil Murray falls into the back-up category also, but more should be provided
by others like Gordan Petric, who was at fault when Rangers conceded the
equaliser to Steaua. Petric appears intent on proving he is indeed a player who
will cost a team                     perhaps half a dozen goals in critical
games. He has not looked comfortable in the rarified atmosphere of Champions'
League football, even though he is a foreigner.
Also, Alan McLaren, despite all the praise delivered at his feet, has not done
enough to convince sceptics, and neither David Robertson nor Stephen Wright
possess the necessary com-posure and touch to play the modern wing-back roles
to the full. Rangers are trying to pass the ball from the back, but when they
move forward and pass wide, hoping for the ball to be taken deep before being
delivered into the box, they run the risk of losing possession with players out
of position.
Up front, Smith bought in Oleg Salenko with the intention of creating a
dangerous new strike force, but the Russian and Ally McCoist are not gelling
well. The latter is a penalty-box player, and he needs service - only one real
chance was created for him against Steaua - otherwise he loses any
effectiveness. Smith must sign another striker soon and it must be one who is
capable of enhancing the system being played in the absence of Mark Hateley,
whose presence made a long-ball game productive.
A lot more spending will have to be done if Rangers are to add to the qualities
of Andy Goram and Richard Gough, and also Laudrup and Gascoigne, provided these
two give their best for the cause.
It is astonishing to think Smith has a team which could set a new mark in
Scottish football history in terms of league champion-ships yet they are
impotent abroad. Of course, if the chairman, David Murray, is happy setting
home records, he won't have to find more money. But if he seeks greater
exposure for his team, it will cost him again.

ROUYAN, who carries something of a ``handle with care'' tag after a series of
annoying leg problems, can show himself very much at the top of his game by
winning the Jacky Upton Handicap Chase today at Newbury.
The nine-year-old was restricted to two runs in handicap chases last term but,
a smart hurdler who won Sandown's Tote Jackpot Handicap                  Hurdle
for Ron Simpson in January 1991, he has proved equally able over fences.
Although once-raced in novice chase company in each of his first two campaigns
in the care of Jenny Pitman, Rouyan showed useful form in five races the season
before last.
And last term, with two wins as many starts, he confirmed himself a progressive
chaser and - just as, if not more important - one still on the right side of
the handicapper.
Eskimo Nel is an improved filly of late and can make light of a 5lb penalty in
the Brimpton Handicap Hurdle.
Brian Harding might have missed out on the ride aboard One Man in the Hennessy
Gold Cup, but he still has plenty to thank Gordon Richards for and can partner
the Greystoke trainer's Better Times Ahead to victory in the Helshaw Grange
Handicap Chase at Bangor.

<HEADLINE>Make or break for Stirling at Bridgehaugh Joiner return boosts Melrose's title hopes</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
CRAIG Joiner has lost time to catch up when he returns to senior club rugby
after injury by playing for Melrose in the top-of-the-table contest with
Stirling County at Bridgehaugh tomorrow. A stress fracture in a foot has kept
the 21-year-old international wing out for more than two months.
He had played only two premier league matches in early September before he was
forced to rest his injured foot, and he returns with only a couple of
championship fixtures left in the Melrose calendar, though none can be more
important than the Bridgehaugh game between the past and current title-holders.
Melrose would be almost guaranteed the SRU Tennents Premiership trophy if they
were to win, whereas Stirling need to complete the double over the Borderers if
they are to retain any prospect of keeping the championship: County won the
clubs' previous encounter, albeit by only 27-26, last month at the Greenyards.
apart from the background to that match, it will be an especially demanding
return for Joiner. His direct opponent will be none other than his
international colleague, Kenny Logan.
Whether or not Melrose go on to win the title, Joiner's target will be to
regain a place in the South XV for the district championship next month as a
stepping stone to returning to  the national team. The Melrose wing has played
in 12 of Scotland's past 14 internationals, missing only the defeat by South
Africa a year ago and, of course, that 15-all draw with Western Samoa last
Saturday.
Rowen Shepherd, Millan Browne, and Derek Lunn, like Joiner, resume for Melrose.
While Joiner is on the way back, two other capped players, Derek Stark and
Derek Turnbull, have been sidelined by injury. Stark has had a wrist operation
after injury while playing for Boroughmuir against Watsonians on Sunday, though
he is hopeful of returning to rugby before the end of the year, and Turnbull
will be out for much longer after a double leg fracture during Hawick's victory
over Edinburgh Academicals the same day.
Ally McLean takes over from Stark on the right wing for Boroughmuir against
Heriot's at Meggetland tomorrow. Stuart Reid also resumes, after his
international debut last Saturday, but Boroughmuir have lost their New Zealand
lock, Darren George, because of injury.
John Graham, who has recovered from an ankle injury, makes a timely return to
the Hawick back row to replace Turnbull for the visit to Netherdale.
q THE Melrose committee were due to meet last night to decide what action to
take over the eye injury sustained by prop Mark Ross during their premiership
clash with Edinburgh Accies. The player was apparently punched and later
underwent surgery to his left eye, which may be permanently damaged.
Academicals issued a statement yesterday in which they said that no formal
complaint had been received from Melrose and that they did not intend to take
any action against any of their players.
q AFTER sharing the two-match series with Ulster last weekend, Glasgow open
their defence of Scottish rugby's under-18 district championship with a visit
to Langholm to play against the South tomorrow (kick-off 2.0).
Ulster beat the Glasgow boys 25-16 at Ardrossan last Friday, but the home team
had an 18-16 win in the rematch at Stranraer on Sunday morning. Glasgow's XV.
S Hutchinson (Cambuslang); A Pollock (Glasgow Southern), S Kidd (Kilmarnock), S
McAllister (Stirling County), R Pittam (Marr); S Weston (Hillhead/Jordanhill),
F Kennedy (Stirling County); L Haycock (Mid-Argyll), A Smith, T McCulloch (both
Stirling County), S Bryce (Dalziel), J Toner (Allan Glen's), A Lees (Ayr,
captain), B Allan (Hamilton Academicals), D Wilson (GHK). Replacments - C Smith
(Ayr), J Millan (GHK), M Dick (Cambuslang), G Sykes (Ayr), J Maclay (GHK), J

SCOTLAND `A' have fixed up a prestigious fixture against the South African
provincial side, Northern Transvaal, to be played in Pretoria the day before
the Calcutta Cup game at Murrayfield.
The clash with the Blue Bulls on Friday, March 1, is likely to take place in
the Loftus Versfeld Test arena where Scotland played most of their matches
during the World Cup.
The Scottish shadow side now has a solid-looking programme, the defeat by
Western Samoa earlier this month being the first of six outings this season.
They will next be in action against Italy on January 6, a game which takes on
extra significance in view of the disappointing performance by the senior side
against the Samoans last weekend and with the Five Nations' Championship opener
taking place against Ireland a fortnight later.
With the exception of England, games have been arranged at `A' level against
the Five Nations' rivals, and the Northern Transvaal expedition fills in what
would otherwise have been a blank weekend.
Northern Transvaal will provide stern opposition for the Scots. They had five
players in the South African World Cup squad, with scrum half Joost van der
Westhuizen and flanker Ruben Kruger both playing in the RWC final against New
Zealand.
Yesterday, Scotland `A' manager Dougie Morgan said that the original plan had
been for the side to play Northern Transvaal last season but the fixture had
fallen through and Ivory Coast had stepped into the breach as part of their
World Cup warm-up programme.
q DAMIAN Cronin underwent keyhole surgery to a cartilage in his right knee in
Glasgow's Western Infirmary yesterday. The international second row, who has
had operations on the ligaments in both knees in the past, complained about
knee pain during Scotland's 15-all draw with Western Samoa last Saturday.
Cronin, who plays his rugby at No.8 in France, is expected to be released
today, and return to France.
q GARY Armstrong and Doddie Weir met Newcastle rugby director Rob Andrew again
this week for further talks. The Scottish pair have now been issued with draft
contracts and they are being examined by lawyers. All being well, Armstrong and
Weir could make their Newcastle debuts in January.
q EDINBURGH Academicals' spokesman Magnus Moodie said yesterday that the club
had now received the letter from the SRU concerning the ``tantamount to
cheating'' remarks by coach David Sole following the premiership game with
Melrose a fortnight ago. ``Accies have now replied to the union and await their
further comment. I'm not able to divulge the contents of our response,'' he
said.

ALTHOUGH the art of the string quartet is traditionally linked with a mature
and reflective audience, the new young quartet-in-residence at the Queens Hall
believes in extending boundaries.
Thanks to its association with 14 local schools, there were as many children as
adults present on Wednesday for an evening of Haydn, Beethoven, and Ronald
Center.
No music, it's true, is more mature than Haydn's G-major quartet, Op 77, No 1,
a product of the composer's fragile old age. But no music is more vivacious, as
the spruce and springy performance demonstrated.
Only the slow movement, which needed richer harmonic resonance, fell seriously
short of expectations, but no doubt that will be rectified soon, if the
treatment of the slow movement of Beethoven's F minor quartet, Op 95, later in
the programme is anything to go by.
Here the players, catching the elusive tempo to admiration, conveyed the
music's slow-footed sense of mystery, without losing the terseness that is the
special feature of the work as a whole.
Nor was Ronald Center's first quartet, sandwiched between the Haydn and
Beethoven, allowed to dally. Indeed, this grumpy, impatient music, written in
Aberdonian isolation in the 1940s and neglected ever since, seemed to call for
just the abrasive, rhythmically edgy performance it received.
Whether these young players will win the composer the support he never received
in his lifetime remains to be seen, but their forthcoming recording of this
work - a kind of cross between Bartok and early Britten - will surely help.

WE have had enough of the sordid sadism and brutality of the West trial and the
complications of the feminists welcoming the ultimate sex symbol to the
sisterhood; the British public needs a reassuring tale with a happy ending.
`Loyal, devoted mistress saves unjustly maligned family pet from death row' is
the perfect animal antidote. Dempsey lives and the law is an ass.
For more than three years Dempsey, a seven-year-old pit bull terrier bitch, has
been under a destruction order for being unmuzzled in a public place in
contravention of the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act.
It took the High Court to quash the destruction order and allow Dempsey to be
reunited with her owner, Dianne Fanneran, a 47-year-old optician's receptionist
from west London, who displayed distictly terrier-like tenaciousness in her
long fight to save her pet. Dempsey's reprieve appears to have been on a
technicality because it was not Mrs Fanneran herself who removed the muzzle to
allow the dog, who was choking, to be sick.
Other unmuzzled pit bulls have been sentenced to death because there was no
legal alternative. A similar act ``of common sense and compassion'' by a
Maryhill man only hours after the Act came into operation resulted in his dog
being put to death and the owner being fined #250 and having a criminal record,
despite having complied fully with all the other requirements of the Act,
recalls John Robins of Animal Concern. ``If he had not removed the muzzle, the
dog would have choked to death and he would have been prosecuted for cruelty.''
Since the Dangerous Dogs Act came into effect, lobbyists have campaigned
against automatic death sentences for dogs whose owners contravene the law.
Even a sheriff refused to make a destruction order until an Appeal Court
ruling. The Dangerous Dogs Act Reform Group, chaired by past president of the
British Veterinary Association, Paul De Vile, includes the Scottish Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the RSPCA, the Canine Defence League and
the League against Cruel Sports. They all support requirements to have ``pit
bull type'' dogs registered, implanted with a microchip detailing their owner,
tatooed and insured for third party liability and muzzled in public.
However, they say dogs with no history of injuring anyone are being put down
unjustly. They would prefer the future of the dog to be decided on an
individual basis by the sheriff or magistrate, and add they are not against
vicious dogs being put to death.
Most of the organisations support a national dog registration scheme which
would require all dogs to be registered and implanted with a microchip - the
canine equivalent of a car registration enabling the owner to be traced.
The legislation has already had an effect on the numbers of pit bull terriers
in the UK.
``The macho image of a powerful head-banging dog on one end of a lead and an
idiot on the other has lost its appeal. You don't see groups of yobs with a
clutch of pit bulls hanging round street corners the way you did in the early
70s,'' says James Barrington, director of the League Against Cruel Sports. In
the 70s, it campaigned against the breed, created entirely for fighting
purposes, being allowed into the UK. Now, because they have to be neutered, the
breed is beginning to die out.
IT was estimated there were 10,000 pit bull terriers in 1991. The Central Index
of Exempted Dogs, run by an animal shelter in Hertfordshire on behalf of the
Home Office, has registered 8600. Since then, 1850 have died or been put down.
Predictions that thousands of owners would have their pets destroyed before the
Act came into force to claim a #50 bounty from the Home Office were unrealised.
Unexpectedly, but alarmingly, in the last couple of years increasing numbers of
owners have had their animals put down because they have suddenly turned from
biddable pet to unpredictable, biting animal, reports Jim Grant, who runs the
register with his wife, Isabel. ``It seems to happen about the age of four. We
don't know why, but there is a theory the brain may begin to press on an
indentation in the skull of these dogs. Too many people have now told me their
dog `turned' within seconds for there not to be some pattern.''
There is also a lobby for a requirement for other breeds to be muzzled. Top of
the list in Scotland are rottweilers, not mentioned in the Act, despite the
death of 11-year-old Kellie Lynch, savaged by two rottweilers while walking
them near Dunoon.
Now the legislation is to be reviewed by an all-party committee of MPs after
claims it has cost taxpayers #40m as dogs have been held in kennels while their
owners appeal.

IT is now almost eight years since Dundee player-manager Jim Duffy was advised
by specialists that he should stop playing football. Yet, on Sunday, the
indomitable defender seems sure to lead his team on to Hampden and into his
first major final as a player.
At 36 years of age, Duffy genuinely believes that now is the time when he can
pick up his first medal, even though his damaged knee has become a standing
joke among the medical profession in Scotland.
Yesterday, as he began the serious preparations for the Coca-Cola Cup final
against Aberdeen on Sunday, Duffy grinned: ``The doctors, the surgeons, the
specialists, they all just laugh at me now. ``If I tell any one of them after a
game that I can't straighten my knee they just shake their heads, laugh, and
walk away.
``I suppose that's because they know that I won't do what they tell me to do,
which is stop playing football.
``They did tell me before, back in 1987, and I did listen and I took their
advice and I continued to do that for two-and-a-half years. I stopped playing
for that length of time and I hated it. I wanted to keep on playing and that's
what I have done ever since.
``Yes, I still feel pain after matches, but the pain is no worse now than it
was eight years ago.
``People say that I'm not as good a player now but, then, even without the
injury I'm not likely to be as good at 36 as I was at 28.
``I don't let it worry me, but I don't make a big deal out of it because there
are a lot of people worse off than I am. After all, all I've got is a sore
knee.''
Now, before the final, Duffy must decide whether or not he picks himself for
what is the biggest match of his career. He is in charge. But he will listen to
others and not make any sentimental decision about his own big day.
Yesterday he pointed out: ``This is a major match for this club, for this team,
and for these players. It is not about me. It is about all of us and I have to
make the right decision for Dundee Football Club.
``There will be no sentiment involved. If I think I am the right player for
this game, then I'll play. If I don't think that, then I will still be there on
the bench, still at Hampden, and still involved because I'm the manager.''
There is a strong belief within Duffy, which appears to have spread to his
squad, that Dundee can follow Raith Rovers' example of last season and produce
a shock result, though Duffy does not talk too much about the Ibrox final when
Celtic lost out.
He says simply: ``That was Raith's day. It was their big occasion and it has no
bearing on this weekend. We have to do it for ourselves.
``If anything the Raith result might work against us, because Aberdeen will be
more on their guard. They won't want to suffer as Celtic did.''
Even allowing for the possibility of caution from the Dons, Duffy reckons, like
so many at Pittodrie, that this will be an open final, a flowing final and
perhaps even a high scoring one. He admits: ``We have midfield players who want
to get forward just as they do. Goals can arrive from different areas. I think
we are better when we're up against a team with the same outlook as ourselves.
This will suit us.
``You know, I don't believe any of our youngsters will freeze on the day
despite their relative inexperience. The older players will worry more than the
young lads.
``Look, when you're a kid and you climb a tree, you get up there to the top and
you don't think anything about it. When you're a little bit older and you do
the same you start to think about what would happen if you fell.
``I would never say before a game like this that we might lose, but I have a
real belief that we can win this one.''
Duffy will decide tomorrow morning whether he will play himself or not.
So far, he has given his players his thoughts about the game and how the team
will be asked to play but the personnel remains secret.
My own belief is that Duffy will be in the team giving on-field guidance to the
young men around him, coaxing and ajoling then towards possible glory.
It's a role made for this man who has simply refused to quit the game he loves.
q SPANISH club Union Deportivo Salamanca are preparing a move for Brazilian
World Cup star Romario.
Salamanca, currently 18th in the Spanish first division, are poised to make a
#2.6m bid for the Flamengo striker.
Romario is understood to be unhappy at Flamengo, who have struggled in the
Brazilian league this year, and expressed his desire to return to Spain after
scoring a hat trick in a charity America versus Europe match in Barcelona last
month.

IN spite of difficult trading conditions, Storehouse, the BhS and Mothercare
retail group, managed to raise its interim profits by 42% to #34.5m before tax.
The results were ahead of City expectations and the shares gained 10p to 332p
after an earlier jump to a high for the year of 337p.
A strong performance at Mothercare, with underlying sales growth of 2%, was
largely responsible for the improved performance although margins also improved
at BhS and costs were held.
The disposal of the discount chain One Up should help margins in the second
half. The disposal led to an extraordinary profit of #1.2m.
The interim dividend is raised by 11% to 3.0p, as part of a rebalancing
exercise between the two halves of the year. For the first time there is a
scrip dividend alternative.
The Mothercare operation has tightened up considerably since last year when
problems of overstocking led to hefty markdowns which in turn had an impact on
margins.
Mothercare's profits rose by over 120% to #9.3m. However, there is thought to
be scope to further improve the returns from the Mothercare business. This
should be aided by the steady roll-out of a new, more child-friendly format
into all the stores over the next two years.
New store openings in the period under review included one on Sauchiehall
Street in Glasgow. Sales fell by 3% on a like-for-like basis at BhS with the
unusually warm October not helping demand for women's wear. The weak housing
market affected lighting sales and children's wear and restaurant sales were
also lower.
On the plus side, lingerie and footwear did well. However, its trading profit
rose by more than 10% to #20.8m helped by lower markdowns.
The store portfolio is gradually being upgraded with refurbishments and new
store openings. During the year, the St Enoch Square BhS was upgraded and a new
store is due to open in Livingston next August.
Overseas, the franchise operations of the two stores are growing strongly. New
sites in Russia, the Philippines and Israel are under negotiation.
Despite the busy corporate development programme with capital expenditure of
#71.7m in the first half, almost matching the total for last year, the group's
financial position remains strong.
At the half year end, there was a net cash position of #56.7m producing
interest income of #3.3m. Although this will drop in the second half it will
still remain positive.

Luka Bloom is a musical whirlpool
at the heart of a Celtic trio.
DAVID BELCHER profiles an
Irishman abroad as he takes
part in his first UK tour
LUKA Bloom answers the phone in his dressing-room back-stage in a theatre in
Torquay with a jovial cry: ``Chinese laundry!'' Bloom: who he? On one level,
he's the late-blossoming younger brother of a long-established performer,
Christy Moore.
A better summary would be provided by the not-too-fanciful observation that
everyone who experienced Luka Bloom's Glasgow Royal Concert Hall show back in
January must have left feeling spiritually cleansed, hot under the collar, and
with their head in a spin. One man, one voice, one guitar: it added up to a
whirlpool of sound and emotion.
That night made a mighty impression on its star, too. ``It was a complete
shock, the reception I got. I've played to big audiences who knew me in Europe
and America, but not Britain.''
When Luka Bloom returns to Scotland next week, accompanied by Celtic
compatriots Sharon Shannon and Eleanor Shanley, he'll still be in the
best-kept-secret category, having just been dropped by his label, Warner
Brothers, after three albums. Over the years, incidentally, the same company
has done exactly the same thing to Emmylou Harris, Ry Cooder, Van Morrison and
Joni Mitchell. Is there a pattern here? Some comment about record company
notions of quality and quantity?
Mind you, it must be stated that none of Luka's trio of albums - Luka Bloom,
The Acoustic Motorbike, and Turf - came close to reflecting the power of his
live shows.
``That's a valid criticism, but one that I don't try to refute because I've
never set out to make records that reflect my gigs.
``I see myself as primarily a live artist who records, not a recording artist
who plays live occasionally.
``I hate live albums...... all whistling and clapping. Maybe I should record a
live half-hour movie with good quality sound. In a favourite club, the Paradiso
in Amsterdam, maybe.''
Luka Bloom has been playing since the Paradiso was in its fragrant heyday in
the seventies. Nevertheless, this UK tour is his first, following single shows
in London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. He has globetrotted, though, having
initially forsaken his native Kildare for Berlin and more recently California.
The UK's different, you see. In days gone by, it's been less than welcoming. If
you're Irish, come into this immigration strip-search room......
``I was at Harwich, a teenager en route home for Christmas in the year of the
Guildford pub bombings. I was kept for hours, being searched, questioned. The
abuse I got, the downright venom.
``At the time I didn't feel in any danger. I just kept thinking: `This'll be
over soon.' But then as the case of the Guildford Four emerged, I got to
thinking: `That could have been me who got picked on.'
``It affected my desire, or lack of it, to work in Britain. Maybe it's ironic
that now during the Anglo-Irish peace process, here's me making my effort to
get over my own prejudices, my historical baggage.''
Wowing the UK, the Bloom-Shanley-Shannon touring party has been uniting on four
or five songs at the end of every concert.
``There's an Irish feel, but it's not what you'd expect. It's not the standard
jig-and-reel groove.''
But what else would you expect from a fellow who invested LL Cool J's raunchy
rap tune, I Need Love, with a winsome Celtic undertow?
Turn up to press your suit with, and plight your troth to Luka Bloom next week.
n.The Celtic Swing Tour: Aberdeen Music Hall, Tuesday, and Glasgow Royal
Concert Hall, Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>HSBC Tessa Plus has modest exposure to the Footsie index</HEADLINE>

HOLDERS of Tessas due to mature shortly will soon be bombarded with offers to
switch their funds to other banks and building societies as the accumulated
capital sum of up to #9000 (not the interest) can be transferred to a new Tessa
without penalty.
One of the more intriguing is the HSBC Tessa Plus which gives a modest exposure
to the performance of the FTSE-100 index over its five-year period.
It works by paying a basic 5% fixed over five years with a bonus at the end of
up to 30% if the index rises by at least this proportion. The total return is
potentially 155%, turning #9000 into almost #14,000.
This is equivalent to a return of 9.16% compound and an average yearly return
of 11%, which compares with the best yield of 7.5% currently available on an
ordinary Tessa, though there may be some special offers come the new year.
At its present rate, the stock market will be well into new territory in
January and it is possible that it will not be 30% higher still in five years,
though this is rather unlikely.
If it is not, then the return will be lower than could be obtained from a
conventional Tessa, where the risk is confined to interest rates dropping back
and cutting the return, though there are some fixed-rate Tessas available,
albeit at a lower starting rate.
The alternative for those wanting a protected exposure to the stock market is
guaranteed bonds. They offer a return linked to the smoothed performance of an
index usually the FTSE-100. Some offer not just a capital guarantee but a
minimum return as well as the link to the index.
A variation on this is the index-tracking PEP offered by Legal &amp; General which
for an insurance premium of 4% and an elevated annual charge of 2% gives a
no-loss guarantee after five years.
While the HSBC product is innovative, many investors will not be keen on
muddling fixed interest investment with exposure to the stock market.

THE postal strike yesterday landed football with a major problem ahead of
Sunday's Coca-Cola Cup final.
The Scottish League last night told supporters heading for Hampden on Sunday -
do not come if you don`t have a ticket in your possession.
Strathclyde Police have stressed that they do not want ticketless fans around
Hampden on Sunday when there will be no tickets on sale. The league, along with
Aberdeen and Dundee, were receiving calls yesterday by anxious fans checking if
their tickets were in the post.
Although Aberdeen have sold 18,000 and Dundee 16,000, it is thought that little
more than 100 supporters are affected, but last night there was no way of
knowing for definite.
However, it was not thought there was any danger of wide open spaces at Hampden.
However, there is the possibility that supporters' clubs who had uplifted
tickets personally may have sent them out to members by post.
League official Jim Kilpatrick said: ``We know some tickets are still in the
post and the message is that if they do not arrive in time, don't come to the
game.
``When the tickets eventually arrive return them to either ourselves or the
clubs when a full refund will be given.
``We regret that this has happened, and we hope that as the final is being
shown live on television, all fans will enjoy watching it.''

SHE'S been gone for almost five years now, her face faded to a police-issue
snapshot, her bright 15-year-old personality reduced to a line in a computer
catalogue of thousands of lost souls.
But for Vicki Hamilton's father, Michael, the pain of her disappearance in
February 1991 is as present as it has ever been and has only been heightened by
fears about Frederick West's Scottish connections.
``He's got relatives up here. No-one ever found out if he was up here in 1991,
in Coatbridge. There's always that aspect of it. I read in the papers today
that they reckon there are 30 bodies under a car park but they don't reckon
they're going to dig it up. If there are 30 bodies lying down there, if Vicki
is one of them, I don't want her lying below a car park.''
The West case is just the latest in a series of ``what ifs'' which have
tormented the Hamilton family. Less than three weeks ago, one of the Falkirk
teenager's relatives overhead a conversation in a local bar which suggested her
body had been found beneath a wall.
Each time they call the authorities, deal with the new uncertainty, and carry
on waiting. ``It's the waiting, just waiting,'' says Hamilton. ``How do you get
through it? You don't really ever get through it. I just stick in at my work
and try to take my mind off it, but at the same time, it's always there. When
I'm on my own it's really bad.''
He had always been optimistic about seeing her again, but at the very back of
his mind he thinks she may be dead. He says he hasn't been contacted by the
police for 10 months and media interest in his missing daughter has tailed off.
``I think everbody just forgot about it,'' he says. ``I know there are a lot of
other girls out there who have gone.''
Officially, there are around 30,000 people reported missing every year, but
unofficial estimates suggest there may be a further 150,000 unreported
`disappeared' on the streets of British towns and cities at any one time. Some
will have been abducted, some will have gone of their own free will, others
will have been escaping abuse, still others launching themselves into what they
imagine will be an adventure.
Tracing them all is a lottery and a nightmarish one at that. The Police
National Missing Persons Bureau at New Scotland Yard was set up last year, but
it deals exclusively with ``vulnerable'' cases who have been missing for more
than 28 days; those under 18, over 65, or the mentally disordered. At the
moment they have 977 cases on their books, 443 under 18.
The bureau's work consists of trying to match information on their files with
the records of bodies which have been found, accidents, and those found
wandering the streets. Details of possible matches are sent out to local police
forces for further investigation.
Strathclyde Police have a total of 105 missing persons cases on their books,
dating back 25 to 30 years. Just yesterday they issued an appeal for a
13-year-old from Alexandria, missing from her home since November 16. Force
spokesman D..S. Ian Graham says they respond to every missing persons report,
using commonsense to judge how potentially serious the situation is.
``There is no specific time delay. If a woman says her husband went to the pub,
said he'd be back at 11pm and it's now 12, we might say OK, let's maybe leave
it. If he's not back at 2am come back to us. If it had been a 13-year-old girl
who had gone to the corner shop and had not come back we would be very
concerned about that, we'd be out searching the streets.''
The official channels, however, still leave thousands of families with
questions unanswered and nowhere to turn. It was to respond to their needs that
the National Missing Persons Bureau charity was created in 1992 by a retired
policeman.
THE charity has 14,000 people on its register and uses a variety of methods to
try and bring people back in contact with one another. It has a strict credo of
respecting everybody's right to disappear and will only put missing people back
in touch with their families if they want to do so.
NMPB spokeswoman Sophie Woodford says their key role is supporting those who
have been left behind.
``The families that are left behind go through something that is fairly
impossible to imagine. It's waiting for news, no idea what the news will be.
Completely left in limbo. One day they can be feeling quite positive and the
next they're really down. It's like a rollercoaster of emotions because they
just don't know what the outcome is going to be. If someone you love is ill you
can visit them in hospital, if someone has died you can grieve for them, if
someone is missing the family feels completely lost.''
But it is the faceless, unreported missing that most concern Scottish
journalist and author Andrew O'Hagan. People like many of Fred and Rosemary
West's victims who have cut the links, left home and have no-one looking for
them.
O'Hagan, who wrote the critically acclaimed book, Missing, said the number of
``unmissed'' is thought to reach 150,000 at any given time.
``There are a lot of young people within these parameters whose circumstances
bear enormous similarities to those of the girls who went missing in the West
case,'' he says. ``A lot of them will be similar to these new nine names. Quite
a number of these people will be Scottish.''
The Salvation Army, which runs a family tracing service, blames the increase in
the number of missing people on the fragmentation of society. O'Hagan says we
need to take a closer look at ourselves before we will find a solution to the
problem.
``It raises questions about community and society, and these are the questions
that need to be addressed. We need to be thinking about individuals. I think
there is a general failure of empathy. We don't quite notice people. The way it
happened in the West case, these girls, more than half of them had never been
reported as missing.
``The first reponsibility is for people themselves to take note of how people
live their lives and how they move. I think this is all part of a quite
obnoxious individualsim we have had over the past 16 years. We think only of
our own front doors.''
During his research for the book, O'Hagan spent time with the families of those
who had gone missing and found it a humbling experience.
``It is difficult to think of a situation that is worse. It's the agony of not
knowing, they never move on, there's just this great central agony.''
For Michael Hamilton, it is of little comfort that other families are enduring
the same agony. It is not an experience he would wish on anybody.
``They must be going through hell,'' he says. ``Where is she? What's she doing?
All the questions you ask.''

n.CUSTOMERS whose credit card payments are stuck in the post because of the
strike are being promised a sympathetic ear by the banks. Which is more than
they're likely to get from Royal Mail.
Asked if they would pay compensation to anyone incurring interest charges for
failing to deliver cheques on time, a spokesman told Check-Out: ``They'll have
to pursue the postal workers union, not us.''
The Royal Bank of Scotland is among those who will take the exceptional
circumstances into account. People awaiting statements are advised to phone
their credit card company or use ATMs to find out what they owe. Giro payments
can then be made at banks or transfers authorised by phone.
Meantime, Edinburgh Scouts are launching a city-wide Christmas delivery service
on Monday for just 15p a card. They expect their postbag to top half a million.
For details of collection points phone 0131 229 3756.
n.DO your bit for the environment by opting for a real Christmas tree next
month: it's estimated that the millions grown in Britain rid the atmosphere of
50,000 tons of harmful carbon dioxide each year.
Making artificial trees depletes energy resources and they produce toxic gasses
when burnt on rubbish tips.
According to producers, while the hot, dry summer has taken its toll, top
quality six to seven foot Scots pines are available for between #10 and #15.
Recommended suppliers in Scotland include Buccleuch Estates in Dumfriesshire

n.IF critics who blame Princess Diana's problems on emotional stress and
bulimia nervosa are right, she might benefit from extra Vitamin B12.
The Princess's eating disorders are likely to have depleted her reserves of
this vital, but little understood, vitamin which, American researchers now
claim, can cure depression and insomnia. B12 deficiency can also be
misdiagnosed as psychiatric disorders, they say.
As the richest sources of B12 are liver, kidneys and shellfish, vegans and
vegetarians are particularly vulnerable and should take health store
supplements.

MURRAY Johnstone's Emerging Economies Trust was hard hit by the effect of the
Mexican financial crisis in its first year.
But the #45.5m trust, launched in September 1994, was lucky not to be fully
invested when the Mexican crisis struck three months later and this helped
limit the damage.
The trust has a quarter of its assets invested in Latin America.
Net asset value fell 12.4% to 83.63p during the 57 weeks to October 31, whereas
the trust's benchmark, the International Finance Corporation Investible Index,
fell 21.2% in sterling terms over the same period.
The trust dipped into revenue of #1.7m to pay out a final dividend of 1.0p per
share.
Murray Johnstone, which manages the trust from Glasgow, said the immediate
prospects for recovery in emerging markets were not bright since the recent
pick-up in the United States and Japan had diverted capital away from them.
It noted that the trust's board had approved #5m of long-term borrowing.
Meanwhile, broker Exco yesterday warned that taxable profits in 1995 would be
significantly lower than City expectations.
When it published its interims in the summer, the company said that the second
half of the year was traditionally quieter.
The group said it believed turnover would be down by 13% in the 12-month
period, a similar drop to the first six months.
A major cost-cutting and restructuring programme is already in place which
should reduce operating costs by #15m annually. An unchanged total dividend
payout of 9p per share is expected.

I WENT to Wembley yesterday - not, disappointingly, to see a ball being kicked,
but to visit the massive Railtex exhibition at the adjacent conference centre.
This is where the railway manufacturing industries show their wares.
There are a lot of them, with tens of thousands of jobs at stake. Britain is
still up there with the world leaders in terms of the equipment which goes into
trains. But, as in so many other areas of serious manufacturing before it, the
pace of decline is now precipitous.
This is not because nobody wants what our companies make. On the contrary, the
export market is booming. But an industry of this kind also needs a home market
and that is what is now in a state of extended hiatus. Last year alone, 5000
jobs were lost in railway manufacturing.
Indeed, probably the greatest irony within the whole rail privatisation fiasco
lies in the fact that it is the existing private sector which is bleeding
hardest and fastest, because so little investment is now going into the
railways.
And the passenger is beginning to notice in a big way. Within the past week, we
have had the public shouting match between Railtrack and ScotRail; the latter
blaming the former for delays on the Glasgow-Edinburgh route through lack of
maintenance and investment.
Up north, passengers between Inverness and Kyle were collected by bus - not, as
would be understandable, because of workings on the line, but because there
were no trains available in working order!
This all fits in rather grimly with the revelation earlier this week that
Railtrack has salted #1.14billion in a single year as a nest-featherer for
privatisation. This is money paid to them by the train operators and which
should be going into investment and maintenance.
It takes a very expert reading of the accounts to appreciate that this is not
in fact happening. But it is a case in which the people at the sharp end -
standing on station platforms around the country - could certainly have tipped
off the accountants about the consequences, if not the mechanisms being used.
The question of who would invest in the railways has all along been at the
heart of the case against privatisation. Last week it was brought into sharp
relief by the comments of James Sherwood, president of Sea Containers, who
envisages only a ``deteriorating railway'' and does not want to be part of it.
He has pulled his company out of bidding for franchises.
Meanwhile both Railtrack and the unregulated rolling-stock leasing companies
are guaranteed their revenue streams without having to make any commitment to
investment programmes. It is a formula which threatens precisely the
deterioration which Sherwood predicts.
Taken in conjunction with the other eccentricities of rail privatisation, the
investment factor justifies Labour's determination to halt - and if necessary
to reverse - the process of fragmentation and privatisation.
Last night the whole process descended even deeper into farce, with my
revelation that the managing director of Resurgence Railways - who have been
selected to run the railway of Brunel, the historic Great Western - was
previously the managing director of a double-glazing firm, which went into
liquidation earlier this year!
This tends to confirm that the Tories are now in such a state of desperation
and ideological over-commitment to rail privatisation that they are prepared to
give the franchises away, almost literally to anyone who will take them.
I remember, during the Committee stages of the Railway Bill, inventing a
fictional private train operator called ``Spivrail''. The Tories went
apoplectic about this slight upon the glories of private enterprise. Gradually,
my fiction is looking increasingly like fact.
Nobody should be in any doubt about Labour's commitment to a publicly owned and
accountable national rail network. However, the obvious first step towards
achieving this end is to miminise the extent of privatisation before a General
Election.
This is where the role of investors is crucial and I will continue to spell out
to them the risks inherent in touching the Tory scheme with a barge-pole. We
have overwhelming public opinion on our side, while comparisons with previous
sell-offs are irrelevant, since this is the only one which would continue to be
dependent upon taxpayers' subsidy for its profitability.
There is then no paradox in stating that Labour is eager and enthusiastic about
the prospect of harnessing private investment for the railway industry. There
are many ways of doing this without breaking up the national network.
If we can add to it through partnership schemes, then well and good.
But as for handing over railway operations to Spivrail or its close cousins, or
leaving Railtrack to cream off vast profits from taxpayers' money while the
network is starved of investment? Forget it. And the more strongly electoral
opinion expresses itself against this nonsense, the better the chance of
defeating it.

IMAGINE a one-off tax bill from the Revenue for #1638m. That's almost enough to
knock a penny off the standard rate for every income tax payer in the land. It
represents eight per cent of the entire Exchequer take from UK corporation tax
in 1994/95, according to the last Red Book forecast.
We are not talking here about the wild dream of some would-be Chancellor. That
demand was paid by one as-yet-unidentified company, in the 1994/95 tax year, as
a result of Revenue non-compliance investigations which, in total, pulled in an
additional #4047m taxes. With characteristic understatement, our man in the
bowler hat called that one payment ``unusually large''.
The Revenue tucked the news away in one paragraph of its last annual report.
There has been plenty of speculation about who the hapless victim may have
been. Pharmaceuticals firm Glaxo, since merged with Wellcome, has denied it was
the one to cough up. It was suspected bacause it is engaged in a major legal
tussle with the tax inspectors on an issue which, almost certainly, lies at the
root of that mega back-dated tax bill.
They call it transfer pricing. It's all about precisely where, in the complex
chain from production through to final sales, multinationals account for
profits and pay tax on them. When you are operating across national boundaries,
it makes sense to maximise profits in low tax regimes and minimise them in
higher tax regimes.
So, for example, a multinational subsidiary making or assembling goods in one
country, where corporate taxes are relatively high, will sell the products on
to a sales and distribution subsidiary in a country where corporate taxes are
lower, at little more than cost of production. The distribution company racks
up the real profits, and pays the lower rate of tax on them.
UK ministers like to boast that, at 33%, our standard corporation tax rate is
among the lowest in the developed world. Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
made the point again on Monday, at the Scottish Financial Enterprise annual
dinner, whilst urging the Scottish business community to oppose any
constitutional change which brings with it what he has dubbed Labour's
additional tartan tax.
However, even within the European Union with its pretence of a single market
and a level playing field, there are member countries which dramatically
undercut that UK rate, in special circumstances. It's well known Ireland offers
inward investors a 10% corporation tax rate until 2010. It's much less well
known Holland, in its bid to become the main distribution hub for Europe,
offers an effective rate of 3.5% for multinationals siting warehousing and
sales operations around ports like Rotterdam.
As a result, American companies assembling personal computers in Scotland for
sale throughout Europe have a financial incentive to set up their main European
sales and marketing arm in Holland.
Needless to say, UK Inland Revenue inspectors are suspicious of such
multinational transfer pricing arrangements, which minimise both margins and
the resultant tax take here. If they can pick legal holes in these
arrangements, they pounce and slap on an additional tax demand, back-dated over
six years. That, almost certainly, is the fate which befell the nameless
company which coughed up #1638m.
According to a recent survey of 210 multinationals by accountants Ernst &amp;
Young, 49% were being investigated by the Revenue on their transfer pricing
arrangements. An astonishing 83% had been involved in a transfer pricing
dispute with the British tax authorities at some time in the past.
When I raised the issue with Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch he neatly
side-stepped it, saying: ``Where the profit element is accounted for is not
necessarily the main benefit from inward investment. The main benefit is that
we are providing employment and therefore bringing wealth creation to this
country.
``The spin-off effect of all the supply potential and the ability of the people
working for that company to spend are just as important as corporation tax at
the other end.''
That is one view. But, when the front-end cost to the Government, in grants and
other assistance, of luring inward investors here can be as much as #25,000 a
job, the back-end loss of corporation tax revenue on the scale indicated by
that single billion-and-a-half pay-back raises large, but almost entirely
unventilated, questions.
That one company paid the equivalent of more than three times the maximum
annual take from what Mr Forsyth has dubbed the Scottish parliament's tartan
tax. Under the Convention plans, the Edinburgh assembly will have no power to
tax business. Despite that, Mr Forsyth insists the tartan tax will scare inward
investors away from Scotland.
I would have thought the Inland Revenue's determination to get tough on
multinational transfer pricing - a determination likely to be underpinned by
clearer rules in the forthcoming Finance Bill - poses a more direct threat to
inward investors contemplating opening manufacturing plants in Britain than any
tartan tax. It will, after all, hit hard their own pockets.
Other countries, like the US, Australia and Germany, are tightening up on how
multinationals account for profits. With the Inland Revenue here determined to
do the same, it is critical fresh pressure is put on Brussels to outlaw
sweetheart tax deals of the sort developed in Dublin and The Hague. Only then
can we develop a more level fiscal playing field in the EU, as far as
multinationals are concerned.
The danger is that ministers, more concerned with the jobs inward investors
bring than any contribution they make to national tax revenues, will sanction
private understandings with key inward investors as to where their profits will
be declared and taxed. If the Revenue is to get tough, it should get tough with
everyone.
