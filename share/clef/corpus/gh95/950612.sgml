TOMMY Svensson will spend the summer wondering how he can stop
Sweden's slide into obscurity. Shu Kamo, meanwhile, will be debating
whether to continue in charge of Japan when his contract ends in
November.
Japan's emergence as a serious footballing force has been almost as
rapid as Sweden's decline. It was, therefore, little surprise that when
the countries met for the first time, the result was a 2-2 draw in the
Umbro Cup at the City Ground in Nottingham.
A goal from Hisashi Kurosaki four minutes from time gave the Asians a
share of the spoils and their first point in the tournament after losing
with dignity to England and receiving a lesson from Brazil.
Swedish coach Svensson was left shaking his head in disbelief for the
second time in 48 hours -- his side conceded two goals in the final two
minutes against England at Leeds.
Considering they finished third in the World Cup less than a year ago,
their slump has been alarming. Sweden have not won in seven matches and
have scraped draws against Cyprus, Iceland, and now Japan.
Kennet Andersson, a one-time target for Sheffield Wednesday, seemed to
have put them in the driving seat with two second-half goals after
Toshiya Fujita had opened the scoring. But Kurosaki made the Swedes pay
for their complacency.
Japan have improved considerably since Kamo was appointed last
December. But whether he will be there to guide them through the next
stage of their development remains to be seen.
He said: ''My contract ends in November and I will think about my
future during the summer. I feel that you always learn something from a
game and we are growing in confidence. Our defence is better than our
attack and that is one side of our game we must work on.''

IN THE ''Last Word'' today, John Beattie writes ''Dalton may or may
not have been the guilty party, or he might not have been guilty at all,
but he must now be banned from the rest of the tournament.''
So much for justice. John Beattie's words remind me of school days
when the entire class was belted because the teacher couldn't find out
who had talked in class.
There is no doubt, if Dalton was guilty he should be suspended. If he
was not, then he has the right to play on. Surely the video evidence
should provide a satisfactory answer, one way or the other.

IN a busy week for economic indicators the Mansion House dinner in the
City on Wednesday could easily steel the show.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of
the Bank of England, Eddie George, will both be on parade.
The two men's speeches will be closely studied this year for
differences of emphasis on monetary policy. Last year the Governor stole
the show with his forecast that interest rates would not fall any
further. Within three months they were on their way up again.
There has been some speculation that the Chancellor will use the
occasion to restate the Government's inflation target, possibly in terms
of the new RPIY measure of inflation.
But the recent rift between Mr Clarke and Mr George over interest
rates hardly makes the circumstances propitious.
The following morning May's retail price index will be published.
Capel economists are looking for a rise of 0.5% on the month.
This would give a headline rate of 3.5% against 3.3% in April. The
underlying rate, RPIX, would edge up from 2.6% to 2.7%, and RPIY would
be unchanged at 2.1%.
The inflation figures coincide with the retail sales figures. A rise
of 0.5% in May would result in the year-on-year rate rising from 0.8% to
1.4%.
Later today factory gate price inflation of 0.4% last month is
expected, taking the annual rate up to 4.2% from 4% in April. Input
prices may gain 0.3%, allowing the annual rate to drop back from 11.5%
to 10.2%.
Continuation of the recent trend would produce a fall of around 20,000
in May unemployment, but average earnings growth in April is likely to
rise from 3.5% to 3.75% as the bonus effect begins to drop out of the
equation.
Capel is forecasting a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement of #3500m
in May, #700m lower than a year earlier.
TODAY -- Producer prices (May).
TOMORROW -- Construction: new orders (April).
WEDNESDAY -- Unemployment (May); average earnings (April).
THURSDAY -- Retail price index (May); retail sales (May).
FRIDAY -- PSBR (May).

ALTHOUGH a comparatively new fixture on the calendar, Royal Gourock
Yacht Club's Ashton Regatta already musters a strong following and on
Saturday proved one of the better attended events of the Clyde
championship.
Simon Pender, in the closely matched one design class, steered the
Sigma 33 St Joan to victory after trailing in third place for most of
the Olympic triangle. With the breeze from the north-west giving a good,
testing opening leg to Strone Point it was the Gourock shore where the
wind was at its most wilful, trapping many for long periods while others
were left untroubled. Pender recovered from such problems to overhaul
long time race, and series, leader Sigmatic, sailed by Donald McLaren.
In the Sonata class, Graham Campbell triumphed at the helm of Kooshtie
after reading the wind on the opening beat best. Results:
Ashton Regatta: Class 1 -- Joyride (L Samuels); 2, T Jig (J Dryburgh);
3, Salamander XII (J Corson). Etchells -- 1, Firedance (J Thomson); 2,
Flying Colours (A Marr); 3, Bullet (J Watson). Class 2 -- 1, Vigil (A
Harvey); 2, Enigma (H Morrison, P Birrell). Sigma 33 -- 1, St Joan (S
Pender/I Nicolson); 2, Sigmatic (D McLaren/S Nunn); 3, Boojum. IOD -- 1,
Mighty Mo. Class 3 -- 1, Aggro II (B McLean). Sonata -- 1, Kooshtie (G
Campbell); 2, Jammy Dodger (H Cairns); 3, Triad (D Munro).
CCC Zigeuner Trophy (Clyde-Bangor): Class 1 -- Moonshine (J and P
Fowler) 10hr 15min 36sec; 2, Jus Do It (I Darby) 10-21-29. Class 2-4 --
1, Dione (H Bryan) 10-19-25; 2, Quaila (H Morrison) 10-22-04; 3, Lemarac
(B Tunnock) 11-16-19.

THE South of Scotland have taken the initiative by declaring their
team for this Saturday's senior representative match at Taynuilt. Beaten
Camanachd Cup finalists Oban Camanachd form the back-bone of the side
with five players in the starting line-up. The north declared a pool of
17 as they bid to win the Caol Cup for the fifth time in a row. Teams:
South: J MacGregor (Oban Camanachd), F MacDonald (Kyles), N MacInnes
(Oban Camanachd) B Hughes (Oban Celtic), A Mackechnie, M
MacFarlane-Barrow (both Glenorchy), A MacInnes (Glasgow Mid Argyll), F
Inglis (Oban Camanachd), G MacPherson (Inveraray), D MacRae (Kyles), D
McCuish, D MacIntyre (both Oban Camanachd). Substitutes: Graham
MacPherson (Inveraray), E Crawford (Mid Argyll), I Hay (Oban Celtic), A
Watt (Inveraray).
North: I Anderson, D Anderson, A Borthwick, D Borthwick, S Borthwick
(all Kingussie), J Clark (Fort William), M Clark (Kingussie), W Cowie
(Skye), E Cheyne (Newtonmore), G MacMillan (Fort William), R MacKenzie
(Lovat), W MacDonald (Fort William), N MacArthur (Newtonmore), R Ross
(Kingussie), M Thain (Kingussie), V Smith (Fort William), G Young
(Glenurquhart).
* THE last north final of the season, for the Valerie Fraser Cup,
produced one of the best finishes of the year, with Lochcarron and
Strathglass needing extra time to separate them.
Strath took the lead in just six minutes through Colin MacKenzie, but
David Cameron equalised 17 minutes later. Ten minutes after that the
teams traded goals again.
It was only in extra time that Lochcarron's staying power told. Ian
MacKenzie put them ahead and then David MacKenzie produced the sucker
punch with two goals in a minute.

BOWLS
STATISTICALLY, all four sections in the CIS Insurance Counties Bowls
Championship are still open with just this week's final round of matches
to come, but realistically Lanarkshire West, Edinburgh and Leith, and
Aberdeen and Kincardine can start preparing for the semi-finals later
this month.
Only the South section goes to the wire with Lanarkshire South and
Ayrshire clashing at Houldsworth this Saturday to decide who will
complete the line-up.
Lanarkshire West completed their programme in the West section on
Saturday, when they beat Dumbartonshire West 134-108 in their top-of-the
table clash at Cardross. That win pushed the Lanarkshire side two points
clear and Dumbartonshire West would require to win by at least 105 shots
this week to deprive them of top spot.
Aberdeen and Kincardine are in an even stronger position in the North.
Their 124-115 win over Perthshire at Strathmore leaves them two points
clear of Northern Counties and with a shots differential of plus 192.
Defending champions Linlithgowshire's 122-112 defeat by West Fife at
Buchan Park put them out of the East section race and leaves Edinburgh
and Leith two points clear of Borders and West Fife.

DOUGIE Potter, chief coach to the Scottish men's hockey elite youth
development squad, puts great emphasis on teaching his young charges
good habits, and there is none better than a winning habit, as
demonstrated over the weekend by the under-15s after a stuttering start
against Wales in their three-match series, writes Joseph Dillon.
In the opening test Scotland were twice in arrears, but responded each
time through Scott McArtney and Laurence Docherty. On Saturday night,
they triumphed 5-0 with Niall Stott, Stephen Traynor, Alan Meikle, David
Mitchell and McArtney sharing the goals. McArtney confirmed his position
as the team's top scorer by netting two of their goals in yesterday's
4-0 victory. Alan Johnson also found the net twice.
Meanwhile, at the agm of the SHU on Saturday Jackie Burnett was
elected convener of the competitions committee, while in Wales the men's
and women's associations at their agms agreed to amalgamate.

THOMAS Muster confirmed himself king of clay when he became the first
Austrian to win a grand slam title in Paris yesterday. Muster took the
French Open title by defeating American Michael Chang 7-5, 6-2, 6-4.
Undefeated on the clay surface this season, Muster overpowered the
1989 winner in just over two hours for his thirty-fifth consecutive
victory on slow courts.
Muster, a semi-finalist in 1990 -- his best previous result in a grand
slam event -- also became the first player since Ilie Nastase in 1973 to
win the three major tournaments played on clay, at Monte Carlo, Rome and
Paris.
Muster, whose victory will take him to a career-best third place in
the ATP Tour rankings, said: ''It's a wonderful day for me. My dreams
since I was a kid have come true today.''
''I'm the happiest person in the world and I hope it won't change my
life,'' added the Austrian, who was once quoted as saying: ''Tennis is
my life''.
The 27-year-old from Leibnitz, struggled at the start of his
first-ever grand slam final as he trailed Chang 5-2 in the first set.
Chang had outpaced his opponent, sending superb forehands down the
lines, but could not maintain his frenetic pace.
Muster, the first left-handed winner since Ecuador's Andres Gomez in
1990, raised his game to break the American and level at 5-5.
Serving for the set, Muster did not miss the opportunity to take it in
47 minutes as the American made a series of unforced errors.
Chang, who had become the youngest ever winner of a grand slam event
when he triumphed in 1989 at 17 years and three months, continued to
waver in the second set.
Muster, on the other hand, was fully in charge and it took him only
half an hour to win the set.
Looking tired, Chang tried to rush to the net in the third set to make
rallies shorter. It worked briefly as he came back from a break down in
the eighth game. But Muster broke again straightaway to serve for the
match and win it in just over two hours as Chang hit a forehand wide.
He then collapsed on centre court before rushing to the stands to hug
his weeping coach Ronald Leitgeb.
Muster, who will receive a cheque for #440,000, has now plenty of time
to enjoy the biggest victory in his career as he has decided not to
compete at Wimbledon next month after four first-round exits there.
Steffi Graf, on Saturday, wrested the women's title and the world No.1
slot from arch-rival Arantxa Sanchez Vicario with a gripping three-set
win.
The German beat the defending champion from Barcelona, 7-5, 4-6, 6-0
in a magnificent match to win her fourth French Open and sixteenth Grand
Slam title.
It was sweet revenge for one of the biggest upsets in Graf's record --
the Spaniard's win in the 1989 final in Paris, when Sanchez was only 17.
Afterwards, an elated Graf, who has suffered from illness and injury
problems, said: ''It's been a tough year. I played only four
tournaments, so to come here and win is incredible. I didn't really
expect to be here. I didn't think I could even get to the final. It
means everything to me.''
The German second seed, who had not won a major crown since the
Australian Open in 1994, looking jittery at first. She went 3-1 down,
but then got her big forehand going to take a 5-3 lead.
The dogged Spaniard broke her as she served for the set and then saved
a set point on her own serve, but Graf finally took the set 7-5 shortly
after a 20-minute interruption for rain.
Graf opened strongly in the second, but Sanchez took four games in a
row then went to win 6-4 and take the match into a decisive third set.
The German showed her determination, however, she roared to a 5-0 lead
before rain again interrupted play. And when play resumed after a
40-minute delay, she finished off the match in less than four minutes,
winning on her second match-point when Sanchez put a forehand out.

STIRLING'S Kevin Plank landed a golden sculling double at Strathclyde
Park in the Scottish Rowing Championships over the weekend, writes Mike
Haggerty. He followed up a six-second victory over Commonwealth bronze
medallist Martin Holmes in Saturday's open final with an even more
emphatic win in yesterday's lightweight event. Plank now goes on to the
British championships in Nottingham next month with clear medal hopes in
the lightweight event.
The Aberdeen duo of Drew Hendry and Richard Harris beat Plank in the
medal count, taking three golds. On Saturday, they beat both the
seven-minute barrier to take the open pairs title before joining forces
with John Walters and Tony McDowall to win yesterday's coxless fours.
Clydesdale dominated the women's categories with victories in eights,
fours, double sculls, and single sculls, while juniors Laura Fitzgibbon
and Katrina Hastings overpowered an experienced field to win the women's
open pairs title.

AMERICAN FOOTBALL
THE Scottish Claymores saved their best for last and gave their fans
something to cheer when they defeated the London Monarchs 22-9 in front
of 11,783 fans at White Hart Lane on Saturday in their final game of the
1995 World League season.
After brave defence by the Monarchs, running back Siran Stacy used his
power to batter the ball close to the Monarchs line and on the fifteenth
play of the 99 yard drive it was quarterback Terry Karg who fittingly
punched in the Scot's opening touchdown diving in from one yard. Kicker
Sean Conely converted the extra point to make it 7-0.
Monarch's kicker Don Silvestri put through two field goals from 39 and
32 yards as the London offence stuttered at the hands of the Claymore's
defence making it 7-6 in the third quarter.
Then firecracker Karg ignited again, whipping a deep pass down the
sideline for receiver Allen Degraffenreid, who sprinted 35 yards into
the endzone.
Conely's point after made it 14-6 and he added to that total after
another explosive Stacy run brought the Scots once again into scoring
range with six minutes left in the third quarter.
Again London couldn't run on the Claymore's defence and Silvestri was
forced to kick another field goal from 33 yards to make it 17-9.
With four minutes remaining Conely kicked another field goal from 32
yards. Scot Ben Torriero then pinned the Monarchs at their two-yard line
with a superb punt, and two plays later Mike Brandon sacked London
quarterback Kevin McDougall in his own endzone which resulted in a
two-point safety which capped the victory.

DENNIS Bergkamp, currently negotiating a transfer to Aston Villa, has
been criticised for contributing to a surprising crisis emerging in
Dutch football.
The fortunes of the national team contrast starkly with the success of
Ajax in winning the European Cup and last week's defeat by Belarus has
put the futures of several of their players in doubt.
Bergkamp, who pulled out complaining of a groin injury just an hour
before the Dutch party flew out, heads the list under attack.
Holland's chances of qualifying for the European Championship finals
were only kept alive by Luxembourg's unlikely victory over the Czech
Republic, but coach Guus Hiddink maintained: ''Bergkamp was totally
unprofessional. It is time he showed what he is all about and lived up
to his reputation.
''Our performance was the worst from any Dutch team for the past 10
years. We are in a state of crisis and it has been caused because many
of our players do not have the passion, desire, or heart for our cause.
''They are fulfilled, over-paid, and over-content. Our rivals earn
only $50 a month but they still showed more appetite for the game. That
was the difference and we must rediscover this quality or suffer the
consequences.''
Bergkamp, who has been told he is surplus to requirements at
Internazionale by owner Massimo Moratti, also has options to join AS
Monaco, Paris St Germain, and Barcelona.
* IN a list newly published by UEFA, Scotland lie in eighth place in
terms of success in European club competition. The table is:
1, England (24); 2, Italy (22); 3, Spain (21); 4, Germany (13); 5,
Holland (10); 6, Portugal (4); 7, Belgium (4); 8, Scotland (3).
* ST Etienne's place in the French first division has been preserved
due to the fact that Olympique Marseille won promotion. This was refused
because of the club's debts and St Etienne escaped the drop.
But forcible relegation to a lower league for Marseille was averted
after a consortium headed by the mayor of the city won control and paid
off #5m to creditors.
* CHILEAN striker Ivan Zamorano, whose 28 goals helped Real Madrid to
the Spanish title for the first time in five years, is demanding his
salary be doubled to #1.4m to sign a new contract.
The Brazilian, Bebeto, has succeeded in hiking his terms to #3m for a
new two-year deal at Deportivo la Coruna. His countryman, Edmundo, has
clinched similar terms in moving from Palmeires to Flamengo.
* UEFA have ordered Croatia, who head Group 4 in the European
Championships, to play their last two ties away from home for safety
reasons.
The games are against Estonia and Italy and the edict will benefit the
latter who are second in the group.

CARL Thompson can count on a world title re-match -- but when is the
major question. The hugely-unlucky Manchester boxer was ahead on all
three judges' cards when his right shoulder dislocated and Germany's
Ralf Rocchigiani was handed the World Boxing Organisation cruiserweight
title after 38 seconds of round 11 at the G-Mex Centre on Saturday.
Thompson, who went to the Manchester Royal Infirmary for treatment,
said: ''The shoulder popped out when I threw a punch and missed in the
tenth round. I would have carried on, but it just wasn't possible. I
hope that I get a re-match. I'll come again.''
* AMERICAN Tommy Morrison stopped Canada's Donovan ''Razor'' Ruddock
with five seconds remaining of the sixth round in Kansas City, Missouri,
to capture the International Boxing Council's vacant heavyweight title
and resurrect his flagging career.
Morrison appeared tired in the fourth round, but came back and knocked
down Ruddock with a powerful left hook early in the sixth before
finishing him off with a right-left combination.
On the same bill, veteran Roberto Duran knocked out Roni Martinez with
a flurry of punches in the seventh round to win the IBC
super-middleweight title.

GOLF:
COLIN Montgomerie will come under extreme pressure at the US Open this
week to untie the label depicting him as the best European professional
yet to capture a major title. On Saturday at Hoylake, Montgomerie's
fellow Scot, Gordon Sherry, pre-empted him by winning the Amateur
Championship.
As runner-up for the title 12 months before, having taken second place
in four important strokeplay tournaments since, as well as having been a
semi-finalist in last year's Scottish championship, Sherry could be
forgiven for ''starting to wonder when something was going to come my
way.''
In fact, since the First World War only 10 players have had more
resounding victories than the 7 and 6 defeat Barassie's Sherry inflicted
on Moseley's Michael Reynard, and the hundredth champion became the
first golfer since the American Dick Chapman, in 1950 and 1951, to lose
and win the 36-hole final in successive years,
Reflecting on the difference of fortune which 12 months had made to
his golfing career and attitude, Sherry reflected: ''It's a dream come
true after the disappointment of losing to Lee James at Nairn. Even so,
that defeat was a great experience which has stood me in good stead.''
Looking back on a gruelling week, Sherry, not surprisingly, picked out
his quarter-final game against David Howell, the English
internationalist, as the crucial episode. ''One moment I was three down
with six to play,'' he said. ''In the next I was in the final.''
Perhaps it was his self-confessed perfectionism which carried Sherry
through. ''Unless I hit a shot well, I'm unhappy. I may be always
complaining, but that's just to make me try a bit harder.''
The unprecedented incident, when the Englishman was penalised a hole
for being late on the tee for the second round, did nothing to diminish
Sherry's achievement. He was already eight up after a devastating inward
half before lunch.
His figures of 33, three under par, for a score of 69 illuminated the
sombre, soggy weather and relieved the ponderous pace of play which took
the match to within six minutes of the generous time limit of 3 hours 57
minutes allowed by the committee for the completion of 18 holes.
It was all a far cry from the most entertaining final this observer
has seen -- at Formby in 1967, when one American, Bob Dickson, beat
another, Ron Cerrudo, by 2 and 1 in a total playing time of less than
six hours. Golf is in danger of becoming the most boring of spectator
sports.
These finalists, through no-one's fault but their own, had scarcely 40
minutes for rest and sustenance, but whereas Sherry was more than prompt
in again answering the starter's call, Reynard was apparently under the
impression that the second round was to begin 15 minutes later than was
clearly advised.
Although Reynard put a better complexion on the result by winning his
only four holes on the afternoon's outward half, Sherry contributed to
this modest counter-attack which lent respectability to the record book
entry. He lost some concentration and ''started to count the number of
holes left.''
Entry to the Scottish Open, the Open Championship, and next year's US
Masters are among the spoils of this war, but more important to Sherry
is playing for Britain and Ireland's Walker Cup side against the United
States at Royal Porthcawl in September -- and victory. ''Bring on Tiger
Woods,'' he said airily, referring to his redoubtable American
counterpart.

GOLF: DEUTSCHE BANK OPEN
BERNHARD Langer led from the start to gain a ninth European Tour
victory in his native Germany as he landed the Deutsche Bank Open title
in Hamburg yesterday with an 18-under-par aggregate of 270.
The German shot a last-round 69 to beat Jamie Spence (70) by six
strokes and Mats Lanner (66) by seven to stretch the field and gain the
easiest win of any player on the Tour this year.
It was Langer's thirty-third Tour victory, his forty-fifth world-wide
and his second win in a row after also claiming the Volvo PGA
Championship at Wentworth two weeks ago.
He extended his own European Tour record of successive halfway cuts to
58, went back to the top of the order of merit, took over the lead from
Seve Ballesteros in the Ryder Cup points table, and amazed his vast
following by winning so easily despite having a sore throat and cold all
week.
Now he is off to America to compete in the US Open at Shinnecock Hills
and said: ''I don't know why I played so well this week, because I have
felt awful.
''I just hope I will be feeling better when I get to America. But I
have won my last two tournaments and if I can keep my game in the same
sort of shape, I might have a chance.''
Langer, who had three birdies and 15 pars yesterday, put up an
astounding performance, but all credit to his playing partner over the
last two rounds, Spence, who shot 69 in the third round and 70 yesterday
to have his best finish for more than two years.
Spence admitted that he was really only playing for second place, but
he never became anxious even though Lanner, very briefly, went ahead of
him after shooting 39 for the first 11 holes yesterday.
Spence, who had struggled to the turn in 37, one over par, birdied the
eleventh, twelfth and fourteenth. He came to the last needing a par 4
for outright second place and a cheque for #72,210. He safely hit the
green in two and then, from 15 feet, calmly rolled the ball to an inch
from the hole to achieve his goal.
Colin Montgomerie and Ian Woosnam who, like Langer, are competing in
the US Open, were disappointed with their showings. Montgomerie shot a
level-par 72 to finish on 285, three under par, while Woosnam ended on
287, but at least had the consolation of a 67 yesterday, his best round
of the week.
Sam Torrance added to his Ryder Cup points -- and his bank balance --
by finishing joint fifth with Costantino Rocca, while Steve McAllister's
return to form earned him a healthy cheque in joint seventh place on
281, one ahead of Gary Orr.

DAVIS Love tees off the final round in the Kemper Open in Maryland
still shaken after one of his shots struck a woman spectator during
Saturday's third round.
The woman was struck on the head by Love's drive at the sixth at the
Avenel TPC course.
She was treated in hospital for swelling and bleeding in her inner
ear, but fortunately suffered no serious injury and was due to be
released later in the day.
A disturbed Love rushed up to the woman who was already being attended
to by medical personnel.
When he resumed his round, Love bogeyed the hole.
Love, who had begun the third round with a three-stroke lead, was
clearly upset and frittered away his advantage. However, he regained the
lead with a birdie at the 301-yard par-4 fourteenth, where he drove the
green.
He goes into the final round at 11-under 202 after a par 71, one
stroke clear of fellow American Payne Stewart (65), with Corey Pavin two
shots behind after equalling the course record 63.
He remained concerned at the woman's condition long after his third
round.
''It's why I won't let my wife bring our kids out on the course,''
said Love, who explained that he often worried about hitting spectators.
''I've hit Fred Couples' girlfriend and Mark Wiebe's wife before. I
once hit a man with a No.9 iron and he just keeled over.
''The drive is the most dangerous time because people walk ahead and
don't watch you hit your shot. You're less likely to hit someone around
the green because they're usually watching.''
Stewart moved into contention with four successive birdies starting at
the fifth. After a three-putt bogey at the ninth he added three more
birdies on the back nine.
''From where my game was last week to where it is this week is night
and day,'' said Stewart.
He barely made the cut at last week's Memorial but, after a telephone
conversation with coach Chuck Cook, closed his stance and started
swinging inside the line.
The change was so successful that by the time Cook arrived on Friday
to look at Stewart's swing, he was barely needed.
''I started hitting the ball well on Thursday and Friday,'' explained
Stewart, the 1991 US Open champion who subsequently endured a nearly
four-year drought before winning the Houston Open in April.

help him to the turn in three-under-par 29.

CANADIAN GRAND PRIX
DAMON HILL was handed a championship lifeline yesterday as birthday
boy Jean Alesi celebrated the first victory of his 91-race career after
a dramatic climax to the Canadian Grand Prix.
World champion Michael Schumacher looked set to extend his lead to 15
points over Hill, who had dropped out of the race, when his car suddenly
developed technical problems 10 laps from the finish.
The German was holding a 30-second advantage, but as he limped into
the pits the 31-year-old Frenchman charged through to end his search for
a grand prix victory.
Hill's challenge ended when his Williams Renault also hit technical
problems 16 laps from the chequered flag. Although Schumacher recovered,
he could finish only fifth to open up a seven-point gap.
Scot David Coulthard started in third place on the grid, but spun off
after just two laps.
However, there was joy for Eddie Irvine, who celebrated the best
finish of his career by coming home third, just behind his Jordan
Peugeot team-mate Rubens Barrichello.
Irvine was the only British driver to finish the race as McLaren's
Mark Blundell spun out of contention with just 20 laps left when he was
on course for another high placing.
Johnny Herbert's race ended on the first lap when his Benetton became
entangled with Mika Hakkinen's McLaren Mercedes.
Martin Brundle, who was set for a points finish, was involved in more
controversy after a collision with Gerhard Berger late on, one race
after having been criticised for ending Alesi's Monaco Grand Prix
challenge.
Schumacher put aside the disappointment of missing out on what seemed
a routine third consecutive win to take part in the celebrations for
Alesi, who appeared destined never to win a grand prix. Alesi jumped on
to Schumacher's Benetton for his victory salute after his Ferrari was
surrounded by fans who ignored the danger of running across the track
with cars still finishing.
But his joy will be matched by Irvine and that of the
Silverstone-based Jordan team who jumped to fourth place in the
constructors' championship and ahead of former giant McLaren.
Irvine has had a short but chequered career in Formula One, but he
bettered his previous highest finish of fourth in the European Grand
Prix last year with his first podium finish.
Hill, who had been overtaken by both Alesi and Berger, had got back
into a comfortable third place when he ground to a halt to end a
disappointing weekend for the Williams team.
But the 34-year-old will be relieved that Schumacher's technical hitch
denied him what would have been a huge psychological advantage going
into the next race in France in three weeks' time.
Coulthard and Hill had both said the Williams was virtually
undriveable during a rain-lashed morning practice. Team boss Frank
Williams admitted: ''We clearly have a car problem, it's not the fault
of the drivers.''
Although the Gilles Villeneuve circuit had dried enough for the
drivers to use their slick tyres, Coulthard hit a wet patch as his car
spun before stalling in a gravel trap.
It completed a hat trick of disappointments for the Scottish drier,
who failed to finish the previous two races because of technical
problems, though he still lies sixth in the championship. Details:
1, J Alesi (France) Ferrari 1hr 46min 31.333sec (av speed 172.172

LEE Janzen birdied the last before beating fellow American Corey Pavin
in a play-off to win the $1.4m Kemper Open in Washington DC yesterday.
Janzen signed for a four-under-par 67 and then watched Pavin make a
fine par save at the final hole to force a play-off after a 68.
The pair finished at 12-under 272, one stroke ahead of fellow American
Robin Freeman, who bogeyed the final two holes.
In the play-off, Pavin made a bogey at the first extra hole, leaving
Janzen the luxury of two putts for victory, but he duly made the birdie
putt to clinch his second victory of the year.
Janzen, the 1993 US Open champion, established himself as one of the
favourites for this week's US Open at Shinnecock Hills on New York's
Long Island. However, there are no guarantees, as he discovered last
year when he also won the week before the US Open, only to miss the cut
at Oakmont.
''I felt good about my game coming in here,'' said Janzen, who
receives $252,000 for his sixth US Tour victory. ''From Friday to Sunday
I hit the ball great and made just one bogey. I had a ton of birdie
chances.''
Janzen, 30, never led until his final-hole birdie, but he was the most
precise when it mattered.
Several of his rivals faltered under the pressure, including
third-round leader Davis Love III, who bogeyed the seventeenth and
double-bogeyed the last to finish three strokes back, along with a group
including Greg Norman.
The two-time Open champion also came to grief with a double-bogey at
the seventeenth after earlier making one of his patented charges.
Norman started the day five shots back, but reduced the margin to just
one stroke after an eagle at the thirteenth, where he rifled a No.3 iron
to seven feet.
Even though Norman, seeking his second successive victory, later
drowned his chances in the water at the second last, he was optimistic
about his chances at the US Open. ''I've no regrets. I'm ready for next
week,'' he said. Scores (US unless stated):
272 -- L Janzen 68, 69, 63, 68; C Pavin 73, 68, 63, 68 (Janzen won at
first extra hole).
273 -- R Freeman 70, 69, 66, 68.
275 -- J Leonard 71, 67, 70, 67; V Singh (Fiji) 65, 71, 71, 68; G
Norman (Australia) 72, 66, 69, 68; M O'Meara 66, 70, 69, 70; D Love III
68, 63, 71, 73.
276 -- K Perry 72, 68, 69, 67; N Price (Zimbabwe) 70, 68, 70, 68; L
Mize 67, 70, 70, 69; J Mahaffey 72, 69, 65, 70; P Stewart 69, 69, 65,

Other scores included:

286 -- M Jimenez (Spain) 68, 74, 72, 72.

JUVENTUS, who have won the Italian league title, yesterday completed a
domestic double when they beat Parma 2-0 in the second leg of the cup
final, making it 3-0 on aggregate.
Sergio Porrini opened the scoring after 26 minutes, and nine minutes
after the restart, striker Fabrizio Ravanelli sprinted clear of the
Parma defence before curling a shot past keeper Luca Bucci.
It is only the fourth time a club has completed the Italian double,
Juventus also doing it in 1960, while Torino (1943), and Napoli (1987)
are the only others to achieve the feat.
Earlier in the weekend Padova defeated Genoa 5-4 in a penalty shootout
to remain in Serie A. The play-off match ended 1-1.
Meanwhile, Atalanta relegated

and final promotion spot to Italy's

DARING Destiny, the Fife-bred filly who won last year's Ladbroke Ayr
Gold Cup, has been at the centre of an owners' dispute which resulted in
the four-year-old being sold at auction for #87,000.
She is now back with her trainer, Karl Burke, at Wantage and will run
in a six-furlong sprint handicap at York on Friday in preparation for
defending her title in September.
Daring Destiny, an 18-1 outsider, beat Alizianah by a neck in a
photo-finish to Europe's richest sprint handicap. She was owned in
partnership by her breeder Ann Wright, the trainer, and Keswick hotelier
James Maloney who is reputed to have won more than #100,000 in bets on
the race.
As a result of a dispute between Maloney and Burke, the partnership
was dissolved and the filly was sent to the first available bloodstock
sales at Reading.
At the auction earlier this month, Burke outbid Maloney to keep Daring
Destiny in his yard.
Yesterday, Wright of Edencroft, Guardbridge near Leuchars, expressed
delight that the dispute had been settled and that she still retained
her majority 51% share in the filly.
Daring Destiny, bred from Raunchy Rita, daughter of Brigadier Gerard
who won the 1971 2000 Guineas, was successful in a seven-furlong race at
Epsom before her Gold Cup triumph. She has won more than #85,000 in
prize money.
Earlier this season she won a Listed race at Lingfield over seven
furlongs. Although she will inevitably be given a heavy weight by the
handicapper, Wright is keen Daring Destiny should have another crack at
the Ayr Gold Cup this autumn.
''As she is now running in mainly Listed races, it will most probably
be her only opportunity to race in Scotland this season. I believe
strongly she should come back and defend her title,'' Wright said.
Raunch Rita, rescued from a horse dealer's field in Dundee for #2000,
has produced two half sisters to Daring Destiny and is in foal again.

CORINNE Barbe celebrated her first classic success when Carling stayed
on strongly to outpoint Matiara in the Prix de Diane Hermes, the French
Oaks, at Chantilly yesterday afternoon.
Carling's neck win reversed the French 1000 Guineas form when Matiara
narrowly came out on top.
Connections are now looking to the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe later in
the season.
Madame Barbe said: ''This is fantastic. Carling is a very brave filly
and the Arc is certainly a possibility.''
Muncie, the 11-10 favourite, had the services of a pacemaker but could
only finish fifth.
Richard Hannon's Caramba, the only British runner, was bumped round
the home turn by Garden Rose but finished well in seventh, beaten a
little over two lengths.
She may now head for the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket next month.
Earlier, Derby hero Walter Swinburn had finished second on Fraam in
the Group 3 Prix du Chemin de Fer behind Kaldounevees.
The winner, trained by John Hammond, is to be aimed at the Arlington
Million.

STORNOWAY teacher Alastair Dunlop was the star of the Scottish
Athletic Federation National Veterans' Championships at Queen's Park
Stadium, Inverness, with a record-breaking run in the 800 metres.
Dunlop, who became the first Scottish veteran to better two minutes

record by 0.4sec with his winning run of 1min 58.7sec. His versatility
was shown when he won the triple jump with 10.98m.
Anglo-Scot Alasdair Ross (Reading) was a double sprints winner, taking

time of 12.1.
The women's championships were dominated by two athletes. Strathclyde
policewoman Claire Cameron (City of Glasgow) had field victories in the

Crownpoint
TWO victories by Mark Davidson, and a hectic day's work by
international decathlete Duncan Mathieson, helped Aberdeen to victory in
yesterday's Division 1 match at Crownpoint. The pair's efforts
contributed a huge points tally, hoisting their club to the narrowest of
leads at the top of the table with one match of the Scottish Athletics
League remaining.
The title is still wide open with the final match to come at
Meadowbank on August 6. Both Aberdeen and Pitreavie are on 21 points and
Shettleston third on 20. While Falkirk look doomed to relegation, the
second spot in Division 2 is still available to Edinburgh's two
struggling clubs, Southern and EAC, plus Inverness.
Davidson held off Pitreavie's Derek Paisley in the 400 metres hurdles,
won the 200m, and then contained the challenge of Pitreavie's world
junior medallist, Ian Mackie, as he anchored his club to victory in the
relay.
Mathieson, whose decathlon training programnme was spiked by a virus
over the winter, showed that these problems are behind him with second
place in the long jump (7.05m), pole vault (3.80m), and 110m hurdles
(16.2sec). He also took fourth in the 100m behind Mackie, with 11.5.
Dave Barnetson kept Inverness in touch with wins in the high jump
(2.13m) and sprint hurdles (15.4), but may abandon both events next year
in favour of the 400m hurdles.
A throws double by Steph Hayward, in shot and discus, helped Scottish
Borders consolidate their position, while Grant Purvis obliged with a
400m victory (48.9), holding off Commonwealth 1500m finalist Gary Brown.
Falkirk's Brown, however, had already won the 800 with 1min 52.6sec.
Clydesdale, competing in the Division 2 match at the same venue, won
and now look certain of promotion, but Cambuslang and East Kilbride face
a cut-throat struggle. Kilbarchan, despite a 800/1500m double by Robert
Fitzsimmons, look the relegation favourites.
Perth Strathtay had an outstanding performer in 15-year-old Richard
McDonald, whose 400m win in 49.8 was the first time the 15-year-old had
broken 50 seconds. Ian Horsburgh's national under-17 record of 49.35 is
now vulnerable. Division 1 (bold names) and 2 winners:
100m: I Mackie (Babcock Pitreavie) 11.00secs; S Shanks (E Kilbride)

EDINBURGH Woollen Mill, the reigning champions, drew level with City
of Glasgow at the top of the Bank of Scotland Scottish Women's League,
Division 1, yesterday when they won the second-round match in Inverness,
writes Sandy Sutherland.
Wendy Steele landed a close 400 metres in 58.2 secs, with Aberdeen's
Susan Hendry timed at 58.5, and Lorna Jackson also had a useful win in
the javelin with a throw of 50.0m.
Dundee Hawkhill's Lorna Silver just missed out on a hurdles double
when she won the one-lap event in 61.5, but she was edged out in the
100m hurdles by Glasgow's Claire Mackintosh, who won in 14.1, with
Silver crossing the line in 14.3, and Aberdeen's Gail Walker timed at
14.6.
Two first-year seniors -- Natalie Hynd (Pitreavie) and Gillian Hegney
(CoG) crossed the line together in the 100m and, with the wind at their
backs, both clocked 12.0, but Hynd was given the verdict.
There was an under-17 league record for Pitreavie's Catherine Garden
in the discus (39.78m).
EWM and Glasgow now have 11 league points, though Glasgow are slightly
ahead on individual points which means the title will be decided in the
third and final round. Details:

* ALASTAIR Gunn (Halkirk) displayed the form which gained him the
British title when defeating his Scottish rivals, together with athletes
from Australia, England, and America, to win the World Highland Games
Professional Heavy Events title at Kilmarnock.
Winning the Scots hammer with a throw of 134ft 11ins, Gunn had a
struggle throughout a closely contested match with Francis Brebner,
winner of the weight for distance (92 ft 5 ins), but triumphed as he had
the better overall placings despite both throwers scoring the same final
points total. Overall results:
1, A Gunn (Halkirk) 38; 2, F Brebner (Peterhead) 38; 3, G Patience

THE anticipated cracker between West of Scotland and visitors
Stenhousemuir, who have made it to the final of the Abbot Ale Cup,
turned out a damp squib.
Batting first, Stenhousemuir received a big setback when Michael
Richardson pinned Iain Philip leg before with the ninth delivery.
Craig Wright then put himself on a hat trick to reduce Stenhousemuir
to 21 for two. Top batsman Peter Moses and John Bell improved the
visitors' chances with a fifth-wicket partnership of 68 -- only for both
to be out with the score on 97.
Eventually the East League side crept up to 149 for nine from their 50
overs.
West then raced to a nine-wickets victory in 28.1 overs, harvesting
boundaries on the fast outfield.
Mark Harper had 10 of them in his 59 while Alistair Storie and
Jonathan Williams each hammered six.
Freuchie had to work hard before defeating Dumfries with just seven
balls to spare.
The opening partnership of Trevor Williams and Ralph Laing put 98 on
the board for the South of Scotland side before the latter went for 28.
Dumfries eventually set a target of 169 and Freuchie seemed in serious
trouble at 60 for five.
However, Scott Gourlay and Willie Grieve (25) then grafted a
sixth-wicket partnership of 44.
Freuchie saw more wickets go down but a gritty unbeaten stand between
Gourlay and Colin Hepplewhite took the Fifers home.
The two other matches in Section 1 also produced tight finishes.
Poloc's professional Sajid Ali contributed little with the bat, a GHK
victim to the second ball of the second over, and Poloc totalled only
137 for seven.
However, he paid his way with the ball, producing a wicket maiden to
leave GHK looking at 28 needed with only two over left. GHK's
ninth-wicket partnership of Richard Young and Jim Forrest fell four runs
short.
Chasing Forfarshire's 135, Ferguslie were in deep trouble at 93 for
eight in the thirty-third over when Michael McCahill joined veteran
Sandy Strang. However, this pair saw the Paisley side to victory with
one over to spare.
A lot of wickets fell in Dundee, where Drumpellier maintained their
unbeaten record against the local High School FPs.
The visitors were in early trouble at 25 for five, with Steve King
having taken three scalps and Jimmy Bennett two.
The turning point was the sixth-wicket partnership of 64 from top
scorers Steven Allison (38) and Pete Campbell (34), which helped
Drumpellier to 141 all out.
Initially, Dundee's reply consisted of not losing wickets -- the first
went down in the ninth over when only three runs had been totalled.
Once Stevie Carr and Anjum Aslam came on, wickets began to fall.
Dundee were all out for 61 in the thirty-fifth over, with only Graham
McLaren (18) in double figures.

JACKIE Tindall, from Buckhaven High School in Fife, proved the
exceptional athlete of the Scottish Schools Pentathlon Championships at
Grangemouth, writes Doug Gillon.
Not only did she retain the 15-17 age group title in Saturday's TSB
event, but her long jump, shot, and high jump performances outstripped
those of the over-17 winner, Kirsty Roger.
Tindall, the national age group and schools' hurdles champion, amassed
3153 points, the highest total in a decade. She was closely pursued by
Gillian Stewart (3071).
Gerard Murray, the senior boys' champion, from St Patrick's,
Coatbridge, also found himself upstaged in three events by the winner of
the 15-17 title, Richard Singer of Mackie Academy, while Craig Loney
denied Chris Baillie the under-15 crown. Details:

THE FIRST TEST
NORMAL service has been resumed at Headingley. The West Indies are
winning again -- and England still look like a team with more problems
than answers.
Chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth spoke of a ''very fine margin''
between success and failure after his team's nine-wicket defeat in the
opening Cornhill Test.
And he insisted that ''not a great deal of improvement'' would be
needed for England to start turning the tables at Lord's on Thursday
week.
If it proves to be as simple as that, all well and good. But, on the
evidence of four days' play in Leeds, neutrals might disagree with
Illingworth -- and argue strongly about his ''fine line'' verdict.
But for uncharacteristically dropping a handful of catches, West
Indies would have won even more convincingly.
With captain Mike Atherton an obvious exception, England's top-order
batsmen handed too many wickets away through poor shot selection.
Illingworth and his fellow selectors seem unlikely to make major
changes, but they will have to consider that a mistake was made in
recalling Robin Smith and playing him out of position as an opener.
He totalled only 22 and fell to shots outside off stump in a manner
that must leave such as Geoff Boycott weeping.
That England need five bowlers was all too obvious at Headingley.
Atherton would have been in an almighty mess with only four once Devon
Malcolm was mauled and Darren Gough handicapped by a back strain.
Alec Stewart's dual role in the side must also be reviewed, although
at least the theory is sound in his case. It just requires him to
reproduce his opening form lower down the order, because his
wicketkeeping is perfectly acceptable.
For West Indies, the picture suddenly looks rosy again. They promised
to whip up a ''blacklash'' after their home series defeat by Australia
-- and duly delivered.
Courtney Walsh proved as reliable as ever, Curtly Ambrose shook off
early tour cobwebs to look more like his menacing old self, and their
batsmen did enough to complete England's misery.
But the biggest bonus of all for captain Richie Richardson is the
return of another high-quality fast bowler in Ian Bishop.
By taking five England first-innings wickets in the space of 18 balls,
Bishop did more than enough to earn the man-of-the-match award and give
himself a glorious comeback present after two years out of Test cricket
with a spinal injury.
It was Walsh, however, who made sure that this match would not need a
fifth day when he removed Mark Ramprakash yesterday morning.
England had been looking for a major stand between Ramprakash and
Graham Thorpe when they resumed on 109 for four, only 26 ahead.
Just 11 runs were added before Walsh produced a magnificent delivery
to clip the outside edge of Ramprakash's off stump.
Phillip DeFreitas skied the same bowler to mid-on three balls later,
and when Walsh ended Thorpe's battling innings of 61 through a catch to
backward point, it was only a matter of time before the inevitable
conclusion.
Gough and Peter Martin, who had a solid first Test, prolonged
England's innings by adding 41. But after Ambrose ended the show on 208
by bowling Malcolm -- and capturing his 100th English wicket in only 19
matches -- West Indies made a mockery of their 126-run victory target.
Sherwin Campbell snicked Martin to third slip -- and paved the way for
Carl Hooper and Brian Lara to add 118 in just 16 overs.
Hooper blazed nine 4s and four 6s, Lara stroked eight boundaries --
and the so-called ''fine dividing line'' was crossed with nearly eight
hours to spare.

TWO of yesterday's AXA Equity &amp; Law Sunday League matches ended in
ties on a day of exciting finishes.
Jonathan Lewis was run out attempting a second run that would have
given Essex victory over Durham at Chelmsford, while Derbyshire tied
with Northants at Derby following a dramatic last over from former
England seamer Paul Taylor.
Chasing a target of 117, Essex reached the final over needing nine to
win. Seven came off Manoj Prabhakar's first five balls before Lewis was
run out by Alan Walker's throw from third man attempting a second run
off the last ball.
Derby needed 14 to win when Taylor began his over. Paul Aldred hit a 4
off the second ball, two runs followed off the next two deliveries, and
Aldred hit a 6 over mid-wicket.
But, needing two off the last ball, Aldred and Andy Harris could only
scamper a bye to level the scores.
At Old Trafford, Glamorgan inflicted Lancashire's first defeat of the
season in any competition. They sealed a nine-run win with the first
ball of the last over to become the new leaders after Worcestershire's
defeat at Nottinghamshire.

DOUGLAS Walker struck another blow for the Scottish sprint revival
yesterday when he won the 200 metres for the UK student team competing
against the AAA, Loughborough Students, and a Great Britain Under-20
team at Loughborough.
The Heriot-Watt student, already in line for World Student Games
selection, clocked 21.16sec ahead of the AAA's Julian Golding, and his
only disappointment was the call-off of reinstated doping offender
Solomon Wariso.
The highlights of the meeting were two UK records, but Scots performed
with distinction elsewhere.
Jon Edwards broke the 13-year-old triple jump record in his first
competition of the season, leaping 17.58 metres to eclipse the mark set
by Keith Connor in 1982.And Rotherham's Linda Stanton -- just 5ft 3in
tall -- cleared 3.72m in the pole vault.
Gary Staines won the AAA 10,000m title in 28-49.31, but the windy
conditions denied him the World Championship qualifying time. Chris
Robison (IBM Spango Valley) was third in 29-03, and Robert Quinn
(Kilbarchan) moved to twentieth on the Scottish all-time rankings when
finishing sixth in 29-14.
Graeme Croll (Cambuslang) recorded his best steeplechase of the
season, finishing fourth in 8-51.30, and Des Roache, 19, from
Clydesdale, enhanced claims to a European junior team place, with a
lifetime 1500m best of 3-44.98.
Clubmate Grant Graham won the British Milers' Club 1500m championship
in 3-44.06, and 17-year-old Ally Donaldson improved his 800m personal
best to 1-50.60 when finishing fifth in the senior race. Third was
another Scot, Kheridine Idessane (Clydesdale) 1-49.90, with Richard
Girvan (Kilbarchan) clocking 1-49.95. Other Scottish performances:
Bruce Robb -- shot 14.24, discus 46.38; Euan Calvert -- 800m 1-49.06;
Jamie Quarry 110m H 14.67; Ross Baillie 110m H 14.99; Sinead Dudgeon,
200m 24.51; Lorraine Bell, 400m 56.65; Alison Curbishley, 400m hurdles
61.54.
FOR the first time, veterans won both the male and female titles in a
Scottish national championship when Brian Kirkwood (Leslie Deans RC) and
Eleanor Robinson (Border) won the men's and women's Dumfries Half
Marathon. Results:
1, B Kirkwood (LDRC) 67-38; 2, A Robertson (Cambuslang) 67-58; 3, T
Anderson (Kilbarchan) 71-15. Veteran: D Gemmell (Clydesdale) 74-28.
Women: 1, E Robinson (Border) 83-52; 2, J Thompson (City of Glasgow)
84-31; 3, C McFadden (EWM) 85-08.
Monklands 7-mile road race. 1, C Thomson 33-36; 2, M Hagan (both

EAST LEAGUE:
THERE are a lot of people at Carlton perplexed by the omission of Bryn
Lockie from the Scottish line-up to tackle the West Indies on Thursday.
The sturdy opener has racked up centuries at both Area and B level and
is in prolific form this season.
By way of poking the selectors in the eye with a stick, he compiled
another hundred at Grange Loan on Saturday as Stenhousemuir were sent
packing.
Carlton's victory established them as principal challengers to Ryden
East League leaders Heriot's, which makes it all the sadder that rain
washed out their clash a week ago.
Not that the Herioteers have any intention of surrendering their title
lightly as they signalled clearly with an excellent win over Grange at
Raeburn Place.
Lockie's partnership with Scott Baker enabled Carlton to set a target
of 214, which proved too rich for Stenhousemuir.
They were dismissed for 154, Richard Bannerman grabbing four wickets
and Alan McLeod three.
Edinburgh Academicals set Watsonians an even more demanding task as
Peter Flockhart (50), Craig Symons (44), and Dave Loudon, whose 43
required only 24 balls, hoisted a total of 230.
Steve Lockhart and Kenny Scott carved out an opening stand of 130 in
reply and the visitors were on their way.
The lack of a cutting edge in the Accies attack was exposed and West
Indian John Pollard hit 59 before succumbing to a catch on the boundary
from a hit which, if it had cleared the fielder, would have won the
match.
He had earlier claimed four wickets and deserved to score the winning
runs, rather than leave it to the next man in.
Another professional to earn his corn was Heriot's Shahid Aslam, who
bowled 26 economical overs as Grange were restricted to 177-6. Gordon
McGurk contributed 66.
But it was a late flurry by Nick Peet and Simon Hodgson which ensured
that Heriot's would be stretched to collect the points.
Now it was time for Shahid to demonstate his mettle with the bat and
it was his unflustered half-century which cemented the whole innings
together, enabling the leaders to make the winning post with an over and
a bit to spare.
There was no doubt who took the division's main bowling honours.
Corstorphine's Shahid Saeed had taken an unbeaten ton off the Falkland
attack, which was to prove a might superfluous as Manzoor Butt proceeded
to destroy the response by blasting out eight at a cost of a mere 12
runs as the home side wilted away for a wretched 43.
Indeed, it was a bleak day for central Fife as Freuchie were blown
away by Royal High for whom skipper Abdul Rehman had 76.

WESTERN UNION:
CLYDESDALE have got the winning habit, and that, coupled with the
failures of their closest challengers, helped the Titwood side to
increase their advantage in the D M Hall Western Union.
On Saturday, Ferguslie tried to upset the Clydesdale bandwagon. But,
like others before them this season, the Paisley side found themselves
being run over.
Greig Williamson (47) and Aamir Hanif (40) pushed 'Dale to 190-7 off
50 overs, and a game looked on as Ferguslie answered with an opening
stand of 36.
However, Justin Gayfer departed on that total, the first of three
wickets to fall for just one run. From then, Ferguslie fought a
rearguard action, which almost earned some reward. Despite Hanif's 5-22,
it was not until the ninety-seventh over that Clydesdale ended the
resistance, Williamson removing last man Gary McLaughlan.
Last week, Poloc slipped in the table. On Saturday, they slipped up
for the first time, pushed on their way to defeat at Cambusdoon by Ayr
pro Adrian Holdstock. Keith Sheridan and Ian Holten shared the bulk of
the Ayr wickets as the champions were limited to 135, Craig Hunter
making 34, Holdstock 21.
It was, though, a different story when Holdstock was presented with
the shiny cherry, the South African pro tipping the balance firmly in
Ayr's favour when he had Sajid Ali captured at second slip by Albert
Simpson.
Poloc were 31 for 4 when Holten came to the wicket. He hung around for
a defiant 34 while Holdstuck set about the rest of the visiting line-up.
However, Holten was eighth out on 87, the tail cleaned up for just
another two runs as Holdstock finished the day with figures of
15.1-5-26-7.
Seven was also Steve Carr's lucky number at Whitehaugh as Drumpellier
inflicted Kelburne's first defeat of the season. Drumps totalled 210-6,
Saleem Sajjad clubbing his way to an excellent ton which included seven
boundries and four 6s.
What had appeared a perfect wicket for the visitors suddenly contained
nothing but demons for the hosts. Opener Deon Kotze was third out having
made 36, but no-one else chipped in as Carr whittled his way through the
Kelburne batting. In 10.2 overs, Carr picked up match-winning returns of
7-25.
While others made telling contributions with either bat or ball, West
of Scotland's Mark Townson produced the complete all-round display to
beat Uddingston.
West were toiling at 103-7 when Townson strode to the wicket. By the
time their 50 overs were up, West had progressed to 159-7, Townson
unbeaten on 50. When required to bowl, Townson spun off 10 overs, six of
them maidens, ending with five wickets for as many runs as Uddingston
collapsed to 93 all out.
The most exciting conclusion came at Glenpark, the outcome between
Greenock and Kilmarnock a draw. From 28-4, Killie mustered 165 with the
Malik's, Muzamil and Nazim hitting 57 and 39 respectively.
Greenock, with handy knocks from Peter Duthie and Tom Black and with
wickets in hand, always looked favourites, and from the last over, they
needed just six to win.
Imran Adress though bowled four dot balls with Barry McLean facing.
The penultimate delivery was clipped for a single, leaving David Duthie
with the simple task of hitting a 6 for victory.
He missed, Adress hit to finish with 6-55 and give Killie the better
of the draw.

SCOTTISH COUNTIES
ALAN Sievewright is one of those chaps with an old head on young
shoulders. The Stirling County 17-year-old, who has just left Dunblane
High School and is going to Edinburgh University next year, began
playing cricket at eight years of age and hopes to see all his work
culminate in a trip to Holland with the Scotland Under-19s.
''I need to make some scores to be on that tour,'' he said after
having been unbeaten on 57 at Williamfield on Saturday as Stirling
defeated champions Strathmore by five wickets.
It was not a slam-bam innings. Only four 4s. Graham Buick at the other
end with ten 4s in his 58 took care of that role on a wicket not
renowned for being kind to batsmen.
It was a strange sort of game. Strathie went in first, had Grant
Lawrence caught by the said Sievewright off the bowling of Bruce Russell
for only five with the score at 16, and then a 121 partnership between
Nigle Hazle and Mark Mudie seemed to set up a victory situation.
George McGuire altered that by taking the wickets of Hazel, on 62, and
Mudie, with 67, even following up with Billy Duthie being caught by --
you know his name, Sievewright -- for six.
Russell then stepped in. He finished with figures of five for 45, but
in his final two overs his record was actually four for three as the
Strathie side collapsed from 137-2 to 162-8.
The normal gamble of Strathmore skipper Mark Kelaher not to go for the
54 overs -- ''Why give the opposition three extra points?'' -- backfired
for once. It looked good initially with Stirling reduced to 40-3 -- Jon
Taylor out for a dubious caught behind, Ker Henderson comprehensively
bowled, and Kyle Wealleans being caught off the bowling of Andy
Monteith.
But Buick, backed up by Sievewright, took Stirling through to 163-5,
and a victory which leaves Ayrshire on their own at the top.
They were a few miles up the road at Clackmannan, and despite 5-55
from Simon Feaver, they managed a total of 206, David Harper hitting 52
of them. Malcolm Howell did his best for Clacks with 42, but the bowling
of Drew Parsons was just too much.
The batting honours of Arbroath County sum up their victory over
Fifeshire, while Perthshire and Forfarshire had a right old battle at
the North Inch, which ended in a draw. There were eight lbw decisions,
and Forfar were deducted three points for slow bowling. Tough life,
isn't it.

* JASON Gallian and John Crawley will have a chance to impress the
England selectors when Lancashire resume their Britannic Assurance
Championship match against Glamorgan at Old Trafford today.
Gallian (64no) and Crawley (49no) will continue their unbroken stand
of 75 which helped the home side establish a lead of 82 at the close on
Saturday.
Lancashire reached 140 after Glamorgan, 338 for two overnight, were
bowled out for 475 soon after lunch.
Tony Cottey and Matthew Maynard took their record third-wicket
partnership to 237 before Ian Austin had Maynard caught at slip by John
Crawley for 138. Cottey (124) was caught behind off Wasim Akram in the
next over.

'Volleyball is meant for fun, it has a breezy and cheerful air about
it, as if everybody was enjoying themselves, which is what sport is all
about'
WELCOME to Perth and turn back. Stopping off at a local hotel we
discovered that it was closed. The next hotel was closed as well. It is
a well-known place called the Grampian Hotel. It wasn't just closed. The
two so-called workers in there were sitting in front of the telly
watching the rugby but they told me the place was closed.
I tried to walk out the other door. It was, of course, closed. So was
the gents' toilet, which was, in fact, my reason for entering this
tourists' delight.
Next door I found, well, relief, in the Waverley Hotel where a very
bright and cheery young lady called Joanna, who had trained at Edinburgh
Yooni, first showed me the toilet and then gave me a nice wee whisky,
asking me first if I wanted ice or not.
It takes an Edinburgh lassie to make Perth sensible.
But Perth has hidden depths to its notion of hospitality. I found
myself at the Gannochy Sports Centre in North Inch, which is in Perth.
Just down the road is a wee lane which no automobile could go down.
Neither can any other vehicle because there a big sign stating that
cycling is ''prohibited''.
In Perth they are awfy fond of the word ''prohibited''. In the
Gannochy Sports Centre smoking is ''prohibited''. Other notices insist
that ''Unauthorised persons are prohibited beyond this point''.
Another, this time handwritten, notice says baldly: ''Do not enter:
wait for assistant''. For Christ's sake why?
It was bloody volleyball and there were all these people in silly
shorts and sweaters with mobile telephones and a level of security which
comes out of a Len Deighton novel.
It's crazy. Increasingly, the rather low-profile sports which I
encounter on your behalf have these absolute jube-jubes in semi-military
uniforms telling me that I don't have security clearance or some other
such drivel. Perth is bad enough as it is without having such mince from
sports centre folk.
But we were here for sport and sport there was. The Scottish Open
Volleyball Tournament has been running for 10 years and celebrates more
than a decade, a centenary, for vollyball started itself up a century
ago: this is its 100th year.
Tournament director David Munro, a headmaster what else, spoke warmly
of the number of participants who turned out for this event. There were
a lot of English teams of course, including the awesome Birmingham side
Sikh Temple.
I spoke to Vic and Paresh and they told me they had covered the two
days and enjoyed themselves but not as much as they intend to do for the
next week because the club is going to do a wee tour of Scotland. I know
this sounds ridiculous but I ended up telling Paresh where the best
Asian restaurant in Glasgow is. Well, he wanted to know.
There was the Russian team, from Pskov, a twinned city with Perth.
Pskov is near St Petersburg.
I spoke with manager Lubov Maslennikova. Her team had turned up with
only six players because one of her stars couldn't get a visa and the
coach had to sub instead. Pskov in one of the top teams in the new
Russia.
A nice lady Lubov but I still couldn't resist, old Stalinist as I am,
referring to St Petersburg as Leningrad, which is, of course, what it
was.
But the Scottish teams dominated the tourney. City of Glasgow Su
Ragazzi were but narrowly beaten by Ashcombe Guildford in the women's
final by two-nil, (a very close run match by 17-16 and then 15-12), but
Glasgow's girls were well up front and unlucky to lose.
The men's final saw Su Ragazzi once again versus Kilmarnock. The Scots
are doing well in this largely European sport. But it is creeping into
Scotland in a low but important way.
Alice and Rhona of Kinross, both aged 11, are keen players and I will
tell you why. Volleyball is an ideal indoor sport, (though it is also
very much outdoor and in fact there were over 50 teams competing outside
in the rather inadequate courts of the Gannochy Sports Complex at the
weekend), and it is more than ideal for boys and girls, and more
especially, mixed teams which is, I believe, the real future of the
sport.
There were 167 teams competing at the weekend. Don't forget the
boyfriends, and girlfriends, and husbands, and wives, and mums, and
dads. A lot of money coming into Perth if it thought of the toursist and
visitor industry. Go and see Joanne in the Waverley Hotel -- you might
get a drink and a welcome there but there isnae much else in Perth.
However, back to wur subject.
Volleyball is essentially a leisure sport and unlikely to become truly
professional, thank God, though there are European and Scandinavian
leagues which can provide a sort of a living for the odd player.
At the end of the day, volleyball is meant for fun, on beaches and the
like. The result is that it has a breezy and cheerful air about it, as
if everybody was enjoying themselves, which is what sport is all about.
Here's another thing to add: you can play it when you are quite old.
Like me and, dare I say it, David Munro.
A heedie in beachshorts. Grand.

WE had the enthusiasm and desire to see it through, but at the end of
the day we simply lacked the stamina and strength.
We are not talking about the Scottish rugby team's performance but the
Sporting Diary's efforts to keep up with the full weekend of TV sport.
We strove manfully on sofa and in pub to keep up with the punishing
schedule of four rugby games in two days, plus various soccer matches,
England losing at cricket, and our horse losing the Derby.
But by Sunday afternoon, towards the end of the Scotland-New Zealand
match, we had to admit defeat and wandered out into the sunshine.
In something of a daze, not dissimilar to that experienced by Craig
Chalmers after being pounded by sundry All Blacks, we had to admit
feelings of admiration both for the English team and the quality of the
crack from the commentators and pundits on the ITV coverage of the Rugby
World Cup. Two of our favourite prejudices gone in one fell swoop.
Of course, the English and their fellow-travelling commentators are
still remarkably arrogant. Presenter Alastair Hignell spoke of it being
''unthinkable'' for England to lose to Australia, while Scotland were on
a ''mission impossible'' against New Zealand.
Steve Smith is a shameless English fan with a microphone, but makes up
for it with some gems. During the England-Australia match he described
Dewi Morris's close attentions to the Australian scrum half as ''living
in Gregan's jockstrap.'' Quite an image to cope with given that this
match started at noon and some of us were still at breakfast.
When England's Dean Richards courageously came back on after having
six stitches put in his forehead, Smith opined that this was a mere
bagatelle to the player. ''He wouldn't have bothered if they put a zip
in it,'' said Smith.
* THERE is one aspect of the Rugby World Cup where the Scots have been
clear winners -- the national anthems. The sound of the pipes has been
inspiring and the lads have been giving the words laldy.
The competition organisers were so impressed by Flower of Scotland
that they tacked a chunk of it on to the beginning of the Western Samoan
anthem. This made the Samoan song even longer, more like an operetta
than an anthem.
The South Africans, being the host nation, have given themselves two
national anthems. One vaguely black African in style and the second a
straightforward strident piece of Boer nationalism.
* CHESTER Williams, the only black player in the South African side,
chose not to sing either. He still looks vaguely uncomfortable among his
white team-mates. It appeared uncomfortable, too, for the commentators
and pundits referring to the fact that it was the token black who won
the game for his rugby-crazy white countrymen.
Williams is variously referred to as ''non-white'' or ''coloured.''
The men with the mikes were on safer ground when they resorted to cliche
and superlatives -- Williams is ''the black pearl'' and ''the jewel in
the crown of South African rugby.''
* OUR own man at the mike, Broon frae Troon, promised that Scotland
would ''go down gloriously.'' In the event we did and we didn't.
Even Broon himself was subdued during the game. What Scottish fan
could fail to be subdued after watching Jonah Lomu shrug off our best
players on his way to the line.
''What can we do to stop this man?'' asked commentator Chris Rea as
Lomu brushed off the fourth Scottish tackle to set up the first All
Black try. ''Shoot him!'' came the cry from the back of the pub.
But you must excuse us. The England-Brazil round ball game is on down
in the pub as we write this. We're off to see if we can work up some
admiration for the English soccer team.
* PS -- The team sheet put out by the Press Association for the
England-Brazil game listed Paul Gascoigne as a Tottenham player. Perhaps
Walter Smith should be told.
* PPS -- The St Andrew's Sporting Club had Bill McMurdo, the football
agent and famous bluenose, as guest of honour at last week's dinner. The
main course was fillets of salmon in an orange sauce. At least the
broccoli was green.

'The difference between the Brazil game and the British version was
exposed when a young footballer was sent out to break his own world
throw-in record. In Rio, a young player would probably have been
produced to break a world record in ball juggling'
TERRY Venables sent another experimental team out to play at Wembley
yesterday aware that for the first time in his reign as England manager
his methods were being doubted. A narrow and extremely fortuitous win
against Japan, a last-gasp and undeserved draw with Sweden, and
yesterday they were face to face with the masters.
Brazil had beaten the Japanese and Swedes with a healthy degree of
elan which suggested they are reconstructing a team which, when fully
developed, will be capable of wondrous things.
Under a slate grey sky they won the Umbro Cup and #500,000 by beating
England 3-1, yet they played only in the second half. It was then their
players, a goal behind, decided to impress a little white-haired man who
must soon decide on his best side for the South American championship,
the Copa America.
Mario Zagalo will not find it easy to single out his best 11, however.
Despite their reluctance to play for the full 90 minutes the Brazilians
present him with an embarrassment of riches.
Stung into action by a splendid Graeme Le Saux goal scored in 38
minutes, the Brazilians displayed more of the skills and the ingenuity
which excite people wherever they go. But if this young side are to
mature into the fluent machine which Zagalo seeks they will have to
refrain from moments of bad temper such as were displayed on occasion
yesterday.
Edmundo was the worst offender and he was rightly booked in the first
half when he flicked a foot in the direction of Tim Flowers' head as the
England keeper smothered an attempt at goal. However, the Palmeiras
striker produced the predatory genius which Zagalo expects and scored a
good goal in 74 minutes. It was, in fact, the goal which took the game
way beyond the reach of England who were unable to reproduce their
impressive form of the first half.
Brazil chose Zagalo to succeed Carlos Alberto Parreira, who led them
to World Cup glory in America last summer because he has the experience
required and, they hope, the guile to change the emphasis of the
national team's game.
Brazil are searching again for the beautiful game having been too
pragmatic in their approach in recent times. Their media and many fans
of a country consumed by a passion for football claim the national team
is too defensive. They also were unhappy with Zagalo's appointment
saying that as a Parreria confidante he would change little.
''I know what they say,'' Zagalo said. ''But we played well here in
this tournament, although I was not pleased with our work in the first
half today. But I think we can become an exciting team using the
traditional ways of Brazilian football.
''The dynamics of our game are different in that they don't remain the
same for 90 minutes. We have power when it is required. That on its own,
though, is not enough and we have to have patience also. Speed is not
everything.''
Zagalo is unique in that he has won four World Cups, twice as a player
(1958-62) and twice as a coach (1970-94) when he was assistant to
Parreira. The 63-year-old should be invited to come and lecture in the
failing premier division academy in which speed and strength are
everything.
While Zagalo was being interviewed Venables could do little more than
shake his head.
He said afterwards: ''For 60 minutes or so we did the job right. Their
equaliser gave them a lift and they got on top of their game. We had
been defending well, but then we got slack and let them get into space
behind us and got punished. We nearly got things right today and there
is a lot to build on.''
If only he and every other manager had the Brazilian's problems. If
only Venables or even Craig Brown were being criticised because their
world champions were playing within themselves.
That's the trouble when Brazil are in town, imaginations tend to run
wild. We see how the game should be played and we dream a little, but
while we do that Brazil turn dreams into reality.
Perhaps one of these days our own managers will awake and do the
proper things to take our football closer to that of the Brazilians. Ah
there I go again. Dreaming.
The former Coventry City manager, Bobby Gould, has certainly awoken to
the Brazilian ways. He claimed: ''English football won't move on
properly until the FA sends someone to Brazil to study for six months.''
If anyone is dispatched could he please take with them someone from
the SFA?
The difference in style and approach between the Brazilian game and
the British version was exposed when a young Notts County player, Andy
Legg, was asked to demonstrate his skills as part of the pre-match
entertainment. He was sent out to try to break his own world throw-in
record when, if this match had been played in Rio, a young footballer
would probably have been produced to break a world record in ball
juggling.
Nevertheless, Legg did exceptionally well with a throw of 41.9 metres
and was then collared for an interview. ''What else do they teach you at
Notts County, Andy?'' His reply was revealing to say the least. ''Not a
lot, we've just been relegated.''
In the presence of Brazil and the greatest of them all, Pele, who made
an appearance before kick-off to launch a charity appeal, England
eventually were relegated to bit-part players, but their problems were
engineered as much by themselves as the South Americans.
Venables' side were eager and determined and were able to punish some
of the Brazilian players who appeared sluggish and upset Zagalo
considerably. Several times he rushed from his seat to remonstrate with
his players from the touchline.
With David Batty operating in front of England's defensive line
Venables's side quickly took control of the game and they deserved to be
a goal in front by the interval. Stuart Pearce took a free kick after
Roberto Carlos had fouled Darren Anderton. Aldair headed clear, but only
as far as Le Saux who hit the ball perfectly from 22 yards beating the
keeper at his top, left-hand corner.
Eight minutes into the second half, Juninho, a slightly built
20-year-old who plays with Sao Paulo, took advantage when Batty conceded
a free kick 22 yards from his own goal. The Brazilian took only a
two-step approach and curled the ball into the right hand corner of
Flowers' net.
Suddenly the Brazilians were functioning with the flair and panache
which had been anticipated from the beginning, and one of the slickest
moves of the entire game gave them the lead in 60 minutes.
The scorer of the first goal passed the ball through the middle of
England's defence and Ronaldo side-stepped Flowers and scored. It was a
wonderful piece of skill by the 18-year-old who has been signed by PSV
Eindhoven. He was winning his eighth cap, and the Dutch side, in common
with Zagalo, believe he will be around the very top of world football
for many years to come.
He arrived here as the new star of Brazilian football having become at
17 the youngest player since Edu in 1966 to wear the famous yellow
jersey, but he has a rival in Roberto Carlos.
The left full back spends most of his time in opposition territory,
making darting runs and playing precise passes which leave defenders
baffled and his own team-mates with goal-scoring opportunities. Gould
has already advised Tottenham Hotspur manager Gerry Francis to sign him.
Roberto Carlos is a star in the making and played a part in the move
which led to Brazil's third goal scored in 76 minutes. The ball was
lofted forward in to England's half and when Pearce failed to clear
properly, Edmundo was off and running away from Gary Neville before
playing the ball between the legs of Flowers and into the net.
Venables decided to introduce Rangers-bound Paul Gascoigne with only
12 minutes remaining and the midfield player, who took over from Batty,
gave England back their desire. The first time he received the ball he
raced forward and beat three defenders on the edge of Brazil's box and,
before the end, he also played a couple of fine passes.
However, Gascoigne also displayed some bad temper, hurling the ball to
the ground and right in the dying seconds, slapping a corner flag when
the Brazilians held up play to make a substitution. One wonders what he
may do when he is fit enough to last 90 minutes.
England: Flowers (Blackburn), Neville (Man Utd), Scales (Liverpool),
Cooper (Nottm Forest), Pearce (Nottm Forest), Anderton (Tottenham),
Platt (Sampdoria), Batty (Blackburn), Le Saux (Blackburn), Shearer
(Blackburn), Sheringham (Tottenham). Subs: Gascoigne (Lazio), Redknapp

CRAIG Brown asserts that he is not into self-fulfilling prophesies
(Herald, June 6), then goes on to prove himself entirely right in adding
. . . ''but we know we cannot take chances.''
Two paltry goals against the ''emerging'' Faroe Islands may suggest
that, indeed, taking chances is not one of his side's strong points.

ON behalf of the Scottish Schools' Football Association, I would like
to pay tribute to the Herald and the Scottish Football Association for
their involvement in the Herald Soccer Sevens prior to the Scottish Cup
Final on Saturday.
We are most grateful to The Herald for their sponsorship of the
competition. Without this interest and generosity the status of the
event would be much reduced.
As far as the SFA are concerned, I have nothing but the highest praise
for Jim Farry and his colleagues at Park Gardens who have quite clearly
shown where their priorities lie by allowing my association to stage The
Herald Sevens final at Hampden as a curtain raiser to the main event.
My thanks to all concerned for giving 16 schoolboys a day their
teachers, families and not least the boys themselves will ever forget.

AS a member of the SCU and an avid follower of Scottish, and in
particular Western Union, cricket I am somewhat dismayed at The Herald's
apparent reluctance to make adequate mention of the sport in the west of
Scotland.
Friday's column, which discussed the match prospects for the following
day, seems to have disappeared completely and on Saturday a search of
your sports section uncovered a few paragraphs about east of Scotland
cricket, but no mention of the Western Union.
Your Western Union coverage has not been without its critics in the
past but to drop it altogether seems rather drastic. There are many
people in the west of Scotland who both play and follow the sport and a
''quality'' paper such as the Herald should bear this in mind.

WITH regard to the Burns/McCann debacle last week, I wondered whether,
in the light of Burns' ignominious climbdown, journalists of this paper
and others might not wish to withdraw the epithets of ''high principle''
and ''self- sacrifice'' they so hastily and in my view misguidedly
bestowed on Burns whilst the dog fight was raging.
As one, and one only -- there being many more of us than the media at
large realise -- who is firmly of the belief that Burns is not up to the
hugely daunting task any Celtic manager faces in the present, I am
rueful that Burns chose not to fall on his sword.
His successor would, I am convinced, have had the budgetary authority
that Burns so clumsily tried to bludgeon out of McCann. McCann is now
clearly aware of the fierce groundswell against his niggardliness, but
will not for a long time at least, retract -- for fear of losing both
face and authority.

All eyes were firmly focused on the greatest flat race of the season,
the Derby, at the weekend and true to form it produced a fairytale
result on its first running on a Saturday for many years. Where do you
go in racing after owning a Derby winner at the age of 19, even if you
are one of the oil-rich Maktoums from Dubai?
But while events at Epsom Downs may have been the highlight of the
week, another first on the racing calendar was taking place in the
shadow of Scone Palace in Perthshire on Thursday.
National Hunt racing had finished the previous Saturday at Stratford,
but in a bid to follow the example of several other countries, including
France and Ireland, an experimental summmer season was planned. And it
all began in Scotland. So no sooner was it finished but it started all
over again.
There's something about the atmosphere of a National Hunt meeting
which is peculiar to it alone and Perth is the undiluted version. None
of the frills and the top hat and tails of the flat season or the sniff
of new money there.
The weather kept the feel of a winter meeting. It was cold enough to
be Wincanton in deepest December and it brought out a rash of tweeds and
Trilbys, waistcoats and fob watches, not to mention the occasional kilt
and velvet hat. Unlike Epsom not a glimpse of Chanel or Valentino.
But there was a huge turnout. They came by bus, and car and taxi, and
some even on bicycles. The car park was awash with pre-racing picnics,
as the great and good of the big houses in the neighbourhood made their
way to Scone if the cut glass accents were anything to go by.
''Did you bring the binos?'' one be-Barboured worthy asked. That
rhymes with winos for the likes of you and me. Her companion demurred.
''One doesn't like to be too serious about these thing, old gel,'' he
said. ''Do they go round more than once in every race?'' he then asked.
No chance of being taken too seriously it seems.
The meeting was sponsored by an irrigation company, Wright Rain, and
featured such oddly named races as The Wetter Better People Novices'
Hurdle, and The Sprinked Excellence Novices' Hurdle. Somehow it seems a
pity Willie Sparkle could only be runner-up in The Giving Nature a Hand
Handicap Steeple Chase.
Richard Dunwoody, one of racing's most popular jockeys, had two rides
at the meeting. However, he was not so popular when he failed to win on
a very much odds on favourite. ''You're a useless article, Dunwoody,''
one disgruntled punter called, as Old Habits passed the line, a
three-and-a-half lengths second. It's unlikely article is the word
anyone outwith the members' stand at Perth would have used.
But Dunwoody had other things on his mind. Ever the gentleman, he was
besieged by autograph hunters and was generous to a fault. Undoubtedly
his hardest task of the evening was to spot the best dressed filly among
the crowd. It was really a question of who had the newest, tidiest
Barbour jacket on.
To entertain the crowd there was a display of birds of prey. Maybe it
was really to make the vultures, or rather bookies, feel at home.
But they may not have gone home with their bags as full of money as
usual for four favourites won at the meeting. I even had four winners in
the five races I saw. And the racing was good, attracting runners from
Ireland, Wales, and England, as well as a healthy home trained
contingent.
To finish the evening, there was a barbecue and a dance (in a marquee
of course) after the end of racing. Clerk of the course Sam Morshead did
his best to encourage the departing throng to join in but the men from
the cheap seats were not impressed. ''Follow the drink, boys. Never mind
that namby pamby stuff,'' one said as his friends dallied, conscious of
the enormous queues in the car park.
The organisers can be proud of their first night of a new season and
did well to put on such a show. But two crucial questions remain. Who
did win the best dressed filly contest or are they still looking? And
did Sam Morshead have an earlier career with Pan's People?

IT SEEMS obvious but, like all brilliant ideas, nobody thought of it
before. If you and I can benefit from winter sunshine away from the
British chill, and athletes even more, why not racehorses? Take a horse
away from the north European winter, train it in a warmer clime, and
bring it back in glowing fitness for the flat season and you might just
have an advantage over the rest.
Sheikh Mohammed, who came up with a spectacular, million-pound
international version of that theory, founding the Godolphin stable in
Dubai, hit the ultimate jackpot for his strategy at Epsom on Saturday
when Lammtarra won the Vodaphone Derby.
That victory signals the establishment of a racing revolution that has
startling implications. The Arab stable, where the horses are owned by
the Maktoum family, could be en route to straddle world racing in a way
that has never been seen before. They have already become the richest,
most powerful owners in the sport, buying the best with their enormous
wealth, laying the foundations for a breeding empire that will ensure
their dominance for the foreseeable future but now their take-over
threatens to become complete.
Sheikh Mohammed's brainwave -- to remove a few of the best classic
hopes from around the myriad stables the Maktoums use in Britain,
France, and the USA after their two-year-old careers and set them up in
tailor-made training facilities in Dubai for the winter -- has been a
phenomenal success, and it is only in its infancy.
Horses from Godolphin have won six Group One races in five different
countries since April, a strike rate that would have seemed close to
impossible a few years ago. The collection of the Oaks on Friday with
Moonshell, and the Derby the following day with Lammtarra, climaxed an
early summer campaign that has left the racing world breathless.
Lammtarra, owned by 19-year-old Saeed Maktoum Al Maktoum, son of
Sheikh Maktoum, had raced only once in his life, in August last season,
and to win a classic in his second race 10 months later is a feat that
can only be described as incredible.
Winning jockey Walter Swinburn, ''The Choirboy'', was particularly
emotional after lifting his third Derby as he recalled that the horse
was originally trained by Alex Scott who was murdered last year. Scott
actually had a bet of #33,000 to #1000 that Lammtarra would win the
Derby before he had even seen a raceourse. The bet, which would normally
die with the gambler, has been honoured by Ladbrokes who will send the
cheque to his widow.
How far the winner can go remains to be seen but there has to be such
potential for improvement that another of these ''wonder horse'' claims
inevitably will surface. Now Lammtarra (it means invisible) will be very
visible indeed wherever he goes next. There were no indications from the
connections as to the possibility of taking on Celtic Swing in the Irish
Derby next month, but Sheikh Mohammed's words will send a chill through
all contenders for the major prizes. ''The future for Lammtarra looks
wide open, as he may improve after only his second run,'' he said, ''but
we have such a wealth of horses for the big races that we will have to
sit down and have a good think about the programme.''
There were a lot of Pennekamp supporters sitting down to have a good
think, too, but it was in rather less complicated territory, based on
choice of weapon with which to end it all. The French favourite was in
trouble a long way out and finished sore, but until Andre Fabre gets him
home to examine his reaction, we won't know if the 2000 Guineas winner
failed to stay or jarred himself on the fast ground.
The record time for the race in a sense vindicated Peter Savill's
decision to go for the French Derby instead with Celtic Swing. The man
from the Cayman Islands, whose Sila Blanca won a later race, said: ''I
have always said I felt the ground would be very fast here. I walked it
twice and saw no sign of real rain and I'd have been worried today, not
if we'd have won the race but if we'd have come back from it.
''After watching the race today I had no regrets over my decision. It
was the right one.''
Epsom, on the first Saturday Derby since 1953, was no startling
success in terms of crowd appeal. The crowd, 54,266, was only 3% up on
last year but it will be when the bookies' national turnover is counted
that the real difference might be seen. For the hoi polloi who fill up
the VIP lawns, Wednesday comes just as conveniently as Saturday, but,
even among those in the workhouses, there is a strange apathy about the
switch. One amiable Cockney, drinking from his can of lager, put it this
way: ''It aint the same when you can't take a day off work. Naow we
gotta do in our own time.''
In the club enclosure there is roughly a 50% divide between those
watching the racing and those gazing enviously at the higher echelon of
British society. In the Queen's Stand, which is a kind of white-painted
designer Drumchapel with elongated verandahs, the rich and powerful peer
down at the unfamous with benign tolerance. Yet there is what you could
call a peeking order. Those on the ground look up at all above them,
particularly the balcony about halfway up where Royalty, especially the
Queen Mother, are the recipient of much affection. Above the royal
floor, Ministers of HM Government and ex-Ministers, and sundry other
well-kent political faces, jostle for positions to be recognised. Above
that, yet further down the peeking order, come aspiring VIPs, themselves
peeking down at the boxes below to see the premier division inhabitants.
It is all very English, very daft, and very harmless.
Everywhere, the most exquisitely exposed fetlocks traipsed daintily
across our paths, and we are not talking about horses.
Across on the plebeian side of the winning post, a band played between
races, open-decked buses galore housed the proletariat, marquees with
'Licensed Bar' boldy printed on top did roaring business, hot-dog stands
charging #2 a time got away with it, and the green Espom Downs were
hidden from view.
Outside and across the road the gaudiest Fair, with a variety of
terrifying contraptions whirling into the sky, was still doing its thing
as the mixture of rollers, Lamborghinis, and Porsches queued up to head
for home and wait for Royal Ascot. On top of a mini-bus, a drunken
off-duty lager lout gave ''My Way'' a dreadful time, accompanied by an
equally inebriated saxophone player whose attempts at finding the
appropriate notes were on a parallel with some of our attempts at
unearthing winners.
All tastes readily catered for. That's the Derby.

CAPTAIN Steven Pressley is certain he can lead Scotland to a historic
first-ever victory over Brazil tonight.
The Coventry City defender, a self-confessed fan of the South
Americans, will put aside his admiration in a bid to win the Toulon
Under-21 International Tournament.
For Pressley and his central defensive partner Christian Dailly, know
that their international futures depend on their performances against
the Brazilians.
But he insisted: ''They play football the way it should be played and
have shown they can also handle the physical side of it.
''They have several exceptional players and I have been impressed by
them. But they are not invincible.
''This is my third and last attempt to win this tournament. I am
determined to go home with the title. Right from the outset I knew we
would have to beat Brazil to achieve this success.
''I see no reason why we cannot go all the way. This Under-21 team is
as good as any I have played in.
''There is lots of character and leaders on the park. We have had to
do it the hard way to reach the semi-finals, but never at any stage did
I doubt we would get there.
''In many ways it is just like a club side -- we share a lot of jokes
and friendships.
''Everything depends on how we handle Brazil. We must shut them down
at every opportunity.
''It is important we set the pace and don't let them take the
initiative and settle into their rhythm. If our approach is right we
will score goals against them.''
Pressley, who will be winning his twentieth cap, admits he has had a
torrid time in the Premiership following his #750,000 transfer from
Rangers to Highfield Road last season.
He said: ''I had an up-and-down time, playing some good games and some
bad ones. But it was a learning experience against some of the best
strikers in the game and this will stand me in good stead.
''Ron Atkinson and Gordon Strachan have faith in me and have helped me
develop. With a prolonged run I can prove myself in the Premiership.
''It has always been a big ambition of mine to get into the full
Scotland squad. However, I know I have still a bit to go before that
happens.
''But playing with Christian Dailly has benefitted me. We enjoy
playing together and complement each other's style. He holds the line
well, is unbeatable for pace and reads the game well.''
Pressley will recover from a knee injury in time to allow Scots' boss
Tommy Craig to field his strongest team.
Craig, who will be joined by national coach Craig Brown for the
occasion, said: ''Pressley and Dailly have been the bedrock of the team,
but have never yet been extended.
''They will be this time because Brazil like to hurt where it matters.
''Yet I feel confident they will rise to the challenge. Only through
games like this will we be able to decide whether they have the ability
as a pair to step up to the senior side.
''If we come up with a performance anywhere near our capabilities we
have a very real chance of reaching the final.''

BRITAIN'S Laura Davies is poised to exceed her earnings of more than
#1m last year after a thirty-sixth career victory following a final
round of 67 in the American Express Evian Masters in France on Saturday.
A 17-under-par total of 271 left Davies five clear of Sweden's Annika
Sorenstam, the Australian Open champion who claimed her sixth runner-up
spot.
It was an awe-inspiring performance by Davies. A winner's cheque for
#40,630 took her earnings to more than #414,000 this year.
Davies tops the money list on both sides of the Atlantic. ''It would
be nice to do the double,'' said Davies, who last year was the first
foreign player to become the leading money-winner on the LPGA Tour.
''Laura isn't in a different league, she's on a different planet to
the rest of us,'' said Dale Reid, whose European record of 21 tournament
victories is now under threat by Davies, who is only two behind.
Davies remains the epitome of the modest campaigner. ''If I win, the
money takes care of itself. I was nervous starting today's round, but I
had a lucky break on the first hole and that settled me down,'' she
admitted.
On the opening hole, a wayward drive bounced back from a tree on to
the fairway, from where she struck a No.8-iron to two feet for a birdie.
A monstrous uphill putt of 45 feet produced another at the fourth and,
out in 32, she was six strokes clear of the field.
Sorenstam eased past Catrin Nilsmark by holing a putt of 15 feet for
an eagle 3 at the final hole. Leading scores (British or Irish unless
stated):
271 -- L Davies 68, 67, 69, 67 (#40,630).
276 -- A Sorenstam (Sweden) 68, 72, 68, 68 (#27,750).
277 -- C Nilsmark (Sweden) 68, 69, 70, 70 (#19,255).
279 -- A Nicholas 71, 66, 72, 70 (#14,755).
282 -- C Dibnah (Australia) 70, 70, 70, 72.
283 -- C Hjalmarsson (Sweden) 70, 72, 71, 70; H Wadsworth 67, 72, 73,
71; T Johnson 68, 71, 72, 72.
Scottish scores: 284 296 -- D Reid 75, 70, 77, 74. 297 -- G Stewart
75, 73, 78, 71. 299 -- J Forbes 76, 72, 76, 75. 310 -- C Panton-Lewis

Republic of Ireland 1, Austria 3
TWO-GOAL Toni Polster sent the Republic of Ireland reeling to their
first defeat in the European championship qualifying tournament in a
stunning last 25 minutes at Lansdowne Road yesterday.
Now Jack Charlton's team, having thrown away the hard earned lead of
Ray Houghton's 65th minute goal, face an inglorious farewell to next
summer's finals in England unless they can turn the tables on Austria in
Vienna in September.
After that they have two more matches in the qualifying competition at
home to Latvia and away to leaders Portugal, but they are now just two
points ahead of the Austrians, who have played a game less.
Big Jack stuck to his guns and kept giant striker Niall Quinn and
veteran midfielder Ronnie Whelan in the side, despite last week's
disappointing draw against Liechenstein.
And even though Quinn was hauled off in favour of Tony Cascarino with
more than half an hour to go, it looked as though the plan had worked
when Houghton finally rewarded typically persistent pressure with a
scrappy goal.
But within four minutes Polster, the pony-tailed Austrian striker from
German club Cologne, fired the visitors level with a magnificent curling
25-yard free kick.
Three minutes later, with the Dublin crowd still recovering from the
shock equaliser, substitute Andreas Ogris sped through the middle,
little more than a minute after coming on, and shot past goalkeeper Alan
Kelly from a right wing cross by Johann Kogler.
Polster, the man who surrendered the chance of staying in Germany this
weekend to try to become the top scorer in the Bundesliga, delivered the
final insult with a thrusting power header from Christian Prosenik's
right wing cross with only 12 minutes left on the clock.
It was never easy for the Irish to put themselves back on course after
the Liechenstein set-back, but they worked hard at their game and it
needed a splendid save by Austrian keeper Michael Konsel to keep out
Quinn's shot on the turn from Tommy Coyne's low eighth minute cross.
Austria showed rare menace when Konsel caught Denis Irwin's curling
free kick and bowled it out to Stefan Marasek who set up an opening for
Dieter Ramusch which goalkeeper Kelly had to save with his feet.
But everybody expected the real bombardment to be borne on the wind in
the second half and when it came Cascarino was the man sent on to lead
it.
The Austrians were at full stretch to stem the flow and their only
attack of note was when Polster broke clear at the other end but was
booked for handling the ball before drilling it in.
It was a sign of their desperation and it was doubled when Houghton,
recalled to the right flank in place of Jason McAteer, smuggled in the
goal which looked likely to win it for the Irish with 25 minutes left.
Substitute Jeff Kenna was involved in the move which led to
Cascarino's shot being conveniently deflected for Houghton to run in at
the far post and score.
But the huge roar that greeted the breakthrough soon died in the
throats of the Irish fans as the Austrians mounted a stunning comeback
and Charlton's team collapsed inexplicably.
Irish manager Jack Charlton admitted his side face a ''difficult''
battle to qualify for next year's European Championship finals following
the defeat.
Charlton admitted: ''I'm still confused about the situation but
certainly qualifying is always going to be difficult. There are still a
lot of hard games to go for everybody involved.''
Charlton, however, had no doubts about where his side went wrong in
his 90th international. Their first defeat in the current qualifying
competition came because their midfield ran out of legs after they had
scrapped to find their way in front.
''It wasn't the real us out there in any way shape or form,'' stressed
Charlton, who was without injured duo Andy Townsend and Roy Keane.
''We didn't have the power, particularly in midfield. A lot of the
lads were struggling at the end of a long, hard season.''
Veteran Ronnie Whelan was retained in a midfield anchor role, and
Charlton turned down the chance of playing the younger figures of Jason
McAteer and Alan McLoughlin in that area.
He explained: ''I needed somebody in there to stay solid and stop the
Austrians counter-attacking, but our central midfield players lacked the
legs and there was not any power coming through.
''The Austrians gave us no trouble at all for the first three quarters
of the game. Then they equalised and that was it.''
Charlton also blamed German referee Markus Merk for Austria's vital
second goal, scored by substitute Andreas Ogris, claiming: ''A silly
refereeing decision probably cost us the game.
''We thought Denis Irwin had been fouled and the ref was going to give
us a free kick. But he let play go on and Austria scored the second
goal.''
He added: ''Everybody gave commitment but our lack of power in the
midfield was the big problem.
''The players I put in there did what they could but in the end it was
not enough for us. Now we have to regroup and see if we can come back
from this.''
* A FIRST half goal by Dynamo Kiev midfielder Yuri Kalitvintsev helped
Ukraine to a shock 1-0 win over Croatia in their European Championship
group four qualifying match yesterday.
The defeat was Croatia's first of the competition but they still top
the group with 16 points from seven games, three points ahead of Italy
who have a game in hand. Ukraine remain in fourth place.
In the same group, Dzoni Novak scored twice as Slovenia beat Estonia
3-1. While in Group 3,
Iceland defeated Hungary 2-1 in Reykjavik.

TENNANT CUP:
EUROPEAN Amateur champion Stephen Gallacher won the Tennant Cup at
Glasgow Killermont yesterday and now has high hopes of lining up with
his customary foursomes partner Gordon Sherry at the 1995 Walker Cup.
''Gordon will definitely play at the Walker Cup after his British
championship win,'' said the Bathgate golfer. ''Hopefully now I will be
playing with him, as we make a great partnership.''
Gallacher carded a one-under-par total of 281 for his two rounds over
Glasgow Gailes and two at Killermont, a score he shared with former
Scottish Amateur champion Alan Reid, of Kilmarnock Barassie.
But Gallacher notched up a steady par at the first extra hole of the
play-off while he watched Reid drive into a bunker, overshoot the green
with his next, and after a good recovery finally miss a five-foot putt
which would have kept the game alive.
Rounds of 75 and 69 over the par-71 Gailes course left him in only
third spot overnight, despite the fact that he felt he was playing at
his very best. ''My 69 could have easily been a 62,'' he said
afterwards. ''I lipped out about six times.''
0 An opening 70 over Killermont left him six adrift of Reid after
lunch and missed opportunities -- he lipped out again for an eagle at
the fifteenth and missed a six-foot putt for a birdie at the sixteenth
-- left Gallacher believing it was all over.
''I thought I had to par the last to force a play-off, but I lipped
out for a bogey,'' said Gallacher. However, his final 67 was enough to
bring him level with Reid's closing 73. Leading scores:
281 -- S Gallacher (Bathgate) 75, 69, 70, 67; A Reid (Kilmarnock
Barassie) 71, 68, 69, 73 (Gallacher won at the first extra hole).
282 -- A Turnbull (Inverleithen) 70, 68, 71, 73.
286 -- H McKibbin (Troon Welbeck) 74, 73, 68, 71.
288 -- G Davidson (Langholm) 72, 74, 70, 72.
289 -- M Urquhart (Inverness) 74, 74, 73, 68.
290 -- S Armstrong (Ratho) 74, 76, 68, 72; D Patrick (Mortonhall) 76,
73, 65, 76; E Little (Portpatrick Dunskey) 73, 73, 71, 73; L Kelly
(Cowal) 72, 71, 76, 71.

TORWOODLEE'S Mike Thomson completed his expected victory in the
72-hole Borders Championship over his home course yesterday.
The beaten finalist in the 1990 Scottish Amateur championship romped
home to a 12-stroke victory.

course record four-under-par 64 in the afternoon, he was virtually
unassailable.
Steady rounds of 74 and 75 in yesterday's drizzle over the new 18-hole

Ireland 12, France 36
IRELAND'S World Cup hopes ended in Durban on Saturday with their
limitations laid bare by French forward power.
Thierry Lacroix kicked 26 points, and equalled the international world
record with eight penalties, before two late tries earned France a
deserved 36-12 victory margin.
Ireland's third successive World Cup quarter-final exit left them
hugely disappointed -- but they never had the firepower to match a
French side which now marches into the semi-finals getting better all
the time.
Noel Murphy, the Ireland manager, said afterwards: ''The players are
very disappointed because they didn't play the way they would have liked
to have done.
''In fact, we were lethargic at times, but having said that we just
didn't get the ball often enough to be able to control the game.
''We also suffered too many turnovers in the loose and France
dominated the lineouts, an area in which we thought we could compete
pretty well.
''This French pack is a very good one. They are very controlled,
disciplined, and patient and in the end the best feature of the game for
us was our defence.''
Ireland captain Terry Kingston added: ''We just didn't get enough
possession. France controlled things and it will take a very strong pack
and a very good side to beat them in this competition.
''They've got a solid scrum, a good lineout, and all eight forwards
handle the ball well, and can run with it.''
The match was level at 12-12 at half-time, with fly-half Eric Elwood
landing four penalties from four attempts. But each time Lacroix replied
with a kick of his own.
In the second half, when the French forwards took over and pinned
Ireland deep inside their own half, Lacroix added four more kicks --
making it eight penalties from nine attempts -- to leave his side 24-12
up after 72 minutes.
Elwood's only other penalty chance came after 65 minutes when the
Irish trailed by only 18-12, but he pushed it wide of the right-hand
post.
In truth, however, it could not be seen as a last chance because only
for a five-minute period did Ireland mount any sort of threat after
half-time.
A try had to come -- both for France's sake and for the spectators who
had enjoyed very little in the way of entertainment.
Repeated French forward surges at least provided some action and after
79 minutes another attack ended with French captain Philippe Saint-Andre
popping up in midfield to carve through a gap that had at last opened in
the Irish ranks.
Lacroix's conversion gave him a total of 88 points from four matches
in the tournament, but afterwards the Dax centre said: ''My ambition is
not to be the top points scorer in the World Cup. I just want to be a
world champion.
''Our forwards did superbly today, and they were the ones who put me
in the position to kick those goals.''
France's second try, from right wing Emile Ntamack, came deep in
injury time.
Ireland, in a final defiant effort, flung the ball out wide on the
left. But Ntamack intercepted Brendan Mullin's pass to left wing Simon
Geoghegan and sprinted 80 yards for a score in the right corner.
Lacroix's conversion failed, but he didn't seem to mind -- jogging
back to join in a celebratory huddle by his French team-mates.
Captain Kingston, in his third World Cup campaign, said: ''The French
are a very strong side. They are good runners and ball handlers. I think
they are still in with a shout in this tournament.''
Kingston was pleased with the way his team-mates managed to hold
France in the first half and was delighted that Ireland had managed to
prove a few doubters wrong during their time in South Africa.
''A lot of people wrote us off before the tournament. But we have
shown that there is a lot of promise for Irish rugby in the future,'' he
said.
''We came here to compete and get as far as we could. We reached the
quarter-finals and hoped we could get further, but it was not to be.
''We wanted to run the ball more but were unable to get possession.
Our defence worked hard and tackled strongly. But the French used their
heads and worked well in the lineout where we found it difficult to get
much ball.
''We found them a tough and very strong side. We competed strongly but
they were just too good for us in the end.''

'The Samoans were in danger of losing the place. They were questioning
a lot of decisions and thought that I was blowing against them'
JIM FLEMING
South Africa 42,
Western Samoa 14
SCOTTISH referee Jim Fleming found himself at the centre of a racist
remarks row after the South Africa v Western Samoa Rugby World Cup
quarter-final clash on Saturday with claims that Springbok scrum half
Joost van der Westhuizen had taunted the South Sea islanders during and
after the game.
Fleming, one of the world's top referees who is a leading candidate to
officiate at the showcase RWC final, said later that he had been unaware
of racist taunts being made throughout the game.
The issue was raised at the post-match press conference when Western
Samoan captain Pat Lam declined to deny that the South Africans had made
racist remarks during the highly charged game and in the tunnel as the
players were leaving the pitch.
Yesterday, Fleming said: ''Kitch Christie, the South African coach,
asked me at the reception if I had heard anything but I told him I
hadn't.
''That was the first time that I had even heard the suggestion that
the South Africans were abusing the Samoans,'' he added.
Lam was asked at the press conference whether van der Westhuizen had
made racist remarks as the teams were returning to the dressing-room.
After a pause he said: ''No comment.''
However, he is reported in the Johannesburg Sunday Times as saying:
''He said a lot to us and what he said after the game couldn't be
printed.
Fleming said: ''I was through the tunnel before the players arrived.
The match officials are whisked away by security men.''
The game, which the South Africans won 42-14 and which heralded a
four-try return for black Springbok winger Chester Williams, was played
in a highly emotive atmosphere with virtually all of the 60,000 Ellis
Park crowd backing the Springboks.
Fleming said: ''The atmosphere was very intense and, in fact, I've
never refereed in an atmosphere like that before. A lot of that was due
to the fact that there was so little support for the Western Samoans.''
The Western Samoans, who played their usual game of big-hit tackles --
some of them high and late -- found themselves on the receiving end of
Fleming's whistle.
The penalty count of 21-8 in favour of the Springboks incensed the
Western Samoans and later coach Bryan Williams confined himself to
saying that he had not agreed with some of Fleming's decisions.
The referee said: ''The Samoans were getting rather excited and Pat
Lam was doing a lot of talking to me. Frankly, they were in danger of
losing the place. They were questioning a lot of the decisions and they
thought that I was blowing against them. They were getting rather
agitated.
''I'm sure that if the South Africans had been resorting to racial
abuse then Lam would have mentioned it to me.''
The Western Samoans were critical of the referee's performance,
casting doubt on two of Williams' tries, one which may have been
preceded by a forward pass and another when he seemed not to have
grounded the ball properly amid a melee of bodies.
There is little doubt that Fleming was given scant assistance by his
French touch judges Patrick Robin and Joel Dume.
Western Samoan full back Mike Umaga was guilty of two vicious
head-high tackles. The first, on Andre Joubert, which immediately
preceded Williams' first try, was missed by Fleming who had been
watching the run of play.
Umaga was involved again a short while later when he crashed into van
der Westhuizen. The Springbok scrum half made a meal of the clash and
the penalty was awarded but from then on the crowd were baying for
Umaga's blood.
Yesterday, the RWC authorities announced that Umaga was to be
''cited'' for dangerous tackling.
The tournament organisers decided following the brawl which marred the
South Africa v Canada match that if a referee took no action at the time
then they would use television evidence to take retrospective
disciplinary measures.
The hearing will be held today, shortly before the Samoans are due to
fly home.
Springbok full back Andre Joubert may have played his last game in the
World Cup. Joubert broke a bone in a hand early in Saturday's game and
although the Springbok management are hopeful that he will return later
-- by which they mean the final on June 24 -- his further participation
must be in some doubt.
Forwards Ruben Kruger, Mark Andrews, and Kobus Wiese also were hurt
during the game, while wing James Small continues to be troubled by a
nagging hamstring injury that forced him off the bench.

Zimbabwe 22, Scotland XV 43
SCOTLAND return home tomorrow at the end of their four-match tour
which ended on Saturday in Harare where the tourists defeated the host
country in the second Test to post their fourth victory from four games.
Substantial though the scoreline was for the development side,
Scotland coach David Johnston was still critical of the performance.
''When we got our game together we looked good, but when we eased our
foot off the pedal we looked less effective,'' said Johnston.
The final Test produced three tries for Scotland, two by the London
Scottish centre Ron Eriksson, during a second-half burst, and a
first-half touchdown by the experienced Derek Turnbull who capitalised
on a fine blind-side break by Graeme Burns.
Most of the game, however, was dominated by penalties, the constant
procession of awards against both sides reducing the match to a
succession of set-pieces and cancelling out the possibility of
continuous play.
Significantly, all of Scotland's tries were scored from set-piece
moves, but the frustration of not being able to generate worthwhile
second-phase possession was evident.
The bulk of Scotland's points came from the kicking of Stuart Laing,
the Instonians stand-off, who put over eight penalty goals and two
conversions.
Incredibly, Laing had several misses and with the Scots twice over the
Zimbabwe try line but without reward, David Johnston was quite justified
in asserting that victory could have been by 60 or 70 points.
Despite what was overall a far from perfect performance by the
tourists, there were some good individual efforts. Always prominent
among the forwards was Graham Dall, Heriot's open side flanker, whose
pace off the tail of the lineout produced the first of Eriksson's two
tries.
There was also an impressive performance in the pack from Alan Watt,
the GHK player showing up well in the loose and in the lineout.
All of Zimbabwe's points came from their centre Ian Noble, who kicked
five penalty goals and converted his own try to help his side to a 22-17
interval lead.
Scotland XV -- R Shepherd (Edinburgh Academicals); H Gilmour (Heriot's
FP), S Nichol (Selkirk), R Eriksson (London Scottish), D Stark
(Boroughmuir); S Laing (Instonians), G Burns (Stewart's-Melville); A
Watt (GHK), M Scott (Orrell), S Paul (Heriot's FP), I Elliot (Hawick), R
Scott (London Scottish), D Turnbull (Hawick), S Reid (Boroughmuir)
captain, G Dall (Heriot's FP).
Zimbabwe -- E Chimbima; A Jani, I Noble, D Walters captain, B Norman;
C Brown, S Day; R Moore, B Beattie, N Mujaji, S Landman, P Stephenson, B
Dawson, T Tabvuma, D Kirkman.

'To say that I am upset is the biggest understatement of all time. All
of the guys are shell-shocked'
BOB DWYER
AUSTRALIA
M Burke, D Smith, J Little, T Horan, D Campese, M Lynagh, G Gregan, E
McKenzie, P Kearns, D Crowley, R McCall, J Eales, V Ofahengaue, D
Wilson, T Gavin.
ENGLAND
M Catt, T Underwood, W Carling, J Guscott, R Underwood, R Andrew, D
Morris, J Leonard, B Moore, V Obugu, M Johnson, M Bayfield, T Rodber, B
Clarke, D Richards.
THE 80 minutes were up on the clock, with England and Australia level
at 22 points a piece after a match that had tested the emotions of
Englishmen all over the world, when Rob Andrew, so often his country's
saviour, received the ball.
His drop goal soared exquisitely between the posts to snatch a
three-point victory that now sees Will Carling's men safely through to a
semi-final clash with New Zealand in a week's time.
''When Rob hit that drop goal I couldn't believe it as it seemed to go
on for ever,'' said Carling. ''I've never seen a kick like that before
and I have never played in a game like that before either. It was a very
emotional and tense day. Rob gives us such confidence as a kicker, and
today we saw him do it again. However, I have to say that Australia are
a great side and it means a lot to us to beat them like we have today.''
Bob Dwyer, the Australian coach, launched a scathing attack on the
English play after the game. ''I don't like their style of play,'' said
Dwyer. ''It isn't exactly exciting, all they do is shut you out of the
game for long periods and roll mauls and kick the ball up in the game.
They certainly stuck to their game plan today.''
England, playing in front of a crowd apparently populated by little
Englanders, were leading 13-6 at the break, a Tony Underwood try giving
them a marked advantage, not least psychologically, as the score came
about when the Aussies, who used to pride themselves on error free
rugby, made yet another mistake.
A little loop move went astray when Lynagh failed to grasp the pass,
and Jeremy Guscott released Underwood by way of counter attack for one
slice of flowing English rugby that traversed the length of the pitch.
Two penalties apiece from Andrew and Lynagh were the other scores.
England were nothing if not effective, with Tim Rodber and Martin
Johnson able to thwart Australian attacks, and Ben Clarke willing and
able to launch into the open field.
In contrast, John Eales, the Australian second row, was the main
strike force from Down Under but struggled in the lineouts and neither
his back division nor his forward pack was able to generate enough
possession to pull clear of England's stranglehold.
Then, as the referee started the second half, the drama started.
It was close but it was never pretty. An up-and-under saw Damien
Smith, the big Australian left winger, leap high for the try on
England's line and Lynagh's conversion drew the scores. From that point
both teams advanced to 22 points before the final, epic contribution
from Rob Andrew and England's glory.
One of the more disappointing facets of the game was the absence of a
large crowd at Newlands to watch two of the world's biggest teams in
action. ''I was very surprised at the lack of crowd,'' said Dwyer. ''It
affected our game and I thought that there would have been a good
turnout.''
Obviously overcome at the devastation of exiting the tournament at the
quarter-final stages, the Australian coach was close to tears as he
surveyed his own future in the game. ''I am now going to take some time
over the next week and consider retiring. To say that I am upset at it
is the biggest understatement of all time. All of the guys are
shell-shocked.''
Of all the sides in the tournament, it is England who have now ground
themselves into a form of rugby that is producing results, albeit
against an Australian outfit that has stuttered and stammered through
the competition as a team that looks to be a shadow of its former glory.
Some of the great players, like Jason Little, captain Phil Kearns and
Michael Lynagh himself, have not performed at the heights that they have
seen before, and as for the greatest of all, David Campese, it has been
sad to see a man with such talent play on too many years after his
sell-by date and make mistakes where once he rang alarm bells in every
defence in the world. ''I hear David Campese's retiring,'' said Carling
afterwards. Campo wouldn't confirm or deny.

IT'S obvious if you are here in the thick of things that what the
rugby authorities want us to see is a sanitised version of rugby. A
version in which Snow White could get a job as the hooker, St Francis of
Assisi would be picked at open-side wing forward, and Cardinal Winning
takes the kicks at goal.
A version in which everyone is so very, very nice. Except those
naughty Western Samoans that is.
A game full of running rugby with as little contact as possible. In
fact, it would appear that touch rugby would be a good solution. Citing
a Western Samoan player after the event may or may not be a good idea,
but the South Africans are big boys.
I remember the soccer World Cup last summer where no hard tackling --
in fact, no real contact at all -- turned it into one of the most boring
exhibitions of pretty boys in football gear that the world had ever
seen. It was inoccuous, repetitive, sanitised soccer for the masses. All
on the lush turf of the good old USA.
Thankfully, the World Cup hasn't been like that at all with some
fierce stuff around the paddocks, but while I would never in my wildest
dreams back dangerous and deliberately dirty rugby, there has been the
most incredible load of guff talked here about foul play, and the
efforts some of the teams are making to gain the higher moral ground are
quite staggering.
There has hardly been any foul play, but that is what folks want to
concentrate on.
Everyone is hammering into the Western Samoans. They tackled late and
high against the South Africans with Mike Umaga -- he undoubtedly
learned his physical stuff at Victoria's in Glasgow -- putting in some
dreadful tackles which Jim Fleming was eternally guilty of letting off
too lightly, but that is the way they play.
You tell them before they take the pitch that they cannot do that, but
not before they do it. I have found it faintly amusing that the South
Africans, with a history of spectacular cheating whether it is the use
of steroids, shoulder pads, or lifting in the lineout, should start to
whinge like Poms because a few South Sea islanders give them a bit of a
roughing up. Poor little South Africans.
And the glee with which the suspension of James Dalton and Pieter
Hendricks has been greeted by the South African press has been a bit
like watching grateful vultures hovering around a carcass.
Rugby's great strength is that it is a physical game. It's a game
played by people who like to bump into each other and enjoy physical
contact. It's a game in which people involved in the sport know what is
dirty and what is not. It's a game in which little or no damage is done,
usually, by the perpetrators of foul play and, ironically, a game in
which physical play can open up the game to its benefit.
First and foremost, a message has to be sent out to the world that
rucking is to be allowed. We cannot continue namby-pambying around in
our game with the uneducated of the rugby world thinking that it is
entirely acceptable for one pack to sprawl around at the bottom of rucks
and prevent the flow of the game.
And we must let some referees ruin games by penalising those that lie
on the ground and they must allow those who are there on time to free
the ball.
Sorry, but as the All Blacks showed at times yesterday, rugby can be a
tough game.

WE wanted to do it so much for Gavin. But in real life, fairytale
endings are most times just found in books for bed-time.
That was real life out there today. The All Blacks are a very good
side. They never give you an inch and to score against them you have to
work every inch of the way.
We genuinely thought that we could beat them. All that talk beforehand
about how we could make Scottish rugby history by beating them for the
first time in 90 years wasn't just the usual pre-match hype. We really
thought that we could do it.
I didn't think that I played that well. I couldn't really get into the
game and the ball never ran for me. Jackie Joiner, in my opinion, had a
great game. You can't blame him for Jonah Lomu's try and the rampaging
runs that the big fellow got in. I don't think there is a winger playing
in world rugby today who could stop Lomu when he gets up a head of
steam.
He's some strike force. However, Jackie showed that he's not so clever
in defence when he had a couple of good runs at him. The only guy who
could stop Lomu when he's powering away at full speed is Inga-the-Winga
Tuigamala, but he's gone to rugby league and so it looks as if wingers
are going to have a few nightmares yet about the big man.
The feeling in the dressing-room wasn't the same as it was after the
defeat by France. Then, we knew that we could and should have won the
game. But against the All Blacks, even when we came back at them in the
last 10 minutes, they always had that cushion of points to make them
feel safe.
Even now that we're out of the World Cup I still reckon that we're not
a bad side. There are a lot of younger players in the team who are only
going to get better as they gain more international experience. I'm sure
that Scottish rugby can build on the lessons that we've learnt out here
and go on to have a great Five Nations' campaign next year.
Before the game started, we gathered in a huddle after the All Blacks'
haka. Gavin reminded us what was required and that was a 101%
performance from everyone.
I'm just so sorry that we couldn't have strung it together a bit
better and that Gavin has to go out on a losing note. However, he has
done us and Scottish rugby proud. When it was all over he shook each of
us by the hand and we went back outside to thank the Scottish fans.
When you saw the reception he got, that made you realise just what he
has meant to the Scottish rugby public over the last nine years. We'll
miss him.

South Africa
Scotland 30, New Zealand 48
THE record still stands. After 90 years of trying, Scotland have still
not beaten the All Blacks.
There is some consolation to be had from the fact that Scotland's 30
points represents the highest tally ever achieved by Scotsmen against
the Kiwis and that it equals the highest number of points ever conceded
by New Zealand, but Scotland had given it their best shot and still it
wasn't good enough.
Scotland knew that the All Blacks were too good to be beaten by an
orthodox game plan and right from the kick-off they tried to keep the
All Blacks -- or at Loftus yesterday afternoon, the black and whites --
guessing.
Jonah Lomu, with a devastating run in only the fifth minute -- a run
which skirted Craig Joiner and scattered the Hastings brothers like
ninepins -- that led to a try by Walter Little, confirmed what everybody
knew. His is a destructive force with ball in hand but, again, he looked
decidedly ordinary in defence.
Nevertheless, if he can lay on tries and score them himself, then even
the All Blacks can live with his defensive frailties.
Scotland were disrupted by the injury to Craig Chalmers. The Melrose
fly-half was in obvious distress from the twentieth minute onwards when
he sustained a mighty crack on the head. A leg injury a short while
later led to him being replaced at half-time by Ian Jardine, Shiel
moving to fly-half and the Stirling County man taking up his usual berth
at centre.
Scotland trailed 17-9 at the interval and were still in with a shout.
However, the killer blows were struck immediately thereafter with two
tries in quick succession. Both were converted and suddenly they were
looking at 31-9 and it was a completely different ball game.
The Scots showed great character to come back strongly in the final
quarter, two tries coming within 15 minutes of the end and a try count
of 6-3 compared to 6-1 turned the performance into something entirely
more credible.
Scotland surprised New Zealand from the kick-off when Chalmers kicked
short and Rob Wainwright raced in to pick up the loose ball.
After five minutes, New Zealand went ahead through the Little try,
Andrew Mehrtens converting, but Scotland provided the perfect answer
just a minute later when Joiner -- who had a more than satisfactory game
-- blasted around a statuesque Lomu. Chalmers was late-tackled by
Kronfeld and Hastings, playing his sixty-first and last game for
Scotland, speared home the penalty from just a metre inside the New
Zealand half.
Hastings closed the gap to a single point after 14 minutes with a
successful penalty goal which resulted from a clumsy and dangerous
tackle by Little on Shiel.
After 19 minutes Scotland were awarded a penalty in front of the
posts. Iain Morrison opted to run, but he was sunk and the chance was
lost. A simple goal by Hastings would have made it 9-7 in Scotland's
favour but the pre-match orders had been to grasp every opportunity. If
the gap existed the Scots were to go for it.
0 Mehrtens missed with a penalty goal -- he missed five times in all
and had he been successful the scoreline would have had a different
complexion -- but after 28 minutes Lomu was handed a gift of a try when
he brushed aside the tackles of Joiner and Scott Hastings. Mehrtens
converted and five minutes later kicked a penalty to put New Zealand
17-6 ahead.
Hastings retaliated with a penalty goal of his own just when Scotland
needed it most and the turn was reached with the Scots still in the game
and six points in arrears.
Then, disaster. Twenty seconds into the second period, a Mehrtens high
ball was guddled by Hastings Sr and Little strolled in for the softest
of tries, Mehrtens again converting.
Just four minutes later, New Zealand completed the double whammy when
Mehrtens set off on a 50-metre touchline run, rushing past Joiner and
Hastings to touch down. He converted and at 31-9 it wasn't looking good
for Scotland.
Six minutes into the second period, though, Scotland strongarmed their
way back, Doddie Weir crashing over for a try after a maul on the New
Zealand line. Hastings converted and, to their eternal credit, Scotland
were still in with a shout at 16-31.
Just a minute later Frank Bunce sailed in for another soft try,
Mehrtens converting. Suddenly Scotland were in trouble again.
Scotland had a poor third quarter and after 63 minutes they found
themselves in trouble once again when Lomu found himself the recipient
of the ball with a huge overlap looming. Sean Fitzpatrick was on his
left shoulder and Lomu, wisely, handed on to the skipper who celebrated
his 100th appearance for New Zealand with a rare try. Mehrtens converted
and Scotland were once again -- shades of November 1993 -- looking at a
Kiwi half century.
But still they did not buckle. Joiner tackled Lomu inside the Scotland
half and, from the turnover, Redpath and Scott Hastings forced play
upfield, Joiner's perfect touchfinder providing a lineout on the New
Zealand line.
Graeme Bachop made a complete nonsense of his clearance kick and Weir
pounced for the try, his second. He said later he would have given them
both up for a Scottish win. Hastings converted and it was 23-45.
Mehrtens kicked a penalty goal to bring the New Zealand scoring to a
close but with seven minutes remaining to play, Scotland threw
everything into a last-gasp dash for respectability.
Logan, Jardine, Redpath, and Morrison cut deep into All Black
territory before Morrison provided the link for Scott Hastings to go
over for the try five minutes from the end. Brother Gavin converted and
Scotland had their 30 points. It was good enough for a record Scottish
performance against New Zealand but arithmetic and statistics do not win
matches.
To win, Scotland had to play a flawless game with numbers 1 to 15
turning in a life-time best performance. At times they came close to
that but, simply put, the All Blacks were just too strong and too good.

Jimmy Nicholl will fly to Norwich today for talks to confirm him as
manager at Carrow Road.
City chairman Robert Chase broke off a holiday in France, where he is
attending the Toulon Tournament, to step up negotiations.
Before returning to Norwich, Chase revealed: ''Jimmy wants to look
round the club before making his decision.
''I have agreed personal terms with him and compensation to Raith
Rovers who have handled the entire matter very professionally.
''He was highly recommended to us but I had been following his career
closely in any case.
''He has done a tremendous job and it is hard to see what more he
could achieve with Raith Rovers.''
Chase has been under pressure from his supporters to spend the
millions accrued in transfer deals last season.
Nicholl has been promised all the money he requires to reclaim
Norwich's place in the Premiership.
His first target will almost certainly be Raith's Steve Crawford, the
free transfer player he transformed into a full Scotland international.

Pretoria,
SO, farewell then Big Gav. The final chapter in one of the most
stimulating stories that sport has to offer was not quite what the
scriptwriter ordered, but little did the Tartan Army care when Hastings
was carried shoulder-high from the Loftus Versfeld turf.
He took his final bow 5000 miles from home and captaining a losing
side, but the mighty mark he has left on the record books will stand for
a while yet. It was 61 and out, a cap record that may yet be beaten by
brother Scott, who made his fifty-seenth appearance for Scotland
yesterday. But at least they keep it in the family.
His 667 points for Scotland is a record that will take a tad longer to
overcome. Yesterday he captained Scotland for the twentieth time, but
these statistics are dry as a bone compared to the man himself.
Hastings has led Scotland with conviction and story-book derring-do.
Just minutes after he had been mobbed by hundreds of supporters out on
the Loftus pitch he was in the ITV studio speaking to the folks back
home.
Scores of vociferous Scots outside an open window were threatening to
drown out the live broadcast. They were ''telt tae wheesht'' by an
anxious soundman. Hastings did his piece, and the silent Scots asked
plaintively: ''Tell us when we can sing Gav.'' And they meant it. The
man is a leader to his stocking soles.
Afterwards, there was the obvious question that just had to be asked.
How do you feel Gavin, now that is is all over?
''The feeling is one of disappointment,'' he said. ''We came into the
game full of good vibes. I just wish that what we achieved in the last
10 minutes we had done for the other 70.''
Typically, he was refusing to talk about himself. But then he opened
up: ''The feeling is also one of immense pride, captaining Scotland at
the World Cup and leading them for the last three seasons. It has been
magnificent. At times it has been very hard, but you can put away the
bad times and savour the good times. That's how I'm feeling right now.
''I'd like to pay tribute to the Tartan Army. The support that we have
received has been fantastic and they certainly make themselves heard,
that's for sure.
''Coming out here to the World Cup was an ambition of mine and it has
been a great experience that will live with me for a long, long time.
But now is the time to move on to new things.
''So far as today is concerned, I want to say how proud I am of the
way that the boys came back in those last 10 minutes, when I'm sure it
must have looked to most people as if New Zealand would score 60.
''There is no disgrace in losing to New Zealand. No Scottish side has
yet beaten them. We were hoping to make a piece of history today, and we
genuinely believed we could do it, but now it will have to wait until
next year, when Scotland will go their on tour.''
Even in the moment of his going -- and in the aftermath of defeat --
the humour was not far away. Hastings was asked about Jonah Lomu.
''Well, he certainly takes some stopping. He's a huge man, there are no
two ways about that. Mind you, I'm not too sure that New Zealand would
like to tackle him either. He's certainly a big bastard,'' said
Hastings, a grin creasing his face.
How do you spell that, he was asked. B-I-G, Hastings replied.
There was a tribute, too, for Hastings from the victorious All Black
captain, Sean Fitzpatrick, who was celebrating an anniversary of his own
-- his 100th match for New Zealand.
''Gavin Hastings is certainly the best full back in the world at the
moment,'' said Fitpatrick. ''We began our international careers in the
same year and so I'm a contemporary of his. Gavin has been a fine player
and a fine ambassaddor, not just for Scottish rugby, but for the game of
rugby as a whole.''
Showing commendable Northern Hemisphere solidarity, Hastings said
later that he was delighted that England had beaten Australia and that
they would now go on to play the All Blacks.''I'll be staying out here
until the end and I wish England every possible success for their
remaining games,'' said Hastings.
Double Scottish try-scorer Doddie Weir said: ''I hadn't scored a try
for Scotland in over 30 games, but I would have traded them both for a
win for Scotland today.''
Coach Douglas Morgan said: ''We decided that we would take the game to
them. The killer was the tries just after half-time.''
The Scottish casualties, Craig Chalmers and Damian Cronin, were
suffering from respectively a 'dead leg' and a left ham-string strain.
However, as darkness fell over Pretoria it could not extinguish the
beacon which Gavin Hastings has borne aloft for himself and for Scottish
rugby since his debut in 1986. He has been an inspiring leader, every
mother's dream son-in-law and a perfect role model for the thousands of
Scottish youngsters who have followed his career these past nine years.
Those size 10 boots are going to be mighty hard to fill.

FINLAND defeated Greece 2-1 in Helsinki last night to blow open
Scotland's European Championship qualifying group.
This was the first result of any significance achieved by the Finns
and yet it was enough to push them a point clear of Russia and Scotland
at the top of the section.
Last night Scotland manager Craig Brown watched the game and admitted
afterwards: ''The result suddenly brings Finland into the reckoning --
but it has also strengthened our own qualifying position.
''After all, Finland still have to play Russia twice, as well as come
to face us at Hampden in September. Right now they are top of the group
and they were celebrating after the game as if they had already
qualified. But there is a long way to go before this group is settled.
''The run of games we have between now and the end of our programme --
all at Hampden -- is something the other countries must envy. But we
take nothing for granted.''
However, the Scots are in a more powerful position than they were
before last night's clash in Helsinki.
Last night Greece actually scored first through Nicolaidis -- but a
fightback from Finland saw Jari Litmanen score with a penalty just
before half-time after one-time Aberdeen front man Mixu Paatelainen had
seen a goal disallowed.
The Finnish captain Hjelm scored the winner early in the second half
and the Greeks, who were understrength for the game, simply folded.
Said Brown: ''It was a good performance by Finland and that carries
its own warning for us. But, it also means Russia cannot afford to slip
up against them.''
The cause of the Scotland Under-21 side was also helped. The Greeks
lost 1-0 to Finland on Saturday and had three players sent off which
means none of them wil be eligible to play here in August.

Cape Town
DAVID Campese added to the speculation about his impending retirement
last night when he said in Cape Town that the advent of money into the
game was making rugby less enjoyable. His remarks came after England
captain Will Carling had said that he understood Campese was retiring
after the World Cup.
''I don't know where Will got his information from,'' said Campese.
''All I said to him after the game was 'well done.' It would be improper
of me to make an announcement right now, the timing would be wrong. I am
going to think about it very soon. I have some club matches coming up
and we play a series against New Zealand soon.''
Campese has long been rumoured to have been paid to play rugby in
Italy, but he said that the money was of no importance. ''What I will
say is that people are talking about the money situation now. All of
this money is making the game far less enjoyable for everyone. The game
is not what it was.''
Campese was obviously distressed at the loss to England, as were
coaches Bob Templeton and a tearful Bob Dwyer.
Meanwhile, victorious England captain Will Carling received a
congratulatory dressing-room kiss on Sunday from the ''old fart'' who
sacked him as England skipper last month.
Dennis Easby, president of the Rugby Football Union, was among the
first to join the English celebrations at Newlands after the win over
world champions Australia.
''I saw the president with tears in his eyes and kissing the captain
afterwards,'' said coach Jack Rowell. ''We've got this on video, it's
worth a fortune and I'm Victor Ubogu's agent.''
Carling, sacked then reinstated within 72 hours after referring to the
RFU as ''57 old farts'' in a television documentary, was diplomatic
about what the pair discussed. ''I can't think what the president said
to me that I can repeat, but he was happy, very proud. It was nice to
see him in the changing room,'' said Carling. ''He said 'well done.' He
said he's never been through anything like that before.''
It was only the second win for England over Australia in their last
eight meetings dating back to 1984. The other English success was at
Twickenham in 1988, Carling's first as captain.

NEWSVIEW: bid to save Newton Stewart's historic cinema
''Everybody's a dreamer, everybody's a star,
Everybody's in movies, doesn't matter who you are.
And those who are successful, be always on your guard,
Success walks hand in hand with failure, along Hollywood Boulevard.''
(Ray Davies)
THE celluloid heroes of Hollywood's golden age are etched in concrete
along its famous boulevard. But Newton Stewart's own memento to moving
pictures stands as austere reminder of the other side of the street.
The Galloway market town nestles alongside the River Cree, amid green
fields, rolling hills and smart Edwardian gardens. It is Secretary of
State Ian Lang's own backyard, but the area is shifting under the weight
of factory closures, agricultural decline, one in five out of work, and
a long-term unemployment rate approaching 30%.
A malaise of social depression threatens, adding poignancy to a
campaign to save the town's one indoor leisure amenity -- a 62-year-old
cinema, riddled with dry rot and burdened by estimated renovation costs
of #700,000.
As sole standing example of a rural art-deco picturehouse, the
building has achieved an important status. While property developers
queued up to tear it down and replace it with shops and flats, the
townspeople garnered behind local newspaper proprietor Iain Brown, 57,
to restore it to former glory.
There's little which is enigmatic about Mr Brown. He's a hard-nosed
businessman who has made more enemies than friends in the often
feudalistic environs of Galloway.
Intent on maintaining his family's third-generation control of the
town's biggest employer, The Galloway Gazette, he suffers neither fools
nor adversaries gladly. But these personal qualities are needed if the
campaign to save the cinema is to succeed.
Above all, Brown is a community man. ''I don't have any particular
love of films,'' he admits, explaining that when the cinema closed in
1982 a local schoolteacher asked him to help fight to save it.
''It's been an uphill task since then, but I now believe we can raise
the money needed to provide Newton Stewart with a leisure amenity it
deserves,'' he adds.
A similar townsman and entrepreneur, Mr George Gouldson, brought
moving pictures to Newton Stewart 80 years ago.
It began as a trial venture with silent movies in a corrugated iron
and wood building in 1916. Seventeen years later Gouldson housed his
world of celluloid in a more substantial fabric.
On the site of a former meat depot in the town's main Victoria Street,
he built a memorial to the era, complete with swing doors, electric
lighting and three white marble statues -- including a six-foot Nubian
Slave by Rosetti.
The new cinema premiered with the comedy Jack's the Boy and remained
packed throughout the 1930s as customers flocked from Stranraer,
Whithorn and Wigtown to savour the new talking films, including the
blockbuster Mutiny on the Bounty.
The war years provided another boom with attendances boosted by RAF
and Army personnel and Italian prisoners of war all billeted nearby.
Former box-office cashier Ms Alexina Cameron, 91, recalls the days
with clarity. ''There were always long queues right down Victoria
Street. It was especially the servicemen who came to watch the films. A
bus even ran from Creetown at the weekend, just for the cinema.''
Mr Alan Hannah, 78, also holds fond memories of Newton Stewart's movie
past. ''Every Saturday night the family would all go out,'' he said.
''The routine would be the same -- a good film followed by a bag of
chips.''
By the 1950s Mr Thomas Gouldson had taken over the running of the
cinema following the death of his uncle and continued to bring
box-office successes to the town.
But the sixties saw a boom in TV sales and a fall in attendances.
Across Britain once-thriving cinemas were closed or converted into bingo
halls.
Newton Stewart's own movie mecca suffered. The building was also
showing signs of physical decay. In May 1968, facing financial disaster,
Mr Gouldson sold the premises to a supermarket developer for #14,000.
Within a week concern had grown to community disquiet. At a series of
public meetings Councillor John Forbes-Sempill led a campaign to buy
back the cinema.
By July the developers had been persuaded to resell for #12,500 with
Forbes-Sempill paying the purchase price from his own funds.
The re-opening was a roaring success with the box-office smash Doctor
Zhivago.
Money which had been put into the enterprise by some 30 local people
was to be held in trust, some as ordinary shares and some on debenture.
The late 1960s and 1970s saw a mini boom in attendances with films
such as Annie and Grease filling the seats as Show Boat and Rebel
Without a Cause had done 20 years earlier.
But the advent of home videos sounded the death knell. In 1980, 49,395
film fans paid their way into the cinema. A year later the total had
dropped to 45,145 and in 1982 only 31,058 came looking for big-screen
entertainment.
Mr Forbes-Sempill endured the loss-making before he was forced to tell
shareholders: ''I don't want to see the cinema close, but I have to be a
businessman and put sentiment out of the way.''
Once again public demand ensured the cinema was thrown a lifeline. An
appeal lodged #2700 with the Bank of Scotland. Early in 1983 The Save
the Cinema Committee -- a group of local enthusiasts chaired by Iain
Brown -- took over the running of the premises.
With the services of professional projectionist George Crockett, the
committee succeeded in showing films throughout the rest of the 1980s,
and even made a small profit.
But in December 1991 Wigtown District Licensing Authority made clear
that it would not renew the cinema licence ''without major expenditure
on the building''.
The cinema did not re-open after its Christmas break and
Forbes-Sempill -- now Sir John Forbes of Craigievar -- began to search
for a buyer.
The Save the Cinema Committe made its own bid for the freehold tenure,
but timber specialists estimated that it would cost #32,000 to eradicate
the dry-rot alone.
The committee's search for extra funding began with the Bank of
Scotland offering an overdraft facility. Local tradesmen offered
services or materials free, while a public appeal raised #6000.
The purchase price was reduced to #30,000, but as the district council
reversed a three-year funding pledge to chase a #2m heritage centre
project it was too late.
Sir John sold his beloved cinema to local property developer Jim
Scott, who by the spring of 1994 announced his own plans to redevelop
the site for flats and shops.
But the dream did not die. Mr Brown, backed by a new committee of
influential businessmen -- including a local bank manager -- eventually
persuaded Scott to sell the building for #38,000.
Mr Brown explained that the purchase had only been possible ''through
the generosity of a Dumfries and Galloway-based company.''
He told The Herald: ''Jim Scott made a great contribution to the
community by agreeing to sell. We have 18 months to put together a
funding package to re-open the cinema, otherwise the company who bought
it on our behalf have the right to develop it as they see fit.''
But the reality of the deal was not made public. The purchasers were
rival builders, Robison and Davidson, who are owned by Brown's close
friend and golfing partner Bob Robinson.
Mr Scott is now angry: ''I was led to believe the cinema was being
bought by the Save the Cinema Committee for the community. It was only
at the last minute I discovered who the real purchasers were, by which
time it was too late to back out.
''If I had known that a rival property developer was buying the
building -- and a prime town centre site -- I would have asked double or
possibly not sold at all.''
The new committee boasts that despite renovation and extension costs
running to #700,000, the cinema could begin showing films and staging
theatrical productions within a year.
A display of plans has been opened in the cinema's foyer while local
painter and decorator David Inglis has repainted the building's external
facade.
''We hope to develop the cinema to include a 300-seat theatre, play
festivals, concerts, pantomimes and host Dumfries and Galloway Arts
Festival events,'' explains Mr Brown.
There's #25,000 in the bank account, 1250 signed up to support the
project, and a recent public meeting attracted 200 townsfolk.
Brown knows the support of local people can be relied upon.
''I would definitely use the cinema,'' says Mr Jonathan Herries of the
town's Ghyll Crescent. ''Lots of people are just standing around in the
evenings with nothing to do.''
Mrs Mary Murdoch, who lives in the nearby village of Kirkcowan, adds:
''Neither of my children has ever been to a cinema. You have to buy
videos but it's not the same. We would definitely use it -- and a
traditional Saturday morning cinema would be ideal for the wee ones.''
Brown is confident about future prospects. If he succeeds, his name
will surely be etched in the town's own memorial of concrete -- its
cinema.
'We have 18 months to put together a funding package to
re-open the cinema'

Rennie McOwan visits the scenic Scottish village
which has more than a literary spark
WHAT have Ratty, Mole, Toad, and Badger got to do with warring
clansmen or couthy tales of an eccentric crew of a sea-going lorry with
one of the first planned towns in Scotland?
All of the links lie with Inveraray, in Argyll, which is really
village size, but has royal burgh status. Its white houses on a striking
promontory and nestling on the north-west shore of Loch Fyne, backed by
woods and the hill of Dunchauch make it one of the most scenic sites in
Scotland.
This is particularly true when seen across the loch from the Strachur
road. Inveraray should be pronounced Inver-air-ah because it lies at the
mouth of Glen Aray and the River Aray, but it is a losing fight. Most
local people nowadays say Inver-air-ay and so does television
advertising, but strictly speaking it is historically wrong.
This is Campbells' Kingdom, the heartland of that great and
expansionist clan. Although the Scottish folk-mind tends to be cool
towards the Campbell's image it has to be fairly recorded that their
upsurge followed their support for the fugitive King Robert and the
Bruce and they tended to back the winning side in power struggles
thereafter.
They got their come-uppance a couple of times, once when the Atholl
men and their friends swept across into the area and hanged several
Campbell leaders and once when Alasdair Mac Colla, the redoubtable
second in command of the Marquis of Montrose's army in the seventeenth
century Scottish Wars of the Covenant, planned the winter sacking of the
town.
Inveraray-born Neil Munro, who gave us the hilarious Para Handy tales
which also produced that gloriously funny film The Maggie and several TV
series featuring the puffer The Vital Spark, also wrote historical
novels of outstanding quality.
They are nearly all centred on Inveraray and skilfully tell of an old
theme, the change in Highland life in the face of new ideas and
cultures. Two novels, John Splendid and The New Road, have been
re-issued in modern times.
Make a note of May 11 and 12 next year in your diary: a Neil Munro
festival is being planned for Inveraray and the Scottish Association for
Literary Studies will hold its conference in the town and there will be
a ceilidh, lectures, walks, the launch of Neil Munro Society in
Inveraray Castle and an ecumenical church service.
A large ship, The Arctic Penguin, moored at the pier, includes a
display about Neil Munro's life and you can see Crombie's Land, the
house where he was born.
The ''modern'' Inveraray Castle, the seat of the Dukes of Argyll, was
built in 1744-61 and partly delayed because of the 1745 Jacobite Rising.
It is sited close to the outline of an older and more grim fortress. It
has paintings, period furniture, tapestry, armour, weapons and pleasant
walks in the grounds. Roger Morris was the architect, William Adam the
clerk of works and Robert Mylne and John Adam assisted with the interior
so it was all bound to be stylish and impressive. Rober Mylne designed
Blackfriars Bridge of London and was surveyor of St Paul's Cathedral. He
is buried in Westminster Abbey.
The burgh was erected in its present character in 1744 when the 3rd
Duke and 12th Earl decided to erect a new castle and shunted the
resentful tenants to a purpose-built, new town beside the loch. It was
an unpopular action, but we reap the benefits of one of the most
attractive village/towns in Scotland.
Sited at the junction of three passes, Inveraray has always attracted
prominent visitors, including Robert Burns, James Hogg, William
Wordsworth, Tennyson, Samuel Johnson and Gladstone.
To get a bird's eye view of Inveraray, the strategic passes and the
big hills round about, walk from the castle through woods and to the top
of 800ft Dunchuach. It has a folly tower on top, specifically built to
look romantically ruinous when seen from the castle. If you don't feel
like making the summit, there are shorter walks in the woods.
The old courthouse and prison close to the loch side and formerly
called The Ramparts -- and where the youthful Neil Munro sat with a book
and absorbed the sights and sounds of the tides -- has now been turned
into an award-winning visitor centre.
There are standing displays and re-enactments of trials and you can
see the cells and go inside. Some of it is not for the squeamish, but
you certainly get your money's worth.
Kenneth Grahame, author of one of the world's best known books for
children, The Wind In The Willows (although some critics argue that it
is really a book for adults) was born in Edinburgh and spent part of his
boyhood in Inveraray. He may have got his ideas of the Wild Wood there.
There are other, poignant memorials in addition to Celtic crosses and
monuments to executed clan leaders and memories of Celtic saints.
Inveraray was the headquarters for combined operations during the Second
World War, the old business of the foreign wars, and the quiet glens
buzzed with soldiers and sailors from many nations and great men planned
the destruction of Nazi Germany.
You can see the remains of their huts in the woods around the castle
and a small museum has been set up in the castle grounds.
Images of Inveraray are apt to stay in the mind, the quiet lapping of
the waves on the shore, the little white houses, their closes and
tenement ''lands'', the prominent church tower, the castle nearby, the
wooded glens and Dunchuach, a near-sacred hill for many people.
Neil Munro once wrote: ''Glad am I my mother bore me here . . .'' You
don't have to live in Inveraray to appreciate that: just visit it.

Sylvia Kingsley enjoys a friendly market economy
FOR a gentle touch of Africa, just six hours flight away, The Gambia
offers endless sunshine, friendly people and a fascinating land which
can be covered in a week.
One of the smallest countries in the area, The Gambia hugs the banks
of the River Gambia which snakes through it extending more than 200
miles inland; you're on to first names so quickly with everyone it feels
as though you know the whole population by the time you leave.
Once a sliver of Britain's colonial past, The Gambia is also one of
the major English-speaking countries in West Africa, which makes it a
big draw for northerners escaping winter blues. Since the timeclock
doesn't change, there's no jet lag and life is so relaxed a local joke
is that GMT means ''Gambia Maybe Time''.
Groundnuts, once the major industry, has slipped to second place as
tourism has taken the lead since independence in 1965. Visitors are a
lifeline and get a warm welcome.
Thirty miles of superb beaches front the Atlantic and are backed by
tall, swaying palms and tropical gardens; holidaymakers spread
themselves with much ease, a great contrast to the Mediterranean.
Hotels are mostly African-style to blend in with the landscape ranging
from the simple to the deluxe, and there are no brutal high-rises to
tarnish the views. To get to know Africa is to take excursions with the
engaging local guides who take care to see that everyone stays together.
Banjul, the little capital formerly called Bathurst by the British who
built it in 1816, undergoes small facelifts all the time, like improving
roads and pavements. It's a lively and vibrant capital with an
informative museum, colonial buildings, busy port and brewery. Chief
attraction is the hectic market selling all you need plus a
mind-boggling assortment of fabrics, including home-spun batik which you
can watch in the dyeing process.
Like a happy village on fete day, life is social and humming in Banjul
under the sun. People go around carrying brilliant umbrellas for shade,
and squatting ladies and vendors sell mounds of fruit as large and
bright as plastic replicas.
Out at Serrekunda there's an even bigger market, as large as a
football stadium, and filled with just as many people. Vibrant with
colour, women sellers predominate behind stalls of food and fruit and
some hinge of great mystery, with items such as goats' horns, herbal
medicines and objects strange to western eyes.
Red dusty roads are lined with Acacia, Frangipani, Mango and Quinine
trees. Women pound millet in back yards, and animals rest lazily beneath
trees.
On sturdy black and white safari Land Rovers you can visit a school, a
compound and lesser-known bush areas dotted with Africa's Baubob trees,
winding up with lunch under a thatched roof on a surf-lapped beach.
The Abuko nature reserve, an area of 180 acres of ''protected jungle''
is just 15km from the hotel areas and a place where you can see lions
(imported from Britain's Longleat Estate), baboons, hyenas and monkeys
and a rich birdlife of more than 200 species.
Entertainment is mostly confined to hotels which have their own discos
and pianists; they also stage fashion shows and displays of African
tribal dancing which you're persuaded to join. Wrestling too, is a
national sport which draws an excitable crowd.
Restaurants offer good value with a range of cooking from roast beef
to chop suey. Hotels serve good English breakfasts with scrambled eggs
and bacon.
Craft markets burst at the seam with good buys, from fine wood
carvings to lovely fabrics, leather goods and silver and gold jewellery.

IF you let the Herald print extracts from your diary you get some
strange jobs. I was asked to perform the opening ceremony at the
Stonehaven Feein Market. It was a jolly occasion in the town square with
a pipe band, Highland dancing, cake and candy stalls, cheap Johns,
barbecued kippers and pints of very cold lager.
The ladies of ''The Rural'' had turned out in pre-war costume and
there was a knobbly-knee competition and an ugliest grimace competition.
The chairman, in introducing me, welcomed me to the 21st Stonehaven
Feein Market.
I couldn't let that go. I just had to tell the listening throng of two
old ladies and a man with his dog that my host had miscounted. As feein
markets were held twice a year from the 19th century until the 1930s,
this could hardly be less than the 121st feein market in the county town
of Kincardine.
And, having started on a lecture, I determined to continue. Though I
am far too young to remember a feein market, I would tell them all about
it.
The feein markets were where the farmers and their workers went to
make short contracts of employment. The married men signed on for a year
and the single men for six months. Toward the end of each contract was
''the speerin'' when the best men would be asked to stay on for another
contract, but most moved on. If the grieve moved, all the men had to
move and the farmer had what was known in the North-east as a ''clean
toon''.
Most of the old people who went to them describe the feein markets as
a humiliating experience for the men. ''Bought and sold like cattle'' is
the phrase often used.
Horses might have been more like it. It is said that the grandfather
of Jack Sleigh, the past president of the Royal Highland and
Agricultural Society, was just about to hand over the half-crown
''arles'' which would seal their bargain for a half-year, when he
thought he noticed the man making an awkward shuffle with his feet. He
withheld the money and asked the man to ''run yersel oot''; to trot up
and down (as a dealer would do a horse) to show that he was sound.
My grandfather, Maitland Mackie, is the unintentional villain of
another story about the humiliation of the farm servants at the feein
markets. He fee-ed a man at Ellon and made the casual remark as they
were parting: ''Man, ye've awfu big feet.'' Two days later a letter
arrived returning the shilling he had given in arles and said: ''Dear Mr
Mackie, if the feet doesn't suit, the man won't either.''
One who was less sensitive was our old grieve, Jimmy Low. He told me
quite a bit about the feein markets and seemed to have enjoyed them. It
was the one chance every six months to tell the farmers exactly what he
thought of them, and a good man like Low got the chance to send a number
of big farmers away with their character well explained. Jimmy was a
tough young man when approached by Maitland Mackie at Ellon in about
1930, and asked to come north as second horseman.
Low didn't say he wouldn't fee just: ''You hinna a very good
reputation.''
''And how's that?'' said my grandfather.
At that time he had started growing a 40-acre shift of potatoes which
meant a great deal of back-breaking graft in the winter and that was
Low's complaint. ''Your men have aye a bag o' tatties on their backs.''
All my grandfather said to that was: ''You might think better of me if
you were once home.'' And so it proved for Jimmy stayed in service of
Mackie and his heirs for 46 years, 44 of them here at Little Ardo.
I really suspect Low missed the battles at the feein markets.
Certainly his eyes shone when he told me about going to a great rally in
Ellon Town Hall at which the workers were addressed by Joe Duncan who
spent most of his working life on the impossible task of organising them
so that they couldn't be picked off one by one by the farmers. He formed
the Farm Servants' Union in 1912 and Jimmy Low was a member as soon as
he was old enough. Indeed he made Little Ardo one of the few ''union
shops'' on Scotland's farms when he was grieve here.
Joe told them how much to ask for and how much to stick out for, then,
most of them veterans of the First World War, they lined up behind a
piper and marched down to the square to meet the farmers, who picked
them off just as usual but not before they had had some cheek from young
Low.
After the deals were done, there was drink to be drunk, young women to
be met and fighting to be done, some of it organised in the boxing
booths.
There a line-up of old pros worked their way through a queue of young
farm loons, who were willing to be knocked out for the small hope of
winning a week's wages for standing up for three minutes.
Jimmy Low won his pound several times at the booths because he cracked
the system. All you had to do was to remain standing.
So what he did was to run away as skilfully as he could within the
confines of the small ring and cover his head as best he could to fend
off the blows that caught up with him. He would never, on any account,
hit his opponent. He knew that meant a very quick knockout.
The modern feein market has nothing at all to do with those old days.
They are gone without trace and I suppose we should be glad.

EATING fruit and vegetables has long been associated with good health,
hence the saying that ''an apple a-day keeps the doctor away''.
Like many such commonplace adages there is substantial underlying
truth which is now becoming recognised by scientific evidence.
A survey carried out over 20 years in Japan has clearly correlated the
consumption of green and yellow vegetables with reduced incidence of
cancers and coronary heart disease. Even where those studied persisted
in the use of cigarettes, eating fresh fruit and vegetables delayed the
onset of disease.
Cutting out nicotine completely had an even more beneficial effect on
life expectancy. It was very evident that nicotine use shortened life
through directly increasing cancers and coronaries and by hastening the
ageing processes. Similar surveys have been made in the United States
and Continental Europe, with again strong correlations between the
consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables and the decreased incidence of
diseases.
Evidence is now so strong that the most recent report from the UK
Department of Health advocates increasing our fruit and vegetable
consumption by at least 200%. Even larger increases could be
contemplated for Scotland where the standard diet has an international
reputation for inciting diseases such as cancer and coronaries.
What is it that makes fruit and vegetables so good for us? Convincing
evidence has come from studies at the John Hopkins University in the US
that green vegetables contain antioxidant substances which neutralise
harmful compounds in our cells. One such material found in the United
States is sulforathane which is found at especially high levels in
vegetables of the cabbage family.
In fruit, some of the beneficial compounds are related to the
anthocyanins which give colour to apples, pears, raspberries and
strawberries. Older readers may recall that the most prized fruit were
always those which ripened to a deep succulent yellow rather than the
more common reds. Doubtless countless generations had realised these
varieties were those most associated with good health.
Supermarkets are now the country's major sellers of fruit and
vegetables having taken about 65% of the market over the past 20 years.
As a marketing slogan they could wish for no better association than
that between their goods and improved health for the customer.
They will not be slow to cash in on the potential for increased sales
and enhanced profits. Unfortunately over the past 10 years there has
been a rapidly increasing tendency for the most profitable and consumer
attractive fruit and vegetables to be bought by the supermarkets from
outwith Scotland and the UK more generally. This is all part of the
global market which exists in horticultural produce.
Substantial profits await Scottish growers if they can break into the
home fruit and vegetable market by encouraging supermarkets to buy
locally rather than from abroad.
The marketing opportunity associated with horticultural produce and
good health will be exploited, to everyone's advantage. This can include
the Scottish grower, provided that continuous supplies of high-quality
produce are made available in accordance with contract specifications.
* Geoffrey Dixon is Professor of Horticulture at the Scottish
Agricultural College, Auchincruive.

DELEGATES at the Scottish Agricultural College's conference on policy
options for rural Scotland were asked to devise an appropriate cover for
a publication on Scottish farming in the year 2000.
Only one suggestion was forthcoming from the audience and that
envisaged a picture of a farmer with, behind him, a field of oilseed
rape. To one side would be an area left to weeds and wind-blown rubbish
(set-aside) and in the background a farm steading converted into flats.
A fairly depressing prospect but perhaps dangerously near the truth.
Spirits were hardly lifted by the contribution from Professor Mark
Shucksmith of Aberdeen University's department of land economy who
questioned the tendency to take it for granted that farming interests
and rural interests went hand in hand. In economic terms, he pointed
out, the influence of farming on the rural economy was on the decline.
As he detailed the results of research into ''rural disadvantage'' the
list seemed endless -- transport difficulties, restricted opportunities
for work and housing, feelings of powerlessness, widespread poverty with
65% of heads of household on incomes which would trigger benefit
payments.
At the same time there was a low uptake of benefits because, he
claimed: ''They do not think of themselves as poor because they grew up
in the thirties and forties without electricity and without
television.''
Addressing the purpose of the conference -- to stimulate debate on
attitudes to the Government's forthcoming White Paper on a rural policy
for Scotland -- he suggested people had to consider what they wanted
from ''rural Scotland''. Was it nostalgia, romance, peace and quiet,
rustic characters, food or tourism.
The most important question was who would form the rural communities
of the future, he suggested. The starting point for the White Paper
should be how life was lived in rural Scotland.
Throughout the country, of course, there is a wide diversity in rural
life. Scattered communities in the Highlands have been found to suffer
from a general feeling that they have no power to influence decisions.
In the lowland areas the articulate rural-based commuters do feel they
had power.
Middle-class home-owners tended to oppose new housing development and
to make their views known, said the professor. Lower-income groups might
support new development but never made effective representation.
While the impact of agriculture on the rural economy may be declining
that was hardly reflected in the rest of the conference programme
although Dr Graham Dalton's contribution did include some bare
statistics which supported Professor Shucksmith's point. The average
Scottish farmer is about 55 years of age. The intake of students
studying agriculture is falling and the hired labour force goes down by
about 3% every year. The number of full-time farms falls as
concentration goes on.
However, Dr Dalton did draw a possible scenario with farmers paid for
''investment'' in the environment and penalised for ''disinvestment''.
He welcomed the promotion of Scottish food brands based on the clean
environment -- indeed it might be the only way to position Scottish
produce in the enlarged EU food market, he suggested.
The idea of farmers being paid for caring for the environment is a
recurring theme these days. Already, driving about the country, we can
see some examples of fields not being cultivated and beginning to look
unsightly. Let that develop over a few years and the countryside will
soon begin to look scruffy rather than well cared for.
We are not talking here of buffer strips or conservation headlands
which are left to nature as a means of preserving watercourses or
providing habitats for birds and insects.
So the idea of paying the farmer for looking after the countryside
might not be so daft. A great part of our attraction as a tourist
destination depends on scenic beauty.
The point has been made that when money is paid to council gardeners
who look after the city parks and flowerbeds that is called a wage. When
money is paid to a farmer or crofter for an activity which, incidentally
perhaps, beautifies the countryside it is called a subsidy and is
regarded as something distasteful.
The sheep and the cattle on the hill do not only produce meat and
wool. They also prevent the slopes from reverting to scrubland.
One thing is clear. Scottish Secretary Ian Lang will not be short of
advice when he comes to produce his White Paper. The Scottish
Landowners' Federation will pitch in today with its tuppenceworth. It
has already declared support for one rural activity -- field sports --
which the organisation sees as an important contribution to the rural
economy.
As the SLF launched its handbook on the management of country sports,
Hugh Adamson of Careston Estate, near Brechin, demonstrated the ability
of the rural economy to adapt to changing circumstances.
Fifteen years ago, he recalled, the estate used to provide free
cartridges to members of Stonehaven Gun Club who were prepared to come
down and shoot pigeons. ''Now the Italians pay to come and do it for
us.''
In 1947 the estate used to let a river for #10. Now the charge is #250
per salmon caught and the river pays for itself.
However reluctantly, one must move with the times.

WITH the economy picking up, firms are spending more on research and
development, according to the latest Innovation Trends Survey by the CBI
and NatWest Technology Unit, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Last year manufacturers increased their R&amp;D spend to 6.7% of sales, a
sharp jump on the 1993 proportion of 4.3%. Non-manufacturers raised
their spending from 6.4% to 10.8% of sales.
Expenditure on training is also rising rapidly. The balance of
manufacturers reporting higher training spending rose from 29% in 1991
to 40% last year and is expected to reach 60% this year.
All companies are also spending more on capital projects and marketing
to support innovation.
Alec Daly, CBI deputy director-general, commented: ''The results of
this survey are very encouraging. The pressure to innovate is
customer-driven, and failure to respond means lost profits, and lost
customers. That firms are spending more in all areas and not just the
inputs like R&amp;D, show that they recognise this and are acting on it.''
Manufacturers are placing more emphasis on new variants of existing
products and new products based on existing technologies rather than
minor improvements to existing products. They are giving more priority
to reducing development times of both new products and processes. They
are also recognising the need to collaborate with other firms and
universities.

AN American-led consortium, which includes Richard Branson's Virgin
Group, is believed to be the front-runner to buy the MGM cinema chain,
Britain's largest, taking in around 100 cinemas and 18 multi-screen
sites.
The business is being sold by Credit Lyonnais which assumed ownership
when a loan went sour. Carlton Communications is also bidding and Rank
Organisation and Time Warner are also thought to be interested.
Reading Company of Philadelphia is leading a group of investors, with
Virgin as a junior partner, and a price tag of around #200m is expected.
After experiencing several delays, Credit Lyonnais is hoping a deal will
be finally struck within weeks.
Carlton's offer was last week cleared by the Office of Fair Trading
without referral to the Monopolies Commission.

<HEADLINE>Revenue spending #25m to highlight self-assessment changes Beware the iron fist inside velvet glove</HEADLINE>

A FORMER Chancellor of the Exchequer, in a jocular off-duty moment
some years ago, remarked that among the three statements most calling
for scepticism and concern was the one which runs ''I am from the
Government; I am here to help you.''
It was rather a long time ago so maybe things have changed. The Inland
Revenue anyway seems to want us to think they have. This is one of the
reasons why it chose to mount the type of cartoon-based advertising
campaign which has now begun to make people affected by the new rules
for self-assessment of income tax where there is a big change coming.
Mike Davis, the advertising man who got the job, claims the Revenue is
now ''a customer-focused organisation offering help where needed'' but
admits that getting people to accept this though is ''quite a problem''.
The cartoon character is intended to capture our attention and combat
''negative folklore about the taxman''.
The new self-assessment system will not affect the two-thirds of
taxpayers who do not have the annual chore of filling in a tax form
mainly because they have tax deducted under PAYE which will not change.
For the remaining nine million people, many of them self-employed,
this is the biggest change in 50 years. It may look like a soft sell but
there are strict new rules and harsh new penalties for being late. A
very iron fist is inside the apparently velvet glove.
One important new requirement is that from April next year all
taxpayers will be obliged to keep records of their income and capital
gains. These have to be retained for at least 22 months -- five years if
you are self-employed.
Until recently there was no legal requirement to keep records for
income tax, although they did and still do have to be kept for VAT. Now
the taxman wants detailed records and the new rules allow them to charge
a penalty of up to #3000 for what is termed ''each failure to maintain
or retain adequate records to back up a return''. The new regime also
brings in new penalties for not meeting the taxman's timetable, which is
getting tougher.
The new forms, which will not be going out until around April 1997,
will cover income for the tax year 1996-97. You will have until
September 30 to fill in the figures of income and allowances if you want
to leave it to the Revenue to work out the tax. But if you want to
calculate the tax yourself you get extra time -- until January 31.
That is an important deadline because if you do not get the whole
return in by the end of January you get an automatic penalty of #100.
And if you still have not sent it six months later there is another
fixed penalty of #100 plus possible extra penalties of up to #60 a day.
There will also be a 5% surcharge on tax not paid by February 28 and
another similar surcharge if it is still outstanding by July 31.
Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the Inland Revenue, emphasising a
friendly approach, says he does not want to be in the business of
collecting penalties and wants to help people get their returns in on
time. To that end he points out that there are over 350 tax inquiry
centres where you do not even need to make an appointment for a
consultation. ''Just drop in and we will be happy to try and sort out
your queries on the spot,'' he says.
You can even telephone day or night 0345161514 for free booklets
explaining the system. Sir Anthony says it will be simpler to understand
and do away with the ''rigmarole of inspectors making estimated
assessments when returns are not put in on time which taxpayers
invariably appeal against''.
For the self-employed he maintains there is nothing in the new rules
that they will not be able to cope with. ''If they do not already employ
an accountant they certainly need not rush out and engage one.''
And he insists: ''We want people to understand self-assessment. Their
tax office really is there to help them with it.''
Sir George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury, says he tried
his hand at filling out a prototype form and it took him 50 minutes
without the aid of an accountant.
Over the three-year run-up the publicity campaign may cost as much as
#25m but the Revenue is spending some #200m on the whole changeover and
will want to get value for money.

THE market for rented commercial property market showed slower growth
in May, according to the Richard Ellis Scottish Monthly Index.
Rental and capital growth in the office, retail and industrial sectors
was virtually flat compared with April.
The total rate of return for all commercial property fell to 13% in
May from 15.2% previously.
Commenting on the figures, the company's associate partner for
professional services, Andrew Lithgow, said there was a ''cooling off''
in the property investment market.
''The investment institutions are not quite so clear about their
intentions to invest in property. They still wish to do it but they are
being much more selective about the kind of product they wish to buy,''
he added.

MORE gloom for Britain's diminishing army of milkmen will come this
week with news of heavy redundancies at Unigate today and poor results
from Northern Foods tomorrow.
Unigate is expected to announce the cutting of around 1000 jobs
costing at least #50m. This will follow Northern Food's decision in
March to reduce its workforce by 2200 over two years.
The main problem is that milk roundsmen are being drastically undercut
by the supermarkets, now selling milk at almost half the price of
milkmen. Often it is a loss-leader, forced on the supermarkets by
competition from discounters who carry a narrow range of essentials such
as milk. Supermarkets also have a major cost advantage over the
delivered pinta.
The other problem for dairy companies is the price increase for
wholesale milk introduced by Milk Marque, the successor to the Milk
Marketing Board. The price has increased by 11% since November, which
has hit processing margins.
Doorstep deliveries are falling rapidly and Northern does not see the
market stabilising before 1997, when the milkman's share will be down to
30%, having halved in five years.
Analysts are not sure the fall will stop even at this level if the
present huge difference between delivered and supermarket prices
persist.

New York, Sunday -- International Business Machines Corporation has
reached an agreement to buy Lotus Development Corporation for $3500m.
The merger, valued at $64 a share, swiftly concludes IBM's bid for
Lotus, which it announced last Monday, when it stunned the computer
industry with its first hostile takeover attempt.
IBM chief executive officer Louis Gerster said that Lotus chief
executive Jim Manzi, who had not been expected to remain with Lotus,
will continue as chief executive of Lotus and run it when the company
joins with IBM.
Mr Manzi will become a senior vice-president at IBM and will report
directly to Mr Gerstner.
Analysts had been betting that IBM would have to sweeten its bid from
an original $60 a share in order to clinch a friendly deal with Lotus.
They believed the Armonk, New York-based computer giant would announce
that it had to sweeten its bid to a price in the range of $63-$64 a
share.
Mr Gerstner said that IBM does not yet know how much of a charge it
will write down for the deal, but that it does not expect the
transaction to close before the end of June, the end of the company's
second fiscal quarter.
IBM also said that Lotus will retain the Lotus name and that Mr Manzi
will also work closely with IBM senior vice-president John Thompson, who
heads IBM's software business.
''This is a very significant event for IBM,'' Mr Gerstner told
reporters at a press conference announcing the deal.
Lotus closed on Friday at $62.875, down 62.5 cents, on Nasdaq. Its
52-week low was $25 a share. IBM closed at $89.125, off 25 cents, on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Lotus, based at Cambridge in Massachusetts, developed the Lotus 1-2-3
spreadsheet in the early days of the PC industry. While the widely-used
system has been hurt by tough competition from Microsoft, the company's
Lotus Notes software, for sharing data and working in groups, has become
a popular product.
Lotus Notes is seen as a strategic product to help IBM regain a
competitive edge in the PC industry, as well in the growing area of
networked computers.
The deal was the first hostile takeover bid by IBM and had Lotus not
agreed to be purchased, it would have been a rare battle in the computer
industry.
At a news conference to discuss the hostile bid last Monday, IBM's
chief executive said that he hoped for a negotiated transaction.
The last major hostile takeover in the computer industry was in 1991
and involved NCR, which capitulated to AT&amp;T, after a five-month battle.

While the husbands and fathers pay their debt to society, the wives
and mothers must scrape together a living and a life for the family.
And, as Carmel McQuaid discovers, the prospect of release often causes
even more problems for the families
THE dawn of peace promises a huge dividend for a legion of wives,
mothers, sisters and children of long stay prisoners. For 25 years they
have shouldered a sentence never mentioned in news bulletins for crimes
they did not commit nor condone. They, rather than the terrorists, have
been the ones on whom the burden of long-term jail penalties have
weighed most heavily.
Inside, while he forfeits his freedom, his everyday needs are still
taken care of. He has TV, tuck shop and football. He has been relieved
of his normal responsibilities. There's time for hobbies that would be
impossible at home.
Outside, shortage of money cramps and cribs her daily existence. She
has to cope with a welter of info on benefits, prison protocol,
cut-price transport. Offers of paramilitary money and travel facilities
are a constant temptation. She must decide how to explain daddy's sudden
departure to the children, letting them see that he is good but bombs
are bad.
The 24% of the province's prison population classified as lifers --
against 5% in England, 7% in Scotland and 4% in the Irish republic --
means far more families in Northern Ireland than elsewhere are enmeshed
in problems peculiar to prolonged penal absence.
At the centre of the predicament is the prison visit. While this
encounter often determines the prisoner's ability to cope with the rest
of his week, for the outsider it brings its own ordeal. Anxieties are
aired and support sought as every fiddle faddle assumes major
significance in that small intense world. ''But problems at home, such
as the children mitching school, joy riding or bedwetting, gets shrugged
off as piffle,'' says Ann Simpson, a social worker with NIACRO, which
specialises in prisoner care. Pleas that he renounce violence and so
enhance chances of a shorter prison-stay can spark rows.
A journey from Newry or Larne often means a 5am start, with the
children dressed and the parcel prepared, every week over 15 years.
Entry to the prison involves a harrowing ritual: passes are handed in,
parcels checked, their baby may be searched. They sit and they wait. A
move to a different room. A bus comes. They are locked in and driven to
another building. Then the wait to be called.
Every week for 11 years Briege Clark, 39, a housewife from Armagh, has
travelled by bus to Long Kesh with her three children, now aged 21, 16
and 14, the only visitor of a political offender. She pinpoints the
strong family unit she has maintained as the reason for her husband's
remarkable contentment. Always an avid reader, he studies, he attends
classes. He runs. His day leaves no time for letter writing, whereas she
writes at least once a week.
Their get-together is the highlight of the week for all five.
Throughout, his younger daughter sits on his knee, her arms tight round
his neck. Briege regales him with happenings at home, from the
children's mundane activities to her own evening in the pub. Proposed
renovations to their home, or photos of a redecorated room, are brought
for his perusal. His bookworm daughter tells what she is reading.
He is not spared any problem. He hears how lights on in the house
until 6.30am, during the older girl's bilious attack, triggered a dawn
search by the security forces. A tale-out-of-school about his teenager's
late return from a disco prompts a stern caution that she be home at the
time appointed.
The weekly hour and a half at the prison entails endless
penny-pinching through the rest of the week at home. Since the state
pays for only one visit a month, fares and eats for the kids have to be
docked from the grocery money. Further frugal measures are needed for
the clothes, shampoo, soap, fruit, papers she likes to bring.
The children suffer a different penalty. One, newly transferred to
secondary school, opted out of the top stream after a classmate remarked
on her father's whereabouts. Endless coaxing from her teachers has
failed to persuade her to return. On one occasion, mistakenly concluding
that the prison visits had ceased, the younger girl fell into a coma. It
ended after four days when, strangely conscious of the doctor's
injunction that the gravity of the situation demanded her father be got
to the bedside, she bolted up in bed with a dramatic: ''Don't tell her
where he is, Mammy, don't tell her where he is.''
Determined they will never suffer their father's fate, Briege rules
with a rod of iron. No paramilitary organisation comes near her door.
The children don't know if they're Catholic or Protestant. Once,
identifying the family dog where the police were being stoned, she
stormed down the road to find onlookers egging her son to take good aim
and avenge his Da's imprisonment. She interrupted the scene, escorting
the lad home to a hail of buffets, impressing on his 6ft frame all the
way that, ''you don't fire stones at any man''. She proudly cites her
husband's remark about an inmate returned to prison after a second
offence: ''He needs you.''
Her husband's release is the high noon they all look forward to as the
apocalypse event of their life. But long-term plans are restricted by
the absence of any release date. Meanwhile the fate of so many erstwhile
terrorists affords Briege constant solace. ''I can go once a week and
see him. But I could not put flowers on a grave every week. Prison's
better than the cemetery any day.''
The McLaughlin family still recall the huge strain the journey from
Derry to visit her son Patrick in Gartree prison near Leicester caused
their mother, Rose . . . ''a week preparing to go and a week to get over
it and get prison and him out of your mind''. Rose died a short time
after her son's transfer home last year.
Money for the plane tickets, for a bus or taxi ride, and an overnight
stay every three months, kept the family continuously cutting corners in
their daily living costs for eight years. There was also a parcel and
the jeans he needed every so often.
With the end of his marriage after his life sentence in 1985, he
looked to his parents and sister, Valerie Beattie, to act as guardians
to his four children. ''It's a responsibility few would envy us.''
The long trek to visit him caused the children to miss school and
unsettled them. Yet their behavioural and learning problems were put
down to too little contact with their father.
The lengthy interval between visits made spontaneous chat difficult.
Patrick became resigned to the lifestyle, spending long hours painting
on to canvas his memories of old Derry. ''You ran out of things to
say.'' His sister's degree course in history and politics or his
ex-wife's welfare are the mainstay of his interest in home.
His transfer has somewhat eased the situation, ending the long journey
to England. Able to see him every week, his children are no longer
emotionally taxed by hyped meeting and tearful departures. The progress
of the campaign to have him cleared of the crime he and his family claim
he did not commit provides a meaty topic of conversation. But weekly
visits, as well as the responsibility for his kids, continue to be a
bind.
Ironically, the prisoner's return home can make the situation even
worse. Used to claiming benefit, spending it, disciplining the children,
the wife is loath to hand back these roles. Where there had previously
been a drink problem, the family have got used to all available money
going into the home.
The returned prisoner often fails to see that the person who made
their lives inside is now quite different to the spouse they knew
before; or that their erstwhile children are now young adults intent on
a life of their own. As well, having had their day structured for 14
years, structuring their own day can be difficult.
Irene Darby, 36, from Craigavon, dreaded her husband's release.
Bewildered at first at being landed on her own with three girls, she had
emerged from the circumstances a totally different person. The former
shrinking violet has given way to a past mistress in money matters, who
had no qualms about foregoing the prison visit in order that her
children might eat. ''He was getting fed and nobody else was going to
feed the children if I didn't.''
Often the #3 fare for the minibus NIACRO runs to the prison was
possible only once a month, a parcel once in a blue moon. This endless
hassle over money made her wonder if it was worth staying married. ''I
used to say, 'Hang him. He can go on his own. He did not think of me
when he went inside'.'' Loneliness was a huge problem. ''There are two
lonelinesses. There's what you feel when the children have gone to bed.
And there's an awareness of something missing all the time. It's like
the heart is out of the house.''
Local gossip also made her feel vulnerable. When builders on her
estate for whom she had made tea invited her for a drink, as a thank-you
gesture, her husband was informed of the incident in advance of her
visit. Tongues wagged too, about her weekly Saturday night outings with
her sisters, even though she told her husband every detail.
Her two younger children, aged seven and four, did not know the true
reason for Anthony's absence. They saw him once a month and believed him
to be away working. Shortly before his return, however, companions in
the street put them in the picture. Since their last visit had been in
the prison hospital, Irene managed to dismissthe tale.
Dealing with such contingencies gave her a new confidence, made her
independent as never before. And as Anthony's release loomed, the
prospect of being asked where the grocery fund had gone left her feeling
decidedly uneasy. Her daughter voiced her disquiet with: ''We're OK
without him.''
Yet, in spite of misgivings, she went to endless pains to make his
homecoming an occasion. She redecorated the house and for the first week
dished up all manner of tasty meals. She took endless pains with her
appearance. A couple once more, they joined friends for a celebration
drink. They went out for dinner.
But as his presence at home ceased to be a novelty, the problems she
had foreseen became very real. Appalled that the children should get
away with so much, he started to lay down the law. Irene intervened,
arguing as never before.
It became obvious before long that Anthony too had changed. The home
he had been scared he'd lose became his chief preoccupation. He shopped
for bargain food, hoovered, cooked and was head over heels into DIY. In
time he came to defer arguments about the children until they were not
there. Instead of criticising them he started joining in their computer
games. Their marriage, on its last legs before he went in, transformed.
''He is all for the house and the children because I scared the life
out of him when he was in. I am all he has and I hurt him an awful lot
which I regret because he is a good man. I feel more for him now than
ever.''
But if the term in prison has proved the salvation of their marriage,
Irene is adamant that the stakes were higher for her than for Anthony.
''Three youngsters and hardly any money . . . while he got reading his
books. I would not wish it on anybody. I had the thick end of the stick
and he knows it.''

Devotees can now pay tribute to Jean Muir and to Scottish design,
finds FRANCESCA FEARON
ALTHOUGH born in London, Jean Muir, whose father was from Aberdeen,
was especially proud of her Scottish ancestry. The highly regarded
designer whose death two weeks ago saddened the British fashion industry
and all her devoted customers, was throughtout her career a stalwart
supporter of Scotland's design and artistic heritage.
Last October she joined the London committee of the Museum of Scotland
project, helping fundraising for the new museum in Edinburgh. A
tenacious, independent character, dedicated to her craft, she was also
passionately committed to the project. She was working on it just before
she died using her contacts to lend support to the campaign.
Jean Muir's enthusiasm for this new home for Scotland's national
collection is echoed by her husband Harry Leuckert, who has asked that
those wishing to pledge donations in tribute to Jean Muir make them to
the new museum. There a fitting memorial to this great British designer
will be established.
''When asked by friends and colleagues how they could make a permanent
tribute to Miss Muir we all felt that this would have been her wish,''
says Sinty Stemp, the company's spokesperson. ''She had a great love for
Scotland and this would be part of a long lasting tribute.'' The
memorial, itself, has yet to be decided. Miss Muir had at one time
suggested designing an insignia for the museum but it is now thought a
gallery may be named after her. Although this might not necessarily be
for fashion and textiles.
As master of the Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry at the Royal
Society of Arts, she was associated with the engineers, ''because she
always said she 'engineered with fabric', she wanted to contribute to
the wider parameters of design,'' explains Sinty Stemp. Indeed as the
first woman to deliver the Gillies Lecture at the Royal Scottish Academy
last autumn, she spoke on the arts of industry and her enthusiasm for
design in Scotland.
The museum is scheduled to open in 1998 by which time the memorial to
Miss Muir will be decided. The campaign director Dr Sheila Brock,
expressing the committee's loss said ''Miss Muir gave the campaign her
wholehearted support and the immense benefit of her ideas and
experience. Sadly, she will not contribute to our plans or see their
achievement and we, in turn, have been deprived of her flair and
imagination.''

LESLEY DUNCAN reports on the tribute to one woman whose efforts have
extended her family to all creeds from all corners of the globe
IT WAS the morning after the night before and Jean McKechnie's feet
were not yet touching the floor. Yes, there had been a party the
previous evening, but one with a difference. It was to honour Jean
McKechnie on her retirement from her post as senior administrative
officer with Strathclyde Community Relations Council after 24 years'
service.
''It was absolutely unbelievable and the cards are still coming in,''
she reminisces. Strathclyde's Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, Bangladeshi,
Kashmiri, Filipino, Jewish, Irish, Afro-Caribbean, and
South-African-Asian communities had all been represented, as well as
native Scots. There were at least 200 signatures in the visitors' book
-- and that didn't cover everyone at the all-vegetarian feast.
The gifts were also overwhelmed, ranging from bouquets of flowers,
silver candlesticks, jewellery, and a mother-of-pearl picture from the
Chinese community, to testimonials -- including one from the Ethnic
Minority Law Centre and another from the Chilean community, grateful for
the support given to them when they came to Glasgow after the coup in
their country.
But the most spectacular gift of all is a holiday in India and
Pakistan. Jean McKechnie and her husband will spend a week in Delhi in a
four-star hotel before moving on to Lahore where two of the leading
members of Strathclyde's Pakistani community are arranging accommodation
for them in the homes of friends. They will have a car and driver at
their disposal.
It is all most eloquent proof of the affection in which this
bright-eyed, cheerful woman is held. She puts it much more humbly: ''I
have never known anybody to have been so honoured as I've been by so
many people from so many backgrounds.''
She could hardly have forseen her multi-racial involvement when she
went back to work out of interest when her family grew up. Her first job
was with a Church of Scotland Boys' Brigade appeal. Dry rot in her home
then dictated a full-time job. She became the secretary to the senior
official of the then Glasgow Community Relations Council. Things just
progressed from there.
For many years there were just two or three members of staff (they're
still under-resourced says Jean McKechnie) so she was involved in
developmental work within the council, organising projects between 1971
and 1986. These included a residential summer school for Asian teenage
girls at Glasgow School of Art's hostel at Culzean, Ayrshire; community
summer schools in Glasgow where fifth and sixth formers partnered
primary school children, mostly from the ethnic community; a home
tutoring scheme (still ongoing) to try to develop the confidence of
Asian women without spoken English. These were not academic projects,
Mrs McKechnie points out, but there have been academic results.
At a time when there were too few jobs for young teachers being
trained at Jordanhill, Jean McKechnie was seconded one day a week to
help set up English classes throughout Glasgow. As many as 25 teachers
were employed under the Job Creation Scheme and its successor. ''My
responsibility was to assist with training in racial awareness, recruit
pupils, and set up classes,'' she recalls. She has also been involved
with people with special needs in the ethnic community, helping to
establish the ethnic minority carers' group.
Did she foresee an end to discrimination problems? ''Very much so,''
she replies. On the other hand, when she joined the community relations
council 24 years ago she would not have thought there would still be the
need for such an organisation now. In fact there are more cases of
complaints coming to the council than before. The reasons include more
people going to industrial tribunals and people generally having more
confidence.
Jean McKechnie believes that community relations offer ''a learning
experience'' for all the communities -- and that Scots could learn a lot
from ''the extended family'' of Asian society. Her retirement party, she
says, was more like a family gathering.
She has, she says, made ''friends of a lifetime'' through her work,
maybe more indeed from the ethnic community than the indigenous one.
There are bright young faces among the volunteers at the community
relations council's headquarters in Wellington Street, Glasgow.
''Parents are happy for their young to come here,'' says Jean McKechnie.
''They feel it's a protected environment and that the young people are
treated with the respect that's their due.''
She will miss the companionship and stimulus of this environment.
''It's never the right time to leave,'' she says, glancing round her
cluttered office with its touching mementoes of children's art. She has
been asked to set up some kind of consultancy. ''They feel my expertise
could be useful. I'm recognised as fairly objective and honest -- and a
bit tough.''
The last adjective may seem inappropiate for someone who has been
described as ''a much loved auntie'' to Strathclyde's ethnic
communities.

Dance
BY a curious quirk of touring schedules both Northern Ballet Theatre
and Ballet Central were in town at the same time. This meant that those
who had already thrilled to NBT Romeo And Juliet -- utterly absorbing
and dramatic dance, superbly performed at all levels -- could, on
Saturday night, watch the latest crop of hopefuls from the company's
feeder school.
Each year the senior students from Central School Of Ballet in London
go on the road with a programme of short works that reflect the range of
dance styles taught at the school. The upside of this, for audiences, is
the variety. They get to see vignettes of classical ballet, temporary,
jazz and stage, all with an emphasis on showing off technique. The
downside of this is that, in some pieces, the showcase element
predominates and the choreography tends to become little more than
joined-up effects.
The best reason for watching is to spot any up-and-coming talent. Yuko
Okada looks promising. Small, a shade sturdy, she has a very focused
strength in her limbs, and this gives her pointe-work a reassuring
poise, a gloss of maturity.
Among the boys Jonathan Beale showed a distinctive edge, technically
and interpretatively. He has a real feel for the nuances of a role, is
able to answer the music with nicely timed inflections that add flair
and personality to his dance.
Paul Walsh, too, has a pleasing bit of dash about him, and a sense of
humour too. Together, ably partnering Fiona Wallis and Nicola Cross,
they made Kiss Kiss (a Forsythe-type essay in pointe-d high kicks and
cunning contortions) the highlight of the evening.

Theatre
ALTHOUGH there have been several successful versions of Richard III
recently, Brian Cox's excellent staging at the Open Air Theatre,
Regent's Park, for the New Shakespeare Company is something special.
There's a magnificent assumption of the title role by Jasper Britton,
who portrays this double-dyed villain with authority and confidence.
From his first, near-naked appearance from the bowels of the earth, to
his final ignominious exit, Britton is magnetic and horribly alluring.
His wooing of a widow over her husband's death bed seems utterly
convincing.
Anyone who knows Harriet Thorpe only as the manic receptionist in TV's
The Brittas Empire will be impressed by her regal authority as Queen
Elizabeth. Bryan Protheroe's hapless Hastings, Simon Treves's
Buckingham, and Peter de Jersey as both Richmond and Rivers are typical
of the high standard in verse speaking and overall performance in this
well-cast and highly enjoyable production.
Brian Cox's staging is studied with happy touches. He imaginatively
couples the real fading daylight with the darkening on-stage tragedy.
There's grim humour extracted from a bag of strawberries and an
identical bag containing the head of an executed noble. Elsewhere, when
a king dies, the assembled nobles simply reverse their armbands which
are emblazoned on one side with a red rose, on the other a white. The
set is simple and effective -- a gantry in front of a set of metal doors
with a balcony above -- and it is used throughout with imagination in
this fine, fluid and fast moving production.

Theatre
THROWING Einstein, the greatest brain of the western world with
Marilyn Monroe, the then greatest sex symbol (on record as having
Einstein at the top of the list of men she wanted to sleep with) was not
an altogether original idea back in 1982 (Sam Shepard had apparently got
there first) but it was the one that, ironically, set Terry Johnson on
the road to fame.
Fame is the spur and common link in Insignificance as Johnson
playfully teases with four apparently disparate celebrities of the 50s
-- Einstein, Monroe, Monroe's sporting baseball hero husband, Joe
DiMaggio and Senator Joe McCarthy -- in a New York hotel bedroom. Fame,
Johnson suggests, is America's besetting sin -- blinding its citizens to
greater dangers lurking within.
Sadly, not all of Insignificance resonates so strongly. Johnson's own
production, substantially updated to take account of new technological
advances, suffers from its own theory of inertia -- an odd kind of
inactive energy dominates his stage. Frances Barber, looking the
spitting image of Monroe in her Seven-Year Itch white dress, finds
vulnerability and intelligence but little sexual charge, and Ian Hogg
makes a suitably pugilistic hectoring Senator. What raises the piece on
to a different plane is its final moments. Why, Barber's Monroe asks
Alun Armstrong's superbly laconic, grey haired scientist, is he so
afraid to engage with people again? ''I have imagined . . . '' he gasps
with a voice filled with choking awareness and assumed guilt. As Barber
stands with skirt flying and intones an apocalyptic vision of the future
-- people burned in buildings, the buildings themselves left untouched
-- we know scientific imagination has already brought that to pass.

ANGUS FARQUHAR argues it is time for Glasgow to review its civic arts
FIVE years on from Glasgow's reign as European City of Culture and an
equal time before City of Architecture and Design 1999, it is a good
point to question where the civic heart lies. A debate has continued at
times quietly and occasionally raucously about whether we should be
focusing on internal needs or external presence.
One thing Glasgow has never lacked is confidence, and it is this
confidence that has inexorably led to our position as a potentially
great centre of excellence in the European arena. While some view this
to be at the expense of local talent, the reality is a varied, cultured
programme throughout the year which is the envy of nearly every other
city council in Britain.
The large scale work of my company, NVA, could not take place without
a dynamic vision of Glasgow's role as a pacemaker for new developments,
showing the willingness to take risks and have faith in ourselves on a
world stage. It is a confidence that has been hard fought for. The
recent visual arts argument between old and new forms is crucial to
these developments. It is healthy and vital and adds to the feeling that
art is important enough to debate passionately in public. Only by this
process will the wider public be drawn in, to expand the small audiences
which are at the root of the problems art programmers face.
It is my premise that huge audiences and innovative work can go
together in Glasgow. NVA's Stormy Waters, the largest UK performance of
the year, taking place on the Clyde on July 21 and 22, will play to
upwards of four to five thousand people. Some will be attracted by the
sheer spectacle, others by the forefront computer technology, others by
the music. The diversity is what makes it exciting and uniquely
Glaswegian.
In this light it is clear that Mayfest needs some serious scrutiny in
its role as the major public arts festival hosted by the city every
year. The gulf is now too wide between a well-intentioned festival team
and a public reaction of general indifference to its arrival and
departure each Spring, the classic mantra being ''well at least the pubs
open for another hour.''
This year director Paul Bassett was forced into a brutally defensive
position, where upholding local success was pitched against a perceived
lack of credibility on an international level. That the two strands are
seen to be so mutually exclusive lies at the heart of Mayfest's
increasing inability to deliver.
At this point it has gone beyond power programming or another sexy
venue, the heart of Mayfest has gone cold because the vested interests
of its various board members are no longer compatible. Any director
would face the same horrific compromises needed to keep everybody happy!
In simple terms Glasgow has politically and artistically outgrown the
festival. Perhaps it is time to separate the components in much the same
way the Spring Fling and the international festival operate in
Edinburgh.
Although Glasgow still has some of the worst living conditions in
Western Europe, it has changed out of all recognition in the last 15
years. Despite the rigours of Thatcherism, it has proved its ability to
stop the long drain south to London. It feels like a grand arena to
operate within and is attracting a strong calibre of artists who choose
it as home and workplace.
Against this is pitched the Neanderthal position taken by the
licensing board over the club curfew -- the worst case of misplaced
civic angst and police penny-pinching. They have flatly refused to
address Glasgow's position as one of the great night life centres of the
western world. Where is the vision? Where is the trust?
Unbelievably half of these old codgers still talk of ''dancehalls''
and the glory days of the ''nine o'clock curfew''. Is it not time to
sweep the cupboard bare and start again? Instead of tinkering with
outdated structures, we must embrace change and let go of things which
either are not working or frustrate those who do try to work within
unreasonable bounds. Glasgow is once again big enough and confident
enough to face the future and change -- it must not be stopped.
* The issues raised by this article and others which have appeared in
The Herald over the past month will be discussed at an open forum at
Glasgow's Tramway tonight at 6pm.

Music
IN all honesty, it did not look too promising. With a wee hall and big
music -- Copland's thunderous Fanfare for the Common Man at one end, and
Tchaikovsky's volatile Swan Lake at the other, I figured we were in for
a bit of ear damage at last night's inaugural concert of Glasgow's
latest venue, Adelaide's in Bath Street.
And that was the surprise of the night.
While roughly similar in scale to Edinburgh's Queen's Hall, Adelaide's
is a remarkably accommodating space.
Huge impact, of course, from the percussion and brass in the Copland,
and an often overwhelming sound in the Tchaikovsky -- with some very
stylish performances from the ad hoc orchestra, solidly conducted by
Marco Romano -- but what was interesting was what didn't happen to the
sound.
It did not distort, even at peak; and it did not congest. Sometimes,
sure, the mind retreated from the sheer physical size of it. But the
space does not feel confined.
In fact, throughout the big moments of the Tchaikovsky, it was
astonishing how much clarity of texture was retained -- as much to do
with the acoustic as the performance.
And in quieter music -- the gentler pages of Walton's anachronistic
Bach arrangements, and in the lush textures of Vaughan Williams's
Serenade to Music, there is a mellow quality to the sound.
The bass line was a bit thin, but the basses were on the carpet and
under the canopy. The Serenade, with 16 vocalists, was opulently
performed -- quite gorgeous at times.
Adelaide's is unlikely often to feature big music like this, but if
anyone's keen, they shouldn't stint. Good concert, promising start.

Music
JOHN Bevan Baker, who died last year at the age of 68, lived what his
music suggests to have been a peaceful and happy life, much of it
surrounded by a deeply musical family at Fortrose on the Black Isle, but
with episodes in Aberdeen (where for five years he was the City
Carilloneur), Glasgow, and elsewhere.
In a written introduction to yesterday's ''Celebration'' in his
memory, his widow confirmed his music's message, but the eight short
works performed by family and friends really said it all.
Here was a lyricist of a special sort, who could convey his ideas with
simplicity of utterance, in tones that were limpid, concise, but never
cramped.
Each piece was a response to some experience in his life. In his Songs
of Courtship, sung by James Waters and his Consort of Voices, we heard
his lilting reactions to Brahms's Liebeslieder Waltzes and to Arthur
Waley's Aphoristic Chinese translations. In A Song for Kate, nine string
players delicately celebrated the birth of his first grandchild. In a
setting of Dunbar's Rorate Coeli Desuper there were memories of his days
as a bell-ringer.
But the pieces that carried no specific message -- particularly a
fantasy on the note ''A'' for oboe and cello and the eloquent
instrumental eclogue on which he was working at the time of his death --
were no less vivid. Though William Conway, his cellist son-in-law,
played a running role in the concert, there was a haunting performance
also from the violinist, Sarah Bevan Baker, of an airy little solo her
father once wrote for her birthday.

Music
THE spirit of Argentina 1978 is alive and well: the tartan tammies,
saltires, lion rampants and, of course, Rod Stewart. Step into the
stadium and spookily one of the first sights is '78 full back Sandy
Jardine ushering guests from one of the sponsor's lounges.
The late 70s were Rod's halcyon days, his record sales at their peak,
his voice at its best and his youth still enough intact for his macho
swagger to charm its way into the hearts and minds of the tabloids and
public alike.
Saturday's concert at Ibrox encapsulated Stewart's ongoing struggle to
come to terms with age, and more tangibly maturity. Although he looked
alarmingly healthy and was in fine voice it was a schizophrenic,
populist and good-value performance weighing in at 25 songs in two and a
half hours.
The orchestra was a misguided attempt at sophistication, lost in the
stadium acoustics and only audible on the semi-unplugged selections of
Have I Told You Lately and Tom Traubert's Blues.
Elsewhere he is at his most comfortable when revisiting his most
distant past on Every Picture Tells a Story and when duelling with Small
Faces keyboard player, Ian McLagan on Stay With Me. Even on later
material like Hot Legs and You're In My Heart Rod out-lads 90s
pretenders like Liam Gallagher and Shaun Ryder.
Much of the rest is a combination of rock and soul covers from the
Motown and Atlantic vaults: Sweet Soul Music, My Girl, and This Old
Heart of Mine all get an airing -- crowd pleasing, but always the easy
option, rarely testing his voice or the band and almost rivalling his
entire post-1980 output for its sheer insipidness.
The extracts from this period, even his murderous renditions of the
traditional Wild Mountain Thyme and Tom Wait's Downtown Train are turned
in to the type of vacuous stadium anthems that are the sound of a
settled, safe and hugely successful artist resting on the laurels of his
early career.

Clare Henry welcomes an exhibition which samples the legacy of a
cash-starved Glasgow School of Art
NO parties, no banquets, no dancing in the aisles? Glasgow School of
Art, famous the world over, has been slow off the mark in its
celebrations for its 150th anniversary -- not least because it is busy
fighting hard to stay afloat into its 151st year. However it is,
belatedly, planning an exhibition for August -- Seventy-Five Years of
Painting at GSA -- featuring 50 artists.
Meanwhile the ever-enterprising Cyril Gerber has mounted a truly
superb exhibition, Glasgow School of Art, at the Compass Gallery in
Glasgow's West Regent Street till July 1.
It's a last-minute affair, inevitably resulting in an idiosyncratic
selection of 132 pictures by 70 GSA prominent artists from Mary Armour
and Muirhead Bone to EA Walton and Adrian Wiszniewski, but the quality
and range is so good that it almost falls into the category of a museum
show.
Indeed one may ask why on earth the city's Art Gallery and Museums'
section, whose responsibility these things are, did not enter into the
spirit and use some of its #14m budget to mount a major survey GSA
blockbuster at the McLellan? It would certainly have proved very
popular.
In recessionary 1995, exhibition extravaganzas are way down on GSA's
priorities, for the school is in financial crisis. Director Dugald
Cameron is outspoken in his criticism of current Government policy which
is decimating British education. The cumulative effect of 29% funding
cuts over the past five years with a further 9% cut by 1997-8 now places
GSA at risk. This enrages Cameron and he has come out fighting.
''It's outrageous. I wonder how many businesses could be asked to cope
with cuts of over 30% and yet increase their output? Glasgow School of
Art is an institution of excellence and distinction. It is cost
effective, has superb staff and students, and makes a unique
contribution to Scottish industry and Scottish life. So why cut us to
the bone?''
Cameron argues the 1992 educational legislation is disproportionately
harsh on smaller institutions like GSA. ''In a recent White Paper the
Prime Minister emphasised the economic importance of education. Why then
is he withdrawing resources at a criminal rate?
''Meanwhile a 'managerial culture' is taking over. We're been forced
into 27 different layers of bureaucratic quality assessment and quality
audit which is quite unnecessary and a hellish waste of time, effort,
and money. How relevant is it to be spending huge amounts on
bureaucratic assessment which diverts attention from the real business
of teaching students?
'' 'Managerial culture' colours everything, it colours my life and the
students' lives. Now we are told to send distinguished Scottish artists
on management courses! This is ludicrous. We need to be assessed in
artistic terms -- not bean-counting terms! The whole Scottish Office and
Government ethos is self-defeating and counter-productive. I intend to
reverse that and define what real quality is about. Glasgow School of
Art is going to strike back.''
When Cameron took over, GSA was in deficit. This has been turned
around, but new legislation has moved the goalposts so now GSA has many
''extras'' to pay: validation costs, insurance costs, building repairs,
estate refurbishment -- all from a standstill budget of #7.8m.
''Unlike old universities, we have no endowment funds to fall back
on,'' notes Cameron. Thus despite increased student numbers, staff cuts
must follow.
In February the Committee of Scottish Principals issued a highly
critical response to the Government's Review of Higher Education. They
share Cameron's view, arguing for extra funding, and criticising the
lack of investment in education which ''imperils the Scottish economy
itself''.
Meanwhile the Compass's tiny space overflows with an abundance of good
pictures produced in happier times. It is a display which warms the
heart. Many pictures, loaned from private collections, have never been
seen before.
Unusual and memorable images include Mackintosh's beautiful pale-green
watercolour, Grass Hyacinthe 1915, a veritable show-stopper; Ian
Fleming's self-portrait at the age of 22 in 1928; Walton's sun-bleached
landscape; Greiffenhagen's over-the-top Twilight Nymphs -- so different
from his sentimental Bedtime Book; Deville's symbolist Meditation;
Squire's linear Nude; Ken Currie's haunting face; Taylor's majestic
watercolour; McArthur's fantastic piece of draughtsmanship from 1906;
Coia's carton of JD Fergusson; a head by Howson; Pratt's 1928 view of
Kirkcudbright; McCulloch's colourful 1987 Candidates and Fra Newbery's
evocative but mysterious river view of Victorian ladies in big black
hats.
One complaint: women made their mark early at GSA but are still
outnumbered here 15 to 55.
Gerber's list is alphabetical which makes for fascinating
juxtapositions: Byrnes and Percy Bliss (GSA director 1946-64), Jessie
King and Jack Knox, EA Walton 1860-1922 and Alison Watt, a 1987
graduate. This mix is one of the glories of this thoroughly enjoyable
show where some works are for sale and others, tantalisingly, are not.
It was Newbery, represented here by that delicious oil, who got
Mackintosh to design the building which has made Glasgow so renowned,
but it is the graduates and teachers of yesterday and today who make the
School of Art famous worldwide. Let's pray the Government does not
destroy this national treasure.

Their sounds will steal your soul after dark but, as Stephen Fergus
found, by day, Glasgow DJs Harri and Oscar are possessed only by good
intentions and demoniac laugher
SOMETHING dark and loud shifts within a rise and fall of smoke.
Desolate shadows haunt its edges like vague, quick-moving spirits.
Blood-red lights blink off blood-red walls.
As the bank of smoke grows fingers and toes, and stretches like a
vaporous being to consume everything around it, the over-all intention
is clearly one of enticement; of many souls being called out to, darkly.
Loudly.
The blood-red ambience belongs to a Glasgow nightclub called The
Voodoo Room. The dark and loud ''something'' is music: brash, strident
emotions pitched within bitter and calloused rhythms. The shadows are
many dancing figures; tempted and teased into movement by music that
possesses and beguiles, completely.
The two orchestrators -- resident Sunday night DJs Harri and Oscar --
stand tucked away in a booth beyond the fray; from there they control
and feed the atmosphere of the club. Together they are the finest
exponents around of the dark-edged nightclub sounds of deep house and
underground music. Their club mixing has a sublime, near-supernatural
excellence.
Their reputation is steadily growing through their legendary Saturday
nights at The Sub-Club (with DJ Dominic in support), and the
highly-popular Voodoo Room date. And the opportunities for greater
public awareness will increase with their plans to develop their own
recording studio on Glasgow's Drury Street -- to be called,
appropriately, Drury Street Records. So could these men, these purveyors
of dark, deep sounds be demons in disguise? Intent on capturing young
souls and plundering ripe hearts through music? The truth will out.
Daylight; the sun shines, the street surfaces gleam grey and dry. The
interview is conducted in an Italian cafe close to The Voodoo Room.
Harri and Oscar both drink cappuccinos. They seem normal. Seem normal.
No vampiric eye-shades, no leathery, sallow skin.
Harri is keen to tell me about the future of clubbing. ''Tartan
hoose,'' he proclaims in a crisp Glasgow accent, and laughs. Oscar
laughs too. What? Tartan house music? My suspicions were right: they're
not normal. ''Aye, or Highland hoose!'' Harri starts to quietly sing
some Scottish folk creation, imagining it performed to a house beat.
''Or what about drinking house, music to get drunk to,'' Oscar adds.
Thankfully, mercifully, they're joking. Devils? Little devils,
definitely.
It becomes quickly apparent that in one important respect Harri and
Oscar are very like the music they play and create. It is a subverting
of expectations to find that the DJs who play the brooding, tough music
of deep house are themselves playful, affable, and without apparent
duplicity. And their key strength as DJs is an ability to subvert the
expectations of clubbers: to lead the mind into unfamiliar, though
up-lifting areas. In short, to chart new ground, while at the same time
giving the crowd exactly what they want: pleasure.
''I think we're pretty versatile,'' says Harri. ''At The Sub-Club we
play more experimental music than at The Voodoo Room, which is a lighter
side of deep house. But one week the music we play will be particularly
hard, but then subconsciously we change it, because we never want to
stay a constant, we never want to be boring.''
There have been changes too in the other lives of Harri and Oscar
beyond the turn-tables. Harri spent six years working in the oil
industry in Aberdeen and building up his record collection. He DJ-ed for
the first time at his girlfriend's 21st birthday party, and gradually
worked his way up to the ranks of The Sub-Club DJs, where he teamed up
with Oscar. For his part Oscar kicked things off at The Rock Garden in
Glasgow until the rave explosion of the late '80s. ''I went from playing
the Rolling Stones and the Doors to playing acid-house records
practically overnight,'' he says. Oscar eventually found himself at The
Sub-Club, too, and the partnership was gradually formed. Nowadays, a
family cafe-business takes up his days.
Both have witnessed the rise of DJ culture at first hand; from the DJ
being regarded as a frustrated ''wannabe'' musician, to creators of vast
conglomerates of sound: artists in their own right. Being a part of the
transition has left them level-headed, and thankful, for the much-envied
position they now find themselves in.
''There has been an element of luck and good-timing to our success,''
says Harri. ''Most DJs don't get the opportunity to have two residencies
at two clubs every week the way we do.''
Harri has a new Friday night residency under his belt at a club on
Oxford Street in London. ''I think the club's called Plastik People. I'm
not too sure,'' Harri laughs. ''I know it's on Oxford Street. I've seen
flyers for it, but they always seem to say a different name.'' An
overly-ambitious mind would not only know the name of the club but
clubber-capacity and nightly-takings too.
So Harri, Oscar and Dominic's designs on the recording industry do not
seem part of a bigger world domination plan. Far from it, in fact.
''It's not that we want to become mega-rich,'' Harri declares, ''it's
just that we want to do things our way. We want to create something with
a bit more longevity than house music, and to have an album, and maybe a
live band, is something I think the three of us would like to see.
Ironically, house music is something I listen to very little at home. I
like Chris de Burgh, Phil Collins, Gloria Estefan -- all the greats.''
Once again -- to the relief of a nation -- Harri is joking. Not de
Burgh but the hip-hop sounds of Dr Dre are closer to his heart.
It would seem then that for all the depth, darkness and potency in the
sounds Harri and Oscar mix there is something else alive in the rough
and tumble of dry-ice. Yet no need to worry, it's just humanity,
normality and the love of good music. So, if you're not a regular at The
Sub-Club or The Voodoo Room, you can rest safe in your bed at night. The
world is not under threat.

FAMILY discussions concerning the venue for a day out can lead to
battles of epic proportions, but the planning of a successful trip need
not lead to tears.
Arrangements can be made quickly and easily by choosing a location not
too far from home. One with good transport links and attractions for
every member of the family to genuinely enjoy, rather than suffer in
silence.
Along the sweep of the Ayrshire coast, you will find that these points
are well-covered and more -- with a rich history, sport for all and
memories of its own world-famous son.
Whether you choose to take the car or start your day out at the
railway station, most of Ayrshire's beauty can be reached within an hour
from central Scotland. It's worth enquiring about ''Day Tripper'' or
other family tickets before you leave. Cutting the transport costs will
leave more spending money for the excellent shopping, food and
attractions awaiting you and the family at the end of your journey.
The sights and traditions of Ayrshire have been joined through the
ages by purpose-built parks and recreational facilities which take
advantage of the area's natural beauty.
That beauty was an inspiration to its most famous son, Robert Burns.
Travel down to Alloway, just south of Ayr, and it's impossible not to be
swept up in the romance and intrigue of the poet's life in the region.
Visit the Tam O'Shanter experience, which transports the visitor to
eighteenth-century Ayr, then soak in more of the atmosphere with a trip
to the Burns Cottage and the many other monuments and memorials
throughout Ayrshire which keep the memory of a Scot whose own day is
celebrated around the world.
In 1996, however, he will have his own year, with the Burns '96
International Festival, a year-long programme of Scottish culture and
events commemorating the bicentenary of the poet's death.
If your idea of poetry in motion during a day out is a round which
comes in below par and finishes with a toast at the 19th hole, the
Ayrshire coast has many enjoyable days ahead. With names like Royal
Troon and Prestwick just a taster of a long list, the area is a must for
any golf enthusiast. Troon and Ayr both have three municipal golf
courses, including the popular Belleisle in Ayr.
It's not only Ayrshire's wide expanses of green which welcome sporting
enthusiasts, the many rivers provide great sport for anglers. As well as
the rivers, there are lochs and reservoirs, some with boat hire and many
stocked with brown and rainbow trout. The tourist office can give advice
on angling permits and course tickets.
Family days out may need to be a little more active, however, and
stepping up the pace is easy with a visit to one of the area's amusement
parks, Wonderwest in Ayr and the new Loudoun Castle Park are both in
easy reach. Children can enjoy the rides or be thrown around in swimming
pools where the surf has a life of its own thanks to wave machines and
chutes.
Everyone will get hungry at some point during the day and there are
eating places to satisfy all palates and pockets. Try some of the area's
specialities, such as delicious bacon, cheeses, potatoes, and fresh
seafood. It's worth buying a few samples to take home. No-one should
visit Largs without sampling the exquisite ice-cream.
If a day out means nothing more than hitting the shops with chequebook
at the ready, Ayrshire has modern shopping malls and attractive
pedestrian-friendly streets which house the superb mixture of leading
chain stores and small family businesses which give each town its
individual flavour.
There are a wealth of specialist businesses all along the coast.
Bargain hunters will enjoy the excellent value of woollens at mill shops
and will find it difficult to resist the delicate local lace.
Most visitors will take something home as a memento, and those coming
back from Ayrshire may find themselves laden down with more than just a
small reminder of a day out. The area is a haven of arts and crafts,
with hand-crafted pottery at Ballantrae, Girvan, and Millport, woollen
and textiles throughout the district, stained glass at Prestwick,
jewellery and model making in Ayr, tapestry and even decorated goose
eggs at Girvan.
Ayrshire's parks and gardens give the weary visitor the chance to take
a breather from the bustle. Even the major towns have peaceful green
corners -- Annanhill Gardens in Kilmarnock for example. Ayr has Rozelle
House and the Belleisle Estate, which offers not only shrubs, flowers,
and neat gardens but a deer park. Douglas Park and Anderson Park are
just two places to relax in Largs.
Country parks are a day out in themselves and Ayrshire has these in
abundance. Eglinton Park, between Kilwinning and Irvine, has formal
gardens and more relaxed areas, while Culzean has splashes of dazzling
colour to add to the castle, nature trails and swan pond. Just outside
Largs, Kelburn Country Park has a walled garden for restful moments and
a Secret Garden that few children will be disappointed in.
Children will also enjoy the rugged activities at Blackshaw Farm Park
and the Heads of Ayr Farm Park, where there is much more on offer than
simply meeting the animals. This in itself is an unforgettable
experience to many town children.
Those with a relatively short journey home can round off a busy day
with an evening of entertainment -- theatres in Ayrshire have always
offered holiday makers a choice of drama, music, and variety. The Palace
in Kilmarnock, Ayr's Gaiety Theatre, and the Borderline which is home of
the town's own theatre company, are a few of the popular venues to look
out for.
Ayrshire can offer an unforgettable day out, there's so much to see
and do that your first visit will never be your last. More information
from the Ayrshire Tourist Board on 01292 262555.

THE PATH TO POWER, By Margaret Thatcher, HarperCollins: #25
MARGARET THATCHER was Tory leader for 15 years, 11 and a half of which
she was Prime Minister. She quickly came to dominate British political
life after displacing Ted Heath in 1975 and certainly moved the whole
ground of debate and action. She rejected the post-war consensus,
believing that it was steadily moving our society in a collectivist
direction, and substituted her own convictions. As she put it in Cardiff
during the 1979 election campaign: ''The Old Testament prophets did not
merely say: Brothers I want consensus. They said, this is my faith and
vision. This is what I passionately believe. If you believe it too, then
come with me.''
It is not the least measure of her domestic success that that vision
has, ironically, become something of a new consensus. Buyers of council
houses will not have them repossessed by a future Labour Government; nor
would such a body change her industrial relations legislation which
ended a disgraceful period in trade union history. Nothing will be
renationalised.
Of course it is true that many hate her still, especially those whom
she, mere woman, beat at their own game but that is no guide: according
to Morley, his first biographer, Gladstone was so hated that he was
unwelcome in half the houses in London. That is the price great
political figures have to pay -- it may even be some indication of their
significance. We know now that Gladstone was an immense figure. It is
not necessary to insist on many parallels between them, though there are
some, to suggest that Thatcher too will get a good report.
This volume of autobiography, which describes her upbringing,
education, and deliberate ascent of the greasy pole, is an improvement
on its predecessor which dealt with her time in office, a strange order
of appearance explained by financial considerations. The tone is modest,
and the prose straightforward rather than rhetorical. She is, mostly,
kind to her internal party enemies and will seem especially so with
respect to Ted Heath whom she tried hard to placate after she replaced
him. Even allowing for the special justificatory nature of any
autobiography, she does emerge as a far more sympathetic and sensitive
person than mythology would normally allow.
Her origins in Grantham are well known but her upbringing was
relatively obscure. Plenty of commentators have sought to denigrate her
by insisting that she had time only for her father, Alfred Roberts, the
grocer and small-town politician who shaped much of her thinking. He was
a great influence but this work also does justice to his wife and her
vital contribution to what was a successful family which had to practise
the economy the daughter was later to preach. They built their business
on savings and borrowings (mortgages), facts which help to explain
Thatcher's later enthusiasm for those means of self improvement.
Early bitten by the political bug -- even her favourite poets, Kipling
and, more interestingly, Whitman, had a political flavour -- Thatcher
used her time at university in the early 1940s to engage in constant
political activity. It was always of a true-blue kind. She read
chemistry at Oxford; and later law in London, but there is never much
evidence that either of these disciplines really excited her imagination
the way politics did. Although she read some left-wing works, by the
likes of John Strachey, for example, she was completely unaffected. She
was influenced by a few left-wing people, deeply and notably by Alfred
Sherman, a former communist; less so by Arthur Koestler, also a one-time
communist, and Lord George Brown, the former deputy leader of the Labour
Party -- but in all cases only after they had changed their own minds
about the nature of socialism.
Thatcher was deeply influenced by von Hayek, the Austrian libertarian,
but really only after coming close to Keith Joseph. She dedicates this
book to Joseph, rightly since not only did he provide much of the
philosophical under-pinning of her ideas, he propelled her into the
leadership race in 1975 when his own outspoken statement of some of his
opinions appeared to disqualify him from challenging Heath successfully.
That she was in a position to make any kind of challenge herself was
remarkable. She was a woman; and there had never before been a woman
leader of a political party. Secondly, she had held none of the great
offices of state, nor been anything in the party hierarchy; nor was she
part of the Tory establishment (not even by marriage).
After contesting a safe Labour seat in 1950, she had been elected for
Finchley in 1959 and been given a junior post at the Ministry of
Pensions by Harold Macmillan a year later. Ted Heath made her Minister
of Education in 1970, though she suspected that she may have been
something of a token woman at that stage.
She gives the impression that these appointments curbed her style and
forced her to policy decisions she was later to regret. Her experience
in the Heath Government may well have been characterised by doubt and
internal opposition, but in practice she had little choice but to
conform since his views developed inways very different from her own.
It is in the nature of politics for its practitioners to have to bite
their lip often -- or resign. To resign is to abandon all influence.
Thatcher bit her lip. She did not, however, demolish the grammar schools
-- indeed she claims to have saved as many as she could -- but presided
over a time when their destruction was encompassed by the widely
prevalent views about egalitarian education and the powers given to
local authorities to decide on the nature of their educational
provision. The difference between her role and that of Tony Crosland,
say, who positively sought their destruction, is obvious.
Whatever the extent to which her real views were suppressed by the
demands of office, and Heath's famous U-turns, she laid her future on
the line when she decided to challange him. She knew that failure would
entail the end of her political ambitions. Heath was not the forgiving
kind -- as events were to prove. She would have deferred to Edward Du
Cann but he eventually decided he could not run. This freed his friend
Airy Neave to manage Thatcher's campaign which he did with considerable
verve. The description of this campaign is enthralling for anyone
interested in politics.
Thatcher is a complex personality -- very much a romantic, but
over-logical and literal, as she admits. Her ambition was never in doubt
though the extent of its achievement probably surprised herself.
She was greatly helped by her husband, who saw her qualities smartly.
These include courage and determination, though she was also cautious
and well able to identify and capitalise on the political mood.
Sometimes her qualities degenerated into stubbornness and disrespect for
others. Her drawback as a party manager was that she could not see the
need for her party to remain a broad church: her tendency was to make it
a sect. She had to deal with many who did not support her both in
Opposition and in Government where her Cabinets were full of sceptics.
She did not handle them well, the fact which eventually brought her
down. She did do some immensely valuable things which many knew were
necessary but no-one else had the courage to begin.

SOMEWHERE in the bowels of the MoD lives the person or committee of
persons who came up with the ingenious wheeze in the first place. How
would it be, he she or they pondered, probably in the course of a
lengthy memo, if we could presume that our personnel who died in the
Chinook helicopter crash were killed while actually engaged in a civil
rather than military transportation? That way any compensation would
have an in-built cash limit. Gosh the Treasury would be pleased. And if
those pinko troublemakers in the media tried to make something of it, we
could exercise a shrewd spot of damage limitation by bringing out the
report on the crash and our proposals for settling claims on the same
day.
Thankfully somebody somewhere, perhaps even within the same Ministry,
was sufficiently appalled by the sheer crass insensitivity of this
strategy, not even to mention its inherent injustice, to inform the
legal team acting for the widows and families of the 29 people who died
on the Mull of Kintyre this time last year just what dastardly work was
afoot.
The report on the crash, as it happens, has been available these many
weeks.
According to the MoD, its release was delayed out of respect for the
fact that the bereaved were travelling to the crash site for a memorial
service, and publication before that would be inappropriate. A more
cynical view is that the MoD knew full well what the reaction to their
proposals would be, and couldn't risk the chance that the act of
remembrance would turn into a public protest.
In the event public censure came their way anyway, the lawyers
concerned indulging in the time-honoured business of retaliating first.
In uncovering this seedy tactic they hope at best to embarrass the
Ministry into changing its plans, and at worst to gather support for
their campaign to have the families treated honourably.
But then honour is not a commodity with which very many Government
departments seem over-burdened these days. To stick with the MoD for a
moment, you may also recall some other television footage starring the
men from that Ministry last week.
The Defence Select Committee was taking evidence on the refusal to pay
men and women suffering from what has come to be known as Gulf War
Syndrome any kind of compensation for illnesses they contracted when
involved at the MoD's behest in that conflict.
One of the things which emerged from that bout of interrogation is
that the MoD seem to have given the task of establishing whether or not
there is such a syndrome to one single medic. Even if he had an entirely
free hand to come up with an honest and unfettered judgment, he's hardly
in a position to make a thorough investigation of hundreds of different
cases involving different symptoms and different degrees of severity.
Imagine if you were one of the other witnesses at that hearing.
Imagine if you were that once-superfit young man who went off to the
Gulf in his country's uniform a few short years ago, and is now
compelled to give evidence to the committee from a wheelchair, using a
computerised aid to speak. Imagine how that man felt when the man from
the Ministry turned semantic cartwheels trying to suggest that while he
had got sick since the Gulf, he wasn't necessarily sick because of it.
The evidence of a variety of debilitating symptoms, some apparently
caused by the cocktail of injections given to departing forces, some
perhaps due to chemicals inhaled during the conflict, is as compelling
as it is overwhelming.
Even the Pentagon, after a hesitant start, has now accepted that it
must take responsibility for the ill health of the men and women much
lauded at the time as the heart and soul of the Desert Storm campaign.
Yet here in bravehearted Britain our Ministry wriggles and twists and
still reserves all its ingenuity for dreaming up ways of cheating its
own employees of natural justice. Many of the people we sent to the Gulf
were not even professionals. One of the main field hospital teams was
supplied by the Territorials whose medical team decided that was where
their duty lay. If only the MoD could recognise its duty with the same
instinctive ease.
If you were brass necked enough you could argue that the Terries were
volunteers in the strict sense of the word, since they had a choice
whether or not to serve in a war zone.
The people who crashed in Kintyre mist knew no such flexibility. Some
of them were involved in intelligence work before the Irish conflict
began. All of them put their lives on the line daily since the nature of
their trade made them very particular targets. All of them lived
restricted lives as a result, as did their families who had not signed
up for a life in which fear and foreboding were all too regular
ingredients.
And now that these fears have been realised, albeit as the result of a
tragic accident, their dedication is worth more than a few hymns on a
hillside, a note from the boss, and the minimum legal redress the
Ministry thinks it can get away with.
In any event, it's our money they're trying to save. The taxpayer will
foot the bill for compensation and I don't see a four-deep queue of
voters lining up to complain. This week it was also estimated that it
might cost  taxpayers as much as a million pounds to pay for private
legal advice to those Ministers who might be censured by the Scott
inquiry. Given the choice would you rather distribute large cheques to
Chinook widows and Gulf veterans or to swell the coffers of Sue Grabbit
and Runne as they connive to keep Ministerial necks out of nooses?
Answers on a postcard please to the Chancellor. But better be quick
about it. Mr Clarke's is one of the necks in question.

WE don't know if John Major is as blase privately as Julius Caesar was
publicly about warnings of impending disaster. But it does not require a
soothsayer to notice that the tides of various public events are running
against him and may well reach full round about the moment that
Conservative MPs will have what must be their last chance to get rid of
him as they ruthlessly did with Mrs Thatcher in 1990.
There must be a General Election by April 1997 and disposing of the
leader at the very last moment, November 1996, would be too public a
signal of the desperation the party is already feeling privately. In any
event, unlikely as it seems at the moment, Mr Major might find some
compelling reason to go to the country in October 1996 pre-empting a
leadership contest. No. If the knives are to come out this autumn is the
time.
There are still some Tory MPs who mutter along the lines of Oscar
Wilde ''To lose one Prime Minister may be regarded as a misfortune; to
lose two looks like carelessness''. Or even worse. Even done 18 months
before the positively last election date won't it look like panic?
Well, it will look like panic and, indeed, would be so but with an
Opposition currently 39% ahead of you led by a man voters find to be the
most attractive holder of his position since polling began, panic would
seem a natural reaction. As in other cases it is how sensibly one deals
with one's panic that counts.
Mr Major, not surprisingly, believes his party can still pull itself
together. A couple of good Budgets, a somewhat nationalistic approach to
European diplomacy, hard detailed questions about what Labour actually
plan to do about this and that will win back some lost sheep and he,
like Labour, knows that the opinion polls underestimate the number of
voters who, on the day, will turn out for the Conservatives.
The question the Conservative MPs will have to pronounce on when they
return after the summer hols and a party conference that could well be
highly significant, is whether that scenario still sounds plausible to
them. If Labour are still 30-plus points ahead or, not impossibly
40-plus, it may well not.
There is the fear that simply by his presence Mr Blair is going to
make the next election more presidential in style and the current polls
show that, on that yardstick, Mr Major trails badly. Certainly the polls
don't show any other Tory contender doing much better or as well, but
when someone else, Heseltine, Portillo, or Clarke, actually takes over
that could change.
Nor is it possible to ignore the effect on Mr Major's standing of the
operations of the two committees of inquiry he has set up. Nolan looks
likely to end MPs making large sums of money from consultancy work
without declaring it, something some might find embarrassing to do.
Scott, although it is Ministers and civil servants he threatens
directly, has outraged many Tory MPs by the way the inquiry was set up
in the first place.
Few now think Sir Richard the ideal judge for the job and many recall
nostalgically how, when faced with a similarly tricky inquiry into the
Government's role in perhaps encouraging by neglect the Argentinain
invasion of the Falklands, Mrs Thatcher stuffed that committee with
experienced Privy Councillors, men who had been in government, knew how
it worked, and were prepared to make allowances. This is not necessarily
to deny that Sir Richard is a White Knight who will slay the dragons of
manoeuvring, secrecy, and economy with the truth which inhabits
Whitehall. But, right or not, he is making the Government look bad and
the back benchers wish it had been done differently.
Mr Major must be hoping that the judge will not be any better at
meeting his latest provisional target for producing his report --
September -- than he has been about hitting earlier ones. It is really
too near to November.
The Prime Minister has also reactivated thoughts that he is
gaffe-prone by his historical dissertation on house-buying in the 80s to
a group of businessmen while the television cameras whirred. As a
description of what happened, which is all his aides say it was, it was
accurate enough. But not to realise that it could be taken as criticism
of the house buyers (some of whom deserved it) and that the Government's
role in encouraging the speculation would not pass unremarked was
astonishingly naive.
Although sounding more Euro sceptical by the week, Mr Major is not
making many converts among the Euro sceptics who know that both internal
party politics and the Opposition's stance are driving him to it and
suspect that, if he were to win the election, being ''at the heart of
Europe'' could reappear on his menu.
The party conference in October could be crucial. If Mr Major and his
team flop before what is going to be a very worried audience, the word
is going to go out to the MPs, as it did after the second election
defeat in 1974, that ''something must be done''.
There is another consideration. the back-room but extremely
influential senior members of the National Union of the Conservative and
Unionist Party must already be deeply concerned that it could be heading
for a drubbing under whatever leader. To the men and women who have the
long-term future of the party as their responsibility a potent factor
could be the size of the drubbing. To come back with 270 MPs would be
bad; to have under 220 would be a disaster raising the spectre of nearly
a decade out of office, even more unappetising to Tories than to Labour.
By the autumn they may be looking for the person most likely to limit
the damage.
Mr Major, a more modest person than Shakespeare's Caesar, is unlikely
to echo his line ''I do know but one that unassailable holds on his
rank''. Given the modern political connotations of ''unassailable'' it
would be regarded almost as a career death wish if he did. But he must
be aware that in the ranks of the 1922 Committee are those already
thinking how they might adapt Brutus's apologia -- ''Not that I liked
Major less but that I love the Conservative Party more'' perhaps.

TO Blighty from Brussels last week. It was an introduction to the
Eurostar train and the Channel Tunnel -- and a what superb service it
is.
This is the way to travel between London and the capital of Europe --
or Paris for that matter -- and it sure puts Londoners at a big
advantage over the rest of the UK. No hanging around airports, no long
tube journeys or huge taxi bills at both ends.
I did the return trip for about #100 on a routine cheap fare. Every
passenger receives a free Eurostar visitor's guide to London. You begin
to see why the South-east of England is so excited at the potential for
business and tourism. The booklet is packed with maps, information about
markets, fashion stores, tourist attractions, museums, fairs, hotels,
and restaurants -- almost exclusively in the Home Counties.
In all of its 84 pages there is, as far as I can see, only one
paragraph on Scotland. It is accompanied by a picture of Edinburgh
Castle and a tiny advertisement from the Scottish Tourist Board. You
cannot blame the South-east for exploiting the Eurostar and the tunnel
but it is undeniably a commercial weapon against the rest of the UK.
The fact that continuing the train ride north from London is too
complicated to be practical must trouble our tourist industry as it
competes for the business being brought to the South-east from the
Continent. Eurostar promises that from next year night services to
Glasgow and elsewhere in Britain will offer a ''comfortable, convenient,
and time-effective way to travel overnight between Continental Europe
and the UK.'' Well, we shall see.
Much as I prefer travelling by train to driving, there is no question
that going by rail from Brussels to London and then humphing luggage
across the city to another railway station for four or five hours more
of rattling up to Scotland is not exactly an inviting prospect. We need
a service which links Scotland directly with the tunnel, skipping London
if possible, or at least not involving a change of station.
Scotland already suffers from not having a direct ferry link with the
big Continental sea ports. Continental tourists heading for Scotland
mostly use Hull but they get picked off on the way north in Yorkshire
and the Dales. Now Scotland's ferry problem in the north is being
compounded by the railway in the south.
Flying is, therefore, the enforced option. But the idea of
liberalisation bringing cheaper fares is not working on the
Brussels-Scotland routes. British Airways and British Midland appear
uninterested in competing with Sabena because the direct routes are
regarded as not worth the effort.
But back to London. Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor, was
giving a grand party in his residence -- with a sweeping view of the
Thames -- for the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. He had around
him an impressive gathering of the great and the good from all political
parties.
To Brussels eyes it was amusing to see Europhiles and Europhobes
alike, all united briefly by one subject on which they can for once
agree, and convivially sipping champagne.
The Eurosceptic Labour veteran Peter Shore chatted with the Europhile
Lord Jenkins. Pro-European Mrs Margaret Ewing of the SNP rubbed
shoulders with Sir George Gardiner, the anti-European ex-rebel Tory,
before joining Roseanna Cunningham from Perth and Kinross for a
by-election celebration dinner.
A smattering of English judges including Lord Nolan, whom MPs greet
with new respect these days, were on hand along with Labour's Shadow
Scottish Secretary, George Robertson, a WFD founder, Menzies Campbell,
and Sir David Steel.
The Speaker, Mrs Betty Boothroyd, turned up for what was, for her, a
rare visit to the Lords and she received a special welcome. ''Normally,
it is we who tend to visit her end of the building,'' Lord Mackay
remarked.
The WFD was set up by Royal Prerogative three years ago to provide
practical help in promoting democracy and pluralistic institutions
overseas. It funds, for example, women's organisations in Kenya,
integrationist groups in South Africa and, increasingly, a whole series
of good causes in the newly independent eastern European states. It does
not duplicate the work of others and ignores organisations which favour
the use of force.
Last year it distributed more than #2m worth of help, mostly paid for
by the Foreign Office and big business, and this spending is expected to
rise annually. Those who benefit are voters with newly democratic
election systems, parliaments, political parties, independent media,
trade unions, and human rights groups. A good cause, indeed.
At Waterloo next day it came time to board the Eurostar for the return
journey. It slid silently out of London only to come to an irritating
halt for no apparent reason. ''A red light,'' was the only explanation.
After half an hour or so we enjoyed what ex-President Mitterrand
described as a ''pleasant run in the English countryside'' to Dover and
moved back through the tunnel. On the way from Calais to Lille we were
told by an official announcement that we had reached 300 kilometres an
hour. It felt much less. The crawl was resumed in Belgium on the journey
from Lille to Brussels.
Back at Gare du Midi in Brussels it was time to be reminded that
Britain is semi-detached from EU immigration policy. We are not
signatories of the Schengen agreement which removed internal borders for
most EU states. This means Eurostar passengers must still queue to show
passports in Belgium.
The process did not take long but it was annoying. It does nothing for
British Government popularity in Brussels. My colleagues who use the
Eurostar regularly tell me the process can sometimes take 30 minutes
which makes something of a nonsense of fast travel.
British Tory Euro-MPs who wanted Britain in Schengen promised to kick
up a fuss if they found signs of nationals from non-Schengen member
states being messed about. Their time could be coming. But rather than
taking issue with Belgium and others they would be better advised having
a word with their own leadership.

WELCOME to the land of lost content.
Inhabited by the children of the 1950s baby boom who grew up to be
eager home owners. Who were brought up on the idea of bricks and mortar
as the essential repository of personal wealth. Who were persuaded to
acquire pride of ownership, double glazing and an asset to pass on to
the next generation.
Welcome, but watch your step. The natives are bewildered and hostile
and looking for an escape.
In Scotland, according to the Woolwich Building Society, negative
equity --where the house is worth less than the mortgage -- ceased to
exist in 1993. That may be so. But those who work in the housing market
will point to families trapped in houses with values which -- if they
can sell -- will barely cover their costs when the mortgage is repaid.
''People pay a premium to buy a new house,'' says George Scott,
property manager with Erskine Macaskill in Edinburgh who is refreshingly
honest about what is happening in the housing market where talking-up is
the natural vocabulary.
''The newer properties are very slow to shift. There are not enough
buyers for what's on the market. There's also a marked reduction in the
numbers of first-time buyers coming through our doors. It may be they
are going for new houses, where builders are offering packages. But I
suspect they just don't have the confidence to buy now,'' he says.
Scottish Office figures show that 1994 was a record year for house
building, with new starts of 18,460, 92% in the private sector which
shows confidence amongst house builders, if amongst few others in the
market. But according to analysts, sales of new houses are at the
expense of older properties, and do not necessarily reflect an increased
market for house sales.
In Aberdeen, solicitor David Coull said an increase in new properties
on the market had depressed sales on older properties: ''We've passed
the main busy period of the year and there has been no improvement. We
don't expect any significant improvement later in the year.''
Avril Hyslop, a property manager with Edinburgh-based Connor Malcolm,
is trying to sell a small house on a new estate in the east of the city,
one of a number of similar properties vying for the attentions of picky
buyers.
The owner is offering #1000 in DIY vouchers to a buyer: ''It's not
something we do often but when you're trying to catch people's eye to
come and have a look at a property, it's worth a try. We've had similar
things in the past -- the offer of time-share holidays in Marbella for a
sale. Sometimes it works, especially if there are a lot of similar
houses for sale in the same area.''
She too has found that the houses which are difficult to shift are the
relatively new properties where people have paid a premium to buy them
as new. Older more traditonal properties, such as flats in Marchmont,
continue to sell.
Disenchantment is the way Rose Scott describes her feelings with the
housing market. Her husband, a police officer, has been promoted to the
Borders. They have bought a house in their new home town and they have
been trying to sell her large bungalow in Duddingston View in Edinburgh
at a fixed price of #130,000. It is newly converted, with a cast iron
bath, new carpets, a walled garden. Yet she has hardly seen a potential
buyer.
''The few who've come, I suspect, were not serious. They just came for
a nosey around.
''I send the children to my mum's every Sunday and just sit here
waiting for people who never come. It's distressing not even getting
people over the door. I feel like I'm living in limbo. People just don't
seem to be buying at our end of the market.''
When the couple decided to sell their last house three years ago, Rose
scribbled a For Sale sign on a piece of wallpaper and hung it in the
window. It was sold that afternoon.
''Something is wrong, something is very wrong with the housing market.
We just feel bewildered, wondering what is going on. It's living with
the uncertainty that is the worst part. Between one life and another,
that's how we feel.''
Figures from the Department of Environment show that the disparity
between prices in Scotland the UK has lessened markedly since 1990,
particularly in more expensive properties. Across all property types,
prices in Scotland have advanced from less than two-thirds of the UK
average in the late eighties to about 80%. The price of bungalows in
Scotland actually overtook those elsewhere in the UK in 1994.
Many of those who cannot sell are turning to renting out their homes
as the only option left open to them. Maureen Lynch, of Jenners'
Property, says there has been an increase over the past eighteen months
in people with bigger houses who have been unable to find a buyer and
who are turning their properties over for rental.
She added: ''I think it's fairly new. People would rather sell than
rent out their home. But many are moving to jobs elsewhere and have no
choice but to rent them out when nobody buys.''
There is one piece of good news amidst the gloom though. The number of
repossessions in Scotland last year fell from 2330 to 1791 -- that's
0.22% of outstanding mortgages -- less than half the national average.
But don't bother telling that to families whoi cannot sell a house.
For them the pain of experience feels more real than all the hype and
the handwringing and the tantalising promised wheezes of kick-starts and
quick fixes to get the market moving again.
Anyway they have heard it all before. It won't make them feel any
better. Only a sale will do that.

Ankara, Sunday
A TURKISH Cabinet Minister has apologised for a statement describing
as prostitutes three visiting women MEPs.
State Minister Ayvaz Gokdemir denied he had used the phrase
specifically over the three, who included Pauline Green, MEP for North
London and leader of the Socialist group in the European Parliament.
The women had demanded the release of jailed Kurdish MPs during a
recent visit to Ankara.
Gokdemir had been quoted as saying: ''We are not going to release
these traitors (Kurdish MPs) for the sake of the prostitutes of Europe
who have come to us.''
Today he said: ''I have made no remarks targeting the persons of
Pauline Green, Claudia Roth, and Catherine Lalumiere . . .
However, I regret that they have taken offence at a warped report of
my words.
''I apologise for this misunderstanding if it will assuage their
feelings,'' he added.
However he said Turks reacted to ''certain people who questioned
Turkey as if it was a suspect and themselves behaved like an
inspector''.
The statement brought demands in the Turkish press for his resignation
and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller wrote to the MEPs to apologise for the
incident.
Ankara, whose ties with the EU have been strained over its treatment
of Kurds, is seeking to avoid further upsets ahead of a coveted Customs
union due to take effect from January.
Meanwhile, Turkish Cobra helicopter gunships today bombed rebel
positions on the third day of a major assault against Kurdish rebels in
Tunceli province.
The Interior Ministry said that 141 rebels had been killed in the past
10 days in the region, scene of a 10-year separatist
insurgency.--Reuter.

Moscow, Sunday
SIX months to the day since Moscow sent troops and armour into
breakaway Chechnya, its rebel leader said that Russia would ''burn in
hell'' for the bloody campaign.
''The next step is that Russia is to burn in hell. We have had enough
of infanticide, blood being spilled on our land,'' said Dzhokhar
Dudayev.
''Russian statehood must be destroyed and instead of the two-headed
eagle, Russia will have to acquire a white dove once again,'' he said,
referring to the national emblem.
Thousands of civilians, Russian soldiers, and rebels have been killed
in Moscow's biggest military campaign since the 10-year Afghan war.
Tass last week reported that Dudayev had rejected a demand by his
field commanders to spread the war into the rest of Russia, but his
comments today seemed to indicate he may be hardening his position.
It is not clear how much more time the Chechen leader has left to
organise his forces, now fighting a rearguard action from four encircled
regions in the mountainous south after Moscow's troops swept the
lowlands of rebels.
However in defiant mood he said: ''Our position is excellent, I assure
you. Never before in my life have I been as satisfied as I am
now.''--Reuter.

Johannesburg, Sunday
ZULU Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi today told his followers to launch a
non-violent protest campaign against the South African Government in
which he is a minister.
''Let us show South Africa what true peaceful resistance entails and
what massive mass resistance on a scale unprecedented in this country
can achieve in defence of freedom, pluralism, and democracy,'' he told
supporters at a rally in his KwaZulu-Natal powerbase.
Buthelezi, who leads the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party and is Home
Affairs Minister in South Africa's government of national unity, is
demanding greater autonomy in KwaZulu-Natal and a federal system of
government.
He stressed Inkatha would protest peacefully: ''It is clear that we
have no alternative but to use non-violent means.''
Buthelezi and his arch-rival President Nelson Mandela have traded
harsh words over continuing political violence in KwaZulu-Natal, which
is controlled by Inkatha after the country's first democratic elections
last year. Mandela has blamed Buthelezi for being behind the fighting.
Since the elections in April last year 1100 people have been killed in
KwaZulu-Natal, mostly in battles between ANC and Inkatha
supporters.--Reuter.
When Inkatha threatened to withdraw from last year's electionsMandela
promised international mediation over the question of regional autonomy.
Buthulezi has complained several times the promise has not been kept.

Jerusalem, Sunday
ISRAEL said today that negotiations soon to re-open with Syria would
be the most important of any conducted with Arab parties so far because
if successful, there could be a comprehensive Middle East peace.
However Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, speaking from
Washington, also said he did not think the time was yet ripe to declare
the extent of an Israeli pull-back on the Golan Heights, captured from
Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced after meeting
President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus that the army chiefs of Israel and
Syria would open new talks in Washington on June 27 on security
arrangements for a peace deal.
Christopher, ending his thirteenth Middle East tour, said he had
unprecedented hope for a complete end to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
'' . . . I think that this trip has reinforced my feeling that there
is a tremendous opportunity to move now toward a goal of a comprehensive
peace, perhaps a better opportunity than at any time during the
two-and-a-half years that I have been in office,'' he said after talks
with PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
Despite the optimism Peres was cautious about the line of withdrawal
from the Golan, a key sticking point in the long stalemate in
Israeli-Syrian talks.
''There is no need at this moment in my opinion to declare more than
we have declared,'' he told Israel Radio.
Peres said Israel had already declared ''that in essence we really
want peace, we are willing to make a withdrawal on the Golan Heights,
that we consider peace with Syria more important than all the prior
negotiations because it could be the last negotiations''.
Israel signed an interim peace deal with the Palestinians in 1993 and
a peace treaty with Jordan last year.
Syria wants a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan while Israel
wants Damascus first to agree to normal ties.
Negotiations were deadlocked until Israel and Syria agreed last month
on terms of reference for security arrangements under which the army
chiefs could meet. The vague agreement was the first between the sides
since peace talks were launched in 1991.
Both countries' ambassadors to Washington will also soon resume talks
on the thorniest problems: the final line of withdrawal, a pull-back
timetable, and normalisation of ties.
Peres said those issues and others would ultimately require
negotiations on the highest level between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and Assad. ''That level is demanded,'' he said.
Israeli President Ezer Weizmann was more blunt in a radio interview:
''Ultimately we need to reach a situation where . . . the Syrian
president will stop viewing us as -- I'll use the word -- unclean, as
unfit for his company.''
Rabin, asked if he would agree to a declaration of principles between
the sides if they were unable to conclude a peace deal before Israeli
elections in November next year, said: ''I am not looking for a
declaration of principles. We want to reach a peace treaty, a full peace
treaty.''
Both Peres and Rabin have said it will be difficult to offer Syria
anything less than that which the hard-line Likud government agreed to
return to Egypt under a 1979 peace treaty. In that accord, Israel handed
back all land captured from Egypt in 1967.
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, who has long backed giving back all
of the Golan, told reporters after the weekly Cabinet meeting: ''The
price that Israel has to pay for full peace is a known price. If you
don't know what the price is, I'll tell you: Total withdrawal from the
Golan Heights.''--Reuter.

Le Bourget, Sunday
THE world's two largest makers of commercial aircraft, America's
Boeing and the European Airbus Industrie, traded insults and attacked
one another's products in their battle for orders at the Paris Air Show.
In the end, Airbus Chairman Jean Pierson scored it 64-25 for the
challenger -- Airbus and its planes were mentioned 64 times by Boeing
President Ron Woodard while Airbus Vice President Adam Brown only
brought up Boeing 25 times in his remarks.
The diatribe underscored the intense rivalry between the United States
and Europe in the aerospace market -- hit hard by shrinking defence
budgets, economic slumps, and the low dollar -- and particularly between
these two long-standing bitter rivals.
Boeing dominates with about 60% of the world market in large civilian
jetliners. Airbus, a consortium of aerospace firms in Britain, France,
Germany, and Spain, has some 30-35%, with the rest held by
McDonnell-Douglas of the United States.
Boeing put its latest model, the giant twin-engine B777, on display
and unveiled the first big deals at the nine-day show with orders worth
some #376m from three European airlines for its new B737-800 passenger
jet.
Industry sources said Airbus would announce two new orders tomorrow.
Airbus is fiercely contesting with Boeing for a 50% share of the world
market and is showcasing its wide-body, long-haul A330 and A340
airliners.
The star of the show today was the sinister black ''batwing'' B2
long-range US Air Force stealth bomber, arriving remarkably quietly for
its first public display in Europe and staying for just over an hour.
The plane's crew said they had carried out a simulated ''bombing''
exercise over the Netherlands before landing in Paris.--AP/Reuter.

The Scottish housing market is in a fragile state
AS safe as houses? Not any more. The roof is falling in on the home
owners' dream.
The price of the average Scottish home fell by 3.8% in the three
months to April. It was the third consecutive fall in what should have
been one of the busiest times of the year.
Spring, traditionally, is when a house owner's thoughts turn to
moving. Forever onwards and upwards. Not any longer though. Not this
year, and not last. The portents offer no hope of an improvement next
year, nor the year after. Not at all, in short, in the near future.
All of the available figures disclose the fragile state of the
Scottish housing market. Yet it is at odds with what forecasters call
underlying factors, the economic runes.
They point to economic growth in Scotland continuing to be relatively
robust. Unemployment is still falling. Scotland still has fewer home
owners, just 57% compared to 66% south of the border. Research on behalf
of building societies shows that more Scots still nurture the dream of a
home of their own, with 67% saying they would like to be owner-occupiers
in two years time.
The Scots, in the main, escaped the catastrophic negative equity trap,
where the value of the house is less than the money borrowed to buy it,
because they did not get into such hock with high loans in the
high-flying eighties. House prices, after all, are at their lowest
relative to incomes for more than 25 years. Interest rates are similarly
low.
There are, of course, what the commentators call the negative
political factors: what in the simpler language of the soured home owner
is seen as the Government's ultimate betrayal of those who were
convinced that to buy a house was to take a stake in popular capitalism.
Who marched enthusiastically behind the Thatcherite standard of a home
owning democracy, enriched in some cases beyond avaricious dreams by
easy money and big houses only to fall by the recessionary wayside as
jobs vanished, repayments loomed and repossession spiralled. Home was
where the hurt is.
Then came the politically unimagineable: the two Budget cutbacks in
mortgage interest relief, the plans to curb mortgage benefit interest
for the unemployed from October this year, throwing them on to the
uncertain mercies of private insurance protection. If they can find it.
And what about all these short-term contracts, the fearful new world
of employment with its mobile, part-time, part-committed workforce? The
way the middle-classes for the first time felt the kind of job
insecurity that the diminishing band of horny-handed sons of toil have
understood for generations? Are they being put off buying a house
because they don't know whether the contract will be renewed next year,
or next month or never again?
And when your elderly parents' cherished home is sold off to pay for
the geriatric care and nursing home bills, where -- some may ask -- was
the point in all the scrimping and the saving and the thrift?
Does it come to this then: a lack of confidence amongst home owners
who did not understand that property prices could go down as well as up?
Those shaken out of the popular wisdom that said buying a house was a
sound investment? That you could not lose by putting your money into
bricks and mortar? Especially since housing accounts for around 50% of
personal wealth. Is an absence of that elusive feelgood factor to blame
for the parlous state of the property market?
It could be, it probably is, all of these, in part or whole. But there
is more to it. Something strange is happening. It is something that
homeowners will come to understand, sooner or later.
It is not a message that the Chancellor or any of the politicians
clamouring for help for hard-pressed home owners -- who also happen to
be voters -- may care to shout from the rooftops. And it is this.
If you want low inflation, tough luck to home owners. It has been
spiralling inflation over the past 30 years which has inculcated us with
the belief that a house is an investment; that it was better to buy a
house we thought we couldn't afford because within a few years it would
seem like a bargain. High inflation means that the money you borrow to
buy your house is worth less, while your house continues to increase in
value.
And the only way back to fast-rising house prices is through an
inflationary and unsustainable economic boom. Followed by another bust.
The days of regarding your home, your bricks and mortar, as an
investment hedge are in all probability over. Only in high inflation
Britain is the love affair with home-ownership, the deep conviction that
your house is your castle, a defender against future loss and a
comfortable hedge against ill-fortune, so deeply held.
Other advanced low inflation economies, such as those in Switzerland
where only 25% of the population own their homes, and Germany, with 60%,
have never been as thirled to home ownership as the UK.
Where buying a house offered the surest route to the accumulation of
wealth, it may now come to seem a consumer need. We may expect to pay
for our housing, not to profit from it.
In future, perhaps, education, skills and enterprise will count for
more than bricks and patio doors and double-glazed extensions. If we
want to live in a low inflation economy, we cannot expect to profit from
our houses. We may come to pay for it, as a consumer durable -- like a
washing machine or an overcoat -- and cease seeing it as an investment.
Given more sensitive political intervention to revive confidence, a
modest house price recovery over the next few years might be possible.
But more fundamental economic forces are here to stay. To sustain a
thriving low inflation economy means not creating another house price
explosion but preventing it. So forget the dream house, just think of
home.

MARY Carnie is desperate to get out of a house that she cannot sell.
The sitting room, dining room, and four bedrooms of the detached house
are freshly decorated.
The garden, a sixth of an acre, is beautifully kept, the grass
manicured, the garage pristine.
Her son, Frazer, was three weeks old when the family put the house in
Dalkeith, Midlothian, on the market. He is now a lively 17-month-old
toddler.
Mary and her husband Ian have dropped the selling price three times.
They now have the house on the market at a fixed price of #84,000.
That's only a thousand pounds more than they paid for the new house
three years ago. It was then valued at #90,000.
They have twice taken it off the market to redecorate. Still, 16
months later, they cannot sell. Maybe once a fortnight someone drops by
for a look.
In his recent petulant attack on home owners for fuelling the housing
crisis, Mr Major miserably misjudged the mood in the land of lost
content.
Mary and Ian are typical of those who were encouraged to gain a
toe-hold on the property ladder in the 'eighties. They each owned their
own flat. Both sold to buy a semi-detached in Lasswade when they
married. After the birth of their first two children, they decided to
move up:
Ian, a computer operator with an insurance company, was in secure
employment. He had worked for the same firm for around 18 years.Then, a
little under two years ago, his hours and wages were cut by half. He now
earns #13,000. The house had to go.
But 16 months on they cannot sell. Mary said: '' What do we do next?
We've even thought of putting the house up for auction.
''If we had our time again, we would think very carefully before
buying. We would think, and think again. We're not greedy people, we're
not feckless. We're sickened and desperate.''
Mrs Nina Hamilton decided to put her house up for sale to test the
market. She is illustrative of the shift in confidence amongst sellers:
''There's a house I want to buy across the road but I don't want to risk
not being able to sell my own.''
She is asking #57,000 for her three-bedroom semi-detached in
Colintraive Crescent, Hogganfield, Glasgow, just #1000 more than she
paid for it four years ago:
''I just want to sell. My last house was sold within weeks. This time
it's very slow. We've been on the market for more than a month and
people come, but they want to sell their own house before they buy. It's
very frustrating.''

Belgrade, Sunday
THE 10,000-strong British and French rapid reaction force planned for
Bosnia must have permission from the Bosnian Serbs before it can go
ahead, the rebels' ''foreign minister'' said today.
In a veiled warning that the Serbs could block the UN reinforcements
or any change in the peacekeeping mandate, Alexa Buha said the
international community must consult the Bosnian Serbs about the
deployment of British and other troops.
''The rapid reaction force or a change in the UN mandate won't go
ahead without our green light'' said Buha, ''foreign minister'' of the
self-declared Bosnian Serb Republic.
Britain and France insist that they are beefing up the UN mission to
protect threatened peacekeepers, not to impose a military solution in
Bosnia.
The reinforcements were ordered in response to a wave of Bosnian Serb
hostage taking after Nato air strikes last month.
The Serbs have since released 233 UN hostages but are still holding
144 men as a shield against further Allied air raids.
Today the Serbs released one of 12 Canadian soldiers wounded by
gunfire in a dangerous front-line zone. The other 11 Canadians were
moved to a safer site in Ilijas, said the UN.
Buha said today that he did not know when the remaining hostages would
be freed.
''They are all scattered in different places and gathering them is
very difficult,'' he said.
Bosnian Serb forces shelled two government-held suburb of Sarajevo
today and fighting erupted in Gorazde as the peackeeping mission
admitted it had to tolerate Serb restrictions.
The Serbs fired 15 artillery rounds from inside a UN weapons
collection site onto targets near the city's airport.
They also targeted a government-controlled area with 27 mortar bombs
in the latest violations of the now-ignored UN ban on heavy weapons
around the Bosnian capital.
Snipers wounded another two people in the city and two people were
injured by rifle grenades, hospitals said.
But with the Serbs still holding 145 hostages, UN officers said they
were under orders to accept -- at least for the moment -- both Serb
misbehaviour and the conditions imposed on aid deliveries in order to
keep the coast clear for faltering diplomatic efforts.
The Bosnian government accused the United Nations of simply caving in
again to Serb aggression.
Fighting broke out at dawn in the so-called ''safe area'' of Gorazde
in eastern Bosnia, where UN officials fear peacekeeping troops can no
longer prevent an escalation of violence.
Small-arms fire hit the UN compound but there were no casualties.
With the UN mission paralysed by the Serbs, the EU's newly-appointed
peace envoy Carl Bildt began a week of talks in an attempt to revive a
diplomatic offensive.
The former Swedish Prime Minster has been asked to prepare proposals
to be put to the warring sides once the Bosnian Serbs free the remaining
hostages.
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali told the German news
magazine Der Spiegel that he wanted all-party peace talks -- along the
lines of an unsuccessful conference in London three years ago.--Reuter.

Medellin, Sunday
A BOMB exploded at an outdoor music festival, spraying shrapnel that
killed at least 28 people and wounded more than 200 others. One suspect
was arrested.
The blast in a city centre park last night occurred one block away
from a police barracks. It recalled the worst days of the north-western
city's drug terrorism, which dwindled with the 1993 killing of cartel
kingpin Pablo Escobar.
''There was a flash of light, then black smoke. Everyone was
screaming, it was total chaos. People were crying and bleeding
everywhere,'' said Guillermo Pardo, 26, whose brother was hit in the
shoulder.
Television footage of the attack showed mangled bodies on stretchers
and hospital wards lined with bomb victims.
A suspect carrying five cans of gunpowder was arrested, but the motive
for the attack was not immediately known. A $625,000 reward was offered
for information leading to the capture of other suspects.
Police Colonel Victor Manuel Paez said a 22lb bomb filled with
shrapnel was placed beneath a sculpture of a bird by internationally
renowned artist Fernando Botero in Medellin's San Antonio park.
It exploded as a musical festival called ''I Am Cartagena'' -- after
the Colombian city on the Caribbean -- was ending. About 5000 people
attended the festival, according to organiser Ramiro Carvajalino, but
the audience had dwindled to 1500 by the time the bomb went off.
''We don't understand why something like this happened at a festival
of happiness and peace,'' he said.
A police spokesman confirmed 28 deaths, but the Red Cross and city
officials earlier said 30 people had died.
At the General Hospital, Dr Carlos Alberto Pelaez said three of the
dead were children, and added that the bomb was worse than any terrorist
attack carried out by Escobar in Medellin.
Officials made radio appeals for blood donations.
Defence Minister Fernando Botero, son of the artist whose sculpture
was destroyed, flew to Medellin to assess security and Mayor Sergio
Naranjo convened an emergency meeting of law enforcement officials.
Naranjo said he feared a resurgence of terrorism in Medellin after a
quiet spell since Escobar's death.
Police speculated that the bomb was planted by left-wing guerrillas
seeking concessions in peace negotiations, or by drug traffickers
angered by Friday's arrest of a Cali drug kingpin.
The attack came only one day after police arrested Gilberto Rodriguez
Orejuela, who with his brother Miguel leads the Cali drug cartel, which
supplies 80% of the world's cocaine.--AP.

Bradford has been sitting on a powder keg in recent years, waiting for
a spark to set it off -- and on Friday night a minor incident was enough
lead to a riot which has left a trail of destruction and the threat of
more violence to come unless relationships between the Asian community
and the police can be mended quickly, as Kirsty Scott reports.
BY LATE yesterday afternoon the burnt-out cars and broken glass were
being removed from the streets of Bradford, but there was still no sign
of real progress to repair the rapidly disintegrating relationship
between the police and members of the city's young Asian community. Last
night, the Manningham area of Bradford was bracing itself for further
outbreaks of violence.
Asian community leaders have blamed the unrest on police, saying they
had ignored warnings that there could be violence following two arrests
for minor public order offences on Friday.
The police, meanwhile, have laid the blame on a new generation of
young Asians whom they say are caught between two cultures and are
unwilling to answer to anyone.
The rioting was triggered by a complaint on Friday about youths
playing football in the street. Locals claimed that a police car ran
over the foot of one of the youths. There were some scuffles and when
police arrived at a house in the Manningham area to make two arrests
it's alleged that a young Asian mother was assaulted during a row. The
police have denied this.
In all, 10 people were arrested on Friday night and a further five on
Saturday night. Three police officers and one youth needed hospital
treatment. Bricks, stones and broken glass littered the streets and
dozens of shop windows were boarded up. A spokesman for West Yorkshire
Police said there was a trail of destruction one mile long leading from
Manningham into Bradford city centre.
The city is home to one of Britain's largest and most vocal Asian
communities. In 1992, a representative of the Bradford Council of
Mosques spoke out publicly about the dangers facing author Salman
Rushdie when it was learned that a paperback version of The Satanic
Verses was to go on sale. The book was burned publicly at a
demonstration in the city.
A West Yorkshire Police spokesman denied yesterday there was a poor
relationship with the young Asian community. The spokesman said they had
community liaison officers in every division. ''Obviously Bradford,
having what you might call these differences in the community, has a lot
of these officers.''
Local councillor Rang Zeb said it had only been a matter of time
before the situation erupted. He said the police did not treat black
people properly, and there were rumours of troublemaking by racist
organisations which was then blamed on the Asian community.
''The young people are just demanding their rights, demanding to be
treated equally. There is a poor relationship between the police and
members of the young community, and I can tell you the relationship
between the elders and the police has also now broken down.''
He said he did not condone the weekend violence but could understand
what had sparked it.
General secretary of the Bradford Council of Mosques, Khadim Hussain,
claimed the police had not co-operated with their suggestions to avoid
Saturday night's violence. He said community leaders had pleaded that
public order charges should be dropped against the 10 people arrested on
Friday.
''If they had agreed we could have gone outside and told the younger
people and there would have been no trouble. They just said they
couldn't do it. If they had co-operated all this could have been
prevented.''
Meanwhile, West Yorkshire's Chief Constable Keith Hellawell said the
police found it difficult to talk to the young Asians, whom, he said,
were outwith the control of their elders.
''Cultural and religious leaders have been worried for the past 10
years or so that the younger generation don't follow their teachings and
they feel they have great difficulty in controlling them,'' he said.
''There is this enormous powder keg within them which they vent on the
police and also on their own community. There is a great deal of tension
in that community and it was really looking for something to spark it
off.''
A spokesman at the West Yorkshire Police headquarters said they had
held a meeting yesterday to discuss contingency plans for further
violence but he said he did not know of any plans for the police and
members of the Asian community to meet again.
Young male unemployment in the Manningham area stands at 50% and Asian
community officials have said a long-term solution to the problems must
look at education and housing as well as jobs. There have also been
complaints from the young people about harassment.
In recent weeks the Asian community in the city had complained to
police about prostitutes and kerb-crawlers in the notorious Lumb Lane
area, the district used as a backdrop for the recent TV drama Band of
Gold.
Locals said groups of young Asian vigilantes had taken to the streets
to keep the prostitutes and their clients away. Rang Zeb said the scheme
had been a neighbourhood watch initiative and that when white people set
up such programmes they were lauded for doing so.
Both he and a police spokesman said the Lumb Lane issue had nothing to
do with the recent rioting, but one local said the lines between the two
issues were blurred. ''It's all part of the climate of tension in this
area,'' he said.

Banks and police are striving to remain one step ahead of increasingly
sophisticated counterfeiters, reports Craig Watson.
THE popular myth of the counterfeit money industry is that its only
victims are banks and financial institutions. The reality is that
pensioners with poor eyesight and travellers unfamiliar with foreign
currency are likely to be the real victims. Countless other shoppers who
fail to check their change at the till have fallen foul of the forger.
The counterfeit industry is booming and improvements in technology
have led to the production of fake bank notes in increasing numbers.
Crude notes can be made by small-time criminals using a colour
photo-copier, but large-scale operations involve sophisticated printing
equipment. The manufacturers will then pass the notes to a network of
local dealers to distribute in their area. The selling price is usually
a third to a quarter of the face value.
Seizures of sterling in Britain have topped #50m during the past three
years. Banknotes found in a skip and passed to The Herald could have
been worth up to #13,000 to the forger -- a small proportion of the
fakes in circulation.
Police forces throughout Scotland have faced up to the problem of
counterfeit currency. A workshop involving senior officers met at the
end of last year. An action plan of 16 recommendations was drawn up and
is currently being scrutinised by a working group.
The suggestions include improved training and education for police
officers, closer links with banks and financial institutions, and a
review of internal procedures with regard to forgery.
Detective Superintendent Gordon Ferrie, Strathclyde CID deputy head
(operations), said there had been a huge increase in counterfeit
currency discovered in the region last year -- up 500% from 1993. About
9000 counterfeit bank notes, with a face value of about #500,000, were
reported to officers -- a record in Strathclyde.
More than 170 people were arrested as a result. But the forgers are
becoming both more professional and more flexible, moving slowly towards
the production of false documents as well as money.
Mr Ferrie said: ''Counterfeit currency is on the increase and is a
major problem that we are working hard to tackle. But one of our biggest
concerns is that this no longer stops at counterfeit money. Driving
licences, passports, insurance documents and savings stamps are all
being produced.
''The counterfeiter has become more professional, making it harder for
us to detect, but everything is being done to overcome the problem and
protect the innocent victims.''
Last year Lothian and Borders Police launched Operation Noteworthy to
head off a ''surge'' in counterfeit currency. The campaign, which
included the production of an information video and a number of public
meetings, ran for five months from October and led to 57 arrests and the
seizure of 28,000 notes with a face value of around #500,000.
Senior crime prevention officer Chief Inspector Frank Gillespie said:
''The whole campaign was based on examining notes at the point of
exchange and it worked very effectively. Not only did it take these
notes out of circulation but it also meant that the criminal was aware
that he faced a much greater risk.''
The co-ordinating body for major forgery investigations is the
National Criminal Intelligence Unit (NCIU) in London. It was set up
three years ago to gather intelligence on the country's top criminals.
The fake money passed to The Herald will be sent to the NCIU for
authenticity tests. Assuming it is forged, it will then be forwarded to
the issuing bank for destruction.
An organisation spokeswoman said: ''There has been an increase in
counterfeiting recently -- due in part to new technology -- but it still
accounts for less than 1% of all notes in circulation.''
There is no doubt that continued improvements in technology will lead
to more convincing fake banknotes. But the NCIU spokeswoman was adamant:
''We will always be one step ahead of the forger.''
It is not only detectives who are faced with the challenge of the
forgers. Banks and retailers are also striving to stay on top of the
problem.
Mr Liaqat Qureshi, manager of the National Bank of Pakistan in
Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, said dealers offering generous exchange
rates may target members of the Pakistani community due to make return
trips to Pakistan. The money would be unfamiliar to people who had not
used it for several years.
He added: ''This is a real problem which ultimately affects everyone.
The individual who ends up with the counterfeit suffers and eventually
it damages the economy by causing inflation.''
A spokesman for the Clydesdale Bank said: ''People tend to think of
this as a victimless crime, but it is not. The money passes down the
line and often ends up with people, such as the elderly, who do not have
perfect eyesight. Sadly those people also have a limited budget and end
up losing out -- these are the human consequences,'' he added.
A spokesman for the Royal Bank of Scotland said the most common
forgeries were Bank of England #10 notes and higher denominations. The
spokesman said the bank had recently introduced a series of security
measures to tackle the problem of fraud. Ultra violet scanners and
detector pens are used in most Royal Bank branches. In addition,
sophisticated anti-counterfeit equipment has been installed in the
bank's major sorting offices.
Genuine notes were very difficult to copy accurately, the spokesman
said. They are made up of several layers of paper and have a number of
additional security features, such as the watermark and the security
thread.
The Glasgow Chamber of Commerce has also joined the battle against the
forgers. Several hundred special security pens issued by the
organisation were snapped up within three months and senior staff have
warned about the cost of fraud.
Researchers around the world have long been searching for a fool-proof
method of detecting false notes. The most common methods used in this
country are the ultra-violet scanners which reflect light from
counterfeit notes and the security pens which show different colours on
genuine and forged notes. But as the conmen become more sophisticated,
these methods are increasingly unreliable.
The latest device about to appear on the market is a mini computer,
several inches in size, which scans notes and compares the image to that
of the genuine article stored in its memory. Researchers at Mars
Electronics International claim the new device will revolutionise the
anti-counterfeit industry.
With the opportunity literally to make money it is unlikely this new
threat will deter the underworld's increasingly sophisticated money men.

Rome, Sunday
ITALIANS have voted by a clear margin in a key referendum against
moves that would have forced former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to
break up his television empire.
Television exit polls forecast that Italians had voted ''No'' by a
margin of between 6% and 16% in today's referendum, which had sought to
repeal a law allowing private individuals to own more than one national
television station.
Two other referendums seeking to limit TV advertising, which would
also have harmed Berlusconi's #4600m-a-year Fininvest media empire, were
also heading for defeat.
A fourth referendum seeking to part-privatise public broadcaster RAI
appeared to have been successful.
More than half of Italy's 48.6 million eligible voters had to take
part in the ballots for the results to be valid. RAI estimated the
turn-out at 55%.
Berlusconi's three private Fininvest stations had bombarded viewers
with constant advice to vote ''No'' in the run-up to today's ballots,
which Berlusconi himself had billed as an attempt to destroy his
business so as to ruin him politically.
The billionaire businessman had badly needed a victory to boost his
political career, on the wane since he was forced to resign last
December after seven months as premier.
''These results show that we are in tune with public opinion,'' said a
spokesman for Berlusconi's free-market Forza Italia party.
The referendums on private television were sponsored by opponents of
Berlusconi, who enjoys a near monopoly on private broadcasting in Italy.
Italians were called to vote in 12 referendums today, with issues
ranging from shop opening hours to trades union rights.--Reuter.

A shaft full of radioactive waste dumped at Dounreay from 1958 is set
to contaminate the Atomic Energy Authority's reputation, with a new
report expected to call for an expensive and hazardous clean-up, reports
David Ross.
THE Atomic Energy Authority at Dounreay is bracing itself for another
spate of bad publicity this week with the publication of a report from
the Government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee
(RWMAC).
RWMAC launched an inquiry last autumn after a 19-page internal report
from Dounreay dated October 24. This could not adequately explain to the
regulatory authorities why radioactive contamination was still regularly
being detected on the shore near the Caithness plant.
The Dounreay report suggested a number of sources of the pollution
leaks. One was a 200ft former access shaft where low and intermediate
nuclear waste had been dumped from 1958 until May 10, 1977, when a
hydrogen explosion blew the concrete cover off the shaft and blasted
debris up to 40m away. The shaft was then sealed.
The RWMAC report is expected to point at least one of its fingers at
the shaft and demand that the remaining waste be dealt with once and for
all. To do so would be expensive, and it would be hazardous. The shaft
contains a dangerous cocktail of chemicals. The plutonium content alone
is thought to pose a danger to the environment for up to 127,000 years.
But few of us can really start to understand such propositions, or the
true risks presented by the products and by-products of a very dangerous
business. Far easier to cling to oft-used phrases such as ''Well within
the strict safety guidelines laid down by the Government's regulatory
authorities.''
The Dounreay shaft, however, is perhaps hiding more than nuclear
waste. It was sunk through fractured flagstone in 1956 to provide access
while a liquid waste pipeline was being built. It was largely unlined
and filled with water. This has to be continually pumped to maintain its
water levels below sea level to prevent wholesale leakage into the
Pentland Firth.
But virtually nothing was known of its existence until two years ago.
There had been a brief mention of an explosion during the Dounreay
Inquiry in 1986. And consultants were called in to advise the Government
because Dounreay did not want to bear, for ever, the extra expense of
pumping the shaft. But the 1990 RM Consultants report, while technically
in the public domain, was, in fact, in the depths of the House of
Commons Library. ''You would have had to know about the shaft to ask for
the report on it,'' one source said to The Herald recently.
It was The Herald in March 1993 which brought the shaft to the
public's attention, and the deep concerns about it held by a respected
independent consultant who had just visited the plant.
Dr Peter Kayes, of Environmental Dynamic, had been hired by Highland
Regional Council to report on Dounreay's planning application to extend
a waste pit. He was ''puzzled'' why Dounreay hadn't mentioned the shaft
when he had requested full information of radioactive waste disposals in
all its forms.
He feared that little was known of its contents. He believed that the
shaft contained material far more radioactive than that stored in the
nearby low-level waste pits, which had been the main subject of his
investigations
''In addition, the strontium 90 levels are some 60 times greater,
caesium 137 levels are some 35 times greater, the plutonium 239 levels
are 25 times greater, and the plutonium 240 are about four times
greater.''
His comments on the pits were even more damning and a month later
councillors, during an unprecedented visit by the planning committee,
saw for themselves that he was not exaggerating. The Herald's picture of
their visit showed thousands of rusting drums of nuclear waste scattered
on the surface of the waste pits, where some had lain for eight years.
What was equally stunning was the fact that the regulatory
authorities, Her Majesty's inspectorates of pollution and nuclear
installations, had not seen fit to act on what apparently had been an
accepted part of Dounreay life. Just how close an eye were they keeping
on things?
They certainly didn't appear to be concerned that for 19 years after
1958 Dounreay was keeping no proper documentation of what was being put
down the shaft despite the demands of the Radioactive Substances Act
1960, and despite nuclear waste being taken to Dounreay from government
research centres hundreds of miles away in England for dumping in the
shaft.
The 1990 RM Consultants report even found that five of the 23 drums of
strontium titanate brought from Harwell in 1974 were leaking and were a
possible source of strontium 90 found on the foreshore and that no
records had been kept about containers used to dump other wastes but it
was ''probable'' that some material had been dumped in cardboard drums.
The regulatory authorities, however, did not at that time licence the
Dounreay site, so presumably did not monitor the shaft between 1958 and
1977. One might have thought that they would have been involved in 1977
when there was an explosion, serious enough for the shaft to be sealed.
The investigation into that explosion, however, was not carried out by
the inspectorates or any other independent body, but by the Atomic
Energy Authority themselves. The AEA, which stated publicly at the time
that surface contamination had been cleared up, prepared a report which
satisfied the Industrial Pollution Inspectorate, and that was that. No
copy of the report has ever been published.
It is perhaps strange to think now that no AEA employee sought to
publicise what happened at the shaft, or indeed the later dumping at the
pits. But not only were they economically dependent, but ever since
Dounreay's establishment in the mid-1950s Dounreay's workforce had been
subject to the Official Secrets Act and, until recently, faced the very
real prospect of prosecution, and indeed imprisonment, for any breach.
For so long the nuclear industry had been an integral part of the
greater governmental machine, of its defense system, whose traditions of
all-pervading secrecy were handed down from the Second World War, and
throughout the Cold War. A Dounreay manager was no more likely to blow
the whistle on the plant's activities than indeed was a nuclear
inspector. They were on the same side.
Which side the British public was seen to be on is less clear. But the
public's trust in the nuclear industry and the Government's stewardship
of it has been weakening for a decade now in the face of continued fears
about childhood leukaemia and other health risks.
The stark evidence now presented by the shaft and waste pits shows
that the tradition of secrecy has been badly abused down the years. This
is confirmed every time there is another ''incident'' at the plant, and
not just to anti-nuclear activists. Now the plant's most loyal
supporters are asking questions, as the Caithness Courier reported in
April: ''There is an instinctive reluctance among people in Caithness to
criticise a facility which created prosperity and stability in many
shops and homes for four decades. As the prosperity and stability begins
to subside and the 'shock horror' stories begin to occur almost weekly,
the signs of unease, worry and suspicion are there to see.''
The present Dounreay management needs help. Although they have been
the subject of unprecedented criticism from local MP Robert Maclennan
for treating their workforce as chattels, they are the ones who have
been left to atone for the sins of their fathers. Their burden would be
lighter if they didn't have to mould themselves into the lean, mean
machine demanded by life in the commercial sector.
Dounreay's legacy to the environment will have to be contested some
time, whatever has to be paid. Viewed in the long term, it will be cheap
at the price.

Keith Sinclair writes: The SNP has called for a rejection of all
applications for the new Channel 5 television licence because of what it
calls the unsatisfactory nature, particularly the ''London bias'', of
the current bids.
Mr Paul Scott, the SNP's art and broadcasting spokesman, replying to
Mr Brian Marjoribanks, Officer for Scotland of the Independent
Television Commission, said yesterday that it has been widely agreed
that existing television services were greatly over-centralised in
London and excessively dominated by metropolitan concerns.
He said: ''The Broadcasting for Scotland campaign has been vocal and
effective in arguing this case with regard to the BBC but, up until now,
there has been a recognition that ITC companies -- because of the
regional and national structure within the ITC licence agreements --
have been somewhat more sensitive to the diversity of the United
Kingdom. In particular, the Scottish licencees have been much more
willing and able to produce distinctive services.

FOOD poisoning is increasing in Britain because too many people do not
follow cooking instructions, according to a new report.
Figures show that the number of notified cases rose in all parts of
Britain last year and more people believed they suffered food poisoning.
A separate National Food Safety Report shows that one in 14 adults in
Scotland believe they had food poisoning in the past year.
This figure is the same as the UK average of 7%, which showed a 3%
increase on the figure reported the year before.
The report, which was produced by the Food and Drink Federation,
reveals that more than one in two people surveyed said they did not
always follow manufacturers' food preparation instructions.
The number of recorded cases of food poisoning in Scotland increased
from 3225 in 1993 to 4100 in 1994, in England and Wales from about
70,000 to more than 82,000, and in Northen Ireland from 954 to more than
1000.
A spokeswoman for the federation said the survey's results showed that
much still needs to be done to increase standards of food safety in the
home.
However, the findings also suggest that food safety awareness among
consumers is relatively high, an apparent contradiction which, the
federation says, highlights some ''interesting'' findings:
* More than six out of 10 people questioned said they always stored
perishable foods in their fridge within two hours of buying the food;
yet fewer than one in five took adequate care in transporting chilled or
frozen food home by using a cool bag or box.
* Although six out of 10 people were aware that food poisoning was
most likely to be caused by not heating or cooking food properly, more
than half of those questioned did not always follow manufacturers'
preparation instructions and 75% did not always read them.
The report has been published to coincide with National Food Safety
Week from today to Sunday and is based on a survey of 2000 adults.
Its regional profiles show that people in Scotland were most likely
always to keep pets, insects, and pests away from food and most likely
to ensure food stored in a fridge was in containers or properly wrapped.
Scots were also most likely not to eat food that was past its
''use-by'' date.
During Food Safety Week, the federation, in conjunction with the Royal
Environmental Health Institute of Scotland and the Chartered Institute
of Environmental Health, is seeking to convey a number of messages to
the consumer.
It says that: proper storage of perishable foods in the fridge and
freezer is very important; manufacturers' instructions should be
followed; food should be eaten as soon as possible after it has been
cooked; raw meat and cooked food must be stored and prepared separately;
and personal hygiene and cleanliness in the kitchen is vital.
National Food Safety Week will include exhibitions and other events
throughout Britain organised by local environmental health officers.

A CHARITY'S attempt to set a world record by climbing Scotland's 277
munros simultaneously was marred at the weekend when one of the 4000
walkers taking part collapsed and died.
It was the second death on mountains at the weekend, bringing the toll
this year to 31.
In the first accident, a young Israeli fell to his death in a gorge
near Achnashellach, Ross-shire. The body of Mr Nathan Steren, 21, of
Ramat, Hasharon, Israel, was recovered by Torridon mountain rescue team.
In the second incident, a 45-year-old forester from the Borders died
after collapsing while taking part in a record-breaking attempt
organised by WaterAid to scale all Scotland's munros -- peaks over
3000ft -- between noon and 2pm on Saturday.
Mr Michael Beaton, a married man with three children, of Gaitschow
Lane, Selkirk, was one of a party of four which set out to walk to the
top of An Socach in Glen Affric, 30 miles from Inverness.
He became unwell and a rescue helicopter was called. However, he was
dead on arrival at Raigmore hospital, Inverness. It is believed he
suffered a heart attack.
The charity, which is made up of officials of all Scotland's local
authority water and sewerage departments, raises money to fund water
projects in the Third World.
They were hoping to raise #150,000 for projects in Nepal and win an
entry in the Guinness Book of Records by being the first organisation to
conquer all 277 munros at the same time.
One of the event's organisers, Mr Tom Hutchison, the sewerage manager
for Borders Regional Council, said: ''It is tragic that such a
worthwhile event should have to cope with such a tragedy.
''It appears Mr Beaton had a massive heart attack. He was a very fit
and active man and his death has stunned everyone. One expects people
who are less active to suffer something like this.
''But I understand it was mercifully quick for him. When he collapsed,
his team leader and a colleague of Mr Beaton, Stuart McKay, tried to
revive him. Stuart has experience in first aid but sadly his tremendous
efforts to resuscitate Mr Beaton failed.
''One of the party ran back down the hill and found a mountain biker
who cycled to the nearby Glen Affric Lodge and phoned the authorities.
The helicopter was there very quickly but unfortunately there was
nothing anyone could do for Mr Beaton.''
The attempt to scale that particular munro was abandoned by Mr
Beaton's team but it was felt Mr Beaton would not have wanted the
record-book attempt to fail. Another team then completed the climb.
Mr Hutchison added: ''Obviously, everyone was very cut up about what
happened and the last thing anyone wanted to do was finish the climb.
But it was felt Mr Beaton would have wanted it to continue.''
Last night, WaterAid's director, Mr Jon Lane, said they had succeeded
in setting a world record. He added: ''However, Mr Beaton's death cast a
pall over what would otherwise have been a happy day for us. We feel
very sad he is not here to share the achievement.''
In the first incident, the Torridon mountain rescue team was called
after Mr Steren was reported overdue on Saturday morning. He had been
walking on a track between Glenuig and Achnashellach in Wester Ross. His
body was found soon after noon at the foot of a deep gorge and the
operation to recover it took several hours.
A police spokesman said: ''The ravine was very steep with outcrops of
rock, making it very hazardous for the rescuers to abseil down into a
very narrow opening. They deserve praise for their courage and skill.''

THE new opinion poll by the Electoral Reform Society is a significant
document. It gives comfort to the Labour Party with its overwhelming
findings in favour of a statutory minimum wage, but promises potentially
terrible times ahead for Mr Tony Blair if he persists in refusing to set
a figure for a minimum wage. To add to his worries, the clear majority
in the poll expects that any political party in favour of a minimum wage
should certainly not set it lower than #4.15 an hour. The Labour
leadership, with its determination to avoid a figure until a Labour
Government can consult both unions and employers and refer the issue to
a commission, must consider what to do next. Mr Blair, who is obviously
determined to control his party and to allow as little deviation as
possible from his own views, is unlikely to change his mind on this
issue. Nor should he. A principal part of his approach is that there
should be widespread consultation with as many relevant opinions as
possible before any decision is reached. With an issue which will have
important repercussions for so many British people, and for the economic
performance and health of the nation, it should be obvious that this is
the correct way to proceed. The aim is to achieve as high a level of
minimum wage as is reasonably possible and as is consistent with the
economic circumstances at the time. To attempt to set a figure on it at
the moment may have short-term attractions but could easily end up as a
serious mistake.
The main unions, the Transport and General Workers' Union, Unison, and
the GMB are just as determined to pursue their policy, arguing that in
so doing they will be remaining faithful to their own line, but also to
that of the Labour Party. There have been signs that the GMB was
weakening a little, depending on how you read the runes at the union's
annual conference in Brighton. The motion there dealing with the issue
of a minimum wage said nothing about setting a specific level before the
next General Election and insisted only that the level set should be
realistic. This is interpreted as an indication that the union does not
want a headlong clash with the Labour leadership, especially one which
would be so public and damaging. Nevertheless, the findings of the
latest poll will stiffen the resistance of those within the GMB who want
to persist in a common front with the other large unions. Both the TGWU
and Unison are almost certain to press ahead with their campaign for
#4.15 to be set now. Alan Jinkinson of Unison will be criticised this
morning for his admission that a minimum wage would lose some jobs.
However, his argument is that only a very few jobs provided by cowboy
employers already paying extremely low wages will be lost. This will be
unfortunate for the workers involved, but employers like that will not
be missed.
Nevertheless it seems likely now that the minimum wage will become a
contentious issue at the Labour conference in the autumn. If all of the
main unions hold firm to their position, Mr Blair and the leadership
will be facing a revolt by at least 35% of the conference votes. Some of
the smaller unions would also  support the call for a wage to be set
immediately, and although the bulk of the constituency groups are likely
to support Mr Blair there might still be enough renegades seriously to
embarrass the leadership. Even the most determined figures in the union
cannot expect that the Labour leader will let himself be steamrollered
on this issue, especially as he has invested so much personal capital in
arguing for a delay and in persuading employers and other nervous
business figures that proper consultation will take place. Mr Blair's
next steps on this matter are not, however, clear. It was unwise of
senior Labour figures to attempt to undermine a poll which gives such
generous support to the essence of one of their major policies. To
suggest that it was flawed because the impact on employment was not
included in the questions appears self-defeating. Probably the best that
the leadership can do over the summer is to attempt to persuade as many
opponents as possible of the wisdom of waiting before setting a level.
This may involve arm-twisting as well as gentler methods, but the Labour
Party and the unions are no strangers to the more robust side of
political debate. The effort must be made for the issue of a minimum
wage is both worth fighting for and not to be sacrificed by hasty
action. The policy appears to have the widespread support of the public,
but it must be delivered with proper consultation and care.

INSPECTORS in Edinburgh and West Lothian making random checks on a
cable television company's public safety measures and the standard of
their road reinstatement have reported an almost 100% failure rate.
United Artists Communication's performance is labelled by one senior
Lothian councillor as ''miserable''.
ScottishPower, which claims to have suffered severe disruption to its
supply network as a result of United Artists digging up streets and
pavements, is appointing two ''cable policeman'' in a bid to reduce the
damage.
United Artists vigorously rebutts the claim; says it disputes other
figures from Lothian transportation department; maintains that it has
not agreed a catalogue of faults; and objects to the way the department
assembles and interprets its statistics. The allegation of breaks in
electricity supply is, it says, an attempt to sidestep the failures of
other utilities.
Nevertheless, Councillor Ken Harrold, vice-chairman of Lothian's
Transportation Committee, is unequivocal in his condemnation of United
Artists' roadworks record: ''This is a problem we have had to live with
since United Artists began to dig up Edinburgh. They have failed
miserably on major points such as the safety of road users and
pedestrians and surface re-instatement.''
The random checks, 5000 in the past year, have thrown up an almost
identical number of faults, according to reports by Transportation
Department officials. In March alone, the last month for which full
figures are available, United Artists allegedly failed on 295 occasions
to meet laid down standards. Of the total, 201 faults are said to have
been recorded in West Lothian and 94 in Edinburgh.
To put the failure rate of United Artist's cabling contractors in
perspective, the record shows that, during the same period, other
utilities opening the roads and pavements racked up a total of 165
failures among them -- the local authority's own water and drainage
departments scoring 74, Scottish Power 43, British Telecom 29, and
Scottish Gas 19.
However, United Artists claims that, kilometre for kilometre of roads
and pavements opened, its record is even better than the rest. In March
alone, said a company spokeswoman, the company cut 48 kilometres of
track in Edinburgh and West Lothian, ''much more than the other services
combined''. She stressed: ''We have a good relationship with Lothian
region but are in serious dispute about the number of faults they claim
to have found.''

opened in Glasgow yesterday, writes ALISON DANIELS.
The garden, at the Craigton crematorium in Cardonald, has been created
following a request from Mrs Isabel Robertson, of Kirkintilloch, who
felt she had nowhere to grieve the loss of her baby.
The Craigton crematorium carries out the cremation of miscarried and
stillborn children and the garden has been provided by the Co-operative
Funeral Services.
Parents wishing to grieve the loss of a baby can have their child's
name inscribed on a plaque beside a memorial stone bearing the
inscription ''Forever in our thoughts''.
A dedication service was conducted yesterday by the Rev Janet
MacMahon, chaplaincy co-ordinator at the Southern General hospital in
Glasgow.
Mrs Ann McMurray, of the Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society, said
at the ceremony that grieving was made easier by the presence of a
permanent memorial.
She said parents often spent years coming to terms with their loss and
being able to grieve properly was part of the healing process.

THE Scout Association is considering changing the traditional pledge
of duty to God and the monarchy which is declared by its 650,000 members
in the UK.
Scout leaders acknowledge that one example of changing attitudes could
be that young people no longer think it relevant in the light of the
Prince of Wales's admission of adultery.
The wording of the oath for the past 30 years has been: ''On my
honour, I promise I will do my best to do my duty to God and to the
Queen, to help other people and to keep the Scout law.''
The UK's chief scout Garth Morrison said: ''It will be hard for some
people to promise to do their duty to an adulterer.''
The movement, founded 88 years ago by Lord Baden-Powell, has
established the Values Group to explore alternative wording and has
already consulted Cubs and Scouts on what they feel about the current
pledge.

NORTHERN Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew was still undecidedlast
night over the fate of jailed Paratrooper Lee Clegg.
No decision has been taken to free him and Sir Patrick may seek talks
with senior members of the Northern Ireland judiciary before making an
announcement.
Details of the recommendation by the Life Sentence Review Board, which
considered the case last week, have not been disclosed.
The delay could mean Sir Patrick will want to consult Northern Ireland
Lord Chief Justice Sir Brian Hutton and Mr Justice Anthony, the judge
who convicted Clegg in Belfast, Campbell.
A final decision could be some weeks off.
Clegg was jailed for life for the murder of teenager Karen Reilly, 19,
who was shot dead when Clegg and other Paratroopers opened fire on a
stolen car in west Belfast in September 199O.
The victim's father Sean, said yesterday: ''All I want is that Clegg
stays in prison but it is likely he will get out soon and I dare say
they will have to make concessions to other prisoners.
''They'll have to find some reason to release him. If they change the
rules for him, then they'll have to change the rules for the others as
well. It has become such a political issue now, and that's the last
thing I wanted.''
The Government has been irritated by Irish Prime Minister John Bruton,
who said Clegg's release could be regarded as one law for the security
forces and one law for others. If Clegg did get out, then there should
also be early releases for paramilitary prisoners, Mr Bruton said.
The Northern Ireland Office stressed again yesterday that the case of
Clegg should not be linked to other prisoners.
It is considering changes to extend compassionate leave but it is
thought they are minor and some sort of announcement could be made in
the Commons today.

WRITING in praise of the Auld Alliance, Alex Salmond claims that
France is ''leading the way in assured belief in a new and co-operative
Europe ''(June 7). He goes on to state that Scotland should
''participate fully in that Europe as a sovereign state''.
What kind of Europe does Mr Salmond mean? Current SNP policy is in
favour of Maastricht and EMU, Mr Salmond considers that the transfer of
significant power from national parliaments to EU institutions
represents a ''desirable objective'', and no-one from the SNP is willing
to explain how the party's preferred option of a ''confederation of
nation states'' differs in any way from the federal structure which
Maastricht will impose.
How can a nation remain sovereign when it does not control its own
economy, when its national laws can be overturned by a superior court,
when its elected representatives can be outvoted on every issue, and
where its entire economic and social development is in the hands of a
European central bank over which it has no political control?
This kind of sophistry is exactly what Peter Jay set out to expose in
On the Record on Sunday, June 4. His contention is that we are heading
for a country called Europe and he condemned the evasiveness and
semantics in which politicians in this country indulge whenever the
subject of the EU is raised.
As Mr Jay said, ''If it is the same colour as an elephant, looks like
an elephant and behaves like an elephant, then it is an elephant. Why
try to pretend it is something else or refuse to say what it is at
all?''
Mr Salmond and the SNP would have us believe it is a camel, albeit an
independent camel.

IT SEEMS illogical of Andrew Anderson to cite that now threadbare
example of American alcohol prohibition during the 1920s in his
criticism of Strathclyde's Chief Constable (June 7). It is surely among
Mr Sharp's appointed functions to enforce the law on drugs as it
currently applies.
Until recently, we have enjoyed a lifestyle in Scotland free of the
drug culture. If the logic of ''decriminalisation'' of troublesome or
controversial matters is taken to the extreme, what will be next on the
agenda? Where does society draw the line?
On the other hand, Mr Anderson is right to suggest that the drugs
problem needs to be argued. If, after a thorough and well-informed
public debate which took into account the safety and welfare of children
and other vulnerable groups, there emerged consensus for change in the
law, then this could only be effected through Parliament. The police do
not modify, or make, law.
Although still to be persuaded that decriminalisation of illegal drug
use would be an effective remedy, I am prepared to accept that society's
perceptions constantly evolve and change. What is acceptable within some
cultures of New Guinea, for example, could be offensive to most western
societies. Yet our attitudes have shifted considerably in recent years.
However, I question the effectiveness of our parliamentary processes
today when required to deliver controversial change. Cross-fertilisation
and cross-breeding of policies mean that it is already very difficult to
pick a political party that can effectively represent the breadth of our
individual interests and concerns. And thus, when it comes to an
unwhipped or ''free'' vote in the Commons on sensitive issues, the
principles of democracy are stretched to the limit.
In effect, MPs exercise personal whims while the masses have no say in
the matter.

HELP! My life is going down the tubes! According to John Macleod (June
8) I am destined to become an ageing tramp with mentally and physically
abused children, living in a world of uncertainty and doubt. I, you see,
am guilty of a great evil, one that threatens society and cheapens sex.
I cohabit.
While I understand Mr Macleod's Christian rectitude and moral fear, I
feel that I must help educate the man while my mental faculties remain
in working order.
Since neither my partner nor I believe in all powerful entities, in
any shape or form, it would be hypocritical of us to marry in church.
The alternative civil ceremony would provide us with a certificate, but
also a feeling that we had changed our legal status for no other reason
than to satisfy a tradition.
We therefore chose to live together out of love of each other coupled
with a healthy respect for our beliefs, and not for any of the cynical
financial reasons put forth by John Macleod.
He postulates that ''without commitment, there can be no trust;
without trust, no security''. I feel that I am not alone in finding the
implication that living together does not constitute commitment,
scurrilous. There can be no greater pledge of devotion than choosing to
share every aspect of life with another human being, be it via a white
frock and hymns, or not.
The idea that a marriage ceremony keeps couples together has proved to
be erroneous, yet the inference that I, as a single woman, could easily
leave my partner at the first hint of disharmony is insulting and
inaccurate. My relationship to my partner contains the same emotional
and physical bonds as that of a wife to a husband.
As to John Macleod's fear for the welfare of my future children, I can
only promise him this: If his is an example of Christian understanding,
I shall proudly remain a non-subscriber. Perhaps then my children will
be raised to show tolerance and to respect choice.

QUITE the saddest article I have seen in The Herald over the years is
''Hearing told of dresses for boy'' (June 9).
If a mother, or a father for that matter, wanted a boy but did not get
one, nae problem. All they have to do is dress up the girl as a boy,
call her a tomboy and coo with delight -- as indeed the rest of society
does about this sort of practice.
So why the trauma over a boy dressed as a girl? Because we are still
not living in an equal society that is willing to put its money where
its mouth is.
The problem is that women primary school teachers not only allow girls
to dress as boys, but actively encourage them to in the play areas, so
that girls can get a feel for what being a boy, or doing a man's job
later, is like.
In very sharp contrast, any boy doing the converse is crucified in
public. We should be told why this monstrous double standard is allowed
to continue.
Incidentally, history is littered with examples of boys who were
dressed as and raised as girls, and who later became world famous, for
example the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke.

A RECENT decision by the University of Glasgow to create a position
specifically for the Principal-designate's wife must be met with
considerable suspicion.
Despite denials by the university that the new Principal had accepted
the position without preconditions it would appear that some
preferential treatment has been exercised. Since most university
appointments are subject to both interview and the production of
satisfactory references why is it that the new Principal's wife can
apparently ''walk into'' an academic appointment?
At a time when both undergraduate and postgraduate unemployment are
rife it would appear extremely inflammatory that an appointment should
be made without interview or referencing procedures having been
followed.
Irrespective of the fact that the new Principal's wife's career would
have been disrupted by her husband's move to Glasgow, any university
appointments should be on a basis of merit, and, indeed, also on the
need for provision of expertise in a specific subject area. It would
appear that the new Principal's wife has gained appointment to the
university on the basis of her husband's seniority and not on academic
merit.
There are several areas that are extremely difficult to reconcile
about this university appointment. First, all universities, including
Glasgow, operate a policy which promotes ''equality of opportunity''
which indicates that any vacancies should be advertised nationally and
therefore made available to a broad cross-section of society. Evidently,
there has been little in the way of equality or discretion exercised in
this particular appointment.
Secondly, the position of university Principal is not an impoverished
one and carries a number of privileges that many academics are unlikely
to experience throughout their careers. If the university Principal's
wife wishes to engage in both teaching and research, then she should do
so on an honorary basis, thus not gaining any financial remuneration and
participating in these activities as and when the department so
requires.
Many university departments have undergone considerable contracture
with the loss of many valued members of academic staff. They have done
so in response to research selectivity exercises and in some instances
have been forced to denude the nature of the work that they have been
engaged upon.
Absorbing a new staff member, because it is somehow viewed as being
''politically correct'', is unacceptable and only serves to incense, and
alienate, other members of staff and departments who are being forced to
restrict their activities due to ever-reducing budgets.
Hopefully, with time, the university will be able to produce some form
of satisfactory explanation for this appointment. Until then, both the
academic fraternity and the public will view this appointment as being
contrary to the aims and objectives of tertiary education with it being
seen as merely a means to securing the appointment of a new Principal.

THROUGH your correspondence columns, I would like to inform your
readers of the manner in which appointment of the non-executive
directorships to one NHS trust has taken place.
Last year, in anticipation of the inception of Argyll and Bute NHS
Trust, applications were invited from members of the general public to
fill the five non-executive directorships which were to be instituted.
With the support of many local people in Cowal, including GPs,
pharmacists, lawyers and a Justice of the Peace, I ventured to put my
name forward.
Eventually, after some considerable time, acknowledgement of the
receipt of my application was forthcoming; since then I have heard
nothing.
All information since has been derived from the columns of local
newspapers and that has merely named the five successful appointees,
whom I congratulate and wish every success for the future.
The selection would appear to have been effected behind a veil of
secrecy such as MI5 might very well envy. But then who ever suspected Mr
Ian Lang of an interest in openness and democracy?
I do consider that it might at least have been common courtesy on the
part of the trust to notify unsuccessful applicants directly.
I would sincerely like to thank all those supporters of my application
for the confidence which they placed in me.

DR DAVID CARVEL makes sweeping statements about the value of health
screening which serve to produce a distorted picture (June 8).
Contrary to his statements, Bupa indeed pioneered health screening in
this country and over the last 25 years has consistently provided a high
quality of service. Breast-screening, for example, was introduced by
Bupa some 10 years before the NHS.
Bupa's health-screening programme is developed and monitored with the
advice of widely acknowledged medical experts and no test is performed
which would put any individual at risk. The assessment of the value of a
screening test based upon its predictive value and number of false
positives and negatives is complex. Bupa assesses thoroughly the
research evidence for the benefits of any test before considering its
introduction.
Although the NHS provides some screening services, these are not
always offered at a frequency likely to achieve maximum benefit. For
example, the NHS encourages its general practitioners to offer cervical
screening every five-and-a-half years via a target remuneration system.
A wealth of research data shows that this is a less than ideal
situation and that cervical screening should be offered on a more
frequent basis to be effective. Bupa is able to provide cervical
screening annually.
Dr Carvel seems to miss the point that Bupa offers specific targeted
intervention to individuals rather than to whole populations. A Bupa
health screen lasts between two-and-a-half and three hours and includes
a 45-minute consultation with a doctor. A Bupa health screen identifies
any specific risks that the individual may be running and provides
detailed tailor-made advice to help promote good health for the future.

I READ with interest the report by Kirsty Scott (June 9) on the Morris
Cerullo meeting at the City Hall in Glasgow on Wednesday evening.
I believe that it is important for readers to know that what took
place at that event was genuine and the scenes which may have appeared
strange to some are perfectly normal to any Spirit-filled Christian. I
was present at the meeting and the audience consisted largely of members
of the Pentecostal Churches in the Glasgow area.
As many Christians know, miracles still happen today and Jesus heals
just as He did in New Testament times. I know this is difficult for some
people to accept but in the last few years I have seen many miracles and
healings which I would previously have not believed possible. These
include terminal cancer, ME, and other ''incurable'' diseases.
A friend received a miraculous healing for a neck injury caused by a
car accident, at the meeting. This was real and we give God all the
glory. Neither Morris Cerullo nor any other preacher heals. The power
comes from the Holy Spirit and it is as strong today as it was 2000
years ago.
On the subject of money I would like to emphasise that no-one had to
pay anything to attend. The voluntary offering went to cover the cost of
the hall, travel, and accommodation for the ministry team. There is an
attitude that American evangelists are only interested in money. There
have certainly been some problems with some but in my opinion most are
true men and women of God.
The article mentioned two young men who came forward but omitted to
say that around 50 other people of all ages also came to the front to
receive salvation that night.
We are on the brink of a Christian revival in Scotland at the present
time. All over the world there are signs of a fresh move to
Christianity. Although many people would disagree and many denominations
have declining memberships, the fact is that there has been a strong
growth in Spirit-filled Churches worldwide.
It is our prayer that our city will soon proclaim again as in years
past ''Let Glasgow Flourish, by the preaching of the Word and the
praising of His name''.

THAT glossy lure of golden beaches, swaying palms, and luxury cruisers
heading for idyllic islands inevitably adds an aura of glamour to the
travel trade which gets us there.
It also belies the sheer hard work and fierce competition within an
industry in which there has never been a scarcity of casualties, from
travel agents to tour operators and charter airlines.
But when these rivals get together they produce a curious cameraderie,
an ebullient banter which may recall the shared exploration of new
destinations and give hint of escapades better forgotten!
There is, in fact, a touch of showbusiness about travel people, a fact
which came back to me forcibly at the weekend as we dined royally at the
London Savoy.
The British travel industry was inaugurating its own Hall of Fame,
recognising five outstanding figures who played their own significant
part in shaping that post-war holiday boom.
We were really into the 1950s before currency relaxation made it
worthwhile to go abroad. So the comparative youth of the travel trade
means that many of the pioneers are still with us, albeit stretching
from their mid-seventies.
As an outsider, I observed and listened with some fascination to the
general tone of conversation around me. That someone had arrived back
from the Far East in time to attend this dinner and head off for the
United States was a matter of surprise to no-one.
A gent beside me let slip, without hint of a boast, that he had once
come close to buying the Queen Elizabeth, before it went to the Far
East. ''What a pity you didn't,'' I suggested, having seen that great
Scottish ship as she lay, burned out by fire-raisers, in Hong Kong
Harbour in 1972.
But suddenly, after dinner, our attention was focused on those five
giants of travel who would take their place at the very top of this Hall
of Fame. And what stories those pioneering spirits could tell.
Take Lord Forte, for example, ''wee Charlie'' who came from his native
Italy to the family cafe in Alloa before the First War. By 25 he was
opening a milk-bar in London but had reached the age of 50 before he
bought his first hotel, the London Waldorf.
Now, he was telling me, as he coasts towards his eighty-seventh
birthday, there are no fewer than 1160 hotels and 600 restaurants in a
worldwide Forte enterprise which sprang from that little Italian cafe in
Scotland.
It is hard to cast this chirpy little chap, who also pioneered airport
and motorway catering, as a colossus of the world's hotel and holiday
industry. But that is what he is.
The next recipient, Lord King, revolutionised British Airways at the
calling of Mrs Thatcher. When he was invited to the job, his wife
evidently said: ''Why are you taking on that?'' To which his lordship
replied: ''It is easier to take on an airline than to say no to
Margaret!''
Of the other pioneers honoured, Vladimir Raitz is the Russian-born,
former journalist with Reuters who struck on the idea of the inclusive
package tour and founded Horizon Holidays.
George Bates is the man who spotted the need for escorted tours,
especially to sites like the treasures of Egypt, and made a huge success
of his company.
But there was no story more poignant than that of Scotland's Jim
Moffat from Ayrshire, honoured among the giants as the man who founded
the travel agency of A T Mays, built it into one of the top four in
Britain -- and refused to move its headquarters from the little seaside
town of Saltcoats.
From breeding budgies as a young lad, Jim Moffat himself took flight
as a pilot in the Second World War, after which he returned to his job
as a bank clerk.
But, at the age of 35, he was still a disgruntled bank clerk, told by
his charming wife Margie that she could stand his moaning no longer.
He'd better find something else to do.
What else could he do? All he knew about was budgies! So he opened a
pet shop in Saltcoats, stocking one case of Kit-e-Kat and one of
Winalot. Margie would eke out the living in an adjacent hut, selling
rail tickets to Glasgow and boat tickets for people who were emigrating.
From that modest start they bought a shipping and travel shop in
Kilmarnock called Mays, wanted to register it as All Travel Mays but had
to meet the objection of the registrar of companies by using the
initials of All Travel.
Thus they created a person who didn't exist, A T Mays, when people of
greater vanity would have thrust their own name before the public. Jim
and Margie Moffat preferred the anonymity, proceeded to build up one of
the largest and most successful travel agencies of all time -- before
selling out to the Royal Bank several years ago.
Their son Jamie is still managing director of the company (now owned
by Carlson of America), while his parents live quietly, enjoying the
occasional cruise, gazing out on a magnificent view of Arran from their
home in West Kilbride -- and remembering that humble start in Saltcoats.
They also happen to be two of the most modest, contented, and
delightful people you could ever wish to meet.

DR Joseph Bradley's article (June 3), based on his book concerning
religious and ethnic identity, confirms one's belief that religious (or
is it tribal) bigotry has not greatly diminished in west central
Scotland.
In the not so distant past this now retired person recalls a period
before the expansion of personnel departments when one of the questions
asked by employers, including the former George Outram &amp; Co, a previous
owner of the Glasgow Herald, was ''Which school did you go to?''
As a result of the Education (Scotland) Act of 1918 which created
denominational schools it was extremely simple for those assigned to
hiring employees to exercise their prejudices.

WHISKY sales are wilting at home. It seems to be an unfashionable
drink for the young who apparently prefer imported spirits and vodka. It
is also heavily taxed by the state, though not more heavily taxed than
its direct competitors. There is a good case for reducing its tax
burden, something which seemed to be accepted by Nigel Lawson but which
was abandoned when Kenneth Clarke had to find a quick replacement for
the anticipated revenues lost when the second hike of VAT on domestic
fuel was abandoned last winter. Higher duties have accompanied lower
domestic sales so that the Treasury will soon be no better off. We may
be close to the proverbial madness attendant on killing the layers of
golden eggs.
Fortunately whisky is a trendy drink for the young in other countries.
It sells particularly well in France and Italy (in spite of fiscal
discrimination in favour of grappa) and has shown an ability to market
itself successfully in Spain and Greece. It also does very well in the
Far East generally and would do even better in Japan given a level
playing field permitting fair competition with (roughly) comparable
Japanese products.  This ability to sell well in hot countries when it
is so commonly associated here with the need to hold the damp and cold
at bay is something of a wonder. More prosaically, it is an outstanding
marketing success, so that possibly the main conundrum is the failure to
capitalise at home. The real problem is inescapably one of marketing.
There is, after all, no identifiable reason why American whiskies should
be able to do so well here except that they convincingly persuaded their
overwhelmingly young consumers of their appeal. Some spirits depend on
their blandness or tastelessness (vodka being a case in point) to sell
themselves with mixes. Whisky was slow to meet this challenge and may
even have been impeded by one of its positive attributes -- its distinct
personality. The main drawback seems to be its popular association with
age and the images of tweed and moors which, however well they do
abroad, do not ''click'' at home.
The answer must lie in the hands of the industry itself, and
especially its marketing men. It is, however, ill served by its
spokesmen who predict its demise within a decade unless British habits
change: by far the greater part of total production is exported.
Evidently others know, and enjoy, something too many natives are
missing.

THE Government's addition of 26p to the price of a bottle of whisky in
December has come under fire after sales figures revealed the industry
had suffered a 26% slump since January.
The Tory MP for Tayside, Mr Bill Walker, yesterday questioned the
wisdom of the move by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, adding that the loss of
millions of pounds to the industry came as no surprise.
Customs and excise figures, released through the Scotch Whisky
Association, showed that, between January 1, when the duty came into
force, and the end of March, 14 million bottles of whisky left bonded
warehouses in Scotland, compared with 19 million during the same period
last year.
The fall will cost the treasury #100m in lost excise-duty revenue. In
response, the association demanded the extra duty be withdrawn and
described the treasury as hopelessly inept. It also warned of job
losses.
A spokesman said 300 jobs had already been lost this year due to the
takeover of three distilleries by Whyte &amp; MacKay and restructuring at
Allied Distillers.
He added: ''Since the Tories came to power in 1979, 12,000 jobs have
been lost in the whisky industry.''
He said it was fortunate the UK market made up only 13% of sales, with
export revenue totalling around #2200m.

<HEADLINE>Tory chief urges self control.  Fraud inquiry into 'insider dealing'</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>BENEDICT BROGAN, POLITICAL REPORTER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977928441</RECORDNO>

THE Government last night refused to suspend dealings in executive
share options and called instead on directors of privatised utilities to
exercise ''self-control'', as the Serious Fraud Office announced it was
ready to investigate claims of insider dealing at PowerGen.
Tory Party chairman Jeremy Hanley said it was up to company executives
to exercise restraint in advance of Sir Richard Greenbury's report on
executive pay.
''What we need is for them to exercise self-control ahead of the
Greenbury committee. Some self-denying ordinances would be desirable,''
he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend.
However, despite an announcement from the SFO that it is considering
an investigation into claims in yesterday's Observer newspaper, about
share option dealing by PowerGen executives, Mr Hanley rejected Labour
calls for a ban on trading in share options as a first step in a full
independent inquiry into pay abuses.
PowerGen announced it was planning legal action against the Observer
and had instructed lawyers to prepare proceedings for defamation. A
statement said: ''Lawyers have been instructed to prepare proceedings
for defamation and, therefore, we shall not make any further public
comment at this stage.''
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown demanded legislation to end the tax
privileges on share options so they were taxed as income rather than as
capital gains.
''All of us, as consumers, are paying more money because of the
monopoly position they enjoy and the boardroom excesses that have taken
place. The public now wants action,'' he said.
''There should be a halt in all trading in executive share options
until a full inquiry actually exposes what has been going on in the
privatised utilities.''
However, Mr Hanley insisted the Government had acted by setting up the
Greenbury committee and the Prime Minister had said he would legislate
if necessary after receiving its report.
''Gordon Brown is being slightly mischievous in saying that the Prime
Minister has done nothing. The Prime Minister has made his position
absolutely clear,'' he said.
The allegations against PowerGen follow last week's revelation that
the Stock Exchange had asked the Treasury to reinvestigate the #4000m
sale, in March, of the Government's remaining shares in the two power
generating companies, PowerGen and National Power.
Ministers are accused of artificially depressing the share price by
withholding market-sensitive information. Ministers have denied any
wrongdoing and have promised to make the results of the Treasury
investigation public.
Yesterday, Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, called for
utilities to be subjected to greater scrutiny and public control than at
present.
''Huge pay increases and share options for directors have disgusted
the public. All this gluttony and greed brings the industries into
disrepute,'' he said.
''We believe in regulation in the public interest.'' Consumers must be
given a choice, he added.

THE claim by former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath that failing to
give Scots devolution will drive them towards a more militant expression
of discontent is unlikely to move the Tory party towards devolution,
leading activists said yesterday.
Sir Edward, although the elder statesman of the party, is no longer
regarded as having any real influence within it.
His comments in a Sunday newspaper are seen as simply justification
for his support for devolution in the sixties, and do not carry much
weight with present-day policy decision makers.
Conservative councillors, who took a mauling at the recent council
elections in Scotland, met in private on Saturday to discuss the way
forward for the party.
However, It is not thought that devolution was put forward as a way
out of the morass. Many councillors insist that devolution is mentioned
by very few of the electorate and is more of an issue among newspaper
leader writers than the man in the street.
Instead, many of the councillors want the party to reduce taxes,
improve the party's standing on law and order, and to give more help to
home-buyers in order to restore the faith of the party's natural
supporters.
They also want party leaders to listen more when the grass-roots warn
them that policies such as VAT on fuel would have a disastrous effect
among supporters.
Even Tory activists who support some form of devolution are suspicious
of the tax-raising Parliament which Labour is proposing. They accept
that, if the Conservative Party is to win back support by promising to
reduce the tax burden, it will at the same time attack the tax-raising
powers of Labour's proposed Parliament.
Meanwhile the Scottish Conservative Party's call for a wide-ranging
discussion on future policies is leading to a continual crop of
suggestions. The latest comes from prospective parliamentary candidate
Struan Stevenson, who suggests that an elected Scottish upper chamber
could take over from the House of Lords in scrutinising specific
Scottish Bills.
Whether the Conservative Party is willing to open the door to the
reform of the House of Lords simply to appease devolutionists is another
matter.
So far, Scottish party chairman Sir Michael Hirst is saying little in
public, preferring to go out to meet party members to hear their views
rather than impose a pre-set list of ideas.
He is likely to take the view, though, that reducing taxes and being
more responsive to ordinary party supporters will help the party more
than tinkering with the constitution.

<HEADLINE>Former diplomat denies Scott inquiry leak</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977928443</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FORMER Foreign Office diplomat yesterday denied leaking an extract
of Sir Richard Scott's draft arms-to-Iraq report.
Mr Mark Higson, who ran the Foreign Office Iraq desk, dismissed a
report in the Sunday Times that he had been the source of the BBC's
information.
He confirmed he had twice met Mr Graeme McLagan, the BBC reporter who
broke the story.
He said that although he had followed instructions and destroyed the
extract, he did have his notes on the report at his Solihull flat where
the meetings with Mr McLagan took place.
''Whether, when I went out to the loo or to make a cup of coffee, he
had a look at my notes on it, I can't say yea or nay to,'' he told the
Press Association.
The leak last week of the draft extract, which criticised the then
Foreign Office Minister, Mr William Waldegrave, for misleading MPs over
Britain's policy on defence sales to Iraq, provoked a political furore.
Mr Higson, who was involved in preparing letters to MPs on Mr
Waldegrave's behalf, was sent the 12-page extract by the inquiry team
after giving evidence during the hearings in 1993.
He refused to say whether he had discussed the contents of the extract
with Mr McLagan, a journalist he has known for a number of years.
Pressed on the matter, he said only: ''I do not believe that I am the
source of the leak.''
In his evidence Mr Higson, who was strongly critical of the Government
over its policy towards Iraq, said he believed the letters were
inaccurate and misleading.
The leak provoked an angry exchange between Sir Richard and the BBC,
with the inquiry's officials accusing the corporation of ''demeaning its
status and reputation''.
The disclosures came as it emerged that Treasury Chief Secretary
Jonathan Aitken is to face fresh demands for an explanation over his
role in the arms-to-Iraq affair.
During public hearings last year, the Scott inquiry heard evidence
suggesting that Mr Aitken, then a junior Defence Minister, signed a
Public Interest Immunity certificate seeking to withhold Government
documents from the defence in the Matrix Churchill trial.
The certificate was not used after Mr Aitken expressed reservations
because some of the documents also related to the BMARC company, of
which he used to be a non-executive director.
A replacement certificate was signed later by Defence Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind. Mr Aitken was, however, asked to provide written
evidence to the inquiry about the matter.

ANYONE wandering into the third level ballroom of the Hilton
International Hotel in Glasgow yesterday, would have been in for a big
surprise -- unless they were of course, arctophiles -- or to put it more
simply, teddy bear collectors.
On show was a display of about 1500 teddy bears, old and new, and of
varying shapes and sizes. Thirty-five exhibitors from across the UK, as
well as one from the US, displayed their bears -- some of which date
back to 1910.
About 500 collectors from across Scotland and the north of England --
including mummy, daddy, and a few baby bears -- attended the teddy bear
fair in the hotel organised by Growlies, a Renfrewshire-based specialist
teddy bear shop.
One of the organisers of the exhibition, Ms Christine Gribbin, 39,
from Johnstone, explained that yesterday's event had been held to
satisfy the demand of an increasing number of teddy bear collectors.
''There is no doubt that collecting teddy bears is becoming more
popular,'' she said. ''The teddy bear has a unique appeal to all. It is
a cuddly toy with character. Each has a different face and expression.''
The exhibitors included Mrs Sue Coe, 47, from California, whose unique
Shotzi bears are filled with copper coated steel balls. The 108 bears
she brought from her home in Monrovia weighed a total of 250lbs, and
sold from #75 to #175.
Asked if her trip had been worthwhile, she said: ''Even if I never
made a dime it would be worth it because I have met such wonderful
people.''
Mrs Janet Dunlop, 69, from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, who described
herself as an inveterate collector of bears, spent #200 on four of the
cuddly toys at yesterday's fair.
She admitted to having amassed about 1000 bears -- ''although it could
be substantially more'' -- during the seven years she has been
collecting.
She said: ''I am afraid to count how many I have. I really should be
slowing down at my age but I am encouraged by my husband and son to keep
buying them.''
Mrs Dunlop normally attends two teddy bear fairs and two auctions each
year, and keeps the bears in various places throughout her home.
Asked how her arctophilia started, she said: ''There is a certain
fascination. I have been a collector for many years of coins, ceramic
figures, and dolls. I suppose this was just a natural progression.''

<HEADLINE>Anger over Beckett's bid to scrap NHS reforms</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHADOW Health Secretary Margaret Beckett is under fierce attack from
her party's supporters and the Government over her proposal to scrap the
NHS reforms.
The row centres on Mrs Beckett's determination to abolish GP
fundholding and other key changes -- a position challenged by the Fabian
Society in a report to be published today.
Mr Neil Stewart, author of the document and former adviser to Mr Neil
Kinnock, said: ''GP fundholding has not put power in the hands of
patients as claimed by the Government but it has strengthened the power
of GPs in relation to hospital services.''
He said on the BBC1 programme On The Record: ''More patients are being
treated and there does appear to be, in the language of management
accountants, some productivity gain.
''This is not something which a serious government-in-waiting will
want to jeopardise.''
Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley also attacked Mrs Beckett's stand
and urged her to justify her proposals to abolish fundholders and other
key elements of the health shake-up.
In a statement, she said: ''It is clear that Labour Party health
advisers share a deep disquiet about Mrs Beckett's proposals.
''They see her rigid determination to abolish GP fundholding as highly
damaging. It would sacrifice patients to ideology and deprive family
doctors of their power in the new NHS. Thousands of fundholders, many
Labour supporters, are horrified by her plans.
''The plans are also fiercely opposed by academics like Professor
Howard Glennerster and Professor Brian Abel-Smith, who have been trying
to get Mrs Beckett to see the error of her ways.
''In the light of such fierce and well-informed criticism from within
her own ranks, it is time for Mrs Beckett to defend her position.''
The row has been sparked as Labour's National Policy Forum meet in
Reading to discuss health and four other key policy documents.
According to the BBC, Labour is planning to replace GP fundholding
with a new system of joint commissioning in which health authorities
take the lead, with GPs given only an advisory role.
Professor Glennerster, of the London School of Economics, who has
advised Labour on health, said that ending fundholding was the wrong
response to Labour's concerns about the two-tier system that had been
created.
He said: ''My argument has always been don't abolish the thing that's
working, spread the benefits to other people.''
Although the party plans to keep some form of purchaser-provider
split, Labour will get rid of the internal market, arguing that
competition would be replaced by co-operation.
Labour MP Hugh Bayley said yesterday: ''We don't need highly
cumbersome legal documents that specify what people will do. It should
be a process of co-operation and dialogue.''
Fabian Society research officer, Mr Stephen Pollard, said: ''The whole
issue of the future of the health service is a classic test of Old
Labour against New Labour.''

CAMELOT, the organisers of the National Lottery, yesterday apologised
to people ''inconvenienced'' by a computer failure which led to
difficulties in obtaining tickets for the draw for Saturday's #22.5m
jackpot.
A fault in a satellite link just before noon on Saturday --
traditionally the busiest day for ticket sales -- caused about 1000
ticket machines in shops throughout the UK -- 60 in Scotland -- to fail.
It may have cost the organisers tens of thousands of pounds in lost
sales.
Camelot initially said engineers traced the problem to the lottery
headquarters and the faulty equipment was replaced within 15 minutes.
However, it later confirmed machines had came back on line at various
times throughout the day and that 300 had still been out of action
between 6pm and 7pm. The deadline for buying a ticket is 7.30pm.
Some shop owners complained their machines had remained off for most
of the day.
A Camelot spokesman said: ''We would apologise to those people who
encountered difficulties obtaining tickets. As far as I am aware, most
of the faulty terminals were back on line before the close of play.''
He said technical faults had been ''very, very rare'' in the six
months that the lottery had been running and claimed that the firm
responsible for developing the technology which controlled ticket sales
had an ''exemplary track record'' which was well proven through its
involvement with 75% of the world's lotteries.
The spokesman added that the identity of the person who won the #22.5m
jackpot on Saturday was unlikely to be revealed. Another six people with
five numbers plus the bonus won #628,947, while those with five numbers
won #4408. The winning numbers were 12, 15, 26, 44, 46, 49, and the
bonus number 14.
There was also some confusion over the exact size of the rollover
jackpot after Camelot initially predicted #17.4m, only to revise the
figure by more than #5m yesterday. A spokeswoman explained there had
been far fewer winners of the guaranteed #10 prize this week, which had
left more money available for the jackpot.
* Lottery cash could be sought for a new development linking training
and housing for homeless youngsters. Edinburgh District Council has
backed the initiative which will involve a partnership of voluntary
groups, housing and employment agencies, and the private sector for the
French-style ''foyer''.
Incorporating shops, a restaurant, hotel or offices, it would provide
training or jobs for the youngsters living in bedsit-style
accommodation.

TEACHERS are softening their line on the Government's reform of upper
secondary schooling but taking a tougher stance on its scheme to give
college of education students more training in the classroom and less in
colleges.
Delegates attending the annual conference of the Educational Institute
of Scotland annual conference in Perth at the weekend rejected an
outright boycott of the Higher Still blueprint, which aims to build on
the present system of fifth and sixth year schooling and give academic
and vocational education equal status.
However, they voted to boycott versions of the Government's mentoring
scheme which had not be negotiated at local authority level.
The scheme is due to be introduced for the one-year postgraduate
course in August and will involve senior staff directly in monitoring
and assessing trainee secondary teachers.
On Higher Still, delegates gave the union's leadership a mandate to
talk to the Scottish Office about the reform, in recognition that it
would be implemented in some form.
The EIS still believes that the Government's timetable for
implementation, 1997, is unrealistic but it will seek to negotiate a
longer deadline and ''adequate'' resources and in-service training.
It also has concerns about the implications for class sizes, the way
classes are organised, and how class work is assessed in school.
The Government believes the timetable is tight but manageable and is
putting funds into it.
Proposing a boycott, Mr Bob Coleman, a teacher representing the
union's Lochaber association, said he was worried about the introduction
of a ''fast track'' through secondary for the most able pupils.
''This is inconsistent with the fundamental comprehensive nature of
Scottish education and is a direct threat to it,'' he said. The
Government says a ''fast track'' is not a priority.
Arguing against a boycott, incoming EIS president Malcolm Maciver said
those who wanted one were burying their heads in the sand.
Mr George MacBride, a teacher at Govan High School, Glasgow, and
convener of the union's education committee, said there were good points
in Higher Still -- the mixture of internal and external assessment,
certification for all, and many exit points for pupils.
However, the timetable was ''purely fantasy'' and there were major
implications for workload.
EIS general secretary Ronnie Smith said later that teachers would not
know the scale of the operation until August, when various groups would
report on the way subjects were to be organised.
The Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association has advised its members
not to volunteer for mentoring unless adequate resources are available.

BBC Scotland confirmed yesterday that it was considering a plan to
produce its own national and international television news programme
from Glasgow to replace the London-transmitted Six O'Clock News.
However, officials stressed that the idea was only one of a number of
proposals which were being put to the corporation as part of its
wide-ranging development strategy for the next 10 years. Nevertheless,
it represents a significant move towards greater autonomy by a BBC
Scotland which is still smarting from the recent Panorama local election
controversy and has been criticised in the past for being too tied to
its metropolitan masters.
Management at Queen Margaret Drive is acutely aware that, should
Labour win the next General Election, then its news and current affairs
remit would change dramatically with the promised devolution. This
latest news opt-out plan is merely a proposed response to such altered
circumstances.
The plan would involve BBC Scotland producing one single tea-time news
programme, mixing local and national news with selected reports from the
rest of Britain and abroad. Such a service would probably be popular
with Scottish licence payers because it would put paid to the natural
English bias on the national news.
It would also prevent the often ludicrous situation whereby important
Scottish stories are covered in depth in the main news and then covered
again -- in depth -- in the regional bulletin.
However, such a plan would involve a costly increase in resources and
manpower, although that could be partly offset by the economies made
from BBC Scotland's streamlining of its radio and TV news service.
Still, it would be unlikely, given its resources, that BBC Scotland
could sustain its service to provide a replacement for the main Nine
O'Clock News. The corporation also would be reluctant to allow its
flagship news programme to be ''regionalised''.
Denying reports that the new service could be in place within two
years, a senior official at BBC Scotland said: ''It is, of course, the
normal activity for any organisation in a period of rapid change to be
constantly looking at how it can deliver its services more efficiently
and provide the best possible programmes for its viewers and listeners.
''In this rapidly changing broadcasting environment, it is crucial
that the BBC addresses these issues with a view to keeping one step
ahead of our competitors. We have been looking ahead taking a 10-year
perspective and various ideas concerning our news coverage have emerged
from our discussions. These are part of a range of options being
discussed.''
Keith Sinclair writes: The SNP has called for a rejection of all
applications for the new Channel 5 television licence because of what it
calls the unsatisfactory nature, particularly the ''London bias'', of
the current bids.
Mr Paul Scott, the SNP's art and broadcasting spokesman, replying to
Mr Brian Marjoribanks, Officer for Scotland of the Independent
Television Commission, said yesterday that it has been widely agreed
that existing television services were greatly over-centralised in
London and excessively dominated by metropolitan concerns.
He said: ''The Broadcasting for Scotland campaign has been vocal and
effective in arguing this case with regard to the BBC but, up until now,
there has been a recognition that ITC companies -- because of the
regional and national structure within the ITC licence agreements --
have been somewhat more sensitive to the diversity of the United
Kingdom. In particular, the Scottish licencees have been much more
willing and able to produce distinctive services.

LABOUR'S women activists, determined they will not be fobbed off with
a less than winnable seat at the next General Election, yesterday
condemned Scottish party executive member, Mr Jim Stevens, for what they
believe was intemperate language used to discredit leading left-wing
activist, Ms Rosina McCrae.
They said the attack was part of a campaign to discredit her, so that
she does not win a nomination for a parliamentary seat.
Their anger may derail the plan by Scottish Labour Party general
secretary, Mr Jack McConnell, to complete the selection process for
parliamentary candidates with as little controversy as possible.
Leading members of the Scottish Labour Women's Caucus are saying they
will not be happy simply accepting Aberdeen South as a seat where there
will be an all-women shortleet.
Instead, they will insist on Aberdeen North, or Motherwell South,
which could unleash a backlash from male party members.
The controversy dates back to Labour agreeing that half the winnable
seats without a Labour MP should have all-women shortleets from which
local party members would choose their candidates.
In Scotland, six seats fall into the category. The policy was designed
to correct an imbalance with so few women Labour MPs.
Mr McConnell seemed on course to finding three constituencies which
would volunteer to have all-women shortleets when both Stirling and Ayr
constituencies voted to do so. The third is expected to come from
Aberdeen where the present two seats are being divided into three by
boundary changes.
Sitting MP, Mr Bob Hughes, appears to be hedging his bets about which
seat he wishes to stand for. This is slowing up the process.
The least winnable of the three for Labour is Aberdeen South and there
are suggestions that male activists in Aberdeen will volunteer the South
seat for the all-woman shortleet, helping Mr McConnell to fulfil his
quota and leaving it to Mr Hughes and former MP Frank Doran to fight it
out over the more favourable remaining two seats.
Last week, Mr Stevens attacked the policy and accused fellow executive
member Ms McCrae and her supporters of being a ''shameless parade of
quota queens''.
His remarks have disturbed members of the Scottish Labour Women's
Caucus who believe they were directed at Ms McCrae whose left-wing
feminist stance has won few friends in the party's hierarchy, many of
whom would be happy if she herself did not win any of the nominations.
Mr Stevens's remarks were discussed at Labour's Scottish executive
meeting on Saturday and party chairwoman, Mrs Rhona Brankin, is seeking
a meeting with Mr Stevens to discuss his verbal attack.
* Former Liberal Democrat MP Nicol Stephen has been selected as his
party's prospective parliamentary candidate in the new Aberdeen South
constituency, taking more than 90% of the votes in a four-way contest.
The party is expected to make a stong challenge for the seat, which
takes in approximately half of the former Kincardine and Deeside seat.

MORE than 70 lecturers in further and higher education are facing
redundancy as colleges seek savings to make up for big cuts in their
grants from Government.
The hardest-hit institution is St Andrew's College in Glasgow, which
is responsible for Roman Catholic teacher education in Scotland.
The higher education college aims to reduce academic staff numbers by
30 over the next 12 months, representing a 33% cut in lecturing staff.
In further education, Falkirk College wants to lose 21 academic staff.
About 16 lecturers have accepted terms.
At Jewel and Esk Valley FE college in Dalkeith, West Lothian, numbers
are to be reduced by 20. In higher education, Glasgow School of Art may
seek four redundancies.
It is hoped the targets can be met by voluntary redundancy but there
are concerns there may be four or five compulsory redundancies at Jewel
and Esk college. It would the first time compulsory redundancy has been
used in the sector.
Officials in the Educational Institute of Scotland, which represents
eight out of 10 academic staff in further education, higher education
colleges, and the ''new'' universities through its college and
university lecturers' associations, have been given powers to implement
a ballot on industrial action.
To date, only Falkirk College has sought authority for a ballot but it
does not want to hold one at this stage. Lecturers at Jewel and Esk will
review their position if compulsory redundancies are announced.
Lecturers at St Andrew's College are preparing a political campaign to
highlight the threat to Catholic teacher education by the demand for a
33% cut in staffing.
Mr Jack Dale, the EIS assistant secretary responsible for further and
higher education, said the union would take appropriate action to defend
members. He said: ''Further and higher education face structural
problems and we will do our best for our members and to resolve the
problems by voluntary means.''
In further education, lecturers had lost national bargaining, with pay
and conditions being determined at plant level. Mr Dale accused Jewel
and Esk college of delaying recognition of the union to avoid consulting
officials about its problems.
Hard-left delegates attending the EIS annual conference in Perth at
the weekend called for an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis. They
also wanted a one-day national strike against any compulsory
redundancies. However, that would be unlawful because individual
colleges are now responsible for negotiations on this and other issues.
Further education is moving more to a system of formula-funding, with
institutions which attract more students in areas which the Government
views as priorities being rewarded with bigger grants at the expense of
other colleges.
More are expected to produce cost-saving measures as the impact of the
funding system and the loss of direct local authority aid hits home.
Mr Dale said that, in higher education, colleges of art and education
felt hard done by. ''They feel that the formula does not recognise the
kind of teaching they do,'' he said.
They want the level of grant for teaching to be upgraded to take
account of the fact that they are involved in small-group workshop
teaching, which is more expensive.
It is understood the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council sent
back the first business plan which it asked St Andrew's to produce
because it was too optimistic.
Mr Dale said the colleges of education feared that additional money,
which the Government had allocated for the new scheme to give teacher
trainees more learning time in the classroom, would disappear after two
years with the cost of the initiative being trimmed from college budgets
and given to schools thereafter.
He said: ''There seems to have been a fall-off in the amount of
development work allocated to colleges, with the Scottish Office
Education Department diverting money into schools to support mentoring.
But the main issue has been the withdrawal of the safety net from St
Andrew's funding.''

THE giant hole out of which the heart of Aberdeen was hewn seems set
to become a visitor attraction for the second time.
Rubislaw Quarry, which was the main source for the creation of the
granite city, has lain empty and partly flooded for more than a quarter
of a century and, on safety grounds, the public have been excluded.
Now, Aberdeen District Council and Grampian Enterprise are
investigating the possibility of creating a walkway and viewing point to
enable Aberdonians and tourists to see the quarry.
The quarry is almost 500ft deep, 900ft long and 750ft wide. Out of it
has come the blue grey granite which built not only many of Aberdeen's
finest buildings, but also Rennie's Waterloo Bridge in London, the Bruce
monument at Bannockburn, and Dumbarton's municipal buildings.
The quarry started production in 1740, but in 1969, when it had become
too costly to produce the granite, it was closed.
Consultants appointed by Grampian Enterprise identified three possible
options for the quarry. According to the consultants, although many
local people may never have actually seen the quarry they would not like
to see it lost or inappropriately used, as it is part of the city and is
held dear for that reason.
The suggested options are:
* development of an interpretative centre;
* a commercially orientated development incorporating an
interpretative element;
* or a small-scale interpretative centre.
The first two have virtually be ruled out because they would cost
between #2m and #3m, and the council has now agreed to match #5000
allocated by Grampian Enterprise to investigate the third, the creation
of a basic and partly-covered interpretative walkway around part of the
perimeter of the quarry. The viewpoint would consist of a high granite
wall with openings in a zig zag pattern to allow views in different
directions.
The consultants anticipate construction would cost between #100,000
and #200,000, a further #75,000 would have to be set aside for artefacts
and displays; annual maintenance costs would be between #6000 and
#10,000 and #46,000 would be needed to drain the quarry.
* Plans to create a multi-million pound project in Argyll to celebrate
Scotland's craftsmanship in stone throughout the ages could mean vital
tourist jobs in the West Highlands.
Argyll and Bute District Council and Argyll and the Islands Enterprise
have been approached for financial assistance through the Millennium
Fund and the EC.
Entitled Stone Stories, the project is a three-stage scheme which aims
to combine an exhibition of Scotland's heritage in stone, a sculpture
park, and a stone workshop equipped with the latest machinery.

MORE than 60 bookings have been made at Edinburgh's #38m international
conference centre -- bringing an expected #22m in business to the city.
Last night, the centre management revealed they were set to secure
another 90 conferences for the centre, which will open in September.
Bids are also in for a further eight international conferences with up
to 1500 delegates.
A spokeswoman for the centre said: ''We're on target for our first
conference on September 17.''
More than 50 full-time staff will be employed at the building off
Lothian Road and the spokeswoman added: ''We've got 63 conferences
booked so far, between 1995 and 2003, and the estimated value of that
business is #22m.
''And we're very close to final confirmation of another 90. ''We're
also bidding for eight international association conferences in the next
two months, with up to 1500 delegates at each, but face opposition from
London, Vienna, and Strasbourg.''
She said the centre had won the contract for the European Association
for Carnio-Maxillosacial Surgery in September 2000, adding. ''The worth
of that conference alone to the capital is estimated at #720,000.''
The spokeswoman said: ''We're delighted with the way business is
coming in.
''People want to come to Edinburgh and to the new conference centre
and we believe we're making a big impact.''

SCOTLAND'S first gene therapy trial begins in Edinburgh today amid
rising hopes that the technique may help provide a cure for cystic
fibrosis by the end of the decade.
It involves use of tiny fatty particles, liposomes, to carry a correct
gene copy to replace the faulty gene which causes the disease.
Scientists in Edinburgh demonstrated two years ago that such therapy
could work when used on mice.
The trial, based at the Western General Hospital, is a collaborative
venture between the Medical Research Council, Edinburgh University, the
NHS, and a German pharmaceuticals company.
It follows the first UK trial at the Royal Brompton in London which
showed the liposome method was safe and worked, although only weakly and
for a few days.
''What we are trying to do is make it work a lot better,'' said
Professor David Porteous, of the MRC Human Genetics Unit in Edinburgh.
''Our laboratory results suggest that the improved formula should have
a longer-lasting effect and be at least as effective as that in the
Brompton study.''
Using the resources of the drugs firm, Boeheringer Mannheim, which has
its UK base at Livingston, the team hopes to make faster progress in
developing a treatment which can be used for patients.
''It is not a breakthrough, but it is definitely establishing the core
of expertise that is necessary to carry this through,'' Professor
Porteous commented.
''It will not be a one-off trial. I think what we will see is an
evolving series of trials, transferring the refinements and improvements
that we see in the laboratory into clinical work, so that at the end of
the day we will have something of genuine clinical benefit.
''The timescale we are working to is to bring this through within the
next five years.''
Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal inherited condition caused by
a single gene defect in northern Europe and the USA. It affects around
600 families in Scotland and 30,000 in Europe.
The Edinburgh trial will involve sufferers, half of which will be
given the treatment and the other half a placebo to act as a control to
measure its effectiveness.
The gene mixture and liposome will be introduced initially to tissues
in the nose, and if this proves successful, to the lungs.
Similar work is planned by a joint team at Oxford and Cambridge, using
a slightly different form of DNA from the Brompton trial.
Other scientists in France and the USA have attempted to use viruses
to deliver gene therapy, but the American effort is now also switching
to liposomes for a trial in Alabama, due to start later this year.
''From the point of view of cystic fibrosis families, all of this is
extremely good news,'' Professor Porteous said.
''There are a number of different approaches to the problem and the
probability is that one, if not more, is going to be succesful.''
The Edinburgh research was also funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust
and its equivalent in France. Scientists hope it will be of benefit in
developing gene therapy in other areas, particularly brain tumours, and
the hundreds of inherited diseases.
''We have had a lot of interest in our work from European clinicians.
We hope that it will be possible to build a European trial from the
Scottish one. It is good to see Scotland playing a major part in such
pioneering research,'' Professor Porteous added.
Professor Chris Edwards, dean of medicine at Edinburgh University and
a member of the MRC council, said: ''Gene therapy offers the prospect of
a much more effective treatment for this disease, one of the most common
causes of death and disability in the young.
''The next stage is to refine our methods and work towards a practical
treatment for people with this debilitating and fatal condition.''

THREE people were arrested yesterday in connection with a firebomb
attack which caused #40,000 damage at an abattoir.
The three -- a 29-year-old woman and two men aged 25 and 26 -- were
held after a police investigation into the arson attack on meat traders
A F Ensor in the Forest of Dean early yesterday.
Police said they could not rule out a link with animal extremists but
refused to comment on whether the three people arrested were members of
any organisation.
Arsonists planted more than 20 incendiary devices to spark fires which
wrecked two lorries and damaged a another three vehicles parked at the
premises in Valley Road, Cinderford.
Some of the devices failed to ignite and were later dealt with by Army
explosives experts.

A REVOLUTION in the treatment of children with arthritis is helping
most of them to grow out of the disease unscathed.
Juvenile chronic arthritis, which affects one in 1000 children in the
West of Scotland and formerly left a legacy of crippled joints and
stunted growth, now often ''burns out'' by adulthood.
Teamwork by doctors, nurses, and therapists at the Royal Hospital for
Sick Children in Glasgow, helped by a constantly expanding range of
drugs, is helping 70% of sufferers to get better before they reach
adulthood. Joint replacement surgery offers hope for the rest.
This achievement will be acknowledged next week during National
Arthritis Week, which is to focus on the 15,000 children in the UK with
arthritis.
Consultant Dr Krishna Goel and his colleagues currently treat more
than 120 children at regular clinics at Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow.
Ten years ago these children would have had to attend hospital in the
South of England, being detained for days at a time.
Treatment depends on preventing the children's joints from becoming
destroyed by inflammatory arthritis while at the same time keeping them
supple and moving. Swimming is very often part of the prescription.
''To get the joints to grow strong and true they often need to wear
very light plastic splints at night,'' Dr Goel explained. ''But we
encourage them to move around and take as much exercise as possible
during the day. This prevents their joints from seizing up and becoming
rigid.''
The inflammation can also damage the eyesight of children, but in most
cases the hospital has kept this at bay.
Another problem is stunted growth, caused either by the disease itself
or by some of the drugs which must be used. Steroids are one of the
causes, also causing osteoporosis in some children, but these problems
are being overcome by minimising the dosage.
Dr Goel and his team also have a new weapon in a drug, originally used
for cancer, called methotrexate. This has helped children who did not
respond to other drugs and were already staring to suffer erosion in the
joints.
The Arthritis and Rheumatism Council commented: ''We applaud Glasgow's
success. Far too many people regard arthritis as an old people's disease
about which very little can be done.''

FILM director Michael Winner admitted yesterday he pretended he was
homosexual to avoid his compulsory two-year military service.
He disclosed his 40-year-old secret as the legal battle rages on over
the Ministry of Defence ban on homosexuals in the armed services.
He confessed that having heard that homosexuals were not admitted into
the Army he ''rather naughtily went to a psychiatrist and told him I was
gay''.
But Tory MP Sir James Spicer, a former major in the Parachute
Regiment, said it was ''unbelievable'' that anyone should boast about
avoiding military service in this way.
Mr Winner made the admission in his column in the News of the World,
under the heading: ''My gay secret! I pretended so I could dodge Army.''
He said: ''I'd already passed A1 in London, got deferred to go to
Cambridge and suddenly faced, again, the prospect of two years in the
Army. That was near the end of National Service.
''Thousands of young men were draining the country's resources. There
was so little for them to do. Soldiers were painting coal white at
Catterick Army camp. I didn't fancy that at all.''
Mr Winner went on: ''I'd heard if you were homosexual they didn't let
you in. Rather naughtily I went to see a psychiatrist in London and told
him I was gay.''
After several sessions, he was given a letter and sent to an Army
medical.
''I went round my Army medical clutching the letter and at the end an
old colonel at a table said: 'Which service do you want to be in,
Winner?'
'''Er, I think you should see . . .' and I produced my letter. His
face was a picture of total contempt.
'''How long have you been feeling like this, Winner?' he asked.
'''About eight weeks,' I replied.
''That was it. I never got to paint coal white at Catterick. The
nation was saved the expense of keeping me for two years. I think I did
everyone a great favour.''
But Sir James, 69-year-old MP for Dorset West, said: ''As someone who
'rearranged' by four months my date of birth to get into the Army early,
I find it unbelievable and astonishing that someone should boast about
an attitude like this.''

THOUSANDS of pupils throughout Scotland are waiting anxiously for
their Standard Grade exam results to be announced in August, but Bob
Moffat received his last week.
What surprised him, however, was that the news had taken six years to
arrive.
Mr Moffat, 21, of Swinton, Berwickshire, received the missive from the
Scottish Examination Board. It told him he had failed the German
examination he sat in 1989 at Berwickshire High School.
Mr Moffat, who works for a building firm, said yesterday: ''I took
other subjects and those results came through the usual way. But I was
told that the German results would take longer to be announced because
of some hold-up. They certainly did!
''I left school that summer and when I heard nothing I assumed I had
done so badly that they hadn't bothered to send on the result.
''After a while, I forgot about it and when I opened the envelope last
week I had to laugh.''
A spokesman at the Scottish Examination Board said: ''It is the first
time I have ever heard of someone getting their results six years after
sitting the exam. We will look into it.''

<RECORDNO>977928470</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE rights of crofters and the issue of landownership reform in the
Highlands have been raised at the United Nations -- much to the
embarrassment of British Government officials.
The subject was brought to the attention of ministers and officials
from more than 50 countries at a meeting of the influential Commission
on Sustainable Development, which was astonished at how few rights the
indigenous communities have over the land, and the ability of foreign
nationals to buy land.
The commission met in New York to progress strategies agreed at the
Rio Earth Summit, and an opportunity was given to non-governmental
bodies to send representatives to the meeting.
It was examining ways of sustainable development of agricultural land
and rural areas, forestry, and mountain areas.
Mr Bill Ritchie, of the Assynt Crofters' Trust, who was invited by the
Scottish Environmental Forum to attend the meeting, said: ''While the
Assynt Crofters' Trust is in the fortunate position of owning its own
land, much of the Highlands and Islands is not.
''I was not given the chance to speak but I was allowed to ask a
question. The British Government had been emphasising to developing
countries how important it was for their own people to be given
ownership and control over their own land and assets.
''I asked one of the British civil servants in the UK delegation if he
was aware of what was going on in Scotland, how the land is bought and
sold at highly inflated prices, by often faceless foreign nationals,
leaving crofters only the grazing rights.
''These landowners can then take advantage of Government grants and
tax breaks, which are not available to the crofter.
''I asked him how sustainable development could take place if crofters
did not own the mineral rights, and the right to water, and so on. There
was a stunned silence.''
According to Mr Ritchie, delegates from other EU countries, in
particular, were astonished that large tracts of land could be bought
and sold with no community involvement in their management, and with no
rights for local communities.
''The Danish minister came up to me and said, 'you couldn't do that in
my country'. I pointed out to him that the owners of Legoland have
bought an estate in Strathconon, and are now eligible for grants.''

JACOBITES were on the march again in the Highlands yesterday at the
start of a 200-mile charity walk to mark the 250th anniversary of the
beginning of Bonnie Prince Charlie's rebellion.
The Prince -- played by Mr Mike Newcomen, 32, of the White Cockade
Society -- was rowed ashore at Glenfinnan in the West Highlands to greet
around 1000 walkers.
The organisers of the re-enanctment of the Prince's sortie with his
army of clansmen from Glenfinnan, Inverness-shire, to the Palace of
Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh are billing it as ''Scotland's biggest
charity event'', with an expected 5000 walkers raising #250,000 for nine
charities.
Yesterday, clan chiefs and tartan-clad ''Jacobites'' were on hand as
the walkers were led from the National Trust memorial to the Prince's
1745 landing by Jimmy MacGregor and American broadcaster Kate Cronkite,
daughter of Walter.
The walk, via Perth, Stirling, and Falkirk, will take 14 days and
participants will be sponsored or donate #15 to the organisers,
Bighearted Scotland, for each of the daily 15-mile stages.

A PRISON governor's decision to ban inmates from watching three plays
because they contain swearing and violence brought angry protests from
campaigners yesterday.
Prisoners at Ashwell jail in Leicestershire were performing short
works by the acclaimed playwright Harold Pinter.
They have now been called off, however, following the intervention of
the governor, Mr Henry Reed.
The plays, Mountain Language, One For The Road, and Victoria Station,
had been in rehearsal for weeks before Mr Reed banned them because they
contained swearing and references to torture and child murder.
''They are inappropriate for preparing inmates for life on release,''
he added.
However, Mr Peter Moore, of the Derby-based pressure group Prison
Watch, described the ban as ''outrageous''.
He said yesterday: ''It is tremendously narrow-minded on the part of
the governor. It says a lot about the senseless screw-downs taking place
on prisoners at the present time.
''Harold Pinter is a well-known playwright. His plays are performed
all over the world and for inmates to be taking an interest in his
plays, I would have thought was a positive step in their lives.
''What we have got to prepare inmates for is the real world outside.
The inmates need to educate the governor, to be honest.''
The prison's part-time drama teacher has resigned over the decision,
insisting that worse language is heard in the prison every day.

JACOBITES looking for a new Pretender take heart. A retired optician
in Australia is petitioning the British Government and the European
Commission for the return of all the Scottish lands and titles he is due
as King of the Scots.
Mr Ian Stewart Vernal, who claims he was confirmed as heir to the
Scottish throne by a representative of the Queen in a secret ceremony 30
years ago, has established his court and initiated action to claim his
inheritance.
From the Court of Saint Germaine-en-Laye -- its address is a postbox
in Hazelbrook, New South Wales -- Mr Vernal has written to the Prime
Minister, the Scottish Secretary, and the Prince of Wales to press his
case.
Mr Vernal joins a German prince and a man in an Edinburgh bedsit --
Prince Michael Stuart of Albany -- on the list of those claiming the
Stuart succession. Although he styles himself ''Prince and High Steward
of Scotland de jure King of Scots'', he lives on social security and
depends on generous friends to print the lion-rampant crest on his court
stationery.
His detailed letters to Downing Street and Buckingham Palace have so
far elicited only a terse note from the Prince of Wales's solicitors at
Farrer &amp; Company, who suggest his claim ''is not well founded''.
Mr Vernal -- or King Ian I as he would become should he ever make it
to Scone -- has never set foot in Scotland. His father emigrated to
Australia from Renfrew and, according to Mr Vernal, always insisted the
family was descended from the royal blood of the House of Stuart.
He discovered his destiny from a woman claiming to be a member of the
Greek royal family and a close relative of the Duke of Edinburgh, who
presented herself to the young Ian Vernal in the early sixties as an
agent for what he describes as the Crown secret service.
She trained him as an agent and, in a ritual ceremony, presented him
with a nine-carat gold signet ring, a poem, and the news that the Queen
had approved him as heir to the throne of Scotland.
Mr Vernal is reluctant to name the woman, with whom he has lost
contact. He admits that by going public he risks ridicule. ''I'm well
aware that with this story I can make a complete idiot of myself,'' he
said. ''I have got nothing at my stage in life to win out of this. The
last thing I want is public notoriety.''
He says he is doing it for the people of Scotland who have been
cheated out of what is rightfully theirs. He has asked the Government to
confirm that the wealth of the Scottish crown is being held in trust and
that the accounts have been frozen.

CIGARETTES, newspapers and chocolate were last night sent into a house
where police negotiators were continuing to talk to a suspected gunman
who took two women hostage nearly 24 hours ago.
Negotiators have been talking to the man since Saturday night in the
hope that he will give himself up.
A senior officer at the scene said he was optimistic the siege would
end safely. Police have also spoken to the two women and say the
atmosphere appears ''reasonably calm''.
Marksmen are in position around the house on the Orchard Park estate

ONE of the greatest escapes in history will be recalled this week at
Traquair House in Innerleithen.
The occasion is the launch of a book about Winifred Herbert, fifth
Countess Nithsdale, of Terregles, Dumfries, who freed her husband,
William, from the Tower of London one day before he was due to be
executed for his part in the 1715 Jacobite rebellion.
Flora Maxwell Stuart, of Traquair, author of Lady Nithsdale and the
Jacobites, researched archives in Scotland, England, Wales, France, and
Belgium, including the Stuart Papers at Windsor and the letters of the
fourth Countess of Traquair, Lady Nithsdale's sister-in-law.
The 180-page, illustrated book was produced by Her Majesty's
Stationery Office and sells at #12.95. At the launch on Wednesday, the
cloak worn by Lord Nithsdale when he made his escape will be on view for
the first time at Traquair.
Lady Nithsdale, daughter of the third Baron Powis, went into exile
with her parents in France after the defeat of the last Stuart king,
James II of England. It was there that she met and married William, the
fifth Earl of Nithsdale, and returned with him to his tower house near
Dumfries.
A Catholic and Jacobite, the earl took up arms in support of the Old
Pretender in 1715 but was captured by government troops at Preston. He
and six other peers were taken to London and locked in the Tower.
During his journey south, Nithsdale had managed to send a letter to
his wife at Terregles. Despite appalling winter weather, she set off
with her companion, Cecelia Evans, for London.
Through bribery, she was allowed a short visit with her husband in the
Tower.
On February 9, he and the other Jacobite peers were arraigned before
Parliament on a charge of high treason and ordered to be decapitated on
February 24.
After unsuccessfully petitioning the King, the countess devised a plan
to secure her husband's release. She went to the Tower where she won
over the guards by pretending her petition had been granted and pressing
a few coins into their hands. The next day -- the eve of the execution
-- she returned with her friends, Mrs Mills and Mrs Morgan, and was
given premission to take them in to see her husband, one at a time.
First, she led in Mrs Morgan who was wearing an extra coat and dress
which she took off and left in the room. The countess then escorted her
out and brought in Mrs Mills who was sobbing into a hankerchief as she
passed the guards.
Mrs Mills immediately took off her coat and dress, put on the clothes
left by Mrs Morgan and went back down the stairs.Meanwhile, the earl
dressed in Mrs Mills's discarded clothes.
He then buried his face in Mrs Mills's handkerchief, he was led by his
wife past the guards.
He escaped to France where he died in 1744.

<HEADLINE>Greenpeace pledge as Shell tows oil platform to a watery grave in Atlantic.  Move to scupper Brent Spar dumping</HEADLINE>

SHELL last night began towing the disused Brent Spar oil platform from
the North Sea for dumping in the deep waters of the Atlantic as
environmental activists pledged to do everything in their power to
scupper the plan.
The oil giant warned that any attempt to interfere with the 140-mile
tow could have ''severe consequences''.
The start of the tow came at the end of a day when bad weather forced
a stand-off between Greenpeace campaigners and workers trying to prepare
the platform for removal from its site 110 miles north-east of Shetland.
On Saturday, activists in inflatable boats had clashed with workers
lifting anchor chains from the oil platform.
Protesters yesterday stepped up their preparations to foil Shell's
plan. A second and bigger Greenpeace vessel, the Dutch-registered
chartered motor yacht Altair, arrived in Lerwick last night to aid the
protesters aboard the Moby Dick.
Arriving with the Altair was Mr Jonathan Castle, ''Captain
Greenpeace'' who led the 24-day occupation of the former oil-loading
terminal which ended with protesters being forcibly evicted three weeks
ago. He is preparing to follow it to the planned dump site, 150 miles
north-west of the Hebrides.
The Altair is equipped with a helideck and campaigners have said that
they will carry a helicopter on board for surveillance and possible
other uses as it shadows the tugs on the tow to the Atlantic.
The yacht is carrying drums of aviation fuel and the crew were last
night rigging safety nets on the helideck in readiness for the arrival
of a 'copter from England.
Late last night, a spokesman for Shell UK Exploration and Production
said the operation to dispose of the redundant Brent Spar was
''continuing on schedule''. The task of releasing it froms its anchors
had been completed and the tow had started at about 9pm.
Greenpeace campaigners at Lerwick said they heard an explosion which
they took to be the final severing of the platform's sole remaining
anchor chain, but could not yet establish if its final journey had
begun.
''There isn't very much we can do, as we are very limited with our
small ship, the Moby Dick, against six vessels used by Shell,'' said a
spokesman.
''We are not really able to interfere with inflatables -- but we are
not giving up and the battle is not yet over.''
The protesters argue that sea-dumping poses an environmental hazard
and could set a precedent for the disposal of other North Sea oil
installations, but Shell insists that the plan carries minimal
environmental risks.
''The company advises that any attempt to interfere with the tow could
have severe consequences,'' warned the Shell spokesman.
''Loss of the tow could endanger other installations or shipping. It
could also lead to the grounding of the Spar at an unplanned shallow
water location, which is inherently more environmentally sensitive.''
At the designated disposal site, the water was more than 1.5 miles
deep and the environmental impact at such a location would be
''negligible'', he said.
The spokesman added that during planned preparatory work, carried out
from the multi-purpose vessel Stadive over recent weeks, more than 100
tonnes of material had been removed from the Spar.
This had included waste lubricating oil, batteries which contained
cadmium and lead, light bulbs containing mercury, a crane boom and
loading boom, hoses, a shelter, household equipment -- and, he claimed,
20 tonnes of items left behind by Greenpeace.
''The work was inspected and audited by officials from the Scottish
Office. The Spar was also visited by a representative of the Health and
Safety Executive, who confirmed that the work was being carried out in
compliance with the agreed safety case; a representative of Lloyd's, the
certifying authority; and a representative of the Marine Safety Agency
who, in conjunction with the warranty surveyor, gave permission for the
tow to the disposal site to begin.''
Greenpeace spokesman Chris Rose said earlier yesterday: ''Every step
of the towing and dumping operation is dangerous but the worst is still
to come. It is the final step that will pose most danger to the marine
environment, when the flotation tanks of Brent Spar are blown and more
than 130 tonnes of dangerous toxic waste are sunk with it.
''We will stay with the Brent Spar to monitor, expose, and, wherever
possible, take non-violent action to stop this nightmare dump.''

UNISON general secretary Alan Jinkinson last night criticised leaders
of the rival Royal College of Nursing for breaking ranks in the pay
dispute involving around 900,000 NHS workers.
He also pledged the union's #10m industrial action fund would be
available to prosecute the dispute on behalf of the 440,000 Unison
members who are protesting at the inadequate 1% national offer plus
possible local top-up payments.
Mr Jinkinson accused his RCN counterparts of going against their
members' wishes and appealed to RCN members to put pressure on them to
restore union unity by attending exploratory pay talks arranged for
later this week.
Mr Jinkinson said he regretted that the RCN appeared to want to go it
alone, which he decribed as a ''fundamental flaw'' as you could not
separate nurses from other NHS workers.
''We are all in this together and I would appeal to RCN members to put
pressure on their leadership to join us in Thursday's talks,'' he said.

A PLATE of fish and chips could become a luxury unless the Government
reacts to warnings on the future of Britain's fishing industry and the
safety of the men who work in it, an MP warned yesterday.
Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley and
president of the Clyde Fishermens' Association, will today table a
series of Commons questions on matters affecting fisheries both on the
west coast and in the North Sea.
He said yesterday that Clyde skippers were deeply concerned about the
Royal Navy's plans for mine warfare training which they feared could
affect both prawn and seine-net fishing, with some areas being
sterilised for six months in the year and others perhaps closed to
fishing altogether.
The MP added: ''On the east coast we have huge areas which could be
sterilised and become increasingly dangerous because of dumped oil and
gas rigs.
''Fish and chips are fast becoming a luxury item on the menu, and will
become even more so if we make life for our fishermen more difficult and
dangerous in this way.''

POLICE investigating the deaths of a woman and her two children in a
council-run swimming pool are examining religious literature found
nearby.
Scotland Yard confirmed yesterday that leaflets were found in a car
thought to have belonged to the woman.
Police are playing down a suggestion that the leaflets related to a
cult. They are not linking them to the deaths at this stage.
The car was found parked outside Seymour Leisure Centre, in
Marylebone, central London, on Saturday morning at about the same time
the bodies were discovered.
The bodies of the woman, aged in her late 30s, and her children, a boy
of seven and a girl of four, were found fully clothed and floating in
the pool.
Post-mortem examinations later confirmed they had all drowned. Police
said that there was nothing to suggest anyone else was involved.
However, they are keeping an open mind on the deaths after some of the
relatives of the family had been traced.
Detectives have established the identities of the dead. They will be
named today.
0 Westminster council officials are investigating how the family found
their way into the pool after it closed. There was no sign of forced
entry.
The pool was closed over the weekend following the discovery. A notice
on the door read: ''Following a major incident, the Seymour Leisure
Centre will remain closed until Monday, June 12. Please accept our
sincere apologies.''
One local shopkeeper said he could not understand how it had happened,
because there was always a security guard on the front door of the red
brick building, which is owned by Westminster City Council.
The centre is in a fashionable neighbourhood of Georgian houses and
luxury blocks of flats.
A spokesman for Westminster City Council said it was co-operating
fully with the police investigation.
The deaths follow those last month of Mrs Joy Senior and her three
children in Norfolk. Mrs Senior stabbed the youngsters then drowned
herself in a river after becoming depressed and talking about demonic
forces.

<TEXT>
A CALL for a nationally recognised ''champion of children'' in Britain
was made yesterday by a leading barrister.
Mr Allan Levy, QC, who has written on issues affecting children
including child abuse, said the appointment of a children's rights
commissioner to monitor and improve the treatment of children caught up
in the legal system would be a ''constructive'' move.
He told the International Bar Association meeting in Edinburgh there
was no-one directly involved in advocating for them in legislation and
the legal system, whether from a civil or criminal aspect.
''The success of the variously named children's commissioners,
ombudsmen or defenders in other countries such as Norway, Sweden,
Australia, New Zealand and Costa Rica highlights the lack in Britain of
a nationally recognised champion of children.''
Mr Levy said attempts to set up such an office had failed so far. One
specific bid had been made during the course of the Children (Scotland)
Bill through Parliament.
''Government reaction has been that it would be too expensive to set
up the post and in any event it would have no impact on the delivery of
service.''
Mr Levy said the Labour Party, which appeared likely to form the next
administration, was said to be taking the proposal forward.
''There is growing concern that policy-making and practice give too
little recognition to children's rights and interests.
''A commissioner in an independent role could ensure these are taken
into account by national and indeed local government and others,'' he
said.
Mr Levy said the office holder also could ensure the UN Convention on
the Rights of the Child was complied with, that children had an
effective means of redress and complaint and that appropriate legal
proceedings were taken on their behalf.
''One obvious area for attention is the criminal justice system. An
increasingly reactionary approach in it is leading, in my view, to the
victimisation of children.''
Mr Levy said it was ironic that in circumstances where the fact of
childhood needed more, not less, recognition, the agenda, often
politically motivated, was geared towards equating the child with the
fully responsible adult.
''A spectacularly awful death of a young child caused by two young
children -- the Bulger case -- and a juvenile crime rate said by some to
be out of control seems to have resulted in a kind of campaign against
some children in which the fact of childhood is no longer relevant.''
He criticised Home Secretary Michael Howard's ''decisive
intervention'' which led to a minimum sentence for Jamie Bulger's
killers of 15 years -- almost double the minimum sentence laid down by
the trial judge.
''It has been suggested that Michael Howard was the last person to
make the decision since no-one has done more to politicise law and
order.
''He has seized every opportunity to exploit his hard-line views about
the police, prisons and punishment in a bid to bolster his party
politically.
''Sentence should surely be a judicial process and not a political
exercise.''
Mr Levy said the general trend elsewhere had been in favour of reform
by raising the age of criminal responsibility.
England and Scotland were well out of line with most major European
countries, he said.
It seemed extraordinary to him that while many other countries
advanced both their thinking and the age for criminal responsibility
England and Scotland had spent a generation failing to do either.

A FORMER postman who fought a lengthy legal battle against health
authorities in Aberdeen to have a sex-change operation, has married
fiance Stephen Gavin on a beach in Barbados.
Back home at the weekend, Jackie James, 27, revealed that she and her
fiance had been forced to fly to the Caribbean for the wedding because
of legal restrictions in Britain.
She said: ''Because of the way things are here with the law, we could
not legally get married. Now we want to have the chance to celebrate
this wedding with our individual families.''
As Scott Whyte, she had been a butcher in Dundee and a post office
worker in Aberdeen, before, two years ago, she began her fight for the
operation. She stressed: ''I am a complete, 100% woman. Everything on
that side of things is completely feminine.''
The couple have set up home in the harbour town of Montrose in Angus,
where they share a flat in the High Street.
Mr Gavin, an Englishman in his mid-thirties, said: ''We are happy and
we want to make our lives together. Jackie is accepted here and where
she works. Some people don't know and they accept her for who she is.''
Although ''married'' in Barbados, the couple live together as
common-law man and wife in Montrose.

A BUSINESSMAN was last night coming to terms with scooping the #22.5m
National Lottery jackpot, the largest ever UK gambling prize.
The multi-million pound haul will catapult the lucky winner, from a
seaside town on the south coast, into a life of luxury and into the
ranks of some of Britain's most wealthy people.
His win -- after matching the six winning numbers to claim the
''rollover'' jackpot -- exceeds the previous best of #17.8m scooped by
an Asian man from Blackburn, Lancashire, in December.
But the lucky winner was warned yesterday that the huge windfall could
ruin his life.
The unnamed Lancashire father-of-three who scooped the December
jackpot told a newspaper his lottery win had turned him into a recluse,
unable to trust people and forced to change his name to prevent
neighbours at his new luxury home from discovering his true identity.
Six other lucky punters were celebrating winning #628,947 after
matching five numbers plus the bonus ball, 14, while 535 ticketholders
picked up #4408 for matching five balls.
Some 37,157 people won #139 for matching four numbers and 890,537
ticketholders collected the lowest prize of #10 for matching three
numbers.
The total prize fund for Saturday night's draw stood at #42,792,984.
There had been some confusion over the exact size of the rollover
jackpot, after Camelot initially predicted a jackpot of #17.4m only to
revise the figure by more than #5m yesterday.
A spokeswoman for Camelot explained there had been far fewer winners
of the guaranteed #10 prize this week, which had left more money
available for the jackpot.
Camelot also apologised to people ''inconvenienced'' by a computer
failure which led to difficulties in obtaining tickets for Saturday's
draw.
A fault in a satellite link just before noon on Saturday --
traditionally the busiest day for ticket sales -- caused about 1000
ticket machines in shops throughout the UK -- 60 in Scotland -- to fail.
It may have cost the organisers tens of thousands of pounds in lost
sales.
Camelot initially said engineers traced the problem to the lottery
headquarters and the faulty equipment was replaced within 15 minutes.
However, it later confirmed machines had come back on line at various
times throughout the day and that 300 had still been out of action
between 6pm and 7pm. The deadline for buying a ticket is 7.30pm.
Some shop owners complained their machines had remained off for most
of the day.
A Camelot spokesman said: ''We would apologise to those people who
encountered difficulties obtaining tickets. As far as I am aware, most
of the faulty terminals were back on line before the close of play.''
He said technical faults had been ''very, very rare'' in the six
months that the lottery had been running and claimed that the firm
responsible for developing the technology which controlled ticket sales
had an ''exemplary track record'' which was well proven through its
involvement with 75% of the world's lotteries.
The winning numbers were 12, 15, 26, 44, 46, 49, and the bonus number
14.
* Lottery cash could be sought for a new development linking training
and housing for homeless youngsters. Edinburgh District Council has
backed the initiative which will involve a partnership of voluntary
groups, housing and employment agencies, and the private sector for the
French-style ''foyer''.
Incorporating shops, a restaurant, hotel or offices, it would provide
training or jobs for the youngsters living in bedsit-style
accommodation.

SCOTS supporters hoisted Gavin Hastings on their shoulders yesterday
in a tribute to the captain after his final match.
Hastings scored 15 points as the Scots lost 48-30 to the All Blacks,
playing in white because of a colour clash, in the quarter finals of the
world cup.
The haul of points took his total for the tournament to 104, the most
by any individual, and raised his total points in all three world cups
to a record 227.
Hastings, 33, whose retirement ends an international career which
began in 1986, said: ''It is with immense pride that I've been captain
out here in the World Cup, and captain for the last three seasons. I
guess you put away the bad times and remember the good times.''
However, he was disappointed at the defeat: ''We came into the game
full of good vibes. What we did in the last 10 minutes we should have
done in the first 70 but the chances we gave them in the second half
killed off our chances of winning the match.''
Asked about New Zealand winger Jonah Lomu, who scored one try and made
another, Hastings said: ''He's a huge man, there's no two ways about it.
You have to be very aggressive in the tackle and on two or three
occasions today we weren't aggressive enough.
''He's a big bastard.''
Hastings and the Scottish team completed a lap of honour at the Loftus
Versfeld ground in Pretoria accompanied by hundreds of fans chanting:
''We want Gavin.''
Wearing a tartan scarf, Hastings was lifted shoulder-high by fans whom
he later thanked for their ''fantastic support'' throughout the
tournament.
New Zealand captain Sean Fitzpatrick, playing in his 100th match for
the All Blacks, paid tribute to Hastings: ''He has been a fantastic
ambassador for the sport. It's a bit of a sad way to end his career but
he can hold his head high. He is a great credit to Scotland and Rugby
Union.
''I think he's shown in the world cup that he's definitely the best
full-back in the world.''
Sir Hector Monro, the Scottish Office Minister with reponsibility for
sport, praised the Scottish team's performance and added a tribute to
the captain: ''I would like to extend my personal thanks for the
wonderful memories with which he has left us all and for the manner in
which he has conducted himself in victory and defeat throughout his very
distinguished career.''

POLICE are investigating claims that a major counterfeit cash ring is
operating in Glasgow after The Herald was passed fake notes with a
potential face value of more than #40,000.
An anonymous caller handed a plastic bag filled with forged notes into
The Herald security office.
The bag contained a bundle of 500 convincing 1000 rupee notes from the
State Bank of Pakistan. The good quality notes had a watermark, security
strip, and serial number. A similar quantity of genuine notes would be
worth around #10,000.
The bag also contained 500 sheets of A4 paper with reproduced notes
from the State Bank of Pakistan, the Royal Bank of Scotland (#20s), the
Clydesdale Bank (#20s), and the Central Bank of Cyprus (#10s) on each
page.
These notes were poor quality and may have been rejects. They had no
watermark, security thread, or serial number, the colours were variable
and the quality often blurred.
Fraud squad officers launched an investigation after being contacted
by The Herald.
Detective Constable Brian King, who specialises in tackling
counterfeit currency operations for Strathclyde police, said: ''We have
an on-going anti-counterfeit campaign. We regularly speak to members of
the public and other agencies in an effort to educate them about what to
look for.''
He said all UK bank notes had been the subject of forgery though some
-- such as the #20 -- more often than others. He added that most foreign
currencies were also copied and there had been a number of Pakistani
rupees and Cypriot pounds recently.
DC King said: ''They do these notes because there is a market for
them. Intelligence suggests they are being exported. The basic advice to
members of the public is to examine each note carefully on receipt to
ensure it is genuine.''
He said real notes could be identified by their texture and the
existence of a watermark and security thread.
Mr Liaqat Qureshi, manager of the National Bank of Pakistan,
Sauchiehall Street, guessed immediately that the wad of rupees handed to
The Herald was counterfiet. He said there were obvious defects in
quality to the trained eye but he added that the notes could easily be
mistaken for the real thing.
A spokesman for the Clydesdale Bank said there had been a number of
fake #20 notes in circulation recently. He described the forgery market
as an ''increasing problem''.
Recent fakes appeared to have been produced on a high quality
photocopier. But he added that flaws in the forgeries were glaring
against a genuine note.
A spokesman for the Royal Bank of Scotland said only small numbers of
forgeries had come to light in recent months but he added that there had
been #20 notes in circulation last year.
He added: ''There is nothing that would suggest there is any new
campaign.''

BARONESS Thatcher will tonight reopen Tory divisions over Europe in an
outspoken attack on the Prime Minister in which she accuses Mr Major of
losing public support by saying ''yes, yes'' to Europe.
In a television interview to accompany the publication of the latest
volume of her memoirs, the former Prime Minister attacks the Government
for raising taxes and losing control over public spending.
Mr Major, she says, has ''avoided'' the issue of a single currency.
She claims her Government would not have allowed parliamentary
sovereignty to be undermined by Europe. ''I didn't think we'd ever let
those go to the extent that we are,'' she says.
And in another interview, with her former chief press secretary Sir
Bernard Ingham in today's Daily Express, she spelt out her prescription
for the Tories to regain popularity and win the next election, insisting
there was still time.
She demanded John Major get tough on Europe, help home owners, cut
taxes and spending, and redirect savings from social security to law and
order.
The people wanted more Conservatism, she said. ''They are cross
because we are not being Conservative enough,'' she added.
She warned that the cost of the dependency culture had gone too far.
If savings were spent tackling crime, ''most people from the young to
the old would get up and cheer'', she said.
In an interview with Sir David Frost, to be shown tonight on BBC1, she
calls on the party to ''pull together'' and warns any Tories considering
a leadership challenge in the autumn that such a move would be
''destabilising''. If a challenge did arise, she would recommend backing
Mr Major.
However, her expression of support will do little to ease Downing
Street's dismay at this latest attack from Lady Thatcher, in a week in
which Mr Major faces a tense meeting with party Euro-sceptics.
The meeting, at which Mr Major will meet former Chancellor Norman
Lamont for the first time since he was sacked from the Cabinet, will
discuss the Government's policy for next year's conference on the follow
up to the Maastricht treaty.
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo, one of the Cabinet's strongest
Euro-phobes, yesterday stirred the debate by praising Mr Lamont, despite
the latter's efforts to destabilise Government policy over Europe and a
single currency.
In her BBC interview, Lady Thatcher warns that a single currency would
''demean'' Britain. She urges the Government to say ''no'' now and
insists she would never have signed the Maastricht treaty.
''I was turned out because I said to 'Europe no, no, no'. That 'no,
no, no' was turned into 'yes, yes'. Two yes's not three -- he got the
social charter out and he's reserved his position on the single
currency,'' she says.
Defending her own record in promoting home ownership, Lady Thatcher
attacks Ministers for cutting tax relief on mortgages three times in
three successive years.
She calls for the relief to be restored to its previous levels or
higher and warns that home owners have also been hit by 3% extra tax on
their insurance.
Yesterday, Mr Portillo described Mr Lamont as ''a very fine MP'', and
said he would be prepared to write a letter of recommendation to help
him find a new seat when his Kingston-upon-Thames constituency
disappears in boundary changes at the next election.
However, he rejected the idea of Britain leaving the European Union, a
move Mr Lamont has advocated. Britain reaped benefits from being an EU
member and other states would not want it expelled, he said.
Despite Mr Lamont's record as one of the Government's fiercest critics
from within the Tory party since he left office two years ago, Mr
Portillo said: ''I think Norman has made, since he ceased to be
Chancellor of the Exchequer, a series of very thought-provoking
speeches.
''We don't agree with every word of them by any means but he evidently
is one of the very thoughtful people in our party.''
Mr Portillo also rejected press suggestions that he might one day
accept Britain's departure from the EU: ''I just don't think it's going
to arise. I don't think we want to give up what we have -- a single
European market -- and I don't see our partners wanting to expel us.''
He added: ''There are lines in the sand that we're not going to be
pulled across. We are not going to go towards a federal Europe. We
support the single European market.''
* Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson last night welcomed the
prospect of early consultations with senior civil servants on plans for
devolution.
It is normally the practice for meetings between Opposition
politicians and civil servants in preparation for a possible change of
government to take place only six months before a General Election. But
after the last election, former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and Prime
Minister John Major agreed on an earlier deadline for such consultations
in the future.
The agreement covers all UK civil service deparments and it is
understood that talks between Scottish Office officials and Opposition
leaders could take place early in the new year.
Last night, Mr Robertson, said: ''Early consultations are good for
government in general because the transition from any party to another
in Government is very important. In the special circumstances of
Scotland, early discussion about implementing our devolution plan is
extremely important.''
Meanwhile, the President of the European Parliament, Dr Klaus Haensch,
suggested that devolution could result in Scotland having a greater
indirect say in Europe.
He told BBC Radio Scotland that, with a devolved Scottish parliament,
Britain would have to pay greater heed to Scottish attitudes on European
issues than at present.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty, and Skye,
said: ''We have always argued that Europe was far more likely to develop
in a decentralised way, contrary to the contrived rubbish being talked
by the Tories.''

Police put generation gap case for riots
POLICE last night blamed a generation gap in the Asian community for
successive nights of inner city rioting.
Young people in Bradford's Manningham district, where damage from two
nights of riots could run into hundreds of thousands of pounds, were
rising up as much against their own elders and society as against the
police, said West Yorkshire assistant chief constable Norman Bettison.
''The police is simply the anvil on which the youth is beating out its
frustration and anger, and they seem to be alienated from every
conceivable part of society from which they are drawn,'' he said.
Mr Bettison was speaking as the rundown inner city area braced itself
for a third night of violence but early this morning the area was
peaceful.
About 300 members of the Asian community had earlier gathered on a
green opposite Toller Lane police station at the heart of the troubled
area.
At one stage, two missiles were thrown towards police vans guarding
the rear entrance.
Divisional Commander Superintendent Ray Brown said there had been no
incidents anywhere else in the area.
Mr Brown said: ''After last night (Saturday) we were a little worried
to say the least about what might happen. I would like to pay tribute to
the community leaders who went out and spoke to groups of people and
that seems to have had a salutary effect.''
On Saturday night, police were bombarded with petrol bombs, dozens of
windows were smashed, cars burned and a garage partially destroyed in
rioting by 400 youths.
Police were yesterday making frantic efforts to talk to those who
might be leading youths in the area. They want to prevent a repetition
of the trouble which has led to 21 arrests.
Some community leaders have blamed police, claiming they acted in a
heavy-handed way and ignored advice on how to avoid violence.
Mr Khadim Hussain, general secretary of the Bradford Council of
Mosques, said police had ignored advice given to them at a four-hour
meeting.
''The police didn't listen,'' said Mr Hussain, who said community
leaders had pleaded that public order charges should be dropped.
''If they had agreed, we could have gone outside and told the younger
people and there would have been no trouble.''
However, Mr Bettison said the arrest of three youths in a car with
petrol bomb-making material on Saturday had shown the rioting was
already being planned when that meeting took place.
''While I was here doing my damnedest and West Yorkshire Police's
damnedest to reconcile the situation, quite clearly there were people
making petrol bombs. Within one hour, my officers came under fire from a
heavy volley of those petrol bombs,'' he said.
He said ''ludicrous'' rumours and speculation had been circulating
about what triggered the rioting.
He said it started on Friday evening when police were called to a
report of disorderly behaviour among a quite large group of Asian youths
playing football near a mosque.
There was a confrontation, one lashed out at a police car with his
foot and two arrests were made. One was at a nearby house where other
members of the youth's family argued with police.
Mr Bettison said: ''I don't hear coming back to me the resounding
answer that there is a problem with the police. I hear the answer there
is a problem with their alienation from their society as a whole. That
includes the Asian culture in which they have been raised.
''Because of their Westernisation, they feel alienated from what they
have grown up with and from what society as a whole has to offer them in
the future.''
He said there was no evidence to link the trouble with recent
''vigilante'' action to drive prostitutes out of the area.
Officers were last night being kept inside the area's Toller Lane
police station in line with an undertaking given to community leaders to
keep large numbers of police off the streets.
''We will only respond to disorder, we are not there to provoke
disorder,'' said Mr Bettison.

<HEADLINE>Unions set to challenge Blair on minimum wage</HEADLINE>

UNIONS and the leadership of the Labour Party are on collision course
over the introduction of a statutory national minimum wage.
The three largest trade union affiliates, plus many smaller ones, are
set to back a motion on the agenda of the October party conference
seeking to confirm existing party policy of a national minimum wage of
at least #4.15 an hour.
An opinion poll published today also shows overwhelming public support
for a minimum wage of at least #4.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers
union, the largest party affiliate, which both submitted the party
conference motion and commissioned the opinion poll, said last night:
''This is a clear message for all politicians and bad employers alike.
''These figures prove that the British people are sick and tired of
poverty pay and want a minimum wage backed up by law.''
However, Labour leader Tony Blair wants to steer clear of setting a
specific rate until after the General Election and has suggested setting
up a special commission involving unions and employers to agree on a
figure.
Mr Morris said the TGWU was making the case for at least #4 an hour a
negotiating issue throughout the country. It was clear, he said, that
the great majority of the public thought the union had got the target
figure about right.
It also confirmed his belief that the issue could be a vote-winner at
the General Election.
The poll, of 1000 adults, conducted by the Electoral Reform Society,
showed 79% support the concept of a statutory national minimum wage. The
figure of #4.15 an hour is supported by 69% of the poll and 87% approve
of political parties that support the declaration of a figure before the
election.
Unison's annual delegate conference will confirm today the largest
union's support for a national minimum of #4.15 an hour.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, Unison general secretary, said such a figure was
necessary to lift more than four million workers, mostly women, out of
poverty.
He added: ''We don't want to see British workers paid poverty wages --
we don't want to see Britain as the low pay ghetto of Europe.''
He dismissed as scare tactics the Government's warnings that a
national minimum wage would be a disaster for the economy and jobs.
Labour's Policy Forum endorsed at the weekend the party's policy of
delaying commitment on a statutory minimum wage, set by a new Low Pay
Commission, until after the election.
Shadow Cabinet sources confirmed last night that they still hope to
steer their policy through the October conference, although they concede
they have much persuading to do.
