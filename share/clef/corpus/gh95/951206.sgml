Geologists are digging in at Glasgow sites for, as SUE TRANTER explains, moves
are being made to map the city's mine workings
ENGINEERS are busy drilling at a number of residential sites around Glasgow . .
. to fill in a few holes on the city's geological map.
The British Geological Survey, which has been charting Britain's foundations
since 1835, states that of all the major cities in Scotland, Glasgow has the
biggest potential for underground problems.
So far, recording Glasgow's roots has been an incomplete even haphazard
exercise, according to Alan Redfern at the City Council. Pollokshields, the
West End and Ruchill are locations for drilling and Redfern is anxious to
reassure residents who live nearby that there is no cause for alarm.
``The work is just to give us more precise knowledge. It will help us protect
against any potential risk. We cannot apply for future funding to put right any
problems if we don't know what's there.''
Uncharted mine workings are a particular concern and work is currently in hand
to fill in a previously unknown shaft in Bellahouston Park that recently opened
up. A total of #6,000,000 has been spent consolidating ground at 40 tenements
near Queen's Park by pouring in hundreds of gallons of cement.
``Our records are scanty,'' says Redfern, ``though from the turn of the century
pretty good records have been kept. But 150 to 200 years ago, people just mined
where they liked and it was often quite close to the surface.''
But it's not just coal workings that have caused problems. Recent subsidence in
a front garden in Craigton, led to the discovery of an iron ore mine.
Iron ore already figures on the geological map. Its presence is marked along
with a grid of lines denoting serious coal mining in the Possil area.
Kelvinside has its fair share of seams, but most of them have shifted due to
the movement of ancient fault lines that crisscross the city.
To consult the geological map of Glasgow, head straight for the Science and
Technology section of the Mitchell Library where you might also find a kindly
assistant who just happens to have a degree in geology to help you make head
and tail of it all.
Dr Stewart Monro of the British Geoglogical Survey in Edinburgh says the map is
constantly being revised and that bore holes are an important source of
knowledge.
``Glasgow expanded on the basis of its coal, lime and iron stone from the
medieval period onwards. It expanded on its own dereliction and a lot shafts
and workings were abandoned. The mid land valley was very productive from
Alloa, Hamilton and down to Ayr and we are now wrestling with a legacy of the
mining past,'' he explains.
``It is only relatively recently that companies had to officially declare their
mining intentions, there are probably still many papers lying around in
lawyers' offices that could help us chart old workings.
``Our predictions can never be foolproof, they are based on the best statement
we can make at the time but we are constantly revising our information.''
That revision has been made easier by the advance of computer technology and
the BGS are holding maps as images on screen allowing for more frequent
changes. The public map is only updated every 40 to 50 years so it could take
some time before information from the new drilling is published. However the
BGS in Edinburgh will advise anyone direct with updated information.

After Cornton Vale prison's latest suicide Sarah Nelson asks three vital
questions
AS HMP Cornton Vale reels from its third consecutive recent suicide of a remand
prisoner (Joanne O'Reilly, who was addicted to heroin), public debate has
concentrated remarkably on the system's failure at the very end of these
women's lives. Yet this may be unimportant - a red herring which damagingly
diverts courts, prisons, social work, media and public from the real issues
these suicides raise.
To home in on last-ditch gatekeeping is the easy option. Such gatekeeping is
the way prison authorities or police understandably watch their backs: through
its mistakes, individual staff are found to blame for personal and social
tragedies.
Did someone fail to watch these unhappy teenagers every 15 minutes precisely,
to ensure they didn't hang themselves? Did someone fail to spot from the notes
that this prisoner was a suicide risk? Such questions are also the stuff of
fatal accident inquiries, though well-conducted FAIs will draw wider lessons,
too.
Physically stopping people committing suicide is important for prison
reputations, avoiding major public embarrassment. It is hopelessly, laughably
inadequate for the distressed prisoner, and often just a temporary frustration,
later resolved with minimal publicity in an alleyway or squalid flat. It
seriously diverts attention from the questions that matter.
Should these people have been remanded in jail at all, and were they a danger
to the public? If they already had serious problems in their lives had they
received any of the help they actually needed, either outside or inside prison?
And, crucially, do features of the prison regime itself, especially the remand
regime and the very restrictions and isolation of the strip-cell and suicide
watch, actually encourage many prisoners to despair or ``crack up''? After all,
they might do in the rest of us.
Given the recent rise in jail suicides these three questions are important for
all prisons, but particularly for Cornton Vale if, as some reports have
claimed, an astonishing 80%-plus of the inmates pose a potential suicide risk.
The penal and courts system have to ask urgently why this should be, and how
far court disposals and the prison regime - criticised in detail in last year's
Inspectorate report - might be relevant to it.
It is extraordinary how few hard questions have been asked about the first, not
the last, stage of the process for these three young people. Why were they
remanded in custody in the first place when their offences were relatively
trivial, especially since Kelly Holland and Arlene Elliot were only 17?
Why is there such an absence in Scotland of female bail accommodation, and a
dearth of research figures or debate on comparative rates of remand in custody
for young men and young women? Are female remands forced into the penal system
earlier and more often, through lack of alternatives and various assumptions or
prejudices about female offenders?
As Tayside social work director Peter Bates told a Sacro conference on women
offenders this year: ``We suffer from a sad deficiency in research. The Central
Research Unit has decided that all its projects must now address the gender
issue, but as yet in Scotland we have no in-depth study to compare with the
thematic report by HM Inspectorate of Probation into women offenders . . .
there is still room in Scotland for much more work reflecting women's
experience.''
It is also unclear how much has changed since Sue Gutteridge carried out her
research in Cornton Vale more than 15 years ago. Then, she was particularly
struck at the very high rates of remand in custody for under-21s. This directs
critical questions on to court decisions, but she also noted in the book, The
Imprisonment of Women, Cornton Vale's own failure, even by its social workers,
to recognise prisoners' basic needs for proper legal advice.
Observing five prisoners admitted one morning on remand, she wrote: ``If they
had no lawyer, there appeared to be no provision for getting them one . . . the
question of appealing against remand in custody was never raised, even though
it was difficult to see why any of the five women in question had been so
remanded. All were on trivial charges, except one who hadn't been charged at
all . . .
``The rigidly hierarchical structure of Cornton Vale discouraged any
challenging of the decisions of authority, and the prison's conception of a
`therapeutic' establishment encouraged the view that women had been put there
for their own good. The crime itself, and the justice of the sentence, were
less relevant.''
Back in 1987, the World Group on Bail and Custodial Remand set up by Sacro
urged the general principle that bail should be granted unless the prosecution
proved there was sufficient reason for not doing so.
They also called for research into the problems and stresses of remand
prisoners; and the involvement of psychologists in the design of remand
regimes, in their evaluation, in assessment of prisoners and training of staff.
Nor should psychologists and other staff working with remand prisoners have to
play any part in the judicial process.
THE working group also took evidence on distressed behaviour resulting from
remand, such as self-mutilation, often made worse by withdrawal from drugs or
alcohol and by remand regimes' own restraints - such as inability to mix freely
with, and get support from, other prisoners. The report's sweeping
recommendations for change ran into 40 measures for courts, social workers and
the penal system.
But prisons can easily become everyone else's scapegoats. A more fundamental
question for legal, penal and welfare systems is why so many women, especially
young women, enter prisons with major problems already in place - like
self-harm, drink and drug abuse, serious depression or a psychiatric history.
The whole weight of traditional theories on female offenders still encourages
them to be seen as simply mad, bad, inadequate or ``attention-seeking'' (Sue
Gutteridge even noted prisoners being charged the cost of saucers they broke to
slash themselves). These attitudes heavily affect the kind of support services
female offenders do, or do not, receive.
The idea that many might be normal young people deeply affected by life
experiences of upheaval, trauma or serious abuse, with offending just one
manifestation of that, has yet to be acted upon beyond lip service, with
support programmes geared to address those experiences directly - diverting
them from the penal system, or plugging them into effective services when they
do end up in jail.
As Peter Bates said, one of the most important challenges female offenders pose
is ``the need to hear what women say about their own offending, and to treat
them as responsible people''.
It is, perhaps, worryingly symptomatic of the prison service's ``gatekeeping''
priorities for both female and male prisoners that it is prepared to build 13
special ``at risk'' cells in Scottish jails, complete with non-tear clothes and
resuscitation equipment on hand at a cost of #30,000 each. And yet Cornton
Vale's deputy governor, Mr William Low, told the FAI on Holland and Elliot last
week that cell modernisation and provision of full-time counsellors would drain
``a huge proportion'' of the prison's budget.

THOUSANDS of asylum-seekers will face a stark choice of deportation or
destitution in the new year, MPs were told yesterday.
A benefits crackdown means help will be withdrawn from up to 13,000 would-be
refugees, Department of Social Security officials disclosed. They ruled out any
possibility of people being given cash for a flight back home.
The disclosures - to the Commons Social Security Select Committee - are even
worse than refugee organisations had feared. Mr Nick Hardwick, chief executive
of the Refugee Council has warned that up to 8000 asylum-seekers could be left
homeless and destitute. Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn (Islington) described the
action as ``abominable''.
Meanwhile, Home Secretary Michael Howard stepped into a row over the release of
confidential details about a Nigerian asylum-seeker which were given to
journalists by Conservative Party headquarters.
In a letter to Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw, he repeated a statement given
earlier by the Prime Minister that the Home Office decided to give out
information to set the record straight after Abiodun Igbindu's team had
publicised details of the case and allegations about its handling.
WESTERN Isles MP Calum Macdonald has called on the Scottish Secretary to use
his voice in Cabinet to support a European bid to save Scottish salmon farmers
from Norwegian over-production and dumping. Mr Macdonald, a Labour spokesman on
the Highlands and Islands, last night attacked what he saw as Mr Forsyth's
inaction: ``Salmon-farming is an important Scottish industry, and vital to the
fragile economies of the Highlands and Islands. It has been twice devastated by
Norwegian over-production and dumping. Now is the time to act. It is Mr
Forsyth's job to ensure that Scotland's interests are backed by the whole power
of the UK in Europe. He has failed to do this.''
A NEW bid to crack down on the sex tourism industry was launched last night
amid indications that the Government is considering action on the issue.
Crossbencher Lord Hylton, introducing his Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill,
told the Lords it would ``extend the jurisdiction of the UK courts to try
sexual offences against children committed overseas''.
BABY deaths are at their lowest level, Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell told
the Commons yesterday. The perinatal rate - stillbirths and deaths of babies
less than a week old - fell by nearly 40% between 1979 and 1994 and the infant
death rate - for those under one year - dropped by half during the same period.
Mr Dorrell said the figures demonstrated the ``good value, efficient'' service
being delivered by the National Health Service.

<HEADLINE>Judges' ruling on jury's #165,000 damages pay-out creates a pattern for claims in Scotland Awards for injuries set to rise</HEADLINE>

DAMAGES awards in personal injuries cases in Scotland look set to increase
after three appeal court judges refused to interfere with a jury's decision to
give #165,000 to a Kilmarnock binman.
The court decided to leave the amount intact, despite the fact that #91,000 of
the total - awarded for the pain suffered by Mr Wallace Currie - was around
twice what a judge would have given.
Lord Hope, the Lord President, acknowledged the risk that judges might become
increasingly out of touch with awards made legitimately by juries.
The appeal court decision to leave the jury's award standing was welcomed by Mr
Currie's solicitor, Mr Ian Newton. He said: ``The modest acknowledgement by the
appeal court, that judges may be out of touch with the ordinary person,
provides an opportunity for judges to bring damages awards more into line with
what the Scottish public considers to be reasonable compensation in personal
injury cases.''
The immediate result of the decision is likely to be an increased demand for
juries in personal injuries cases.
They give higher damages than judges and Mr Currie's case indicates that the
appeal court will be slow to interfere, even when it thinks the award is much
too high.
If Mr Newton is right, the decision might also be seen as a hint to judges that
their awards are too low.
Mr Currie, of Methven Avenue, Kilmarnock, suffered serious injuries when a bin
lorry drove over his feet in August 1992. The first four toes of his left foot
had to be amputated and the jury at the Court of Session was told that a
further below-the-knee amputation was imminent.
He had been an enthusiastic cross-country runner and had enjoyed some success
in veteran events.
He alleged that his employers, Kilmarnock and Loudon District Council, had been
negligent, and sued for #200,000. The jury gave him #165,000, including #91,000
for solatium (pain and suffering).
The council appealed on the grounds that the award for pain and suffering was
excessive, and suggested #35,000.
Lord Hope, who heard the appeal with Lords Prosser and Osborne, said the
solatium award was substantially in excess of what a judge would have given, in
light of recent awards in similar cases.
If the #91,000 had been awarded by a judge sitting alone, the appeal court
would have been entitled to reduce it, but a jury award could be set aside only
if the jury had committed a gross injustice.
There was a wealth of information about the level of awards made by judges for
pain and suffering. Inflation tables had been devised and were recognised in
practice as an appropriate method of updating past awards.
Lord Hope added, however: ``It is open to question whether an award, arrived at
by comparison with past awards, (and) updated by an inflation table based upon
the retail price index, is a true reflection of a reasonable jury's conception
of the value of money.
``There is a risk that, by adhering to the relatively narrow band within which
judges operate, judges will become increasingly out of touch with awards made
by juries in the proper exercise of their discretion. The court must adopt a
fairly broad approach in its examination of awards of solatium made by juries,
and that any previous awards, whether by a judge or by a jury, can be no more
than a rough guide as to what is or what is not excessive.
``As for the award of solatium made by the jury in the present case, I do not
think that they can be described as so extravagant as to have resulted in a
gross injustice to the defenders.''
There is a right to a jury trial in the Court of Session unless the person
defending the action can show special cause why the case is unsuitable for a
jury.

MR TONY BLAIR was accused yesterday of ``disgraceful intimidation and
browbeating,'' not so much ``tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime''
as just tough.
The accusation, surprisingly, did not come from his own side but from Tory Tim
Devlin (Stockton South). This alleged thuggery was being perpetrated, the MP
claimed, on parents at a North of England school, who were thinking of opting
their children's school out of local authority control.
The Prime Minister, perhaps mindful of the Speaker's view the day before, that
MPs should not be nasty to each other, was tough on ``disgraceful intimidation
and browbeating'' but brought in a verdict of not proven on Mr Blair by not
mentioning him.
The Labour leader reciprocated by asking a low-key question about education
and, even when provoked by having the sorry records of some Labour-controlled
education authorities read out to him, declined to ask a second, never mind a
third question.
Not only were Members being nice and restrained, there was no burning issue
that anyone could think of how Mr Major found himself in trouble of a different
kind than usual as he tried to frame rational answers to some bizarre questions.
Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (Batley and Spen - Con.) asked for his view on the use of
textiles from three Yorkshire companies to clothe the latest James Bond. Mr
Michael Brown (Brigg and Cleethorpes - Con.) asked if Mr Major agreed that his
constituency was becoming ``the chemical capital of the world.''
Sir Michael Shersby (Uxbridge - Con.) asked him to praise the outstanding
success of Operation Christmas Cracker.
Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley - Lab.) asked him to reveal
all about the issue that has gripped the attention of the nation - the alleged
doctoring of the video of the Conservative Party conference to make one
Minister (Dr Brian Mawhinney) look better and another (Mr Michael Portillo)
less good.
Besides these, the efforts of Mr Michael Fabricant (Mid Staffordshire - Con.)
and Mr Bill Walker (Tayside North - Con.), urging him to commend ``the
Conservative Party's crusade for choice'' in the first case and condemn
Labour's plans for a Scottish parliament in the second, seemed positively
statesmanlike.
However, even the blandest Question Time rarely passes without suggesting that
the Government is up to another fishy operation.
Mr Matthew Taylor, the youthful Liberal Democrat from Truro, complained about
Government figures claiming to show that Devon and Cornwall get a better deal
from public spending than the rest of the country.
Ministers, of course, are always telling the Scots and Welsh that they do
better than the rest of the country. The Sketch is weak on economics, but
surely every region can't be doing better than the rest of the country.
It was in character with the spirit of this session that Mr Rhodri Morgan
(Cardiff West - Lab.), after indicating the latest buffers on which rail
privatisation has crashed, ended by urging the Prime Minister and the House to
join him in a chorus of the old song, Let's Call the Whole Thing Off.
For yesterday's question session, it might not have been a bad idea.

TIS the season to be ..... well and truly freaked that it's that season again.
Why, seems like only yesterday that we were being informed by some thoughtful
advertiser that t'was a mere 276 shopping days to Christmas but, dash it, yet
again and, despite the best of intentions, I've missed my chance to be up to
scratch on the old Blue Peter Advent crown front.
I'm sure that one day that plastic bag of wire coat hangers, gold tinsel and
candles that I've been hoarding in the wardrobe will be put to good use but
somehow I suspect that the end result would not be suitable for broadcast on
children's television. Or a family newspaper for that matter - so don't bother
writing in for DIY diagrams.
The female best friend arrived at the door the other day radiating the sort of
glow that only podgy infants bundled into duffle coats in those ancient Ready
Brek ads ever had. I was instantly suspicious. I knew she wasn't the type but I
wondered if she had taken drugs. I couldn't think of anything else which would
inspire the state of serendipity she was clearly in.
If I hadn't already buzzed her through by intercom I would have kept her
standing on the doorstep but she was in the kitchen making herself a coffee
before I could begin my interrogation. ``You look, um, very snug,'' I said.
``Mmm,'' she said dreamily with an air of beneficent grace which, alarmingly,
reminded me of Sydney Penny, the spooky star of the film Bernadette. This was
scary stuff. I considered dialling the emergency services. Perhaps she had been
brainwashed by some weird cult?
But her beatific state was not down to organised religion but something even
worse: organised shopping. When she revealed her heinous secret it was all I
could do to stop myself from shrieking in terror and rushing off to shake
copies of various slacker's Bibles at her like some latter-day,
garlic-clutching vampire catcher. She imparted her revelation with a reluctance
which I deemed false judging by the slight smirk lurking round her lips.
``Spill the beans - no, not those ones,'' I shrieked, as she got at the jar of
Nescafe (three types of the world's finest) out of the cupboard. She shrugged
and gave an eerie smile. ``It's no big deal,'' she said, brandishing the kettle
with a witchy glee. ``I've just bought the last present on my Christmas
shopping list.''
``Aargh! I told you not to go into teaching; I knew you would pick up bad
habits,'' I wailed. If it is at all possible to sip coffee airily then I swear
that is what she did next, before pausing and declaring: ``I've also posted my
Christmas cards, bought the Christmas food in, and painted all the skirting
boards.''
I promptly collapsed in a moaning heap, uttering profanities, curses, and cries
of betrayal. I recovered to her wafting one of her surplus Christmas cards over
my face. ``I haven't really painted all the skirting boards,'' she was
comforting me. ``Only three walls' worth in one room.''
What happened to traditional Christmas cynicism? It seems to be drowned out by
waves of festive cheer. I suppose the one bright spot is that if everyone else
is going to be so organised it means my normal ``Christmas Eve dash'', which
involves the kind of shopping frenzy which would put even the hyped-up
contestants on Dale Winton's Supermarket Sweep to shame, will be that much
easier. Everyone else will be sitting at home in smug stupification, munching
on mince pies and putting the final touches to beribboned parcels, giving me
some space frantically to gather all before my path.
Christmas is so intimidating. Only ickie-bickie kiddies and proper grown ups
can really enjoy it. Us in-betweenies are bewildered. Christmas looks like too
much fuss. We simply don't have the know-how to know how to deal with it. The
products of the functional and diffracted families we can do some strange and
wonderful and even vaguely illegal things but no-one ever showed us how to
stuff a turkey.
Consequently, those of us who can afford to are leaving the country in droves
to avoid the festive season, signing up for trips to sunny, tinsel-free,
angst-free climes like Goa and Thailand. Those of us who can't afford to do so
will, ironically, end up spending more. We'll sign up for prolonged debt by
putting our signature to credit card slips for presents all the more expensive
for being bought in the grip of last-minute panic.
Because for all our expressed cynicism we succumb to guilt in the end, falling
for that consumer mantra which is slyly wrapped inside a supposedly charitable
message: it is better to give than to receive.
It's a message which has been cleverly deployed by the Blood Donor Centre this
year. A personal plea has dropped through the letter box. I'm a regular,
card-carrying donor. Well, as a lapsed Catholic I had to find something to
replace the cleansing sensation of walking out of confession. Strolling out of
the Blood Donor Centre, having had my blood sucked and feeling the kind of
euphoric self-righteousness which normally only comes from chucking bags of
empties into the bottle bank, seems to hit the spot.
SO, the blood bank people have solved my annual dilemma of what to give with
their ``Better to give than to receive'' plea. After all, goodwill gestures are
so hep, and adopting a dolphin for someone's Crimbo prezzie is so passe. Don't
get me wrong. I hope my highly efficient, super-organised mates will never need
it but my gift to them will be a donation of blood to the nation's supplies.
Well, it's the thought that counts. I've enough of the old red stuff to give
some away. The health bods don't seem to object to it being boiling.

MIKE Atherton has been rewarded for his recent Test-saving innings with
possibly the biggest compliment English cricket can pay an opening batsman.
``I think Mike is a better player than Geoff Boycott was at the same age,''
said manager Ray Illingworth.
``They are comparable in terms of concentration and technique, but Mike is only
27 whereas Geoff reached his best around 30.''
Boycott was among those who watched with admiration at the Wanderers as
Atherton saved the second Test against South Africa by batting for nearly 11
hours while scoring an undefeated 185. Boycott, who totalled 8114 runs from 108
Tests, found few things in life more enjoyable than occupying the crease for
long periods. But, as captain of a side facing what most people thought was
certain defeat, Atherton's main satisfaction came from saving England.
Even when the job was as good as done and he could have aimed for an extra
chunk of glory, thoughts of scoring a first double century at senior level did
not enter his head.
``Mike never mentioned trying to get 200,'' said Illingworth. ``I don't think
records and milestones mean the same to him as they did to Boycks. ``He is one
of those people whose game is suited to captaincy. It has made him a better
player.''
The statistics tend to support Illingworth's case. For Atherton has now scored
nine centuries in 53 Tests - six of them since taking over as captain from
Graham Gooch 26 matches ago.
``I can think of only one other current English player who could play the kind
of innings Mike produced at the Wanderers,'' said Illingworth. ``Tim Robinson
has the necessary concentration, but he probably could not do it against quick
bowlers like Allan Donald.
``A lot of people don't have the ability to concentrate like that.''
Illingworth also was full of admiration for Jack Russell's long contribution to
an undefeated stand of 119 that spanned 75 overs.
``Jack is twice the pro he was four years ago,'' said the manager. ``Since
becoming captain of Gloucestershire he has had to think about other people
rather than just his own game.
``He still works hard at his wicketkeeping and batting but he has a wider
vision of things. He gees up other people and is a very good senior pro.''
Illingworth kept his advice to a minimum when Atherton and Russell returned to
the pavilion at the breaks. ``I just said `well done' and reminded them they
had to start all over again at the beginning of each new session,'' explained
the manager.
Yesterday, the England squad relaxed in their hotel, having flown to Cape Town
and then travelled the short distance to Paarl by coach. Today, however, it is
back to work - preparing for tomorrow's match against provincial side Boland.
Phillip DeFreitas, who is spending the winter in South Africa, should be among
England's opponents on a delightful ground that nestles at the foot of an
impressive mountain range.
``I hope Daffy plays,'' said Illingworth. ``He is not out of our World Cup
reckoning by any means.''
DeFreitas' name was missing from a provisional list of 20 supplied by England
to organisers of the New Year tournament in India and Pakistan.
However, Illingworth insists changes can be made before a final squad of 14 is
submitted, even though cricket officials on the sub-continent are currently
contesting that view.

SHARES in the BTR industrial conglomerate took a hammering yesterday sliding
14p to 320p after a profits warning that took analysts by surprise.
That helped remove the gloss from a new opening high for the FTSE-100 of 3683
which ended the day at 3664.2 despite Wall Street having risen by nearly 100
points over two days.
In what is now a routine quarterly trading update for shareholders, BTR said
1995 profits and sales would not be in line with earlier expectations although
they would be above those achieved last year. These are being re-stated at
#1308m compared with the earlier published #1341m following disposals including
the #330m sale of construction materials firm Tilcon to Minorco last month.
Pinpointed were the slowdown in parts of the US activities such as automotive
and commercial interiors, and in Australian construction, as well as mixed
trading in Britain and continental Europe. However, many other parts of the
group remain perky.
A particular concern was the downturn in profitability at the Taiwanese polymer
operation which has suffered from a dearth of exports to China. That is thought
be lined up for disposal.
The net effect has been to send profit projections tumbling about #100m to
#1420m, which is obviously no help to a company which has under-performed the
FTSE by 10% since the beginning of the year. That may be partly a problem of
perception as communication is not a major preoccupation at BTR, even if there
has been a fair bit of portfolio reorganisation in the last year.
The City is expecting a great deal from Ian Strachan who takes over as chief
executive at the turn of the year. He was a major player in the vast
improvement in the fortunes of RTZ, and his first executive action at BTR
should not be too long coming to help reverse the stock's under-performance.
Plainly urgent
RECENT legislation on consumer contracts requires that they be written in plain
English, and this includes mortgage contracts.
The Banking Ombudsman Laurence Shurman agrees it is high time the impenetrable
legalese in these documents was made more understandable. At present people
cannot comprehend what they are agreeing to.
Unfortunately, even in plain English mortgage paperwork can never be simple,
but lenders might at least take more trouble to explain to customers what it is
all about.
Another bee in Mr Shurman's bonnet is the mortgage indemnity guarantee. This is
an (expensive) insurance policy paid for by the borrower for the benefit of the
lender should the property realise less than the mortgage in a forced sale.
There is still confusion over whether the insurer, having paid out to the
lender, could then pursue the borrower for this money. This would be a nonsense
and the uncertainty must be cleared up.
Because the insurers have lost a packet on MIGs as a result of falling house
prices they appear to be penalising borrowers. It is time the whole subject was
brought more into the open.
Astute operator
RACAL Electronic's reputation as an astute operator gained by its participation
in the Camelot consortium, which runs the National Lottery, will not suffer as
a result of its #133m purchase of BR Telecommunications (BRT) from British
Rail.
It provides Racal with a dependable revenue flow arising from long-term
contracts with Railtrack, while giving it a ready-made telecommunications
network within which to sell capacity.
Racal has already approached the American giants AT&amp;T and NYNEX which are eager
to make inroads here. UK cable companies are others which would no doubt be
interested. Racal itself will use some of the capacity for its developing voice
and data transmission services.
BRT is a profitable business, earning #17.6m in the year to last March on
turnover of #174m.
The deal will push up Racal's gearing to 82% but it still expects the purchase
to be earnings enhancing this financial year. Gearing will soon be on the way
down and to finance the acquisition with debt rather than a rights issue looks
better for shareholders. The rising proportion of revenue coming from
telecommunications gives good support to the shares at 276p, up 6p, selling at
about 15 times prospective earnings.

n AS land prices around the edge of Glasgow rise, locations which would have
once been thought too far out are now becoming more popular.
Tay Homes says its development off Inchmurrin Drive in Kilmarnock, known as The
Craigs, is attracting the kind
of family purchasers who might previously have opted for a location on the
outskirts of Glasgow.
The three-bedroom Beauly and the four-bedroom detached Lewis are priced from
#74,950 and #89,950 respectively, and sales and marketing director Iain Stewart
says such prices are proving to be a key selling point.
Christmas is coming, but builders are keeping the pressure to achieve sales
before the market packs up for the festive season. Tay Homes is offering
part-exchange deals on apartments at its Hyndland Gate scheme in Glasgow's West
End.
Incentives are still playing a key role. Wimpey Homes claims to have been
particularly busy in October and November, mainly due to its special deals
which allow buyers to postpone their first payments for six months - backed up
by 100% market value part-exchange deals.
Ian Brown, sales and marketing director for Wimpey Homes (Scotland West), says:
``There is no doubt that our incentives are attractive and have helped to
increase the level of sales at this time of year. 1995 has been a difficult
year, but 1996 is just around the corner and I am confident the activity we
have been seeing over the past couple of months will continue into 1996.''
A show home has just opened at Glenavon Gate in the Ferguslie Park area of
Paisley where 94 homes have been built.
Four house types are available on the development - The Cary and The Spey, both
two-bedroom semi-detached; The Tweed, a three-bedroom semi-detached; and The
Derwent, a three-bedroom semi-detached. The Spey is on show for visitors to
view. Prices start at #36,995.
Meanwhile, Barratt West Scotland has made it easier to buy one of its
``Oakleaf' properties, taken in part-exchange from buyers who have moved into
new Barratt homes, with a special bonus package.
All Oakleaf homes have been independently inspected and valued, with many
available at prices well below the current market valuations and with extras
such as carpets, curtains and light fittings. Oakleafs are currently available
all over Scotland at #21,000 to #92,000.
That bonus package? On selected Oakleaf homes, Barratt will pay your 5%
deposit; pay your mortgage for six months; provide you with free redundancy
protection for two years, and let you move in for just #99. This package is
over and above the many extras included with Oakleaf Homes.
In the West, a number of Oakleaf homes are available with this bonus package.
In Coatbridge, a one-bedroom starter flat is available in Dundyvan Road for
#32,995. This has a spacious lounge with feature fireplace; built-in mirrored
wardrobes and fitted kitchen with oven, hob and hood.
In Drumry, Clydebank, a two-bedroom upper cottage flat is priced at #29,950. It
has a double oven hob and hood as well as double-glazing and a bathroom with
shower.
A three-bedroom, first-floor flat is available in Dumbarton Road, Scotstoun,
Glasgow. Priced at #41,995 with double glazing, it comprises spacious lounge,
fitted kitchen, three bedrooms and bathroom.
A bonus package property is also available in Balloch. In Shearer Quadrant, a
two-bedroom, first-floor flat - professionally decorated and with new carpets -
is priced at #25,500.

AN unusual musical premiere will take place in London tonight: the performance
of a new composition in memory of the late John Smith, former leader of the
Labour Party, set to texts chosen with the advice of his widow, Baroness Smith.
The composition, entitled A Live Flame, is a 20-minute work for solo tenor and
orchestra, and will be performed at St John's Smith Square this evening by the
London Musici with tenor Richard Coxon.
The composition is by Keith Burstein, a controversial young composer who has
tended to annoy the Establishment by his confrontation of social issues in his
music. (He has written a Requiem for the victims of the 1989 Marchioness river
boat disaster.)
Moved by the ``moment of loss'' he felt on hearing of the death of John
Smith, Burstein contacted Labour MPs and Baroness Smith and expressed his
intention to write a work which would ``create images of permanence and hope''.
Texts were chose from the poems of Keats, Graves and Burns, among others, with
a particular reference to Gerard Manley Hopkins's Inversnaid, recommended by
Baroness Smith as one of her late husband's favourite poems.
Burstein then approached the London Musici's founder and music director, Mark
Stephenson, who agreed to take on the new work for his orchestra.
Richard Coxon, who will sing the solo tenor part, is a familiar face in
Scottish music circles. Currently a contract principal with Scottish Opera,
Coxon has recently sung in a range of Scottish Opera productions, including
Beethoven's Fidelio    at the Edinburgh Festival and Dvorak's The Jacobin.

n Cairn Energy has begun drilling the first offshore gas exploration well to be
sunk in Bangladesh for more than 20 years. The Edinburgh-based oil company
yesterday began work on the Sangu-1 well in offshore block 16, 35km south-west
of the port city of Chittagong. Cairn hopes it will prove gas reserves of more
than 1.5 trillion cubic feet.
It expects to take about 40 days to drill the 3500m well which marks the start
of a three-year exploration and appraisal campaign by Cairn in offshore blocks
15 and 16.

Scottish home prices
are set for a gentle
recovery, according to
a new report analysed
by Stewart McIntosh
A leading economic forecaster is predicting that Scottish house prices will
rise every year for the next five years. But don't fasten your seat belt yet.
The upswing will be a rather genteel one, carrying the market on a steady, if
undramatic, upward curve.
In a report for the merchant bankers Charterhouse, forecaster James Morrell
says UK house prices will edge higher next year then accelerate in 1997/98 to
produce an average rate of growth of 3% per annum in the years to 2000. The
peak will come in two years, when the South-east will see rises of 5% or 6%.
Scotland's success in outperforming the rest of the UK housing market over the
last four years means that rises north of the Border will be more muted.
Scotland's price increases will peak at 4% in 1998 - and the five-year average
north of the Border will pan out at around 2.25% per annum, compared with the
UK's 3% average, predicts Morrell.
When inflation is taken into account, there will be no real growth in values
anywhere in the UK over the next five years. But although prices will be moving
sideways in real terms, a gradual increase in the price tag pinned to the front
doors will bring smiles of relief to house builders, estate agents and sellers.
The best news in the report is that housing should become even more affordable
over the next five years. The ratio of house prices to earnings is now at a
record low level, which makes housing very affordable. ``The market is poised
for a gentle recovery,'' says Morrell.
He calculates that the current average cost of a second-hand house in Scotland
is #57,200, a figure which will rise to #64,100 by the year 2000. But the
increase will be more than met by the forecast rises in earnings. The average
combined earnings of Scottish households is #31,500 - which Morrell says will
rise to #38,300 by 2000. Put average earnings and average house prices together
and the price-to-earnings ratio shows that Scotland's homes will become
steadily more affordable.
The average house in Scotland currently costs 1.83 times the average combined
earnings - and will reduce to 1.67 by 2000. The price-to-earnings ratios for
new-build housing is slightly higher but follows the same pattern of reduction
over the next five years.
Morrell's figures offer vivid evidence of the canny Scots' reluctance to get
carried away by the bonfire of insanities which swept through the southern
market at the end of the 1980s. At the height of the boom in 1989 Scottish
house prices rose to 2.13 times average combined earnings - but in the south of
England people were having to pay more than four times their combined earnings
to buy a house. Then the bubble burst.
Since then, the market has never really dragged back to its feet. But Morrell
believes we have learned to live with insecurity and debt. As a result, the
Charterhouse report predicts that spending power will increase next spring.
More importantly, he also forsees an increase in first-time buying then.
If he is right, the first-time buyer will be the engine that drives the
house-market recovery. Around 50% of all purchases are accounted for by
first-time buyers and any increase in activity will generate chains of deals
throughout the market.
In 1988 the Government warned that it was going to withdraw the double mortgage
relief which was available for unmarried couples. The resulting orgy of
frenzied transactions saw 545,000 ``virgin' purchases that year, pushing up
prices and creating greed, envy and lust in a market which had been rather
straightlaced for the previous 20 years. But it could not last, the
first-timers ran out of steam, and transactions slumped to 327,000 by 1992.
When the tide turned, many of those younger people who plunged headlong into
the market in 1988 found themselves high and dry with negative equity.
Having seen what happened to their older brothers and sisters, many other
potential buyers have deferred their first house purchase. But the costs of
buying and renting have converged and an increase in activity among first-time
buyers is now predicted by the Charterhouse report. Around 400,000 first-timers
will come into the market each year for the next five years, the report
predicts.
All in all, Morrell reveals a telling comparison between Scottish and UK price
swings over the last ten years, projected forward to 2000. The graphs show a
much smoother pattern north of the Border compared with the jagged peaks and
troughs which afflict the English market.

A CASTLE is the stuff of fantasy in these embattled times. The nuisances of
daily life seem further away when you can slam the gate shut, climb the stairs
to your turret and defy tax inspectors and double-glazing salesmen to penetrate
your defences.
And you don't need to be a robber baron to own your own historic castle. Estate
agency Allen &amp; Harris is selling Hatton Castle, a traditional Z-plan
fortification dating from 1575, which stands on an elevated position over the
vale of Strathmore between the Sidlaw Hills and the Grampians.
Situated on the edge of Newtyle at the base of Hatton Hill, the B-listed castle
commands the paths through the Sidlaws to Dundee. The accommodation comprises:
traditional great hall, laird's drawing room and study, kitchen, dining room,
two store rooms, seven bedrooms, four bathrooms, oil-fired underfloor heating,
enclosed garden, and around one acre of ground. But the estate agent warns that
completion work is needed to make it habitable.
The lands of Hatton were granted by charter by Robert the Bruce in 1317 to his
daughter, when she married Sir Walter de Oliphant, Chief Justiciary of Lothian.
Her loving dad also threw in the lands of Balcraig, Ochtertyre, Balgonie,
Newtyle and Kinpurnie. This charter was later confirmed by David II. Their
heirs were raised to the peerage in 1463, and in 1575 Laurence, the fourth Lord
Oliphant, married the Earl of Errol's daughter and built Hatton Castle.
The property was sold by the fifth Lord Oliphant in 1627 to the neighbouring
Hallyburtons of Pitcus. It was garrisoned for the Covenant in 1645, but
Montrose managed to take it. In 1690 it was sold to Sir George Mackenzie of
Rosehaugh and is believed to have been inhabited until 1770, after which it
fell into a ruinous condition.
In the early years of this century it was bought by the Cayzer family, owners
of the surrounding estate of Kinpurnie, who in 1986 feued it to the Hutton
Castle Trust, which has restored the structure to its original design.
The castle has two unusual architectural features: the scale and platt (square)
staircase in the south-west tower is believed to be the first built of its
type, a spiral staircase being more common; and the main living section has
been divided asymmetrically by a wall, giving different floor levels throughout
the core of the building.
The castle is built of harled stone under a slate roof. Flagstones form the
floors at ground and first level, while those on the second and third level are
of oak. As are the internal doors. The garden, enclosed by a boundary wall,
extends to about an acre.
Unlike in Montrose's day, neither battering ram nor conquering army is required
to take Hatton Castle now. A piece of paper offering more than #125,000 will
see Allen &amp; Harris's defences crumble.

ABERDEEN Football Club captain Stewart McKimmie will not be prosecuted for an
elbowing incident which led to him being sent off in the match against Partick
Thistle in Glasgow on Saturday.
Procurator-fiscal Andrew Normand, who originally called for a police report,
has said he is taking no further action.
McKimmie has already been fined #500 by his club.
The growing involvement of fiscals' departments in on-the-field violence has
led to calls from some football and legal officials for fresh guidelines.
q A bid by Everton striker Duncan Ferguson for an immediate return to football
is expected to start today at the Court of Session, but a full hearing will not
take place for some time.

RUGBY ROUND-UP
RUGBY Football Union secretary Tony Hallett claims that talks have taken place
between the two codes regarding a proposed #2m showdown involving rugby league
side Wigan and union's Bath.
The game, which would consist of two matches - one at Twickenham under union
rules the other a league game at a major football ground in the north - would
be designed to establish the best rugby team in England.
The clubs are keen on the plan, with May considered the most suitable month,
but Hallett denied that any official approach had been received.
``I talked with Maurice Lindsay in London about the idea,'' said Hallett.
``Neither of us has been approached officially, but both codes would wish to
examine the implications of such matches before agreeing to them.''
q.FRENCH flanker Philippe Benetton has broken his right arm for the second time
this year and will miss this season's Five Nations' tournament.
Benetton, one of the stalwarts of the French team, broke the arm three minutes
from the end of Agen's match with Nice at the weekend. He broke the same arm
while playing for France against Scotland in Pretoria during the World Cup
finals in June.
q.PETER Walton is poised to complete his recovery from injury by playing for
Newcastle this weekend. The Scotland flanker, who has been in rehabilitation
from a knee operation, is aiming to play for one of Newcastle's sides on
Saturday following his return to full training.
q.WESTERN Samoa were caught cold at the end of each half as they slumped to yet
another pounding when the North won 34-8 last night to make it three defeats in
12 days for the tourists.
As snow blizzards hit Huddersfield, North wings Jim Naylor and Jim Mallinder
warmed up the crowd with sparkling scores just before half-time that put their
side 17-3 in front.
In the second half Western Samoa did little to dent the North's superiority,
which was emphasised when Rob Liley and Richard Arnold crashed over for tries
in 78 and 81 minutes to give their team an overwhelming margin.
Western Samoa fielded none of the Test team that so proudly drew with Scotland
last month.
q.SWANSEA became the first club to clinch a Heineken European Cup semi-final
place when they edged out French club Castres 22-10 in a thriller at St Helens
last night. The Welsh club had needed a six-point margin to win the pool.

THOUSANDS of rail passengers throughout Scotland were delayed yesterday, after
a lorry struck a bridge near Kirkintilloch, Dunbartonshire.
The damage forced engineers to close the bridge for repairs and virtually all
services from Glasgow Queen Street were affected, including the busy Edinburgh
shuttle service, Stirling, Dunblane, Perth, Dundee, and Aberdeen.
Nobody was injured in the accident yesterday afternoon, in which a lorry struck
the parapet of a bridge carrying a road above the railway line. Engineers were
last night attempting to remove unstable masonry before they could carry out
repairs.
A spokeswoman for Railtrack said it was hoped that the work could be completed
overnight.
The line closure forced ScotRail to divert services via other routes, which
meant long delays for many passengers.
A ScotRail spokesman said last night that all services out of Glasgow Queen
Street had been affected, with the exception of Maryhill and the West Highland
Line. Worst hit had been the Glasgow-Edinburgh shuttle service.
``We are trying to run as normal a service as possible but there will be severe
disruption, delays, and probably cancellations.''
The accident also disrupted road traffic, with the B8048 Kirkintilloch to
Twechar road remaining closed last night as repair work continued on the bridge.
Last night, Strathclyde Police revealed that the lorry driver had failed to
stop after the accident at the Drumgrew bridge.
They are appealing for anyone who witnessed the accident or who has any
information about the lorry or the driver, to come forward

TWO Government agencies are preparing to help crofters who want to take control
of their own land, by guiding them through the legal process once a thorough
study has indicated it would be in their interests.
So far, two private meetings have been held between the Crofters Commission and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise. The first move was made by the commission
even before the Secretary of State made his surprise announcement in October
that he was prepared to hand over control of Scottish Office-owned crofting
estates to local crofting trusts.
No-one at the commission was willing to comment yesterday but a HIE spokesman
confirmed that the agency had been represented at an informal meeting to
discuss crofting issues.
He would say only: ``The issue of crofters buying their own land is likely to
become more important in the future and it is important that good advice is
available to them.''
It is understood that a working group is expected to be set up in the new year
to advise crofters on the legal and financial aspects of taking over estates.

IF your idea of festive entertainment is an armchair, a bottle of port, a box
of Belgium's finest soft centres and a Morecambe and Wise repeat, forget this .
. . if you're happy to let some of the most enjoyable festive family
experiences pass you by, that is.
It's a bit nippy out this time of year, but theatres are filled with warmth,
especially when they're filled with the joy of pantomime.
The King's in Glasgow has its usual traditional approach to panto, with Jimmy
Logan turning a shapely leg as The Dame in Babes In The Wood from December 14
to February 3, ably supported by comedy duo Cannon and Ball. The Citizens
Theatre are producing the more traditional Pinocchio story from November 28 to
January 13. Another more unusual choice for panto time is Sinbad The Sailor,
presented at the New Athenaeum Theatre by final year students of the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. It runs for one week only from Monday,
December 11 to Friday, December 15 with a 10am performance on Saturday,
December 16.
For traditional entertainment (aimed at pre-teens), there's no one to touch the
success of The Singing Kettle. The fabulous Fifers - Cilla, Artie and Gary -
have put together a new show which runs at the SECC from December 13 to January
4.
The SECC also has the traditional Christmas and New Year carnival running from
December 15 to January 14.
Edinburgh is buzzing with shows over Christmas and the New Year, with
Cinderella, the ``glamour-panto'' being staged at the King's, with Una McLean,
presenter Ross King, Scottish comedy stars Jonathan Watson and Andy Gray, who
joins actor/angler Paul Young as an ugly sister.
Stuart Paterson's Merlin The Magnificent is being staged at The Royal Lyceum
Theatre from December 8 to January 6. Paterson has been described as
``Scotland's finest Christmas show writer'' by entertainment weekly The Stage.
The Theatre Workshop have their own Christmas show in the shape of Baba Yaga
And The Magic Doll, an adaptation of a Russian folk tale. Performances between
December 4 and 23.
The most enduring of stories, A Christmas Carol has been translated into a
beautiful piece of dance by the Northern Ballet Theatre at the Edinburgh
Festival Theatre from January 3 to 13.
The world's top skaters will be taking up residence at the Edinburgh Festival
Theatre from December 19 to 31 in Hot Ice.
There are entertainments outside Scotland's two main cities, of course.
Stirling's MacRobert Arts Centre is presenting the magical story of The Snow
Queen, while the town's Albert Halls will be visited by the storytelling
spaceman Mr Boom in his Christmas Sing-Song. He'll be beaming down on December
21, 22 and 23.

THE patron saint of Scotland ought not to be St Andrew but St Nicholas. His
most famous miracle occurred while he was a young man, long before he rose to
his later episcopal eminence. Journeying through his native Asia Minor, he
stopped at an inn and asked what was for dinner. The landlord replied that he
had nothing but pickled bacon, rolled out three barrels of it and, with a leer,
invited Nicholas to taste.
But, by divine grace, the holy youth at once saw through him. He realised that
this was not animal but human flesh, the remains of previous wayfarers unlucky
enough to have halted overnight were he had. Quite likely he would end up in
brine himself unless he did something. He resuscitated the three dead bodies,
who disconcerted him by turning out to be demons. They tempted him, needless to
say without success. But at least he made the landlord repent, so he had the
salvation of that soul to his credit anyway.
I nominate Nicholas as the new patron saint because he provides one enduring
image of Scottish politics: the pork-barrel. It is fitting that in popular
tradition he should have changed into an old fool with a white beard who, after
our insistent pleading and merely nominal promises to be good, showers us with
undeserved presents. There could be no more eloquent metaphor of the actual
operation of the political system in Scotland.
Certainly St Andrew should be sacked after the way he allowed last Thursday to
degenerate. Three demons rose again, which might be called Scotland past,
Scotland present, and Scotland future (maybe). None struck me as an edifying
sight.
When, after that day's announcements by Michael Forsyth, I seek a master plan
behind his tenure of the Scottish Office, I am still foxed. I think I know what
Conservatives ought to be, if I understand Conservatism at all. They ought
first to be patriotic, because a nation or any other genuine community is a
concrete product of history, arisen through processes we cannot fully fathom,
and anyway need not. That it exists is enough. The task is to preserve it.
Given that, Conservatives can proceed straight to a quest after the best
practical means of preservation, for which they are well-fitted because
encumbered by universal ideologies. On purely pragmatic grounds, liberal
capitalism must count in the present state of experience and knowledge as the
best means: a capitalist economic order to make us all richer and generate the
resources for resolving social tensions, a liberal political order for us to
act towards those ends so far as possible for ourselves, free of coercion by
our governors.
If Conservatism can be summed up in these two principles, the first presents
Forsyth with an obvious problem: which patriotism? He is of Scotland past in
the sense that he harks back to a time when his countrymen had two patriotisms
in a stable and unproblematic relation to each other. He asks them to accept
that this remains in essentials true.
He may be right, but to prove his point he is led into compromising the second
principle. To preserve that kind of patriotism he sees himself also obliged to
preserve in Scotland an order less capitalist and less liberal than it might
be. It is the kind of order, with excessive public expenditure and bureaucratic
direction of the economy, which failed when applied to Britain as a whole, and
diminished British patriotism.
This relic of the past survives here on a supposition that the Union would
break without it. I do not agree, because I believe the Union rests on a great
deal more than subsidy. In any case, seeing that liberal capitalism works, this
compromise makes Scots less rich and less free. It is also a drag on Britain as
a whole in reaping the rewards that liberal capitalism offers. If that is the
price of the Union, it may not in the long run be worth paying, by either side.
Still, none of those deep questions troubles for one moment the demon of
Scotland present, resuscitated in the proposals of the Constitutional
Convention. Though resuscitated, this Scotland remains a victim to which the
rest of the world owes a living. Since money grows on trees, the only
requirement is for the English to hand over every year a bloated bag of it, so
we can proceed to nationalisation of the whisky industry and other
pleasantries. Why should we care what they think, or if it incommodes them? Our
business is to manufacture grievance, theirs to solve our problems for us. The
details can be left to corrupt local bosses handing out the cash to the most
clamant of their clients. This is an insult to patriotism.
Even for Conservatives, the third demon is less repulsive. But judging from its
muted tones on St Andrew's Day, it has not quite awakened from its pickling in
1707. Its brain is certainly addled. It maunders on about something called
``real socialism'', and thinks the best way to prepare Scotland for
independence is to promote greater independence, to demand at every turn yet
more subsidies in the confidence that England will at some stage refuse to give
them. Here, however, it is wrong. There is no price - no price at all - that
the Labour Party, chief target of the strategy, would decline to pay to hold on
to 50 Scottish seats at Westminster. That is why this Nationalist demon remains
the demon of Scotland future only maybe, and probably not.
Perhaps St Nicholas as a new patron saint is a bad idea after all. I could
suggest St Michael, not because I bear his name, but because he was frightened
of nothing and could look out for himself. I doubt, though, whether modern
Scotland would find his attributes attractive.

EXCLUSIVE
A PATIENT seeking legal aid to contest his further detention in a psychiatric
hospital has had his approaches to five law firms for representation rejected
because he has too much money.
His savings of #1400 make him ineligible by a few hundred pounds.
The Legal Services Agency says there is better treatment for similar patients
in England and Wales, where no financial threshold now exists. The law there
was changed last year.
One reason for the man wanting out is that medication, including injections,
can be forced upon him.
Mr Graeme Keay, of the agency, said: ``It's iniquitous that people in Scotland,
being faced with such powerful measures which intrude upon their liberty and
body, should not have the same access to legal representation as in England.
``It's our view he should be able to get advice from any solicitor and should
not be precluded because of financial circumstances.''
The patient, who is in his 40s and receives #13 weekly income support, had been
in Royal Edinburgh Hospital for a spell and a community care plan for his
discharge was carried out.
The man was taken in again under the emergency provisions of the Mental Health
(Scotland) Act 1984 which allows an initial 72 hours detention then a further
28 days. Now the authorities want to hold him for six months.
Last night, Dr James Dyer, director of the Mental Welfare Commission for
Scotland, invited the man to contact the commission with details of his case.
He felt that means-testing for legal aid for psychiatric patients should be
abolished.
``We are going to approach the Secretary of State for Scotland on this because
something has to be done. People should not be inhibited by cost in getting
legal representation.
``We think it is wrong there should be different rules in different parts of
the UK. People here are being disadvantaged by this and Scotland should be
brought into line with England and Wales.''
q A conference to discuss whether the time has come for a fundamental review of
mental health legislation in Scotland is being held today at the Royal College
of Physicians.

<TEXT>
AN industrial tribunal yesterday rejected a sex discrimination complaint by a
male librarian against Glasgow Caledonian University.
Mr James Digney had told the tribunal he had been applying for jobs since May
last year but had been either unsuccessful or not allowed to apply. On each
occasion, a woman had been selected for the job.
Mr Digney, 36, of Strathbungo, had claimed the women appointed were no better
than he was.
Eight vacancies had arisen within the library at Caledonian University since
May last year while he worked two-and-a-half hours a week serving behind the
counter. In July, Mr Digney was short listed for a library assistant's post but
was not successful at interview.
He was interviewed for another job in January but failed to make the short list
for a research assistant's post as he was considered to lack the relevant
experience.
At one stage, following an unsuccessful interview, he was interviewed by his
head of department and suggestions were made as to how he might improve his
interview technique.
The tribunal heard that, in common with most university libraries, there were
more female than male librarians.
In their findings, the tribunal accepted that Mr Digney had not performed as
well at interviews as he might have thought he had.
No evidence of sex discrimination in the way the university handled the
selection procedure was found by the tribunal.
It was satisfied the university did not only have an equal opportunities policy
but actively took steps to fulfil the spirit of the policy.
In each case it was accepted that the university had appointed the person they
considered to be the best for the post.
The tribunal was satisfied Mr Digney had been treated fairly at all stages.

RACING ROUND-UP
TONY Dobbin has given up his race to be fit in time to partner One Man at
Haydock on Saturday, postponing his comeback until next week.
The rider admitted that the broken hand and dislocated shoulder sustained three
weeks ago is still causing some discomfort and he will not be able to partner
the grey in the Tommy Whittle Chase.
All of this is good news for Mark Dwyer, who has been offered the mount on One
Man but he cannot confirm his availability until connections of Jodami finalise
their plans.
Dobbin's decision to ride out on One Man at Gordon Richards' stables recently
appears to have set back his return to racecourse action.
``It's very frustrating for Tony,'' said Richards. ``He's trying hard to get
fit again. I'm now waiting on Mark Dwyer but I know Peter Beaumont will not
want to keep us hanging on.''
Beaumont, who trains Jodami, said: ``It's 50-50 he will run. We are keen for
him to go to Wetherby on Boxing Day and we don't want him to have a slog in bad
ground a fortnight before the race.''
Should Dwyer be claimed for Jodami, Richards could turn to Richard Dunwoody,
though the champion is set to ride at Lingfield for Kim Bailey on Saturday.
q FRANCOIS Doumen has confirmed the presence of So Far Bold in the December
Novices' Chase at Lingfield on Saturday. Philipe Chevalier rides the French
raider.
So Far Bold has won two of his 21 starts over jumps and has also been placed
four times. His career earnings amount to almost #104,000.
The five-year-old won the #59,880 Prix Montgomery (handicap chase) at Auteuil
last time, beating Blanville (gave 6lb) by two lengths.
Should the Lingfield mission prove fruitful, So Far Bold may return to Britain
on Boxing Day to contest the Tripleprint Feltham Novices' Chase at Kempton Park.
q CHALLENGER du Luc takes to the stage for his second outing over birch in the
Spruce Novices' Chase at Leicester today, where a performance similar to his
debut effort should be enough to win, writes White and Gold.
Martin Pipe has moved steadily to the top of the trainers' championship table,
where he has won more than #250,000 in win and place prize money and is fast
approaching 80 winners, and his Challenger du Luc looks the best bet of the day.
The five-year-old looked as though he needed the run at Chepstow last month,
winning a sustained duel with Jacob's Wife after the last, but having no answer
to the power-packed finish of Seek The Faith.
The Pipe gelding showed when winning two well-contested novice hurdles last
season that he appreciates cut in the ground and a galloping track - he won at
Chepstow in heavy and Uttoxeter on soft - so Leicester's stiff circuit should
suit.
Jenny Pitman's good early season start continues and her Gilpa Valu looks a
good bet in the Sycamore Chase. Gilpa Valu has risen 8lb since his eight
lengths win at Warwick last time, making a total of 13lb since the start of the
current season in which he has won over #9000 for connections.

<TEXT>
EDINBURGH New Tiger Trust runs on narrow rails that oblige it to invest in
smaller companies in Asia's riskiest stock markets. So over the last year, it
has rattled downhill at a cracking pace.
The Mexican financial crisis in December 1994 triggered a crash in share prices
throughout the Far East and predictably, smaller companies suffered more than
their larger counterparts.
But New Tiger found itself weighed down by #25m of borrowings, which only
served to make the situation worse.
Net asset value plummeted 30.4% to 31.13p per share, overshooting a 14.7%
decline in the MSCI Emerging Markets Free Asia Index.
Even the creation of a new index, tailor-made to reflect the trust's investment
in companies with a market capitalisation of less than $500m, failed to
disguise the full extent of the damage.
This Edinburgh IFC Smaller Companies Index, devised for the trust by the World
Bank, fell 23.2%.
Edinburgh Fund Managers raised #135m to launch the New Tiger Trust in January
1994, but net assets are now worth only #87.2m.
``We are aware that it was a disappointing performance,'' said fund manager
Mike Balfour.
But he said the trust had no plans to radically reshape its portfolio. At
present, nearly half its assets are invested in Thailand, Indonesia and
Malaysia.
``The corporate results of the companies we have been investing in are very
good. There have been some fantastic rises in profits, but their shares have
still fallen,'' Mr Balfour said.
The trust must simply take a long view and wait for the rollercoaster stock
markets of the Far East to start climbing again. A recovery depends on foreign
investors flocking back and local investors switching money back from the banks
to the market.
As Asian inflation rates start to come down, local investors may be encouraged
to buy more shares next year. But prospects for a return of international
confidence are difficult to guage and Mr Balfour warned that a sharp fall on
Wall Street could trigger a new crisis.
``If the US market were to crash, the markets of Asia would, as always react
with it and come down more heavily,'' he said.

SOUND speakers are not the most aesthetically pleasing of objects. Although
they serve as the main exponents of electro-acoustic music, there is something
slightly unnerving about a large group of people sitting staring at a
collection of black boxes. None the less, the music emerging from the speakers
in Monday night's ECAT concert offered much to please and, eyes closed, you
could quite easily have been in your favourite armchair at home with a
collection of CDs.
Commissioned by ECAT, the first performance of Robert Dow's When All Is Silent
presented a new-age collection of sounds suggesting a vivid dream sequence.
Saturated (if you'll excuse the pun) with water effects, the balance between
the natural and the electronic was perfectly conceived.
Most entertaining was Larsson's Opening A Can Of Worms. Do you ever feel that
your radio transmitter has been touched by the hand of Techno-death? Larsson's
piece sounds like an unintelligible, nonsensical radio broadcast. Quirky but
never cliched, the blowing raspberries and snatches of Copland's Fanfare For
The Common Man prompted more than a few giggles in the audience.
The cyborg contribution came in Mikael Grahn's The Turing Rejects, a musical
representation of mathematician Alan Turing's test to distinguish man from
machine. Developing into an electronic ``Round Conversation'' culminating in
the vocal triumph of the human over the synthetically produced robot. Creating
an electronic language from the human language, this piece enters a whole new
sound world.
Further contributions from Kim Hedas, Erik Mikael Carlsson, and Jens Hedman
were overshadowed by grandfather of the electronic generation Iannis Xenakis
who showed everyone how it's done in his 1960 Orient-Occident.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has rejected a plea for changes in the way
money passes between the health service and social services to pay for Care in
the Community.
The Scottish Affairs Committee had criticised the present arrangements in its
report on the closure of NHS psychiatric hospitals, particularly the variation
in the joint working of health and social work authorities.
The chairman, Mr Willie McKelvey MP, said the committee considered that the
Scottish Office policy of leaving strategy to local agencies was wrong.
The committee heard evidence of consultants pressured to discharge patients
prematurely, and that bed occupancy rates exceeding 100% had raised the
threshold of severity required for admission.
But while Mr Forsyth welcomed ``the support given throughout the report'' to
key areas of Government policy, he added: ``The committee recommended a change
to the current arrangements for the transfer of NHS monies to local authorities
for care services in the community. I support the existing arrangements, which
take careful account of local variations in need across the country.''

THE high financial cost of the recent spate of electricity company bids was
apparent yesterday when Midlands Electricity said the #1950m bid from PowerGen
had cost it about #4m in the first six months of the year. Further costs are
expected as Midland awaits news following the referral of the bid to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Bryan Townsend, chief executive of Midlands, has not ruled out talks with
another bidder. However, he believes the company can survive as an independent
entity, citing the 100p-a-share special dividend and #54.60 rebate to customers
following the demerger of the National Grid, as evidence that it is delivering
value to shareholders.
PowerGen had promised a 200p special dividend, but planned to keep the National
Grid stake. Midlands will now distribute that to customers so the special
dividend has been reduced to 100p, at a cost of #191m. News of the special
dividend came as Midlands reported a #9.7m drop in first-half pre-tax profit to
#92.7m.

A deep depression fell over England's media crews yesterdayas the predicted
Siberian weather failed to materialise. But Anne Johnstone explains how they
made the most of it
YOU'D have thought the second Ice Age had arrived. Television reporters in ski
jackets hunched their shoulders, rubbed their hands together and anxiously
scanned the sky. Film crews scoured the country for snowball fights.
Journalists and sub-editors from all over England picked up their shovels and
dug out every tired old cliche they could think of to describe the day's big
event. Yes, hold the front page: two inches of snow fell on Kent yesterday.
(Well, parts of Kent anyway. And well, nearly two inches.)
There can be few prospects better designed to tickle the Scots funny bone than
England grinding to a halt at the first hint of a snow flurry. North of the
Border we were only just recovering from the shock news that English cricket
may not turn out to be an endless source of humour when they turned up trumps
with the next best thing: a weather story, or rather, a weather non-story.
``Britain set for wintry blast from Siberia'', announced the Daily Telegraph on
Monday's front page. By that night reporters, photographers and cameramen were
staked out all over England in anticipation of the big freeze-up.
``It was the big story overnight. We put up a couple of live satellite links in
anticipation and all our crews were on alert to get some snow shots,'' said
Phil Wardman, news editor of Sky News. By breakfast time a few flakes had
started to drift down in the South-east but the crew braced to capture the
``White Hell'' in Yorkshire were feeling a bit let down. It wasn't even raining.
GMTV's Martin Frizzell, resplendent in luminous orange ski jacket, had also
been sent to Yorkshire. He entertained viewers from a muddy field which looked
decidely unlike a Christmas card and occasionally examined the heavens to judge
the imminence or otherwise of the big white-out. ``Our weatherman had been
predicting lots of snow and after the mild weather we've had recently, it was
going to be a big news story,'' said the GMTV spokeswoman.
Though the tabloids decided they had better things to write about, the
broadsheets went to town on the story too. ``Cold snap to bring snow,''
announced the Times. A spokesman for the London Weather Centre warned readers:
``The weather is going to be miserable unless you are a skier.''
The Telegraph ran the story on page two and focused on reassurances from
British Rail and Railtrack that unlike four years ago, the network will not be
crippled by ``the wrong kind of snow''.
``We have now modified the filters on the chokes in our engines which could not
cope with the 1991 snow,'' said a comforting BR spokesman. The paper also ran
two helpful weather maps, under the titles ``Why it was warm'' and ``Why it is
cold''.
The Guardian too ran a map, wittily entitled ``Vicious circle'', explaining how
an anticyclone over Scandinavia is the villain of the piece. A second article
offered handy tips on keeping warm during the anticipated freeze-up, including
``Even walking up or down stairs can help to keep you warm.''
Even the normally restrained Press Association was running a story warning of
``treacherous'' journeys to work as Britain was ``gripped by the first icy
chill of the season''. Norfolk was said to be ``grim'' and Suffolk ``bleak'',
with conditions set to worsen in the afternoon.
By lunchtime, despite falling odds on a white Christmas, weathermen, motoring
organisations, and newsdesks were reluctantly admitting that maybe it wasn't
such a big story after all.
``I'd love to tell you that we're in the grip of an icy Siberian winter down
here but it just isn't true,'' said a jovial AA man in London, adding that the
worst problem he could come up with was reduced visibility in parts of Kent.
``The story wasn't what we'd expected. Now we've got the Duchess's diamonds and
frankly snow has slipped down the schedules,'' said Phil Wardman at Sky News.
The Press Association started running a replacement story, explaining that
cloudy skies were keeping most of the country above freezing.
Only the dear old London Evening Standard seemed reluctant to let the facts get
in the way of a good story. ``Snow from Siberia fell on London today,'' said
their front page report, a terrific example of hyperbole in the best
journalistic tradition. The report continued: ``Several small communities
reported a fear of being cut off,'' and reaches an exciting climax with the
memorable words: ``Drifts of up to three inches of snow could arrive by this
evening.''
q PS. A two-line report from the Tass news agency yesterday reported that more
than 160 drunk Muscovites have frozen to death since winter set in last month.
The MAXIMUM temperature in Moscow yesterday was minus 10 Celsius.

IT'S a bit of a fairy tale really: small family-owned construction firm takes
on building barons in the UK's most prestigious housing awards and emerges Best
Luxury House Developer in Britain.
But that's precisely what happened when Mactaggart and Mickel entered the What
House magazine's annual competition - regarded as the ultimate yardstick by the
construction industry.
The Scottish builder won the Gold Medal in the Best Luxury Development category
for Hillpark Pines, which nestles at the foot of Corstorphine Hill, a few
minutes' drive from Edinburgh city centre.
``These are the awards the building trade goes by and the winners can
justifiably claim to build the best houses in Britain on the strength of their
success,'' said Ed Monaghan, Mactaggart and Mickel's general manager. ``We were
thrilled when we heard we had won the luxury development category.''
Not only that, but the accolade follows hot on the heels of a remarkable double
in the National House Building Council's annual awards. Alan Hunter, 36, site
manager at Gilmerton Mews, also in the capital, won both a Pride in the Job
quality award and a Seal of Excellence for his key role in creating a
development of which Mactaggart and Mickel are quite rightly proud.
Situated in a conservation area, Gilmerton Mews is a tasteful development of
two and three-bedroomed terraced and semi-detached houses, priced from #54,170,
which blend in with the existing listed buildings.
The other good news is that Mactaggart and Mickel operates a Major Ownership
Scheme (MOS) through which purchasers need, if they wish, finance only 80% of
the purchase price of a property. At Gilmerton Mews, for example, that would
reduce the basic purchase price to just #43,336.
The remaining 20% interest in the property is retained by the company but can
be bought out at any time by the owner, or it can be maintained to be repaid on
the sale of the house, or if the original buyer ceases to live in it.
As well as Hillpark Pines and Gilmerton, Mactaggart and Mickel has three other
Edinburgh developments.
At Colinton there are Torphin Bank, a mix of three-bedroomed semi and four and
five-bedroomed detached villas, priced from #94,113 (Major Ownership Scheme
price #75,290); and Bonaly, a development of three-bedroomed terraced villas
from #108,320 (MOS #86,656).
At Corstorphine, South Gyle is a development of two and three-bedroomed houses
from #58,803 (MOS #47,042).
Meanwhile in the West of Scotland there are four developments at Newton Mearns:
Mearnscroft - three and four-bedroomed bungalows and villas from #180,107 (MOS
#144,085); Castlefarm - two and three-bedroom terraced and semi-detached houses
and three, four, and five-bedroomed villas from #79,539 (MOS #63,631);
Broomcastle - three-bedroomed semi-detached villas from #82,574 (MOS #66,060);
Higher Broom - two and three-bedroomed detached bungalows from #125,746 (MOS
#100,107); and Eaglesham Park - two-bedroomed detached bungalows and
four-bedroomed detached villas from #152,314 (MOS #121,851).
The Bankhead development at Rutherglen offers one-bedroom flats and
three-bedroomed semi-detached houses from #49,965 (MOS #39,972); and there are
two sites in Ayr, at Greenan - two and three-bedroomed detached bungalows from
#98,307 (MOS #78,645) and Barassie Links - three-bedroomed semi-detached
villas, five-bedroomed detached villas, and three-bedroomed detached bungalows
from #85,172 (MOS #68,137).
However, Mactaggart and Mickel's flagship development is the award-winning
Hillpark Pines. The company chose the site for this exclusive development of 19
four, five, and six-bedroom detached villas (prices on application), quite
deliberately. Secluded and featuring majestic 60-year-old pine trees, the
development exudes an atmosphere of classical elegance and character
reminiscent, perhaps, of a more distinguished era.
``Our director, Bruce Mickel, drew up the designs for Hillpark Pines based on
the work of the famous Scottish architect Robert Lorimer,'' said Ed Monaghan.
``Sir Robert designed spectacular late-Victorian cottages a few miles south of
Edinburgh during the nineteenth century and insisted that each room should have
its own sense of identity and character - elements which we have retained to
provide a range of family homes with highly individual features.
``And we see the award of the title Best Luxury House Developer as an
endorsement of our commitment to quality right across the board.''
Phase one of the development, comprising 10 houses, is complete. Work on phase
two is already under way and of the two houses built both have sold and a
further seven are scheduled for release over the next year.
The pillared entrance from Craigcrook Road reflects the tone of the development
which is concealed from the road by a decorative boundary wall. Pillars are
also a feature of the entrance porch to each villa, and these, along with
latticed windows and doors, create an imposing first impression.
Entrance halls are bright, spacious, and elegant, with pillars again helping to
create a traditional and luxurious feel. Generous sitting rooms will suit all

LOTTERY winner Norah Kiellor learned that she had scooped the #10.6m jackpot
shortly after watching a young relative appear on the TV draw show.
The 75-year-old widow, who has three children and eight grandchildren, was
glued to last Saturday's programme to see eight-year-old Angela in a film clip
from Calshot Activity Centre, Hampshire, which had been awarded a lottery grant.
Minutes later, Mrs Kiellor became an instant millionaire - 10 times over.
Mrs Kiellor, her son Peter, 37, his wife Mo, and their 11-year-old twins Peter
and David were gathered in the living room of her home in Havant, Hampshire.
The family started celebrating after Mo, 40, made sure Mrs Kiellor had the
winning numbers - and the grandmother herself was overwhelmed.
``She got very excited. I just sat there,'' said Mrs Kiellor yesterday, who
confessed to feeling ``all mixed up'' as she arrived to collect her massive
cheque at a London hotel.
Mrs Kiellor had been a winner with a lottery scratch card shortly before
scooping the jackpot.
Her son David, 33, who shares Mrs Kiellor's #40,000 ex-council home with his
pregnant wife and two daughters, bought her winning draw ticket at a local
supermarket - and won her #40 on an Instants card at the same time.
The pensioner, who admitted money had been tight, now plans to spend part of
her win on buying herself and her sons new homes.
``I want a little bungalow on a hill,'' she said. ``I don't know which hill
yet.''
She also planned to share money among her family, saying: ``I want to get the
children set up.''
Mrs Kiellor added that a foreign cruise with Mo was high on her list of
priorities.
She said her husband Harry, a technician at Marconi, had died 15 years too
early.
``I just said the other day it's a shame he isn't here to enjoy this.''
After talking to reporters, Mrs Kiellor, David and Peter rode off in a carriage
drawn by two white horses to Hyde Park, where she was presented with her cheque
by lottery organisers Camelot.
The champagne was flowing as they posed for photographers, but Mrs Kiellor said
she would rather have a cup of tea.
A pensioner neighbour said of Mrs Kiellor: ``She's a lovely lady and is really
fond of her grandchildren. She's very kind and it could not have happened to a
better person.''

IT WOULD be a mistake to read much historical significance into the wave of
strikes crippling France. This isn't 1968, the communists have lost such
authority as they had, and the socialists, as usual, don't know what to do or
say. If this is revolution, it wants a vanguard.
Besides, many of the people refusing to work not so long ago voted for Chirac
and believed, despite all the evidence, that a cure for unemployment was his
first priority. According to a Gallup poll for L'Express, 62% of the French
``disapprove'' of their President now, but in June the figure was only 32%.
Equally the asinine Alain Juppe, trying his hand at resolute Gaullism, had only
30% of the electorate against him in the summer; now 64% could see their Prime
Minister far enough.
The Marseilles dockers are out nevertheless, and the Renault workers have
walked off the job. Railmen, postal workers, and teachers have struck. From
placid Burgundy come the first signs that private-sector workers are joining
the defence of jobs and welfare and failing to give much of a toss for
Maastricht convergence criteria, or the government deficit accrued, in large
part, because politicians of all parties maintained that a strong franc had to
be defended no matter what.
In Britain, where we still believe in fairy tales, there is a persistent myth
that industrial militancy died with heavy industry. This is convenient for all
parties, since it allows them to devote themselves to reducing social costs -
to making people worse off, in other words - without bothering about the social
fabric. British workers work longer hours for lower wages than almost all their
European counterparts, but if the economy fails to prosper that is, somehow,
their own fault, to be paid for by cuts in welfare.
Thus even - or perhaps especially - Labour will have nothing to do with trade
unionists who strike. Tony Blair is delighted to hear of Frank Field's
ingenious schemes to privatise pensions but he would go a long way to avoid a
striking railway or postal worker. What would he make of the unrest in France,
you wonder? Doubtless he thinks that there, but for the grace of Lady Thatcher,
go I.
A penchant for marches aside, there is nothing that really distinguishes French
public-sector workers from their British peers, after all. The fears are much
the same: of a health service destroyed, of an admired rail network ruined, of
pensions and job security ravaged. A Labour administration would inherit the
pent-up anger of the Thatcher years, and sooner rather than later. Or so Blair
must fear.
Much is expected of him, after all, yet the most he has offered is
inspirational rhetoric. He promises change, but the substance of his project
amounts to a declaration that most things, union legislation not least, will
stay the same. When voters wake up, his approval ratings will doubtless go the
way of Chirac's, however pliant trade union leaders prove to be.
In essence, the upheaval in France is symptomatic of a European problem. Among
politicians in every part of the Continent there is consensus, particularly
over inflation and welfare costs, but it is not one in which voters share.
Unemployment has ceased to be a blight on the labouring classes and has become
the spectre haunting all. No job is safe, no future secure. All the education
and training programmes in the world would be too little and too late.
To that extent, at least, it is impossible not to admire the French.
Our shabby politicians, ministering to an increasingly shabby society, can be
as disdainful as they like about a people who refuse to accept ``reality''.
The chances are, however, that their refusal to put up any longer with brutish
incompetence will strike a chord with a British population that long since lost
faith in the political process.
Not so long ago it was fashionable in France to despise the veterans of May,
1968, for their complacent nostalgia and their middle-aged smugness.
Even now the French students marching to preserve their universities wouldn't
thank you for the comparison. Yet if the analogy could be made (and why
bother?) it would not count for much. France shows two things: that times
change but people do not, and that you cannot, even with all the power of the
state, abolish shared hopes and human dreams.
Thirty years from now, with luck, the veterans of '95 will remember those
simple truths.

THERE were fears last night that the diamonds in a necklace and bracelet stolen
from the Duchess of York, part of a wedding present from the Queen, could
already have been recut and placed on the market.
The antique jewellery, valued at #250,000, went missing from the duchess's
luggage during a flight from the United States to London.
The diamonds would find a ready market, according to London underworld sources
- no matter how hot the provenance. It is said the necklace and bracelet had
been in the royal family for generations.
The duchess was not travelling with her jewels while returning from a
promotional visit to America to launch her Budgie the Helicopter products.
She had flown on ahead to London on Concorde, because of an engagement, said
Buckingham Palace. She had to attend a Children in Crisis carol service at
Southwark Cathedral in south London with the Duke of York and their daughters,
the Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice.
The duchess had entrusted her luggage and jewels to her dresser, Mrs Jane
Dunn-Butler, flying on later scheduled flights.
The luggage containing the jewels was last seen disappearing down a luggage
conveyor belt at National Airport in Washington.
Airline officials had told Mrs Dunn-Butler that the suitcase containing the
Queen's wedding present was far too big to take on board the aircraft as hand
luggage.
The theft was reported to the police by the duchess at 11pm on Monday when she
unpacked
her luggage at her home at Kingsbourne on the Wentworth estate near Ascot,
Berkshire.
It has been reported that while Mrs Dunn-Butler is distraught about the matter,
the Duchess of York is not too upset. She believes the necklace and bracelet
will turn up.
London's underworld, however, takes a different view. One Scots-born member
said last night: ``Ice is easy to move.''
Despite the notoriety of the crime, he said had he been involved he would have
expected to pick up #30,000 just for passing them on.
``Already they will have been taken out of their setting and recut.''
The duchess was interviewed into the early hours of the morning as Scotland
Yard launched its investigation.
The missing pieces are part of a set presented to the duchess by the Queen on
her wedding. They are described as matching sets with clusters of diamonds and
are family heirlooms.
A ring and earrings are now all that remains of the set.
Last night the investigation seemed to be centred on Heathrow, an airport which
over many years has gained the not undeserved reputation that it should be
renamed Thiefrow.
A spokeswoman for the duchess said last night: ``The duchess thinks they will
probably get them back. She is quite relaxed, but obviously these items have
sentimental value because they were a present from the Queen.''
A British Airways' spokesman said: ``We have launched an urgent investigation,
in hand with the palace and police.''
Mrs Dunn-Butler has been with the duchess for the last seven years. ``The
Duchess wants to make it clear that she does not in any way hold Jane
Dunn-Butler responsible for what has happened. She has been a loyal member of
staff for many years,'' said a spokeswoman.
The duchess wore some of the now stolen jewellery at a White House reception
given by President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary on Sunday.
The first leg of Mrs Dunn-Butler's journey from Washington to London was on
board a United Airlines aircraft. At New York she changed to a British Airways
flight.
Last night an expert in the jewellery and precious metals industry said:

CUTS in administration costs ordered by the Government could result in 10,000
NHS management jobs being lost, it was estimated yesterday.
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell ordered #300m to be cut from red tape over the
next 12 months, and spent instead on patient care.
He claimed that his blitz on bureaucracy - which applies to both health
authorities and trusts - would mean ``more white coats and fewer grey suits''
in the health service, but refused to state the number of jobs involved.
However health officials said a typical managerial salary was #30,000, putting
the number of jobs at risk at 10,000.
On the same basis some 600 jobs could be at risk in Scotland after Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish Health Minister, announced his contribution
yesterday.
His call for 5% - approximately #4m - to be cut from health boards'
administrative budgets follows a similar demand on NHS trusts announced by
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth in October, which would yield #14m.
The Government was immediately attacked by its opponents for creating the
red-tape mountain as a result of the 1990 reforms, and a trade union official
warned that the axe was liable to fall on lower-echelon staff making a genuine
contribution to patient care while the ``fat cats'' remained at the trough.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said that NHS administration costs
had risen by #115m a year in Scotland since 1991.
``These figures are absolutely breathtaking,'' he said. ``They show bureaucracy
in the NHS has risen by almost 50% since the Tories introduced their crazy
internal market.''
However Mr John Lambie, health officer for Unison, which represents health
workers in nursing, manual, and white-collar grades, said: ``It is not widely
understood what is meant by senior management.''
``Where people are encouraged to have personal contracts you will find that
someone who was an administrator yesterday will become a senior manager today.''
Apart from the three island health boards, administration costs per head of
population served range from #10.50 a year (Lanarkshire and Ayrshire and Arran)
to #18.80 (Highland).
The big spenders in overall terms, Greater Glasgow and Lothian, come about the
middle of the league in spending per head.
A spokesman at Lothian said that the board had already carried out a programme
aimed at cutting back administration in the terms being required.
Greater Glasgow said that following the decision to reduce administration costs
in trusts, it was already working on plans to change its own organisation and
to accommodate the target.
The Scottish Office said that some of the relatively expensive boards would
need to deliver higher savings than others.

A WOMAN died and six others were seriously injured in a multiple smash near
roadworks on the A1 last night.
Fire teams, a medical flying squad from Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and
paramedics went to the scene between Haddington and Gladsmuir, East Lothian.
Three cars and an articulated lorry are understood to have been involved.
Fire teams had to use cutting equipment to free victims and the road was closed
and diversions set up.
The accident happened close to a section of the A1 which is restricted in width
for resurfacing.

A LEADING Scottish law firm has lost an unfair dismissal and sex discrimination
case brought against it by a female solicitor.
Mrs Eileen Paterson, 36, of Pollokshields, Glasgow, is believed to have been
offered compensation by the firm.
Mrs Paterson was fired by Ross Harper &amp; Murphy after refusing to do night-time
and weekend call-outs to visit clients in custody.
Yesterday, an industrial tribunal in Glasgow released an advance notice
deciding in her favour.
Last month, Mrs Paterson, who is married to advocate Robert Skinner and has two
young children, told the tribunal she was removed from the rota after her first
child was born nine years ago.
The tribunal heard evidence that lawyer Mr John Carruthers, 34, who managed
Ross Harper &amp; Murphy's criminal business at their Ingram Street head office in
Glasgow, introduced a new policy last December requiring Mrs Paterson to go
back on the rota.
Managing partner Cameron Fyfe claimed it was essential for Mrs Paterson to be
on the call-out rota because it created ``bonding'' between clients and lawyers
by having the lawyer who spoke to them in the cells also represent them in
court next day.
However, in his final submissions, Mr Jack Quar, representing Mrs Paterson,
rejected Mr Fyfe's ``bonding'' theory and said: ``It was not anything to do
with the case. It was more to do with the public relations of Ross Harper &amp;
Murphy. He made good play of calming down clients in cells, something he had
little experience of.''
Mr Fyfe admitted to the tribunal that he hadn't investigated Mrs Paterson's
domestic situation before deciding to get rid of her.
Evidence was also given that another lawyer in the firm didn't visit clients in
their cells because he couldn't represent them in court as he became ill at the
prospect of cross-examining policemen in the witness box.
Mr Quar said yesterday: ``I am delighted at the decision and so is my client.
We were never in any doubt that the tribunal would find in our favour.''
A spokesman for Ross Harper &amp; Murphy said there had been discussions with Mrs
Paterson regarding settlement of the case before the judgment.
He added last night: ``This has already been agreed in principle between both
parties and we have agreed that her application will be withdrawn.
``We are very hopeful that the matter can be concluded to the satisfaction of
both parties in the very near future.''

THERE is no such thing as a free lunch in Scottish politics, as Mr Michael
Forsyth discovered to his cost yesterday, after accidentally excluding his
Labour Shadow George Robertson from the top table at an official function in
London.
The slight was enough to set tongues wagging at Westminister: had the new-look
``listening'' Scottish Secretary exacted revenge for the drubbing he received
from Labour last week over his constitutional plans?
At the lunch in honour of the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church
of Scotland, Mr Forsyth and his wife Susan were joined at their table by SNP MP
Margaret Ewing, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace, Northern Ireland
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew, President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang, and The
Herald.
However, in a radical departure from tradition for this annual, all-party
event, Mr Robertson and his wife Sandra, who travelled from Scotland to be
there, were left out, and found themselves in another room with junior MPs and
the man from the Scotsman.
By tea-time, Mr Forsyth had apologised in person to Mr Robertson for what was
an inadvertent mix-up. A Scottish Office spokesman said: ``This was an informal
lunch. No doubt Mr Robertson will be invited to join the Secretary of State in
future years.''
Although he was said to have been surprised by his treatment, Mr Robertson was
being diplomatic about the affair last night and would say only: ``The
Secretary of State told me it was a mistake''.
The mistake may come at a cost, as observers claimed it was proof of
deteriorating relations between the two men as the devolution debate
intensifies.
Mr Forsyth's colleagues last night were swift to retaliate by pointing out that
Mr Robertson left before the closing speeches, in which the Moderator, the Rt
Rev James Harkness, warned politicians not to deny the Church its right to
speak on current affairs.
Earlier, Mr Harkness, on his annual St Andrewstide visit to London, gave a
sermon at the Commons in which he evoked the sacrifices of those who lived
through the Second World War and called for a rediscovery of the spirit of
service.
In a message of comfort for Mr Forsyth, who has been accused of failing to
deliver on devolution, Mr Harkness said Jesus never avoided issues: ``He stood
out for what was good, honourable, and true whatever the cost in unpopularity,
even when the cross loomed ahead.''

WHEN they run out of inspiration for their marketing brochures, many estate
agents would admit that they can sometimes lapse into an over-poetic hyperbole
that prompts them to describe a house as: (a) a hidden gem, (b) an
architectural treasure, (c) a place of of special magic.
Aberfeldy-based agents Finlayson Hughes have come up with all three in their
sales campaign for a house in Perthshire. But this is no flight of fancy - the
Old Library at Keltneyburn, seven miles west of Aberfeldy, has the lot. The
house was originally built as a traditional estate cottage and then converted,
around 1880, into a library and reading room. It is believed to have been
designed by James MacLaren, an architect who pioneered the use of the Arts and
Crafts style in a distinctly Scottish manner.
After serving as village hall from the 1950s, neglect set in and the building
fell into dilapidated condition and has been virtually derelict for the last 20
years. But it has now been triumphantly brought back to life as a dwelling by
Blairish Restorations, a firm with an award-winning track record in in
conversions in Perthshire. Since both the interiors and exteriors are listed,
the old reading room had to be restored as it once was - including panelled
walls, stained glass, plasterwork and fireplace.
Such is the quality of the restoration, the property has been shortlisted for
an important award. And, along with its distinguished architectural predigree,
the house has its own touch of magic. It sits in its own ``fairy dell' above
the fast-flowing Keltney Burn - viewable from  its own platform over the stream.
Accommodation comprises: living room, three bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, and
shower room. The back of the house has been extended to provide a large, glazed
dining room and bedroom opening on to the viewing deck. Finlayson hughes is
inviting offers over #150,000.

TEN left-wing Labour MPs voted against the 1p income tax cut at the end of the
Commons Budget debate last night in defiance of party leader Tony Blair's
orders to abstain.
They joined Liberal Democrats and Scottish and Welsh Nationalists in opposing
the cut, but the Government won by 313 votes to 38, a majority of 275.
The 10 Labour MPs were: Tony Benn (Chesterfield), Ronnie Campbell (Blyth
Valley), Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North), Denzil Davies (Llanelli), Dr Lynne
Jones (Birmingham Sellyoak), Terry Lewis (Worsley), Eddie Loyden (Garston), Max
Madden (Bradford West), Colin Pickthall (Lancashire West) and Dennis Skinner
(Bolsover).
The Labour leadership had decided to abstain on the tax cut plan in an attempt
to shed its image as a ``high tax, high spend'' party.
The outcome is good for Mr Blair as the majority of left-wing MPs decided to
toe the party line.
The party last night played down the scale of the rebellion. A spokesman said:
``Only 10 people is a very good result. As far as we are concerned, this is a
very small number of people. It means 260 MPs have abstained.
``After the campaign we have conducted against the 7p increase in taxes under
the Tories, it was not right to have voted against today, and the overwhelming
majority of the Parliamentary Labour Party accepted that.''
Labour Chief Whip Donald Dewar said the 10 rebels would not be disciplined.
``They are all well known to take an idiosyncratic line,'' he said.
The SNP opposed the increase in petrol tax, but was defeated by 305 to 40, a
Government majority of 265.
Earlier, Labour's bid to cut VAT on domestic fuel and power from 8% to 5% - the
minimum permitted under EU rules - was defeated by 307 to 290, a Government
majority of 17.
Then a technical vote to pave the way for all the Budget measures to be
introduced was backed by 315 to 285, a Government majority of 30.
Winding up the five-day Budget debate, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke said the
Government had made ``big progress'' towards its aim of a 20p basic tax rate.
He warned of Labour: ``Handing over to them a great economic recovery would
take us back to recession in a very short time indeed.''
Shadow Treasury Chief Secretary Andrew Smith said: ``This Budget fails the test
of investment, of prudence, and of fairness.''
Earlier, deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine argued that Labour would bring
in a top rate tax of 60p in the pound, claiming that Labour Front Bencher Nigel
Griffiths, MP for Edinburgh South, had put down a parliamentary question on
November 2 asking the Chancellor what the yield would be from introducing such
a rate.
There was some confusion as Mr Heseltine described Mr Griffiths as a Shadow
Treasury spokesman - he is in fact a Trade and Industry spokesman - but Mr
Heseltine countered: ``If I have revealed I wasn't sure he was a Treasury
spokesman, have I revealed something else? That there is a split within the
Labour Front Bench between the Treasury trying to keep expenditure down and and
some other departmental responsibility trying to find the money to pay for
increased expenditure.
``I don't mind which way it is, all I tell the people of this country is that
Labour is planning a 60% tax rate and they are doing the calculations on that
basis.''
For Labour, deputy leader John Prescott said: ``We have made very clear that we
disagree with the general strategy of this Budget, and we have showed
specifically . . . the opportunity to reduce VAT on fuel.''
On Mr Heseltine's claim that Labour was planning a return to a top rate of tax
of 60%, Mr Prescott insisted: ``I have made it clear that we are not prepared
to return to those penal rates.''
Intervening earlier, SNP leader Alex Salmond asked Mr Prescott to explain why
Labour had abstained on a Scottish Nationalist bid on January 21 to reduce VAT
on fuel and had called it a ``cynical ploy''.
To Tory cheers, Mr Salmond demanded: ``Why was it a cynical ploy in January but
right tonight?''
Tory ex-Minister Sir Peter Lloyd (Fareham) said that instead of the 1p tax cut,
he would have preferred the money to have been used to cut the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Alan Beith invited Sir Peter to join his party in
voting against the 1p tax cut.
He said: ``The Government was right to identify as priorities education, crime
and health. But close examination reveals the Budget doesn't shift more money
to schools, hospitals or the police.''
For the SNP, Mr Salmond told why his party was voting against the reduction in
the basic rate of tax. ``It is quite reasonable after 21 Tory tax rises -
that's #1000 a year for the average family - for the Chancellor to give back
some of that money to the people he has taken it from.
``If it's #3bn, that's fair enough. But a choice has to be made as to how that
#3bn would be best spent.''
He said the SNP's choice would be to bring the current 20p lower rate of income
tax down towards 15p instead of reducing the basic rate from 25p to 24p.
q During the debate, Mr Heseltine went on the offensive over the impact a
Scottish parliament would have on inward investment. He claimed that England,
Wales and Northern Ireland would be the direct beneficiaries from the ``tartan
tax.''
The Deputy Prime Minister told the House: ``As I understand the Scottish
dimension, the cost of an assembly in Scotland would be of the order of 3p in
the pound.
``That would be the tartan tax, the cost the people of Scotland would have to
pay. The effect on inward investment in Scotland would be dramatic but it
would, of course, be hugely advantageous to England, Northern Ireland and
Wales, because we would get the inward investment that socialism in Scotland
would deter from going there.
``Those are the obvious consequences of a Scottish assembly and that is why I
do not expect to see it happen.''
Earlier, at Question Time, replying to Tory Bill Walker (Tayside North), the
Prime Minister said: ``If the devolution plans proposed by the Opposition
parties were to proceed, they would undoubtedly lead to conflict between
Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom.''

KIM Bailey, who has virtually discounted Master Oats from the King George VI
Chase on Boxing Day, could still be represented in the race by Book of Music.
As the trainer awaits an explanation for the Gold Cup winner's recent flop at
Chepstow, he is planning a Christmas comeback for one of the most impressive
winners of last season.
Book of Music easily beat Martin's Lamp on his only start last season and,
having recovered from injury, is on the Gold Cup trail as well as Master Oats.
He is entered in Kempton's highlight, for which he is priced 16-1.
``Book of Music will run somewhere over the Christmas period,'' said Bailey,
``but I have not made my mind up where yet. He might go for the King George if
the field cut up but it is only a slight chance at the moment.
``I am not keen to run him in handicaps because he is high in the weights.''

FRENCH Open champion Thomas Muster crashed out in the first round of the Grand
Slam Cup in Munich yesterday - but still picked up around #235,000 for his
trouble.
Struggling with injuries to his right hip and left foot, the Austrian never hit
top gear as he was beaten 7-6, 2-6, 6-1 by Zimbabwe's Byron Black.
But, as a grand slam champion, Muster walked away from the richest tournament
in the game with around #165,000 simply for turning up, and another #70,000 for
being a first-round loser.
In the quarter-finals Black, a replacement for injured American Andre Agassi,
faces Boris Becker, who played with the nerves of his home German fans before
clinching a 6-1, 6-7, 9-7 win over Frenchman Cedric Pioline.
The 28-year-old former Wimbledon champion's serve-and-volley game is perfectly
suited to the fast indoor court. Becker, fresh from victory last month at the
ATP Tour world championship, will be a much harder opponent than Muster.
The 16 players with the best records in the four Grand Slam events in a year -
the Australian, French and US Opens, and Wimbledon - are invited. Other results:
Goran Ivanisevic (Croatia) beat Petr Korda (Czech Republic) 7-6 (7-3), 6-3;
Jacco Eltingh (Holland) beat Michael Chang (USA) 7-6, 6-3.
q BRITISH No.1 Clare Wood reached the second round of the Challenger event in
Paris yesterday, beating Christina Papadaki (Greece) 7-6 (7-4) 6-4.

THE impressive range of large villas in Helensburgh - surprising for a small
town - developed during the last century as Glasgow's merchants and bankers
used the railway to escape from the fumes of the city each evening.
Times may have changed, but Helensburgh's qualities are timeless and its large
houses are still very much sought after.
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison is currently marketing one charming example next to the
golf course on Golfhill Drive. Hillcrest is a detached period villa standing in
well-stocked gardens which extend to half an acre.
The accommodation consists of vestibule, inner hallway with an oak parquet
flooring, a lounge with a French door which leads to the terrace, sitting room,
formal dining room, fitted kitchen with white goods, breakfast room, utility
room - and butler's pantry - and five bedrooms upstairs.
The main bedroom has an en-suite bathroom and access to a balcony. The property
comes with a double garage and out-houses. Offers over #205,000 are invited.

I CYCLED 10 miles home through Paris, weaving in and out of traffic, and did
not see a single car move: around 6pm the entire city had congealed into a
monstrous traffic jam. All the way down the Boulevard Saint Michel across the
Ile de la Cite past the Palais de Justice, to the Chatelet and northwards, past
the Pompidou Centre, each crossroads was a snarled mass of vehicles, often so
tight that even wheeling a bike through them was impossible.
Westwards, near to the church of Saint Augustin, two bemused and
worried-looking coachloads of Cockney tourists clambered down into the road to
leg it to their hotel.
On the whole trip I saw only two policemen attempting point duty. Everywhere in
the city, Parisian motorists, usually so short-fused and snappish, were taking
the strain with an unnatural calm born of fatalism. The jam only began to clear
four hours later.
Without buses or suburban trains or mainline trains into the big stations, with
dozens of potential customers for every taxi, and without the Metro, whose
locked gates have forced the city's tramps into the cold, where they beg at
busy crossroads, getting around Paris is everybody's obsession.
It is an exhausting one. People living out of town are getting up in the early
hours to brave several hours of congested traffic on roads leading into the
city. The private coaches hired by the Government to supply some semblance of
transport leave their pick-up spots in the suburbs at 5.30am.
Bicycle shops have sold out, and Paris has a touch of an old university city -
the jangle of bicycle bells and the squeaking brakes of old and ill-maintained
bikes are new sounds. Banks close early in the afternoons as employees try to
beat the hours of jams which await them later on. The city's museums have
closed down altogether, for lack of staff to maintain them. Yesterday, groups
of Japanese tourists braving the snow and sub-zero temperatures, posed for
photographs at the entrance to the Musee d'Orsay, for a souvenir of sorts.
Sales of newspapers have dropped dramatically - not because supplies are
failing to get through. But because people no longer have Metro and bus rides
during which to read them. Police have stopped giving parking tickets and
fines, and motorists have started leaving cars anywhere and driving through
traffic lights regardless of the colour.
In addition to weariness, the strike has brought its own sort of chaos and
day-to-day improvisation. Roller-skaters, skateboarders, and even people on
motorless children's scooters weave in and out of traffic, irrespective of
one-way streets and skirt between the heels of pedestrians on the packed
pavements.
Hitch-hiking inside Paris is a whole new pastime. The bateaux mouche tourist
boats on the Seine are ferrying up to 1000 people at a time, free of charge, up
and down the river. With everybody suffering from fatigue, cancelled or missed
appointments, not to mention the crush, the cold and the pollution of so many
cars, there is even a new spontaneity and friendliness among fellow sufferers
on the streets. Everyone has horror stories to swop but people's anger is
directed more against the Government than against the unions.
Paris theatres are all but empty and cinema attendance is down by 70%. Big
hotels are hard-hit by a drop in clientele but smaller ones are packed solid
with out-of-town workers who prefer the extra expense to the misery of
travelling. Spending in shops has been reduced by half, even if last weekend,
motivated by some sort of consumer masochism, thousands came into town to visit
Christmas displays in the big department stores.
Firms are arranging for their employees to share cars - ``le car pooling'' as
it is called. Radio stations have phone lines to put passengers in contact with
drivers. Coach companies are lining their vehicles up, illegally, in front of
train stations, to attract passengers for provincial cities.
And more and more people are staying at home, working via telephone and fax.
They call it ``le tele travail'' in French and it will probably be one of the
long-term results of the strikes.

VIV Richards has offered to help settle the dispute between Brian Lara and West
Indies cricket officials.
Lara pulled out of the current tour of Australia at the last minute after
having been fined, with three other players, by the West Indies Cricket Board
of Control for misconduct during the recent tour of England.
``I carry no weight with the board,'' said Richards, ``but I am so dismayed by
the affair that I volunteer to mediate in an attempt to get a batsman, better
than I was, back on track to help West Indies mount a serious challenge for the
1996 World Cup. They need only to pick up a phone.''
Lara withdrew from West Indies' tour of Australia because, it is believed, he
was upset at being penalised for an incident he thought had been settled by the
tour committee in England.
Richards thinks the special privilege granted to Lara to return to Trinidad in
June - just a few weeks after the tour started - has come back to haunt the
WICBC.
``In allowing Lara to quit the England tour briefly and return home on private
business, the board set a precedent that bred more resentment than I have known
in a tour party,'' said Richards.

THE Government was hit by a surprise defeat in the Lords last night as peers
insisted, by 108 votes to 85, on higher standards of training for probation
officers.
The first defeat of this session followed strong criticism from peers of all
parties, including Tory former Home Secretary Lord Carr of Hadley, of Home
Secretary Michael Howard's new system for probation training.
New rules that came into force this week end the requirement for probation
officers to take a two-year social work course. It will be replaced by a
National Vocational Qualification with some higher education content.
Peers, led by former senior Home Office civil servant Lord Allen of Abbeydale,
demanded that the new rules ``ensure that the proposed higher education element
of the required training of probation officers will lead to a professional
qualification which is of a high standard, and is subject to external
validation''.
There were cries of ``resign'' from the Opposition benches when the result was
declared.
A Home Office spokesman said later: ``We will reflect on the points made during
the debate.''
It is unlikely that last night's result will have any major effects on the
Probation (Amendment) Rules.

ALL contributions are welcome when the church collecting plate goes round but
some donations are more interesting than others.
The priests at St Cadoc's Church in Halfway, Cambuslang, were intrigued to find
this week among their offerings a coin which appeared to be an old penny. On
closer examination it was revealed to be not a coin of the realm but a token
with the inscription ``They recorded every man a penny.'' Around a
triangular-shaped symbol were the letters TKSHTWSS.
The penny dropped, so to speak, when the words ``Lodge R.R.A.No.116'' were also
to be read on the coin. It was surmised that the coin had some sort of masonic
connection, but how had it ended up in the collection plate of an RC church in
the West of Scotland, not an institution one would immediately associate with
freemasonry?
We checked with the Grand Lodge of Scotland, where a nice and not at all
secretive chap called Martin McGibbon, Grand Secretary, explained that the
artefact was most likely a mark token. These tokens are issued to mark the
progress of a mason through the craft. The Lodge R.R.A.No.116 was most likely
Rutherglen Royal Arch.
So how did it end up in the collection plate of a Tim place of worship? It was
probably a case of someone ``putting their hand in their pocket and including
the token by mistake with their loose change''.
But in Catholic St Cadoc's? Mr McGibbon pointed out that contrary to some
public opinion many members of the freemasonry brotherhood might ``attend such
a church''.
It looks as if we're Halfway to ecumenism.
Family affair
WE place entirely no significance whatsoever on the information that on the
occasion of the Labour Party conference on local government in Dundee last
weekend, at the Thistle Hotel, where the conference-goers were to be found
socialising, the music was provided by a band called Mafia.
Military stardom
THE Diary was puzzled to hear some of the foot soldiers of the Amalgamated
Union of Engineers and Electricians and Plumbers, or whatever it is called
nowadays, refer to Sir Gavin Laird, their dear and recently pensioned-off
general-secretary, as The Brigadier.
Sir Gav recently took early retirement in return for a deal which gave him a
#30,000 lump sum and his salary until he retires at 65. He will also keep on
the extra-curricular activities, of which there are many since he was and is
one of the busiest boys on the trade-union scene. These include directorships
of such as Scottish TV, Greater Manchester Buses North, and the Edinburgh
Investment Trust.
But it is Sir Gav's devotion to queen and country which has earned him the
military sobriquet. He is a member of the Armed Forces Pay Review Board whose
remit is to advise on pay and conditions for our soldiers, sailors, and
air-people to make sure they keep pace with equivalent jobs in civilian life.
As such, Sir Gav has to travel to inspect armed forces locations and talk to
the troops. In the Services, travel, accommodation, and your tea are organised
strictly on the basis of rank. The civilians who become involved are allocated
a notional rank.
In his senior position on the pay review board, Sir Gav is equivalent to an
army brigadier. Hence his nickname. His friends in the engineering union might
also like to know that Sir Gavin is the equivalent of an air commodore in the
RAF and a commodore in the Royal Navy.
This is a one-star rank compared with the five-star status of a field-marshal.
We wouldn't bet on Sir Gavin getting promoted all the way.
Designs on the job
WHEN Glasgow City Council advertised the post of director of its 1999 year of
architecture and design celebrations, it was obvious that the winning candidate
would come from a small, not to say incestuous, group of people qualified to
run such a beano. But just how small and incestuous is indicated by some of the
names on the short list of five to be interviewed this week.
Candidates for the attractive five-year post (salary not yet specified but the
budget for the whole show is about #8m) include one Rory Coonan and Victoria
Thornton. Mr Coonan is currently director of the architecture division of the
Arts Council of England which was in charge of handing out the title of city of
architecture. Mr Coonan was one of the officials who set up the scheme and
assisted the judges in their deliberations as to who should win it.
Ms Thornton, education officer with the Royal Institute of British Architects,
was one of the judges.
Surely some mistake
DEPT of We Think We Know What They Meant: A news release from East
Dunbartonshire Liberal Democrats tells how pleased Mr John Morrison is to be
selected to stand against sitting Labour MP Sam Galbraith in Strathkelvin and
Bearsden. In fact, he says: ``I am erroneously privileged to carry the Liberal
Democrat standing in this constituency......''
Nice try
IN festive mode, we flicked through the list in this month's issue of Scottish
Rugby which details what stars of the game want for Christmas. David Hilton may
be sleepless with anticipation on Christmas Eve, waiting for Santa to deliver
his Scalextric set. We were not shocked to read that Kenny Logan lusts after a
Barbie doll. Rob Wainwright is not asking for much - ``10,000 acres of the West
Highlands. Knoydart would be nice, but anywhere would do.''
Confusion looms
WE mentioned classroom confusion when a teacher asked pupils about their
parents' jobs. A Hawick correspondent is on with a story about a new teacher in
this Borders town of many hosiery mills who made the mistake of asking this
question and was bamboozled by replies including ``a twister'', ``a greasy
binder'', and ``a bar-filler''.

SO the procurator-fiscal is involved in football again. The football
authorities seem to think it is an unwarranted intrusion into their own little
world. But it has become increasingly obvious that there has been a total
failure to control loutish behaviour on football pitches. Until football takes
the necessary action to keep its house in order, I fear we need Crown
intervention. I would much prefer that not to be the case.
In 1987 the procurator-fiscal in Glasgow fired the opening warning shots in the
Butcher, Woods case.
The message was clear. Behaving badly and contrary to the law on a football
field carried no immunity from the rigours of the law, and a clear opportunity
emerged for the Scottish Football Association to take the initiative in
ensuring there need be no further involvement on the part of the police in
football matches. They failed to take it.
The sense of responsibility expected of every citizen extends to footballers at
work. There is no doubt that players consent to the risk of injury when they
take the field - injuries resulting from tackles made in the course of the
match. They do not consent, however, to calculated assaults by boot, head, fist
or elbow, and it is surely in the public interest for such behaviour to be
rooted out of society wherever it happens.
After the warning shot in 1987 came Duncan Ferguson, a player who, sadly, had
come to the attention of police on earlier occasions unconnected with his
footballing activities. Here he was, on probation, head-butting an opponent.
The football authorities, belatedly, by virtue of the report of the referee
supervisor, tried to head off the Crown with a swingeing punishment
administered without considering the best evidence available, namely the video
evidence, and ignoring the fact that the police inquiries were well underway.
But was it in the public interest for the procurator-fiscal to call to book a
citizen on probation for an assault which breached that probation, even though
the offence took place on a football field? Of course it was.
Discussion is now continuing about whether guidelines should be issued by the
Crown. They would be welcome. Let's hope such guidelines differentiate between
on-the-ball offences, which should be the domain of the referees, and
off-the-ball offences, which could be of interest to the police.
Thus the over-zealous late tackle which may cause injury to an opponent should
be dealt with by the referee but felling your opponent with a right hook to the
chin 50 yards from the action should be dealt with not only by the football
authorities but also by the police. There is surely no injustice there.
The cry for such guidelines has grown louder following the most recent
involvement of the procurator-fiscal - at the Rangers v Aberdeen match on
November 11 and then at the Partick Thistle v Aberdeen match on December 2. The
timing shows that the Crown's patience is wearing thin. Think of it; 1987 to
the Ferguson case in 1994, and now the latest quick response to on-field
indiscipline in November and December 1995.
All these incidents took place in Glasgow. That prompts the suggestion that the
procurator-fiscal in Glasgow is exercising his discretion differently from his
counterparts elsewhere. That may be so, but many of the high-profile games are
played in Glasgow and if you want to make a point in the public interest,
choose a high-profile game.
If you are a high-profile footballer, then with the high salary comes the
high-profile responsibility.
Throughout, the Scottish Football Association has remained consistent in one
particular aspect - they are not prepared to consider what is usually the best
evidence available, namely video evidence. In these circumstances how can
anyone have faith in football's capacity to deal with its own problems when it
maintains the charade of ignoring such evidence. It is interesting now that the
SFA Council will consider the question of video evidence early in 1996.
So what about the players and their employers accepting some responsibility? It
is club officials who sit on the SFA disciplinary committee, and clubs play a
major part in the constitution of the Scottish Football Association. They have
the solution in their hands - to ensure a code of conduct among their players
which must be honoured, and, if breached, the culprits denounced and punished
swiftly.
Further, the current SFA rules could permit a player to be cautioned 16 times
before he is suspended. Cautions are rated on a points level from 1 to 3. If a
player commits 16 one-point offences only then would he be suspended. In Italy,
the equivalent number is 4. Their system is to employ an independent magistrate
who sits every Wednesday to rule on the weekend's activities and issue
appropriate suspensions and punishments. Any appeal is dealt with on the Friday
and there can be no spurious appeal designed to ensure a player is available
for a vital match coming up that weekend.
In football, we have even had the incredible situation where a player is
virtually encouraged to be booked in certain matches to take himself over the
points limit and have a suspension served prior to a major match in the future.
How can anyone, quite apart from the Crown, have any faith in such a system.
Football must get its house in order. It is only in the wake of initiatives
from the procurator-fiscal that this appears likely.
Football is the national sport and plays a very important part in the lives of
a huge number of Scots. It is a major interest, a discussion point, a release
from day-to-day drudgery and even from social deprivation. It is critical to
the fabric of Scottish society.
In these respects, our thanks are due to the procurator-fiscal.
q Jock Brown is a sports broadcaster and a sports law consultant with Harper
Macleod.
Jock Brown argues that football has failed to clean up its act and can hardly
complain now that the procurator-fiscal has stepped in to do it

DEPUTY Labour leader John Prescott (above) was taunted in the House yesterday
over the poem, A Political Kiss, by New Zealand author Fleur Adcock. Published
in the latest edition of the Poetry Review, it is a fantasy about Mr Prescott.
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine read an extract, to Tory laughter: ``In
the dream I was kissing John Prescott, or was about to kiss him; Our eyes had
locked, and we were leaning forward avidly forward, lips out-thrust, certain
protuberances under our clothing brushing each other's fronts - when my mother
saw us, and I woke up.''
Mr Heseltine commented, to renewed laughter: ``I must say it was a merciful
release for somebody.''
Fleur Adcock has already shared a passsionate moment with one of Mr Prescott's
parliamentary colleagues, it emerged yesterday.
She says in the poem that she has never actually kissed an MP, but Labour MP
Austin Mitchell admitted he had a ``long passionate, unforgettable embrace'' 35
years ago with Ms Adcock, when they were both at the University of Otago.
Mr Mitchell, MP for Great Grimsby, said: ``I suppose Fleur would say I was not
an MP at the time. Well, I am now. She was librarian at the university and I
was a lecturer in history. It was after a university party.
``She may have totally forgotten the occasion, but I haven't. How could I?''
Mr Prescott has declined to comment on the poem.

SOMETIMES the grandest place names turn out to have rather prosaic meanings.
Near St Boswells in the Borders, ``Tripondium'' sounds as if it might have
connections with the Roman invasion - in fact it's just a posh name for a trio
of recently-created fishing ponds.
The site, along with planning permission for a farm house, is being sold
through the Kelso office of FBR Ltd and the Edinburgh office of Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley at an asking price of over #95,000.
Located about 40 miles south of Edinburgh, Tripondium offers the opportunity to
develop a private home with its own field, established wood . . . and, er,
ponds.
Alternatively, it could be developed as a self-contained business with three
fishing ponds and holiday chalets on the 35-acre site. Outline planning consent
for the holiday chalets has been granted by the local authority.

THE Government was accused last night of deliberately breaching its commitment
to grant the Post Office greater commercial freedom, following a Treasury
decision to almost double the amount of profits it claws back each year.
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce said a pledge given in May by
the-then President of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, had been
ignored in favour of the ``short-term interests of the Tory Party''.
Figures published in last week's Budget show the amount the Post Office will
have to hand back to the Treasury over the next three years has been increased
from #524m to #925m as part of the Government's efforts to find money to pay
for tax cuts.
Mr Bruce today will table questions in the Commons in an effort to force the
Government to concede that it has broken its promise to keep the figure - the
External Finance Limit (EFL) - ``at about half the Post Office's forecast
pre-tax profits'' in this year's Budget.
Under last year's plans, the Post Office was to have paid the Government #178m
over the next three financial years, roughly half its #472m profit before
paying corporation tax. Instead, it will have to come up with #298m in 1996-97,
#317m in 1997-98 and #310m in 1998-99.
Post Office managers claim the Treasury's larger-than-expected slice of their
profits will sharply reduce the amount they have available to invest, and may
lead to a 1p increase in the price of first and second class stamps next year
after a two-year price freeze.
Mr Bruce said Mr Heseltine's statement in May, after the Government failed to
persuade its back benchers to back Post Office privatisation, had been supposed
to usher in an era of greater commercial freedom for the company.
``It is now clear that in their desperation to buy votes with tax bribes, the
Government has decided to dump the commitment to let the Post Office keep 50%
of its post-tax profits and is determined to milk it for all the money it can
decently get its hands on.
``The result will be higher prices for stamps and less investment in this key
industry. Yet again, we see how in this Budget the national interest comes
second to the short-term interest of the Tory Party.''
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday insisted it remained committed
to achieving an EFL of 50%, and made clear the decision to increase the figure
over the next three years was imposed by Treasury Ministers.
A spokeswoman said: ``The Government remains committed to the May statement,
but the objective will take longer to achieve than planned.
``All of us recognise that the public expenditure round this year has been
extremely difficult, with pressure for additional savings.''
A Post Office spokesman said the ``huge amount'' of money the Treasury will
draw from the Post Office's forecast profits will force the organisation to
seek efficiency savings, and will ``almost inevitably'' lead to an increase in
the price of stamps.
In his May statement Mr Heseltine said: ``Although no responsible Government
could undertake to ring-fence the Post Office entirely from the pressures on
public spending, I am prepared to agree that in future we shall aim to set the
EFL at about half the Post Office's forecast post-tax profit.''
He added: ``I hope to make progress in that direction this autumn.''

CALEDONIAN Publishing, which owns The Herald and Evening Times, raised
operating profits by 23% to #10.2m in the year to end-September.
The increase in profits was achieved in spite of the fierce newspaper price war
and an #800,000 increase in newsprint costs.
Even though newsprint costs are set to rise by another #3m in the current
financial year, Caledonian expects to achieve a slight increase in trading
profits.
After interest charges of #5.4m, Caledonian, the management buy-out company
which acquired The Herald and Evening Times from Lonrho in May 1992, made
pre-tax profits of #4.7m. It made a #2.8m loss in the previous period, after
taking a #5.8m exceptional hit for redundancy costs and the move to electronic
pagination.
Turnover was up 3% at #60.5m.
Caledonian, which began printing the Scottish Daily Mail on January 9, brought
in more than #1m of revenue and #321,000 of profits from this activity.
Liam Kane, Caledonian's chief executive, highlighted the success of The
Herald's recently-launched radio and television advertising campaign and of the
promotional campaign to boost sales of the Evening Times.
During the year to end-September, the average daily circulation of The Herald
was down 3584 on the previous 12 months at 107,259.
However, the advertising campaign boosted average daily sales to 110,633 in
October from 104,712 the previous month. Sales in November were maintained
around the 110,000 level.
Mr Kane said: ``Under new editors, they (The Herald and Evening Times) are
looking better, have much more to read in them and are attracting new readers.''
He added: ``We are pleased to have managed a creditable performance in a very
difficult market, with cover price cutting squeezing us from one side and huge
rises in the cost of newsprint squeezing us from the other.''
Mr Kane believed Caledonian Information &amp; Media Services (CIMS), which has put
The Herald and Evening Times on the Internet, was one of the most exciting
developments anywhere in the British newspaper industry. CIMS has also launched
prestigious clients such as Bank of Scotland on to the Internet.
Commenting on recent press speculation, he said Caledonian had not received a
bid and was not in talks with any potential purchaser.
Referring to the recent #85m sale of Scotsman Publications to David and
Frederick Barclay, Mr Kane said: ``It is unlikely that any of our shareholders
would be excited by a pro-rata bid for Caledonian.''
Acknowledging that flotation had been held up by the Daily Telegraph's decision
to join the newspaper price war, Mr Kane envisaged that Glasgow-based
Caledonian might be able to come to market in the ``early days of a new Labour
Government or a revitalised Tory one''.
He said Caledonian might consider the acquisition of one or two metropolitan
morning newspapers prior to flotation, adding: ``A larger, weightier vehicle
should be easier to float and easier to get the right price for.''

THE electricity company reporting season continues with Northern Ireland
Electricity (NIE) announcing an 8% increase in interim pre-tax profit to
#47.7m. Controllable costs were reduced in real terms by 6% per unit sold.
Chairman David Jefferies said the continued progress had been achieved even
though the recovery of #10.1m of allowable costs was postponed. The 14.9% share
buy-back in August, at 397p, boosted earnings per share and further benefits
are expected over the full year.
The proposed 250MW Scottish interconnector represents a major investment for
NIE and is expected to be an important source of revenue.
NIE is one of the few remaining independent electricity companies. Despite the
encouraging trading statement its shares dropped 9p to 450p.

ALAIN Prost will be driving for McLaren Mercedes next season, though not in
Grand Prix races.
The Frenchman, who quit Formula One two seasons ago after winning his fourth
title, had fuelled speculation that he was about to return by taking part in
practice sessions. But McLaren announced yesterday he will join the team next
year only as part of their background technical group.
``There is no question at all of Alain Prost racing for us next season,'' said
McLaren spokesman Norman Howell. ``He will be driving our cars, but not in
Grand Prix races.''
Prost said he would enjoy his new role. ``I am looking forward to working with
McLaren in such an exciting new position,'' the Frenchman said. ``It will be a
great challenge for me to take on the technical aspects of this role.''
McLaren managing director Ron Dennis said Prost would add his knowledge and
experience as an F1 driver for 12 years to help McLaren catch up technically
with Williams and Benetton, who have dominated the championship for the past
four seasons.
With Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen still recovering from head injuries sustained
during practice for last month's Australian Grand Prix, McLaren may have to
look for another driver to team up with Scot David Coulthard, who has switched
from Williams.

SCHOOL pupils are to be asked what they think of Labour's plans for Scottish
education when they are published early in the New Year.
Mrs Helen Liddell, who speaks for Labour on Scottish education, said the party
plans a major consultation exercise on its key framework document for schooling.
She said it was important to consult pupils because they would experience the
impact of Labour's plans in the event of the party forming the next Government.
The Monklands East MP was speaking after party leader Tony Blair yesterday
outlined Labour's programme for raising standards in English schools.
Mrs Liddell made it clear, however, that the framework document would have
Scottish solutions to Scottish problems. Some of the key English proposals draw
from current Scottish education policies, including capping class sizes,
emphasising the importance of homework, forging stronger home-school links, and
introducing school development plans.
Mrs Liddell said she was at one with the Labour leadership on raising
standards. ``The issue of standards will be up front. We have to celebrate the
achievements of Scottish education,'' she said.
The Scottish document will focus on the ethos of schools - the characteristics
which make them effective - and how the value which they add to the experience
of pupils can be measured meaningfully.
Mrs Liddell said it was crucially important to equip pupils with the basic
skills needed for a rapidly changing world.
At yesterday's launch, Mr Blair ran into trouble with the teachers' unions for
claiming that three out of 10 English schools were failing.
He said: ``There is no more important issue than raising standards in our
schools, particularly the 30% of schools that are failing.''
According to the English inspections body, the Office for Standards in
Education, only about 2% of schools are failing to deliver adequate education,
while about 10% are said to have serious weaknesses. It said 30% of lessons
were unsatisfactory.
The general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, Mr David
Hart, said: ``Labour's policy seems to be based on false statistics.''
Labour's proposals for English schools include:
q Launching tougher appraisal for heads and classroom teachers and streamlining
dismissal procedures for those who are not succeeding.
q Introducing more adults - drawn from business, the professions, and local
communities - into classrooms as ``teacher associates'' working under the
guidance of teachers.
q Introducing a maximum class size of 30 for pupils under seven and ensuring
access to a computer for every child.
q Strengthening home-school links through new associations.
q Setting minimum standards for homework, with each seven-year-old expected to
do half an hour a night.
q Requiring local authorities to produce education development plans, with
goals for improvements based on school-set targets. There would be sanctions
against those which failed to meet the targets.
Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett said the programme would produce a
``quantum leap'' for standards, offering excellence for the many, not the few.
In a newspaper interview yesterday, Mr Blair said: ``In the past, we have been
accused of being more concerned with equality than excellence, of being more
interested in meeting the demands of the teaching unions than the demands of
parents. From today, no-one will be able to make that accusation.''

QUALITY Street's latest venture in the west of Scotland is extensive internal
refurbishment of its flats at The Waterfront. The first phase has just been
completed, and Glasgow service team-leader Jim Rennie was on hand to show off
the changes.
The first thing to point out was that Glasgow has to reach, or surpass,
standards in other parts of the UK. Your busy executive flat-renter wants the
best going, wherever he is.
He also wants that pleasant feeling of luxury - as in new light and airy decor,
polished beech flooring, and interesting trees and plants (in large pots on a
spacious landing); not to mention fine prints of Richard Akerman's work inside.
Pleasant, soothing, but not distracting. Good to relax with, beside the latest
satellite TV, video and CD stereo systems.
For the first tranche of flats the theme is carried in striking cane furniture
- with tall Rennie Mackintosh-style chairbacks. Designer kitchens have polished
beech floor and maplewood units; and what used to be called white goods are now
the latest in stainless steel appliances.
QS has spent up to #8000 per flat on this refurbishing spree. But it's not
grudged. Quality is a necessity, the company insists.
Demand for two-bedroom flats at The Waterfront - a popular place - is normally
steady. It's interesting that the new situation is creating a strong demand
also, even at prices from #950 a month. The first units were effectively
pre-let before the work began. There are still decisions to be made, of course.
Do you want a utility room, or a dressing room as an extra?
Letting is all about meeting customer needs. And that's why Glasgow is one of
the areas where QS is offering homes available for rent by the week. The usual
period is six months minimum. So, rent by the week is on the menu at London,
Bristol, and Glasgow - for executives who don't fancy hotels. And new leasing
arrangements are also available, from one month to a year, with not only a more
flexible arrangement but a much-simplified format.
According to Paul Mugnaioni, this is probably the first time in the UK such
easy-to-understand and comprehensive leases have been made available. It's what
customers want. It's also a pilot scheme that can be extended as interest
develops.

THE rail regulator, Mr John Swift, QC, is demanding assurances from Railtrack
about its investment plans for the coming year after the disclosure that the
company has boosted its pre-privatisation balance sheet, by setting aside
#1.4bn which could have been spent immediately on Britain's railways.
He may also invoke his right to require Railtrack to keep its accounting
records in a specific way which will allow him to take decisions on its charges
for access to the network and will ensure that the accounts accurately
represent ``the underlying financial position of the company.''
His concerns are set out in a letter to Labour Transport spokesman Brian
Wilson, who wrote asking him to ensure that money paid in access charges is
used for the purpose intended - investment and maintenance of track and
signalling.
Mr Wilson last night called for the postponement of Railtrack's privatisation
until all questions relating to its accounts are resolved. He said it would be
``monstrous'' if privatisation took place on the basis of the single year's
accounts now available.
Mr Swift's letter to Mr Wilson states that he is putting in place monitoring
systems and will take any necessary action to ensure that Railtrack's customers
enjoy the improvement in performance they are entitled to expect under the
terms of the access agreements,
Mr Wilson said ``This letter leaves no doubt that the regulator recognises that
Railtrack's accounts leave a great deal to be desired.''
FEARS that privatisation will mean a less safe railway increased yesterday when
the Government's chief rail inspector confirmed that privatisation was
``inevitably accompanied by uncertainties and risks''.
The situation was aggravated by news that the Health and Safety Executive's
railway inspectorate had deployed all 25 rail inspectors plus ``other accident
prevention specialists'' to monitor Railtrack and its contractors.
In addition to his warning on ``uncertainties and risks'' Mr Stan Robertson,
HSE chief inspecting officer of railways, says in his annual report that the
industry has been restructured ``to a form never previously seen'' and that
with more than 100 separate units heading for privatisation ``many more
companies will be pressing their own interests''.
Labour's spokesman Mr Wilson said the report provided the ``deeply depressing
warning of what lies ahead if fragmentation of the railways continues........
an inherently less safe railway is being put in place in the name of political
dogma''.
The main thrust of the report was that although safety standards were being
maintained so far there was no room for complacency.
The report showed that:
q.The number of train accidents fell from 977 in 1993-94 to 907 in 1994-95,
with significant accidents - those potentially the most dangerous to passengers
- falling by eight to 110.
q.The total number of people killed on the railways, excluding trespassers and
suicides, rose by two to 42.
q.Fatal accidents to passengers increased by one from 16 to 17.
THE Government's rail privatisation policy would not survive a free vote in the
Commons, according to a new poll which shows that nearly a fifth of Tory MPs
want a rethink on the issue.
A survey, carried out for the pressure group Save Our Railways, also found that
two thirds of Tories believe rail privatisation to be unpopular with the
travelling public and 37% think it will be a key election issue.
The findings of the poll - conducted between October 27 and November 17 by
Business and Planning Research International - were disclosed yesterday in
advance of tomorrow's return to the High Court when the pressure group will
apply for a judicial review which it hopes will delay rail privatisation.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth said last night that Ayr should be the
meeting place for a cross-party Parliamentary committee debate on new measures
to protect young people at raves.
Three people have died from the effects of taking ecstasy at the Hanger 13
dance venue in the Ayrshire town. Mr Forsyth said the town had ``sadly
experienced the tragic consequences of drug misuse at dance events''.
He said he would recommend that a special standing committee of MPs would come
to Ayr early in the New Year, to discuss the new Bill designed to protect the
health and safety of young people at raves.
People involved in the rave scene, local doctors, community workers, local
councillors, and members of the public are likely to be among those asked to
give evidence to the committee. Under Mr Forsyth's plans, more powers will be
given to licensing boards to impose conditions with which rave organisers must
comply before getting the go-ahead.
Last night, Labour's home affairs spokesman John McFall described the move as
``long-overdue."

LABOUR was last night celebrating one of its biggest ever leads in 20 years of
System Three polling for The Herald, with its 57% standing being hailed as a
vindication of its UK performance and its home rule campaign.
Our poll puts Labour 36 points ahead of the SNP, which had closed the gap to
just 16% only two months ago in what was ascribed to the summer's Braveheart
factor.
Any failure to improve on this over the winter will lead to renewed criticism
from nationalist hardliners that SNP leader Alex Salmond's tactics are not
sufficiently hostile against devolution.
At the same time, one of the most energetic campaigns ever waged by a
Conservative administration at the Scottish Office - with promises of
decentralisation coupled to dire warnings of the slippery slope to separatism -
has left the Tories mired in the same 13% rating for three successive months.
But there was an indication that Government and Opposition ratings at UK level
may have loomed large - the Blair versus Major factor. This comes with the fact
that fellow proponents of home rule, the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who might
have been expected to share in the home rule glory, have slipped two points to
just 8% in the poll.
The poll was carried out by System Three between November 23 and 28 among 987
respondents in 39 constituencies, and the results include a slightly higher
than usual proportion at 21% of those who could not or would not answer.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson was jubilant: ``Labour's record
standing in the polls is all the more remarkable given that we have the
four-party system in Scotland.
``This poll makes dismal reading for the nationalists, but is even more
worrying news for Michael Forsyth, given that he seems to be stuck on a
humiliating 13% in the polls despite the most hysterical campaign of lies and
disinformation ever launched against Labour.''
The Government always declines to respond to polls but Scots Tory chairman Sir
Michael Hirst said: ``The poll was taken before Michael Forsyth announced
significant changes in the governing of Scotland against which Labour cannot
find a credible argument.
``This poll also doesn't take into account the Chancellor's Budget which would
help save the average Scots family #9 every week. These savings would at a
stroke be wiped out in Scotland by Labour's tartan tax.''
The poll is a bitter blow to the SNP, which was riding high in our System Three
poll as recently as October, when its standing of 30% was the highest for years
and the gap of 16% behind Labour was least. In two months this has evaporated.
But party leader Alex Salmond said yesterday: ``The renewed constitutional
debate since this poll was conducted has been extremely positive for the SNP.
Now that the Scottish dimension is centre stage the SNP are determined to keep
it there and our support will grow accordingly.''
Last night Mr Andy Myles, chief executive of the Scottish Liberal Democrats,
said: ``This poll underlines the continuing unpopularity of the Government. In
particular it should tell Michael Forsyth that his tinkering with the
constitution is an electoral failure. He should stop this dangerous course of
action immediately''.
Labour's rating of 57% support is one of the highest in 20 years of The
Herald's monthly poll, and was achieved in January and July of this year. The
36 point gap represents a 20-point widening of the gap from two months ago.
SNP chief executive Michael Russell put a brave face on the result, calling it
the 49th consecutive month above 20% and pointing out that the survey dates put
the poll before both the Budget and last week's St Andrew's Day concentration
on constitutional issues.
He insisted: ``Over the past two months, the British dimension has dominated.
Now that the Scottish dimension is dominating, the SNP relish the opportunities
to advance in the months ahead.
``We are now in a position to contrast the very real benefits of independence
in Europe with the Convention's puppet assembly scheme, and the Tories'
hopelessly inadequate reforms.
``Labour are vulnerable to a high-profile SNP campaign, as previous poll
figures show, and we have as much support as the Tories and Liberals added
together. Michael Forsyth will be extremely disappointed to have made no impact
whatsoever on the Tories' dismal ratings.''
But Scottish Labour general secretary Jack McConnell said: ``This swing in
opinion shows that Labour's campaign and ideas have caught hold in Scotland. We
have defended Scots for three years against the extremes of this Government.
Voters recognise the benefits that have been achieved.
``This is a vote for real change, not just in the constitutional, but for
social and economic change at the heart of government.''
Mocking past SNP attempts to coin vote-winning slogans, he quipped: ``The
nationalists are in a fix for '96 and after three months in a row, 13 is
obviously a very unlucky number for Michael Forsyth.''

THE PGA European Tour, whose strength has been diluted by the transfer of
allegiance to its United States counterpart of Nick Faldo and Sweden's Jesper
Parnevik, who are soon to be joined by Sandy Lyle, has been further reduced.
Parnevik's compatriot, Jarmo Sandelin, has survived the final qualifying school
just completed in Florida.
Sandelin, Finnish-born and aged 28, was chosen as Europe's 1995 Rookie of the
Year. He won the Canary Islands Open, had four first 10 placings, including two
as runner-up, and finished No.21 with #173,000 in prize-money. He was equal
twenty-ninth in the six-round endurance test held at Bear Lakes Country Club in
West Palm Beach.
The three other Europeans in the starting field of 190 were not among the
leading 40 players and ties who earned their cards. Another Swede, Mathias
Gronberg, finished equal seventy-third and his countryman, Robert Karlsson, and
Ulster's David Feherty failed to make the four-round cut.
Perhaps the outstanding achievement was Andy Bean's. The hulking 42-year-old
former Ryder Cup player was one of six players in equal thirty-seventh place.
The winner of the competition was a 24-year-old Virginian, Carl Paulson, who
had failed to retain his card in this season's campaign.

WORLD champion Stephen Hendry completed his thirteenth successive victory in
the first round of the German Open in Frankfurt yesterday. Hendry beat Joe
Swail 5-2 and today faces Tony Drago for a place in the quarter-finals.
But the Scot found the atmosphere in Frankfurt so different to Preston Guild
Hall where a capacity crowd of 1200 watched him defeat Peter Ebdon 10-3 in the
UK Championships final on Sunday. ``It was so difficult to keep going
considering there were only a handful of spectators,'' he said.
Hendry was close to going 3-1 down. He won frame four only on a respotted black
after overturning Swail's 58-point lead.
John Higgins, second to Hendry on the provisional ranking list and this time in
the opposite half of the draw, beat Chris Small 5-2. Scotland's Alan McManus
beat Welshman Mark Williams 5-1 while Ronnie O'Sullivan, 20 yesterday, lost to
Romford's Mark King, who meets Higgins today.
Other first-round results (English players unless stated):
K Doherty (Ire) bt D Reynolds 5-3, J Parrott bt M Clark 5-2, D Morgan (Wales)
bt B Snaddon (Scot) 5-4, bt N Bond bt W Thorne 5-0, P Ebdon bt Y Merchant
(India) 5-2; S James bt J White 5-3, S Davis bt D Finbow 5-2.
q HOPES of saving next week's #60,000 Belgium Masters appear bleak.
Difficulties have arisen over the non-inclusion of James Wattana and Alan
McManus. A final decision will be made today.

THE Royal Bank of Scotland has successfully challenged a decision by the
Banking Ombudsman through the courts, the first time a member of the ombudsman
scheme has done so.
The case related to a complaint against the bank in 1992. The Royal said that
in his original finding against it, the Ombudsman held that where one customer
paid a cheque from another of the same branch into his account the mere making
of computer entries to the customer's account meant the cheque had been paid
and could not thereafter be bounced.
In a lengthy written judgment, the Scottish Court of Session judge Lord Penrose
rejected this view, stating that the real question was whether the bank had
taken a decision to pay which it had proceeded to implement by making the
transfers between accounts.
The court decision was a blow to the Ombudsman, Laurence Shurman, coming on the
day he published his 1994-95 annual report. This showed that compensation
payments ordered by him in favour of disgruntled bank customers jumped 29% to
#901,000 in the year to September.
Derek Arnott, chief legal officer for the Royal Bank, said the judge had upheld
the group's view that the reasoning behind the Ombudsman's decision was
``fundamentally flawed''. He added that the judgment was ``consistent with
accepted banking practice and removes the doubts which had arisen''.
The Ombudsman has the power to make binding awards against members of the
scheme, but the latter reserve the right to have important test cases heard
before the courts. When this happens the member pays legal costs, which the
Royal has done.
The number of telephone inquiries and complaints in 1994-95 was about the same,
at 18,667, as the previous year, but the total of those looked at in more
detail fell 16% to 6723 and the number accepted for full investigation was down
a similar proportion to 717.
Full investigations resulted in compensation to the customer in 44% of cases,
the same as the previous year. Amounts varied from #10 to #70,000, with the
average up 70% to #2483.
Mr Shurman said there were ``good signs'' that banks were getting better at
dealing with complaints themselves. For the first time in years those relating
to cash dispensers did not top the list. Instead, mortgage-related matters,
which accounted for 15% of the complaints investigated, took this distinction.
Cash dispensers came second at 12%. Mortgages and lending together accounted
for a quarter.
A typical complaint related to underfunding of the mortgage, with the bank
miscalculating the required monthly repayment by, for example, excluding the
capital element in a repayment mortgage. After several years, the mortgage
holder would find that he or she had repaid none of the loan. In other cases,
the bank failed to institute an endowment policy as the customer had expected.
An example given in the Ombudsman's report concerned a bank customer in
Perthshire who remortgaged on stated monthly repayments of #652. After the
remortgage had gone through, the bank said they would be #777. The customer
claimed for the cost of the remortgage of #4000, including early redemption of
the previous loan, plus #38,000 for the additional payments over the length of
the mortgage.
Applying Scots law, the Ombudsman decided the customer was entitled to the
benefit of the original offer. However, this applied only for the first three
years of the loan, during which the interest rate was capped. The Ombudsman
awarded #8777.

SARA Thornton's hopes of being cleared of murdering her drunken husband hung in
the balance yesterday after three appeal judges reserved judgment on her case.
Thornton's appeal, on the basis she suffered ``battered woman syndrome'', has
become a cause celbre for women's rights campaigners.
Her bail was renewed yesterday pending the Court of Appeal's ruling.
Thornton, 38, of Atherstone, Warwickshire, was jailed for life in February 1990
for murdering her husband Malcolm with a blow from a kitchen knife as he lay
drunk on a sofa.
Her original appeal was rejected in 1991 but her case was referred back to the
Court of Appeal in May this year and she was released on bail on July 28.
Her lawyers have produced evidence that she was suffering from ``battered woman
syndrome'' and a personality disorder which together made her vulnerable and
liable to suddenly ``snap'' under the stress of prolonged abuse at the hands of
her alcoholic husband.
However, Crown counsel Brian Escott Cox QC said yesterday the violence and
threats Thornton had suffered were ``very sporadic'' over a limited time.
Mr Escott Cox referred to evidence from Mr Thornton's son Martin that on one
occasion Thornton threatened his father with a kitchen knife, and had to be
disarmed.
On the night of the killing, before going out for a drink with Martin, she
wrote in lipstick on the dressing table mirror: ``Bastard Thornton, I hate
you.''
The stabbing incident later did not involve raised voices, a frenzied attack or
multiple wounds, Mr Escott Cox said.

THE traditional image of Christmas is the sight of the munching family gathered
round the television watching the Queen's speech with a devastated table in the
background sporting the skeleton of a turkey, stray brussels sprouts and some
crumbs of Christmas pudding.
It all looks so cosy and comforting, but what exactly is it that provides that
aura of contented luxury so peculiar to Christmas?
The tree, of course, plays a major part in setting the scene. There are two
camps here. The artificial brigade haul theirs from the cupboard where it has
been stored for the past 50 weeks and set it up in its usual glory. The
realists, however, moan that they miss the refreshing scent of woodland pine,
and unless the carpet is scattered with pine needles then the true atmosphere
is lost. Moderates usually settle for a dipped tree and a blast of pine
fragrance air freshener.
If you really don't have time, or are simply not interested, decorated trees
both natural and artificial are available by the foot at garden centres and
most department stores. You can even have one delivered right into your living
room. But if you still have some Christmas spirit, there's no doubt that great
fun can be had from doing it yourself. Whatever your choice of tree, there's no
excuse for it looking anything less than superb because the shops are
overflowing with packets of ribbons, bows, glitter and tinsel.
First of all make sure you have enough lights to make a good show and define
the shape of the tree, and test them before you put them on the branches. Then
mix and match standard coloured sets with more unusual and eye catching shapes,
such as snowmen or Santa figures. A fairy or shining star on the top, a shimmer
of irridescent garlands, bows and baubles, and your living area is lit up. As a
final touch, wrap a few old shoe boxes and cereal packets in Christmas paper to
hide the tree stand.
Carrying on the greenery theme, if you want to introduce an element of log fire
cosiness, and you have a substantial mantel, then a decorated garland of
foliage is ideal. Make sure it's roughly the same shade of green as the tree,
and if possible, try to match up any ribbons or bows. Again there's a natural v
artificial argument, and although many magazines claim these garlands are
simple to make using fresh foliage, they can look a bit challenging. Like
trees, they can be bought in fresh or artificial form from garden centres and
department stores. Some stores even have them made up in the standard swag and
tails widths so that they can be draped along the curtains as well. Smaller
plants also have Christmassy associations, and they make good-looking
decorations. Poinsettias, with their remarkable red leaves, and winter cherries
are inexpensive but look effective on shelves or small tables. In the case of
the winter cherry, make sure it's placed well out of reach of small children.
The indispensable form of foliage at this time of the year has to be mistletoe,
traditionally hung from light fittings in the hall and sitting room. If you
want to play safe, incorporate yours into a candleholder, so that you know
where it is and need only get caught when you want to.
Table decorations are becoming increasingly adventurous, not only are there
loads of varieties of centrepieces, but the actual cloths, napkins, and glasses
are becoming increasingly customised. If you don't have a dishwasher, or just
can't be bothered with the mess of crockery and don't mind a paper plate, you
can eat your turkey from a variety of holly and ivy nests, a Rudolph platter,
or even some Christmassy Mickey Mouse types.
Matching cups and glasses take care of the drinks, there's co-ordinating
cutlery, and the only effort that's needed to clear up the debris is a quick
run with a plastic bag. Once you've got the table looking splendid, a striking
centrepiece will put the icing on the cake. Musical miniature Christmas trees
are the most popular, but there are lots of quite substantial candle holders
with varying amounts of glitter and greenery, which can serve as decorations in
their own right in other parts of the room before being drafted into a starring
role on the table on the day itself.
The finishing touch for the table layout has to be crackers, and it's worth
spending a few bob on a decent box, so that they look good on the plate, the
paper hats fit more than a six-year-old, and the meal doesn't fall flat before
it's even been served.
One of the most striking Christmas decorations is the lighted candle bridge,
which seems to have enjoyed a massive jump in popularity in the past three or
four years. This looks most appealing when placed, as the old song says, in the
window, and given that all you have to do is put it on a suitable surface and
plug it in, it has to be the most cost-effective Christmas decoration in terms
of labour that has ever been invented. To get the most from it, put it beside a
bunch of seasonal fresh flowers and it will illuminate them perfectly.
And for that final touch to add the spirit of Christmas? As well as the well
stacked festive cocktail cabinet, go one better and toast the season with some
champers, but don't bubble over in terms of cost unless you really want to.
There's seldom been such a comprehensive selection of good sparkling wines to
suit every pocket, and no matter how much you've spent, if you lash out on a
floor-standing ice bucket, complete with a sprig of holly, you can be sure of
oozing style at least.
Seeing your home take on a stylish and festive look is everyone's aim, and
Stephanie Davis finds that you needn't empty your purse or your reserves of
energy in the attempt

<HEADLINE>Seagull rescuer gets damages from driver</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975028288</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A `GOOD Samaritan'' was knocked down by a car as he tried to rescue an injured
seagull from a busy road.
Andrew MacDonald's good deed left him with a broken leg and face cuts.
Yesterday, he was awarded #12,500 damages after he sued the driver of the car
which struck him in Harbour Road, Inverness, in February 1992.
Inverness Sheriff Court heard that Mr MacDonald, of Torr Gardens, Dores, by
Inverness, stopped to rescue a seagull fluttering about on the road.
After lifting the bird into the safety of a garden, Mr MacDonald returned to
his car.
As he was about to open the driver's door he heard the bird squawk and feared
it may make a lunge back on to the road for a nearby bread roll.
Before he could move the bread, he was struck by the oncoming car, driven by Mr
Alexander Ross, of Culduthel Road, Inverness.
Mr Ross claimed Mr MacDonald had been crouched beside the car and he couldn't
see him.
Sheriff Donald Booker-Milburn accepted Mr MacDonald's version, that he had been
standing upright, and that there had been nothing to prevent Mr Ross from
seeing him.
The sheriff said: ``It is probable that he failed to notice Mr MacDonald
because he was paying attention to the flow of traffic ahead being controlled
by a Stop/Go sign.''
However, he added: ``Mr Ross could easily have given Mr MacDonald a wider berth
and, had he done so, the accident would not have happened.
Mr MacDonald was reluctant to comment about his victory last night in case of
an appeal.
Mr Ross, 73, said: ``I obviously hit the man but whether it was my fault is
debatable. The police did not charge me.''

AN addict was caught with a large haul of drugs the day after he was jailed.
Prison officers found heroin, cannabis resin, diazepam, and Temazepam capsules
when they searched William McKay.
However, a judge showed McKay, 32, mercy yesterday after he admitted possessing
the drugs with intent to supply them in Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow, on January
12 last year.
Mr Murray McAra, defending at the High Court in Glasgow, said McKay was now
drug-free and counselling young addicts.
Mr McAra read out a letter from one teenage addict who wrote: ``It is a lot
easier to talk to Bill because he has been there and done it.''
Asking Lord Weir to defer sentence, Mr McAra said McKay had been an addict for
16 years but he added: ``His life has changed and he has become a powerful
voice for good.''
Lord Weir told McKay, of Sumburgh Street, Cranhill, Glasgow, that if he were to
sentence him on his record and for the offence, he would go to prison for seven
years.
The judge said it may be a risk but he was deferring sentence for six months to
see if McKay could keep out of trouble. In that event, said Lord Weir, he would
probably defer sentence for a further year.
Lord Weir continued the case to the High Court in Edinburgh on June 6.
Mr Colin Harris QC, prosecuting, said the prison governor got information that
McKay, who was in the prison hospital, possessed drugs.
McKay was taken from the hospital unit to a cell, where he produced a tobacco
tin from his trouser pocket. It contained heroin with a street value of up to
#2640.
Mr Harris said the officers searched McKay and found cannabis resin, 100
diazepam tablets, and 40 Temazepam capsules with a total street value of #690.
Mr McAra said that, the previous day, McKay had been jailed for 18 months at
the High Court in Airdrie for drugs offences.
When taken to the prison he was searched and no drugs were found on him.
McKay, who had suffered illnesses - including gangrene - from his heroin
addiction, was in the prison hospital when another inmate approached him.
This man threatened him with violence and gave him the drugs to deliver when he
was eventually transferred to ``A'' hall.
Under the arrangement, McKay was to keep some of the heroin for his own use.
Mr McAra asked the judge to discount the street value of the drugs as they were
found in prison ``where they are part of the prison currency''.
He said the lowest point of McKay's life was on his release when he tried to
commit suicide with an overdose of diazepam.
Since then he has attended Glasgow Community Drugs Project, which has
transformed his life.
Mr McAra said McKay, who is married with two sons, intends to stay off drugs
and devote his life to helping others do the same.

<TEXT>
THE first blast of winter snow was heading north across the Border last night
after hitting England.
Some places in Scotland experienced the odd flurry of sleet during the day
yesterday but by evening snow was beginning to fall on higher ground in the
Borders, across Tayside, and into the Eastern Grampians.
A spokesman for the Glasgow Weather Centre said: ``Snow is likely to become a
feature, particularly in hilly areas down to a few hundred feet, by the
morning.''
A London Weather Centre spokesman said an easterly airstream, which originated
in the steppes of Siberia and picked up moisture over the North Sea, was to
blame.
In England, motoring organisations reported widespread problems yesterday as
snow and ice made many roads treacherous. East Anglia, Kent, and Cambridgeshire
were badly hit in the morning rush and again as beleaguered commuters struggled
home, by which time the freeze had also spread into many northern areas.
The AA and RAC last night reported problems on roads as far apart as Kent and
County Durham.
RAC head of campaigns, Mr Edmund King, advised motorists to check that their
cars had anti-freeze, to carry a blanket in case of breakdowns, and to allow
more time for journeys.
The snow came as bookmakers reported a flurry of bets on a white Christmas.
William Hill cut the odds against snow falling in London on December 25 from
10-1 to 8-1, while Ladbrokes slashed them still further, from 7-1 to 5-1, after
taking a #3500 bet from one punter in Acton, west London.
``The current 5-1 is the shortest odds we have ever offered in the first week
of December. We are certainly overdue a pay-out as we haven't paid out since
1976,'' said a Ladbrokes spokesman.
q.A squad of four navigation experts has been formed to reduce the death toll
on Scotland's mountains this winter.
The Scottish Mountain Safety Group will teach climbers the technique of using a
compass and map, how to spot avalanche conditions, and the use of ice-axes and
crampons.
Thirty people have died in the Highlands so far this year and a report has
shown that poor navigation and ignorance of avalanche conditions were major
contributors to the fatality figure.

INTER-DISTRICT TOURNAMENT:
EDINBURGH fly south today to fire the first shots in the inter-district
tournament in an effort to prevent the Exiles from repeating last season's
clean sweep at the first time of asking.
Two hours later in Kirkcaldy (7pm) North and Midlands and Glasgow are in action
in a competition which is particularly relevant this season in light of places
in Europe next season probably up for grabs and, of more imminent interest,
competition for places in the national side very much on the agenda.
Glasgow, who had already lost Ian Jardine and Kenny Logan due to injury,
suffered another last-minute call-off yesterday when captain Fergus Wallace
fell victim to flu and was replaced by Jim Brough of Stirling County.
Wallace, who has recently recovered from the leg-break which sidelined him for
much of the premiership season, was keen to press his claim for advancement
during the inter-district series and is desperately disappointed to be losing
out again.
Edinburgh, too, are missing key players. For instance, injuries to hookers
Graham Ellis and Paddy Haslett mean that Grant McKelvie, of Watsonians, makes a
district debut and the Edinburgh selectors have also been denied the servies,
through injury, of Duncan Hodge, Graham Beveride, Jeremy Richardson, and Andy
Macdonald.
Nevertheless, coach Graham Hogg is confident that the Edinburgh selection is a
strong one and that his players all know that the championship is important.
Hogg, who favours districts in Europe - at least districts in some shape or
form which would cater for the country's top players - is convinced that if a
recognisable entity like Edinburgh were to get the nod from Murrayfield then
they would not be lacking in support and would be a combination with which fans
could identify.
Yesterday, the Exiles - who have just returned from training camp in Portugual
- were coy in the extreme about their future role in rugby life. Secretary
Fulton Paterson declared that all public pronouncements about tomorrow's game,
or anything else for that matter, were to come from SRU representative Iain
Laughland, who was en route to Scotland for a meeting, and selector Colin
Fisher, who was unavailable.
The Exiles' reticence is a symptom of the uncertainty which surrounds their
future should the inter-district championship fall victim to fixture congestion
and a revamped district set-up to take account of the European championship.
``We don't want players, or even the coach, Alistair McHarg, saying anything
that we might later regret and that is why everything has to be channelled
through Iain,'' said Paterson.
So, the Exiles will do their talking on the pitch. None will want to speak
lounder than Eric Peters, the Bath back-row man omitted from the Scotland side
which met Western Samoa.
He is at No.8 for the Exiles today, as will be Edinburgh's Stuart Reid, the man
who took his place in the national XV.

OWNED on a 50/50 basis by Swedish interests and by General Motors, Saab is in
the annoying situation of seeing sub- stantially increased sales, which are up
by one fifth in the UK this year, hit by currency movements and its own heavy
investment in future model programmes.
Linked with the world's biggest vehicle manufacturer, Saab remains an island of
independent technical thought, and the industry needs as many of those as
possible.
It always seems curious that, while Saab is a Swedish-US company, its president
Keith Butler-Wheelhouse is British. But although its production levels mean
that it is, in world terms, something of a niche manufacturer, Saab has a
clearly defined customer base in each of its international markets. The idea of
Swedish design and build quality has its own appeal, and nobody elsewhere has
nationalistic hang-ups about it.
In the 9000 range the appeal is certainly not whizz-bang styling or an
extravagantly presented interior. Saab's larger model, available through the
range as a CD four-door or as a CS hatchback, costs between #17,995 and
#23,995, the higher figure being the price of both the very fast 2.3-litre
turbocharged Aero and the top-rated V6 Griffin.
In either body style the 9000 looks like what it is, an up-dated eighties
design. There are some ungainly lines at the rear of each body type, but they
can be forgiven because one of the great appeals of this model range is its
enormous boot capacity. The passenger cabin is very roomy too, to the extent
that when you settle comfortably in the back seats, you wonder why other
manufacturers in this class are so stingy with accommodation.
There is nothing flashy about any Swedish car interior, and the 9000 continues
that rather austere approach, in materials, colour scheme and layout, although
it has splashed out with two-tone upholstery in the cars with non-leather trim.
An excellent driving position features a low-set steering wheel. The 1996
fascia is virtually unaltered, although marketing logic would seem to suggest
that it is time for some change here. However, Saab is always reluctant to make
minor model-year changes just for the sake of offering something new to look at.
It shows no reluctance at all, however, when it comes to loading its cars with
top-class equipment as standard. All models in the 9000 range come with ABS,
twin airbags, dust and pollen-filtered ventilation, tinted windows with heat
absorbent glass, and many other features which make excellent sense and do not
rate simply as ``goodies''.
As somebody who once wrote for a motoring paper which had an anonymous car
thief as one of its other contributors, I know it is rash to make too many
claims for any manufacturer's security devices. But the Saab system, which is
standard on the Aero and Griffin, and a #400 option on other versions, seems to
be about as good as they come.
The main thrust of Saab's technical development at the moment is towards
second-generation turbocharging, not just as a source of enhanced power and
torque, but also as the best way - in conjunction with advanced engine
management systems and inlet manifold heating - towards reducing emissions.
The 2.3-litre light pressure turbo engine, peaking at a manageable 170bhp and
providing an instant ``lift'' when the throttle is opened, seems to be the best
choice in the 9000, since the two-litre version has a lot of weight to carry
around, and the full pressure jobs pour more power than I like through the
front wheels.
Prices vary from #20,495 to #23,895 according to equipment levels. The cars
using this power unit are lively and responsive when required, relaxed on
motorway runs, and they feel reassuringly Swedish-engineered.
Ross Finlay finds the Saab's roominess compensates for any ungainly lines

A PAYMENT of #6.1m from the National Lottery was being celebrated as a record
breaker by tens of thousands of sportsmen, women, and children in Scotland
yesterday.
The payment helped the Scottish Sports Council to make 30 awards to a wide
range of recipients.
Mr Graeme Simmers, the council's chairman, said: ``This is a wonderful
Christmas present for sport in Scotland.''
The awards were announced at a festive roadshow at Gyle shopping centre in
Edinburgh, attended by Mr Raymond Robertson, Scotland's Minister for Sport, and
sports stars including Yvonne Murray, Commonwealth 10,000m champion, world
cycling champion Graeme Obree, and former Scotland A rugby captain Kevin
McKenzie.
The biggest single award was #1.5m to help Tayside Regional Council towards the
#3.2m cost of developing the Maryfield sports complex at Dundee.
Councillor Charles Farquhar, convener of Dundee City Council's leisure and
recreation committee, said the complex would be Scotland's largest sports,
leisure, and physical education centre. It would benefit generations of
Dundonians and Taysiders.
Councillor John Wilson, Tayside Regional Council's convener of education, said
the complex was expected to be completed by August 1997. It would serve the
whole community and would be the only centre on this scale in Scotland.
The complex will contain two artificial grass outdoor pitches, an indoor games
hall, a gym, a health suite, and a seven-a-side grass football pitch.
Dalziel High School War Memorial Trust at Motherwell received #290,000 to help
provide floodlighting, a synthetic pitch, a running track, and an indoor
training area at the #647,000 Cleland Estate project.
Mr Brian Millar, trust chairman, said this announcement, coming on top of the
Chunghwa investment of #260m bringing 3300 jobs to Lanarkshire, had ``put a
happy face back on Motherwell''.
Yvonne Murray, who now lives in Motherwell, said: ``It is tremendous news.''
Edinburgh District Council received #924,100 towards the #4.3m cost of
refurbishing the pool at the Portobello Swim Centre in Edinburgh. The building,

<HEADLINE>Sales of shareholdings in privatised companies will help fund tax cuts Government nets #500m from sale of BP stake</HEADLINE>

THE Government yesterday set the ball rolling on a series of sales of its
residual shareholdings in privatised companies that will contribute some #1200m
to its coffers.
It has sold its remaining 1.8% holding in BP for just over #500m and other tiny
holdings in the likes of British Airports Authority, British Gas, and Mersey
Docks, which are expected to bring in roughly #700m, will follow in due source.
Economists noted that the stakes will help to fund the Budget tax cuts without
the Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke having to dig too deeply into
the contingency reserve. This will leave him with more ammunition for further
tax cuts in his final Budget before the General Election.
The Treasury pointed out that it had always said that further privatisations
would raise #3000m this year. The lion's share of this will come from the sale
of the second tranche of shares in the electricity generators National Power
and Powergen and the sale of Government loans to the utilities. The balance
will be made up from the disposal of small residual shareholdings.
The BP move finally marks the end of the Government's holding in the oil
company. The 101 million shares were sold to investment bank SBC Warburg for
onward sale to institutional investors. The transaction took place after a
competitive tender organised by another investment house, Rothschilds. About
half the shares went to UK and European institutions and the balance to the
United States.
The Government made a little over #500m from the deal. Market sources indicated
that SBC Warburg had placed the shares at 513p. BP shares eased 14p to 517p.
The sale of first tranche of BP shares held by the Government was made almost
two decades ago in 1977 - under a Labour Government - and further sales
followed at intervals over the ensuing 10 years.
Rothschild is also arranging the sale of the other small shareholdings. The
next largest is a near 3% holding in BAA, the airports group, which is worth
almost #150m. The sale of these shares can also be expected to have some
short-term impact on BAA's market price. But some of the holdings, such as
those in several water companies are so small that they will have no impact.
The sales may be convenient from the Government's view to fund its tax cuts but
it is also a sensible time to sell anyway given the strong performance of the
stock market and there is no point in these small holdings being retained.
Meanwhile, senior Treasury officials cast doubt on hopes of an early cut in
interest rates yesterday by rejecting predictions of a sharp slowdown in
economic growth.
City analysts are warning that growth could grind to a halt in the fourth
quarter of the year and early in 1996 as firms respond to weak demand by
trimming output in a bid to offload excessive stocks.
They predict that the Chancellor will opt to boost growth by cutting base rates
from 6.75% at his meeting next week with the Governor of the Bank of England.
But Colin Mowl, the Treasury's head of economic forecasting, said any
destocking was likely to be spread over the next 18 months. Gross domestic
product was likely to expand by 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 1995 and
strengthen in 1996, he said.
He added: ``I don't think we would expect that one would reduce interest rates
to hurry up the speed of the stock adjustment.''
Mr Mowl was giving evidence on the Budget to the House of Commons Treasury and
Civil Service select committee.
His comments were reinforced by Treasury chief economic adviser Alan Budd, who
was upbeat about growth prospects.
Asked by Quentin Davies, Tory MP for Stamford and Spalding, whether Mr Clarke's
optimistic 3% GDP growth forecast for next year could be achieved without lower
base rates, he replied: ``Yes, I do think it's possible.''
Mr Budd added that the pound's recent weakness and strong growth in money
supply were unlikely to prevent Government hitting its sub-2.5% inflation
target although strong money supply growth could be a threat if it persisted.

MORRISON Construction Group's dynamic approach to seeking out new business has
enabled it to buck the deep recession in civil engineering and house building.
The Edinburgh-based company doubled pre-tax profit to #3.18m at the half way
stage.
This was good news for investors who bought shares at 115p when Morrison was
floated on the Stock Exchange on October 6. The shares rose 2p to 123p
yesterday after Morrison met its pre-flotation forecast of interim profit in
excess of #3.06m.
Executive chairman Fraser Morrison attributed the company's success to its
strategy of seeking out new business without waiting for projects to come up
for tender.
``An increasing proportion of our work is self-generated or awarded on value
criteria rather than simply bidding the lowest price in open market tender,''
he said.
Morrison generates 60% of its work on this basis, often forming joint-ventures
with partners to attack problems. It aims to increase this proportion to 80% by
the end of the century.
``We see this as the key to the higher margins which we have secured in recent
years compared with the construction sector norm,'' Mr Morrison said.
Typical of these partnerships is a joint-venture with US engineering giant
Bechtel and North West Water to bid for the #45m Inverness and Fort William
water and sewerage project.
This will be a privately funded build, own and operate scheme under the
Government's private finance initiative (PFI). Morrison said the Government's
Budget announcement of an increase in PFI public works projects was encouraging
since the company was pursuing a wide range of PFI projects.
These include the #70m to #80m Leeds Supertram project. Morrison forms part of
a consortium that aims to bring trams back to the streets of the city.
The company made a profit in all its operating divisions during the first half,
despite a 3% fall in turnover to #98.1m.
Even the utilities and energy and the housebuilding divisions returned to the
black after losses in the first half of last year.
The key to success in housebuilding was Morrison's focus on grant-aided
projects in the lower sector of the market. Its houses typically sell for only
#45,000 to #50,000.
Edinburgh broker Bell Lawrie White is pencilling in full-year taxable profit of
#10.5m, up from #7.6m in 1994-95.
There is no interim dividend for shareholders who joined the company at
flotation, but it has promised a year-end payout.

YARROW Shipbuilders' economic fortunes have always depended on the cyclical
nature of naval orders. In a climate of defence spending cutbacks, up to 1000
of its core workforce may now become peripheral casualties of the end of the
Cold War. The fabled ``peace dividend'' for many will be the dole.
The yard, the last British-owned survivor of the species on Clydeside, has
always been a hostage to changes in UK defence policy and funding. Even as the
lead yard for the new generation of Type-23 frigates and the projected
Euro-frigate due to be ordered in six years' time, its immediate options are
limited.
The yet unannounced decision by a cash-strapped Defence Ministry to delay the
award of a #500m contract for the final three-ship batch of Type-23s until at
least February next year underlines the point. There is no longer a built-in
margin for slippage in bread-and-butter domestic deals.
The Royal Navy itself is down to 35 surface warships. It is a total likely to
decline in coming years, despite the fact that more than 92% of the country's
exports, almost all of its oil, gas, timber and key imports and almost half of
its food is seaborne.
The acquisition of Yarrow by GEC-Marine and the potential rival location of
Vickers Shipbuilding at Barrow can only deepen the gloom at Scotstoun. Instead
of facing diminished competition on the demise of Swan Hunter on the Tyne, the
Clyde yard now has to come to terms with the implications of a long-term
corporate strategy which is no longer in its own hands.
Vosper Thorneycroft is, on paper, the only remaining commercial rival. The
Southampton firm has already carved a niche in the international market for
fast patrol craft, the poor man's high-speed alternative to a blue-water navy.
Yarrow clawed back some lost ground by being first in the market for corvettes,
the compromise vessels now completed for Malaysia, and by its recent order for
offshore patrol ships for Brunei. Both orders represent something which is not
quite a frigate, yet more than an inshore patrol craft. Both are fillers on the
order book, but hardly lifesavers.
The gap between orders, final design, construction and delivery is a long one.
It is certainly too long for GEC-Marine to sustain a 3000-strong workforce on
full pay, and anything up to 1500 subcontractors at any given time.
Steelworkers, the metal-bashers who handle the first, crucial stage of any
warship construction, will be the primary victims.
Even if, as expected, the Defence Ministry awards the contract to the Clyde, it
will come too late to prevent large-scale lay-offs if not outright
redundancies. It would be next spring before steel plate began to arrive to
signal the laying down of the final trio of Duke-class Type-23s.
A cross-party Commons report drawn up jointly by the Defence and Trade and
Industry committees warned yesterday that cutbacks in spending on research and
development and support for the defence industry were coming close to
endangering the country's security and independence.
UK-wide, more than 400,000 workers are dependent directly on defence orders for
their livelihood. They represent about 7% of the country's entire workforce.
At the moment, Britain can produce just over 90% of the equipment needed by its
own armed forces. A decade from now, given the current rate of decline, the
Defence Ministry will have no choice but to go to an American-dominated market
for its hardware. The strategic framework is already creaking.
Yarrow has fought hard to maintain a place in that market, both pre and
post-GEC. Under its former chairman, Sir Bob Easton, its sales team scoured the
world for export opportunities. Some, like Pakistan, wanted Clyde-built
frigates. Unfortunately, the price was too high and Islamabad's credit rating
too low.
Undeterred, the yard sought business in the more fertile waters of the Middle
and Far East. They were aided by Iran's acquisition of three ex-Soviet
Kilo-class submarines among the Gulf states. Every Arab oil-producer in the
region began to think seriously about safeguarding the sea lanes for its black
gold. So far, however, none has signed a deal.
The disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea proved a better lure. Oil
is again the prize, although this time China, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and
the Philippines have all laid down markers for ownership and rattled cutlasses
at diplomatic level.
Malaysia has already bought two corvettes to underscore the seriousness of its
claim. More orders may follow as the region squares up for a showdown still
probably half a decade away, although the smart money remains on China in any
confrontation worthy of the name.
Like all British defence companies, Yarrow is constrained by the package it can
offer. Many of the weapons systems inherent to the operational effectiveness of
Royal Navy warships are forbidden fruit in most areas of potential conflict.
Yarrow is then relegated to being a hull-builder, albeit a superb one, with
good connections to the people who supply radar, guns and missiles. These, in
their turn, are limited by the dictates of current foreign policy and official
and technological secrets.
The yard is also fighting in a pool crowded with equally desperate commercial
sharks. Russia is cash-poor and desperate to sell off all but top-of-the-range
warships. German, Dutch and Danish yards, all suffering from the universal and
so far unsuccessful quest for Government peace dividends, are all offering
off-the-shelf ships at rock-bottom prices. Some are even Government-subsidised
on the quiet.
Britain's 1995-96 defence budget amounts to #21.72 billion. Operating,
equipping and supporting the Royal Navy comes to about 25% of that total.
Treasury pressure for economies will probably mean anything up to a 3% cut next
year. Staggering orders is the Defence Ministry's classic method of creative
book-keeping.
The real question for the Government is how much of its strategic defence
industry it is prepared to shed in the interest of short-term savings. The UK
could still - just - stand alone in a conflict. If it abdicates the ability to
build its own warships, aircraft and land weaponry, it will be losing not only
vital jobs, but also any claim to independent action in Europe. For Defence
Secretary Michael Portillo's benefit, that represents the choice between free
market and free will.

HIGHLANDS and Islands Enterprise has found a novel method of driving home the
message about the North of Scotland's advantages as a location for business and
industry.
Some 5000 cassette tapes are being distributed to drivers hiring cars from
Hertz at Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Inverness airports over the next three months.
The tapes carry a 30-minute programme about the area and include interviews
with businessmen and women, interspersed with music from artists such as
Capercaillie and Orkney composer Peter Maxwell Davis. The package includes a
reply-paid card for additional information.
Firms from across the HIE area are featured, including Judane Knitwear from
Shetland, Caithness freezer firm Norfrost and Loch Fyne Oysters from Argyll.
HIE's senior marketing manager, Stewart Miller, said: ``Inward investment is
increasingly competitive and it is vital to bring your message to the direct
attention of potential developers.''

THE man-management skills of the sporting supremos of this world I often find
puzzling.
Did it make Devon Malcolm a better bowler when he was rubbished by both the
England coach and the manager Ray Illingworth? Who picked the guy in the first
place?
How have the West Indies Cricket Board managed to antagonise Brian Lara, their
best player, to the extent that he will not tour with them?
What is Jim Telfer attempting to achieve by criticising publicly two of his
leading players? According to the director of rugby, Craig Chalmers and Kenny
Logan may have lost their hunger for the sport. Really? On what is this
astonishing assumption based?
``Both Craig and Kenny have distractions off the pitch,'' declared Mr Telfer in
a Sunday newspaper, ``and, because they are the kind of guys who are willing to
go away and play in testimonial matches, it could be they are not hungry any
more.''
Let's put the record straight. Craig Chalmers' main off-the-pitch distractions
are a wife and two children. Kenny Logan has a high-profile girlfriend. I
understand this is not forbidden, even by the Free Kirk these days.
Last month they both played in a testimonial match to mark the contribution to
the game of Ieuan Evans, the former Welsh captain. They received no fee for
doing so and both returned saying how much they had enjoyed themselves.
Also taking part were Scotland squad members Scott Hastings and Rob Wainwright,
who happens to be the current international captain. Among the latter's
distractions might be listed his family and his career as an Army doctor.
So why pick on Chalmers and Logan? Craig has probably just helped Melrose to
another league championship; if they are pipped on the post it will be by
Stirling County, Kenny's outfit. No lack of appetite in that department.
Yes, they both had an indifferent game against Western Samoa. In that they were
certainly not alone.
Among the guilty men I would also nominate the selectors, for picking the wrong
side - Eric Peters and Stewart Campbell should have been included - and whoever
dictated the tactics.
I bet Jim Telfer, if Scotland lose to Ireland in the opening Five Nations game,
that the same people to whom he is baring his soul will then be calling for his
head.
A director of rugby is not like any other manager or coach. Telfer has been
handed enormous responsiblities, far greater than anyone else in the history of
the game in Scotland. He is not just the Scotland team manager; his remit is to
develop the sport throughout the length and breadth of the land. Such a figure
has to rise above dishing out personal criticisms.
I like Jim Telfer. He is a deep-thinking man, honest as the day is long. His
record, which includes coaching Scotland to a Grand Slam, stands up to any
scrutiny. But he is not infallible. None of us are.
My worry is that he is surrounded by people who tell him what he wants to hear.
Another of the director's recent quotes was to the effect that the game might
not need heroes. That's just baloney, Jim.
You and I visited a township in South Africa where hundreds of kids mobbed
Gavin Hastings, some of them even put on their best clothes just to be near
him.
It is the special players, the Gavs, the Gary Armstrongs, the Barry Johns, who
attract youngsters to the game, who provide the goal for others to achieve -
why, I even recall the days when all good forwards wanted to play as well as
Jim Telfer.
Craig Chalmers is the most competitive member of the Scotland squad, Kenny
Logan one of the most exciting backs. But they need to have their confidence
boosted, not to be treated like naughty little boys. The days of the drill
sergeant approach are definitely numbered.
I know Jim Telfer does not like the fact that the pair write columns for
newspapers. Again, one has to point out that they are not alone in that, nor
are they prohibited from doing so by any contract.
If the director thinks he has problems with star players, maybe he should have
a word with Walter Smith at Ibrox. I do not think it is any coincidence that
Paul Gascoigne is flourishing under the wise handling of the Rangers' manager.
He can shout a bit too - but he does it in private.

Brussels
BRITAIN will stand outnumbered by 14 to one on the question of the national
veto in Europe when the Maastricht 11 negotiations begin next year. After
months of planning, the EU's Reflection Group of foreign ministers yesterday
published its final blueprint for the agenda to be placed before the
inter-governmental conference due to begin in Italy in spring.
It shows that Britain is the only member state opposed in principle to
weakening the national veto in areas including foreign policy and home affairs
and replacing it with majority voting. Britain also stands alone in opposing
more powers for the European Parliament.
The report will provide ammunition for Tory Euro-sceptics who have been lying
low since Mr John Major's re-election to the leadership. If the Tories stay in
power until the spring of 1997, when a General Election must be called, they
face running a campaign for a fifth term against the background of the
continuing struggle against the tide of European integration.
They will not be helped by Mr John Redwood's intention to campaign against the
single currency in the meantime, thus reopening the Euro-wounds which have
riven the party and which threatened Mr Major's premiership earlier this year.
Mr David Davis, European Minister, speaking in Brussels yesterday, saw this
difficulty coming when he urged people not to assume the ``British problem'' in
Europe could be overcome by the election of a Labour Government.
He told reporters: ``This presumes Tony Blair will win the election - and that
is not a presumption I would sign up for.''
The Labour-dominated, 217-strong socialist group in the European Parliament
backed the report.
British Conservative insistence that Europe is slowly coming round to Britain's
way of thinking appeared to be turned on its head by the Spanish president of
the Reflection Group, Mr Carlos Westendorp. He told reporters, in the context
of British resistance: ``We are condemned to success. We cannot fail.''
The report confirms that Britain has led a campaign of mutiny on the major
issues facing the EU as it strives to make the Maastricht treaty more workable
in the face of impending enlargement eastwards to bring in the former Communist
states.
It shows that co-decision powers with the European Parliament are being
resisted mainly in Britain.
On the question of qualified majority voting, which would weaken or remove the
national veto in some crucial areas, the report states: ``One of us opposes the
extension in principle.'' The report concluded that many of the EU's 15 members
believed greater efficiency could be enhanced by more majority voting in the
council. Some states went farther, arguing that it should become routine
procedure after enlargement.
The report added: ``Some of us believe that this should only be countenanced if
democratic legitimacy is improved by a re-weighting of votes to take account of
population.'' Mr Davis hinted that this was an early sign of the negotiation to
come.
However, the report also suggests obliquely that Britain could gain some
support from some members on specific issues when the subject of the veto is
discussed. The French, under President Chirac, have also shown signs of
opposition to the Strasbourg assembly having more power and to wholesale
qualified majority voting on certain issues such as defence.
Mr Davis recalled the Prime Minister's promise that Britain would oppose
``massive'' new powers for the European Parliament but he refused to say if
this meant the point was non-negotiable. ``We are not debating negotiations
now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Flat rate minimum wage appears to be too rigid</HEADLINE>

ON the face of it talk of a minimum wage even of just #4.50 sounds attractive
particularly when one considers that #7 an hour is not an usual amount to pay a
domestic cleaner in London.
However, given the varying skill levels entailed in different types of work and
the differences in the cost of living around the UK, a flat rate national
minimum wage appears to be too rigid.
Employers' organisations have been vocal in their opposition to a minimum wage
and this is not surprising given their attempts to beat off competition in
traditional markets from newly emerging low-cost markets, notably the Far East
and Latin America. Employers' costs clearly would rise if a national minimum
wage was imposed.
For a #4 national minimum wage, economic models suggest that the first round
national rise in employment costs (defined as gross earnings plus employer
national insurance contributions) would be #6400m per year. These costs would
be concentrated among employers with large numbers of low paid workers.
However, increasing wages will mean that more income tax and national insurance
contributions will be collected and the cost of in-work benefits will be
reduced.
In addition, there are those who think a minimum wage would provide some relief
for our burgeoning welfare budget. This is because the wages on offer to the
unemployed are now arguably so low that many have no financial incentive to
work at all.
In the latest edition of *New Economy, Paul Gregg and Jonathan Wadsworth of the
London School of Economics, point out that the average job taken by people
hitherto unemployed typically paid well under half (44%) of the gross weekly
wages observed in all other jobs.
One third of such jobs paid below a quarter of the median weekly wage (#56).
The low weekly wages on offer stem from the fact that hours on offer are
limited (a quarter below average) and because the hourly wages offered are low
(65% of the average).
Messrs Gregg and Wadsworth argue that currently available work, allied with the
current benefit system, all too often does not pay without the presence of a
working partner.
A minimum wage as part of a comprehensive package of tax and benefit reform is
seen as a valuable tool to improve work incentives, reduce the implicit subsidy
on low wage jobs and halt the rise in the benefit dependent workless family.
In the competitive trading environment, companies in all sectors are
increasingly focused on how better to serve customers. Those companies who
value their staff and place a high priority on good customer service tend to
pay staff above the minimum rate in the industry.
In retailing, one thinks of the likes of Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis. That
way they attract good people and maintain their goodwill. You get what you pay
for and just as we hear about the need to incentivise top executives, workers
lower down the chain also need encouragement of a financial nature, arguably
more so.
On balance, I think there is a case for a free market in wages, but with the
safeguards for workers of some sort of wages council. These were abolished by
the Government in 1993, leaving Britain as the only European Union country
without any formal or informal system of minimum wages.
The need for some sort of wage protection is all the more vital to prevent
exploitation, given the fragmentation of the labour market and growth in
flexible and part-time working.

<TEXT>
WESSEX Water blew its own trumpet yesterday by highlighting its ability to
maintain supplies without restrictions through the summer.
Chairman Nicholas Hood said some of the obvious improvements to Wessex's
customers had been ignored by critics, who tended to lump all water companies
together.
``There is a difference between water companies and Wessex will continue to act
in ways which will change these perceptions,'' he said.
If the company found itself having to impose restrictions because of a failure
of its infrastructure, it would compensate them for what it believed to be a
sub-standard service.
The group also revealed a jump in half year pre-tax profit to #68.4m in the six

Immediacy of emotion is essential in the story of an angel's fall from grace.
Sara Villiers views his grounds for complaint
ALMOST a month ago a flock of culture vultures from around Glasgow gathered in
the rehearsal room of the 7:84 Theatre Company to watch a work-in-progress
performance of The War in Heaven, an elegiac play by Sam Shephard and Joseph
Chaikin. A trifle rusty around the edges, with a few fluffed lines and some
mis-timed movement, the work yet emanated a beauty and power which left the
small aduience quite dumbstruck.
A few weeks on, at another sneak preview, the cast's increased conviction of
performance had further heightened the lyricism of the piece. The production,
which opens a 10-day run at the Tramway, Glasgow, tomorrow night is almost
certainly going to be another hit for Outreach, 7:84's ambitious community
theatre programme, with the play an inspired choice by the company's Outreach
worker, director John Heraghty.
The piece will be the first production to fully combine the two wings of 7:84,
Artistic and Outreach, representing the fruition of an evolution which has seen
increasingly professional production values applied to Outreach projects,
resulting in work of the calibre of New Frontiers, Glasgow Generations and Act
Your Age.
While previous Outreach projects have emerged from extensive workshopping as
devised plays, Heraghty was interested in using a scripted piece with a small
group of performers.
He had been attracted to The War in Heaven for some time. The play was written
for radio in 1984 and performed by Chaikin, the American actor and director. It
is an intensely personal piece which was co-written with Shephard after Chaikin
had suffered a stroke and lost the use of the right side of his body and
virtually all speech.
He had previously been working on another play with Shephard and an angelic
character from that took on a life of its own, coming to represent Chaikin's
feelings of alienation and his struggle with his loss of language.
Heraghty, who was familiar with previous Chaikin and Shephard collaborations,
thought that the play would be perfect for this Outreach development. ``I felt
it would be a good piece to move on     to, a scripted piece but one which gave
people a lot of room to put their own thoughts across.''
The poetic, symbolic emphasis of the play, which sketches a fragmented story of
an angel's fall to earth and the subsequent anguished struggle to return to
heaven, offers the cast a chance of          a vigorous and personal
interpretation.
``We could expose things     we could relate to rather than be confronted with
a script with strictly delineated characters,'' says Heraghty. ``Community
theatre tends to put people's own stories across and the script here allows
that. There is a real immediacy of emotion.''
Although orginally performed as a monologue by Chaikin, Heraghty's adaptation
for the stage splits the voice of the Angel and his three characters, played by
Tommy Cannon, Sheila Docherty and Pauline Sweeney.
``Originally we intended to have lots of performers doing it, but the more work
you do on this play the sparser it seems. It could be done in a choral way, but
it seemed more eloquent to limit the voices.''
His original concern that the lyricism of the piece might prove obtuse, was
unfounded. ``It was a little bit confusing at first but once you read it
properly it becomes very clear,'' says Sheila Docherty.
Tommy Cannon, who is blind, had to get the script translated into Braille.
``The people who were doing that were telling me that there were some parts on
the left-hand side and some on the right. At first I could make little of that,
but I understand it quite clearly now. When I learned why the piece was written
I felt a strong conviction about doing it.''
Pauline Sweeney was immediately attracted to the play. ``I loved that fact that
there's a lot of social comment in it. We did some very intensive work on the
script and    for me it is about someone who's had a lot of power and friends
and held a position of authority who has, partly through their own fault,
lost all that and found him-self alone.
``Then the character finds hope for change because they can recognise their own
part in their downfall.''
Although Sweeney's character radiates a serenity and optimism, Docherty's is
contrastingly pained by the dilemma. ``It is someone who has lost power and
feels that the longer they are here they are weakened, and they are just
desperate to get back.''
One of the strongest sections of the piece is Docherty's frustrated
panic-flecked plea: ``Every minute I am here, something's changing in me/
something's diminishing in me. My power slips away.''
That anger is exacerbated with the pounding of a drum - the cast have worked
closely with musician David Young, whose score alternates between celestial
melancholy and thunderous roars.
``The drum coming in on that passage really helps me to fire up my delivery,''
notes Docherty.
Cannon's angel views the situation more mischievously. ``My character is
someone who has always thought of himself as a failure but through this
entrapment he finds out a lot about himself, he is someone who was previously
afraid of rebellion, but now learns to laugh at authority.
``I could really identify with this position because of the degree of
institutionalism in my young life, in my education. My angel has always been
told what to do and has obeyed, but now he can question it all. In some ways
it's a liberating experience.''
The cast, who have all previous worked with Heraghty in 7:84 on diverse
Outreach projects have enjoyed the collaborative nature of this production.
They have been involved in consultations with Young, lighting designer Ian
Scott, costumier Anna Lau, and designer Mark Leese, who has come up with a
simple elegantly constructed set which suggests of a celestial waiting room.
``No-one's been too precious about their work. Everyone's been more generous
with each other, perhaps because the amount of people working on this project
is smaller than usual,'' says Leese.
``We looked at any ideas anyone expressed and took them seriously. The concept
of the waiting room as an island, surrounded by earth, is a fairly obvious one.
But it works because the text is very thick, and if we had been too heavy with
the visual ideas they would have been muffled.''
Heraghty concurs with the principle, applauding the strength of the script.
``We have been asking a lot from the performers and I think that that is right.
We'd be letting them down if we didn't do that. The writing is so sturdy that
they can take their performances quite far. We've tried to realise the beauty
of the piece but it's not wishy-washy - it's got a hard edge.''
n.The War in Heaven, tomorrow until December 16. Free Tramway/Herald debate,
What is Community Theatre? precedes the performance on Thursday, December 14 at
6pm.

SCRATCHCARDS are at the ``soft end'' of gambling and are less addictive than
fruit machines, the National Lottery regulator said yesterday.
Mr Peter Davis, the director general of the Office of the National Lottery,
told representatives of the gaming machine industry in Birmingham that
scratchcards would remain exempt from the advertising restrictions on other
forms of gambling.
He told delegates, who had called for the restrictions to be removed, that the
lottery was significantly different from attractions like fruit machines
because its purpose was to raise money for good causes.
``National Lottery scratchcards are bought under controlled, open, and very
sociable conditions,'' Mr Davis said. ``The atmosphere is open, mundane, and
domestic. There isn't a hint of skill. Any pressure to purchase is very mild.''
He compared the experience of buying a scratchcard to the ``sensory treats
delivered by the lights and noise of an arcade''.
``Fruit machines are played in an environment which is usually inviting, often
large and noisy, mostly pubs or arcades,'' Mr Davis said. ``There is often a
strong, highly charged atmosphere, designed to stimulate and excite. It's a
very tactile experience.''
Other gambling organisations, like Littlewoods Pools, have claimed the
lottery's exemption from normal regulation gives it an unfair advantage.

THE stampede of workers leaving Yarrow's at the end of a working day appeared
no less subdued last night despite the anger clearly etched on their faces.
They had just been told by managing director Murray Easton that it was now
inevitable that 1000 jobs would be shed next month.
Of those, 300 are put down to the delay by the MoD in awarding a new contract
for up to three Type 23 frigates.
``We are sick,'' was the reply shouted by one worker when asked for his
reaction.
Many of the workers appeared numbed as they left the yard and refused to
comment on the blow, delivered on the day they expected to hear that the
contract had been clinched - beating off fierce competition from Vosper
Thorneycroft in Southampton.
Those who did comment appeared unanimous in their view that the contract's
delay was ``deeply demoralising''.
Mr Robert Gibb, 60, a sheet metal worker from Dumbarton, said: ``It is very
sad. The Government is to blame. There is a holdback for some reason or other.''
Apprentice fabricator Derek McAuley, 19, said most of the workers had appeared
``very depressed''.
Mr John Dolan, GMB convener at the yard, said: ``The workers are saddened,
shocked, and annoyed at what has happened.''
Mr Dolan, 46, who has been a plater at the yard for 13 years, said he believed
it was ``too early'' to apportion blame for the redundancies.
He added: ``We will be discussing with the company whether pressure can be
applied to bring the frigate order forward.''
Mr James Potter, a temporary plumber at the yard, said the temporary workers
had half expected to be paid off.
However, he added: ``We didn't all expect to be let down the way we were after
management confirmed an order for three patrol vessels for Brunei.''
One white-collar worker, who declined to be named, questioned whether the delay
in announcing the order was political, saying: `` I believe this is about
whether the Government wants to spend #500m on three new frigates.''
While he conceded the mood among workers was one of anger and disappointment,
he said most were not surprised.
``Everyone knew the vessels in the yard were going to be finished off within a
few months of one another,'' he said. ``That was always going to severely hit
the fitting-out trades.''
All but one of three Type 23 frigates and two Malaysian corvettes in the yard
are due to be completed by the middle of next year.
The Brunei order, announced last week and worth an estimated #400m, is a
design-and-build contract for three patrol vessels and is likely to remain on
the drawing board for up to a year.

ALMOST 1000 workers at Yarrow shipbuilders on the Clyde - a third of the
workforce - are almost certain to be made redundant next month.
The gloomy forecast follows a dearth of orders and a decision by the
Government
to delay by up to three months the announcement of a contract for three Navy
vessels.
The move, which will follow 230 redundancies at the Glasgow yard this Friday,
will bring the total number of job losses to more than 1200 in the next few
weeks.
Union officials had been anticipating ``several hundred'' redundancies next
month because of a shortage of work, but the company revealed yesterday that
the number would be between 650 and 700 and said a further 280 jobs would be
axed as a direct result of the delay in announcing the order for the final
batch of Type 23 frigates.
The news will have come as a bitter blow to the Scotstoun yard and its 3150
workers - who had been hoping to learn that the Type 23 bid had been
successful
- although management had warned in August that staff would have to be laid
off, even if it won the contract, because of gaps in its order book.
The order for up to three Type 23 frigates, worth up to #500m, is believed to
be crucial for the yard's long-term future.
Yarrow, which is still confident of securing the contract, had been expecting
an announcement by the Government early this month, but said the Ministry of
Defence had now indicated that no decision would be taken until the end of
February.
The Ministry has been considering bids to build the Type 23s from Yarrow and
rival shipbuilders Vosper Thorneycroft of Southampton since mid-August.
Yarrow, which yesterday described the situation as a ``short-term crisis'' and
said its long-term future was secure, is deeply concerned that the matter is
to
drag on and will continue to lobby Government Ministers on the impact of a
delayed decision on jobs for the yard and Clydeside.
Opposition MPs yesterday reacted angrily to the development, with Labour
accusing the Ministry of Defence of ``bungling incompetence'' and the SNP
claiming that the ``disgraceful'' treatment of Yarrow highlighted severe
limitations in Scottish Office lobbying of London-based Government departments.
The yard said yesterday that it had done everything in its power to reduce the
number of redundancies, but admitted that the scheduled completion of all but
one of three Type 23 frigates and two Malaysian frigates next year meant it
had
run out of work for many employees.
Mr Murray Easton, managing director, said: ``We had
already been anticipating major redundancies at the beginning of the year and
we have taken account of that in our planning. That is because a number of
contracts we have at the shipyard will be complete by the middle of 1996.
``If we had been awarded the Type 23 contract by the MoD then we would have
started steel cutting immediately, and I mean literally immediately, in order
to maximise the savings and to reduce the number of redundancies.
``We are extremely disappointed about the delay quite obviously, because any
impact there is on employees of the company is one we try to avoid and
minimise. Regretful is not a word that satisfies the way we feel.
``In the short-term, the situation is very negative, but the long-term future
of the yard is secure as demonstrated by the announcement last week of the
excellent news from Brunei.''
Mr Easton said Yarrow was still confident of winning the contract, adding that
it had previously delivered six Type 23 frigates to the satisfaction of the
Ministry and was building another three.
Mr Stewart Crawford, the yard's union convener, said yesterday that union
officials were shocked by the news.
``We had started the day hoping that Mr Easton was going to come to us and say
you've won the Type 23 order and describe a healthy situation. Instead, he
told
us that the order has been delayed and the result was that the number of jobs
losses would be up to 1000.
``It is a blow to us, coming at this stage with the redundancies on Friday,
and
it brings a further element of insecurity into the place which we hadn't
foreseen this side of the new year.''
He added that he could not fault management because ``they have done all they
can to reduce the number of redundancies.''
Labour's armed forces spokesman, Dr John Reid, said last night: ``Every month
there is another indication of waste or incompetence from the MoD - this time
it's incompetence.
``The warship market is now cut-throat in its competition. It is insecure
enough without the bungling incompetence of the MoD, especially in the run-up
to Christmas. They make it impossible for companies, managers, or ordinary
workers to plan ahead.''
SNP defence spokesman Colin Campbell said: ``This is disgraceful treatment of
Yarrow by the Govermment and shows up the severe limitations of Scottish
Office
lobbying of London-based departments. It seems to be a case of the Treasury
leading the decisions, rather than defence priorities.''

FOR institutions that are apparently dying on their feet marriage and the
Church still manage to draw an inordinate amount of flak from their opponents.
Perhaps it is they who really believe in (and fear) resurrection. Professor
Steve Bruce now joins the fray with his fanciful perspective of history
(December 1).
If the Church of the Middle Ages tried to control the price of bread perhaps
this was connected to the sin of usury. Likewise the control of sex was perhaps
connected with the power of lust, not the lust for power. For if the Church has
shown an inordinate interest in sex, so too has mankind.
His gossamer-thin argument that marriage was about land and the inheritance
thereof, a buttress against the usurper, hence its patronage by the rich and
powerful, was an entertaining flight of the imagination. But a nodding
acquaintanceship with the history of Richard III and Henry VII and VIII puts
such bosh in its true perspective.
The institution of marriage is much older than the Church. When the curtain
rises on history, marriage is an established fact in Babylon, Egypt, Israel,
Greece, and Rome.
Why was it instituted in the first place? The failure of the more recent ``free
love'' experiment in post-revolutionary Russia may hold the answer.
When ``inheritance ceased to sit at the core of our economy and polity'' it was
more because of the dispossessed. It was the dissolution of the monasteries and
the enclosure of common land that made the urban community.
The peasantry, to avoid penury and starvation, were forced in droves off their
land to seek corporal and corporate salvation in parish charity or the hellish
factories of capitalism's New Jerusalem.
These crimes against humanity happened when the Church was at a low ebb, not
when it was in the driving seat.
Finally it may be true that ``committed church-going Catholics'' practise
artificial contraception but, after denigrating the Church for its omnipresence
in matters sexual, is his sociological interference in the bedrooms of others
any less reprehensible?
Tom McKay,
29 Manitoba Crescent,
East Kilbride.
IT is Steve Bruce's contention that the falling Catholic birth-rate is evidence
that committed church-going Catholics do not follow the church's teaching on
contraception (December 1).
The Catholic Church advocates responsible parenthood and recommends a method of
natural family planning which is at least as effective as any method of
artificial contraception when used by motivated couples.
I would argue that church-going Catholics by and large have that commitment.

ONCE again it has been my misfortune to fly from Amsterdam to Glasgow on an Air
UK flight. Yet again Air UK were between one and one-and-a-half hours delayed
at both ends.
The reason for this letter is not only to try to discover why Air UK always
have delays (always blamed on something else rather than their own
inefficiency) but also to find out why Air UK hold the monopoly into Scottish
airports.
One has to book via Air UK when flying from the Netherlands to Glasgow,
Edinburgh, or Aberdeen and one must pay astronomical fares because they are the
only carrier.
For example, a weekend return between Amsterdam and Glasgow costs us #252
whereas a weekend return between Amsterdam and London can be purchased for as
little as #99, the latter being run by four or five different carriers. We can
understand a slightly higher price but certainly not a #153 price difference.
Have British Airways abandoned us (Scottish) expatriates to a carrier which has
liaisons with the Dutch national carrier KLM?
With Air UK in the past years we have witnessed consistent delays, flights
being lumped together (fly to Glasgow and end up in Edinburgh only to find your
own way back to Glasgow) and flights being cancelled at the last moment.
Is it not about time that we had some competition on these routes which might
lead to a bit more efficiency on the part of Air UK and also to cheaper fares?

RANDOM acts of violence against innocent bystanders, who just happen to be in
the wrong place at the wrong time, appear to be a regrettable part of modern
life and the attack on the playwright Peter McDougall on Saturday, November 25,
was a case in point.
Given the high degree of public anxiety about the problem, it is most important
that stories such as the McDougall assault are covered in a responsible way and
not sensationalised by the media.
Mr McDougall's assault was given front-page prominence in The Herald,
presumably because he is a well-known personality. I am not trying to play down
the seriousness of the attack, but would a similar assault on an ``ordinary''
person have received such coverage? I think not.
In addition, Mr McDougall was given the considerable luxury of airing his
thoughts in an article which took up half a page in The Herald on December 1 -
a considerable amount of space. Does the ``ordinary'' assault victim have the
same luxury? Again, I think not.
The title, Dawn of new barbarism, set the tone of the article. Mr McDougall
used highly emotive language and made sweeping generalisations. To suggest that
a whole generation is completely amoral and has totally rejected ``our'' moral
standards is wildly inaccurate and very unfair.
He also appears to yearn for a return to some mythical golden age when there
was a code of conduct among thugs: when they fought among themselves and did
not attack ``civilians''.
If, as Peter McDougall suggests, drink plays a big part in the committing of
violent acts, I fail to see how a ``traditional thug'', out of his mind on
drink, could distinguish between a legitimate target and a civilian.
How common is it for middle-aged men like Peter McDougall to be the victim of a
random assault? How common is it for 86-year-old ladies to be attacked?
Statistics would suggest that it is not that common and that most victims are
young men.
Yet it is the attack on the middle-aged playwright and the poor old lady which
is given prominence in newspapers and TV, often for purely cynical, commercial
reasons. These stories sell newspapers and increase ratings.
Every act of violence is to be abhorred and I extend my sympathy to Peter
McDougall for what must have been a terrifying attack. I am an admirer of his
work and he is obviously a man in touch with the culture of the streets.
However, because of the considerable impact that an article so prominently
featured in a national newspaper would have, it might have been better to have
reflected longer before committing his thoughts to print.

THEY'VE met, they've talked. Laurie Booth - one of the most resiliently
experimental choreographers working in Britain - has gone through a few
movement patterns, highlighting various rhythms as well as visual elements.
Alasdair Nicolson - a composer with a real feel for theatre in music, and vice
versa - has responded to the dance and the discussion by sending Booth a taped
score. Now comes the payoff in this game of artistic consequences - otherwise
known as Glasgow Commissions.
Friday night sees the first performance of the first commission: The Last
Meeting, when Nicolson's score is played live by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra
and Booth dances the solo that has evolved for the occasion. Neither of them
can say, at this point, what the end result is likely to be - that might emerge
during one of the two rehearsals scheduled for later this week.
What does seem certain is that the piece will not be exactly the same on either
night of performance. The difference in venues - the City Hall in Glasgow, the
Queen's Hall in Edinburgh - will, for instance, affect the stage picture that
Nicolson has in mind. He has deliberately changed the usual seating
arrangements of the orchestra, splitting the players into groups and using
these to ``frame'' the dance space rather like the on-stage chorus in Greek
drama.
The starting point for the whole piece does, in fact, lie in Greek mythology -
the legend of Orpheus and Eurydice - but Nicolson is quick to point out that
The Last Meeting is in no way a narrative retelling of the final part of that
story. His interests tend more towards the exploration of distance, separation,
endings. Hence the physical statement of the divided orchestra.
This dividing and rearranging also reflects his wish to give the audience
something far removed from the concert protocols of the nineteenth century. ``I
want to bring about this `theatre-in-a-concert-situation' where lighting is
important and the look of the thing has a dramatic visual impact.''
Into this arena - and bearing ideas of his own - comes dancemaker Laurie Booth
whom Nicholson describes, with real enthusiasm, as having a kind of electricity
about him, a quality that realy captures and holds an audience's attention.
This is particularly important given the context.
``Orchestras generate their own movement,'' says Nicolson. ``Niggly, small
movements - even when they're not playing. And you need someone like Laurie,
who is quite a mesmerising performer, to hold the focus against that. Otherwise
it just breaks up, the audience is distracted, they lose sight of what you're
trying to communicate through the structure of the music as well as the dance.''
Booth, meanwhile, has been working on his own expression of the themes. His
work - whether with other dancers, or with artists like sculptor Anish Kapoor -
has regularly concerned itself with images of perspective. With how movement
can evoke the relationships we have with time, space, other people ..... but
also, and most poignantly, with out own inner selves. His hallmarks are a
fiercely gentle strength - he often draws on the regime of capoeira, a
Brazilian form of martial arts discipline - and ``invisible'' improvisation.
``Invisible'' because there's never any obvious indication on stage that he's
dancing as the mood takes him - certainly none of the hesitation or trial and
error commonly associated with spur-of-the-moment stuff.
``Actually I don't think of it as `improvisation' when it's a solo,'' says
Booth himself. ``It's more about me working with current choreographic concerns
that are in my mind anyway, sifting through them, bringing them into focus -
like you choosing words for a sentence.''
What amuses him, however, is the way in which he has started working more and
more with actual music. ``I seem to be going backward,'' he says laughing.
``Usually people start out making dance to pieces of music, then venture into
freer forms of sound, no sound at all, text, whatever. Well, I started out with
all that and now I seem to be moving towards melodic forms. I think it's the
discipline of trying to understand specific melodic forms that intriques me.
Seeing what the structures are, how I can play about with them, like in Tango
Variations last year.''
Tango Variations was, as it happens, one of the performances that made Nicolson
fix on Booth as his choice of fellow-artist.
When they subsequently met in Booth's studio, to discuss the new commission, it
was a case of quickly establishing a vocabulary of rhythms and sounds that both
could use, independently, as a springboard for developments.
``Alasdair wanted to know what kind of rhythm patterns I was likely to use,
what kind of sounds I might make,'' recalls Booth. ``It was a case, really, of
me saying `Well, if I use a stick I can do this, this or this with it' and us
agreeing on a set of likely rhythms, possible sounds.''
How that initial agreement has evolved - separately, as seems thoroughly
appropriate given the themes of the piece - can be seen when The Last Meeting
premieres this week.

IMAGINE rich, dark chocolate poured from an old-fashioned pewter coffee pot.
Imagine leather burnished with a subtle metallic gleam. Or satin, oiled so that
it assumes a finish which could almost pass for the binding on a fine
antiquarian book. Velvet which shimmers gently when it catches the light. Fur,
quite faux, yet sumptuously reminiscent of chinchilla or Persian lamb.
Such are the unexpected colour combinations and unusual textures which
characterise some of contemporary fashion's most beguiling clothes for women.
And they distinguish the current work of American designers Donna Karan and
Ralph Lauren. Each could be labelled a romantic modernist. For they soften the
stark austerity of minimalism with a lyrical quality.
Their realistic, refined clothes bridge that massive credibility gap in fashion
between the alienating runway excesses presented by so many designers (fixated
with youth, skinniness, and a very shallow idea of sexiness) and the real
consumer of designer fashion - a woman who is invariably neither particularly
young nor desperately thin.
Simple clothes of subtle distinction suit this woman very well. But simple
clothes rarely make fascinating runway presentations. No fireworks, and little
excitement. To the wearer, however, their qualities are self-evident;
wonderfully, they are out of the ordinary, yet neither weird nor wacky.
The unlikely juxtaposition of chocolate satin with pewter leather could be worn
just as readily by a 65-year-old as any 25-year-old. And just as happily next
winter (or the one thereafter) as this. Unfortunately, such distinction carries
a hefty price tag. But, as with all great investments, you are at least
guaranteed a high rate of interest.

BRITAIN'S defiance in the run-up to the Maastricht II summit next year can be
interpreted in two ways. Either it is a brave, if singular, campaign of
patriotic resistance to a dominating and bureaucratic superstate, or it is a
scream from the bunker of a stricken government trailing Labour by a record
margin which gets daily wider. Take your choice. It is not difficult. Europe
divides the Tories more than any issue since the Second World War. If they lose
the election they could split formally into the two parties they really are at
present: the mainstream centre-right Tory Christian Democrats in the European
tradition, and the far-right Little Englander nationalists. The Conservatives
have much to play for in getting their act together as the Maastricht
super-summit approaches.
Just how critical this occasion will be depends on your source of information
these days. If you listen to British diplomats, earnestly bending ears around
Brussels, this is no more than a routine 10,000-mile service for a treaty which
was disfigured at birth. No argument about its failings: the need to put them
right was recognised when a review was built into Maastricht I. The deadline
for doing so was deemed to be next year. This is not, therefore, just another
Euro-adventure being foisted on the unwilling by plotting federalists in
Brussels. John Major signed up for it like everyone else. And it is true that
the EU on this occasion is not seeking vast new competences. Rather the
opposite, in fact. What this review seeks to do is simply to make the present
treaty work. In Brussels there is talk of the existence of a commission
document in which some bureaucrat has calculated that if there is no more
majority voting in a European Union of 25 or 30 member states, the difficulty
in reaching a decision by unanimity will be increased by a factor of 40,000.
Even if that is a ridiculous exaggeration the fact remains that the days of the
unanimity rule must be numbered. Europe simply cannot function - ever - in
total and absolute unanimity on everything. The idea is preposterous.
In their hearts British Ministers know this. But a show must be put up to
demonstrate to recividist Europhobes on the back benches - and gullible
electors - that John Bull lives. Like John Major's opt-out from the social
chapter, this owes much more to style than substance. Those running the
European Union are not daft: they are not about to let Britain drift off as
just another irrelevant, crumbling nation state on its own. They want Britain
genuinely at the heart of the Europe of the 21st century - potentially the
world's pre-eminent superpower - which is why the Maastricht II meeting will
last beyond the next election if it suffers from a British blocking campaign.
This assumes, of course, that the Tories will in the meantime be replaced by a
Euro-friendly Labour government. But that's another story.

IT IS no wonder that car dependence is high when large employers such as the
Royal Bank, Bank of Scotland, and even Lothian region move large numbers of
Edinburgh staff to the Gyle and Chesser House respectively. Many staff were
forced to buy a car, or give up their job, and the impact on custom for the
likes of ScotRail was measurable.
True, some determined souls could still manage without a car, but this would be
at immense cost in time, which has been shown to be the key determining factor
in choice of travel.
Invest in public transport? I doubt that the provision of swish new buses and
trains will have more than a marginal effect when the total journey time - door
to door - is never going to match that of a car which can be driven into an
attached car-park, from a domestic driveway.
The new unitary authorities should look carefully at the means of making the
catching and disembarking from public transport suitably provided for, to make
it safe, quick and convenient to the likes of Scotstoun Leisure Centre -
temptingly visible from the train and the cyclepath which runs along its
eastern flank without any access provision.

I AM not sure if I am one of the ministers of the Church of Scotland who should
feel chastened by Stewart Lamont's strictures on colleagues who refuse to marry
couples who cohabit or who only agree to perform the wedding if certain
conditions are met (December 2).
The charge of inquisition doesn't stick: I don't see it as my business to pry
into whether a couple sleep with one another or live together.
If a couple who cohabit wish to be married in church because they have come to
see that marriage is the best way and wish God's blessing on the life they
share, then, of course, I am glad to affirm them in their decision.
However, a problem arises when a couple who seek Christian marriage talk of a
wedding in a year or 18 months' time while at the same time indicating that
they will continue to live together until the big day.
Some of us feel that to acquiesce to such a situation is to compromise the
integrity of both the Church and the couple.
Of the Church, because at a time when the boundaries between right and wrong,
particularly in the realm of sexual morality, have been moved, if not removed
altogether, the Church should not add to the uncertainty and confusion by
sending out ambivalent signals which imply that it is one and the same whether
a couple cohabit or live apart before the wedding.
Of the couple, because their intention to cohabit over a long period of time up
until the wedding suggests a less than compelling desire to embrace the ethic
which Christian marriage represents. One is reminded of St Augustine's prayer:
``Give me chastity and continence, but do not give it yet!''
Stewart Lamont may feel that we should allow couples, in the circumstances I
have described, to use the church.
Others of us, while willing to live with many of the ambiguities which surround
weddings in church, feel, after much heart-searching, that there is a ``fudge''
which so compromises the integrity of the couple, of the Christian
understanding of marriage, and of the Church, and that we have no alternative
but to decline the request.
That gives us no joy. The price we pay in terms of misunderstanding and
misrepresentation is sometimes high.

THIS weekend, the first of the Glasgow Commissions will be unveiled. A
collaborative project between the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and Glasgow City
Council's department of performing arts and venues, the Glasgow Commissions
will bring four of Scotland's leading composers together with front-rank
artists in other disciplines in a conscious attempt to extend the boundaries of
the combined art forms.
Over the next two years, the #50,000 project will see new works produced by
Icelandic-born Haflidi Hallgrimsson and painter Craigie Aitchison, Sally
Beamish with writer Janice Galloway, and James MacMillan with sculptor Sue Jane
Taylor. The series is launched on Friday with The Last Meeting, a collaboration
between composer Alasdair Nicolson and choreographer Laurie Booth.
The idea of combining art forms is not a new one, says Roy McEwan, managing
director of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. ``It started before my time, with
Glasgow very keen on exploring the concept of inter-relationship between
different artistic disciplines.''
Initially however, says McEwan, the project was intended to feature only solo
instruments from the orchestra. The expansion of the venture to include the
entire Scottish Chamber Orchestra in each of the commissions not only shifts
the goalposts, but introduces an entirely new ball game.
The point is, says McEwan, that each of the artists will be working within very
particular constraints. The first commission, featuring a composer and a
choreographer, is a case in point. ``Dance and music come together all the time
in the theatre,'' he said. ``But Alasdair Nicolson and Laurie Booth have been
asked specifically to come up with a work for dancer and orchestra rather than
a theatrical event. That is the constraint: it has to be with a full orchestra
on a concert platform, and not in a theatre.''
The first commission, and the third - with Sally Beamish and writer Janice
Galloway - at least combine art forms which marry relatively easily, said
McEwan. ``The interesting problems come in the others,'' he said, where there
will be two distinct pieces of work emerging: music and a painting, music and a
sculpture.
``How we present a concert hall audience with a visual concept and music, how
we integrate the separate art forms, is the problem and the challenge. These
are all experiments; some will work better than others. Each is a trial.''
However, as Roy McEwan pointed out, the SCO is not exactly moving into virgin
territory. Over the years, the orchestra's prolific development programme has
drawn many art forms together, mostly behind the scenes, in educational
projects. Music has been combined with movement, with film, with lighting, and
even with portraits in a gallery. It is this sort of work, in fact, as much as
the performing qualities of the orchestra, that has secured the SCO's
international reputation and won it big awards and vast sums of money.
What is absolutely new in the Glasgow Commissions is that the entire concept is
broadened to include the full orchestra, and that it will be brought on to the
concert platform in the regular winter series of orchestral concerts: project
work comes out of the closet and into the limelight.

DR DAVID Delvin gives advice to a salesman who had a ``one-night stand'' with a
young lady he met in the West Highlands. His comments are blinkered and out of
touch with reality.
He states that the chances of contracting HIV in this area of Scotland would be
very low. You can never be completely sure that someone you hardly know has
never indulged in unsafe practices or had unprotected sex with someone who has.
The way in which he covers this subject is to wax lyrically about how ``safe''
straight sex is. Such views are among the reasons why the risk of HIV is
becoming more prominent in all aspects of life and sexuality.
He seems to add a comment about the use of condoms as an afterthought. Surely
he should not only stress the use of them but also their proper use as they are
not infallible. Dr Delvin also quotes figures for the number of known women
with HIV in Scotland but failed to stress that this was the known number and
not the actual number.
In the same issue Alan MacDermid writes about the number of deaths from Aids in
Scotland. On World Aids Day, the lights in Edinburgh's public buildings were
turned off for 10 minutes and 10 seconds this year whereas the time was six
minutes for the previous year.
This rapid rise will be curbed when people are educated about and, more
importantly, practise safer sex whether they deem a geographical area to be
``safe'' or not.

WHEN the great steeplechaser Red Rum was found lying on his stable floor it was
clear to everyone that his life was drawing to an end and that its continuation
would cause enormous suffering and indignity to the great animal.
He was therefore put to sleep with a humane killer.
The British public found this decision both brave and compassionate and indeed
humane killers are used every day by my veterinary colleagues.
The major difference between a human being and other animals is our
intelligence which allows us free will to make our own decisions. Why is it
that we are allowed to make these decisions for animals and yet we are
forbidden to make them for ourselves?

IT is unlikely that Jasmine Sorabjee and Abiodun Igbindu will ever meet. For
one thing Mr Igbindu is a full-grown man and a Nigerian while Jasmine is but
three years old and British born.
However, within the past week both have been the victims of deportation orders
which beggar belief in any civilised society. In addition they have been the
targets of shameful Tory dirty-tricks campaigns involving ``background
briefings'' from those who scuttle around that party's darker corriders.
To take Jasmine's case first - this little girl was given a choice, at least of
sorts. She could have stayed in this country if she had been placed into care
with the possibility of never seeing her mother again. Although her mother has
a British passport and though she had married a British man the immigration
service took the view that this had been a marriage of convenience and that Mrs
Sorabjee had to go.
This might seem a remarkable conclusion to reach about a marriage which
produced a child but it is possible that the Home Office assessment is correct.
The question is, however, does not the arrival of Jasmine, whose rights as a
British subject should be as certain as those of any Government Minister,
change matters fundamentally both in terms of principle and of human compassion?
The London Evening Standard took up Jasmine's case last week and launched a
withering attack on Michael Howard, a man whose own forbears were offered
refuge in Britain.
At this stinging assault from a normally Tory paper the Home Office machine
moved up a gear. Its response was to leak to a less scrupulous and even more
loyal Tory tabloid damaging details about Jasmine's mother. It seems Mrs
Sorabjee is no angel. She has a criminal conviction and a number of minor
points against her character.
It is perhaps as well that the Home Office officials, acting on the orders of
their political masters, were unable to find anything too damaging against
three-year-old Jasmine or no doubt she as well as her mother would have been
the target of this vicious brand of character assassination. Perhaps the spin
doctors could have designated the toddler as a potential future criminal or,
even worse, a likely future single parent.
So at the end of this sorry tale there was no room at the inn for Jasmine and
her mother who now face an uncertain future in Kenya. Michael Howard remains
Home Secretary and the Evening Standard is left openly musing what manner of
people it has supported in office as Ministers of the Crown.
Unlike Jasmine, Mr Abiodun Igbindu is not yet on the plane for Africa, although
few would give much for his chances of hanging on in Britain for long. Mr
Igbindu arrived in June at Heathrow and sought political asylum, citing his
previous torture and arrest in Nigeria as a pro-democracy activist. Over the
period his case has been heard there has been ample evidence that Nigeria is
not a healthy place to be and among those who have made representations include
the former Home Secretary Douglas Hurd.
However, things have gone downhill at the Home Office since Douglas Hurd was in
charge. Rattled by the extent of cross-party support Mr Igbindu was receiving,
details of his application were passed to Conservative Central Office who then
offered them to newspapers because ``we do not feel we have got our case across
on this one''.
That statement from a Tory spokeswomen, printed on the front page of the
Guardian yesterday, betrays a great deal. Clearly in Tory central office these
cases are regarded as essentially political battles where there is no
distinction between the role of the political party and that of the Government
department.
Tory central office now acts as a sewer for whatever slime can be directed at
any unfortunate applicant whose case is in danger of stirring the public
conscience.
The Guardian quotes the former director of research at Tory central office on
the Government's re-election strategy as placing the attitude to the new Asylum
Bill in its political context. He said: ``Immigration, an issue which we raised
successfully in 1992 and again in the 1994 Euro-elections campaign, played
particularly well in the tabloids and has more potential to hurt.''
Those hurt to date by this shameful playing of the race card include a
three-year-old child and a Nigerian dissident.
One of the attractions of a written constitution and a Bill of Rights proposed
by the SNP for the constitution of a new Scotland is that it would afford all
our citizens the protection of entrenched rights, separated from the whim of
any politician on the scrounge for the cheapest form of votes.
In two weeks' time the Home Office will host its annual Christmas reception.
Perhaps over the sounds of merriment Mr Howard and his Scrooge-like Ministers
might just hear the occasional rattle of Marlow's chains.

THE exhibition celebrating 75 Years of Painting recently held at Glasgow School
of Art, has led to the gift of a large collection of drawings, and a book of
newspaper cuttings, by the family of the late Paisley artist Archibald A
McGlashan (d.1980).
The drawings witness some of the concerns of the life class before the First
World War while the cuttings reveal much about art in Scotland in the 1920s.
In his best drawings, McGlashan captures anatomical form with a rugged outline,
achieving structure by vigorous diagonal hatching. Used together, the drawings
and cuttings reveal the career of the artist and the stylistic and moral
influence of the school on its students, while Fra Newbery was its director
(until 1917).
The present director of the school, Dugald Cameron, shares important values
with Newbery: the value of drawing to artists, its link to the values of the
past, and the beneficial role of the artist in society. Cameron describes
drawing as ``the one golden thread'' that links the past to the present.
At present, he sees the artist's role as limited by a public perception of
self-indulgence, a view he would like to see changed. As McGlashan's cutting
book reveals, fads and fashion were secondary to individual personality when he
was a student from 1908-13. Newbery's students had enough strength of
conviction about this, to pay tribute to him for having ``held up to his
students a fine ideal of their personal development''.
The art event of 1919 in Glasgow was the formation of the ``rebel artists''
Glasgow Society of Painters and Sculptors (GSP&amp;S), which included Newbery
students as its leading members: James Cowie, William McCance, McGlashan, Agnes
Millar Parker, Robert Sivell, and the sculptor Benno Schotz.
These ``rebels'' would each gain positions of importance in the Scottish art
world. McGlashan's cuttings give a blow-by-blow account of the arguments and
tensions within the society, leading to a spectacular split at the 1921
exhibition.
This long-forgotten event is of importance to Scottish art because it is proof
that a brotherhood of values existed, shared by the hanging committee members.
Cowie, McGlashan, Sivell, and Schotz rejected half of the 30 members' work, and
displayed 40 of their own works out of a total of 63 at the 1921 exhibition, an
understandably controversial act.
Set in the international context, their action was significant since it came at
a time when European art was in a state of turmoil after the trauma of the
First World War - a time when, as yet, no new art form or style had emerged out
of the chaos of war.
Informed by Newbery's influence, and the Scots sought experience of the war,
which for these artists was a combination of pacifist oppositon to war, and
soldiers' disgust with war. Each would seek to renew the humanist tradition
that had existed in art since the Renaissance, and concern themselves with the
human condition, in a world shattered by war. The events of 1921 were a public
statement of these concerns.
Their values were influenced by socialist ideals. Like the Glasgow leaders of
the Independent Labour Party: Patrick Dollan, David Kirkwood, James Maxton, and
John Wheatley, (Dollan and Kirkwood were painted by McGlashan) they would
strive for the improvement of society, using democratic and traditional moral
values and resisting the alienating qualities of modernism.
At Glasgow School of Art, it was the attempt to identify half its history of
creativity, that persuaded McGlashan's family, particularly his daughter Agnes,
to place the drawings and cuttings where she feels they belong, in the archives
of Glasgow School of Art. A place where students can easily view and learn some
of the concerns of the past that have relevance today from an important
predecessor.

IT seems to me that all the recent critics of John Macleod are intellectual
pygmies compared to your outstanding journalist. They cannot hold a candle to
him.
Hugh Phillips says we should expect more from a Christian journalist in one of
our quality newspapers. Have your correspondents studied some of the
contributions of so-called top-rate journalists in most of our quality
newspapers?
Believe me, in John Macleod you have one of the best quality journalists and
religious writers.
All your correspondents go on about the saccharine-type Christian love, sickly
ecumenism, the ``need'' for meeting together (no matter what we believe), and,
of course, the bogyman of them all - the hated fundamentalism which was the
doctrinal stance of the early New Testament Church.
Not one of John Macleod's critics, it seems to me, can present him with a
convincing intellectual argument against his doctrinal views, particularly on
the doctrine of the Church. John Macleod is, from a Protestant point of view,
doctrinally sound, historically accurate, and journalistically brilliant.
It is often the aim and objective of less talented men and women to destroy
such writers and apologists for the Protestant faith and, of course, your
recent correspondents are at it again - sack John Macleod!
Tom Gill describes him as offensive, conveniently forgetting that there is such
a thing as the offence of the Gospel. John Knox, John Calvin, and Martin Luther
would no doubt also be described by John Macleod's critics as ``lacking love''
because they attacked doctrinal error in their day.

POLITICIANS, whatever they might tell you, take opinion polls seriously,
especially if their party is reflected to advantage. Mr George Robertson was
undoubtedly happy last night at the performance of Labour in our System Three
poll, particularly as the percentage rise in his party's popularity over two
months was 11%. No doubt he will be able to advance many reasons for this
result, yet it comes against the backdrop of a time in which the Labour Party
has not been particularly active, preferring instead to watch the Secretary of
State for Scotland, Mr Michael Forsyth, work himself into a lather of
``listening'' and activity which appears to have brought his party not the
slightest benefit.
Mr Robertson is not a superstitious soul; he will insist that Labour's
programme, together with the Liberal Democrats, on constitutional reform in
Scotland is the issue which has brought the greatest dividends. He is probably
correct in this analysis. There does appear to be a settled appetite for a
measure of devolution within the minds of the Scottish electorate and it is
likely that this will have been enhanced by the various St Andrew's Day
announcements of which Mr Forsyth's was the least impressive.
The Scottish Nationalists will be disappointed by this poll. They have already
had evidence that some of those who vote for them prefer devolution to
independence and this cast of opinion will probably strengthen as a General
Election approaches. There is little that can be said about the Tories, save
the obvious fact that their hyper-activity of recent months has not impressed
the electorate. There should, however, be real sorrow at the lowly state of the
Liberal Democrats who have persisted in thinking creatively about many
political issues but who appear fated never to get the credit for their
contribution.

LED from the front by Chief Constable Leslie Sharp, Strathclyde Police have in
the past four and a half years achieved results which can safely be held to
have exceeded anything achieved by any other UK police force since the war.
To reach that conclusion it is necessary to believe that paramount among the
primary tasks of the police is reducing the crime rate; explaining how this has
been achieved brings Leslie Sharp close to the areas which cause him fears for
the continuation of those successes in the future. Therein also lies the
explanation for his retiral six months early, and at a point when it is clear
he would have liked to have driven on another two years to see his
self-appointed task through.
Principal of these caveats is the current reorganisation of local government.
The political imperative which informed the changes is outwith his agenda but
he can foresee the possible consequences with attendant difficulties for the
Scottish police service as a whole and Strathclyde Police in particular.
Outwith these current difficulties, he believes that in about the next seven
years Scotland will have just one police force.
Mr Sharp says that the case for the single force will become undeniable if the
devolution debate moves forward at its present pace.
He does not, however, see an all-Scottish force as a national police force
controlled by a ministry of justice, but sees instead, in the current trend
towards widening the role of institutions such as the Scottish Grand Committee
and the Scottish Economic Council, an expanded role for the Scottish Office's
Police Advisory Board. That body, with its elected representatives from Cosla,
the police staff associations, the consumer groups and the Government itself,
could form the basis of a new all-Scottish police authority which need not
slavishly follow the lines of the widely-respected Northern Ireland Police
Authority but which would obviously have similarities.
``I have maintained this point of view since 1991 and the idea has not been
dismissed by the Scottish Office. The Police Advisory Board could form the
necessary buffer between the force and central government, taking out direct
political control.''
He believes there is nothing to fear from such a development.
Turning to the partnership between the Strathclyde force and the police
authority he had only praise. He told the authority only last week - composed
almost 100% of Labour councillors - that Strathclyde had become a ``shining
beacon in terms of law and order'', an extravagant-sounding assertion which
stands up not badly to closer examination. He also said, importantly, that they
- the chief constable and his Labour-controlled committee - had walked a
tightrope amazingly well.
The real sense of regret that this relationship will end with the demise of
Strathclyde Regional Council is something that Leslie Sharp does not disguise.
He puts down much of the success of his policing to the strategic overview
possible under the council's all-embracing wing. This enabled him to take a
wider view, to dovetail specific, on-the-ground police initiatives into
communities hand-in-hand with education, social work, housing and even roads,
drainage and sewage departments. Entire areas, many blighted by crime,
deprivation, poverty, poor housing and degraded infrastructure, benefited as a
result.
``My organisation has a strategic role in the West of Scotland and the regional
council had the same boundary and the same strategic approach to the provision
of services. When the council disappears I find no new organisation which
matches my strategic role. That could create difficulties between the chief
constable and the new unitary authorities, each one of which will contribute
their share of resources.
``Yet I must have mobility of labour to police the area. What will happen when
I move officers away from one town to police disorder, or even floods, in
another? It could be regarded with suspicion, so people will simply have to see
it could be their turn next,'' he says.
The new joint police board drawn from the 12 authorities will therefore have to
attempt to reach a wider vision, he believes, otherwise the new chief constable
(John Orr) will find himself in difficulties.
To focus this problem, Leslie Sharp points to the potential in Glasgow for
explosions of violence, a historical recurrence since the 1930s, and which from
time to time requires intensive policing. On the other hand, because of the
vastness of the territory, Argyll gets greater use of the police helicopter, an
expensive resource.
``That is what the new unitary authorities must take on board,'' he says.
``They will have their own parochial concerns but they must not forget the
strategic overview.''
He is currently trying to impress on them the need to undertake certain
functions jointly, such as emergency planning, child protection and road safety.
``At the moment, I have one-door entry with the roads department on road
safety. Do I now have to share this with 12 roads departments? We had one-door
entry on child protection, with the education department, social work, the
reporter to the children's panel which in practice worked very well. After
April 1, is the chief constable to work with 12 directors of social work on
child protection?
``Law and order in its broadest sense will be entirely dependent on how
succesful the new unitary authorities are at joint working in these key areas.
The other side of the coin, where the tensions could arise, is that if they are
successful at joint working will not the Scottish Office start looking askance
at what looks suspiciously like the creation of another Strathclyde Regional
Council?'' he asks.
There are two other vital areas which Leslie Sharp speaks about which bear
heavily on his retirement decision; pointers to why he wishes to call a halt to
a 40-year policing career. Both are political in the sense that they point
towards the current Government's policies.
At a time when, post Operation Eagle, Strathclyde Police are co-operating as
never before with the Customs service to combat drugs smuggling, to the point
where there is complete sharing of intelligence data matched only by the
Metropolitan Police, he despairs when he sees that the nation's perimeter fence
is crumbling. It does not make sense, he says, to close the Customs office at
Campbeltown just as a new ferry service to Northern Ireland begins; that is one
tiny, but irksome example. He is sceptical of Government claims that the
``new'' Customs operations will be just as effective for being more
intelligence based. Perhaps so, but they will miss the benefits of
knowledgeable pairs of eyes at every port.
And Sheehy. Has the police service recovered from its gutting at the
Thatcher-inspired hand of the tobacco baron?
``Oh no,'' says Leslie Sharp. ``In my 40 years two major themes have emerged
from the policing debate. The first is that the chief constables must have
constitutional independence from political control. Every Royal Commission has
concluded that there should only be one boss for the chief constables and that
is the law of the land.
``What Sheehy has done is to dent that concept. He did not do so maliciously,
but the way his suggestions have been adopted have done the damage. I am aware
of the arguments against jobs for life, but if a chief constable is coming to
the end of a fixed-term appointment it seems to me to be very difficult for him
to exercise impartial judgment. Add to that the fact he can earn up to 7.5%
bonus against objectives set by his local authority and it is a recipe for
disaster. These things could be very dangerous in the wrong hands, and who is
to say that local authority or ministerial powers will always be in safe
hands?'' he states.
When he arrived in Strathclyde, Leslie Sharp says, there was confusion as to
the role of the force. With dwindling resources and rising crime they were
trying to squeeze out as much as possible, but with no great success. He gave
them a clear set of objectives - to reduce crime, increase detection, reduce
disorder and increase road safety - at the same time as making war on
bureaucracy.
When he looks back, that seems to him to have been one of the major factors in
bringing a unified identity to the force. He also found on his desk an
inspectorate report which was harshly critical of the force's lack of success
in tackling housebreaking; a few meetings later and Operation Bud was formed,
targeting every available officer on known housebreakers, and success followed.
Detections jumped from 9% to 24%, which was modest enough, but contained
lessons.
Bud had lasted three months, so the 90-day operation was born. The importance
of better intelligence on the criminals was the salient lesson but it was also
apparent that intelligence in the force had become an exercise in card filing,
cards which were seldom read.
That was still ringing in their ears when the East End of Glasgow erupted in
gangland violence. Leslie Sharp flooded the area with officers, men from Ayr to
Tiree as he puts it, and Operation Interlock broke down the wall of silence.
It became clear from this that Strathclyde crime was floating on a sea of guns,
so Operation Spur became the third intensive 90-day purge. Every criminal
arrested, no matter how minor the offence, was interrogated on where guns could
be bought or hired, how much they cost and who had them. It was surprising how
many people brought in for mere drunkenness knew something which led to a gun.
Around 5000 have been recovered and Operation Spur survives today in its
original form.
Leslie Sharp states openly that he authorised detectives to spend money to buy
in the most dangerous weapons imaginable: Kalashnikovs and Nato semi-automatics
brought back from the Gulf war. But, as The Herald pointed out at the time, his
strategy was wilfully misunderstood by tabloids and tabloid television. It was
the intelligence which was bought, not just the guns.
He makes no bones about the fact that he forced a serious change of culture on
officers, particularly detectives, by the concentration on the gathering and
use of intelligence. Surveillance and targeting requires patience and often
wasted effort, but he declares: ``By golly, it paid off.''
He agrees that it has meant demands on the public's patience, in that the
greater good has sometimes meant that responses to lesser matters have been
delayed. He can point to the successes, however, such as Operation Blade, which
tackled knife crime, Operations Dove and the covert Hawk which tackled
drugs-fuelled violence in Paisley, Operation Turnkey which cut housebreaking in
Strathclyde by a third.
The growth of Neighbourhood Watch has helped, as has the force's concentration
on the crime prevention message and the arrival on the scene of CCTV in town
centres. In the past week Strathclyde Police has completed phase two of
Operation Eagle, the biggest and most comprehensive drive against the drugs
culture yet mounted by a UK force. The results have to be assessed in the long
term but nearly 5000 people have been arrested and #4.5m of drugs seized. The
intelligence gathered has been overwhelming.
The balance sheet of the past four and a half years shows, according to Leslie
Sharp, that no area of Strathclyde is not experiencing the benefits of
decreasing crime. Even the contentious area of crimes of violence, the 3.5% of
total crime which attracts the most comment, is responding. The current figures
which show an increase for the past summer are misleading, because the increase
reflects the increased effort by the police themselves to stop and search for
offensive weapons. Leslie Sharp is conscious that misplaced fear of violent
crime can be debilitating.
He raises fears for the future of such efforts as the Govan Initiative when
urban aid funding runs out in a year, for the many CCTV schemes when running
costs have to be met. Will the new local authorities be willing to take on the
responsibility for providing resources?
As Operation Eagle's caravan moves on, will the new drugs action teams based on
the health boards have sufficient clout and ambition to harness the vast range
of initiatives being undertaken by the health, education, caring and voluntary
agencies, and the enforcement agencies to ensure that everyone is pulling in
the same direction?
Whatever the outcome, Leslie Sharp believes the Strathclyde experience has
demonstrated that Scottish society need not simply flap its hands despairingly
in the face of crime.
``We have convinced everyone that something can be done about crime. There is
no real cause for fear or despair,'' he states.
The context of how the police operate, he adds, is the all-important factor
which facilitates this.

WITH the end of the UK Year of Literature and Writing in sight, the residents
of Swansea were perhaps suffering from a degree of festival fatigue. Maybe,
with half an eye cast towards Christmas, turning out for the penultimate event
of the year-long calendar, the Caledonian Companions took second place.
Whatever the reason, some of the events during the eight days were woefully
ill-attended.
That said, it is to be hoped that the speakers and performers who entertained
sparse audiences will go away with the impression that the enthusiasm of the
few made up for the lack of numbers.
The festival, co-ordinated by Dr Fred Freeman, scholar, broadcaster, critic,
and trustee of the Scottish Traditional Music Trust, was certainly not lacking
in gravitas or diversity. James Kelman, Sorley MacLean, Brian McNeill, Alasdair
Gray, Meg Bateman, Peter Nardini, Rod Paterson, and the Tannahill Weavers gave
voice to the disparate and exuberant elements of Scottish culture, while
re-establishing lapsed connections with Wales.
``Scotland has traditional links with Wales which are virtually forgotten,''
explains Dr Freeman. ``South of the Clyde and Forth the language spoken for
many, many years was ancient Welsh. Names like Strathclyde and Lanark are
derived from ancient Welsh. Even our national heroes like William Wallace and
our patron saints have Welsh connections.
``There are subtler associations too. Our two countries share similar elements
of irony, self-satire and black humour. We also share a tradition of pastoral
and industrial poetry and a parallel commitment to democracy.''
Thanks to the efforts of the Scottish Tourist Board and Hollywood, the outside
world has been spoon-fed a cliched and depressingly limited view of the
country. Dr Freeman is at pains to widen our horizons beyond tartan shortbread
tins, claymores, and kilts to open our eyes to the ``unhomogenous'' nature of
Scottish culture.
``I am trying to put across a broader picture, a more holistic view, for want
of a better word. It might be an unconventional approach when compared to other
literature festivals, but I don't care. I've tried to put song, literature, and
poetry back together. In my opinion, the way we teach each as a separate entity
is utterly ridiculous, they should not be compartmentalised as though each has
nothing to do with the other. I dislike also the way literature and poetry is
taught as a cold text. In many cases it needs music to bring it to life.''
The Living Across Cultures event brought together Meg Bateman, Sorley MacLean,
Hamish Henderson, and James Kelman, a hybrid gathering which threw up issues of
language, nationalism, cultural imperialism, and the tyranny of Middle English.
Both Kelman and Bateman drew attention to the popular notion of the Highlands
as one of Britain's last great wildernesses, a perception which avoids the
uncomfortable reality that the Highlands were once home to thousands.
While avoiding sinking into an anti-English quagmire, Bateman, who writes
poetry in English and in her second language, Gaelic, compared the common
experience of two Celtic nations.
``In Wales you've had the cottage burning. In Scotland we haven't got around to
doing anything so decisive. But bitterness will get us nowhere.''
Romanticism of the past and of the rural idyll earned her scorn. ``I think
romanticism is only a slightly secondary sin to prejudice as it blinds people
to each other's humanity.''
James Kelman, belligerent and vocal, hit the audience like a slap in the face
after the vulnerable charm of Meg Batemen.
Earlier he had attended a reading at the University of Glamorgan in which a
lecturer stated that the language of the African/American male was incapable of
expressing abstract thought. As Kelman pointed out those who speak in so-called
working-class accents are no stranger to this kind of elitism.
``It is really horrible to hear generation after generation after generation of
people inferiorise the native Celt. It appears as though they have no right to
take part in debates on high abstract subjects such as linguistics, art or
theology because their language indicates that their intellect is incapable of
it.''
Those who failed to turn up for Peter Nardini's gig at Wales's new literature
centre, Ty Llen, missed a rare treat. Described as a ``polymath'' and a
``modern Scottish alchemist'', the singer, songwriter, artist, and playwright
captivated a tiny but appreciative audience with his humorous, thoughtful and
articulate compositions. The Scottish people are lucky to have him on their
doorstep.

THERE is no longer much point in being nostalgic about the lost glories of
shipbuilding on the Clyde but on the subject of Yarrow we might be permitted
sorrow and a measure of anger. The point has been made on innumerable occasions
that Yarrow is a specialist builder of military warships and not very much
else. It is easy to criticise the yard and its management for this state of
affairs but, as is often the case with easy criticism, it is largely wrong. Not
everyone can build a modern, sophisticated warship and the experience of Yarrow
should make the Glasgow yard the favourite for the forthcoming Type 23 orders.
It is simplistic to say that it is this specialisation, and the excellence
which has grown from it, which has penalised the long-term future of Yarrow.
Attempts have been made to diversify into different shipbuilding sectors but
Yarrow is essentially set up to be a builder of warships and the only orders
which have been available in an industry beset by worldwide recession have been
of the sort which are not labour intensive. This is not the fault of Mr Murray
Easton or his workforce; it is a reflection of current conditions. The question
which must be asked is whether there is anything we can do about it.
The first thing the Government should do is to ensure that the Ministry of
Defence delivers orders on time. An announcement was expected by this week but
the end of February is now the likeliest date. There may be good reasons for
this, although we hope that the delay has not been caused by avoidable failures
on the part of the Ministry of Defence. It does not require a high level of
intelligence to understand that a specialised shipbuilding yard is a place of
rare and intermingled skills. Whatever the plans for Britain's surface fleet it
would be folly to allow the expertise which Yarrow personifies to be lost. It
should not be beyond the wit of the Ministry of Defence, perhaps with the
prodding of politicians, to draw up a plan for preserving skills which are
required for strategic reasons. Market forces are against this sort of thing,
of course, but then market forces know nothing of the national interest.

Paris, Tuesday . THE 11-day public sector strike in France remained in deadlock
tonight after French Prime Minister Alain Juppe announced live on television
that he would not give into union demands to withdraw reforms aimed at cutting
public spending.
Speaking hours after public sector workers staged huge demonstrations against
the government reforms in Paris and in towns throughout France, Mr Juppe
repeated the argument he had given earlier in the National Assembly, where his
government easily defeated a vote of no confidence by the Socialist opposition.
The Prime Minister acknowledged that the life of many people had become
difficult because of the strikes, and said that the country had to get out of
the deadlock.
``We cannot go on like this,'' he said. However his only concession was to
underline that no decisions had yet been taken on reforming public sector
pensions, which, he said, was to be studied by a government commission.
``I will not withdraw my programme. That would be a mistake and a fault,
against everybody's interests and against the interests of France,'' he said.
There could be no other solutions apart from the reforms proposed by his
government, said Mr Juppe, who went on to justify his measures on health
expenditure, pensions, and French railways.
``Don't believe all the lies you have been told over the past
fortnight.......these reforms are not intended          to hinder but to
help,'' he       said.
Mr Juppe said that reducing the number of those out of work remained the
absolute priority of his government, as President Jacques Chirac had promised
before his election.
The government had made progress in the fight against long-term unemployment,
the Prime Minister said, but had suffered setbacks in creating jobs for young
people.
Rounding off on a patriotic note, Mr Juppe said it was necessary to try to
understand the anxiety of university students who had been on strike for the
past month.
``But is there a single country in the world where you would rather live than
France?'' he asked.
Trade unions were unimpressed by the Prime Minister's statement, his first
since the strikes began.
Strike action in the public sector showed every sign of worsening tonight. The
union Force Ouvriere called on its members to spread the strike and the CGT
said Mr Juppe had let slip an opportunity to start a dialogue.
The Force Ouvriere leader, Marc Blondel, said the strikes would go on until the
plans were scrapped and, in a sign that he is ready for a long battle, he
launched an appeal for cash to compensate rail strikers for lost pay.
Earlier, tens of thousands of strikers braved freezing cold and snow to rally
in Paris against the planned reforms.
Trade unions said there were 160,000 marchers in Paris and one million across
France, including Toulouse, Bordeaux, Rouen, Marseilles, Nantes, and Le Mans.
The march ended in violence in the capital, where riot police intervened to
disperse about 500 youths who overturned about 20 cars. Police arrested 28
people who they described as ``uncontrolled elements'' and ``breakers'' - terms
they use for anarchists and young toughs from the Paris suburbs often bent on
looting under cover of confusion in the streets.
In one incident a dozen hooded youths on the fringes of the demonstration were
detained while apparently preparing to smash the window of a sports shop.
In Nantes, several hundred students, some hurling petrol bombs, battled riot
police firing teargas. Twenty police officers were hurt, mostly by flying
stones.
Meanwhile commuters shivered in mammoth rush-hour traffic jams that snaked into
Paris as the rail system continued at a standstill and the bus and Metro strike
entered its eighth day.
However, despite union appeals for the strike to spread beyond the public
sector, there was little sign of it catching on in private companies.
Financial markets that had been unsettled in recent days by the prospect of a
drawn-out dispute responded well to the government's determination to stick to
its guns. The franc rose against the Deutschmark and the stock market index
closed up 2.25% after a six-day slide.
As the strikes today spread to schools, hit postal deliveries, and disrupted
the telephone and electricity services, public frustration began to boil over
when a man drove his car into a group of strikers in Paris, injuring one person.

A GLASGOW secondary school last night held back from using an opt-out ballot in
its battle to keep it open.
However, the board of Garthamlock secondary expressed its ``earnest and
determined opposition'' to Strathclyde region's proposal to close the school
next June and warned that it might still seek self-governing status if the
council does not back down.
The council's education committee is due to consider the closure plan at a
meeting today. If the councillors approve the proposal, the plan will be put
out for consultation.
As revealed exclusively earlier this week in The Herald, parents have been
considering exploiting the Government's opting-out legislation as a means of
saving the school, which is less than 40% full and needs #780,000 worth of
repairs following a fire in May.
In a statement issued after a meeting last night, the school board said it had
decided not to approve a motion seeking an opt-out ballot of parents ``at
present''. It insisted that Strathclyde could partially reinstate the fire
damage at a cost of #300,000 and allow ``this attractive, well-maintained, and
genuinely successful school to continue to serve its local and distinct
community''.
The board said that it considered Garthamlock compared very favourably with
similar schools in Glasgow, particularly with regard to attendance and
examination results. It added that the prospect of sending the pupils to
Lochend or Smithycroft secondaries did not present an obvious attraction.
``Our school is a major resource for the community, being used every evening,
and on Saturdays and Sundays, by different community groups. It seems short
sighted in the extreme to close a major resource when the Greater Easterhouse
Initiative is committed to the long-term regeneration of this part of the city.
``If the education authority is prepared to opt out of its commitment to its
highly-publicised `social strategy', then the parents of this school have an
obligation to consider opting in to the responsibility of running their own
school.''

PAUL Ince, Paul Merson, and everyone else outside of England's latest squad,
now know it will take something special to break into Terry Venables' plans for
Euro `96.
With just one change - Nick Barmby for injury-hit Gary Pallister - for next
week's friendly against Portugal, the England manager signals the door to the
finals is closing.
With only the recuperating Darren Anderton and Pallister assured of a welcome
beyond the 23 players named yesterday, Venables already faces at least four
tough decisions to trim down to UEFA's 20-man limit, plus a stand-by goalkeeper.
That lays down the challenge to the likes of Ince and John Barnes, and hopefuls
like Arsenal's Merson. With only 24 hours' preparation, and encouraged by the
all-round performance in last month's 3-1 win over finalists Switzerland,
Venables would not have made many changes anyway for Tuesday's latest Wembley
friendly.
However, he warns: ``The door is not closed, but players have got to fight to
get through it now. It is still ajar, and while it is like that you can still
get through, you don't need the combination.''
``I said before that around this time I would be thinking about getting a
settled side. We're getting consistency from the players we're choosing and
that's what we're asking for. Now they've got to make sure they protect their
positions.''
Venables has included Jamie Redknapp, though he is only just recovering from
the hamstring he injured in the first five minutes against Switzerland and the
FA now face a #30,000 `insurance bill' from Liverpool.
He said: ``I spoke to Roy Evans and he expects him to play on Saturday so,
because he's a young lad, I decided to include him in the squad. Whether he'll
be fit enough to play is another matter but it won't do him any harm to be
around the squad.''

BRITAIN'S biggest-yet blitz on burglars - codenamed Operation Christmas Cracker
- went with a bang yesterday, netting 2334 suspects and #1.5m worth of stolen
goods in England and Wales.
The operation, involving 10% of the nation's police manpower, was launched with
3700 dawn raids by 12,000 officers.
Operation Christmas Cracker involved police from 40 forces and is the biggest
combined police operation yet launched in this country.
It had been developed after the success of other high-profile crime crackdowns.
From 6am, officers were forcing their way into the homes of suspected burglars
and taking away men and women for questioning at local police stations.
In Dorset, a substantial quantity of heroin was discovered.
In Cambridgeshire, one suspect was arrested after DNA profiling by police and
in Devon and Cornwall a 16-year-old runaway was found hiding at a raided
address and returned home.

FIRST there was Scotland the Brave. Now comes Scotland - The Brand.
Over the next 18 months, the Scotland - The Brand unit, which was launched
yesterday, will raise the standard for Scotland overseas to try and increase
business generated through trade, tourism and the arts.
Specifically, the four-man unit, which has a start-up budget of #300,000, has
been charged with:
n Co-ordinating the promotion and image of Scotland in three key cities of the
world, New York, Paris and Hamburg.
n Increasing Scottish exports by #5m.
n Reducing export costs for participating companies by 3%.
n Increasing the number of tourists to visit Scotland.
The unit is a joint-venture among Scottish Trade International, the joint
Scottish Enterprise/Scottish Office export body, Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, the Scottish Tourist Board, the British Council and the private
sector.
The concentration on a series of promotions in New York, Paris and Hamburg
follows a successful pilot carried out in Marks &amp; Spencer in Paris in March and
April, which led to a 145% rise in the sales of Scottish food and drink. Six
months later, sales were still up by 40% compared with the corresponding period
in 1994.
As well as events, the unit's strategy will also include networking, the
provision of advice and assistance on how best to use international perceptions
of Scotland to support company brand activity, and promotional initiatives at
some of the world's top stores, restaurants and hotels.
Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch said: ``I very much welcome and
encourage initiatives such as Scotland - The Brand and I hope that it will
assist in aggressively marketing a wide range of Scotland's products and
services throughout the world.
``Whether we are selling to Europe, the US, Japan or the Middle East, it is
important that we convey a message of a dynamic modern country. Scotland - The
Brand will do just that.
``This new promotion unit for trade, tourism and the arts will help raise the
awareness of Scottish products, services and culture and, at the same time,
promote a series of positive images of Scotland.
``Wearing both my industry and tourism hats, I am particularly delighted that
we are recognising the benefits in working together to maximise and capitalise
on our strengths in promoting Scotland and all that is best in Scotland.''
Lord Macfarlane, chairman of Scotland - The Brand, said the setting up of the
unit was a major step forward in marketing Scotland overseas.
``It follows on from our conference last year at which business leaders from
throughout the country supported the concept of a central promotions agency.
This collaboration between STI, the STB, HIE, and the British Council, together
with the private sector, is the start of a journey to use our resources and
target our efforts more effectively.''
Robert Crawford, MD of Scottish Enterprise Operations, said: ``Scotland - The
Brand is a practical pragmatic promotional unit working in three international
cities where the STB is actively promoting Scotland as a tourism destination.
``It is giving greater focus to Scottish products already in the market place
and actively encouraging department stores, restaurants, hotels and speciality
shops to increase their range of Scottish produce.''
Derek Reid, STB chief executive, said the tourist industry had already shown
the benefits of co-operation, having worked closely with the promoters of Rob
Roy and Braveheart to sell Scotland to the world while, at the same time,
increasing revenue.
He said: ``Scotland - The Brand will work in tandem with the STB's overseas
consumer campaigns to enhance the reputation for quality products which
Scotland enjoys abroad. By working in partnership, we will maximise our
marketing effort, ensuring that a wider spectrum of Scottish interests share in
this success.''
George Russell, Scotland - The Brand chief executive, said: ``Next year the M&amp;S
director in Europe wants to spread the Scotland - The Brand promotion to their
28 stores throughout Europe.
``At this stage, Scotland - The Brand will not take on the world, but we will
work initially in the three markets of common interest to the STB and STI - the
US, Germany and France, and to be more specific in New York, Hamburg, and
Paris.''

THE outcry about BSE is over dramatic with insufficient attention paid to
assessment of the evidence, one of Scotland's leading animal scientists claimed
yesterday.
Professor Ian Aitken, scientific head of the Moredun Research Institute at
Edinburgh, said that in all the recent media attention there had been little
reference to the strong scientific support which the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food had available to it.
As scare stories began to spread and people talked of stopping eating beef,
there was a need for a cool, detached assessment of the scientific evidence,
Professor Aitken said. ``That is what has been lacking in the recent publicity
about BSE.''
Such facts came most effectively from scientific experts who had been
particularly concerned with the issue of BSE, he added. They were the principal
source of advice to Government departments.
``Ministry scientists have taken sensible, practical measures based on the
information available.''
Professor Aitken pointed out that the disease had been very quickly identified,
and appropriate measures put in place. ``All credit is due to the veterinary
sceintists at MAFF and elsewhere who have made a remarkable contribution to
understanding this disease.''
He admitted that very few cases had been discovered in other countries,
relative to the numbers found in Britain - but there had been instances
recorded in Ireland, Germany, France and Italy. ``One would have to ask if the
same rigour of diagnosis and scrutiny was being applied in other countries as
in this country,'' he said.
Professor Aitken was speaking during a press visit to the Moredun's new home in
the Pentlands Science Park, near Penicuik in Midlothian. The Moredun scientists
and other staff are about halfway through a #22m project which will see all
their work transferred from Gilmerton in Edinburgh to the new science park.
The development is being partially funded by the sale of the 31-acre site at
Gilmerton - bought for #2999 in 1920 by the four farmers who founded the
organisation to carry out research into animal diseases as a way of improving
the quality of their stock.
The science park, supported by European money and Lothian and Edinburgh
Enterprise, forms part of an animal science ``industry'' which has grown up in
Edinburgh and the rest of Midlothian with an annual turnover of about #75m and
employing about 2000 people.
The next phase of the development will include the transfer of the Moredun's
laboratories from Gilmerton. The present buildings on the new site include the
Moredun Foundation's headquarters which will also provide core facilities for
tenant companies. The aim is to encourage small science-based operations to
``cluster'' around the main facilities provided in the park.
The site also has facilities for housing cattle, sheep and goats. Three
separate flocks of sheep are maintained on nearby farmland to meet the
requirements of the centre.
One of the buildings now nearing completion houses high security isolation
units where animals can be kept in a germ-free atmosphere from birth. Staff
entering the area pass through a system of air locks and are required to shower
twice before entering the negative pressure rooms where the animals are housed.
The stringent precautions, which meet the latest Home Office specifications,
allow work to be done with genetically manipulated organisms which can be
contained within the unit.

THREE police academy instructors lost their jobs after ordering two cadets to
eat cigarette sandwiches as punishment for smoking.
The cadets vomited. One collapsed and was taken unconscious to a hospital.
``There were three training advisers involved in the incident. As of today they
are no longer employed,'' said Hugh Foster, director of the Criminal Justice
Training Centre at Golden West College, Huntington Beach, California.
The two cadets admitted being smokers during an inspection on Friday and were
then ordered to eat cigarette sandwiches. They have recovered, Foster said.
``The recruits were ordered to place their cigarettes between two pieces of
bread and to take two bites each,'' said Foster. ``After that, they were given
about 250 push-ups and 50 pull-ups.''
Both cadets remain in the training programme and are expected to be among 22
classmates graduating on Friday.-AP.

TWO hundred Roman Catholic members of St Paul's parish in Edinburgh's Muirhouse
have objected to the Vatican over the suppression of an educational pack
intended to teach school pupils about the dangers of HIV and Aids.
The parishioners said in a petition that the pack had been produced to enable

avoid the risk of the HIV virus.
The parishioners said the pack had been effectively banned without any

HOPES of a modest recovery in retail sales in November after two drab months
were boosted yesterday by figures from the British Retail Consortium, published
for the first time. The retailers' trade organisation again called for lower
interest rates.
The consortium's retail sales monitor showed an annual increase in the
like-for-like value of retail sales of 3.2% last month. This compared with 2.4%
in October and 3.4% in September.
``November was a marginally better month, with the onset of colder weather
proving particularly helpful for clothing and footwear retailers,'' the
consortium said. But rises in sales of food and drink were slightly weaker than
in previous months.
``The retail market remains extremely competitive with widespread price
promotion,'' the consortium added. ``The flat housing market limited sales of
related retail products, including furniture and carpets.''
Andrew Higginson, chairman of the consortium's economic affairs committee,
said: ``This modest improvement in retail sales is welcomed, but the overall
market remains fragile.
``Retailers will be hoping that the rise can be sustained through Christmas. A
cut in interest rates would provide a further useful boost to consumer
confidence.''
The Retail Consortium's new monthly monitor is a welcome additional source of
survey evidence and may prove to be a better guide than the CBI's distributive
trades survey, due tomorrow. But there are two major drawbacks. There is no
volume data and they are not adjusted for seasonal influences.
James Capel's Adam Cole said that, in order to get to the official retail sales
volume figures, it would be necessary to guess price movements and the
adjustments used by the Central Statistical Office. The figures had the
advantage over the CBI's of covering the whole month rather than just the first
two weeks. Values were also quantified.
Mr Cole is forecasting that the volume of retail sales rose 0.5% last month.
The CSO figures are due on Wednesday of next week, the same day as the
Chancellor meets the Governor of the Bank of England to determine whether rates
should be cut.
Andrew Sentance, the consortium's chief economic adviser, said: ``Retail sales
values are not yet increasing sufficiently strongly to provide the basis for
substantial volume growth.
``However, the Budget will put some money in taxpayers' pockets next year.
Helped by falling mortgage interest rates, 1996 should see a stronger consumer
economy than this year.''

By GRAEME SMITH
A CONVICTED drugs dealer claimed yesterday that he ``ran circles round the
police'' because of information from a corrupt detective to whom he paid
thousands of pounds.
Ronald Cormack, who is serving a 15-year sentence imposed earlier this year for
drugs offences, was giving evidence at the trial of Grampian Police officer
Neil Cooper.
Mr Cooper, 36, denies corruption charges involving Cormack.
They include corruptly accepting #6000 and a number of subsequent payments and
giving Cormack details of confidential police information in relation to his
drug trafficking operations.
Cormack said he had been offered ``the services of a policeman'' by his
long-time friend Ian Smith, known as ``Fat Billy''.
He said Smith told him he could get Mr Cooper to pass information for payment.
He said Smith set up a meeting involving the three of them and Mr Cooper
confirmed he could supply information.
Cormack told the court: ``I said I wanted to make sure it was genuine
information. He said he would give me information that would confirm it beyond
doubt.''
Cormack said that, at their next meeting, in the Lochside bar, Mr Cooper told
him where his drugs were coming from and about surveillance operations. He said
he knew the information was good when Mr Cooper named one of his main drug
contacts, and an agreement was reached.
He said: ``Cooper told me he was getting the information from his brother, who
was working on the case.''
He said Smith was to act as their go-between and he paid Cormack #6000 that
day, followed by a weekly retainer of a couple of hundred pounds.
Cormack said his first meeting with Mr Cooper was in the spring of 1993. He
said he wanted ``inside information'', such as the undercover cars the police
used and the names of their informants.
One of the named informants was Kevin Jacks, to whom Cormack was supplying
drugs - so he used Jacks to feed false information to the police. That false
information was eventually fed back to him through Mr Cooper.
``I was feeding other information to see if it was coming back and also to
cause a lot of confusion,'' said Cormack.
He added:``I set up stings to make them look fools. Cooper warned me they were
going to set me up if they couldn't catch me legal.''
Cormack agreed that he had continued dealing in drugs through 1993 and 1994 and
added: ``I ran circles round them due to the information I was getting. I would
wind them up and make them know I was there.''
However, he said he cut Mr Cooper off in early 1994. He said: ``I took the
information but I didn't trust him.''
Cormack said he had no similar dealings with any other policemen.
Asked the total amount of money he had given Mr Cooper, he replied: ``I didn't
keep a tally, thousands. There had been an initial payment of #6000 and another
#1000 to #2000.''
Earlier, Cormack had told the court how Mr Cooper helped to avert trouble on
two occasions.
The first was after counterfeit watches which Smith sold were stolen. Cormack
said he and Smith tracked down Brian Brown, the man responsible, and added: ``I
stuck a gun under his chin and told him if there were any more threats he would
be dead before he hit the floor.''
He said Smith later phoned Mr Cooper to tell him what happened.
Cormack said: ``About two or three weeks later, I got a phone call at the house
and Smith said if I had a gun in the house to get rid of it because I might get
a call from the police.''
He said Mr Cooper briefed him on what to say before he went for his interview,
which was carried out by Mr Cooper and another officer. After the interview, he
heard nothing more of the incident.
Cormack then told of a break-in at the Inn at the Park Hotel, which he claimed
he arranged at the request of someone with ``a close connection'' to the hotel.
While he and Smith were inside, their lookout, Jim Reid, was arrested. After
waiting some time to find out what was happening, Smith phoned Mr Cooper at
Queen Street Police headquarters.
Mr Cooper told him Reid was in the cells but had said nothing. He said Reid was
going to go down only for illegal possession of a mobile phone.
The trial continues today.
Lord Macfadyen yesterday issued a reprimand to the Aberdeen Press and Journal
after a series of inaccuracies in their reporting of the trial.
He warned journalists he would take a serious view of any further inaccuracies
in their coverage of the case.

<TEXT>
A PLANNING officer was ``enormously shocked'' when he learned that a
145-year-old Gothic church was being demolished, he told a court yesterday.
Mr Michael Hayes, 48, told Glasgow Sheriff Court how he sent his staff to try
to halt the workmen.
They failed, and Milton Free Church of Scotland in the city centre conservation
area was razed.
Mr Hayes, Glasgow's director of planning, was asked by depute fiscal Mrs Anne
Currie: ``What was the effect?'' He said: ``We were left with an eyesore
......a hole on what was a high-profile site in a conservation area, leaving
the backs of tenements in view.''
The church's minister, the Rev.John A.M.Mackay, of Aithrey Avenue, Jordanhill,
Glasgow, denies having the building demolished without proper permission.
Mr Hayes told Sheriff James Keegan that he had talks with Mr Mackay, who is
also the minister for the St Vincent Street church, a Greek Thomson grade A
listed building.
He told Mrs Currie he did not indicate that the Milton church in Garnethill
could be demolished, nor did any of his staff or the planning committee.
Mr Hayes sent staff to try to stop the demolition after he received a fax from
two members of the public concerned about it.
But he did not seek an immediate court order to stop the demolition, he said.
Mr John McCluskey, 42, a planning department enforcement officer, told how he
went to the site on Friday, May 26, and found workmen stripping the roof and
demolishing the building.
He told the foreman of the firm, Burnthills, that they did not have permission
to knock the church down.
He telephoned Wiseman Associates, of East Kilbride, the agents for Burnthills,
and informed them as well.
But when he returned after the holiday weekend he found the spire demolished
and the windows smashed and the interior damaged. On his third visit the church
was completely gone.
Mr McCluskey told defence solicitor Mr Alan Thomson that he did not know that
the contract with Burnthills had been made by the deacons' court of the church
before Mr Mackay was its minister. He said: ``As far as I was aware, Mr Mackay
was the minister of both congregations.''
A plan for a new church on the gap site was later refused by the council, the
court heard.
The case was adjourned until January 29.

AFTER just over eight months, Devro International has received US approval to
proceed with its #187m acquisition of the Teepak International edible food
casings manufacturer.
The deal was originally agreed in March whereby the Scottish sausage skin
manufacturer would buy Teepak of Illinois for $133.5m and the assumption of
debt of up to $155m. At a stroke, Devro becomes the world's largest
manufacturer in this sector, but it had to dispose of its own collagen sausage
casings business of Devro America.
Last year, the American subsidiary made pre-interest profits of #1.9m on sales
of #20.9m. That compared with a group total of pre-tax profit of #29.1m and is
just 4% of Devro and Teepak combined.
One slight snag is that the existing subsidiary manufactures casings for
Devro's other international markets and when sold there could be an impact.
Devro chief executive Graeme Alexander said that this was no big headache.
The deal will be satisfied by a mixture of equity, bank loans and using Devro's
own cash. To cover the near #30m cash element, there will be a placing and
clawback of Devro shares.

Washington, Tuesday. DOCTOR DEATH has chosen a new title for himself: he wants
to be known as a ``obitiarist''.
Dr Jack Kevorkian, who has helped a score of people commit suicide and has, so
far, escaped all legal penalties for his activities, has issued a set of
guidelines for assisted suicide, a process he wants to call ``patholysis''.
Seven other doctors joined him in promulgating the guidelines, which were
promptly denounced by the American Medical Association.
The AMA considers its members bound by the Hippocratic Oath to do patients no
harm, and therefore rigorously excludes assisted suicide by doctors, whatever
they call it or themselves.
Dr Kevorkian's new procedures provide that a patient should offer a written
request for a doctor to kill him. It should be witnessed by a doctor and two
adults who have no financial interest in the patient's estate.
Furthermore, the request would have to be accompanied by a statement from a
specialist in the patient's illness, a pain-management specialist, and a
psychiatrist, to the effect that the patient was in sound mind, and suffering
from an incurable disease that causes insufferable agony. When the
``patholysis'' is carried out, the patient must be in control of the procedure
and able to stop it.
It remains to be seen whether Dr Kevorkian will abide by his own rules. He has
devised a suicide machine and has set it up in patients' apartments, in the
back of a van, and in public parks. He has been prosecuted several times under
the laws of Michigan, where he lives, and the laws have been changed to forbid
his activities.
So far, however, he has escaped conviction and insists that he will continue
with his mission in life, which is to allow terminally ill people to end their
own lives.

Dundee 1, Dumbarton 1
JIM Duffy's Dundee threw away a golden opportunity to grab leadership of the
first division when they were held to a draw by strugglers Dumbarton at Dens
Park last night.
The visitors, mauled by city neighbours Dundee United by 8-0 at Tannadice Park
last weekend, must have gone in to last night's contest with some trepidation.
But, clearly hyped up for the occasion by manager Jim Fallon, the Sons battled
their way to a worthy point.
With newcomer Ken Meechan in goal for the first time, the Dumbarton defence
looked solid as Dundee found little comfort in a monotonous series of attacking
movements.
Time and again the Dark Blues appeared to carve their way through on goal, only
to be denied by a challenge or clearance.
The home men's biggest problem became frustration, and it showed even when they
were ahead in the latter stages of the game.
Having battered their heads off the Dumbarton defensive wall for much of the
night, Jim Duffy's hosts finally broke through in 65 minutes, Paul Tosh netting
his seventh goal of the season with a powerful left-foot volley from a cross by
substitute Roy McBain.
That looked enough to assure the points which would have seen Dundee leapfrog
into pole position in the promotion chase, but the battling visitors had other
thoughts on the matter.
And as Dundee attempted to add to their lead instead of sitting on it, they
were hit by Dumbarton's last throw of the dice.
Experienced Chic Charnley sent in a deceptive cross from the right and Steve
Dallas found himself surprisingly unchallenged inside the six-yard box to
direct a perfect header home for the equaliser.
In the end Dundee had only themselves to blame for their disappointment.
Territorially they had every advantage, only to fail in front of goal.
DUNDEE - Pageaud, Farningham, McQueen, Manley, Wieghorst, N Duffy, Shaw,
Cargill, Tosh, Britton, Anderson. Substitutes - Hamilton, McKeown, McBain.
DUMBARTON - K Meechan, Melvin, Fabiani, King, J Meechan, Marsland, Mooney,

A MYSTERIOUS explosion ripped through the office of       an ultra-nationalist
MP in Russia's Parliament building today, heightening fears of violence
disrupting an election less than two weeks away.
Nikolai Lysenko was not in his seventh-floor office at the time of the blast.
However an aide said it started a fire and blew out the office door and window,
sending shards of glass crashing to the pavement below.
No-one was hurt but defence and security officials in the State Duma said they
feared violence could mar the election to the lower chamber on December 17.
``Terrorist attacks will go on until the armed bands led by (Chechen rebel
leaders) Dzhokhar Dudayev and Shamil Basayev are wiped out. We also must be
prepared for such acts,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, head of the Duma's security
committee.
Fears have mounted since rebels seeking independence for Chechnya turned to
guerrilla warfare. At least 12 people were killed in a car bomb blast yesterday.
Lysenko, 34-year-old leader of the right-wing National Republican Party which
is running in the election, had been in the corridor at the time.
He is an outspoken supporter of military action to smash Chechnya's
four-year-old independence drive.
Four MPs have been killed since the last election in 1993. The latest, Sergei
Markidonov, was shot dead during a campaign trip last month.
Security at the Duma is tight. Some MPs, wary of mafia-style gangs, carry guns
to protect themselves, but are obliged to leave them at the entrance.
In another violent incident today, apparently unconnected with politics, three
children were killed and three were hurt when a man took them hostage at a
kindergarten in the North Ossetia region, which borders Chechnya.
The 30-year-old attacker let off two grenades after seizing 16 children aged
four and five in the city of Vladikavkaz. The attacker, two policemen, and
three school staff were also hurt.-Reuter.

``It highlights the divisions between obscene wealth and dire poverty in a
country that is supposed to be at ease with itself.
``I would like to see the royal family tip all their baubles into a large
container and flog them off and give the proceeds to people who are in
desperate need. They should let the palaces go with the jewellery. They would
fetch a few bob too.''
Mr Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, said: ``The value of this jewellery
would keep someone in income support for 140 years.
``This just illustrates the inequalities in our society.''
Mr Flynn said he planned to drum home the point in a Commons debate on benefit
changes.
His Labour colleague for Newport East, Mr Roy Hughes, said: ``It seems a bit
irregular to carry such valuable jewellery around. Her ladyship seems to be
accident-prone.''

NOTTINGHAM Forest kept British interest in European football alive last night
with a goalless draw at Lyon in France to go through on a 1-0 aggregate.
Frank Clark's side displayed great resilience to leave another French team
feeling frustrated, after having removed Auxerre from the competition in a
previous round.
The English side's defenders worked overtime in front of keeper Mark Crossley,
with Colin Cooper at the centre of the back four the pick.
Lyon became desperate as the match progressed and keeper Pascale Olmeta was
booked for lunging at Forest's Jason Lee, before the French team's Florian
Maurice was sent off three minutes from the end for violent conduct. He stuck
out an elbow towards Cooper's face in a gesture of almost total despair, and
Dutch referee Mario Van Der Ende pointed him towards the dressing rooms.
Lyon continued to huff and puff for the remainig time but Forest stood firm,
and their players hugged each other when the final whistle sounded.
In the all-Spanish tie, Jose Maria Bakero opened the scoring just after the
hour mark for Barcelona in the Nou Camp against Sevilla.  And then the away
side's chances were dented when Jose Miguel Prieto was sent off after 67
minutes.
Gica Popescu scored for Barcelona in 80 minutes, Gabriel Moya pulled a goal
back a minute later, but Roger Garcia put the tie out of Sevilla's reach when
he made it 3-1, 4-2 on aggregate.
Francesco Totti brought the home crowd to their feet after 23 minutes when he
gave Roma the lead against Denmark's Brondby. Then midway through the second
half, Abel Baldo added a second for the home side.
Peter Moeller scored for Brondby with six minutes remaining, but in the final
minute, Amedeo Carboni added a third on the night for Roma, who won the tie 4-3
on aggregate.
Werder Bremen had high hopes of reaching the next round at the expense of PSV
Eindhoven, but their dreams and those of most of the 25,000 crowd came to
nothing when the Dutch side came away with a 0-0 draw, winning the tie 2-1 on
aggregate.
In Lisbon, two goals from Juergen Klinsmann helped Bayern Munich to a 7-2
aggregate success against Benfica.
Tonight, Real Betis hope to overcome a 2-0 deficit against Bordeaux, while
tomorrow AC Milan aim to become the fifth former European Cup champions through
to the last eight when they defend a 2-0 lead at Sparta Prague, the same day
Lens play Slavia Prague.

A WOMAN was persuaded by her brother to help forge bank notes and use a sewing
machine to perforate fake telephone stamps, Glasgow Sheriff Court was told
yesterday.
Machinist Alexandrina Cusworth, 55, worked for hours to put the perforations in
sheets of forged British Telecom #2 stamps, worth #72,000.
The court was told she had been asked to do it by her brother William Smith, a
lifer on licence who went missing after Cusworth's arrest.
Cusworth, a first offender, admitted that while acting with other persons, she
made a quantity of counterfeit banknotes, had them in her control, and
conspired with unknown persons to commit fraud with forged telephone stamps.
Mr Ian Bradley, prosecuting, revealed that when police raided Cusworth's home
at Burnett Road, Barlanark, they also found crudely forged Royal Bank of
Scotland #20 notes.
If they had been successfully passed as genuine, they would have netted
#68,000. Cusworth's job was to print the identifying numbers on them with a
commercial number stamper.
Mr Bradley told the court that while the notes were of poor quality, the #2
telephone stamps were so good that BT withdrew all the stamps and designed new
ones.
He told the court: ``Mrs Cusworth was the labour intensive link in the chain,
rather than disseminator of notes.''
He said her brother played a significant part in the operation and added: ``The
sewing machine was not the common thread. Mrs Cusworth's brother was.''
Defending advocate, Mrs Ruth Anderson, said family loyalty and stupidity had
brought Cusworth, who had not been in trouble before, to court.
Sheriff Daphne Robertson called for a social inquiry report and continued
Cusworth's bail until December 27.

ATHENS: Greek politicians have called for Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou,
who has been fighting for his life in hospital for 15 days, to be replaced. The
latest medical bulletin said Papandreou's condition had not changed.
The country has been in political limbo since the 76-year-old leader developed
lung and kidney failure. Plans over his succession are not known and there is
concern over divisions in his ruling socialist party, Pasok.
Nephew flees
MADRID: A man claiming to be a nephew of executed Nigerian human rights
activist Ken Saro-Wiwa is seeking political asylum in Spain. The man, named
only as Victor, had arrived in Valencia as a stowaway after fleeing Nigeria
following a warning of imminent arrest by its military rulers, radio reported.
Police, however, said they had no such name on their list of asylum seekers.

<HEADLINE>Son and daughter tell of prostitution, sex abuse, and torture at 25 Cromwell Street Gruesome life with the Wests</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975028347</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FAMILY life inside the Cromwell Street home of serial killers Fred and Rosemary
West was a chilling round of beatings, prostitution, sex abuse, bugged
bedrooms, and torture, according to two of the couple's children.
In calm, matter-of-fact voices, Stephen and Mae West describe their grotesque
childhoods in an interview to be broadcast on BBC television tonight.
Stephen West, 21, says his father came close to giving himself up to police
during his killing spree. He also says that, as early as 1992, Fred West
admitted to him that he had committed crimes ``worse than you can imagine'' -
and that he claimed he could not stop himself killing.
Both the West children say that if someone in authority had asked them the
right questions, their nightmare could have been ended years before.
In the programme, Inside Story, to be broadcast on BBC1 at 10pm, they say they
cannot believe their mother was guilty of the 10 murders of which she was
convicted. Ms West said her mother would not let her family visit her in prison.
They say that they had little idea of what life was like in ordinary families
and so had no way of realising how abnormal was the Wests' behaviour.
Ms West, 23, says: ``We had nothing to compare it against because we were never
really allowed to go to other friends' houses or to stay over with anybody.
``We obviously did see TV and the way people live but we envied them, we wanted
our lives to be like that.''
The two say 25 Cromwell Street was dominated by sex, with a constant stream of
men going to Rosemary West's bedroom, she flaunting herself naked in front of
visitors, and West making sexual demands on his daughters as they grew older.
Mr West remembers visiting West in a Birmingham bail hostel in 1992, when his
father was on remand on sex charges: ``He started saying that he had been
covering up stuff from all of us. He said that his life began when we went to
sleep at night.
``I asked him what he meant but he wouldn't elaborate. He said it had been
going on for years and went back to when he was in Scotland.
``He said it was a worse crime than anyone could imagine and the police would
find out soon and he would never leave prison again.''
Although Stephen and Mae Westrealised something was wrong in the Cromwell
Street household, they say that it was only after their father admitted to
killing their elder sister Heather that the full horror hit home.
Ms West says: ``I was shocked, because it could have easily been me and I
started to hate Dad from then.''
Mr West adds: ``I just couldn't believe it. I felt like someone had hit me with
a hammer and I just slid down the wall and cried.''
He was appalled to learn that a hole he had helped his father dig in the garden
had become his sister's grave.
As far back as they could remember, life in the West household revolved around
sex.
The children were shown blue movies and pornographic pictures and encouraged to
have sex as early as possible.
Mr West says: ``Dad wanted mum to be with other men and women. Dad was quite
happy for her to do it as long as she gained no enjoyment from it. If she
seemed to enjoy it, they would have a massive argument.
``He would be very jealous that she was with someone else, although he made her
do it.''
Ms West says: ``Dad used to say a father should break his daughters in and the
first-born child of a daughter should be her father's. From 11 or 12, he used
to touch us all the time. If we pushed him away, he would get angry or say we
were lesbians.''
Mr West said his father even offered him sex with his mother.
``Dad always said when you are 16 you are going to sleep with your mum and she
will teach you how you should treat a woman and how sex should be,'' he said.
The children were beaten regularly, especially by Rose, said Mr West.
He remembered one occasion when he was called home from school, forced to
strip, tied up and beaten for almost an hour with a buckle end of a belt,
because his mother thought he had stolen some pornographic magazines.
He was sent back to school with blood seeping through his shirt, he said.
The children were always dressed in shabby clothes - and ridiculed for it by
their schoolfriends.
However, Mr West remembers: ``We felt a lot happier at school, where we felt
that we were safe - even though people were taking the mickey out of us, it was
better than home.''

LOYALIST peace politician Lindsay Robb was the ``spider at the centre of a web
of intrigue'', it was claimed yesterday.
In his jury speech at the Ulster Volunteer Force gun-running conspiracy trial,
Mr Ian Bonomy QC, prosecuting, spoke of Mr Robb's peace process meetings with
Government Minister Michael Ancram at Stormont this year.
``On the face of it, he was involved in political moves towards the peace
process while he was prepared to be a participant in an enterprise to secure
weapons whose ultimate destination was Northern Ireland,'' said Mr Bonomy.
Mr Robb, 28, of Lurgan, Northern Ireland, is accused of conspiring with five
other men to further the cause of the outlawed UVF by acquiring weapons
intending to endanger life in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
The five other accused, who also deny the charges, are John Johnston, 49, of
Laurieston, Airdrie; Francis Hives, 45, of Liverpool; William McArthur, 42, of
Bonnybridge; David White, 29, of Airdrie; and Alexander Davidson, 23, of Lurgan.
Mr Robb's defence counsel Donald Findlay QC will address the jury at Glasgow's
High Court today.

IF the three wise men know anything, they are remaining remarkably stoney-faced
about the whole affair. Right before their very eyes, someone stole the baby
Jesus.
Glasgow, which for decades has been trying to shrug off its No Mean City tag,
found itself at the centre of one of the meanest thefts of the Christmas
period. The life-size sculpture of the Child in the manger was stolen on Monday
night from the nativity scene erected by the city's council in George Square.
All that was left was his bed of straw. Mary and Joseph, the wise men,
shepherds, assorted animals, and an angel continue to look mutely upon the
scene.
It is not being treated as an opportunist prank, as the glass-encased scene is
kept locked and the thief must have used some type of heavy-duty wire or bolt
cutters to cut the lock.
Tapes from security cameras trained on the square will be checked to see if the
theft was recorded.
Council leader Pat Lally said: ``I appeal to those responsible to return him to
us so that all people can look upon our nativity scene and remember the true
message of Christmas.''
The figures in the group, commissioned in 1988, cost #16,000. They were
originally made in clay and then cast in bronze-effect glass fibre. The thief
may have thought it was valuable bronze but would have realised the mistake
when it was picked up.
Or perhaps a fundamentalist Christian wanted to save Jesus from the crass
commercialism of the Son of God's birth.
Either way, the police have been called in. It is not known whether they are
looking for a man called Herod.

NO action is to be taken against ITN newsreader Julia Somerville and her
architect boyfriend Jeremy Dixon over family snapshots, police said last night.
Mother-of-two Miss Somerville, 48, who strenuously denied any wrongdoing,
expressed relief that the investigation was over after a statement from
Scotland Yard.
She and Mr Dixon, 56, were arrested on November 2 after he collected
photographs of her seven-year-old daughter in the bath from Boots the Chemist.
Miss Somerville said last night: ``There has been a deplorable invasion of my
privacy and that of my family.
``However, I have received tremendous support from my friends, colleagues, and
from the public and I would like to express my thanks for that.''
A Boots technician reported the couple after seeing the photographs.
Miss Somerville, who fought a battle against cancer, and Mr Dixon were
questioned separately by police before being released on bail.
She said at the time: ``I am horrified that a wholly innocent family occasion
has been completely misconstrued.''
Scotland Yard said it was decided that, on the advice of the Crown Prosecution
Service, no action would be taken.

SCOTTISH Industry Minister George Kynoch yesterday called on business leaders
to speak up for the Union.
Scotland was showing faster growth in manufacturing output than the UK as a
whole but Mr Kynoch warned that a tax-raising Scottish Parliament would
``threaten these successes''.
His plea also followed publication of Scottish exports reaching record levels,
up 23.6% to #14,300m in 1994.
It also coincided with recent surveys which claim up to 15 leading companies
would ``quit Scotland'' if a Scottish Parliament with tax-raising powers was
created - and Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's claim that devolution could
mean independence by 2002.

<RECORDNO>975028352</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LAMB still has a lot of catching up to do to regain its share of the home
market and build its overseas demand, officials of both the Ministry of
Agriculture and the European Commission agreed yesterday.
Its saving grace is its ability to retain a working population in difficult
areas, but if demand is not boosted even this may test the European farm
budget.
Roelof Benninck, head of the commission's beef and sheepmeat section in
Brussels, said: ``The relatively comfortable arrangement of the premium making
up income loss in the sector will ensure reasonable returns for producers,
although falling prices would put the community budget under strain.''
The introduction of quotas had slightly reduced and stabilised production at
around 1.16 million tonnes a year. But up until their introduction subsidies
had been running at 1800 million ecu a year, which was seen as ``rather
large'', he said. In the meantime, he reminded, delegates to the annual Agra
Europe meat conference in London, consumption had declined not just in line
with the fall in production but also in response to lower imports, particularly
from Eastern Europe, where sheep numbers had fallen.
He added: ``The decline in consumption in the UK, however, is alarming given
its important position in the sector.''
Jean Pierre Garnier, the UK Ministry of Agriculture's meat and livestock
adviser, had an equally tough message for British producers. Home consumption
was showing no signs of recovery following a drop of nearly 9% last year in
spite of heavy Meat and Livestock Commission promotion.
``Their task is difficult. The over 65-year olds are too large a part of lamb
consumers in Britain. The cuts for stewing and the shoulder have lost one third
of their sales in five years, with the only increase attributed to steaks and
marinated meats for barbecues.
``This would show that lamb sales recovery in the UK will also depend on the
ability of lamb to convert to further processed products - admittedly a
difficult task.''
The marketing of sheep meat was also unique in that it was the only meat to
have shown price increases in real terms in Europe over the past 30 years.
European consumers were also showing a stronger price resistance than was the
case for other meats, although this was being overcome by special promotions.
``I would, therefore, issue this warning. In order for lamb sales to progress
in Europe, they need reasonable prices in relation to other main meal items
that the consumer can afford.
``If lamb was to price itself out of the reach of mainstream consumers, a
decline similar to the decline of the veal market in Europe would be
unavoidable.''
Mr Benninck pointed out that beef also needed to remain sensitive to price.
Plotting prices against demand curves had shown a decline in demand for beef
once its wholesale price rose to more than double the pig meat price.
He also revealed a new veterinary report on the welfare of veal production
would be issued shortly with recommendations on diet and housing which would
become the basis of European law.
The resulting later maturing animals would add an esti-  mated 500,000 tonnes a
year to European meat production.

A PAINTING which once graced the walls of Beaufort Castle, the Highland home of
the Masters of Lovat, has raised more than #250,000 at an auction sale at
Christie's in New York.
The Deer Pass is a seven-foot wide masterpiece painted in 1852 by Monarch of
the Glen artist Sir Edwin Landseer, who is renowned for his dramatic images of
the Highlands.
It was bought by a private American collector for #257,097 ($398,000), twice
its expected price.
The cash will come as a welcome boost to Lovat Estates, which put it on the
market.
It follows a series of personal tragedies over the last few years and crippling
debts of #7.4m which have forced the Lovat Fraser family to embark on a
large-scale clear-out, which included the sale of the historic castle where its
ancestors had lived since the fourteenth century.

MORTON manager Allan McGraw was ``stable'' in hospital last night after having
suffered a heart attack on Monday. Club chairman John Wilson said that McGraw
was comfortable after being rushed to the infirmary for the second time inside
a fortnight.
McGraw was taken from the dugout at Dunfermline 10 days ago complaining of
chest pains but, although a heart attack was feared, the Cappielow manager
returned home after tests appeared to indicate that a stomach ulcer was the
problem.
Wilson said that everybody at Cappielow was hoping to see him make a quick and
full recovery. ``I had pleaded with him to take a break after the last fright
but what can you do with someone like Allan. He loves his job. He is synonymous
with Morton and I had to accept that he just can't keep away.''
News of his illness comes just as the stress and demands on current managers is
to be discussed today by the Managers and Coaches' Association chairman, Alex
Smith, and the Players' Union secretary, Tony Higgins.
``That is one of the items we want to talk about,'' said Higgins, ``and Allan's
illness further highlights the need to see if we can develop a management
course that would include ways of coping with the stress.
``More players are going straight from the dressing room into coaching and
management, and we feel that there should be a way of helping prepare them for
every aspect of the change.''
The managers' association has had a meeting with Rinus Michels, the former
Dutch coach, who is a consultant on the Review Commission led by Ernie Walker,
and plan to see him again.
Higgins and Smith also will spend time discussing the increasing involvement in
field offences of the procurator-fiscal in the Strathclyde region.

NANTES must overcome injury and suspension problems tonight to fulfil their
ambition of reaching the European Cup quarter-finals for the first time.
The French side, seeking one of the three remaining places in the last eight on
the final night of Champions' League games, have set trainer Jean-Claude
Suaudeau a selection poser, with two players banned and three injured.
Nantes are preparing for a home clash against Group A leaders Panathinaikos in
which they need a draw to guarantee a quarter-final place, and although they
will anxiously await the result of Jean-Michel Ferri's fitness test on a thigh
strain, they will look to the midfield skills of Chadian Japhet N'Doram and the
blossoming form of Reynald Pedros to see them through.
Panathinaikos have injury problems, too, with their main strike pair, Polish
internationalist Kryzstof Warzycha and George Donis, struggling with leg
injuries.
The Greek team also are without injured defender Thanasis Kolitsidakis and
suspended midfield player George Georgiadis, but their Argentine coach, Juan
Ramon Rocha, said. ``I hope their replacements will do their job. Our target is
victory because we want first position in our group.''
If Nantes lose, third-placed Porto can qualify for the last eight from Group A
by beating Aalborg in Denmark.
Porto coach and former England manager Bobby Robson will be missing defender
Jorge Costa, who is suspended.
``It's going to be a very tough task but we're going to play to win against
Aalborg,'' Robson said. ``There could be a surprise in Nantes. Panathinaikos
might win. I'm sure the Greeks want to stay top of the group to avoid Spartak
Moscow.''
Aalborg are hit by injury or suspension to seven players but trainer Sepp
Piontek hopes the energy and talent among his young replacements and the fact
Porto play in a Scandinavian winter could give his side an advantage.
With Spartak Moscow having secured a quarter-final spot from Group B, Poland's
Legia Warsaw and Norway's Rosenborg are battling for the second qualifying
place.
Second-placed Legia are at home against Spartak, while Rosenborg's task is less
daunting - a game with Blackburn Rovers, whose poor form has produced just one
point and the same amount of goals.
Rovers manager Ray Harford is facing a selection crisis, with eight first-team
men set to miss the tie. Paul Warhurst could be pressed into defensive duties,
while Kevin Gallagher, bedevilled by injuries in recent times, is also in the
frame.
``It's nice to see him getting close to fitness for the lad has had a torrid
time,'' said Harford. Gallagher has not played in the top team since the
opening day of the season.
Ajax have qualified from Group D but aim to stretch their unbeaten run in the
European Cup to 17 matches in their final game at home to Ferencvaros.
The Dutch side look certain to be joined in the last eight by Real Madrid, who
can only go out if they lose to Grasshopper in Zurich, while Ajax are beaten by
the Hungarians.

NATO ministers tonight gave their blessing to a 60,000-strong force to put the
lid on Bosnia's terrible war and end what was described as ``one of the darkest
chapters of modern European history''.
As the ministers talked in Brussels, advance units moved into Bosnia to prepare
the ground.
In the first joint session of Nato foreign and defence ministers since 1979,
the Alliance gave provisional approval for the biggest operation in its history
and the first outside members' territory.
Final approval will come only after the peace deal agreed in Dayton, Ohio, last
month          is formally signed in Paris          on December 14, and the
Security Council transfers its responsibility for Bosnia to Nato.
Earlier, acting Nato Secretary-General Sergio Balanzino said the mission was
aimed at ending ``one of the darkest chapters of modern European history''.
``What has happened has happened. Our job is to make sure that it does not
happen again, that the peace which has been agreed is now implemented,'' he
said.
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters he hoped the ministers'
approval of the mission would send a clear signal to the US Congress to follow
suit.
The Nato decision came as advance units were arriving in Bosnia to set up bases
for the heavily-armed troops who will start flooding in after the formal
signing of the Dayton treaty.-Reuter.

IT is a farce in the best Whitehall tradition. Unfortunately, it is all
happening backstage for the Borderline Theatre Company, and threatens its plan
to lift the curtain tomorrow on its Christmas pantomime.
Three days after Borderline, one of Scotland's best-known theatre companies,
made its award-winning artistic director Jon Murtagh redundant, it has emerged
that two of the cast's leading actors have left the production of Babes in the
Wood in sympathy with Mr Murtagh.
Borderline had planned to raise the curtain at the Magnum Theatre in Irvine on
Monday, but had to reschedule the opening for tomorrow after Mr Murtagh, who
had written, was directing, and was due to star in the panto, understandably
withdrew his services after being made redundant, forcing the company into
rewriting the panto and looking for a new dame.
Yesterday, however, its backstage problems were compounded when actors Greg
Hemphill and Joey Cooper left the production in protest at Mr Murtagh's
treatment.
Mr Drew McFarlane, Scottish organiser of the actors' union, Equity, said he
would be taking Mr Murtagh's case to an industrial tribunal.
He said: ``This whole situation has been handled appallingly by the company. We
now understand Borderline is worsening the scenario by threatening legal action
against our members, but we will defend them vigorously.''
Mr McFarlane said the backstage machinations had not been without their
farcical side. All the cast had been handed little homilies in their wage
packets. ``One said `Treat yourself and others with dignity and respect.'
Another said, appropriately, `involve others in making decisions that affect
them'.''
Mr McFarlane said they were a joke. ``Did they involve Mr Murtagh? If they had,
we might not have gone down this road. Two weeks ago, Mr Murtagh was given a
new contract to sign, yet 14 days later he had been made redundant.''
Last night, Mr Murtagh said: ``In 35 years as an actor and director, I have
never missed a show, but the action by Borderline threatens that record.
``This was a show written especially for the people of Ayrshire and any
postponement or reduction in quality of it would be a travesty and, even at
this late stage, I would hope Borderline would communicate with my union
representatives in order to salvage this deeply distressing situation.''
A company spokesman said last night that the two actors had left the pantomime
after breaking their contracts. "The show will go on,'' she added.

of concern about the threat of BSE transmission to humans.
Whole beef will continue to be served in the refectory but alternative dishes
will also be available at the #12,000-a-year school which has nearly 500 pupils.
Bursar Cameron Thaw said: ``Teachers should be aware of the policy in order to
allay parents' or pupils' fears in view of the increased media coverage of the
BSE scare.
``The policy will be reviewed once the scare is over or further guidelines are
issued by official sources.''
Schools across England and Wales have responded to requests from anxious
parents and have asked their local authority catering organisations to supply
alternatives, such as chicken and pork.
Last night, Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg stressed there was no scientific
evidence that humans were at risk.

Brussels, Tuesday
DEFENCE Secretary Michael Portillo's battle to prevent the EU from taking on
the role of Europe's protector received a massive boost today with France's
decision to end a 30-year cold-shoulder of Nato's military wing.
As he issued an call to Europe to ``get its act together'', France announced it
would take up its seat on the military committee and participate in defence
ministers' meetings.
The news boosted Mr Portillo and the British Government in their battle to
retain Nato as the bedrock of European security.
The move was clear testimony that Nato was ``the only fully-effective
organisation capable of mounting large-scale military operations'', he said.
France, which pulled out of Nato's integrated military structure in 1966
because of differences over how the US-led Alliance was run, said it wanted to
play a bigger role.
Although the move stopped short of France rejoining the military structure, the
ministers welcomed it as a boost for Nato solidarity ahead of the Bosnia peace
mission.
In a speech to the 10-nation Western European Union Assembly in Paris, Mr
Portillo warned that defence could not be seen as a plaything in the game of
European construction and that words must be supported by action.
He underlined Britain's insistence that the Government would never hand over
command of British forces to Brussels.
His address, setting out a vision of European defence, followed the Tory
conference speech in which he made an attack on Brussels and a defence of
British sovereignty.
Britain, which takes over the presidency of the WEU for six months in January,
is determined to take forward the organisation as the defence arm of the EU.
Mr Portillo said today his vision was one of ``real European defence'' with a
strong Nato to guarantee ultimate security.
q.Nato Ministers today endorsed Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana as the
Alliance's ninth secretary. He replaces Belgian Willy Claes.

A MAN has been jailed for subjected his girlfriend to a sustained attack just
nine days before she gave birth to his son.
Alexander Barclay, 23, was jailed for 15 months at Edinburgh Sheriff Court
yesterday for the ``disgraceful'' incident.
Sheriff Charles Stoddart heard that Barclay battered his heavily-pregnant
live-in lover as she lay in bed just three days before last Christmas.
Barclay, of Crown Street, Edinburgh, admitted the assault. He came home from
the pub at 1am after a drinking spree and turned his anger on his girlfriend
when she told him to be quiet so that she could get some sleep.
Depute-fiscal Margaret Graham described how he grabbed his girlfriend from
behind, pulled her hair, put his hands round her neck, and punched her several
times.
He continued to hit her when she got out of bed and blows landed on her head
and arms as the attack went on from the bedroom to the living room.
The woman was hysterical, crying and screaming, but still Barclay attacked her.
A neighbour eventually called police but Barclay at first refused to let them
into the flat.
The officers got in when the woman asked for help, and they found her with a
swollen and bleeding face. She estimated her ordeal had lasted for 45 minutes.
She had also suffered a three-centimetre cut to the back of her head which was
stapled at hospital.
Fortunately there was no harm to the unborn boy who was delivered nine days
later.
Defence solicitor Brian Gilfedder said there was an argument and the woman hit
Barclay but that was no excuse.
Sheriff Stoddart pointed out that Barclay had four previous convictions for
assault and had previously been sentenced to both community service and
probation, as well as prison.
``This was a disgraceful assault,'' he said.

<TEXT>
A SENIOR executive of a multinational quarry company, Mr John Leivers,
yesterday denied employing anyone who worked for Western Isles Islands Council
or who was a member of the council.
He spoke after reports of a row over the appointment of Mr Graham Edwards, a
former assistant director of administration who retired from the council a few
months ago, and who was appointed as a PR representative for Redland Aggregates
in the islands two weeks ago.
He was the official dealing with the council's case at the eight-month public
inquiry into Redland's planning application for a #70m coastal superquarry at
Lingerbay in Harris.
Yesterday, at the council's policy and resources committee, during a discussion
on the Nolan ``sleaze'' report, Councillor Roddy Murray referred to a newspaper
article which stated: ``The company admits that a number of other unnamed
people in the islands had been retained for `legal and planning advice'.''
Mr Murray asked that the chief executive, Mr Brian Stewart, should write to
Redland to find out who those unnamed people were.
Councillor George Lonie also moved that the chief executive inform the
Secretary of State of the appointment of Mr Edwards.
He agreed with Councillor Angus Graham, vice convener, that there should be a
code of conduct for officers of the council as well as members, and that that
issue too should be brought to the attention of the Secretary of State.
The vice-convener then referred to a question tabled for the full council
meeting by Councillor Alasdair Nicholson. This asked who had been paid a
retainer by Redland Aggregates from 1993 onwards while in employment or on duty
with the council and, secondly, what hospitality had been afforded by the
company either to council staff or council members.
Mr Graham said: ``There is a very serious allegation in these questions. For my
part, as someone who was closely involved with the planning application as
chairman of the development services committee, I take great exception to the
suggestion in these questions.
``Some members, I think, should put up or shut up.
``If we are putting up then it is a matter for the police.
``I find it quite scurrilous that such questions should be put. I am quite
positive that no officer or member of this council took any reward or any
hospitality from Redland.''
Before leaving Stornoway Airport after a two-day visit to the island, Mr
Leivers, director of lands and planning for Redland, said: ``It is not true
that we employ anyone involved with the council. I am not employing anyone who
works for the council or who represents the council.
``We have a right to employ legal people or surveyors on the island if we so
wish. As far as hospitality is concerned, I have been entertained by the
Western Isles Council for the past eight years.''
q.Redland yesterday published its ballast water management plan, which
maintained that one of the main environmental concerns about the proposed
superquarry had been answered.
The plan provides for ballast water exchanges to take place at sea in three
areas identified as environmentally acceptable. It specifies that the ballast
water tanks used at the port of origin should be different to those from which
water is discharged at the destination, and that ballast water shall not be
taken on board within 10 miles of land or from areas of recent algal blooms.
Mr Leivers said that the plan should allay fears of fishermen and others who
depended on a healthy marine environment for the livelihoods.
Mr Duncan MacInnes, secretary of the Western Isles Fishermen's Association,
said he had read the report and had not been persuaded. ``It is all very well
on paper but who is to say what is going to happen at sea in very bad weather
conditions. We are so dependent on shellfish in the islands and any poisoning
of the shellfish would be disastrous for us.''

ISRAELI prosecutors today charged the man who has admitted shooting former
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin with his murder. Yigal Amir, 25, his brother, and
a friend are to be brought before Tel Aviv District Court tomorrow to hear the
charges against all three of them.
The two alleged accomplices face charges of conspiracy to murder and illegal
possession of weapons.
The formal charge sheet says that Yigal Amir decided some time after the
September 1993 Israel-PLO peace agreement to kill Rabin in a bid to prevent its
implementation.
Amir turned to his brother, Hagai, and a friend, Dror Adani, who agreed to join
the murder plot, it says.
The three initially considered blowing up Rabin's car or firing an anti-tank
rocket into his home, according to the charges.
In the end, Yigal Amir decided to kill Rabin with his 9mm Beretta pistol and
tried to approach him at three different public appearances this year,
prosecutors allege.
On January 22 Amir waited for Rabin at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in
Jerusalem, but the Prime Minister cancelled his planned appearance after Muslim
militants set off a suicide bomb earlier in the day.
In April and September Amir was again kept away from his planned target by
security guards.
On November 4 Amir told his brother Hagai that he would try to kill Rabin at a
peace rally in Tel Aviv, the charge sheet says.
Hagai tried to tell his brother not to do it, because heavy security around the
Prime Minister would mean his chances of getting out alive after firing the
shots would be slim.
Nevertheless Yigal went ahead with his plan. He loaded his Beretta with six
regular bullets and six hollow-point bullets that had been given to him by
Hagai, according to the court papers.
Yigal left his home in a Tel Aviv suburb, took a bus to the peace rally, and
walked to where Rabin's car was parked. He waited there for about 40 minutes
for the rally to end, the prosecution says.
As Rabin walked to his car, one of his bodyguards opened the door. Rabin was
about to get in when Amir walked up and shot him three times from close range,
according to the charges.
Meanwhile in Jerusalem Israeli leaders and Rabin's family returned to his grave
today for an emotional ceremony marking the end of the Jewish 30-day period of
mourning.
New Prime Minister Shimon Peres said: ``Yitzhak, you were murdered because you
were right. You were murdered because you won.'' He told the ceremony at
Jerusalem's Mount Herzl cemetery: ``The dawn of peace has broken. No longer can
anyone extinguish it.''
Rabin's widow Leah, his son, daughter, and granddaughter Noa stood weeping
under grey skies at the ceremony attended by politicians, senior army officers,
family, and friends.
Leah Rabin shook hands with Likud opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who she
had earlier criticised as having contributed to an atmosphere of right-wing
hatred against her husband.
Other remembrance ceremonies were held in Israeli schools to honour Rabin at
the end of the Shloshim, or 30-day period, when relatives revisit the grave of
a loved one.
Rabin's grave has become a site of pilgrimage for tens of thousands of Israelis
since his murder.-AP/Reuter.

SUB-ZERO temperatures and the threat of snowfalls could mean an extension of
Rangers' Champions' League campaign, with both of the final matches in Group C
surrounded by uncertainty. Because of high winds and snow, Juventus were unable
to land at Otopeni airport yesterday to prepare for their match against Steaua
Bucharest, and although Rangers made it safely into Dortmund, their game
against Borussia could be postponed.
A UEFA delegation will inspect the playing surface of Borussia Dortmund's
Westfalen Stadium at 10am today and the likelihood is that Rangers will be
asked to return next midweek and try again.
Juventus will attempt again to arrive in Romania this morning, if the Bucharest
airport reopens, but with a few feet of snow lying on Steaua's pitch it is
unlikely that game will be given the go-ahead tonight and UEFA could instruct
them to wait until next Wednesday.
However, with more severe weather expected this week it is difficult to
envisage an improvement even a week further on. Last night, with the
temperature of -7 and falling, and several inches of snowfall expected,
Rangers' players trained on the pitch and no-one appeared comfortable.
``The surface is taking a little stud, but if conditions worsen overnight I
wouldn't like to come back tomorrow night and risk the players,'' said manager
Walter Smith, whose fears were echoed by Borussia's coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. ``If
the pitch remains hard it will be difficult for the players,'' he said, ``but
we should not put them in any danger.''
The Westfalen does not have undersoil heating, as their domestic programme goes
into winter hibernation.
It is standard procedure for UEFA to have their Champions' League pitches
inspected before every game and the Republic of Ireland's Des Casey, who is the
UEFA delegate for this tie, and match referee Manuel Diaz Vega, of Spain, will
be charged with the responsibility of passing or rejecting the Westfalen this
morning.
Champions' League official Heinz Palme said last night: ``If it is found the
pitch is not regular, then the match will be postponed.''
The safety of players will be a priority, even though the German club have sold
most of their 34,937 tickets. Also, more than 30 buses and a couple of aircraft
are expected to have deposited a large number of Rangers supporters - 2500 is
the estimate - in Dortmund by today.
There is no doubt both sides want the game to be played but the signs were not
encouraging last night. Several Rangers players slithered on the frozen surface
as they went through training manoeuvres and the captain, Richard Gough, shook
his head when asked what he thought of the pitch. ``It's very hard, very
difficult,'' he said.
Palme also pointed out that even if the pitch could be cleared, it still might
not be possible to play the game for spectator considerations, because of
building work which is under way at the ground. One of the main stands is being
extended and has no roof over the existing seating area.
Hitzfeld had hoped to deploy Karl-Heinz Riedle up front with Heiko Herrlich,
but the latter might not be risked on a treacherous surface for his first match
for six months after knee surgery. Dortmund have Julio Cesar, Matthias Sammer,
Bodo Schmidt, and Stefan Reuter doubtful because of injury and illness, while
Jurgen Kohler and Lars Ricken are suspended.
But Hitzfeld says his team will be trying to win. ``We have to try to put on a
show, because the game will be shown all over Europe,'' he pointed out. ``We
have to impress and, besides, we have our honour to look after just the same as
Rangers.'' Honour and credibility certainly are important to the Scottish
champions.
In the end, Gough found a beginning. The Rangers captain, who had started to
relish the prospect of Champions' League football ever since the day last
season when the Ibrox club secured their seventh successive premier-division
championship, has had to wrestle with doubt and criticism about the true
strength of Rangers' capabilities.
Five Group C matches and not a single win - Rangers, in fact, have collected
only two points - but Gough has been able to come to terms with the trauma
which has been Rangers' lot in Europe this season.
He believes the experience of the current Champions' League series could have a
benefit, especially for the younger members of Rangers' squad. Gough feels all
of the players, if only to accommodate their own personal pride, should want
now to work harder to win another league title and try again to deal with the
game's elite.
Armed with greater experience the players should, therefore, be better equipped
to deal with genuine football as opposed to the bustle of the premier division.
``I have had setbacks in my career, but what you go on to achieve in football
depends a great deal on how much you learn from your experiences, whether they
be good or bad,'' he said on arrival in Germany yesterday.
``We did have a lot of problems because of injuries, but we found also that we
were not good enough this time.
``It is important for professional players to want always to measure themselves
against the very best and with the correct attitudes and enough good fortune,
which every team must have, we could do more next time.''
Gordan Petric is suspended for tonight's game, but Smith's only problem is
whether to use Craig Moore, Gary Bollan, or John Brown as cover for Petric if,
indeed, the manager wishes to persevere here with his three-man central
defensive system.
``I felt we did enough against Dortmund to have won the match at Ibrox,'' Gough
added, ``and we played reasonably well defensively against Steaua Bucharest in
Romania, even though we lost that match, but this last game should be regarded
as a learning process.''
Rangers' recent premier-division form has been impressive and Paul Gascoigne
has been looking more like the player Smith thought he was buying during the
close season. If the English internationalist, who has only threatened so far
in the Champions' League, can produced his best against Borussia, then anything
might be possible, although the belief that Rangers could end the campaign on a
high would be reinforced if Brian Laudrup treats everyone to his full
repertoire.
``He has had an awkward time because of an ankle injury, but I thought he
played his best stuff in the last half-hour of the match at Tynecastle last
Saturday, which might mean Brian is getting close to full match fitness,'' said
Smith, who added that he has no new injury problems. ``I would like to see a
similar performance to the one in the second half of the game against Borussia
at Ibrox.
``I think after the problems we have had, I am probably better placed now with
regard to team selection than at any time previously in the Champions' League.
We may have reached a point where the players are ready now to give a better
account of themselves in Europe.''

INTERNATIONAL referees in the Northern Hemisphere are on the brink of joining
their southern counterparts with match fees whenever they officiate in Test
matches, writes Derek Douglas.
South African referee Tappa Henning, who officiated at the Scotland v Western
Samoa game at Murrayfield last month, received, it is understood, a substantial
fee from the South African union. At a Five Nations' committee meeting next
week, Northern Hemisphere unions will be urged to fall into line.
Sums of #1000 a match for referees and #500 apiece for touchjudges are being
mooted in some quarters, but SRU International Board representative Alan Hosie,
who convenes the SRU referees' committee, said those figures were probably wide
of the mark.
If the new deal for officials goes through next week then the first Scottish
beneficiaries will be Jim Fleming, Ray Megson and Kenny McCartney, who were in
charge of the England match with South Africa at Twickenham last month. Any
payments sanctioned would be retrospective.
Yesterday Megson, who refereed the first of his nine major internationals in
1987, said: ``It has to happen. You can't put amateurs out on the pitch with
professionals and especially so when, nowadays, you have #20m worth of bums
sitting on seats.''

DETECTIVES investigating a man's disappearance believe he has been murdered.
The body of Roderick Campbell has not been found but police have taken the
unusual step of reporting a 28-year-old Greenock man to the procurator-fiscal
in connection with his disappearance.
Mr Campbell, 21, of Gladsmuir Road, Hillington, Glasgow, disappeared 15 days
ago after a night out with friends.
He left them in Kelhead Drive, Penilee, telling them he was going home because
he was feeling unwell, and was not seen again.
A week later, police launched an appeal for help, saying they were ``becoming
increasingly concerned'' about Mr Campbell, who was 6ft 2in and slim. When last
seen, he was wearing a bomber jacket and jeans.
A few days ago, the search switched to the Greenock area after police at Govan
received information in connection with their search.
Last night, a Strathclyde Police spokesman said: ``We do not know the
whereabouts of Mr Campbell but, based on information we have received, we are
convinced he is dead.''
The investigation is now being headed by Greenock-based Detective Chief
Inspector John Sherry.
A spokesman for the Crown Office said: ``Although it is unusual for someone to
be reported to the fiscal in a case where there is no body, it is not
unprecedented. It has happened in the past and there have been convictions in
cases where the body has never been found.''

THERE was no comment from Buckingham Palace officials last night on a meeting
between the Queen and John Major, at which the future role of the Princess of
Wales was discussed.
Senior palace aides met the princess last week for talks following her
controversial Panorama interview, in which she said she wanted to become a
roving ambassador for Britain.
The talks, held at the palace last Wednesday, were part of a continuing
dialogue which will involve consultations with other members of the royal
family and the Government.
The palace is keen to stress that the dialogue with Diana is amicable and
constructive.
However, some leading politicians have expressed growing concern about her
desire to be a roving ambassador, questioning her ambassadorial skills.
The agenda for Mr Major's ``routine'' weekly audience with the Queen last night
was confidential, but it was thought unlikely that the princess's future would
not be addressed.
The Prime Minister has come under renewed pressure from dissenting MPs,
believed to have supporters within the Cabinet, to limit the princess to a
charity role abroad.
No-one should expect a solution from a one-off meeting.
Talks with the princess will produce ideas and options which, when defined more
precisely, will have to be dove-tailed with the work of other royals and with
Government priorities in foreign policy.
But the indications are that, whatever her future commitments, the princess
will now develop her public role.
There will be those at the palace, however, eager to point out that she is not
the only royal ambassador. Indeed, it could be argued that all members of the
royal family are ambassadors for Britain.
Diana also expressed her desire on BBC1's Panorama to be a ``queen of hearts''
among ordinary people, to give affection and ``light in their dark tunnels''.
But no one member of the royal family - however aggrieved - can expect to
monopolise popularity, or the public's high esteem.
Such a claim would ignore the high standing and status of the Queen and the
Queen Mother, to name but two well-loved senior royals, who go about their
public business each day without fanfares.
q The princess's Panorama interview was the most watched television programme
this year, drawing nearly 23 million viewers, according to official figures
yesterday.
The hour-long special was also BBC TV's third-highest rated programme since
BARB ratings were introduced 14 years ago.

ABOUT 50 firefighters were early this morning still fighting a major blaze in
the old Queen's Park Secondary School in the south side of Glasgow.
Strathclyde Police said Prospecthill Road and Grange Road were closed to
traffic for several hours after the fire was reported at 6.50pm. Eight fire
engines and two other units with turntable ladders attended the blaze in the
building which is understood to be derelict.
The building ceased operating as a school in the early 1970s. Strathclyde
region used part of it as a teacher training centre until 1990. The Victoria
Infirmary, which is nearby, also used part until recently as a computer
training centre.
Strathclyde Fire Brigade said early this morning that the blaze was under
control. It is understood that one possible cause being considered is a dropped
light.

<TEXT>
COUNCIL taxpayers could face a bill of nearly #50 a household next year to bail
out a troubled shopping centre in Falkirk.
The Callendar Square centre is still less than half full two years after
opening. Interest charges and running costs are likely to mean the equivalent
of almost #12 a household for Central region council taxpayers in the current
financial year.
Members of the region's development committee will be warned today that
attracting a major new tenant could cost more than #1.5m in ``sweeteners''.
Unless a deal is struck before April, the 57,000 householders in the area
covered by the new Falkirk unitary council could face a bill of more than
#2.75m - equivalent to #48 a household on the council tax.
Central region's problems with Callendar Square date from 1990 when the
Labour-controlled authority agreed to underwrite a #12m rescue of the
development after builders Rush and Tompkins went into receivership.
In 1993, with the centre still unfinished, the council was forced to raise its
underwriting to #13m.
In a confidential report to a meeting of the region's development and planning
committee today, development director Geoff Peart warns: ``The council will
have to consider further significant loan assistance if the letting position
doesn't improve to the extent necessary to attract bank funding.''
Councillors will be told they face a stark choice: Continue pouring large sums
into the centre or go for liquidation, which could involve coughing up the full
#13m guarantee.
Falkirk SNP leader David Alexander said last night: ``It's obvious the burden's
going to fall on Falkirk ratepayers. We're simply being handed a white
elephant.''
Mr Bill Dickson, head of corporate finance at Central region, said: ``The level
of retail space occupied can only improve if additional capital funds are made
available. It is in the interests of the regional council and the new Falkirk
Council to secure new tenancies.''

<HEADLINE>SRU call Sole to account as referee row escalates</HEADLINE>

DAVID Sole is to provide the Scottish Rugby Union with a ``full and detailed''
written response to the charge of bringing the game into disrepute which
followed his criticism of a match referee whose performance he likened to
``tantamount to cheating''.
As the affair threatened to get out of hand with international referee Ray
Megson stating that he would not officiate at any further Edinburgh
Academicals' games until the matter had been resolved, Sole declared: ``I have
received a letter from the SRU seeking my comments and I will provide them with
a full and detailed response.''
Megson, who is acting in a personal capacity but who mirrors widespread anger
within the refereeing fraternity, has also called for the formation of a
referees' federation, divorced from the SRU, which would represent referees,
who, he believes, are grossly undervalued and mistreated.
Sole, who coaches Academicals' forwards, made his remarks after a string of
penalties awarded against his side by Kelso referee Colin Henderson led to an
injury-time defeat by Melrose and ultimate relegation.
The former Scotland captain had been summoned to Murrayfield to explain his
reported comments but was unable to attend because he was babysitting. A second
hearing had been proposed for December 14 but Sole cannot attend then either
and instead will provide a written response.
He said: ``Contrary to what many people seem to think, I am treating this
matter seriously and it probably would not be wise to comment further other
than to say that I will acquiesce with the union's request to provide them with
my account of what took place.''
Yesterday, Megson, an Edinburgh lawyer, said: ``Enough is enough. This was a
high-profile former player who basically accused a referee of cheating. Well,
this is a high-profile referee who is saying that this is unacceptable and that
the matter should have been dealt with before now.
``I'm acting here as an individual. This has nothing to do with the SRU. They
have done all they can. But if this is the stance that David Sole wants to take
and, apparently, with the backing of his club, then I am not going to referee
them in those circumstances,'' said Megson.
``You should see the absolute shit that is flung at referees these days. We are
constantly trying to recruit new referees. What do you think these kind of
comments do for that recruitment campaign?
``You can call me incompetent, you can say that Megson didn't have a
particularly good game, but you can't call me a cheat. I can tell you that if
it had been me and not Colin Henderson that was involved then we would be
talking about more than not refereeing Accies' games.''
SRU referees' convener Alan Hosie said: ``We are still awaiting David's
response to the committee so it would probably be best to say nothing. However,
I want to make it plain, too, that we will give Colin Henderson all the support
he would expect. We have told the Border Referees' Association this and they
seem happy enough with that at the moment.
``I would have hoped, though, that we would not be getting into this situation.
I'm disappointed to hear that Ray has decided to take this action and I
certainly don't want to further inflame the situation.
``Until such time as we have heard from David it would be wrong of the union to
prejudice the situation.''
Edinburgh Academicals' media spokesman Magnus Moodie, another Edinburgh laywer,
said last night: ``David still has our complete confidence and we wish that
third parties would not interfere while it is being handled by the SRU. If this
had happened to one of Ray Megson's clients then I am sure he would have been
up in arms protesting about interference with due process.''

CELTIC Football Club yesterday received planning permission for a temporary
stand which has already been built on the site of the former west terracing at
Celtic Park.
The planning consent, awarded by district councillors, will run until June
1997, if a safety certificate is granted today by Strathclyde region's sub
committee on safety at sports grounds.
A district council sub-committee on development control was asked to consider
``a proposal'' for the erection of temporary uncovered spectators' seated
accommodation, with a capacity of 2955.
Celtic had indicated it wished the temporary structure to be used for the
remainder of the current football season.
However, in order to accommodate any possible delays in the phased
redevelopment of Celtic Park, the club had requested that planning permission
be granted for a temporary period up to June 1997.
The sub-committee, chaired by Councillor Robert Rooney - who asked if the
application was retrospective and was told that it was - was told by an
official that, although it was retrospective, the stand was not being used.
Celtic wanted to use the stand several weeks ago to satisfy ticket demand for
the European Cup Winners' Cup tie with Paris St Germain, but were denied a
safety certificate.
On the nature of the application, Celtic public relations officer Peter McLean
said: ``Our consultants contacted the appropriate authorities and asked if it
would be acceptable for Celtic to proceed with building in advance of receiving
permisson, considering the nature of the construction.
``They were told this was quite common practice, although they could give no
guarantee that the stand would be given planning permission.''

Colombo, Tuesday
TAMIL Tiger rebels launched an attack on an eastern military base in Sri Lanka
today after the army raised the national flag over the rebels' former northern
stronghold of Jaffna.
The rebels tried to ram a van packed with explosives into a Special Task Force
police camp near Kalmunai in the Batticaloa district, but it blew up at the
gate killing a sentry and police commandos inflicted heavy casualties on
guerrillas.
Before the attack, Sri Lanka's armed forces raised the national flag over the
captured rebel stronghold of Jaffna, symbolically ending nearly a decade of
control over the town by the Tigers.
The Tigers, who have not admitted the fall of its citadel, said they were
continuing to fight. Their Voice of Tigers radio announced a major recruitment
drive and urged people to enlist to stop the army ``before it was too late''.
The flag-raising ceremony capped the government's seven-week offensive on
Jaffna, the army's biggest assault in 12 years of civil war.
An estimated 400 soldiers were killed in seven weeks of fighting, while the
military says its troops killed 1925 rebels and wounded more than 5000 on the
march towards the rebel citadel.-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Bottom-club Kilmarnock have Pittodrie mission Totten wants his side to start going up in the world</HEADLINE>

HE was once very much involved in Rangers matters, but Alex Totten will be one
of a considerable minority who will be far more concerned with the happenings
at Pittodrie tonight than the fate of the Ibrox club in Dortmund. The
Kilmarnock manager has travelled a fair distance in his career since he was
assistant to Jock Wallace, but is still regarded as one of the country's best
tacticians.
His team have had a hesitant opening period in the premier division, so
uncertain, in fact, that they are currently at the bottom, but Totten has
demonstrated on more than one occasion that he has the mettle to overcome this
kind of adversity.
``If we win, we come off the bottom,'' he said, ``and who needs any greater
incentive?''
Aberdeen might argue that securing a victory after having lost immediately
following their Coca-Cola Cup final victory is decent enough incentive for
themselves, especially as they are a long way behind in the title race. In
fact, their manager, Roy Aitken, sees this game as the first of three
opportunities to re-establish his team's position as formidable opponents at
Pittodrie.
Aitken, who has seen his side win only one of their last seven league games, is
aiming to recreate the same intimidating scenario at home as used to be the
norm in the eighties, to resurrect their championship hopes.
Said the manager, who has three home matches in succession beginning tonight:
``We are determined to become a force again at Pittodrie just like a decade ago.
``Then teams knew they would be in for a hard game here, but if they are coming
up confident then there is something wrong. The only way we will gain respect
is by doing the business on the park.
``We have played well before our own fans without getting the right results. I
am looking for my players to be more ruthless and push themselves harder to
turn performances into the wins we want.
``This is our first game at Pittodrie since winning the Coca-Cola Cup. Our
supporters will be out in their thousands to give us the lift needed going into
a vital period.''
Sweeper Gary Smith will be captain in the absence of the suspended Stewart
McKimmie. Dean Windass, the #700,000 buy from Hull City, will make his home
debut.
Stephen Glass and Eoin Jess have recovered from injuries but internationalist
Scott Booth is again ruled out with a thigh strain.
Totten recognises the threat an Aberdeen side aiming to avoid three successive
defeats will pose, but he has to take a positive approach.
``We have played well in a lot of games but not got the results we deserved,''
he said, ``and we did well against Aberdeen last season. In fact we won four
out of four but they have already beaten us this season.
``We showed for 40 minutes at Parkhead that we can be as good as anyone, but we
have to maintain our concentration all the way through.''
The Rugby Park lot will have much the same line-up as the one that took a
two-goal lead at Parkhead before being caught and passed.
q FIFA have announced that the draw for the qualifying competition of the 1998
World Cup would go ahead in Paris next week despite the wave of strikes in
France.
Football's governing body issued a statement yesterday stating the draw would
take place as scheduled at the Louvre on Tuesday amid fears the strikes could
cause a postponement.
q DUNDEE United have transferred the Brazilian, Sergio, to Kuwait Sporting Club
for an undisclosed fee. The striker was signed at the start of the year in a
#300,000 deal from Portuguese football.
q RAITH Rovers will find out next week how much they will receive for Jason
Rowbotham. The defender moved to Wycombe Wanderers under freedom of contract,
and the clubs have been unable to agree a fee.
q BERWICK were last night in signing talks with former Meadowbank keeper Jim
McQueen after he came to their rescue on Saturday. McQueen, who has just
completed a three-month deal with Clyde, stepped in for Berwick in their one
goal defeat by East Fife.
Berwick manager Tom Hendrie got in touch with McQueen after having received
news that keeper Neil Young had been involved in a car accident.

THERE has been a major transformation at Triplex Lloyd over the last two years.
In the half year to September, operating profit jumped 57% to #5.92m and if a
goodwill write-off which is a non-cash item is ignored, then the uplift at the
pre-tax level was 91%.
The impetus came from the power division, where margins jumped from 5.1% to
8.5%. That reflected the elimination of #600,000 losses at Firth Vickers.
Also helping were good performances from Deritend and the Paralloy subsidiary.
Automotive benefited from high sales to Perkins.
However, the performance was partially spoilt by maintenance problems in the
summer, but chairman Colin Cooke was unable to say how much these cost. He
bought 35,000 shares yesterday.
The current half will benefit from the #5m sale of part of the Birmingham
property, which could release a #1m profit.
Full-year profit seems likely to improve from #8.3m to almost #11m. That would
leave the shares at 143p trading at 11 times possible earnings, while yielding
6.1% on the basis of a maintained 7p total dividend.

HOME Secretary Michael Howard won a major legal victory yesterday when the
Court of Appeal vindicated his decision to increase the minimum period a double
killer must spend in prison.
Three appeal judges overturned a landmark decision in the High Court last month
when Mr Justice Turner strongly criticised the Home Secretary and said he had
wrongly agreed to increase the term from 15 to 20 years.
John Pierson, who shot his sleeping mother and father at their remote farmhouse
near Oswestry, Shropshire, in September 1984, received a double life sentence
for the killings, described as ``horrifying and apparently motiveless''.
The trial judge and the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane, recommended that
the ``tariff'' Pierson must serve for retribution and deterrence should be set
at 15 years.
However, Pierson, who protested his innocence at his trial at Chester Crown
Court in July 1985, was told in August 1993 that the Home Secretary had
increased his minimum sentence to 20 years.
Pierson successfully challenged in the High Court Mr Howard's decision in May
last year that the 20-year tariff should stand. Mr Justice Turner said the Home
Secretary had ``failed to measure up to the required standard of fairness''.
That judgment was hailed as a landmark ruling because of its apparent impact on
many other cases in which Mr Howard had increased minimum sentences for lifers.
Yesterday, Sir Thomas Bingham, the Master of the Rolls, together with Lord
Justice Neill and Lord Justice Hirst, set aside Mr Justice Turner's ruling and
said that the Home Secretary's decision to increase the sentence could not be
``stigmatised as irrational''.
The appeal judges stressed in their judgment that they were not concerned
whether Pierson should serve 15 or 20 years and they had no part to play in
making that decision.
``It is none of our business and we have no views on the subject. Nor are we in
any way called upon to consider the allocation of sentencing powers between the
executive and the judiciary. That again is none of our business.
``We are concerned, and concerned only, to rule upon the lawfulness of the
decision.''
They also made clear that the case was not a challenge to the Home Secretary
personally.
Mr Justice Turner had held that ``exceptional circumstances'' would be needed
before the Home Secretary could increase a period of imprisonment and said it
would be unfair to lengthen Pierson's term.
Yesterday's judgment said: ``The Home Secretary in 1994 did not share the view
of his predecessor in 1988 that the 15-year penal term recommended by the
judges would have been appropriate but for the aggravating features. He thought
a longer term was called for anyway.
``The existence of an earlier decision with which the Home Secretary in 1994
did not agree did not in our judgment make his later decision irrational,
whether or not that decision is open to challenge on other grounds.''
The judges said the Home Secretary had done no more than indicate that the
power to increase a penal term would be exercised only in exceptional
circumstances.
They said that there was nothing in law to stop a Home Secretary from
increasing a sentence if he believed it did not adequately meet the needs of
retribution and deterrence.
The judges also said that it was open for Pierson to make representations to
the Home Secretary and they trusted Mr Howard would give ``fair and careful
consideration'' to any pleas.

BTHE community voice of Wester Hailes, on the west side of Edinburgh, was
commended yesterday as a role model in the regeneration of Britain's worst
housing estates.
In a strategy devised by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the estate's
representative council is praised as a ``good example'' of how local people can
find an important voice in their neighbourhood - and a say in the redevelopment
of their area.
By working in partnership with other agencies, the area's representative
council has participated in the redevelopment of the sprawling housing estate,
which boasts one of the highest unemployment rates in the capital.
A foundation spokesman said the Wester Hailes group had been singled out
because residents could easily have a say in their future.
``The Wester Hailes Representative Council is a good example to other estates
all over the UK of how local people can work in partnership to improve their
community,'' a foundation spokesman said.
The estate forms part of a #1.5m research programme, focusing on 100 of the
poorest housing estates in Britain in a bid to devise a 20-year strategy for
refurbishment.
It is the only Scottish area to be featured in a video accompanying the plan,
which was launched in London yesterday.
The report's author, Ms Marilyn Taylor, of the University of Brighton, said a
national initiative was needed to counteract low income, unemployment, and
increasing demand on welfare services which have hampered previous programmes.
The call for an action plan for Britain's most deprived housing estates was
backed yesterday by the chairwoman of the Wester Hailes council. The council,
which speaks for its 11,000 residents, was set up in 1982 from a former
tenants' association.
A decade later, it was restructured to increase accountability to the people it
represented.
Chairwoman Lynne Main said it was changed to take 27 representatives from local
neighbourhood forums. Its aims and intentions were formerly stated in the
so-called Pitlochry declaration, a short time before the partnership initiative
for the area swung into action.
The council has battled for many of the changes on the estate but says much
remains to be tackled to overcome poverty and unemployment. Unemployment is
running at an average of just less than 20% - double the figure for Edinburgh
as a whole.
Ms Main, 38, who has lived in Wester Hailes for 26 years, said the group
realised at an early stage it had to get people involved in order to be
successful.
``The only real way to get people involved in any great initiative is to speak
to them face to face,'' Ms Main said. ``People tend not to take notice of
leaflets or information.
She attributes the success of the council to ``elected democracy'' and a
sophisticated consultation process.
With a #500,000 funding package from urban aid, the Scottish Office, and local
authorities, the council is also able to access vital professional training and
information, enabling it to argue its case on a par with professionals in local
authorities and the Wester Hailes Partnership.
``Each door in Wester Hailes is knocked at least once every year,'' Ms Main
said. ``Neighbourhoods are regularly surveyed to find out what they want. We
decide what the issues affecting us are and elect a spokesperson.''
Welcoming the Rowntree recommendation, she said: ``I think that all the talk
from the Government about community involvement addressing decision-making is
very encouraging reading. We've been doing that for 20 years in Wester Hailes,
where we've been trying to get more control of budgets and decision making and
get local people involved.
``You must get the community involved. It does not spring up overnight. It
takes much hard work and commitment and a lot of money.''

The Whitbread leisure and brewing group has made a highly imaginative move with
the plan to develop the former Greater London Council building at Westminster
into a Travel Inn budget hotel with some 318 bedrooms.
That will be aimed chiefly at Eurostar passengers using the nearby Waterloo
Eurostar terminus. Also on the County Hall site, it will develop a 200 room
four-star Marriott hotel. Together they will cost some #30m.
This will be in co-operation with the Shirayama Corporation of Japan which
bought the redundant building for #60m in 1992.

THE ever confident Barrie Stephens repeated yesterday that engineering giant
Siebe had continued on target after half-year pre-tax profits jumped 20.6% to
#144m on a sales gain of 18.6% to #1200m.
He added that the two control divisions achieved record levels of sales and
operating profits, and the investment and restructuring at diversified products
was delivering increased sales and profits. The order book stands at a record
#770m.
Siebe, which is Britain's biggest diversified engineering group incorporating
more than 125 companies across the world, is increasing the interim dividend
10% to 4.44p.
The group's American businesses were affected by a reduced house-building
programme and a cut-back in vehicle production. Siebe shares jumped 29p to 768p.
