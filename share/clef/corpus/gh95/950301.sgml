OF all the fixtures that Murray Dawson will leave behind with
reluctance when he moves house, the tiles in his kitchen are obviously
going to cause particular regret.
''I shall definitely have to get some more for our new home,'' he says
wistfully.
It's easy to see why he is so attached to them. Chosen after
considerable searching, they are from Provence; Murray knows even the
exact village workshop.
You would expect two working artists to pay particular attention to
the colour and light in their home, and this delightful conversion in
Glencart House on the edge of Kilbarchan lives up to every expectation.
The elegant white painted villa is surrounded by gardens and looks
down over the Black Cart river. In the summer the outlook is idyllic,
with the water edged by horse chestnut trees.
Built in 1853 by the renowned architect Alexander Kirkland, the villa
has been divided into three homes, with the Dawsons' front door to the
back of the house where the main door faces the river below.
The large dining room is clearly a focal point where visitors gather
round a long pine table. The adjoining kitchen is divided by a wall, but
a wide open serving area between the two rooms means the cook doesn't
need to feel excluded.
The kitchen is a mix of traditional and new with a pine plate rack by
the sink and old pine shelves above smart modern grey cupboards and
units.
The French tiles are in earth shades of brown and grey blue. A dairy
in Kilmacolm was the source of the large old marble slab that forms its
work surface. The floor has been stripped and the natural wood
varnished.
The hallway has been covered in a hessian paper in a warm biscuit
shade which is perfect for displaying the Dawsons' many pictures and
ceramics. A huge window floods the walls with light.
The main sitting room looks over the river and like most of the other
rooms has its original shutters at the window. The main fireplace has a
simple wood surround which frames a set of old sepia and white Victorian
tiles. A real coal fire can be laid in the grate, though the gas central
heating means this treat can can be saved for special occasions.
The main bedroom at the back of the house looks across the fields to
nearby Kilbarchan and to the hills beyond, but the best place to view
the distant stretches of countryside is from the large studio above.
Formerly an attic, much of the top floor has been converted into a
stunning room with four huge Velux windows and a varnished pine floor.
While it is currently used as a light and airy studio, this spacious
room could be used for all kinds of activites from a gym to a pool room.
It would certainly make the most luxurious master bedroom, and there
is a handy shower room next door with striking Laura Ashley wallpaper.
Next to it is the second bedroom, with a bird's eye view of the river.
There is a shower room on this floor too, again with striking Laura
Ashley wall paper. The beautiful central wooden stair case is not
original, but it was specially designed to blend with the period details
in the house, while its natural timbers make it a stylish contemporary
addition.
The stair leading up to the house from the lower entrance hall is
original. There is a mosaic tiled floor in the entrance vestibule as
well as cornicing and etched glass in the storm doors. Just about
everything, you might say, to delight anyone who enjoys the best of
classic design in a quiet riverside setting.

FRANCE's famed Riviera has two fairly short stretches of sandy beach
on 70 miles of coastline. In East Lothian, you can set off eastward from
North Berwick and follow the beach round bay after unspoilt bay for 16
miles to Aberlady. What's more, the sea is much less polluted than the
Med off the Riviera, and there are no ugly developments to spoil the
view. Add to that one of the best sunshine records and lowest rainfalls
in Britain, and all that's needed is a bit of global warming and well,
on second thoughts, let's keep the sangria and discos away from this
royal burgh which has been host to discerning holidaymakers and golfers
since the nineteenth century.
The town is flanked by two bays with a rocky headland in between. The
working harbour is surrounded by warehouses converted into flats and
there is the time warp of the open-air swimming pool embedded in the
rock. Next year time will catch up with the famous pool, which will
close to be replaced at the back of the town by a leisure pool next to
the sports centre.
There are two other famous volcanic rocks North Berwick Law and the
Bass Rock. The Law offers steep walks to the summit and the Napoleonic
watchtower, First World War buildings and an arch made from the jawbone
of a whale. The Bass Rock, which lies off shore, has been home to a
prison, lighthouse, castle, fugitives and now is a bird sanctuary
popular with gannets. Boat trips run out to the rock.
Near the harbour lie the ruins of the twelfth-century Auld Kirk where
the 'Devil', Francis, Earl of Bothwell, and local witches got up to some
nasty goings-on to shipwreck the boat carrying James VI. Many of the
wreckers were tortured and tried for their misdeeds, as their spell
failed to kill the king.
A more savoury ritual than the Auld Kirk stirrings is the arrival in
the town of visitors on day trips or for summer holidays. Others own
holiday flats or weekend cottages in the town, and there's a large
number of guest houses.
What is less well known is that North Berwick is a brilliant place to
live all year round. As Roderick Dyce, sales negotiator at DTZ Debenham
Thorpe and a former resident says: 'It's surprising more people don't
want to move to North Berwick, given the improved facilities and road
and rail links. The hourly train service takes around 30 minutes to the
centre of Edinburgh quicker than trying to get in from west of the city,
say Barnton, and enduring the nightmare of Forth Bridge traffic.'
Robin Murray, solicitor at Barlas &amp; Sharpe, says; 'North Berwick is as
nice a place as Ayr, possible better, as new developments have not been
as large-scale. The A1 improvements and the added links to Glasgow mean
we should see benefits in road safety and reduced journey times.' North
Berwick is a good place to bring up children if you want a bigger house,
better garden and numerous leisure facilities.
According to the new league tables, North Berwick High School is one
of the best in Britain. The harbour is a watersports centre and the East
Lothian Yacht Club has a strong membership. There are two wonderful
beaches, one with a paddling pool. There's a sports centre, off Grange
Road, and local tennis, swimming, rugby and golf clubs are thriving.
The town has two links courses, East Glen Golf Club and West Tantallon
Golf Club,      and the world famous Muirfield course is nearby. In the
town centre there are good independent shops and a Presto supermarket.
In the hinterland there are attractive villages such as Athelstaneford
and Drem, and an open -air market and flying club at East Fortune.
Marjorie Lamb, at Garden Haig, a local resident originally from
Glasgow, says: 'North Berwick is very residential, mostly families and a
lot of retired. People from Edinburgh, Glasgow and the South who fondly
remember childhood holidays in North Berwick choose to retire here for
the fresh air, sea views and small-town atmosphere. There are a number
of specially built retirement flats and nursing homes such as on
Dirleton Avenue. The town has a population of only about 5000. Rose
Newman, sales director at Stewart Saunders, says: 'A lot of people's
first thought is of the healthy, if at times chilly, air of North
Berwick when they think of retiring.'
However, it is not a place for the first-time buyer, as a small
one-bedroom flat costs A36,500, and these are in short supply. House
prices are on a par with Edinburgh.
There is a choice of property ranging up to white mansions in the
sought-after West End area at Dirleton Avenue, Strathearn Road and
Abbotsford Road. New-build includes the Lord President estate by Walker
Homes, four and five-bedroom detached by Cala from A150,000, and luxury
bungalows built in villa grounds behind the stone walls and copper beech
hedges.
Rita McVey, sales consultant at Barlas &amp; Sharpe, says: 'We have
recently sold 20 houses by Tantallon Homes which were very keenly priced
from A75,000-A105,000 for three-bedroom detached with garage.'
An unchanging way of life as well as its superb natural amenities is
what makes North Berwick special. Let's hope the lager louts and the
sangria louts  never find it.

In the spring, a young designer's thoughts lightly turn to autumn . .
. but what do they wear meantime? Francesca Fearon has been finding out
THERE is always excitement tinged with nerves when the new season's
collections arrive in the stores. It is the acid test for designers and
buyers -- have they predicted the mood of the fashion-conscious
correctly? They designed and bought these collections more than six
months ago and are already thinking ahead to next autumn. However, what
have these arbiters of style chosen to wear themselves this spring, and
what has been dispatched from the wardrobe to make way for it? We got
the gen from those in the know:
* Lucille Lewin -- designer/retailer, Whistles.
''I will throw away my two short skirts which don't look right any
more, but I will hang on madly to bias-cut skirts. My favourite look is
the knee-length dress and matching coat in pastels, preferably in pale
pink. It smacks of Jackie Onassis, looking slightly sporty and very
elegant. I've just got my hair bobbed absolutely right for the look, and
I will slip on high heels or strappy cork-soled shoes which look quite
modern, then paint my toenails bright red.''
* Amanda Wakeley -- designer.
''I'm ruthless with my wardrobe and keep just a few favourite jackets
and trousers from previous collections, but often working in my shop
customers want to buy what I'm wearing. I have ordered two navy jackets
-- one edge-to-edge and belted with a skinny cord, 'very now' and one
split up the back -- which I would wear with either tailored trousers or
soft satin chiffon ones. For evening I would wear the black crepe
slipper dress slashed across the middle.''
* Yasmin Yusuf -- design director, Warehouse.
''I love all this retro for summer, it looks smart, but is really
comfortable. However, I love shoes before anything else and buy three
pairs of Manolo Blahnik's at a time. I'm getting rid of everything long
or grey and pulling out my pearl-buttoned cashmere twinsets to wear with
a floaty printed satin skirt. I always mix Warehouse clothes with
designer things, so I'll put slim linen capri pants with either a
cap-sleeve knit or my Gaultier and Azzedine Alaia tops. The Jackie O
suiting is smart, although softened by the pastel colours which don't
always suit me, but I can pick it out in black, red, and white later
on.''
* Nicole Farhi -- designer.
''My favourite item is my jeans, which I wear all the time. In fact I
never really get rid of anything because fashion is so cyclical and many
looks come round again. However, from my spring collection I am taking
the white cotton cricket cardigan, trimmed in navy, which I will wear
with trousers or jeans.''
* Linda Lawrence -- co-owner, Ichi Ni San, Glasgow.
''For spring I want a T-shirt and jacket by Acupuncture. The jacket is
mannish, cut narrow on the shoulder, which I will wear over a dress or
tailored pants. However, I'll wear my favourite covet coat by Squire and
re-cycled cashmere jumpers by Fake until May. I'd also like Antoni &amp;
Alison's T-shirts, the acid-coloured ones by Free and a pair of silver
snakeskin hipsters by Modzart. But I don't want to look like an Italian
bimbo so I'll add a short-sleeved boys' shirt to it.''
* Patricia Davidson -- owner, Kingshill Mail Order.
''Black, black, and black with a sprinkling of beige is my favourite
winter colour and I still like the masculine shapes. I don't throw out
much as I don't buy much. Out goes anything that was cheap and not
brilliant. When I'm working with clothes all day I like mine to stay
neutral so they won't distract the eye when I'm buying for the
catalogue. Fortunately I have the pick of the warehouse, so for spring I
will wear Paul Costelloe's Jacquard mandarin jacket with slim trousers
-- it's so feminine. There is a marvellous Caroline Charles navy crepe
dress and an exclusive navy wool crepe Amanda Wakeley jacket with a cord
that I love.''
* Anne Good -- owner, Moon, Glasgow.
''I've gone off shirts with collars and jeans, which I don't wear any
more. After working at Moon for more than six years I've become more
tailored to wearing trouser suits and will never get rid of a Ralph
Lauren one trimmed with brown velvet. I'd love the new Indian Jacquard
jacket from Christian Lacroix's Bazar collection, Betty Jackson's knits,
and John Rocha's beautiful pin-striped jacket. There is a strapless
chiffon bra-top dress which I'd love to float around it, but that may be
wishful dreaming.''
* Sue Rowe -- designer.
''Out go all of those A-line minis and a gold shirt, which I don't
want to see again -- or at least not until next winter. However, I'll
save my long bias-cut aubergine satin skirt, which will look great with
a new lilac camisole. From my own collection I fancy a bright floral
georgette blouse which can be worn with either a bias-cut or satin
pencil knee-length skirt, strappy reptile sandals and painted toenails.
It will look really sexy.''

Scotland's housing market is being overly influenced by excessive
concentration on the lack of the feel-good factor, according to the
TSB's quarterly price index report.
It says: ''Scottish economic fundamentals should inspire confidence
rather than gloom. Economic growth is vigorous and unemployment is lower
than the UK level and falling. Exports are flourishing while inward
investment is strong.''
AVERAGE house prices in Scotland fell by 2.1% in the three months to
the end of January, according to the TSB's quarterly price index.
However, the index is still showing an increase of 2.3% on the same
quarter a year ago.
The index is adjusted for changes in geographic area, property type
and proportion of first-time buyers. Autumn and winter months often
display price falls which reverse some of the gains made in spring and
summer.
First-time buyers accounted for 37% of transactions, compared to 39%
in the previous quarter and 42% in the same quarter one year ago.
''Despite favourable economic conditions and affordable houses,
first-time buyers are delaying entering the market,'' says the report.
The index also reveals changes in the types of houses changing hands
at the moment compared with four years. In 1990, flats accounted for 50%
of transactions in Scotland, but by 1994 this had fallen to 36%. In
contrast, detached properties now take 22% of transactions compared to
just 12% four years ago.
Semi-detached properties have lifted their share by 6% while terraced
properties have declined from 18% to 16% of the transactions.

IN the current patchy market, builders have to treat different parts
of Scotland in different ways if they are to achieve the sales they
need.
After introducing a fixed rate mortgage earlier this year, Tay Homes
has seen increased activity at its three Ayrshire developments.
After carrying out its own research into the rather sluggish Ayrshire
market, the house builder introduced a fixed-rate mortgage of 4.95%
specific to new home buyers at both the company's Kilmarnock
developments, Meadowbrook and The Craigs, and its Kilwinning development
at Woodend Meadows.
The 4.95% level fixed to January 1997 is 1% less than the standard
fixed rate offered at a number of Tay Homes' developments elsewhere in
Scotland.
''The results are testament to the fact that new home buyers have
different priorities which often vary by the area in which they are
buying,'' says Iain Stewart, Tay Homes' sales director.
''It is important that we meet the specific needs of new home buyers,
and our recent research amongst buyers and potential buyers in Ayrshire
has allowed us to focus on the security factor that a fixed rate
mortgage currently offers.''
At Meadowbrook in Kilmarnock two detached show homes, each with four
bedrooms, have opened. The final phase of three and four-bedroom
detached homes has also been released for sale and prices range from
#69,500 to #95,000.
The Craigs, also in Kilmarnock, is offering a range of house styles
from two-bedroom bungalows (priced from #62,000) to four-bedroom
detached homes priced from #91,500. In Kilwinning, Woodend Meadows has
entered the fourth phase of new house building and 11 homes are
currently for sale.
Three-bedroom, semi-detached homes priced #64,500 and #65,000, and
detached homes priced between #69,750 and #75,000 are currently on
offer, plus a number of four-bedroom properties selling for between
#80,000 and #86,000.

THOUSANDS of properties at home and abroad will be crammed under the
one roof at the SECC at the end of this month. Scotland's biggest-ever
property show will take place from March 31 to April 2, offering
potential buyers the opportunity to consult dozens of exhibitors
including estate agents, builders, and overseas developers, and get free
advice from property professionals on the financial and legal
implications of house purchase at home or abroad.
Despite initial scepticism, last year's inaugural show turned out be a
big success. Bill Cullen of Clyde Property says: ''To tell you the
truth, I went into it in a rather half-hearted manner just because the
National Association of Estate Agents asked me to take part -- but we
were overwhelmed with business.
''The show had a great buzz to it and we met lots of Scots who were
thinking of moving home and who wanted us to do valuations on their
current property.
We also noticed that many of them wanted financial advice, so this
time we will have two mortgage consultants with a computer who can
provide advice on borrowing. We're taking the whole thing much more
seriously this year.'' The 1995 show has attracted a wide range of
builders, estate agents, interior design consultants, banks, building
societies, financial and legal advisors, park home operators, and
overseas developers from around the globe. Many of the builders at the
show will be offering incentives for purchasers.
Free seminars on Buying a Home Overseas, and the ''A-Z of Buying in
Scotland will run twice daily. STV's Home Show programme will be running
demonstrations and competitions, the winner of the key prize will have
their mortgage paid for a year (up to the value of #5000).
Mike Bridge, organiser of the Homebuyer Show, said: ''After last
year's success we are glad to be able to offer Scotland's homebuyers an
even bigger show at the SECC this year. Exhibitors in 1994 were very
impressed by the canny attitude of the visitors.
''Scots are very well informed about property issues and this year's
show offers the chance to consult top professionals, as well as obtain
details of thousands of properties at home or abroad. We're also very
pleased to see prestigious new exhibitors, like the Disney Vacation
Club, which is coming to Scotland for the first time.''
The latter is a new concept from the Disney Corporation. At the moment
there is a Disney Vacation Club resort at Walt Disney World near Orlando
in Florida. An oceanfront resort at Vero Beach, a quiet little town on
Florida's Atlantic coast, will open later this year. Further resorts are
planned for Hilton Head Island in south Carolina and Newport Beach in
California.
Depending on the size of the interest purchased, members receive an
annual allocation of points that can vary from 210 to 2000 points. The
company claims that the average US member has just over 300 points,
which cost about #10,000 at current exchange rates.
The points can be exchanged for long or short-break holidays at either
Vero Beach or Orlando. The number of points required for each holiday
depends on the resort, size of accommodation, length of stay, and time
of year.
The company claims 12,000 Disney Vacation Club members, with more than
400 in the UK.
Scotland's estate agents are well represented at the show. Firms
exhibiting everything from starter flats for first time buyers, to
luxury executive homes in town or country, include: Clyde Property,
Nationwide, Graham Miller, Homes, the Glasgow Solicitors Property
Centre, Edinburgh Solicitors Property Centre, and Welch &amp; Roe.
Builders active in Scotland and attending the show will include Miller
Homes, L&amp;C Homes, Bellway Homes, Persimmon, Avonside Timber Frame,
National House Builders Council, Tay Homes, Taywood Homes, Welcome
Homes, Bourne Leisure Group, and Ogilvy Homes.
Lenders and financial institutions include the Bank of Scotland, Abbey
Life, Prudential Assurance, Sun Alliance, and TSB.
Unfortunately, too many people make an unwise decision to purchase
property abroad while under the influence of sun and sangria.
The show offers the chance to decide in a cool atmosphere with plenty
of advice at hand, and the chance to take legal advice before taking the
plunge. Overseas developers and agencies taking part in the show
include: American Country Homes, Grupo Masa o f Alicante in Spain,
Ioannides Developers of Cyprus, Obrano Construcao de Imoveissa of
Portugal, Overseas Leisure Consultancy, United National Real Estate of
Kansas City, and Sunstate International.
The Scottish Homebuyer Show is sponsored by The Herald and STV.

THE Lion King is the hottest-selling gimmick of the year. Videos,
books, sweets, and toiletries which feature the cub's cute little face
are the mane attraction for under-age shoppers.
Can another Lion King help to sell Powrie Castle, above, a historic
fortified house within easy reach of Dundee?
It stands on a site which has historical links with Scotland's own
lion king -- William the Lion (1143-1214). While consolidating the
feudal system in Scotland as part of a bid to hold his English enemies
at bay, he granted the Powrie Castle site to the Laird of Ogilvy in
1170.
It remained in that family until acquired by Thomas Fotheringham in
1412.
The property which now stands on the ancient site dates from the
seventeenth century and originally formed the northern range of a former
fifteenth-century keep whose ruins stand nearby. In the late Seventies
Powrie Castle was restored and renovated, retaining many historic
features such as slop channels, fortified doors, shot holes, and arrow
slits.
The castle is built of stone under a slated roof and accommodation
includes two reception ro oms, three bedrooms (one with ensuite
facilities), one further bathroom, kitchen with Aga, study, and sewing
room. The gardens extend to about an acre and and include herbaceous
borders, lawns, and hardwood trees.
Diarmid Mackenzie Smith of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley says: ''The
accommodation has been renovated and maintained to a very high standard
and could be an ideal home for anyone working in the Dundee, Perth or
Forfar area.
Offers in excess of #275,000 are being sought by Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley.

Tokyo, Tuesday -- Stocks staged a modest technical rebound after
yesterday's staggering falls, ending ahead because of a late flurry of
foreign buying of bank shares, and earlier short-covering.
The Nikkei share average added 244.73 points, or 1.46%, to end at
17,053.43.
But traders said a bitter taste remains in their mouths, adding they
were disappointed by the meagre recovery and fear there may be another
nasty twist in the Barings debacle.
''People are using it as another excuse not to buy given the stretched
valuations of the market and the bad demand/supply situation,'' said
Neil Rogers, strategist at UBS Securities.
Turnover was estimated at a thin 240 million shares, well down on
yesterday's 312 million. Traders said the thin turnover helped
exaggerate index moves.
The Nikkei rose as high as 17,164.78 in early trading, helped by
index-linked buying as a result of a strong rebound in the futures
market. However, waves of index-linked selling pressured the market down
in early afternoon, after traders said Daiwa Securities was selling
Nikkei 225 futures on behalf of Barings. A Daiwa spokesman said he was
unable to comment on the matter.
The key March Nikkei 225 futures contract finally closed ahead 110
points to 17,000 on turnover of 34,476 contracts.
Meanwhile, the Topix index surged 27.43 points, or 2.08%, to 1348.39
thanks to the late buying of banking shares, and the Nikkei 300 index
climbed 5.68 points, or 2.34%, to 248.53.
''Everyone knows Daiwa will be liquidating (Barings positions) so in a
sense the information has to be reflected in the current market price,''
said a futures trader at a major Japanese securities house.
''The feeling is that it's unlikely to cause a dramatic sell-off,
because everyone is expecting it. But markets of course don't always
make sense,'' he added. -- Reuter.

Maurice Johnston yesterday ended his exile from premier division
football by joining the fight to keep Falkirk in the top flight.
And the 31-year-old, now with his eighth senior club, claimed he had
won his personal battle against Hearts.
Johnston moved from Tynecastle to Brockville on a free transfer and
will be there until June next year at least.
He will make his debut against Motherwell at Fir Park on Saturday, his
first taste of premier division football since last September.
Since then, Johnston has been languishing in the Hearts reserve side,
claiming the Edinburgh club was trying to push him out the door.
He was reputed to be on wages of #3000 a week, and with 16 months of
his contract still to run that meant he could have stayed put and earned
almost #200,000.
''I would have taken it right through to the end, if I hadn't got what
I considered to be a just settlement,'' Johnston said yesterday.
''I'm a pretty stubborn guy, and no one was going to push me out the
door. When the manager, Tommy McLean, set out his stall, I set out mine.
''He thought he would beat me, but they got me on a free transfer from
Everton and I only wanted a fair settlement.''
There can be no doubting the nerve of a man who once played for Celtic
and agreed to rejoin them before changing his mind and signing for Old
Firm rivals Rangers.
''Tommy McLean hasn't spoken to me since last September,'' Johnston
said yesterday. ''Nor has he ever told me why I would never play in the
Hearts first team.
''He told me he was putting me on the transfer list and that he would
listen to offers for me. Eamonn Bannon would come and tell me I was down
for reserve duty.
''I must say, however, that we never publicly fell out, even when I
had to go and train with the kids.
''I rather enjoyed that, actually, although professionally it wasn't
doing me much good. I told the manager to go and take a hike and he said
something similar. But you hear that a lot of times on the training
pitch or on the park.
''But I had done nothing wrong, so it was frustrating. However, if
that was the way he wanted to run his team, there was nothing I could do
about it.
''I tried to come to an arrangement with the club in September, and it
would have saved them a lot of money.
''I wasn't being greedy -- I didn't ask for anything like a full
settlement. But it has taken since then until now to get it sorted out.
''During that time, seven clubs have come in for me, offering to pay
the same money as I was getting at Hearts.
''But there was no way I was moving until Hearts paid up. I wanted to
prove a point.
''I held out and got a settlement after a meeting with Hearts chairman
Chris Robinson this morning -- I have the cheque in my top pocket.
''I don't regret my time at Hearts, and I wish everyone -- well almost
everyone -- there all the best. But it's all in the past now.
''At this stage of my career I need first-team football, and I'm
grateful to the Falkirk chairman George Fulston and the manager Jim
Jefferies for giving me the chance.
''If I had to stay out of the premier division for a year-and-a-half
then I doubt if I could have come back.
''It's all about Falkirk now, and I just can't wait to train with the
lads tomorrow and play on Saturday.''
Johnston is the third player signed by the Brockville club in the last
week, with Motherwell pair Paul McGrillen and Steve Kirk helping them
beat Hibernian last Saturday.
Chairman Fulston revealed that Johnston would not be earning a penny
more than any other senior player at the club.
He said: ''To get a player of his quality and magnitude is a huge step
forward. He had a problem and it is now solved.
''Maurice got exactly what he wanted from Hearts and I got exactly
what I wanted from Hearts -- the player.
''There is no question, however, that he will be paid at a rate above
the other experienced players.
''He won't be getting a penny more, because I won't disturb the
dressing room here for anything or any individual.
''Having said that, the attitude of everyone involved has been
marvellous. When the players heard of our interest in Maurice they
realised he is just the kind of player we need in our fight for
survival.
''Some of the lads came to me and to Jim Jefferies and told us to go
and get him and not to worry about them.
''Of course he is entitled to a signing-on fee -- he was a free agent.
But he is delighted to stand by our wage structure.''
Johnston's arrival ends days of hard bargaining for Jefferies. ''I've
been looking for an experienced striker and I've got the best,'' he
said.
''Maurice has always been my first choice, and I'm delighted to get
him.''
In a separate deal, Falkirk striker Colin Cramb, 20, has joined Hearts
for a #50,000 fee.
Cramb, who also had spells with Hamilton and Southampton, has signed
until the end of the season but could clinch a longer deal if he
impresses Tommy McLean.
Cramb said: ''This is a great move for me and I can't wait to start
playing football again.''

SCOTTISH rugby's walking wounded are to undergo intensive
physiotheraphy and rehabilitation treatment at the world-renowned
National Sports Injury Centre at Lilleshall in Shropshire.
Injured internationalists Andy Nicol, Alan Sharp and Peter Walton will
book into the centre on Monday for a week's intensive therapy. Damian
Cronin will also visit on Monday for assessment on the elbow tendon
damaged in the game against France ten days ago.
He is still in plaster after an operation in Glasgow last week but the
plan is to have the Lilleshall experts draw up a programme of treatment
which would have him on the mend sooner than would otherwise have been
possible.
The decision to utilise the Lilleshall facilities -- which in the past
have been used successfully by professional football players like the
Rangers' midfielder Ian Durrant -- was taken at the weekend by Scotland
team manager Duncan Paterson after consultation with Scottish Rugby
Union medical adviser Donald Macleod.
The Jed-Forest and Scotland scrumhalf Gary Armstrong, who is
recuperating after an operation on badly damaged left knee ligaments
last October has also been invited to attend as has the Bath lock Andy
Reed who earlier this month underwent surgery for a spinal disc problem.
Yesterday SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said:''We are keen that Gary
should go but it might be a bit soon for him. He is undergoing
physiotherapy in Edinburgh and has set himself a target of getting back
to the game by September. With Andy Reed, too, we would hope that he
would be at Lilleshall sooner rather than later.''
Hogg added that the intention was to have the injured
internationalists back into contention for the World Cup squad which is
chosen in March.
Nicol, the former Dundee HS FP scrumhalf who is now with Bath, badly
damaged a knee in an Alloa Cup semi-final game last April. Walton, the
Northampton flanker, who is well into a recovery programme for his knee
injury expects to be back playing soon and Alan Sharp, the Bristol prop,
is on the mend from his back problem and has recently undertaken light
scrummaging work.
The SRU chief executive said that the cost of the treatment would be
met by the Union. The week-long, live-in course of treatment, which is
subsidised by the Sports Council costs #415 per person. ''The players
and their clubs will also benefit, of course, but we thought it right
that, in the national cause, we should put this programme into
operation,'' said Hogg.
Yesterday Lilleshall physiotherapist Philip Newton who will be in
charge of the Scottish players' treatment, said that the majority of
their clients were referred to the centre by their governing bodies or,
in the case of professional footballers, by their clubs.

Real Madrid 2, Celtic 0
THE famous all-white strip is still worthy of the world's respect. In
a match arranged for Spanish television, Real Madrid strutted their
stuff against Celtic, who were left breathless and beaten before 35,000
supporters in Malaga's Rosaleda stadium last night.
The leaders of the Spanish first division played with a supreme
confidence and touch and could easily have punished a willing but
drastically inferior Celtic more severely. Afterwards, the premier
division side's manager Tommy Burns readily admitted his players had
been spared.
Just more than a hundred Celtic supporters were in the ground owned by
Spanish third-division side Club Malaga, and these people were given a
clear indication of just how far behind are Celtic in particular and
Scottish football in general. Real Madrid's players play a much more
refined and intelligent game than anything seen in Scotland and this was
not even their top side.
Although they had nine full internationalists, mainly Spaniards, but
one each from Slovakia (Peter Dubosky) and Argentina (Fernando Redondo),
five of their best players were rested. Brian Laudrup's brother Michael,
Luis Enrique, Ivan Zamorano, and Amavisca sat out last night's game as
did the rising star of Spanish football, 17-year-old Raoul.
Nevertheless, Real were on a different level altogether from Celtic
and Burns said: ''At this stage Celtic FC are not ready to play against
the Real Madrids of this world.
''When you take that into consideration then I suppose I am reasonably
pleased with my own team's performance, but Real Madrid could have
scored many more goals and they could have embarrassed us. We tried hard
and hopefully my players have learned a great deal from this game
tonight because Real Madrid play the way I would like Celtic to perform,
but that takes a long time to perfect.
''In Scotland we are old-fashioned in the way we play the game and it
is time now to change attitudes.''
While it is healthy to aspire to greatness, achieving it is something
else entirely, especially in football terms, but Burns believes if
enough people in Scottish football are willing to change then the look
of our game will improve given enough time.
''Scottish football, indeed British football, is played very much back
to front and although players will take the ball through the midfield
they are still likely to thump the ball forward whenever in trouble,''
he said. ''However, players have to be able to go back and take
possession even in difficult areas and look to play a telling pass.
''There is a reason for keeping possession, and it is to try to open
up the opposition's defence just as Real Madrid did tonight. Their
players were always thinking about the game and that's the difference
with the Scottish player.''
The Celtic manager reintroduced Paul McStay to the midfield after he
had sat out the side's last three matches and although always under
severe pressure the midfield player was probably Celtic's best
performer. Charlie Nicholas, who had not played since he scored a goal
in the Coca-Cola Cup final, also started the match, but he was kept
indoors at half-time and his place taken by John Collins.
By then Real Madrid had scored both their goals and although Celtic
tightened up in the second 45 minutes, the Spaniards were content to
play the ball around, making the game look ridiculously easy. ''As
always, the Scottish side were competitive, but more than that is
required to play football,'' said Real Madrid's captain Emilio
Butragueno, who scored the second goal from the penalty spot in 24
minutes.
The ball had been played forward in the air and central defender Tony
Mowbray lost track of it as he turned and when he traced the ball's path
again he was horrified to see Dubosky heading for goal. Mowbray
challenged clumsily and Real were awarded a penalty.
It looked a soft award although not a single Celtic player contested
the decision and Butraguena sauntered forward as though enjoying the
night air and he placed the ball in the right-hand corner of Pat
Bonner's net.
The ball had been placed in the opposite corner six minutes earlier
when Real Madrid took the lead. Nicholas dallied too long in possession
and was dispossessed in midfield before the ball was floated into
Celtic's box where Brian O'Neil headed clear, but only as far as
Alfonso.
O'Neil tumbled after his clearance and that allowed the Spanish player
to cut inside leaving Tosh McKinlay and Mowbray in his wake before
clipping a delightful shot into the net.
It was evident after only a few minutes of play that the Spaniards
were in the mood, particularly Redondo, who made it clear he intended to
run the midfield. He played with a nonchalance which suggested supreme
confidence.
REAL MADRID -- Canizares, Chendo, Marcos, Nando, Redondo, Alkorta,
Butragueno, Alfonso, Dubosky, Sandro, Martin Vazquez. Substitutes --
Rojas, Contreras (reserve keeper), Santamaria, Luis Martinez, Alvaro,
Fernando Hierro, Victor, Dani.
CELTIC -- Bonner, Boyd, McKinlay, O'Neil, Mowbray, Grant, Nicholas,
McStay, van Hooydonk, Walker, O'Donnell. Substitutes -- Collins,
Marshall, Gray, Slavin, McLaughlin, Falconer, McNally.
Referee -- Lopez Nieto (Spain).

<HEADLINE>Far East hunt widens for missing Barings trader Bank plot theory played down</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979615872</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE hunt for dealer Nick Leeson, whose colossal gamble on the complex
derivatives market brought down Barings merchant bank, spread throughout
the Far East yesterday.
As the search widened Asian financial experts played down claims that
sabotage was to blame for the bank's collapse.
Mr Leeson, 28, was last seen at his office in Singapore last Thursday,
and was spotted the following day across the border in Malaysia.
Police and colleagues speculated yesterday that the trader may have
tried to cross Malaysia's northern border into Thailand. The dense,
tropical jungle border is laced with smugglers' routes and tunnels
formerly used by communist rebels.
''There's a variety of ways to slip out of the country to Thailand,''
one police source said. ''All it takes is money and the right
contacts.''
Mr Leeson, general manager of Barings Futures in Singapore, who is at
the centre of an #800m trading loss which left Britain's oldest merchant
bank in ruins, fled just before the scale of his losses became known.
It was not clear whether his wife Lisa, who was seen leaving their
Singapore flat with him early on Thursday morning, was still with him.
Mr Leeson was last seen checking out of Kuala Lumpur's Regent Hotel on
Friday.
Malaysian police said no charges had been filed against Mr Leeson, but
Singapore's powerful Commercial Affairs Department, which had now taken
over the inquiry, wanted his help.
The trader ran up the losses mainly on futures and options derivatives
based on the Nikkei 225 share index, which means their extent will not
be completely known until contracts are liquidated or expire on March
10.
Singaporean investigators, accompanied by a locksmith, visited Mr
Leeson's home yesterday. They did not appear to take anything away and
would make no comment to reporters.
Ms Christine Sampang, a maid in the building, said Leeson and his wife
had left their home by taxi before dawn on Thursday.
In Thailand, Bangkok authorities said there was a 24-hour watch for
him at all entry points. One unconfirmed report had a sighting of him at
Phuket beach resort.
Meanwhile, Asian financial market dealers yesterday poured cold water
on the theory that Barings was broken by sabotage.
The bank's chairman, Mr Peter Baring, told the Financial Times it was
possible that someone could have approached Mr Leeson with a plan to
profit from wrecking one of Britain's most respected merchant banks.
However, dealers in similar markets said foul play was unlikely. Their
main concern was that nobody noticed what he was up to before it was too
late.
''Mr Leeson's losses were clearly brought about by strategy gone
astray. He just went berserk in trying to cover up losses,'' said an
official at a US bank in Singapore.
Mr Eric Bettleheim, a financial lawyer, told ITN it was ''possible but
unlikely'' that Mr Leeson had worked with a partner in bringing down
Barings.
The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea,
told the BBC: ''If there was a conspiracy and, therefore, the man had a
clear motive -- to satisfy his co-conspirators -- the question still
arises as to how he was doing what he was doing and how he got away with
it.''
A number of local authorities invested funds with Barings, now in the
control of administrators from accountant Ernst &amp; Young after the Bank
of England failed to find a takeover rescuer.
The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, the leading
professional body for public authority finance chiefs, is conducting a
survey of councils to assess the extent of their exposure to the Barings
crisis.
However, intitial indications suggest the risk is limited. ''At a
guess, we would suggest that the exposure is of the order of #50m to
#70m,'' said the institute's director, Mr Noel Hepworth.
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the 800,000-strong GMB general union,
pledged legal support to members whose pensions may be at risk from the
Barings collapse.

East Fife 1, Greenock Morton 1
MORTON were handed a share of the points by an East Fife own goal at a
rain soaked Bayview last night.
East Fife's Paul Hunter was just wide with a lob in the second minute,
but Morton could have taken the lead eight minutes later when Marco
Rajamaki found space inside the box. The Finnish striker, however,
delayed his shot, allowing Alan Sneddon to make an interception.
Rajamaki tried a snap shot in 26 minutes but it was easily saved by
the Fife keeper. Two minutes later, a lovely pass from Derek Lilley put
Rajamaki clear only for Willie Burns to put in a saving tackle.
A perfect cross from Gilbert Allan was headed home by Alex Hamill to
put East Fife into the lead in 30 minutes.
Morton were gifted an equaliser in 55 minutes when a corner spun off
East Fife's Steve Archibald towards the net and was dropped over the
line by keeper Ewan Wilson.
EAST FIFE -- Wilson, Sneddon, Gibb, Burns, Cusick, Donaghy, Allan,
Archibald, Hamill, Hunter, Hope. Substitutes -- Hutcheon, Andrews,
Robertson.
MORTON -- Wylie, Collins, McArthur, Anderson, Johnstone, Lindberg,
Lilley, Mahood, Alexander, McInnes, Rajamaki. Substitutes -- Laing,
McPherson.
Referee -- J McCluskey (Stewarton).

IT was a backs-to-the-wall performance from Chelsea last night in
Belgium but the English side gave themselves a good chance of reaching
the round of the last four in the European Cup-winners' Cup when they
managed to hold Brugge to just a 1-0 win in a quarter-final, first-leg
match last night.
The London side were forced to defend early on as the home team tried
hard to take a good lead to England for the second leg game in two
weeks, but a collection of poor finishing and good defensive work by
Glenn Hoddle's men combined to give Chelsea a great chance of
progressing even further in the competition.
Hoddle gambled on playing #2.6m Paul Furlong, with Frank Sinclair,
Dennis Wise, and Nigel Spackman also in the side.
John Spencer, the hero of their second round win over Austria Vienna,
almost gave Chelsea a perfect start with a 25-yard shot in the first
minute, but Belgian keeper Dany Verlinden saved.
A swirling wind and the towering Rene Eljekamp made life difficult for
Chelsea, and the striker's neat touch put Buelinckx through after 21
minutes. However, keeper Kevin Hitchcock rescued his side, diving to his
left to hold on to a swinging left-foot shot.
Chelsea were increasingly forced on to the back foot and came to rely
heavily on their keeper, who pulled off two more excellent saves before
the break.
The best chance for Brugge of the opening half fell to Gert Verheyen
after 32 minutes, when Australian Paul Okon gave him a clear shot at
goal, which he drove wastefully over the bar.
The second 45 minutes was similar to the first but the important
difference was that the Belgian side scored.
Verheyen, whose earlier chance was easier, put the ball in the net
after 83 minutes, but it may prove to be not enough for the Belgians.
A black spot for Chelsea was that John Spencer, the former Rangers
striker, was booked.

DANOLI now will go straight to the Cheltenham Festival after trainer
Tom Foley yesterday decided against running his Champion Hurdle hope in
the Gowran Park mud.
After 10 days of indecision, Foley pulled his top hurdler out of the
Red Mills Hurdle at the last minute, offering the heavy going as the
reason.
''The ground is too testing and with time running out for us before
Cheltenham, I decided to withdraw my horse,'' said the trainer.
''I didn't want him to have a really hard race and have too much taken
out of him with the Champion Hurdle just two weeks away.''
Foley's plan now is to give Danoli, partnered by Charlie Swan as he
was in last year's Triumph Hurdle, a stiff gallop but he would not say
where this would take place. ''I will gallop him somewhere even if it
means we have to put up poles on an all-weather track,'' he said.
* CATTERICK failed to complete its programme for the second time in a
row when high winds forced the abandonment of yesterday's meeting after
the third race.
The Yorkshire track's meeting earlier in the month was cancelled after
the fourth race because of heavy ground.
Scottish trainer Peter Monteith reckoned his horse, Glindigo, winner
of the third race had almost been undone by the wind.
''The wind knocked him across into the bad ground and there was
nothing Tony Dobbin could do about it,'' said Monteith.
* RODNEY Moogan has been fined #200 for riding an ill-judged race on
Dancing Sensation, third in the apprentices' race at Lingfield
yesterday.
Moogan, a 7lb claimer, appeared to give his mount far too much to do.
Dancing Sensation stayed on but was beaten into third place behind the
favourite, Warm Spell, and Royal Circus.

CALEY Thistle bosses face a showdown with the Scottish League that
could endanger the club's national status.
The Inverness outfit has admitted it will not have a new #3.5 million
stadium ready by next season, breaking a promise that helped secure a
place in the new Division Three.
The League has demanded a meeting at which Jags will be asked to
explain why they are failing to meet obligations to the other 39 clubs.
No date has been fixed, but the talks will be held soon and the League
said Thistle's future in the 40-club set-up could come under the
spotlight.
The club have asked for permission to stay at Caledonian's Telford
Street Park, where they have played this season, for the first four
months of the next campaign.
Director Dougie McGilvray said yesterday that unforeseen planning
problems had caused delays.
Meanwhile, disappointed Thistle manager Sergei Baltacha has
transfer-listed five players -- Gary Watt, Bruce McCraw, Billy Skinner,
Colin Sinclair, and Dave Brennan.

DUNDEE United have taken the first steps towards rooting out the bad
element of their support which has put the club's good name under
threat.
The Tannadice board have met with officials from their supporters
federation following trouble at the Scottish Cup tie at Huntly. United
fans -- accused by chairman Jim McLean of having consumed too much
alcohol -- caused a barrier to collapse at Christie Park.
Last night McLean made it clear that measures are in hand in an
attempt to act against what he sees as a double problem. ''We recognise
there is a small element among real supporters of the club who can be
disruptive at times,'' said McLean. ''What we find more disturbing is
that a group of people are latching on to the club who are not
supporters of Dundee United.
''These people have been responsible for fighting which broke out in
Edinburgh before a Hibs game and in Glasgow before we played at Ibrox.
''Our supporters gained a superb reputation, and we are determined
that is not tarnished.'' But McLean also called for the SFA to inspect
grounds after cup draws are made to help set crowd limits for specific
ties as he believes part of the problem at Huntly was due to
overcrowding.

JIM Oliver, the Partick Thistle chairman, intends to invest in pitch
covers for Firhill. The postponement of the club's league game against
Motherwell last night -- after heavy rain left the ground waterlogged --
has convinced Oliver that something has to be done quickly.
''Every time this has happened we have been hit by excessive rain on
the day of the game,'' he said, ''I have spoken to Rangers who have
these covers and I believe it is essential that we get them.''
Thistle have two outstanding league games to play on their own ground,
one against Dundee United, which has been put off five times since its
scheduled date of December 10, and the Motherwell one which was
originally set for February 11.
The game postponed last night is likely to be re-set for March 14, and
Oliver hopes that will change things in itself. ''It has been the
wettest February on record,'' he pointed out, ''and once we get the
covers you can be sure it will be the driest spell of the year.''
Firhill manager John Lambie spent much of yesterday on the phone
trying to get some swop deals going. ''We don't have money to spend, but
I have got to try to get something moving.''

KEN HILL died less than a month ago of cancer. The last of his musical
extravaganzas, Zorro -- The Musical!, demonstrates the zesty
theatricality and impish sense of fun that characterised the 21 years of
his artistic directorship of this theatre.
Zorro, the masked black-clad crusader fighting for justice in early
nineteenth-century Los Angeles, has only been with us since 1924 when
the first film and book appeared. Rather like the Scarlet Pimpernel, our
hero has a dual identity: his alter ego is a wimp or fop, trawling
around the corridors of power.
In Bogdan Kominowski's breezy and athletic performance, Zorro comes
alive as the most upfront member of a jolly and committed cast. His
Roxanne-love is beautifully performed by Leigh Macdonald, as is his
fiery brothel-keeper ally Inez (Jane Stoggles). The rest of the cast
double or triple in their roles, notably Michael N Harbour, best as a
Captain Hook-like Jean Laffite, and Toni Palmer as the wife of the
ambassador, among many other roles. Larry Dann extracts a lot of humour
from his impersonations and Silvester McCoy makes an amusing dumb
servant with masterly timing reminiscent of Harpo Marx.
Ken Hill produced, co-directed, and wrote the lyrics, drawing the
music from classic Spanish zarzuelas and the popular operettas by
Chapis, Valverde, and others. An intoxicatingly enjoyable evening.

DENNIS Andries, the British cruiserweight champion, is optimistic that
close friend Gerald McClellan will recover from life-threatening
injuries sustained against Nigel Benn.
Andries, who shared a house for four-and-a-half years with the
American boxer, said yesterday: ''I know Gerald is in safe hands.
''He is getting the best treatment possible. He will come through.''
McClellan has had another brain scan, and doctors at the Royal London
Hospital said his brain is still slightly swollen after an emergency
operation to remove a huge blood clot.
They said he would remain on a ventilator under sedation overnight.
McLellan's condition remains critical but stable, with no new problems
developing in the past 24 hours.
Andries, who was at the ringside on Saturday, will go ahead with his
bout against American Mike Peak in Livingston on Saturday.
''No-one is putting a gun to my head. When it comes to fight time, my
mind switches off,'' he said.
The fight is chief support to Naseem Hamed's defence of the WBC
international super bantemweight title against Sergio Liendo of
Argentina.
Meanwhile, Benn left Britain last night for a family holiday in
California to escape the ''pressure'' surrounding him over the condition
of 27-year-old McLellan.
The WBC super-middleweight champion, still bearing the scars and
stitches from his ferocious 10-round battle, flew to Disneyland with his
two children.

Theatre
BROOKSIDE comes to the Royal Court in Michael Wynne's Le Knocky, the
toast of last year's Royal Court Young Writer's Festival.
Twenty-two-year-old Wynne's impressive first play is a Merseyside slice
of life which would certainly fit snugly into a midweek episode of the
Channel Four sitcom. But Wynne's humour is both more wicked than would
be allowed on telly and slightly less controversial than, say, Jim
Cartwright's Road with its implications of the disastrous effects of
unemployment on British working-class life.
Knocky is altogether gentler, more conventionally framed than
Cartwright's jagged patchwork of scenes -- though no less informed by a
sense of desperate pity. Wynne's subtle, sometimes almost tender
approach highlights a moment where adolescent dreams, poverty, and
feminine grip collide on a day meant to be a family celebration --
gran's seventieth birthday -- but which is hijacked into another realm
by a break-in, as it turns out, by one of their own. A day of
revelations all round, Wynne's comedy asks: how do you keep a sense of
moral values going under such conditions?
Brian Stirner's naturalistic production is perhaps too loose in
certain aspects. But it certainly captures the jaunty, everyday web of
existence just as it is about to be torn asunder. Like Jonathan Harvey's
Beautiful Thing, the family here is distinctive for its strong
matriarchal characters, led by Eileen O'Brien's strained but unswerving
Norma and Felicity Montagu's feisty, wayward sister Mary.

Music
IT can't be easy being the Cramps in 1995. It's been a dozen or more
years since their unique kitsch cryptabilly thrived anywhere more
mainstream than in pop culture's eerie backwaters rubbing vaudevillean
shoulders with Screaming Jay Hawkins and Russ Meyer.
Still, they continue to churn out sprightly albums at regular
intervals, finding increasingly novel ways to expand their repertoire of
camp homages to sex, drugs, gore movies, hot-rods, and flying saucers.
And there is still a sizeable audience for this cheesy esoterica. If
you've ever wondered what happened to all those tattooed and bequiffed
psychobillies then you need look no further than the next Cramps show --
ditto over-crimped goths and Mohican punks.
Revelling in such loyalist idolatory, group founders Lux Interior and
Poison Ivy Rosarch waste no time in setting about their primordial swamp
and roll with support from the latest in a succession of rhythm
sections, seemingly chosen at random as much for their compatibility
with PVC and leopard skin as for their dexterity with bass and drums.
Unfortunately, the Academy's cavernous acoustics deal harshly with any
musical subtleties buried in a procession of glammy retro workouts and
it's left to the cadaverous Lux -- resplendent in wet-look plastic
one-piece and court shoes -- to break up the uniformity by falling over
a lot and doing unspeakable things with his microphone stand.
It takes the self-explanatory Bikini Girls with Machine Guns to ignite
an already partisan crowd. The faithful are then rewarded with spirited
readings of Cramps essentials Human Fly and The Crusher, served up with
swaths of mutant surf guitar and with Lux as his catatonic,
chest-beating apogee.

Michael Tumelty previews
an extraordinary concert
TONIGHT the World Music Centre of the Northern College stages a
display of muscle that is more an extravaganza than a concert, more a
statement of intent than an event.
In what looks like a flagship display of world music, the students and
staff of the Northern College's school of music will unveil a series of
performances on Balinese gamelan orchestra, Ghanaian drums, Latin
American samba band, and a host of ensembles from swing band to
saxophone quartet, from close-harmony group to 100-strong choir.
''This is a big splash; this is what's going on at Northern College,''
said Pete Stollery, music lecturer and performance co-ordinator. ''We've
had a new degree since 1988, we have new specialist lecturers, we're
doing new courses, and our numbers have risen -- we now have 140
students doing the B.Ed. honours music course.
''Tonight we're letting the world -- in Aberdeen and outside -- know
we're here. This is our statement, our first season of concerts, a
showcase of the full range of student and staff talent, and our intent
is to let the world know we're up and bouncing.''
The new degree course was set up at the Northern College -- formerly
Aberdeen College of Education -- in 1988 by Professor Jonathan Stephens,
who, observing the demise of music-teaching departments in universities
(including Aberdeen University) decided on an expansionist role for the
subject in his own school of music. One of his dreams, said Pete
Stollery, was the development of a centre for world music, drawing on a
wide spectrum of ethnic music that would be useful to students going out
to teach music in secondary schools.
The centre at the Northern College has expanded rapidly. There are now
eight specialist staff and, as well as covering orthodox classical
music, the department contains a technology centre, run by Pete
Stollery, which includes computer work stations and a composition
studio.
On the ethnic front, the world music centre includes a band
specialising in Latin American dance music -- salsa, mambo, and samba.
The centre also boasts a set of West African drums on which students are
taught authentic practice by Ghanaian lecturer Dr Robert Kwami.
The main focus of the centre, however, is the Javanese gamelan
orchestra: the real McCoy, hand-crafted in Bali and containing
metallophones, gongs, drums, and cymbals -- around 24 instruments in
spectacular reds and burnished gold. The gamelan is one of only four in
the UK.
Gordon Jones, head of the world music centre and in charge of the
gamelan orchestra, was appointed in 1992 to set up and develop the
centre as part of the B.Ed. Honours course. He has worked in the States
and Europe, and learned his gamelan on the shop-floor, as it were, in
Bali, which he has visited four times.
Jones was responsible for bringing the first gamelan into Britain when
he taught at Dartington College in Devon.
While tonight's gala concert is essentially a showcase for the
resources and talents of the college itself, the intention of the
department is to develop a range of outreach activities in schools and
communities throughout Grampian and the Highlands.

ENGLISH soccer hooligans belonging to Combat 18, the secretive
ultra-right group of dedicated troublemakers, were said to have been
among the crowd last night when Chelsea played FC Brugge in a European
Cup-winners' Cup tie.
Belgian police were alerted to the presence of the group which is
named after Adolph Hitler's initials, the first and eighth letters of
the alphabet.
It was not known last night if group members were among the 90 Chelsea
fans arrested in Brugge mostly for drunkenness, fighting, and minor
offences.
About 1000 Chelsea fans were detained by police as they made their way
to the match. It is believed most had no tickets. Police, backed by riot
and mounted squads and water cannon, handcuffed the fans and led them to
a secret holding area where they were expected to be detained overnight.
Many were bundled off protesting.
A Reuter reporter on the scene said police on horseback also charged
on several occasions at fans who gathered around bars near the Olympia
Stadium.
Neo-Nazis from Germany were also taken into custody when trouble
threatened in the centre of Brugge before the match. A BBC television
journalist was beaten up by English fans. A Chelsea fan was arrested
after the stabbing in the back of a Brugge supporter who was taken to
hospital but later released.
Belgian police, still haunted by the Heizel Stadium disaster in
Brussels, deployed hundreds of armed officers to control the crowds of
Chelsea fans.
Belgian television showed groups of drunken Chelsea fans chanting
anti-IRA slogans and some being manhandled by policemen after being told
they had to leave the country. The Belgian authorities ignored the EU's
new freedom of movement laws, invoking national security to justify the
deportations.
Some of the 200 deported fans immediately crossed the Channel again
and made for Calais where some were intercepted a second time.
* CHELSEA captain Dennis Wise was not too unhappy last night after his
side were beaten 1-0 by FC Brugge in the quarter-final, first-leg tie.
Wise promised a more attacking performance from the London side when
the clubs meet in two weeks, and he put Brugge's late winner --
officially credited to Gert Verheyen -- down as an own goal by Paul
Furlong. The goal came with seven minutes remaining, finally breaking
the resistance of Chelsea's stand-in keeper Kevin Hitchcock, who
repeatedly defied the Belgians as he came in for the injured Dmitri
Kharine.
John Spencer, the former Rangers striker, almost gave the Londoners a
perfect start with a first-minute shot.

IT is fair to say that it has never been more difficult for young
people -- and others -- to make career choices, than it is at the
present time. It's hard for anyone to crystal-ball gaze and know that a
few years hence, the prospects in particular sectors will be healthy and
buoyant. And the switch from traditional core workforces to huge swathes
within the labour market now being employed on contract, also requires a
radical rethink, light years from old norms. Flexibility is the buzzword
of the nineties, and the more flexible everyone can be in all aspects of
training and work these days, the better.
Whatever the dilemmas facing the future job seeker today, it cannot be
disputed that the better informed the individual is, the more options
become available. Add to these points, the opportunity to hear at first
hand from those at the sharp end -- employers, university and college
staff, careers advisers, training organisations, representatives from
bodies such as Scottish Enterprise, the Local Enterprise Companies
(LECs) -- the areas of potential and their prospects, the educational
training and skills which are sought today, and it adds up to a
worthwhile overview.
Careers 2000, which opens at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference
Centre, Glasgow, on Thursday, March 2 and runs until Sunday, March 5,
provides just such a forum.
Admission is free, and those attending it will find a diverse range of
exhibitors and representatives, from the fields of: Information
Technology; Technology and Engineering; Building and Construction;
Electrical Power Generation; Oil Platform Construction Technology; Law;
the Pharmaceutical Industry; Retailing; Secretarial; Local Government;
Finance/Banking; Insurance; Health and Hospital Care; Churches; Merchant
Navy; the Armed Services; Air Traffic Control.
Scottish Enterprise, and its network of LECs, will present
Skillseekers at Careers 2000. What is Skillseekers?
It is an initiative set up to help young people over the age of 16
find alternative ways of gaining employment via training, and the use of
vocational qualification (developed by industry for industry).
The idea is that the youngsters are empowered, through being given
necessary support and spending power, to allow them to buy training
which is relevant to their particular needs.
What happens is that before leaving school, the young person will have
a vocational guidance interview with a careers officer, which culminates
in a Career Plan of Action, detailing his or her career aims, and how it
is planned to achieve these. All this may be placed in the National
Record of Achievement of the young person.
All young people aged 16-18 (and beyond in some LEC areas) are
eligible to receive a Skillseekers' credit. This may be a Skillseeker's
card or cheque book, enabling him or her to buy approved training from
employers, colleges and local training providers who belong to the
Skillseekers' Initiative.
Credit values are variable, according to the needs of the young
person, and the type and level of vocational qualification sought.
Employers are supported in providing training which meets the needs of
the companies, as well as those of the young person, while training
providers can either support employers in the delivery of training, or
offer it direct to the trainee.
The training provided within Skillseekers is designed to support the
attainment of the Education and Training Targets for a Competitive
Scotland, developed by the Advisory Scottish Council for Education
Training Targets (ASCETT) and aimed at raising the workforce's skill
levels by the year 2000.
By April of this year, virtually every LEC in Scotland will be
participating in the scheme. It seems a workmanlike initiative: first,
constructively putting the ball in young people's court to map out a
career plan and access the help on offer to achieve it, while
simultaneously taking cognisance of the realistic needs of companies
which may employ them.
Commenting on the Initiative, Bob Downes, director Industry and
Skills, Scottish Enterprise National, said: ''We have always been
committed to providing quality training for young people. Skillseekers
provides an added dimension by giving them choice and control over their
training, and increases the opportunities for training with a job,
higher skill levels, and recognised qualifications.''
At the Careers Service stand, professional advisers will be on hand to
offer their expert guidance to young people, many of whom are
accompanied by their parents. And it's not only youngsters to whom the
Careers Service will offer advice. Retraining or updating of skills
guidance will be given to those older people who seek it.
Universities, central institutions and colleges of Higher Education
will also be represented, with staff on hand to discuss courses and
entrance requirements.

Engineers in the making
SCOTLAND and excellence in engineering, have been synonymous for a
long time. James Watt's steam engine, Thomas Telford's bridges, McAdam's
road surfaces, along with the telephone, invented by Alexander Graham
Bell, and television invented by John Logie Baird, are some of the most
famous engineering inventions which sprang from Scottish soil to bring
revolutionary advances.
Today, 104,000 pairs of Levi jeans are made in Whitburn each week and
in West Lothian, the Alpha chip, the world's fastest microprocessor, is
produced . . . all evidence of Scotland's contribution to engineering
excellence in the nineties.
It is not only in the sphere of traditional engineering, however, that
the skill and expertise continues. In Scotland, some of the
world-leaders in hi-tech manufacturing are to be found; one of the
success stories of modern times.
Engineering remains of great importance to the Scottish economy, with
hundreds of such companies employing thousands of people, and bringing
in millions of pounds. Far from being an obscure industry, engineering
is -- whether most of us realise it or not -- one on which most of us
depend to a surprising degree for a wide spread of things from
manufactured goods to oil, gas and electricity production.
At Careers 2000, the Engineering Training Authority (EnTra), will
launch its new careers brochure: Engineering Careers in Scotland. Within
its 16 pages can be found all the information young people and their
advisers seek, about opportunities at all levels. It addresses itself to
everything from modern apprenticeships after Standard Grades, to degree
courses leading to careers at the top of the profession.
Due to be launched this September in Scotland, is the Modern
Apprenticeships Initiative, designed for youngsters wanting to leave
school, start work and train for a high-level, work-related
qualification, while continuing with technical education, part-time.
''Accelerated'' modern apprenticeships are also open to those who have
continued their education beyond Standard Grades, and want to build on
this by training and working in a company.
At degree level, too, a range of options is available to those with
Highers, including Maths and Science (or equivalent qualifications
gained through other routes), interested in applying scientific
principles to real life problems and their solutions.
A visit to EnTra's stand -- No 306 -- will enable visitors to get a
copy of the brochure, which contains a wealth of information, including
profiles of young people training and working in engineering. Further
information may be obtained by ringing Freephone 0800 282167.
Timetable
of events
CAREERS 2000 will be open at the following times:
Thursday, March 2: 10am-4pm.
Friday, March 3: 10am-4pm.
Saturday, March 4: 10am-4.30pm.
Sunday, March 5: 10am-4.30pm.
On Saturday and Sunday, there will be a series of free talks by the
Careers Service of subjects of interest from secondary school pupils to
adults returning to education.
The programme and timetable remains the same over both days:
10.15am: Choices at Second Year -- information on subject choices.
11.45am: Higher Education -- types of courses and how to apply.
12.45pm: Choices at Second Year -- information on subject choices.
1.30pm: Returning to Education -- information for adults on returning
to education.
2.30pm: Higher Education -- information on types of courses and how to
apply.
3.30pm: Choices at 16-plus -- information on subject options after
fourth year.

BUSINESSES have long recognised the benefits of computer technology.
In the past many companies have tended to buy new software as it was
required without considering any future need to integrate departments
and information. Increasingly, however, firms want to collate the
information stored in their separate computer systems in different
departments and unify their databases to provide the facility to use
this data throughout the company.
Now, with many thousands of hours, and often millions of pounds
invested, companies are seeking a way to bring together all of this
information stored on different computers, often in many locations, and
allow free access across departments and systems.
Gamut Technologies, located in Glasgow's new, prestigious Ailsa Court
development at 121 West Regent Street, have the only Scottish licence
for the Sybase system. Sybase is recognised world-wide as the industry
leader in client/server technology and this system allows companies to
integrate their existing software and allow their different systems to
communicate.
Jim Hall, legal and financial director with Gamut explains the
problems companies have faced in the past: ''Historically companies have
seen a need for a computer software package, have bought the hardware
and software separately within different parts of the organisation
without ever contemplating the potential future need to unify these
systems. We offer a system which allows companies' existing hardware and
software to 'talk' to each other.''
Sybase is the fifth largest software company in the world and perhaps
the best known use of their system was for the 1994 World Cup which
integrated information on three million spectators, 50,000 volunteer
workers, 15,000 reporters, 52 games, 24 teams in nine cities.
Gamut Technologies offers leading edge technology which caters to the
rapidly changing Information Technology (IT) needs of Scotland's top
companies as George Knox, business development director, explained:
''Customers are wanting to build a flexible infrastructure, as it were a
backbone, for their computer systems which Cybase supplies and which
also allows them to add on new products as they require them.''
''Customers don't want control of their computer systems to be from
outside. That is an old business model. They realised this made them too
exposed to one company. We appreciate that and endorse the openness and
flexibility which Sybase offers our customers. We don't want to change
the systems customers already have, we want them to work with what
they've got and add on software which they want and which is suitable
and appropriate for their needs. Once they have the Sybase
infrastructure this becomes very easy for them to do.''
Gamut offers its customers, who already include a number of banks,
financial institutions and major organisations, considerable
technological advice, client/server database systems, systems
development and management, combined with professional consulting and
training all from a local base in Scotland. Being based in Glasgow means
that clients have the solution on their doorstep should any problems
arise and also allows their staff to attend training courses at Gamut's
customised suite of offices.
In the past IT has often been too technologically led according to
Nick Archer, Gamut's customer services director: ''The biggest problem
which has forced users of IT in the past is that it has been driven by
technologists. It must now be driven by the businesses themselves. The
technology is now becoming more within everybody's grasp and companies
want to take control of this and adapt their systems accordingly. Cybase
provides them with the architecture to take control of their own system
and create it in the way that they want.''
Gamut was formed in March 1994 and has considerable experience within
the computer industry. George Knox was born and educated in Glasgow,
Nick Archer was born in Cumbernauld and educated at the University of
London and both have more than 20 years' experience in the computer
industry. Jim Hall was born in Glasgow and educated in the United States
and was a lawyer with one of Scotland's largest law firms.
Gamut Technologies provide long-term partnerships with clients
providing ''regular reviews, mail shots, constant upgrades, skills
transfers, new enhancements, and new releases,'' explains George Knox.
Expertise, leading edge technology, world-class software, quality
consultancy and training all combine to make a package which will both
enhance and improve the facilities and capabilities of Scotland's top
companies. Gamut aims to deliver rapid and sustainable business
performance improvements for its customers. By developing strong
business partnerships, built on trust and integrity.

WHEN it comes to buying a new home, most people would place location
at the top of their lists, and that is borne out by market trends.
It has always been a vitally important factor in Dawn Homes' decisions
when the company has been choosing sites for its developments. Finding
the best and most suitable location is paramount, and as far as this
young company is concerned, there is no room for compromise.
Apart from location, the emphasis has been on creating bright, new
house styles to the highest quality, and Dawn Homes has built homes with
larger-than-usual room size.
Andrew Reid, the managing director of Dawn Homes said: ''We consider
the quality of the location to be the first essential in choosing a
site, and we think we know what our clients are looking for.''
Dawn Homes is based at Prestwick, in Ayrshire, and while many of the
company's developments are on the West Coast, Dawn developments are not
confined only to that area.
Current developments are at Broomhill in Glasgow, at Gourock,
Kilmarnock, Prestwick and Ayr Harbour, and each site has different
specifications and demand an individual approach to the design and style
of the houses to be built there.
Dawn Homes' ultimate goal is to maximise the opportunity given by
their prime positions, building the kind of homes that take full
advantage of those locations. The developments at Ayr Harbour and
Gourock, overlooking the water, are typical examples of this.
At Merchants Quay, South Harbour in Ayr, the six individual flat
styles are all appropriately named after seafaring vessels, are all
two-bedroomed apartments, with balconies overlooking the river.
The Schooner, Clipper and Galleon, Barque, Windjammer and Square
Rigger each has a large lounge, a fitted kitchen with oven, hob and
washer/drier, and fitted bathroom, and fitted wardrobes and en suite in
the master bedrooms.
Double glazing, gas central heating, security door entry and private
parking all come as standard. Prices there range from #59,500 to
#64,500.
At Cragburn Gate in Gourock, the development boasts some of the best
views in Scotland, and with balconies and in some cases, bay windows,
the flats have been designed to take maximum advantage of this
spectacular location.
The Fyne, the Riddon, the Goil, the Striven and the Gareloch, all loch
names, are luxury two-bedroomed apartments, and have feature patio doors
to the balconies, with luxury fittings and a video security door entry
system as standard.
Prices at Cragburn Gate range from #79,500 to #96,500.
Still on the coast, at Carrick Court in Prestwick, the names of the
homes again reflect the outlook. Arran, Bute, Cumbrae, Ailsa and Gigha,
are one, two and three bedroomed flats, and each has fitted mirrored
wardrobes in the bedrooms.
Prices start at #43,750 for the Arran, rising to #49,950 for the Bute.
There are 24 flats at the second phase of the Monkton Court
development, also at Prestwick, priced from #52,000 to #84,000.
Location has been of prime importance at The Laurels in Broomhill too,
and the development is set in an area of woods and shrubs, within easy
reach of all the major amenities.
Prices at The Laurels range from #69,995 to #74,995.
A town centre location at Kilmarnock is proving to be another success
for the company. At Brigade Court, the former fire station has been
carefully refurbished and converted to offer nine individually styled
two-bedroomed flats. Prices are from #41,000 to #44,950.
Dawn Homes has come a long way in four years. Its commitment to
quality, style, and its uncanny ability to find some of the best
locations in west central Scotland, will undoubtedly ensure its
continued popularity and success.

SALES well ahead of target -- one-third of the properties already sold
-- at the new CALA Homes development at Sherbrooke Gardens,
Pollokshields, demonstrate that despite the generally sluggish market,
buyers are fast to act when they see top quality homes being built on
prime sites.
Sherbrooke Gardens is CALA's flagship development, and the #1m worth
of property already sold there shows that CALA's confidence in increased
sales despite the depressed market is well founded. The constant stream
of visitors at the newly opened showhome promises to make Sherbrooke
Gardens one of the busiest new housing developments in the city.
''Sales activity at Sherbrooke Gardens has been lively even before a
brick was laid, because all of the most important factors for homebuyers
are present,'' sales manager Isobel Watt explained. ''The location is
superb, the tree-lined setting outstanding, there are top quality local
shops, schools and leisure facilities within easy walking distance --
and we are building the best homes. We've worked hard to get everything
right, and we are delighted by the response from homebuyers.''
The new showhome is the striking Strathyre, an example of CALA design
at its very best. This magnificent five-bedroom home has been furnished
and decorated by Patricia Moretti of Moretti and Gray, Balfron, who has
designed an airy and sumptuous interior which emphasises the CALA blend
of traditional elegance and modern luxury. The large lounge and spacious
hall are in rich shades of cream, and the decor is distinctive and
elegant.
The dining room has its own air of sophistication, opulent apricot
voile and silk curtains drape the windows, picking up colour tones from
patterned wallpaper from the Osborne &amp; Little range, a modern
interpretation of a traditional design.
''I set out to provide a light and airy, spring-like feel inside the
house, and also to emphasise its luxury and sophistication,'' Patricia
Moretti explained. ''These big houses with double doors linking rooms
lend themselves to this combination of pale colours and rich fabrics.''
The kitchen design is almost Portuguese/Spanish, with lots of white
and blue, yellow and blue, and Designers Guild fabrics. It has the
latest Amtico design floor, on a grey background with blue and white
tile inset. The Strathyre has a breakfast room with patio doors to the
garden adjoining the kitchen, a separate utility room, and an informal
family room.
Upstairs, there are five bedrooms, a family bathroom and an additional
ensuite bathroom with its own bath, shower, bidet and loo. Patricia has
chosen a romantic decor for the master bedroom, with lots of lace and
gilt-framed pictures.
Prices at Sherbrooke Gardens are from #216,000 to #251,000 for the top
of the range Strathyre.
Another exceptional CALA development is currently underway at
Auchenbothie, Kilmacolm, where 15 detached four and five-bedroom villas
are being built at prices from approximately #122,000 to #215,000. The
development is in the land surrounding Auchenbothie House, a beautiful
B-listed mansion which is being converted into 10 one and two-bedroom
flats, at prices from approximately #63,000 to #155,000.
Anyone looking for a spectacular home need look no further than the
enormous, turreted penthouse flat at Auchenbothie, which has several
circular rooms, including the bathroom. If a convenient location is top
of your list of priorities, then the CALA development at Kirklee can
offer a selection of superb one and two-bedroom apartments in the heart
of the West End at prices from #89,000. Full details of all developments
from the CALA head office, telephone 0324 638889.
The new showhome at Sherbrooke Gardens is open from 11am until 5.30pm,
each day except Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

SHONA Robertson, 18, of Aberdeen, will lead Britain's 10-strong pool
of under-19 skiers selected yesterday for the World Junior Alpine Ski
Championships which take place from March 13 to 21 in Voss, Norway.
Robertson, who is a member of the Hanson and Robertson British women's
Europe Cup squad, has struck form this season with a win in a FIS Giant
Slalom and win and a third place in FIS Super G in America just before
Christmas.
Four Scots, two British team members, and two KPMG Scottish Alpine
team skiers have been include in the team.
Following the cutback in Sports Council funding and an ongoing lack of
sponsorship, all selected athletes will be asked to meet the main costs
of the trip themselves. Team:
Men -- Mark Reilly, 18, Perth; Tim Fawke, 18, England; Johnny
Moulder-Brown, 16, England; Oliver Hall, 16, England; Angus Shedden, 17,
England; Michael Pilarski, 17, Falkirk.
Women -- Shona Robertson, 18, Aberdeen; Tessa Pirie, 17, Aberdeen;
Sophie Ormond, 16, Grand Bornand, France; Kelly Morris, 18, England.
* ROSS Baxter, 16, of Boroughmuir High Sschhol, Edinburgh, scored
Scotland's best result at the World Schools Ski Championships in
Tarvisio, Italy, with a ninth place in slalom. Scotland were fifth in
men's giant slalom, and the Scottish women sixth.

SQUASH:
By ELSPETH BURNSIDE
PETER Nicol is looking to the inaugural British Telesquash
Championships starting at the Skean Dhu courts, Dyce, on Friday and
Saturday to provide the perfect confidence booster at the start of the
most vital few weeks of the season.
The 21-year-old world No.5 from Inverurie is seeded second to the only
player in the world's top 10 that he has yet to beat, England's Peter
Marshall.
Nicol did win an exhibition match between the pair on the same courts
a year ago, and a repeat would set him up nicely for the potentially
lucrative programme of next week's Portuguese Open, the British Open and
then the British National championships.
Oban's Martin Heath, the ever improving world No.36, is Marshall's
first-round opponent, while Nicol meets Newlands' Irish internationalist
Steve Richardson.
A Scottish Women's Telesquash Championship is also taking place over
the two days, and the main interest will surround the comeback of former
Scottish champion, Alison Bowie. Draw:
Men -- P Marshall (England) v M Heath (Scotland); D Harris (England) v
S Parke (England); C Walker (England) v A Davies (Wales); P Nicol
(Scotland) v S Richardson (Ireland). Women -- C Waddell (Aberdeen) v W
Maitland (Westhill); A Bowie (Edinburgh Sports Club) v J Nicol
(Aberdeen).

David Belcher exclusively forecasts the demise of the big-name gig,
and welcomes the bands on the way up.
WHILE this year's Mayfest might not be bringing lovers of contemporary
popular music as many big names as it has done in the bygone Mayfests of
yore, it won't be bringing them the same old names, either. Blues Band
no more. Hank Wangford no more. Jools Holland and His Big Band no more.
Tom Robinson no more. Or at least not, in the case of uncle Tom's
May-time visit to the Renfrew Ferry, as an officially-sanctioned name in
the Mayfest brochure.
''I intend no disrespect to any of those artists, but scheduling them
into Mayfest year after year has been distinctly unadventurous,'' says
Stuart Clumpas, the motivating force behind King Tut's Wah Wah Hut and
one of a group of local promoters charged, for the first time, with
responsibility for Mayfest's 1995 programme of rock, pop, dance music,
country, modern folk, and much more besides.
''We've decided to make Mayfest more cutting-edge,'' says Clumpas.
''To broaden its horizon on the contemporary music front. To make it
sharper while still retaining enjoyable elements for those with more
conservative tastes.''
So what are we going to get?
Bands on the way up; living-legends-to-be as opposed to living legends
preserved in embalming fluid. There'll be the fresh-faced and
fuzzy-chopped Supergrass and new-wave new-wavers Shed Seven, Marion, and
Salad at the Garage, the Plaza and King Tut's respectively. Jig'n'reel
aboard the Renfrew Ferry with punked-up folkies Rock Salt and Nails and
Sharon Shannon.
Savour the guitar-powered melodies of the Lightning Seeds; the
Springsteenesque country-folk of Steve Forbert; the adult pop
sensibility of the Nectarine Number 9, and the acidic-funkiness of the
James Taylor Quartet. Swoon over Whiteout, Greenock's prettier riposte
to Oasis.
Have a gawp at Hole, led by widow Cobain. Skank it up in a
Bombay-Brummie style to the bhangramuffin of Apache Indian. Sway
reflectively to Mary-Chapin Carpenter's country-folk at Glasgow Royal
Concert Hall.
Additionally, dance afficionadoes will be catered for at the Volcano
by D Influence, and at the Tunnel by DJ Paul Oakenfold. Derby's
Renaissance club-night will also be visiting the Tunnel.
About-to-be-happening native bands will be promoted more
sympathetically, too. Instead of being banished to the empty wastes of
the SECC, as was the case one Mayfest, eight of the best emergent
Glasgow groups will be at Barrowland for Bucketful of Bands, which is
intended as a day-long mini-festival open to all age-groups and
featuring tasty ethnic fast-foods, plus crafts and record stalls.
My feeling is that Mayfest's presence as an inexperienced, one-off
bidder in the musical auction-ring has sometimes resulted in inflated
performers' fees being paid . . . and civic funding should always go to
subsidise audiences, not artists, of course.
As Stuart Clumpas confirms, this is what is happening this time
around. ''Mayfest money will be used to underwrite artistically valid
shows that might not sell, or to subsidise things which wouldn't
otherwise happen.''
In other words, pragmatism as the only way to avoid the nightmare
scenario of Mayfest no more.

THE face of Mayfest -- at least the musical face -- is about to change
dramatically. In recent years the classical music programme has become
almost a separate entity within the Mayfest programme.
It has also become more refined. High profile visiting artists have
been brought into the city, and there has been a conscious cultivation
of unfamiliar venues, from St Aloysius Church for choral concerts to the
disused St Andrew's Church for chamber music.
It is all about to be swept away. Paul Bassett, new director of
Mayfest, doesn't mince his words. ''There will be no imposed themes,
there will be no pigeon holes or divisions. In fact, there will be no
classical music programme as such.
''This is a change of direction,'' said Bassett. ''
On top of this, he next announced a virtual end to the importation of
visiting companies, stating that there would be a greater concentration
on indigenous resources.
So what does it all amount to? The first batch of programme
information to filter out of the Mayfest offices suggests an attempt to
broaden the appeal of music elements in the programme. Some of
Scotland's best bands will in fact appear (contrary to Bassett's
metaphorical declaration of ''no classical music programme'') but the
guise in which they appear is almost invariably not their familiar one.
The superb Chamber Group of Scotland, for instance, will appear at the
Cottier Theatre in Hyndland in a programme called Singing Outside Heaven
which will address the neglect of women composers through their music,
their letters, and their diaries. Novelist Janice Galloway will compile
the text.
From the intimate to the grandiose: to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of VE-Day, a performance of Benjamin Britten's War Requiem
will be staged in the Harland and Wolff shipyard. The BBC Scottish
Symphony Orchestra, with choir and soloists, will perform the work.
Inevitably, the Paragon Ensemble, one of Scotland's leading
contemporary music groups, get into the Mayfest act. But again,
everything -- from the venue to the type of show -- is different.
Paragon will have a residency in the King's Theatre for a week with
Terry Neason in a show entitled Over the Rainbow, to feature the songs
of Gershwin, Cole Porter, Sondheim, and Kurt Weill.
Two of Glasgow's smaller companies -- Opera on a Shoestring and Music
Theatre Lab -- will feature in Mayfest. The former, a team of young
professional opera singers, mostly out of the Scottish Opera Chorus,
will stage a fully costumed version of Verdi's La Traviata in Hyndland's
Cottier Theatre, which will be transformed into a Parisian salon for the
occasion.
Also at the Cottier, Music Theatre Lab will stage Marry Me a Little,
an anthology of Sondheim songs from his musicals (already seen at the
Tron).
There will be at least one significant visitor. Composer Michael Nyman
will bring his own band to Glasgow where they will give a concert at the
King's Theatre featuring his music from the film The Piano, and a
preview of his score for the new film Carrington, starring Emma Thompson
, which will later receive its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.
So will it work? The box office will tell. But the message seems to
be: don't expect the familiar.

Theatre
ON the evidence of this production by Empty Space Theatre Company one
can surmise that practice obviously does not make perfect. Ten of their
13 productions over the past nine years might be literary adaptations
but on the evidence of Julia Limer's stage version of Virgina Woolf's
brittle little novel it is clearly time for them to stop raking through
the library shelves.
The scope of this piece is confined by much more than the tight space
of the Citizens' Stalls Studio; the textual references are muddled, the
visual style is unadventurous, and the use of symbolism is
embarrassingly crude, with Mr Ramsey thrusting a metaphorical dagger
into his wife's heart and paper blows raining down on the heads of those
who commit social faux pas.
More cringe-inducing, however, are the musical interruptions, with
tediously repetitive, unharmonious, quasi-madrigals from the four cast
members padding out a script stretched so thin that great rents split
the first half open.
The second half is an even more insubstantial patchwork of jumbled
phrases, snatches of dialogue, and fey posturing.
Woolf's novel, all philosophical pondering and little action, does not
lend itself well to dramatisation and the company prove they do not have
the credibility or imagination to bring it to life. The end result is
little more than an unengaging recitation of empty words.

THE Grand Slam heroes of 1984 have all but left the field. Jim Calder
still turns out for one of the minor Stewart's/Melville teams, and I
suspect that fortysomething Alan Tomes is probably playing for Gatehead
Fell fourths or some such outfit while waiting for another Hawick
recall. But the rest of Jim Aitken's men have stopped making
appointments their bodies can't keep.
Not that they are gathered round any firesides or sat staring at the
box. Peter Dods, David Johnston, Keith Robertson, John Rutherford, and
sometimes Aitken himself are coaching, while David Leslie is an Under-21
selector and Roy Laidlaw a development officer of the SRU.
Euan Kennedy lends a hand with the kids at Myreside, ''Lucky'' Jim
Pollock is fighting crime, and Colin Deans pops up in the press box from
time to time. Whatever happened to John Beattie?
The latest to announce his retirement from playing is Roger Baird. On
Saturday he came off during the Watsonians 2nd's encounter with Stirling
County 3rds -- ''we showed them a trick or two'' -- having broken his
left wrist for the second time in as many years.
He talked to me as he was being chauffeured around the country as he
did his job as a grain merchant.
''I tackled a guy at the corner flag and we both fell on my wrist --
it was as simple as that. Gavin Hastings kindly ran me to the hospital
and I'm glad he did because it was like a war zone. If it had not been
for him I would probably be there still. When they saw him everybody
wanted to help.
''After discussions with my wife, Louise'' -- they have two children
-- ''we have decided that I will stick to touch rugby and maybe the odd
Golden Oldies game in future.'' Roger is 34.
He was a Rolls Royce winger capped out of Kelso at aged 21. Two years
later he was off to New Zealand with the British Lions, played in all
four Tests, and scored six tries on the tour.
One of life's great mysteries is how, in 26 appearances, he never
scored one for Scotland. (I actually believe he did and a referee
mistakely chalked it off). But his place in history was already assured.
Even before his side's Grand Slam triumph, Baird had galvanised the
Scottish team at Cardiff in 1982 by, rather like William Webb Ellis,
running with the ball. Wales were leading 3-0 when Baird fielded a kick
in his own 22.
The Welshmen expected a clearance to touch; instead Roger danced up
the line, found Iain Paxton, Tomes, and finally Jim Calder in support to
create a magical try. Scotland went on to score four more tries in a
34-18 victory, their first win at the Arms Park for 20 years.
''I was always a rotten kicker, particularly off my left foot, so it
was safer to run,'' said Baird.
As he takes his plaster to Murrayfield on Saturday what is he
expecting from his successors in the blue shirts? ''I believe we are
going to beat Wales,'' he declared.
''At the start of the season I was one of the leading Doubting
Thomases, and the South African result did little to change my opinion.
I thought we might beat Ireland but nobody else.
''It was not just the victory in Paris which has changed the mood it
was the manner in which it was achieved, the way we used our backs in
particular. To come from behind twice at Parc des Princes is something
else.''
Baird is quick to praise the man occupying his old spot on the left
wing. ''The jury was still out on Kenny Logan at the start of the season
-- there is no doubt about the verdict now. He is a really strong boy
with a great deal of determination.
''Up front I think the play of Peter Wright has been a revelation and
has certainly helped Kenny Milne. Damian Cronin's comeback has been
significant; I hope he can be fit for the England game.
''Most of all I am pleased for Gavin. He deserves all the breaks for
the effort he has put in over the years.''
Dare we believe we could beat England? ''I cannot spot any obvious
weakness in their side,'' replied Roger, ''but they could beat
themselves, they have done that before.''
The boy who started as a scrum half in the Scottish Schools team and
once won three Border sprint titles in an afternoon is moving out of the
fast lane. ''I've been all over the world and I have had a wonderful
time.''
This game can still be a lot of fun.

Theatre
THE oldies definitely have it. Harry Secombe's buoyant performance as
the title character in Pickwick was the only thing that kept last
night's dull and overlong musical from going under.
This musicalisation of The Pickwick Papers lacks the charm of other
Dickens adaptations: Pickwick has none of the heartwarming
sentimentality of Scrooge or the poignancy of Oliver.
The plot -- which unfolds in flashback -- is extremely garbled and
overpopulated. None of the characters really makes a sufficient
impression to muster much concern from the audience.
Albert Jingle (Michael Howe), although an arrogant pain in the neck,
is at least recognisable throughout (he even has a theme song); but the
best non-Secombe performance comes from David Cardy as Samuel Weller.
Cardy -- a comic cross between a grown-up Artful Dodger, Tommy Steele,
and a cockney-accented Dick Van Dyke; with a penchant for wiggling his
rear-end at the audience -- was especially delightful and impressive on
his featured number, Talk, and a duet (with a certain Katy Secombe)
called Learn a Little Something.
Any memorable moments last night came courtesy of Mr Secombe. To be
more specific: they came courtesy of Mr Secombe's Goon-like clowning.
At various points Secombe lost the place with, or temporarily departed
from, the script (not a bad move) and ad-libbed to hilarious effect with
sidekick Cardy, prompting an infuriated Ruth Madoc (as Mrs Bardell) to
urge them to ''get a move on''.

NINE MONTHS ago they travelled to Athens, the two best teams in
Europe, maybe the world, to meet in the final of the Champions Cup.
Tonight they go into the quarter finals of the same competition with
decidedly shaky reputations, facing up to the genuine possibility that
they will become yesterday's men before another fortnight has passed.
AC Milan, winners of that final by 4-0, and Barcelona, are on trial in
a fashion that seemed inconceivable less than a year ago. Arguably the
two biggest clubs in the world, their fortunes have fluctuated
alarmingly since that disappointing (from a Spanish and neutral
viewpoint) contest in Greece. Milan, who meet Benfica of Portugal in the
San Siro tonight in their first leg quarter final, have slipped down the
chute of the Serie A in direct parallel with the political fortunes of
their multi-millionaire owner, Silvio Berlusconi, who went the way of
most Italian presidents when he was unseated from power a few months
ago.
Barcelona, who managed to lift themselves to memorable heights one
more time, when they trounced Manchester United 4-0 at the Nou Camp in
their Champions League section, have tumbled down the quality ladder
again and now take on the new star turns of France, Paris St Germain,
the only team to have achieved a 100 per cent record in the league
segment of the tournament.
The Barcelona-St Germain tie is the one chosen by ITV to screen in
Britain and promises to be exceptional, even if it might provide a
painful reminder that standards in this country have a long way to
climb.
Barcelona, who boast 100,000 season ticket holders and perhaps the
most adoring and critical fans in the world, are managed by the ever
confident Johan Cruyff. They suffered embarrassing defeats in the cup
and league at home after the winter break but have recovered a little,
although they are still five points behind Real Madrid in the table.
When they trounced Manchester United they were inspired by the
brilliance of the Bulgarian, Hristo Stoichkov, and the Brazilian,
Romario.
The eccentric Romario, once described by Bobby Robson, who was his
manager at Eindhoven, as the most difficult player he had ever dealt
with, has since returned to Rio and Flamengo after a #2m transfer and
Cruyff's plans have not been helped by the long term injury which is
keeping another of his foreign stars, Romanian Georghi Hagi, out of
action.
Cruyff was in his usual optimistic mood, however, after his side's 2-1
win over Compostela at the weekend, saying: ''It is the right moment to
be going back into Europe. The cup is coming at a good time.'' The
Dutchman, who is 49 and has recovered well from a heart attack, is
rumoured to be committed to bringing one of his Holland international
successors, Denis Bergkamp, to Barcelona for next season.
He will also be without key midfield player, Miguel, tonight and that
will place even more responsibility on the volatile Stoichkov. The
European Player of the Year for 1994, Hristo is blessed with an
astonishing talent but a brooding temperament. The world, it seems, has
conspired to make life difficult for the Bulgarian.
Yet, when he is mentally in tune, he is unquestionably one of the best
players on earth.
If the reputation St Germain bring to the Nou Camp stadium tonight is
accurate, Stoichkov will need to be in the mood. To go through a group
which included Bayern Munich, Spartak Moscow and Dinamo Kiev whithout as
much as a draw to hinder their progress was quite an achievement. The
Paris side scored 12 goals in the section and lost only three,
statistics which suggest they have got it right.
Their inspiration has been the former African Footballer of The Year,
George Weah, who comes from Liberia and went first to Monaco six years
ago. He cost Monaco #75,000 but when St Germain beat a queue of Italian
clubs to his signature two and half years ago they had to pay close to
#4m for him.
He is another of the great eccentrics, spending much of his time in
the city he loves most, New York. He owns four houses, one of them a
ranch, and declares that he will live out his life with his wife and
children there once he leaves football. He is not short on self esteem,
either . . . ''My team mates love me,'' he said three months after his
transfer from Monaco, ''I had the impression they were waiting for me.''
He could be right. The powerful striker scored six goals in the
Champions League and at 28 is probably approaching his peak.
No French team has ever won the Champions Cup, although the St Etienne
side of the seventies came close, but the time may be ripe for that to
change.
The Paris side are joint second favouites overall for the competition,
alongside Milan, but behind Ajax, the remarkable Dutch team who keep
producing great players and fine teams. It is a long time since the
Amsterdam club won the Champions Cup, 1973 in fact, but in recent times
they have lifted the UEFA Cup (1992) and the Cup-winners Cup (1987).
There are some Dutch observers who believe Ajax will be some kind of
super team next year, when some of their thrilling young players are a
bit more mature, but lads like 18-year old Patrick Kluivert and another
18-year-old, Clarence Seedorf, have already shown immense self assurance
and, in any case, the Ajax system is such that the conveyor belt of
talent forces young hopefuls to mature quickly. There are replacements
down the line.
With men like Frank Rijkaard, Frank de Boer, and Finnish
internationalist Jari Litmanen lending their considerable experience,
Ajax look a formidable lot, an opinion shared by the bookies who make
them 4-1 on to beat Hajduk Split in Split tonight.
Considering all that has been happening in their homeland, the
Croatian side showed admirable application to qualify for the quarter
finals and in striker Ivica Mornar have a player who has impressed
watchers from other European centres.
They have nothing to lose, unlike AC Milan, who could be out of Europe
altogether next season. They are only fifth in Serie A and might not
reach a UEFA Cup place, which is why the holders of the Champions Cup
are anxious to recover their best form away from the league rigours.
Like all champions, they have the knack of coming good when it matters
and, after their 3-1 win over Cremonese on Saturday, are in confident
mood. ''We are ready for Benfica now.'' said coach Fabio Cappella. The
Italians have held the upper hand against the famous Portuguese side on
the two occasions they have met, the 1963 Champions Cup final at Wembley
and the 1990 Champions Cup final in Vienna.
Benfica, who won 3-0 at the weekend, lie third in the Porguese first
division behind Porto and will lean heavily on two South American
strikers to beat the Italians. Top scorer Isais Soares and World Cup
star Claudio Caniggia are the men who could cause Milan most problems.
IFK Gothenburg, the team who might be termed the most efficent in the
last eight, travel to Munich to meet Bayern in their opening leg. They
will be as quietly confident as ever, that being the Swedish way, and
many foreign eyes will be watching their teenage star Jesper Blomqvist,
who includes Rangers among his admirers, the man who dumped Manchester
United in the league stage.
Bayern have recovered from the mediocrity that was largely a result of
many injuries and are chasing Borussia Dortmund, albeit at a seven-point
distance, in the Bundesliga. They have lost their captain and major
influence, Lothar Matthaeus, through injury but his deputy, sweeper
Thomas Helmer, has been impressive and, in fact, scored in the 2-2 draw
with Freiburg at the weekend.
They might still find it difficult to set up a big enough lead to take
to Gothenburg in a fortnight when all of these eight teams will have to
settle their immediate European future . . . and the financial jackpot
that goes with reaching the semi-finals.

Dance
I DON'T know whether to laugh or seethe at this one. Pretend that
something as truly awful as this Nutcracker really doesn't matter, or
confront the reality -- and the insidious effect -- of what Vienna
Festival Ballet offers trusting audiences.
Actually I reckon I have glimpsed ballet hell. A badly-lit limbo where
the racked bones of great works are bundled into tacky costumes and then
made to look even shabbier by performances of stalwart mediocrity and
lumpen approximation. All shovelled on stage to the shrilling of a taped
score that occasionally breaks up, crackles, and distorts. The whole
evening is an offence against dance values and audience goodwill.
The company -- who do not really hail from Vienna -- seem to embrace
two extremes. There are the fresh-faced, eager, and largely
inexperienced brigade who pour a great deal of energy into getting
things not quite right. In fact the choreography, such as it is, doesn't
give them all that much to do. Even so they manage to make it look messy
with good intentions. Alongside them are the supposedly experienced
troupers. There's a distinctly variable range of skills parcelled out
among them -- one has the jump, another has the turn, another has the
ability to lift. Nobody seems to have the full house here. My act of
charity here is not to single out any names. Really someone should ring
the curtains down on this lot -- except, of course, some of the company
are already wearing them as costumes.

RICHIE Dixon, Scotland's assistant coach with primary responsibility
for honing forward play, has kept the faith. He has had a rock-strewn
furrow to plough since he joined the Scottish coaching team on the
Australian tour in 1992.
But on Saturday against Wales, Dixon's new model Scottish pack will
seek to tame the Welsh dragon and lay the foundations for a Grand Slam
showdown with England on March 18.
Five weeks ago, such a resurgence in Scotland fortunes seemed
unlikely. The string of nine games without a win came to an end against
Canada on January 21. That was the game, too, when the wraps came off
Dixon's blueprint for a post-rucking Scottish style. And it worked, too,
first time out of the box.
The ruck, the whole ruck, and virtually nothing but the ruck has
served Scotland well over the past decade. The SRU's director of rugby,
Jim Telfer, in his glory days as Scotland coach, had been the
arch-disciple of the rucking game. It was fashioned on the All Black
model and in its time and in its place it was a wonderful sight.
Then came the ''use it or lose it'' ruck-maul law and last September's
International Board modification which, in the maul at any rate, still
placed the emphasis on attacking teams recycling possession before the
the whole thing ground to a juddering and unsatisfactory halt.
Dixon and senior coach Dougie Morgan went in search of a formula which
would provide a more dynamic game. They wanted the ball kept alive and,
in ''live'' practice sessions, their charges were instructed to move the
ball from A to B without a pause.
Players were encouraged not to take the instinctive route and look for
an opponent on which to set up the ruck. Forwards and backs were obliged
to think on their feet and to determine whether going to ground was the
best option and, if not, to choose the exact moment in which to lay-off
the ball in a contact situation.
The dark days of defeat are now receding into the distance but Dixon
does not hide the fact that they were difficult and trying times.
''Yes, it has been difficult,'' he said, ''but if you believe in
something then it's always worthwhile putting up with it. I'm a fairly
level-headed person and I never really let it get me down although we
did get the letters and the phone calls.
''But despite the results we never lost hope. We always knew that it
would come right and that when it did, it was liable to do so in a rush.
If you examine last season's games then, OK against New Zealand we were
never in it, but against Wales we were there or thereabouts for long
enough until they ran away at the end.
''We drew against Ireland and against England we lost by the single
point from Jon Callard's penalty goal.
''For long enough we had a team with two ends and no middle. We had
none of the middle range of caps which are so vital if a team is to
succeed. There is no substitute in international rugby for experience.
Now that is coming.''
Dixon maintains that this team, beginning with the nine changes after
the game against South Africa in November, now has an indomitable esprit
de corps which has seen them through wins over Canada, Ireland, and
France.
The coaches are determined to hand the players the gift of
decision-making on the field of play and to make them individually
responsible for making calls that count in the course of a game.
Throughout the international game this is not always the case, and often
players are sent out with hidebound instructions to which they will
adhere, or esle.
''We like to give the boys a framework in which to work but have them
thinking, thinking all the time throughout a game. Gavin is the captain
and he's fully tuned in with what we're about and Rob Wainright is
calling the shots at the lineout.''
Dixon, principal teacher of guidance at Currie High School who is on
secondment with Lothian Regional Council in the much-needed role of
fostering rugby in the state education sector, learned his coaching
trade with Scotland Under-21 and Scotland B.
He captained Scotland B on his three appearances in 1978 and '80. The
6-3 win against France B in 1980 was a particularly significant win, the
Frenchmen having won six of the seven previous encounters between the
two countries.
Dixon played out of the Jordanhill club, first as a centre and, later,
as a wing-forward. In fact such was his versatility that he played in
every position in the forwards save the front row. He was also a
stalwart of the Glasgow side before his playing career was brought to a
premature halt by a bad leg break.
During his days with Scotland B, his coach was Jim Telfer. The pair,
not dissimilar in appearance, were often mistaken one for the other.
Dixon likes to tell the tail of how he led Scotland B to a 20-13 over
their Irish counterparts at Lansdowne Road in 1979. In the team hotel
after the game, he bumped into an Irish selector.
''Ah Jim, I thought your boys played really well today. In particular
that Richie Dixon had a really good game,'' said the confused Irishman.
Dixon takes up the story: ''I said to him that I very definitely
agreed. Dixon, I said, had played a stormer and was very definitely one
for the future. We were on our way down the stairs and Jim was coming
down in the lift. When the three of us arrived in the foyer, the
Irishman did a double and triple take. To this day I don't think he
knows which one of us was which.''
Similar confusion within Welsh ranks at Murrayfield on Saturday would
do Dixon very nicely. Very nicely indeed.

CHANGES in the catering industry should provide added opportunities
for the British food supply industry, particularly British farmers, said
Food Minister Mrs Angela Browning in London yesterday.
Spending on eating out had increased three times faster than household
expenditure on food in the decade to 1993 and the gap between them was
closing rapidly, boosted by economic recovery.
But despite the economic picture the industry could not afford to rest
on its laurels and recent research had shown many caterers had problems
in trying to source a number of basic commodities from Britain, such as
potatoes, mushrooms, tomatoes and bacon.
''This presents an opportunity and a challenge,'' she told delegates
to a British Meat catering conference. ''The basic problem, readily
acknowledged by caterers, is that suppliers are not always aware of the
needs of the catering sector, and the absolute requirement for an
attractive price, the appropriate quality and consistency of supply.''
She called for more emphasis on the virtues of British cooking in the
tourist industry and more attractive learning material on British food
for catering students. With a reminder that the Ministry of Agriculture
was backing this catering initiative, she added: ''I would certainly be
very interested in supporting any sensible initiative in the industry
and would welcome any suggestions.''
Colin Maclean, director-general of the Meat and Livestock Commission,
pointed out that for every #1 spent by caterers on food, 27p went on
meat. ''By the end of the decade nearly one-third of all meat consumed
in the UK will be eaten out of the home.
''More people are eating more meat more often when they eat out of
home. They see it as a special meal and many caterers ensure that meat
plays not only a central role on the menu but that it is presented as an
enjoyable and satisfying special meal occasion.''
This was equally true throughout Europe. ''The work of the Scotch Beef
Club, for example, has been extremely successful and there are now some
600 restaurants in six European countries who boast of being members; a
prime example of a product world renowned for its quality.''
Top quality was a reflection of good animal welfare and in this
Britain led the rest of Europe. This provided an opportunity to switch
to and promote British meat.
''The obvious specific and current example is, of course, veal where
there is already significant evidence that people are switching to
British veal in what can perhaps be described as positive
discrimination. We at MLC have now developed a way to ensure that the
British welfare friendly produced veal eats just as well as the Dutch
product.''

HOME ownership is the blight of my generation. Our parents waited till
they got hitched, had sprogs, or had some cash stashed before they took
the bold step of signing on the dotted line -- but as soon as we get our
first pay packet we're racing off to the estate agents with cries of
''100% mortgage for first-time buyer, please'', with all the enthusiasm
and irresponsibility of a kid in a candy store.
Britain is consumed with the desire to become propertied, something
other nations simply find bemusing. Americans are laid back about
renting and Europeans are too busy quaffing espressos, playing jazz and
generally being sultry to bother saddling themselves with a 30-year
payment plan. But Scots seem to have taken to the maxim that an
Englishman's home is his castle with unbridled and inexplicable
enthusiasm. The principle that you should own your own bricks and mortar
is one of the few Thatcherite notions we have adopted wholesale.
While eighties woman was urged to be a free spirit and put off the
tyranny of marriage and motherhood for as long as was biologically
possible, she was ironically simultaneously urged to shackle herself to
the kitchen sink, albeit her very own kitchen sink, with matching
waste-disposal unit. The new definition of an independent woman is one
who owns everything lock, stock, and barrel, which in reality is being
up to your dazzlers in debt. A very unliberating experience.
I've just celebrated my 28th birthday by flitting to my tenth rented
accommodation in as many years, an event which brought about the usual
chorus of Why don't you buy? Exasperated, I explain that I might be
paying out more money than I would if I was mortgaged to the hilt, but
to me it's worth every penny; someone else organises the washing of the
windows and the cleaning of the close and if the white goods break down
it's their responsibility, not mine.
I'm not tied down and I can up bags and go whenever I want. I see
myself as an urban gipsy and like to think that wherever I throw my hat,
that's my home, although it's actually a case of wherever I throw my
three Transit vans and four carloads of stuff, including a substantial
hat collection, that's my home.
''Gonna stop moving flat,'' panted my friend Pam, lugging my CD player
up the new stairs. ''Gonna stop reading,'' said her press-ganged new
man, shifting my boxes of books and hoards of glossy magazines, which he
unceasingly hinted I'd be better off binning.
Aside from the financial considerations are the lifestyle
implications. Over the past three years I've watched in dismay as mates
trot off to surveyors, a move which presages the abandonment of previous
social life, a veritable end of innocence and the beginning of new
relationships with factors, electricians, and double-glazing salesmen.
Erstwhile fun chums suddenly turn into DIY bores. They become
obsessive zealots, convinced that they need to lavish hours of devotion
on their new responsibility. They eschew the comforts of wall-to-wall
carpeting for the penance of dawn-to-dusk sanding of floors and
stripping of doors, and valiantly start decorating their places with the
kind of relentless good taste, all Alessi kettles, Dualit toasters, and
restored ranges, that has you longing for a really naff feature
fireplace to spoil the effect.
As a toy a new flat is a very private thing; its pleasures truly can't
be shared. ''Oh wow, it's gorgeous,'' you tell the beaming house owners
when you pay your first visit, ''umm, yeh, really lovely, you must have
worked so hard on it''. They have, they assure you, and proceed to tell
you about it in brain-bamboozling detail, whipping out before and after
snaps of their abode, and detailing the intricacies of stencilling and
scumble-glaze techniques until your eyes glaze over and your feet get
itchy.
But there's no point proposing an outing to a club; they can't come
out to play because they are too skint from paying for acrylic eggshell
paint and too tired from staying up all night rag-rolling it on to their
freshly plastered walls.
While joints in Berlin are thronging with thirtysomethings who are
dancing their cares away and revelling in the last days of their youth
-- which, given due care and attention can be strung out somewhat --
their counterparts in Britain are sitting in front of their marble
mantelpieces, fretting about the bills.
I'm an eternal optimist. I place my faith in fantasies that one day I
will earn or win (yes, I'm a Lottery junkie) so much money that I can
simply buy a place with cash or afford to eke out my days in a Bohemian
suite in some hip hotel. It's a ridiculous gamble. I'll probably spend
my twilight years in a cardboard box ruing my mispent youth, but in the
meantime I'd really rather spend my money on clothes I won't wear,
holidays I don't enjoy, and nights out I can't even remember than pour
it into the yawning maw of a room of my own.

IT is 18 years since Tracy Austin graced Edinburgh's Craiglockhart
courts as a 14-year-old, but the former women's world singles No.1, it
was confirmed yesterday, will return this year, to compete in the Tennis
Legends event, from May 24 to 27.
The 32-year-old Austin, who numbers two US open titles among her
subsequent tournament victories, has collected more than $2m in
prize-money since her previous capital appearance.
Other stars confirmed for the legends event -- part of the Scottish
Lawn Tennis Association's centenary -- include Britain's Roger Taylor,
Indian veteran Vijay Amritraj, and Wendy Turnbull, who won 12 Grand Slam
doubles titles. Turnbull also played in the Scottish championships
during the late eighties.
When Austin last appeared, in 1977, the championships were on grass,
and the title was won by Martina Navratilova. Navratilova also is
expected to be back this year, in the World Doubles Cup, being staged at
the same time on the clay courts of refurbished #3m Craiglockhart
centre.
The doubles entry is to be confirmed by March 27, but the 4000
capacity centre seems guaranteed to sell out. Ticket inquiries can be
made on 0131 220 4349.

PETER Nicol is looking to the inaugural British Telesquash
Championships starting at the Skean Dhu courts, Dyce, on Friday and
Saturday to provide the perfect confidence booster at the start of the
most vital few weeks of the season.
The 21-year-old world No.5 from Inverurie is seeded second to the only
player in the world's top 10 that he has yet to beat, England's Peter
Marshall.
Nicol did win an exhibition match between the pair on the same courts
a year ago, and a repeat would set him up nicely for the potentially
lucrative programme of next week's Portuguese Open, the British Open and
then the British National championships.
Oban's Martin Heath, the ever improving world No.36, is Marshall's
first-round opponent, while Nicol meets Newlands' Irish internationalist
Steve Richardson.
A Scottish Women's Telesquash Championship is also taking place over
the two days, and the main interest will surround the comeback of former
Scottish champion, Alison Bowie. Draw:
Men -- P Marshall (England) v M Heath (Scotland); D Harris (England) v
S Parke (England); C Walker (England) v A Davies (Wales); P Nicol
(Scotland) v S Richardson (Ireland). Women -- C Waddell (Aberdeen) v W
Maitland (Westhill); A Bowie (Edinburgh Sports Club) v J Nicol
(Aberdeen).

<HEADLINE>Scottish farmers urged to be more internationally competitive World is the market</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH farmers must learn to think of the world as their market, not
just the United Kingdom or Europe, Mr Neil Taylor, European director of
the New Zealand Meat Producers' Board, told a farming conference in
Edinburgh yesterday.
''The farming operations which will survive into the next century will
need to be internationally competitive,'' he warned. New Zealand farmers
had shown that when necessary it was possible to ''get out there and
find profitable markets around the world''.
To achieve that kind of success on the world scene, however, it was
essential to improve products until they were the best around. ''There
are no prizes for being second. You have to be the best with the most
unique and sought-after product.''
For Scottish farmers the message was that they would have to be more
watchful of developments on the international scene than perhaps they
had been in the past, he told the audience at the conference, organised
by chartered surveyors D M Hall.
An example of the increasingly global nature of the food industry came
from Mr David Joll, managing director of Bernard Matthews, the dominant
player in the UK turkey products market.
When his firm diversified into lamb roasts in 1982 they went to New
Zealand for lamb supplies -- and imports from that source are currently
running at about #8m a year. Challenged as to why they had not opted for
home-produced lamb he said that no-one in this country was prepared to
take on the business.
''We were so busy boning turkeys we could not bone out lamb for
ourselves,'' he said. ''We approached Welsh Quality Lamb, the Scotch
Quality Beef and Lamb Association, the Meat and Livestock Commission,
FMC in Perth and North Devon Meat. No-one wanted to bone out and trim
lamb meat for us.''
By contrast, he said, the New Zealand Meat Board had been very keen
and had financed the construction of a factory to take on the work. His
company had since taken over ownership of the plant which still supplied
their lamb roasts.
On the question of quality standards, Mr Joll said that farmers had to
take the longer-term view on initiatives like the farm-assured quality
schemes. It was the wrong way round to think in terms of a premium price
from day one, he said.
''The premium will come -- but first you have to stimulate demand. We
often bring a product in at a special introductory price. Let the
customer appreciate the product first, then charge them. It is totally
wrong to try and charge them a premium price at the trial stage,'' he
added.

IN 1990, the last time Senator Jesse Helms ran for re-election in
North Carolina, he was well behind in the polls until he started
broadcasting a celebrated television commercial. It showed a pair of
hands, evidently belonging to a white man, crumpling a rejection slip:
the voice-over intoned, ''I'd been promised that job, but now they've
given it to a minority''.
''They,'' meaning those Democrats in Washington, had invented
''affirmative action'', which meant taking away jobs from white men and
giving them to lesser-qualified blacks. Helms carried the election and
now the attack on affirmative action has spread.
California's Governor Pete Wilson, a much more moderate and likeable
figure than Helms, is now vigorously promoting a measure that will
forbid discrimination in favour of anyone for reasons of gender or race,
the opposite of existing laws prohibiting discrimination against people
for those same reasons.
Removing affirmative action from the statute book, and from American
life, is on the Contract with America being pushed through Congress by
the Republicans. President Clinton, as usual, is caught in the middle.
As a ''New Democrat'', who realises that the old coalition of the
working-class, the poor and the under-privileged can no longer elect a
President, he wants to appeal to those middle-class voters who fear for
their jobs -- but he cannot afford to alienate his basic constituency.
Besides, as a good-government man, he can see the case for affirmative
action. But the debate is not being conducted on the question of what
may or may not be good for the country. It is an appeal to deeper and
more passionately held prejudices than that.
It would be nice if everyone were moderate and sensible and did not
try to rub opponents' noses in their defeat -- but, the world being as
it is, the formerly oppressed naturally seized the moment of their
liberation to do a little oppressing of their own.
Rush Limbaugh, the apostle of rabid conservatism on talk radio, refers
to the Femi-Nazis, meaning the most obdurate feminists. It is all very
unpleasant, but he has a point, or rather, he has discovered a cause
with some validity that appeals to huge numbers of people.
Feminists have won many victories in the past generation, and the
country is therefore a better place. What is more, there are still
bastions of male prejudice and bigotry, mostly in private industry and
the professions, that continue to treat women as second-class citizens.
But many of the victorious feminists behave atrociously, abusing men as
a gender with the same fervour that they once suffered themselves.
The backlash against affirmative action is, as usual, being felt most
sharply by blacks. The word ''minority'' in that TV commercial meant
black -- everyone knew it without any need for explanation.
THERE are some cases where affirmative action is not only just, but
essential. No-one but a few dyed-in-the-wool, racist cops would deny
that big cities need more black police. Armed forces that include great
numbers of black service personnel need black officers. It is in the
public interest to have black lawyers and public officials. The country
is a far better place because room has been found for black
professionals and executives, who seem to do the job quite as well as
the whites they replaced.
The problems arise when very large numbers of people (and whatever
happens, there will always be more whites than minorities) come to
believe that they are suffering discrimination. They will no doubt admit
that blacks have suffered discrimination, and much worse than that, in
the past -- but deny that they were themselves in any way responsible.
Why should they be denied jobs now because America was a racist
society in the 1950s? The answer is that when there were jobs for
everyone, room could be made for minorities (and women) in the formerly
all-male workforce. But in these difficult times, when no-one's job is
safe, everyone feels insecure -- and will listen to Jesse Helms and Pete
Wilson and Newt Gingrich when they say that America should be
colour-blind and hire people on their merits, not on gender or race.
No doubt California voters will pass the proposition, and there will
be a new law in Congress limiting affirmative action, which Mr Clinton
will hesitate over, and finally veto. It might even pass over his veto,
with two-third majorities.
But the joke is that it is all too late. American business has
invested too much in affirmative action programmes, most of them
entirely voluntary, in an attempt to get a more diversified workforce,
to turn back now.

THOSE men who invariably know the score, the bookmakers, anticipate
only one home side losing in the first leg quarter finals of the
Champions Cup. The team who, they say, will not take a lead with them
into the return is Hajduk Split of Croatia who face up to the Dutch
champions, Ajax, in Split.
The others, AC Milan (v Benfica), Barcelona (v Paris St Germain) and
Bayern Munich (v IFK Gothenburg) are all odds-on to be in front when the
first 90 minutes are completed tonight. However, if it was that easy we
would all be enjoying some distant sunshine on the strength of the
jackpot we will collect tomorrow.
On recent form Bayern Munich, however formidable they are in their
Olympic Stadium, cannot be considered home and dry against the Swedes
who may not be the most fashionable side in the last eight but have
developed a habit of doing well against more fancied opponents. It would
not be a great surprise if they emerged with a draw, maybe even scoring
a vital away goal in the process.
Ajax, on their track record, are likely winners but Croatia, and Split
in particular, where they have loud and highly motivated fans, is not
the easiest of away venues for any team. However, Ajax look sure to get
through to the semi-finals and will probably set themselves up with a
victory, even if is narrow, tonight.
AC Milan would have been automatic choices not so long ago, especially
against Benfica, whom they have beaten on the only two occasions they
have met, but they are not sure of themselves any more and, if the
Portuguese can avoid losing an early goal they might frustrate the local
fans and thus upset the Italian side whose confidence does not need much
denting these days. In that scenario Benfica could steal a draw.
Paris St Germain have been the equivalent of a 'talking horse' since
the start of the season -- the team most talked about in
side-of-the-mouth conversations before the great Champions Cup race got
going -- and many people will fancy their chances of doing well in the
Nou Camp against Barcelona. The difficulty with that theory is the
intimidating atmosphere of that magnificent stadium.

DESPITE a hamstring injury in Stockholm two days ago, John Regis has
not written off hopes of bringing home the 200 metres title from the
World Indoor championships in Barcelona the weekend after next.
Regis was named yesterday in the 34-strong UK team, and chief coach
Malcolm Arnold is prepared to give Regis time. ''It depends how badly
the hamstring has gone,'' said Arnold. ''It looked a bit more than a
nick to me, but you have to trust their integrity. Knowing John as I do,
there is no way he will be competing if he is going to risk himself.''
Though Britain's only two world champions, Yvonne Murray and Tom
McKean, declined selection, Scotland will still be well represented.
Four Scots were named, the biggest surprise being 60m sprinter Aileen
McGillivray, of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, whose last appearance in a
British vest was nearly three years ago.
McGillivray, six-time Scottish 100m champion, though still just 24,
was third fastest of three Britons to achieve the qualifying time, and
only two per event can go. But Paula Thomas declined, and McGillivray,
to whom selection came as a total surprise, is delighted.
She has broken the Scottish record at 60m this winter -- a record she
shares with Melanie Neef -- despite having kept in heavy training.
Neef, chosen for the 400m after her third Scottish record at the
distance this winter, faces unexpected opposition. Irina Privalova, the
Russian European champion at 100 and 200m, intends to do the 400m in
Spain, which will mean reappraisal of aspirations for many in the event.
The two other Scots are also selected at 400m -- Brian Whittle for the
men's individual event, and Alison Curbishley in the women's relay,
making her UK senior debut at 18, having finished second for Britain in
the junior match against Russia and Germany last weekend.
Whittle is not certain to take up his place. ''I have a slight
abdominal tear, which is receiving treatment,'' he said last night.
''It's just one of a number of niggles in the past few weeks. None of
them is serious, but they've kept me from from racing and training
properly, and at 400m, if you're not 100% fit, you can look a right
prat.''
Ayr Seaforth's Whittle is as disappointed by Regis's injury as his own
setback. ''With John in the 4x400m squad, we would not just have won
gold, we had every chance of breaking the world record as well.''
Men. 60m: L Christie, D Braithwaite. 200m: J Regis or A Condon, S
Wariso. 400m: M Hylton, B Whittle. 1500m: A Whiteman, B Treacy. 3000m: J
Mayock. 60m hurdles: T Jarrett, B Taylor. High jump: D Grant, B Reilly.
Long jump: F Salle. Triple jump: F Agyepong. Heptathlon: A Kruger.
4x400m relay (from): Wariso, Condon, Hylton, Whittle, G Bullock, P
Slythe.
Women. 60m: S Douglas, A McGillivary. 200m: S Williams. 400m: M Neef,
S Earnshaw. 800m: A Hunte. 1500m: L Gibson. 60m hurdles: J Agyepong, S
Farquharson. Triple jump: A Hansen. Shot: J Oakes. 4x400m relay (from):

THE Scottish Amateur Rowing Association has tabled a motion to expel
the Clyde club from membership.
Clyde's members are banned from participation because of failure to
pay competition levies from last summer's regatta, and for the club not
paying its annual subscription for this year.
The expulsion move, to be considered at the Association's general
meeting later this month, is unprecedented and is being caused debts
estimated at #532.
While admitting liability and that the club is tight for cash, members
are expressing surprise at the speed with which events have moved. They
point to various Association member clubs that have hit financial
problems but have been given years of grace to resolve their problems.
Can it be that the well-known personal animosity between Association
president John MacDougall and Clyde president Ralph Gillies is colouring
the judgment of the Association's executive committee?
In the meantime, a group of active Clyde members are trying to put
together a rescue package.

THE Macallan Scottish championships start this evening, with the
winner going on to represent Scotland at next month's world
championships in Canada.
Favourite for the Perth event is Hammy McMillan, the European champion
and winner of last weekend's Macallan Challenge. But ironically his team
claimed the last qualifying place after having stuttered to near
disaster in the district playdowns and the repechage tournament.
However, by comparison with other well-known names such as 1991 world
champion David Smith and defending champion Colin Hamilton, neither --
of whom qualifed from district play -- McMillan has done well to make it
this far.
Most of the other nine teams involved, which include previous winners
Graeme Adam and Gordon Muirhead, may be upset by the attention being
given to this week's absentees and will go on to the ice eager to prove
that they are there on merit. However, most of them would admit that
McMillan is favourite.
His Stranraer team start their campaign against Perth's Warwick Smith.

GIVEN the travails of Barings -- the bank that likes to say ''oops''
-- certain advertising copywriters must now be wondering if their
exposure in the hyperbole derivatives market is as safe as the Bank of
England.
For example, only weeks before young Mr Leeson set to prove that money
isn't everything, a company called Eyretel, who produce digital voice
and data systems, ran an ad with the prescient headline: ''Recording
your dealing room transactions -- which system would you trust?''
The text went on, with a touching faith in the human bit of the
software: ''When markets are volatile and traders want to check their
deals, digitised logging makes retrieving individual calls simple and
fast . . . With dealing rooms required to record every transaction, DAT
technology and the E1000 is a marriage made in heaven. Can you afford to
make the wrong choice?''
We still have no idea what an E1000 is, but we have a pretty fair
notion of what Barings can and, as of this week, can no longer afford.
TADMUS merchant
PERHAPS the bankers could have done with a touch of TADMUS, otherwise
as Tactical Decision Making Under Stress, or blind panic to you and me.
That, and other esoteric aspects of business management, will be
discussed next month at the Fourth Offshore Installation Management
Conference organised by Aberdeen's Robert Gordon University.
Don't all rush at once, but the conference, entitled ''Effective Team
Working'', will also examine ''America's latest findings into skills for
leaders in industry'', team work culture, team work management, and so
forth.
For a really expert appraisal, however, the organisers have gone to
the very top.
As the press release, refusing to boast, puts it: ''Scotland's
national football team coach, Craig Brown, will talk on his experiences
managing an international sports team.''
A practical demonstration of TADMUS, then?
Rovers' corner
of history
STILL with football, of a sort, we see that the Glasgow University
(Association) Football Club, founded in 1877, has decided to celebrate
its centenary this year. The 18-year discrepancy is explained by the
varsity newsletter in terms familiar to all followers of the Scottish
game: ''After an impressive start which saw it provide three Scottish
internationalists, it fell into abeyance before a revival in 1895 . .
.''
We would like to be able to report that the club's subsequent history
has been a story of unbroken success. Sadly, the record shows otherwise.
Though they've won the Scottish Universities' Championship 18 times, and
even picked up the Scottish Amateur Cup in 1927, Glasgow has a few black
marks on the old escutcheon. Or as the newsletter diplomatically puts
it: ''The 15-0 defeat by St Mirren is recalled less enthusiastically
than the historic draw against Albion Rovers.''
Needless to say, it is news to football statisticians everywhere that
Rovers ever had a historic result of any description.
Saints alive
THE peace process has, naturally enough, excited a good deal of
comment over the water. Even before the framework document was published
in answer to a prayer from Ian Paisley, the Strabane Chronicle was
getting a little carried away by the news that Northern Ireland
Secretary Patrick Mayhew had met two Sinn Fein councillors.
''It was believed to be the first time any Secretary of State had met
with Sinn Fein at local government level,'' reported the Chronicle. ''On
that occasion St Patrick shook hands and exchanged greetings . . .''
You'll have
your tea
MEANWHILE, the Donegal Democrat, though as keen as anyone to see
peace, has not forgotten its basic duty as a newspaper. Reporting that
charges against a Killybegs man who was alleged to have assaulted his
cousin last year had been dropped, the Democrat gives a fascinating
insight into Irish family dynamics in its latest issue.
It seems that one Gerard O'Rourke told the court that he was going to
Killybegs on his motor bike and was passing one John O'Rourke's caravan
when the latter asked him in for tea. It was Christmas Eve, the court
heard, and John was only trying to be pleasant. Allegedly, it didn't
work out that way.
''I told him that I didn't want any tea,'' said Gerard, ''but he
followed me to Killybegs and hit me two boxes in the head at Sweet News
in the town.''
We had known that Irish hospitality can be lethal, but this seems
excessive even by Donegal standards. Case dismissed.
Ale and farty
REAL ale, it should be said, is not this Diary's cup of tea.
Nomenclature has something to do with it -- all those risible,
newly-invented rustic names -- though the belief that the stuff tastes
like tepid alcoholic broth is inhibition enough.
With such prejudice in mind, we make no comment on an advertising
feature published in the East Lothian Courier which states, en passant:
''Beers come to suit all tastes, but they also come with their very own
names, such as the high and mighty Emperor Ale, 5.2% from the Hadrian
Brewery, Newcastle. But who could order a pint of Old Fart in a busy
pub? Or the Crouch Vale Brewery beer known as Willie Warmer?'' A case,
we are sure, of a beverage reaching the parts other beers wouldn't touch
with a barge-pole.
A grave
situation
STILL in the Lothians, we stumble across a small, touching insight
into the human condition with the news that Midlothian District Council
has been obliged to reconsider its plans for a new cemetery at Loanhead.
No-one objected to the burial ground as such, but when it became clear
that it would run alongside the entrance to Loanhead Hospital, and that
not all the patients there are as young as they once were, the local NHS
trust felt obliged to intervene. Or as one official put it: ''A cemetery
coming up to a hospital which caters for elderly people is not an ideal
relationship . . .''
The council has since found an alternative site avoiding rooms with a
view, yet even this is not without problems. In fact, the local
community council has expressed serious worries over traffic congestion
in surrounding streets.
Any of the new graveyard's prospective customers in a tearing hurry to
get where they're going, please note.
Off on the
wrong foot
IN this diary we just report the tales and leave the jokes to take
care of themselves. Thus we can testify that a man really did enter the
University Community Hospital in Tampa, Florida, recently to have his
right foot amputated only to discover, when he awoke that his left foot
was gone. We have no wish to know, however, if he is now hopping mad.

BRIAN Sutherland has twin targets at Meadowbank this weekend -- to
retain the Scottish Under-18 title and to prove the sport in Scotland
has a bright future.
Doubts have been expressed about the ability of top Scottish
youngsters to make the step up. But Sutherland claims that he intends to
prove that wrong by becoming the first player since David Gilmour in
1990 to retain the Under-18 crown.
''I feel I can make the breakthrough and I think that goes for all of
the current Under-18 squad,'' said Brian. ''I'm playing well enjoying my
training, and I'm confident of doing well in Edinburgh.''
Of the other 36 players in the starting line-up, the main danger to
top-seed Sutherland should come from No.2 seed David Forbes.
In the girls' singles, Keri Weatherhogg, a former triple Under-16
champion, is favourite, while Kathryn Graham is No.2 seed.
In the girls' doubles, holders Jane Aitcheson and Sarah Smith are
expected to retain the title, and David Forbes and Ross Lethbridge and
Derek Bell and Natasha Murray are top seeds in the boys' and mixed
doubles respectively.

A BEAUTIFUL driveway gives an important first impression of your home,
and there's never been such a wide range of paving colours, shapes and
textures, all offering that vital combination of strength, durability
and good looks.
If you have room for a garage which will match and enhance your home
at the end of your driveway, then you have the ideal place to keep the
car safe and sound, and to provide additional storage space for freezer,
bicycles and do-it-yourself equipment. If you haven't got space for a
garage, then a carport or canopy will enhance both your garden and your
home, and there are reputable professional firms which specialise in
constructing both.
The top British housebuilders incorporate a pavoir driveway in their
new developments, recognising that the car is an integral part of
everyday life, and that the safest and most convenient place to keep it
is close to the house. Housebuilders have also noted how an impressive
driveway with a garage and carport at the end increases sales by adding
to the appeal of the homes they build.
The garden area is now seen as an extension of the home, and these
days many families take as much time and trouble over planning the
layout and facilities outdoors as they do indoors.
Carports and canopies can add an extra dimension to the garden,
drawing the eye and adding a ''full stop'' to the view, providing shade
and shelter and looking good with or without a covering of plants.
A pergola is one of the most versatile features that can be used in
the garden, giving instant height and providing valuable support for a
myriad of climbing plants. It can also hide unsightly views and provide
some privacy.
As well as providing a practical place to store the car, a carport,
canopy or pergola can create a stunning focal point in your garden.
Built next to the house, the pergola frame makes a good alternative
carport with a concrete, crazy paved or gravel base. Corrugated sheets
fitted to the frame will provide a weatherproof covering. A wooden
garden trellis added to the pergola posts can be used for training
roses, and your local garden centre will recommend climbing varieties
which have been bred to flower throughout the season.
A covered area outdoors, ideally located over a part of the patio, is
a stepping stone between house and garden, providing somewhere to sit,
eat out or sunbathe on sunny days and giving children a firm outdoor
play area. A specialist company will ensure that drainage is properly
taken care of, especially if the garden rises away from the house, and
check that the patio level will be at least six inches below the level
of the house damp proof course.
A raised brick planter, filled with an assortment of shrubs and
flowers, could be incorporated into the patio design, or even built up
against the side of a wall. Here again a professional firm will ensure
that the house damp proof course will not be adversely affected. Just
about every garden, whether large or small, will benefit from a raised
planter -- terraced levels of greenery create an effect that's
interesting on the eye and easier on the back.
The planter must be built on sturdy foundations sunk into the ground,
and if your garden is on a slope, a level foundation area will have to
be excavated. Four horizontal courses of bricks and a top row of
vertical or ''soldier'' bricks will bring the planter up to an ideal
height for variegated plants, but if you plan to plant large shrubs or
tall grasses, you may prefer to have just two or three horizontal
courses. You can incorporate a seating frame with a storage space
underneath where you can store small garden tools into your brick
planter. Site it in the best suntrap your garden has to offer.
You might consider locating some plant tubs or a rotary clothes line
close to your patio and carport, or siting a garden pond nearby. A pond
is an attractive feature in any garden, and once stocked, needs little
attention to keep it lively and interesting. The shape of the pond,
whether formal or informal, can be selected to match the style of the
rest of the garden, and a reputable firm will help you select a position
where it can be drained without affecting the foundations of your home.
Exactly where you put your pond depends to a large extent on what is
already in your garden. Keep it away from overhanging trees and shrubs
-- dead leaves falling in autumn will soon fill up the pond and foul the
water. Shade also encourages the growth of algae, turning the water a
murky green, so make sure the pond benefits from plenty of sunlight --
at least half a day's worth. It is also best to site the pond where it
is protected from cold northerly and easterly winds, using shrubs and
brick planters to protect exposed sides and add visual interest.
Perhaps you would like to add to the amenity of your garden by
including a sandpit or climbing frame in your plans. It's often a
problem finding a safe area for adventurous children to play and
explore. If you have a tree in your garden, you can have the climbing
frame anchored to the trunk, making a climbing frame and tree house in
one.
On the
house
INSTEAD of repairing and repainting the outside of your house every
few years, you might consider a more permanent finish.
Bestex of Bonnybridge has an exterior coating which is spray applied
under high pressure, giving a finish up to 20 times thicker than
conventional paint, and is guaranteed for 15 years.
The company will arrange free inspections. Telephone 0324 815557.

WHAT is wrong with the social work profession? We have seen over
several years, and in different parts of Britain, a series of tragic
blunders which points to something deeper going on than the bungling of
individual social workers.
Perhaps the law is at fault, since none of this was done without due
process. The law can be improved, as it has been improved in England and
is being improved in Scotland. But we cannot legislate for attitudes.
The law, while it checks the excesses of public officials armed with
statutory powers, cannot cure them of a desire to go about their
business in a way they define for themselves.
The air of injured innocence still emanating from what Sheriff Miller
called the ''officers or higher ranks'' in the Ayrshire case suggests
they are far from cured of that desire. Note this comment, ''Certainly,
with our knowledge now, the investigations would have been done
differently'' there is here no sense of anything having been wrong in
the nature and purpose of the investigations from the start.
We have social workers because we have social problems. Though our
fathers had social problems, too, they knew of no such persons. The
minister, the policeman, the neighbours, provided social sanctions
effective to an extent unthinkable today in sustaining the social bonds;
ministers can only preach, policemen scarcely have time for anything but
the worst crimes. Prudent parents never let their children out of sight.
The danger and fear are hard to quell because they see, to spring from
the moral decline of our society, the degeneration of standards that
once made most people, by contrast, safer and happier in a generally
decent world. If society is in that sense to blame, it might be natural
to conclude that social work can do something to cure the condition.
Perhaps so, yet there are greater risks in setting up public officials
as experts in danger and fear, as we may see from one curious common
thread in a number of those tragic blunders. It is a mystery why
exactly, sometime around 1990, the social work profession persuaded
itself that there was in this country an upsurge of satanism, emerging
in the abuse of children and other horrors.
The profession's collective consciousness was apparently fostered in
seminars on the subject, alerting social workers to what they should
look for. Once alerted some found all too easily what they sought.
But where did the idea ever come from? If there is any general social
trend in religious conviction, it is towards secularism and
indifference. Now that so few people believe in God, it is hard to
imagine that many believe in his opposite.
You would have scanned in vain newspapers, journals, books, or any
normal objective source of information on this otherwise unlikely turn
of events. Sheriff Miller could only discover a ''fashion'' for thinking
it was underway. Some say it all came from America. A sensible person
could be forgiven that it was mere mumbo-jumbo which put social work and
satanism on much the same intellectual level.
It is hard to escape a second conclusion, that social workers are
unable to sort good evidence from bad evidence, possess no means of
telling what is reason and what his rubbish, because they have no sound
framework in which to order their thoughts. Social work does not rest on
theory, unlike economics, education, or even sociology. It rests only on
the assumption that, given the existence of social problems,
intervention by agents of the state can cure them.
It is in fact outdated in a time when we have rediscovered that the
individual citizen may actually know better than the state where his
interests lie. The profession was created in a time when the opposite
assumption prevailed, that the state knew all things better than the
individual citizen, and with this superior body of knowledge, accessible
to its own servants alone, it could direct the rest aright.
It survives now because it has become institutionally enshrined, in
local authorities and training establishments. When the profession
realises, as it must, that in truth that it has no superior body of
knowledge, it has to find something, invent something, import something
second-hand from America, which it then sets out to vindicate through
the self-serving inquiries and actions of its own members. In the
process it can close its mind so completely that even the tragedies it
causes, and the just censures they call down, do not dent its
complacency.
At any rate, it has not found out how to cure social problems. This
need not itself be laid at the door of social workers whose efforts,
misconceived in the way I have set out, can never be more than a feeble
antidote to moral decline. The decline is not universal, but it is to be
seen on every hand, not least in the withering of churches, charities,
schools, and the like, where citizens could once cultivate a moral
sense.
But from the private fear the moral sense has not yet been banished.
The last place where it can really be cultivated, though even there to a
lesser extent than before, is in the family. Some unfortunate families
are destructive to one another, but the vast majority of them still pass
on decent standards down the generations. That is why, unless in proven
cases of overwhelming necessity, social workers should not be allowed to
separate families, to break parents' hearts, and to blight children's
lives.

Ross Finlay enjoys the purr of two new big cats
INTRODUCING the subject of the entry-level 3.2-litre XJ6, I was going
to float a theory that Jaguar has at least one advantage in prestige
terms compared with its obvious competitors from Stuttgart and Munich.
This was that, whereas drivers of the top models in those rival ranges
may be peeved that lesser mortals with a lot less than #20,000 to spend
can motor behind the same badge, new-Jaguar owners are seen to be people
with more than #30,000 to invest.
The theory crumbled to dust when I belatedly noticed that the standard
XJ6 3.2 costs #28,950. Even the Sport version with modified suspension,
wider tyres, alloy wheels and so on is in the showrooms at just #1000
more.
Lacking an over-lavish budget, the company's now Ford-financed
designers simply refined the familiar body shape. Whoever misguidedly
put rectangular headlights into the previous series has been sent to the
salt mines. You can tell from the admiring glances they still attract
that Jaguars have lost none of their visual appeal.
In first of all an ordinary 3.2 and then a Sport, I noticed that
Jaguar now really has upgraded its quality control to the levels it
promised but never consistently achieved in the 1980s. Ford has forced
this through, and I am certain that ''forced'' is the operative word.
American-imported factory managers are no shrinking violets.
Jaguar built 30,000 cars last year, almost three in four for export,
and it is curious that the world's biggest Jaguar dealer is in Detroit.
Curious, because these cars have European road manners, a lack of
lounging room inside and, even with space-saver spare wheels, much less
than American-style luggage space in the boot.
However, they look marvellous, and the interiors simply ooze class in
a way which the Germans, for all their excellent engineering, have never
been able to match. You cannot get into one of these saloons without
feeling relaxed and at ease simply by doing so. There may be glaring
exceptions, but this is the kind of car which ought to bring out the
best manners in its driver.
The Sport I drove had an all-black finish which looked terrific. There
are many neat exterior details, like the fact that you simply touch the
discreet rear Jaguar badge to operate the electric lock in the boot lid.
But I feel that the single, fixed-blade front wiper remains a great
disappointment, both in looks and in effectiveness.
Rear seat space is poor for the class. However, the longer-wheelbase
versions coming later in the year should interest additional buyers.
The 3.2 produces 219bhp from its all-alloy engine. The
automatic-transmission Sport will reach 60mph in about nine seconds,
pour on the torque in mid-range, and reach a test track maximum just
short of 140mph. Official figures suggest an overall fuel consumption
around 26mpg, although in a four-figure mileage I never saw the trip
computer get beyond 23mpg and a decimal point.
The 3.2 is an excellent motorway car, with low levels of road noise,
but it is lively and responsive elsewhere. On roads like the Snake Pass
in the Peak District, I thought it handled with a most agreeable
''flow''. It responds best to smooth transitions, either from lock to
lock, or when braking, or when feeding in the power.
I can see the attraction, for some drivers, of the Sport specification
but there is a certain trade-off in terms of ride. Even if my original
theory about Jaguar saloons turned out to be a lot of nonsense, another
one is fermenting away. Much though I covet a supercharged XJR or a
#59,950 Daimler-badged V12, pound for pound the ordinary 3.2 at less
than half that price may be the best buy.

THE ultimate arrogance from the tedious Stewart Lamont -- he not only
thinks of himself as being a prophet but one just short of being on a
par with Isaiah (February 25).
He also has a strange concept of freedom. Surely the whole point of
being a democracy is centred on expressing an individual belief, which
then leads to a corporate expression of concern resulting in some kind
of action.
The fact that Stewart Lamont does not agree with it does not make it
any less valid. He refers to ''the wicked using rights as a kind of
oppression to others''. He then refers to ''the perfect illustration of
this as the anti-motorway and animal rights groups''.
He also has a strange concept of evil if he thinks these people
represent a perfect illustration of wickedness.
Stewart Lamont also suggests they should be ''herded into prison
camps'', perhaps echoing the chilling thoughts of someone else who had
illusions of grandeur and thought he had the final solution.
Stewart Lamont is perhaps more narrow-minded than unaware, perhaps
more naive than insensitive, but he fails to acknowledge that there are
people who care about issues enough to protest and not just pontificate,
enough to march and not just moan, enough to speak for those who cannot
speak for themselves.
I just hope it's Isaiah I meet on the mountaintop, and that Stewart
Lamont is somewhere in the snowdrifts.

IN your report ''Pupils petition school in bid to join M77 protest
camp'' (February 17), Councillor Sheridan is quoted as having said:
''There's no way anyone in their right minds should be condemning
youngsters for taking a positive part in their own lives. We should be
applauding them for coming down here and defending something that is
precious to them.''
I fear he must be taking leave of his senses. Surely it is cracking
the thin ice of responsibility for Councillor Sheridan to be encouraging
schoolchildren to mill around a construction site: it will deprive them
of their education and may endanger their safety.
I am coming to the conclusion that more damage will be done to the
ecology of planet earth by the protesters than by the motorway per se.
The driving of spikes into trees by those who claim to be the voices of
the trees does not exactly balance, and surely the hot air billowing
from protesters' mouths is creating more global warming than the fumes
from vehicles ever would.

RE the report on ethnic bias regarding places offered to students at a
number of academic institutions (February 24).
One presumes that it was compiled by the same Dr Sam Everington who
not long ago attempted to imply a similar ethnic bias against doctors
from certain minorities in their applications for partnerships in
general practice.
His ''findings'' in that area were somewhat discredited when it came
to light that a not inconsiderable part of his data came from
applications for posts made by himself under assumed names.
The institutions criticised may consider it worth while to invest some
time in checking the applications which they have rejected to ascertain
how many of them were from people who actually exist.

GLENMORANGIE distiller Macdonald Martin has appointed Peter
Darbyshire, who has spent his career promoting high-profile whisky
brands worldwide, as managing director.
Mr Darbyshire, whose appointment was announced yesterday, will lead
the refocused distillers' growth plans.
The seat he will take up in late April or early May has been vacant
since the unexpected departure of Neil McKerrow last June, with the
breach being temporarily filled by chairman Geoffrey Maddrell.
Macdonald Martin Distilleries is keen to utilise capacity by pushing
its blends in newer markets, such as India and China, moving away from
bulk sales by putting more of its whisky into bottles and cases itself.
Highland Queen is already selling in India.
A lot of effort will also be put into the promotion of its flagship
Glenmorangie single malt and other high-profile products in export
markets.
Mr Darbyshire, 44, started out as a member of the successful team
which established J &amp; B as a major brand. He then led the expansion of
Famous Grouse into export markets.
More recently, as managing director of The Drambuie Liqueur Company,
he has been credited with giving Drambuie a global image.
During the past year, Macdonald Martin, whose product range includes
Glenmorangie's single malt stablemate, Glen Moray, has initiated a
comprehensive review of strategy.
The Leith-based company aims to boost sales, increase margins and
reduce costs.
Mr Maddrell said: ''I have no doubt that Peter will make an invaluable
contribution to the resurgent Macdonald Martin. We know exactly where we
want to go and he is important in helping us get there.''

MR WHITTLE is correct in stating that the ratio of revenue from road
taxation to infrastructure costs in 1994-5 is more than four to one
(4.5:1), but this is only for cars and light goods vehicles (February
22).
The average ratio of revenue to costs is less than three to one
(2.9:1) for all road vehicles. However, he has forgotten to take into
account the full economic costs involved.
These include the public sector costs of policing and providing
emergency services that are essential to safe motoring; the cost of
damage to the local environment caused either by the construction or
existence of transport infrastructure or by the use of vehicles; the
cost of the additional time taken for journeys when congestion occurs;
the environmental damage to the wider community such as air pollution
and global warming; and the costs of accidents such as injuries to
pedestrians and the grief of relatives.
The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution estimates the
environmental costs of the transport systems (1994-5) to be between
#10.9bn and #20.5bn per year, of which 90% is attributable to road
transport. This cost includes noise and vibration, air pollution,
climate change, and accidents.
As a percentage, the tax revenue from road users in relation to
quantified environmental and public costs is between 98% and 152% for
car users, but between 81% and 121% overall.
So, if the upper end of the range of environmental costs is used, then
tax revenue is roughly equal to the total costs of road use. When
further unquantified costs of losses of land and access to land, visual
intrusion, severance of communities, and loss or disruption of habitats
are taken into account then the road user is clearly not paying his way.

THOSE looking for a high-quality engineering company with over 63% of
production exported should give County Durham-based Domnick Hunter a
glance.
It specialises in air filtration equipment sold to the electronics and
pharmaceutical companies which can produce air one million times cleaner
than normal as well as providing the ability to purify liquids such as
water, wine and soft drinks.
Last year, it increased turnover by 19.9% to #36.7m and pre-tax
profits by 31.6% to #5.6m.
Executive chairman Brian Thompson said yesterday that orders in the
first two months of the current year are ahead by 20% with significant
new business in China, Korea, the Philippines and Japan as well as in
South Africa.
The #1.7m acquisition a year ago of Nitrox has brought in a carbon
molecular sieve process which filters out gases such as oxygen for
processes where high-quality nitrogen is required.
Hunter spends about 4% of turnover on research and development and is
currently in the middle of a #3m extension to its Team Valley factory.
It has increased the workforce by 10% to 600 in the last year while it
is cash positive.
Sales this year should approach #44m which points to pre-tax profits
of just over #7m which would leave the shares at 249p trading at 20
times prospective earnings.
The company, which was part of the Walter Alexander group, came to the
market 11 months ago at 200p and it seems virtually certain to continue
to outperform.
There is a 3p final dividend for a 4p total for a 2% yield.

EDDIE FOSTER, in support of the West Highland rail line, states that
''the A82 north of Tarbet as far as Inverarnan is as bad as you can
get'' (February 21). He implies strangulation by caravans in the tourist
season and great frustration by articulated lorry drivers.
Does he really believe that these vehicle drivers will choose rail?
They will simply go by the best detour or stay away, to the detriment of
the Highland economy. Attacking roads will not help the cause of rail.
Mr Foster might reflect that if the many millions of taxpayer
subsidies given over the years to the West Highland line could have been
devoted to West Highland roads there would have been great benefit to
all concerned, promoting tourism and reducing the transport cost of
freight, food, and fuel. I believe that fish are exported by road from
Mallaig as far as Barcelona.
If public transport subsidies are considered vital on social grounds
in some rural areas, support for road users is just as necessary, or
more so, than for rail. It would improve the quality of life to very
much larger numbers of people (about 13 to 1) who travel by coach, bus,
minibus, or car.
Perhaps the rail campaign is misdirected -- the agitation should be
for improved rural roads. People living in the Highlands are best able
to decide, through their elected representatives, how scarce public
resources should be allocated. Better road access could revitalise the
Highlands.

ARTHUR ARROL HUNTER is wrong to suppose that Railtrack has made any
change in the programme for painting the Forth Bridge (February 23).
Using the same people, we are spending exactly the same amount on
painting as BR did, in accordance with the same health and safety
executive requirements on safe access -- and are continuing BR's policy
of giving priority to the lattice tie-members (which are structurally
important but not particularly conspicuous) using the new method of
shotblasting and applying five coats of paint designed to last 20-25
years.
While as befits his ancestry Mr Arrol Hunter may have a considerable
knowledge of the structural industry, what he actually sees on the
bridge is nothing more serious than flaking paint.
The steelwork is not subject to any significant corrosion, but if he
or anyone else would like us to expand our painting programme so as to
improve the appearance of the bridge we should welcome the necessary
sponsorship.

SHOPRITE, which yesterday reported a loss of #4.9m for the 52 weeks to
October 30, will not reveal the full costs of checking out of Scotland
until May.
The Isle of Man-based group has since sold its 117 UK deep-discounting
stores and sites, about 100 of them in Scotland, to arch-rival Kwik Save
for about #53.1m.
Shoprite extended its accounting period to January 1 and audited
14-month results are due in May.
Yesterday's figures did not take into account the substantial loss on
disposal of its UK retail business, the trading losses between the end
of October and the handover to Kwik Save or significant head office
reorganisation costs.
These will be charged to the profit-and-loss account in the final
results and result in a substantial reduction in shareholder funds.
The company's 52-week pre-tax loss of #4.9m, which includes #722,000
of fees to its bankers and their advisers, compares with a profit of
#5.1m in the year to October 1993. There will be more fees to come.
Retailing turnover, a figure now largely irrelevant, was actually up
26% at #205.2m. No final dividend will be paid.
With many analysts having already consigned the once-bold company to
the ''what might have been'' category, the group's shares, which have
suffered a spectacular collapse, lost only another [1/2]p to 12p.
With the sale agreement with Kwik Save locking Shoprite out of the UK
food business for five years, the Isle of Man company will not be making
a quick return to the mainland.
Shoprite, which said it could not have traded out of its financial
difficulties without the disposal, claims it is back to where it was
before first coming to Scotland in 1990.

IN replying to Gavin Bell on the problems of dyslexia, Carol A Kirk
suggests that there is extensive support for children with
dyslexia/special learning difficulties (SLD) (February 22). Nothing
could be further from the truth.
I have an 11-year-old son who is dyslexic. My wife and I first
expressed our concern to his school almost three years ago. Clearly,
when dealing with a child in these crucial formative years, time is of
the essence when learning support is required.
Suffice to say that in these past three years Strathclyde Regional
Council education department has provided virtually no support to my
son.
Because of this intransigence, we were required to have him assessed
privately, ie at our own cost. Even when this report confirmed dyslexia
no significant support was supplied. The only recourse open to us was to
seek private specialised tuition. This we did, and continue to do, at
considerable personal expense.
It is perfectly clear that, in Strathclyde at least, the resources are
completely inadequate. It is imperative that significant resources are
found to provide teachers with the special training required before any
more young lives are irreparably damaged.

I HAVE to remind Councillor J McCarron that he speaks on behalf of a
party which has no intention of reversing one of the most wicked Tory
policies ever imposed -- the removal of benefit rights from 16 and 17
year olds (February 23).
Mr McCarron speaks for the new Labour Party, an outfit which has
lurched so far to the right that there is scarcely any difference
between it and the Tory Party in matters of social and economic
strategy.
Labour also makes much about the need for a fairer distribution of
wealth to stop the rich getting richer while the poor get poorer. I
regard this as more than somewhat disingenuous of a party which at the
same time carefully avoids the word ''taxation''.

DR DUNCAN is plain wrong when he writes that ''there is no study which
demonstrates that stress occurs more often in one level of society than
in any other'' (February 22).
Among many such studies there is a long-running investigation of Civil
Service morbidity which beautifully demonstrates the strong connection
that Dr Duncan wants to deny.
Of course this does not mean that there is a simple one-to-one
relationship between poverty, or social status, on the one hand, and ill
health on the other. But very often it is clear that, while poverty or
stress are never in themselves sufficient to explain disease, their
existence is necessary for it to develop -- and this of course suggests
a preventive remedy.
The good news is that, contrary to Dr Duncan's assertion, there is
indeed plentiful evidence that reducing the differential between
Bearsden and Drumchapel will affect the gap in the relative longevity.

I GREATLY fear that Labour, having reached a high point where it just
might win a General Election, has embarked on its usual procedure of
shooting itself in the foot.
Its obsession with devolution for Scotland and tinkering with Clause 4
might well be regarded as examples of trivial pursuits. There are few
votes to be won or lost in either issue.
The real votes must come from the UK electorate as a whole, who have
to be persuaded that Labour proposes real and effective policies on the
important issues of the day.

I CAN'T comment on the medical arguments of Drs Burns and Duncan, but
the main influencing factors on health are surely habits (alcohol and/or
tobacco), diet, and exercise.
Those who pay little heed to these will have a shorter average life
span. Where does poverty enter the equation?

YOU report Mr Malone as saying that the new prescription charges are
still significantly less than the average total cost of a single
prescription item to the NHS (February 23).
His statement would seem to imply that there is some kind of shortfall
here and that there could well be room for further increases in the
future.
Surely it is (or at least was) a fundamental principle of the health
service that the sick should receive the treatment they require free of
charge with the service being funded through an equitable taxation
system.
Prescription charges are a negation of that principle and are in fact
a tax on the sick which is in no way equitable -- #5.25 per item may be
a negligible amount to the well-off but it is a significant sum to those
living just above the poverty line.
Moreover, research shows that the poor are more likely to be ill in
the first place and are therefore more likely to have to pay this unjust
tax.
There can be no ethical justification for this situation and
opposition parties should not be confining themselves to attacking the
increases but should be committing themselves to abolition of these
iniquitous charges at the earliest opportunity.

I WRITE in response to the report headed ''I'm not a white settler'',
concerning John Godfrey, the Conservative candidate for Perth and
Kinross (February 21).
It is an unwelcome side effect of the current surge in nationalism
that anyone who has gone south of the Border for education or employment
is somehow a second-class citizen, not quite a true Scot.
One might ask, must only Scots be allowed to stand for Parliament in
Scotland? Are English people not allowed to represent us -- or would
they somehow do a worse job?
It may be thought odd that someone living in London should want to sit
for a seat in Perthshire, but is it any more odd than someone from
Scotland representing Winchester or Harwich or Devizes or Newcastle?
Being Scottish is something to be proud of but only if we can accept
others with different backgrounds and traditions and enjoy the way they
enrich our society.
Let's recognise we are part of a modern and integrating Europe and
stop re-fighting the Battle of Bannockburn in the name of a narrow
nationalism which can lead only to the dead-end of self-adulation.

COWIE, the car and bus group, pleased the City yesterday. Pre-tax
profits for last year rose by 26% to #43.6m on turnover that was 17%
higher at #934m.
The results were somewhat better than the forecast of #41m made in
December. That prediction came at the time of the #33m rights issue at
190p. That was to help finance the separate acquisitions of two London
bus operating companies, Leaside and South London, which together
totalled #45.2m.
The shares rose 6p to 233p. That in part reflected the satisfaction
that under chairman Sir James McKinnon and chief executive Gordon
Hodgson, Cowie has a clear and highly logical strategy for the future.
Expansion on the bus side will make good any restrictions in the car
division.
There was also satisfaction that Mr Hodgson, who took personal charge
of the car sale activities mid-year, managed to restore the activity to
more adequate levels of profitability by reducing prices to encourage
volume sales.
The motor division of the Sunderland-based group increased pre-tax
profits by 18.5% to #10.1m. Mr Hodgson said 96% of profits in the
division came from activities other than new car sales -- for example,
used car sales, after-sales service and daily car rentals.
Profits from bus operations more than doubled to #3.4m with the
group's long-established Grey-Green business contributing #2.2m and
Leaside acquired in September adding #1.2m.
The bus contribution could well equal that of the car business in the
current year. The vehicle finance division, Cowie Interleasing, saw a
17% profits increase to #27.8m.
The dividend total rises 16% to 9.125p for 4.9% yield.

SPRING Ram, the kitchens, bathroom, and furniture group whose brands
include Stag and Vernon Tutbury, has made good progress in its first
year of rehabilitation without the benfit of any upturn in its prime
markets. Last year it returned to profit, making #3.3m before tax
compared with a #36.4m loss previously. Turnover grew by 7% to #239.5m.
The board's confidence in the group's future prospects was
demonstrated in the increase in the final dividend from 0.1 to 0.5p.
Former chairman Bill Rooney was forced off the board by institutional
investors in 1993 following revelations of false accounting at its
Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary and three profit warnings in eight
months. Before this, the group had enjoyed 13 years of rapid growth.
Executive chairman Roger Regan believes that internal management
actions will be the key to greater prosperity in the future with little
if no prospect of any marked upturn in housing market turnover before
the turn of the century.
On a divisional basis, profits in the kitchen business improved by #4m
on largely static turnover but the bathroom division barely broke even.
Restoring profitability across all divisions will be harder given the
increased raw materials costs -- up 35% in some cases -- which Spring
Ram is facing along with many other manufacturing groups. In the face of
consumer resistance to higher prices, Mr Regan hopes that new products
and export growth will help to offset the higher costs. Exports rose 22%
to #26.4m last year.
Although trading conditions remain difficult in the UK, the company
benefits from its state of the art production facilities, which
manufacture about 80% of its product portfolio, and a growing export
business.
This is expected to further reduce the company's dependence on the
large DIY outlets such as Texas Homecare which accounts for just under
10% of its business. Sainsbury's takeover of Texas will have no impact
on Spring Ram's long-term contracts with Texas which cover the next two
years.
The company's balance sheet is strong with net cash of #4.5m at the
year-end. This enables it to lessen the impact of higher raw materials
prices by buying forward in the market. In addition, it is well placed
to take advantage of the numerous opportunities to make strategic
bolt-on acquisitions of up to #10m each, both in the UK and on the
Continent.
Spring Ram is keen to build on its sizeable market shares in the UK.
It is second to MFI in the kitchen market with about 15% share and it
has 8% of the doors market.
Trading in the first few weeks of the current financial year is said
to be in line with the company's expectations. City analysts expect 1995
full-year profits to be #18m.
Spring Ram appears to be on the road to recovery but it is early days
yet. Given the company's past problems investors would be wise to await
more evidence of sustained recovery in terms of profit growth.
Meanwhile, the shares slipped a penny to 39p.

THE possibility that the UN had acquired its first African ''colony''
expired yesterday when its last 1500 soldiers left the beaches at
Mogadishu, the country's capital. The departing troops were lifted off
by the US Navy and protected by a fresh contingent of American Marines.
The Marines may not have been enough by themselves -- it seems that the
American Government had to pay up to $30m to bribe the lavishly armed
clan armies to permit an orderly and uncontested evacuation. The armed
intervention ordered by President Bush and endorsed by President Clinton
has ended in humiliation, though it will not be portrayed in these
terms. It is a humiliation shared by the UN even if part of its original
aim -- the humanitarian relief of the starving population of the
interior -- has been achieved.
Feeding the starving proved to be far easier than re-establishing law
and order, which had broken down because of war between competing clans
who disposed of what were in effect private armies. The UN, but
especially the US elements controlling its soldiers, mishandled the clan
leaders and were outfaced by them. The Americans brushed aside Italian
advice about how best to deal with Somali warlords. This was a mistake,
for the Italians were the former colonial power and had much experience
of dealing with Somali clan leaders. American attempts to use military
power quickly backfired and popular opinion, which had first been
enthusiastic about their arrival, was soon anxious for their departure.
If anything, the private armies have increased their power these past
two years, though some have split.
The UN -- or the US -- failed to impose a stable regime of its choice
for two reasons which need to be remembered before any future
interventions are suggested to pacify backward countries. The first is
that the devastating capacities of conventional war cannot be easily
applied on a small scale. (In its way the Bosnian war makes the same
point.) They certainly cannot be exerted in urban guerrilla war unless
very large casualties, including innocent civilians, are acceptable.
These are not acceptable to Western opinion generally, any more than the
casualties likely to be borne by the pacifying forces. If some specific
interest is involved it might be different, as American attitudes to the
Gulf war suggested, but humanitarian considerations would seem to be
different.
All of this leaves Somalia back where it started except that mass
death from starvation has been avoided. No-one will doubt what a benefit
that is, but it may be possible to deliver it in the future without
military intervention. The UN by itself does not have the resources to
run states, even backward ones like Somalia. Yet the melancholy fact is
that many states of that size and nature, and some even bigger, do not
manage themselves well. That is one reason why the UN itself is not
taken too seriously by the great powers which pay for it (when they do
pay their dues). The Marines leaving Mogadishu yesterday take many
lessons with them. Will they be learned?

THE minister's wee holiday in Edinburgh this May looks like being a
busy one. New proposals for organising the work of the Kirk will be
presented at the General Assembly, as they seem to be every year. They
will be debated endlessly and with various degrees of passion and the
aim at the end of it all will be to enable the Kirk to do its work
(however defined) at a time when cash is tight and getting tighter.
Contracting out services, such as the various chaplaincy posts, to those
organisations like universities and industrial concerns which are deemed
able to pay for them in whole, is merely one approach. It is not the
best one. We criticise state organisations for losing the notion of
service; must we make the same criticism of the Kirk? Furthermore, at a
time when nurses and doctors are being shoehorned into tough contracts
and workers of all sorts are still languishing at the DHSS, there may be
no market in ministers of religion. This is, indeed, such an odd idea
that it is difficult to discuss it without appearing facetious.
Universities and industrial organisations may genuinely see no need for
a chaplain, especially one they have to fund. This need not be because
of opposition to religion. Christians in general report less hostility
to their faith; it is sometimes difficult even to get a good argument
going. Nor is this a matter of hostility, but of benign indifference in
a society which knows so little about matters of faith that it has
virtually no knowledge of what it might object to. The other side of
this coin is that it has little sense of needing faith.
By any standards this is a pity. There is a spiritual element in
everyone's life which is ignored at peril, and it is at this point that
another of the Kirk's proposals comes into play. Simply put, this is the
suggestion that more weight should be given to work in Scotland with the
emphasis put on the parish ministry. It is not clear if this will mean a
cut in overseas missionary work. Certainly, the Kirk represents an odd
version of the branch-office syndrome in that its overseas work (and
that of other missionary churches) flourishes wildly in Africa, Asia,
and South America while head office in Scotland continues to resemble a
grey and peeling tree trunk. Yet leaving evangelism in Scotland to the
parish organisation instead of the existing evangelism organisers is
surely a backward step. It will work where there is an evangelism-minded
parish; where there is not (and there are plenty of these) there will be
nothing more than a cosy but dwindling desert.
Yet even the critics of the proposals to be presented in May do not
have all the answers. Those who witter on about new forms of ministry
rarely manage to define those forms in acceptable detail or accurately
assess their ability to work. It is fashionable to talk of doing away
with the remaining costly church buildings and worshipping in community
halls and schools. This may appeal to bookkeepers and those weary of wet
and dry rot, but in terms of maintaining the Kirk's presence in society
it is a sure-fire loser. First, there is no recognisable physical focus
for the work. Secondly, only those who have tried to negotiate the hire
of halls or schools, with the rising costs and the goodwill of
caretakers and doorkeepers which this involves, will appreciate the
degree of difficulty involved. It is clear that the Kirk must live
within its means and that these are shrinking. Here are two ways of
progressing: the first, which should not need to be said, is to advance
in faith. The second, for Christianity is a practical religion, is to
encourage the many within the Kirk who are well able to pay more to do
so.

YESTERDAY I addressed the opening session of the Chartered Institute
of Housing conference in Aviemore. Over the next few days of discussion
the delegates will be examining all aspects of housing. I wish them all
the best and hope that the conference provides a platform to raise the
profile of the Cinderella issue in Scottish politics.
For each and every one of us, the right to a suitable and sound house
is of great importance. We all need somewhere to stay. However, housing
as an issue does not arouse the focused passions necessary to keep it at
the top of the political agenda and it has been deprived of the coverage
it deserves.
The lack of coverage in the media is of course only one reason why
housing has such a low priority. Without the fair wind of media coverage
it is not easy to plant an issue firmly at the top of the political
agenda, and in purely media terms housing is simply not ''sexy''. In the
era of the sound bite and tabloid television it is too dry and
complicated for the news bulletin or the ''news'' paper.
Another reason for the neglect of the housing issue is that there is
no one housing issue. Housing covers a wide and varied number of worries
and concerns. To some the problem is damp or condensation. To others it
means overcrowding, mortgage relief, or neighbourhood watch schemes. So
while at an individual level everyone is concerned in some way about
housing, their concerns are diverse and their problems purely personal.
There is no united outcry over the Scottish housing crisis.
Without a single rallying point for politicians or the media, housing
is sidelined by the more clear-cut arguments over the NHS or education.
The lack of public clamour for change means little action from our
complacent political establishment.
Taking into acount all the changes since 1979 in housing policy and
legislation, and the threats posed in the years to come, it is
astonishing that the housing crisis is not nearer the top of the
political agenda.
The Government has already introduced a cut of 20% in real terms in
the housing support grant with hardly a protest. Local government
reorganisation, conducted without consultation and at breakneck speed,
is about to throw up housing allocation, rent equalisation, and repairs
policy problems -- each of which will add to current difficulties.
On top of this, social security changes in relation to housing
benefits and possible changes in homeless legislation pose a threat that
should cause deep concern among more than just the chattering classes.
The people who make these policies read the same statistics as I do --
a threefold increase in homelessness in a decade with 44,000 households,
equal to the population of Paisley, applying as homeless to their
district council; more than half a million houses with damp,
condensation, or mould; almost 200,000 people on a housing waiting list.
The list could stretch from one corner of the House of Commons chamber
to the other and back.
They must also come across the same problems at their surgeries or in
their mailbags as every other MP or councillor in Scotland, and yet they
bury their heads in the sand.
I will never forget the young couple who appeared at one of my first
surgeries and told me of their predicament: ''Mr Salmond, I know some
people may find the idea of sleeping together in the car romantic, but
let me tell you, after a week it is not romantic.''
In Scotland, in the late twentieth century, this is not acceptable.
I do not blame the Tories alone for all of Scotland's housing
problems. There is more to Scotland's housing crisis than the past 15
years. When I first joined the SNP I campaigned against the Labour
Government on its housing policy. Few SNP activists in 1973 in Govan
will forget the shameful housing conditions that generations of Labour
politicians had allowed to develop in that fiefdom. And the tragedy was
in 1988 things were little better.
But the Tories stand condemned for their part in the years since 1979.
The ''right-to-buy'' legislation gave a lucky few the opportunity to get
the house of their dreams, but in 1995 it has left an overburdened
public sector struggling to meet the overwhelming demand.
And in the few cases where the council house sales have left the local
authority with sufficient reserves to build new homes to replace those
sold, logic persuades them not to, because those houses will in turn be
sold at a discount, leaving the council with no house and a continuing
debt for building it.
Successive Westminster Governments have let Scotland down. As a
country rich in resources we should be able to afford decent housing for
our people. All we need is the power to let us get on with the job.
There is a consensus that something must be done to change the present
situation, but it is only with the catalyst of independence that the
real effort can begin to build a roof over Scotland.

BIRMINGHAM Post publisher Midland Independent Newspapers has fought
off the threat posed by the newspaper price war and managed to increase
marginally circulations of the five paid-for titles without cutting
cover prices.
Sales of the Birmingham Post rose 1% to 26,000, while the
money-spinning Evening Mail inched ahead to just over 200,000.
Advertising revenue rose by 17% to #66.5m helped by acquisitions with
the core titles bringing in an extra 8%. These have been boosted by the
surge in order books by the Midlands industrial companies benefiting
from the competitive advantage of sterling in selling into Europe and
the US which has boosted recruitment advertising.
However, finance director John Whitehouse said that other areas were
quieter such as retail, motors and property. The circulation levels were
helped by promotion and investing in quality.
Leaflet revenue rose 60% to #2.5m.
The group experienced a newsprint increase of up to 15% at the
year-end and a similar burden will fall in July. That will be met by
careful attention to newsprint where the annual bill is expected to
increase from #11m to #13.5m.
But the problem is to continue to produce a quality products without
reducing pagination and newpaper availability although supplements may
well be restricted -- as may well those of the London-based nationals.
Overall group turnover increased 12% to #89.5m with the operating
margin held at a healthy 20%. Interest charges for the company, which
came to the market a year ago at 140p, fell from #15.2m to #5.59m, while
actual pre-tax profits escalated from #784,00 to #12.7m.
Some #7m is being spent in the current two years on development
including the extension of the cable activities in association with
Mirror Group Television to provide local programming as from late
summer.
Mr Whitehouse said the company is on the lookout for acquisitions
although it would appear that there is little prospect of any very large
deal in the foreseeable future.
The dividend total is 3.3p for a 3.7% yield with the shares at
112[1/2]p where they trade at 11.9 times historic earnings.

GLASGOW-based Murray Income Trust achieved 1.6% growth in net asset
value to 319.4p at the halfway stage, having been hurt slightly by a
foray into Latin America.
This compared with a 3.9% capital advance in the FTSE All-Share Index,
with 79% of the #287m Murray Income fund invested in UK equities.
The trust, which is managed by Murray Johnstone, announced a 3.7%
increase in interim dividend to 7.26p. It forecast a 7% rise in the
final payout to 4.6p and a 7% increase in next year's interim dividend
to 7.77p.
Murray Income, which aims for an above-average and growing yield
combined with capital growth, achieved a total return of 4.5% in the six
months to December 31. The return on the All-Share Index was 6.1%, with
the FTSE World Index recording a negative return of 0.2%.
The remainder of the fund is invested primarily in North American and
Continental European stocks.
Murray Income is also invested in UK and European bonds, although
holdings were reduced from 10.6% to 7.8% of net assets during the
period.
Another #4.4m was invested in UK equities, with the remainder of the
proceeds employed to reduce gearing from 8.1% to 4.3%.
During the six months, Murray Income bought #1.6m worth of US dollar
American Depository Receipts in two Argentinian companies, Transport Gas
and Mirgor, an engineering and air conditioning firm. The value of these
investments, although small in relation to the total fund, fell by a
quarter as the Mexican financial crisis fed through.
Murray Income's overseas holdings have helped it avoid the worst of
the 2.3% decline suffered by the FTSE All-Share Index since the
year-end. Net asset value has dipped only 0.6% to 317.6p.

By IAN McCONNELL
EDINBURGH-based Ivory &amp; Sime believes it has strengthened itself
immeasurably, by recruiting John Stubbs to head its entire investment
management operation.
Mr Stubbs, 50, who was head of UK equities and international index
matching at PosTel Investment Management, formerly the Post Office Staff
Superannuation Fund, joins as chief investment officer.
As one of four departmental heads, the others being the directors of
operations, marketing and business development, Mr Stubbs will be the
only person on the investment side to have a seat on the main board.
He takes over his duties from former managing director Allan Munro,
who will now manage fixed interest investments and remains a director of
the company. Mr Munro stood in as chief investment officer during the
recruitment period.
The latest appointment, announced yesterday, stems from the arrival of
Colin Hook from Caledonia Investments, who joined the board on October
17 and became managing director on January 1. Caledonia has a near-30%
stake in Ivory &amp; Sime.
Mr Hook said the appointment was part of what he perceived to be the
necessary steps to recreate the focus on fund management.
Referring to the recruitment of a ''major City name'', Mr Hook said:
''I think it strengthens us immeasurably. We have here a very senior man
with lots of experience, coming at a time when markets generally have
been difficult.
''I think it is a boost for the Edinburgh financial community
generally.''

LOS ANGELES: A key defence witness in the O J Simpson double murder
trial claimed yesterday that she saw the former football star's white
Ford Bronco outside his estate at the time when he was alleged to be
killing his ex-wife and a friend.
However testimony was halted after a Simpson investigator belatedly
handed over a taped interview with Rosa Lopez, a housekeeper for
Simpson's neighbour, made last July. In it she made no mention of her
later claim to have seen the Bronco twice on June 12, the day of the
murders, at 8.15pm and again at 10.15pm.
Prosecutors say the defence has concealed the existence of the
audiotape because it could help them impugn Lopez's credibility as a key
alibi witness. Proceedings stopped while the tape was copied.

PLASTERBOARD giant BPB, which has more than 50% of the European
market, yesterday launched a $118m (#708m) bid for National Gypsum of
the US which values the second-largest US producer at $48.5 a share.
National has 23% of the American market which is the largest in the
world with a compound growth rate of 3.7% since 1980. If BPB does
succeed then it will have nearly 24% of the global market to make it
world leader.
Chief executive Jean-Pierre Cuny wrote to National Gypsum on February
27 offering a merger and asking for further information on the company
which last year achieved pre-tax profits of $130m on sales of $630m.
National has already been the unwilling recipient of two approaches from
Delcor which is a subsidiary of Golden Eagle Industries.
Golden Eagle is an investment company run by C D Spangler who was
chairman of National until last Friday. The second offer was at $46 a
share but was rejected by the board although Golden Eagle holds 19% of
its equity.
The acquisition is surrounded by conditions. BPB wants to maintain
both management goodwill and avoid activating the poison pills built
into the articles of association of many US companies.
For example, if a hostile bidder acquires more than a certain
proportion of shares, existing shareholders will be offered new shares
at knock-down prices to dilute the potential bidder.
The other major problem could be more apparent than real. National did
have exposure to asbestos activities in its past. However, it went
bankrupt in 1991 and was saved by Chapter 11, the US legal device which
provides protection for a company against its creditors. The failure was
caused by a highly-leveraged management buy-out.
There was a legal settlement in 1993 when a $700m trust was set up to
meet all future claims. The trust is seeking additional funds, perhaps
$350m spread over 20 years.
BPB intends raising about #300m through a rights issue. But with the
City still reeling from the T&amp;N disclosure that its 1994 profits have
effectively been wiped out by its new asbestosis liabilities, it will
have a problem in selling what is an otherwise extremely sound financial
scheme to the City.
The company hopes to complete the deal within three months although
that seems a little optimistic. It will be earnings enhancing
immediately because US analysts are forecasting that National's earnings
last year of $3.85 a share should rise to about $5.25 this year and to
$6.40 in 1996.
Market reaction was a little sour with BPB shares dropping 19p to 294p
on exceptionally large turnover for the stock of over 14 million shares.
There was criticism that it is buying National toward the peak of the
cycle. To that, Mr Cuny countered that the nature of the US market is
changing with more repair and maintenance to offset the usual cyclical
downturn, while, since 1980, National has maintained an average return
on sales of 21% -- BPB is around 12%.
BPB already has a significant North American presence through its
Canadian subsidiary Westroc which supplies the US market.

Christian von Arnim reports that the UN's departure offers Somalia a
straight choice between peace and war
THE final withdrawal now underway of UN forces from Somalia marks the
concluding episode in a tale in which there has been no happy ending.
The action of the US forces which swept ashore in Mogadishu yesterday to
evacuate the last of the UN peacekeepers and their military hardware is
almost like a parody of the time two years ago when, on the orders of
the then US President, George Bush, the same American soldiers stormed
ashore amid television lights and flashing camera bulbs to rescue
Somalia from starvation and bloodshed.
Their mission on behalf of the UN was to disarm the warlords, make the
country safe for the distribution of urgently needed humanitarian aid,
and create the conditions for rebuilding the structures of a civil
society.
What, then, has changed, now that the remnants of a force that at its
height involved 30,000 troops from 28 nations are making their final
departure? On the surface, not much. Fighting has flared again between
the two main rivals for power, Mohamed Farah Aideed and his Somalia
National Alliance (SNA), and Ali Mahdi Mohamed's Somali Salvation
Alliance (SSA). The gunmen in their ''technicals'', the pickups with a
gun mounted on the back, have been back on the streets for some time.
But while the UN failed dismally in its effort to restore political
order and end clan rivalries it did do much to alleviate the starvation
which led to the intervention in the first place. It was the UN's
political ineptitude which transformed a mission which could have been
successful into a disaster in which an initially welcoming Somali
population turned against anyone wearing a blue helmet.
ONE of the key mistakes made by the UN was the concentration of its
peace-making efforts on the warlords while neglecting other important
sectors of Somali society, such as the clan elders and women.
Furthermore, the US obsession with hunting down General Aideed, whom
it held responsible for the deaths of 24 Pakistani UN troops, quickly
made it appear that the UN was taking sides. In one of the most damaging
incidents, a US Army assault on a stronghold used by Aideed turned into
a massacre, leaving 18 Americans and 300 Somalis dead.
The UN succeeded in its humanitarian mission, but it failed dismally
in its military and political one, and the question now is whether the
humanitarian gains can be preserved once the soldiers have gone.
In fact, the future may not be as bleak for Somalia as appears at
first sight. Aideed and Ali Mahdi are reported to have set up a joint
committee to run Mogadishu's main airport and port facilities. They have
also agreed to maintain security and establish co-operation and a new
relationship with international aid organisations. That in itself is
hardly likely to provoke much excitement. Too often the warlords have
spoken peace and acted war.
But there is another factor which has changed the situation, and that
is the departure itself of the UN forces. That was the view of the UN
spokesman in Somalia, who told a news conference last week that the
imminent departure of the UN peacekeeping operation may have encouraged
the warlords to seek agreement.
THE spokesman's views are backed up by some Somali commentators, who
believe that the role of the UN has turned into a positive hindrance to
a settlement. Ever since its failure to initiate any constructive ideas
as a peacemaker, Somalis have been waiting for the UN to leave.
Moreover, traditional mechanisms for settling inter-clan disputes, such
as the role played by the clan elders, have begun working again.
As Oxfam's regional manager for the Horn of Africa, Roger Naumann,
said: ''As so often with Somalia, there is a lot of discussion and
activity going on, even if we're not hearing so much about it.'' Naumann
puts his finger on the problem when he adds: ''One of the problems with
UN operations has been a tendency to set deadlines, which simply don't
fit in with the Somali system at all.''
There are also fewer resources now for the militias to fight their
wars. The last in the line of UN special envoys to Somalia, Victor
Ghebo, says: ''I don't believe the factions have the resources to fight
a war as they did before. It will be cheaper to invent peace than to
return to war.''
The country could still plunge into bloodshed but the UN pull-out may
yet lead to a happier ending than is evident now.

Stewart Lamont examines some of the hard decisions ahead for this
year's General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, which is engaged in a
precarious book-balancing act, with Mammon shaking the rope
GOD and Mammon have always had an uneasy relationship. ''You cannot
serve both,'' declared Jesus, but those trying to run a national church
cannot afford to ignore one or the other. That perilous balancing act
was highlighted when the Kirk declared its financial crisis a couple of
years ago and was plunged into its latest bout of critical
self-examination. Since then there have been rumours of swingeing cuts
in work of the big-spending committees and at parish level, deficits
which would be carried over until closure was inevitable.
However, no reform plans or proposals for cuts can be implemented
without the say-so of the General Assembly, the Kirk's parliament, which
meets for a week in Edinburgh in May each year. At this season of the
year, the reports which form its agenda have been formulated and will be
press-released at regular intervals between now and May. The rumour mill
is already grinding, and it is therefore an ideal time to look at the
way the wind is blowing within the Kirk. This article attempts to assess
whether there is likely to be enough consensus within the policy-making
bodies to make possible a concerted approach to the Kirk's problems.
What emerges is that a surprising degree of consensus has already been
established over possible solutions. The reason it is surprising is that
the system of courts and committees which make up the Kirk make internal
conflict a way of life. One committee could easily find itself competing
with another for diminishing funds. Then there is hostility towards
central authority, which is inherent in Protestantism, and, coupled with
a thrawn Scots temperament, fosters a surly and reluctant attitude
towards ''top-down'' change which is initiated from Edinburgh. It is
often directed by congregations, who fear change or the axe, towards the
local presbytery and, even more so, towards the Assembly committees.
Now there seems to be a change in the wind -- at least among those at
the ''top''. The Rev Ronald Blakey, an avuncular figure who is secretary
of the Assembly Council, is far from the ''bishop in chief executive's
suit'' which was feared when he was appointed. Once a local government
convener when he was a parish minister in the Borders, he is now the
longest-serving minister in the Kirk offices, having had 15 years in
various roles at ''121''.
He declares there is much more co-operation now than the in-fighting
which went on between committees in his early days. He expects even more
co-operation with the appointment of the Rev Dr Finlay Macdonald of
Jordanhill parish as the next principal clerk. He disputes the idea of
''top-down'' strategy. ''There is nothing to stop congregations from
being missionary agents today -- everything assumes that they are at the
heart of mission''.
That view is echoed by the confidential Strategy Group report produced
within the Board of National Mission which was mostly the work of the
convener, the Rev Ian Black, and the secretary, the Rev Douglas Nicol.
Recognising that many of the bright ideas which require central funding,
such as evangelism organisers and industrial and other chaplaincies,
seem rather lacklustre when faced with cuts in funding, they have opted
for an approach which sees the parish at the root of everything, even to
the extent of seeing parish ministers as a possible way of saving money
through ''positive partnerships''.
For example, a chaplaincy at a prison, university or hospital could be
supplied by the local parish minister and paid for by the organisation
concerned. Industry could be encouraged to provide sponsorship for
chaplains, or as the report puts it: ''In general terms chaplaincy
provision should be commensurate with the ability of an organisation or
institution to pay for this service.'' Agreeing that cuts in chaplaincy
funding would have to be made, it adds: ''A greater number of part-time
chaplaincy hours should be incorporated into Church of Scotland
charges.''
Thus the Kirk is following the path of the BBC, the NHS, and other
national bodies by ''contracting out'' many of its services and
attempting to reduce its outlay in the process. This naturally
infuriates some ministers. The Rev John Matthews, of Ruchill, has
written his own response to the proposals within the Board of National
Mission which he reckons are the product of a clutch of grey-suited,
weary people driven by a top-down philosophy and preoccupied with
finance. A former manager with General Electric, he recognises that some
aspects of the church are financial but argues that others are subsided
by faith and need not increase costs.
John Matthews writes: ''We must open up to new forms of ministry which
may not involve ordained university-trained personnel; and now is the
time to tell our people that they must give up the idea of holding on to
their Victorian buildings and strike out in new directions, worshipping
in community halls and schools where they don't have the cost and worry
of their upkeep.''
Although he is at odds with the report of National Mission, he may not
be so out of line with current thinking and there may be allies in other
boards.
The Rev John Chalmers has not been convener of the powerful Board of
Ministry long enough to have acquired the weary look of many of the
conveners I have met recently. He says: ''We are conscious that cuts are
necessary because our revenue reserves have been run down in recent
years. Either our priority is to get the extra money to pay for all the
work (including ministers' stipends) or find new ways to minister to
Scotland.''
He and other conveners concede that despite having the best year ever
in 1993 for congregational giving, that pattern cannot be relied upon to
continue, and the forecast by the Board of Stewardship and Finance is
that, with rising salary costs and declining membership, it will not do
so.
The ministry convener, John Chalmers, who is minister of Palmerston
Place church in Edinburgh, agrees that it is unlikely to mean the same
number of ministers doing the same thing. ''For a long time we've seen
our financial salvation in selling buildings and reinvesting the money,
but now we need a new strategy. We are keen to consult to find new
patterns of ministry. We think this will appeal to people who were
previously bugged by someone coming along and saying 'your congregation
isn't necessary' when they thought it was. That made a lot of people
unhappy.''
The new forms are likely to include part-time ministries and more
flexible contracts for parish ministers who were once guaranteed a job
for life.
This approach has also got the backing of the Assembly Council whose
report on auxiliary ministers will open this door further. They are even
willing to see sacraments dispensed in parishes where the old pattern is
not possible, by lay readers and members of field staff. Elders may be
authorised to conduct worship by presbyteries in areas where a minister
is not possible. Ron Blakey says: ''As long as you have dry rot in
buildings and security of tenure in the ministry, it makes a nonsense of
long-term planning.''
In recent years the use of ''terminable tenure'', that is inducting
ministers for a limited period such as five years, has been used to gain
flexibility but the question has been raised about severance pay if the
ministry is indeed to be ''terminated''.
The legal sub-committee of the Board of Practice and Procedure is
going to ask the Board of Ministry to include this in its plans for a
contract of employment for ministers -- the first time in the Kirk's
history that the duties of a minister will be spelled out.
It means that those who won't (or can't) do the job as it is defined
in the future can be made redundant without the threat of a civil action
in the Court of Session (something that would send shivers down the
spines of those who take pride in the fact that the national Kirk has
the constitutional status of being master in its own house ).
Another development from this board is a review of the Assembly itself
which would siphon off many of the appeals and petitions which take up
so much of the week in May. These would be dealt with by a special
commission consisting of a tenth of the elders and ministers who make up
the General Assembly in equal numbers (a kind of mini-Assembly) which
would meet in October and February. In addition, the Board of Mission
want a new body to be a court of appeal for church closures and
amalgamations, to ''grasp the nettle'' -- that is, those congregations
who do not like what the Parish Reappraisal committee has decreed for
them and previously appealed to the Assembly which (the Strategy Group
notes) ''appears to decide on emotion rather than on reason''.
That last statement highlights the fly in the ointment which has to be
applied when nettles are grasped too firmly. Despite all the
unprecedented consensus among the Boards, the Kirk's structure means
that a negative vote at its supreme court, the Assembly, could stop it
all happening. Parish Reappraisal have been slapped down by such votes
in recent years and know what it is to be stung. All the weary hours by
the men in suits may go for nothing if the vote does not go their way,
plunging the Kirk into even deeper confusion.
Last year's proposal to carry over the shortfalls of congregations who
do not pay their way until they were cleared or closed, was remitted to
presbyteries and they have altered it, suspicious of top-down bodies
deciding the bottom line for parishes. But the Assembly Council have
brought it back, amended so that presbyteries themselves will apply the
screws. Congregations will have to sign on the dotted line when they get
a new minister that they will pay all their debts to central funds and
if they don't, they will have to justify their continued existence.
However, despite the consensus which is developing by allocating the
priority to parish ministry and allowing this to be adapted to local
conditions with part-time contracts and additional funding, the
blueprint could be torn up. The General Assembly could decline to allow
the boards their head and there will be no grasping of nettles if the
bottom-up people don't like what the top-down ones are doing.
Riches to rags
* IN SCOTLAND, both the RC and Church of Scotland churches are now
strapped for finance. Prior to the Reformation, the Church had lands
which brought revenues ten times that of the King. Although many of
these were siphoned off by the nobility after 1560, the Kirk could draw
on land taxes to fund its ministry and was a statutory authority which
ran all schools until 1870.
* In the nineteeth century, the power of the purse saw various
independent or breakaway churches build places of worship and when these
came within the Kirk following the reunion of 1929 there was a surplus
of buildings and a patchwork of practices.
* Land taxes were phased out as a means of paying ministers, who used
to get stipend only twice yearly. The Kirk's other work was financed by
committees who raised funds in competition with one another until 1959,
when Stewardship and Budget produced a joint budget for all schemes
which was approved by the Assembly, but there was no priority pecking
order.
* In 1986 the fund was renamed Mission and Aid and was levied at local
presbytery level upon congregations according to their ability to pay.
The latest changes mean that those who can pay but won't pay risk being
closed down, and the new system of national priorities will mean some
work will cease to have an equal claim on resources.
* In some EU countries the national church is funded by the state. In
Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland) Lutheran ministers are
paid like civil servants.
* In Germany, money is raised by a church-tax from which few citizens
opt out, and money given to denominations in proportion to their
numerical strength. No-one has seriously advocated this practice be
reintroduced in Scotland.

MARTIN Currie's #660m Scottish Eastern Investment Trust, which
sustained a sharp fall in net asset value in its latest financial year,
is confident that it is well placed to exploit a recovery in share
prices.
The trust issued a #50m Debenture in April last year when yields were
close to their bottom. The bulk of this money has been ploughed into
gilts and overseas bonds with only a limited amount going into equities.
Keith Falconer, who manages the trust, is waiting for the outlook for
stock markets to improve before redeploying the funds in equity markets.
In its year to January 31 net asset value fell by 16.5% to 88.0p,
slightly greater than the 15.2% drop in the All-Share Index.
A final dividend of 1.06p will give an unchanged total of 1.58p. There
was a shortfall in revenues of just #58,000 as earnings per share
slipped from 1.65p to 1.57p.
The decision of the US Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates
in February last year sparked off sustained falls in global equity and
bond markets.
Now Mr Falconer is looking for a slowdown in the US economy and a
return to lower interest rates as a spur to equity markets in the UK and
the Pacific.
The trust's chairman, John Kemp-Welch, said: ''Taking the year as a
whole, equity and bond investors have experienced a difficult time.
Nevertheless with most major economies now moving out of recession and
corporate profitability improving, we believe that our decision to
borrow funds will enhance total returns to shareholders as share prices
recover.''
Scottish Eastern has long-term gearing of 18% in place. The average
for the sector is 11%, and Mr Falconer believes that the extent of the
trust's gearing is the main factor in a widening of the discount to net
asset value from 8% to 12%.
The trust has 59% of its assets in the UK, 9% in North America, 9% in
Japan, 9% in continental Europe, 8% in the Pacific Basin and 6% in
developing markets, such as India and Chile. Bonds account for 6% and
liquidity is 2%.

STERLING continued to be under pressure ahead of today's important
parliamentary vote on Europe.
If the Tories lose the vote then the increase in political uncertainty
will further undermine an already vulnerable pound.
The Barings collapse has already faded from the minds of most currency
dealers. US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the break-up of Barings
should not have any impact on either the global or British economies.
Technical analysts forecast the pound remaining under pressure as long
as it fails to move above DM2.3370. Yesterday it managed to show a
slight gain on the mark at DM2.3075, but eased against the dollar at
$1.5830. Sterling's trade-weighted index remained at 86.8.
The flight to quality assets continues to favour the mark. A
combination of factors, including the poor European political situation,
Mexican economic problems and higher European inflation, is likely to
continue to favour the mark, while the German wage dispute is fuelling
speculation of an early rise in German interest rates.

Anne Johnstone discovers that the Barings collapse is as big a blow to

Scottish voluntary sector. Many of the projects it stands to benefit are
run by small community groups and unfashionable health and social
services charities, struggling to cope with the increasing demands
placed on them by the Government's care in the community strategy. But
so far the new body has only one backer -- the Baring Foundation.
Until last weekend the Baring Foundation was among Britain's largest
grant-making trusts. This week the Charities Aid Foundation ranked it
ninth, on the basis of the #9.4m worth of grants it made in 1993. But
last year, on the back of massive profits from the banking arm of the
company, it dispensed more than #16m, which probably puts it in the top
five along with the Royal Society and the British Academy. And for the
first time, following a policy change, the foundation began making
grants to Scotland. Much of it (#127,500 so far, with another #100,000
to come) went to the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations to
kick-start a novel charitable trust, the Caledonian Foundation.
It was the brainchild of Jane Salmonson, development director for
SCVO. Due for its official launch this autumn, it will be the first
Scotland-wide trust to offer those living outside Scotland the chance to
combat disadvantage in Scotland. The foundation is looking to
Scottish-based companies and trusts to start the ball rolling but
eventually will have its sights set firmly on wealthy expatriates,
particularly the 25 million Americans claiming Scots ancestry. About 80%
of funding is expected to come from overseas within three years.
The impetus for creating the foundation comes from the recognition
that in the UK there is a marked imbalance in the share of grant-giving
that comes to Scotland. SCVO research showed that while Scotland had 9%
of the UK's population, it is getting less than 4% of the funding
available through trusts.
David Carrington, director of the Baring Foundation, also recognised
that imbalance, and two years ago persuaded his trustees to fund a
feasibility study into the idea. Another #100,000 was forthcoming last
year in establishment costs and a further #100,000 is on offer towards
the first round of grants, provided Salmonson can match it from
elsewhere. On Monday, to her immense relief, Salmonson received a fax
from Carrington, assuring her that this money would still be paid.
But it's the future that worries her: ''If all had gone well, I'd have
been back to Baring next year asking for #250,000 or more.'' Also she
was hoping to use the Baring reputation in the grant-giving field as an
inducement for others to follow. ''I feel as if an ace has been snatched
from my hand. It's a tragedy,'' she said yesterday.
Twenty other Scottish-based charities also received money from the
Baring Foundation last year. The grants totalled more than #535,000.
Salmonson believed that this would rise to more than #1m a year in
future years. But today that dream lies in tatters. Yesterday David
Carrington confirmed that with #8m in grants committed but so far
unpaid, the foundation was unlikely to be making any new grants for a
long time to come.
Most of his budget came directly from Barings' profits, wiped out by
the reckless folly of a single trader in the bank's office in Singapore.
The foundation has about #45m of assets, and Carrington says, if
necessary, it will sell them to meet its obligations. The news comes as
an enormous relief to Jim Jackson, director of Alzheimer Scotland, which
has a grant of #75,000 over three years for raising awareness of the
problems of people with dementia and communicating with policy makers.
''This is the most difficult area to obtain funding for,'' said
Jackson.
Professor Mary Marshall of the Dementia Studies Centre at Stirling
University, which received #67,500 from the Baring Foundation to make
the funding of vital research available to practitioners, said she was
relieved that the money would be paid but was fearful for the future.
''There are no other obvious sources of money. I don't know what we'll
do,'' she said.
The point perhaps is not the size of these grants but what they are
for. Despite the pin-stripe establishment image of the bank, the
foundation has a reputation for entertaining well-thought-out but
radical ideas. In this respect it has been compared with the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation, whose research findings constantly embarrass the
Government.
''Baring wasn't afraid of ruffling feathers. A lot of our work
challenges the status quo. Baring understood this and were prepared to
back it. It was one of the few trusts prepared to address causes rather
than simply apply sticking plaster,'' says Jackson.
Much of this radical reputation comes from their choice of director.
While most trusts tend to opt for retired generals, peers, financiers or
property developers, Baring took on David Carrington, straight from the
Housing Associations Charitable Trust, which supports projects for the
homeless. Under him, the foundation became something of a trendsetter in
the way it took up awkward and unfashionable causes.
Without Barings, and with a greater and greater slice of charitable
giving going to the big players based in London, a number of Scottish
charities face an uncertain future. In particular, the Caledonian
Foundation faces an uphill struggle as Jane Salmonson anxiously casts
around for a new backer: ''Of all the big financial institutions to go
bust so spectacularly, why did it have to be Barings?''

MADRID: Spain's most wanted man, former senior security official Luis
Roldan, was returned to Madrid under arrest today after 10 months on the
run.
Roldan, head of the civil guard police force from 1986-93, who faces
fraud charges, was found in Laos after some 150 detectives chased him
over four continents in an operation codenamed Moon.
Roldan was handed over to Spanish police in Bangkok yesterday. He was
flown back to Madrid and, after fingerprinting and a medical check, was
questioned by Judge Ana Ferrer who remanded him without bail.
Roldan, 51, was the first civilian to head the civil guard and a
candidate for Interior Minister in 1993. He is accused of illicit
enrichment, appropriating secret funds, and amassing a personal fortune
put at #24m.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Europe and US doing well but Canada disappoints    General Accident sees profits leap to #428m</HEADLINE>

FULL-year profits from General Accident emerged at the top end of
expectations with a predictable surge but the outlook for the current
year is much less exciting because the insurance cycle has turned down.
The pre-tax figure jumped from #294.9m to #428.3m and the final
dividend of 18.9p makes a total 6% higher at 29p, which is covered 2.3
times by available earnings.
General Accident chief executive Nelson Robertson sees pressure
developing in the UK but this only accounts for 36% of the total
business and better results are foreseen this year in other areas
particularly the US and Europe. Canada, which has been disappointing,
''will need'' to improve, he said.
The UK had an exceptional performance last year with the underwriting
surplus soaring from #60m to #201m. Premiums were 10% ahead at #1520m.
The frequency of claims was lower, with personal buildings and contents
accounts helped by good weather, with much reduced subsidence claims,
and better home security installed by householders.
The motor sector also benefited from lower thefts, though there was a
blip in accident claims in the final quarter, possibly reflecting wet
weather.
Competitive pressure became apparent in motor in the last quarter,
when premium income fell 8%. Home rates also turned softer, though those
with poor claims records are seeing increases.
General Accident is trying hard to differentiate its motor policies,
through for example emphasising service, but it remains basically a
commodity product.
The group is determined not to pursue volume at the expense of
profitability, though it did not lose motor customers, who remained
static at 600,000. They were also unchanged on the GA Direct side at
150,000. About 80% of new motor policies are restricted to one driver.
General Accident reckons that talk of a major slide in premiums is
exaggerated. It is better equipped to handle a downturn in the market
than in the past. This is true of insurers in general as investment in
computerisation has improved management information and enabled more
differentiation in premium rates, down to individual post codes in some
areas.
New computer systems are coming along which will reduce costs though
no job losses are planned at least in the UK.
On the commercial side, motor results picked up strongly now that GA
is out of the fleet market, while property, which is concentrated in the
small company sector, showed a strong advance. Employers' liability is
one area where the group wants higher rates and these are coming
through, as shown by the halved 1994 deficit.
GA Life is bucking the trend of its market, even achieving a slight
increase in new annual premiums when most companies have seen a fall.
Single premiums jumped from #341m to #559m. The group is seeing the
advantage of the diversification of its distribution channels.
From being almost totally dependent on financial advisers, only 60% of
business arrives from them at present, though their absolute
contribution is still higher. Business currently arrives from the eight
smaller building societies which are tied to GA Life, from the group's
own telephone sales and direct sales force and from the 400 strong chain
of estate agents, though they remain loss-making in themselves.
GA is not a major player in pensions and has only felt it necessary to
make a modest provision against mis-selling. It is interested in
developing sales of mortgage protection policies, though only a wide
base of policyholders will enable the exclusions on these policies to be
reduced.
Overseas, most General Accident activities made progress. The
important US account reduced underwriting losses from #140m to #112m,
helped by a good improvement in the final quarter, which bodes well for
1995. Despite a significant reduction in exposure, premium income was
only slightly down following rate rises across most classes. Both
personal and commercial lines showed good improvements in the final
months.
Mr Robertson accepts that Canada, where General Accident is the
largest insurer with an 8% market share, was disappointing with the
underwriting loss up by #29.5m to #73.6m, largely as a result of adverse
weather but also higher reserving and the cost of absorbing the
portfolio acquired from the Prudential.
Corrective action has been taken and Howie Moran, senior
vice-president in Canada, believes that profits are not far away.
The Pacific was another region where the underwriting picture worsened
slightly after the Hunter Valley earthquake in Australia. In continental
Europe, France staged a strong recovery, pulling the loss for the region
down from #41.1m to #15.6m. The deficit in ''other'' overseas areas was
also lower, though South Africa still has to show the benefits of
remedial action.
General Accident certainly gave the impression yesterday it was well
able to manage the downturn in the insurance cyle and this confidence is
common in the industry. But rating discipline is a fragile concept which
could easily break down, particularly given the scale of profits in the
UK. Nevertheless at this stage, a full-scale price war looks unlikely.
The question is whether profits will be dented to the extent of
curtailing dividend growth. Some analysts think dividend prospects are
better elsewhere in the sector but given the tighter ship, the group is
running there should be few doubts that dividends will go up again this
year.

Hamilton, Tuesday
A MAORI tribe wants the Queen to apologize in person for a land grab
by British settlers last century.
The Waikato Times newspaper of Hamilton reported today the demand was
part of a proposed multi-million-pound settlement between the New
Zealand Government and the Tainui Maori people, one of several tribes
whose lands were stolen generations ago.
Under the deal, they will receive 35,000 acres of land, valued at
about $NZ100m (around #40m). They will also get another $65m for a land
acquisition trust fund.
Bob Mahuta, the tribe's principal negotiator, said his people wanted
an apology from the queen because the settlers had seized tribal lands
in the name of the British crown.
''What we want from the Queen is for her to come on our marae (a
traditional meeting place) and say sorry,'' he said.
The royal apology should also be in writing so it could be kept for
future generations, he said.
The Queen will next be in New Zealand in November when she will attend
a Commonwealth Heads of Government conference.
A Buckingham Palace spokesman told the Waikato Times she has been
briefed on the negotiations and would act on the advice of New Zealand
Ministers.
Doug Graham, the Minister in charge of negotiating land settlements
with Maori tribes, said the government was considering the issue.

AS expected the European Commission has cleared Glaxo's hostile #9000m
bid for rival drugs group Wellcome. The Commission did not think that
the bid raised any serious doubts as to its compatability with the
Common Market and so the EU anti-trust condition to the Glaxo offer has
been satisfied. A referral would have caused the entire deal to
collapse.
Glaxo's bid, which if successful would create the world's largest
drugs company, must also be approved by the US Federal Trade Commission
(FTC), which last weekend said it was seeking more information about the
deal. The FTC's interest is thought to centre on 311C, Wellcome's
developmental drug for migraine, and Panorex, a Wellcome treatment for
colo-rectal cancer. The combined Glaxo/Wellcome would have just a 5.3%
share of the fragmented world pharmaceuticals industry and so FTC
approval is expected to be given for the Glaxo bid.
There have been complaints to the European Commision about the high
price of Glaxo's migraine drug, Imigran, amid fears that a succesful
takeover of Wellcome will give Glaxo too much clout in the migraine
market. Migraine affects one in ten Europeans.
However Glaxo is thought to have given the European authorities an
assurance that it will licence out either its existing migraine drug or
similar follow-up products to another drug company. Given its potential
blockbuster status it seems highly unlikely that Glaxo will licence out
Imigran itself. Its sales have been growing strongly. In the six months
to end-December 1994, Imigran sales rose by 36% to #154m with the US
accounting for 55% of the business even though the tablet form is not
available yet. A new lower dose Imigran tablet is now available in some
markets.
Wellcome's board under chairman and chief executive John Robb
continues to seek a higher rival offer to Glaxo. It has been in frantic
negotiations with major drugs groups across the Atlantic and elsewhere
in Europe. However Mr Robb said that any rival offer will only emerge
near the end of the first offer period.

ADMINISTRATORS Ernst &amp; Young were yesterday talking to potential
bidders for either the whole, which would be the preferred option, or
part of the collapsed merchant bank Barings.
But while they said that there were considerable expressions of
interest no details were available though it is believed that two
groups, both from outside the UK, remain at the forefront.
It seems likely, though, that Barings will not be sold as one unit but
that offers will be made for various parts of the bank with particular
interest centering on asset management.
One group that has been mooted as a possible player is United Asset
Management, the substantial US investment house which acquired
Glasgow-based Murray Johnstone in 1993.
The administrators are clearly anxious to proceed quickly to avoid the
danger of key personnel leaving which would lower the attraction to a
buyer. It is understood that financial headhunters have already been
flooded with calls from Barings' employees. Scarcely surprising in the
circumstances.
Barton Biggs, managing director of US investment bank Morgan Stanley,
which had been intending to acquire Warburg before the deal collapsed,
said that Morgan would be interested in bidding if the price was right.
And Dutch group ABN AMRO was said to be weighing a bid for key parts of
the bank.
Dresdner Bank is watching the situation but in the main the German
banks appear unenthusiastic with Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and
Westdeutsche Landesbank saying they were not interested and had not sent
anyone to London to take part in purchase discussions.
Potential bidders include National Westminster, Barclays and Midland
Bank's owner HSBC which expressed an interest on Monday in Barings fund
management side.
It is the fund management activities that would probably attract most
interested parties and would raise the most funds. But a complication
here could be if clients' money was deposited with the bank. As it is
#2m on deposit by the fund management business has naturally been
frozen. But it is not yet known whether any clients money is deposited
with the bank.
Yesterday Barings Stratton Investment Trust said it would carry on its
investment business. It said: ''Stratton considers the ownership of
these assets is unaffected by the appointment of the administrator and
that the manager is therefore free to deal with the investments in the
normal course of business.''
Stratton has #29.1m under management. It has #1.8m on deposit with
Barings which has been frozen by the administrators and borrowings from
the bank of #2.4m.
Two offshore funds which have been suspended from trading on the stock
exchange are Baring Emerging European Trust and Baring Chrysalis. This
is because the position of their custodian, Baring Brothers (Guernsey),
vis-a-vis the appointment of administrators to Barings, is not yet
clear.
Meanwhile, there was considerable derision yesterday among City
traders at Barings chairman Peter Baring's assertion that the bank could
have been the victim of deliberate sabotage. The suggestion was also
knocked down in the Far East. It was known in the markets for some time
that Barings was running a huge position on Nikkei 225 futures contracts
which were growing all the time. Barings was culpable, it was suggested,
in giving trader Nick Leeson his head without any apparent controls or
even monitoring.
The Japanese equity market, whose slump was the trigger for so much
grief for Barings, yesterday came under criticism from Japanese
securities house Nomura's global strategist Nick Knight. He has cut the
Japan weighting in his model portfolio to 16% from 20%.
He said: ''We now know that the market was being artificially
supported by a large single buyer in recent weeks, and yet the weight of
generalised selling drove it down.''
It is the second time this month that Nomura's analyst has issued a
bearish note on Japan. On February 8 he slashed his recommended
weighting to 20% from 34%.
Prior to that date Nomura had been keen on Japan and increased
weightings there as recently as last month. Japan, not the US, may be
the big risk to world financial markets, is the view now of the Nomura
analysts.
This is in stark contrast to the view of James Capel's global
strategist, Peter Oppenheimer, who suggests switching into Japanese
equities from US equities. The said that the start of the next Japanese
bull market is close at hand. He has increased Japanese equities to an
overweight 27.5% of his global portfolio from 23% and cut four
percentage points from the US to 23.8%.
So you pays your money and you make a choice. Or perhaps better still
leave well alone. Either way it is too late for Barings.

Bangkok, Tuesday
THE British embassy in Bangkok alerted Customs officers to watch out
for a British man who they believed would attempt to smuggle heroin out
of Thailand, a Bangkok court was told.
Customs officer Ithiphon Plainwong, testifying at the trial of Britons
Robert Lock, 30, from Cambridge, and Sandra Gregory, 29, from Sowerby
Bridge, West Yorkshire, said his department had a tip-off that Mr Lock
would attempt to smuggle heroin.
The embassy made no mention of Miss Gregory, he said.
The pair were arrested at Bangkok airport in February 1993 on heroin
trafficking charges as they were about to board a flight to Japan.
Miss Gregory, who was found to have 3[1/2]oz of heroin, has pleaded
guilty but Mr Lock has denied the charges.
Miss Gregory told the court earlier that Mr Lock had promised to pay
her for smuggling the drugs to Japan. Mr Lock then accused Thai police
of putting pressure on Miss Gregory to testify against him.
Miss Gregory, a former English language teacher in Bangkok whose
parents live near Aberdeen, told the court last April that she was
driven to smuggling by desperation over a tropical illness she had
contracted in Thailand.
She said she was suffering from dengue fever, similar to malaria, when
she met Mr Lock in 1992. She said he told her he could help her obtain
enough money to cover medical expenses in London after doctors advised
her to return home for treatment.
The case continues on March 22.--Reuter.

As a particularly well-publicised runaway returns, Margaret Vaughan
examines the reasons why young people take flight
THE good news for the parents of runaway schoolboy Peter Kerry who
flew home from Malaysia yesterday is that their son is a very special
case who is simply acting out a fantasy that afflicts all of us at some
time or other. The bad news is that all the attention he is getting is
likely to inflame his wanderlust and it might be the Antipodes next
time.
Professor Rudolph Schaffer, a psychologist specialising in children's
behaviour, takes a sanguine and, it must be said, somewhat admiring view
of the 14-year-old who grabbed his father's credit card and took off for
Kuala Lumpur after a row over a plate of spilled spaghetti and an untidy
heap of videos:
''There's something romantic about it, isn't there? To take off like
that for some place far away. I suspect a lot of children have fantasies
about running away after a row. Most will take the bus to Milngavie or
Musselburgh and come home for tea. That's why this particular case grips
the imagination,'' Professor Schaffer reckons.
The exasperated parents, who have extracted a solemn pledge from their
son that he will defer further long-range adventures until he is older,
may be in for a disappointment:
''All the attention that he is getting is likely to reinforce this
behaviour. I wouldn't be surprised if it is New Zealand next time.''
According to the Strathclyde University professor, it is not only
children who fantasise about running away, it's grown-ups too: ''But how
many adults are adventurous enough to take a plane to Malaysia? He is a
very special case. No doubt when he gets out of this rebellious period,
the experience will stand him in good stead. He is resourceful.''
And, one is tempted to add, a pain in the neck -- not to mention the
wallet -- for his parents, currently counting the cost of the fantastic
flight to Malaysia on his father's credit card and passport, his own
having been locked up since his last outbreak of itchy feet led him to
Paris, and before that, Edinburgh.
The elation Mr and Mrs Kerry felt at being reunited with their
high-flying son is one thing. The promise that there will be no cross
words may seem unrealistic, if understandable. As relief at having him
safely home subsides, they are likely to feel rage at his casual stroll
back into family life in Harrow. It follows from feelings of having been
emotionally tricked. Shock or premature mourning is likely to be
followed by relief which swiftly turns to fury.
Professor Schaffer says most children suffer feelings of distress in
their lives, especially in adolescence and, most especially, when there
is conflict in the family about trivial things.
The problem is that what may seem trivial to a parent can be
enormously important to the child. And, one guesses, that somewhere
among all the emotions at war in Peter Kerry's rebellious bosom after
being grounded and refused permission to go to a football match was that
familiar infantile plan: ''I'll run away . . . then they'll be sorry.''
In doing a bunk, he acted out a fantasy which we all, to some extent,
share. The yen to bolt afflicts even successful people, or perhaps that
should be especially successful people. Look at Stephen Fry.
John Hunter, who was a long-serving member of the children's panel
system and is himself the parent of a teenager, says that children go
through a separation process from their parents which starts, probably,
when they go to school. In Peter's case it was taken to extremes.
''In this case it sounds as if the normal process has been, em,
stepped up. I think that's all. Let's face it, running away to Malaysia
is pretty adventuresome.''
The bright, clever boy from an apparently happy and secure home does
not fit the usual profile of compulsive runaways. Mr Hunter, who is
editor of Scottish Child, said runaways are generally fleeing distress:
''My experience on the children's panel was that the kids who ran away
were trying to get away from something specific and something quite
major. I can't remember a case where it was just someone running away on
a whim or some small thing. Although it has to be said this young chap
may have been distressed in his own way.''
Adults, he says, often down-play children's worries and concerns,
viewing them as trivial when they matter enormously to the child: ''If
you go back to the writings of Socrates you find complaints about kids
lacking respect for their elders. This generation of children is no
different from any other. You could say it cuts both ways. Maybe adults
don't take enough cognisance of their children's views or needs.''
The overwhelming majority of children and young people who run away
return within very short periods, usually one or two days. But in
serious cases the problems that caused the impulse to flee may be
complex and grave, including abuse or difficult family relationships.
Research into Scottish runaways for Children in Scotland, an umbrella
group of voluntary organisations, highlighted the haphazard nature of
reporting of incidents. There is no central register of missing children
or runaways. No-one knows for sure how many children run away from home
or from local authority care. Nor is it known how many children
repeatedly run away or where they go to. From the scant evidence
available the research suggests there are between 9000 and 10,000 such
incidents every year.
The evidence suggests that a small number of children who
repeatedlyrun away are responsible for a large number of incidents. In
1988, of 1600 abscondings in Lothian, 276 were attributed to just 14
children.
Perhaps the saddest group is that of children and young people who run
away from local authority care. They form a disproportionately high
number of runaways. They are among the most vulnerable in society. And
they are the ones who most often end up homeless and on the streets.
Longing to face new horizons is so much easier when there is somewhere
safe to go home to.

AN INQUIRY is to investigate the death of a promising young doctor who
died after being caught by an avalanche in the Highlands.
Dr Katharine Herd, 28, died in January 1994 after being swept 400ft
down a gully on 3456ft Liathach in Wester Ross.
Her death came only days before she was to start a job in Inverness
and led to her father resigning as a prospective candidate in the
European Parliament elections last June.
Dr Herd, who lived in Cruden Bay and was a GP in Peterhead, was one of
three climbers under instruction by mountain guide Kevin O'Neill when a
snow slab came loose and tons of debris carried them down the mountain.
Despite suffering serious head injuries in the fall, Mr O'Neill, 40,
from Lochcarron, who was climbing solo alongside the trio, staggered for
miles to raise the alarm.
He reached his car and was driving to get help when he was stopped by
rescuers who were already out looking for him.
One of his students, 17-year-old Marcus Cross, also from Lochcarron,
had made his way off the mountain to alert rescuers after making
comfortable Dr Herd and the fourth climber, Robin Dawson, 26, from
Dumfries.
Dr Herd, an experienced climber and skier, was flown by helicopter to
Skye and then Glasgow's Southern General Hospital but died later from
her injuries.
She had been at the practice in Peterhead for only 18 months after
completing her training. She was taking a holiday before starting as a
senior house officer in obstetrics at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.
Originally from Cumbria, she studied at St Andrews and Manchester
universities and specialised in cancer treatment at hospitals in
Lancaster, Manchester and Glasgow before moving to Peterhead.
Her father, Brian Herd, stood down as the Liberal Democrat prospective
candidate for Cumbria-North Lancaster in the Euro elections after the
tragedy.
The inquiry, to be held at Dingwall Sheriff Court on March 20, could
have widespread implications concerning mountain safety in the wake of
recent tragedies.
Normally accident inquiries are held into deaths that occur during a
person's work, but the Crown has discretionary powers to call an inquiry
if it is felt it will be in the public interest.
The hearing, which is expected to last up to a week, will hear from
nearly 30 witnesses and is likely to cover topics such as access to the
mountains, avalanche warnings and the role of mountain rescue teams.

SOCIAL work is very aware of the thin line it needs to tread between
on the one hand protecting the welfare of the child and on the other
respecting the rights and responsibilities of parents. The problem is
that a large proportion of alleged child abuse cases do not fit easily
into straightforward categories of innocence or guilt.
The social worker is sometimes acting on limited information and yet
that information is highly significant. It could dictate that some major
injustice or injury has or might be done to a child. As one of the major
custodians of the protection of children, the social work authority must
start the careful and painstaking process of trying to establish whether
the allegation is true, false, malicious or imagined.
Not to act, social work would be failing in its duty to children as
Mary Hartnoll, Strathclyde's Director, said today, but ultimately it is
the courts that decide on truth -- not social workers, not doctors, not
police officers.
Yet again social work finds itself in the middle of a controversy
concerning the highly emotive subject of child abuse. The facts,
however, are that such abuse does take place and that a number of
Scotland's children experience a childhood that leaves them deeply
damaged and with a feeling of shame and guilt for the experience they
have endured at the hands of adults they trusted.
The general public expect the social work profession always to get it
right. The truth is, however, that ''getting it right'' might look
different depending on whether you are the child, the parent, or the
social worker conducting the investigation. The very process of
conducting an investigation into alleged abuse often generates outrage
from the parents or carers of the child.
At the initial stage there may be little concrete evidence. The social
worker has to weigh up the possibility of the allegation being
groundless, and yet at the same time recognising the risk to them if
they fail to act immediately and something even worse happens to the
child.
For those people who have experience of children they will know how
extraordinarily difficult it can be to establish when a child is telling
''the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth'', and how much
more difficult it is to establish this with very young children who
perhaps are not able to communicate verbally at all.
Imagine how much more difficult it is therefore in circumstances where
a child is at the centre of an investigation. Who are these adults they
are suddenly expected to trust and disclose all to? If they actually
tell, will they be believed? If they are not, they might feel much more
at risk if they continue to stay where they are with the alleged
perpetrator.
And how is the process of questioning and investigation to be
undertaken? Each child is different. Each set of circumstances is
different. The social worker must tread the delicate path of steering a
course between sensitively listening to the child and not leading them
down a particular pathway. While a number of local authorities have
introduced practice guidance, procedures, and training for interviewing
children, the Scottish Office has still to bring forward its proposals,
even although Lord Clyde recommended this over two years ago.
Training and procedures are important and can most certainly help, but
there are no simplistic packages that can be lifted from the shelf and
be followed to the letter of the law by every social worker in every
case. The key point to recognise is the importance of striking the
appropriate balance between carefully listening and taking seriously
what the child has to say but neither believing nor disbelieving until
the necessary information and evidence is available to enable more
informed judgments to be made.
This process of investigation is extremely time consuming and
demanding on the child, the family, and the social workers. It needs to
be undertaken by people with the wisdom and experience to recognise
their responsibilities to the child and family set against the inherent
danger of drawing conclusions too quickly.
Social work takes fierce pride in defending its rich history of
protecting and promoting the welfare of some of Scotland's most
vulnerable and damaged children. By its very nature this work is private
and unseen -- it goes on all the time and in the majority of cases is
highly successful and supports both children and parents in securing the
appropriate respect for the rights and dignity of each child.
I wish it were possible to say that easy solutions were waiting just
round the corner and if only we could find them everything would be
fine. The truth is, however, that social work, and all of the other
services involved in protecting children, need constantly to review
procedures and training, to initiate research, and to seek the necessary
changes in the law to protect children and parents from injustice and
unfair treatment.
Increasingly in Scotland social work and the police co-operate to
undertake child protection work in a careful, sensitive, and balanced
way. As social work finds itself yet again in the middle of fierce
controversy we might be wise to reflect on the comments in The Herald
editorial yesterday which says: ''Truth may be an absolute, but that
doesn't mean it is always easy to find.''
Social workers share with others the tough and challenging
responsibility of seeking to find the truth in cases of child
protection. Sometimes social workers make mistakes and get it wrong. In
the majority of cases, however, the balance struck by social workers
secures protection and safety for children who would otherwise be at
great risk.
The general public of Scotland can have confidence that the social
work profession will always be humble enough to recognise that there are
always lessons to be learned, always improvements to be made, but that
our starting point is very sound, namely the protection of the welfare
of Scotland's most vulnerable children.

Work.

<TEXT>
THE son of a convicted murderer was jailed for life yesterday for the
killing and sexual mutilation of an elderly couple.
Judge Neil Denison recommended that Milton Wheeler, 24, should serve a
minimum of 18 years for the ''truly awful'' killings.
At the Old Bailey on Monday, Wheeler denied murdering Mr Madhavi
Ambasna, 82, and his wife Raliat, 72, last April, but admitted
manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
He also admitted raping a girl and indecently assaulting another. He
forced both at knifepoint to the flat where the couple's bodies lay.
His pleas were accepted by the prosecution because three psychiatrists
agreed he was suffering from a deep-rooted and long-standing psychotic
illness which is untreatable but means he is extremely dangerous.
Concurrent sentences totalling 14 years were passed for the attacks on
the two girls.
The court heard that Wheeler had attacked the elderly couple in their
home because he bore them a trivial grudge. They were repeatedly stabbed
and their throats were cut. Wheeler then sexually mutilated the bodies.
He was described by leading psychiatrist Dr Ian Strickland as having
''a significant degree of sexual sadism, an extreme degree of coldness
and callous detachment, a complete absence of sympathy, remorse, or
empathy for his victims, a desire to dominate those around him, and
little or no feeling for other people or any concern for the
consequences of his actions''.
Hours after the brutal killings last April, Wheeler lured two girls
aged 14 and 18 to a flat where he raped one and indecently assaulted the
other.
Then he marched them at knife-point to another flat in a tower block
in Benson Close, Hounslow, opposite the Ambasnas' home, and committed
further sexual assaults.
Both girls, who were in court to see him jailed, are receiving
counselling.
When Wheeler was six, his father Russell Gainford was jailed for life
for murdering a 77-year-old woman by slashing her throat. He was
released on licence two years ago.
Wheeler was beaten by his father and sexually abused by his brother
and was jailed when 18 for attempting to rape a girl. After he changed
his name and left his home town of Accrington, Lancashire.
Wheeler's brother was jailed for 10 years for raping a woman he forced
to watch and re-enact pornographic videos.

COMPUTER hackers are seriously threatening sensitive data within
Scottish Office information banks, it emerged last night.
New St Andrews House and other Scottish governmental buildings are
included in a technology warning issued yesterday by the National Audit
Office. The NAO revealed that reported incidents of computer hacking,
viruses, and theft rose steeply during 1993-94.
NAO official Stephen Luxford said: ''The Scottish Office and quangos
are included in the report which is the first undertaken for over three
years. There has been a big rise in hacking of sensitive and
unclassified but not top secret information.''
Hacking incidents during the year under scrutiny rose by 140%
involving up to 655 separate acts, whilst the viruses rate accounted for
a 350% rise with 562 discovered cases.
Theft of equipment such as portable and laptop computers and printers
involved 433 incidents, costing the Government #1.2m. The report added,
however, that the theft rate should be seen against the #2bn the
Government invests in information technology each year
The NAO said it was difficult to be more specific about the actual
whereabouts of hacking, viruses or theft actions due to a preserved
anonymity associated with the report.

<HEADLINE>Call for inquiry into Knoydart firm Future of Highlands estate in doubt after shareholders' group demands fraud squad probe</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979615971</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE future of Scotland's ''last great wilderness'', the Knoydart
peninsula, was thrown into doubt yesterday as the brother of the
chairman of Titaghur plc which owns it called for a fraud squad
investigation into the company.
Just two years after buying the 16,500 acre estate for #1.7m, Titaghur
admitted that it is ''seriously considering its future'' after losing
#345,000 on the venture last year.
In amazing scenes yesterday minority shareholders led by the
chairman's brother called for a Department of Trade investigation and
the intervention of the fraud squad to unravel the firm's dealings.
Titaghur is wrestling with financial difficulties in India where it
has made huge losses and run up ''substantial debts''. The company's
accumulated deficit now stands at #67.5m.
The firm, which employs 17,000 workers in six jute mills near
Calcutta, also admits it is in arrears with its taxes and pension fund
payments.
The company yesterday held its AGM in Dundee, where it maintains a
registered office, and angry shareholders said that they were
''mystified'' as to why a textile firm would want to own a Scottish
estate.
In 1993, Titaghur unveiled controversial plans to launch a ''Young
Persons Training Scheme'' with a ''Back to Basics'' course for deprived
youngsters.
The scheme was the brainchild of the Titaghur chairman, Mr Reg Brealey
who is also chairman of Sheffield United, but aroused opposition.
As irate shareholders demanded answers at the annual general meeting,
it appeared that the plans have been shelved.
In his chairman's statement, Mr Reg Brealey, said that the Knoydart
plan had ''been delayed due to planning refusal and had to be put on
hold''.
He added: ''I had very high hopes for this project and still do, but
due to continual losses we are seriously considering its future.''
In the late 1980s shares in Titaghur, which are now worth pennies,
rocketed to #17.00p earning speculators a fortune.
The shares were suspended by the Stock Exchange in 1989 and Mr Brealey
was arrested becoming the first man in Britain to be charged with
insider dealing. His QC, Mr George Carman, succeeded in getting the
charges thrown out of court two years later.
At the AGM, Mr Brealey's brother Len, 62, now a bitter enemy of the
chairman, led a group of rebel shareholders who control 12% of the
shares in calling for investigations by the Department of Trade, the
fraud squad and the insider dealer group of the Stock Exchange into the
affairs of Titaghur.
Mr Len Brealey claimed that two of his brother's supporters had tried
to eject him when he rose in the meeting at the Earl Grey Hotel, Dundee,
to raise the call for a DTI investigation.
Witnesses confirmed that Mr Brealey stood firm and his brother
relented allowing him to stay in the meeting.
He claimed: ''I have lost #80,000 out of my pension fund. A lot of
people have lost their savings because of promises made by my brother.
My motion that the DTI investigate the company was ruled out of order.
But I will persist with the campaign to call the authorities in.''
Mr Reg Brealey declined repeated requests for an interview.
Mr Wayne Lumsden, a proxy shareholder who formerly acted for Titaghur
in raising capital said: ''I am mystified as to why this company bought
Knoydart. I can only conclude it was done on the personal whim of the
chairman.
''I cannot understand why the company has spent so much time and
energy in acquiring Scottish property.''
The former owner of Knoydart, Mr Philip Rhodes, was also at the
meeting. He claims that #100,000 of the purchase price has yet to be
paid over and is involved in two court actions against Titaghur.
He said: ''I regret the way that Knoydart was sold and I have not been
paid in full. It has left me with troubles with the Inland Revenue and
troubles with the Bank of Scotland.''

Washington, Tuesday
IRAN has deployed Hawk missiles on islands at the entrance to the Gulf
within range of shipping lanes for oil tankers, America's top general
warned.
''We spotted them putting missiles on to launchers, which they haven't
done before,'' said General John Shalikashvili, the chairman of the
Joint US Chiefs of Staff.
Hawks are US-made anti-aircraft missiles. Iran and the United Arab
Emirates across the Gulf have a long-standing dispute over three islands
in the area. Shalikashvili did not identify the islands to which the
Iranians were moving the missiles, but referred to them as Iran's.
Shalikashvili told reporters that US reconnaissance has also spotted
the Iranians moving artillery into forward positions on its islands in
the Hormuz Strait.
''All of that could lead me to lots of conclusions,'' he said. ''One
of them is that they want to have the capability to interdict the
traffic in the Strait of Hormuz.''
The strait is among the most important oil-tanker routes in the world.
''We are watching it very carefully,'' Shalikashvili said.
He added that at the moment, Iraq was still regarded as the most
serious military threat in the Gulf region.
''But I think as you look towards the end of the century, the
beginning of the next century, we have to be very mindful that Iran can
become that major threat,'' he said.
He said that if Iran were able to develop weapons of mass destruction,
''I think we would face a very, very serious challenge and all our
friends in that area would face a very serious challenge. I am very
worried about Iran.''
The US has been trying without success to persuade Russia to cancel
plans to sell a nuclear power plant to Iran. The Russians say the
plant's design makes it difficult to extract material for nuclear
weapons.--AP.

<TEXT>
A DIPLOMAT sacked for taking money from an Iranian businessman made up
letters to explain away #5000 deposited in his brother-in-law's bank
account, an industrial tribunal was told yesterday.
Mr Andrew Balfour, who was vice consul in Dubai, arranged visas for
businessman Mehrdad Ansari Shirazi.
Mr David Anderson, representing the Foreign Office at the tribunal in
Croydon, Surrey, said the #5000 was paid into the account of Mr
Balfour's brother-in-law, Mr Alan Broomhead, who runs a graphic
reproduction business.
In May 1989, some days after the money was deposited, Mr Balfour was
sent back to London and interviewed by police on his arrival.
Mr Broomhead, who has his business in Lytham, Lancashire, was also
arrested. He told police he wrote three fictitious letters at his
brother-in-law's prompting to suggest a deposit had been made by Mr
Ansari for work to be carried out.
When questioned by detectives on arrival in Britain, Mr Ansari claimed
the #5000 was a loan.
Mr Ansari had arranged about 25 visas through Balfour over a period of
one-and-a-half years.
Mr Balfour has claimed he was asked by his MI6 station officer to
befriend Mr Ansari, an important contact.
Yesterday's hearing represents the culmination of Mr Balfour's
six-year battle to clear his name.
He and his brother-in-law, along with Mr Ansari, were arrested under
the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which allows for an extended detention
period.
Mr Balfour was dismissed in 1990 after an internal disciplinary
hearing found he had breached diplomatic service rules by accepting a
gift.
At the disciplinary hearing, Mr Balfour argued he had known nothing
about the money being paid into his brother-in-law's account, said Mr
Anderson.
The tribunal will announce its decision today, on whether any or all
of the evidence should be heard in private.

Rochester, New York, Tuesday
AN IRISH priest caught with part of the loot from a #4.5m armoured-car
robbery in New York was last night sentenced to four years and three
months in prison, despite appeals for mercy from more than 100 clerics
and friends.
The Rev Patrick Moloney, who ran a city shelter for troubled teenagers
and illegal immigrants, bowed his head when Judge David Larimer referred
to him as a thief. Only about half the money was recovered.
Investigators believe the rest was sent to the IRA.
''Based on your prior life, you should have known better,'' Judge
Larimer told 62-year-old Moloney, who said he could not believe he had
been convicted and apologised for the crime.
The priest and Samuel Millar, a 39-year-old from Northern Ireland,
where he served eight years for a botched bombing, were convicted on
November 28 of conspiracy to possess stolen money. Millar is to be
sentenced on Thursday.
Authorities found $2m (#1.3m) on November 12, 1993, in a New York City
flat used by the two men and $168,000 in a safe in the priest's bedroom.
Some of the notes had serial numbers linking the find to the United
States' fifth-largest armoured-car robbery.
The rest of the money stolen at gunpoint on January 5, 1993, from a
Brink's depot in Rochester is missing. Investigators have said they
suspect it was sent to the IRA.
Charles McCormick, an unemployed teacher who sublet the flat to the
priest, and Thomas O'Connor, a former Brink's guard who smuggled Millar
into the United States in 1984 and was suspected of masterminding the
robbery, were acquitted during the trial.--AP/Reuter.

Mogadishu, Tuesday
US AND Italian marines secured Mogadishu's airfield and sea port today
after amphibious landings in the perilous mission to evacuate the last
UN peacekeepers from Somalia.
The bulk of the 1800-strong US force, backed by 400 Italians, began
storming ashore in landing craft in the early hours.
By dusk the operation had passed off without any bloodshed in a nation
where 132 peacekeepers and hundreds of Somalis have been killed over the
last two years.
However a hitch in Mogadishu port traffic meant that Operation United
Shield could take longer than expected to organise the withdrawal of the
last 1500 Pakistani UN forces.
Some sporadic shooting could be heard in the lawless city throughout
the day, but fewer stray rounds than in recent days whistled over the
positions of foreign troops.
The marines took up positions in dozens of armoured vehicles and
machinegun nests behind sandbags and coils of razor wire. Hovercraft
landed in the same spots where thousands of US marines arrived in
December 1992 to end Somalia's famine.
The later peace mission by Unosom (UN Operation in Somalia) to restore
peace and government to the Horn of Africa country failed, despite the
presence of 30,000 troops from 28 nations.
Somalia is still in chaos and the last foreign troops will be gone in
a few days.
This time, US forces were taking no chances. A ''Spectre'' AC-130
gunship aircraft circled above but no Super Cobra helicopter gunships
appeared. They were hated symbols of American military might in
Mogadishu because they bombed and machinegunned districts in 1993.
Ships offshore included the Royal Navy destroyer Exeter, standing by
to monitor the movements of merchant ships chartered for the withdrawal.
The destroyer, some three miles off Mogadishu with 290 men and women
on board, was also ready to provide gunfire support if necessary.
The Type 42 Portsmouth-based guided missile destroyer, under the
command of Captain John Hance, left the UK in November and is due to
return to her home port in about a month's time.
On shore, US Marine Lieutenant General Tony Zinni took over command of
the beach-head bases from Unosom in a ceremony with blue-helmeted UN
officers.
Unosom officials, including special envoy Victor Gbeho, then flew out
of Mogadishu for the last time.
As soon as the marines consolidated their positions around the port,
fortified by walls of cargo containers, 900 Bangladeshi soldiers boarded
a ship ready to leave.
The remaining Pakistani rearguard was originally set to pull back
tonight from the perimeter of the airport to the nearby port with their
tanks and armoured vehicles.
Howwever port sources said completion of the operation would be
delayed until at least tomorrow because a Pakistani ship was late in
arriving.
Impatient crowds of Somali youths pressed at the gates of the
airfield, waiting for the chance to loot any items left behind by the
UN. Pakistani soldiers at the gates fired shots over the heads of the
crowd.

BERLIN: Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said that European Union states
must take greater responsibility for international security by
organising joint military missions independent of Nato, in Europe and
abroad.
In a speech to the German Society for Foreign Affairs, he said:
''There are other demands that Europeans can and must respond to, in
Europe and beyond: peacekeeping, crisis management, humanitarian
operations, sanctions enforcement.''
While a Nato firmly grounded in US commitment to the Continent was the
bulwark of European defence against invasion, western Europeans must
shoulder more responsibility for international security, he said.
Mr Hurd suggested, for example, that quicker action to interpose
European troops between the opposing parties in Croatia when fighting

Yugoslavia.
''We need to be better equipped and better organized to prevent and
fight these fires,'' he said. Europeans cannot and should not ''expect
direct American involvement in every crisis or operation in Europe or on
the periphery,'' he said.
Mr Hurd said he was not calling for a European army, but rather
combined joint task forces under the wing of the Western European Union
military alliance. Such units could evacuate European citizens from war
zones, he said.
Combined WEU units could also be effective in humanitarian missions in
places like Rwanda, he added.--Reuter/AP.

A DIVER helping to salvage a secret haul of smuggled drugs died after
his safety and signal lines were severed -- apparently cut through
deliberately with a knife.
An inquiry was told yesterday that when Stewart Locke's body was
recovered from the water, he was no longer wearing his air tanks and
diving helmet.
Mr Locke, 24, died helping Customs officers recover cannabis with a
street value of more than #20m from the beached vessel Ambrosia off the
Aberdeenshire coast in October 1993.
The drugs -- one of the biggest finds in Scotland -- were strewn over
the seabed and Scotstown Beach after the converted trawler sank and
broke up.
The fatal accident inquiry at Peterhead heard that Mr Locke was
connected to the shore with a safety rope and a communications line.
Detective Inspector Ronald Falconer, who investigated the death, said
they had probably been severed by a knife.
Holding up and pointing at a photograph of the equipment, he said:
''It appears to be a precise cut with a sharp knife.''
Constable Douglas McGillivray, 47, a police diving superintendent
whose team of five divers was called in to assist commercial divers
recover the drugs, told the inquiry how he watched the tragedy unfold.
He said Mr Locke had waded out towards the wreck of the Ambrosia,
struggling against strong tides and currents to reach the beached
vessel.
After about 15 minutes he had reached a position 200 yards offshore
and the lines went tight, said Constable McGillivray.
''As we stood there the line came clean and started returning,'' he
said.
''Quite a large quantity of the rope was pulled in very easily and
within 45 seconds a cut came ashore.
''At this stage I formed the opinion that Mr Locke had got trapped in
wreckage and cut himself free. We all waited for him to surface.
''He appeared on the surface perhaps 300 to 400 yards distant from us.
We could see that he was not moving.''
Asked by depute fiscal Ray Craig what he did then, Constable
McGillivray said he sent two of his divers into the water to rescue Mr
Locke.
The two divers gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and heart massage in
the water before being swamped by a wave.
''Mr Locke was recovered from the water and taken onto the sand,''
said Constable McGillivray. ''I took over the mouth-to-mouth for several
minutes but without success.''
Constable McGillivray told the inquiry Mr Locke was not wearing his
air tanks and helmet when he was found, and his neck brace was open.
Under cross-examination for Mr Locke's widow, Claire, of Baird Road,
Strichen, Constable McGillivray said in his opinion Mr Locke's
two-strong back-up team was not properly equipped for the dive.
He said that under the Health and Safety regulations a standby diver
was required at all times to be fully equipped and ready to go into the
water.
''I was not personally sure which of the two people in his team was
the standby diver.''
Asked why he was unsure, Constable McGillivray replied: ''Neither of
them were wearing diving equipment at any time.''
The inquiry continues.

<TEXT>
A MAN who threatened to circulate love letters written by his former
lover's new boyfriend was sentenced to 200 hours community service at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday.
Anthony Law, 46, had told his victim he would give photocopies of the
letters to her children's schoolfriends so they could take them home to
their parents.
Law, from the Carrick Knowe area of Edinburgh, admitted stealing
letters from his former lover's home in March last year and writing
offensive messages on walls and a mirror.
He also admitted attempting to extort money and jewellery from the
woman by threatening to send copies of the stolen letters to her family
and friends.
The woman, who is separated from her husband and lives in Edinburgh,
told the court that she had a two-year affair with Law, who is himself
married, although he did not tell her that at first.
She described how she arrived home with her children one afternoon to
discover an offensive message written in felt tip in six-inch-high
letters on her living room wall.
The word ''bitch'' was also written on her ironing-board.
A long mirror in the bedroom had been placed on the bed and written on
in lipstick.
The woman then found that letters to her from Law had been taken along
with letters from another man.
When asked to describe the content of the letters from the other man
she said that they were ''personal'' and ''special''.
''To anyone else they would appear to be pornographic, I think,'' she
added.
The woman said she received a phone call from Law in which she claimed
he said he would hand out photocopies of the letters to her neighbours,
her husband, and even her children's schoolfriends.
She told the jury that he said there was something she could do to
prevent that happening but it took her some time to realise what he was
getting at.
''I said ''Do you mean that you want me to give you money?' and he
said ''I think I deserve a little reward'.''
She claimed that he then said he wanted a decent holiday and mentioned
her car which she believed was worth about #8000.
Defence counsel Frances McMenamin said that Law suspected the woman of
seeing someone else and had ended sexual relations with her.
''There was an obsession with the fact that the woman, when confronted
with the letters, still refused to admit that she was having affairs
with other people,'' said Miss McMenamin.
She added that when Law went to retrieve his letters and found the
ones from the other man amongst them he changed from an affectionate,
normal person to a ''raging madman''.
Miss McMenamin said the innocent party who had suffered most was Mrs
Law who is disabled and dependent on her husband, who is unemployed, for
help at home and to get around outdoors.
''She is fully aware of everything that has happened in this case and
she fully stands by her husband,'' said Miss McMenamin.
She added that Law had already been punished by the loss of his good
name and his self-respect.
Sheriff Hazel Aronson, QC, told Law that his crime was serious but she
would not jail him because of the ''strong mitigating factors'' put
forward on his behalf.

A MAN has been captured on video setting himself on fire as he tried
to fire-bomb a shop.
The man had hurled three petrol bombs which caused around #1000 of
damage to the front of the property in Musselburgh, East Lothian. The
glass doors shattered in the blaze that followed.
The attack was captured on video by the Asian family who own the shop
and who installed the equipment as a security measure after a number of
earlier incidents.
The Ashgar family, who say a racist campaign is being co-ordinated
against them by an inmate of Saughton Prison, last night spoke of their
three-month ordeal.
They said their house has been broken into, slogans daubed on the
outside of their shop, and their van and car vandalised. They also said
friends have been beaten up and targeted for verbal abuse.
The latest incident happened on Sunday night at their shop, Raja
Stores, in the town's Delta Drive.
Rabina Aslam, co-owner of the shop, said: ''The fire-bomb attack was
the latest in a long-line of incidents here. Three months ago we had no
shutters on the shop front. Now we have metal sheeting up and
closed-circuit television on it.''
Andrew Moffat, 16, said he had been attacked because he is a friend of
the family.
He said: ''I have been beaten up because I know them. People call me a
Paki-lover. I can't understand why this is happening.''
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said: ''A man was seen to
throw the bottles at the shop and then run from Delta Drive towards Galt
Avenue.''

<TEXT>
Washington, Tuesday
IRISH Foreign Minister Dick Spring said that it would be a ''formula
for disaster'' to insist on disarmament by the IRA and other Northern
Ireland guerrilla groups before moving ahead with peace talks.
Mr Spring, in Washington to brief US leaders on last week's UK-Irish
peace proposals, also said he saw nothing wrong with Sinn Fein
fund-raising in the United States, which it is not currently allowed to
do.
The arms issue is key to the peace effort, with Northern Ireland
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew repeating this week that the IRA must make
''substantial progress'' on scrapping its arsenal before Britain would
hold ''substantive'' talks.
Sir Patrick angered hard-line Protestants by hinting that Ministers
might take part in current exploratory talks with Sinn Fein if there was
evidence of progress. The talks have so far involved only officials.
''If we take the attitude that nothing will happen unless there's a
surrender or decommissioning of arms, then I think that's a formula for
disaster,'' Mr Spring told reporters. ''Nothing will happen.
''This is one very important aspect, but I don't think it should be
put up as a totem pole, that unless you solve this one first, nothing
else can happen.''
Mr Spring said he believed that neither the IRA nor Protestant
paramilitary groups wanted to go back to fighting after 26 years of
conflict which ended with a ceasefire last September. However,
decommissioning arms would take time, he said.
US secretary of state Warren Christopher, who welcomed Mr Spring to
Washington yesterday, said the next step in the peace process was for
the rival guerrilla groups to start disarming.
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has applied for a visa to visit the
United States next month, when he is expected to press the fund-raising
issue. Mr Christopher has said the request is being considered.
Mr Spring said he did not see the hostility of the Unionists to the
new peace proposals as a fatal obstacle and he derided ideas they might
bring down the Government over the issue.
That would be ''a bit like turkeys voting for Christmas'', he added.
Mr Spring, who was tonight meeting Vice-President Al Gore, said: ''I
think the Unionists themselves are looking for some way to get into the
frame by virtue of putting their own papers on the table. I think
they're trying to keep options open.''--Reuter/AP.

the Church of England and the United Reformed Church, who were allocated
places in the past year.
The board, in its report to the Assembly, says that these four new

MEXICO CITY: Raul Salinas, the brother of former Mexican President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was arrested yesterday for allegedly
masterminding the murder last September of the ruling party's
secretary-general, Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
Ruiz Massieu, the second-ranking leader of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), was murdered with a single bullet to the neck
as he left a Mexico City hotel last September 28.
Carlos Salinas, who was still in power at the time of the murder, left
office on December 1.
Word of his brother's arrest came on the heels of an unprecedented
statement by Carlos Salinas on television to deny allegations that his
government was guilty of a cover-up in the assassination last March of
Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI's original candidate for presidential
elections.--Reuter.

Moscow, Tuesday
RUSSIA said today it had broken the back of Chechen resistance after
11 weeks of fighting, and put the number of rebels killed at up to 7000.
However Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, who has been strongly
criticised for his handling of Moscow's Chechen campaign in which
thousands of civilians are also feared to have died, warned that attacks
by Chechen fighters would continue.
Interfax quoted Grachev as saying the core of fighters loyal to
separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev had been destroyed in the battle for
the Chechen capital, Grozny, but ''terrorist acts against Russian forces
can be expected for some time by separate band formations''.
Grachev was addressing a top-level military review of the campaign,
which he said would be reviewed thoroughly.
Itar-Tass quoted Colonel-General Fyodor Ladygin, head of the Defence
Ministry's intelligence directorate, as saying Moscow's troops had
killed 7000 Chechen fighters.
Dudayev still had 14,000 troops, of whom, he said, 5000 were
mercenaries.
At the climax of the operation to take the now-devastated Grozny,
which was finally encircled eight days ago, 38,000 Russian troops were
involved, Grachev said.
The deputy head of Russia's counter-intelligence agency, Valentin
Sobolyov, told a news conference that about 1200 Russian troops were
killed in the Chechen campaign.
Russia's human rights commission says that 24,000 civilians have died
in Grozny alone under Russian bombardment.
Russian forces today shelled rebel positions south of Grozny and told
residents to negotiate if they did not want to see the destruction of
their town.
RABAT: A 37-year-old Egyptian who appeared deranged set off a
home-made bomb at the Russian embassy in Rabat, Morocco, after trying to
attack the consul with a knife. The man, who spoke both English and
Arabic, had a small poster with ''Chechnya'' in Arabic on him. His
condition was said to be serious.--Reuter.

Washington, Tuesday
REPUBLICAN leaders in the Senate abruptly postponed the final vote on
the balanced budget amendment this evening. They were one vote short of
the two-thirds majority they needed to pass the measure, and preferred
postponement to defeat.
They had earlier agreed to water down the bill severely, by accepting
a Democratic amendment which would forbid the courts to enforce the new
law. Balanced budgets would thus be precribed by the Constitution
without any enforcement mechanism, beyond Congress's own conscience, an
unreliable instrument.
Even with the amendment, there were only 66 sure votes out of 100. All
evening, Republican leaders, and their few Democratic allies, worked on
the two or three opponents whom they thought might yet be wayed.
They failed, and Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, took to the
floor to announce grimly that the vote would be postponed.

<RECORDNO>979615986</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FIRE-EATER who claimed that paraffin he used in his stage act put
him over the drink-drive limit was banned for 18 months yesterday after
expert tests failed to support him.
However, after being sentenced at Camberley Magistrates' Court in
Surrey, Darryn Saville, 28, insisted: ''I know what happened that night
-- and it was paraffin that put me over the drink-drive limit.
''We have just not been able to prove that it was the paraffin that
put me over. I am sure it was the case.''
Saville, who also is a juggler, was banned for 18 months and fined
#650 with #60 costs after admitting drink-driving.
The court was told he was arrested shortly after leaving the Quays
Restaurant in Mytchett, Surrey, on July 30 last year.
Mr Philip Blakeborough, prosecuting, said Saville's Bedford van was
stopped by police when they noticed it had a faulty brake light.
Officers smelt alcohol on his breath and a roadside test proved
positive.
A further breath test at Camberley Police Station showed he was
two-and-a-half times the legal limit.
Mr David Sanderman, defending, told the court: ''On the day in
question, Mr Saville was engaged for the first time as a fire-breather
at the Quays Restaurant, where he used four and half litres of paraffin
throughout his act, which lasted some considerable time.
''It arose as a matter of law that the reading on the intoximeter was
possibly affected by paraffin, a fact not previously investigated or
settled -- it was a completely new topic.''
He said independent tests carried out at a laboratory in Cambridge had
not proven conclusively that paraffin had caused his client to exceed
the drink-drive limit.
''The tests showed the effect could not have been large enough to
affect the intoximeter.''
Outside court, 6ft 4in Saville, a ceramic tiler, of York Road, Woking,
Surrey, said: ''The doctor who did the test said it was impossible to
recreate exactly what happened.''
He added: ''I have cut down on my fire-eating recently since finding
out it can do irreparable damage to your lungs if the paraffin goes down
the wrong way.''

THE Defence Ministry's firing range at Dundrennan, four miles from
Kirkcudbright, is to be reprieved for a minimum of three years along
with 90 of its 120 civilian jobs.
The range, used to evaluate the depleted uranium anti-tank shells used
in the Gulf war and the site of UK experiments on a top-secret
electromagnetic gun, was due to be run down with the loss of 90 jobs
under Government plans announced last year to cut defence spending.
It now appears that a rethink on the availability of land for weapons'
testing and interest by the Army in using some of Dundrennan's remote
4000 acres for other training has produced an about turn.
The range will be kept open until 1998 to allow completion of
''certain current armaments' testing contracts'', according to defence
sources. The Army's ''significant interest'' is then likely to lead to
the appointment of civilian support staff.
A small team of about 20 would also be retained to continue work on
the revolutionary electromagnetic weapon developed under the Star Wars
programme.
Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council spearheaded a campaign last
year to save the range, one of the major employers in the area.
Councillor John Dowson, chairman of the region's economic development
committee, said last night: ''We are giving a cautious welcome to the
news that the site is to be given at least a partial reprieve, and
breathing space to attract new business.
''It is an obvious triumph for local people and for the campaign for
retention.''
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, who is the local MP, said he also
welcomed the Defence Ministry's change of heart.
Mr Lang is understood to have joined district and regional councillors
in both public and private lobbying of Defence Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind.
Dundrennan was the subject of controversy in 1992 when
environmentalists claimed that the thousands of depleted uranium shells
fired from the site into the adjoining Solway Firth could produce
radioactive contamination.
The protest was sparked by British and American veterans, who claimed
they were suffering from Gulf War Syndrome as a result of exposure to
the same kind of ammunition.

POLICE officers who restrained a 20-stone schizophrenic who had lived
as a recluse for seven years and who died in their arms as they tried to
handcuff him have been exonerated by a sheriff.
In a fatal accident inquiry judgment, Sheriff Bruce Kerr at Glasgow
says that there were no reasonable precautions where the death of
40-year-old Edward Fullarton might have been avoided.
He added that there was no system of working or defects in any system
of working which contributed to the death of Mr Fullarton, who lived
with his parents at Penneld Road, Glasgow.
The sheriff states that because no evidence was led before him on the
extent of police training to deal with people suffering from psychotic
illnesses, including schizophrenia, he could not make any suggestion on
whether police should receive instruction, or more instruction, in the
risks arising from such confrontations.
But he recorded this suggestion so that ''the chief constable may give
such consideration to it as he may think fit''.
The Herald has learned that the whole issue of how officers are
trained to deal with the mentally ill, particularly schizophrenics, is
likely to be raised soon at the Association of Chief Police Officers of
Scotland by Mr Leslie Sharp, Strathclyde's Chief Constable.
It also will be debated by the Scottish Police Federation, the
association which represents 95% of Scottish police, at its conference
at Peebles in April and there is likely to be a call for adequate
training as a matter of urgency.
The federation also says that it is adding its weight to a request for
a fatal accident inquiry made to the Crown Office by lawyers
representing the wife and child of the late Constable Lewis Fulton, the
Strathclyde officer stabbed to death last year by a young schizophrenic,
now in the State Hospital.
Sheriff Kerr said that Mr Fullarton died at his home on March 30 last
year from cardio-respiratory failure because of postural asphyxia.
As a schizophrenic, he added, Mr Fullarton was more susceptible than a
normally healthy person to a risk of becoming distressed by a
confrontation with uniformed police officers and more generally at risk
of cardiac failure if subjected to stress. His daily drug dose could
have increased the possibility of cardiac arrest.
Because he lived a sedentary life as a recluse for seven years and had
become unfit and obese, he was more at risk from cardiac failure or
postural asphyxiation because of internal pressure on the diaphragm from
his abdomen.
When Constable Robert Price and WPC Sarah Wilson went to his home
after a 999 call made by Mr Fullarton himself, they were unaware of his
mental or physical condition.
Mr Fullarton became agitated and enraged when the officers were
allowed into the house and, after he assaulted the female officer by
pushing her, a violent struggle ensued, ending in Mr Fullarton's death.
Mr Thomas Rowatt, deputy general secretary of Strathclyde Police
branch of the SPF, said yesterday: ''While any death is unfortunate, I
am pleased that this judgment absolves the officers from any blame. But
this is two deaths we have had involving schizophrenics.
''The police are wholly inadequate as currently trained to deal with
those situations.
''Sheriff Kerr does not deal in his judgment with issues raised by
care in the community but it has become obvious from the increasing use
of police officers to deal with the mentally disturbed that the
effectiveness of this policy is at least very questionable.''

<TEXT>
PLANS by Central Regional Council to integrate all pupils with special
needs into mainstream schools have attracted the attention of the Tory
MP for Stirling, Mr Michael Forsyth. He calls the plans stupid.
Three schools are involved. The primary section of Dawson Park school
in Falkirk is scheduled to close in the next school year; the 35-pupil
Whins of Milton School in Stirling is earmarked for closure in 1997/98;
and Rossvail special school in Falkirk is due to close towards the end
of the century.
In a letter yesterday to Councillor Corrie McChord, leader of the
Labour-controlled council, Mr Forsyth described the proposals as
''nothing short of destructive dogma''.
He said: ''I can only imagine the anxiety caused to parents by these
stupid proposals, and hope that the council will take the earliest
possible opportunity to announce that they will be abandoned.''
After visiting the Whins of Milton school at the request of parents,
Mr Forsyth said: ''I'm astonished and dismayed to see that the region is
proposing to close all the special schools in its area and to end
parental choice by ensuring that parents have only one option, and that
is to send their children to mainstream schools.''
There was a case for educating children with learning difficulties
within mainstream schools, but an equally good case for retaining
special schools as an option.
''To consider closing a school such as Whins of Milton is an act of
dogma, which is being proposed by an educational authority which will
cease to exist in 12 months' time.
''It's a mystery to me why an education authority would want to
destroy facilities which are doing an excellent job, and have done for
many years.''
Councillor McChord described Mr Forsyth's views as incredible.
He said the MP, now a Minister at the Home Office, had backed
integration while he was Scottish Education Minister, and the Scottish
Office Education Department's policy since 1981 had been that children
with moderate learning difficulties should be provided with support to
stay in mainstream education.
He said the integration had been wholeheartedly endorsed by Mr
Forsyth's successor, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, as recently as May
1993 in a speech to the Scottish Conference of the National Association
for Special Educational Needs.

THE Prime Minister yesterday agreed to meet Liberal Democrat MP
Charles Kennedy to discuss the future of rail links to the Highlands and
the threatened closure of Motorail and sleeper services.
Replying to Mr Kennedy at Question Time, Mr Major defended
privatisation and said it would improve the quality of services in
Scotland.
To Opposition jeers, he said: ''I strongly believe that the
privatisation of the railways will improve the service. Not least
because a privatised service will have access to new sources of funds,
to increased investment in the rail services.''
He said he was prepared to meet with Mr Kennedy, but suggested the
Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP should discuss the matter with Transport
Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney first.
Later, Mr Kennedy welcomed the decision and added: ''We will use the
opportunity of these meetings to put forward the detailed social and
economic case for the retention, and indeed the expansion and improved
commercial profile, of these services.''
In the Lords, Transport Minister Viscount Goschen said the decision
taken by railway Franchising Director Roger Salmon in December, that
Motorail and certain sleeper services would not be included under
privatisation, was not final.
''No final decision has been made and no final decision will be made
until consultation,'' he said. Mr Salmon was due to consult widely on
the decision, he added.

THERE comes a moment when the most patient of us will snap. We may
have put up with insults, been goaded incessantly, seen less worthy
colleagues promoted instead of us, endured our nearest and dearest
squeezing the toothpaste tube in the middle. Then, one day, bam, we
decide we can put up with it no longer.
Yesterday was the day John Major decided he could no longer put up
with privatised utility bosses getting pay and perks rises of National
Lottery winner proportions without even having to go to the trouble of
buying a ticket.
Or, at any rate, he decided he could no longer put up with being gone
on at weekly by Mr Tony Blair at Prime Minister's Questions. Newspaper
pictures of Mr David Jefferies, chairman of the National Grid, smiling
-- as why should he not, given his new pay package deal worth #2m? --
may have proved the last straw.
Mr Major, paid infinitely less than these captains of near-monopoly
companies, for putting up with Mr Blair, Mr Ashdown and Mrs Teresa
Gorman, to name just a few, must have decided he only had two options.
Option A was to give himself a #2m pay rise but the parliamentary
majority for that looks even rockier than the one for his Government's
European policy. Option B was to signal to the bosses that the days of
wine and roses were over.
So, when Mr Blair made his now almost ritual demand that this abuse
should be stopped, Mr Major swopped the old script about it being a
matter for the shareholders and how he was not having any of your
socialist incomes policies for a new one and said he found these
increases of the sort of which Mr Jefferies is the latest beneficiary
''as distasteful as you do'' and that he was prepared to bring in
legislation to curb them if necessary.
This stunned almost everyone from the Labour lads and lasses who
expected this ''abuse'' to do them nicely as a vote-winning topic
perhaps all the way up to the General Election, to the Tories some of
whom may have had dreams of a seat on one of the privatised boards as a
well-earned reward for a life of toil at the behest of the party whips.
Mr Blair seemed a little stunned too. Perhaps his best course would
have been to congratulate Mr Major for accepting that the Opposition was
right after all and sit down. Instead, he asked two more questions which
Mr Major, doubtless rightly, suggested he was programmed to ask
regardless of what he had already been told.
Certainly, Mr Blair's condemnation of ''monopoly managers paying
themselves monopoly money'' had television news soundbite written all
over it and showed him not quite as quick at thinking on his feet as he
should be.
Mr Major is undoubtedly a true believer in market forces, but the
procession of smug top executives appearing before the Employment Select
Committee and announcing that they are worth every penny they are paid
appears to have finally got too much for him. So has the arrogance of
boards which have gone on dishing out absurd rewards despite the
evidence of widespread public dislike and distaste.
It would be interesting if Mr Gordon Brown became a real instead of a
Shadow Chancellor to see what a 100% tax on income above #100,000 would
do. Would all these industrial wonders stomp off to the United States,
Australia and so on leaving the national utilities to crumble in their
absence. One suspects not many would go, and that after those that did
the crumble factor would not be great.
However, Mr Major may have won only a temporary respite. If the rules
he proposes are easily circumvented by directors anxious to continue
giving their chums large chunks of the customers' money, Mr Blair will
be at him again and the next election will be that much closer.

EXCLUSIVE
DETAILED policy options for a Scottish Parliament are to be worked out
in a ''Governance of Scotland'' project to be initiated by a group of
centre-left Labour activists at a conference in Edinburgh on Friday.
Shadow Scotish Secretary George Robertson will address the John
Wheatley Centre in a keynote speech in which he will argue that a
domestic parliament could pursue a more distinctly Scottish approach in
many policy areas.
The Centre, established as a think tank, will set up groups to examine
seven policy areas. These will contain academics, trade unionists and
business, industrial and community leaders, not necessarily all party
members but with interests in how policy-making can be developed after
devolution.
In a paper prepared for the Centre, Mr Mark Lazarowicz, former leader
of Edinburgh District Council, states: ''Such policy development can put
current debates about constitutional change into a practical context and
can also answer some of the important questions about the way that a
Scottish parliament would be funded and its relationship with the
Westminster parliament and the rest of the UK''.
He says the parliament will be faced with ''expectations of speedy
action on the key issues''. If it is to meet the expectations, work has
to start well in advance of its actual establishment.
The project will initially concentrate on seven areas:
An economic and fiscal policy for Scotland; education and training;
the environmental agenda for Scotland; health policy; quangos and the
relationship between central and local government; women and equal
opportunity policy; and the Scottish media.
It will move on to consider relationships with Europe, anti-poverty
strategies and community care.
The different policy commissions will produce proposals for debate
through conferences and papers.
The Centre members feel that while the case for an assembly still has
to be argued with the present Prime Minister and Conservative Party,
supporters should not be distracted from drawing up plans of what the
Parliament should actually do.
Labour MPs in the Commons yesterday jeered when Mr Phil Gallie,
Conservative MP for Ayr, told Mr Major that his criticism of a
tax-raising assembly in his Glasgow speech last weekend had been widely
welcomed by Scottish business.
The Prime Minister said he was sure his audience of a thousand
businessmen believed an assembly would not be in the interests of
Scottish business, Scottish prosperity or future investment in Scotland,
adding ''that is strongly my view''.

A BILL which would have dramatically reduced the number of Scottish
MPs at Westminster was rejected by a substantial majority in the Commons
yesterday.
The House of Commons (Distribution of Seats) Bill would have reduced
the total number of MPs from 651 to 629 and possibly lower if devolution
for Wales and Scotland was ever given the go-ahead.
The Bill was introduced by Tory MP Spencer Batiste (Elmet) who argued
that parliamentary seats in Scotland and Wales had a smaller number of
electors than those in England and Northern Ireland.
The average constituency in England had 69,534 electors, in Northern
Ireland 67,145, Wales 58,383 and Scotland 54,741. He questioned whether
Scottish seats were so much more difficult to represent that they needed
a ''27% advantage in the size of the constituencies.''
While Mr Bastiste's Bill was rejected by 162 votes to 53 -- and never
had any chance of reaching the Statute Book -- it is indicative of the
thinking among a substantial number of MPs at Westminster. If the Scots
and the Welsh are intent on devolution, their representation at
Westminster will have to be substantially reduced.
The Bill sought to set a quota of 69,000 for a parliamentary seat,
which would involve a drop in Scotland from 72 seats to 56 and from 38
to 32 in Wales.
Mr Batiste warned those backing devolution that there was a downside
of fewer MPs being justified at Westminster.
The Bill was opposed and a vote forced by Labour MP Dr Norman Godman
(Greenock and Port Glasgow) who said it was ill-considered. In a
multi-nation state there was bound to be unevenness, with constituencies
where there were more electors than others.

THE Government yesterday announced it would strengthen its powers to
prevent and monitor pollution by shipping off Britain's coasts. The
measures were generally welcomed in the Commons, but some MPs said they
did not go far enough.
Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney said he would introduce
legislation to extend jurisdiction over pollution from the present 12 to
200 miles off the coast.
He said surveillance of vessels from the air would be increased by
25%. This will be carried out by two Cessna aircraft based at Inverness
and Coventry operated by Air Atlantique.
Dr Mawhinney said that while Britain would seek to obtain
international or Northern European regional agreement for measures to
identify substandard ships, the Government was prepared to act
unilaterally if this could not be achieved in a reasonable time.
He said that, while there was legislation in place to provide that the
polluter should pay for damage caused, the problem was to ensure that
the owners were able to pay and he was pressing for an extension of
compulsory liability insurance.
Ministers are considering a number of further measures against
klondikers, including taking powers to prevent loading or unloading and
to require vessels to leave British waters, also increased powers of
inspection and detention of ships in UK waters not on innocent or
transit passage.
Many of the Government proposals are adopted from the report of Lord
Donaldson's inquiry following the grounding of the oil tanker Braer off
Shetland in 1993.
Mr Michael Meacher, for Labour, called for international action ''to
increase detentions in many more ports of unseaworthy ships and
untrained crews, to bring it firmly home to shipowners that it no longer
pays to run unsafe ships.''
He urged Dr Mawhinney to withdraw ''the 15% cut this year in your own
Department's Marine Safety Agency budget, the 7% cut in the Marine
Accident Investigation Agency budget and the 6% cut in the Coastguard
Agency.''
Mr Jim Wallace, Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, said
later he very much regretted the lack of a timetable for implementation
of measures to promote klondyker safety.
He would be monitoring the current placing of salvage tugs at Dover
and in the Minches with a view to making a case for extending these
arrangements to Northern waters.
Mr Meacher earlier had complained that despite the stress in the
Donaldson report on the importance of communication between salvage
vessels and those they were assisting the two tugs the government had
commissioned were owned by a company employing ''non-English speaking
Croatian crews.''
Mr Andrew Welsh, for the SNP, said he was disappointed at the
Government's failure to support a mandatory exclusion zone for
environmentally sensitive areas which meant that areas like the Minch,
Orkney and Shetland would continue to be vulnerable to dangerous
radioactive shipments and oil cargoes.
The chairman of Shetland's Marine Operations Committee, Councillor
Willie Tait, expressed disappointment last night that Dr Mawhinney had
not announced coastal radar and a salvage tug for the islands.
However, he welcomed plans to make all tankers carry transponders --
electronic bleeper tags which will tell the authorities on shore when
large ships are approaching danger areas.

<TEXT>
SOCIAL Security Secretary Peter Lilley last night in the Commons
renewed his attack on foreigners claiming benefit in Britain.
He was speaking during a debate on orders approving
previously-announced uprating and amendment of social security benefits
and rules.
Labour was calling for repeal of regulations introduced last August to
curb so-called ''benefit tourism'' -- the claiming of benefit in the UK
by visiting foreign nationals.
The new rules introduced a habitual residence test for claimants,
which Labour says also has hit British citizens.
Mr Lilley said that Labour had been wrong to condemn the test from its
outset as ''anti-European'' and to insist that benefit tourism was ''a
non-problem''.
He would condemn Britons who went abroad to exploit other countries'
benefits, and he defended the Government's clampdown on foreign
claimants.
Foreign publications had at one time carried accounts of the situation
''because they could scarcely believe we had ever allowed this situation
to exist'', he said.
A Spanish magazine, Tribuna, said a holiday in Britain on benefit was
''a brilliant way to travel. You arrive in London one fine day, sign up
at an employment office and suddenly money and rebates fall at your feet
on a regular basis.''
Mr Lilley said that in the first six months of the test some 6000
Continental claimants of Income Support had been found to be not
habitually resident in the UK and there may be more claiming housing
benefits as well.
''Total savings from the test are running at #30m-a-year, even
ignoring any deterrent effect the announcement may have, so we stopped
the abuse in time.''
Labour social security spokesman Keith Bradley told the Commons: ''We
have no quarrel with rooting-out benefit tourism. But we are not certain
the measures before us achieve that purpose.''
The Labour bid to revoke the habitual residence test was defeated by
287 votes to 246, a Government majority of 41.

HOME Secretary Michael Howard last night appointed Lord Wyatt of
Weeford for a further two years as Tote chairman as part of moves to
change the horserace betting body.
The continuation of the 76-year-old former Labour Minister and veteran
journalist as head of the Horserace Totalisator Board, the post he has
held for 19 years, brought an immediate Opposition claim of ''jobs for
the old boys''. The post has been reported as earning Lord Wyatt more
than #90,000 a year.
Lord Wyatt, now a columnist on The Times, was -- as Woodrow Wyatt -- a
Labour Minister in 1951 and a party MP until his defeat in 1970.
However, he now sits on the crossbenches in the Lords.
Last night, Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw protested in a statement
at Westminster: ''Lord Wyatt's appointment is a favour too far, an
unacceptable reward for services rendered to the Tory Party, yet another
case of jobs for the old boys.''

TORY Euro-rebels, at a meeting at Westminster last night, said they
wanted the Prime Minister to promise a referendum on Britain's future in
Europe as the price for their support in tonight's crucial vote on
European policy.
Mr Major has said he is prepared to consider a referendum, but so far
has refused to promise one.
Meanwhile, the pro-EU Tory Reform Group urged Mr Major not to go any
further in appeasing the Euro-sceptics in his Commons speech. After a
meeting of its executive committee, the group issued statement
expressing concern that he was ''pandering to the highly vocal minority
of self publicists and right-wing extremists within the Tory Party.''
The vote still is uncertain as the Ulster Unionists are considering
voting with Labour. The nine Tory rebels are split -- two supporting Mr
Major and the others abstaining.
This could reduce the majority either way to about three, despite a
hard-line amendment tabled by the Government yesterday castigating
Labour's European policy which would lead, it states, to loss of jobs
and the abandonment of Britain's veto in European Councils.
Mr James Molyneaux's nine Ulster Unionists, who may determine whether
a confidence motion tomorrow will be forced on the Government, are
indicating that they intend to all vote the same way. There are signs
that they will not merely abstain. If they vote with Labour, Mr Major
could be in trouble.
However, their plan seems to be to act in a way that will signal to
the Prime Minister that if he makes trouble for them on Ireland they
will make trouble for him in the future.
The two Tory rebels who will support the Government against Mr Blair's
motion -- which claims that Government European policy is against the
national interest -- are Mr Nicholas Budgen and Mr Richard Shepherd,
because they dislike Labour's policy on Europe even more than Mr
Major's.
Government whips claim to be increasingly confident they will win the
vote though they will not hazard a guess by how much.
They will have derived some comfort from the words of one of the
Euro-rebels Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East): ''We don't like causing
trouble.''
Another of the rebels, Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow) said he believed
the Government would win, as did former party chairman Sir Norman
Fowler.
Yesterday, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, in a speech in Berlin, did
his best to bring the rebels round.
He told the German Society for Foreign Affairs that Britain's EU
partners must not press for further centralisation of power in Brussels.
The Inter-Governmental conference next year, he said, ''will not be
one of the defining events of the 1990s''. The lessons of Maastricht had
to be learned. EU institutions had a role in enforcing the disciplines
of a single market and competition rules -- but other areas must remain
beyond their control.
''They are not right for the common foreign and security policy, or
for justice and home affairs. These are areas where Governments act
together,'' he insisted.
Tonight, the Prime Minister intends to set out precisely his attitudes
towards a single currency, immigration controls, and his resistance to
further political union. Much will depend on his self-confidence and
delivery and whether he can master Mr Blair in this key debate.

SCOTTISH Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton made clear
yesterday that the Government is keeping an open mind on possible
changes to child care law in Scotland following the Ayrshire inquiry
into allegations of satanic and ritual child abuse.
The Minister told a Commons committee yesterday that he had called for
a full report on the court ruling, which saw the first of eight children
taken from their parents more than four years ago returned home on
Monday on the order of three judges.
Lord James said the Government would be studying the judgment ''to see
what lessons can be drawn.''
The eventual outcome could be influenced by the recommendations of a
working party appointed by the Secretary of State and the Lord Advocate
following the Orkney child abuse inquiry. This will soon be proposing
new guidance in joint investigation and interviewing by police and
social workers in cases of child abuse and suspected abuse.
Yesterday's committee session of the Children (Scotland) Bill was
dominated by exchanges on the Ayrshire case and on the case in which a
man murdered his estranged wife in a stabbing attack after being led to
her address by information revealed to him by the Children's Panel
Office.
The Bill introduces a number of changes to child care law, many of
which stem from the Orkney inquiry and the inquiry into child care
policies in Fife. It already proposes a wider range of orders and more
exacting criteria to be met before children can be taken into care in
emergency situations, but some MPs now believe it may not go far enough.
The Bill clearly would be an ideal vehicle for introducing any further
measures deemed necessary after the Ayrshire case.
Crucial to the concerns of MPs yesterday was the timescale involved in
the Ayrshire case -- which took almost five years to resolve -- the
procedures for training of social workers and the legal structure under
which evidence is taken from children.
The leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Orkney and Shetland MP
Jim Wallace, has tabled a new clause to the Bill which essentially
states that the over-arching principle should be that the interests of
the child come first.
The Government believes this principle is contained in many of the
Bill's provisions, but it is prepared to look at putting the matter on
the face of the legislation and accepts that the Ayrshire case means
there could be room for further improvement.
Mr Wallace said yesterday: ''We will not be able to pass perfect
legislation but the duty is on us to get it as right as we possibly
can.''
Labour Front Bencher Mrs Maria Fyfe (Glasgow Maryhill) said: the
Ayrshire case showed how important it was to put the interests of the
child first.
On the other case, Mrs Fyfe was concerned about the law governing
contact between estranged couples, and she argued that there should be
safeguards to ensure that contact, if it took place at all, should take
place on ''neutral territory.''
Mr Phil Gallie, Tory MP for Ayr, said the Ayrshire case had raised new
questions about the involvement of lawyers in the children's hearings
system, and he urged the Government to have regard to the case during
future discussions in the committee.

THREE Government Ministers are among the growing numbers of Tories
backing a Bill to ban fox-hunting, it was claimed last night.
Labour MP John McFall (Dumbarton), whose Wild Mammals (Protection)
Bill will be debated in the Commons on Friday, said about 30
Conservative MPs already had indicated their support.
At least three Government Ministers were among those who planned to
back the Bill -- Ann Widdecombe (Employment), Steven Norris (Transport)
and Robert Hughes (Office of Public Service and Science).
Mr McFall is confident that the Bill, which also would ban
stag-hunting and hare-coursing, will pass its first Commons hurdle at
the second reading vote on Friday.
The chairman of the British Field Sports Society, Tory MP Dr Charles
Goodson-Wickes, yesterday said that the society agreed with one of the
objectives of the Bill, to outlaw the ''kicking, beating or torturing''
of a wild mammal. However, he said that any moves to outlaw country
sports were unacceptable.
He suggested that if Mr McFall would agree during the Bill's
subsequent committee stage to drop anti-country sports clauses, then an
agreed Bill could go forward based on the outlawing of kicking, beating
or torturing wild mammals.
In a letter of reply to Dr Goodson-Wickes last night, Mr McFall said:
''Whilst you appear to be acting as Whip for MPs who support the British
Field Sports Society, you will realise that you have no control over the
voting intentions of other MPs.
''I am informed that several MPs have indicated their intention of
being in the Chamber and voting against my Bill. In addition, there are
obstructive procedural tactics which could be deployed to kill the Bill.
''Given this situation, I will be taking no risks and I am, therefore,
urging every Member to attend the House on Friday for this crucial
vote.''

A SCOTTISH police chief is being sued for #55,000 for alleged wrongful
arrest.
The action, raised against Fife Chief Constable William Moodie by Mrs
Dianne Woodward, 25, of Burntisland, claims he is responsible in law for
the acts and omissions of the officers of Fife Constabulary.
Also, it alleges libel in that ''false and calumnious'' allegations
against Mrs Woodward were deliberately published by officers of the
force to the procurator fiscal at Kirkcaldy and Kirkcaldy District
Council.
The action seeks interest at the rate of 8% a year from the time of
the arrest, in February 1992, until payment is made.
Mrs Woodward was arrested and taken to Kirkcaldy police station, where
she was charged with embezzlement, one year after #91.76 allegedly went
missing from the Kirkcaldy District Council office where she worked as a
teller. She was sacked by the authority.
She was found not guilty at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court, then won her case
for unfair dismissal at an industrial tribunal. Nevertheless, the
council refused to compensate Mrs Woodward.
The council finally paid #12,003 compensation only after an employment
appeals tribunal, headed by a High Court judge, rejected their appeal
and upheld the findings of the industrial tribunal. However, they
refused to apologise to Mrs Woodward.
Mrs Woodward's mother-in-law, Mrs Isobel Woodward, saidthey were
considering raising a civil action for damages against Kirkcaldy
District Council.

THE Princess of Wales yesterday met a child who became the 100th heart
transplant patient at the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.
Eighteen-month-old Aaron Litchfield was eager to meet the Princess --
who is the London hospital's president -- when she visited his ward.
''The operation was about a month ago and Aaron will soon be well
enough to go home,'' said a hospital spokeswoman.
It was the 100th operation since Great Ormond Street began heart and
heart-lung transplants in 1988. ''The Princess spoke to Aaron and his
mother. Everything was very relaxed,'' added the spokeswoman.
Looking tanned from her Caribbean holiday, the Princess spoke to young
patients and their parents.
She has spent long nights at Great Ormond Street at Prince William's
bedside when, nearly four years ago, he received emergency treatment for
a fractured skull after an accident with a golf club. Prince Harry was a
also patient at the hospital when he underwent a hernia operation as a
baby.
The Princess paid a private visit to four medical and surgical wards
after meeting youngsters in the hospital's new play centre, which was
built with public donations from the Great Ormond Street Wishing Well
Appeal.
Among the youngsters in the play centre was six-year-old Ben Butcher,
of Rainham, Essex. Ben, who has had most of his bowel removed, is
connected to a mobile machine which feeds him intravenously.
''He thought it was the Queen who was coming today. He kept saying he
was going to meet the Queen,'' said Ben's mother, Heidi.
Dedicated royal watchers Mrs Emily Coughlan and Mr David Butler
travelled from Yorkshire to see the Princess.
Mrs Coughlan, 70, of Wakefield, gave her sweets for William and Harry,
while Mr Butler, 24, a camera shop manager from Leeds, handed her a
painting portraying the wet-look hairstyle she wore on a recent trip to
New York.
''She never misses us. She always comes over for a word,'' said Mrs
Coughlan.

SCOTTISH culture demeans the small businessman and needs to be altered
radically if the country wants to survive and thrive in the 21st
century, a leading businessman claimed yesterday.
Mr Bill Fleming, chairman of a new initiative designed to encourage
Scottish business talent, told an audience at a one-day summit in
Gleneagles the image of entrepreneurs as ''Arthur Daley'' types had to
be buried if the country wished to raise more ''wealth creators''.
The event was designed to launch the Entrepreneurial Exchange, a group
aiming to help create more internationally successful Scottish
businesses. Mr Fleming, the founder of the Smiley Tyres and Exhausts
chain, said: ''We are determined that the exchange will play a key role
in establishing a new enterprise culture in Scotland, raising the

<HEADLINE>About-turn means nuclear rods will go by train. Plans for Torness dry store dropped</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Nuclear shocked the power industry yesterday by suddenly
dropping its plans to store spent nuclear fuel in dry stores at its
power plants, and opting instead to continue to transport the waste by
train to Sellafield.
It had spent millions on its dry store proposals, and argued its case
at a lengthy public inquiry. But, just as it was expected that the
Scottish Office would say yes to a dry store at Torness, the company has
concluded a cheaper deal with BNFL at Sellafield to continue sending the
fuel rods there. It will save SN the #45m a year it expected to save by
keeping the waste on site.
Environmental groups are angry at the decision. Friends of the Earth
Scotland described it as alarming, and accused SN of putting economics
before the environment.
Such groups had conceded that on-site storage was at least preferable
to continued transporting of the highly radioactive spent fuel through
densely populated areas to the North-west of England.
SN points out that the flasks used in rail transportation are
extremely safe. BNFL calculates that there have been 16 million miles of
flask transportation without an accident.
Mr Graham Stein, energy campaigner with Friends of the Earth Scotland,
said: ''I am surprised at this turnaround. Scottish Nuclear has spent
the past few years making the environmental case for a dry store. It's
something we had argued was the least bad option, if I can put it that
way.
''It is probably a purely economic decision to turn their back on it
and have the unnecessary risk -- however small that risk may be -- of
continuing with transportation.''
It appears that SN has been involved in a multi-billion pound
stand-off with BNFL in which BNFL has blinked first. SN, which is still
owned by the taxpayer, runs nuclear stations at Torness on the east
coast, and Hunterston on the west. The highly radioactive fuel rods,
once used, are sent to Sellafield for storage in ponds larger than
football pitches, and are subsequently reprocessed, thus producing small
amounts of uranium and potassium which can again be used in nuclear
reactors.
SN told BNFL that if it did not reduce its prices, then it would
consider building dry stores at Torness and Hunterston where it would
keep the rods instead.
BNFL stuck to its guns, and SN went ahead with preparing plans for the
dry stores, even to the extent of arguing its case at a public inquiry.
Still BNFL did nothing. Then last month Environment Minister John Gummer
said the Government had no objection to the principle of dry storage.
That appears to have galvanised BNFL into coming up with a cheaper
deal which matches the #45m a year savings that SN had anticipated. What
helped to force BNFL's hand was that two German customers had recently
cancelled deals, leaving it with spare capacity at its Thorp
reprocessing plant.
The company says there will be no job losses as staff involved in the
dry store work will be reassigned. Nevertheless, it will mean the loss
of a #50m plus dry store project at Torness, which would have provided
work for 200 to 300 construction workers at its peak.
Mr Robin Jeffrey, chief executive, says the company is well on its way
to achieving its goal of generating electricity as cheaply as coal
burning stations by 1998. He added that this strengthened the company's
future prospects for privatisation if that became the Government option.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour trade and industry spokesman, did not quite
see it that way. ''I wish the management of Scottish Nuclear would
realise that their constant begging for privatisation, and the personal
enrichment which goes with it, demeans both themselves and the industry
they represent.''

PUNTERS could win up to #50,000 in a few seconds when National Lottery
scratch cards are launched in the next few weeks.
Cards will cost #1 each and operator Camelot says players will have a
one-in-10 chance of winning a minimum #1 and a one-in-2,400,000 chance
of scooping the top prize.
That compares to a 54-1 chance of winning a prize in the on-line
lottery game and a one-in-14,900,000 chance of the jackpot.
Camelot estimates that punters will eventually spend nearly #1000m a
year on Instants.
The scratch cards -- the second phase of the National Lottery -- will
go on sale later this monthor early in April at 20,000 outlets around
Britain.
The launch of Instants was criticised by the Institute of Charity
Fundraising Managers, which said the games would further threaten the
#300m to #400m a year charities receive from private lotteries.
Meanwhile, statistician Barry Blight of the London School of
Economics, who helped launch the BBC's National Lottery programme,
admitted yesterday that punters stood more chance winning the pools.
Picking eight draws on a pools coupon is two and a half times more
likely to make you a millionaire than picking six lottery numbers for
#1, he said.

WOMEN are most concerned about sexual offences while males believe
assault to be the crime of greatest concern, according to a survey
carried out by Tayside police.
The survey also found housebreaking was the crime of greatest overall
concern and its findings are contained in a report published yesterday
by HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland Mr John Boyd.
The report disclosed that although the force achieved a 4.5% fall in
the level of recorded crime during 1993, 83% of respondents to a postal
survey believed that crime was on the increase.
In the north-west of Dundee -- the area where there was greatest
concern -- 96% of people who responded held this belief.
With regard to policing functions prevention of crime and detection of
offenders were at the top of the lost of responses.
''The question of what policing functions could be reduced to enable
resources to be concentrated elsewhere elicited the increasing response
that almost half the respondents felt traffic-related duties should be
reduced,'' said Mr Boyd.
''The force therefore has an educational task on its hands to convince
its customers of the importance of traffic policing in enhancing road
safety and reducing the incidence of injuries caused by road accidents
in the Region.''

THE prospect of industrial action by moderate nursing unions increased
yesterday amid claims that the NHS in Scotland is holding to a tougher
line than the rest of the UK.
The Royal College of Nursing, Scottish Health Visitors Association,
Royal College of Midwives, and the District Nurses Association have
formed a united front against the Government's 1% pay offer.
Ms June Andrews, RCN Scottish secretary, said: ''This is the first
time in many years these organisations have come together. We are
considering a number of options, including demonstrations outside
hospitals and withdrawing the unpaid overtime thousands of nurses do
every week.
''This offer is the biggest insult nurses have ever had. I have never
seen them so angry.''
The alliance of moderate nursing organisations will also mount joint
campaigns with other TUC-affiliated trade unions in the NHS.
The Government has insisted that increases to top the basic up to 3%
would have to be negotiated locally.
''There has been an awful lot of talk in England about there being
enough money in the kitty to pay the 3%. Mrs Virginia Bottomley has said
that nurses in England and Wales will get it,'' Ms Andrews said.
''In Scotland, nobody has said we could get 3% by negotiation. We get
the feeling that managers in Scotland have been taking a harder line. We
may have to hit them harder, and I do not think they are prepared for
the battle they are going to get.''
Ms Andrews said there was public concern that nurses were having to
haggle for their increase while doctors were awarded the full 3%, and at
the prospect of wage differentials in rural and urban areas.
The RCN has already decided to reconsider its no-strike policy.
''It would be very sad if it came to strike action or working to
rule,'' Ms Andrews said, ''but the intensity and level of demands to
review strike action has never been so great.''
A ballot of members by the Royal College of Midwives later this week
is expected to result in it abandoning its policy of no industrial
action.
The college's Scottish director, Mrs Patricia Purton, said: ''The
message we are getting quite clearly from all over Scotland is that
midwives wish the option of industrial action to be on the table.''

A PENSIONER who was attacked and robbed on her way to a church meeting
on Sunday evening has died in hospital.
Strathclyde Police are still treating the death of 75-year-old Mrs
Margaret Aitkenhead of Chapman Street, Govanhill, Glasgow, as
suspicious. The results of a post-mortem examination are expected today.
She had been on her way to a Gospel Service in the Victoria Hall
Christian Centre in Langside Road when she was attacked by a youth who
stole her handbag.
Mrs Aitkenhead was taken to the city's Victoria Infirmary but later
transferred to the Southern General Hospital where she was treated for
head injuries. She died yesterday.
Church members are understood to have found Mrs Aitkenhead lying
bleeding on the pavement outside the church hall, about 300 yards from
her second-floor tenement flat.
Police said her daughter, who lives in Bearsden, was too distressed to
talk yesterday.
Neighbours of Mrs Aitkenhead, who was a widow and lived alone, were
shocked to learn of her death yesterday.
Mrs Sadie Charlton, 50, who lives on the ground floor of the same
block said: ''I can't believe it. I spoke to her outside the launderette
in Allison Street on Saturday.''
Mrs Aitkenhead's attacker is described as aged 16-18, about 5ft 9in,
with black hair. He was wearing a ski jacket and denims.

A JOINT crackdown on armed raids on sub-post offices has resulted in a
detection rate of more than 50% in the past year, it was claimed
yesterday.
The exercise, co-ordinated by Strathclyde Police and Post Office
Counters investigations staff, involves targeting known criminals.
Detective Superintendent Gordon Ferrie, in charge of CID Operations
with Strathclyde Police, said it had been mounted in response to an
increase in armed attacks on sub-post offices in the region.
There were 81 attacks on post office employees in Scotland in the past
year -- 16 more than in 1993. Raiders are understood to have netted
about #250,000.
Mr Ferrie said: ''We are very much on top of it now. Some of the
people who have been arrested are major criminals.''
He said sub-postmasters and postmistresses would be invited to a
seminar in Glasgow in August to continue their education ''in the fight
against crime''. Mr Ferrie made his comments at a ceremony in Glasgow
where eight people received bravery awards from Mr Kenneth Graham,
Scottish Post Office board chairman.
Miss Jessie Graham, 58, of Cambusnethan Post Office, Wishaw, who
refused to let a robber behind her counter, even though his accomplice
was pointing a sawn-off shotgun at her, was among those honoured
yesterday.
Miss Graham, whose family has been associated with the Lanarkshire
post office for 90 years, ran behind the counter, shut the connecting
door, and set off the alarm after seeing a masked man with a shotgun
jump from a parked car.
She said: ''I went down on my knees. The next thing I heard was the
smash of a sledgehammer on the glass door. I was angry, not terrified.
When he shouted at me to give him the bags, I threw a fistful of #10
notes at him and said: 'Take that'.''
One raider grabbed a bag of coins before the men escaped with #1000.
No arrests have been made in connection with the incident which happened
in May last year.
Mr John Armstrong, 45, a Rutherglen sub-postmaster, received his
second bravery award in three years. He set off the alarm despite being
confronted by a gunman last March. The man fled from the post office
empty handed. Mr Armstrong also received a bravery award in 1992 after
another attempted robbery.

TEACHERS should have the right to give out homework and to decide not
to set it if they believe it is likely to harm learning, the Educational
Institute of Scotland says today.
Setting out its policy on homework, the union says teachers are coming
under increasing pressure to develop and maintain homework programmes
which have questionable educational value.
Competition arising from publication of comparative tables of
examination results may encourage schools to demand more homework to
raise attainment, ''regardless of the cost to the pupil or student''.
The union recognises that, for a number of parents, homework is a
pointer towards a good school, but argues that it is as false an
indicator of quality learning as school uniform and having prefects.
Pressures from an overcrowded curriculum were also causing teachers to
''export'' aspects of pupils' course work from the school day to the
home.
Schools should recognise that young people have lives which extend
beyond school learning and some have other interests they wish to
follow, the EIS says.
In what will be seen as at best a lukewarm response to the homework
issue, the union says it will support members who feel unfairly
pressured to undertake homework programmes.

THE jury in the Bonnyrigg murder trial failed to reach a verdict

Lord Osborne sent the 11 women and four men to a hotel.
He said he did not wish the jury to feel under any pressure and added:
''You ought in the interests of justice to have as much time as you feel
is necessary to reach a proper decision in this case.''
The judge apologised for the jury's deliberations being disturbed
during the afternoon, when the High Court in Edinburgh had to be
evacuated because of a faulty fire alarm in the boiler room.
The jury retired to consider a verdict at 12.05pm, but as 6pm
approached it became clear that a decision was still not imminent.
Mr Robert Smith, 33, Mr Gerald McQuade, 40, and Mr Paul Bootland, 25,
all deny murdering a 63-year-old retired mining engineer, Mr David Dunn,
in Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, on October 19 last year.
All three deny attempting to murder Detective Constable John Duffy,
42, and two civilians, Mr John Girdler and Mr Duncan Milliken, in
Bonnyrigg on the same day.
They are also charged with robbing the Bank of Scotland in High
Street, Bonnyrigg, of #185,000.

A SENIOR microbiologist at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, last night
described the outbreak of bacterial infections in which a baby girl
died, two babies are seriously ill, and another in a stable condition as
''an amazing coincidence''.
Consultant David Parrott said he believed tests being carried out
today would show no evidence to suggest an epidemic at the special care
baby unit at the hospital.
The girl died there on Sunday night from the bacterial lung infection
klebsiella. Two babies are being treated for different strains of the
same infection, while the fourth is thought to be suffering from the
E-coli virus.
New admissions to the baby unit have been stopped but 13 already being
cared for there still remain. A hospital spokesman said staff were doing
their utmost to ensure that everything possible was done to prevent the
spread of any infection.
Dr Parrott said early results of swab tests had shown no spread of the
infections: ''Until investigations are finished, you can never be
absolutely sure but I guess that it's an amazing coincidence.''
He added: ''At any one time, up to 20% of patients in the hospital
will have some kind of infection. We process 160,000 specimens a year
and, from time to time, we find little groups of organisms that are
causing problems in one sector of the hospital. But they are different
organisms and they are there by pure coincidence. This is not unusual.''
On the infections in the baby unit, Dr Parrott said: ''It is very
difficult to find a source. What's alarming about this particular
episode is that it is affecting very susceptible babies. I would not
foresee anything else happening. One cannot be 100% right but I think we
have had a very unfortunate time.''
He said the microbiology department had taken swabs from the baby
unit. They were taken to exclude the possibility of a reservoir of
infection but, given that there were four different organisms involved,
he felt such a reservoir was highly unlikely.
A consultant from outside Tayside will be asked to undertake a review
of the unit and make recommendations. Dr William Tarnow-Mordi, a
neonatal expert at Ninewells, said the situation in the unit would be
reviewed daily.
''The investigation is continuing and we have checked all the
instruments. We will continue to check them for as long as it takes to
be satisfied that they are not the source of the infection.''
The Rev Tom Tait, chairman of Tayside Health Council, said: ''This
appears to be an unfortunate thing that can arise from time to time. I
commend the hospital for the care they have taken and hope they make the
report by the outside consultant available to the health council.''

RUNAWAY schoolboy Peter Kerry, 14, arrived home from Malaysia
yesterday and promised that there would be no more trips until he is
older.
Asked after landing at London's Heathrow Airport following an
overnight flight from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur whether he
was planning more long-range adventures, he shook his head solemnly and
whispered ''No -- when I'm older''.
But he said his ambition was to be an airline pilot and admitted with
a cheeky smile that he had applied to join the Air Miles scheme.
Wearing dusty cotton travelling clothes, he looked tired and downcast
as he stepped off the flight.
He could give neither his parents, John and Pat Kerry, of Harrow,
north-west London, nor waiting journalists any explanation of why he
took his father's credit card and passport to buy a return ticket to
Malaysia.
An ''elated'' Mr and Mrs Kerry said after being reunited with their
son that they were happy to wait until later for explanations.
Mrs Kerry told press photographers: ''I would like your photographs to
go to every port in the country and people to recognise him so that he
can't do this again.''
She said her son would go straight home for a good sleep and later a
big meal.

DRINKS company Tennent Caledonian has withdrawn the latest poster in
its controversial sadism-themed advertising campaign after it was
branded ''degrading, tacky, and exploitative'' by Scottish women's
groups.
The brewers announced its decision after receiving several complaints
from individuals outraged at the poster, which features a pair of female
lips, covered with pink lipstick, pierced by a ring with the tagline
Chastity.
Speaking yesterday, a company spokesperson said it was aware it was
courting controversy with the campaign, designed by the Leith Agency,
from Edinburgh, but had not considered that this image would cause
offence.
Senior brand manager Mr Gordon Brown said yesterday the company was in
the process of ripping down the posters, in place at 130 sites
throughout Scotland, before introducing a new words-only poster at the
weekend, bearing the innocuous legend ''It'll pour later''.
In the interim, the sites will be left either blank or be turned over
to charities for their use.
Mr Brown denied the company had decided to follow the shock tactic
approach epitomised by the clothing company Benetton, which has been
criticised for appropriating serious problems such as AIDS in its
advertising.
Tennent Caledonian also released a prepared statement setting out
their apology. It explained the image by saying: ''It shows a consumer
who has chosen to indulge in the current vogue of body piercing to such
an extent that, with both lips pierced by the ring, they cannot now
drink their favourite brand.''
That did nothing to mollify the anger of Councillor Liz Cameron,
vice-convener of Glasgow City Council's women's committee.
Councillor Cameron, who represents Knightswood, said she had been
shocked by the image and had been contacted by a number of colleagues,
both male and female, who had been similarly distressed.

A FORAY into the challenging world of planning and development has
resulted in a heavy defeat for the Archdiocese of Glasgow.
Faced with a choice between a #6.5m B &amp; Q warehouse development on a
council-owned site at Mount Vernon and a ''speculative'' DIY unit and
garden centre on land owned by the archdiocese at London Road, east of
Dalbeth Cemetery, city councillors on a planning sub-committee opted for
the former by 14 votes to two.
Central to their consideration was the fact that B &amp; Q had undertaken
to spend around #4m decontaminating the site which forms part of the
former Kenmuir refuse tip.
In addition, the council would receive a capital receipt of #1m as a
result of the deal.
However, the archdiocese was not entirely without support. One of the
two councillors who voted for its Dalbeth proposal, Mr Robert Gray,
objected to an official of the city estates department coming down in
favour of the Kenmuir site. He felt it was wrong that the estates
department, as one of the objectors, should be ''making a presentation''
in favour of one site when consideration ought to be restricted to
planning issues.
Councillor Gray made it clear he was ''not an ally of the
archdiocese'' as had been suggested in a radio broadcast earlier that
day. He had intended to approach the decision ''even-handedly''.
Later, Councillor Gray denied reports that he and a senior planning
official had met Cardinal Winning on the matter. He confirmed he had
been involved in a working group dealing with development proposals for
the precincts of St Andrew's Cathedral, Clyde Street.
''I wish people would get their facts right,'' said Councillor Gray.
The decision to approve the Kenmuir proposal was welcomed by local
councillor, Mr Colin McNicol. He said: ''The applicant is willing to
spend #4m clearing the site of toxic waste and consolidating works in
preparation for the development. This will be of considerable benefit to
my area and the council as a whole.

A LAWYER for a family in the Ayrshire sex abuse case last night
dismissed reports that three of the children do not want to go home as
''premature and mischievous''.
Mr Gerry Brown said it was far too early to suggest that any of the
seven children still in care will not be reunited with parents, as
ordered by three judges on Monday.
The judges had upheld Sheriff Colin Miller's finding that their
removal into care in June, 1990 was not justified. Mr Brown said last
night: ''Some of the children have been institutionalised, and two
cannot even remember their parents. But curators have been appointed to
help them in the reunion process.''

A TRANSPORT strategy costing #25m for Glasgow city centre was unveiled
yesterday by Strathclyde Regional Council.
Under the Millennium Plan, the intention is to transform the area into
a European model with tram systems, cycle paths, pedestrian priorities,
and wider walkways. Cars and buses would be banned from some areas,
including Argyle Street.
The plan is designed to cut traffic by 30%, while still maintaining
access for essential vehicles.
More than 60,000consultation questionnaires will be distributed to the
public, who will also be encouraged to comment through a poster and
roadshow campaign which begins today.
It is proposed that pedestrians have priority on Argyle Street during
the day with buses permanently re-routed along Howard Street. In the
evening the street would be opened for commuter traffic.
The opposite would take place near the Theatre Royal on Hope Street,
which would be closed to traffic in the evenings to create a bustling
continental cafe scene.
Work begins this month at Candleriggs on a #500,000 scheme to widen
footways and narrow the road, using attractive sustainable material
which will brighten the look of the area.
Other proposals include closing George Street at Nelson Mandela Place
with the area becoming a pedestrian walkway. The only road construction
would be a stretch of perimeter road between Garscube Road and Pinkston
Road.
The plans have been prepared in partnership with Glasgow Development
Agency and Glasgow District Council. The consultation period will last
six weeks, after which the gathered data will be analysed.
Meanwhile the plans for a rapid transport system as an alternative to
car travel through the traffic-choked west side of Edinburgh have been
given the thumbs-up in an extensive public consultation exercise.
A study on the impact of the system on the environment has still to be
completed and negotiations are under way with landowners whose land
might be required.

A TOP-LEVEL inquiry is to probe allegations of a ''dirty-tricks''
campaign to force former SNP candidate Roseanna Cunningham out of
contention for a by-election.
The SNP leadership is braced for a backlash at this week's party
council meeting in Stirling over its handling of the affair. Ms
Cunningham is said to be ''bewildered'' by her treatment.
Although there will be no going-back on her announcement withdrawing
from the fray in Perth and Kinross, Ms Cunningham, an advocate who came
within 2000 votes of wresting the seat from the late Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn at the last election, is known to be shattered by what has
happened.
The inquiry will focus on the leak from the supposedly secret
selection meeting on Sunday, but care will be taken to ensure nothing is
publicised until after the by-election.
Ms Cunningham is said to be unable to understand how a blameless
interlude from her private life from almost two decades ago had robbed
her of a likely nomination for a by-election the SNP are favourites to
win.
The controversy flared at the weekend when a selection conference
asked of Ms Cunningham and the other five candidates for the seat a
standard question about whether there was anything in their private
lives which could emerge as an embarrassment during the hustings.
Ms Cunningham was then apparently confronted with the accusation that
she had been responsible for the break-up of the marriage of the
daughter-in-law of party president Mrs Winnie Ewing -- SNP parliamentary
leader Margaret Ewing -- to her first husband, Mr Donald Bain. Mrs
Winnie Ewing has denied she raised the matter.
Close friends of Ms Cunningham indicated yesterday that the question
shocked her because the relationship between her and Mr Bain, between
Easter and the autumn of 1977 after he had already separated from his
wife, has been widely known in party circles for many years.
At the time of the break-up of the Bains' marriage, the then Mrs Bain,
SNP MP for East Dunbartonshire, spoke at a news conference in Stirling
on January 23, 1977, to make clear the relationship was over and she was
moving out of the marital home in Dunblane.
It was also stated at that time that Mr Bain would be resigning his
job as an SNP researcher, but in the months between leaving and finding
a new position in Italy, where he still lives, he and Ms Cunningham
became friends. His wife subsequently married Mr Fergus Ewing, son of
the MEP for the Highlands and Islands.
Mrs Margaret Ewing yesterday reiterated the fact that she did not
share her mother-in-law's view of past events and repeated her support
for Ms Cunningham. ''There is no difficulty between us,'' she said.
However, the party leadership was yesterday aware that many party
members and supporters will be disgusted that a leading political talent
was forced to withdraw from the selection process in these
circumstances. In the short-term, we can expect a high-profile event of
some kind at which party leader Alex Salmond is seen
shoulder-to-shoulder with Ms Cunningham as a visual expression of
support.
In the immediate future, leaders are braced for a backlash on Saturday
when the national council of the party gathers in Stirling in advance of
the national executive's meeting to ratify the by-election short-list.
This will go through, however, leaving a likely list of three -- SNP
national secretary Alasdair Morgan; Perth and Kinross council leader
Bruce Crawford; and party transport spokesman Keith Brown.
The question being asked in SNP circles was this: If those present at
Sunday's selection committee were so shocked at the raising of Ms
Cunningham's past life and so convinced that an injustice was being done
on her, why did they still vote her down? Mrs Winnie Ewing had left by
the time the vote was taken, but the remaining seven found against Ms
Cunningham.
Even their 4-3 decision was not binding, as the NEC ultimately makes
up its own mind, but crucially the leadership did not refuse to accept
Ms Cunningham's withdrawal from the fray, and that decision is now
regarded -- not least by the former candidate herself -- as
irreversible.
*The SNP wants to see Scottish Homes abolished, Mr Salmond told a
housing conference in Aviemore yesterday.
He accused the housing quango of acting as a wing of the Tory Party
and said the Nationalists would replace it with a Housing Ministry and a
new national housing agency.

<TEXT>
MORE than 1000 local authority and health service workers in Tayside
have formed a breakaway union in protest at the sacking of their
regional organiser by the GMB.
Mr Billy Gifford was suspended from the GMB earlier this year, and was
later dismissed over allegations concerning the unauthorised issuing of
a #250 cheque.
The union's central appeals committee in London rejected Mr Gifford's
appeal last week, and the former regional organiser now intends to take
his case to an industrial tribunal.
Yesterday former members of the GMB in Tayside revealed that they had
set up their own union, the National Union of General and Public Service
Workers.
Mr Jim Cunningham, former Tayside GMB branch secretary, said: ''We
will be seeking recognition from the various local authorities. Initial
approaches have met with a favourable response.
''The ex-members are still dissatisfied with the GMB and as a
consequence have now set up this new union.''
He claimed that interest had been shown in the new union from as far
afield as the Western Isles, Glasgow, Grampian, Fife, Stirling, and
Falkirk.
Mr Cunningham added that there were currently 1500 withdrawal forms
being processed from GMB members, around a fifth of the membership in
Tayside. He was confident of doubling that number.
''Clearly I would expect opposition from the GMB and from within the
STUC and the TUC.''
Representatives of the new union say it is open to membership from
across the country. They are seeking premises in Dundee.
Mr Gifford said: ''I'm overwhelmed at the response we've had from the
membership and the amount of inquiries we've received. I will now take
my case to an industrial tribunal where I am confident of a fair
hearing.
''I have also contacted the police in regard to the allegations
against me, and I will be pursuing that aspect through my solicitor.''
Mr Bob Thomson, GMB Scottish regional secretary, said that feedback he
had received from Dundee indicated there was little support for the new
union. ''I don't think we will have a long-term problem and the few
members that have left will return to the GMB.''
He said that the case of Mr Gifford was ''a personal issue and not a
political issue'' and added: ''The matter was dealt with properly and
through procedures. We derive no satisfaction from Mr Gifford's
dismissal. It was however necessary.
''No organisation can permit dishonesty and gross misconduct to go on
unchallenged.''

BRITISH Gas chief executive Cedric Brown is to be recalled before a
Commons committee investigating top people's pay, it was announced last
night.
Mr Brown will face further questions from the all-party employment
select committee next Tuesday following the release of more details
about his salary.
He faced a difficult session in January when MPs questioned him at
length about his 75% salary increase which took his pay to #475,000.
Labour MPs on the committee are known to be angry that Mr Brown did
not give details of a new long-term bonus scheme, which emerged last
week when British Gas announced its annual profits.
Committee chairman Greville Janner (Lab - Leicester West) said
yesterday that British Gas chairman Richard Giordano had written to the
committee giving details of the bonus scheme, which could be worth up to
125% of basic pay.
''As Mr Brown did not see fit to give us this information, the
committee has decided to recall him to give further evidence.''
Mr Giordano is also giving evidence to the committee next Tuesday.
The committee also will question Mr David Jefferies, chairman of
National Grid, who Labour claims stands to earn up to #2m, it was
announced yesterday.
British Gas maintained last night that Mr Brown had not misled the
select committee when he appeared before MPs in January.
''Our written evidence to the committee made clear that the annual
bonus plan for executive directors was relinquished halfway through
1994,'' said a British Gas spokeswoman.

CIVIL Service spending on outside management consultants has soared to
more than #865m, according to figures released yesterday.
The Liberal Democrats unveiled a ''catalogue of excess and
incompetence'' showing that far from cutting consultancy contracts -- as
recommended by a Government watchdog -- departments have piled on costs.
In a damning report last year, the Efficiency Unit, set up by the
Prime Minister to monitor spending, found little evidence that
consultants were achieving worthwhile savings.
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce said estimates
culled from Government statistics showed that fees paid to outside
consultants rose by #128m in a year, from #737m in 1992-93 to #865.5m in
1993-94.
Spending on consultancy at the Scottish Office was thought to have
increased by 1600% during the same period, and by 1900% at the Northern
Ireland Office -- a combined increase in real terms from #1.9m to #35m.

<RECORDNO>979616033</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE pay of the heads of privatised utilities has risen five times as
fast as that of their employees and bears little relation to company
performance, an independent report showed yesterday.
Salaries and bonuses of top directors in the electricity, gas,
telecommunications, and water and sewage utilities had risen by about
15% a year since 1989, said the study by Martin Conyon, of Warwick
Business School at the University of Warwick.
Labour immediately seized on the figures as further evidence of
boardroom greed.
The study also found that there was no hard evidence of a robust link
between the remuneration of the highest paid director and traditional
measures of company performance, including earnings per share and
long-term return on capital.
''This is a matter of concern for shareholders and regulators alike
since the lack of a correlation between pay and performance potentially
generates weak incentives for top managers to pursue shareholder
interests,'' said Mr Conyon.
He added that his findings implicitly questioned whether the interests
of shareholders were being looked after properly by renumeration
committees, the forum where boardroom pay was set in leading UK
companies.
The figures excluded other components of top pay, such as gains from
share options, so should be regarded as a minimum benchmark figure, said
Mr Conyon in a paper soon to be published in the British Journal of
Industrial Relations.
At the same time, average employee pay had increased by just 3%.
Labour's Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said: ''This report confirms
that the excessive handouts both in pay and executive share options bear
no relation to company performance.
''The public will be appalled that as prices rise in the utilities,
top pay rises even faster.''
Using information supplied by Datastream, the financial information
company, Mr Conyon examined pay in British Telecom, British Gas, the 10
water and sewage companies, 12 electricity companies, National Power,
Powergen, Hydro-Electric, and ScottishPower since they were privatised.
In 1990, the average highest paid directors' salary was #145,000; by
1994 it had risen to #256,000, an increase of 15.45% a year in real,
inflation-adjusted, terms.
By contrast, average employee pay rose from #16,910 in 1990 to #19,522
in 1994, an increase of 2.96% a year in real terms.
Relating pay to company performance, Mr Conyon said that, although
there was considerable variation across utilities, the important feature
was that growth in top directors' pay generally exceeded company
performance.
Whether measured by stock market performance or profitability, there
was no statistical correlation between the two, he said, adding that the
size of a company appeared to be a more important determinant of pay.
''One potential implication of such an observation is that directors
have an incentive to increase company size (since this translates into
personal economic rewards) which may not be in the long-term interests
of shareholders.''
Cash was only one way in which overall compensation packages for
directors had been boosted since privatisation.
Bosses had also made significant gains through dealings in share
options, although the information in company reports was insufficient to
examine their value properly.
''This suggests a need for more complete company accounts disclosure
of boardroom pay, along with the mechanisms by which it is set,'' said
Mr Conyon.
Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering
and Electrical Union, said the continuing revelations over executive pay
rises were threatening industrial relations in the utilities.

ONE of the biggest legal actions ever to be raised before a sheriff
may now be settled out of court.
Glasgow businessman Mr Jimmy Wilson is suing the Scottish Secretary
for #12.9m following the disappearance of 132,000 tons of material from
Scotland's only stockpile of sandstone.
Mr Wilson, of the Glasgow Sandstone Company, claimed the masonry was
used to stabilise a section of the M74, between Maryville and Fullerton,
which was built on his land.
He also claimed that the material -- part of a huge stockpile from
demolished Glasgow tenements -- was taken away without his knowledge or
permission.
The entire stockpile, which is buried in a quarry on land owned by Mr
Wilson at Carmyle, Glasgow, is believed to be worth #97.3m and contains
enough sandstone to build 30,000 two/three bedroom tenement flats.
Yesterday, Mr Malcolm Spiers of the Glasgow legal firm Mellicks, who
raised the action on behalf of Mr Wilson, confirmed that the scene was
now set for an out of court settlement.
He said: ''The defenders are lodging a motion to ask for the action to
be sisted -- suspended -- so that negotiations can take place.''
A Scottish Office spokesman confirmed that the motion to sist the
action would be lodged at Glasgow Sheriff Court today.
During his fight for compensation from the Scottish Office Mr Wilson
threatened to erect a toll gate across the M74 and to charge police cars
a half guinea every time they used it.
Said Mr Wilson: ''It's just a matter now of both sides getting
together to agree on a figure to settle the case.
''I am delighted because the money will be used to finance a series of
major developments which will create 100 new jobs.
''We are gearing ourselves up to be involved in projects worth #120m
to build heritage villages, complete with tenements and cobbled streets,
in Glasgow.
''This has propelled sandstone into the forefront as the required
material for this and other projects.''
The Glasgow Sandstone Company has also been negotiating with the
Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland with a view to
supplying natural weathered sandstone for use in Belfast and
Londonderry.

THE VSEL shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness is to cut nearly 600 jobs
because of reductions in defence requirements, it was announced
yesterday.
The shipyard, which is currently the subject of a takeover battle
between GEC and British Aerospace, plans to shed 589 jobs from its
workforce of 5800 over the next five months. It employed 14,000 until
just a few years ago.
The company, which is working on two submarines for the Trident fleet
based at Faslane on the Clyde, said it would try to attract volunteers
but could not rule out compulsory redundancies.
Personnel director Ray Davies said the announcement was ''widely
anticipated'' as part of a planned reduction in employment levels. ''But
that does not make it any less distressing for those involved and
individuals will be dealt with in as sensitive a manner as possible,''
he added.
VSEL was actively seeking work and would tender for a new submarine
contract this summer as well as for assault ships and Type 23 frigates.
In the short term, the company was faced with a declining workload.
''It is the necessity to respond to this situation in order to keep
our costs down when competing for new work which has made today's
announcement necessary.''
VSEL, which is also building a helicopter carrier for the Royal Navy,
has been cutting jobs at regular intervals since 1990. The two Trident
submarines will be completed by 2000.
Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering
and Electrical union, called on the Government to take emergency action
to try to save jobs.
''The Government cannot keep washing its hands of defence workers who
have served this country so well. For the past five years, we have been
calling for a sensible policy of defence diversification to channel
skills from defence to manufacturing.''
Both GEC and British Aerospace are bidding to take over VSEL and the
rival bids have been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Earlier this week, the Scottish National Party urged that the
Government's existing ''golden share'' in VSEL be strengthened in any
subsequent enterprise.
The party warned that thousands of jobs in Scotland could be affected
by the take-over battle. GEC owns the Yarrow shipyard and British
Aerospace owns the Jetstream aircraft factory at Prestwick.

THE KIRK stood accused last night of preparing to ''contract out'' the
services of ministers in a financially-driven bid to reduce costs.
It is to consider a plan that threatens an end to full-time mission
work and pastoral care in universities or places of work -- unless the
chaplains' full costs are covered by the institutions and industry.
Prisons and hospitals would see a drop in the number of part-time
chaplains if they also failed to provide more money for their services.
The Rev Ken Pattison, convener of the Church of Scotland's
chaplaincies' committee, said last night that any withdrawals would be
''a matter of the deepest regret''.
He added that chaplains had an important role to play in the fabric of
society, but the Kirk wanted to make savings because of falling income.
A strategy document prepared by the Kirk's board of national mission
for submission to the General Assembly in May seen by The Herald
declares that ''in general terms chaplaincy provision should be
commensurate with the ability of an institution or organisation to pay
for this service''.
It is a strategy being interpreted in some church circles as a bid to
''contract out'' ministers while reducing outlays.
In a letter to the board, the Rev John Matthews, of Ruchill, has
argued that he recognises some aspects of the church are financial but
that others are subsidised by faith and need not increase costs.
He wants the church to worship in community halls and schools instead
of concentrating on supporting costly Victorian buildings.
The Rev Ian Black, convener of the Board of National Mission, last
night denied that ministers would be contracted out. He stressed that
the Kirk already received funding from external agencies for chaplains.
Both the Scottish Prison Service and the oil industry meet the costs
of one full-time chaplain, as do various NHS hospital trusts, and the
SPS also makes payments to part-time chaplains.
But universities currently meet only 50% of costs, estimated at
#25,000-a-head. The board's document suggests they should assume the
full costs of the posts when present contracts expire.
Mr Pattison warned it was likely that university chaplaincies would
not be filled by the Kirk unless the institutions agreed to pay the
bills. He said a similar situation was likely to arise in industry, and
added: ''I hope universities see the value of chaplains. Universities
are places for the quest of knowledge and understanding at the deepest
level. But the spiritual level must not be ignored.
''I also regret any losses in industry. The church ought to be making
important statements about the fabric of our society, and work is a
central part of that.''
Mr Black estimated that the church could save about #250,000-a-year by
reducing numbers of part-time industrial and hospital chaplains.
His board's document also suggests that hospital trusts should move
towards whole-time chaplains as far as possible. At present, there are
300 part-time and 22 full-time hospital chaplains.
In the past, the Kirk has made their appointments but it appears to
have moved towards a position of accepting happily that outside bodies
will pay -- and therefore have the right to call the tune.
Although the Kirk would still have a pension responsibility for
chaplains, they would have to find their own housing and would be paid
by the hospital at which they worked.
The plan to boost outside funding is part a package to stave off cuts
and lack of cash in the Kirk.
The board, faced with cuts, wants to encourage what it calls
''positive partnerships'' with industry, universities, prisons, and
hospitals -- in order to safeguard chaplaincy work it can no longer
afford to support.
Mr Black was unwilling to extend the principle of ''positive
partnerships'' to funerals. At present, parish ministers must perform
all funerals free upon request despite the time involved.
Mr Black said: ''We're hoping it will be seen as a creative reponse to
the present situation, but it is also a realistic response to our
financial situation . . .
''We didn't start with the idea of money. But we're not living in a
cocoon siphoned off from Mammon.''

<HEADLINE>Bank's fall hits Thalidomide victims</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
VICTIMS of Thalidomide could lose up to #1m compensation with the
collapse of the merchant bank Barings, it was disclosed yesterday.
The director of the Thalidomide Trust Fund confirmed that #600,000 had
been invested in a deposit account.
Mr Neil Buckland said: ''It is not clear at this stage whether the
money has been lost. It may be subject to a legal battle.
''At least 1% of the trust fund was invested in a Baring Brothers'
account. It is clear that other equities and bonds invested in the bank
are safe and belong absolutely to the trust fund.''
Ms Heather Bird, Scottish delegate of the Thalidomide Action Group,
said: ''All the Thalidomide Trust's investments were held by Barings.
It's tragic.''
She said the Thalidomide Trust, set up in 1973 to provide cash for the
victims, had recently warned it would run out of money in 15 years
unless it received a massive cash injection.
Ms Bird, 33, from Wishaw, said: ''That now looks set to happen sooner
rather than later now Barings have crumbled with our investments.''
She said it was more vital than ever for Guinness -- current owners of
Distillers who marketed the Thalidomide drug in 1960 -- to top up the
trust fund coffers.
The chairman of TAG, Mr Freddie Astbury, from Liverpool, said: ''We
can't afford to lose any money.
''The trust fund is already dwindling and may run out before many
victims have reached old age. But if we lose out on more money, it will
spell financial disaster.
''In real terms, we stand to lose up to #1m. To recoup the #600,000,
we will have to sell assets in a declining market.''
Mr Murray Loake, head of media relations at Guinness, said there was
no plan by the company to compensate the trust for any losses.
Mr Loake said: ''This is not a matter for Guinness plc.''

THE SNP president, Mrs Winnie Ewing, last night denied she had been
the one to raise Ms Rosanna Cunningham's affair with the former husband
of her daughter-in-law, Mrs Margaret Ewing, during the party's selection
of a candidate for the Perth and Kinross seat.
Within 24 hours of Sunday's meeting, the publicity surrounding the
disclosure had led to Ms Cunningham withdrawing her candidacy, despite
the fact that she had reduced the Tory majority in the seat to little
more than 2000 at the last election. She was confident that she could go
one better next time.
Mrs Ewing also insisted she had not been present when the short leet
for the seat of the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn was drawn up at the
SNP's Edinburgh headquarters.
Mrs Ewing, who is MEP for the Highlands and Islands, was at her home
near Elgin yesterday, where she is recovering from a hairline fracture
to her pelvis.
''I cannot say much and that is not changed by the fact that somebody
from the totally confidential meeting has leaked it to the press the
minute the meeting was over. I am bound by the rules of the party, I am
president of the party. I don't leak to the press. I am not going to
start that at this stage in my career.
''There are two things I can tell you. One is that I had no part in
the decision on the short leet, because I was only there in the morning.
We had a four-hour drive down in the morning and I told Gordon Wilson
that I would only be able to sit for the morning because I had a
four-hour drive back in the afternoon.
''The decision was made at the end of the afternoon session. I wasn't
there. I wasn't party to that decision. So if they all have a gripe they
should take it up with the people who voted for the short leet. It
wasn't me.
''Secondly, I wasn't the person that raised this matter. I wouldn't
have raised this matter. Mind you, I think the press were sitting with
knowledge of it. That probably wasn't the reason she was put off the
short leet anyway. And that is all I am prepared to say.
''I am being pilloried by the press for some reason, best known to
themselves.''
Mrs Ewing was asked if she was considering legal action in response to
these press reports. She replied: ''What legal action is there against
the fact we have a disloyal member who goes straight away to the press?
The party will have to deal with it and we think we know who it is.
''That chapter isn't finished. The whole essence of a selection
committee is that it is conducted in confidence and even when the
selection committee reports to the national executive they just report
their findings, not their reasons. They are the only people present at
the confidential question-and-answer session.''
Mrs Ewing said she did not know whether she would be able to attend
Saturday's meeting of the party's national executive which will make the
final selection for Perth and Kinross.
''That is on the Saturday and on the Friday there is the memorial
service for Nicky Fairbairn in Perth. I don't know if I will make them,
it depends on how I feel. I'm supposed to be taking it easy for a couple
of weeks.''

<HEADLINE>Legal threat on pay abuses Major turns on greed in boardroom</HEADLINE>

THE full force of the law will be used, if necessary, to end
directors' pay abuses, an angry Prime Minister announced yesterday.
In a remarkable change of Government policy Mr Major told the Commons
that he found them distasteful and disreputable.
The threat to legislate reverses the Government line that to do so
would smack of socialist-style pay policy in the private sector.
It comes as the Commons committee investigating directors' pay
announced that it would be recalling British Gas chief Cedric Brown who
faced lengthy questioning last month on his 75% pay rise to #475,000.
It is known some committee members have been angered by the subsequent
revelation of a new long-term bonus scheme which could be worth an extra
125% of basic pay. The committee is also to question Mr David Jefferies,
chairman of the National Grid, who Labour claims stands to receive up to
#2m after it is privatised this summer.
Mr Major's plea over many months for self-restraint on pay has failed
and he has now abandoned it in the face of growing public disgust at
boardroom greed. The Prime Minister squashed reluctance to act from his
Chancellor Ken Clarke and his Trade Secretary Michael Heseltine in
''consultations'' yesterday morning before he went to the Commons.
The behaviour of the chiefs of the privatised utilities who have
seized massive pay packages while laying off staff has infuriated the
Prime Minister whose warnings have been flouted. The revelation that
seven National Grid directors are to share #6m in share options was the
final straw.
Mr Major stunned the Commons yesterday with the vehemence of his
response to a goading question from Labour leader Tony Blair saying:
''Yes, I do find these payments as distasteful as you and, I dare say,
many other people do as well. Where they cannot be justified I think
they bring the system into disrepute.''
Recent reports indicate that bosses' pay in the privatised utilities
has risen five times as fast as that of their employees and bears little
relation to company performance.
The Prime Minister said that the inquiry for the CBI headed by Sir
Richard Greenbury of Marks and Spencer, whom he contacted yesterday, is
to make recommendations and he followed this up with the warning that he
is prepared to introduce new laws to curb abuses.
''The Greenbury Committee is considering these matters. When their
recommendations are available, I will be ready to consider any proposals
that may require legislative back-up.''
He itemised the areas in which he wants action:
* Full disclosure to shareholders of the remuneration of directors.
* Bonuses and share options to be firmly based on the performance of
the company, ''and not provided as windfall gains''. This is where the
greatest public concern is concentrated, he said.
''I believe that may require stricter criteria for the price at which
the shares are issued and the circumstances in which they are exercised.
All these matters will need to be examined,'' Mr Major added.
Mr Blair at once demanded that Mr Major act immediately without
waiting for the Greenbury recommendations which may be several months
away. The Government had a ''golden share'' in the National Grid, ''why
don't you use it?'' he asked. Mr Major replied that there were a wide
number of issues to be considered.
Labour's trade and industry spokesman Brian Wilson mocked the Prime
Minister's turn-around. ''Until today he has made a virtue of leaving
the privatised utilities to manage their own troughs and castigated
Labour for wishing to interfere. Now he is hinting at legislation to
control them without actually producing any.
''It has eventually dawned on the Prime Minister that greed in
privatised boardrooms reflects very badly on the Tory party.''
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said: ''For months we have told the
Prime Minister what he should do and he has refused. Now he has been
forced by our campaign to take action. If he is serious he should not
wait but act now and at once introduce legislation to end this abuse.''
The Liberal Democrats were also sceptical. Treasury spokesman Malcolm
Bruce said: ''What is the Prime Minister up to? John Major has moved
from hand-washing to hand-wringing in one short week.''

BEAZER has opened two new showhomes at Knightswood Gate in Garscadden,
a development of 175 homes.
Bailie Craig Roberton, local councillor for the area and convenor on
the sub-committee for private sector housing, said: ''It is new, good
quality housing developments such as this that are much needed in this
area, and it's fortunate that Beazer had the in initiative to pursue the
project.''
Knightswood Gate, at the junction of Alderman Road and Kelso Street,
will include a range of two, three and four-bedroom homes in a variety
of styles. It is the second Beazer development in the Yoker/Garscadden
area and follows the success of Peterson Gardens.
The company has also unveiled plans for a further development, Albion
Court, soon to be established nearby.

PAISLEY poet John Kent once described his home town as ''famed alike
for shawls and thread, for poverty and poets.'' He might also have
pointed out that it is quite well known that you get more house room for
your money in Paisley than in most parts of Glasgow.
No.35 Potterhill Avenue, Paisley, is a case in point. The traditional
detached villa has four public rooms and five bedrooms, plus a
conservatory, Jacqueline Black of Slater Hogg &amp; Howison's Paisley office
is quoting offers over #169,000. ''I worked in the Bearsden office a few
years ago and I reckon a house like this would cost well over #200,000
in that area, perhaps as much as #235,000. the main lounge in the house
is on the half landing and has bay windows on three sides. ''It's a
lovely, lovely room. It's a most unusual location for a living room and
has a very pleasant feel to it,'' says Jacqueline Black.
The house has many interesting features including: fireplaces,
cornices, window seats, wood panelling, tiled flooring, bay windows, and
a carved balustrade. The level gardens have been landscaped and contain
some mature trees.

. Someone has come up with the idea of using the Internet, that great
new computer highway, for finding a place to rent. Pay out about #90 and
details of your house go out, worldwide. Stand back for inquiries from
Tangier to Timbuktoo? Well, maybe tomorrow.
Right now, people like Fineholm in Glasgow, stick to down-to-earth
methods, like having several hundred properties on their books at any
time, with a price range from #180 to #1800 a month.
''We always retain a broad spectrum,'' says senior partner John
Mackenzie. ''Over the past 25 years, business has changed a bit. It used
to be mainly looking after homes of those who had gone abroad. Now, it
can be more of an investment as people realise the potential involved.
''Certainly, demand is there -- very much so, and there is more
awareness of what is available. Interest is high in what we would term
the broad Central Belt: that is what we concentrate on.''
The kind of property Fineholm ''just can't get enough of'' is at The
Stables, in Bell Street, better known as the Merchant City part of town.
Going for around #420 a month, there is bedroom, lounge, kitchen,
bathroom and, as a top floor flat, views both north and south
''I understand RailTrack may have views on purchasing some properties
in the area, but that will have no effect on letting demand for some
years ahead. It's very popular with younger business people,'' John
Mackenzie declares.
So what do you get for, say, #180 a month? Quite a range in fact. It
could be an unfurnished single-bedroom flat, always in demand, at
Killearn or Doune, or Saltcoats, or Bonhill, or Harthill.
Go for an unfurnished flat at The Moorings at Largs, of course, and
you are somewhat more upmarket. Say, #600 a month. It gets you three
bedrooms, large kitchen and bathroom, nicely furnished, and lovely views
out to sea.
Furnished flats? You could start at around #240. Go to Old Shettleston
Road, for example, and it is a single bedroom, lounge, bathroom, fully
furnished kitchen -- everything ready for you to walk in.
Happy to pay a little more? Then #350 -- #450 provides a
single-bedroom flat in Shawlands, and rather bigger and better
furnishings all round. A traditional red sandstone property, in a good
neighbourhood.
Just a little more -- into the #500 to #600 bracket -- and you have
moved to Newton Mearns. Or you could be in Lenzie, Bearsden or
Milngavie. Right in commuter territory.
What you get is, typically, three bedrooms, lounge, dining room,
kitchen, bathroom and shower. There is central heating, double glazing,
at least parking space, and a nice garden.
Increase the rental, up to #670 for example, and you are in
Pollokshields. A family house with family-size bathroom, separate shower
room, three bedrooms, lounge, dining room, and fitted kitchen.
You want more? Then how about a quick trip out to Westerwood. Out to
the golf course, in fact. For #1200 a month you get four bedrooms,
lounge, dining room, breakfast kitchen, bathroom, double garage, central
heating, full fittings, to a high standard. That kind of thing.
''A lot of our business at present is in the #700-#800 range,'' John
Mackenzie adds. ''Executives moving around. Meeting their needs is what
it is all about. Good property, at a good price.''

''IT's a bit of a Tardis really, it's much bigger than it looks from
outside,'' muses Dougie Donnelly on a tour of the handsome nine-roomed
sandstone semi-detached villa which is home to him, his wife Linda and
their three daughters, 12-year-old Kim, Laura whose nine, and
three-year-old Lisa.
The couple bought the house -- built around the turn of the century --
12 years ago, returning to Pollokshields where Linda grew up, from their
first home in Eaglesham, where Dougie had had a flat in his batchelor
days.
''When we moved into this house,'' says Linda, ''there was nothing
needing done structurally, but we changed quite a bit -- in fact no room
is now in its original use. The lounge was a dining room; our bedroom
was the old-style first floor lounge; the former kitchen has become the
dining room; Kim's bedroom used to be a playroom, and we've made the old
butler's pantry into a downstairs cloakroom with a WC and basin.
''That's what's nice about the house, we've been able to adapt it to
suit our needs.''
When the Donnellys arrived, she recalls, ''it had original art deco
wallpaper. I loved it, but Dougie didn't like it at all.'' She has
welcomed the opportunity of putting her creative talents to work in the
house. ''I'm very keen on decor, I thoroughly enjoy it,'' she smiles.
The most dramatic evidence of this comes when visitors cross the hall
and enter the dining room. Previously the kitche, it had an archway
through to a small breakfasting area, with a laundry room and coal
cellar beyond.
Some four years ago, Dougie explains, ''Linda sat down one night with
a piece of paper and said 'if we knocked this wall down and did that and
that...' she'd planned it all, it's very much her ideas. We got an
architect in to draw up the plans.''
The result now is a charming cosy room in restful tones of ivory, pink
and grey, with a glowing fire as its focal point. A widow seat overlooks
the garden. The archway has remained intact, but the series of little
rooms beyond have been knocked into one large, airy kitchen. By the
breakfasting corner at the far end, patio doors lead out into the
garden, which the family use at every opportunity in summer.
Next to the dining room is the sitting room where the older girls are
watching TV after school; it too, has patio doors. ''We've been quite
lucky,'' Dougie reckons, as some attractive original woodwork is
admired, ''this house escaped most of the sixties trend for taking
features like ceiling roses and cornicing away.''
While Dougie Donnelly's authoritative sports commentaries on BBC tv
may make him appear to be the star personality in this house, he has hot
competition. Lisa, who chattes non-stop shows every sign of being an
embryonic celebrity of the future...
Tucked into a corner of one of the creamy sofas, flanking a blazing
fire surrounding by a fine old mahogany carved mantelpiece in the warmly
welcoming cerise and ivory lounge, she announcs while awaiting her
mother: ''Linda's the bestest mummy in the world.'' ''Oh,'' says her
father, ''she'll be delighted to hear that.'' ''...and you,'' adds his
youngest, beaming, ''are the bestest dad.''
Climbing to the top of the house -- which has five bedrooms -- hand
clasped firmly by Lisa, we reach Dougie's study, sitting eyrie-like with
a terrific view. ''I do most of my work here. I write my column for the
Evening Times and do my research for the tv programme'' he explains.
''There's no routine to my working, there are times when I'm at home all
day, and others when I'm away. Every week is different, but this room is
well used.'' For moments of relaxation -- or inspiration-seeking? --
there's a miniature snooker table.
While thoughts of moving have occasionally crossed the Donnellys'
mind, it would clearly have to be well weighed up. Kim and Laura go to
school at Hutcheson's, while Lisa is at nursery school in Newlands for
part of the day.
''And we're so handy for town, the airport and the BBC,'' comments
Dougie nodding as Linda adds, ''We've got to know our neighbours very
well over the years and the people in the other half of the house are
good friends.''
Meantime, Linda, a languages graduate who worked in the family
advertising agency prior to becoming Mrs Donnelly, is at the early
stages of developing a small business, creating ornamental baskets
prettily decorated with artificial flowers. ''I'm selling to friends at
the moment, and I've done a night for charity,'' she says. ''I'm just
trying to build up, it's something I can do while Lisa's at nursery
school.
The spare room, currently full of her handiwork however, could be
under threat: three growing daughters, the couple feel, means another
bathroom will soon become imperative.
Talking of growing up, reminds Lisa: ''I've got a big bed now,'' she
declares. ''When I was a little girl I had a wee cot, but I gave it away
'cos I was too big for it.'' Nor has she fallen out of it yet, because,
she confides, ''it's a very magic bed.''
An appropriate note on which to leave a magic family.
