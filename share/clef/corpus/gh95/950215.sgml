James Currie reports on the increasing popularity of four-wheel drive
vehicles
FOUR-wheel drive motoring, vigorously promoted by a handful of
manufacturers as a niche market fashion two decades ago, has finally
grown up.
Some niche it turned out to be, what with registrations soaring by
more than 700% in the past 15 years and all of the big guns now
scrambling to get in on the action.
Naturally the original players have done best, with Land Rover taking
almost 40% of an increasing market and actually improving its own
performance as the competition has become more intense.
For what was supposed to be a passing fad, four-wheel drive motoring
looks like generating enough staying power to take it well into the next
century.
Its appeal is easy enough to understand. The modern 4x4 is nothing
like the wartime Jeep or even the original Land Rover of the immediate
post-war years.
Today's version is tall, stately, acceptable in any company and
extremely durable. Serious faults aren't unknown, but it takes much more
effort to break any of its mechanical components than is the case with
ordinary saloons.
Drivers like 4x4s. They are luxuriously fitted out and offer much more
car for their money than is obtainable elsewhere. The off-road
capability isn't often used unless the owner of the vehicle is a farmer,
surveyor, engineer, forestry or estate worker, but the fact that it is
there is reassuring.
So is the high driving position, which allows for excellent forward
and side visibility while simultaneously making the driver feel more
secure.
The huge tyres on juggernauts don't look quite so intimidating when
you are able to look down on them.
Another plus point is the sheer versatility of the 4x4. Many have up
to seven seats, which means they are ideally suited to parents of
growing children.
The furniture can also be shuffled around to take into account the
immediate priorities of the driver. Seating can be folded away or even
taken out altogether if large loads are to be carried.
Other even more important factors have also played their part.
The owner of a 4x4 can forget all about the stigma some people attach
to an ageing number plate. Nobody expects the driver of a Range Rover or
Mitsubishi Shogun to become embroiled in any superficial status chase.
The well maintained 4x4 -- no matter its age -- is enough to signal to
the rest of us that its owner is not the kind of person to be dragged
into a contest with Mr and Mrs Jones. A six year-old Range Rover has
more street credibility than a brand new saloon, especially as it is
never assumed to be a company car.
Add to all of this the fact that the 4x4 is arguably the most
cost-effective of all types of private vehicles and the real reason for
its upsurge in poularity is revealed.
Investing #20,000 in a well-specified on-off roadster means the driver
takes possession of a vehicle that is better equipped and more
technically sophisticated than anything else available at that price.
With regular servicing it will run for anything between 10 and 20 years
before becoming anything other than totally reliable.
The bonus at this point is that the car will still be structurally
sound and easy to dispose of. There are always customers waiting for
used 4x4s.
Drawbacks? Admittedly there are some. Running costs tend to be a
factor if your annual mileage is high. Few on/off road vehicles can
better 25 mpg overall, therefore be prepared for frequent visits to the
pumps.
Insurance costs can also be worrying as this type of car is much
sought after by thieves, so secure garaging and the fitting of a good
quality security system, preferably Tracker, should be regarded as
essential.
Accident repairs and the purchase of spare parts also mean higher than
average expenditure, but servicing costs are reasonable, given the
complexity of many of these cars.
On balance, however, drivers who are prepared to keep a 4x4 going for
anything upwards of twice the length of the ''normal'' car ownership
cycle should be in a position to save money on their motoring costs.
The high quality fitments included as standard and the fact that this
type of vehicle has been built to shrug off a great deal of abuse gives
it an important edge over mainstream models.
Add to this the fact that their manufacturers are less inclined to
tinker with their appearance, cosmetic changes arriving every three to
four years on average and significant re-engineering at even longer
intervals.
This means that the average 4x4 will age gracefully rather than
quickly become yesterday's model. And this, perhaps, is one of the
principal reasons why we are attracted to the on/off roadster. It is our
best chance of thumbing a nose at the throwaway consumerism so manifest
elsewhere in the industry.

LLOYD'S Names made history again yesterday when they received a #210m
interim award following their recent High Court victory against
negligent agents.
The massive pay-out -- the biggest of its kind -- to more than 3000
investors in four Gooda Walker syndicates has raised their hopes that
they will claw back much of their devastating losses.
Last October Mr Justice Phillips ruled the Gooda Walker Names were
entitled to some 80% of the estimated #629m swept away by negligent
underwriting in the catastrophe reinsurance market.
It was calculated at the time that investors, many of whom faced ruin,
could expect to get back some #504m but fears were raised by the agents
in court that they might in reality receive much less.
Mr Michael Deeney, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group (GWAG),
said of the pay-out: ''This is great news for Names.

RE-WORKED and re-written, Arthur Smith's ode to the fantastical
deceits of sex, first seen in Edinburgh three years ago, has now
conveniently metamorphosed into a vehicle for the amiable, still
constantly amazed (to be married) husband-and-wife team of Paul Merton
and Caroline Quentin.
Merton, he of the laconic put down and Quentin, she of the crisp aside
(like a smaller, brunette version of Victoria Wood) make a good pair.
They complement each other -- he pale to shambling, she quietly in
control. A safe pair of hands, as they say. Such that when some wag
enthusiastically called out ''get your kit off'' to Quentin in the midst
of one particularly juicy description of the male organ in full cry,
without pause or deviation she responded with a single word ''tawdry''
-- and continued as before. Now that was cool.
The Live Bed Show, though, alarmingly funny and often very graphic, is
actually full of grunts. You can hear Arthur Smith snuffling around the
subject like a porker round truffles. He simply can't leave it alone.
How to do it, when to do it, what it feels like not doing it; the
messiness of it, the embarrassment of getting it on; the chase, the
tumble, the adolescent pain of it.
Sometimes it gets very near the bone as Merton and Quentin as Cash and
Maria, an unlikely couple, encircle each other, embrace and as quickly
fall apart. Boys will be boys, Smith seems to be saying with a certain
defensiveness. But he can't fool us. He's having far too good a time.
And so are we -- even if, like foreplay, it rambles on too long and
doesn't know when to stop.

THE Bridewell Theatre -- just off Fleet Street to the south, in a
converted Victorian bathhouse -- is a recent addition to London's fringe
theatres. The current attraction is the London premiere of the best
musical revue since Side By Side by Sondheim. There are no sketches,
just 24 songs all written by Richard Maltby (words) and David Shire
(music).
Maltby is a director and compiler as well as lyricist -- his Ain't
Misbehavin makes a second West End appearance this spring. Closer Than
Ever's songs of American urban angst may not seem like an appetising
treat, but they are.
A highly proficient, attractive young cast consists of Lyanna Iveson
and Vicky Simmonds partnered by Clive Paget and Richard Tremblay
supported by a four-piece band. At times the singers have additional
vocal help from bass player Jeremy Brown and guitarist Tom Monk -- both
excellent.
Each of the evening's highly varied numbers is a little story in
itself. The results are at turns witty, at times moving, but always
sharply observed (Maltby was responsible for the lyrics of Miss Saigon).
Shire's music is tuneful and highly attractive. In Miss Bird a demure
secretary reveals her highly erotic other life. Elsewhere, One Of The
Good Guys fails to succumb to temptation -- but rather regrets it.
Nothing Like It shows the drawbacks of fitness workouts, while Another
Wedding Song hymns the joys of the twice married. The simple setting of
the show is a New York bar and it proves ideal.

AFTER more than two years of being homeless, Castle Semple, the
Lochwinnoch-based rowing club, has finally been given the green light
for building a new boathouse.
Castle Semple is based within the Clyde Muirshiel Country Park and the
club's original site had to be commandeered by the park owners,
Strathclyde Regional Council, when work started on a new visitors'
centre for the park. Since then, the club has involved itself in major
fund-raising and sponsorship drives as well as contracted negotiations
about how and where their new boathouse could be built.
That effort has now come to fruition, with a grant application to the
Foundation For Sport and the Arts being successful, although the club
has yet to hear the exact amount that it will be given, and negotiations
with Renfrewshire Enterprise, who will help build the clubhouse through
their training programmes, about to reach a satisfactory solution.
If all goes to plan, Castle Semple will be in new premises before the
end of this year

Airdrie 1, Clydebank 2
AIRDRIE squandered a golden chance to go joint-top of the first
division when they slumped to defeat at the hands of
relegation-threatened Clydebank. The visitors clinched their first win
in 16 games with two early goals.
Veteran striker Ken Eadie was the architect behind the win, opening
the scoring and then laying on the second two minutes later. But the
match, so vital for both teams, was spoiled by driving rain and wind
with the players rarely able to master the testing conditions.
Only 982 hardy souls, a record low attendance for Airdrie at their
temporary home at Broadwood Stadium, braved the elements and were
rewarded with a match which failed to arouse any passion.
There was little room for patience and subtlety on a muddy pitch, with
the long ball upfield proving the surest route to goal.
Airdrie's desperation to take something from the game was confirmed
when manager Alex MacDonald replaced central defender Graham Hay with
striker Steve Cooper in 51 minutes, but the attacking policy failed to
produce many genuine chances.
The Diamonds' only goal came from the penalty spot in 76 minutes
through Kenny Black after top scorer Andy Smith had been brought down by
Tom Currie.
Yet Airdrie had looked the more threatening squad on.
Smith outjumped his marker within two minutes to head narrowly over
from Black's cross, then two long-range efforts from skipper Jimmy
Sandison tested keeper Gary Matthews.
Clydebank took the lead against the run of play in 16 minutes, danger
man Eadie brilliantly volleying the ball from Gary Bowman's cross.
Eadie turned provider two minutes later to set up the unmarked Jim
Grady to shoot into the empty net.
Airdrie replied with a 20-yard shot from Alan Lawrence which Matthews
held on the line. Lawrence was again involved in the home side's next
raid, firing a dipping effort just over the bar.
But Bankies were dangerous on the counterattack and Bowman was not far
away with a 20-yarder on the half-hour mark.
The Diamonds were soon back on the attack and Jimmy Boyle's diving
header in 37 minutes caused a moment of anxiety in the visitors' defence
before it dropped over the bar.
A surging run by Lawrence into the box on the restart raised Airdrie's
hopes but he lost control as he tried to line up a shot. Lawrence was
also out of luck in 59 minutes, when Bowman cleared his drive off the
line.
With time running out for the Lanarkshire men, Marvyn Wilson forced
another good save from Matthews.
After Black's counter, Airdrie continued to press but could not break
down a well-organised defence.
AIRDRIE -- Martin, Stewart, Jack, Sandison, Hay, Black, Boyle, Wilson,
A Smith, Harvey, Lawrence. Substitutes -- Cooper, T Smith, McCulloch
(goal).
CLYDEBANK -- Matthews, McStay, Ferguson, Murdoch, Sweeney, Currie,
Lansdowne, Jack, Eadie, Grady, Bowman. Substitutes -- Kerrigan,
Connelly, Monaghan (goal).
Referee -- J Rowbotham (Kirkcaldy).

Dunfermline 3, Stranraer 1
DUNFERMLINE went to the top of the first division on goal difference
with this victory at soggy East End Park last night.
Stranraer may have had the first shot at goal when Lex Grant was
allowed time and space at the edge of the box in the first minute, his
shot dipping just over, but from then until the half-time whistle,
Dunfermline dominated and there looked to be the length of more than one
division between the sides.
Steve Ross, the Stranraer keeper, performed heroics to deny Hamish
French after 29 minutes. His good work was spoiled at the resulting
corner when he missed Paul Smith's inswinger. The ball fell to Andy Tod,
who flicked it over his shoulder. The danger should have been cleared by
defender Jim Hughes, but as he tried to control the ball on the line, it
squirmed under his foot and over.
Dunfermline were made to pay for their misses on the hour mark when
they were caught upfield, and Tommy Sloan found himself in acres of
space on the right wing. The striker kept his head and strode forward to
chip keeper Guido van de Kamp.
The over-stretched Stranraer defence eventually snapped after 76
minutes when substitute Kenny Ward and hammered home a shot from 25
yards. And Jackie McNamara scored 10 minutes from time.
Caley Thistle 0, Montrose 4
MONTROSE ran riot in the second half of this match, despite having
strikers Colin McGlashan and Alan Kennedy out through injury and
suspension. Too many chances were missed in the first half.
But after the break, Stuart Beedie drilled home a left foot shot from
the edge of the area in 57 minutes, and two minutes later, John Scott
felled Innes McDonald in the box and Beedie sank the spot kick. Colin
Milne hit the third in 73 minutes after a good run and cross from Ian
Robertson. Then man of the match, Mark Haro, made it four in 82 minutes
with an 18-yard effort.
Brechin 0, Stenhousemuir 2
THIS was a tremendous top v bottom second division encounter in the
quagmire that was Glebe Park.
City were caught cold in only two minutes, but had Stenhousemuir
defending for long periods. 'Muir's opener came from Adrian Sprott, who
ran through from midfield to volley the ball into the corner of the net
from 18 yards.
After a spell of City pressure, Stenhousemuir keeper Mike Harkness
saved a shot from Doug Scott, and the keeper came to the rescue again to
stop a Ray Smith effort.
Stenhousemuir substitute Dave Roseburgh replaced Dave Fisher, who went
off with an injured shoulder in 48 minutes. City's luck was out when
Harry Cairney shaved the post with a 30-yard free kick.
In the last minute, however, Evan Donaldson crossed over for Gary
Hutchison to knock in Stenhousemuir's second.
QoS 3, East Fife 3
A last minute goal by Tommy Bryce gave Queens a deserved share of the
points.
East Fife went ahead when Paul Hunter scored in 32 minutes. Queens,
however, kept pegging away and equalised a minute before the interval
when the wind caught a corner from Tommy Bryce which was deflected off a
defender into the net.
The Dumfries side started the second half well. The East Fife defence
failed to clear a cross from David Kenendy, and Duncan Campbell swept
the ball low into the net. But the Fifers, now with the wind in their
backs, gained control, and Hunter pulled them back into the game with
his second goal in 61 minutes.
It looked all over for Queens when a neat move by the Fifers from the
halfway line ended with Donaghy picking his spot in the net.
But the Dumfries men put in a strong finish and with just seconds to
go, Bryce shot from the edge of the box to level the match.
Six goals and all even.

It is easy to understand agents Savills' enthusiasm for the
32,000-acre Wyvis Estate in Ross-shire , which they are looking to let.
Seriously spectacular is the only way to describe the scenery of one
of Scotland's top sporting estates, which borders Loch Glass and has
four Munros on hand for the energetic to climb.
There are shooting rights for up to 65 red deer stags (over the
season), also grouse and ptarmigan.
And there are brown trout from the loch.
Cost: about #1800 a weel, plus #250 per stag. Or say around #32,000
for the season, with the sporting rights thrown in.
And, just the thing to relax in after a hard day on the hills, Wyvis
Lodge, pictured right, has a heated outdoor swimming pool.

THE veteran comedy actor Peter Jones was reflecting on radio the other
day as to how a dislike of rugby had been instilled into his soul.
''They made me scrum down in the second row and I wound up with my head
just a few inches above the wet surface of the pitch.
''When I was completely locked in, one of my team-mates, who obviously
thought I was not trying hard enough, scooped up a ball of mud, pulled
back the elastic on my shorts and dropped the stuff down. Then he hit
it!''
Nothing as foul as that ever happened to me but, during a
mud-spattered encounter of bygone times I, quite uncharacteristically,
threw a player to ground and his jersey was ripped off his back. Sadly,
he was one of my side and he made me buy him a replacement.
As the rain came down and the floods came up at the weekend, there
were the predictable cries of ''Why would anyone want to play sport in
conditions like that?'' and ''When are we going to move over to summer
football/rugby?''
My dear wife, whose sporting career began and ended when, having been
placed in goal, she deserted the hockey field because she did not like
anyone shooting at her, often expresses the opinion that all sportsmen
are quite crazy. I pointed out on Sunday that the rugby women of
Scotland and Ireland were battling it out in the Myreside mud -- and
enjoying themselves hugely -- just around the corner from our house; she
received the news like a missive from a madman.
It must be more than 30 years since I heard my first summer-soccer
argument. I am sure the advocate then was Bobby Ancell, a very pleasant
chap who used to manage Motherwell.
His theory was that, with the sun on our backs, the traditional
Scottish skills would flourish -- wee bandy-legged lads would be playing
keepy-uppy in the centre circle before nutmegging full backs on the way
to the bye-line. We'd teach these Brazilians a trick or two.
I thought there were holes in the argument even then and I am even
less convinced by it now. The sun-soaked terraces of Tynecastle are
still likely to want the ball to be played upfield pdq, the hard men are
still going to thunder into the tackle, the injuries are likely to be
more serious.
Gavin Hastings is a strong advocate of summer rugby. In his book, High
Ball and Happy Hours, he argues: ''The better weather enjoyed by the
southern hemisphere countries gives them a huge advantage over us
Europeans. You simple cannot compare the winter climates of Australia,
New Zealand, and South Africa with the sort of hellish conditions of the
British winter. We often need three or four layers of clothing,
including thermals, with waterproof tops over training jerseys and
track-suits.''
Yup, and that's just in the press box! Well, I obviously can't argue
with Gav about the difference between the northern and southern
hemispheres. I do, however, wonder if summer rugby -- which would have
to compete with cricket, athletics, golf, and racing for money and
attention -- would be quite the hit he imagines.
And I did much enjoy the sight of the South Africans coming a cropper
at muddy Melrose.
What are we going to do in the winter if there is no football and
rugby? Are the folk who troop to Ibrox and Murrayfield to be sent off to
watch indoor bowling or synchronised swimming? Don't even mention
shopping.
Surely some magic will be lost if Rangers or Hibs are not to be
despatched to deepest Montrose for a cup-tie in the dead of winter.
''You began to wonder if you would ever see your parents again,'' mused
Ally McCoist after one such mission.
I wouldn't have missed the sight of the French rugby party arriving in
Inverness for a B international in December. ''Is thees,'' enquired
their coach, ''ze revenge for your defeat last year?''
What would sports writers do without such material? Or photographers.
Wasn't that a great shot by Lesley Donald of the bare-cheeked Edinburgh
Academical in Monday's issue?
No, no, those who want sunshine every day, and sport to be a gentle
canter in the heat, should take themselves off to warmer climes. There
is nothing so satisfying, after a hard winter's game, than to enjoy a
cup of tea and a pie followed by a couple of drams to restore inner
warmth. And that is just in the press box, too.
Personally, I hope it pours in Paris on Saturday. They don't like it,
these Frenchies.

IAN Jardine the mathematics teacher spends his days at the chalk-face,
deploying algebraic equations and geometrical angles.
Meanwhile, Jardine the international centre-threequarter, who makes
his Parc des Princes debut for Scotland in Paris on Saturday, has become
a key component of the Scottish rugby formula that has already proved
successful against Canada and Ireland.
The Stirling County man, who first played for Scotland 'B' in 1989,
did not make his full Scotland debut until 1993 and, after the four-year
wait, had the misfortune for it to coincide with the visit to
Murrayfield of Sean Fitzpatrick's All Blacks, when Scotland slumped to a
51-15 defeat.
But the Larbert High schoolmaster did not go down with the ship. He
toured Argentina with Scotland last summer and was a member of the 'A'
side that performed heroically against South Africa and Italy.
Now, from his berth at inside centre, Jardine's already widely
respected defensive qualities have been augmented with the pathfinding
role of taking the ball over the gain-line, tying down enemy loiterers,
and giving his forwards a target on which to focus before spreading play
anew.
Of late, the tactics have been effective, but not necessarily a thing
of classical beauty. The rugby purists demur and the hospitality
packagers in the Murrayfield stands just don't understand.
Jardine, 29, is philosophical about the the critics; nor does he
believe they are all to be found in the hospitality suites. ''I'm more
concerned at what the coaches and the players around me think, and most
of them are satisfied with the way I'm playing.
''I thought I played well against Canada, yet you still get criticism
in the press. But I suppose you boys have to get a story from somewhere.
''The midfield is where the competition is just now. There's Scott
Hastings with all his caps not in the side, and Tony Stanger playing
well, so there are options there for the selectors. There's an obvious
storyline there for writers who want to criticise,'' Jardine says.
Then, with good-natured patience, he gives the low-down on his modus
operandi.
''I've not always played the same way. You have to go back to Stirling
County when we were in Divison Two. Our coach Richie Dixon, now
assistant coach with Scotland, moulded the team into a style of play
that would allow us first of all to survive in Division One and then,
once it had been developed, to allow us to challenge for the
championship. It worked, and we're doing that now.
''I was an integral part of Richie's gameplan. He asked me to play in
a certain way. I know what people are getting at when they say it's not
everyone's cup of tea. I link with the forwards more than other backs.
''But the reason for that isn't for my benefit. It's to set up quick
second-phase ball. That's the idea with the national side now as well.
Very few national sides now score off first-phase ball,'' he said.
''It doesn't really matter if that happens from inside or outside
centre. You're hitting roughly the same area. Whether it's a few yards
in or out is neither here nor there.
''Off lineout ball, an inside centre can reach the 'pocket' of space
behind the forwards easier than the outside man. The plan is to draw in
the forwards, stop them hanging about, and then release the backs into
space.''
Jardine has never been to the French rugby citadel of Parc des
Princes. ''This is all new to me, but I can't wait. I believe the
atmosphere is electric.
''Along with my four brothers and sister we arranged a trip to Paris
for our parents. It's now been linked with the game, I've kept my place,
so it's worked out well. One of my brothers is going and my wife, Ann,
will be there if we can arrange things for the youngster.''
The ''youngster'' is nine-month-old Megan, and Jardine is finding,
like many a modern day internationalist before him, that top-grade rugby
takes a huge slice out of family life.
''It takes a lot of time and effort, but even when I wasn't being
picked I never lost heart. It's the thought of a cap and then being
successful with the side that keeps you going.
''I do weights on a Monday, train with the club on Tuesdays and
Thursdays, sprints on Wednesdays, play on Saturdays, and attend Scotland
squad sessions on Sundays. Friday nights I take off from rugby! It's
even more difficult now that the wee one is here, but it's rewarding as
well,'' he said.
Jardine wins his eighth cap in Paris and, alongside clubmate Kenny
Logan, is a prime advertisement for the Bridgehaugh way. ''I started
rugby at Bannockburn HS, but went down to Stirling County as an
11-year-old. I began with the midis and came right up through the
system.''
He played his first game for the 1st XV as a 17-year-old, and has been
a regular with the current championship leaders ever since. A win in
Paris on Saturday, continued success in the Scotland side, and
Stirling's first Division One title would just about make Ian Jardine's
season. The maths master probably reckons that it all adds up.

TONY Blair aspires to be a hero in middle England. I have already made
it.
Over the past two weeks letters from round the English shires have
been flowing into my office at the rate of 100 every post.
The subject matter is the recent conduct of British Gas. Herald
readers have done more than their bit following my previous strikes back
against the empire. However, the recent mass response from south of the
Border came after an English Sunday tabloid called for their readers to
support the campaign against the astronomic pay awards for top
management.
The mailbag has not been from ''disgusted'' of Hemel Hempstead but
from ordinary, decent people from all walks of life. They are sickened
by the Tory creation of a land fit for spivs when John Major had
promised warm beer and village greens.
These are the ''plain people'' of England or perhaps, as Chesterton
had it, those ''that have never spoken yet''. Well they are speaking now
and shouting their contempt for the 75% man, chief executive Cedric
Brown, from the nearest rooftop.
In almost all cases they are long-term investors. They are people who
bought British Gas shares, not to make a quick buck, but to have a stake
in their company. For all that it is privatised they still see it as
primarily a public service.
They are now ashamed to be associated with British Gas and angry and
resentful of a management who have dragged its reputation into such
odium.
Many are pensioners unable to travel to the annual general meeting but
delighted to make a gesture of defiance by allocating their proxy votes.
One Tory lady from Shropshire wrote that the excesses of British Gas
had made her question her political outlook for the first time in half a
century. Others had a range of colourful suggestions as to where they
thought the fat cat's fat cheques should be stuffed.
Many have wider concerns on the retreat of the company from the High
Streets, on safety, and on the unfair preference being given to some
customers over others, and most write of their support for the gas
workers.
Some make the point that seems to be obvious to everyone but the fat
cats licking up the cream in the privatised utilities -- that there is a
substantial difference between an entrepreneur being rewarded after
risking his own money in building up a business and creating jobs and
the executive asset stripping of public services where employment is now
being rapidly run down.
Words and phrases like ''common decency'', ''justice'', and
''fairness'' adorn their correspondence. One widow from Reading, whose
shares were bought by her husband just months before his death, detailed
exactly what it would mean to her and her two children if she could have
a 75% rise in her meagre fixed income. She did so without a shred of
self pity.
I don't know if Messrs Brown and Giordano at the top of the executive
tree in British Gas are losing any sleep about the message of revolt
spreading among their small shareholders. They should be. The winds that
are blowing now could yet remove them from their perch.
The behaviour of British Gas has become a symbol of all that is rotten
in post-Thatcher Britain, the eclipse of public service by private
greed. The shareholders have their own champion in a retired Scottish
academic, Professor Lamb, whose vision is clear and whose motives are
unimpeachable.
He and the shareholder army will be supported by the demoralised staff
and by frustrated customers as they march upon the annual general
meeting in May. We will go, not with the expectation of winning a block
vote where the chairman has the votes of the big institutions safely in
his pocket, but of gaining a moral victory so sweeping that change will
become inevitable.
Each time John Major refuses to act on boardroom excesses he does
himself more damage. He should reflect on another piece of wisdom from G
K Chesterton -- ''all conservatism is based on the idea that if you
leave things alone you leave them as they are. But you do not. If you
leave a thing alone you leave it to a torrent of change.''
If you would like to help please write to me at the House of Commons.

Lothian Schools 25,
Glasgow Schools 18
AFTER having trailed 18-3 in yesterday's Bank of Scotland schools
under-18 inter-district championship match, Lothian finished strongly.
They were more cohesive up front and slicker at moving the ball behind
the scrum.
But Glasgow harnessed the breeze at Meadowmill (the match had been
scheduled for Inverleith) to forge 15-0 ahead.
Stand-off Scott Weston opened with a penalty before Scottish Schools
centre Alan Bulloch scored a fine try from his own break near halfway.
Weston missed that conversion but added the points to a try by flanker
Grant Howieson.
Lothian's fightback started with a penalty by full back Danny
Mallinson. Weston kicked a goal for 18-3, but stand-off Brian Townsend
dropped a goal, Andrew Dall finished off a clever move with a try, and
scrum half Doug Ferguson scuttled in for another, both converted by
Mallinson.Winger Alistair Donaldson then ran in a try from halfway.
Lothian Schools -- D Mallinson (George Watson's College);  A Donaldson
(Stewart's-Melville College), H Allan (George Watson's), G Ross (George
Heriot's School),  M Tweedie; B Townsend, D  Ferguson;   G  Hoyle (all

SALES at retail stores in the US rose modestly in January, an eighth
straight monthly rise despite a dip in demand for new cars.
Total retail sales were up 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted $193.2bn
after a sharply revised 0.2% gain in December that previously was
reported as a 0.1% decline.
Sales by new car dealers fell 0.6% in January after a 0.2% December
gain. It was the first decline in the key category since a 1% fall last
July, according to he Commerce Department.
New cars account for about one-fifth of total retail sales, so swings
in demand strongly affect the overall monthly figures.
Excluding cars, retail sales were up 0.4% in January and rose 0.1% in
December.
The last time overall retail sales actually fell was in April last
year. They were flat in May and then began rising in an unbroken string
in June.
There were reports that car dealer inventories were on the rise in
January and more dealers began offering rebates and discounts, a sign
that consumer demand might be starting to weaken after a strong 1994.
Furniture sales also weakened in January, falling 0.7% after a 1.4%
jump in December. Costlier mortgage rates have begun to slow the housing
market and that saps demand for furniture and other household goods.
Sales by general merchandise stores gained last month by 1.1% after a
slim 0.2% December increase. But at apparel stores, sales of clothing
dropped 0.5% after a 0.9% fall in December.
Sales of all types of durable goods, which includes cars and other
long-lasting and usually expensive items, fell 0.4% in January after a
0.3% drop in December. Sales of non-durables like food and clothing were
up 0.5% last month after an identical gain in December.
Food store sales increased 0.7% last month following a 0.1% December
fall.
Petrol service station sales increased 1.9% after a 1.7% rise in
January, largely because of higher prices -- REUTER.

IN the light of recent results, it's probably not surprising that when
Scotland played England at the West of Scotland cricket ground, the home
team won.
According to Mark Struthers,the visitors' were put to shame -- and he
should know since he has a grandstand view of the pitch.
From the comfort of his stylish armchairs he can watch every ball. If
the sound of leather on willow has any appeal,then this second floor
flat at No.8 Burghhall Street in Glasgow is the perfect address. The
recently built complex is even called The Oval.
But for those without the slightest interest in cricket, the position
of the flat is still exceptionally attractive.
Few homes can enjoy quite so many amenities while overlooking a broad
oasis of peace and space. Beyond the cricket pitch, tall trees add to
the feeling of escape.
Much as he likes the flat, Mark is due to get married in the summer
and is looking for somewhere with a garden. However, there are private
gardens at The Oval for anyone with a less hands-on attitude to
planting. There is also plenty of private parking, another boon in the
middle of Glasgow's West End.
Mark snapped up his two-year-old home just after it had been built,
and set about adding some stylish extras. ''The curtains were actually
made from very inexpensive material,'' he adds, referring to the
beautiful and very professional drapes that frame his wonderful view.
They give a real oppulence to the room.
The sitting room has plenty of space for his cream leather suite as
well as a round dining table and chairs. There are lime washed wood
fitments against cream painted walls and with the large windows it all
combines to give a light and very airy atmosphere.
Panels of glass with timber frames are a feature of the room, forming
a divider between the dining area and the hall.
A fully-fitted white kitchen leads off the main room with an
integrated fridge, washer and dryer included.
Speckled grey and white work surfaces and white wall tiles make the
room fresh and welcoming, even if it is just to tackle the washing up. A
cheerful yellow and blue checked blind adds the finishing detail,
spanning two windows.
The second bedroom is currently used as a study, though a bed settee
quickly converts it back to a large guest room. The fitted wardrobe
extends the length of one wall with smart mirrored sliding doors.
The main bathroom has a peach coloured suite and toning carpets that
are fitted throughout the flat.
The hall has been papered in yellow stripes and has two large walk-in
cupboards on either side. The gas central heating boiler is tucked away
in one of them. ''There is also loft space above for more storage,''
adds Mark, pointing out the trap door that gives access to it.
The master bedroom has its own ensuite shower room, also fitted out in
white. There is a tiled shower cubicle with grey smoked-glass doors and
a built-in vanity unit fitted with white louvred doors around a white
suite. The bedroom also has a large built-in cupboard with mirrored
doors and the windows overlook the gardens.
Just in case the sound of dignified clapping becomes too enthusiastic,
double glazing makes the flat both quiet and warm. All the windows have
natural wood surrounds to cut down on maintenance. The double front door
and security entrance adds to the privacy.
The front of the building looks on to Peel Street and the brickwork is
of the same honey-coloured finish as nearby Victorian buildings. There
is a monoblock drive of contrasting pink brickwork and low walls divide
the lawns and flower beds from the parking area.
Mark says he has only once seen a ball reach the parked cars, and not
with enough force to do any damage. On the other hand, this very stylish
flat could definitely be the one to bowl you over.

British companies went on a spending spree towards the end of last
year on overseas acquisitions.
Expenditure on acquisitions overseas by UK companies in the final
quarter at #5500m was the highest value recorded since the third quarter
of 1989, according to figures from the Central Statistical Office.
There were 23 more acquisitions overseas in the fourth quarter than in
the third quarter and in 1994 as a whole UK companies spent #15.1bn on
acquisitions, the highest annual figure recorded since 1989.
However, the number of deals in 1994 was lower than in previous years.
Spending on acquisitions in the UK by overseas companies slightly
increased in value to #1400m in the fourth quarter of 1994 against
#1200m in the previous quarter. In 1994 as a whole expenditure on
acquisitions was #5.2 billion, similar to 1993.
Expenditure on acquisitions between UK companies in the fourth quarter
of 1994 was #2000m, unchanged from that recorded the previous quarter.
In 1994 UK companies spent #8500m on acquisitions within the UK, the
highest figure since 1991.
The largest transactions recorded during the fourth quarter were the
acquisition of French insurer Group Victoire by Commercial Union and the
acquisition of L&amp;F Household in the US by Reckitt &amp; Colman.
In 1994 the largest transaction was the acquisition of Sterling
Winthrop by SmithKline Beecham.
As in the previous quarter, the US accounted for the largest
proportion of the value of acquisitions (46%). But the level of UK
investment in Europe showed a large increase, #2300m in quarter four
1994 compared with #500m in the previous quarter. This was mainly
attributable to the acquisition of Group Victoire.

THE first buds of a new lifestyle are beginning to flower in The Park,
a district where elegant tiers of townhouses stand on the hill above
Kelvingrove Park.
For much of the post-War period an area which was designed for living
in has been shunned by residents, its sky-high drawing rooms and
tasteful dining rooms turned into offices and architects' studios. Now
the commercial citadel on the hill is being quietly infiltrated by
residents.
A tiny band of pioneers and architecture-lovers has been among the
first to buy offices which can't find tenants and turn them back into
residential use. Last August The Herald predicted that much of the area
would revert to residential use 'within five years.' It is now clear
that the process is under way andtwo factors are driving the slow, but
remarkable, transition.
Although many of them have been tastefully upgraded, these buildings
no longer meet the needs of modern office space users. Since many are
A-listed it is difficult to create open plan space o r introduce
computer trunking.
Parking is a major local issue and many tenants are seeking new leases
in the modern office parks with their easy access, open plan space, and
extensive car parking. As a result, many of the offices can't find
tenants.
Meanwhile, a recent change in the rules means that the conversion of
these commercial buildings to residential use is exempt from VAT. The
opportunity has been grasped by developers and individual purchasers
alike.
In one of the largest moves so far, an office building at Nos.19 and
20 Royal Terrace is being turned into flats.
''When its tenants moved out the owners asked me to find another
office user,'' says Ian Fotheringham of surveyors Fotheringham &amp; Co. ''I
had to tell them that there was simply no demand in The Park for offices
any more. Look along some of these terraces and you will see a board on
every building. I recommended that we find a residential purchaser.''
His clients took his advice and work is scheduled to start this week
on creating seven flats at prices ranging from #45,000 to #115,000.
Developer Tom Coakley of Simon Homes was pleasantly surprised by the
willingness of the banks to lend on such an innovative project. He was
even more surprised by the demand.
Three of the flats have already been sold although the purchasers had
nothing more to go on than the plans drawn up by architects Matheson &amp;
Gleave.
''This project has gone much more smoothly than we had anticipated.
The planning department was very keen on this scheme and has gone out of
its way to help us. They seem determined to bring the area back to
residential use, although it will be a gradual process,'' says Tom
Coakley.
The local plan for Park/Anderston district says ''the district council
will encourage further residential use into the Park Circus area'. Ross
Burton of the planning department says that there has been a surge in
applications and inquiries for conversion of buildings to residential in
the last few months.
''Things seemed to build a head of steam after The Herald's feature
last year,'' he says. ''It is our policy to help and encourage this
process, although people should be warned that it is not always easy to
convert an A-listed building.''
Other recent successful applications include No.9 Park Terrace, where
the entire building is being converted from offices to a single
residence, and No.7 Park Quadrant, where the top floor and attic are
being converted from offices into an apartment.
The latter is being converted by Paul Miller, a planner with Eastwood
District Council. ''The property had been used an office, but had
languished for two years on the market unable to find a buyer. Like most
planners, I'm really keen on architecture, so I suppose this was
something of an emotional purchase.
''I'm going to restore it -- not to it's former glory, nobody could
afford that -- but I want to bring back as much of possible of its
previous atmosphere.''
He admits that getting permission and building warrants for his
alterations and restorations has not been easy, but says that the effort
is worth it. ''Anybody buying one of these properties should get the
best professional advice. And you've got to be a bit pig-headed. There
are a lot of problems with this kind of restoration.''
But he feels that he has bought himself a wonderful place in which to
live, and he has already moved into his top-floor home on the outside of
the Circus looking over Woodlands.
''I love the feel of the stone. Park is like a miniature village set
high on a hill. It's quite European, probably the best example of the
city's European links,'' he says.
As the tide towards residential picks up pace, planners and developers
will be faced with some dilemmas. While some of the smaller buildings on
the fringe of Park can be converted without too much difficulty, many of
the outstanding townhouses at the top of the hill will pose a real
challenge, both financially and architecturally.
Few people could afford to convert a four-storey A-listed building in
Park Circus into a single residence. Compromises on the internal lay-out
of conversions might be necessary. But, pleased to see their policy
beginning to work, the planners appear to be taking the view that they
will jump those hurdles when they come to them.
Meanwhile, a major opportunity has arisen through Park School's
decision to sell one of its two properties in the Park area. ''I've had
some inquiries from developers asking about potential conversion to
residential, and none so far asking about office use,'' says Ross
Burton.
''It won't be easy to turn the building into homes, but it's a very
interesting prospect.''

* INTERNATIONAL fund manager Govett &amp; Company has hit back at the
investment company that last week sued it for alleged fraud and
negligence.
Govett said both generally and in detail it regarded the lawsuit
brought in the United States by the Govett American Endeavour Fund as
utterly without merit.
''Govett believes that the utterance of these unfounded allegations by
GAEF has caused it and its shareholders injury,'' added the firm.
''Govett has therefore instructed its counsel to prepare legal action
against GAEF and its directors and will be seeking very substantial
damages.''
GAEF, which is suing Govett for #12.9m, specialises in debt finance in

PROPERTY investment and development group St Modwen Properties
delighted investors with a near four-fold increase in earnings and a 60%
leap in the dividend payout.
During the year to the end of November, pre-tax profits soared to a
record #13.2m from #3.5m with the total dividend boosted from a penny to
1.6p. Earnings per share climbed by 7p to 9.2p.
The profits figure was boosted by a one-off #3.8m from the sale of the
Octagon shopping centre in Burton upon Trent.
Stan Clarke, chairman of the Birmingham-based company, said he made no
apology for emphasising again the group's clear-cut strategy which is to
control costs, increase rental income, undertake developments where the
profit is secure and obtain long-term agreements on well located land
with development potential.
The majority of the company's interests are medium-term and are
subject to variable rates of interest.
As a result of the significant gap between long and short-term
interest rates, it was felt necessary to take out special hedging
arrangements to protect the company against the possibility of
significant increases in future short-term interest rates.

THE longstanding fortunes that were viewed by breeders of Highland
cattle hit the buffers in Oban yesterday at the annual Spring sale.
Only the best cattle were wanted and many of the cattle, particularly
those shown by hobby breeders, struggled and eventually failed to meet
any commercial demand. But at the same time cattle of true quality sold
well. The top price was 7500 guineas for a bull from Ms Janet Nelson
from Glengorm, Tobermory, Isle of Mull, which sold to her namesake, Ms
Jane Nelson, from Achnacloich, Oban, Argyll.
The bull trade was highly variable with one selling for as little as
150 guineas but the next best top price was one at 6500 guineas from Mr
and Mrs W S Knox from Mains of Glentruim, Newtonmore, to Mr and Mrs Ken
Brown, Ledlanet, Kinross.
Leading Perthshire farmer Alex Murray summed up the bull trade quite
appropriately: ''Highland cattle are suffering from their own popularity
and the best thing that could happen to most of this breed is that the
heifers could meet a good upstanding beef shorthorn bull.''
Mr Murray who runs a herd of 90 Highland cows intends to do precisely
that with his own herd, viewing the market for cross Highland heifers as
being much the best outlet.
The heifer market was also highly variable. The best price came for
the champion heifer which was one from Mr Tom McLatchie, Millerston,
Ayr, which sold at 3800 guineas to Mr T Lund, Doncaster.
Next best at 3700 guineas was one from the McLeod of McLeod, from
Dunvegan, Isle of Skye, which sold to Redcastle Farms, Montrose.

<HEADLINE>Minister blames lack of support from Scottish food and drink industry. Quality mark scheme collapses</HEADLINE>

AN ambitious multi-million-pound plan to devise and promote a single
quality mark for Scottish food and drink products has been abandoned
because of lack of support from the private sector.
Sir Hector Monro, Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, said yesterday
that indications of support from the food and drink industry were not
sufficiently firm to warrant committing any more public funds to the
project.
The quality mark business plan had indicated a need for a total
expenditure of #19m over the next six years, of which #7.7m would be
required from the public sector. Much of the money would have been spent
on designing a quality mark and then promoting it to the point where it
became instantly recognisable internationally.
The consultation process with leading players in the food and drinks
industries revealed lukewarn support in vital areas including the whisky
and salmon industries. Support from these two sectors was said to be
''less than wholehearted'', denying the project any realistic prospect
of success.
The Scotch Whisky Association said they had been involved in the
consultations but had pointed out that Scotch was already well
established and marketed internationally as a quality product. ''We had
to ask them to demonstrate where the benefits would be for us,'' said
their spokesman, Mr Campbell Evans.
''Scotch is already recognised and packaged as a Scottish product
controlled by definition and with the benefit of legal protection,''
Sir Hector said that despite the abandonment of the single food
quality mark the Government remained committed to to encouraging quality
food schemes in Scotland and the promotion of quality exports.
Support will continue for the Scottish Food Quality Certification
Company whose role will be to supervise the various quality schemes
which apply to individual sectors of the food production industry.
Compared to the single quality mark scheme the quality certification
company will operate with #60,000 pump priming finance from the Scottish
Office.
The Scottish Office is also providing funding of #250,000 for the
publication of a code of practice manual for the Scottish Quality Farm
Assurance project pioneered by the National Farmers Union of Scotland.
The manual will be completed next month and will provide a basis for
further developments in maintaining the quality of Scottish produce.
The quality farm assurance schemes cover Scottish beef, lamb, pigs,
trout and cereals. Participants in the schemes are required to adhere to
standards which ensure that the end product is of high quality and can
be marketed as having been raised or grown in ways which are
environmentally acceptable. One the most important aspects of the
schemes if traceability -- so that any individual animal or batch of
produce can be traced back to source.
Some farmers have been slow to see the benefits of the schemes,
however, and have been suggesting that they should receive an enhanced
price -- a premium payment -- for turning out quality assured produce.
Mr Charles Russell, convener of the NFUS field vegetable committee,
warned yesterday, however, that the system didn't work that way. ''There
is no premium -- only a guaranteed market,'' he told farmers at a
conference in Letham, Fife, organised by the Scottish Agricultural
College. The guaranteed market was, however, a premium market, he said.
The alternative was no market.
''What chance do we have of survival if we are unable to unite and
work together to improve our marketing system?'' he asked.
Other schemes still receiving government and EC support include the
Marketing Development Scheme, launched in June last year, which will
provide grants of up to #150,000 for feasability studies to help the
better marketing of Scottish produce.
The EC Processing and Marketing Grant Scheme, also launched last year,
provides capital assistance for investment in the processing and
marketing of quality produce. Resources of more than #5m a year are
available under the two schemes.

IN a bold move which shows the company's conviction that there is a
strong demand for upmarket new homes, a Scottish builder has launched a
development which includes houses priced at over #200,000.
A new collection of five styles is being introduced by Avonside Homes
at Westward Rise, the company's development in Bearsden.
Most of the houses have been designed as split-level, sometimes over
three floors.
The new designs include the Swallow, a three-bedroom detached property
with lounge, living room, dining room, study, utility room, and
cloakroom, starting at #147,000.
The four-bedroom Jay, which starts from #178,750, and the four-bedroom
Tern which starts at #167,500, include lounge, dining room, utility
room, and store room and gallery.
The Heron starts at #170,500 and provides four bedrooms, a lounge,
dining room, utility room and study.
The most expensive house at Westward Rise is the Ptarmigan, priced
from #202,250. This property has four bedrooms, lounge, living room,
dining room, utility room, and a cloakroom, and features a large front
balcony.
The houses all have double garages, hardwood finishes to doors,
windows, skirtings and balustrades. The main bedrooms also have en-suite
facilities.
Purchasers can choose from a variety of high quality fitted kitchens
and bathrooms with ranges of complementary tiling.
Avonside is building a total of 39 three and four-bedroom detached
homes at Westward Rise, where prices range from #147,000 to #202,000.
Avonside's managing director, Bob Gillespie, said: ''The split-level
house styles are unique to our Bearsden development and demonstrate our
ability to adapt our designs to suit the surrounding environment, as
well as reacting to customers' preferences for individuality.
''We firmly believe in listening to our customers. One example of this
is the amount of cupboard and wardrobe space included in the design of
all the new house types.''

RESIDENTIAL lettings have been surprisingly busy since December,
reports Countrywide's Glasgow office, but they still have some
distinctly pleasant properties to let.
If you are looking for something really upmarket you might consider an
apartment at Thorntonhall, part of a recent luxury complex. With a
rental set at #1300 a month, inquirers would expect a fair amount for
their money.
They'd be right. They'd find spacious accommodation with lounge,
dining room, fully fitted kitchen, double bedroom, twin bedroom, single
bedroom and a bathroom.
That's it? Not quite. The Thorntonhall development is one of those
where residents have that bit more on hand, for their entertainment and
enjoyment.
It includes use of a pleasant sun lounge, a gymnasium if you really
want to get in shape for the holidays, a jacuzzi, and a sauna. Plus a
swimming pool, just to finish off the picture of laze-about luxury.
Perhaps that's too rich for the blood. Travel on, then, to Langbank in
a splendidly quiet part of Renfrewshire.
Here you can rent a newly-built detached villa, with open views over
the Clyde estuary.
The property has lounge, living room, dining room, kitchen cum
breakfast room, utility room, four bedrooms - one with the ubiquitous en
suite addition - a family-size bathroom, and a downstairs toilet.
There is electric heating, and a double garage. All for #1200 a month.
Interestingly, it could also be let at #900 a month.
Perhaps a tenement flat is more what is sought. For some #800 a month,
reflecting current prices apparently, there is a traditional sandstone
property on the south side, in Pollokshields.
Handy for all amenities, this one offers lounge, kitchen cum dining
room, three double bedrooms, bathroom with shower, and gas central
heating. There is parking off-street at the rear.
Handy for those with an interest in Spango Valley, is a modern
detached villa at Bishopton. This comes in at #650 a month, providing
lounge, dining room, two double bedrooms and two singles.
There's a utility room with washing machine and tumble drier, kitchen
with gas cooker plus freezer and fridge. Plus a garage.
This kind of property close to the M8 and Erskine Bridge is obviously
suitable for a commuting businessman or indeed a senior company rep not
wanting to be in the city centre.
Hyndland could be the choice, however,for someone on the look-out for
a ground-floor open-plan West End flat. This one has the usual
lounge-cum-dining room, plus a double bedroom and shower room. There is
a fully fitted kitchen with electric oven, hob, fridge-freezer,
microwave and washing machine.
This costs #425 a month.

HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is experiencing strong trading,
benefiting from buoyant economies in the US and UK, its two major
markets, but does not expect to continue growing at the same rate.
In the quarter to the end of December, Hanson reported a 58% leap in
profits from #172m to #272m on sales of #3200m. However, the 1993 profit
figure was distorted by a #66m provision because of the effects of the
Peabody coal strike in the US. Fully diluted earnings per share grew by
56% to 3.9p and the next quarterly dividend of 3.0p will be paid on 6
April.
Chief executive Derek Bonham said the ''excellent result'' confirmed
the group's forward momentum with good performances from virtually all
the businesses. In particular, Quantum, the largest US manufacturer of
polyethylene and industrial chemicals, was said to have performed
strongly. However, Mr Bonham cautioned that this pace of growth was
unlikely to continue throughout the rest of the year. However, with
generally improved volumes and margins the outlook remains positive.
The results, at the top end of City expectations, did nothing to
dampen speculation about a possible bid by Hanson, which has said that
it is well placed financially to go on a shopping expedition.
Speaking at the recent annual meeting Lord Hanson, the chairman, said
''Our borrowing capability puts us in a position to act.....should the
opportunity arise''.
Speculation on likely bid targets has spanned several sectors and has
included the troubled retail group Kingfisher, Argyll, owners of the
Safeway supermarket chain, food manufacturer United Biscuits,
construction group Costain, and any one of the privatised regional
electricity companies of England and Wales.
Hanson's ideal acquisition -- like that of fellow conglomerate
Trafalgar House -- would be of a company providing relatively stable UK
earnings and strong cash generation.
This would help to offset the recent bias in the group towards the US.
Given his Yorkshire roots City analysts would not be surprised to see a
Hanson bid for Yorkshire Electricity.
News of the bumper first quarter profits pushed Hanson shares up 1p to
243[1/2]p where they provide a useful 6% yield and sell at about 12.3
times prospective earnings, making them attractive.

THE RECOVERY element in the revival in BP's fortunes since the time of
the boardroom row which led to the ousting of Bob Horton in 1992 has now
nearly run its course and the group will find it tougher to achieve the
testing targets it continues to set itself.
Net income last year jumped from #896m to #1515m on the replacement
cost basis which excludes stock movements. Excluding exceptionals this
leaves earnings up from #1125m to #1482m. The rate of quarterly
dividends is raised by a fifth to 3p which still leaves them 8% below
the peak payments seen in 1991.
The results are a fitting swansong for David Simon's tenure as chief
executive, though many of his policies were set in train by Mr Horton.
Mr Simon will become chairman in July and be succeeded as chief
executive by the exploration head, John Browne.
Mr Simon declared yesterday that the targets set in 1992 had been
achieved ahead of plan. These called for profits of $2000m by 1995, the
reduction of debt at the rate of $1000m annually and the limitation of
capital spending to $5000m, though under $4000m was actually spent last
year.
The spending cap plus strong operating cash flow and disposals brought
the 1994 debt reduction to almost $2000m. Borrowings have come down by
$6000m since 1992 and stands at $10.5 billion (#6700m).
Now the capital spending restriction has been eased, though BP intends
to retain a disciplined approach which acknowledges a low-inflationary
world.
Growth options the group is looking at include, on the exploration and
prouction side, getting more from mature sectors, doing more in emerging
areas and exploiting gas opportunities; in the downstream refining and
marketing segment it wants to expand in eastern Europe, develop a retail
operation in Asia Pacific and invest in refineries in Singapore and
Australia; in chemicals it is looking at polyethylene technology and
''debottlenecking'' and at investing in China.
BP is not expecting much help from oil prices this year. They were
higher in the second half of 1994 at $16.63 compared with the depressed
first half and were supported in late November by the roll-over for a
full year of OPEC's existing production ceiling. BP believes sentiment
for future prices remains reasonably balanced, with increases in demand
likely to be balanced by higher production.
The group itself sees its oil output rising by some 2% a year and gas
by 6%. Fields in Columbia and Australia will come on stream later this
year and will be followed by the Harding, Andrew and the deep water
Foinaven fields in the UK plus the Mars field in the Gulf of Mexico.
Expected output increases are being matched by rising reserves so are
sustainable into the longer term.
Much progress has been made in reducing production costs and the
division achieved the best level of operating profits in the foruth
quarter since the same period in 1990 when oil prices were higher during
the Gulf crisis. The year's operating profits were still slightly lower
at #1878m.
Refining and marketing were also lower at #706m as a result of a
decline in worldwide margins that was aggravated by mild winter weather
and disruptions arising from the introduction of reformulated petrol in
the US. No respite from the margin pressure is envisaged in the current
quarter owing to high heating oil stocks, a low level of planned
maintenance shutdowns in Europe and the US east coast and new capacity
in the Far East. Mild weather is remaining a feature.
Chemicals is another matter, seeing a sharp recovery in 1994 from
losses of #68m to profits of #252m, the best result for six years. The
cycle has picked up strongly, with volumes and margins moving ahead
smartly, and this is expected to continue.
BP is proud that its return on capital employed is now top of the oil
majors' league table, though this is as much to do with a decline in
competitors' returns as a recovery in BP's. Still it shows BP was
capable of improvement in a tough climate.
The drive for performance does not stop here but is now supposed to
have infused the culture of the group. The new targets call for earnings
of $3000m by 1996 (#1930m) -- so long as oil prices don't dip below $16
-- with debt down from $10.8 billion to $8000m.
Dividends for 1995 should sail past the 1991 level, with growth of up
to 20% likely in coming years. However the shares, down 7p at 419p, have
discounted much of the good news to come and are no more than a strong
hold, though analysts have scaled up their 1995 forecasts a little
following the latest figures.

CHILDISHLY fascinated by the difference between life and television,
we took ourselves along to the Scotsman's Great Debate the other night
(that was us at the back, waving to our ma) and had a quite immoderate
amount of fun. If nothing else, the resemblance between debate in the
Auntie's Second Cousin of Parliaments and pit bulls at play suggested
that home rule will provide the best free show in Edinburgh.
Watching BBC Scotland's televised account of the affair, however, we
couldn't help but think something was missing. No, not George tearing
stripes off Alex, nor Alex knocking lumps out of George. No, not the
three elegant Scottish journalists who had flown up from London to ask
the questions. Ah yes, got it: where was Jack McConnell, Scottish party
secretary?
The Diary was not alone on the night in thinking that Mr McConnell's
face was a picture, which is to say that if he had been standing up it
would have been tripping him. This was odd, given that once the debate
had been concluded the Labour man -- ''spinning'', in the parlance --
was telling the press how very well the bout had gone for his boy.
We can only note that Labour has subsequently complained, more than
testily, that the whole thing went on far longer than agreed.
Politicians given too much time to speak? Whatever next?
Claws are out
LABOUR will have plenty to talk about next month when they haul
themselves off to Inverness for their conference. Not least among the
topics will be the never-knowingly-undersold Clause 4, and the
leadership's heroic crusade to steer a recalcitrant membership towards a
bright new dawn, with a chicken in every pot and a nanny in every
maisonette.
When the conference agenda was unveiled last December, the assembled
press couldn't help but note that it contained no fewer than 26 motions
in favour of the clause and a grand total of none against. This prompted
one correspondent to observe that, composited, these prose masterpieces
would resemble War and Peace. Yes, agreed Jack (the very same)
McConnell, ''and a lot more bloody''.
Happily, the party, not yet convinced that there ain't no sanity
clause, has since attracted 14 further motions referring to reform. In
the way of such things, this led magically to weekend coverage alleging
that resistance to change was ''softening'', with the Press Association
leading the charge.
Intriguingly, its Saturday afternoon report concluded with the
information that ''one possible form of words has been devised by Labour
MP Brian Cunningham''. Presumably this was a reference to the MP for
Wilson, and no relation whatever to Mr George 40% of blessed memory.
That crowns it for Frankie
ON the face of it, a very good deal, and we're sure the Edinburgh
Evening News meant well. Only #15 for dinner and a Royal Lyceum show
(''saving you a massive #18'') in celebration of Valentine's Day? One
quibble: did the News really believe all those eager romantics out there
would be put in the right mood by a production entitled Bedroom Farce?
The Japanese, meanwhile, are better organised. This year in Tokyo
there was a marked decline in the giving of flowers and chocolates and
an upsurge in presents of a more practical nature. Top of the list,
according to the Nichii department store chain, was a #20,000 life
insurance policy valid in the event of a car wreck. Nothing whatever to
do, say observers, with the Kobe earthquake.
If you still want to join the most expensive game in town, however, we
hear that Phillips the auctioneers expect up to #300 to be paid today
for a set of four heart-shaped Wade ''heart-throb'' dishes depicting 50s
singers of the calibre of Cliff Richard, Marty Wilde, Tommy Steele, and
Frankie Vaughan. A spokeswoman notes: ''It is rare to find a full set as
Frankie Vaughan was not a popular choice.''
Not popular? You mean Tommy Steele was?
One for the book
WE hear, from the usual sources, of an eight-year-old whose
hard-pressed mother decided he could stand a little information on
reproductive matters. A visit to the local library was duly arranged,
and a volume on the manufacturing of babies duly produced.
The book was scanned briefly, and with some disdain, before being
returned to the shelf. ''Not enough sex in it,'' pronounced Edinburgh's
answer to Alex Comfort.
Naked truth?
FRANKLY, we don't much care if Oscars go to Forrest Fiction or Pulp
Gump. Much more entertaining in our book were the nominations for the
15th Annual Golden Raspberry Awards, each worth a princely $1.97,
announced in Los Angeles on Monday.
All the usual solid-oak suspects are rounded up: Macaulay Culkin
(three convictions); Bruce Willis (two); Elizabeth Taylor (for crimes
against the Flintstones); Kevin Costner (for crimes against credulity).
Heart-warmingly, however, the judges also selected the wretched O J
Simpson for his performance in one or other of the laugh-a-minute Naked
Gun movies. John Wilson, president of the awards foundation, said: ''For
O J, this could work to his benefit in his defence. We are saying he's
not an actor.''
Guy foxed
IT'S entirely possible you missed it, but Guy Delage has been swimming
the Atlantic. Yes, all of it. Powering away since December 16 at the
rate of 1.8 miles an hour, Guy has for some reason been dubbed ''the Mad
Swimmer'' by Le Monde. Nevertheless, despite sneers, jeers, and the
seven-foot shark recently ''browsing'' around his legs, he appears to
have made it.
Ironically enough, M Delage earns his living as a flying instructor,
but this seems not to have provided a clue to the mistake he might have
been making. Cynics have meanwhile pointed out that he wasn't actually
swimming all the time, since he returned to his raft in between dips,
but there's no pleasing some people.
Nevertheless, few can doubt that Guy, French to the core even in
mid-Atlantic, has suffered. On New Year's Eve, storm-tossed and far from
home, he opened a gift from his sponsors. Half a bottle of champagne,
foie gras with truffles, cassoulet, almond candy, marrons glace: they
had thought of everything.
Everything, that is, save a tin-opener.

THE Republicans took over Congress six weeks ago and are still piling
on the heat. Their latest initiative, item seven out of the 10 on their
''Contract with America'', is to force major changes in foreign and
defence policies. Item one has been passed into law, items two and three
have been sent up to the Senate and committees are working away on the
others.
These are all proposals that the new Speaker, Newt Gingrich, has
promised to bring up within 100 days. Things have slipped a bit, but not
too much. The Democrats are still in disarray and the President has yet
to figure out how to respond to the electoral disaster of last November.
Great things are possible.
But not certain. One of the first major legislative victories was
getting the proposed balanced budget amendment through the House. It
would amend the Constitution to provide that the federal government must
balance its budget every year. It is now in serious trouble in the
Senate, for two reasons.
The first is the obstructionism of Democratic senators, led by Robert
Byrd of West Virginia, who are conducting a slow-motion filibuster. That
might be enough to defeat the amendment.
The second problem is even more serious. The Democrats arguing against
the Bill said that it was a sham and a fraud to promise to balance the
budget by 2002 without telling taxpayers just how it was to be done.
The argument failed in the House but carries much greater weight in
the Senate. Worse still, a second and related Democratic argument, over
Social Security, has now penetrated the Republicans' armour.
Democrats offered amendment to the Bill excluding Social Security from
its provisions. Their version would insist that nothing should be done
to reduce promised pension benefits, or to tamper with the Social
Security trust fund.
Republicans successfully resisted the arguments in the House, but in
the Senate are being forced to admit that the budget cannot be balanced
in seven years if $700 billion a year of revenue is to be treated as
sacrosanct.
Meanwhile, the Republican tax and budgetary experts are facing the
underlying dilemma. How can they balance the budget? The President
submitted his own budget to Congress recently, a blatantly political
document (and what's wrong with that?) that made no effort to reduce the
deficit any time soon. The message was simple: Mr Clinton says he can
cut taxes; the Republicans have promised to cut taxes and balance the
budget at the same time.
This is the problem they cannot escape. In the Bush-Reagan years, they
could always indulge their penchant for promising tax cuts and a
balanced budget, in the knowledge that the Democrats were in charge of
Congress and would decide the matter -- or be blamed for it.
In the end, they were blamed for high taxes and huge deficits so
roundly that they lost the 1994 election. Now the Republicans have no
excuse. They are in charge, they have made a fetish out of these twin
promises, and they are expected to deliver. They say that Mr Clinton's
budget was DOA (dead on arrival), which means that they must produce an
alternative.
The House side insists that it can produce the tax cuts they promised
in their contract, and make a start towards balancing the budget. Their
most fervent spokesmen insist that it can be done, easily, by cutting
the growth of government spending for the next few years.
Just let spending rise by one or two percentage points less than
revenues rise, thanks to increasing national income. This was the
supply-side theory espoused fervently by Ronald Reagan. It didn't work
in the go-go eighties, and sceptics doubt that it will work any better
now.
Newt Gingrich is showing no sign of worry. He ploughs ahead, giving
televised press conferences every morning (one of these days he is going
to say something really stupid, on camera, and at last learn to keep his
mouth shut). Bob Dole, in the Senate, is preparing for a last run at the
White House.
That, too, will complicate the Republican programme. Mr Dole and his
various rivals, notably Senator Phil Gramm, are not going to encourage
radical cuts in spending just when they are presenting themselves to the
electorate -- but all those Republicans who won election to the House
last year are desperate to have something to show for it in 1996.
They remember what happened to the large class of new Democrats, who
entered Congress after the 1992 election, promising great things. They
failed -- and most of them lost their seats two years later.

Johannesburg, Tuesday
NELSON MANDELA'S estranged wife Winnie has stepped back from the
political brink with an apology for criticising South Africa's
government of national unity.
President Mandela's office said today that Mrs Mandela had submitted a
second letter last night apologising for a speech she made two weeks ago
in which she accused the government of paying more attention to
appeasing whites than helping blacks.
Government sources said Mandela had found unacceptable his wife's
carefully-worded first letter in which she regretted embarrassing the
government, but stopped short of an apology.
Political observers said the apology had probably settled one of the
rows in which Mrs Mandela, 61, is embroiled.
However, she still faces questions over aid money from Pakistan and a
revolt by executive members of the African National Congress Women's
League, who said they could no longer tolerate her dictatorial manner as
chairwoman.
Government sources said the president had been angered by Mrs
Mandela's attack on his administration and was prepared to sack her as
Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, and Technology if she did not
apologise in full.
In the second letter, released by Mandela's office, she said: ''I
would like to apologise most sincerely for the impression the speech
caused that I sought to condemn the government of national unity.
''I sincerely regret any embarrassment that the speech might have
caused the president and government as a whole and therefore accept this
censure which the delivery of the speech at the funeral
occasioned.''--Reuter.

Bonn, Tuesday
PRIME Minister John Major, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and French
President Francois Mitterrand plan to attend celebrations in London,
Paris, and Berlin to mark the 50th anniversary of V-E Day in May.
German officials said today that civilian ceremonies would be designed
to stress hopes for peace.
''The emphasis will definitely be on peace and the character will be
civilian, not military,'' one said.
The itinerary includes London on May 6 and 7, and both Paris and
Berlin on May 8. It may add Moscow on May 9 if Russia's war in Chechnya
has been settled by then, officials said.
Kohl has been pressing his partners to mark V-E Day -- when the Nazi
Third Reich surrendered on May 8 1945 -- with a celebration of present
and future co-operation among the former enemies rather than with brass
bands and military parades.
It is not yet clear if President Clinton, with whom Kohl discussed the
plans during a visit to Washington last week, would attend himself or
send Vice President Al Gore.
Mitterrand, who has cancer and will step down in May after 14 years as
president, will use the occasions to launch a personal appeal for world
peace, the officials said.
If all goes according to plan the events will in effect be
choreographed by Kohl, who was left out of the D-Day memorial last year.
The VE-Day ceremonies will crown five months of war anniversaries
ranging from the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp in January to
the final fall of the Reich in May.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
BOSNIAN Serbs today reneged on a promise to let food reach hungry
Muslims while a UN official said international efforts to help were
''gutless''.
The Bosnian Serb Army refused to allow a convoy of food to enter the
Bihac enclave where the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said some of
the 150,000 Muslims had ''little more than scraps left to eat''.
UNHCR official Ron Redmond said in Geneva that hundreds and possibly
thousands of people could die and added: ''We don't know of anyone who
has starved to death yet, but it is certainly possible in the very near
future if this continues.''
UN spokesman Graham Day said many people were seriously malnourished
and he described the international aid effort to relieve Bihac as
''gutless'', with the UN refusing to challenge the Serb blockade and at
the same time supplying food to the Serbs who are helping to enforce it.
''In blocking convoys the Serbs are engaged in a deliberate policy to
turn Bihac into a big ghetto,'' said Day.
Bihac is receiving about one-tenth of the food its needs, and the
Srebrenica and Gorazde enclaves in eastern Bosnia, about one-third.
Redmond said the UN and Nato refused requests to drop food to the
Muslims by air because of the danger to transport planes from Serb
anti-aircraft missiles.
Fighting between Muslims and Serbs has continued around Bihac despite
a four-month ceasefire elsewhere in Bosnia since New Year's Day.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told the UN yesterday that his
army would renounce the truce and attack Serbs across Bosnia unless the
Bihac crisis stabilised.
Meanwhile Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic warned today he would
not sign any more ceasefires with the Muslims if mediators failed to
produce a complete Bosnian peace settlement by May 1.
The Bosnian Serb news agency quoted him as saying his army would meet
Muslim attacks with counter-offensives ''until the international
community offers a final and guaranteed settlement of the conflict''.
Karadzic spoke in the north Bosnian town of Banja Luka after the final
rejection of a Big Power peace plan by the parliament of his
self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb Republic.
A four-month ceasefire intended to provide a breathing space for talks
about the now-ditched peace plan expires at the end of April.
Karadzic said it would be the last such truce before what he called a
final victory for the Bosnian Serbs ''unless the international community
comes up with a solution acceptable to all three sides by May 1''.
Karadzic said the Serbs wanted Bosnia broken up to give them a
separate, independent state guaranteed by the international community.
Bosnia's Muslim-led government is equally dedicated to a settlement
that protects the republic's territorial integrity.--Reuter.

Moscow, Tuesday
RUSSIAN and Chechen fighters today ignored what is supposed to be a
ceasefire to blast one another with rockets and shellfire around the
battered capital Grozny.
The truce agreed only yesterday banned heavy weapons such as jet
bombers, artillery, and missiles, which have been responsible for most
of the destruction and huge loss of life in more than two months of war.
However today's new flare-up cast a shadow over the chances of a
lasting peace being negotiated by commanders on both sides.
Interfax said the next round of Russian-Chechen talks was due to take
place tomorrow between Anatoly Kulikov, who commands Russia's Interior
Ministry troops and Moscow's operation in the rebel region, and Aslan
Maskhadov, the head of the Chechen general staff.
As the big guns boomed again over Grozny, Russia's
counter-intelligence chief insisted the hunt was still on for breakaway
leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, a former Soviet air force general who led the
North Caucasus territory's drive for independence.
Moscow has issued an arrest warrant for him, but Sergei Stepashin said
he was constantly on the move and was not using radio communication,
making detection difficult.
Stepashin also cast doubt on the range of the truce. ''The accord . .
. is unlikely to lead to a full-scale ceasefire in this North Caucasus
republic,'' he said, adding that he expected Dudayev's rebels to use the
ceasefire to regroup.
Further dashing truce hopes, Russian General Lev Rokhlin claimed:
''There is no doubt that a certain group of Chechen militants will not
observe any agreements.''
The Interior Ministry said reconnaissance planes and artillery had
been used around towns east of Grozny in the past 24 hours.
''Artillery gave support to fighting forces and suppressed firing
positions of the illegal armed groups,'' it said.
The Ministry said six more Russian soldiers had been killed and 25
wounded in the past 24 hours.--Reuter.

Faces of Scotland: veteran photographer Lida Moser, back in this
country for the first time since 1949 when she was on assignment for
Vogue magazine, talks to KEITH BRUCE about the portraits she took
THE 17 faces that grace one room of the Scottish National Portrait
Gallery pose an interesting question. Wrapped up, as we so often are, in
the place and weight of our national culture, could Scotland muster such
an esteemed collection of artists 45 years on?
The exhibition is the first showing of what veteran photographer Lida
Moser describes as ''my Scottish take'', the fruits of her first
assignment for American Vogue magazine in 1949. Accompanied by text from
the pen of Eric Linklater, the portraits appeared in the May 1950 issue
-- an eight-page spread of work, the very existence of which defines the
place that Scotland occupied internationally at that time.
Writing her own gloss on the photographs in the magazine, Moser, a
native New Yorker then 29 years old, defines the Scottish character as
''cultivation without the deadening of the simple human emotions, and
the ability to cull enjoyment from any situation without condescending
to scoffing or kowtowing''.
The portraits include Linklater and other writers like Neil Gunn and
James Bridie and artists such as William Gillies, Benno Schotz, J D
Fergusson and Anne Redpath, the only woman in the show. The gallery has
acquired a collection of 400 of Moser's negatives, and the National
Portrait Gallery has purchased all of her work in London four years
later. (An intriguing battle lies ahead over ownership of Compton
Mackenzie -- the writer's portrait has ended up in London.)
In a world that included many fewer magazines than pack the
news-stands today, Vogue features editor Allene Talmey's decision to
fund Moser's month in Edinburgh and Glasgow speaks loudly of the regard
in which Scottish art was then held. The Edinburgh Festival, begun two
years earlier, had clearly already made its mark.
Linklater's article attempts to explain the ''Scottish Renaissance''
with reference to ''the aggressive temper of its people, and the fact
that human energy has traditionally been used to balance material
deficiency''.
He writes: ''Scotland is naturally inclined to over-rate the
importance of its own achievements; but history is on its side when it
sees in people, and not in material advantage, the source or foundation
of further achievement.''
Moser is a feisty Jewish lady who empathised with the Scottish
temperament Linklater identified. Now retired, but still armed with a
Nikon compact she uses to shoot everyone in sight, she apologises for
being ''so obnoxious'', when she has been nothing but politeness itself.
The Herald photographer's only cavil was that she took more pictures
of him than he did of her, and she managed to punctuate our chat with
remarks like ''That is a very perceptive question'' without sounding in
the least patronising. I came away with her address and an introduction
to someone I have to meet in Quebec. And a fervent wish that I'd known
her when she was 29 -- it was not hard to see what had charmed her
collection of Scotsmen.
She has vivid memories of her nine-day journey across the Atlantic in
a converted troop carrier. In the company of a bunch of other young
women she took to sunbathing naked on top of the gun turrets, which must
have been a treat for the crew. Journalism was clearly a different game
in those days: she had no deadline beyond the instruction to bring back
''a six-page spread and stock pictures for the next five years''.
She'd worked for the Signal Corps during the war and came into contact
with some Hollywood people who were making a film of the service.
Smitten, she took a job in the film and photography section in the
museum of modern art and asked everyone who came in if they knew any
millionaires until someone gave her a number.
The chap she phoned -- he's still alive so she won't reveal his name
-- found her sufficiently interesting to fund her ambitions. She claims
he took her on because she was the only person to approach him who was
honest enough to admit that it was because he was a millionaire, but
there is a hint that the relationship was not quite that simple. After
six months she quit (''His reality and my reality were totally
different'') and her photography career began in earnest, as assistant
to Berenice Abbott, just two years before she secured the Vogue
commission.
She followed up the Scottish portraits a year later with a similar
reportage in Quebec, published in book form in 1988. ''Artists and
writers convey the soul and essence of a country,'' she said. There is
now talk of a Scottish book combining the photographs and text by art
critic W Gordon Smith, who curated the Portrait Gallery exhibition.
The images certainly deserve the widest audience. Some -- like the one
of Linklater -- have few serious rivals as a record of how the man
looked. The lady herself is proud of her work, but not naturally
inclined to over-rate the importance of her achievements. ''I open the
lens and let life come in and pray it will imprint itself on the
negative.''
Now living in Northampton, Massachusetts, she regrets the move. Since
she left New York, she reckons she's ''lost her edge''. She moved 18
times between 1950 and 1989: ''If I'd wanted to make money I'd have gone
into real estate -- and don't think I didn't consider it.''
* Class of '49 is at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery to March
5.

Michael Tumelty catches up with Dave Heath, the composer and flautist
who never seems to pause for breath
SO WHERE do you start with Dave Heath? Top session musician, the flute
behind many a TV theme tune and advertising jingle, rock producer, folk
and jazz fanatic, flautist with Sting, composer of concertos for
Britain's three superstar soloists, Nigel Kennedy, James Galway, and
Evelyn Glennie?
The present is as good a place as any. But even there a bewildering
diversity of enthusiasms and activities surrounds Dave Heath. Coming to
an interview fresh from recording a television jingle for a nappy advert
while in the middle of composing a concerto for percussionist Evelyn
Glennie and planning an orchestral venture with folk musician Phil
Cunningham . . . the man leaves you breathless.
Immediately around the corner, however, lie the first performances of
his new violin concerto, The Celtic, written for Clio Gould and the BT
Scottish Ensemble, of which Heath is the resident composer. After its
premiere next Sunday in Perth, the concerto goes on tour throughout
Scotland, dipping into England for a performance in Bishop Auckland.
The concerto, in which Heath says he is not pushing forward any
boundaries, is specifically written to showcase ''the great purity and
fantastic accuracy'' of Clio Gould's playing. In three movements,
including a ceilidh and a lament, The Celtic reflects the increasing
influence on the composer of modern and traditional Scottish folk music.
Heath, a burly Mancunian in his late thirties -- looks like a hard
case, in fact extremely amiable -- has a zest for life and for
accessible music. He started out on the straight and narrow: public
school, took up the flute, and thought he was set for life. ''I was
very, very straight and classical; by 14 I had a baroque flute and it
was all I wanted to do.''
Then came sin: jazz. The father of a girlfriend gave him a Miles Davis
album (Kind of Blue). Initially he hated it. ''I thought it was
terrible, all those notes Miles used to split; I just couldn't get it.''
After a few months it clicked and he became a fanatic.
He formed his own jazz band and became a bad boy. He won't be
specific, other than suggesting his behaviour was modelled on Malcolm
McDowell's public school terrorist in the film If, but he confesses he
was thrown out of school after various feats of anarchy.
His head teacher was obviously ambivalent about the talented hoodlum.
In public he would bawl Heath out for his multiple misdemeanours, while
privately discussing music with him and giving him flute concertos to
play.
Anyway; on to London, the Guildhall School of Music, and the
continuing growth of eclecticism: classical playing by day, jazz in pubs
by night. At 21 he was playing flute in the Halle Orchestra and he had
written his first composition, Out of the Cool, jazz-influenced ''and
sounding like written-down Herbie Hancock''.
At a party he met Nigel Kennedy who liked the composition, took it up,
and drew the attention of others to Heath. This led to a full-scale work
for Kennedy, Alone at the Frontier, for orchestra, rap choir, and Nige
on electric violin.
A flute concerto for his ''absolute hero'' James Galway and the
Philharmonia Orchestra, left Heath ''completely phased''. He
over-reacted to the presence of the big wee Irishman and wrote a
45-minute piece. ''I tried to do too much and I should have been a bit
more cool about it.'' Subsequently Heath cut the piece by 20 minutes, to
his and Galway's satisfaction.
Meanwhile, the Heath career had developed other limbs. Through the
cellist in Siouxsie and the Banshees he got into rock production. A
working relationship with guitarist Dominic Miller led to recordings
with Sting. Regular session work -- performing a range of TV theme music
from Morse to Cold Comfort Farm, and the film music of such luminaries
as Michael Kamen -- has led to Heath being, for numerous London agents,
a first-call flautist.
His appetite for music is voracious. When he moved to Scotland to
become resident composer for the BT Scottish Ensemble, he dived into
Scottish music and was bowled over by Aly Bain, Capercaillie, and
Wolfstone. (He was also ubiquitous at concerts of new Scottish classical
music, devouring the latest compositions by James MacMillan and others.)
He's equally enthusiastic about the great German quasi-mystic,
Karlheinz Stockhausen, who's so far out he's on his own planet, and with
whom Heath's wife, the singer Angela Tunstall, is currently working.
On another planet altogether, a crossover project is being mooted with
folk musician Phil Cunningham who will provide musical material that
Dave Heath will orchestrate. At an arranged meeting between the two
musicians in a concert hall, both ran up against genre preconceptions.
They didn't know what each other looked like. ''I was busy looking for a
folkie type,'' said Heath. ''I thought he'd wear a woolly jumper and
smoke a pipe.
''And Phil was trying to imagine what a composer would look like; he
expected to see a sensitive type, not someone who looked as though he'd
just come from strangling both his parents.''
At the moment Heath is based down south, completing a new concerto for
Evelyn Glennie and the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland that will be
premiered in the summer. This concerto (in two parts entitled African
Sunrise and Manhattan Rave) will feature Glennie on marimba and drum
kit. Its course was determined by Glennie laying into a drum kit and
telling Heath: ''I'm really a rock chick at heart.''
Heath, who will also feature as flautist with the BT Scottish Ensemble
in Bach's Fifth Brandenburg Concerto next week, is itching to move
permanently to Scotland. He lived for a year at Collessie in Fife and is
unequivocal about his desire to return. ''If I could make a living in
Scotland'' -- he has three young mouths to feed -- ''I'd give up the
session work and move up there.''
Expect the big man's presence to be felt next week.
* BT Scottish Ensemble dates: Sunday 19, St John's Kirk, Perth; Monday
20, Cowdray Hall, Aberdeen; Tuesday 21, Bonar Hall, Dundee; Thursday 23,
Queen's Hall, Edinburgh; Friday 24, RSAMD, Glasgow.
* Dave Heath and the BT Scottish Ensemble will feature in the BBC
Education series, Mad about Music, for broadcast on March 6 and 9.

while fellow justices look on. In an act formally ending the system of
apartheid justice, the racially mixed court of 11 judges was sworn in
yesterday to interpret the country's new constitution and to strike down
any laws that transgress it.
President Nelson Mandela opened the court and said: 'The last time I
appeared in court was to hear whether or not I was going to be sentenced
to death. Fortunately for myself and my colleagues, we were not.' He

Cape Town, Tuesday
SOUTH African whites today used chains, whips, and snarling dogs to
terrorise black children at a previously white school.
As armed police escorted the youngsters from the fenced school grounds
to buses at the end of the day, one resident warned: ''Tonight we're
coming to burn down this school. We don't want these dirty kaffirs
here.''
Kaffirs is a derogatory term for blacks and is now outlawed in South
Africa.
About 100 men and women, most armed with chains, whips, and sticks,
shouted abuse while their Rottweiler and Alsatian dogs barked viciously
at the children behind the school fence.
The 3000 black pupils occupied the school in the working class
Ruyterwacht suburb of Cape Town a week ago after they were turned away
from overcrowded township schools about nine miles away at the beginning
of the new school year.
Scores of previously whites-only schools have closed because there are
not enough white children to fill them, but the country faces a massive
shortage of classrooms and facilities in the townships to which blacks
were confined in the days of apartheid.
The former white government began to relax school segregation in 1989,
but the last vestiges of classroom apartheid were lifted in January when
segregation was outlawed.
Black children have moved into many mainly white schools since
President Nelson Mandela won the first all-race elections last April.
Others have taken over abandoned school buildings.
Male nurse Wentzel Veldtsman said he was not a racist, but added: ''We
don't want these blacks here.''
Pieter Labuschagne claimed: ''They're urinating in public, they're
having intercourse right in front of us in the school yard. They're
animals, the place looks like a pigsty.''
Ursula Fourie said she did not want any blacks in her suburb because
they had killed her husband last year. ''Now they're going to kill us
and I will not allow it a second time.''
Asked why children would want to kill her, she said: ''Because they
hate us.''
Pupil Nicholas Booi said he was both sad and angry about the threats,
saying: ''They must think we are very, very bad.
''We have voted and, in a way, they must make us feel happy in their
areas,'' he said. ''We're not here to disturb them. We only want an
education''
Zukiswa Vumenjani said she was angry because the residents were
wasting valuable teaching time.
''And we didn't do all these things they say like urinating and all
that. We wanted to be friendly with them,'' she said.--Reuter.

Washington, Tuesday
THE FBI has issued a secret warning to private and public security
forces in New York that Islamic terrorists may be planning another
attack there, on the second anniversary of the World Trade Centre
bombing.
A group of 11 Muslims, most of them Arab, are on trial in the city
now, charged with a plot to blow up two tunnels under the Hudson, the UN
building, and police headquarters simultaneously on July 4, 1993.
They are also charged with a variety of other conspiracies, including
a plot to murder President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, and of complicity in
the WTC bombing.
The chief defendant is Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, a blind cleric from
Cairo. The man who is believed to have organised the WTC attack, planned
to kill the Pope in Manila last month, and to have placed bombs on
American planes in Asia, was arrested in Pakistan last week and brought
to New York.
Police success in arresting these two groups of alleged terrorists
(the men who carried out the WTC bombing were caught and convicted) does
not mean that the FBI has broken the back of Islamic terrorism.
Newsday, a New York newspaper, reports today that the FBI had received
''uncomfortably credible reports'' of a plot afoot to blow up the New
York Stock Exchange and other buildings.
The bureau then issued its warning, calling on security services to
show ''a heightened sense of awareness'', particularly in the run-up to
February 23, the anniversary of the WTC bombing.
In a related development, prosecutors have prepared a list of 172
people ''who may be alleged as co-conspirators'' in the Sheikh Omar
trial. Among them are members of the Sudanese mission to the UN. Police
believe that they had agreed to allow a van loaded with explosives into
the parking garage under the UN building.
That was the modus operandi of the WTC bombers. They could not get
into the UN garage without assistance. Several of those charged with the
two conspiracies are Sudanese, or have lived there.

LOS ANGELES: The O J Simpson double murder trial was told yesterday
that the first officer on the scene found a candle-lit bathroom, soft
music, and a container of melting ice cream in Nicole Brown Simpson's
townhouse.
Officer Robert Riske, who went into the house at about 12.30am, found
a container of ice cream on a stairway banister. The ice cream was still
melting.
Simpson's defence lawyers are trying to convince the jury that the
former football star did not have time to commit the murders and still
take a limousine to the airport at 11pm for an overnight flight to
Chicago.
They have argued that the murders must have occurred later than
10.15pm as the ice cream was still melting.
Simpson, whose trial continues, denies murdering his ex-wife and her
friend Ronald Goldman.--Reuter.

IT is not often we can look to a Chancellor of the Exchequer for
guidance on the finer points of Scottish history. Kenneth Clarke's big
speech last week was billed as a definitive contribution to the
Government's internal debate over Europe, though a lot of people found
it hard to understand why. But Scots with long memories and a cherished
desire to see old scores settled had every reason to be satisfied.
''There are even examples of political union without monetary union.
Scotland retained its own currency in some form for over 200 years after
James VI of Scotland became James I of England,'' the Chancellor said.
He was, after a century and a half, giving away an official secret. I
have always wondered why, in 1845, Sir Robert Peel was so determined to
kill off the old Scottish banking system, to stifle one of the most
dynamic forces in the northern kingdom and replace it with the
fossilised cartel that till very recently we still had. Apart from the
thought that all governments want to fossilise the Scottish economy,
there seemed no explanation. But now we know the Treasury view: Scotland
had a separate currency, and this would never do.
It had not struck me, though it ought to have done, that the
Treasury's memory was long too, and that it stretched back not just to
1845 but to 1707. Article XVI of the Treaty of Union abolished the
Scottish pound, then standing at 12 to the English pound. But Scots only
pretended to accept this. For a long time afterwards they still counted
out their money as they always had done -- which is why, incidentally
the Gaelic for a penny is to this day sgilinn, because in 1707 one Scots
shilling was worth one new English penny.
More to the point, the young United Kingdom had not so much a common
currency as what we would now call irrevocably fixed exchange rates. You
would have seen this on crossing the Border at any time up to 1845. On
the southern side money was essentially gold, in the shape of the
sovereign. On the northern side money was notes, issued then as now by
the Scottish banks.
While Scotland had still been a poor country, there was not much gold
about. When there was, it tended to leave quickly in order to pay for
imports, since foreigners -- some things never change -- would not
accept Scottish notes.
So Scots had had to invent their own currency. They might have taken
that as a licence to print money, but they were not such fools as modern
politicians. Instead, the canny bankers set up a more or less foolproof
anti-inflationary mechanism. In the ordinary course of their business,
they accumulated notes from the other banks, paid in by their customers.
Every week in Edinburgh they simply exchanged these notes for their own.
At that point it became clear if any bank was over-issuing, because it
would have a balance which could not be exchanged. That kept everybody
in line. Those that stepped out of line soon also went out of business.
Strangely, this charming custom produced over time a system actually
sounder than the English one, founded though that was, not on flimsy
paper, but on the rock of gold. Perhaps the key lay in the fact that the
Scots had no spendthrift government to bankroll. When, during the
Napoleonic Wars, financial pressure forced England off the gold
standard, Scottish notes rose to a premium over the English pound. Karl
Marx, no less, observed in 1859 that: ''Scotland never experienced a
real monetary crisis.''
By this time the system was swept away, yet it remains of more than
academic interest. The debate over a common European currency is in
certain quarters almost theological, couched in terms of high and
abstruse theory which -- for example, to Professor Tim Congdon, one of
the Government's seven wise men -- proves that political and monetary
union are better than theory, and the Scottish facts, so far as they go,
support Mr Clarke's retort that the two can be held distinct, in concept
and in execution. The retort is to the taste neither of the Europhobes,
who want British sovereignty, including monetary sovereignty, preserved
intact, nor of the Europhiles, who want to use a common currency to
force political unification.
One thing that Scottish history certainly confirms is the virtue of
keeping the currency out of the hands of the government, which is ever
tempted to debauch it. The old system in Scotland was a private system,
where the self-interest of individuals maintained the value of money,
and perhaps the times are past when anything like it could be restored.
A European currency might, though, be a second best; the other day Tony
Benn hit the nail a little askew but still on the head when he damned it
as ''the ultimate privatisation'', which would deliver us all trussed
and gagged into the hands of bankers.
In that state, I would rather be in the hands of a banker than of a
Benn. The more apolitical that monetary union is, the better. The
separation of monetary power from political power is a safeguard for the
individual, in the same way as the separation of judicial power from
political power: it would defend us from abuse by our rulers. This is
not to say it should be pursued at all costs, for there certainly will
be costs.
One reason why Scotland accepted Peel's imposition in 1845 was that
she could live with the costs. She had gone from rags to riches, from
having a primitive economy to having one of the most advanced in the
world. But she had taken more than a century to get there, and it would
not surprise me if it took as long to get to European monetary union.
Scots had had to invent their own currency. They might have taken that
as a licence to print money, but they were not such fools as modern
politicians

<HEADLINE>EU tunes out French view of Hollywood</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bordeaux, Tuesday
FRANCE failed to rally European Union countries behind its call to
throw up a barrier against a flood of Hollywood television products.
Culture Minister Jacques Toubon vowed to fight on, however, calling
countries that disagreed with him either ''frivolous'' or ''utopian'',
predicting that they would eventually turn ''sober'' and ''realistic''
and join France's viewpoint.
''I put the simple question -- do you want Europe?'' he told a news
conference after an informal two-day meeting of EU Culture Ministers in
Bordeax.
Toubon said Europe needed a coherent cultural policy of both financial
support plans and regulation, including television broadcast quotas. He
found little support, however.
''Quotas are for fishery policies, not for culture,'' said a Danish
diplomat.
Earlier French Communications Minister Nicolas Sarkozy had said the
other 14 EU member states were agreed on the need for a European
strategy to defend its cultural values.
Sarkozy added that European Commissioner Marcelino Orteja would draw
up proposals for financial incentives to the fledgling multi-media
industry.
''Everybody agreed, I believe it was unanimous, on the necessity of
the definition of a European audiovisual policy,'' he told reporters.
France, however, found no support for its passionately-sought goal of
tightening a European Community rule, the 1989 Television without
Frontiers directive.
This would have made it compulsory for European broadcasters to air at
least 50% European programmes. At the moment this is optional although
all countries meet the quota.
Britain's Natural Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell prefers that the
quota either be scrapped or phased out.
German delegates argued that culture should first and foremost remain
the remit of national authorities.
''We don't have a European car, we don't have a European train, OK we
have an Airbus (European plane), but I don't see why there should be a
European film,'' commented Germany's junior Foreign Minister, Helmut
Schaefer.
In the end, the Ministers agreed they would revise the directive only
to make it more clear and include new media such as ''teleshopping'' and
pay-per-view services.
This new directive, a legal text, will not be ready before a formal
meeting of EU Culture Ministers in Luxembourg on April 3 and 4, but
France said it would if necessary call an extraordinary meeting in June
to decide on the new rule.
The Ministers did agree on a Commission plan to double to #320m the
amount of EU money available to help the community's film
industry.--Reuter.

STOPPING live exports of calves and lambs would lead to increased
pressure on the home market and sharp price falls for producers, the
Meat and Livestock Commission confirmed yesterday.
To combat this, the report, on future options for the industry
catalogues a series of actions to be taken by the industry and the
Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF).
These involve more intensive work in product quality improvement,
particularly eating quality; more promotional spending at home and
abroad, possibly including EU support; new product development; and
market development aided by the MAFF Market Tast Force.
The report presents two possible scenarios for beef and one for lamb
based on peak export figures in 1993.
For beef, the first scenario envisages calf exports being halved to
about 250,000 a year. This would increase UK beef supplies by some
64,000 tonnes and result in a 10% price cut to producers. A worse
possible scenario of a total cut in live calf exports would cut prices
by up to 20% and could require safety-net intervention buying.
Similarly for lamb, the MLC forecasts a 70% cut in the 1.9m lambs
exported live in 1993 would increase domestic production by 24,000
tonnes. Up to two thirds of this could be exported but there would be
substantial falls in home market prices, particularly in the autumn,
which would not be offset by additional new subsidies. The fall would be
particularly significant in the less favoured areas.
Unveiling the new report at a London news conference, Mr Bob Bansback,
MLC's industry development director, said that EU promotional support
for quality beef had boosted sales in this sector by 6% -- equivalent to
#170m -- in 1993/94. The industry would be looking for continuation and
even improvement on this scheme and, through MAFF, would also be looking
to establish a similar EU lamb promotion programme.
Mr Colin Maclean, MLC director general, said that in the medium term
the commission would be supporting the need for legislative changes in
Europe to ban veal crates and to improve and police livestock transport
conditions.
There had already been significant progress in welfare conditions in
veal producing countries and there was signs of compromise on transport
arrangements emerging across Europe, he said.
''It doesn't go all the way but the fact that research work is going
on in those countries shows that minds are not closed.''
The commission is to increase home market promotion spending by
#600,000 with export promotions increased by up to #200,000 in the new
marketing year.

A NEW Zealand ryegrass variety -- Yatsyn -- which was recently
introduced to the United Kingdom has been identified as a possible
source of illness in horses.
The Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research in Wales was
asked to investigate after reports of horses being unable to stand or
co-ordinate their bodily actions.
Scientist Graham Lewis, who undertook a feed analysis for the
institute said: ''All the horses had been fed on hay from one field,
sown with the New Zealand ryegrass, Yatsyn. This is a new variety on the
UK market but is long established in New Zealand where it has frequently
been associated with an endophytic fungal infection causing stagger
symptoms in sheep.''
Ryegrass endophyte was a fungus which existed within ryegrass plants,
Mr Lewis added. Although it was widely distributed in Europe it had gone
relatively unnoticed.

HEAVY provisions in the oil and gas division depressed profits at the
Kvaerner group, owners of the Govan shipyard.
Losses on Norway's Troll Oil project of #96.2m added to further
provisions for the restructuring of the division.
However, Kvaerner's other four main business areas -- shipbuilding,
mechanical engineering, pulping and shipping -- all moved ahead last
year.
Overall pre-tax profits for the Norwegian group, which has extensive
operations in the UK and a listing on the London market, slipped to
#117m from #126.8m in 1993.
The board proposes to increase the dividend by 5p to 58p per share.
Kvaerner is the UK's largest commercial shipbuilder, as well as having
companies in London, Aberdeen, Greenock, Doncaster, Northampton and
Slough.
Kvaerner has invested #30m at Govan to make it the world leader in the
construction of environment-friendly chemical carriers and has recently
launched the third in a series of 37,500 tonne carriers.
For the second consecutive year the yard reported modest profits after
30 years of losses. In 1988, when the shipyard was acquired by Kvaerner
its losses under the nationalised British shipbuilders were around #45m.
Kvaerner Govan currently has orders for another chemical carrier and
an LPH (Landing Platform for Helicopters) being built jointly with VSEL
and which will provide work at the yard until early 1996.
Apart from shipbuilding, UK operations include offshore and onshore
engineering, hydropower equipment, shipping equipment and computerised
industrial technology systems.
The group is to sell its gas carrier fleet valued at about #346m to
the Oslo-based Havtor shipping company.
A Kvaerner Govan built chemical carrier equipped with a double hull
for safety on its maiden voyage to Finland. The ship has 44 stainless
steel tanks and eight coated tanks

NEWS and financial information group Reuters is forecasting a slowdown
in underlying revenue growth and costs in 1995 after the high rate seen
last year.
Profits expanded by 16% from #440m to #510m before tax in 1994 on
turnover up 23% at #2309m. This, though, was towards the bottom end of
market forecasts which had ranged from #505m to #534m.
Operating margins edged down from 20.3% to 19.9%. A final dividend of
6.1p lifts the total from 6.5p to 8p, but the shares lost 8[1/2]p at
438[1/2]p on the revenue warning. The numbers are in line, but the
statement is slightly cautious, one analyst said.
The company benefited last year from strong growth in trading screens,
record sales of information products, and major acquisitions. Instinet
-- Reuters equity trading screen -- also had another exceptional year.
However, the company said that recent setbacks in financial markets
were likely to have some effect on clients' purchasing decisions this
year.
There has been some contraction in the securities industry, a notable
example being the closure of Warburg's Eurobond division. Other firms
have also cut back on operations and shed staff. Even so, the
information management systems business is said to have ''never been
better.''
Acquisitions last year included US software systems company Teknekron
and Quotron, a US market data service business. Both companies ''met the
expectations we had when we acquired them,'' said Reuters chief
executive Peter Job.
''We remain on target to achieve the goals we set for integrating
Quotron with our US equities business over a two-year period.''
Reuters also increased investment last year in new areas, such as the
health and business information markets, and in emerging markets,
Instinet, and databases for equities and fixed income markets.
Recent important deals for Reuters included plans to develop a
television news service in the US with Fox Television, the American film
and television group which is part of Rupert Murdoch's media empire,
and, earlier this month, another television news alliance, this time
with British Sky Broadcasting, also part of Murdoch's fiefdom.
Reuters revealed yesterday, in what looks to be a pre-emptive strike
in the present climate on executive salaries, that Mr Job received a 32%
increase in his basic salary, taking it to #400,000, excluding a
#200,000 bonus.
This followed a comparative review which supported the conclusion that
his salary was relatively low compared with a UK peer group of global
businesses. The company said the remuneration committee, made up of all
Reuters non-executive directors, also took account of the salaries of
overseas peer group companies.
Executive directors were put on two-year, instead of three-year,
contracts last year. The company's executive share option scheme has
also been abandoned and replaced with a grant of shares which are only
released in whole or in part if the group performs well over three years
against other FTSE 100 companies in generating shareholder value.

BRITISH Steel is spending #93m in buying the 38.1% GKN stake in UES
(United Engineering Steels) in a move which will give it complete
management control to exploit the full downtream capabilities of its
long products business based in Scunthorpe.
For over a year, there has been a hiatus at UES after GKN chairman,
Sir David Lees, indicated that his company wanted to sell out as it was
the junior partner.
A BS official said that there were no plans to change the
configuration of the plant at present and that UES would continue as a
free standing company.
It was hard hit by recession, but in 1994 it turned round to produce
profit of #18.2m on sales of #658m. It employs 6500 people.
Major customers are the car industry and general engineering where
there is a requirement for high quality steel, such as in aircraft and
stainless steel.
Some 40% of output is exported and of that 25% goes to Europe. UES has
a presence in Scotland through Scottish Stampings in Ayr.
So far this financial year to March, BS has spent #410m, largely on
acquisitions and operations such as the shipment of never used plant
from Hunterston to Florida at a cost of #65m.
At the BS interim stage, chairman Brian Moffat said that UES was not
as efficient as he would like it to be.
Although BS shares were little changed, down 1p at 152[1/2]p, GKN rose
6[1/2]p to 584p on relief that, while there will be a writedown off
#59.6m on the #153m book value of the investment, it will receive a cash
payment and remove a highly volatile element from its earnings profile.
UES was part of the Lazards sponsored Phoenix industries schemes
formed in 1986 to resurrect the fortunes of the ailing UK steel industry
which brought together the engineering steel activities of the then
state-owned British Steel and GKN.
In practice there was no other buyer.

Jerusalem, Tuesday,
ISRAELI soldiers today shot dead one Arab and wounded seven more
during demonstrations in the occupied West Bank on the first anniversary
of the Hebron massacre.
Israel was on alert for possible suicide bombings by Palestinian
militants.
Palestinians in the bigger West Bank towns, including Hebron, went on
a general strike to commemorate the day Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein
gunned down 29 worshippers in the al-Ibrahimi mosque before survivors
beat him to death.
Islamic militants who vowed to avenge the massacre have since killed
dozens of Israelis, many in suicide attacks.
In a leaflet, the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas said it had kept
its promise ''to avenge the blood of the martyrs'' of the massacre,
killing more than 40 ''Zionists'' and wounding more than 150 others in
attacks it described as heroic.
Israeli troops shot dead a 15-year-old Palestinian youth and wounded
six others in two separate clashes with stone-throwing Arabs at a
refugee camp outside Hebron, Palestinians said.
Meanwhile, in another part of the West Bank, paramilitary border
police shot and wounded an 18-year-old Palestinian when youths threw
stones at military headquarters in the town of Tulkarm, Arab witnesses
said.
The violence was a dark reminder of events during the a seven-year
uprising against Israeli occupation.
A member of the council running Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement, where
Goldstein lived, told Israel Radio that his family and friends would
hold a memorial for him on Thursday.
Goldstein is buried at Kiryat Arba, near Hebron, in a park named after
Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the anti-Arab Kach movement. His grave is
a pilgrimage site for ultra-nationalist Israelis.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin reacted angrily to Goldstein's Israeli
supporters, accusing them of incitement to murder.
Israeli security officials have given warnings of possible suicide
bombings by Palestinian militants seeking to avenge the massacre on its
Islamic calendar anniversary. The massacre occurred on February 25,
1994.
Israeli-Palestinian tension was further heightened yesterday when a
Jewish taxi driver was stabbed to death in Jerusalem.

AS the market for 4x4 vehicles continues to expand, new manufacturers
are being encouraged to put a toe in the water.
Following Mahindra and Rocsta came yet another manufacturer from the
Pacific rim, Ssangyong.
The Korean manufacturer's Musso, an impressive looking vehicle classed
as a limousine-style on/off roadster is already being marketed through a
young dealer network established by International Motors, of West
Bromwich.
Given that this is the company masterminded by Bob Edmiston, who gave
Britain Subaru, Isuzu and Hyundai, we can assume that the Mercedes-Benz
engined machines will be serious challengers to some of the top line
marques already in business here.
And the market promises to become even more crowded very soon.
Coming shortly is Kia's entry, the Sportage, which is also due for a
1995 arrival.
The Sportage will just beat the compact Mercedes-Benz into the
showrooms, by which time we can also expect announcements from such
giants as Honda and even Volvo with regard to their plans for new 4x4s.
Reports from Japan say the Honda is in its final stage of preparation,
but the Volvo, expected to be a Discovery challenger at around #25,000,
may be a little later.
Volvo has always maintained that four-wheel drive vehicles are
unnecessary and expensive, but it has had its corporate arm twisted by
the flood of 4x4s from European and Japanese manufacturers sweeping into
its home market, one that the Swedish company has always jealously
guarded.
So Volvo four-paw prototypes have already been seen undergoing
shakedown trials and we can take it that, if the company meets its
objective of producing what it sees as the safest 4x4 in production, it
will be marketed here through the existing Volvo dealer network.
With so much money being pumped into this sector of the market, the
only question left to be asked is who can afford to stay out of the
race? To date we haven't heard much from the French, Italians or
Germans, (Mercedes-Benz excepted), but it can only be a matter of time
before they show their cards.
High specification 4x4s can be sold at premium prices, which means
more profit for their manufacturers and a bigger margin for their
dealers. This is reason enough for most to shelve any preconceived
notions they may have about the market and to get in while the bubble is
still expanding.

THE bathroom is often the last room in the house to be re-equipped and
decorated when we move into a new home. The kitchen and the living room
take priority, and sometimes we just get used to the old suite and decor
in the bathroom, no longer noticing how shabby and uncomfortable it is.
But the bathroom is the place where you start and end each day, and
creating a comfortable bathroom will lift your spirits on gloomy winter
mornings. If you splash out on a luxurious bathroom, you'll have a room
with an atmosphere you can savour where you can soak away stress at the
end of a busy day.
The temperature of a room can dramatically change the way you feel
about it. If your bathroom is always cold, with an inefficient or
non-existent form of heating, install a wall-mounted towel rail or
radiator. This can be switched off and on automatically, by a remote
switch located outside the bathroom for safety reasons, or can be run
off the central heating. You'll temporarily forget just how uninviting
the bathroom is each time you step out of the bath and wrap yourself in
a big warm bath towel.
There are many styles of towel rails and radiators available, from
reproduction Victorian through classic white to hi-tech or colourful.
Choose one which will provide an interesting focal point in the room,
and one which will fit with the style you want your bathroom to have, so
that when you really can't live any longer with the awkward layout,
tired suite and gloomy atmosphere, you have already taken a step in the
right direction.
Space, or lack of it, is the most common complaint against today's
bathrooms, and if you have a poky bathroom and a spare room in the
house, you could create a luxurious and spacious new bathroom from
cratch. Reputable specialist bathroom companies often provide a free
design service, and will advise on the cost and feasability of
converting a spare room into a bathroom. If you are restricted to a
small bathroom, you'll be surprised at how a more space-efficient layout
and suite can create an impression of more room.
Mirrors are also a great way of doing this, the larger the better. And
a co-ordinated pale colour scheme with accessories in the same tones
will make the room seem bigger and lighter. Be wary of using too much
white, though. White suites have returned to favour, in reaction to some
extent to th over-use by sanitary ware manufacturers of suite colours
which look superb in the showroom, but are difficult to live with day
in, day out, at home. It might be tempting to choose a stunning
all-white scheme to give light and space to a small bathroom. But too
much white can give the impression of austerity, especially when using
glossy laminated and shiny ceramic tiles -- add some creamy tones to
introduce a luxurious feel. Or team white with black for the most
sophisticated and elegant bathroom decor.
It is important to remember, too, that the effect of white-based
schemes is completely ruined if any of the sanitaryware or shelving is
allowed to get even a little grubby. A considerable investment of time
and e ffort is need to keep a white bathroom looking pristine.
Bathrooms look beautiful decorated in earthy colours, providing a warm
haven in our cold northern climate. If your bathroom has a window, make
the most of winter sunlight to conjure up the exotic allure of the
African desert with rough, sandy walls and the rich colours of the
landscape echoed in a stone-effect soft Vinyl floor, with ethnic
textiles, pottery and patterned towels. Vibrant, exciting colours and
design schemes which would be over the top in other rooms in the house
often work well in the bathroom.
A classical mural and sunken bath will create a bathroom which is
definitely not for the nervous, but is just as a practical as a
conventional bathroom. Extravagant fantasy bathrooms have returned to
favour now that many homes have a second, en suite bathroom, which lends
itself to a more imaginative interio design.
Alongside a taste for the opulent and exotic, there's also been a
renewed interest in the minimalist look at the other end of the scale.
To go for a genuine, ruthlessly minimalist scheme, you have to take
oriental simplicity to its absolute exteme. To take on this idiom
spiritually, you have to get rid of most of your possesions which
wouldn't do at all in modern bathrooms. You can achieve the minimalist
look visually by hiding away all of the bathroom clutter in capacious
cupboards -- built floor to cei ling, with flush doors that have a
press-open mechaism instead of handles. The idea is to create a pure,
uninterrupted surface. Walls and floors should be plain and bare,
without pictures or rugs, and any object not in current use should be
concealed.
The trusted mirror-fronted wall-mounted bathoom cabinet which used to
serve us so well couln't hope to cope with the vast array of bottles,
toiletries, cleaning products, make-up and all the other things which
are now essentials in the bathroom.
On the Continent, fitted bathroom furniture is much more common, with
everything having its place in a pull-out drawer, shelf, basket or
cupboard. There are storage solutions which will hide all of the clutter
and enhance your dream bathroom, whichever style suits your tastes, and
a reputable specialist bathroom company will advise on a host of
attractive alternatives.

Eric Clapton has been as a man possessed. But, as fans will see
tonight at Glasgow's SECC, he has survived the tragedy and despair which
have dogged his life. Perhaps though, suggests Allan Laing, the inner
turmoil has been the driving force behind his musical success
Would you know my name if I saw you in Heaven, Would you be the same
if I saw you in Heaven, I must be strong and carry on, 'Cause I know I
don't belong here in Heaven.
- Tears in Heaven
EMOTION is the bankrupt currency of the superstars. They lay bear
their souls to order. They share their hopes and their fears, their
triumphs and their tragedies, with the world at large just as long as it
co-incides with the release of a new album or a new movie. In the end,
their secrets are never secret. True confessions are simply the cynical
means of gaining publicity.
Then you find an exception. When Eric Clapton walked up on to the
stage a couple of years ago to pick up a Grammy Award for Tears In
Heaven, a track from his Unplugged album, he said: ''I have received a
great honour but I've lost the only thing I truly loved.'' There were
15,000 people in the audience and you could have heard a pin drop.
Clapton wrote Tears In Heaven as a tribute to his eight-year-old son,
Conor, who fell to his death from a window on the 53rd floor of a New
York apartment block. It is among the saddest songs in all the world.
If familiarity breeds contempt then Eric Clapton must truly despise
tragedy. It has courted him throughout his life. A combination of
unfortunate circumstance and self-inflicted wounds. By rights he should
be dead. He should be up there on rock music's casualty list alongside
Morrison, Hendrix, and Joplin. Years of drink and drug abuse took him to
the very edge of oblivion.
But tonight he'll be up there on the stage of the SECC, looking as fit
as a butcher's dog in his Armani suit. Eric Clapton, as any ageing Cream
fan will tell you, used to be God. Hendrix was maybe more exciting,
Knopfler the technical maestro, but Clapton was annointed. Of all the
giants of rock he was the one who moved fastest with the times. And we
who are now fortysomething moved with him.
When we were insufferable, pretentious teenagers he mirrored our
rebellious nature by belting out the blues with John Mayall. When we
were potheaded and wildly anti-establishment he echoed our confusion
with the abstract ingenuity of Cream. When we mellowed, when we slowed
down, so did he (well, musically, at least) with Delaney and Bonnie
Bramlett and his own Derek and the Dominos. And then, when we grew up,
so too did he. Eventually. With a series of solo albums which contain
some of the greatest, most mature, songs of our age.
To understand Clapton's dark journey through life, you have to go back
to his childhood. He was born in 1945, the product of an affair between
his teenage mother and a Canadian soldier. His father deserted him and
Clapton was reared by his grandmother. When he was five, he discovered
that his older sister -- who by that time had married and gone abroad --
was actually his mother.
The revelation left him disturbed and confused. He was a failure at
school and, at the age of 16, he went to art college in London. It was
around this time that his insecurity and his loneliness led him to the
blues. He identified with the music of BB King, Muddy Waters, and Elmore
James because it was the bitter sweet sound of someone crying out in
pain.
Clapton found personal relationships impossible, choosing instead to
express his emotions through his guitar. He performed first with John
Mayall and later with the Yardbirds. But real fame came with Cream, his
collaboration with Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce which reached its apex
with the legendary Wheels of Fire double album.
Throughout this period Clapton developed a massive mistrust of the
opposite sex. He treated women with contempt. His sexual conquests were
legion but his relationships were always purely physical; there was
seldom if ever an emotional attachment. He was not a nice man.
Clapton didn't remember the sixties -- because he was there. His faint
recollections of the period are surrounded by a haze of drugs. Cocaine,
acid, speed, LSD -- you name it, he tried it. Substance abuse served to
make him debauched, arrogant, and spectacularly rude. Biographers have
suggested that his drug habit was a way of avoiding the reality of a
lost love. Somewhere along his twisted line he had met Patti Boyd, model
and sixties icon. The relationship was like a blues song; he loved her
but he couldn't have her. She was George Harrison's. When she finally
married the Beatle, Clapton wrote a song about her. Layla, surely one of
rock music's greatest anthems.
Now he was more than the best guitarist in the world. He was a writer
of love songs. But he was also well on the way to becoming a heroin
addict. In the immediate post-Cream days, while he was recording tracks
for Derek and the Dominos in LA, he was permanently stoned. Classic
rock-star-death-wish.
Sheer lunacy was his forte. His nadir came in 1976 with an infamous
drunken outburst during a Birmingham concert in which he urged his
audience to vote for Enoch Powell. Now you could add ''bigot and
racist'' to his long list of credentials. The establishment of the Rock
Against Racism pressure group was a direct result of the incident.
Then, with the help of Pete Townshend, he cleaned himself up and
kicked his drug dependency. His recovery co-incided with the break-up of
Patti's marriage to Harrison. Suddenly, she was available and Clapton
moved in. They married in 1979. Temporarily rejuvenated in body, mind,
and spirit, he found himself returning to form with a series of highly
successful solo albums. Among the songs he wrote during this lengthy
period of renaissance was Wonderful Tonight, on the face of it a puerile
love song for Patti but in truth a cynical stab at the woman he loved.
(It came to him when he was becoming impatient as he waited for Patti to
get ready one night. It meant ''You look wonderful. Now hurry up and
let's go.'')
Clapton went back on the road and by 1982 he had returned to his bad
old ways, knocking back two bottles of brandy a day. He courted oblivion
yet again, coming perilously close to death as a result of
alcohol-related stomach ulcers. He may have been a musical genius but he
was also a stinking drunk. But again he was drawn back from the edge.
Someone persuaded him to register in an unorthodox American
rehabilitation clinic, run by a Catholic priest. He never drank again.
There was, however, one compulsion which Eric Clapton could not
conquer. He remained addicted to women. He still is. It came as no
surprise to anyone when his marriage to Patti ended in divorce in 1988.
Two years earlier he had met an Italian dancer, Lori del Santo, and they
had a child, Conor. Though the relationship did not survive, the
presence of a son at last gave Clapton's life purpose and reason.
He continued to make successful albums and began writing film scores
-- for the BBC thriller serial Edge of Darkness, and for Hollywood
movies like Lethal Weapon and Rush. He started his (now traditional)
annual series of concerts at London's Royal Albert Hall. Life was good.
And then. In early spring 1991, the rock star decided that he wanted
to spend more time with his son. So eight-year-old Conor came over from
his mother's home in Milan to spend some time with Clapton in his New
York apartment. On March 20, as Conor waited for his dad to take him on
a trip to the zoo, he fell 750 feet to his death through an open window.
In the wake of the tragedy, Clapton somehow managed to maintain his
sobriety. As usual, he could only express his feelings through his
music. Tears In Heaven, he said later, was like a prayer. ''I just wrote
four lines of prose and I knew that other people would immediatly
recognise the feelings within those lines,'' he explained.
In a recent interview, Clapton declared that the two great problems in
his life were the fear of loneliness and a lack of self-esteem. Having
accepted that they exist within him, he is taking them on. One day at a
time.

THE Royal Bank of Scotland is to offer what it describes as the
cheapest credit card conditions in the market for customers who
regularly use their cards for borrowing.
From February 23, the Royal's MasterCard will offer a single interest
rate of 1.14% for all outstanding balances -- 14.5% on an annualised
basis -- and no annual fee providing the customers use the card
primarily for borrowing.
''The card is aimed at those people who use their card for convenience
borrowing, a total of around nine million people in this country,'' the
Royal's Andrew Waldman said yesterday. There is no interest-free period,
a facility which benefits credit card holders who tend to pay off in
full each month.
On grounds of commercial confidentiality, he refused to say how many
Royal customers had opted for the MasterCard since its introduction 15
months ago. Until now the bank had split its card interest rate with
borrowers of less than #1000 paying 1.25% and the others paying 1.14%.

THE pound slumped to a two-year low against the German mark yesterday
and is now within sight of its all-time low amid growing concern about
rising inflation and the Government's political problems over Europe and
Northern Ireland.
Sterling has been plagued by political factors over the last 10 days
and has fallen sharply against the Deutschmark since Friday February 3,
the day after interest rates were raised by 0.5% to 6.75%.
But leading City analysts poured cold water on speculation that the
pound faced a rerun of the crisis which forced it out of Europe's
exchange rate mechanism in September 1992.
The pound's fall had not reached crisis proportions and a panic
interest rate hike to arrest its decline was unlikely at this stage.
Bank of England intervention to support sterling was not being ruled
out.
''We think there is some way to go before we see policy responding
directly to sterling's weakness,'' said Adam Cole, UK economist at City
stockbroker, James Capel.
The pound fell through its 1994 low of DM2.3710 in early morning
trading and continued to plummet as it reached levels not seen since
February 1993. At one point it had shed more than two pfennigs against
the mark and a cent against the dollar, but there were signs of rally in
late trading.
This cut the losses to 1.94 pfennigs at DM2.3579 and 0.25 cents at
$1.5605. Its trade weighted index, which is closely monitored by the
Bank of England in assessing monetary policy, declined from 87.5 to
86.9, equal to its 1994 low.
Chartists had their eyes on sterling's all-time low of DM2.3150,
recorded in February 1993 after the then Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Norman Lamont, had aggressively cut interest rates to kick start the
economy out of deep-rooted recession.
Financial markets were nervous ahead of inflation figures on both
sides of the Atlantic and retail sales and labour market data in the UK.
The pound is particularly vulnerable to any further indications that the
inflation profile is deteriorating.
On Monday the pound held up well to much worse than expected producer
prices figures, though gilts lost ground. Inflation fears came to the
fore yesterday in a belated reaction.
City traders are worried that the Governor of the Bank of England and
the Chancellor of the Exchequer could be pulled in opposite directions
over interest rates, as the Government tries to retrieve its political
fortunes.

PRESIDENT of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine has decided not to
refer the #1200m hostile bid by Trafalgar House for the Northern
Electricity distribution company to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission as had been hoped by the Newcastle-based utility.
This means that Trafalgar can now go ahead with its current offer of
#44.35 cash and 65 Trafalgar Convertible Preference shares for every 100
Northern which currently values each Northern share at 1040 p.
Northern's shares leapt 116p to 1091p while Trafalgar Ordinary were 3p
better at 69p and the Convertible also 3p firmer at 91[3/4]p.
However, it is widely expected that Trafalgar will increase the bid to
perhaps 1200p or so.
Industry regulator Stephen Littlechild's recommendation was that on
balance a reference to the MMC would have been beneficial. That was
largely on the grounds that the Trafalgar bid was the first for a
privatised utility and that a full discussion of the implications would
be welome.
However Trafagar has given assurances which appear to largely meet
OFFER's reservations including full information to provide appropriate
financial separation and financial independence. One factor which has
been of some importance is that Trafalgar has not had any experience of
running a major utility company.
Also the operating licence has been granted to Northern only and not
to any other company. Mr Littlechild is concerned to clarify the legal
position on this point.
Northern shareholders meet this morning to vote on a resolution to
abolish an article of association which limits the voting power on any
holding to 15%. This is expected to be nothing more than a pure
formality.
Trafalgar now has 4.82% of Northern's shares which is remarkably good
going at this stage of a bid and before the MMC hurdle disappeared. In
addition, Swiss Bank Corporation's market-making division has a 5.33%
holding which it said was acquired purely in that role and not as
adviser to Trafalgar. However, the legal status of that holding is not
clear with there being a warning from securities industry regulator
Securities and Investment Board that the law may well have been broken.
On its part, Northern was claiming that it now has had over 400
withdrawal notices from shareholders who had originally accepted the
offer and have since changed their minds.
As part of its softening up process, Trafalgar has told all Northern's
domestic customers that they will receive a #20 rebate on their
electricity bills if the bid does succeed.
Northern nust produce its last defence document by Friday while
Trafalgar has until February 24 to increase its terms.
Shadow Trade and Industry secretary John Cunningham said that ''The
assurances requested by the Presidenty of the Board of Trade from
Trafalgar House fall short of what is necessary to ensure absolute
transparency in the accounting procedures and management of Northern
Electric.''
It has been suggested that Trafalgar's financial position and credit
rating are such that it may have to pay higher rates on borrowings which
could eventually impact upon Northern customers through higher tariffs.

OKAY, all you red-blooded males that were at the Royal last night for
the screening of the MGM 1926 silent classic Flesh and the Devil. Be
honest. Which of you could have handled that smouldering, scheming,
emotional gold-digger Greta Garbo? Not me, I tell you.
And certainly not poor old John Gilbert, whose tongue almost hit the
ground every time she went into heat and unleashed her molten,
come-to-bed look at him. A brilliant film, packed with melodrama, enough
corn to fill a good-sized poke and, last night, a voluptuous orchestral
score composed and conducted by Carl Davis with the Royal SNO playing at
an appropriately pulsing temperature.
Davis has a magical touch with silent movies. I suspect the man could
come up with the right formula for a musical setting of the telephone
directory. Flesh and the Devil had the lot: the heroic overture, a
lovely cross between literalism and send-up for the military barracks,
and archly rhetorical music for a fire-and-brimstone sermon.
But this film is all about intimacy and emotional intensity: for its
time some of it is quite erotic, not in its explicitness, but in the
sensuality of stillness and languor. Davis's music here is magnificent.
Drawing heavily on the ultra-expressive inspiration of Richard Strauss,
with clever references to Schoenberg's erotic masterpiece, Transfigured
Night, Davis has provided an exact musical complement to the moving
image. Splendid stuff.

ROBERT CRAWFORD, 70 in April, is a Scottish composer of small but
fastidious output whose Ricercre, a single movement octet for wind and
strings, served as the lucid, spare-textured launching pad for the
latest thoughtfuly compiled programme by the Hebrides Ensemble.
With its Schubertian sonorities, through which spectres of Sibelius
and Nielsen sometimes stalked, the piece was a model of how to make
every note discreetly count. In comparison, Erwin Schulhoff's
Divertissement -- a well-intentioned tribute to a composer who died at
the hands of the Nazis, but sadly an error of musical judgment -- was
merely seven movements of prattle for woodwind trio.
Janacek's Mladi displayed the difference between talent and genius,
even in a performance that missed something of its ecstatically spiky
vitality, but the elegiac stillness of John Bevan-Baker's Eclogue was
beautifully caught.
Commissioned by the Hebrides Ensemble, it was not quite complete at
the time of its composer's recent death. From Nigel Osborne its closing
pages -- ending with a haunting postlude for solo piano -- received a
''small amount reconstruction'', but the work by then had already made
its point as what can only be described as a touching self-obituary.
Finally, to sustain the mood, came the melancholy lyricism of Mahler's
Songs of a Wayfarer in Schoenberg's pared-down arrangement. Alan Oke, a
high baritone who has pushed his voice into the tenor register, was the
expressive -- not to say expressionist -- singer.

While the Chechnya conflict is being scaled down, the full
repercussions of Yeltsin's folly have yet to be felt in Russia -- and
perhaps beyond.
John Miller reports
WITH the Russian and Chechen military commanders agreeing to scale
down the 14-week bloody conflict in Chechnya, there is now a real
possibility of seeing the end of a war which has claimed thousands of
lives and destroyed a city once home to more than 400,000 people.
The Russian army is already handing over responsibility for keeping
the peace -- which could well be a synonym for finishing the job -- to
troops from the Interior Ministry.
Meanwhile, a Russian-led government is poised to move to Grozny and
set up a provisional administration until elections, just possibly next
year, to replace General Dudayev and his cronies.
Already there is talk of Chechen rebel units taking to the mountains
where they apparently intend to harry the Russians, as did for some 10
years the Afghan guerrillas. But by agreeing to stop using heavy weapons
and continue talks on a complete ceasefire the Russians are showing more
flexibility than of late.
It is quite possible that some sense of normality will return to
wretched Chechnya and work started on the huge and daunting task of
reconstruction, restoring the oil industry and rebuilding the regional
economy.
The fumbling, fateful campaign by the Russian army which has led to
the destruction of Grozny is without doubt the worst mistake that
President Boris Yeltsin and his Kremlin team have made in three years of
office. And it has been everybody's pain.
Estimates of casualties vary, and they have been talked up, and down,
by both sides in the propaganda campaign largely directed at making
friends in the West. The Chechens are insisting they have lost about
3500 fighters of whom about 500 were killed. The Russians claim to have
killed wounded or captured 7000 Chechen rebels at a cost of 1000 dead of
their own. Nobody is saying anything at all about how many casualties
there were among the civilian population, including Russians, who
largely remained in Grozny during the brutal bombardment by artillery
and aircraft. There seems little doubt that the figure runs into
thousands.
The financial cost of the military operations alone has also not yet
been revealed by Yeltsin's ministers but it is bound to run into several
hundred million pounds, and Yeltsin must be desperately hoping that the
war does not turn into a prolonged Russian occupation of the north
Caucasian republic.
But certainly the war is threatening to derail the Government's
efforts at economic reform this year, particularly the desperate attempt
to suppress inflation, hold down the budget deficit and reduce the flow
of central bank credits to inefficient industries and collective farms.
Thus it is not at all surprising that the International Monetary Fund,
which was already dissatisfied with the Russian government budget
forecasts, appears to be taking its time about announcing a
multi-billion dollar loan.
Chechnya has also been a humiliation for the once-great Red Army. It
has resulted in the sacking of three widely respect deputy defence
ministers who from the start warned that the Chechnya war was senseless
and unwinnable, and led to politicians demanding the head of the Defence
Minister General Pavel Grachev, and for a top-to-bottom reform of the
army.
Meanwhile, the ever-deepening rift between Yeltsin's inner circle and
the top ranks of the army has created suspicion and uncertainty and
given rise to rumours of intrigues and threatened coups.
In fact, what can be seen as the ''Chechen syndrome'' has left its
mark on Russia's whole political life. Over the past two months little
has been heard from Vladimir Zhiranovsky, the ultra-nationalist who
seems to have lost his flair for taking up whatever line is currently
most popular with the people. But it is clear that the still-strong
nationalist forces in the country believe that the time is coming when
Yeltsin will slip and they will be presented with a chance not only to
block his reforms, but also to restore the old order.
Yeltsin's enemies have been sharpening their knives ever since the
elections 14 months ago when effectively he won support for his proposal
to run the country by presidential decree, and the legislature became
barely more than a rubber stamp body. They will demand early elections
and try to impeach him. And there is no shortage of candidates for his
job. Like a wounded bear, however, he could prove lethal to those trying
to finish him off.
Yeltsin's former allies, particularly liberal and reformist
politicians such as Yegor Gaidar, have severely criticised him for the
mass slaughter of the civilian population in Chechnya and for not trying
hard enough to negotiate a political settlement with Dudayev, but they
too are well aware that they have even less of a following in Russia
than has Yeltsin and that any attempt to topple him would help destroy
the main symbol of democratic reform. It may well be that Yeltsin is
placing his hopes in the power of inertia, the very force he has been
cursing as the root of Russia's ills.
He has been careful not to announce formally whether he intends to
stand again in elections which are due next year and when, according to
conventional wisdom, only a miracle could get him re-elected.
Some Russian liberals doubt if the elections will take place. They
warn of the possibility of a military coup by the humiliated and
impoverished officer class, or an attempt by Yeltsin and his friends to
cancel or postpone the election.
Like many a Russian reformer before him, Yeltsin may find that
imposing order in one corner of the Tsar's realm comes at the price of a
little less liberty in Russia as a whole.
Yeltsin's enemies have been sharpening their knives . . . Like a
wounded bear, however, he could prove lethal to those trying to finish
him off

WHAT better St Valentine's dance work than Orfeo -- given that, in Kim
Brandstrup's version, love triumphs over death and Eurydice is returned,
alive and kissing, to her devoted spouse? Obviously Edinburgh audiences
thought so too, for Arc Dance Company had the heartening experience of a
full house on this, their Scottish debut.
Arc Dance offer work that proves you can maintain individuality within
the mainstream. Brandstrup has said himself that story-telling has been
seen as something of a naughty word in the dance world. A suggestion,
perhaps, that serious dance has to be a matter of abstraction. And yet,
he tackles crucial themes that affect humanity through dance which is
gestural, which communicates emotions and tensions in a body language
culled from such disciplines as classical ballet, contemporary, folk
dance and indeed our own commonplace shrugs and glances.
In Orfeo he takes all this and adds in the marvellously poised
attitudes of a different century -- the eighteenth -- and in doing so he
explores elements of control. And what could be more controlling of our
lives than death?
Kenneth Tharp (Death) plays cat-and-mouse games with newly weds Orfeo
and Eurydice against a backdrop of courtly protocols. It is amazingly
suspenseful, the atmosphere plangently echoed by Ian Dearden's
synthesised score pummelling away with harpsichord tones and rhythms.
An image, too, in the huge ladder of a two-way traffic between the
realms and yet, disappointingly, despite the exciting rhythms of the
music and the tremendous energy of the company, there is a low-key feel
which seems at odds with the overlay of colour and vitality.

SHOW me a twentysomething woman and I will show you a fridge full of
festering celery. Its miraculous qualities are lodged deep within the
female psyche. Round about the time we find out about the big issues
such as periods, procreation and how to pluck eyebrows painlessly
(multi-purpose Vaseline does the trick) we discover that not only does
celery have zilch calories, the effort of eating a stick of the stuff
actually burns calories off. What a life-enhancing revelation.
In theory, if you ate enough celery you could have negative calorie
equity. In practice, this means gnawing it 12 hours a day just to burn
off a Twix. Waldorf salads are fine and dandy but a little bit of celery
goes a long way. But this humble veg is a health talisman. We purchase
it with the same cyclical regularity with which we pop the pill. We put
it in the fridge. We forget about it. It liquidates. We throw it out. We
buy some more.
The Duchess of Windsor's observation that you can never be too thin
still has us in thrall and we'll buy anything with slenderising
potential, from sugar-free Coke to taste-free low-cal meals. At least my
generation, in our eternal quest for the Holy Grail of Glamour are more
switched on to health kicks than amphetamine addiction. Well, the
doctors stopped dishing out the diet pills.
My mates and I are typical. We haphazardly attend Step Reebok. We
leave the class with beetroot-blotched faces, sweating like pigs and
troubled by the fact that the ''advanced'' crowd waiting for the next
session still have cellulite-dimpled thighs. Like, you can undergo this
torture for two years and not turn into Cindy Crawford? This thought
depresses us so much we have to go for a drink. And something to eat.
Just a small slice of Mississippi Mud Pie. Oh, go on then. With cream.
Fitness fads come and go. Aerobics. Popmobility. Aerobic walking.
Callanetics. Step. Boxercise. The latest craze, which is about to be
heavily hyped, is AeroSkip, with Reebok rivals Puma backing exercise
guru Mr Motivator and his aerobic skipping routines. Just now women
across the country are slithering about ridiculously, doing Slide. You
can practise in the comfort of your own home, on the original Slide,
marketed by Forza Fitness, for a hefty ninety smackers.
I'm just surprised that, so far, the concept of Sexercise hasn't been
punted; after all, it's popularly believed that a bout of sex has the
fitness benefits of a four-mile run, although this has to be a flight of
fancy put about by men, most of whom are clearly keener on the 100-yard
dash. However, if 20 minutes of low-impact cardiovascular exercise can
annihilate 200 calories then a sex session should destroy, well, at
least 30.
'Course you'll have to find a Sexercise partner first. Hah! It will be
a cinch. Men all over the country are slapping their hands to their
foreheads over the fact that they haven't thought of Sexercise first;
this has to be the most obvious way to sell sex to wary women. Guys'
classic eighties chat-up line, faking a feminist sensibility, was:
''Have you read The Second Sex?'' The nineties number could be: ''Let's
hit the sack and lose some pounds.'' We'll race each other to the
bedroom door.
The possibilities are beguiling. Self-confessed, so-called sex addicts
like filmstars Michael Douglas and Rob Lowe, could turn their penance
into profit, ditch the sackcloth-and-ashes therapy routines and hustle a
dollar from their ''addiction'', revitalising their careers, a la Jane
Fonda, with explanatory video guides.
Admittedly, there will be disadvantages for fat women who will
suddenly become very popular with born-again Christians, but who knows?
It could be liberating. Girls could laugh and say: ''Oh, I eat whatever
I want. I just Sexercise a lot,'' and no-one would call them a slag.
Just envy their tip-top fitness.
You'd have to take a holistic approach. Haagen Dazs would be out.
Smearing fromage frais over pectorals would be in. In the eighties a
book called How To Lose Weight During Sex enjoyed brief popularity but
for Sexercise to really take off as the latest craze it would need the
backing of one of the sports manufacturers, raising the possibility
that, as with Step Reebok, the sexual act might forever after be linked
with a brand name.
A range of accessories could be marketed; sporty lingerie; wrist
straps in lurid sweat-material; Lycra blindfolds for the adventurous.
Sexercise: a fantasy? Well, until some dollar-muscle gets behind the
concept and the marketing men move in. Call me a gender-traitor but when
it comes to weight control women will try anything. Even a jaw-aching
stick of celery.

Women puzzled it out way back in the seventies. More recently the
final pieces were slotted in to complete the picture for both sexes.
Francesca Fearon looks at a fitting addition to the Jigsaw empire
NIGEL Coates says: ''Glasgow has a strong decorative tradition and an
ability to incorporate different decorative styles.'' And this inspired
his designs for the new Jigsaw shop in Buchanan Street, which brings its
collections for both sexes under one roof -- and one sky. The aim is to
present Jigsaw with an integrated image, and, as a result, the two shops
on different levels of Princes Square have been closed.
In the new venue the menswear section is upstairs and decorated with
astrological figures echoing the futuristic Stuart Helms cutouts in the
windows. Yellow walls, wavy rails, and panelling downstairs invoke a
landscape setting for the womenswear section.
As fashion empires go, Jigsaw is small, but perfectly formed, and
outside of London, Glasgow has proved its most successful city. It is
unpretentious, unassuming and has a canny knack of producing good
quality clothes that have the precise amount of fashion edge without
toppling forward into the avant garde or backwards into the mind-numbing
depths of safe dressing. Jigsaw has found its niche as a haven for label
refugees and those seeking innovative design at a price.
The spring collection, defying gravity on the undulating rails of the
new store, includes belted pant suits; slim pencil skirts and printed
cap-sleeve blouses that reflect the forties revival; combat jackets and
bright satin skirts with short-sleeved cardigans and jaunty berets.
The menswear collection has nylon combat jackets in traditional khaki
and black, but also a startling target orange. The silhouette is a cross
between mod and beatnik style -- with tapering trousers and collarless
bomber jackets, the brightly coloured skinny knits emphasise the retro
mood.
According to menswear designer and international production manager
Chris Bailey: ''It is the adventurous stuff that is selling better.''
The key to Jigsaw's success rests on two important factors: the
team-like culture generated by the owner John Robinson, and the
fastidious attention to detail shadowing the progress of a garment --
from fabric to little satin dirndl skirts and Bardoesque gingham
dresses. Longevity always lurks in the back of the minds of Ros Bailey,
head of design, and her team.
''We like garments to stand the test of time, we're not producing
throwaway fashion,'' Bailey explains. ''Something from last season can
be spiced up with the satin jacket of the moment.''
There is an indifference to fleeting trends, but looking ahead: ''We
are doing the knee length for spring, but in a light, flirty, fresh way.
We are conscious that by the summer everyone will want to try it.''
While team decisions imply consensus, designers will stick their necks
out if they believe in a design. There is no specific house-style except
that Jigsaw creates good, classic basics that work in with the
fashionable jackets and new skirt shapes.
Attention to detail permeates every aspect of Jigsaw life from the
right button to the helpful shop assistants and fresh vases of flowers
arranged daily. Corporate philosophy -- terminology Robinson abhors --
encourages customers to feel comfortable in Jigsaw shops. Customers are
not just the ''thirtysomethings'' who have grown with Jigsaw since its
launch in the seventies, but include enthusiastic mothers, daughters,
and now with the men's collection -- introduced two years ago -- fathers
and brothers.
Jigsaw is not run by pinstriped accountants. The man who cleverly and
carefully steers the company wears big sweaters and jeans and runs a
farm when he is not conferring with designers at the head office in Kew.
John Robinson is a diffident, unassuming personality who relies on gut
instinct rather than corporate marketing men with sale charts and
computer models when it comes to deciding where to locate a shop. He can
estimate the turnover of an outlet just by looking at neighbouring
retailers and the people in the street.
His first shops quietly opened in London's leafy suburbs -- Richmond,
Putney, and Hampstead -- 20 years ago. Jigsaw avoided the chain-store
route. New outlets were added slowly, including the Princes Square
branch five years ago. Now there are 34 in the UK, with seven in
Australia and three in Japan.
* Styles pictured are all from the new collections at Jigsaw, Buchanan
Street, Glasgow.

The threat of a strike at French-owned car giant Peugeot ended
yesterday when workers narrowly rejected industrial action. Workers at

The vote means that a two-year deal -- worth 3.5% this year and 4% or

THE President of the Board of Trade is a decisive man but it is always
dangerous to confuse decisiveness with wise decision making. This has
never been more true than in Mr Heseltine's decision yesterday to
decline referral of Trafalgar House's hostile bid for Northern Electric
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The problem facing Mr
Heseltine was not simply a matter of examining the details of the bid
and then satisfying himself that the concerns of the regulator,
Professor Stephen Littlechild, had been met. In the event Trafalgar
House advanced some perfectly reasonable assurances. Northern's ability
under Trafalgar House to fulfill its statutory and licence obligations
was confirmed and Professor Littlejohn has been promised open access to
any information from any Trafalgar House company which he might need to
satisy his regulatory functions.
So far, so good. In a sense that was the easy bit for Trafalgar. Aware
of the sensitivity of the regulation issue, and involved in a bitter and
increasingly acrimonious takeover bid, the Trafalgar management was also
well aware that the identity of ownership does not, in the final
analysis, matter a fig to the regulator. All that matters is that he is
able to carry out his function. Any owner of a public utility of this
sort, be it Trafalgar, Northern, or (whisper it) Hanson, will be taken
to court if the requirements of the regulator as laid down are not met
in full.
If matters have become relatively easy for Trafalgar, it is similarly
the case that Mr Heseltine has not wrinkled his brow overmuch on this
issue. This is because, in refusing to refer the bid to the MMC, he has
merely been following the internal logic inherent in the position of a
privatised public utility.
Market forces decree that once a business is privatised it is open to
purchase from anyone capable of winning the bidding. Set in this
context, and paying due obeisance to the power of the markets, there
was, by the lights of Mr Hesletine or any Minister in the present
Government, no good reason to deny Trafalgar its right to proceed.
What we have just described is the logic of the market. It is
powerful, inexorable, and potentially harmful in this context. The
quality that the President of the Board of Trade brought to his
deliberations should have been wisdom rather than a narrowly confined
logic. The takeover of Northern is the first instance in which a
formerly public and now privatised utility has been subjected to a
hostile takeover bid.
This being the case, it would have been right and proper for the
Northern affair to be examined in detail. It is true that this would
have meant that the bid would have lapsed pending the result of the
inquiry, but a referral would have allowed full oportunity for the
examination of a number of important related issues.
Not the least of these is the question of public interest, and this
would have focused on the economic and employment impact of a takeover.
The formerly public utilities have been subjected to considerable loss
of jobs since privatisation. It is inevitable that this process will
continue when Northern is taken over, indeed parts of the business may
be sold off. This process could intensify after 1998 when a measure of
true competition is introduced into the supply of electricity and yet
further squeezes on staffing will be needed to maintain profits. The
vulnerability to takeover of other utilities around the country,
including the electricity providers in Scotland, would also be examined,
not by the MMC, but by interested parties and by the utilities
themselves, who could have (and might yet) set up mergers and
cross-deals to protect their positions.
In any affair like this there are winners and losers. The winners are
likely to be Trafalgar, but who are the losers? Apart from the newly
unemployed, taken together with the economic knock-on effects of
unemployment, this question can best be illuminated by asking why
Trafalgar should want to engulf Northern.
It is likely that a prime motive for the Trafalgar board would be the
prospect of offsetting taxes against the new acquisition. This will be
done legally and legitimately under the current dispensation, but it
does illustrate the identity of the losers; they will be the Treasury
and, inevitably, the ordinary taxpayer. That is why Mr Heseltine should
have been guided, not by the logic of the markets, but by the wisdom of
public interest.

BRITISH Rail train drivers are shaping up for a campaign of industrial
action in support of a demand for an inflation-busting pay increase
which, if not conceded, could seriously delay or possibly even derail
the Government's privatisation timetable.
Their union, Aslef, has already submitted the claim , which could be
the last central wage negotiations before bargaining is devolved to the
45 or so companies that BR is being divided into under privatisation,
for ''a substantial percentage increase over and above inflation''
payable from April 1.
Even before BR replies, Aslef has conducted a referendum of its 15,000
members employed by BR asking them whether they would be prepared to
take industrial action up to and including strike action over pay and
the protection of promotional channels. The result of that referendum is
not due until next week but returns to date indicate a massive ''yes''
according to general secretary Lew Adams.
Unless the Government allows BR to concede a substantial pay award,
which would clearly breach its own public sector pay freeze policy, loco
drivers appear set to embark on a series of one-day strikes which,
together with a ban on overtime and rest-day working, would reduce rail
services to chaos.
Unlike last summer's signalmen's strike -- which resulted in an 8.7%
settlement -- there would be no prospect of managers and supervisors
manning trains and services would be brought to a virtual standstill.
Against such a background it appears unlikely anyone would want to bid
for any of the rail franchises on offer, especially once they become
aware that under privatisation Aslef will become the largest union at
each of the 25 or so train operating companies, and would then seek to
pick them off one at a time.
Train drivers, like the signal workers before last year's dispute,
have a relatively low basic wage of #215 for a 39-hour week. The bulk of
their earnings comes in the form of overtime and other premium payments.
Average earnings are around #19,000 on BR whereas on London Underground,
where a similar claim has also been lodged, they are about #24,000.

IT is doubtful if any rank has been more contentious than that of
''gentleman''. It was causing bitterness even in the fourteenth century.
''When Adam delved, and Eve span,'' cried the rebellious peasants, ''Who
was then the gentleman?'' Being near the bottom of the social ladder,
alas, those who claim the title are invariably keen to stamp on the
fingers of those below. From its original derivation, just meaning a man
of good family, it became equated with the French ''gentilhomme'', or
nobleman. It was then linked with the right to a coat of arms, a view
encouraged by the heralds, who collected fees for approving them. Even
Shakespeare felt the need to upgrade himself from being classed as a
''vagabond''.
The only modern qualification seems to be behaving like the rest of
''good'' society, but even this, it seems, needs monitoring. Having
finished with debating whether gentlemen smoke cigars with their bands
on, London's clubland has moved on to blazers and ties. No gentleman,
wrote Michael Kidson, has a blazer in his wardrobe, or ever wears a
recognisable tie. On the contrary, replied Douglas Sutherland. A Henley
man has a rowing blazer, for instance, and any proper gentleman will
have a shooting jacket, a fishing jacket, a gardening jacket, and jacket
to wear with his flannels when he plays tennis. It is this, says Mr
Sutherland, which is called a blazer, and not a sports jacket. As for
old school ties, these should be worn only for formal occasions like
weddings and memorial services. One should wear an MCC tie at Lords, he
says, but not while watching a Test match on television.
It is curious that dress, rather than behaviour, should be emphasised.
Even the cynical H L Mencken defined a gentleman as one who never struck
a woman without provocation. The importance of appearances was noted by
Winston Churchill, however. When Montgomery asked him for his definition
of a gentleman, he replied: ''I know one when I see one.'' It was only
afterwards that he added, ''I suppose one might say . . . someone who is
only rude intentionally.''

THE chief executive of Shetland Islands Tourism points out that the
Scottish Tourist Board, unlike Shetland, fails to provide guide books,
brochures, etc, in foreign languages (February 1).
The question of how to advertise the attractions of Scotland to
potential European tourists came to my notice when, on holiday in the
north of Scotland, my husband and I encountered a quartet of Italian
tourists.
They assured us that one of the main attractions for them in Scotland
was the weather. Coming from Rome where the summer months are unbearably
hot, they greatly appreciated the difference here.
At home there was no comfort for them for work or leisure. We asked
about the cold winds and rain we have here even in summer. They found
them refreshing, and anyway they had come prepared bringing warm
pullovers and umbrellas. Besides, they pointed out, the rain rarely
lasts all day and is usually light.
Should we wish to advertise the assets of Scotland for the tourist
from Italy or other Mediterranean countries, they suggested that, as
well as mentioning the scenic areas, historic sites, and so on, we
should emphasise the mild fresh climate, the fitful sunshine, the
changing weather patterns, the invigorating sea breezes, the long light
evenings, the splendid sunsets and the green countryside.

IN defence of Scottish Opera's design group manager, and what your
arts diarist (February 2) terms his ''huffy'' response to the claim by
Wet Wet Wet's manager that their collaboration with a range of artists
for a new album cover and associated exhibition represents a ''unique
interaction'', it's so only in terms of the personalities involved, not
as a concept. And nor are such cross-over partnerships confined to
opera.
In March 1993, for instance, special needs dance group Jigsaw Dance
Theatre staged a multimedia event at the Briggait on the subject of
birth, marriage, and death. That involved composers Bill Sweeney and
Chick Lyall working with the SCO, artists Keith McIntyre, Johnny
McGuinness, and Stuart McKenzie, and choreographer Cheryl Strong.
Mind you, the SCO's annual report described that as ''a unique
collaboration'' as well.
The spur for this letter isn't pique, it's precision.

ONCE a highly valued SNP member, Jim Fairlie has alas joined the
nit-pickers' club (February 7). His present stance is doing nothing to
speed the rebirth of the Scottish state.
The leadership of the SNP has no fount of wisdom from which to drink
(nor has any other party). The time for minute study of each party and
candidate is when national liberty has been won.
Until then, Jim Fairlie should come back to the battlefront.

THE absurd over-reaction from politicians and others to the planned
withdrawal of Motorail and some sleeper services is entirely
predictable, but when are the rail lobby going to recognise reality?
They seem quite incapable of grasping that for the vast majority of
Scotland's population and visitors the rail network has no value
whatsoever, and little interest beyond the sentimental.
For those in rural areas, car ownership is virtually a necessity, and
the only practical form of public transport is the bus.
It is primarily in Central Scotland that rail travel offers any
benefit, and even there plans to re-open lines such as that between
Stirling and Alloa have been shown to be economic non-starters.
Calls for further electrification are equally misplaced, as the
present diesel trains are quite adequate for the task. Even when they
are life expired, replacement diesel units would cost a fraction of what
would be required in order to introduce electrification.
Those wishing to see a secure future for any railways in Scotland must
face the fact that the network needs to be reduced in size. The West
Highland line together with the lines radiating from Inverness to Kyle,
Wick, Thurso, Aberdeen, and Perth should be closed as quickly as
possible.
This would generate significant savings and negligible hardship, as
there is a perfectly adequate road network, quite capable of handling
the minimal increase in traffic.
Claims that these routes are in any way lifelines are nonsense. The
real lifelines are roads -- and that is why most people and virtually
all freight travels on them.
Rail closures would have little impact on tourism, as few, if any,
tourists come to Scotland solely to travel on these routes.

WHAT a happy memory your picture of an artist's impression of the new
bridge between Harris and Scalpay evoked (February 7).
We spent a week's holiday three years ago in John Macleod country in
June. The weather was idyllic and we swam in the sea from beautiful
deserted beaches. We walked for a day on Scalpay, enjoying every minute,
and had afternoon tea served in a front room with warm island friendship
and interest.
To cap a day of perfection the MacBrayne's steamer sailed through the
Sound of Scalpay and a local gentleman told us, ''He does that sometimes
if he is in a good mood!''
On departing from Harris we took our courage in both hands -- we asked
-- and he did it for us!
I wonder if the MacBrayne's steamer will make it under ''that there''
new bridge?

EILEEN MIRTLE is concerned about the proposed closure of Wards 7 and 8
at Cowglen Hospital in Glasgow. She is obviously very happy with the
situation there (February 1).
There is, however, a very wide range of abilities and disabilities
among the young physically disabled patients, and the facilities are
certainly not the best possible for all of them.
Staff, relatives, and patients have recently had meetings with a
representative of Greater Glasgow Health Board to discuss the board's
proposals for the future of the patients. The consultation paper states,
''Despite clear attempts to create as homely an environment as possible,
all three hospitals require people to live in a relatively poor
environment.'' (Broomhill and Canniesburn units for young physically
disabled are included in the proposals.)
I entirely agree with Eileen Mirtle that the patients should have been
the first to be consulted from the initial stages of planning onwards.
The most important issue now is that each individual should be placed
in the most suitable accommodation for his/her needs.
Many people have been fighting for a long time for better facilities
for the young physically disabled, a severely neglected area of the NHS
in the West of Scotland. I would hate the health board to think we are
all as satisfied with the present situation as Eileen Mirtle.

BRIAN WILSON's nebulous suggested alternative to Clause 4 simply will
not do. He is expressing sentiments, not a policy. Cunninghame North
Labour Party should think again.
In my view, a Government has a duty to provide basic services -- as
services, not as profit-seeking business -- to enable all its citizens
to have the fundamentals for a civilised life. Basic services start with
water and sewage disposal, gas, electricity, telecommunications, and
public transport -- all the things where it is wasteful and
environmentally unsound to have competing distributive channels.
Maybe the current splitting up of the railways into Railtrack and the
train companies gives us an idea -- that the Government should control
the infrastructure and invite suppliers to tender. So far as energy and
telecommunications are concerned, it might prevent the pavements being
dug up so frequently.
The biggest favour the Labour Party could make to the business
community -- and to all of us -- is to give a commitment to provide this
country's missing link to the Inter-European fast rail network and to
invite participation in the investment.

THE article by Jean Sandison could seriously mislead at a crucial time
when the role of fathers in parenting is being hotly debated by our
elected representatives and concerned citizens (February 7).
Scotland will soon have a Children's Bill.
We are endeavouring to make sure that this Bill does not belittle and
denigrate fathers.
Jean Sandison wrote candidly about her experiences as a mother without
the support of little Jessica's father. She states, ''No money, no
housing, and a bad reputation is a high price to pay for an hour or
twos' pleasure.''
There are about 20,000 children born to unmarried parents in Scotland
in a year, 75% of them have birth certificates containing the names of
the child's natural mother and father.
The vast majority of unmarried parents live together in a stable
relationship. The fathers of these children are just as loving and
caring as married fathers.
Only a very small number of births are as a result of casual sex. We
believe that the mother and father of these babies are equally
irresponsible.
In our view they should both be counselled by impartial and
compassionate, specially selected and trained people to co-operate to
rear their child.
This is the only way to ensure that the child is not disadvantaged,
deprived, and stigmatised. We believe that most fathers will face up to
their responsibilities and grow to love their child just as much as the
mother.
Jessica is a human being who needs two parents.
Jessica's father should be traced and both parents counselled to put
the child's interests first.
That is the very least they can do for Jessica who has a sacred right
to have her own real mum and dad.

IN the article on vitamin/mineral supplements and the Chinese herb
Gingko taken by Gloria Hunniford, she states that she can't isolate what
it is that is increasing her energy levels as she takes so many
(February 2). There are many people like this, knowing that supplements
help but not knowing whether they are taking the right amount or the
right combination.
There are nutritionists now available throughout Great Britain who can
advise as to the specific requirements for each individual regarding
supplements. She admits to taking supplements instead of a good diet
because of her hectic lifestyle. She needs good practical advice to
improve her diet even when eating on the run.
The Herald also reported (February 9) that according to Which?
magazine supplements are not required except for a few minority groups.
A healthy diet is enough. What is a healthy diet? Who is eating this
healthy diet? Is a healthy diet enough in this stressful polluted
society? Studies show that even people on ''healthy diets'' are low in
certain nutrients. This is low in terms of a recommended daily amount
which looks only at deficiency levels.
Intervention trials now show that optimal levels of nutrients (in
excess of RDA but well within safety limits) do help to reduce the risk
of degenerative diseases like heart disease. The Government having
already recognised this, is spending millions of pounds in funding
research into these anti-oxidant nutrients.
Awareness of the benefits of nutrients are not helped by the outdated
opinions of Which? magazine and, dare I say it, the lack of knowledge on
diet and nutrition by the medical profession. I feel that advice on diet
and nutrition, both for schoolchildren and doctors, would in the long
run lead to more prevention of ill-health and less ill-health treatment.

LET us rejoice and convey our heartfelt thanks to this present
Government for their unstinting efforts on the commuters' behalf to
provide us with an unrivalled choice of modes of transport to and from
work. Perhaps it would be prudent to dwell for a brief moment on what
exactly those alternatives really will be, after the Tory triumphs of
local authority reform, bus deregulation, and rail privatisation.
Rail transport will inevitably be more expensive to use, with less
staff and the safety implications which that suggests, and the
franchisee will be under a basic obligation to provide a minimum level
of service. Does anyone really imagine that any social responsibility
will invade the boardroom philosophy of the operator?
OK forget the train, let's grab a bus. Oops! Too late. Stagecoach have
bought them all. Did no-one foresee the creation of a UK-wide monopoly
bus group, with subsidiary companies ''competing'' with one another in
mock compliance with the guidelines?
Get the car out of the garage. Fill up with petrol. Can you believe
the cost of fuel? Of course there is no cartel operating, either
nationally or on an area basis. It is pure coincidence that the price at
the pumps is grossly inflated. Add this to a Chancellor who bales his
Government out of fiscal difficulties by taxing the motorist and we have
a real incentive to travel by car.
There, then, is the choice for the embattled commuter. Of course, if
we don't like it we can always appeal to one of Honest John's citizen's
charters. I'm sure that'll solve the problem. I think I've just
discovered the true nature of a ''triple whammy!'

TWO men suffered serious burns yesterday in an accident at the Blue
Circle cement works at Dunbar in East Lothian.
They were among a group of workers who were trying to clear a blockage
in the conditioning tower where dust is extracted from extremely hot
gases from the kilns as they are cooled.
Whilst working at the foot of the tower both men were caught by a
sudden fall of hot dust. They were given first aid at the scene and then
treated by paramedics and the Medic One emergency response team.
An urgent call to the Fire Brigade was made by the ambulance shortly
after leaving the factory. Firefighters hosed down both men at the
roadside to wash away alkaline dust containing sulphur.
They were then taken under police escort to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary
and later transferred to the burns unit at St John's Hospital in
Livingston.
Mr Leslie Oliver, 42, a mechanical engineer, of Castle Street, Dunbar,
suffered multiple burns. Mr Joseph Renwick, 53, of Crofts Road,
Cockburnspath, East Lothian, sustained burns to his neck, hands and
arms. Both were last night said to be ''comfortable and stable''.
Mr Ross Dunn, general manager of Blue Circle Scotland, said:
''Everbody is devastated. They were just attempting to clear a blockage.
It is an area where the blokes had been working for a long time.''
Officials from the Health and Safety Executive later launched an
inquiry.

As Michael Heseltine clears the way for Trafalgar to bid #1200m for
Northern Electric, Alf Young reports that open season has been declared
on electricity companies
MICHAEL Heseltine's decision to wave through Trafalgar House's hostile
#1200m bid for Northern Electric, without even the scrutiny of a
Monopolies Commission inquiry, clearly caught equity markets on the hop.
Northern's share price soared by 116p. Shares in the other 11 English
and Welsh regional electricity companies (RECs) jumped sharply too, as
bid-fever spread across the sector. But the two Scottish power companies
shrugged off the decision, Hydro-Electric putting on just 1p,
ScottishPower perversely dropping by the same single copper.
The market's reaction was, on the face of it, itself surprising. With
the Government's golden shares in the RECs due to expire in April, it
was hard to see what residual reasons Mr Heseltine could deploy against
the first predatory bid for a privatised REC, without standing his and
the Government's credibility on its head. If markets know best, after
all, who is a mere President of the Board of Trade to stand in their
way?
But even those self-same markets were ill-prepared for just how
thoroughly Mr Heseltine chose to demolish the privatised electricity
sector's first line of defence against hostile takeover -- an MMC
referral.
Trafalgar has given certain assurances that the industry regulator,
Professor Littlechild, will still be able to get his hands on the
information about Northern he needs to do his job. But that is the full
extent of public-interest protection. Market forces, with the full
approval of both the President of the Board of Trade and the regulator,
will now decide the future shape of the UK electricity supply industry.
''Heseltine's lack of conditions for taking over an REC are so
startling that overseas bidders, like American and European utilities,
must already be picking their targets,'' said one astonished City
analyst.
Now that open season has effectively been declared, who, apart from
Northern, will be on the target list, who are the likely predators and
why? The Trafalgar bid for Northern does exhibit some special features
and it's worth considering them first before trying to answer these
questions.
After three years of mounting losses and three rights issues, a
slimmer, chastened Trafalgar is emerging from its own recovery ward. The
construction and engineering group now has a deep-pocketed dominant
minority parent, in the shape of Hongkong Land (itself a subsidiary of
Jardine Matheson), is under Jardine management control and professes
itself a reformed character.
However, one of Northern Electric's main attractions for Trafalgar is
the opportunity acquiring a cash-rich, profitable utility presents to
finesse away some very large potential tax bills. Setting Trafalgar's
accumulated losses against Northern's ongoing profit stream could save
the combined group some #50m in potential capital gains tax liability
from the sale of Northern's stake in the National Grid Company and a
further #223m in unrelieved advance corporation tax in Trafalgar's
books. There may be more savings still.
If Trafalgar lands Northern the Treasury will, thanks to Mr Heseltine,
take a sizeable tax hit. Set against savings on that scale, shelling out
#26m in a #20-a-head promised bill discount to Northern's 1,300,000
customers looks like Trafalgar money well spent. And even at the 1048p a
share initial bid price, Northern's shareholders are faced with an offer
from Trafalgar many will find it hard to refuse.
There may be a limited number of other predators capable of putting
together such a hugely tax-efficient bid for an REC. But, with open
takeover season now declared, there are bound to be other potential
bidders who see ready ways of unlocking additional value from the
electricity sector.
Target No 1 will be sheer cash. The RECs are accumulating so much of
it, many don't know what to do with it. There have been some disastrous
attempts to diversify. Now many are resorting to share buy-back schemes
and special dividends instead. But there's still a lot of cash washing
around in the sector, looking for a home.
On the face of it, the typical REC is ideal territory for an
acquisitive player like Hanson, which announced its own results
yesterday. Remember Hanson was once interested in acquiring Powergen
from the Government whole. Lord Hanson and his colleagues like nothing
more than digesting a cash-rich, low-tech business, fat enough to offer
new opportunities for cutting into overheads and, ultimately, worth even
more if broken into bits.
REC executives protest that they have already removed all the fat
there is to cut away. Reflecting on the well-heeled and share
option-lined lifestyles they have awarded themselves, potential
predators will take such claims with a very large pinch of salt.
Little public attention has been paid as yet to the potential for
breaking up the RECs into smaller pieces and releasing additional value
that way. Each REC both distributes electricity across its territory and
supplies power to individual customers. Some RECs have small-scale
interests in electricity generation.
Even if a rash of takeover bids for entire RECs fails to materialise,
most sector analysts expect significant rationalisation in the supply
business, where competition is fiercest. From 1998 even domestic
customers will be free to chose which electricity company supplies them.
Some RECs, even if they retain their independence, may decide to sell
off their supply businesses to others.
Northern, it is said, was the obvious first target because its
management is relatively stuffy and has failed to curb costs as much as
rivals. Northern was also an obvious first target because it is one of
the smaller RECs and, therefore, that much easier to swallow.
So the other prime takeover targets are the other smaller RECs. South
Wales Electricity. South Western. Seeboard. Norweb. Manweb. Yorkshire,
possibly. The reaction in the markets yesterday would suggest that
neither of the Scottish electricity companies, ScottishPower and
Hydro-Electric, currently feature strongly in the takeover frame. Why?
They are probably too big. In terms of market capitalisation,
Hydro-Electric lines up with the larger English RECs. ScottishPower is
more than twice the size of Hydro. They are also more complex animals
than the RECs, being vertically integrated with a full range of
businesses from capital-intensive electricity generation to customer
supply. They are heavily dependent on must-take contracts with
state-owned Scottish Nuclear, a fuel source which still sends chills
through some in the investment community.
Their core business is supplying a Scottish market arguably with less
potential to grow than other parts of the UK. Their ability to export is
currently constrained by the need to upgrade the capacity of the
interconnector with the English grid. Each is subject to a golden share
currently held, in perpituity, by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
It is clearly recognised in the City that a hostile bid for either of
them would trigger a strong Scottish backlash.
For all these reasons, the two Scottish companies look like low risk
bid targets. But that is only one side of the question. Both would
dearly love to grow faster in the much larger and arguably more
resilient English market. ScottishPower is embarked on an ambitious
diversification programme into retail, gas supply and
telecommunications. But sizeable organic growth in these areas will take
a long time.
Hydro is involved in a number of joint ventures to build gas-fired
generating capacity in the south. But, again, it would like to see more,
quicker action south of the Border.
If many of the English and Welsh RECs are now in the sights of
predators, will ScottishPower and Hydro be scanning the menu for a
chosen dish? ScottishPower was rumoured, at one point, as a possible
white knight for Northern. Even if it has now decided to stand clear of
a potentially expensive contest in Newcastle, what other opportunities
are it and Hydro now exploring?

THE cost of modernising rail services between London and Glasgow
appears to be escalating almost as fast as the 155mph trains planned for
the revitalised West Coast Main Line, and could threaten the
Government's rail privatistion plans.
Conclusions of a detailed feasibility study published yesterday by
Railtrack put the ''initial'' capital costs in the region of #1000m
''for the core investment programme''.
This compares with figures of #400m to #600m suggested last March when
WCML Development Company consortium was selected by Railtrack to conduct
the study. WCML's own preliminary costings last November ranged between
#500m to twice that amount if all new rolling stock including tilting
trains, double decker commuter carriages and ''piggy-back'' freight
wagons were included.
Railtrack played down this apparent discrepancy yesterday saying that
only the latest figures are realistic. All previous figures had been
approximations.
In publishing the proposals, which Railtrack chairman Robert Horton
couples with the Channel Tunnel as ''the most important railway
initiative of its generation'', Railtrack appears to be inviting the
Government to give the go-ahead for the project.
Details have been with the Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney for
several weeks now and a decision should not be far off.
The project would take some eight years to complete although it is
expected to be appproached in stages with the older section between
London and Manchester taking priority.
Glasgow to London journey times should be cut from five hours to four
with 30 minutes shaved off the two and a half hour Manchester to London
service. Radio control would also help increase the frequency of
services.
If approved, the modernisation scheme would be a joint public-private
sector project with private bidders being invited to tender to build and
operate West Coast Main Line which is among the Government's preferred
list for early privatisation.
As revealed in The Herald last December adoption of tilting train
technology will mean going abroad, possibly to Italy or Sweden as BR's
version -- the Advanced Passenger Train -- was scrapped in 1985 after
technical problems.
Ayrshire MP George Foulkes yesterday tabled questions on the future of
the West Coast Main Line upgrade, after Transport Minister John Watts
unexpectedly failed to attend a special meeting of MPs to discuss the
feasibility study.

Nicholas Powell reports how the French Culture Minister's crusade to
protect his country's television from American imports is meeting
opposition at home and in Britain
A YEAR after the fighting to preserve French cinema from US
competition by having films removed from the GATT trade talks as a
non-negotiable ''cultural exception'', France's Culture Minister,
Jacques Toubon, is battling to save his country's television from
American cultural imperialism.
At this week's Bordeaux meeting of European Culture Ministers, which
discussed, among other matters, the EC directive on television, Mr
Toubon said France would ''fight to the end'' to defend the idea of
audio-visual quotas within Europe. France is the only European country
that already imposes a strict quota system, according to European or
non-European origin, on what is broadcast.
Mr Toubon's aim is to persuade his European partners to adopt similar
measures in the form of a directive which would make it obligatory to
broadcast at least 51% of European programmes. In the wake of the
Bordeaux meeting, the EC will discuss the matter again, and vote, in
April. Yet Mr Toubon's scheme is encountering opposition, not only from
northern countries like Britain which have a liberal and
non-protectionist tradition, but also from within France itself.
The arguments behind the quota scheme are similar to those aired when
French cinema felt threatened by the GATT talks and a flood of cheap
imported American products. France's Minister for Communication, Alain
Carignon, actor Gerard Depardieu and 20 leading film makers travelled to
Strasbourg in September 1993 to warn the European Parliament of what
they saw as a threat to national culture.
Depardieu said European cinema was in danger of extinction and film
maker Roger Planchon accused America of planning a ''great genocide'' of
national cultures and languages. French television and French programme
makers want to be preserved from the same transatlantic menace.
According to the Ministry of Culture, the vast majority of French
television professionals favour Mr Toubon's proposals. The reality of
the matter is less clear-cut. The country's two public channels, France
2 and France 3, are officially in favour of his initiative. Privately,
however, programme planners are irritated by what they see as
restrictions on their professional freedom and that of the viewing
public.
France's film industry, based on an elaborate system of subsidies,
interferes itself with the freedom of TV programming. As the law in
France stipulates that no more than 40% of television programmes may be
of non-European origin, television channels frequently find themselves
short of material.
One hundred and thirty films are made in France every year, many of
them co-produced with television companies to be shown on television two
years after their general release. Even if that number of cinema
productions is large by comparison with Britain's, it cannot fill the
small screen comfortably. Television programmers complain of having to
run frequent repeats and show second-rate films on prime time.
Officially at least, channel TF1, which was privatised in 1987, has
adopted a strict ''no comment'' policy on Mr Toubon's protectionist
crusade so long as the latter is under discussion. But like France's
other private channel, M6, TF1 is hostile to programme quotas of any
sort.
A major problem is practical. Programmers at TF1 complain that before
sitting down to plan out forthcoming programmes, they are obliged to
consult computer calculations to see how they are respecting
restrictions on foreign and home-grown programmes. Of the 60% of
European works, 40% must be French. Programmes which combine studio work
and fiction are particularly tricky, as the fiction must represent at
least 51% of programme time.
''It's ridiculous. We spend our time with a stopwatch in one hand and
calculator in the other,'' one programmer said.
French law already obliges television channels to invest 15% of
turnover in production of ''original French works'', which in the case
of TF1, amounts to one billion francs -- around #120m. No more than one
third of that sum may legally go to production companies which belong to
the channel itself.
''That financial effort should be enough without programme quotas as
well. The system is a double constraint. It's as if a newspaper were
obliged to cover a given series of subjects and then told on which pages
to run the stories,'' the programmer said.
Those against Mr Toubon's directive also criticise the one-way nature
of its restrictions: French television channels are obliged to buy
European programmes, while nothing forces EC partners to purchase
productions made in France. TF1 and M6 are now waiting to see how the EC
vote goes in April. If Mr Toubon fails to obtain support for his
television directive, the critics of France's existing legislation hope
they will be able to demonstrate its absurdities and obtain
modifications.

David Belcher tunes in to the first day of Talk Radio and finds it
long on words but short on shocks
SHOCKY-WOCKY pweads for wuvvy-wuvvy from Mildly-Outraged of Pinner:
this was Talk Radio UK's unspoken Valentine's Day message when the
station with a mission to ''operate at the edge of the broadcasting
guidelines'' took to the airwaves.
There were indications during yesterday's daytime programmes that
Mildly-Outraged of Pinner is pleased to have been given another phone-in
forum in which to engage in his or her longest-running love-affair . . .
with the sound of their own voices. Once callers had negotiated Talk
Radio's far-from-reliable switchboard -- and an amusingly large number
of them failed to reach expectant mid-morning host Scott Chisholm --
they were ready to witter on, in deceptively reasonable tones, about the
way this country is going down the pan in a welter of tabloid
stereotypes: from a tidal waves of immigrants to too-soft judges.
Whether anyone other than Mildly-Outraged of Pinner wants to listen to
this is the big question, of course. Talk Radio's cheap-to-assemble
talk-ins certainly offer little that folk with half a brain aren't
already retuning their dials to avoid on many other all-too-similar
local stations. And there was no evidence whatsoever that daytime Talk
Radio is going to live up to its own voluminous hype by offering
anything remotely shocking.
That hype continued to the last moment, with the artful rescheduling
of planned breakast-time duo Maurice Dee and Carol McGiffin when Talk
Radio's overseers deemed them too sexplicitly saucy for a nation's
cornflakes.
Scott Chisholm proved as cutting and intrusive as his mild-mannered
veteran trombonist namesake, George. One of the callers who reached
Scott wished Talk Radio good luck. ''We need it,'' Scott said in a rare
outbreak of sincerity. Anna Raeburn's earnest hectoring is not the stuff
for lunchtime -- and addressing your airwave audience as ''dear
readers'' is confusing, to say the least.
In the afternoon, Tommy Boyd became involved in less-than-fascinating
reminiscences about his childhood home in Ashford in Kent with one of
his guests. ''By now,'' interjected Tommy, attempting to get the show
back on the rails, ''the listeners are wondering 'Am I involved?''' No,
Tommy. We weren't involved.
''Disinvolved'' was the sole word for a slurred-sounding Scot who,
after having phoned to Tommy take part in a trivia quiz, claimed he knew
nothing about anything. ''We're going to try to be real . . . real
people . . . no boring interviews,'' said Tommy, apparently unaware that
non-interviews with real people, conducted without the benefit of such
costly flummeries as research and scripts, are really boring.
Paradoxically, Talk Radio's behind-the-scenes staff seemed marginally
more perceptive. During Scott Chisholm's programme they'd managed to
unite a beef farmer who had been sent a bomb in the post with the
boyfriend of killed veal protester Jill Phipps. What did they say to one
another? Alas, not much.
Talk Radio's ads said less. There were in-house ads aimed at the
advertisers that Talk Radio don't yet have. Ads for albums of the music
they don't play on Talk Radio. Ads for some mystery product known as the
Evening Standard.
Maybe things got better last night with the much-heralded arrival of
Talk Radio's ever-so-shocking shock-jocks. But have you heard a less
wild name than Wild Al Kelly?
And haud me back from naked frenzy about Caesar the Geezer, whose
previous London-only late-night show reportedly had him inciting callers
to take their clothes off. On radio. At this rate we can look forward to
a steamy late-night slot on Talk Radio UK featuring lots of nookey . . .
but only if it's the brown furry bear operated by ventriloquist Roger de
Courcey.
For an expert view of shock-jockeydom, over to Chris Morris, star of
BBC2's iconoclastic The Day Today. Morris's genuinely outrageous radio
career has encompassed his announcement of the deaths of Jimmy Savile
and Michael Heseltine. He has also convinced Radio 4 listeners that they
were hearing live coverage of Prince Andrew's public beheading on
Parliament Hill. At present, he is suspended by Radio One.
Morris's dismissive comment on his would-be rivals? ''Shirk-jerks.''
And, here, listen to me, where would any of Talk Radio's shirk-jerks be
without the British newspaper industry, this nation's
longest-established reservoir of trivia and brainless posturing. World's
gone potty, if you ask me -- which no-one did, but I'll tell you anyway.
PS -- As well as being a celebration of St Valentine, yesterday was
also National Impotence Day. Apt, yes?

THE Scottish Labour Party last night promised to abolish trust
hospitals and bring the NHS north of the Border back under full public
control, laying down a marker against any softening of stance by the
party leadership in London.
Scottish party chairman Jim Devine, who comes from a health union
background, chose a meeting of party members at Cupar in Fife to pledge
that all opted-out hospitals would be integrated back into the NHS under
the democratic control of health boards.
He said: ''Labour are committed to abolishing all NHS trusts and
democratising the NHS. The decision to be taken now is what system will
be put into place in Scotland.''
Mr Devine made a series of unequivocal promises last night, indicating
that on health, as on many other issues, the party in Scotland may want
to take a more radical stance than that dictated by leader Tony Blair.
He said: ''The party will be launching a major health document at this
year's conference, part of which will include the alternative to the
quangoisation of the NHS.
''In view of the importance of the NHS -- it literally does provide a
service from the cradle to the grave -- there is a strong case for
health services to be democratised.''
Mr Devine said the use of public money in the NHS could not be
resolved ''on managerial or professional grounds alone''.
He said one option would involve directly elected health boards, while
another would co-opt members equally between local councillors, staff,
and directly elected representatives.
He added: ''Whatever option or combination of options is pursued, the
Scottish Labour Party will act immediately on taking power and abolish
the one-party state the Tories have created in the NHS. Pluralism and
partnership will be our guiding principles.''
He said that as an immediate step trusts would be abolished, and
interim appointees to boards would be selected from local people,
councils, patient associations, staff, and unions.
He concluded: ''Control of the NHS is in the hands of appointees who
are neither representative of, nor accountable to, their communities.
Such political corruption will end when Labour is elected to government
and a Scottish parliament established in Edinburgh.''

How can the lethal menace of the boy racer be stamped out? Margaret
Vaughan examines conflicting views
JOYRIDE is hardly the term to describe a car journey which left a
woman impaled by the neck on a spiked fence in Sheffield. It has though
moved beyond being a craze with street cred to become a menace of lethal
proportions. It is not confined to the bleak ghettos of inner-city
England. Every night in Scotland's peripheral housing schemes, the boy
racers are polishing up their skills at handbrake turns and
self-expression. In their own souped-up bangers or, more likely, in
someone else's car knicked for the purpose.
Crime statistics are not sophisticated enough to show the prevalance
of so-called joyriding in Scotland where thefts of cars and related
vehicle offences are not analysed by age. At least not publicly. But try
asking the residents of Easterhouse or Wester Hailes or the Whitfield
estate or Ferguslie Park. They don't need statistics to know what is
happening on their narrow streets.
Bored teenagers have been breaking into cars and driving them away for
many years. However, a number of factors turned joyriding into a more
serious problem, including its overt challenge to authority. It provoked
serious political concern.
Youngsters challenging police on the Blackbird Leys estate in Oxford
by racing stolen cars sparked confrontations that led to riots in 1991
and 1992. It was hoped that it was a fad which would eventually fall out
of fashion.
However, the thrill of the speeding car is not the sole preserve of
the reckless, hopeless youth out to impress his pals. British drivers
have one of the worst records in Europe for causing the deaths of child
pedestrians. A British child is twice as likely to be killed as an
Italian child: one in 15 of our children can expect to be injured in a
road accident before they are 16. Invevitably most of these accidents
take place in residential areas.
A few days ago Central Scotland police ended an initiative aimed at
reducing road accidents. It targeted irresponsible, anti-social drivers
whose behaviour was videoed by officers in unmarked police cars. It was
an extension of the video techniques officers in the region used to
combat the boy racers. Then they took the videos home to show to
parents. This time they used them as possible evidence in court.
The initiative netted no shortage of evidence that within the most
mild-mannered tootler lurks the potential demon racer. During the
three-week campaign 767 drivers were stopped. Speeding -- the main cause
of accidents causing injury -- predominated. So did not wearing seat
belts, and defective lights.
Psychologist Dr James Baxter, a researcher in driver behaviour, says
it is not that standards of driving have got worse, simply that there
are more cars on the road. It is, he says, very obvious that cars are
much more than a comfortable means of getting from A to B.
''The problem drivers are 17 to 25-year-old males, as all the evidence
of accidents shows. They are the ones who like to show off to their
mates. They are the ones who will take the narrowest bend at 50mph to
prove how macho and skilful they are and if there happens to be an old
lady crossing, well . . .''
Dr Baxter, who had a full-time job at Manchester University
investigating driver behaviour adds that women don't seem to have the
same attitude to driving: ''Males think driving is some kind of
legitimate means of self-expression. Women and older men see it as a way
of reaching their destination. Part of that self-expression involves
aggression: ''They see the car as a legitimate means for that. The
individual behind the wheel feels cut off from normal social rules.
''You put on your one-and-a-half-ton steel overcoat, get out there on
the road, and you challenge strangers you see and will never see
again.''
His research on the driving behaviour of young males has convinced him
that teaching them better driving techniques is a route to avoid: ''The
last thing you want to do is train them. The best way to deal with
younger drivers is first of all to ensure that any violations are
detected. Speed cameras, however much they smack of the police state,
are helpful in this regard. There is nothing so effective as enforcement
with this particular problem.''
Dr Baxter, now a researcher at Strathclyde University adds: ''It's not
that they are bad people. But being that age doesn't go with being in
charge of a lethal weapon which is a car.
''Restricting young drivers is one answer, we do it already with motor
cycles. Put them in a 200cc bubble car, made of balsa wood, or glass --
even better so that they are no longer invisible and inviolate and
everyone can see them.''
Inspector Ian Dalling disagrees that improving the training of young
drivers just makes them more skilfully dangerous. He is in charge of a
project run by Lothian and Borders Police which aims to improve the
driving skills of young people.
The chance to learn defensive driving skills is, he says, a sure way
to avoid accidents: ''Our own research two years ago showed that while
young drivers form 10% of the motoring population, they were involved in
one third of all injury accidents.''
The new drivers training scheme is theoretical: ''What we are trying
to do is fill the gap between a young person passing their test and
giving them some expertise on how accidents are caused. We try to
broaden their whole driving outlook and, we hope, save lives.''
Young people, says Inspector Dalling, see hazards in a different way
from experienced drivers: ''They will tend to blame bad brakes rather
than look at the real cause which is probably driving too close to the
car in front. They cast around for something or someone to blame when
nine times out of 10, they are the problem. What's needed is for them to
learn to be predictable.''
In the Craigmillar housing scheme in Edinburgh, where community
initiatives strive hard to outpace the legacy of unemployment and poor
prospects for young people, John Lawson is working with youngsters who
have already been involved in car-related offences or were thought by
police or social workers to be at risk of doing so.
The Cars Project is a fine example of what can be achieved in helping
young people who have an interest in cars find ways of expressing it
other than in law breaking. The age range is supposed to be 17 to 25,
but John says most of the youngsters coming on the urban-aid funded
scheme are much younger, as young as 14. They learn, from two qualified
mechanics, to dismantle and put together engines. They also get the
chance to try out driving skills on private land in East Lothian, in old
bangers donated by a local car firm or in cars they have built from
spare parts.
''If they have an interest in cars in the first place, we hope we can
channel their energies into something more positive, more constructive
than stealing cars.''
The project has unstinting support from the police. Said Inspector
Dalling: ''For a lot of these youngsters, there is never the chance to
drive except by stealing a car.  We feel that if they can get a bit of
expertise and are shown the right way to drive, they will develop a more
responsible attitude.''

ROSYTH is to lose 90 civilian posts in the stores depot of the naval
base by April 1997.
This is revealed in a letter yesterday to Mrs Rachel Squire, Labour MP
for Dunfermline West, from Defence Minister Nicholas Soames.
''I realise this will be disappointing news, particularly following so
closely after the decision to redeploy the Minor Warfare vessels from
Rosyth,'' Mr Soames states in his letter.
''Front Line First found we were carrying very expensive surplus naval
stores capacity and these measures will enable us to save some #174m
over 10 years, including some #15m at Rosyth and #21m at Exeter.''
The stores depot at Exeter is to close completely.
Mr Soames adds that Rosyth will continue to store ''heavy and
awkward-lift systems'' which are specific to the vessels to be refitted
there.
''In view of the numbers involved, we have decided to introduce a
rolling redundancy programme at all RN stores depots affected by the
reductions,'' he goes on.
''Staff made redundant will receive appropriate compensation, normally
under the terms of the Principal Civil Service Pension scheme.''
Rosyth Naval Base's trade unions convener, Mr Walter Strachan, was
taken to hospital yesterday after a heart attack.
Mr Bernie Belly, the stores convener at the base, said: ''We have been
expecting this announcement.
''We expect a mass response for voluntary redundancy.''
The naval base is also facing 900 redundancies caused by the removal
of the minor warfare vessel squadrons to Portsmouth and Faslane.

HEALTH Secretary Virginia Bottomley was pressed in the Commons on why
those appointed to top health posts will not be vetted independently
under the reforms she announced yesterday.
She was speaking at question time after unveiling changes aimed at
more openness in the way chairmen and non-executive directors of trust
hospitals and health authorities are picked.
The Government had faced claims by Opposition parties that authorities
and boards were ''packed'' with its own supporters.
Mr Archy Kirkwood, for the Liberal Democrats, told her: ''Some of us
are disappointed that you have not accepted advice . . . that there
should be an independent element in the procedure.''
Mrs Bottomley told him: ''Our view is that it is best to have names
scrutinised by people who are actually involved in the delivery of
health service work.''
* Patients should have to wait no longer than 18 months for any kind
of hospital treatment, Mrs Bottomley told the Commons.
She said the Government was on course to deliver its new Patient's
Charter target from April.
Earlier, her department released figures which showed the number of
patients waiting more than one year for treatment had been cut.
In March 1990, more than 200,000 patients had been waiting more than a
year for hospital treatment. By December 1993, this had dropped to
74,491.
It fell again to 54,303 during 1994. In the final quarter, there was a
fall of 12% -- well over 7000.

THE phoney M77 war is over. It ended at 9.15am yesterday when an
armoured column of earth movers advanced along Barrhead Road on the
south side of Glasgow, flanked by ranks of policemen and security guards
in bright yellow jackets.
Within minutes, a defiant blast of a hunting horn and a cacophony of
whistles and shouts brought a rag-tag army of volunteers rushing from a
woodland camp to confront them, and the Battle of ''Pollok Free State''
was enjoined.
After years of acrimonious debate over the motorway extension, the
first skirmish in what is likely to prove a long campaign was a noisy
but curiously restrained affair. The police set the tone by eschewing
their fearsome Darth Vader riot gear in favour of fluorescent jackets
more appropriate to traffic control; the protesters reciprocated by
resisting them with jeers rather than sticks and stones.
In six hours of hostilities, the only casualties were dozens of elm
and oak trees which fell before the concerted assault of the mechanical
diggers and the chainsaw men. Yet their shattered limbs, and their
massive roots ripped from the earth, reinforced the image of a
battlefield. It was as if a troop of tanks had smashed through the
woodland that has stood for 200 years on the southern fringe of what is
now Pollok Country Park.
At first it seemed the construction crews would overwhelm the few
defenders who had been caught off-guard in their adjacent protesters'
camp. The huge yellow earthmovers growled forward, devouring the biggest
trees like predatory dinosaurs, as the chainsaws snarled at the
saplings. The forces of the Pollok Free State, recruited mainly from
unemployed youths, reeled before the offensive; they were further
demoralised when two of their captains were taken prisoner, and held in
custody in connection with alleged disorderly conduct.
Then, in the best traditions of Hollywood, the 7th Cavalry arrived in
the nick of time, in the form of about 100 children from a local
secondary school streaming over a hill to confront the bulldozers.
Instantly the tide turned, the protesters surged forward, and a ragged
cheer greeted their ''capture'' of an enemy earthmover.
Before the security forces could react, several youths had clambered
up the crane of the machine, roped themselves to it, and unfurled their
banner proclaiming ''No M77''. It was, of course, a futile and symbolic
gesture, and the police wisely limited their reaction to surrounding the
vehicle to prevent others swarming upon it.
The victory chants were as unimaginative as those of football
supporters, being limited to choruses of: ''If ye hate the Glesca polis
clap yer hands''; and they did not last long. A cracking, splintering
sound and a blast of whistles sent most of the protesters scurrying to
defend a tree under attack a few yards away. This one they saved for the
time being -- the earthmover growled into retreat as security men
surrounded the tree to jeers and catcalls from the urban warriors.
The arrival of the youthful reinforcements on the protesters' side had
another, unexpected, effect. At least two dozen security men deserted,
quitting on the spot and walking away. ''Ah'm no' here tae hit weans,''
one explained. In fact, nobody was assaulted by anything other than
profanity.
Shortly afterwards, the opposing forces reached a stand-off. A young
man tried to rally his side by blowing on an alpine hunting horn, but
the notes sounded forlorn. One of his friends shouted sardonically:
''Charge.'' The moment summed up the mood of what had become an
inconclusive contest.
On the adjacent road, an official of the Wimpey construction company
was explaining to reporters: ''As you can see, it's becoming extremely
difficult to progress. We just want to get on with the job, but we now
know we're going to have some difficulty.''
He was interrupted by a protester who reproached him: ''Ye said ye
would have consultation with us 48 hours before you started, an' ye'
never. Ye've went back on yer word, Dan. The community consultation ye
promised us hasnae taken place.''
Another Wimpey official replied that the decision on the motorway had
been taken by the Scottish Office and Strathclyde Regional Council, and
his company was merely fulfilling a contract.
''That's whit the Germans said aboot the concentration camps,''
rejoined a protester. ''They were only doin' their job.''
As the diggers launched another flanking attack, an old soldier
surveyed the wreckage of the woodland with sadness. As a 15-year-old, Mr
Walter Morrison from Corkerhill nearby trained in Pollok Estate in 1940
with the local defence volunteers, the forerunners of the Home Guard. He
served later with the 2nd Battalion, the Black Watch.
''I volunteered in 1940 to defend this part of the country from
Hitler,'' he said. ''Now I'm here to defend it from environmental rape.
I'm also fighting to save our children from the noise and air pollution
of a motorway going past their doors. But the last thing I want to see
here is violence. We just have to persuade the powers that be that the
M77 is not wanted.''
As a former military man, Mr Morrison is aware that he is fighting a
rearguard action. His strategy, as a representative of the Corkerhill
district, is to hold up work on the project as long as possible in the
hope of achieving a political solution.
''This motorway has been on the drawing board for at least 13 years,''
he said. ''It was people like myself at public inquiries that held it
up. Now we've got MPs supporting us, and councillors up for election
will be challenged on where they stand on the motorway, and gradually
it's becoming a political issue. So we're always hopeful.''
In the protesters' camp, a young man with a straggly beard and an
intense expression explains that they have no leadership structure and
no fixed strategy. ''We were going to fall back here and put up a last
stand, but they have escalated the conflict and now we don't know what's
going to happen.'' He added, however, that they remained committed to
''non-violent direct action''.
Dr Richard Dixon, head of research for Friends of the Earth Scotland,
turned up at the camp to lend moral support. His organisation has lodged
a complaint with the European Commission, but he is not optimistic. ''I
think we can win, but it may take three years, by which time the
motorway will be built. This is a sad day.''
In the meantime, the garrison of the Pollok Free State has laid its
defences by ''spiking'' the largest trees in their camp with nails. This
is a practice learned from American protest movements, driving metal
spikes into trees at random thus causing chainsaws to snap and imperil
their operators. In Glasgow, however, the protesters have obligingly
marked all such trees with a large ''S'' to avoid injuries.
As darkness fell yesterday, and rain began sweeping over the
battlefield, the two sides dispersed. The depleted ranks of
tent-dwellers were left huddling around a camp fire beneath their sodden
flags and banners, discussing their strategy for the morrow. Having
established five camps along the motorway route, they are unsure which
will be the next to be besieged.
''We gave them a bloody nose today,'' one youth volunteered. ''Surely
they won't come back here tomorrow?''
If not tomorrow, then the next day or the day after. For in this war
of attrition there can be only one victor. Sooner or later the tree
houses will come crashing down, the tarmac will be laid, and a dignitary
will cut a ribbon to open another motorway.
The only hope on both sides, for the moment at least, is that nobody
will get hurt in the process.

THE chairman of North West Water defended his #325,000 annual salary
and a share option package worth several hundred thousand pounds before
MPs yesterday, dismissing Labour allegations of highway robbery as
misinformation.
Sir Desmond Pitcher clashed with the Committee's Labour chairman
Greville Janner over the use of share options to reward senior
executives of privatised utilities.
Asked repeatedly if he understood the public's concern over dramatic
pay increases for directors of the water and electricity companies, Sir
Desmond said the matter had been ''inflamed'' by politicians, and
refused to answer.
''I don't think the view which has been perpetrated widely is correct.
I get 22,000 letters per annum, 5000 personal ones, almost none are
concerned with share options,'' he said.
The public was being misinformed, and he blamed Labour and Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown, who on Monday released Labour's latest analysis
of executive pay packages in privatised utilities. ''The public are
concerned about the misconceptions being told,'' he added.
Labour claims 145 directors in companies ranging from British Telecom
to Scottish Hydro hold share options worth more than #100m. The figure
was calculated by multiplying the amount of shares held by their value
on Monday.
Sir Desmond angered Mr Janner by refusing to disclose the names of the
companies and organisations which received #60,000 in contributions from
North West last year, saying it was not relevant to the committee's
inquiry into executive pay.
Last year, Sir Desmond was paid #325,000, plus a #75,000
performance-related bonus. For that he worked full time as North West's
chairman, putting in a 50 to 70 hour week.
In addition, he received #1500 a month for the 45 hours a week he
serves as chairman of the Merseyside Development Corporation. However,
he said 45 hours did not equal a week's work and did not interfere with
his full-time commitment to North West.
On joining North West Water, he said, he took a 60% cut in
remuneration. He did not have a company car, a chauffeur, nor did he
receive gardener's services. North West Water does not offer its
directors an executive dining room.
His share option package, which allows him to buy a fixed number of
shares at a low price that he can then resell at the higher market
price, is based on 160,000 shares at 462p, and 54,000 shares at 393p.
Yesterday, North West Water's shares closed at 521p, giving Sir
Desmond a notional profit of almost #250,000. However, he said: ''We
would be disappointed with a director who exercised his options and took
the money. We would expect him to put the balance back into the
company.''
The confrontational tone continued through to the closing formalities.
When Sir Desmond said he ''enjoyed the meeting'', Mr Janner snapped
back: ''That wasn't what you were here for.''

TWO men yesterday appeared from custody charged with causing a
disturbance at the site of the controversial M77 extension in Glasgow.
Colin McLeod, 28, of Burghhead Drive, Govan, Glasgow, and Lewis
McCallum, 45, c/o the Faslene Peace Camp at Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire,
each denied committing a breach of the peace when they appeared at
Paisley Sheriff Court.
Mr McLeod also pled not guilty to assaulting Mark Ewing, whose address
was given as c/o Giffnock Police Office, on February 13, at Pilmuir
Road.
Sheriff Rodney Cairns agreed to release both accused on condition that
neither should become involved in any attempt to obstruct or interfere
with contractors, workmen, plant, or equipment engaged in work on the
motorway extension.
Procurator-fiscal Shona Bowie asked the sheriff to impose a tougher
restriction which would have prevented Mr McLeod from approaching the
site, but when defence agent Alan Miller protested that his client's
right to peaceful protest would be infringed, and that he would be
prevented from returning to collect belongings from a nearby camp, she
agreed to withdraw that part of the condition.
Both men were ordered to appear for trial in March.

PRIME Minister John Major said yesterday he would hold the other
European Union leaders to the pledge they gave Mrs Thatcher in 1985 that
Britain could keep its immigration control system.
With EU Commission President Jacques Santer ready to announce plans
today to ban all internal passport controls throughout the EU, Tory MPs
are becoming increasingly anxious that the British Government may be
unable to prevent the change.
They currently have the support of the Opposition. Shadow Home
Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, said at a Westminster lunch that they were
''implacably opposed'' to the controls being abolished. Alternatives
like compulsory identity cards, said Mr Straw, could worsen relations
between the police and the public.
Government spokesmen were declining to look ahead to a possible
British veto on Mr Santer's plans for legislation which would give teeth
to an EU declaration 10 years ago that there should be free movement of
people as well as goods and services within the EU.
A more dangerous threat to the UK position could come from the
European Court of Justice which has been asked to rule on the validity
of the derogation Britain then received enabling it to maintain its
traditional customs checks.
A senior Government source, asked to admit that Britain would have
only two choices, ''to submit or defy'', in the event of an adverse
court decision, said he would not answer a hypothetical question.
The Prime Minister was asked bluntly by one of the Euro-rebel Tory
MPs, Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North), what he would do to maintain
the controls if the court ruling went against Britain.
Mr Major said he would ''argue very strongly for the maintenance of
that position and will take whatever steps are necessary to that end.
That was a declaration solemnly entered into by all the heads of
government of other European countries. They pledged their words and I
intend they will keep them.''
When Mr Nigel Evans (Ribble Valley-Con) said Britain could face a tide
of economic refugees if controls were abolished, Mr Major said there had
been a very welcome improvement in race relations and he did not want
that put at risk through fears about immigration.
Mr Major also ruled out the UK joining up to a single currency in
1996-97 but again left open the option of linking up later.
''I will make a judgment on what I believe the national interest
demands. If the national interest demands 'no', I will say 'no','' he
insisted.
Mr Major was facing questions for the first time since the resignation
at the weekend of Junior Trade and Industry Minister Charles Wardle, who
pledged on Monday to continue from the back benches his campaign to
highlight the erosion of Britain's immigration controls.

LEGISLATION to reform the criminal justice system in Scotland was
given its third reading without a vote in the Lords last night and now
goes to the Commons.
Scottish Office Home Affairs Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie
announced during last night's debate that the Government's grant to
Victim Support (Scotland) would rise by 11% to #875,000 in the coming
tax year.
The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill tightens up the operation of
bail, gives courts powers to confiscate the proceeds of crime, develops
supervision and attendance order schemes for fine defaulters, and allows
the prosecution to comment in court on an accused person's silence.
Lord Fraser has described it as ''the most substantial overhaul of the
criminal justice system in Scotland in the last 15 years''. Labour sees
it as a ''grave threat to the right to silence''.
Ministers have resisted calls from senior Scottish judge Lord
McCluskey for victims to be allowed to present written evidence of the
impact of crimes before the courts pass sentence.
Lord Fraser told peers the Bill would help bolster public confidence
in the bail system, and improve the jury selection process without
harming the interests of the accused.
He defended the changes to the right to silence as ''a common sense
reform, which will enable inferences to be drawn openly and in a fair
manner''.
The measure would also curb unnecessary attendance at preliminary
court hearing by victims and witnesses.
''These reforms, I am confident, will affect more people who come into
contact with the criminal justice system than any other provisions in
the Bill,'' said Lord Fraser.
The Minister went on: ''The public rightly demands that victims be
treated with courtesy and dignity and with the appropriate compassion
when there has been real trauma and distress.''
Lord Macaulay of Bragar, for the Opposition, described the measure as
''a useful but not exhaustive review'' of Scots criminal law. When it
came to the Commons, Labour MPs would seek changes on jury selection,
the right to silence, the not proven verdict, and the appeal system.
The Earl of Mar and Kellie, for the Liberal Democrats, said his
party's MPs would seek changes in the Bill's provisions for judicial
examination, the treatment of an accused's previous convictions, and on
the right to silence.

FRENCH riot police used tear gas and arrested seven demonstrators at

British firm, Meridian Ferries.
The crew of the Spirit of Independence turned hoses on protesters who
tried to stop the ship leaving port. They later tried to stop the
company's other ship, Spirit of Boulogne, from docking.
French seamen are angry at what they say is the firm's practice of
recruiting crew members from outside the European Union, rather than
using French crew.

tragedies in the Scottish mountains.
Dakon which began operations only a month ago is also close to
launching a a child alarm system, topical in view of a weekend incident
when a newly-born baby was snatched and later returned to her mother.
The hillwalking aid features a transmitter unit, no larger than a
cigarette packet.
Dakon director Mr Brian Duffy said: ''This system will allow rescue
services to track a lost climber even in adverse weather conditions.''
Dakon is to launch its child tagging system in April.

THE Labour Party is bidding to sponsor a race meeting at Brighton on
Sunday, October 1, the first day of their annual conference at the
Sussex seaside town.
Brighton was originally due to stage its first Sunday meeting on
August 13 but the Labour Party approached the track asking if they could
move it.
The Brighton executive have been in contact with Kempton Park, who are
due to race on Sunday, October 1, asking if they could swop.
The two managements are now in discussion as to the commercial
''bottom line'' of the switch.
It is understood that Labour will provide sponsors for October 1 and
the Brighton marketing director Roger Easterby said: ''We would have
expected the biggest crowd for many years on August 13.
''But the opportunity of this unique Sunday with additional
sponsorship gives us the feeling we will have an even bigger attendance
than that, with the anticipated delegates, sponsors, and racegoers.''
It would be the first time a political party has sponsored a race
meeting in this country.

ABOLITION of the mature students allowance from September was an
attack on people trying to better themselves Glasgow Central MP Mike
Watson told the Prime Minister in the Commons yesterday.
He cited the case of a woman constituent Ms Jane Pepper who had given
up a secure civil service job to study for a degree and now found her
benefit worth #5000 over three years abolished. He said the move hit
people who were taking a second chance at education which they had often
missed originally through no fault of their own.
Mr Major told him that the number of people in higher education had
gone up from one in eight when the Tories came to power in 1979 to one
in three now.
Mr Watson said later : ''This is a mean cut which saves the Treasury
only #30m at the expense of a highly motivated group of people.''

SHADOW Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar last night used a direct
comparison between Drumchapel and Bearsden in Glasgow as a springboard
for his attack on the Government over poverty in Britain.
Mr Dewar, the MP for Glasgow Garscadden, drew heavily on local
statistics as he put forward a Labour motion condemning ''the damage
done to the country's social fabric and economy by the rapid growth of
poverty in United Kingdom society.''
The debate took place against the background of last week's report by
the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which said that the gap between rich and
poor in Britain was at its widest for 50 years, and followed exchanges
at Prime Minister's Question Time between Mr Major and Labour leader
Tony Blair.
Mr Blair demanded Government action to address concerns about poverty
but Mr Major told him there were ample statistics to show that the vast
majority of people were better off.
Cheered on by his backbenchers, Mr Major said: ''Average income has
risen by over a third since 1979, the average income of all economic
groups and family types has risen, vulnerable groups have been
protected, average incomes are up by over 10% for poorer pensioners, up
for the unemployed, and up for those in full-time work.
''That is the result of this Government's actions and it exceeds by
far the results of any previous Government.''
Mr Dewar, who opened the debate, accepted that Drumchapel was a
community with problems, though he said it also had considerable
strengths. Only 100 yards away was the leafy suburb of Bearsden, which
was very different.
He told the House that, between 1981 and 1991, male mortality between
the ages of 18 and 46 rose in Drumchapel by 9%, while in Bearsden it
fell by 14%. Young men in Drumchapel were twice as likely to die and 75%
more at risk from major surgery. Life expectancy was 10 years shorter
for men, seven years shorter for women.
Mr Dewar said: ''These are people I know, people I deal with, people
many of my colleagues work with.'' What he found most depressing, he
said, was that those in senior posts in the health service in Glasgow
believed the situation would get worse.
Mr Dewar told the House: ''It is beyond argument that the gap between
rich and poor is widening. The Government may say it is trying to do
something about it, and it may indeed be doing its best, but one of the
most damaging aspects is the impact of Government policy itself.
''Too many people in the Cabinet are still thirled to the Thatcher
legacy and the trickle-down theory (that if the rich get richer the poor
inevitably will get richer as well). I do not believe that is any longer
an area of legitimate dispute. It has been destroyed by the experience
of the last 15 years. Those at the bottom end of the scale are becoming
detached and we are seeing cynicism and alienation to a dangerous extent
in our society.''
The Labour spokesman was challenged over what Labour would do, to
which he replied: ''We have to get the system and the priorities right.
It is not just a case of taking a bad system and pouring more money into
it. Money has been wasted, putting the taxpayer in the firing line. It
is working, tax-paying, middle Britain that has been put in the firing
line by these policies.''
There was, he said, a divided Tory Party and a divided Cabinet
presiding over a divided country.
For the Government, Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley echoed the
Prime Minister's comments when he said that the Tories believed in
helping people out of dependency by giving them opportunity, choice, and
incentives.
The Government's policies were succeeding better than any of Britain's
EC partners but the Opposition believed in ''levelling down'', promoting
envy and encouraging dependency on the State.
Mr Lilley confronted the House with a barrage of statistics and
claimed it simply was not sensible to claim that because the rich were
getting richer the poor were getting poorer.
The income support safety net was 15% higher than the supplementary
benefit level the Tories had inherited in 1979, benefits for an
unemployed couple with two children were 24% higher in real terms, and
pensioners as a whole had higher incomes now than in 1979 -- up 50%.
Mr Lilley said: ''Our strategy is to improve incentives to work, to
raise standards of training and education, to increase the number of
people who are benefiting from them, and to boost job creation and
enterprise.''
During the debate, Labour MP Tommy Graham (Renfrew West and
Inverclyde) made a typically impassioned plea on behalf of his
constituents. He said Ministers would be shocked to see the conditions
in which people were living, created by ''this cringing creature of a
Government''.
He told the House: ''There are many jobs needing done in this country
-- new hospitals, new schools, care and attention.
''Get our people back to work and we won't have to pay so much money
to keep people out of work.''
Mr Graham was involved in a heated exchange with Government Minister
Phillip Oppenheim at the end of the debate.
Mr Graham was trying to intervene in Mr Oppenheim's closing speech,
when the Minister invited him to ''sit down for a few minutes and stop
making those animal noises''.
The Labour MP protested to the Deputy Speaker, Labour MP Geoffrey
Lofthouse, who said the chair had not heard any animal noises, at which
point Mr Oppenheim resumed with the comment: ''I am very fond of
animals, I assure you.''
From the Labour front bench, Ms Harriet Harman accused Mr Oppenheim of
being arrogant but Mr Graham managed to get his revenge later when the
Minister once again refused to allow him to intervene in his remarks.
''Ach, you're a fearty,'' Mr Graham said.
The Labour motion condemning Government policies and calling for
immediate action to tackle the causes of poverty and unemployment was
defeated by 291 votes to 252, a Government majority of 39.

AN aide to Home Secretary Michael Howard caused #1600 worth of damage
after helping herself to an unmarked Special Branch car after a
lunchtime drink, a court heard yesterday.
Janine Barnes, 26, who handled Mr Howard's diary, pled guilty at
Camberwell Magistrates Court to aggravated vehicle taking at New
Scotland Yard last November 25. She also admitted drink-driving and
driving without insurance.
Barnes, of Welling, south-east London, was bailed until March 14 for
reports.
She went out for a lunchtime drink and had a bottle of wine.
Afterwards, she went for a walk and found herself outside New Scotland
Yard where she followed a cyclist through a security gate.
Barnes was not challenged and made her way to an underground car park
where she sat behind the wheel of a Ford Mondeo, which, in accordance
with the rules, had keys in the ignition.
Two witnesses saw her reverse out and strike a Vauxhall Cavalier
parked in another bay, which collided into a second Cavalier.
The witnesses described her as with red, puffy eyes, as if she had
been crying. She hit the two vehicles a second time before speeding out
of the basement.
Barnes abandoned the vehicle a few miles away in Clapham, where it was
found with a flat tyre. She then hitched a lift to Brixton Police
Station where she reported the loss of her handbag.
On her departure she was seen shouting at a police car as it entered
the station, and officers had to pounce as she ran into the busy A23 at
the front of the station and tried to stop the traffic.
Officers concluded she was ''the worse for wear''. She was put in a
cell and there was a short scuffle when an officer visited her.
Mr Richard Lewis, defending, said: ''The circumstances of the offence
are unusual and what is even more unusual is that a lady of good
character committed these offences.''

THE position of the Quarry Benefit Group at the public inquiry into
the proposal for a #70m coastal superquarry at Lingerbay, south Harris,
was challenged yesterday, the 49th day of the inquiry.
Redland Aggregates Ltd propose to extract 600 tonnes of anorthosite
over 60 years from Lingerbay, which is in a National Scenic Area.
Mr Roy Martin, QC, for Redlands, said that having listened to the
cross-examination of Redlands' witnesses by the Quarry Benefit Group
representatives he wondered if they had changed their policy and if they
were now opposed to the development.
Mr Martin invited the Chief Inquiry Reporter, Miss Gillian Pain to
seek clarification from them.
Miss Pain said that she herself was a little uncertain as to the
position they were taking.
Mr John Macaulay, of the QBG, said: ''Very briefly we have not changed
our attitude at all. Where we are being misunderstood is that we are
looking at this in a local context and not in a national context.
''We come from generations of Harris people and hope that generations
to come will be able to enjoy Harris.
''We are not totally opposed to the quarry and at the same time we
cannot say we are totally for it. We are trying to take a balanced view
and look down the middle. We are not opposed in principle.''
Mr Martin said that it appeared from the cross-examination of
witnesses by the group that they were supporting refusal of the
application.
Miss Pain said that, in view of what had been said, the group should
look again at their precognition which was before the inquiry to see
what it said.
Mr Robert Reid, QC for the Western Isles Council which two years ago
was minded to grant planning permission, said it was difficult to know
whether the group were objectors or simply observers. If so he did not
see why they should be cross-examining witnesses.
It was agreed by the group that they would look at their precognition
to see whether it covered the points they wished to make.
Earlier, Mrs Moira Hankinson, an independent consultant landscaper who
was appearing for Redlands, gave evidence on the likely impact of the
development on an NSA.
Mrs Hankinson told the inquiry that her overall conclusion was that
the qualities of the scenic beauty of the NSA as a whole -- the reason
for its designation -- would not be widely affected.
Replying to Mr Colin Campbell, QC for principal objectors Scottish
Natural Heritage, she said that in her opinion the long-term effect
would be ''the creation of a dramatic and beautiful new landscape of a
deeply indented sea loch below the retained rugged hills of Beinn na
h-Aire and Roniebhal.''
The inquiry continues.

A PRIVATE meeting of Gordon district councillors was held yesterday to
discuss the appointment of their former chief executive to a job paying
between #43,000 and #61,000.
The appointment as director of the National Lottery Sports Fund comes
only four months after Mr Michael Barron, 53, retired early following
ill health.
Mr Barron is understood to have received a #64,000 lump sum and a
pension of around #20,000 on his retiral.
He will now have the responsibility of distributing around #1600m
throughout England by the end of the century.
Provost Raymond Bisset raised the subject at yesterday's council
meeting and, in spite of opposition from Liberal Democrat members, it
was discussed in private.
In a statement released afterwards, the council said it planned to
take no action, adding: ''Gordon District Council recognises Mr Barron's
entitlement to seek and obtain alternative employment.''
The statement also outlined the facts surrounding Mr Barron's
departure.
It said that while he was chief executive between May 1992 and October
1994 Mr Barron was absent due to ill health on eight occasions,
totalling 19 weeks and three days.
Council officials went to Edinburgh to seek counsel's opinion and
determined that it might have been appropriate to terminate his
employment on the grounds of ill health.
They asked Mr Barron to attend a medical examination.
However, he passed the medical and no further action was taken.
When Mr Barron took ill again, the council decided to reconsider their
position.
On June 14 last year, Mr Barron wrote to all councillors indicating he
was prepared to consider retiral ''in the interests of the service''.
He added that ''while I am recovering from illness there is a chance
of recurrence at a time when leadership is critical''.
The council offered him early retirement on the basis of an
enhancement of 10 years reckonable service in terms of his pension and
his lump sum entitlement.
Mr Barron was not available for comment at his Inverurie home last
night.

THE future of the Galloway Creamery, which went into receivership last
year, appeared secure last night after a consortium of companies
completed a buy-out of the Stranraer plant.
Its new owners said the creamery's workforce of 29 would rise
immediately to 70, and promised that 100 former employees of the
Galloway Cheese Company would at least be interviewed for jobs.
The consortium, which had previously been granted the status of
preferred bidder, is headed by Scotland's leading cheese distributor, A
McLelland &amp; Son. Based in Glasgow, the family firm has annual sales of
more than #36m.
Its partners are Murray Vernon Holdings, a UK trader in dairy, fish,
and meat products, which exports to around 50 countries, and the Farmers
Creamery Co-operative, 550 farmers who have united to invest in the
venture.
No financial details were released by the receivers, Mr Frank Blin and
Mr Ian Rankin, of Coopers and Lybrand. However, Mr Hugh McLelland
Irvine, chairman of the new company, Caledonian Cheese, said the offer
of Scottish Office grant aid, through the regional selective assistance
scheme, ensured completion of the deal.
He added: ''I believe that by pooling the consortium's knowledge we
can make the name of Caledonian Cheese synonymous throughout the UK,
Europe, and the rest of the world, with the high quality dairy products
expected from Scotland.''

THE Scottish Council for Civil Liberties and the STUC are writing to
opposition MPs seeking help to reverse controversial sections of the
recently passed Criminal Justice and Public Order Act.
Both organisations believe the Act is a threat to civil liberties. It
makes harmless pursuits such as walks in the countryside difficult,
because they could be construed as aggravated trespass.
They claim that the intention of the Act is to intimidate people and
stop them exercising fundamental human rights.
They believe that they have a second chance with the separate Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Bill, which is currently going through Parliament.
They want opposition MPs to put forward amendments to the Scottish
Bill which would in effect repeal some of the more objectionable
sections of the previous Act.
The STUC in particular would like to see the removal of the sections
which take away the rights of prison officers to take industrial action.
So far any amendments put forward in the House of Lords, where the
Bill has already appeared, have been rejected by the Government.

SIX-YEAR-OLD murdered schoolboy Rikki Neave was cremated yesterday in
a moving ceremony attended by around 40 mourners.
The boy's mother Ruth, who is facing cruelty charges against her son,
took her place inside King's Lynn crematorium in Norfolk for the brief
service.
Dressed in black and wearing dark glasses, she sobbed throughout.
Journalists, eager to catch sight of her inside the chapel of rest, were
kept at a discreet distance.
Rikki was found strangled in a copse 500 yards from his mother's home
on the Welland estate, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, late last year.
He had played truant from school on the day he was last seen alive but
his naked body was not found until lunchtime the next day. No-one has
been charged with his murder.
Mrs Neave, 26, sat apart from the rest of the congregation, two rows
in front of Rikki's father, 33-year-old Trevor Harvey.
At one point, Mrs Neave needed to sit down to regain her composure.
She was comforted throughout the ceremony by a white-haired woman.
A white heart-shaped wreath said simply: ''I will love you forever,
Dad.'' There was no wreath visible outside the crematorium from Mrs
Neave.
She is due to appear in court later this month on cruelty charges and
for an alleged assault on a policewoman.

A DOCTOR who delivered a baby which died six days later, yesterday
said he had been unaware of an abnormal heart tracing taken before the
birth.
Dr Steven Bennett was giving evidence on the second day of a fatal
accident inquiry at Aberdeen Sheriff Court into the death of Helen
Allan.
She was born early on March 8, 1993, at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital.
Her mother, Mrs Ann Allan, 33, of King Street, Aberdeen, received
prostin gel as part of her treatment when admitted to the hospital the
previous day, 13 days past her expected delivery date.
A decision was taken to induce the birth and she was given the gel to
induce labour. Mrs Allan earlier told the inquiry she ''exploded'' into
labour.
The baby died on the morning of March 14. Cause of death was certified
as acute lack of oxygen incurred around the time of her birth, together
with blood loss.
Giving evidence yesterday Dr Bennett, 35, a senior registrar now
working at Leicester General Hospital, said that he had not expected the
delivery to have been difficult. He said he would have expected any
abnormality on a tracing taken before he came on the scene to have been
brought to his attention.
''I was completely unaware that there had been an abnormal tracing,''
he told the inquiry, adding that when the baby was born he was extremely
surprised at her poor condition.
Dr Bennett said he did not know why the earlier lower foetal heart
rate tracing had not got to him. If he had seen it he might have started
delivery earlier. ''The management would have been entirely different.''
Glasgow consultant obstetrician Alan Mathers, who studied the case,
told the inquiry in his view continuous monitoring should have been
instigated from the time diamorphine was administered to Mrs Allan. He
said a Ph level test should have been carried out which would have
resulted in Helen being delivered earlier. However, Mr Mathers stated it
was ''impossible to say'' if Helen would have survived if she had been
born earlier.
Sheriff Graeme Warner will deliver his written findings at a later
date.
Brian and Ann Allan said after evidence closed: ''It is our hope that
as a result of today's inquiry other parents will be spared a lifetime
of pain and sadness that we are now left to endure, and that Helen's
death will not have been in vain.''

A YOUNG policeman died in a fireball when a lorry his car had hit on
an icy road burst into flames, a fatal accident inquiry heard yesterday.
His widow wept when she pleaded with the sheriff conducting the
inquiry to find out why the A73 at Newmains had not been gritted on
March 15 last year.
Strathclyde Police Constable Callum Chisholm, 28, died from multiple
injuries when his white Ford Sierra went out of control on black ice and
was pinned beneath the Sunblest bread delivery lorry.
Several witnesses told Sheriff Lewis Cameron at Hamilton Sheriff Court
that there was no sign of gritting on that stretch of A73 where PC
Chisholm tried to negotiate a left-hand bend. Mr Chisholm, stationed at
Stewart Street police office in Glasgow, died from multiple injuries.
The lorry driver, Mr Graham McLeod, 31, of Jerviston Road, Craigend,
Glasgow, said he remembered little about the accident.
He recollected that there had been a change in the steering of his
vehicle because he thought the road was possibly ''slippy''. He looked
at the wheel, then on looking up saw a car heading towards him on his
side of the road.
Mr McLeod, who had an injured leg and cut face in the crash, said: ''I
mind his back end was kinking round. It happened so fast after that.''
His lorry pushed the car backwards some distance and a fire started on
impact.
He leapt through the lorry's shattered windscreen, stepped on the car
and jumped onto a grass verge where he was tended by a nurse.
Witness Mr Brian Connor, 46, of Torgay Street, Milton, Glasgow, was
driving a skip lorry directly behind Mr McLeod at 35 to 40 mph.
He saw in the distance the tail end of the white car swerve from side
to side, spin out of control, cross over to the lorry's side of the road
and hit.
Mr Connor said: ''There was a big ball of flames comming out of the
back of the bread van.
''I got out and started running but began sliding. It (the road) was
pure ice.''
Mr Chisholm's widow, Elizabeth, a mother of three sons, aged 14, 10
and one-year, now lives at Swinton Avenue, Baillieston, Glasgow, after
moving fromCarding Street, Symington, near Biggar, Lanarkshire. She wept
uncontrolably when she was asked by depute fiscal Jim Robertson, if she
wanted to make any point to the sheriff.
She cried: ''I just want to know why the road was not gritted.''
The inquiry continues.

SIR Gavin Laird, the former Clydebank shop steward who has risen to
the top of the trade union movement, received his knighthood from the
Queen at Buckingham Palace yesterday.
The general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical
Union announced earlier this year that he is to retire after more than
two decades as a full-time union official.
Sir Gavin, 61, began his career in 1972 when he became Scottish
regional officer for the then Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers.
He was a member of the TUC general council from 1979-1982 and has been
general secretary of the engineers' union from 1982.
He was awarded the CBE in 1988, and is a non-executive director of
Scottish Television, GEC Scotland, Britannia Life and the Edinburgh
Investment Trust.
Regarded as a right-winger in union terms, he was heavily criticised
in certain quarters in 1991 for his objection to the minimum wage
scheme, which is now official Labour Party policy.
Also at yesterday's ceremony was Lady Brittan, the wife of Sir Leon
Brittan, who became a CBE for her work as commissioner and deputy
chairwoman of the Equal Opportunities Commission. Sir Rocco Forte, the
50-year-old chairman and chief executive of the Forte hotel group,
received his knighthood for services to tourism, but another new knight,
conductor Sir Simon Rattle, kept a low profile by skipping the
traditional photocall with his family after the ceremony.
The 40-year-old principal conductor and music director of the City of
Birmingham Symphony Orchestra was reluctant to face the media after
recent publicity surrounding the break-up of his marriage.
There had been speculation over whether Sir Simon would take his wife,
American soprano Elise Ross, or his new girlfriend, psychology
consultant Candice Allen, but he overcame the problem by taking his
parents and his two young sons, Sacha and Elliot.
Also at the Palace achieving a rare royal double were silversmith
Professor Gerald Benney and his daughter, Mrs Genevieve Holmes, former
personal secretary to the Prince of Wales.
Professor Benney, 64, became a Commander of the British Empire in
recognition of his 25 years as silversmith to the royal family. Mrs
Holmes, 32, who left the prince's service last year, became a member of
the Royal Victorian Order for her 12 years as his personal assistant.

A MAN who nearly killed a goalkeeper in a street attack was yesterday
sent to a young offenders institution for five years.
He used a broken bottle which severed the jugular vein of Robert
O'Neill, 24, of North Road, Port Glasgow. Mr O'Neill survived by
pressing the jagged ends of the gaping wound together until he could get
help. Four months later, he has just learned that another operation will
be needed before he is out of danger.
A jury at the High Court in Glasgow found James Boyd, 19, of South
Road, Port Glasgow, guilty of assaulting Mr O'Neill to his severe
injury, permanent disfigurement, and the danger of his life.
The court heard that Mr O'Neill, who plays for Port Glasgow Juniors,
was walking to his girlfriend's last October when he saw a woman crying
and offered to escort her home. Then Boyd, the woman's ex-boyfriend, ran
from across the road and attacked Mr O'Neill with the bottle.
Mr O'Neill staggered home, blood pumping from his jugular vein. A
neighbour who was a nurse staunched the flow with towels until an
ambulance arrived.
The wound stretched from just under his ear to beyond his Adam's
Apple.
Last week, after an abcess formed under the scarring, Mr O'Neill was
again taken to hospital where surgeons discovered two one-inch square
shards of glass still embedded four inches deep in his neck, close to
his spine.
Next month Mr O'Neill will have to go back to hospital for a delicate
operation to have them removed.
Yesterday, as Boyd was led away to begin his sentence, Mr O'Neill
said: ''I was lucky to have survived that night. I suppose I did help to
save my own life, but all the vital work was done by my neighbour and
the doctors, and I owe them a big vote to thanks.
''Since the incident I have been unable to swallow properly, sometimes
even to speak.
''Now I know why -- the pieces of glass found by X-ray just last week
still inside me.
''I just want to have them taken out, get some weight back on, and
start football training again.''

A GROUP which helps thousands of people to care for invalid relatives
at home yesterday appealed to families to make a will.
The Crossroads (Scotland) Care Attendance network hopes its campaign
will bring legacies, as well as help families avoid the problems which
arise when someone dies intestate.
Television personality Molly Weir, a full-time carer for her husband,
helped to launch the campaign in Glasgow.
Crossroads hopes to raise #10m every year in a bid to extend services
currently provided to 6000 carers to at least 20,000.
The group has a network of 53 local schemes throughout Scotland, run
by co-ordinators, full-time trained staff, and an army of volunteers. It
is ready to step in when carers are exhausted or ill, or just to allow
them to get out of the house.
Chairman Isabel Walkingshaw said: ''Although we find most carers
rarely admit it, round-the-clock caring for someone can leave carers
feeling exhausted and irritable, and as they give so much of themselves
to their duties, they have very little time for themselves.
''Giving them a few hours respite from caring duties can allow them to
do everyday things such as go shopping, have a coffee with a friend, or
often just have a sleep.''
Two-thirds of funding for Crossroads comes from local authorities or
central government grants, but it has to find the rest itself. It costs
#6.50 to provide one hour of care.
With at least 60,000 sole carers in Scotland -- middle-aged children
of the chronically-ill, spouses of victims of Alzheimers or Parkinson's
Disease, parents of handicapped children -- the figure is ten times the
number Crossroads can currently cater for.

A SCOTTISH climber who went missing in severe weather in the mountains
above Glencoe on Friday was found dead yesterday.
The body of Allan Sands, 24, of Torrisdale Street in the Strathbungo
area of Glasgow, was discovered by rescuers after a group of climbers
contacted police on Monday night and said they had seen him at the
2952ft-high summit of Sron na Creise on Friday.
The four-day search had been scaled down by Glencoe Mountain Rescue
Team as hopes faded of finding Mr Sands alive, but rescuers were
yesterday able to concentrate their efforts on a small area of a
snow-covered mountain after the climbers, also from Glasgow, gave them
their first clue as to his whereabouts.
Mr Sands had failed to leave details of his planned route -- which
meant the rescue services had to search a huge area. He had set off
alone with food supplies for only one night.
The rescue services were alerted when Mr Sands failed to meet friends
as arranged on Saturday morning.
About 36 searchers from three mountain rescue teams were assisted
yesterday by four sniffer-dogs and their handlers and a Sea King
helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth.
About two hours after the search was re-started at 8am, the sole of a
climbing boot was spotted in a snow-filled gully. Mr Sands' body was
later discovered and airlifted to Belford Hospital in Fort William.
His parents, Mr Alex Sands and his wife Nancy, who had travelled from
their home in the Calderwood area of East Kilbride on Monday, identified
the body as that of their son.
Speaking after the search, Mr John Greave, the leader of Glencoe
Mountain Rescue Team, told The Herald: ''We really were working on good
information today, but before that we were covering an area of about 100
square miles which made it very difficult.
''However, it was still a fluke that we found him because of all the
gullies up there. I am pretty sure he fell from higher up at about 2pm
or 3pm on Friday afternoon when the snow was pretty unforgiving.''
Former colleagues at the bookstore which Mr Sands managed -- Bookworld
in the St Enoch Centre, Glasgow -- were visibly distressed after
learning of his death yesterday.
Speaking at the store, Mr Martin Thomson, the Glasgow area manager of
Bookworld, said: ''Everyone here is very shocked. It is a tragedy and we
feel most strongly for his family at this time. We are too upset to say
any more.''
Meanwhile, members of Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team who found the body
of Southampton University student Martin Rayner, 22, from Evesham,
Worestershire, on Ben Nevis on Monday night, brought it down the
mountain early yesterday.
Mr Rayner had been anchored to an icy rock face on the north-east
buttress of the ben. The team's safety officer, Mick Tighe, discovered
him after he was lowered 200ft by ropes down the buttress and into the
climbing route known as the Mantrap.
It was there that searchers had earlier found a trail of blood and a
helmet, a torch and gloves. It is believed Mr Rayner may have suffered
two earlier falls which had caused him severe head injuries.
Earlier on Monday, Mr Rayner's climbing companion, Mr Sacha Backes,
also 22, had been taken off the mountain. Mr Backes, a second year
post-graduate physics student in Southampton, was recovering from
frostbite and hypothermia in the Belford hospital yesterday where he was
told of Mr Rayner's death.
* A rescue operation to reach a badly injured climber on Lochnagar had
to be called off late last night as severe winter storms swept the area.
Members of Braemar mountain rescue team were flown by RAF helicopter
part of the way up the 4000ft peak and planned to complete the journey
on foot.
However, police said weather conditions forced the suspension of the
rescue. It was due to resume at first light.

A FORMER RAF policeman told a murder trial yesterday how he saw an
elderly man slide to the ground after being shot.
Mr John Girdler, 48, told the High Court in Edinburgh he had seen the
man run up to the front passenger side of a car carrying a bag.
He said he saw a gun pointed from the car at the man's chest before he
heard a shot fired and the man backed off and slid down another parked
vehicle.
He added: ''I remember he put his hand up to his chest and sort of
looked down on me and he smiled. I thought 'Christ, he has been shot'.''
Mr Girdler was giving evidence at the trial of Mr Robert Smith, 33, Mr
Gerald McQuade, 40, and Mr Paul Bootland who deny murdering retired
mining engineer Mr David Dunn, 63, in a car park behind the High Street
in Bonnyrigg on October 19 last year.
The accused are also charged with robbing a branch of the Bank of
Scotland in the High Street of #185,000.
They have also denied attempting to murder Mr Girdler, Detective
Constable John Duffy, 42, and Mr Duncan Milliken, 47.
Mr Milliken, a former soldier, told the court he had been speaking to
Mr Duffy in the High Street when they saw two men running along the
street.
He said they had chased them into the car park and Mr Duffy had got
one man down to the ground. A car appeared on the scene and two shots
were fired.
''John Duffy said something like 'Go and get that car. It's only
blanks they are firing','' said Mr Milliken.
He said he opened the driver's door. The driver had a gun, he said,
adding: ''I knocked it out of his hand. It went over my left shoulder.''
Mr Milliken said he took the key out of the ignition and threw that
over his shoulder and shoved the driver over onto the passenger seat.
The passenger's door was opened and the driver was hit on the head
with a carrier bag. Mr Milliken said he then pulled the driver out of
the car and ''stuck the head'' on him before punching him.
He said: ''John Duffy shouted 'Man down. Get an ambulance'. I thought
he meant the driver because he had a wee bit blood on him and I said
that he was not needing an ambulance.''
The trial before Lord Osborne continues.

<HEADLINE>Council tax set to rise by 10%, says Cosla</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH council leaders yesterday forecast an inflation-beating rise
of 10% for average council tax bills in 1995-96 and blamed it on
Government cash cutbacks.
Their claim is made in a briefing paper for MPs who will debate next
year's Scottish local government finance settlement in the House of
Commons later today.
The Labour-led Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has forecast
that the settlement, which amounts to a reduction of 0.5% when special
provision for care in the community is removed, also will result in job
losses, cuts in services and increased charges for council services.
Councillor Keith Geddes, Labour senior vice-president of Cosla,
claimed yesterday that the Government was cutting back on council
spending for next year to allow tax cuts to be made before the next
General Election.
Councils were being made the scapegoats for a politically-motivated
policy which was forcing them to make cuts in vital services.
Council tax rises averaging 10% would be combined with higher council
rents, Mr Geddes warned.
Further rises were inevitable as a result of the Government's policy
and would add still more to the burden on tenants already facing
increased council tax bills.
The convention also is claiming that around #2000m of Government
support for housing has been removed from local authorities over the
last 14 years, helping to produce a rise of 464% in council rents during
that period.
Mr Geddes, who will attend the Westminster debate, said that had the
Government not withdrawn its support and rents had only kept pace with
inflation, the average weekly rent today would be #12.30p instead of the
current #27.77p.
''I will be telling MPs that at the beginning of the last decade
Government support for housing was worth #228m with general fund
contributions providing a further #100m. Next year the combined total of
these resources will be just #22m.''
However, when Scottish Secretary Ian Lang met council leaders last
month, he refused to accept Cosla claims or the need for substantial
council tax rises. The settlement for next year was tight but realistic,
he insisted.
He stressed that the spending available to authorities had risen by
20% in real terms over the last 10 years. They must run the services as
efficiently and economically as possible at a time of public spending
restraint.

A BANK manager accused of embezzlement admitted yesterday keeping more
than #11,000 in old notes in the back of his wardrobe.
Mr Hector MacGillivray, 54, who was in charge of incinerating #4m a
week, claimed he inherited the money from his father.
He kept it, plus rent from a flat in Rothesay, for 13 years before
depositing it in various building societies.
Mr MacGillivray, of Thomson Drive, Bearsden, Glasgow, denies taking
#163,000 in old notes he should have destroyed.
He told Advocate-depute Valerie Stacey at the High Court in Glasgow
that he eventually deposited the money over a period of months.
He was embarrassed about having the money because he was in charge of
the Clydesdale Bank's burning unit in Glasgow and thought it would be
suspicious.
Mrs Stacey noted that the money in the wardrobe would not have been
earning interest, and asked him: ''Are we to believe that you came down
from Bearsden with all this money stuffed on your person to deposit it
as a way of avoiding suspicion?''''Yes.''
Earlier Mr MacGillivray claimed he would have been seen by other staff
if he had taken soiled notes.
He agreed with Mrs Stacey that he was reported for taking money 14
years ago, but he claimed he was only changing #60 of his own money.
He also ignored staff concerns when bundles of money were found to be
underweight and short of cash.
Mrs Stacey told Mr MacGillivray: ''I am suggesting it was you who
stole the notes.'' He replied: ''No.''
Mr MacGillivray claimed he was overworked and heading for a mental
breakdown when he confessed to police.
Detectives investigating an unrelated #43,000 theft from the bank were
''shocked'' when Mr MacGillivray allegedly confessed to stealing notes
he should have burned.
He told Lord Prosser and a jury in the third week of his trial: ''I
just made up some stupid story for the police record because of the
state of my mind.''
He told police during a tape-recorded interview how he pocketed up to
#600 a week of soiled notes.
Marked money which should have been burned kept reappearing in
circulation, bank staff have told the court.
More than #14,000 in cash which cannot be accounted for is written off
by the bank each year, the court heard.
After being charged by police with embezzling the money Mr
MacGillivray claimed the bank would not let him get photographs of his
two teenage sons from his desk.
He claimed the bank's general manager visited him in a psychiatric
hospital and handed him a letter giving him the sack.
The trial continues.

KILLER Robert Mone, one of Scotland's most dangerous prisoners, has
turned to poetry.
According to his lawyer, Mr Joe Beltrami, the poetry ''shows another
side to the man''.
Mone, 46, is serving a life sentence for murdering a policeman with an
axe during a breakout from the State Hospital at Carstairs in 1976. He
had been sent to the hospital for shooting dead a woman teacher in front
of her class in Dundee in 1967. The court found he was he was insane and
unfit to plead.
With the help of Mr Beltrami, he has had his first poem printed in a
local newspaper. In Memories, Mone compares his life to the rockery he
is weeding. He admits he would like to undo his life, ''But tendrils
always linger, In the corner of the soul.''
Mr Beltrami said: ''This shows another side to the man. He gave me the
poem when I represented him at Perth Sheriff Court recently and I
thought that it was fairly good.'' He said Mone has completed a number
of poems and added: ''He has reconciled himself to spending the rest of
his life in prison.''
Mone was moved to Perth Prison and was joined there two years later by
his father Robert Mone, who was convicted of strangling three women in a
house in Dundee. The father boasted that he wanted to be ''a bigger
man'' than his son, but was slashed to death in prison in 1983.
Mone was sentenced to an additional six months this month after he
admitted scalding a prisoner.

FRESH controversy over the care of severely handicapped babies broke
out yesterday after a doctor admitted that he had ended the lives of two
infants 20 years ago.
Dr Richard Nicholson, editor of Bulletin of Medical Ethics, said he
increased the amount of painkilling drugs over the course of a weekend
and the infants, who were suffering from spina bifida and hydrocephalus,
eventually died.
Dr Nicholson, who was speaking at the preview of a Yorkshire
Television documentary, said he did not expect prosecution as the
hospitals had since closed and he could not remember even the names of
the families involved.
However, the Life organisation, which campaigns against abortion and
euthanasia, called for Dr Nicholson to be jailed immediately.
He acknowledged that what he had done was illegal -- and said he would
not do it now -- but added: ''I have no way of knowing whether the drugs
killed those babies or whether they died of the diseases we were
expecting them to die of.
''In both cases the babies were in a lot of pain and in those days
each was regarded as inoperable. The consultants had discussed with the
parents the decision not to treat them and it had been agreed the babies
were to be left to die.''
In each case the infants were given large amounts of drugs but weeks
later they were lingering on and the parents had become very distressed
over the situation. Dr Nicholson discussed the problem with the ward
sister and it was decided he would give the children larger doses of the
drug.
''One cannot say what actually caused the death of these babies and
post-mortems were not done,'' he said.
''I think it's very difficult to know exactly what my intention was.
Certainly it wasn't just to relieve pain. It was to relieve the distress
of nursing staff and of the parents and certainly part of the intention
was to bring about the death of the babies.
''Even now I still think that was the most humane thing to do, though
I thought then and still think now technically what I was doing was
against the law.
''I don't think that I would behave in that way again now because
hospitals have become so much more public places and one would
inevitably have Life or SPUC and organisations like it on to the police
straight away,'' he said.
Life has attempted in the past to bring legal action against Scottish
doctors over deaths of handicapped or seriously premature babies, but
these have fallen into the ''allowed to die'' category which the legal
authorities tend to accept.
An official of the British Medical Association confirmed that if Dr
Nicholson's gave the drugs with the express intent of causing death he
would have been acting illegally.
She said: ''It is ethically accepted that you can give terminally ill
patients pain-killing drugs in amounts that curtail life, if it is
necessary for the purpose of killing pain -- in that event death is a
side-effect.
''The kind of thing Dr Nicholson is describing may have quietly taken
place in the past more commonly than is realised, when more births took
place at home, away from the glare of hospital.
''But we are opposed to the practice of euthanasia and we are opposed
to its legalisation. One of our objections is that it could lead to the
situation where it is seen as not only permissible but desirable to die,
and you could have seriously ill patients thinking they had a duty to
die. That could work by proxy in the case of the parents of badly
handicapped babies.
''It is also worth bearing in mind that a lot more can be done now for
babies born with handicap.''
Life's research officer, Mr Richard Garrett, said: ''I would like to
see Dr Nicholson prosecuted. I am glad to know that the BMA is not
supporting him and has said his behaviour was incorrect.
''He has obviously set himself above the law and deserves to be dealt
with severely by the law. Dr Nicholson seems to believe these children
are not worthy of continued life and not worthy of continued treatment,
which is a very dangerous message to convey.''
Life has recently opened a hospice for babies and children with a
short life expectancy, in Liverpool.
In 1981 Dr Leonard Arthur, a Derbyshire paediatrician, was charged
with murder after a baby with Down's Syndrome, John Perason, died in his
care. He was alleged to have given a drug which suppressed appetitie and
impaired breathing.
The charge was reduced to attempted murder on the basis that death by
natural causes could not be ruled out. However, the jury acquitted him
outright. Dr Arthur returned to work but died two years later from a
brain tumour.

SCOTLAND's only black woman councillor has failed for a third time to
be selected as a Labour candidate for the new Glasgow unitary authority
elections in April.
Regional Councillor Neelam Bakshi had been rejected in two other north
side seats. Last night she lost the Wyndford nomination by 11 votes to
five to former Lord Provost, Councillor Robert Gray.
Councillor Bakshi was not available for comment last night.
Mr Gray said: ''I think the party members recognised the extent of my
work for the area over the last 20 years.''
Meanwhile, the chairperson of the council's women's committee,
Councillor Louise Fyfe, is facing a challenge from four senior
councillors in her bid to be selected as Labour candidate for Aikenhead.
All her opponents have already tasted defeat in recent selection
battles. They are district councillors Margaret Sinclair, Patricia
Chalmers, and David Brown, and regional councillor Charles Gordon.
The selection conference later this month has been taken over by
Cathcart Constituency Labour Party, following the failure of local party
members at Aikenhead to achieve the necessary quorum of eight for the
selection process.

THE Scottish Arts Council came under fire last night when it was
accused of seeking to destroy one of Scotland's most succcessful
small-town theatres by leaving it out in the cold financially.
The angry reaction to the SAC's recent decision to withdraw funding
from Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh, East Lothian, has become more
intense and bitter because an appeal against the move cannot be heard
until March 30, its next meeting.
That leaves it much too late for East Lothian District Council to
adjust its budget for the coming year to make up for the loss of SAC
funding.
The Brunton Theatre Trust and the council were told last week by SAC
director Seona Reid that her organisation could fund only two Lothian
theatres -- Edinburgh's Traverse and Royal Lyceum.
Trust chairman Councillor Tom Ferguson said yesterday that the
decision was unacceptable.
''The Brunton serves audiences who wouldn't consider going into
central Edinburgh to the theatre and who may now be deprived of this
facility,'' he said.
The announcement was made despite the theatre meeting all SAC criteria
and operating within budget -- ''which cannot be said for many other
Scottish theatres''.

<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S local government Ombudsman, Mr Frederick C Marks has
recommended that Kirkcaldy District Council pay #1500 compensation and
apologise to a householder for maladministration which adversely
affected the amenity of his house.
This, says the commissioner, would recognise the ''disappointment and
frustration'' which Dr Andrei Hawryliw has endured . . .''
0 The commissioner's decision follows a long-running row over a
single-storey bungalow built by a private developer adjacent to Dr
Hawryliw's luxury villa at Balgeddie Court in Glenrothes.
Dr Hawryliw complained that the council failed to ensure planning
conditions relating to the height of the property and its proximity to
his house had been met when the building was erected in 1992. He claimed
that as a result his privacy and amenity had been damaged.
The commisssioner found that when Dr Hawryliw became alarmed and
alerted the council to the possibility of a house being built which
would substantially overlook his own, the council did little more than
remind the developers of the need to comply with the condition.
The commissioner adds: ''I consider the council's handling of the site
and floor levels for this development to have been entirely
unsatisfactory and amounting to maladministration.
''Instead of taking action when they were first alerted by Dr
Hawryliw, they allowed the situation on site to develop.
''Despite the assurances given, his amenity is considerably reduced by
the extent to which the adjacent house now overlooks his own. It is
impossible, however, to assess the extent to which his position has been
made worse as a direct result of the council's failings.''
The commissioner highlights the fact that his inquiry was hampered by
the lack of documentary records of meetings with council officials on
site and in their offices, adding it was not council practice at the
time to keep records but they now did so.
But he accepted that the council have taken steps which should ''go
some way to prevent a situation such as this recurring''.
Dr Hawryliw, a technical director, claimed that the bottom of the
backdoor of the new bungalow was higher than his 5ft high fence and it
''looks as if someone could come out the back door and fall over my
fence.''
After the adjudication he said: ''I intend to sue the council for
legal fees and for the loss of value of my house which runs into
thousands.''
Last night a council spokesman said that the report had been noted by
the council's development committee.
''An apology will be made to Dr Hawryliw and arrangements are being
made for payment of compensation as suggested,'' added the spokesman.

THE FORMER girlfriend of a Scot linked in court with the alleged
victim of professional assassins said yesterday he had admitted killing
people.
The defence counsel of the American defendant, meanwhile, told the
jury that his client, accused of ordering a contract killing, was a
''swindler and a crook'', but said Mr James MacMillan, the Scot, and a
Norwegian were ''more likely alternatives'' in this case.
The fact that 39-year-old Mr Michael Austin, 39, was a con-man did not
mean he was guilty of murder, Mr Michael Hill, QC, told Carlisle Crown
Court.
Mr Austin, of Inwood Terrace, Fort Lee, New Jersey, denies ordering
two professional assassins to shoot accountant David Wilson, 47, in the
garage of his home at Withnell Villa, near Chorley, Lancashire, while
his wife and two daughters were held captive in March 1992.
He is alleged to have ordered the killing after Mr Wilson spoke to
police about a multi-million pound international cigarette fraud in
which Mr Austin had implicated him.
Miss Beatrice Brodie-Mends, a former girlfriend of Mr MacMillan,
accused in court of being a middle-man in the cigarette deal, told the
jury: ''He told me he had murdered his business partner because he was
having an affair with his wife. He also told me he was his best
friend.''
Miss Brodie-Mends, who runs Tiplers public house in Edinburgh, said
she had known MacMillan for nearly 20 years.
On one occasion MacMillan had told her that he had shot four child
pornographers.
''He was only supposed to shoot one of them but they were child
pornographers so he lost his temper,'' she said.
She said in 1992, after Mr MacMillan was held by Dutch police
following Mr Wilson's murder, she had spent three weeks with him in
Dallas, Texas, where Mr MacMillan had a business.
While they were in a motel room she saw he had a gun.
''It was a Magnum .45, the same as Clint Eastwood had, like in the
Dirty Harry films,'' she said.
''I asked him what it was for. He said he had a job to do. He said he
would only use it once then get rid of it.''
Cross-examined by Mr Hendry Globe, QC, Miss Brodie-Mends described
MacMillan as a ''braggart''.
''He thinks he belongs to the Mafia. He believes he has got Italian
blood in him. He would go and kill now, no problem,'' she said.
Mr Hill said: ''Michael Austin has put himself on the line from the
outset. He is a swindler, he is a crook, a man to whom lies and
deception are stock in trade.
''Not only has he admitted running a major international swindle and
using aliases, he has not denied making a lot of money out of it.
''He is a con-man and fraudster, someone who makes his living out of
tricking others. But, in large, large letters, the fact he is a
fraudster does not mean, however many lies he has told, that he is a
murderer.''
Mr Hill said ''more likely alternatives'' were two other middle-men in
the cigarette deal, Mr MacMillan, and Mr Torre Horgen, a Norwegian, both
of whom had given evidence during the trial.
The trial continues.

RUNAWAY peer Lord Lucan had less than #150,000 in property in England
when he disappeared, it emerged yesterday.
Publication of his will comes amid legal moves to declare the gambling
lord dead.
The peer, who vanished in November 1974, is wanted for the murder of
his family nanny Sandra Rivett and the attempted murder of his wife at
their home in Belgravia, London.
Now trustees for his family have obtained permission from the Family
Division of the High Court to wind up his affairs.
His will shows that Richard John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan, had less
than #150,000 in property in England when he fled. But he also has
property in Ireland which is not covered in the will.
Bankers, Coutts and Co, which is trustee of the Lucan estate,
confirmed yesterday that it had been granted an order in January
allowing it to proceed as though Lucan was dead.
But Scotland Yard will keep open its files on the case. A spokeswoman
said: ''There is no evidence to show Lord Lucan is dead. The files
remain open.''
Whether the legal moves will mean Lord Lucan's son will now take his
seat in the House of Lords is not clear.
Lord George Bingham, 26, a merchant banker, said: ''I do not wish to
discuss that at all.''
He has been entitled to claim the title for seven years but has never
done so. He prefers to be known as George Bingham around the City.
The grant of administration which Coutts has obtained allows it to
administer the Lucan estate in England as though the earl is dead.
There has been no attempt to ask judges to rule that the man known as
''Lucky'' Lucan died sometime between now and November 8, 1974.
Even then police could still charge him if it turned out that the earl
is alive.
Since his disappearance, there have been countless ''sightings'' of
Lucan around the world. He would be almost 60 years old and much changed
from the slim, dark-moustached habitue of gaming tables at casinos.
His family and friends believe Lucan killed himself in the aftermath
of the horrific events of the evening in November 1974.
He had gambled away a #250,000 inheritance, had overdrafts at four
banks, and was in debt to a loan shark at 48% interest.
He had suffered a humiliating court defeat over custody of his three
children, and faced the shame of the bankruptcy courts.

THE home of a convicted child molester found murdered at the weekend
was attacked four months ago, with the words ''Die'' and ''Beast''
written in excrement on the door.
This was revealed yesterday by senior detectives who are leading
murder inquiries in the Southhouse area of Edinburgh.
Two incidents happened last October, the first involving a break-in at
the home of 36-year-old self-employed builder Lawrence Leydon.
Detective Superintendent Alec Brown said that, despite Mr Leydon's
background, police were not conscious of any reluctance or hostility on
the part of residents in speaking to them, although the views of people
varied on the victim.
Police at this stage are keeping an open mind on whether his killer or
killers were local.
Asked about him having died a result of vigilante action, Mr Brown
that agreed this was ''very much'' a possibility.
He added: ''This is an option but there is no particular evidence of
any vigilante movement or any suggestion that groups of local residents
were forming action groups to take any particular course of action.''
There had been a petition raised by residents seeking to have Mr
Leydon removed from his home. That was a legitimate course of action for
anyone to pursue.
Herald inquiries later yesterday found that the victim had applied for
a move to another home outside the area after the incidents, but at the
time had not indicated he felt threatened or that his life was in
danger.
Police said they were not aware of any occasion in which Mr Leydon had
been assaulted, although his home had been broken into and they were
pursuing an allegation from a neighbour that an intruder was armed with
a knife.
The second incident, involving the door, took place about the same
time, said Mr Brown.
Police are refusing to disclose the nature of the victim's injuries
for operational reasons but it is understood Mr Leydon, of Southhouse
Medway, was stabbed.
He was serving two years' probation for indecent behaviour with a
10-year-old boy at a city construction site in 1993.
Since the murder, which happened at about 11.50pm on Saturday, 25
officers have been seconded to the inquiry. They are hoping to build up
a picture of the dead man, said to have been a ''loner''.
Police who want to speak to any work colleagues say four men seen in
the area may be crucial to their inquiries.
Two young men were seen running from Southhouse Broadway into
Captain's Road about 11.25pm on Saturday and two others were seen
leaving the block where Mr Leydon lived around the same time.
Mr Brown said he could not say if there was a connection between the
four, stating: ''The person responsible for this crime may have had to
dispose of blood-stained clothing, or confided in others.
''If anyone has knowledge of this I would urge them to consider it
their public duty to tell the police.''
The victim applied to Edinburgh District Council for a move from the
area shortly after the attacks on his home.
A spokeswoman confirmed that the local authority had been made fully
aware of residents' concerns about him, but said that after submission
of ''a small petition'' there was not considered to be a breach of his
tenancy.

GRADUATE pay and employment continue to pick up but competition for
jobs looks like becoming even more intense with 180,000 students due to
graduate this summer, an increase of some 20,000 on last year.
In its latest report on graduates' pay and prospects, Income Data
Services says that 14.5% more graduates were recruited last year and
that their median starting salary was #13,793. A further 10% rise in
recruitment is anticipated for this year when the median is expected to
increase to #14,000 .
But the growth in the number of graduates looks set to outpace the
increase in vacancies forecast to move up from last year's total of 5130
to 5653 this summer.
Service companies are expected to lead the way in increased demand for
graduates which they anticipate will rise by 12.2%. Major retailers
Tesco and J Sainsbury are both expecting to recruit 100 graduates, up 27
and 17 respectively on last year.
In the finance sector, planned recruitment of 8.9% compares to 19.4%
last year with almost all the high street banks seeking to recruit. The
Bank of Scotland anticipates seeking up to 35, Barclays is looking for a
further 210, Clydesdale 24, Lloyds 89, Midland 100-plus, and Royal Bank
of Scotland 100.
However, manfacturing -- which was the most buoyant last year with a
22.5% increase in graduate intake -- will be a seeking to recruit just
an additional 8.3% this year. This will include some 206 at ICL, up to
200 at IBM, 80 at Unilever and 70 at Boots.

A WOMAN who claims she was the victim of a gang rape is attempting to
bring only the third successful private prosecution in Scotland this
century after the collapse of the Crown case against the three men who
allegedly attacked her.
Yesterday, three judges at the High Court in Edinburgh gave the
25-year-old woman permission to serve notice of her case on the three
men and on the Lord Advocate.
Almost all prosecutions in Scotland are brought in the name of the
Lord Advocate and his attitude towards a private prosecution will be a
crucial factor in whether the case is allowed to go ahead.
The Glasgow rape case brought by Carole X is the best-known example
this century of a private prosecution in Scotland. The Lord Advocate of
the day, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, did not oppose the prosecution and
one of the accused was jailed for 12 years.
Before that the only other successful application for a Bill for
Criminal Letters -- the means of pursuing a private prosecution -- was
in a fraud case in 1909.
In the present case, the woman alleges she was assaulted by three men
who forcibly removed her clothes and raped her in her home in
Dunfermline in September 1992.
Yesterday at the Court of Criminal Appeal, Mr Tom Welsh, counsel for
the alleged victim, said that there was evidence as to the guilt of the
three men.
''The evidence which the petitioner relies on is largely that which
the Lord Advocate thought sufficient to prove the case,'' added Mr
Welsh.
He explained that the Crown had originally charged the three men and
the case was set down for trial at the High Court in Kirkcaldy on
September 27, 1993.
However, Mr Richard Fell, an essential prosecution witness, had not
been present. This was not because of any fault on the Crown's part but
because of a mistake by the police in England.
The case against the three accused was called in Mr Fell's absence on
September 28 and the advocate-depute asked for an adjournment. He also
asked for an extension of the 12-month time limit within which the case
had to be brought.
This was opposed by defence counsel and after Lord Clyde refused to
grant the extension the advocate-depute deserted the case 'simpliciter',
effectively precluding further action on the Crown's part.
Mr Welsh told the court yesterday that Mr Fell's whereabouts were now
known and he was available to give evidence at a future trial.
He was granted an order allowing the woman to inform the three men and
the Lord Advocate the terms of the Bill for Criminal Letters. They now
have 21 days to lodge answers and a hearing will be fixed for a later
date.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, who was sitting with Lords
McCluskey and Morison, said that whatever happened, the court would have
to know what the attitude of the Lord Advocate was.

BRIGITTE Bardot made one of her rare public appearances yesterday to
attended the funeral of a woman she had never met but with whom she
shared a common bond -- a compassion for animals.
The French actress joined more than 1000 at Coventry Cathedral
mourning Jill Phipps, an animal rights activist who died two weeks ago
when she fell under the wheels of a lorry carrying calves to Coventry
Airport.
Bardot, who has campaigned for years for animal welfare, was
surrounded by newsmen at the cathedral. After the 40-minute service, she
waited in her seat until most of the congregation had left.
As she left the building, and was again engulfed by cameramen and
television crews, she said: ''I have come to pay homage to Jill. She was
a fantastic girl. Animal life is as important as human life.'' Bardot
was then ushered to a car which left at speed.
The funeral, which was followed by a private cremation, was held at
the cathedral instead of 31-year-old Miss Phipps's parish church in the
Hillfields district of Coventry because of the anticipated large
numbers.
The family's declared wish that the ceremony should not be turned into
a demonstration against live animal exports was honoured, and there were
no banners.
One wreath was in the shape of a calf and another bore a photograph of
cattle. A huge floral tribute from her parents and brothers and sister
spelled out her name and bore the message: ''To our darling Jill, Baby
Dolly Dumpling -- till we meet again.''
Her parents, Bob and Nancy, hugged one another for support as their
parish rector, the Rev David Berryman, told mourners that Miss Phipps
had rejected hypocrisy and had had a strong sense of right and wrong,
justice and injustice.
He went on: ''She had a vision of what she was certain was a better
world. To try to bring that about, she became involved; she accepted
conflict and vulnerability.''
Her partner, 26-year-old Justin Timson, told the mourners: ''Jill
loved all creatures on this earth and she felt responsible for them too.
She believed that all animals were blameless and innocent. There was no
more caring and considerate person than Jill. We will remember her
sympathy and compassion.''
Phoenix Aviation, which flies live veal calves from Coventry airport,
had promised there would be no flights out yesterday.
Miss Phipps, mother of a nine-year-old son, Luke, died the day after
the firm's flights to the Continent were resumed following December's
Boeing 737 crash in which five people died.

<HEADLINE>Rosemary West is sent for trial accused of 10 murders</HEADLINE>

ALLEGED serial killer Rosemary West was committed for trial yesterday
on a total of 14 charges -- 10 of murder, two of rape and two of
indecent assault.
Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Peter Badge formally
committed Mrs West, 41, a mother of seven, on the seventh day of
committal proceedings at Dursley, Gloucestershire.
Her alleged victims include her daughter Heather, 16, and
eight-year-old stepdaughter Charmaine.
Mr Badge also committed Mrs West on four new charges -- two of rape
and two of indecent assault -- involving two young women who cannot be
named for legal reasons.
The rapes and indecent assaults were said to have taken place between
January 1976 and December 1977.
Mrs West allegedly carried out the rapes jointly with her late
husband, builder Frederick West, 53, who was found hanging in his cell
at Birmingham's Winson Green Prison on New Year's Day.
But she is alone accused in the two indecent assault charges.
Mrs West was formally committed to stand trial at Bristol Crown Court,
as the area court. But it is likely that she will face trial either at
the Old Bailey or at Winchester. She will stand trial on nine charges of
murder relating to the remains of young women found in the house and
garden at her home in Cromwell Street, Gloucester, last year.
One of the victims allegedly found in the garden was Heather, who
disappeared in 1987.
The tenth murder charge concerns Charmaine, whose remains were
uncovered at the Wests' previous home in Midland Road, Gloucester.
All the murders are alleged to have taken place between 1970 and 1987.
At a brief second hearing, after Mrs West was committed for trial, the
Crown formally dropped two rape charges. Each charge accused Mrs West
and a named man of raping a girl.
The men accused with Mrs West, Mr William Smith, 68, of Southgate
Street, and Mr Whitley Purcell, 64, of Linden Road, both Gloucester,
were discharged by Mr Badge, and walked from the court.
Mrs West was remanded in custody again to Pucklechurch Remand Centre.
After the hearing, defence solicitor Leo Goatley told reporters: ''Mrs
West maintains her innocence. She strenuously denies all the charges
against her.''
Defence lawyers would seek a judicial review of Mr Badge's decision to
commit Mrs West for trial, on the grounds of prejudicial and unfair
press coverage, he said.
He had visited Mrs West and her morale was ''pretty reasonable'', Mr
Goatley said.
She was prepared for all likely scenarios and was not unduly
disappointed by yesterday's ruling.
But the evidence against her was flimsy, Mr Goatley added.
Detective Superintendent John Bennett, the officer leading the
Cromwell Street inquiry, said afterwards: ''The investigation is still
continuing and case papers for the trial will now be prepared.''
He appealed to the media to respect the privacy of relatives and
victims.
Mr Badge ruled that there was a case for Mrs West to answer before a
Crown Court jury after hearing six days of Crown and defence
submissions.
The proceedings brought national and international media attention to
Dursley, a small factory town which nestles in the lee of the Cotswolds.
Satellite dishes from international broadcasting organisations have
been daily beaming detailed reports of the proceedings overseas.

MORE than 90% of people hit by food poisoning in an outbreak in West
Lothian last May had drunk milk from Redhouse Dairy at Blackburn, a
witness told Linlithgow Sheriff Court yesterday.
Mr Crawford Morgan, 38, environmental health services manager with
West Lothian District Council, said this was of ''major epidemiological
significance''.
Mr Morgan was giving evidence in the trial of Mr Robert Haston, 42,
and his wife, Margaret, 40, of Marbert House, Redhouse Dairy, who trade
as R &amp; M Haston.
They deny three charges under the 1990 Food Safety Act which allege
they sold milk unfit for human consumption and contaminated with E-coli
0157 organisms.
Mr Morgan said the epidemiological evidence ''proved beyond any doubt
whatsoever that the food poisoning in West Lothian was definitely the
result of milk supplied by Haston''.
He said that when he visited the dairy on May 20 he found an undated
thermograph chart which was not clear and did not help him to follow the
pasteurisation process. Mr Haston was unable to produce other charts,
but did so on May 23 and May 31, including one found in a bucket.
Mr Morgan said that 14 samples were taken at the dairy by a colleague
and these revealed two positive findings of E-coli 0157. They were found
on pipework leading into the bottling machine and a bottle machine
rubber.
No trace of E-coli 0157 was found in milk from the dairy.
Cross-examined by Mr Patrick Wheatley, solicitor-advocate, defending,
Mr Morgan was challenged he did not have full information about the
pasteurisation. He replied he was satisfied he had the expertise to give
the opinions he had.
A total of 69 people were affected in the outbreak. Two-year-old Clare
Davison, of Bathgate, died.
The trial before Sheriff John Young continues.

IT is perhaps a little early to warn Hollywood that ''the Jocks are
coming'' but this morning you can forget your Four Weddings, your
Forrest Gumps, and your Pulp Fictions -- because Scotland is up for an
Oscar.
Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life, written and directed by Glasgow
actor Peter Capaldi, is nominated in the Academy Awards' live action
short film section.
It's the first time since 1960 -- when John Grierson and Hillary
Harris picked up a statuette for the Clydeside shipbuilding documentary,
Seaward The Great Ships -- that a purely Scottish film has achieved the
distinction.
The 25-minute comedy drama, which stars Richard E. Grant and Capaldi's
wife, Elaine Collins, was made in 1993 as part of the BBC
Scotland/Scottish Film Production Fund Tartan Shorts series. It has gone
on to great critical acclaim and has won national and Scottish BAFTA
Awards.
In its Oscar section, it is up against four other shorts.
Last night, speaking in Glasgow, Mr Capaldi said: ''It hasn't really
sunk in yet. I am just really happy, obviously. I never expected it to
happen but I'm grateful that my wee film has gone this far.''
He doubted, however, if it could actually pick up the Oscar. The
American competition, he said, would be much more intense.
According to the Scottish Film Council's records, the only other Scot,
apart from Grierson, to pick up an Oscar in the awards' 67-year history
was screenwriter Neil Patterson for his script for Room At The Top in
1959.
Two other British films have become serial nominees. Four Weddings and
a Funeral is listed in the best picture category and best original
screenplay (for Richard Curtis). Hugh Grant fails to gain a nomination
for best actor.
The yet to be seen movie adaptation of Alan Bennett's The Madness of
King George is nominated in the best actor category (for Nigel
Hawthorne), best supporting actress (for Helen Mirren), best adapted
screenplay (for Bennett himself), and best art direction.
Other British nominees include Miranda Richardson (best actress for
Tom and Viv), Paul Scofield (best supporting actor for Quiz Show),
Rosemary Harris (for Tom and Viv), and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (best
make-up).
In the big picture, this year's Oscars would appear to be a
head-to-head contest between the saccharine sweet comedy Forrest Gump
and the designer mayhem of Pulp Fiction.
Gump is nominated in 13 categories including best film, best actor
(Tom Hanks who won last year with Philadelphia), best supporting actor
(Gary Sinise), and best director (Robert Zemeckis)

AN English college has become the first institution outside Scotland
to be awarded contracts to provide an education service for Scottish
prisons.
Stoke-on-Trent Further Education College will be responsible for
providing pre-further and higher education courses, ranging from adult
literacy and evening classes to Highers and Scotvec vocational modules,
at Saughton, Cornton Vale, and Glenochil prisons.
It will take over the Cornton Vale and Glenochil contracts from
Clackmannan College in Alloa, and the Saughton contract from Stevenson
College in Edinburgh.
The other contracts went to Scottish colleges which had traditionally
provided the service.
Motherwell College had six successful bids, including one to run the
service at Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow.
The Scottish Prison Service had put its education services in 19
establishments out to tender as part of the Government's policy to
introduce competition into the public sector.
The new contracts, which are valued at #1.5m, will come into effect in
April and will run for five years.
The successful tenders will replace staff in each case.
The director of Stoke-on-Trent College, Mr Neil Preston, said
yesterday: ''The fact that the Scottish Prison Service has awarded the
college a contract in three prisons reflects the confidence it had in
the quality of our bid.''
However, the principal of Clackmannan College, Mr John Taylor, said:
''We are quite shocked that we did not retain the contracts.''

EDUCATION authority chiefs confirmed last night that the headmaster of
a Stirlingshire primary school had been suspended, following an
allegation that he taped up the mouth of a talkative pupil.
The boy, Graeme Anderson, 10, alleged the incident happened last week
at Carmuirs Primary School, Falkirk, where headmaster Alex Christie was
standing in for an absent teacher.
Central Regional Council's director of education, Ms Maggie Allan,
said an inquiry was underway, and Mr Chistie could later face a
disciplinary hearing.
She said: ''A full internal investigation of the incident will now
take place, and we'll review the situation when the outcome of this is
known.
''I'd like to assure parents that this incident is being taken very
seriously, and any appropriate action will be taken.''
Mr Christie was suspended on Monday, after the boy's parents went to
the police. A police spokesman said the complaint was being
investigated.
Graeme, of Camelon, Falkirk, told his mother that Mr Christie had
punished him by covering his mouth with sticking tape and making him
stand in front of the class for 10 minutes after catching him talking.
Mr Christie was not available for comment yesterday.

<HEADLINE>Archdiocese plans #3.5m land sale Catholic church seeks planning permission for retail development on 11-acre site</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Archdiocese of Glasgow, which is #6m in the red, has put together
a powerful case to gain planning permission for an 11-acre site it hopes
to sell off for #3.5m. The Catholic Church plans to sell the land in the
East End of Glasgow to B &amp; Q.
An application by the archdiocese for retail planning permission will
be considered on February 28 by Glasgow District Council. However, the
meeting will consider an application for a similar development on a
council owned site nearby at the old Kenmuir refuse tip.
The archdiocese's arguments are contained in a confidential document
prepared for Cardinal Winning, a copy of which has been obtained by The
Herald.
While the church is anxious to secure planning permission, a
memorandum to Cardinal Winning from John Rafferty, the church's director
of development, notes that the Cardinal wishes to be assured that ''in
any analysis of the relative merits of both applications it can be
clearly demonstrated that our proposals are of direct benefit to the
community as well as yielding funds for the archiocese''
Mr Rafferty, former chief executive of the Scottish Foundation for
Economic Development who was headhunted by the church to oversee its
cost-cutting strategy, concludes: ''I have no hesitation in stating that
this fair and objective analysis will inevitably conclude that our
proposals have far greater benefits to the city than that submitted for
the district council's own land.''
The report says the archdiocese's Dalbeth site is clearly the most
suitable through a combination of location, lack of serious
ground/contamination problems, availability and the clear opportunity to
act as a catalyst to substantial economic benefit to the East End.
It says: ''Immediately adjacent to the Cambuslang Investment Park
Development, Dalbeth will act as a catalyst to wider economic
development and support the substantial public sector investment already
made at this key area for the economic regeneration in the East End of
Glasgow.
''The Kenmuir tip site appears to have potentially serious ground
condition problems which could render development physically and
economically unviable.
''Investors are becoming ever more concerned with the effect that
contamination or alleged contamination could have on the long-term
capital value of property investments.
''Even if the Kenmuir tip side could be proved to be capable of
reclamation in technical terms and even if the cost could be justified
in commercial terms, we would have very strong reservations regarding
the readiness of funding institutions to invest in this site. This is a
very major potential constraint and must not be underestimated.''
The report says the Dalbeth site is in two partnerships, with a clear
agreement in place on a disposal strategy. A developer has been
appointed and development can be guaranteed to take place very quickly
after receipt of planning.
The report adds: ''Part of the Kenmuir tip site is designated as open
space. It has been held in other planning applications that where
alternative suitable sites exist it is not desirable to allow
development of open space.''
Development of Kenmuir may result, it says, in the closure or
relocation of existing business with established jobs lost. Development
at Dalbeth, however, would bring new life into a vacant unproductive
site.
The report concludes that the wider economic benefits of developing
Dalbeth is a powerful argument. The benefit will be to the East End as a
whole, ''not a small number of private individuals who could reap
significant windfall financial returns.
''Development at Dalbeth both enhances and underpins the #45m to #50m
of public assistance. The focus approach to urban regeneration in the
East End must not be dissipated for short-term objectives. There can be
no doubt that the Dalbeth site is the most appropriate location for this
major investment.''
A church spokesman said last night that he anticipated that it would
be granted a hearing to put its arguments.
There was no row between the archdiocese and the district council, he
said. ''We are anxious that the powerful economic arguments form part of
a mature debate.''

THE King's Own Scottish Borderers yesterday celebrated their return to
Edinburgh after a three-year stint operating as the reserve battalion in
Northern Ireland.
The regiment left for Belfast under sentence of amalgamation with the
Royal Scots, but this was rescinded in February 1993. They were there
for the cease-fires by republican and loyalist paramilitaries.
Commanding officer Lieutenant John Cooper said he warmly welcomed both
developments. ''We are pleased to remain as we are, as one of only five
regiments who have not been amalgamated,'' he said.
''The lack of a perceivable threat in Northern Ireland made everyone
much more relaxed and extremely happy,'' he added. ''Any ceasefire is
welcomed by all parties.''
The regiment, traditionally recruited from Lanarkshire and the
Borders, were stationed in Lancashire but half their force was deployed
in South Armagh.
Over the next few months they will carry out various ceremonial duties
and retraining, including exchange visits with units from the US and
Australia. In October they are due to return for a six-month posting in
West Belfast.

BRITAIN'S bid to block the removal of passport controls could end up
on the agenda of the Maastricht 2 negotiations next year, it emerged
last night.
On the eve of European Commission president Jacques Santer's expected
statement that the EU is getting serious about abolishing immigration
checks, there was renewed speculation that other member states -- fed up
with British backtracking -- will simply put off major decisions until
after the next UK General Election.
Other issues such as UK doubts about a single European currency in
1997 (which is not part of the negotiation), retention of the national
veto in the Council of Ministers and an eventual British embrace of the
Maastricht Social Chapter could also be put on the back burner until a
more Euro-friendly government is installed in Westminster.
The first clue came late last week when German government officials
remarked privately in Washington that the real negotiation of Maastricht
2 will probably not begin until some time in 1997. The hint was dropped
in the background of talks between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a
keen federalist, and US President Bill Clinton.
Mr Major, desperately swimming against the tide of European
integration, must go to the polls not later than April, 1997.
Other EU leaders who support a more unified approach to Maastricht's
goal of ''ever closer union'' have now wakened up to the fact that the
simplest way of removing the log-jam of obstacles put up by Britain is
to outlast the Conservative government.
Dr Kohl evidently believes Maastricht 2 might not be agreed until
1998.
This strategy carries the obvious risk of assuming that the Tories
will be defeated. Should the plan backfire and Conservatives were
returned for a fifth consecutive term, Mr Major would be in a greatly
strengthened position.
Mr Santer's remarks today will be made to the European Parliament at
its monthly plenary in Strasbourg.
The removal of passport controls, intended to oil the wheels of the
European single market, is given only passing mention in the
Commission's 1995 work programme which he will present formally to
Euro-MPs for their consideration.
The critical passage gives a short paragraph to the subject which
states: ''Free movement of persons. Freedom to travel, practical
application of the principle of the elimination of border controls,
adaptation of secondary legislation.''
But it appears to confirm that the Commission will later this year
bring forward a proposed directive which would remove from all EU
citizens the need to use a passport when travelling inside the Union.
This means in theory that someone travelling by air from, for example,
Glasgow or Edinburgh to any European Union destination should not be
required to produce a passport.
The corollary is that immigration controls on non-EU visitors will be
strengthened at all external borders of the Union including ports and
airports.
It is this prospect which caused the resignation last week of junior
minister Charles Wardle who foresaw the possibility of up to 15 million
people entering Britain illegally through the Euro-back door.
Mr Major has threatened to veto such a directive if it overrides
national safeguards at external border controls negotiated by Mrs
Thatcher at the Luxembourg inter-governmental conference of 1985 which
led to the single market.
Most EU states see this as just another example of British
Conservatives reacting to their Eurosceptics.
The European Parliament's big socialist group, dominated by British
Labour Euro-MPs, last night signalled it was closer to Mr Santer than to
the UK Government on the issue.
Group leader Mrs Pauline Green, a London Labour Euro-MP, said rumours
of ''unabated'' immigration put about by Tory Euro-sceptics were a
travesty of the truth.
''There is not a single state of the European Union which believes in
unabated immigration,'' she said, adding that control at the external
borders of EU states could be adequately administered by the use of
separate channels for EU citizens and non-EU citizens.
She added that when the so-called Schengen countries -- EU member
states with internal borders -- abolish frontier controls later this
year, the other member states would gain confidence in the system and
show the Eurosceptics were wrong.
''Moving steadily along this road is the right way,'' Mrs Green said.

A POLITICAL row erupted yesterday over a multi-million pound plan to
resolve the chronic housing problem which exists in Stirling district,
particularly in its small rural communities.
The Conservative-run council is negotiating a #40m package with
Scottish Homes which, if successful, will result in the construction of
250 new homes throughout the district over the next two years.
But the deal still remains very much at the ''discussion stage'' and,
according to a source at the national housing body, could take months
before anything is finalised.
However, this did not prevent the local authority from announcing the
plan yesterday, a move which has angered Labour opposition councillors,
who claimed it smacked of ''blatant electioneering''.
Councillor Gillie Thomson, leader of the Labour group, admitted he was
totally unaware of the proposal and that nothing had come before the
council seeking its approval.
He also questioned the council's contribution towards the Scottish
Homes package -- said to be more than #25m over two years -- arguing
that Stirling's current housing commitment only amounted to #8m a year
and well short of the monies required.
''It seems rather strange that the Tories announce the plan now --
only a few months before elections to the new unitary authority take
place -- and particularly as the deal is far from finalised,'' he said.
A district council spokesman said later that Stirling's contribution
involved monies being spent on repairs and improvements and would be met
through additional funds being made available by the Government.
Councillor Helen Scott, chairman of the housing committee, pointed out
that the plan would reaffirm the investment partnership between the
council and Scottish Homes which was formally established almost two
years ago.
She explained: ''It has been a remarkably successful partnership and
we want to make it even better by identifying a new set of key projects
and initiatives that the district council and Scottish Homes will be
pursuing over the next two years.''
Stirling is confident that Scottish Homes will invest #11m with #9m
coming from the private sector. But a spokesman for Scottish Homes
yesterday declined to comment on the figures.
Under the plan, it is hoped to improve the quality and variety of new
homes in Callander, Drymen, Gartmore, Fallin, Cowie, Plean, Aberfoye,
Buchlyvie, and five sites in Stirling.
''We will do all we can to get more housing built throughout the
district,'' Councillor Scott continued. ''Houses of all shapes and
sizes, houses for rent and houses for sale to meet everyone's needs.
''The new plan will be agreed in the next few weeks once we have
finalised the details,'' she said.

SCOTLAND'S top hurdler, Ken Campbell, is taking the optimistic view
that things can only improve after a run of bad luck which ended with
his car being broken into twice in the same day.
The 22-year-old Edinburgh Southern Harrier, who is the only Scot ever
to reach a Commonwealth Games sprint hurdles final, completed his
studies in construction technology last summer but was made redundant
three weeks ago.
Then, in the AAA Indoor Championships at Birmingham a fortnight ago,
he fell and injured his heel at the last flight in the semi-final as he
looked certain to qualify.
However, things improved enough to persuade him to hire a car and
drive from his Edinburgh home more than 300 miles to Northampton for a
training weekend.
On Sunday morning when he went out to his Fiat Tipo in the hotel car
park he found the side window had been smashed and the stereo stolen.
''That immediately cost me #100 because I was liable for the first
#100 of the hire company's insurance,'' he said.
Campbell contacted the police and hire company, and his injury held
out to enable him to complete the day's training before heading north.
During his weekend he had undergone biomechanic testing and each
athlete had been given a video of their performance. On arrival in
Edinburgh he headed straight to the Leith home of his coach, Stuart
Webster, to show him the video.
''When I came out I found that someone had punched out the blocked up
and taped-up window and stolen my bag from the car. Fortunately my
spikes were in the same bag as the video which I took into Stuart's
house. The bag which was stolen held all my casual clothes.
''They say bad luck comes in threes but this is ridiculous, although I
suppose it is best to get everything past in one go.''
After lowering the Scottish 110m hurdles record twice in 24 hours at
Victoria, Campbell is setting his sights on this summer's AAA
Championships.
''If Colin Jackson and Tony Jarrett enter then we will basically be
fighting for third place, and whoever succeeds will be picked for the
World Championships.''

<TEXT>
THE Western Isles Council last night decided by 15 votes to nine to
defer approval of a #4.5m supermarket to be built by the Co-operative
Wholesale Society on the Macaulay Road playing field in Stornoway.
When the outline planning application came before the development
services committee two weeks ago it was approved unanimously, despite
objections from local groups, including the Western Isles Chamber of
Commerce.
The Co-op has given an undertaking that it will provide an alternative
playing field.
However, Mr Callum Ian Macmillan moved an amendment to defer
consideration and appoint a sub-committee to discuss alternative sites
with the Co-op.
He said concern had been expressed in the community, particularly from
youth groups and local residents, regarding the location and the loss of
open space. He felt further information was required.
Councillor Al Macrae, who seconded Mr Macmillan, said: ''Deferring it
will show that democracy is still alive and well in this chamber. I
object to us being rail-roaded into making a decision.''
Convener Donald M Mackay said he was surprised at the comments being
made.
0 He said: ''When Presto's came I was told about the serious effect it
would have on the shops in Stornoway. The only effect it had was on the
shops in the rural areas. I do not see the playing field being used that
often.'
However, Councillor Donald Murray said it was used every weekend. He
also felt there were going to be traffic problems despite the fact the
police had no objections.

A CANADIAN whose alleged actions forced a KLM jumbo jet to divert to
Glasgow while en route from Amsterdam to Toronto was yesterday sent to a
hospital for further examination when he appeared in custody before a
sheriff.
Sheriff James Spy took the case in Paisley's Mill Street police
headquarters after 47-year-old Raymond Reimneitz, of Amherstburg,
Ontario, was arrested at Glasgow Airport on Monday.
During his brief appearance on petition, Mr Reimneitz made no plea or
declaration.
He is alleged to have conducted himself in a disorderly manner and
committed a breach of the peace on board the Boeing 747 which was
diverted to Glasgow in mid flight.
The charge claims he contravened the Air Navigation Order of 1989 by
committing a reckless or negligent act in a manner likely to endanger
the aircraft or those on board.
It is claimed he forced open the cockpit door, repeatedly entered the
cockpit and demanded that the pilot vacate his seat -- and attempted to
speak to passengers via the aircraft's intercom system.
Mr Reimneitz is expected to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court again next
week.

A CHILDREN's crusade brought the most serious day of skirmishing so
far between M77 protesters and builders Wimpey to a close last night
when more than 100 local schoolchildren invaded a site of tree-felling
next to the protesters' Pollok Estate camp.
Wimpey moved a squad of tree fellers, protected by a cordon of 150
security guards, into the area at 9.30 yesterday morning in the biggest
operation since work began two weeks ago.
Two hundred police officers, backed by the force helicopter, took up
position approximately thirty minutes later after a number of
protesters, enraged at what they saw as a ''surprise raid'', tried to
rush the workers who were chopping down trees on land just yards from
their camp.
Roads were blocked off in the operation, which some of the protesters
called heavy-handed.
A number of green activists made repeated attempts to penetrate the
security cordon thrown up by Securiguard, the company contracted by
Wimpey to provide protection on the #53.6m contract.
The protesters managed to persuade 26 of the security guards to leave
the cordon and resign their jobs.
Early clashes resulted in the arrests of two men, and the impetus of
the protest appeared spent until a large number of children from near-by
Bellarmine Secondary School appeared at around 1pm.
A number of protesters then managed to climb on a mechanical digger,
some chaining themselves by the neck with bicycle locks to the machine's
arm. They released themselves after an hour.
One man was subsequently arrested in connection with this incident,
bringing the day's total to three.
With children swarming over the site the decision was taken to stop
work with 14 trees in the area left standing. It is not known how many
trees were chopped down.
Wimpey's director of roads, Mr Dan Pollard, said: ''It was fairly
orderly and sensible until the protesters encouraged children to come
into the area.
''That made it very difficult and dangerous for us to continue, as
children are much more unpredictable than adults and they were quickly
running all over the place, climbing trees and jumping about where
tree-fellers were operating chainsaws.''
Mr Pollard added that Wimpey were determined to build the road, and
hinted that whilst protesters were concentrating on Pollok Estate, work
was going on elsewhere unmolested.
Strathclyde Police also expressed considerable disquiet at the
childrens' presence.
Superintendent Louis Munn, of the force's media liasion service, said:
''This is an extremely dangerous site and we urge parents to make sure
their children don't come down here. We're extremely concerned.''
Scottish Militant Labour councillor Tommy Sheridan, last night denied
protesters had encouraged the children in any way. He added: ''But the
children have the right to protest, as this is their land, their playing
area, their lives that will be blighted by this road.''
A 13-year-old boy said he and his friends had rushed to join the
protest without prompting from any adults.
A regional council education spokesperson said yesterday: ''The
children were attracted by the heavy police presence at lunchtime and
staff then became aware a number of them had not returned in the
afternoon.
She added that those missing from the school, which has 553 pupils on
its roll, would be punished ''appropriately''.
Last night Councillor Sheridan and other protesters vowed to continue
their battle against the company, hailing the decision of the 26
security guards to leave the cordon and resign their jobs as a victory.
The 26 guards were persuaded to leave the line by the pleas of
protesters, including Mr Sheridan's fellow Militant Labour district
councillor, Mr Nicky Bennett, who at one point displayed the jacket and
helmet of one defector.
Mr Bennett, who represents South Nitshill, said later that ''the
shooting season had begun'' and that Wimpey would now find themselves
confronted with the people of Pollok rather than the environmental
activists previously encountered.
The councillor also attacked Strathclyde Police's operation, calling
it the ''biggest misuse of police resources'' he had ever seen.
Last night a police spokesperson defended their manning level,
stressing that the 200 officers involved would have been on duty anyway
and that no overtime would be paid.
When asked if Wimpey would be asked to contribute to the policing
costs, she replied: ''I know of no precedent to allow us to charge them,
but we're at a very early stage and are responding on a day to day basis
to this situation as it develops.''
The officers involved were diverted to Pollok from other areas, but
there was no question, she insisted, of there being any shortfall in
police cover for the areas concerned.
Mr Ian Bogle, 34, chairman of the lobby group Glasgow for People, Mr
Lindsay Keenan, 30, and a 23-year-old man are expected to appear in
Glasgow Sheriff Court today in connection with alleged disorderly
conduct following incidents yesterday.
Mr Keenan was involved in the incident which prompted the resignation
of former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart.
Last night Wimpey's road director, Mr Dan Pollard, insisted the
company would give protesters adequate notice of when they would move
into the camp itself, dubbed ''Pollok Free State''.
He said: ''There are women and children in that camp and we will tell
them if and when we decide to clear that particular area.''
Meanwhile, Govan MP Ian Davidson, who arrived later at the camp,
pledged he would continue to fight the road via European legislation,
backed by Glasgow Central MP Mike Watson and Pollok MP Jimmy Dunnachie.
''We are only just beginning to see the strength of feeling against
the road in this area and the protest will continue,'' he said.
The trio's attitude puts them in conflict with their Labour colleagues
representing Ayrshire.
Mr Brian Donohue, Mr George Foulkes, Mr Willie McKelvey and Mr Brian
Wilson yesterday released a statement in favour of the motorway link,
which they hope will bring jobs to Ayrshire unemployment blackspots.
The four MPs also called on regional councillor Charles Gordon, chair
of Strathclyde's transport committee, to continue his pro-M77 stand.

Exclusive
A MAJOR fraud investigation into the use of bogus cash cards to raid
Abbey National customers' accounts is being conducted throughout
Britain. More than #1m has already been netted from its cash machines.
The inquiry is headed by members of the Metropolitan Police Fraud
Squad, officers from several other forces, and Abbey National's own
security investigations' department.
The illegal withdrawals involve obtaining customers' credit card
numbers and their secret, four digit Personal Identification Numbers,
and producing copies of their Abbeylink hole-in-the-wall cards.
Money is even being transferred between accounts so that the maximum
withdrawal of #250-a-day from any one card is obtained.
The Abbeylink brochure proudly declares that the card ''puts you in
control of your money -- day and night''.
Last night, the Abbey National's message to its four million Abbeylink
card holders was: ''Don't worry . . . we have a secure system.''
However, it is clear that no means to prevent further raids have been
identified despite the methods used to rob accounts being known.
The building society, which recently also became a bank, refused to
rule out the possibility of yet another series of the extraordinary
raids on accounts.
It confirmed the fraud investigation is under way after Herald
inquiries into the case of a Glasgow woman who had #2700 removed from
her two accounts last week. She was left with just #9.34 after 11
separate withdrawals from cash machines within six days.
Nine other customers in the Glasgow area, and about 100 more in three
other locations in the UK, have suffered similarly since last year.
Abbey National spokesman Chris Wermann said three men were arrested in
Hampshire on Monday in connection with losses, which have been made up
by the Abbey.
Their arrests, however, are unconnected with a London court appearance
in November when three other men were accused of conspiracy to obtain
Abbeylink customer credit card numbers and their PINs from various
automatic teller machines.
They were also accused of making counterfeit cards, used in machines
throughout the UK to withdraw more than #1m over a 20-month period. It
is also alleged that 200 fake cards were recovered, along with #50,000
in cash and #200,000 in property obtained with the cards.
Mrs Connie McDiarmid, 41, of Heather Gardens, Lenzie, yesterday spoke
of her fears at the Kirkintilloch branch when she tried twice to use her
own Abbeylink card on Friday to transfer #150 from her savings account
to a current account. The machine recorded that only #5.26 was
available.
The ''sting'' involved 22 transactions, including transfers between
the two accounts so that #500 could be withdrawn daily.
Mrs McDiarmid, a part-time medical receptionist in Bishopbriggs, was
left with #4.08 in one account and #5.26 in the other. Inside the
branch, she filled in 23 forms: one for each illegal transaction, plus a
questionnaire.
She was informed by a teller and a customer services official ''not to
worry,'' and that she would get ''the money back''.
Mrs McDiarmid said that in later conversations with Abbey National's
own security investigations' department she was told her loss was part
of ''a major fraud'' going back three years.
The Abbey has now deposited #2700 in her accounts, made an ex gratia
payment of #250 for her troubles, and included interest.
Mrs McDiarmid said: ''I was more frightened than angry when I
discovered my savings account only had #5.26 instead of #2615.26.''
She added: ''The losses have been rectified, but I now worry about
these cash machines. I do not know if moving the accounts would make me
feel any better because machines will still be involved.''
Mr Wermann said all customers subjected to fraud have been refunded,
and also received new cards. He said the number involved is tiny
compared with the number of card holders.
He added: ''We are doing everything we can to ensure such a situation
will not happen again . . . but we cannot say it will never happen
again. We have worked out what is happening, and are trying to identify
a way to prevent it.''

A FRESH breakthrough in the Northern Ireland peace process was
achieved last night when British and Irish negotiators in Belfast agreed
on the framework document containing their joint proposals for the
province's future.
Mr John Major and Irish Prime Minister John Bruton are likely to meet
next week in London and formally sign the document which will then be
published.
It could meet instant resistance from the Ulster Unionist parties if
the governments have stuck to plans for a cross border authority with
executive powers.
In that event, the two governments might have to risk going over their
heads and appealing to the province's voters for their approval in a
referendum.
Mr Major had earlier yesterday at Downing Street made an attempt to
woo the Ulster Unionists. However, asked if Mr Major had calmed their
fears, the three Unionist MPs who attended replied: ''Not in the
slightest.''
Despite these doubts, the final touches were last night being put to
the document by Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish
Foreign Minister Dick Spring,
What is left to be resolved are matters of presentation and drafting,
said the two Ministers. And officials will be working to sort those out
in the next couple of days.
The Cabinet could even be asked to approve the document at tomorrow's
meeting.
Mr Spring told a news conference that by the weekend the two Ministers
hoped to meet again to agree the final draft and to put it to their
respective governments next week.
He said publication could be ''in the very near future'', adding: ''If
everything goes extraordinarily well, maybe by the end of next week''.
The meeting had ''cracked'' the differences between the two sides left
after they last met in London several weeks ago, Mr Spring said.
Those differences are understood to have centred on the form of any
cross-border institutions and the Irish claim over Northern Ireland
embodied in Article 2 of its constitution.
Mr Spring attacked the leaks of the draft document to the Times, which
he said had been ''malicious'' and ''selective''. Had the story been
written differently it could very well have upset nationalists instead
of unionists, he said.
However, he insisted there had been no major redrafting since the
furore over the leak, and indicated that the suggestion of a
cross-border body remains in the text despite the previous furious
reaction of Unionists.
In a separate news conference immediately afterwards, Sir Patrick was
slightly more cautious, although he said he did not differ in essence
from what Mr Spring had said.
Sir Patrick said: ''Some important obstacles have been overcome. The
outcome has been very encouraging and good, but we are not there yet
because there are important matters of presentation and drafting that
have to be done.''
He said he very much hoped Unionists would not reject the document but
use it as a basis for talks.
It was important to repeat time and again that it was not a blueprint
that was being imposed, Sir Patrick emphasised: ''It will be offered as
an aid to negotiations by the parties.''
Clearly the wording of the document would be crucial to Unionist
reaction when the document was offered to them, Sir Patrick said.
He added it would be offered as a shared understanding of the two
governments of what may get support around a conference table -- which
he hinted could include Sinn Fein, saying he very much hoped it would be
an ''inclusive talks process''.
A joint statement issued by the Ministers said they had had ''full and
productive discussion on the draft joint framework document, making
encouraging progress towards agreement on the remaining substantive
points.
''They expect to be in a position to put the document to the
respective governments shortly. When it had been approved it will be
given to the Northern Ireland parties for their consideration and
published.''
The joint statement said the conference had discussed the responses
that had been made to the cessation of violence, notably in the area of
prisons policy, emergency powers, and, in Northern Ireland,
de-escalation by the security forces.
Both sides emphasised their commitment to ''progressive advancement of
the peace process''.
The Irish delegation is understood to have pressed the British
Government to follow Dublin's lead in the early release of prisoners.
The reply was not known but the Government has repeated on a number of
occasions that those convicted by the legal system would have to serve
out their time.
At a lengthy meeting at No 10, Mr Major had told Unionists that there
was no question of the framework document being a blueprint to be
imposed on the province by the governments.
But the three MPs he met, Mr David Trimble, Mr William Ross, and the
Rev Martin Smyth, refused to say after the meeting that their opposition
to proposals for cross border authorities had been overcome. They said
they would reserve comment until the document was published.
He is due to meet the Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic
Unionist Party, early next week in their first face-to-face
confrontation since he threw Mr Paisley out of No 10 during a row last
year.

FORMER Government Minister Allan Stewart last night turned up the heat
on the Scottish Office over Scotland's threatened rail services.
In a surprise move he backed opposition claims that the Government has
committed itself to a formal consultation over the Fort William sleeper
service and Motorail service -- before the services are withdrawn.
His statement, made in a letter to Labour trade and industry spokesman
Brian Wilson, will put increasing pressure on officials who have spent
the last week denying that is the case.
It immediately brought claims of a major internal split between
Scottish Office officials and Ministers.
The issue became further complicated last night when British Rail
chairman Sir Bob Reid predicted that Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney
would decide within the next 48 hours whether to hold formal
consultation on the services.
Many MPs, now including Mr Stewart, believe the consultation
commitment was clearly given last week in the Scottish Grand Committee
when Sir Hector Monro, in response to a question, said formal
consultation would take place before the services are axed.
Mr Stewart has now given his backing to that claim in public and
appeared to state, despite Scottish Office suggestions to the contrary,
that Sir Hector meant to bind himself on consultation.
In his letter to Mr Wilson he states: ''I am absolutely clear there is
an unequivocal Government commitment to formal consultation on the
proposals before services are withdrawn.
''Ministers occasionally, like everyone else, say things by mistake or
which could be misunderstood. Hector is not only a Minister of
unimpeachable integrity, he has a deep knowledge and understanding of
the importance of Scotland's rail links to England.''
Mr Stewart said last night: ''The key point is what form of
consultation. What Brian Wilson has asked for is consultation before the
services are withdrawn. That, I think, is the key.
''There is no doubt what Sir Hector said and there is no doubt in my
mind that he meant it.''
Last night the Scottish Office was sticking to its position that Sir
Hector's statement had been misunderstood and consultation would only
take place as part of the inquiry into the new franchising set up -- the
Passenger Service Requirement.
''Following publication of the passenger service requirements there
will be a formal process of consultation with the Rail Users
Consultative Committee for Scotland and local authorities before final
decisions on the PSR are known,'' a spokesman said.
Franchise director Mr Roger Salmon made it clear in December he would
no longer protect the Motorail and sleeper services with subsidy. As a
result the services are likely to be withdrawn in May.

Parkhouse.
This morning the Prime Minister is watching the serious situation

THE King's Own Scottish Borderers yesterday celebrated their return to
Edinburgh after a three-year stint operating as the reserve battalion in
Northern Ireland.
The regiment left for Belfast under sentence of amalgamation with the
Royal Scots, but this was rescinded in February 1993. They were there
for the cease-fires by republican and loyalist paramilitaries.
Commanding officer Lieutenant John Cooper said he warmly welcomed both
developments. ''We are pleased to remain as we are, as one of only five
regiments who have not been amalgamated,'' he said.
''The lack of a perceivable threat in Northern Ireland made everyone
much more relaxed and extremely happy,'' he added. ''Any ceasefire is
welcomed by all parties.''
The regiment, traditionally recruited from Lanarkshire and the
Borders, were stationed in Lancashire but half their force was deployed
in South Armagh.
Over the next few months they will carry out various ceremonial duties
and retraining, including exchange visits with units from the US and
Australia. In October they are due to return for a six-month posting in
West Belfast.

BRITAIN'S bid to block the removal of passport controls could end up
on the agenda of the Maastricht 2 negotiations next year, it emerged
last night.
On the eve of European Commission president Jacques Santer's expected
statement that the EU is getting serious about abolishing immigration
checks, there was renewed speculation that other member states -- fed up
with British backtracking -- will simply put off major decisions until
after the next UK General Election.
Other issues such as UK doubts about a single European currency in
1997 (which is not part of the negotiation), retention of the national
veto in the Council of Ministers and an eventual British embrace of the
Maastricht Social Chapter could also be put on the back burner until a
more Euro-friendly government is installed in Westminster.
The first clue came late last week when German government officials
remarked privately in Washington that the real negotiation of Maastricht
2 will probably not begin until some time in 1997. The hint was dropped
in the background of talks between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a
keen federalist, and US President Bill Clinton.
Mr Major, desperately swimming against the tide of European
integration, must go to the polls not later than April, 1997.
Other EU leaders who support a more unified approach to Maastricht's
goal of ''ever closer union'' have now wakened up to the fact that the
simplest way of removing the log-jam of obstacles put up by Britain is
to outlast the Conservative government.
Dr Kohl evidently believes Maastricht 2 might not be agreed until
1998.
This strategy carries the obvious risk of assuming that the Tories
will be defeated. Should the plan backfire and Conservatives were
returned for a fifth consecutive term, Mr Major would be in a greatly
strengthened position.
Mr Santer's remarks today will be made to the European Parliament at
its monthly plenary in Strasbourg.
The removal of passport controls, intended to oil the wheels of the
European single market, is given only passing mention in the
Commission's 1995 work programme which he will present formally to
Euro-MPs for their consideration.
The critical passage gives a short paragraph to the subject which
states: ''Free movement of persons. Freedom to travel, practical
application of the principle of the elimination of border controls,
adaptation of secondary legislation.''
But it appears to confirm that the Commission will later this year
bring forward a proposed directive which would remove from all EU
citizens the need to use a passport when travelling inside the Union.
This means in theory that someone travelling by air from, for example,
Glasgow or Edinburgh to any European Union destination should not be
required to produce a passport.
The corollary is that immigration controls on non-EU visitors will be
strengthened at all external borders of the Union including ports and
airports.
It is this prospect which caused the resignation last week of junior
minister Charles Wardle who foresaw the possibility of up to 15 million
people entering Britain illegally through the Euro-back door.
Mr Major has threatened to veto such a directive if it overrides
national safeguards at external border controls negotiated by Mrs
Thatcher at the Luxembourg inter-governmental conference of 1985 which
led to the single market.
Most EU states see this as just another example of British
Conservatives reacting to their Eurosceptics.
The European Parliament's big socialist group, dominated by British
Labour Euro-MPs, last night signalled it was closer to Mr Santer than to
the UK Government on the issue.
Group leader Mrs Pauline Green, a London Labour Euro-MP, said rumours
of ''unabated'' immigration put about by Tory Euro-sceptics were a
travesty of the truth.
''There is not a single state of the European Union which believes in
unabated immigration,'' she said, adding that control at the external
borders of EU states could be adequately administered by the use of
separate channels for EU citizens and non-EU citizens.
She added that when the so-called Schengen countries -- EU member
states with internal borders -- abolish frontier controls later this
year, the other member states would gain confidence in the system and
show the Eurosceptics were wrong.
''Moving steadily along this road is the right way,'' Mrs Green said.

<HEADLINE>Political row over district's #40m plan for homes</HEADLINE>

A POLITICAL row erupted yesterday over a multi-million pound plan to
resolve the chronic housing problem which exists in Stirling district,
particularly in its small rural communities.
The Conservative-run council is negotiating a #40m package with
Scottish Homes which, if successful, will result in the construction of
250 new homes throughout the district over the next two years.
But the deal still remains very much at the ''discussion stage'' and,
according to a source at the national housing body, could take months
before anything is finalised.
However, this did not prevent the local authority from announcing the
plan yesterday, a move which has angered Labour opposition councillors,
who claimed it smacked of ''blatant electioneering''.
Councillor Gillie Thomson, leader of the Labour group, admitted he was
totally unaware of the proposal and that nothing had come before the
council seeking its approval.
He also questioned the council's contribution towards the Scottish
Homes package -- said to be more than #25m over two years -- arguing
that Stirling's current housing commitment only amounted to #8m a year
and well short of the monies required.
''It seems rather strange that the Tories announce the plan now --
only a few months before elections to the new unitary authority take
place -- and particularly as the deal is far from finalised,'' he said.
A district council spokesman said later that Stirling's contribution
involved monies being spent on repairs and improvements and would be met
through additional funds being made available by the Government.
Councillor Helen Scott, chairman of the housing committee, pointed out
that the plan would reaffirm the investment partnership between the
council and Scottish Homes which was formally established almost two
years ago.
She explained: ''It has been a remarkably successful partnership and
we want to make it even better by identifying a new set of key projects
and initiatives that the district council and Scottish Homes will be
pursuing over the next two years.''
Stirling is confident that Scottish Homes will invest #11m with #9m
coming from the private sector. But a spokesman for Scottish Homes
yesterday declined to comment on the figures.
Under the plan, it is hoped to improve the quality and variety of new
homes in Callander, Drymen, Gartmore, Fallin, Cowie, Plean, Aberfoye,
Buchlyvie, and five sites in Stirling.
''We will do all we can to get more housing built throughout the
district,'' Councillor Scott continued. ''Houses of all shapes and
sizes, houses for rent and houses for sale to meet everyone's needs.
''The new plan will be agreed in the next few weeks once we have
finalised the details,'' she said.

SCOTLAND'S top hurdler, Ken Campbell, is taking the optimistic view
that things can only improve after a run of bad luck which ended with
his car being broken into twice in the same day.
The 22-year-old Edinburgh Southern Harrier, who is the only Scot ever
to reach a Commonwealth Games sprint hurdles final, completed his
studies in construction technology last summer but was made redundant
three weeks ago.
Then, in the AAA Indoor Championships at Birmingham a fortnight ago,
he fell and injured his heel at the last flight in the semi-final as he
looked certain to qualify.
However, things improved enough to persuade him to hire a car and
drive from his Edinburgh home more than 300 miles to Northampton for a
training weekend.
On Sunday morning when he went out to his Fiat Tipo in the hotel car
park he found the side window had been smashed and the stereo stolen.
''That immediately cost me #100 because I was liable for the first
#100 of the hire company's insurance,'' he said.
Campbell contacted the police and hire company, and his injury held
out to enable him to complete the day's training before heading north.
During his weekend he had undergone biomechanic testing and each
athlete had been given a video of their performance. On arrival in
Edinburgh he headed straight to the Leith home of his coach, Stuart
Webster, to show him the video.
''When I came out I found that someone had punched out the blocked up
and taped-up window and stolen my bag from the car. Fortunately my
spikes were in the same bag as the video which I took into Stuart's
house. The bag which was stolen held all my casual clothes.
''They say bad luck comes in threes but this is ridiculous, although I
suppose it is best to get everything past in one go.''
After lowering the Scottish 110m hurdles record twice in 24 hours at
Victoria, Campbell is setting his sights on this summer's AAA
Championships.
''If Colin Jackson and Tony Jarrett enter then we will basically be
fighting for third place, and whoever succeeds will be picked for the
World Championships.''

<TEXT>
THE Western Isles Council last night decided by 15 votes to nine to
defer approval of a #4.5m supermarket to be built by the Co-operative
Wholesale Society on the Macaulay Road playing field in Stornoway.
When the outline planning application came before the development
services committee two weeks ago it was approved unanimously, despite
objections from local groups, including the Western Isles Chamber of
Commerce.
The Co-op has given an undertaking that it will provide an alternative
playing field.
However, Mr Callum Ian Macmillan moved an amendment to defer
consideration and appoint a sub-committee to discuss alternative sites
with the Co-op.
He said concern had been expressed in the community, particularly from
youth groups and local residents, regarding the location and the loss of
open space. He felt further information was required.
Councillor Al Macrae, who seconded Mr Macmillan, said: ''Deferring it
will show that democracy is still alive and well in this chamber. I
object to us being rail-roaded into making a decision.''
Convener Donald M Mackay said he was surprised at the comments being
made.
0 He said: ''When Presto's came I was told about the serious effect it
would have on the shops in Stornoway. The only effect it had was on the
shops in the rural areas. I do not see the playing field being used that
often.'
However, Councillor Donald Murray said it was used every weekend. He
also felt there were going to be traffic problems despite the fact the
police had no objections.

A CANADIAN whose alleged actions forced a KLM jumbo jet to divert to
Glasgow while en route from Amsterdam to Toronto was yesterday sent to a
hospital for further examination when he appeared in custody before a
sheriff.
Sheriff James Spy took the case in Paisley's Mill Street police
headquarters after 47-year-old Raymond Reimneitz, of Amherstburg,
Ontario, was arrested at Glasgow Airport on Monday.
During his brief appearance on petition, Mr Reimneitz made no plea or
declaration.
He is alleged to have conducted himself in a disorderly manner and
committed a breach of the peace on board the Boeing 747 which was
diverted to Glasgow in mid flight.
The charge claims he contravened the Air Navigation Order of 1989 by
committing a reckless or negligent act in a manner likely to endanger
the aircraft or those on board.
It is claimed he forced open the cockpit door, repeatedly entered the
cockpit and demanded that the pilot vacate his seat -- and attempted to
speak to passengers via the aircraft's intercom system.
Mr Reimneitz is expected to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court again next
week.

A CHILDREN's crusade brought the most serious day of skirmishing so
far between M77 protesters and builders Wimpey to a close last night
when more than 100 local schoolchildren invaded a site of tree-felling
next to the protesters' Pollok Estate camp.
Wimpey moved a squad of tree fellers, protected by a cordon of 150
security guards, into the area at 9.30 yesterday morning in the biggest
operation since work began two weeks ago.
Two hundred police officers, backed by the force helicopter, took up
position approximately thirty minutes later after a number of
protesters, enraged at what they saw as a ''surprise raid'', tried to
rush the workers who were chopping down trees on land just yards from
their camp.
Roads were blocked off in the operation, which some of the protesters
called heavy-handed.
A number of green activists made repeated attempts to penetrate the
security cordon thrown up by Securiguard, the company contracted by
Wimpey to provide protection on the #53.6m contract.
The protesters managed to persuade 26 of the security guards to leave
the cordon and resign their jobs.
Early clashes resulted in the arrests of two men, and the impetus of
the protest appeared spent until a large number of children from near-by
Bellarmine Secondary School appeared at around 1pm.
A number of protesters then managed to climb on a mechanical digger,
some chaining themselves by the neck with bicycle locks to the machine's
arm. They released themselves after an hour.
One man was subsequently arrested in connection with this incident,
bringing the day's total to three.
With children swarming over the site the decision was taken to stop
work with 14 trees in the area left standing. It is not known how many
trees were chopped down.
Wimpey's director of roads, Mr Dan Pollard, said: ''It was fairly
orderly and sensible until the protesters encouraged children to come
into the area.
''That made it very difficult and dangerous for us to continue, as
children are much more unpredictable than adults and they were quickly
running all over the place, climbing trees and jumping about where
tree-fellers were operating chainsaws.''
Mr Pollard added that Wimpey were determined to build the road, and
hinted that whilst protesters were concentrating on Pollok Estate, work
was going on elsewhere unmolested.
Strathclyde Police also expressed considerable disquiet at the
childrens' presence.
Superintendent Louis Munn, of the force's media liasion service, said:
''This is an extremely dangerous site and we urge parents to make sure
their children don't come down here. We're extremely concerned.''
Scottish Militant Labour councillor Tommy Sheridan, last night denied
protesters had encouraged the children in any way. He added: ''But the
children have the right to protest, as this is their land, their playing
area, their lives that will be blighted by this road.''
A 13-year-old boy said he and his friends had rushed to join the
protest without prompting from any adults.
A regional council education spokesperson said yesterday: ''The
children were attracted by the heavy police presence at lunchtime and
staff then became aware a number of them had not returned in the
afternoon.
She added that those missing from the school, which has 553 pupils on
its roll, would be punished ''appropriately''.
Last night Councillor Sheridan and other protesters vowed to continue
their battle against the company, hailing the decision of the 26
security guards to leave the cordon and resign their jobs as a victory.
The 26 guards were persuaded to leave the line by the pleas of
protesters, including Mr Sheridan's fellow Militant Labour district
councillor, Mr Nicky Bennett, who at one point displayed the jacket and
helmet of one defector.
Mr Bennett, who represents South Nitshill, said later that ''the
shooting season had begun'' and that Wimpey would now find themselves
confronted with the people of Pollok rather than the environmental
activists previously encountered.
The councillor also attacked Strathclyde Police's operation, calling
it the ''biggest misuse of police resources'' he had ever seen.
Last night a police spokesperson defended their manning level,
stressing that the 200 officers involved would have been on duty anyway
and that no overtime would be paid.
When asked if Wimpey would be asked to contribute to the policing
costs, she replied: ''I know of no precedent to allow us to charge them,
but we're at a very early stage and are responding on a day to day basis
to this situation as it develops.''
The officers involved were diverted to Pollok from other areas, but
there was no question, she insisted, of there being any shortfall in
police cover for the areas concerned.
Mr Ian Bogle, 34, chairman of the lobby group Glasgow for People, Mr
Lindsay Keenan, 30, and a 23-year-old man are expected to appear in
Glasgow Sheriff Court today in connection with alleged disorderly
conduct following incidents yesterday.
Mr Keenan was involved in the incident which prompted the resignation
of former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart.
Last night Wimpey's road director, Mr Dan Pollard, insisted the
company would give protesters adequate notice of when they would move
into the camp itself, dubbed ''Pollok Free State''.
He said: ''There are women and children in that camp and we will tell
them if and when we decide to clear that particular area.''
Meanwhile, Govan MP Ian Davidson, who arrived later at the camp,
pledged he would continue to fight the road via European legislation,
backed by Glasgow Central MP Mike Watson and Pollok MP Jimmy Dunnachie.
''We are only just beginning to see the strength of feeling against
the road in this area and the protest will continue,'' he said.
The trio's attitude puts them in conflict with their Labour colleagues
representing Ayrshire.
Mr Brian Donohue, Mr George Foulkes, Mr Willie McKelvey and Mr Brian
Wilson yesterday released a statement in favour of the motorway link,
which they hope will bring jobs to Ayrshire unemployment blackspots.
The four MPs also called on regional councillor Charles Gordon, chair
of Strathclyde's transport committee, to continue his pro-M77 stand.

Exclusive
A MAJOR fraud investigation into the use of bogus cash cards to raid
Abbey National customers' accounts is being conducted throughout
Britain. More than #1m has already been netted from its cash machines.
The inquiry is headed by members of the Metropolitan Police Fraud
Squad, officers from several other forces, and Abbey National's own
security investigations' department.
The illegal withdrawals involve obtaining customers' credit card
numbers and their secret, four digit Personal Identification Numbers,
and producing copies of their Abbeylink hole-in-the-wall cards.
Money is even being transferred between accounts so that the maximum
withdrawal of #250-a-day from any one card is obtained.
The Abbeylink brochure proudly declares that the card ''puts you in
control of your money -- day and night''.
Last night, the Abbey National's message to its four million Abbeylink
card holders was: ''Don't worry . . . we have a secure system.''
However, it is clear that no means to prevent further raids have been
identified despite the methods used to rob accounts being known.
The building society, which recently also became a bank, refused to
rule out the possibility of yet another series of the extraordinary
raids on accounts.
It confirmed the fraud investigation is under way after Herald
inquiries into the case of a Glasgow woman who had #2700 removed from
her two accounts last week. She was left with just #9.34 after 11
separate withdrawals from cash machines within six days.
Nine other customers in the Glasgow area, and about 100 more in three
other locations in the UK, have suffered similarly since last year.
Abbey National spokesman Chris Wermann said three men were arrested in
Hampshire on Monday in connection with losses, which have been made up
by the Abbey.
Their arrests, however, are unconnected with a London court appearance
in November when three other men were accused of conspiracy to obtain
Abbeylink customer credit card numbers and their PINs from various
automatic teller machines.
They were also accused of making counterfeit cards, used in machines
throughout the UK to withdraw more than #1m over a 20-month period. It
is also alleged that 200 fake cards were recovered, along with #50,000
in cash and #200,000 in property obtained with the cards.
Mrs Connie McDiarmid, 41, of Heather Gardens, Lenzie, yesterday spoke
of her fears at the Kirkintilloch branch when she tried twice to use her
own Abbeylink card on Friday to transfer #150 from her savings account
to a current account. The machine recorded that only #5.26 was
available.
The ''sting'' involved 22 transactions, including transfers between
the two accounts so that #500 could be withdrawn daily.
Mrs McDiarmid, a part-time medical receptionist in Bishopbriggs, was
left with #4.08 in one account and #5.26 in the other. Inside the
branch, she filled in 23 forms: one for each illegal transaction, plus a
questionnaire.
She was informed by a teller and a customer services official ''not to
worry,'' and that she would get ''the money back''.
Mrs McDiarmid said that in later conversations with Abbey National's
own security investigations' department she was told her loss was part
of ''a major fraud'' going back three years.
The Abbey has now deposited #2700 in her accounts, made an ex gratia
payment of #250 for her troubles, and included interest.
Mrs McDiarmid said: ''I was more frightened than angry when I
discovered my savings account only had #5.26 instead of #2615.26.''
She added: ''The losses have been rectified, but I now worry about
these cash machines. I do not know if moving the accounts would make me
feel any better because machines will still be involved.''
Mr Wermann said all customers subjected to fraud have been refunded,
and also received new cards. He said the number involved is tiny
compared with the number of card holders.
He added: ''We are doing everything we can to ensure such a situation
will not happen again . . . but we cannot say it will never happen
again. We have worked out what is happening, and are trying to identify
a way to prevent it.''

A FRESH breakthrough in the Northern Ireland peace process was
achieved last night when British and Irish negotiators in Belfast agreed
on the framework document containing their joint proposals for the
province's future.
Mr John Major and Irish Prime Minister John Bruton are likely to meet
next week in London and formally sign the document which will then be
published.
It could meet instant resistance from the Ulster Unionist parties if
the governments have stuck to plans for a cross border authority with
executive powers.
In that event, the two governments might have to risk going over their
heads and appealing to the province's voters for their approval in a
referendum.
Mr Major had earlier yesterday at Downing Street made an attempt to
woo the Ulster Unionists. However, asked if Mr Major had calmed their
fears, the three Unionist MPs who attended replied: ''Not in the
slightest.''
Despite these doubts, the final touches were last night being put to
the document by Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish
Foreign Minister Dick Spring,
What is left to be resolved are matters of presentation and drafting,
said the two Ministers. And officials will be working to sort those out
in the next couple of days.
The Cabinet could even be asked to approve the document at tomorrow's
meeting.
Mr Spring told a news conference that by the weekend the two Ministers
hoped to meet again to agree the final draft and to put it to their
respective governments next week.
He said publication could be ''in the very near future'', adding: ''If
everything goes extraordinarily well, maybe by the end of next week''.
The meeting had ''cracked'' the differences between the two sides left
after they last met in London several weeks ago, Mr Spring said.
Those differences are understood to have centred on the form of any
cross-border institutions and the Irish claim over Northern Ireland
embodied in Article 2 of its constitution.
Mr Spring attacked the leaks of the draft document to the Times, which
he said had been ''malicious'' and ''selective''. Had the story been
written differently it could very well have upset nationalists instead
of unionists, he said.
However, he insisted there had been no major redrafting since the
furore over the leak, and indicated that the suggestion of a
cross-border body remains in the text despite the previous furious
reaction of Unionists.
In a separate news conference immediately afterwards, Sir Patrick was
slightly more cautious, although he said he did not differ in essence
from what Mr Spring had said.
Sir Patrick said: ''Some important obstacles have been overcome. The
outcome has been very encouraging and good, but we are not there yet
because there are important matters of presentation and drafting that
have to be done.''
He said he very much hoped Unionists would not reject the document but
use it as a basis for talks.
It was important to repeat time and again that it was not a blueprint
that was being imposed, Sir Patrick emphasised: ''It will be offered as
an aid to negotiations by the parties.''
Clearly the wording of the document would be crucial to Unionist
reaction when the document was offered to them, Sir Patrick said.
He added it would be offered as a shared understanding of the two
governments of what may get support around a conference table -- which
he hinted could include Sinn Fein, saying he very much hoped it would be
an ''inclusive talks process''.
A joint statement issued by the Ministers said they had had ''full and
productive discussion on the draft joint framework document, making
encouraging progress towards agreement on the remaining substantive
points.
''They expect to be in a position to put the document to the
respective governments shortly. When it had been approved it will be
given to the Northern Ireland parties for their consideration and
published.''
The joint statement said the conference had discussed the responses
that had been made to the cessation of violence, notably in the area of
prisons policy, emergency powers, and, in Northern Ireland,
de-escalation by the security forces.
Both sides emphasised their commitment to ''progressive advancement of
the peace process''.
The Irish delegation is understood to have pressed the British
Government to follow Dublin's lead in the early release of prisoners.
The reply was not known but the Government has repeated on a number of
occasions that those convicted by the legal system would have to serve
out their time.
At a lengthy meeting at No 10, Mr Major had told Unionists that there
was no question of the framework document being a blueprint to be
imposed on the province by the governments.
But the three MPs he met, Mr David Trimble, Mr William Ross, and the
Rev Martin Smyth, refused to say after the meeting that their opposition
to proposals for cross border authorities had been overcome. They said
they would reserve comment until the document was published.
He is due to meet the Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic
Unionist Party, early next week in their first face-to-face
confrontation since he threw Mr Paisley out of No 10 during a row last
year.

FORMER Government Minister Allan Stewart last night turned up the heat
on the Scottish Office over Scotland's threatened rail services.
In a surprise move he backed opposition claims that the Government has
committed itself to a formal consultation over the Fort William sleeper
service and Motorail service -- before the services are withdrawn.
His statement, made in a letter to Labour trade and industry spokesman
Brian Wilson, will put increasing pressure on officials who have spent
the last week denying that is the case.
It immediately brought claims of a major internal split between
Scottish Office officials and Ministers.
The issue became further complicated last night when British Rail
chairman Sir Bob Reid predicted that Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney
would decide within the next 48 hours whether to hold formal
consultation on the services.
Many MPs, now including Mr Stewart, believe the consultation
commitment was clearly given last week in the Scottish Grand Committee
when Sir Hector Monro, in response to a question, said formal
consultation would take place before the services are axed.
Mr Stewart has now given his backing to that claim in public and
appeared to state, despite Scottish Office suggestions to the contrary,
that Sir Hector meant to bind himself on consultation.
In his letter to Mr Wilson he states: ''I am absolutely clear there is
an unequivocal Government commitment to formal consultation on the
proposals before services are withdrawn.
''Ministers occasionally, like everyone else, say things by mistake or
which could be misunderstood. Hector is not only a Minister of
unimpeachable integrity, he has a deep knowledge and understanding of
the importance of Scotland's rail links to England.''
Mr Stewart said last night: ''The key point is what form of
consultation. What Brian Wilson has asked for is consultation before the
services are withdrawn. That, I think, is the key.
''There is no doubt what Sir Hector said and there is no doubt in my
mind that he meant it.''
Last night the Scottish Office was sticking to its position that Sir
Hector's statement had been misunderstood and consultation would only
take place as part of the inquiry into the new franchising set up -- the
Passenger Service Requirement.
''Following publication of the passenger service requirements there
will be a formal process of consultation with the Rail Users
Consultative Committee for Scotland and local authorities before final
decisions on the PSR are known,'' a spokesman said.
Franchise director Mr Roger Salmon made it clear in December he would
no longer protect the Motorail and sleeper services with subsidy. As a
result the services are likely to be withdrawn in May.

CABINET disarray on European policy moved out of the political arena
yesterday into the international money markets which caused the pound to
hit its lowest level in two years, writes Political Editor Geoffrey
Parkhouse.
This morning the Prime Minister is watching the serious situation
which could upset the export led recovery.
Yesterday the world's money markets reflected the bickering by Mr
Major's Cabinet Ministers over the last week on European economic and
political union.
Sterling was hit against the dollar and the Deutschmark. This morning
there could be another attack.
