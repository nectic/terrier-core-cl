n HARPUR &amp; ILES (BBC 1) - It's the oldest trick in the rule book, up there with
the accused making a ``full and frank confession'' or ``falling down the
stairs'', but BBC 1's new drama spins the good cop/bad cop routine like
handcuffs on a tabletop, till both are just a blur. Hywel Bennett is the
grasping and unscrupulous Assistant Chief Constable Desmond Iles, while Aneirin
Hughes is the more-compassionate CID chief, Colin Harpur, forced to work the
same case of kidnapping. Based on the novel Protection by Bill James, Harpur
and Iles run through the Cardiff underworld trying to recover the young son of
an underworld boss, swiped as rival gangs battle over a protection racket. It's
a chance to find
the son and nail the father, but an investigation into police corruption is
turning up the heat. The drama concludes on Sunday, with a
tenner saying they'll form a grudging respect.
n THE LAST BOY SCOUT (ITV) - The opening sequence of this flick is a
gambler's wildest, adrenaline-soaked high. Millions are riding on the outcome
of a football game, and the ringer is sweating blood, his team is down, and the
crime syndicate are not pleased. He takes a play and off he goes, past one,
past two, but the third man's a monster. So, pop quiz: ``What do you do?'' You
haul out a handgun and shoot him in the leg and on you go, blasting anyone in
the way until you cross the line and crash the ball down. What follows is your
usual Bruce Willis action blitz, where he plays a former secret service agent
turned private investigator looking into the cases of a corrupt senator and a
crooked football manager. A movie with even odds.
n EVERYMAN: SCIENCE FRICTION (BBC 1) - Dayton, Tennessee, in 1925, the United
States' finest minds debate whether schools should teach that man was descended
from monkeys; 71 years on the argument continues as Christians fight to have
the Biblical crea-tion of the world taught in schools, with the teaching of
evolution taught simply as one theory. This film follows the story of the
Anti-Evolution Bill put forward in March this year in Dayton, and explores the
passions and fears at the
heart of this fervent political debate. Creationists say the teaching of
evolution is heretical, and the cause of moral decline. Scientists say the
truth cannot be ignored. Noah is hedging his bets.
n TARRANT ON TV (STV) - Old Chris will never be Clive James when it comes to
the slick one-liner, but he's got a rough humour he can carry off, if you can
just remove the image of him lying on his back doing the Dying Fly from his
Tiswas days. In his new series, he casts an unbelieving eye over TV from around
the world, including a look at how sex is shown in foreign commercials, and the
game show where contestants receive a colonic irrigation and are then judged on
their ``performance'', whatever that means. But my favourite is a French game
show, Pour La Vie, in which couples compete to determine who loves the other
the most, with tearful consequences.
n SEX WITH PAULA (C4) - In 1986, Paula Yates was commissioned by Channel 4 to
make a series exploring the connections between love, sex, morals, and popular
music with some of the leading pop and rock icons such as George Michael, Elton
John, and Dave Stewart. It was never shown; the reason, exhaustion? No, the
increasing awareness of Aids and the targeting of sexually active young people
with warnings made the series unsuitable. Today the compilation is billed as an
``almost historical portrayal of lost innocence''. Elton John and George
Michael, innocent? Surely some mistake!
n THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW/SEINFELD (BBC 2) - When do you think people will get
back to making programmes, not programmes inside programmes? Confused? Well,
Larry Sanders is a chat show host, but he's not really a chat show host. He's a
comedian playing a chat show host in a comedy show. Jerry Seinfeld is a
comedian, playing himself in a comedy show in which he tries to think up ideas
for other comedy shows. I think they'll dump such ideas only when the laughs
stop coming, which means it won't be for a while as both ``shows'' are riots.
Tonight Sanders has to cope with a visit from his father, while Seinfeld is
romancing a beautiful model when she catches him doing something disgusting
with his nose. Interesting.
n CUTTING EDGE: THE HOME (C4) - Granny farming is one of those wonderful media
terms which accurately captures a section of the industry catering to elderly
residential care. And in Paul Watson's new documentary the creator of the
award-winning series The Factory turns his focus on what happens to us as we
reach the end of our lives. Today many people don't finish long life with their
loved ones, but are packed off instead to a home, where residents sit out their
remaining days with little to fill them. In Redmere Lodge, St Leonards-on-Sea,
Watson moves from the needs of the residents
to their memories and to
the position of the home's owner, Euan MacKenzie, and his staff of carers.
n TIMEWATCH: HANNIBAL AND DESERT STORM (BBC 2) - The Carthaginian Commander who
drove elephants over the Alps may have been replaced in the public's psyche by
a serial killer who enjoys human liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti, but
if anyone can dust down his reputation, it's ``Stormin' Norman''. In a rare
interview, General Schwarzkopf talks frankly about his hero and how tactics
pioneered at the battle of Cannae in 216 BC to mislead Hannibal's enemy were
borrowed for Desert Storm. While the general reveals that he has based a lot of
this thinking on tactics which are more than 2000 years old, Andy McNab, ex-SAS
member and author, talks about how a soldier's life has changed very little
since those times.
n BOMBER COMMAND: REAPING THE WHIRLWIND (C4) - Sir Arthur ``Bomber'' Harris
never spoke in his own defence when branded as the instigator of the infamous
Dresden air raid and as the architect of area bombing which killed hundreds of
thousands of German civilians whose deaths, critics claim, did little to win
the war. However, in Alex Beetham's documentary, newly-discovered interviews
with Harris are mixed with the reflections of former aircrews and unique
archive film to reveal the real story of the RAF bomber offensive.
n THE THIN BLUE LINE (BBC 1) - It's the graveyard shift, and the ghouls are out
to annoy the force. Teenage yobbos and juvenile delinquents crowd into the
nick, where Rowan Atkinson as Fowler has to contend with his teenage son
visiting, and a colleague, Patricia, is dealing with teenage tearaways at home
and at work. Meanwhile, Grim (David Haig) is at Scotland Yard, leaving Fowler
to redefine the word jealousy. If anyone from Gasforth is going to be a
confidant of the Yard, it damn well ought to be him. Ben Elton continues to
spin out his comic one-liners.
n GREAT RAILWAY JOURNEYS (BBC 2) - If Alexei Sayle was to sit beside you in a
railway carriage, you'd be wise to run. Alexei would - his tongue would be
doing laps round his mouth as crack-pot theories on modern transport, the role
of the wheel in lama-trekking, and where was the best place to air your string
vest. Pity the crew who accompanied him on his travels as Sayle of Arabia along
the Hejaz railway line from Aleppo in Northern Syria to Aqaba in Jordan. As he
journeys through the searing heat in an aged East German ``biscuit tin'', his
good humour is sorely tested. His journey is regarded with keen interest by the
Syrian people, with some of the shadier characters resembling secret police.
They would have thought he was talking in comic code.
n THE CELLULOID CLOSET (C4) - This ambitious documentary illuminates the rich
and diverse history of lesbian and gay cinema from its birth to the present
day, and caps 10 years of heavy involvement with Channel 4. Cut together with
contributions from film-makers, academics, screen-writers and featuring clips
from more than 100 movies, The Celluloid Closet tells an epic story which
explores the way
attitudes to homosexuality and gender roles have changed through the century.
The programme starts in the early sixties when
the subject was first discussed on screen through
to films such as My Beau-tiful Laundrette and Philadelphia.
n THE X FILES (BBC 1) - Correct me if I'm wrong but haven't the BBC made a
complete hash with their
handling of The X Files? It's been all over the place, Saturday, Monday,
Thursday, or maybe it's just been abducted. Tonight, however, viewers are
guaranteed a brand new series with the next instalment of the cliff-hanger The
Blessing Way. Mulder's investigations into the alien abduction of his sister
leads him far from the FBI's straight and narrow path, through the indian
reservations and into the murkiest government underworld. Dana Scully is made
to take leave of absence for her insubordination.
n NEVERWHERE (C4) - In the mind of comic writer Neil Gaiman and comedian Lenny
Henry there are two Londons. There is London Above, the city of banks,
businesses and news-papers, but there is also London Below, a world of
assassins, knights, barons, pale girls in black velvet, and London's only
angel, Islington. In Neverwhere, a new-six part urban fantasy, a young
businessman, Richard Mayhew, played by Gary Bakewell, travels below when he
discovers a young homeless girl called Door who comes from an important
aristocratic family of the London Below and is being pursued by assassins.
Anyone who has read Gaiman's magical work in the Sandman comics will be
prepared for a wonderful flight of fancy. Anyone who has not, soon will.
n TFI FRIDAY (C4) - Chris Evans returns to prove himself the most popular
entertainer in years, but only if he can make it to the set through a gauntlet
of Evans-bashing news stories. Still, his arrogant, off-hand nature has heaped
the trouble on his head - but as it's his off-hand and arrogant nature that the
viewers and listeners love, what seems to be the problem? As usual, the antics
are restricted to whoever phones back in time and agrees to star in the show,
but since previous guests have included Jon Bon Jovi, who burned his initials
into a desk, and Kathy Lloyd, who was made to chop logs, there are bound to be
no shortage of acts anxious to share Evan's spotlight.
n EUROTRASH (C4) - Described by one viewer as ``That's Life on Acid'', the ever
popular and unstoppable smut fest will be weaker this series for the loss of
Jean-Paul, who has returned to his day job in the rag trade. But fear not,
Antoine will finally wear the skirt, and guest presenters include Ivana Trump
and Anna-Nicole Smith. Lolo Ferrari, the owner of the biggest breasts in
Europe, 51 FFF for the cup-curious, will be introducing some of the most
bizarre and amusing pop videos in Europe. Other skits to look out for are the
S&amp;M sports day and the
trout circus.
n PULP VIDEO (BBC 2) - The subjects jammed under the comedy microscope in this
week's comedy sketch show include topless darts, ostrich farming, and
Alcoholics Anonymous, but not necessarily in that order. It remains to be seen
whether an anonymous fellowship of men who cannot stop chucking darts at
topless farmers who've been attacked by alcoholic ostriches will make it into
the show. Perhaps it will just be something much, much, funnier.

MONDAY saw two new daytime game shows with a culinary flavour, which was either
a spooky coincidence, or further evidence of too many people with too few
ideas. ITV brought us the aspirational foodies' quiz Quisine (ITV, Monday to
Friday), the BBC countering with the panto-esque cook-along Can't Cook Won't
Cook (BBC1, Monday to Friday). Remove the trimmings, and both are
thinly-disguised recipe shows. All that divides them is their estimation of
popular taste. While Quisine wheeled on Nick Nairn to demonstrate fettucine of
monkfish and mussels in a curry and coriander sauce, Can't Cook's little chef,
Kevin Woodford, bullied his contestants into making the paella they ate on that
package trip to Spain.
Woodford, an introvert trying too hard to be extrovert, pirouetted around a set
lit like the Asda housewares aisle making jabby little hand movements and
bawling at his cack-handed guests. He is not what you would call a natural
broadcaster: he is prone to the unpredictable volume and uncertain grasp of
idiom associated with blind panic. (``I understand that you're a self-admitting
chauvinist,'' he barked at one contestant, eliciting a disapproving ``ooooo''
from the studio audience.)
Nervousness also seemed to be affecting his hearing. Contestants' attempts at
cheery
banter tended to be met with a stricken ``pardon?'' Then, bizarrely, he would
parrot whatever they had just said. Perhaps he was a psycho-
therapist before taking up the wooden spoon.
Assuming that Can't Cook Won't Cook has ambitions beyond insulting the
intelligence of its audience, it seems to be a stab at post-modern wit. That
insubstantial set has a trashy fifties America feel. Kevin's forced gaiety and
effortful catchphrases (``let's rattle those pots and pans'') are striving to
recapture a simplicity, the bygone innocence of the medium. The trouble is that
these days, simplicity comes just as expensive as sophistication. Can't Cook is
merely cheap.
One of the less-sustainable fictions in the life of a television reviewer is
that we spend our entire lives watching TV, and are thus intimately acquainted
with everything on the box. Alas, no. Some shows I wouldn't watch if they
paid me. Which they do. One
such was Dangerfield (BBC1, Friday), sampled in its very first episode and
forever forsworn. Well, almost forever. Lured by the confident Friday night
scheduling, I gave Dr D a second chance, sitting through a white-knuckle
sequence of murder, hostage-taking, alcoholism, teenage pregnancy, suicide and
badger-baiting. And all before the opening titles. After this, any 50-minute
episode might seem a little slow. In Behind Closed Doors, the lighting of a
standard lamp was an event.
Dangerfield (Nigel Le Vaillant) is a GP moonlighting as a police surgeon in
leafy Warwickshire. He lives in one tastefully-modernised Georgian townhouse,
works in another, and would certainly know his way around a dish of
coriander-flavoured monkfish. Since in a previous incarnation he paced the
wards of Casualty, we must assume that blonde hair and rubbery good looks are
what the British woman wants in a beside manner (though knitting-pattern
masculinity has never set my pulse racing). But all is not well in the good
doctor's world. That caring simper hides a broken heart. He blames himself for
his wife's death in a car crash, and is attending butchly tearful sessions with
a comely bereavement counsellor. He has just lost his contract with the police,
his student daughter is expecting a baby, and, if these were not troubles
enough, his jobless son,
played by Blue Peter heartthrob Tim Vincent, seems to be taking acting lessons
from
a Take That video.
Dangerfield tries to marry bourgeois naturalism with the flashing blue light
school of thrillvision, and it doesn't work - not even with a guest appearance
by the pawkily subversive Keith Allen, playing a fruit and veg wholesaler cum
local politician bent on dragging the chief constable in front of a
score-settling disciplinary tribunal. Allen worked hard, exercising those
simian features with his best eye-rollings and menacingly-
perfunctory grins, but, amid that cast and delivering that script, he stood out
like a pickled onion in a plate of creamed rice.
As a yuppie-in-peril movie, Screen One: Truth or Dare (BBC1, Saturday) arrived
a good decade behind most of
the genre, chronicling the
misadventures of Lorna (Helen Baxendale), an ambitious Scottish solicitor
concealing a shoplifting conviction in her student past and a current affair
with a married fiscal. It wasn't much by the standards of the average
skeleton-stacked closet, but more than enough to explode her carefully-ordered
life.
Bored with middle-class security and the odd illicit lunch-hour tryst, Lorna
was delighted to be
contacted by three pals from her hell-raising university years. But fond
reminiscences of past risk-taking gradually gave way to the realisation that,
far from settling down
in the interim, her friends
had raised the stakes. These days their idea of a good time ran to bilking,
bedhopping, blackmail, and murder.
The premise was a tad dated, and one or two of the twists less than absolutely
believable, but Truth or Dare knotted the intestines efficiently enough for
flashes of the action to stay with me for days. That moment when Nick (John
Hannah serving up a cocktail of coolly malevolent charm) laid his hand on the
blistering stove for a dare. The ultra-conservative Law Society Ball where
Lorna was kissed full on the mouth by her self-appointed nemesis, Mel (Susan
Lynch, who used her hormonally-ambiguous beauty to frightening effect). The
ease with which convention-flouting embarrassment games slid into moral
anarchy. The film closed with Lorna suspended from a mountain on the end of a
rope, friendless, jobless, and facing at least one charge of murder. In the
light of what had gone before, this was a happy ending.
I know I'm not a lesbian because I don't fancy kd lang. Celluloid Icons: Jodie
(C4,
Sunday) examined the appeal of another obscure - and also, apparently,
obligatory - object of female desire, Jodie Foster. We learned nothing new of
the actress, but her fans were a revelation. Endless speculation about whether
Jodie was butch, femme, femme-butch or tomboy-femme. Intelligent women
freeze-framing The Accused to pore over the split-second when Foster holds
Kelly McGillis's hand, and writing academic treaties full of jargon about
``iconic moments''. ``We think we know that they're lesbians, and therefore we
idealise them,'' explained the woman from New York. Strange and regrettable are
the consequences of a culture driven underground.

NEIL Fairbrother was yesterday confirmed as the latest recruit to
England's accident-prone Ashes tour.
The Lancashire batsman will arrive in Australia on Thursday and could
be considered for next weekend's World Series Cup match against
Zimbabwe.
Fairbrother has been a key member of England's one-day side for
several years and was close to making the original party for this tour.
Now, despite not having played a Test since 1993, the 31-year-old
left-hander might still force his way into Ashes reckoning. Mike Gatting
and Graham Gooch are both badly out of form while Alec Stewart is
nursing a broken index finger.
Fairbrother's arrival seems certain to coincide with the departure of
Yorkshire all-rounder Craig White, who has made no improvement since
tearing an abdominal muscle on December 13. ''It's going to take a month
for Craig to recover,'' said manager Keith Fletcher.
England have already said goodbye to Kent fast bowler Martin McCague
(shin stress fracture) this tour. He was replaced by Angus Fraser -- the
first of four additions to the party.
Paceman Mark Ilott arrived before Christmas as cover when the injury
crisis was at its height. He will be released to join the A side in
India this week but new arrival Jack Russell is staying for the
remainder of the trip as wicketkeeping back-up to Steve Rhodes.
England's latest injury problem saw Phillip DeFreitas pull out of the
third Test yesterday with a hamstring strain.
But no matter what side takes the field, performances remain
depressingly similar.
Captain Mike Atherton responded to last week's second Test hammering
in Melbourne -- and criticism of his leadership -- by scoring a brave
88, but neither that knock nor John Crawley's first half-century could
prevent England from sliding to 198 for seven on the opening day.

THEY may not be the most successful bunch of players ever to hang
their coats in the Parkhead dressing room, but the current Celtic staff
cannot be accused of greed, writes Ian Paul. Their long-serving midfield
man, Peter Grant, revealed at the weekend that the first-team squad has
not only declined any bonus for draws, but has also refused to accept
win bonus money unless they are in the top three in the premier
division.
''We decided at the start of the season that we would be worth bonus
cash only if we were winning in a top-three position,'' said Grant. ''We
don't want to be remembered as the team who won nothing. Celtic have to
be in the top three, and that is why we felt we could not take bonuses
unless we were there.''
The plan has not made them rich, for sure. They moved into fourth spot
as a result of beating Falkirk at Hampden on Saturday, but that did not
earn them extra cash . . . ''I think it is the first time I have won and
not had a bonus''. . . and, as that was their first league win since
September 24, they have not had much chance to swell their bank
balances. That victory over Falkirk had followed 12 games without
success, but the last five had been draws.
They were last beaten in the league when Rangers won 3-1 at Hampden in
October, and on recent form they will be outsiders against their old
rivals again at Ibrox on Wednesday. But it is never too wise to rely
heavily on track records in these games, even if Rangers' record in
Ne'erday meetings in recent years is excellent.
Tosh McKinlay is a doubtful starter for Celtic after having been taken
off with a hip injury after half an hour at Hampden, and manager Tommy
Burns may have to decide if stand-in Stuart Gray, who did well in an
unfamiliar position, should stay there.
Whatever the line-up, Grant is sure the young players who have come
into the Celtic team will not fail for want of desire. ''Some of the
players here were winning for the first time in a Celtic first-team
jersey,'' he said, ''but they have got their chance because they have
been winning everything in sight for the reserves.
''They have given the side a bit of fresh air. There were five lads
under 21 in our team against Falkirk and they can hold their heads up
high. In these circumstances players sometimes try too hard to please
the supporters, who have given us such great backing, so it is not an
easy time to come into the team.
''I think the manager has been asking himself whether he should bring
them in when the team is not doing particularly well, but he has been
rewarded by their performances.''
Grant believes that every club needs to see its youth policy succeed
and cites the emergence of Charlie Miller with Rangers as an example of
how it matters even when big money is being spent. ''That has to be done
as well, of course, but the young lads bring a desire and spirit to a
team.''
Celtic would not lift themselves into bonus country even if they beat
Rangers, but that is unlikely to have any effect on their will-to-win on
Wednesday. Whether they can cope with a Rangers team at its peak this
season is another matter.
Rangers' 3-1 win over Motherwell at Fir Park lifted them into
binocular distance from the rest of the premier division field, and the
likelihood is that they will have Mark Hateley and Ally McCoist back for
the Old Firm tangle. McCoist is eager to score one more time to reach
his 300th league goal for the club, and if he did it against Celtic he
would be especially delighted, would he not?

WHILE the fans of their respective teams, Hearts and Dundee United,
await to see if the departure of Ivan Golac, which now seems certain to
be sooner rather than later, will propel Tommy McLean from Tynecastle to
his brother's side at Tannadice, the men concerned were busy yesterday
attending to the preparations for the first game of 1995. In football,
the game comes first, and if you believe that you deserve our best
wishes for another dream year.
Hearts' derby day is for real. United, whose true rivalry with Dundee
is a non-event for the moment, as they are in different divisions, meet
Aberdeen at home in a kind ofsurrogate derby, but the title of the match
matters little for a side which has to try to recover from a 4-0
drubbing by Hibs at Easter Road.
Conversely, that win will have done nothing to reduce the confidence
of a Hibs side whose four-year run of derby failure was finally ended
this season and, with two derby wins in succession behind them, Alex
Miller's side need not fear the worst any more.
Miller would not discuss the shape of his team but it would come as a
major surprise if there were any changes. The debate may be academic in
any case as the word from Tynecastle yesterday was that there is some
doubt about the game taking place because of icy patches on the park. An
inspection is planned for this morning.
However, McLean could not linger on those ifs and buts, preferring to
concentrate on what is a major team decision. Striker John Robertson,
who has been one of the most successful Edinburgh derby players of all
time, was substituted at half-time by McLean when he put on young Kevin
Thomas.
The international forward was apparently not injured and it now
remains to be seen whether McLean would take the gamble of leaving him
out of a derby in which he has scored 21 goals.
Hibs striker Keith Wright and defender Graham Mitchell, who returned
to action in the win over United after long absences, came through
without any mishap and will be in their places.
Incidentally, Hibs launched a new club hotline yesterday with a cheeky
number which will not lessen the rivalry between the capital clubs. The
number, 7-0 7-0 7-0 marks their derby win of 1973 when they won by seven
goals.
Like Tommy McLean, United manager Ivan Golac was saying nothing about
the speculation surrounding his future, but was demanding of his players
a new start to go with the new year. To help that cause along, he
intends to make changes from the team that let the side down at Easter
Road.
It is unlikely, however, that he will be able to bring back Billy
McKinlay, which is one change he would have wished to implement.
McKinlay missed the Hibs match because of injury and is very doubtful
still.
''I think we need a bit more creativeness at home,'' said manager Jim
Jefferies.Colin McDonald, who missed Saturday's game because of a virus,
is unlikley to be ready. Thistle will be without Roddy Grant who was
sent off in the 2-2 draw with Kilmarnock.
Killie, who proved again at Firhill that they are a very tough team to
beat, will give Motherwell no time to dwell on the disappointment of
their defeat by Rangers when the sides meet at Rugby Park. Shaun
McSkimming will be in a Motherwell shirt against his former team-mates
for the first time.

THE baseball season has been cancelled because of industrial action,
the ice hockey season has yet to begin for the same reason, and now a
number of jockeys have gone on strike in a dispute over health benefits.
All of this may soon seem of little significance if moves under way in
Buffalo, New York, begin to gather momentum. Buffalo is, of course, home
to the powerful Buffalo Bills football team, who have lost in the last
three consecutive Super Bowls.
The city, indeed the stadium, is also home to the Buffalo Jills, the
team's cheer-leaders, and they are pushing hard to unionise cheerleading
nationwide.
If they don't get what they want the consequences could be dire. The
cheer-leaders are, after all, one of the few things that make American
football interesting.
* DIE-hard fans of American football long ago became used to the sight
of lumbering linemen slumped on the sidelines after a hard play with
oxygen masks strapped over their mouths.
Being built for power rather than endurance, the boost in oxygen
allows the playes to recover more quickly before their next burst of
energy.
Another device may soon become just as commonplace on the playing
fields of America, although this one was designed with the common man in
mind. The device in question is called a Breathe Right and is supposed
to cure those who snore excessively.
Looking much like a bandage, it fits acros the individual's nose,
widens the sinus cavities and allows them, and those near them, to enjoy
a more comfortable night. Some NFL players have become convinced that by
widening their sinus cavities they will take in more oxygen and thereby
be able to compete at a higher level.
Dr Daniel Cohen, chairman of CNS Inc, the company manufacturing the
Breathe Right, welcomes the NFL endorsement but remains bemused. The
Breathe Right makes no difference to your oxygen intake, he explains.
''Your lungs can only hold so much oxygen.''
Still, the NFL exposure has boosted CNS's earnings. A rumour that a
player was to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated wearing a
Breathe Right caused a 6% increase in the company's stock. Now CNS is
seeking to endorse a player who actually wears one in his sleep. If he
wears it on the field as well, so much the better.
''When you first look at a product it has no credibility,'' says
Cohen. ''On an athlete's nose, there is credibility.''
* MUCH was made in weeks gone by of the $70m contract signed between
the Orlando Magic and basketball rookie Penny Hardaway. Local fans found
it hard to decide just which side was the craziest. Much less has been
made of the fact that, since his signing, Hardaway has given almost
$125,000 to charity. Who says there are no role models left in American
sport?
The 'Oh no, no' team win award
AT the conclusion of each year it is often humorous, not to mention
nostalgic, to look back at the highlights and lowlights of the 12 months
just gone.
Last week the New York Times, a publication usually not given to such
frivolity, even indulged with a special look back at the year in
American sport. While its attempt at tongue-in-cheek humour sometimes
fell short, as in announcing something called the Bob Arum Mendacity
Award, the Time's selection of the year's best play-by-play commentary
actually raised some smiles.
Eddie Clinton and Denny Garver were the proud recipients of the
dubious citation. The two are announcers for Plano East High School in
Texas, and the Times selected them for the excellence of their
commentary as rival John Tyler High School thwarted Plano East's
last-minute comeback during an epic football match.
The commentary went as follows: ''Oh no. Oh no, no. Oh my God. Oh God,
no. I don't believe it. I'm going to throw up.''
In the same backward-looking section, the Times made special mention
of the promoter of a no-holds-barred martial arts competition dubbed
''The Ultimate Fighting Championship.''
The vicious spectacle was broadcast at a cost of $14.95 on
pay-per-view TV and the unidentified promoter reportedly observed that a
death during the fracas ''might be good for the buy-rate.''

TODAY'S traditional Lovat Cup match between Lovat and Beauly,
scheduled for Braeview Park, Beauly, at 1pm, looks set to be shinty's
first casualty of 1995, with heavy snowfalls throughout the Highlands
set to inflict major damage on Saturday's fixtures.
If play is at all possible for this annual match, which was cancelled
last year due to snow and a frost-bound pitch, it will be switched to
Lovat's pitch at Balgate, which is better able to cope with fluctuations
in weather conditions.
Lovat's players, in fact, headed for Inverness at the weekend to the
district council's all-weather pitch in a bid to keep themselves in
shape for the impending challenges of what could be a dramatic season
for them.
They are now almost certainly involved in a straight fight with Skye
for the fourth qualifying place from the north for next season's
national league.
Saturday is due to be the first day's play after the festive break and
any further inclement weather would mean that shinty's administrators
will head into the new year carrying more hangovers than most.
High on the list of priorities for the administrators will be a new
sponsor for the Camanachd Cup, the game's blue riband, which gets under
way within the next few weeks.
Glenmorangie's 18-year association with the game comes to an end in
June, and although the administrators have been making positive noises
about inquiries from interested parties, any prolonged delay in securing
a backer would be a serious blow.
The game's finances in general will be one of the main talking points
for the next few months with invitations shortly being issued to clubs
for the new national league structure which takes effect from the start
of next season.
The success of the new league, to be piloted for a year, could well
hinge on clubs' success in securing a share of the funding available
from sources such as the #12m which will come from the Scottish Sports
Council for capital projects.
Shinty clubs were warned at their annual meeting in May that there was
no room for complacency as far as funding was concerned.
0 One other related matter which remains to be resolved is the
position of league sponsors Marine Harvest, who retain an option on the
first year of the national league.
Camanachd Association president Duncan Cameron already has indicated
that an early answer will be sought.

FORMER Wimbledon tennis champion Pat Cash marked his latest comeback
by leading Australia into the Hopman Cup quarter-finals with a 2-1 win
over seventh seeds South Africa in Perth yesterday.
Cash, sidelined for two years by injury, beat veteran Christo van
Rensburg 7-5, 6-2 to keep Australia in the tie and then linked with
Kristine Radford to win the decisive doubles 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (11-9).
The South African pairing of Van Rensberg and Amanda Coetzer were
expected to possess too much doubles experience, but Cash's remodelled
serve helped clinch a fluctuating second set tie-break.
The 1987 Wimbledon champion, now 29, underwent back surgery last year
after previous lay-offs with Achilles tendon and knee problems, yet
insists he will soon be back beating the world's best.
''I was a bit nervous,'' he admitted. ''There was a big crowd and it
was the first time I've played in Australia for a while. It's been a
long hard slog, but I feel good.''
Australia will hope for a similar result when they travel to South
Africa for the Davis Cup first round next month, but their immediate
task is to upset the top-seeded Czech Republic on Tuesday.
If they are to have a chance, Radford will need to improve on her
performance against world No.18 Coetzer in the women's singles, as the
South African comprehensively defeated her 6-1, 6-1. Results:
Australia 2, South Africa 1. Details (Australians first) -- K Radford
lost to A Coetzer 6-1, 6-1; P Cash beat C van Rensburg 7-5, 6-2; Radford
and Cash beat Coetzer and van Rensburg 7-6, 7-6).
Austria 2, Argentina 1. Details (Austrians first) -- J Wiesner beat I
Gorrochategui 6-1, 7-5; H Skoff beat J Frana 6-1, 6-4; Wiesner and Skoff
lost to Gorrochategui and Frana 4-6, 5-7.

DAN Marino, playing at home in the Joe Robbie Stadium, outplayed Joe
Montana on Saturday in a shoot-out between two of American football's
greatest quarterbacks.
He threw for two touchdowns and the Miami Dolphins capitalised on two
late turnovers to beat Kansas City 27-17 in the NFL play-offs. AFC East
champions Miami visit the AFC West champions, San Diego.
In the first Montana-Marino contest since the 1985 finale, Marino
completed 22 of 29 passes for 257 yards. Montana hit 26 of 37 passes for
314 yards and two touchdowns.
The Green Bay Packers contained the league's rushing champion, Barry
Sanders, and held off a late Detroit drive to beat the Lions 16-12 in
the NFC wild-card.
And yesterday, Vinny Testaverde passed for 268 yards and one
touchdown, leading the Cleveland Browns past the New England Patriots
20-13.
The Browns backed Testaverde with a defence that intercepted New
England quarterback Drew Bledsoe three times.
Cleveland now meet archrivals, Steelers on Saturday in Pittsburgh.

MASTER Oats put himself in the forefront of the Grand National picture
when he galloped through the mud at Newbury to land the Welsh National
by 20 lengths.
Norman Williamson's mount made light of his 11st 6lb burden and in so
doing tightened his hold on the ante-post market for this year's
National at Aintree.
On the testing conditions he relishes, Master Oats was just pushed out
over the last two fences to beat Earth Summit, with Party Politics 25
lengths back in third.
Now trainer Kim Bailey is prepared to take on the best if the
conditions are correct.
''If he gets very soft ground at Cheltenham then he will go for the
Gold Cup in which he would take all the beating. But I don't think he
would win on good ground,'' said Bailey. ''But over four-and-a-half
miles at Liverpool the ground would make no difference.''
Jockey Norman Williamson was well pleased with his partner's
performance: ''He didn't put a foot wrong and we never had a moment's
worry with a circuit to go,'' he said. ''He ran a bit free early on when
the pace was slow.''
The race was scheduled to be run at Chepstow early last week, but that
fixture was sunk by heavy rain, and the switch from the Welsh track,
where Martin Pipe has won five of the last six Welsh Nationals, brought
no joy for the former champion trainer.
Lord Relic, 5-2 joint favourite with Master Oats, broke down after
having jumped the eighth and returned in a horse ambulance, while Chatam
fell at the second-last.
Lo Stregone emerged as a Grand National outsider when easily landing
the Ladbroke Gold Cup. Left clear by the fall of Don't Tell The Wife
three out, Lo Stregone was eased home to earn a 33-1 quote for Aintree.
''We have long thought he was a National horse but were not sure he
was good enough until now,'' said trainer Tom Tate. ''He is a staying
chaser who just goes that one pace and ought to operate round Aintree''
Lo Stregone completed a double for jockey Jamie Osborne, who survived
a momentary scare on Berude Not To before the talented novice produced
the effort to pass Great Marquess and take the Challow Hurdle.
* DEAN Gallagher is excited at the prospect of renewing his
partnership with Dubacilla at Sandown on Saturday.
The rider rode Dubacilla to big-race victories at Ascot and Cheltenham
for trainer Henry Cole last season, only to lose the mount when the mare
was transferred to David Nicholson in the summer.
But a suspension for Nicholson's stable jockey Adrian Maguire means
Gallagher is likely to reclaim the ride in Saturday's Anthony Mildmay,
Peter Cazalet Chase.
''It has not been confirmed but it is near enough certain that I will
ride Dubacilla on Saturday,'' said Gallagher, ''and I am over the moon
about it -- it's what I have been waiting for. I have ridden some good
Flat horses but she is certainly the best jumper I have partnered.''
Gallagher was impressed with the mare's most recent outing when she
finished second to Raymylette in the Betterware Cup at Ascot. ''That was
a very good run, giving away a lot of weight to a horse who was 12-1 for
the Gold Cup,'' he said.
With Maguire likely to choose stable-companion Barton Bank in the Gold
Cup, Gallagher is hoping to partner Dubacilla again and make up for last
year's absence from the race.

THERE is nothing sinister about Jodami's absence from the Cheltenham
Chase this afternoon.
Trainer Peter Beaumont said that his 10-year-old ''is in great form''
and will be out at Haydock later this month. There are no problems with
the horse -- he is right as rain. We took him out of the Cheltenham race
because the ground will be too bad for him.
''It will be either frosty or very heavy and there is no point in
running on very bad ground. I am disappointed he can't run but we will
wait now for the Peter Marsh Chase at Haydock on January 21.''
Jodami had been set to return to the scene of his 1993 Gold Cup
triumph to bid for his first clear round of the season.
He parted company with Mark Dwyer on his reappearance in the Tommy
Whittle Chase at Haydock last month, then was remounted to finish second
after a fall in the Rowland Meyrick Chase at Wetherby on Boxing Day.
After a fall at Catterick on Saturday, Dwyer yesterday declared
himself fit to ride today.
The Irishman gave up his remaining rides after a fall on Judicial
Field at the weekend, but said yesterday: ''I am fine now. I had a
slight shoulder injury but there are no problmes and I will be fit to
ride tomorrow.''
* BUTLER'S Twitch looked impressive when taking the novice chase at
Nottingham.
Re-routed following the abandonment of Newbury's Friday card, trainer
Oliver Sherwood capitalised on this four-runner race to find the
seven-year-old a winning opportunity for his seasonal reappearance.
Mark Richards, the winning rider, said: ''He surprised me by what he
had in the tank at the last. I gave him a breather over the far side and
let him just go about his work in the straight.''
Finbar Leahy looked good value for his 5lb claim when making just
about all on the Kim Bailey-trained mare Countess Veruschka. Held up to
get the trip last time out, Leahy decided to make this a test of stamina
over an extended two miles five furlongs.
The young Irishman who had joined Kim Bailey at the start of the
current season was recording his fifth success for the stable out of his
total of 10 to date.
Strath Royal, under Martin Brennan, made a successful debut in
handicap chase company when recording his fifth success at Colwick Park.
After the race trainer Owen Brennan, father of the jockey, said: ''He
was never the best of jumpers over hurdles but Martin said the quicker
he went, the better he was.''

RED Rum yesterday celebrated his thirtieth birthday ''tucked up snugly
in his box.''
Owner Ginger McCain said at his farm on the Marquess of Cholmondeley's
estate in south Cheshire that the three-time Grand National winner had
received dozens of visitors all week and more than 300 cards.
''He had a few visitors this morning but it has been sleeting and
snowing and the weather is a bit miserable so he's tucked up snugly in
his box.''
McCain said Red Rum would not getting any special titbits. ''It's just
an ordinary day for him really, but it's nice to know so many people
still care about him.''
Three years ago the great chaser survived a severe illness caused by a
blocked artery but McCain said: ''He's grand. Fingers crossed, he's good
for a year or two yet.
Well-wishers have sent greetings from all over the world and several
included cash to buy the horse a treat such as his beloved Polo mints.
One fan sent a gift-boxed single red rose -- which he ate.
McCain added that Red Rum's true birthday is on May 3, when he
receives a lot more good wishes.
Red Rum won the National in 1973, 1974, and 1977 and was runner-up in
1975 and 1976.
He had another career after his retirement from the turf -- opening
pubs, supermarkets, and betting shops.

PROSPECTS for Ayr's new year holiday meeting going ahead today are in
the balance, with overnight frost forecast and an inspection due this
morning.
After a mid-day inspection yesterday, Ayr general manager Mark Kershaw
said: ''We could have raced today. We had a sunny morning and by the
time we inspected, the overnight frost had come out of the ground.
''More frost is forecast but whether we race or not depends on its
severity. If we get minus one or two we will race. If it's minus four or
five we will not.''
The meeting, which traditionally attracts a large holiday crowd, was
originally threatened because the course was waterlogged following heavy
rain, but it had dried out by Saturday.
After having dominated the Boxing Day meeting with four out of six
winners, Scottish trainers are full of confidence. Of the five runners
in the Ayr New Year Handicap Hurdle, three -- Aragon Ayr, Palacegate
King, and Family Line -- carry local hopes.
In the other feature race, the Vulmidas Trophy Chase, Scottish
trainers are represented by Kambalda Rambler, Barney Rubble, The
Lorryman, Gala Water, and Corby Knowe.
Peter Monteith, with 11 winners, starts the new year never having been
out of the lead in The Herald's Scottish trainers' championship.
A week ago he had an advantage of five over his nearest rival, Len
Lungo, but in consecutive days at Wetherby and Newcastle, the
Dumfriesshire trainer won with Oat Couture and Noyan.
Monteith, who celebrated his forty-sixth birthday yesterday, has four
runners at Ayr this afternoon, and if racing goes ahead could have his
first winner of 1995 with Glindigo or Astrac Trio.
Although he is enjoying one of his best seasons with three more
winners than he had at this stage last year, Monteith is aware Lungo is
breathing down his neck and his stable is running into form.
''Everything is working to plan so far but I recognise Len has more
horses and more ammunition than I do. So I suppose he must still be
favourite to come out on top,'' he admitted.
Reflecting on what might have been had he not lost the mare, Dizzy, in
a fatal fall in the Scottish Champion Hurdle in April, Monteith said:
''If she had survived to go chasing I could have had 15 or 16 winners by
now.''
He has also lost the services for the remainder of the season of
novice chaser Flash of Realm, who won three out of four races before
being claimed and subsequently bought back at Musselburgh last month.
Master Bavard, winner of a three-mile hurdle last month, is now
regarded as the best horse in the yard, and Monteith is confident the
seven-year-old, at present on a mid-winter break, will have more
successes in the spring.
Monteith has 26 horses in training, and among those expected to do
well are Aragon Ayr, who is due to make his seasonal return in today's
New Year Hurdle at Ayr, in which he finished second to Westholme last
year.
At present leased to a group of members at Kelso racecourse, Aragon
Ayr was successful three times from nine starts last season. Others
expected to win soon are home bred-Rallegio, a good second to Noyan at
Musselburgh, Emperor Alexander, who won for Lord Huntingdon at Goodwood,
and Wild Rose of York, a highly rated juvenile claimed out of Mark
Johnston's yard.
The Herald Leading Scottish National Hunt Trainer Award runs until
June. The winner will receive a cheque for #1000 and a trophy at a
dinner in the Stakis Glasgow Airport Hotel on June 23.
The current position is Peter Monteith 11; Len Lungo 8; Colin Parker
5; Tom Dyer 4; Susan Bradburne and Jim Goldie 3.
* PAT'S Jester, runner-up to The Fellow in the 1992 King George VI
Chase, has been retired after having broken down at Wetherby on Monday.
* TODAY'S scheduled meetings at Market Rasen, Leicester, and Catterick
have been abandoned because of frost.

THIS may be the start of a New Year, but the end of the tax year is
fast approaching and are you sure you have used all of the allowances
and reliefs available to you?
Read on to see whether there is any action you could take before April
5, 1995, to reduce your tax liabilities.
Income Tax
Where does investment income arise?
A married couple with investment income can ensure that investment
income is received by a spouse whose personal relief would otherwise be
lost, saving a potential #1378 of income tax.
Also by transferring assets so that investment income is received by a
spouse who is a 20% taxpayer rather than a 40% taxpayer could
potentially save a further #4740 for the year.
Where age allowance is involved the savings may be even greater.
Pension
Contributions
Have you made sufficient pension contributions to either your
employer's scheme or alternatively to your own pension plan?
Contributions to an approved pension scheme attract tax relief at your
highest income tax rate and pension funds also benefit from tax-free
growth as well as potentially providing a tax-free lump sum on
retirement.
If you are a member of a scheme operated by your employer, the maximum
permitted contribution will be 15% of your earnings (including benefits
in kind) possibly subject to an earnings cap of #76,800, although your
contributions to the scheme are likely to be substantially less than
this.
You could pay the difference by way of Additional Voluntary
Contributions which may be to your employer's scheme or alternatively to
an external scheme. Before you make these contributions, however, you
should check that they will result in further pension benefits being
available to you on retirement.
If you are not in a pension scheme operated by your employer but are
in employment or self-employment, you will be able to make contributions
to a personal pension scheme and the maximum relief available will be
between 17.5% and 40% of your earnings (depending on age) subject to the
same cap of #76,800.
If you make contributions sufficient to use your total relief for that
year you may in addition pay contributions to use any unused relief
which has arisen in the past six years, subject of course to you having
sufficient earned income in the current year to absorb all of these
contributions!
Savings
Every individual over the age of 18 is eligible to open a Tax Exempt
Special Savings Account (TESSA). Provided that the capital within the
TESSA is left untouched for the five-year term of the account, the
interest accrues free of income tax.
If the interest is required for any reason, then the interest net of a
retention representing the equivalent of basic rate income tax may be
withdrawn without prejudicing the tax-exempt status of the account.
The maximum amount which may be so invested is #9000 over a five-year
term. Those people who opened accounts at the earliest possible time
(January 1991) will shortly be finding that their TESSA accounts are
maturing.
For these individuals the Chancellor introduced a special measure in
his Budget so that the full capital (but not the added interest) from a
maturing TESSA may be transferred to a new TESSA and thus enjoy a
further five-year period of tax-free interest.
Capital
Gains Tax
Capital gains tax is calculated by comparing the sale proceeds of the
asset with the indexed base cost of the asset, ie the original cost of
the asset plus a statutory allowance for inflation, the indexation
allowance.
Each individual has an annual exemption of #5800 to set against gains
realised in a tax year, thus married couples could realise up to #11,600
of gains in a year before becoming liable to capital gains tax.
Where individuals have large investment portfolios and would otherwise
be wasting these exemptions, it is possible to instruct a stockbroker to
''bed and breakfast'' one or more of the shareholdings.
This is a transaction whereby the shares are sold one day and then
repurchased the following day, thus changing the base cost of the
shares.
Obviously such deals incur transaction charges by the stockbroker,
stamp duty and also there will probably be a price differential between
the proceeds received for the sale of the shares and the corresponding
price at which they are repurchased. Those costs have to be weighed
against the benefit of using the capital gains tax exemption.
Because of changes in the rules applying to indexation allowance, this
year it will be most important to review portfolios and ensure that
maximum relief is obtained.
Personal
Equity
Plans
Investments held within these plans may be realised free of capital
gains tax and the income arising within the plan is also free of income
tax, although the administration costs of the PEP provider will, of
course, have to be met out of this income.
For this reason the plans may be more attractive to higher rate income
taxpayers although everyone with a large investment portfolio who would
normally utilise their capital gains tax exemption in full could benefit
from a PEP.
Each tax year individuals may subscribe #6000 into a general PEP and
up to #3000 into a single company PEP. The rules for the two different
types of PEP are similar although, as you may have guessed, the shares
of only one company may be held in a single company PEP. A couple can
therefore shelter investments up to the value of #18,000 per year by way
of PEPs.
Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax is a tax on gifts made during lifetime or on death.
The current death rate for inheritance tax is 40% with the first
#150,000 of a person's estate being taxed at 0%. Transfers between
spouses are free of inheritance tax whether made during life or on
death. Other gifts made during lifetime to individuals are potentially
exempt transfers (PETs).
Provided the donor survives for seven years from the date of the gift,
it will become fully exempt. However, if the donor dies within seven
years, the gift is effectively aggregated with his estate on death to
obtain the total value of the estate. These lifetime gifts may then use
the #150,000 nil rate band which would otherwise have been available to
the balance of the estate as at date of death.
One of the simpler ways to reduce the value of an estate on an ongoing
basis without running the risk that the lifetime gift could become
aggregated with the estate on death is to take advantage of an annual
exemption, enabling #3000 to be gifted each year without being treated
as a PET.
If this exemption was not used in the prior year, then #6000 may be
gifted this way in the current year, but note that this unused annual
exemption may be carried forward for one year only and that the
exemption for the current year must be used first before the prior year
exemption may be used. Potentially, therefore, a couple could be in a
position to gift #12,000 free of inheritance tax.
All of these are simple ideas. Why not make a New Year resolution to
use one of them?

MORE than 200,000 revellers at major street parties throughout
Scotland made it a happy and almost trouble-free New Year.
Police reported few arrests and praised the behaviour of the thousands
who turned up at organised festivities in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen
and Dundee took to the streets despite the bitterly cold weather.
In Edinburgh, where more than 150,000 people gathered to celebrate,
there were 20 arrests. Assistant Chief Constable Tom Wood said that the
event was a great success and added: ''Those who attended are to be
congratulated on their behaviour.''
Revellers attending major organised parties in Glasgow, Aberdeen, and
Dundee were also praised by police. There were no major incidents and
few arrests.
Glasgow's George Square was packed with almost 15,000 people who were
entertained to music, comedy, and cabaret.
Aberdonians enjoyed a laser light show and live bands in Union Terrace
Gardens while a carnival was held in High Street, Dundee.
However one person was arrested in Edinburgh after police were called
to a party in a flat in Montagu Terrace. An armed response team, which
happened to be in the area, joined the back-up teams, but the incident
was over in about an hour.
In England, one man was stabbed to death, eight people were at a party
after a fire was started, and there were several assaults on police
officers injured after and several assaults on police were reported.
A teenager was being quizzed by detectives yesterday after 35-year-old
Colin McIntyre died in Northampton following a street fight.
In a separate incident in Northampton, three police officers suffered
minor injuries in a confrontation with 30 youths Seven people were
arrested.
In London's Trafalgar Square, where thousands of revellers welcomed
1995 with traditional exuberance, there were 73 arrests.
Scotland Yard estimated the crowd at 80,000, compared with 90,000 last
year. Fifty-five people were treated for minor injuries, and 25 were
taken to local hospitals for problems ranging from severe drunkenness to
crush injuries.
Six police officers suffered minor injuries as they broke up a brawl
outside a public house early yesterday in Caterham, Surrey.
Six people were arrested and have been detained.
In Bournemouth, seven people were arrested after missiles were hurled
at police and vehicles in what as described as ''drunken mayhem''during
an organised public celebration.
A policewoman was in hospital yesterday after suffering head injuries
as she and colleagues tried to arrest drunken New Year revellers in
Market Drayton, Shropshire.
West Mercia police said a number of explosive devices were detonated
during the incident in the town centre at 12.20am. Two male colleagues
-- an inspector and a special constable -- suffered bruising in the
incident. Four people were arrested.
And eight New Year revellers were taken to hospital early yesterday
after a house fire in Aldershot, Hampshire, which police believe was
started deliberately. Ten party-goers in their late teens and early 20s
had to be rescued from a first-floor window by firemen as smoke engulfed
the Victorian townhouse in the town's Queen's Road.
A man has been arrested questioned in connection with the blaze.
New Year celebrations in Devon and Cornwall resulted in a total of 42
arrests. Police said they dealt with 378 incidents across the region,
between midnight and 3am, including 167 ''999'' calls.
But in Belfast, for the first time in 25 years, the people of Northern
Ireland's main city celebrated the incoming new Year without the threat
of violence.
Catholics and Protestants put aside old differences and wished each
other a happy New Year as torchlight parades from the two communities
came together on the city's Peace Line. The RUC reported a trouble-free
night.
* In Rome, Pope John Paul II, celebrating a year-end mass of
thanksgiving, said Roman Catholics should ask God to pardon them for
their offences during the year.

IT'S not exactly Come Dancing, but it looks like a lot more fun as a
couple get into the swing of things in Glasgow's George Square.
But all good things must come to an end, even for a can of well-known
lager, as the square takes on that morning-after-the-night-before look.

MR HAPPY would have got frostbite if 15,000 warm-hearted revellers had
not ignored the freezing weather and turned up in Glasgow's George
Square for the New Year celebrations, courtesy of the city council.
They were slow in arriving at first but the party kicked off two hours
before the bells and, thanks to a musical feast ranging through
folk-rock via salsa to cajun, the square was jumping come midnight.
Four stages had been constructed in the square to house the different
types of entertainment on offer.
At midnight, however, the place to be was within earshot of Stage 1 as
comedian Gerard Kelly read out winning raffle numbers which had been
printed on the party tickets.
With the final stroke of 12, the crowd burst into Auld Lang Syne, soon
abandoned for whoops and applause as the sky above the City Chambers
erupted into a spectacular display of fireworks.
The council's department of performing arts and co-organisers UZ --
ensured that the #185,000 event ran smoothly; and the word is that its
success makes a repeat performance next year more than just a
possibility.
In Edinburgh, the year literally started with a bang when the castle
gun signalled the start of a massive party in Princes Street Gardens.
More than 150,000 revellers packed the streets, far exceeding the
organisers' expectations of a crowd of 100,000. Noisy but well-behaved,
they were flooding into the city centre from 8pm to secure prime
positions overlooking Princes Street Gardens, where Runrig headlined a
ticketed concert, and at The Mound, where bands provided free
entertainment throughout the night.
Mr Eric Smith, from Craighall, brandy glass in one hand, cigar in the
other, pronounced the event ''tremendous''.
That was the unanimous verdict, especially from the relieved
organisers.

AT the age of 65 Mickey Mouse is in fine shape and has no intention of
going into retirement. His immense eyes illuminate a happy smiling face
which is absent of crack, wrinkle or sag, and a cool black nose signals
health in good measure. Standing erect at 5ft 7in, he carries no extra
weight, doesn't smoke, drink or take drugs and with a global following
of billions it is little wonder that his smile is permanent.
Give him some female company in Minnie and lifelong companions that
will stick with him through thick and thin such as Donald and Daisy
Duck, Pluto, Goofy, Huey, Duey and Luey, add a beautiful princess
packaged with some small gentlemen friends and with glorious sunshine in
abundance you have the vital ingredients for a magic kingdom.
However, when Walt Disney built his first kingdom for a mouse at
Disneyland in California he was unable to expand the way he wished
because property developers had bought all the land around the theme
park for housing or hotels. This experience made Disney determined not
to misjudge the growth potential of his concept when he next decided to
build in Florida. And when he scanned those bare wastes in that state he
and fellow directors secretly acquired the land in small and large
parcels until they had enough to build their dreams on.
Indeed, by the time the company had finished purchasing land they had
amassed 30,000 acres which to put into perpective could well be compared
with an area equivalent to 750 Glasgow Garden Festival sites or the size
of the city of Liverpool or Birmingham. Wow.
What Disney has created in the Magic Kingdom, where mouse and man
share rank, is a dream world. A world in which greed, hunger, pain and
poverty play no significant part and where children of all sizes are
swept along, trancelike, but nevertheless determined to have fun, fun,
fun from the minute they enter its portals. Its 100 acres are made up of
seven lands each with a specific theme. You can go back to the frontier
or forward to Tomorrowland, although today is almost catching up with
the latter.
Your first contact with the Magic Kingdom will most likely be on Main
Street, USA where after a few strides you will gradually be smitten by
its lively spirit. Passing by the brightly painted buildings that are
home to stylish shops, you will invariably meet the Banjo Kings
strumming by a gas light or the Dapper Dans, a quartet of barber shop
singers, harmonising on a corner. Donald may appear from a sidestreet
and a horse-drawn streetcar or vintage car may pass and all this amid
continuous lively music.
At the end of Main Street stands the many-spired Cinderella Castle and
a focal point for much of this kingdom. Its slender towers and lacy
filigree work symbolise the classic fairy-tale castle straight from the
never-never land of make-believe.
Below the archway are five mosaic panels outlining the story of
Cinderella. More than one million pieces of Italian glass in 500
different colours with slivers of gold and silver have gone in to the
making of these panels which mesure 15ft high by 10ft wide.
Apart from these pleasures in this fantasy world of silent gobsmacked
children and litter-free streets there are thrills as well and the three
mountains, Space, Splash and Thunder will turn you inside out. A recent
addition is Splash Mountain which is much the same as its neighbour,
Thunder Mountain. The runaway route has a watery course which climaxes
in a near-vertical dive into a cave of frothing water.
Also new is the ''live theatre'' presentation of the Lion King where
no strings are attached to the animals who appear to move about on rails
but in fact are manipulated by human ''animateers'' hidden from the
audience's view.
More than 40 attractions embrace the Magic Kingdom and many require
queuing. Don't miss the three mountains, Pirates of the Caribbean, the
Jungle Cruise, Hall of Presidents, Legend of the Lion King, the daily
parade and the electrical parade in the evening, and for its lovely
innocence, Carousel of Progress.
But it is not fun, fun, fun all the way and even Mickey has to learn
about the land, sea and solar system. Consequently, the Experimental
Prototype Community of Tomorrow, Epcot, was created on a 250-acre site
so that our mouse was not deluded into thinking America is the world and
beyond whose shores lies no brouhaha, razzamatazz or wow. A World
Showcase was also created on the lower part of Epcot to provide an
insight into the cultures of others.
Shaped rather like a figure eight, the top loop contains pavilions
that take serious subjects and explains them in a way that is
entertaining as well as educational.
Spaceship Earth, a large golf ball-like structure, lies just beyond
the entry turnstiles. In a ''time-capsule'' carriage you travel through
an era that begins in a tunnel which smells like the Underground and on
through the centuries into the future and outer space. Having
established this peak of technical innovation, Disney proceeds to use
similar devices to explain the worlds of energy, horizons, nature,
imagination, land and sea.
On either side of Spaceship Earth is Epcot's newest attraction (opened
three months ago), Innoventions, a showcase that takes a glimpse at what
our High Street stores will be selling in a few years.
Worry not about losing your recently acquired mobile phone, it soon
will be miniaturised and strapped to your wrist. Or how about a digital
still camera for Christmas 1995? Perhaps you might have a notion for the
latest computerised guitar or piano? And for the person who has
everything the global position locating system will sit comfortably in
the Rolls.
More than 200 of the latest video games, many not yet marketed, await
the fanatic's grasp and the virtual reality experience is there to put
you behind the wheel of a racing car.
Each of the 11 countries represented in the World Showcase has built
from its heritage, and located around a vast lagoon are minarets from
Marrakesh in the same frame as the Eiffel Tower and the Doge Palace.
It's slightly more than a mile around the lagoon and an afternoon can
easily slip by as you tumble in and out of each country's showcase.
America's vast colonial house is a must visit and here the story of the
country's history unfolds using figures created by Disney animatronics,
whose reality calls for the pea-shooter test to establish life or latex.
At the Disney MGM Studios our rodent friend keeps a lower profile
apart from hanging his hat on a water tower. Here the regular film-goer
will have found heaven. Dressed in the style of the thirties and
forties, Hollywood Boulevard oozes Art Deco and streamline moderne
architecture.
Be prepared to be mistaken for a superstar by one of the many roving
television ''reporters'' or autograph hunters. And don't be surprised to
meet aspiring starlets and famous characters from the past as you stroll
around.
The studios are located on a 110-acre site and house the many
production centres associated with the making of films and TV
programmes. Tours around the studios reveal the special effects and
techniques used in film-making. Apart from those tours, special shows
such as the Indiana Jones stunt spectacular entertainingly display
secrets of their business.
In a leisurely meander you should not miss the Great Movie Ride, Jim
Henson's 3-D Muppet show, Catastrophe Canyon and the Star Wars virtual
reality trip.
For evening entertainment Pleasure Island may make your night. The
six-acre park is laid out like a small village with an aim to entertain.
Its seven nightclubs have themes going from jazz to rock to country and
western plus restaurants and shops and a 10-screen theatre complex.
But for something completely different try the Neon Armadillo. A
country and western drawl hangs in the air, however, there are no whoops
and hollers and howdy-yahs. Instead the dance floor is packed with rows
of macho cowboys, gunless for the night, their faces strained in
concentration and doing what appears to be the slosh at a geriatric
pace.
The floor clears and the music starts up again. It seems to be the
same rhythm, perhaps the music is being played backwards. Gradually the
unenthusiastic posse drags itself on to the floor and goes through a
birdie dance routine. It turns out to be line dancing, serious stuff.
Back in the street the party is in full swing because in this part of
the resort every night is Hogmanay (what a good idea), and at the stroke
of midnight confetti hisses out of pipes cascading on to revellers while
squibs turn night into day.
There seems no end to the additional attractions being created at
Disney World and opening this year is Blizzard Beach, a dedicated water
sports complex while nearby Schwarzenegger, Willis, Stallone and Moore
are to open a branch of their Planet Hollywood restaurant chain.
Accommodation has not been neglected either and the recently opened
All-Star Resorts offer budget rooms in a sports or musical setting with
equipment and instruments acquired from the Land of the Giants making an
astonishing display. In Center Court at the Sports Resort the cola cans
are big enough to hold a wine lake and the baseball bats propped against
the hotel are the length of a Corporation bus.
The theme continues at the music resort with giant trombones, banjos
and guitars swinging to the beat. Each resort has 1920 bedrooms that
will sleep a family of four for $69-$79 per night. A free bus service
connects all the attractions on the resort to the hotel.
Current prices for entry to the resort are: one-day, one-park ticket
$36; four-day park hopper pass $134; five-day pass $179; Pleasure
Island, one evening, $14.95 (over 18s). All prices exclude tax. There is
a small reduction in prices for children aged three to nine.
Delta Airlines is recognised as the official airline of Disney World
and also that of next year's Olympic Games in Atlanta. The airline flies
from many British airports to Orlando.
SITUATED in a compact corner of Sunset Boulevard district of MGM is
The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, Disney's latest piece of hi-tech
wizardry that measures nine on the fear factor scale and guarantees to
raise the hairs on the back of your neck.
The condition of the near-200ft high building looks unsafe with gaping
holes in its structure. Apparently an entire wing was attached to this
damaged wall and its disappearance is still a mystery. Bad vibrations
continue when you enter the empty hotel lobby and you can almost reach
out and touch the screams that whistle past like an express train.
The plot is based on Rod Serling's Twilight Zone show and after this
prelude to terror you are fully committed to the shocks that lie ahead
in the library. A flash of lightning brings a television to life nd
''guests'' are reminded of the night 55 years ago when merry-makers
disappeared from the elevator and stepped into a nightmare.
Proceeding to go where no man has since been, you pass the hotel
boiler room to an old service elevator. On the ding of the bell a brave
20, secured only by a lap bar, take a journey past hallways filled with
spectral images to a non-existent 13th floor. Doors open in the tower to
give a view out over the site occupied by the studios, then suddenly...
If you want to increase your thrill the second time round try raising
the lap bar, which sits on the highest knee, a couple of inches. This
will ensure you go up a wee bit before going down.
WOW
The geosphere that is Spaceship Earth weighs one million pounds, is
164ft in diameter and 180ft high. It stands on six legs supported by
pylons sunk 100ft into the ground.

WHEN The Farmer's sons and heirs were just changing from sweet little
boys to Wasting Assets, they invited their friend Hugh to come to Little
Ardo for a shoot.
They would borrow The Farmer's guns, which at that time ran to a
single shot four-ten, and an old double barrel twelve bore. Those were
the days before The Farmer's armoury complied with the law, and was
securely under lock and key, so I'm not sure that they had permission.
No matter, the three boys and the two guns, spent a harmless day
parading the fields in a fashion so guileless -- that they were more
danger to themselves than to any wildlife. At last, however, the three
game bags (North Eastern feed bags with baler twine for straps) still
empty, approached the steading.
The Wasting Assets with the twelve bore from the north, and Hugh with
the four-ten from the south. The idea, which was sound enough, was that,
in fleeing from the Assets, the game would fly straight into the range
of young Hugh, and vice-versa.
It worked too. Nothing was actually shot, but several Blackbirds and a
feral pigeon were surprised by being shot at as they fled.
But then the Assets heard a scream of terror from the other side of
the steading. Hugh had thrown his gun from him in panic at his success,
and raced round to his friends. ''There was this low-flying goose, and
I've shot -- and it's deed.''
''What a success,'' you may think, but the Assets were not impressed.
And they weren't fooled by the assertion that it was low-flying.
''No, no, Hugh. That goose had a name. That's one of our geese the
Bantie hen has been raising. And anither thing. They canna' flee.''
I think it was then that Hugh decided to emigrate, though that was an
unnecessary step. Like many a hard-pressed mother, she had likely been
glad to have one fewer to look after.
It was bad enough at night climbing up on top of the one remaining
goose and spreading her wings to keep it warm, and the goose five times
her size, without having two to get under her wings. And I only found
out what happened to the second-last goose on Christmas day some 15
years later.
That came out at the Christmas dinner table. Isn't it wonderful what a
healer time is? Fifteen years ago, the Wasting Assets would have faced
death rather than admit to that killing, and they might even have faced
death if they had.
There were a few such moments at that table and, despite knowing that
most will seem better to The Farmer and his family than to others, I'll
try you with what my mother said when she was 80 to her second
great-grandchild. We thought her pretty demented at that time, and yet
the story shows that there was a good deal of wit there yet. The three
year old asked: ''Are you old, Jean?,'' to which her great grandmother
replied: ''No, but I've been young for a very long time.''
We also got a bit fed up of the jokes in the crackers. Surely we could
do better than that? The trouble is, that many of the jokes we like
wouldn't be thought appropriate. No jokes about sex, religion, or race,
for example.
In the end, we only could agree on one. It had the advantage of being
a poem as well as a joke.
''Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
I'm schizophrenic,
And so am I''
The Recovery Stock was very proud of that one, until the youngest
Investment pointed out that you couldn't put that in a cracker in case
it was bought by the family of a schizophrenic. ''You're a high priest
of pendantry,'' says The Farmer.
She fixed him with a steely stare: ''PriestESS.''
She stays in Edinburgh. I suppose that is Bohemian repartee. God
preserve me from it.
The Farmer missed Santa again this year. He had left out a good dram,
just in case he wasn't back from seeing to the cow that had the Caesar.
The Farmer made it a big one of his best malt, and put in the water
himself -- because he knows Santa Claus hates it drowned.
The three grandchildren, who are old enough to wonder, are wondering
at the physical resemblance between Suntie and The Farmer. They are also
suspicious at the voice which, especially when he gets annoyed, is just
like The Farmer's.
They also think there is something familiar about the sharn on
Suntie's wellies. But imagine the triumph of the eight year old when she
spied something else: ''Suntie, why are you wearing Granda Charlie's
watch?''
''Shut up and open your presents,'' the old gentleman snapped, just
like a real Santa.
As he was leaving, Santa gave the assembled company a salutary lesson.
''To whom,'' he said, ''do I give the invoice?''
''I thought it was for nothing,'' gasped the Bohemian from Edinburgh,
who was escorting the unmarried investment.
Santa blew a fuse.
''Free is it? I'll give ye free. This is Christmas Day boy, I'll have
you know. Do you think if I wasna' on double time I wouldna' be at hame
enjoying my own Christmas wi Mrs Santa, instead of dishing out all these
presents to a puckle o' spoiled brats?''
Feeling the better of his outburst, Santa calmed down.
''Anyway, you don't have to pay it this year. It's just a dry run for
next year, after we've went privatised.''

WITH the New Year comes the inevitable glance over the shoulder at the
year that's gone, and the look ahead to what the future may bring.
Government Ministers and farmers' leaders are no exception to this
trend. Even accountants offer a word of advice for the future -- and
free advice at that.
Scottish Office Agriculture Minister Sir Hector Monro takes a positive
view, as befits a Minister of the Crown -- and a newly-wed to boot. He
seeks to dispel the prophets of doom with the good news that Europe will
continue to provide for the farming industry.
''Government support for farming remains undiminished -- indeed it is
on the increase,'' he says. ''Direct payments to producers under the CAP
schemes has increased from #180m in 1992, to #281m in 1993. This figure
is expected to exceed #300m in 1994, and next year there is likely to be
a still further increase.''
A bit less buoyant is John Ross, president of the National Farmers'
Union of Scotland, who expresses the fear that the reformed CAP may not
be able to withstand the strain of GATT, and the enlargement of the
European Union.
He offers a more ''sleeves rolled up for work'' approach to the new
year, with the comment: ''Things don't stand still -- that's for sure.
And in 1995, we'll be gearing up for talks on the future of the reformed
CAP.''
For the crofting community, Mr Alastair MacIver, president of the
Crofters Union, is less enthusiastic than the Minister about the level
of Government support for farming. ''The November budget, and the
announcement of Hill Land Compensatory Allowance levels, was another
opportunity missed to help ease the pressure on producers in the
Highlands and Islands,'' he says.
''The policy continues to direct support to the larger, more
competitive producers, to the detriment of crofting communities.''
However, to return to Sir Hector, he is of course in favour of
competition. He cites as an example the de-regulation of milk marketing
arrangements which, he says, will bring long-term benefits. In the
short-term, those affected by the problems of job losses,
over-production, and lack of quota, may disagree with him.
Looking ahead, he forecasts that the implementation of the GATT
agreement will bring both increased competition and opportunities for
Scottish producers, from farmers through to food procesors. With new
marketing, processing, and development schemes, the Government's aim is
to maximise the undoubted potential to increase sales of Scottish
quality produce both at home and abroad.
''Care of the countryside will continue to be an important focus of
attention in the years ahead,'' he says. The Environmentally Sensitive
Areas Scheme continues to be a great success, and the Organic Aid Scheme
and the Habitats Scheme have also been launched. Further schemes to
conserve heather moorland and assist informal recreation of set-aside
land are also due to be introduced next year,
''With the help of these and other support measures, I have no doubt
that the industry is in a good position to prosper in 1995.''
From the NFUS stable, Mr Ross sets out his priority as ensuring that
the necessary fine-tuning to the CAP ''won't end up without farmers'
interests being sacrificed.'' There's work to be done on the livestock
schemes, and also on getting real resources into the environmental
measures which will be very important in Scotland,'' he says. ''We shall
continue to fight to keep our hills and uplands in good heart, and we
must get a lasting solution to the arable overshoot problem. Also, we
must get our marketing right.''
The hills and uplands, at least in the Highlands and Islands area,
will be considerably helped by the #20m support promised under the
Highlands and Islands Agricultural Programme, which attracts Objective 1
funding from the European Commission.
Like the US Cavalry, however, that help is coming not a moment too
soon, according to the New Year message from Mr MacIver, the Crofters
Union president.
Abnormal weather, poor lambing, and a lower than average fodder crop,
combined to make 1994 an unkind year for crofters. After the
''shambles'' of the 1993 national reserve allocation, many crofters, he
says, were left with livestock, but no quota. ''It seems very harsh that
the Government should penalise crofters for using their own initiative
and resources, without recourse to overdraft facilities, accountants,
and formal business plans.
The budget increases on diesel and petrol, on top of everything else,
simply adds to the general depression in the Highlands and islands, adds
Mr MacIver.
However, despite the prospects of GATT, CAP reform, the ongoing debate
on land reform, and the increased costs of freight to Orkney and
Shetland, he summons up all his reserves of optimism and forecasts that
crofting will not only survive the ravages of 1994, but will look
forward to a better 1995.
No doubt 1995 will be a better year, but only if the taxman doesn't
spoil it for you.
We are grateful to accountants Pannel Kerr Foster for an insight into
some of the mistakes misguided folk make when trying to avoid paying
their dues. The shoe-box under the bed routine is apparently still
popular, but was stymied in one case when the tax inspector was able to
demonstrate that the surplus cash involved could not have emerged from a
shoe-box -- there was just too much of it. The lesson here is -- do your
homework.
In another case, a full-scale marital row broke out in the Revenue
office when the inspector revealed the amounts claimed as ''wife's
wages.'' Always take the wife into your confidence.
The Revenue like to see written records maintained on a daily basis.
This apparently springs from one case where the subject under
investigation claimed that he wrote his records up once a week.
In between times, he kept the figures in his head. The inspector,
cunning chap, proceeded to ask him to write down the figures on a piece
of paper and then, by the end of the interview, contrived to ''lose''
them.
On being asked to reproduce his figures, the taxpayer failed
miserably. If you plan to take on the Revenue, develop a good memory.

FAR from restricting Personal Equity Plans in the Budget as some had
feared, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke actually extended the scope of PEPs
into an area which is likely to find considerable appeal with income
seekers.
This did not involve a gilt PEP which optimists had dreamed of but the
next best thing, a PEP to invest in convertible shares and corporate
bonds of non-financial companies and Preference shares. These will be
allowable within General PEPS from April 6, with the usual proviso that
they are confined to UK or European Union companies.
It means that from that date PEP providers will be able to offer a
high and secure yield with good security of capital, something that to
the undoubted irritation of investors they have been unable to do up to
now. Corporate bonds are issued by companies and are like gilts in that
they pay a fixed rate of interest and are redeemed on a stated date.
They are naturally not considered quite as safe as Government-backed
gilts so their returns exceed gilts by a greater or lesser margin
depending on the financial strength of the company concerned.
Preference shares can be undated or have a fixed life and also pay a
level return. They rank behind bonds but ahead of equity shares in a
wind-up and so have higher returns than corporate bonds. Quality
Preference shares yielding 10.5% are available, while the equivalent
bond would yield a percentage point less.
Convertibles -- actually often convertible Preference shares -- are a
half-way house between fixed interest and Ordinary shares. They carry a
fixed dividend until the redemption date but at a specified time or
times are convertible into Ordinary shares. They yield more than
Ordinary shares but less than normal Preference shares or corporate
bonds. The usual pattern is that they behave more like fixed interest
stocks when the conversion date is distant and more like the underlying
equity when this date approaches.
None of the new options preclude the possibility of capital loss.
Bonds and Preference shares tend to follow gilts as interest rates move
or inflation expectations change. They will also move if credit ratings
of the companies concerned alter. However there is little risk if the
debenture of a big name blue chip is selected with its price below the
maturity value and it is held until maturity.
The risk profile of a convertible is higher but less than that of the
underlying equity and they tend to smooth out the peaks and troughs, not
rising as far in a bull market and not dropping as far in a bear market.
However this is not a hard and fast rule. If the Ordinary shares fall
out of bed because the issuing company makes a mistake then the
convertible will follow.
The new PEPS will give the industry a new lease of life enabling PEP
providers to target building society investors more effectively as they
will be able to offer a high yield with minimal capital risk, exactly
what the conservative and/or elderly investor, often with many thousands
of pounds in the building society, wants.
Many fund management groups will be ready to launch such funds in
April, although those with existing convertible funds, such as Baillie
Gifford, will have the advantage of having a track record to show
prospective investors.
The only jarring note will be the high charges of many PEPs. Investors
will not be impressed if the promised high yield is reduced by one to
one-and-a-half percentage points to cover charges. These funds should
cost less to run than Ordinary share PEPs and it is to be hoped the
charging structures recognize this.
More knowledgeable investors could build their own portfolio of these
investments easily enough through a self-select PEP but this will not
necessarily reduce the charging problem as these PEPs often carry even
higher costs even if the investor is doing the work of stock selection.
The other possible problem is that the availability of corporate bonds
and Preference shares is limited and excessive demand would reduce their
yields. However this is not likely to happen in the early days and
greater demand will improve supply.
Fund managers will be eager to create new savings vehicles around the
new lower-risk PEPs, particularly relating to house purchase. PEPs are
the most tax efficient way of saving to repay a mortgage but all-equity
PEPs have a relatively high risk profile for so important a transaction.
Should the maturity date fall during a bear market then the investor
could fund his PEP worth many thousands of pounds less than it might a
couple of years earlier or later. The new PEPs will reduce the overall
level of risk. In fact managers should be able to offer a PEP having a
similar risk profile to a with-profits endowment but with greater tax
efficiency and greater flexibility.
In their early days PEPs were slow to take off but in recent years
money has been cascading into them, nearly #5000m in the last tax year
alone going into General PEPs and even more if Single Company PEPs are
included. These enable the investor to put up to #3000 per tax year into
a single company, in addition to the #6000 allowed into a General PEP.
Couples who have taken advantage of the full allowance since the start
could now have a fund topping #100,000, generating totally tax free
income and capital gain. The total so far in unit trust PEPs now tops
#11.5bn, losing the Inland Revenue over #100m in basic rate tax alone.
So it was understandable that some people thought the Chancellor would
bring in a cap on the maximum holding. This may of course follow in a
later Budget as the income tax foregone by the Treasury is really
starting to have an impact. The capital gains tax concession has had
little effect on revenues given that the first #5800 of gains is already
free of tax.

AFTER a disappointing year for a lot of unit holders, fund managers
are generally taking an optimistic line on 1995.
Whatever we may feel about things, the investment experts, looking at
the global picture, seem to have captured a feel-good factor. This
particularly applies to the UK where of course investors run no currency
risk.
Despite Mexico ending the year with a demonstration of how volatile
emerging markets can be, the pundits still see them as attractive areas
for investors willing to take the risk.
Looking around the world, Howard Flight of Guinness Flight predicts a
rise of 10% to 12% in the Footsie index with small companies doing
marginally better than this. For the US he expects a 5% rise in prices.
Taking the middle road on Japan, he sees the Nikkei index rising 12%
to 21,500. Elsewhere in the Far East, he looks for a total return of 20%
with Hong Kong being nap selection to recover ''at least 25%''.
Emerging equity markets as a whole should, he says, give returns of
around 12%. He particularly likes Thailand, India, and the Philippines
as well as Hong Kong.
At GT, Nick Train takes the view that for the UK investor the domestic
market is the first one to think about. He said: ''We would expect gilts
to generate satisfactory total returns in 1995 but it also seems to us
that there are good grounds for believing that small companies could
attract much higher values over the next couple of years.
''I would have a higher than normal weighting in gilts plus quite a
high weighting of UK smaller companies.''
Outside the UK ''the big surprise could be how well some of the
European markets do. Germany could be interesting. We might expect to
see a decline in interest rates across Europe and increases in company
earnings. But there is nothing outside the UK which looks so amazingly
attractive that we say 'put all your money there'''.
Peter Jones, research director at M &amp; G agrees. ''An area we are
particularly focusing on is continental Europe. You want to be investing
in economies where there is still a lot of room for recovery. The US is
booming and the UK is well on the way. That leaves continental Europe or
Japan.
''We are cautious about the Japanese recoveries and prefer continental
Europe. We like France in preference to Germany. It performed abysmally
in 1994.''
M &amp; G spends a lot of time visiting companies and he had the
impression that French companies had reacted to the recession more
positively than German ones and so had greater potential although there
was a political risk.
At Barclay's Unicorn, investment director John Kelly believes the
budget change allowing personal equity plan investment in corporate
bonds and preference shares means ''we will see that market becoming
quite attractive. We will get a lot more people investing in it.''
For capital growth he says ''We feel the best opportunities are to be
found overseas. Timing will be important. South-east Asia could prove
rewarding with Singapore and Indonesia looking best but we are nervous
about Hong Kong. The UK, we think, could be quite rewarding and smaller
companies could move most.''
Once interest rates have stablised he sees bonds as making ''modest
capital advances''.
Michael Hayden, managing director of Legal and General's Unit Trusts
said: ''For the highest returns we would say Japan in absolute terms
with some currency risk.
''For the UK we look for 3400 to 3450 on the Footsie to give a total
return of 14%. With building society rates 5 or 6% that is reasonable.
In Japan we see the Nikkei index at 25,000 in 12 months time.
''Profit growth from economic recovery will fuel the UK market in 1995
but it will be important to pick the right stocks.''
Clive Boothman, managing director of Schroders Unit Trusts is another
with faith in the home market although his forecast for the Footsie
index is a relatively modest 3350. He sees the signs as boding ''quite
well'' for international bonds and for shares in the UK where export
performance is strong, with all that means for the current account
balance of payment.
Looking at Japan he believes ''Patience will be rewarded in 1995.''
He said sentiment may be fickle but corporate earnings are ''growing
inexorably'' and he expects ''this will be reflected in increased buying
by domestic investors''. He predicts a 30% rise in the Tokyo market's
first section index in local currency terms.
Save and Prosper's Mike Ryder Richardson said: ''The markets we
particularly favour are the UK, Latin America and Japan. Of those we
might see very strong growth in Latin America and Japan but generally on
a risk/return basis the market which we would most favour is the UK.''
Commenting on bonds, Mr Ryder Richardson said he saw them as
''attractively valued and producing very attractive real rates of
return. In the UK, the real yield on gilts is 6% whereas it is normally
in the region of 4%.
The reason it is so high is that the market is being overly
pessimistic about inflation. We do not believe inflation is going to get
out of control.''
Once that was accepted by the market there would be more strength in
the bond market and that would strengthen the share market.
The group's investment director Mark White sees the UK's Footsie index
as going to 3500 and the Dow Jones to 4000. ASEAN countries, with Taiwan
and Korea prominent, will drive the South-east Asian regional index
higher.

ONE of Scotland's largest and fastest expanding specialists in nursing
care is opening a new home between Thornliebank and Newton Mearns.
Grampian Care Ltd, with its headquarters in Arbroath, already has homes
in Tayside and throughout the central belt and the factors which have
made them a success are being incorporated in the new purpose-built
#1.7m home in Stewarton Road.
The company philosophy is to provide patients with the highest
standard of nursing care and every detail is considered to ensure that
aim is fulfilled. Whether the patients want to sit in peace and quiet
and read a book or visit a show with fellow residents their needs will
be catered for.
Grampian Care has now been operating in Scotland for five years and
already has homes in Cardonald, Paisley, Cumbernauld, Falkirk, Forfar,
Arbroath, and Montrose. The Scottish operation is backed by an English
parent company with a wealth of experience in nursing care.
The new home will bring their total number of patients to more than
500 and they have become a significant employer with between 500 and 600
staff. For the new home 83 staff are being recruited with more than half
of them full-time employees. As well as nursing staff there are
catering, laundry, domestic, maintenance, and administrative personnel.
Grampian Care Ltd has already invested more than #15m in its Scottish
operation and it is in the middle of an expansion programme which will
see at least the same amount again being spent. Permission has been
granted for two 60-bed homes in Dundee and for others in Paisley and
Bearsden.
The patients, who all require 24-hour nursing care, come from a
variety of sources. The homes are for respite or continuing care and are
registered for both. Nearly all the homes are 60-bedded and they cater
for the elderly frail, the young disabled, and elderly mentally infirm.
However, ''young disabled'' refers to anyone under 65 and a company
spokeswoman said its policy was to provide places only for the over 45s.
''We wouldn't take anyone under 45 because we feel the age mix wouldn't
work,'' she said.
''We are the same as long-stay hospitals except we don't put our
patients in wards. They all have their own rooms with ensuite
facilities. It is an alternative to long-stay hospital care.''
Many patients find they have an improved quality of life when they
take up residence in the homes where a host of activities are arranged.
Everything, however, is patient-led. A divisional therapist organises
craft work, games, or whatever the residents desire.
Social committees are also set up in the homes involving staff and
patients. Each home has its own minibus and residents can visit the
theatre, or any other suitable activity. The minibuses have hydraulic
hoists to enable easy access for wheelchairs.
''Our patients have a hectic social life,'' the spokeswoman said. ''In
fact they have a more active social life than many people in the
community -- if that is what they want.
"They really choose how they want to spend their day but they will
have a wide choice. Two of our homes in Tayside produce their own
pantomimes which run for three nights every year.''
The new home will have quiet lounges, ones with music, others with
television. It will have a spa bath which has proved very popular with
existing Scottish patients. It provides a massage and experience
suggests that once patients try it they really enjoy it.
''We try to enable the patients to live life to the full but what they
do has to be their choice,'' the spokeswoman said.
''Some people will choose to sit in their rooms and read or watch
television whereas some others will be desperately keen to join in
everything. We involve a lot of outside organisations. Recently ladies
in one of our homes who are quite severely mentally impaired were taken
out for tea to a local hotel by the Women's Guild and they had a
wonderful time.
''Schools come in to entertain and at some of the homes Girl Guides
visit to do their badges such as ''entertainer'' and ''helper''. They
build up relationships with the patients that go beyond the activities
they are doing. ''We hope a church service will also be a fairly regular
event within the home.''

THE new #1.7m Whitecraigs Grampian Nursing Home at Thornliebank will
combine the best of eight similar homes operated by the same company
when it opens its doors.
The home, overlooking Rouken Glen golf course between Thornliebank and
Newton Mearns has been designed to cater for the every need of the 60
patients it will accommodate in 56 single and two twin rooms.
All the patients require 24-hour nursing whether they be continuing or
respite care but residents are encouraged to retain a sense of their own
personal space within the premises and they are invited to bring in
small items of furniture or pictures to personalise their room. Each
room also has its own ensuite facilities. Open visiting is encouraged.
Grampian Care's philosophy is to aim to give patients the right to
dignity and independence while providing the highest standards of
nursing care. The matron of the home is Mrs Wilma Mackay, RGN, who has
been with the company for some time and takes over her new post having
been matron in the highly successful Cardonald Grampian Nursing Home.
She will lead a team of qualified nurses, trained carers and ancillary
staff. The home will be registered by Greater Glasgow Health Board.
It has been built on two floors and the upper floor is serviced by two
lifts. Although patients can comfortably spend time in their own rooms,
each carpeted and with a remote control television, the home also has
two dining rooms, four day lounges and an open-plan sitting area on the
first floor. There are also spa baths and bath hoists in the home.
Home cooking is carried out in Whitecraig's own brand-new kitchen and
special dietary needs are catered for. Guests in the home can dine by
arrangement. Laundry is also done on the premises at no extra charge. A
hairdresser makes a weekly visit to the home and appointments can be
booked through the reception. Physiotherapy is available and a
diversional therapist helps keep the patients occupied.
Whitecraigs has fully controllable central heating and double glazing
throughout and for the warmer days there is a pleasant garden and patio
area where patients can enjoy the fresh air.
A fire alarm system which complies with the requirements of
Strathclyde Fire Brigade has been installed and there is a nurse call
system available from all areas.
At Whitecraigs particular attention has been paid to the decor
throughout the building to tailor it to the tastes of the patients.
The aim of Grampian Care is to provide residents with a high quality
lifestyle and Whitecraigs has a planned entertainment programme.
Anyone who would like to see what the home can offer is invited to an
open day on Tuesday, January 3, from 11am to 4pm. Alternatively anyone
unable to attend on this day or who would like to discuss any aspect of
the home should contact the matron on 041 621 0811.

A HEALTHY pregnancy, a loving partner, adequate finances, easy labour
and a beautiful baby, do not protect a woman from deep post-natal
depression (PND), actress Sinead Cusack told a meeting of psychiatrists
in London.
She pointed out that there is a desperate need for women to realise
this possible outcome from childbirth. They must not feel unnatural or
guilty -- as she did 16 years ago when the condition was not widely
acknowledged.
Today one mother in 10 suffers from this depression which is largely
unrecognised either by the women themselves or the professionals.
Without the understanding of either partner of what is going on, PND can
also play a considerable part in breaking marriages.
As part of their five-year campaign against all types of depression,
the Royal College of Psychiatrists launched another leaflet* to cover
this possible blight on what should be a happy experience. The onset of
post-natal depression can occur any time in the six months after having
a baby, and peaks at about one to three months. It must not be confused
with the baby blues.
Baby blues arise on the fourth to fifth day, and are a more simple
matter of feeling weepy and tired in reaction, not only to the physical
impact of giving birth, but subsequent lack of sleep and hormonal
adjustments. They usually resolve naturally soon afterward.
Post-natal depression is another matter -- and unless it is recognised
and nipped in the bud it can go on for months and even years.
How does a mother know she has a problem?
* First there is depression which means feeling low, unhappy and
wretched for most of the time. Sometimes it may be worse in the
mornings, or perhaps in the evenings. There can be good days when it
seems the problem is lifting only to be followed by more bad days.
* At a time when life is expected to be at its most joyous it may seem
that it isn't really worth living at all.
* Irritability may flare up with other children, even with the baby,
but mostly with the partner who will wonder what on earth is wrong. All
new mothers are tired but in the depressed mother it turns into utter
exhaustion.
* Despite this she is unable to sleep when she goes to bed, and if she
does succeed in falling asleep she wakes early.
* Though some women turn to compulsive eating, in others the appetite
may disappear and lack of nourishment impounds the problem.
* There is loss of enjoyment especially in the marriage act leading to
hurts and misunderstanding.
* Anxiety may be acute, combined with a feeling of being unable to
cope.
Mothers at risk:
Although there is no one accepted reason why PND develops there are
possible risk factors which make it more likely to arise in one person
than another. These are:
* A past history of depression, especially with an earlier baby.
* An unsupportive partner.
* A premature or sickly baby.
* Loss of the mother's own mother when she was only a child.
* A collection of problems like bereavement, loss of the partner's
job, housing and money troubles.
New evidence is emerging of links between PND, PMS (premenstrual
stress) -- and the menopause, suggesting imbalance of hormones.
Probably one of the greatest factors is isolation, of being imprisoned
at home and the need for adult contacts and sympathy.
Outcome:
Few mothers with post natal depression get referred to psychiatrists
-- it is generally the task of the general practice to help. Many employ
a health visitor or counsellor especially trained in the problem.
Self-help groups:
The impact of self-help groups is tremendous. Once a woman realises
she is not alone in her unhappiness and that many others feel, exactly
the same way, part of her burden lifts.
In some areas health visitors have started small groups of mothers in
their practice, who are in need of help. After a time they hand the
organisation over to the mothers themselves. Talking to another mother
who has got over her depression can be highly encouraging.
The psychiatrist's leaflet advises mothers not to move house while
they are pregnant or until the baby is six months' old, so that there is
support from neighbours who know them; andto meet other couples in the
same situation.
If there is no close friend in whom they can confide, they should
contact the National Childbirth Trust, or Mama (Meet A Mum Association).
Time should be found to have fun with their partner, get a baby sitter
and get out together.
* Leaflets available, with self-addressed envelope, from the Royal
College of Psychiatrists, 17 Belgrave Square, London, SW1X 8PG:
post-natal depression; anorexia and bulimia; anxiety and phobias;
bereavement; depression; surviving adolescence.
* PND Support Group meets every Thursday afternoon at Drumchapel
Health Centre (041-211 6166). Other contacts in the Glasgow area are the
Post-Natal Illness Group (041-440 1212) and the Stressed Mothers' Group
(041-553 2353).

VITAMINS, as vita implies, are vital for good health -- they make up
deficiencies that the body cannot naturally. We get most of our vitamins
from our diet but sometimes supplements may be necessary especially for
people on very low-calorie diets, women with heavy periods, and for
women during pregnancy. Sometimes vegetarians can also benefit from a
multivitamin supplement.
''It is not difficult at all to get all the vitamins you need if you
are eating properly and regularly a variety of foods,'' says Dr Fred
Pender, senior lecturer in human nutrition, at the Department of
Dietetics and Nutrition at Queen Margaret College in Edinburgh.
''There's been a lot in the medical press recently about abusing vitamin
supplements. There are some vitamins which are toxic if taken to excess
-- Vitamin D particularly.'' A simple rule is that if you feel the need
of extra vitamins never exceed the recommended dose.
While Vitamin D (found in margarine and butter) is essential for
healthy bones, huge doses can upset the system, leading to deposits of
calcium in the heart and kidneys. In the first 12 months of life Vitamin
D is vital in supplement form because many weaning foods don't contain
it.
Generally, it is not known exactly how vitamin supplements react with
food. It's also important that you check to make sure that any vitamin
supplements you are thinking of taking do not react with prescription
medicines. Many medicinal drugs can increase the absorption or cause
vitamins to be excreted in abnormal quantities. Common examples are
antibiotics (Vitamin B and Vitamin K); aspirin and other non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (Vitamin B6). Other forms of medication like
barbiturates or the contraceptive pill may require you to take
supplements -- your doctor will advise.
How to best supplement your diet with extra vitamins? ''Definitely
through vegetables,'' says Dr Pender. ''Recent figures have shown that
18% of Scots men don't eat any fresh fruit or vegetables at all, and
nutritionists are trying to get this figure changed.'' According to the
World Health Organisation in order to get enough vitamins you have to
eat five pieces of fruit or portions of vegetables a day.
It is thought by many experts that this ''dietary omission'' may play
a large part in the increasing rate of allergies and asthma. According
to Professor Anthony Seaton, head of Environmental and Occupational
Medicine at Aberdeen University: ''People eat about half the fruit and
vegetables that they did 20 years ago.
''This change coincides with the increase in allergies. Vitamins C and
E act as antagonists to inflammatory reactions that occur in asthma and
allergies. There may be a window of opportunity during which children
become susceptible and if they don't eat enough fruit and vegetables at
the time they develop allergies.''
Anybody who falls into one of the categories prone to vitamin
deficiency or is concerned about their diet may benefit from a general
all-round multivitamin supplement. This helps ensure that you are
getting the minimum daily requirement. However, as one American
nutritionist says: ''It would be tragic if a junk-food-plus-supplements
diet began to look as good as fresh whole foods because it doesn't even
come close!''
Vitamin supplements, especially Vitamin C, are often given to children
between the ages of six months and two years (Government policy prefers
five years). Parental knowledge about vitamin supplements is generally
poor. A recent report has shown that only 35% of the parents questioned
knew when to stop the supplements and 46% did not realise that overdoses
were potentially harmful.
On the bright side, there is a growing body of evidence that
antioxidant vitamins -- C, E, and beta carotene -- have a protective
effect against heart disease because they are thought to absorb oxygen
molecules which can cause fat to harden in the arteries. Recent American
surveys have found that Vitamin E could cut the risk of heart disease by
40%.

After huge success with Inspector Morse, John Thaw's A Year in
Provence flopped: now you must be the jury as he plays Kavanagh QC
VOTED Britain's No 1 television actor for Inspector Morse, John Thaw
had a long way to fall when his next series, A Year in Provence, turned
out to be a turkey. Which is why he will be hoping the verdict will
swing in his favour when Kavanagh QC, his first screen work since the
French experience, begins on ITV tomorrow, his 53rd birthday.
What made matters worse with Provence was that expectations had been
so high, with the hype-like hand-outs from the previous life of Peter
Mayle, author of the best-selling book about escaping from the London PR
rat race.
A private, deeply introspective man, Thaw is an interviewer's
nightmare. They end up writing about his silver hair, amazingly blue
eyes, how he doesn't like giving interviews. Quoting him as saying his
ambition is to be at home with the family, listening to classical music,
reading books. And being able to go unrecognised in the street.
Past success means he could certainly afford the luxury of obscurity
if he did not have something to prove. For more than 20 years he has
commanded top television money. He is being paid #200,000 an episode out
of the #5 million budget for Kavanagh, a four-parter which kicks off
with an extended two-hour film.
The teeth that have been drawn by persistent questioners show that he
can't understand what all the fuss was about. Provence was ''a harmless
little piece of light entertainment, on only half an hour a week''. The
critics, he believes, were not getting at him so much as Peter Mayle
because they were jealous of his financial success. Forget the critics.
Provence proved the ultimate switch-off for Thaw fans, losing 10 million
viewers along the way.
What has emerged is that he threatened to pull out before shooting
began because his actress wife, Sheila Hancock, was turned down for the
part of his screen wife on the grounds that she was too old. She is 10
years older than him. As it happened, he says, Lindsay Duncan who got
the role, was smashing.
Deep and careful thought must have gone into the
how-do-you-follow-that question. While not exactly returning to the more
secure beat of a copper's life, Kavanagh does seem set in fail-safe
territory. The tense, emotion-packed atmosphere of a criminal courtroom
has almost always worked on the screen.
Donning the wig and gown of James Kavanagh, he will be seen as one of
Britain's most successful barristers, sometimes prosecuting, at others
defending. In tomorrow's opener he is defending a young man accused of
rape. The alleged rape victim is played by Alison Steadman, recently
seen as the vitriolic wife in BBC's The Wimbledon Poisoner.
There is the added insurance of a soap element, with parallel plot
about a hellish home life. His wife, played by Lisa Harrow, has recently
returned to him after an affair with a fellow lawyer. He had been paying
too much attention to his work and not enough to her. And his two
teenage children are revolting. The concept was created by Central Films
managing director Ted Childs who commissioned the 28 Morse films.
Thaw sees a lot of himself in Kavanagh. Both overcame difficult
childhoods, fought their way up every rung of the ladder. Both had
marital problems. For the part, he is using his natural Mancunian
accent.
He was six when his mother went off with another man. He and his young
brother, Ray, had to fend for themselves with the help of neighbours in
the Manchester suburb of Longight while their long-distance-lorry-driver
father was away. He didn't meet his mother again until he was 19. The
half-hour chat went all right, but ''it was like talking to a
stranger''.
As an actor, playing other people may have been a form of escape. The
first smell of the greasepaint, the junior roar of the crowd, came when
he was aged nine playing Mistress Quickly in a school production of
Henry IV.
When he arrived for audition at RADA, contemporaries included Tom
Courtenay and Sarah Miles. He later shared a flat with Courtenay and
Nicol Williamson. Courtenay helped him to realise his love of classsical
music, the only thing he reckons he has in common with Morse.
The law and Thaw have walked hand in hand over the years. His first
professional role, at Liverpool Playhouse, was the inspector in A Shred
of Evidence. In London, aged 21, he understudied Laurence Olivier in the
play, Semi-detached. His big break came when the World's Greatest Actor
decided to take a week off. Thaw went on to acclaim, playing a
60-year-old.
His first marriage, in his early twenties, to actress Sally Alexander,
failed after two years. He and Hancock were married on Christmas Eve,
1973. They have three daughters, one from each of their previous
marriages, one from their own. Six years ago, after being diagnosed as
having cancer, she left him, to sort out her options, but returned in
less than a year, unable to stand the loneliness. He concedes that they
both learned much from the separation. It reminded him that there were
people in his life. It was not just him and his work.
Thaw's television reputation grew through the ranks of police roles.
First as Sergeant John Mann in Redcap, a tough Military Police series.
Then Jack Regan in The Sweeney, an even tougher series about the Flying
Squad. Followed by the gentle Morse, opera-lover, real-ale buff, solver
of complex crosswords, in the university atmosphere of Oxford. Morse was
watched by 16 million in the UK, by millions more in 50 other countries.
In the 18 months cooling-off period since striking camp in Provence he
has been back on the boards, getting good notices for playing the Leader
of the Opposition in the National Theatre production of The Absence of
War, now being made as a BBC television film. Although he had said he
was finished with the role, also in the pipeline is a Morse special, to
be shown next Christmas.
As Kavanagh QC comes on screen, the Thaw family will be at their
holiday home. In Provence, would you believe? He would be unlikely to
say it, but the real jury he will be hoping to sway tomorrow night is
you, the viewers.
* Kavanagh QC, ITV, 8pm tomorrow.

WHEN Paul Nesbitt was appointed exhibition director at Inverleith
House in Edinburgh's Royal Botanic Garden in 1986 he was of the firm
belief that art should be seen in a wider context, so he set about
overcoming the false divide between art and science. ''A clash of
doctrines is not a disaster, it is an opportunity. You can't just
describe the natural world in scientific terms,'' explained Nesbitt.
''Take a garden. It needs aesthetics too.'' Success has been hard won
but phenomenal, resulting in last year's UK National Art Collection Fund
Award.
For despite restrictions and constraints, (Nesbitt has to tailor his
programme to things botanical and raise the cash, ''we've only had #2000
Arts Council money in eight years''), exhibitions have encompassed both
traditional botanical drawings such as Redoute's famous 18th century
roses for Festival 1991, Treasures of the Royal Horticultural Society,
or delicate 20th century watercolours by Rory McEwan in 1988, Raymond
Booth's Japonica and Banksia in 1994, plus avant garde installations
from Andy Goldsworthy, Tim Stead, Chris Drury and, this year, Lothar
Baumgarten together with garden paintings by Adrian Berg and distinctive
modern aboriginal pictures.
Alongside this exhibition programme run theatre (the first in the
Botanic's 324 year history) workshops, outdoor sculpture (Randall Page;
Sjoerd Buisman), conferences and artists in residence. Helen Chadwick
studied and drew rare alpine plants here in preparation for a major
Swiss show. ''She could have gone to Kew but we are more friendly!''
laughs Nesbitt. Flora Danica 1994 featured experts from Denmark. Visions
of Light, an art/science symposium, featured artists James Turrell and
Liliane Lijn along with scientists, historians and theologians in an
effort to rectify this artificial separation of art and science.
The exhibitions have the advantage of being displayed in one of
Europe's most attractive galleries. Inverleith House not only sits in
beautiful gardens but a sweeping staircase leads to three floors of
elegant spacious rooms with the best views in Edinburgh. Inverleith also
welcomes families.
It was home to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art before it
moved out in 1984 to Belford Road. Then closed for two years, now
immaculately refurbished to high standard, it forms the perfect setting
for two current exhibitions, Donald Urquhart's Sylva and Michael
Porter's Shining Cliff Woods.
Urquhart's Lost Trees of Drumbuich reflects his keen concern for the
environment. Drumbuich is an area of Perthshire which means a lot to him
from days there with his forester grandfather. ''As a child, nature is
magical and fantastic: there is wonder wherever one looks. As an adult I
feel pessimism in the realisation that the landscape is polluted, with
trees bathed in acid rain and radioactivity.''
So far Drumbuich Woods are safe but as Urquhart points out, the Mull
of Kintyre is our most polluted sea; there are flammable rivers in the
US; a Russian chemical factory by the Norwegian border sits in 700 miles
of desolation with no trees or birds and the tarmigan, the world's most
northerly bird, is, like the Cairngorms and red deer, radio active. ''I
want to document the landscape before it disappears. If I look after
Perthshire I hope the Eskimos will look after Alaska and the Poles,
Poland.''
His honest exhibition includes images of solitary pines and dead
birches, veiled with smears of grey, brown and taupe paint. A subdued
palette, cold skies and forlorn subject matter makes for a dreich but
dour beauty.
A series of 24 images, The Lost Trees, uses manipulated photographic
images of trees reflected in still forest puddles. ''I came to
photography as a painter, so in the darkroom I picked up a brush and
painted with the developer. Technicians told me I couldn't play around
like that -- but I did. You don't see where the painting stops and the
photography begins. The transient nature of the images reflects the
transient nature of life: a metaphor for wider concerns.''
Glasgow based, Edinburgh trained, Urquhart has been painting full time
since 1983 and has benefitted from scholarships to Paris, Brussels,
Madrid, Slovenia (where he discovered photography) and Amiens as part of
Glasgow's excellent 1990 culture exchanges. Travelling breeds tenacity.
I once met him returning from one of many abortive trips to track down
the right pine tree in the right place by a calm puddle on a windless
day. It took two years to make the Drumbuich series but was worth it for
their memorable melancholy.
The most effective conceptual piece is Figus, a frieze of 20 almost
identical oils based on an Amiens carving of an oak leaf. ''As in nature
you never find two identical oak leaves, tarmigans, apples or people,
yet we all recognise them from their characteristics. Nature never
repeats itself. That's why it's so wonderful.''
Like Urquhart, Michael Porter has a special place: Ambergate Woods in
Derbyshire's Derwent Valley close to where he was born and raised. His
paintings reflect his long-term observation of these mysterious dark
thickets and dim glades with their cliffs, fallen tree trunks and weird
fungi.
He too works from photos but only for reference back in his East
London studio where he paints, pours, stains and collages layer on layer
of drips, mottles and glazes to create large-scale romantic pictures.
The rock surfaces in the diptych, Shining Cliff 3 1994, is truly
beautiful. ''Its lines do conform to those in the rock face. I try not
to invent things. I use photos as other artists use sketches.'' Porter's
show tours to London. I hope Urquhart's does too.
Nesbitt, one of three contributors to a superbly informative
catalogue, asked Porter if he was interested in botany or mycology.
''No! But then I'm an artist. What I'm trying to do is make people aware
what I see. It's not as a science, it's as an observation.''
Nesbitt's future plans for Edinburgh's Botanic include the British Art
Show in 1996 (shared with three other Edinburgh venues) plus Containers
'96, a mega international project from 96 cities world wide for
Copenhagen, European City of Culture 1996. The show covers Japan, Korea,
South and North America, Australia, New Zealand. Africa, the Baltic and
the North Sea. Glasgow's Botanics lost the Baumgarten exhibition to
Edinburgh earlier this year. Come on Glasgow, pull your socks up.
* Sylva and Shining Cliff Woods are at Inverleith House, Edinburgh,
open from tomorrow daily 11am-3.30pm until January 29.

FORMER neighbour John McLachlan lived alongside West in McLellan
Street near Kinning Park and has been able to provide a fascinating
insight into the life of the man suspected of being one of Britain's
worst mass killers.
Detectives involved in the Gloucester investigation travelled to
Glasgow to interview Mr McLachlan last summer. They also wanted to look
at the possibility of a further dig in the McLellan Street area but the
thoroughfare had been demolished to make way for the M8.
John McLachlan, now 56, is disabled after a series of heart attacks
and major surgery and is largely confined to his house in Glasgow's
Milton area.
It was not always so. The fate of two of Fred West's victims, the
child of one of them and the unborn baby of the other, are all bound up
with Mr McLachlan's life and actions in the mid-1960s.
By his own admission he was a wild man in his younger days, fond of
parties and fond of the girls. One of those was Rena Costello, over whom
he fought with Fred West. Her association with Mr McLachlan, then a bus
driver, at one stage probably saved her life; she resumed her
association with West, so the stay of execution was only temporary.
In the case of one of Rena's friends -- another of West's conquests --
intervention by John McLachlan did save her life. The third woman
involved, the unfortunate Anna McFall, who was young and pregnant by
West at the time, made a decision which turned out to be fatal.
John first met Rena Costello when they were near-neighbours in
McLellan Street, Kinning Park, Glasgow. She was already married to West
-- at Ledbury, Herefordshire, in 1962 -- giving birth to Charmaine, her
first daughter, in March 1963.
''I used to go to a bookie and her house was in the next close. I was
married at the time to my first wife and we had a son. But Rena was a
very bonnie lass in those days.
''We went together for a while. One night I was walking with Rena in
the park -- OK, we were canoodling. We saw West following us and we
split up. I saw West go after her and I heard Rena screaming. He was
laying into her. I ran up to West and kicked the shit out of him. I gave
him a real doing.''
John McLachlan admits that he made love to Rena while West was out
selling ice-cream from his van. But, he says, West was cheating as well
and the marriage between Rena and West was wide-open. John McLachlan
even made trips around Bridgeton with West in his Mr Whippy van and saw
West chatting up women and girls.
''I had an allotment in Kinning Park very close to West's allotment.
He had a garden hut on his where he used to take bits of stuff. Often
West would not come home until 2am or even later. What was he doing down
there? Sure as hell he was not gardening,'' says John.
Police officers indicated to him that they were interested in West and
the allotment in relation to four missing Glasgow girls and, says John,
the police added that they would consider searching with heat-seeking
equipment after the court cases involving the Wests were dealt with.
''The police have asked me about four other lassies. They may well be
planted in West's allotment which is under the M8 motorway now. West was
a coward and a bully who struck women.
''He even struck Rena's little daughter for asking for an ice-cream.
Another guy I know was struck by West -- from the back -- after an
argument. It took three other men to pull him off otherwise he would
have killed West.''
It was around this time that West left Kinning Park and moved into a
caravan at Much Marcle, Herefordshire, taking Rena and her daughter
Charmaine with her. Around five months later, John McLachlan received an
anguished telephone call from Rena which ended: ''Come down here and get
us.''
''I hired a Mini and a friend, John Trotter, and I set off down there.
There was a helluva row. Rena came with us but West would not let little
Charmaine go. Isa, her friend, came as well but Anna McFall said she
wanted to stay with West as she had the chance of a job down there. That
was the biggest mistake she ever made.''
Rena's friend Isa remained in Scotland.
''If she had gone back she would have been planted under the field in
Herefordshire as well,'' says John McLachlan.
''The reason that the daughter Anna survived was that she was too
young to tell anyone what she had seen happening to her mother, her
sister, and Anna McFall.
''Rena stayed around in Glasgow for a time. I fell out with her and
told her everything was off. She got a job as a conductress on the buses
and eventually I had to tell the foreman at the depot not to put her on
my bus because she was giving me so much trouble. She was trying to get
me back again.
''She had a house in Arden Street in Maryhill and we all used to drink
in a pub called the HLI which is now pulled down. There were a lot of
parties. People have said she was selling her body but that is not what
happened. Unfortunately a lot of bus drivers just used her.''
The hapless Anna McFall, the daughter of a motor mechanic, Thomas
McFall, of Malcolm Street, Glasgow, and Jeannie McFall, a cleaner, was
pulled into West's fatal circle by her friendship with Rena Costello and
Isa.
John McLachlan says: ''They were very close pals, always together.
There was nothing to her. She was just a young kid going about with
older women. That stuff about her being West's nannie was just crap.''
Anna was born in Glasgow on April 8, 1949, and, after leaving school,
worked in a knitwear factory. She moved from Glasgow to Gloucester in
1966 with the other women, living on caravan sites at Brockworth and
Sandhurst. She was last seen by relatives in the summer of 1967, yet the
police were never informed of her disappearance.
Former neighbours of Rena Costello when she lived in Savoy Street in
Bridgeton, Glasgow, May and Archie Jackson remember her as a nice young
woman struggling to bring up two children. The time was the early 1960s
and the Jacksons lived opposite Rena on the ground floor of the tenement
at 25 Savoy Street.
Mr Jackson places the time as before the mid-sixties because he had
emigrated to Canada in 1965 to seek a new life.
''It was Rena we recognised from the pictures in the newspapers,'' he
told The Herald.
''I have never seen West in my life. It was Rena we recognised. She
stayed with an older woman with her children. She was only a young kid
then, only in her late teens, but she was exceptionally nice, a very
good neighbour and her children were always immaculate. We often
remarked on that.''
Asked about descriptions of Rena Costello as a wild, loose-living
woman which had appeared in some newspapers, Mr Jackson said: ''Honest
to God I would be telling a lie if I said anything like that. There was
never a hint of anything like that. You have to read between the lines
when you see what people are saying about her but we can say that these
kids clung to her all the time. They did that because she was fond to
them. She was a very good mother.''
Ms Jackson said: ''An older woman, I think it was her mother, used to
look after her children so that she could get out. She was full of life.
I remember her at a New Year's party doing a hula dance. In those days
she had dark hair but we recognised her from the press photographs
despite her hair being blonde in those.''
When the Jacksons moved to a new home in Reid Street, where they still
live, they lost touch with Rena Costello. They were never aware of what
happened to her. Savoy Street has since been demolished and replaced
with new housing.
It has emerged that Rena lived at 25 Savoy Steet with West and it was
there that her daughter, Anna Marie, was born in July, 1964. West's
occupation was given on that birth certificate as an ice-cream salesman.

FRED WEST'S first alleged victim was family friend Anna McFall, 18.
She was born in Glasgow on April 8, 1949, and worked for a while on
leaving school in a knitwear factory in the city. By 1966 she had moved
with friends to the Gloucester area, living at caravan sites at
Brockworth and Sandhurst. She was last seen in April, 1967, -- when
heavily pregnant.
Her remains -- the twelfth and last to be uncovered by the inquiry --
were discovered in the Fingerpost field at Kempley, on June 7 last year.
The remains of her unborn child were with her.
West's first wife Catherine is thought to have been his second alleged
victim. She was born in Coatbridge, on April 14, 1944. Tall with dark
hair, often dyed blonde, she met West while working as a waitress in the
New Inn, Ledbury, Gloucestershire.
They married at Ledbury register office on November 17, 1962, and
their daughter Charmaine was born four months later in Coatbridge. West
was working as a lorry driver and sometimes drove an ice-cream van.
Their second daughter, Anne Marie, was born in Glasgow in 1964.
Police diggers uncovered Catherine's remains on April 10, last year,
in the neighbouring Letterbox Field at Kempley. The search had lasted 13
days.
West's third alleged victim -- his daughter Charmaine -- is believed
to have died early in 1972 when she was just eight. Her remains were
uncovered when police searchers broke through a concrete kitchen floor
at the West's first Gloucester home at 25 Midland Road, on May 4, last
year.
The Midland Road property is only a few hundred yards from 25 Cromwell
Street on the opposite side of Gloucester's Central Park.
West was also accused of murdering nine young women and girls whose
remains were uncovered by police diggers in the rear garden and house at
25 Cromwell Street.
He was jointly charged with his wife Rosemary with these alleged
murders, between April, 1973 and June, 1987.
Their alleged victims were Lynda Carole Gough, 19, who was working as
a seamstress in the Co-op store at Barton Street, Gloucester, when she
disappeared in April, 1973.
Only two weeks before her twentieth birthday in May she had left her
parents' home to live in a Gloucester flat. Her remains were found below
the ground-floor bathroom.
Carole Ann Cooper, 15, who was born in Luton, Bedfordshire, had been
living at a children's home in Bilton Road, Worcester. She was last seen
on November 10, 1973, getting on to a local bus to the Warndon area of
Worcester after an evening out with friends. Her remains were recovered
from the basement.
Lucy Katherine Partington, 21, was a third-year English student at
Exeter University. She had been visiting friends at Pittville,
Cheltenham, and left around 10.10pm to catch a bus to her family home at
The Mill, Gretton, near Winchcombe.
But she did not catch the bus and was never seen again. Her remains
were also found in the West's basement.
Therese Siegenthaler, 21, was born in Trub, Switzerland, on November
17, 1952. She was living in a flat at Caterham Road, Lewisham,
south-east London, while studying sociology at the Woolwich College of
Further Education.
She apparently left for a weekend break in Ireland intending to travel
via North Wales. But she never reached her destination. Police recovered
her remains from the basement.
Shirley Hubbard, 15, had been working for a month at Debenhams store
in Worcester. On November 5, 1974, she left work at 5.30pm to travel
home to Ombersley Road, Droitwich, and disappeared. The Cromwell Street
basement also yielded her remains.
Juanita Mott, 18, was born in Gloucester and lived for a while in the
Coney Hill area of the city. On April 11, 1975 she left an address in
Newent to travel to Gloucester, a few miles away. Unemployed, she had
previously worked as a bottler with a firm in Easton Avenue, Gloucester.
The Cromwell Street basement also held her remains.
Shirley Ann Robinson, 18, was born in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.
She was a lodger at No 25, where her remains and those of her unborn
child were the third and last to be discovered in the narrow rear
garden. She was heavily pregnant when she died.
Alison Jane Chambers, 17, was born in Hanover, Germany, when her
father was in the Army. She settled with her mother in Swansea, South
Wales. In 1979 she moved to Gloucester to work under the Youth Training
Scheme with a firm of solicitors. In September, 1979, she was thought to
be living in Gloucester. Her remains were the second to be uncovered in
the garden.
The Wests's daughter Heather, their first child, was 16 when she was
last seen in Gloucester. She was born on October 17, 1970, and hers were
the first remains to be found by police in their garden search.

PEOPLE who knew Frederick West were shocked and amazed to learn he was
accused of a string of horrific murders. The scruffy, burly builder had
an easy-going, endearingly jokey manner and was seen as a likeable,
hard-working family man whose skills as a builder were always in demand.
Staff at a Wiltshire printing firm where West spent several days doing
building work described him as a ''totally ordinary guy'' whom anyone
would love to have as a next-door neighbour.
Cliff Dyer, 32, a salesman at the factory in Swindon, said: ''You
would have invited him into your home with open arms. He was so nice. We
were all amazed when we saw his face on the TV news. Everyone who knew
him liked him.''
A friend who babysat for Fred and his first wife, Catherine, when they
lived in a caravan near Cheltenham, said he was one of ''the most
hardworking people I have ever met''.
Michael Newman, 50, became friendly with the alleged mass-killer when
they were at a mobile-home park in Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, 26
years ago. The Wests had a three-berth caravan with a small garden
surrounded by a fence. ''I recall him as very hardworking,'' said Mr
Newman. ''We used to call him the man who couldn't stop working.''
But West had a record of criminal convictions. Over a 20-year period
he made 11 court appearances, mainly for petty theft, receiving stolen
goods, and motoring offences, and in 1970 spent a short time in prison.
Frederick West's early life was unremarkable. Born on September 29,
1941, he was the son of farm-worker Walter West and his wife Daisy, and
the eldest of six children.
His first home was the 100-year-old Bickerton Cottage in the village
of Much Marcle on the Gloucestershire-Herefordshire border -- then as
now a quiet rural backwater of farms, apple orchards, and fields of wild
daffodils.
Shortly after Frederick was born, the family moved to nearby Moor
Court Cottage, where he spent most of his childhood. The tousle-haired
teenager was fond of his 125cc motor cycle and regularly went to dances
at the Memorial Hall. He sold the bike when he was 18, after breaking
his leg in an accident that put him in hospital for several weeks.
West met Scottish waitress Catherine ''Rena'' Costello when she was
working in the New Inn at nearby Ledbury and he was employed as a lorry
driver. They married at Ledbury register office on November 17, 1962.
West was 21, and she was three years younger. Their first daughter was
born in March 1963 and their second daughter the following year.
The young family moved around the country as West sought work, finding
jobs as a lorry driver, general builder and ice-cream salesman.
His mother died in 1968 from a heart attack while in a Gloucester
hospital for a gallstone operation. She was just 44.
As his marriage began to break up, West returned from Scotland with
his daughters to stay in the mobile home, where he met Mr Newman. He
voluntarily placed the girls into local authority care -- apparently to
allow him time to sort out his marriage problems -- but took them back
after just a few weeks.
It was at this point, in 1970, that Catherine disappeared. She was
said to have run off with another man.
West began an affair with Rosemary Letts, then 16, who became pregnant
and in October 1970 gave birth to a daughter. In January 1972, West and
Rosemary -- who had two children from an earlier relationship -- were
married.
The following year the couple moved to 25 Cromwell Street.

Antwerp, Sunday
FIVE people died when fire engulfed a Belgian hotel where a New Year's
Eve party was in full swing. Officials feared today that others could
die from among more than 20 people critically ill with burns.
Fire broke out at the Switel hotel, near Antwerp's railway station,
one hour before 450 revellers were due to toast the start of 1995 and
left more than 100 people injured, many with severe burns to faces and
hands.
''I do fear that there will be a number of additional victims,''
Antwerp mayor Leona Detiege told a news conference.
Antwerp province governor Camille Paulus told the news conference
officials believed 141 people had been injured, although it was possible
some had been counted twice. Some 56 were in intensive care and between
20 and 25 were critical.
Prince Laurent, one of Belgian King Albert's three children, visited
victims at a Brussels hospital specialising in burns. The injured were
spread among 13 hospitals.
Surgeon Luc Beaucourt said it would be 72 hours before it was clear
whether all the victims of smoke inhalation would survive.
Surgeon Luc Beaucourt said the next 72 hours would be critical for
those seriously ill, many on life support systems. He said many injuries
were caused by smoke inhalation and complications like pneumonia could
come later.
Police said the blaze began when a Christmas tree was set on fire by
candles but city officials declined to speculate, saying the cause was
being investigated by the public prosecutor.
The fire apparently began at the hotel's entrance and spread to the
ballroom where the party was taking place.
''We were sitting at our table having a chat with my daughters and
parents when one of my daughters said, 'Mummy look, there's a fire',''
said guest Arlette Celis. ''In a few seconds there was smoke everywhere.
People had no time to react.''
She raced with her daughters to an emergency exit. She became
separated from her parents in the panic and they are now in hospital.
''My father is suffering after he inhaled smoke, mother from burns and
cuts from glass,'' said Mrs Celis. She and her two daughers were
unharmed.
Firefighters brought the blaze under control within 15 minutes,
governor Paulus said, but by then smoke and heat had done their damage.
Tonight, the acrid smell of burning still hung over the hotel's marble
and glass entrance hall.
In the blackened ballroom, whose windows were shattered, tables were
still laid for a New Year's Eve dinner that was never eaten.
ROME: An Italian father letting off gunshots to celebrate the new year
accidentally killed his eight-year-old daughter.
Giancarlo Rubino was charged with the involuntary homicide of his
daughter Anna and illegal possession of a weapon in their home town of
Cerignola.
Nine-year-old Concetta di Donna was also killed by random gunfire as
she watched fireworks from the balcony of her grandparents' house in
nearby Foggia.
''They were victims of an absurd, pagan rite,'' Italian state
television said of the killings, both within miles of each other in the
southern Puglia region.
Two other people were badly wounded by stray gunfire in the southern
Calabria region.
More than 160 people were injured around Naples, where big fireworks
displays are a long-standing tradition and illegal fireworks have become
a cottage industry.
At least 100 people, including a boy in Naplies who risked losing his
sight, were injured by fireworks around Rome.--Reuter.

Belgrade, Sunday
MILITARY negotiators began meeting at Sarajevo airport today in a bid
to consolidate a four-month truce signed by the warring parties at the
weekend.
After two weeks of hectic diplomacy, initiated by former US President
Jimmy Carter, the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs have agreed
to the ceasefire which is aimed at opening the way to a renewed round of
peace talks. The agreement was signed on what was reckoned to be the
1000th day since the beginning of the siege of the Bosnian capital.
General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian military commander, hailed the truce
by saying: ''The time has come for the guns to fall silent and for
diplomacy to speak up.''
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said: ''We will negotiate where we
can and make war where we have to. If the enemy does not show the
readiness for reasonable political solutions within the next few months,
the ceasefire will not be extended.''
Colonel Gary Coward, the UN spokesman in Sarajevo, said he was
optimistic that, unlike the scores of others that have gone before, this
ceasefire would hold: ''We do think they mean business.''
Yasushi Akashi, the UN's special envoy to former Yugoslavia, said he
believed that new talks aimed at securing a peace treaty would begin
within three weeks.
The weekend agreement foresees a separation of forces, the
inter-positioning of UN troops, freedom of movement for all UN
operations, and the withdrawal of all ''foreign troops''. This final
point refers to Krajina Serb soldiers from Serb-held Croatia who are
fighting in the Bihac area. The Bosnian Serbs also demand the withdrawal
of regular Croatian army forces from Bosnia.
The Bosnian Government said earlier that it would not sign the truce
agreement if rebel Muslim forces in the north-west continued their
offensive, but they too have now signed a ceasefire.
A road into Sarajevo is to re-open as the first real test of the
agreement. If it stays open, buses, cars, and commercial traffic will be
able to travel in and out of the city.
The Serbs currently hold 70% of Bosnia. Under the terms of the peace
plan drawn up by the Big Power contact group last summer, the republic
is to be divided giving the Bosnian Serbs 49% and the Muslims and Croats
51%. The Serbs were originally told that this was a
''take-it-or-leave-it'' plan and that if they rejected it they would be
punished. Instead they are now being told that all they need do now is
to start talking again.
The Bosnian Serbs, in a document signed after talks with Jimmy Carter,
agreed to use the contact group plan as a basis for negotiations. Today,
however, Jovan Zametica, senior adviser to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, said that the Serbs still rejected the principle of a 49%-51%
division and would never agree to Bosnia as a single state.
''Our sovereignty has to be recognised,'' he said. ''No constitutional
trick will keep us in Bosnia and no Muslim Bosnia will lord it over
us.''
While it seems likely that the truce will hold for a time, and that a
new round of peace talks may start, there can be no optimism that they
will lead to a final peace treaty.
As Mr Zametica made clear, the Bosnian Serbs have not changed their
position and neither has the Government in Sarajevo. Both sides can be
expected to use the coming months to consolidate their positions, and
the Bosnian army in particular to import more arms.
While they talk peace and troop disengagements in UN-chaired meetings
in the morning, the same military commanders will doubtless be using the
afternoon to plan for the spring campaign.

Copenhagen, Sunday
HUNDREDS of rioters smashed up a McDonald's restaurant, two banks, and
several shops in riots in the early hours of the New Year.
Rioters emptied the restaurant of furniture and threw it into a
bonfire on the street.
''I've been a fireman for 30 years and I've never seen such
vandalism,'' said Gerhard Nilson. ''Everything was smashed to pieces.''
Left-wing anarchists have targeted McDonald's in the past.
The mob of 400 smashed windows, computers, tables, and office
equipment in nearby banks and shops in the Norrebro working-class
district of central Copenhagen.
They also hurled cobblestones at riot-squad officers dispersing the
crowds with tear gas and 19 officers received minor injuries.
Charges of vandalism and violence against officers on duty were
pending against at least seven suspects.
The riots occurred in the same area where left-wing anarchists clashed
with police on May 18, 1993, in the capital's worst violence in decades.
In Germany, meanwhile, hundreds of young rioters threw paving stones
and fireworks in clashes with police in the northern city of Bremen and
the eastern town of Rathenow.
In Finsterwalde, also in eastern Germany, some 200 youths went on the
rampage.
In Bremen, anarchists who have rioted during previous New Year
celebrations and disrupted Unity Day festivities in October fought
police, smashing windows and barricading streets with cars and portable
toilet huts.
Six police were slightly injured and eight rioters were detained.
Right-wing rioters in the eastern town of Wernigerode injured three
policemen, one seriously, by attacking their car with baseball bats and
fireworks.
There was no trouble at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, symbol of the
city's former east-west division, where around 20,000 revellers gathered
to see in the New Year.--Reuter.

Warsaw, Sunday
AS CHAMPAGNE corks popped to herald the New Year, Poland ceased to be
a country of #26 millionaires.
The central bank slashed four zeros from the currency at midnight so
that today 10,000 old zlotys became one new zloty.
''When we wake up after our New Year's Eve frolics, we are going to
find that our bank accounts have shrunk 10,000 times,'' the newspaper
Zycie Warszawy told its readers, ''but we are not going to lose out on
this operation.''
The so-called ''denomination'' marks a new start after runaway
inflation followed the decline and collapse of the communist system in
the 1980s.
One US dollar will fetch only about 2.4 new zloties instead of 24,000,
and people who earned a modest monthly wage of five million zlotys
(#133) will now receive only 500.
The authorities have prepared people for the change with a television
campaign featuring a cartoon hamster in broker-style red braces called
''Denomi'', who reassures people that their new money will be worth
exactly the same to them as the old.
''Will it hurt?'' the hamster asks. ''Yes, but not as much as you
think.''
The central bank commissioned a 10-minute sequel to a popular Polish
gangster comedy film. The amiable villain tries to work out how to forge
the new money and finally gives up in despair because the notes are
fiendishly difficult to reproduce.
Despite these efforts, surveys show Poles worry that vendors will grab
the chance to round up prices, and they fear confusion because the old
notes will stay in use for two years alongside the new ones, requiring
feats of mental arithmetic.
Many older Poles still bitterly remember a redenomination introduced
by the communists in 1950, which was designed to deprive people of
undeclared savings. The central bank has been at pains to stress that
this move is quite different.
From now on, prices in shops and elsewhere must be displayed in both
old and new versions, on pain of a fine.
Poles, bruised by repeated economic upheavals and difficulties in the
past few years, showed little enthusiasm for the move.
President Lech Walesa, who has criticised the left-wing Government for
being too slow with reforms such as privatisation, took a downbeat tone
in his did not mention the currency change in his New Year's Eve
televised message.
''In my view the past year has unfortunately not brought any positive
changes in fundamental areas of national life,'' he said. ''We are
therefore entering the New Year without euphoria.''--Reuter.

Washington, Sunday
THE most disturbing feature of the shootings at abortion clinics is
that there is apparently no conspiracy.
Each of the four recent shootings, which have killed five people, was
carried out by a solitary, obsessed anti-abortion fanatic who was part
of the violent fringe of the ''pro-life'' movement but not accountable
to its leaders.
The four have been called terrorists, but there is no terror centre
that can be broken up and its leaders arrested, the way the Islamic
terrorists who attacked New York were caught.
Instead, there is a network of militants who advocate violence to stop
abortions in newsletters, in books and even on the Internet -- but they
knew nothing of Paul Hill, who killed two people in Pensacola, Florida,
last July, or the woman who shot and wounded a doctor in Kansas, or John
Salvi, who was arrested on Saturday after shooting up a clinic in
Virginia.
Salvi is the man suspected of killing two women and wounding five
other people in attacks on two abortion clinics in Massachusetts last
Friday. He dropped a duffle bag at the second clinic. It contained a
pistol, many rounds of ammunition, and a receipt from a gun shop.
He is a 22-year-old apprentice hairdresser from New Hampshire. Former
colleagues and employers describe him as solitary and weird, obsessed
with Roman Catholicism and the supposed evil of abortion.
Police reached his apartment on Friday night, but missed him. He
apparently drove south, to Norfolk on the coast of Virginia, where he
attacked another abortion clinic on Saturday.
Fortunately, no-one was hurt. He drove away after the shooting,
pursued by two police cars, and surrendered after throwing a gun out of
the car window.
The national director of Operation Rescue, the main militant
anti-abortion organisation, said: ''We're in a war. The only thing is
that, until recently, the casualties have only been on one side. There
are 30 million dead babies and only five people on the other side, so
it's really nothing to get excited about.''
Another fanatic told a Houston radio show: ''Blood will run in the
streets, like no one has ever seen,'' and a Roman Catholic priest, David
Trosch, who has been defrocked for advocating murder, predicts ''massive
killings of abortionists and their staffs''.
The archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Law, has cancelled pro-life
demonstrations and vigils planned for New Year. 'It is important to
state that violence is in total contradiction to all that the pro-life
movement represents,'' he said in a statement.
However it takes only a relatively small number of fanatics in this
vast country to produce death threats as a form of harassment, and to
tip a few paranoid solitaries over into murder.

MADRID: The Christmas Day ''miracle baby'' named Jesus was yesterday
being fed milk through a drip at a maternity hospital in Seville,
southern Spain.
However doctors say that the condition of Jesus Perejon remains
critical after he survived 90 minutes in a refrigerated drawer in the
hospital morgue.
His father, Feliano Perejon, said that his son, who weighed only 1lb
8oz at birth, was in the same condition as any baby born four months
prematurely.
The father's wish for a last look at the baby saved his life. He
detected a slight movement, took his son in his arms, and shouted for
help.
Hospital staff said after the birth that they could detect no life and
had told his mother, Maria, that Jesus was dead. The local health
authority has announced an investigation and Mr Perejon has made a
formal legal complaint.

Grozny, Sunday
RUSSIAN tanks pushed into the centre of the Chechen capital Grozny
today but rebel fighters kept up determined resistance in some of the
heaviest clashes of three weeks of fighting.
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said the Russian forces had taken
control of the centre of Grozny after launching a tank-led assault on
New Year's Eve, the climax of Kremlin efforts to smash tiny Chechnya's
bid for independence.
''The whole centre of the town and a number of districts in the town
and its outskirts are under the full control of federal forces,''
Grachev said.
The Russian Government's press centre said troops had also surrounded
rebel Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev's presidential palace, his main
headquarters. Dudayev himself was in a bunker elsewhere in Grozny, the
Interfax news agency reported.
However fighting was still raging in the heart of the city early today
evening and it was not clear if Moscow's forces had control of the
centre, even though I saw Russian tanks there.
Gachev praised the professionalism of foreign mercenaries who he said
were helping Chechnya, but claimed that the Russian forces had the upper
hand. He expected the last pockets of resistance to be wiped out in five
or six days.
Seizure of the city centre would be an important victory for Russian
troops sent by President Boris Yeltsin to Chechnya on December 11 to
disarm rebel fighters.
Yeltsin is braving fierce criticism in Moscow in his intent to rein in
the mainly Muslim region of about one million people in the North
Caucasus, and to force it to drop its 1991 declaration of independence.
This evening, however, fighting continued in the city centre.
One Chechen fighter standing only 300 yards from the central Freedom
Square said: ''There are Russian tanks in the square but they are
trapped. We can attack them if they move.''
Thick smoke hung in the streets and apartment blocks lay in ruins. The
pounding of guns and artillery fire rang continuously round the city,
whose peacetime population of 400,000 has been reduced by refugee
departures.
I saw at least five dead Russian soldiers. One charred corpse lay by a
burned-out tank and another lay beside an armoured vehicle. One tank
cornered by the defenders was firing wildly to keep from being captured.
Earlier today, journalits saw nine gutted Russian tanks and truckloads
of new volunteers pouring into the city to take up the fight against the
Russians.
The Russian Government press service said Dudayev's palace was
blockaded but shooting continued around it. It added that Russian troops
controlled residential areas and the railway station.
Yeltsin said in a New Year message yesterday that re-establishing
peace in the region was his top priority.
''The most important task for me next year is to restore peace and
normal life in the Chechen Republic, North Ossetia, and Ingushetia,''
said Yeltsin, referring to regions neighbouring Chechnya also affected
by the turmoil.
As the speech was broadcast on television, Russian troops were moving
into Grozny after tightening a noose around the city for three weeks.
The military campaign is criticised by liberal reformers and dissent
among some senior military officers. Hundreds of people have been killed
in Chechnya, many of them civilians.
Economics Minister Yevgeny Yasin said three trillion roubles (#566m)
would be required to rebuild the region's economy once the fighting
stops, RIA news agency reported.

MORE Britons are set to travel further for their holidays in 1995 and
not just to popular long-haul spots like Florida and the Caribbean.
Countries like South Africa, New Zealand and even Vietnam are expected
to host numerous UK visitors, according to travel experts.
''Long-haul is growing in popularity and now accounts for as much as
15% to 20% of all overseas travel by Britons,'' said Association of
British Travel Agents' spokesman Keith Betton.
''Australia and New Zealand are very much 'in' destinations at present
and South Africa is likely to get a lot of British visitors this year.
Vietnam, believe it or not, is popular with British birdwatchers.''
High street travel agents -- keenly competing for the post-Christmas
rush of bookings -- are reporting strong selling of Florida holidays and
trips to the United States generally.
Publicity surrounding violent incidents involving tourists in Florida
resulted in a drop in tourist numbers there, but improved security in
the sunshine state appears to have halted the decline.
Other, more offbeat, destinations that could prove popular in 1995
according to travel guide book publishers Odyssey Guides are:
* Iran -- full of mosques, museums and colourful bazaars -- but women
must cover up in public.
* Burma -- now known as Myanmar. Terrific temples.
* Yunnan Province in China -- petrified forest and mountains.
* Cuba -- good beaches, mountain forests and accommodation with
rapidly-improving facilities.
The change in holiday habits coincides with an increase in complaints
about package holidays in 1994.
The total number of complaints received by the association more than
11,600, an increase of 6%.
But ABTA said the rise was partly explained by the increased number of
people taking packages this year, up one million to 14 million.
Meanwhile, ABTA said a separate survey conducted by MORI showed that
90% of people who took a 1994 package holiday were satisfied compared
with 89% in a similar poll in 1992.
Of those who were dissatisfied, 7% were either not at all happy or not
very happy with their holiday, the same number as in 1992.

BRITISH Rail confirmed last night that the Edinburgh based Motorail
service will cease operations from the end of May.
The move prompted a fresh attack on the Government's plans for rail
privatisation from Labour's transport spokesman Henry McLeish.
The Motorail service, which carries about 20,000 cars a year will end
unless a private buyer can be found. It currently operates
''piggy-back'' on sleeper services, connecting London with a number of
destinations, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness.
A BR spokesman said that Roger Salmon, director of passenger rail
franchising, had made it clear that Motorail was not part of the minimum
standard and level of service in the run up to privatisation.
He added that Motorail received a substantial grant of public money
which could not be justified as the railway lines were sold off to
private bidders.
Mr McLeish last night condemned the Government's actions and said that
the next target would be special holiday rail services in Scotland.
He claimed that locomotive-hauled services for back packers, hill
walkers and other tourists would no longer operate in the summer months
because ScotRail was starved of cash.
The services mainly affected would be those between the central belt
and Perth, Inverness, Aberdeen and Fort William.
Mr McLeish said: ''ScotRail is now looking at a potential loss of 600
jobs. ScotRail is facing a devastating cash crisis which will not only
lead to services being reduced and job losses, but which will badly
undermine Scotland's tourist industry. It is time some sanity returned
to consideration of the future of the railways.''
Disclosure of the Motorail shutdown emerged as lawyers acting for the
rail union RMT are set to begin the legal process of seeking a judicial
review of the Government's proposals to sell off Railtrack.
Proceedings will begin soon, with the RMT arguing that Ministers are
acting outside their powers in privatising the rail infrastructure.
It is not clear how many jobs will be affected by the ending of the
Motorail service. No-one from Motorail could be reached for comment
yesterday.
Mr Ian Grant, chairman of the Scottish Tourist Board, described the
plan as ''bitterly disappointing''.
Although not clear about the exact impact the withdrawal of the
service would have on Scottish tourism, he said: ''It is obvious that a
lot of people from south of the Border use it for holidays or business.
Clearly, if it is being withdrawn, it would be very damaging.''
The Scottish National Party's transport spokesperson, Mr Keith Brown,
said: ''This is extremely bad news coming on the back of the recent
announcement that sleeper services from Fort William are to be axed.''
He said it would mean fewer options for travel between Scotland and
England and added: ''It will inevitably result in fewer tourists
visiting Scotland, and could also involve more road journeys which goes
against the Government's aims of taking traffic off the road.''

THE Primate of All Ireland admitted yesterday that the Roman Catholic
church had blundered in its handling of the scandal over paedophile
priests.
Cardinal Cahal Daly also expressed deep regret over the suffering of
child victims of the abuse.
''Unfortunately, we didn't always in the past treat this problem with
the urgency that was needed,'' he said.
''One has to have regrets because people have been so deeply hurt and
pained and wronged by people whose sacred office entitled them to
respect and trust.
''That trust has been cruelly abused. One grieves for the people who
suffered. I couldn't express too deeply my personal pain,'' said the
cardinal, in an interview with ITV's Sunday Matters programme.
''We deplore that suffering. We were humiliated and we are shamed by
that suffering.
''We apologise humbly and sincerely to the people who suffered,'' said
the cardinal.
There have been a string of child-abuse allegations involving priests
on both sides of the border in Ireland.
The case of one priest -- Father Brendan Smyth, who was jailed for
four years by Belfast Crown Court in June for abusing five girls over a
24-year period -- contributed to the collapse of Ireland's coalition
government.
Labour members of former Prime Minister Albert Reynolds's coalition
brought down the Government after he insisted on giving the job of
President of the Irish High Court to Harry Whelehan.
Mr Whelehan had been heavily criticised for his handling, while
attorney-general, of the extradition of Smyth to Northern Ireland.

A KEY figure in Richard Branson's Virgin empire has bought an island
off the west coast of Scotland.
Mr Robert Devereux, 39, is thought to have paid close to the #1.3m
asking price for Eilean Shona -- which lies between the Moidart and
Ardnamurchan peninsulars of Argyll.
He has overall responsibility for one half of the entire Virgin Group
and is married to Mr Branson's 35-year-old sister Vanessa.
The island and its restored Victorian mansion was put on the market
last year by Richard and Anna Stead, owners since 1982. They built up a
successful holiday letting business and oyster farm on the island.
The Devereuxs have three children -- Noah, seven, Florence, five, and
three-year-old Louis-Robert. The family is currently abroad on holiday.
Selling agents Knight Frank and Rutley said the Devereuxs have bought
the island for ''their own private use,'' but intend to run it in much
the same way as the Steads have done. The island businesses, which
include seven holiday cottages, bring in around #60,000 a year.
For his money Devereux will also get a joiner's shop, deer larder,
boathouse and steading with a plantation of pine and a small herd of red
deer.
The Devereuxs have indicated they may take on as many six staff. At
present two part-timers help out the Steads, the only permanent
residents. In 1871 there were 120 islanders.

THE laird of a Hebridean island yesterday hit back at tenants who said
they were offended by his Christmas cards.
Mr Keith Schellenberg, who has been at the centre of an eviction row
with tenants on Eigg, said the spoof cards were meant as a joke.
The cards show Mr Schellenberg flanked by two Santas in dark glasses
-- each carrying a croquet mallet.
The cards are postmarked Isle of Eigg Bailiffs PLC, whose motto is
given as ''we face harassment with harassment''. Part of the message
pledges to sort out awkward tenants.
However, islander Colin Carr, who was due to be evicted from his
island home yesterday with his wife and five children, failed to see the
funny side.
''He has no idea of the worry and frustration he is causing. He thinks
it is a big joke. We are fighting for our home and livelihood,'' said Mr
Carr.
A trust was established in 1990 in an attempt to buy the island from
Mr Schellenberg.
Mr Schellenberg said yesterday: ''Surely life has not come to such a
pass in Scotland that my Christmas cards have to be vetted by the Isle
of Eigg Trust or other politically correct organisations?
''Now I shall make a point of sending the cards out to the trust
members. I hope they become collectors' items.''
He joked: ''We have got a landing force of fit, strong mercenaries
standing by.''

POLICE and building control officers were last night still
investigating the cause of of a wall collapse which killed a 12-year-old
boy in Edinburgh.
The boy has been named as Russell Moffatt, from the Buckstone area of
the city. He had been out playing with a friend on Hogmanay afternoon in
a lane off Bread Street when the brick wall fell on top of him, killing
him instantly.
Building control officers sealed off the area around the collapse.
A spokesman said there was still no clue as to why it had happened but
further investigations would be carried out.
A police spokesman said they were treating the incident as a tragic

THE history of hairstyles is rarely regarded as part of the political
curriculum, but it was a favourite subject of Milton Pitts. Until the
Clinton era, he was barber to four American Presidents, and his
importance to the White House was shown by the length of his obituaries.
It was he who persuaded Gerald Ford to accept the use of a hair spray,
and be blow-dried. It was he who knew the secret of Ronald Reagan's
permanently black hair, which he loyally maintained was natural.
Mr Pitts could have given invaluable advice to John Major, who has
ordered that even the most unlikely measures be considered to transform
his public image. A suggestion of one brain-storming session was that he
should grow a beard. Chief among the objections was not only that of Mrs
Major, but that it would involve a two-week period of unsightly stubble.
Nevertheless, the suggested style of a submarine captain was said to be
most effective, especially when the Premier's spectacles were replaced
by contact lenses.
Mr Pitts claimed that it took a full generation for new hair fashions
to be accepted, although powerful leaders can change them overnight.
Peter the Great taxed Russian beards, and shaved off his own. Alexander
did the same with his Macedonian troops, decreeing that they shave off
handles that could be grabbed by an enemy. At the time of the Crusaders,
however, the little son of Saladin is said to have wept with terror when
he saw their clean-shaven envoys.
The beard went out of fashion before the Norman Conquest, when
Frenchmen ''shaved like actors'', but had returned by the thirteenth
century. After another clean-shaven period, Henry VIII brought beards
back, and they prospered among foppish Elizabethans, who curled them
with irons. In modern times Edward VII and George V sported royal
beards, although in politics, President Castro apart, they are currently
unpopular. Whether John Major could have changed the trend we will now
never know. A beard might not improve his image, but it could hardly
make it very much worse.

THE nation, I suppose, is still busy urging its children to write
their thank-you letters on this second day of the new year. ''But Ma,
why can't I write just one letter to Santa for all my presents?''
Children's logic confounds parents keen to keep the myth alive.
The Prime Minister must feel that logic is similarly defied by the low
esteem in which he is regarded. Should not every one of us be writing
off to Mr Major right now to thank him for his achievements over the
past 12 months or so? We have low inflation, falling unemployment, the
best, consistent growth figures in Europe based on exports. Debt is
reducing and the balance of payments coming into line. The killing has
stopped in Ireland.
Every post-Second World War Prime Minister has striven to achieve such
a situation, free of the threat of bust following periods of boom. Mr
Major appears to have brought it about. Furthermore, there is evidence
that the traditional cross-party scepticism about a centralised European
federation is increasingly matched across the Channel in Germany and
France.
These are significant facts which might have been expected to nurture
a national sense of wellbeing and expectation of better things to come.
But these presents have been taken with a shrug and put aside with the
wrapping they came in. Thanks, but no thanks.
Mr Major's reward has been unprecedented humiliation in every
opinion-voicing election last year. Recent polls record an abysmal 22%
UK support and 77% dissatisfied. One day he is cast as a wimp, the next
as petulantly arrogant, out of touch with his party and the public.
Strong leadership is demanded of him, but when he tries to assert his
authority over his parliamentary party (eight MPs off the whip) he is
derided as having miscalculated himself into a Commons minority.
Meanwhile the Tory dissidents, nostrils flaring, continue on the
rampage. The poor soul cannot win.
Economic recovery has been drowned in sleaze and internal strife
throughout 1994. No Tory doubts that if it continues like this, the
party is doomed to relinquish power in such a way that could take it
several parliaments to regain it. Well before the halfway mark of this
administration Mr Major was already into damage limitation.
If Tory MPs appear to have lost faith in their leader, why should the
electorate think otherwise? Economic recovery has been painful in the
wake of a recession that hit the Tory middle classes hard. Their
mortgaged homes have been turned into negative-equity prisons. Their
professional jobs have been shown to be no more secure than a steel
worker's or a miner's.
Gone, possibly for ever, is security of tenure in middle management
right across the board in banks and stockbroking, the biggest of our
firms and the smallest. Mr Major and 15 years of Tory rule are seen as
responsible for this second industrial revolution. The fact that Mr
Blair cannot promise that this kind of job security will return, any
more than Mr Major can, seems beside the point.
The late Mr John Smith, and now his successor, Mr Tony Blair, have
established a credible alternative based not so much on economic theory
as a fairer way of going about galvanising the country and exploiting
the proceeds. If Labour can cling to this, it has every chance of
winning next time handsomely.
The core of Mr Blair's success and the disaffection with this
Government is that it was the Tories and not Labour that were caught
with the exchange rate mechanism. Remember that? Sterling was bound to
the German Mark in a basket of EU currencies at the wrong level and at
the wrong time.
It was a fashionable idea as the complete answer to inflation,
embraced by John Smith's Labour Party, the City and Trade Unions, and
the majority of the Tory Party. Even Mrs Margaret Thatcher (who had lost
Chancellor Lawson and Foreign Secretary Howe over the issue) had to go
along with it at the behest of her new Chancellor, John Major. It was a
desperate mistake which the markets exposed, almost from the start.
Recession was deepened defending it and was prolonged by the cost of
abandoning it on Black Wednesday when interest rates were going through
the roof. Mr Major did not at once fire his Chancellor, Mr Norman
Lamont. How could he? It was his own policy. Mr Major has not apologised
for his catastrophic mistake. He has not recanted and stated ''never
again''.
This is one of the reasons that his critics on the Tory benches still
look at him with profound scepticism. Worse than this for him, it is one
reason why the electorate will not now thank him for getting us out of
an economic mess that he got us into. Meanwhile billions have been added
to the nation's tax burden, including 8% VAT on domestic heating and
Hogmanay's new imposts on smokers, drinkers, and drivers.
It turns out that the much-trumpeted anti-inflation policy -- the
brightest feather in Mr Major's economic cap -- was dictated by the
markets and the Bank of England. As taxes rose and job security fell it
seemed that only Ministers had to be hounded out of office when exposed
by the media in a variety of peccadillos.
The Prime Minister's worthy citizens' charters and Back to Basics
campaign were sunk in derision as a result of the sleaze factor in his
own ranks. Even this might have been surmounted if only there had been a
clear and compelling advocacy about what was happening and why to a
nation in hard times.
He is puzzled as to why his negotiating gains on Britian's post-ERM
future in Europe have not been accorded a triumph. The answer is that
the public and his own party believe that he achieved only a brief
respite in holding on to sovereignty that was already theirs. It seems
that until he denounces the ERM strategy personally, he cannot stand on
firm ground, even in his own party.
The nation has accepted soundly-based economic recovery much as a
pimpled youth embraces an aunt for the seasonal gift of an untrendy tie.
It may be the same with tax cuts when they come. We write to Santa to
ask for things, not to thank him. Mr Major had better get used to this
harsh reality.

TORIES must hope that the new year goes on as the old one ended, with
Labour in open confusion about its education policy. It is not a topic
which will go away quickly and it is clearly a sensitive one both for
the party and the public, for it is a multifaceted subject where the
''old'' and the ''new'' Labour parties profoundly disagree and where no
coherent and consistent common policy has been established even after
nearly 16 years in Opposition. Were Labour actually in government, it
would be subject on this issue to the same sort of withering attack
which has been successfully focused on the Major administration's
tendency to assert propositions boldly only to retreat under pressure.
Labour's own ability to participate in these attacks (and even to
orchestrate them) might have been expected to have ensured that its own
policy positions were fully considered and accepted, if not by the rank
and file, at least by the NCOs and junior officers. The tax status of
independent schools and their future role in society has apparently not
been considered systematically at all; and even quite senior officers
have just been wrong-footed as a result. They have also been disowned by
their commanders who have had to make -- or is it re-make? -- policy on
the march.
A similar element of confusion was apparent when Mr Blair ignored the
party line on opted-out schools when he chose one for the education of
one of his children. He had every right to do so, but it caused
consternation in his own party. His defence of his choice indicated a
lack of confidence in the policy he was effectively jettisoning. It will
be harder for Labour in the months ahead to argue against opting out of
local education-authority control as a strategy for some state schools.
What it should argue about private education is not quite clear now.
There is bound to be some internal bickering, though it will probably be
contained given the way Messrs Blair and Brown have so far managed to
impose their authority. If that is that, any comparison with Mr Major's
tactics may still be to Labour's advantage since it is his inability
quickly to impose his authority which has so damaged his leadership.
The issue of private education will not go away. Labour is not
entirely reconciled to it, though increasing numbers of parents are
attracted to it because of the deficiencies (real or imagined) of the
state system. The best answer is to make state educational provision
better, but no matter how that is accomplished the private sector will
not wither away. It could always be relocated if attacked. Any
government which sought to squeeze private education out of Britain by
the imposition of penal policies designed for no other purpose might
find much of it transferred to Ireland -- additional travel costs would
be offset by cheaper running costs. But long before such matters
developed there would be the question of the electoral costs, and the
Blair-Brown axis of Labour's leadership has decided already that these
would be too high. They should have told Mr Blunkett earlier.

BEGINNING a new year means little if anything in terms of continuity
of international affairs. These roll on regardless of calendars,
anniversaries, and most individual events, and no special significance
need be attached to the advent of another year. But new years do evoke
reassessments of old problems, and one which is on many minds is Western
relations with Islam. The long-established tension between the two
cultures and religious systems (in spite of their common origin in
Judaism) has been given a contemporary edge by the emergence of renewed
Islamic militancy which worries many observers because it seems to be
inspired by a hatred of the West, and its secularism in particular. This
phenomenon seems to coexist with a period of Western self-doubt,
certainly self-questioning, about the coherence of the nation state
(still the main Western political structure) and the coherence of the
internal social assumptions which sustain it. Many Western societies are
under severe pressures (often material, but also concerning their sense
of wider social purpose, as exposed by the drug culture), and many
beliefs about the integrity and virtue of our civilisation were hard hit
by the Second World War and its exposure of such evils as the Holocaust
and the moral ambiguities inherent in the use of nuclear power.
The conjunction is accidental, but it may have found Western opinion
less confident than it might have been to face a renascent Islam. But
things are far more complex than the suggestion of any straightforward
confrontation. Among the observers most perplexed by the rise of Islamic
fundamentalism, at least as preached and exported by Iran, are many
Muslims, especially, but not only, those in the most stable Muslim
states. There is no Islamic political unity any more than there is a
Western one; even the supposed religious unity of Islam is as subject to
plurality as Christianity. The tensions between the two systems of
thought need not spill over -- historically there has been as much
creative exchange as there has been conflict. That as well as
contemporary areas of common interest, such as peace and economic
development in the Middle East, should never be forgotten. The first
enemies of extremism are always those moderates who are closest to its
assumptions but who do not share its conclusions. Nothing would be worse
for the West than to lump Islam into a mould designed by its militant
minority.
That does not mean that any Western state should give way to the
intolerant brand of Islam made and sold from Iran, acquiesce in
terrorism, or hesitate in helping friends like President Mubarak who
seek to improve their own societies and who interpret their religious
beliefs in ways which immoderates condemn. Nor should Western states
with Muslim minorities -- France especially, but ourselves and Germany
also -- feel these to be threatening. Part of the plurality of liberal
states is their tolerance. Muslims have not always shown that virtue
themselves, but then Western liberalism has been far rarer in the past
than we might like to think now. The best posture is one of common
confidence and intimacy where it can be shared; and a robust opposition
to coercion wherever it is deployed.

SOUTH Africa hope to emulate the 1888 England side led by the great W
G Grace when they take on New Zealand in the third Test in Cape Town,
which starts today.
Only once before in the game's history has a team won a three-Test
series after losing the opener. South African skipper Hansie Cronje
might not quite measure up to W G, who inspired an England fightback
against Australia more than a century ago, but having seen his side
subside meekly to New Zealand by 137 runs in Johannesburg in November,
Cronje led a spirited fightback in Durban last week to score an
eight-wicket triumph.
Despite the defeat, New Zealand are likely to stick with the team on
duty in Durban.
''As far as personnel is concerned, I don't think we can look to make
changes,'' explained captain Ken Rutherford. ''The 11 that we used in
Durban are pretty much the best 11 that we have on tour.''
South Africa have dropped opener Andrew Hudson after a horror sequence
of just 56 runs in his last eight Test innings. He has been replaced by
Rudolf Steyn, of Orange Free State.
Western Province captain Eric Simons has been brought into the squad
as cover for seamer Craig Matthews, who injured rib and stomach muscles
during the second Test.
With a recent reputation for flat and slow pitches, the Newlands
ground will be approached with caution, despite both captains'
assurances that they will not be satisfied with a shared series.
''It sounds like it's set up for a result, which is great,'' said New
Zealand captain Ken Rutherford. ''I think the public is sick and tired
of watching boring Tests on flat tracks.''

TRACEY Robb, the Western Klick Photopoint and Scotland women's hockey
goalkeeper, has been given a perfect start to the new year by being put
on standby for Great Britain's trip to San Diego later this month for a
five-match Test series with the USA.
It would be only poetic justice if Robb was given the nod for the
Californian venture as she was arguably the best of the four goalkeepers
on view at Great Britain's recent training/ selection weekend.
The team management, however, decided to go with the England pair, Jo
Thompson and Hilery Rose.
Robb now comes into line for selection following an injury sustained
by Rose who is presently studying in the USA. She subsequently hasn't
been able to attend training sessions and, with the squad's departure to
San Diego only 18 days away, the Great Britain authorities will have to
make a decision on Rose's fitness soon.
The deadline could well be this week at Cardiff when the entire squad,
plus the reserves, have a five-day workout starting on Wednesday when
they will have games against a Welsh squad and the Whitchurch men's
club.
Should Robb get the call-up, it will make for a historic occasion in
Scottish hockey, for this would bring the total to a record seven Scots
in the squad with the Olympic qualifying tournament in Cape Town just 10
days away.

CRAIG McDermott dragged himself out of his sick bed -- and put England
straight back on the critical list.
Mighty Mac's amazing day began with a double-wicket blast which sent
Graeme Hick and Graham Thorpe packing before the third Test in Sydney
was an hour old.
But his real heroics came after a stomach virus had threatened to keep
him in the dressing-room -- and allow Lancashire pals Mike Atherton and
John Crawley to complete a promising recovery.
McDermott looked washed out in mid-afternoon as he sunk down on one
knee during his fifteenth over and then tottered down to long leg.
A few minutes later, he walked slowly to the pavilion with England
hoping they had seen the last of him for the day. But a cold shower and
lots of liquid put McDermott back on his feet to inflict another dose of
damage with the second new ball.
Atherton's valiant innings of 88 was ended by a rapid delivery which
jagged back to find a gap between bat and pad and then Mike Gatting
edged a perfect outswinger as Australia's leading fast bowler joined
leg-spinner Shane Warne on 20 wickets for the series.
By end of play, McDermott looked on top of the world again while poor
old England -- already 2-0 behind in the series -- were decidedly groggy
at 198 for seven.
Graham Gooch has said he will retire from international cricket at the
end of this tour unless his form improves -- and it never will if Damien
Fleming keeps producing deliveries like the sixth-ball pearler that
pitched middle and swung away late.
Gooch, who has now managed just one half-century in 15 Test innings,
had to play at it but succeeded only in edging a catch to keeper Ian
Healy.
When McDermott angled a ball through Hick's defence before trapping
Thorpe lbw with a swinging full toss, England were reeling again at 20
for three.
Atherton, though, is nothing if not a fighter, and yesterday he found
a willing ally in 23-year-old Crawley, who was finally making his first
Test appearance of the series because of Alec Stewart's broken finger.
McDermott said: ''Atherton showed a bit of guts and so did Crawley.
But it's up to all six batters to do that, like all seven of ours do.
That's their job.''
Together they added 174 for the fourth wicket, and Atherton was just
12 runs short of his first century of the tour and a mere 33 minutes
away from batting through the day when disaster struck.
As has happened all too often, one wicket was the signal for an
almighty collapse. Gatting followed four deliveries later without
scoring, then Fleming dashed Crawley's hundred hopes.
The Lancashire youngster made just one mistake during his high-class
innings of 72 -- and the resulting edge flew straight to Mark Waugh at
second slip.
Even then there was time for Steve Rhodes to be run out following an
awful mix-up with Angus Fraser as Australia finished where they had
started . . . firmly on top. Scoreboard:

SCOTLAND'S Lisa McKenna, 17 yesterday, failed in her bid to make it a
double celebration when her fine run came to an end in the final of the

Edinburgh Sports Club's Richard Snowden also had to settle for second
best against Spanish opposition when he lost 9-0, 9-0, 9-1 to Alberto
Manso in the under-14 final.
In the boys' under-19s, Kenneth Low (Malaysia), the No.2 seed, caused
an upset with a 9-10, 9-3, 9-6, 9-1 win over favourite Mika Monto.
The only Scottish winner was Chris Hillyard (ESC), who won a the
under-12 final 1-9, 4-9, 9-7, 10-9, 9-6 against Bridge of Allan's Peter

FIFE Flyers will look back on a cruel twist of fate which has almost
certainly killed their ice-hockey title hopes for another season. The
Christmas Eve injury to Ryan Kummu, who received a puck in the jaw which
required surgery, has left them brittle in defence, and successive
defeats by arch-rivals Edinburgh Racers have cost them four valuable
points.
Hogmanay's 10-8 home defeat by Racers, following a 9-2 thumping in the
capital last Tuesday, was a sobering experience for coach Jim Lynch and
the frustrated fans at Rosslyn Street.
Revenge looked on the cards when Flyers skated to a 4-2 first-period
advantage after the first period but a five-goal second-period blitz
from the visitors turned the game and piled on the agony.
North American marksman Chris Palmer started the rot three minutes
into the second period to fire Racers. Slovakian Ivan Matulik then
popped in a five-minute treble before ex-Flyer Dean Edmiston pierced the
leaky defence for a fifth time after 31 minutes.
Craig Wilson grabbed a goal to make it 7-5 at the end of the second,
but it was too little too late as Racers were well into their stride by
then and cruised to a comfortable victory.
Matulik finished with a creditable four goals and two assists, with
Palmer collecting a hat trick and three assists.
Defenceman Mike Ware hit two but captain Tony Hand played a major part
in the victory by setting up seven goals.
His older brother Paul made a comeback after having been out since
October through suspension and knee surgery and helped shore up Racers'
rearguard.
Mark Morrison was outstanding for Flyers with a treble, but American
marksman Tony Szabo again disappointed.
Paisley Pirates, who face Blackburn Hawks in a crucial home league
game tonight, posted their eleventh victory on the trot, and their third
in a week over Dumfries Vikings, with a 10-7 success at The Lagoon on
Saturday.
American Doug Smith hit four for the visitors while Danuse Bauba fired
a hat trick for Pirates.
Two players were ejected, John O'Hara for Vikings and Pirates' former
Dumfries defenceman Mike Wowbray after a flare-up four minutes from time
in a penalty-filled encounter. Results:
Premier division -- Cardiff 17, Bracknell 5; Fife 8, Edinburgh 10;
Nottingham 14, Milton Keynes 5. Division 1 -- Chelmsford 11, Blackburn
8; Paisley 10, Dumfries 7; Slough 11, Lee Valley 2; Swindon 11, Solihull
14.

THE Professional Footballers' Association are to sue the magazine
Business Age and Sunday newspapers which revealed details of their
accounts.
The PFA's chief executive, Gordon Taylor, said yesterday: ''We have
called in our legal team as there are gross inaccuracies in the figures
quoted.''
The magazine, published on Friday, highlighted Taylor's earnings,
stating that his salary in 1992 had jumped from #82,875 to more than
#200,000.
The story also appeared in yesterday's papers with the Sunday Mirror
printing Taylor's tax details and claiming the PFA seemed to be spending
more on itself that its members. The newspaper stated Taylor would be
embarrassed at his salary details being made public.
But Taylor retorted: ''I would not be embarrassed in any way. The PFA
have nothing to hide and neither have I.
''I did not go and ask for a rise. It was the management committee's
decision and it was a unanimous one by all eight members.
''They wanted to bring my salary and benefits in line with other chief
executives, like the chief executive of the FA. I was astonished to see
my tax details covering most of a page of a newspaper.
''We decided to sue as soon as the magazine appeared as the figures
quoted are totally inaccurate.
''The PFA works hard for its members and spent more than #2m last year
on benefits.''

IAN Durrant's contract at Ibrox expires at the end of the season and
there is no guarantee he will be given the chance to stay on. Yet if
Rangers decide he should continue his career elsewhere -- and it would
be their decision not his -- it would be a great pity.
The 28-year-old has been at Ibrox since he was a teenager and would
prefer nothing better than to end his playing days there, but Rangers
might not be so anxious to extend the relationship. Indeed, they may
believe they have done enough for the player already and that no-one
could accuse them of being disloyal should they now be of a mind to
sever ties.
Walter Smith is trying to reshape his side and blend a collection of
talents capable of winning at home and also of competing in the
Champions' League. As manager, that is precisely what he should be
doing, and inevitably some difficult decisions will have to be made.
Egos will be deflated. There will be casualties.
Interestingly, however, the one time Rangers performed impressively in
the Champions' League, in season 1992-93, when they went through their
qualifying games and group matches unbeaten and almost made it to the
final against AC Milan, Durrant was one of the heroes. In fact, during
that run alone he paid back any kindness shown to him by his emplpoyers.
The midfield player scored three Champions' League goals and it was
his astute use of the ball and ability to make telling runs which helped
make Rangers such a force throughout that campaign, one of the most
exciting recent times in Scottish football. So far as I can see, nothing
much has changed with Durrant, yet he is unable to command a regular
first-team place with Rangers.
Smith uses the running and tackling power of Stuart McCall, whose
tenacity often disguises the fact that he, too, is a decent distributor
of the ball, and with the emergence of Craig Moore and Charlie Miller,
both of whom are versatile and play midfield as one of their positions,
Durrant must be standing on the sidelines wondering two things. First,
he must be asking himself if it would not be better to leave, and
secondly he may be considering if either Moore or Miller will ever have
his touch and vision.
However, the threat to Durrant is not so much from younger stock as
from players like McCall and Ian Ferguson, who is fit again. Trevor
Steven and Alexei Mikhailichenko are recovering from long-term injuries
and then there is Brian Laudrup, a player to whom even Durrant would
bend a knee.
Gordon Durie has also been used in wide midfield, all of which tends
to suggest Durrant is being pushed further out of the manager's grand
scheme. Durrant could be looking at a term in reserve-team football and
that really would be a dreadful waste of what is still a rare talent.
The truth is Durrant is much too good to play in anyone's second team,
and if he has not already told his manager so, then it is about time he
did.
It is not this column's place to champion anarchy within Ibrox, or any
other club for that matter, but there has to be something seriously
wrong with all of us -- at the very least too many seasons of
bludgeoning premier division football must have warped our values -- if
a player like Durrant is left to kick his heels in the little leagues.
Are we really so well off for talented footballers that someone like
him can be passed over? Of course we aren't.
Smith obviously feels he has enough in midfield and would have
accepted a realistic offer from Everton had the English premiership side
been willing to extend Durrant's recent loan period at Goodison Park to
a more permanent signing. It is indeed a desperate stage we have reached
if most of the above players are considered to be in possession of
greater touch and wider appreciation of what goes on during 90 minutes
than Durrant, even if he did suffer horribly because of injury. Yes, I
know that to keep harping on about the tackle which almost completely
destroyed one of his knees is tedious, but had that not happened,
Durrant would probably have been the most influential player in
Scotland's midfield by now, never mind a club side.
He never did quite recover his electrifying burst of pace which often
propelled him through opposing lines of defence and into scoring
positions. He was one of the few players in the Scottish game who could
do that and even though he was brought more into line with everyone else
after his knee had been rebuilt, he still found he could pass with
greater accuracy and see openings quicker than the others.
Those qualities alone make him someone to be cherished, a player to be
protected. He is certainly not someone who should be discarded.

HERE is me today in Ireland, but on Saturday afternoon, I was in what
is oft thought of as nearly part of it, Coatbridge.
This is a wee town in Lanarkshire, but next door to a big yin,
Airdrie. Now you have to understand the difference as well as the
distance, because there is a problem about the two places.
I have a brother who is a supremo in Airdrie Academy. I know -- an
academy in Airdrie sounds like a wee condradiction until you realise
that almost every Scot worth a damn came from this county, from Sir
Harry Lauder to Doug Baillie.
You have to be quite old to know that reference. You have to be very
old indeed to remember the last time Coatbridge could boast their team,
Albion Rovers, as a main force in Scottish football; could boast at all,
in fact.
Without a shadow of a doubt, Albion Rovers are the worst senior
football team in Britain. They have won two games this season, and are
the despair of what fans they possess, the players and directors and,
indeed sponsors -- Dalziel's the Airdrie bakers put a few bob into this
little club and supply, I may say, the best pies in Scottish football.
At half time at Cliftonhill, I have an opportunity to sample the pies,
and grand they are. Directors David Forrester, a chartered accountant,
Jack McGoogan, a solicitor, David Lyttle, a graduate of the Yooni of
Life, took me round the round pf pies and a wee history of this club.
The reds and yellows have an illustrious background indeed. Like many
another football team which has found itself on the sidelines because of
the Celtic-Rangers hegemony, Albion are a very small club.
I counted a bit less than 200 people at Cliftonhill. I was told by the
two polis there -- both Albion fans incidentally -- that there actually
were 200 spectators ''if ye count the stewards and the polis,'' said
constables Haugh and McLuckie.
They were baith McLuckie if ye ask me. Cauld as it was they could
stand and watch the game itself rather than the crowd, eventually
officiall listed as 345 souls.
What they saw were the Coatbridge boys lose 1-0 to Ross County. A
muddled goal by 24-year-old lorry driver Bobby Williamson saw victory
for the teuchter team. I only wrote that bit because it sounded like
sports-writing.
Albion Rovers do lose with class. Going down to Ross County is a bit
grim, all the same, considering that this is the first year that the
Highland team has been in the major, if minor, Scottish third division.
I spoke to Ross County director Ally Mackintosh, a newsagent from
Inverness, after the game, and he told me of the difficulty of small
teams, particularly any from the North and how hard it was to keep
players of ability, and worse; the expense of coming down South to the
Central belt.
Of course, the same is dreadfully true of Albion Rovers. They have
their stars -- Joe McBride is one of them, a boy I last saw playing for
Everton along with Asa Hartford and Gary Stanley and other major
players, and him the son of Joe Sr, one of the greatest Celts of all
time.
Junior is 35, and good as he is, Albion Rovers are bad as they are
because they cannot develop the new players.
They could be a lot richer, though. Albion has a reasonable location.
What they need us more than the local baker's sponsorship. What they
would like above all is Airdrie coming there. No chance, though.
Airdrie is the bigger club as it is the bigger town and the rivalry is
not merely intense; it is daft. It would make more than sense if Airdrie
took itself to sharing a ground and stadium with them -- OK, Albion
Rovers wee ground needs a lot of attention for the stand is unsafe, and
the walls on the other side of where I stood are so bad that the ground
itself is incapable of accepting more than 600 spectators.
Airdrie now play at Cumbernauld, sharing Broadwood Park with Clyde. It
is not a suitable location. Airdrie's notion of a new home at Glenmavis
is probably as fanciful as Celtic's idea of a move from Hampden, and
just as expensive.
I spoke to nearby publican Kevin O'Brien, of Big Owen's Bar just up
the road from Albion Rovers' ground. ''We get the Rangers and Celtic
reserve teams here, and a lot of the fans and, nae danger, I'd love the
extra business from senior teams at the top level.
''But anyway, I think Airdrie should make sense out of where we are
and share a ground.''
There is a problem here, it is true. Quite rightly, Coatbridge holds
on to its identity: a bit like Rutherglen against Glasgow, really. But
this is parochial. So am I. And me today across in Donegal.
Tomorrow I'm goung out to watch real football. Gaelic they call it.
And me away from Albion at that.

IF, AT the end of the season, Partick Thistle find themselves two
points short of the premier division safety mark, they will, no doubt,
look back on the last day of the old year and say to themselves that's
where they blew it. But even the most fervent Firhill fan will admit
they were lucky to escape with a point in the 2-2 draw with Kilmarnock.
Thistle, however, will seldom, if ever, be given such a dream start to
a match -- two appalling Kilmarnock blunders within the first six
minutes had them a couple of goals ahead, but instead of pressing on
when Ayrshire confidence was at its lowest, they sat back and it was all
downhill from there.
The Killie culprits were former international midfield man Bobby
Connor, who was away off the mark with a pass-back in the first minute,
and big Yugoslav goalkeeper Dragoje Lekovic, who, five minutes later,
failed to control the ball with his feet just outside the penalty area.
Both times, the lightning pace of Thistle's Rod McDonald produced the
goals.
Said Lekovic: ''When I walked into the dressing room at half-time, I
just didn't know where to look. That blunder was the biggest mistake of
my career. The ball bobbed up, and when it went past me I closed my eyes
-- I couldn't bear to watch.''
By half-time, Steve Maskrey had given Kilmarnock a lifeline with a
header, and even at that point, things looked ominous for Thistle. A
22-yard strike from full back Gus MacPherson after 63 minutes levelled
the match and Kilmarnock, being driven on by some excellent midfield
work, can consider themselves unfortunate not to take all three points.
Said Rugby Park manager Alex Totten: ''We showed a lot of character
after that shocking start, when we laid two goals on a plate for
Thistle. My players could have felt sorry for themselves, but they
didn't.
''At half-time, Connor and Lekovic held up their hands and apologised,
then went on to play really well. We battled and played a lot of good
football and finished up the better side. We never gave up -- that's the
type of lads we have at Kilmarnock.''
Thistle's afternoon of frustration culminated in the final minute of
the match when Roddy Grant, who had come on as substitute for the
injured McDonald, was sent off for the second time this season after a
collision with Lekovic, who had to receive treatment.
Grant looked stunned when referee Smith produced a red card, and I
have a deal of sympathy with the Thistle man. The keeper did get to the
ball first, but Grant's action looked to be a genuine attempt to get a
touch to it. At worst, it should have been a yellow card.

DUMBARTON have not always looked the most attack-minded team in the
second division this term but they must be doing something right if they
can take four goals off East Fife, as they did on Boxing Day. They again
looked aggressive enough against Stenhousemuir on Saturday but their
scoring touch totally deserted them and they left Ochilview without a
point.
Industrious though he was, Hugh Ward was the chief sinner in front of
goal for the Sons, who paid dearly for a defensive lapse after 57
minutes. Graeme Armstrong's floated free kick from halfway was allowed
to glide over the defenders and Tom Steel, running in behind them, drove
the ball low into the far corner for the only goal of the game.
'Muir manager Terry Christie agreed that his team had been ''very
fortunate'' to take the points and he was not deceived by a better
result than his team deserved. ''We took advantage of a bad defensive
mistake,'' he said, ''and Dumbarton must blame themselves for missing
chances. But our standard of play today will not do for us.''
Curiously, today's home fixture against Meadowbank, the club Christie
managed for many years, will be a test of a different kind. The
Edinburgh team may be struggling at present but Christie has yet to
enjoy victory over them in his two years in charge of Stenhousemuir.
''It's just another game,'' observed Christie, who must be hopeful
that this particular jinx can be ended today.
Meanwhile, at least, Stenhousemuir's unbeaten home record remains
intact, as does that of Berwick Rangers, who achieved their seventh win
at Shielfield through an Alan Banks penalty on the half-hour against
Stirling Albion after keeper Mike Monaghan had fouled Martin Neil.
Even the sending-off of Neil for a second booking 17 minutes from time
did not mar Berwick's day, and they stay second in the table, whereas
Stirling, who would have been alongside Stenhousemuir if they had won
and 'Muir lost, slipped down to seventh place, below Clyde on goal
difference.
For an hour or so, Morton were top on goal difference, but the point
they took from a 1-1 home draw with Queen of the South in an early
kick-off never looked like being good enough to keep them at the top for
long. Marko Rajamaki shot the Greenock team ahead soon after the
interval but David Jackson knocked in a rebound to earn the Dumfries
Queens a point which edged them above second-bottom Meadowbank.
The Edinburgh team scored first at Methil when Stuart Sorbie headed
home a free kick but Robert Scott's thirteenth goal of the season
levelled it for East Fife right on the interval. Two minutes from time
substitute Steve Hutcheon struck the winner for the Fifers.
Clyde strikers George McCluskey and Alan McKenzie were on target in
the first half for the only goals at Brechin.
At long last, Forfar edged into the lead in the third division, but
their first match for a month was shaping up as an away win for
Cowdenbeath, courtesy of Mark Yardley's twenty-second goal of the
season, until Paul Hannigan saved Forfar's unbeaten home record in the
final minute.
East Stirlingshire are only two points off the top after Mike
Geraghty's volley on the hour mark earned the points at Firs Park and
punished lowly Arbroath for their missed chances.
Alloa lost ground despite a fightback against Queen's Park. The
Amateurs went two up early on through Dom Callan and Scott Edgar but a
Peter Lamont drive and Barry Moffat's header brought equality by
half-time. An Ian Maxwell header produced the winner for Queen's.
Albion Rovers suffered their eighth defeat in nine home games when
Robbie Williamson's goal in 64 minutes proved Ross County's winner at
Coatbridge.

A YEAR after the Profumo affair rocked the Macmillan Government, the
Tory Cabinet feared another major scandal was about to break around it,
writes Roger Williams.
A Sunday newspaper report, suggesting a homosexual relationship
between a well-known Conservative peer and gangster Ronnie Kray -- and
referring to Mayfair parties involving clergymen -- was thought to be
the start of a Labour-backed conspiracy to ''wreck'' the Government.
The file of papers from the office of Prime Minister Sir Alec
Douglas-Home, released at the Public Record Office under the 30-year
rule, shows for the first time just how seriously the story was taken.
There are repeated references to the prospects of a scandal being
unleashed early in August that year, after Parliament had risen for the
summer recess.
In fact, the rumours collapsed as quickly as they had begun.
The Sunday Mirror started the scare with a front-page report headlined
The Peer and the Gangster. It spoke of a top-level Scotland Yard
investigation into a ''homosexual relationship between a prominent peer
and a leading thug in the London underworld'' and said blackmail was
allegedly involved.
The next Sunday, the paper said it had a picture of the peer and the
gangster -- who ''leads the biggest protection racket London has ever
known'' -- together on a sofa, but could not print it.
It gave no names, but members of the Cabinet quickly learned that the
peer was Lord Boothby, former parliamentary private secretary to Sir
Winston Churchill and a household name to millions from countless TV and
radio appearances. The gangster was Ronnie Kray.
The prospect of scandal ended suddenly when Lord Boothby, who was
abroad when the report first appeared, wrote a public letter of denial
to the Times. A few days later the Mirror Group apologised and paid the
peer #40,000.
The original Sunday Mirror story about the police investigation had
been the subject of denial from Scotland Yard. However, the Cabinet
papers make it clear the careful wording left some unconvinced that the
allegations unfounded.
Days later, on July 21, a ''note for the record'' by Sir Alec
Douglas-Home's private secretary, Sir Timothy Bligh, was linking Lord
Boothby with Tom Driberg, a Labour MP known for his flamboyant
homosexual lifestyle.
Marked ''secret'', the note said two Tory MPs had told the party's
Chief Whip ''that Lord Boothby and Mr Driberg had been importuning males
at a dog track and were involved in gangs of thugs who come to dog
tracks to dispose of their money''.
It continued: ''Apparently the chief constable (in the unnamed area)
knows about this but is taking no official action. It is understood,
however, that he is prepared to sell his knowledge to Conservative
MPs.''
Another ''secret'' note on July 19 recorded that Sir Alec and the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, had discussed the affair at the Prime
Minister's country residence, Chequers, and agreed that the ''growing
tide of rumour'' meant ''quick action needed to be taken''.
On the same day, Lord Boothby sent a ''private and confidential''
letter to Home Secretary Henry Brooke, saying he had read the first
Sunday Mirror report while abroad and had enjoyed wondering who the
unnamed peer could be. He had been shocked on his return to learn the
story was about himself.
In fact he had only met Ronald Kray twice and was not aware of his
criminal notoriety, he wrote. The meetings at Lord Boothby's flat each
lasted 20 minutes and were in connection with Kray's suggestion that he
become chairman of a scheme to build houses in Nigeria, an idea he had
rejected.
He had agreed to the photograph being taken of the two of them by a
man accompanying Kray because his would-be business associate was ''a
great fan of mine on radio and television''.
Lord Boothby added: ''I have never attended Mayfair parties. If I were
a homosexual, which I am not, I should not choose either gangsters or
clergymen. It seems to me a frightening thing that rumours of this kind
can be given currency by the gutter press.''
Other papers refer to the possibility of a conspiracy between Labour
MPs and the Mirror Group to smear the Tories, and one suggests the
possibility of a ''Soviet subversion'' behind the allegations.
On August 1, Lord Boothby acted to end the escalating speculation with
a letter to the Times, saying he was the man at the centre of the
reports, which he called ''a tissue of atrocious lies''.
Five days later the Times was recording that Cecil King, chairman of
IPC, then owners of the Sunday Mirror, was now satisfied that any
suggestion of ''an improper nature'' against Lord Boothby was
''completely unjustified''.

SOME respected judges of the game had it that Jose Maria Olazabal
might never win a major championship. Something in that withdrawn
character persuaded them to this view rather than the calibre of his
golf. As the years went by and Olazabal came up short of expectations,
it seemed they were being proved correct.
On the contrary, however, the Spaniard -- still only 28, but with 25
victories world-wide, broke through in the last US Masters. He thereby
demitted office as ''one of the best players not to have won a major
title'' -- a label it was not discreditable to wear, but no great
privilege, either, and one Olazabal was surely happy to untie.
Mark Twain once acutely observed: ''Few things are harder to put up
with than the annoyance of a good example,'' and Olazabal's success at
Augusta must have represented exactly that irritation to the group of
professionals who now seem most likely to have inherited the description
once attached to him.
Now that the gate to another year has opened, these players will be
more acutely aware than before of the expectations they will have of
themselves and the burden of the expectations the media and the public
will lay on them.
Colin Montgomerie frequently asserts the capturing of a major as the
next inevitable step towards advancing his career beyond winning regular
tournaments, orders of merit, and pots of money. To do so, of course, he
will have to put to the ultimate test his sometimes brittle temperament.
Montgomerie regards the US Open as his best opportunity and he has
twice come close in the past three years. Shinnecock Hills, this
season's venue, should suit him, and as Raymond Floyd memorably said
when asked to account for having won there in 1986: ''This is one course
the USGA can't screw up.''
In terms of other horses for the three other courses, for the Masters
two candidates suggest themselves -- the Americans Phil Mickelson and
Tom Lehman. Mickelson hits high, and scrambles and putts superbly --
essential on Augusta's firm and fast greens.
Lehman's inability to make putts on the last nine holes cost him the
title to Olazabal by two strokes, but he, too, is a high-ball striker,
and has a positive attitude. Now he knows he has the golf to win and
that should enhance his prospects.
For the Open Championship at St Andrews, Mark McNulty is a candidate.
The Zimbabwean is 41 and not particularly long, but that should be no
great disadvantage on the Old course, particularly if the fairways are
running. In 1990 a final round of 65 to give him equal-second place,
albeit five strokes behind Nick Faldo, strengthens his claims.
The US PGA Championship will be played at the Riviera Country Club,
where, as it happens, last February Corey Pavin outlasted Fred Couples
to win the Los Angeles Open. Moreover, he was runner-up to Nick Price
for this title last summer and in the 1993 Open at Sandwich he was again
in the thick of the fight.
Price, and before him Greg Norman, were invincible in those weeks, but
as Pavin also showed when he won the World Matchplay championship, he
has the versatile sort of game which can adapt to a wide variety of
courses and conditions.
Interestingly, as many as nine of the current leading 20 players on
the Sony world rankings have not won a major title, and that statistic
emphasises how difficult it has become to do so. The strength in depth
of the competition simply means that the winning of championships, never
mind tournaments, has never been so hard to achieve.

HEARTS midfielder Jim Bett will decide at the end of this month
whether he has the appetite to continue Premier League football, writes
Graeme Smith.
Bett said, after having played at Pittodrie for the first time since
he left Aberdeen, that he had given no thought about what he would do
when his contract with Hearts expired at the end of January.
''It's just a case of whether you can keep your appetite going but
Hearts have been really good, and I have enjoyed it. The only problem
has been the travelling.''
One possibility for Bett will be a return to Iceland, his wife's
homeland, where he enjoyed a successful period last season as a
player-coach.

BROADWOOD Stadium has a trim wee electronic scoreboard which just
loves to tell the folks what's going on. On Saturday, it chattered out
goals galore from around the country. There was action abroad, it
seemed. There was even a couple's engagement congratulations.
As far as Airdrie's promotion-chasing clash against Dunfermline was
concerned, however, the board was redundant. The scorer, as they say,
was not troubled.
The 3500 fans who braved the bitter cold on the last day of the year
had to rely on inner heat previously consumed. What happened on the
pitch certainly gave them nothing but cold discomfort.
The match was a repeat of the first league game of the season, when
these two teams met. The goalless score was even the same -- and Airdrie
have had five such results at their temporary lodgings so far this
season. Airdrie, in nine home games, have scored 13 goals -- but eight
of them were against Stranraer.
The sending-off of Paul Jack after 19 minutes for a ''last man''
tackle certainly did not help Airdrie, but Dunfermline's insistence on
playing with five across the back played right into the hands of the
10-man Diamonds.
Now both sides must pick up today to stop Dundee -- 4-0 winners over
St Mirren, and who travel to meet the other Saints at Perth -- from
running too far ahead. The Fifers are at home to Raith Rovers, but they
will be without defender Neale Cooper, taken off at half-time with a
head knock and a suspected cracked rib. Jackie McNamara, also
substituted because of injury, should make it.
Raith manager Jimmy Nicholl rested himself in the 2-0 win over St
Johnstone at Stark's Park, where Julian Broddle got the important goals.
Airdrie, of course, will be without Jack for their trip to Firhill to
face a Hamilton side which gained full points with a 2-1 win at Ayr. It
was a result that keeps Hamilton just in touch with the chasing pack,
but leaves Ayr in trouble in second-bottom spot. An unhappy incident was
John McQuade being carried off with a suspected broken leg after a clash
with Duncan George. However, he has been given the all-clear.
The relegation battle is becoming tighter, with Stranraer defeating
Clydebank 3-2 at Kilbowie, pulling Bankies right into the fight, and
that St Mirren defeat at Dundee keeping them in third-bottom place.
Dens manager Jim Duffy, conceded that the scoreline against Saints was
false. It had been an even game, with a first-minute strike by Jim
Hamilton all that was in it until 13 minutes from time, when former
Saint George Shaw hit three goals -- the fastest hat trick of the
season.
Referee Andrew Waddell -- controversially involved in the battle of
Broadwood recently, when four Stranraer players were sent off and three
booked -- grabbed some limelight again by booking five and giving
reserve keeper and coach Campbell Money a red card immediately after the
match at Dens Park.
Duffy faces a selection problem today. He allowed midfielder Hamilton
to visit his family in Peterhead for the New Year, but when the young
player tried to return to Dundee yesterday, the roads south were blocked
by snow. There will be an anxious wait to see whether or not they are
cleared in time today.
Clydebank and St Mirrenhave plenty of pieces to pick up when they meet
today at Love Street, knowing that if Stranraer can gain full points at
home to Ayr United, then the battle really will be joined to avoid the
drop.

THEY are different, that's all. They're just different from all the
rest, and they will win their seventh successive premier division
championship no matter the cautious noises which will emanate from Ibrox
throughout the second half of the campaign.
It will be of absolutely no consequence either that Motherwell and
other teams will refuse openly to concede defeat. Like some unstoppable
juggernaut on a highway littered with Morris Minors and Ladas, Walter
Smith will drive his side on towards that piece of silverware which has
become their own in recent years.
Alex McLeish, Motherwell's manager, says the players who beat his lot
3-1 at Fir Park on Saturday have a ''big-game mentality,'' and he is
correct, but they also are beginning again to enjoy the large slices of
good fortune which talented, well-balanced teams seem to command.
Perhaps they make their own luck, who knows, but the fact is the ball
bounces for them in different ways. It offers them a kindness denied
others.
You don't believe me? How about an example.
Shaun McSkimming tried a shot from long range. It was ambitious, but
his shot beat Rangers' keeper, Colin Scott, who was a shade slow in
reacting to the danger as the ball flew his way. By the time he hit the
turf the ball had hit a post before running clear.
In the second half, Brian Laudrup, who had duped defenders on the
right-hand side of Motherwell's defence into allowing him a yard of
space, curled the ball towards the left-hand corner of Stevie Woods'
goal. The keeper was beaten and the ball hit a post.
However, instead of being left feeling cheated like McSkimming
earlier, Laudrup had to stifle a guffaw as he saw the ball come back off
the post and hit Woods on the head as he turned. The ball then trundled
into the net and Rangers were back in front after 66 minutes.
Only two minutes earlier, Paul McGrillen, who had been introduced to
the match at half-time as a straight replacement for the injured Dougie
Arnott, had evened the score. He had run on -- he was allowed to proceed
even though he appeared well offside as he collected McSkimming's pass
-- into Rangers box before tucking the ball neatly away in the left-hand
corner of Scott's net.
Had they protected their own net properly for a longer spell
Motherwell might have been able to reproduce the aggressive attacking
style which had served them well in the first half. In fact, they were
extremely unfortunate to go indoors a goal down at the break.
Not too long after the post had denied McSkimming -- and only two
minutes before half-time -- Stuart McCall scored. He had taken the ball
from Laudrup and played it wide to Pieter Huistra, who then returned the
favour even if his pass was mishit.
McCall scored as though it was the most natural thing in the world for
him to do when, of course, the statistics prove the opposite to be the
case. His goal was his first league goal of the season and came after
his son, Lee, had called him up before the match and suggested to him
that it was about time he put the ball in the net.
''Mark Hateley had also just said it was about time I had scored and
it was nice to oblige them both,'' said McCall, whose midfield play has
been improving steadily over the past couple of months. ''You know, to
score three goals in a match without Mark Hateley is quite an
achievement.''
Rangers' third goal was scored by Gordon Durie after he had taken
control of Huistra's excellent through ball and then skipped around
Woods.
Hateley and Ally McCoist are expected to return for Wednesday's Old
Firm match at Ibrox, and with Richard Gough and Alan McLaren looking
good in defence, Celtic will have to produce something special to win.
Motherwell knew they had to do so, but they failed. McLeish said: ''I'm
not conceding anything, but it will be difficult to stop Rangers now.''
Miodrag Krivokapic, the most cultured player on the pitch apart from
Laudrup, had tried his best to mark the great Dane, but found it
difficult and was booked near the end. He pulled Laudrup down just as
the Rangers player was about to run free, and Krivokapic could not have
complained had his punishment been more severe.
''Laudrup is very good, very talented, although his skills are nothing
new to me. You must remember, I played in Yugoslavia and also for the
national team,'' said Krivokapic. ''But it is correct, he is very
difficult to mark.''
In a match which probably pointed Rangers towards another success four
more players, Motherwell's McSkimming and McGrillen, and McCall and
Charlie Miller, of Rangers, were booked.

In Scotland there are 11 mountain rescue teams and 400 official
rescuers. As much as #100,000 of public money is spent on medical
services, police time, and helicopters . . . all to pay for the sport
and personal pleasure of hill climbers and walkers (December 29).
Don't misunderstand me. I was one of them, and on no account should we
interfere, beyond professional advice, with this healthy access to the
hills; but victims of misfortune should pay for the costs involved, even
a proportion.
Surely this can be arranged through personal accident insurance, the
premium graded according to experience.
Would you get away with it in Switzerland or Norway?

The year 1994 should be most remembered for a new beginning in South
Africa, Palestine, and Northern Ireland. Hopefully there will be no
turning back to majority rule, a freeing of the occupied land, and an
end to religious hatred.
The death of John Smith, leader of the Opposition, shocked the nation,
but what he stood for lives on. The disgraced administration in the
United States under President Clinton and the discredited and the most
unpopular British Government of John Major will carry on, in defeat,
doing more damage than good.
Unfortunately, drugs, crime, and homelessness in Britain are on the
increase while poverty and starvation in the wider world knows no
abatement.
At last, after several delays, the Channel Tunnel has opened for rail
traffic, but the Estonia disaster made a mockery of the advance in
technology.
The United Nations and the civilised world could not stop the tyranny
of the Serbs in Bosnia and the massacres in Rwanda.
Freedom of the small and the weak nations carried on being sacrificed
at the hands of the mighty and more powerful in Bosnia and Chechnya.
Suppression in Kosova and Kashmir goes on unabated and the champions
of justice and the torch-bearers of democracy looked away.
Health Care International opened the Clydebank hospital and soon went
into receivership, wiping out between #30m and #44m of public money. I
hope the commercialisation of health on a grand scale in Scotland will
be buried for good.
On a happier note, Raith Rovers won the Coca-Cola Cup and Archbishop
Thomas Winning became a Cardinal.

The chairman of the Royal Alexandra Hospital trust in Paisley
complains about misrepresentation by the general secretary of MSF (the
union for skilled and professional people) over salaries in the NHS
(December 14). As the RAH has just published its first annual report as
a trust, let's look at the facts.
The five lay board members get #5000 each per annum for, according to
the chairman, being ''involved in hospital duties at least one day a
week''.
The chairman gets substantially over #15,000 per annum for what is
essentially a part-time job, however long he spends ''speaking to
staff''. Other jobs outwith the NHS are not precluded.
The chief executive gets over #50,000 a year, plus fringe benefits.
There are no fewer than 46 senior medical staff earning the same or
more as the chief executive. The highest paid individual is, in fact,
earning up to #85,000 a year.
This year the RAH Trust declared a 6.2% rate of return, ie profit, on
its assets. That is equivalent to a surplus of #3.8m.
Those figures must be authentic because they are all taken from the
annual report. How, I wonder, does the chairman reconcile that sort of
expenditure with the statement that he himself makes right at the
beginning of the report: ''First and foremost the Royal Alexandra
Hospital exists within the National Health Service to provide for those
in need.''

THE time for post-mortem examinations and apportioning blame at Dundee
United is over. What is necessary is swift, decisive action, and the
outcome will have to be the departure of manager Ivan Golac -- whoever
is at fault for the complete breakdown of the operation at Tannadice.
The performance of the team in Saturday's 4-0 defeat by Hibernian at
Easter Road was an utter disgrace, which carries with it the real
possibility of relegation.
United's players are said to like Golac, his style and his methods. If
that is the case, they chose to show it by putting on an undiluted P45
performance.
It was so depressing to watch Saturday's unenthusiastic lot and recall
the thrill of enjoying the Hegarty-Narey, Sturrock-Dodds-led team of the
eighties.
The delight of the five goals being placed in Borussia
Moenchengladbach's net, and the ecstatic shock of Kevin Gallacher's
spectacular winner against Barcelona, are a million miles away.
The team deserted by a couple of dozen supporters by half-time at
chilly Easter Road, possess talent, but the lack of motivation was
alarming. Whatever career journey Golac now makes, Gordan Petric the
club's record signing, is clearly intent on accompanying his countryman
judging from Saturday.
How can youngsters like Andy McLaren, Grant Johnson, Robby Winters and
David Hannah cope when a talented internationalist is simply strolling
through the motions?
All of this was no fault of Alex Miller's team, who took their cue
from inept United, and completed an exciting, pacey, clinical execution.
With Keith Wright back to lead the Hibernian attack, the skills of
Michael O'Neill, Darren Jackson and Kevin McAllister were released to
lethal effect. Wright's hat trick underlined a stunning comeback from a
player who has missed the entire first half of the season after having a
hernia operation and a serious ankle ligament injury.
And his goals in the first, fourteenth, and fifty-fifth minutes even
astonished the player who, with 19 goals last season, was the Edinburgh
club's top scorer.
''I didn't score in my last two preparation reserve games and I fully
expected it to take a few matches to recover the sharpness that leads to
goals,'' he admitted. ''Scoring in the opening minute was a terrific
tonic and everything just flowed from there. It was a great team
performance.''
O'Neill combined with Wright to snatch the remaining goal on a day of
Hibernian domination.
Now at Tannadice, it is down to chairman Jim McLean. As their manager,
he was one of the country's most decisive and for the sake of the club
he has devoted his working life to, he must show the same
single-mindedness now.

Mr T E Whittle needs to learn a few home truths (December 24). New
roads do not remove congestion or improve the economy. Building railways
produces more jobs per pound than building roads. Trains are infinitely
more environmentally friendly than cars and lorries.
Mr Whittle should read the devastating report of the Royal Commission
on Environmental Pollution which recommends switching resources and
traffic from road and air to rail, something we and many others have
been demanding for years.
Mr Whittle's figures on the alleged subsidy from motorists to the rest
of us do not take into account the cost of accidents, policing,
pollution, company cars, etc.
Railtrack is having to meet the cost of the flooding and #800,000 for
undermining on the east coast main line.
The taxpayers pick up the bill for acts of God and man on our roads.
Mr Whittle has not explained why, alone among taxpayers, motorists
hypothecate their taxes to a single purpose.
As for safety, the Health and Safety Executive tells BR it should aim
for zero accidents. The same absolute standard of safety should be
imposed on lorry and coach operators. No passengers were killed in train
crashes in the last financial year.

CARLOS Alberto Parreira, who guided Brazil to World Cup success last
summer, has asked FIFA to experiment with 10-man teams to improve the
quality of football.
The most successful coach in the game concedes that the current
generation of Brazilians bear no comparison with the legends of the
past.
For this he blames the lack of space in the modern game for the more
skilful players to exploit their talents -- a view propounded recently
by Dundee United's chairman Jim McLean.
Now with Valencia, Parreira insisted: ''There were many negative
remarks from Pele and Gerson, to name just two, but I never listened to
them because either they do not know the game or they never saw us play.
''I admit, though, that the quality of players like those two is not
now available but we still have the best players in the world. I
strongly believe this.
''The reason why we do not play as they did in 1970 is that the
opposition do not allow you to. There is no space to put on that kind of
show.
''That is why I have asked FIFA to experiment with 10-a-side games,
then there would be the room to provide more entertainment.
''We succeeded where others had failed in the past 24 years because we
had the best organisation on and off the field. We became so united as a
group that not even the substitutes made unhappy noises.
''The main joy for me was that I never changed my ideas. I am proud to
say that I did it my way and the Brazilian way which made our people
proud.
''Now, I am under pressure to bring the championship to Valencia who
were first to approach me after the World Cup. The expectations are
prematurely high.
''I have changed 10 players, the coaching staff, and the playing
system. That it too much for immediate results and other improvements
must also be made.
''I signed only a one-year contract in Spain. Another offer has been
made but certain things must take place before I agree.''
Rui Costa, the Portuguese internationalist who is now with Fiorentina,
is suing his former club, Benfica, over his transfer to Italy.
The player was offered a free transfer by Benfica because of their
financial troubles but declined on the understanding that he would
benefit from any future move.
Now, he is seeking a substantial share of the #4m Fiorentina paid last
summer to acquire him.
An opinion poll carried out in the Bundesliga bodes ill for national
coach Berti Vogts. For 350 players, amounting to 74% of those polled,
believe he should be dismissed.
The verdict will, no doubt, strengthen Vogts' conviction that his
future lies in a return to club management.
Another beleaguered manager, Paul van Himst, did the honourable thing
by offering his resignation in the wake of Belgium's defeat by Spain,
their heaviest in 30 years on home soil, in the European Championships.
Surprisingly, this was refused by Dr Michel d'Hooghe, their FA
president, who wants van Himst to remain until the conclusion of the
World Cup finals in France in 1998.

I am told by this Government that the very large sums being paid to
top executives are the only way to attract the best men.
The best men to man the new tug in the Minches are surely the men from
the surrounding islands -- but they cost more than Croatians (December
28).
How cynical can this Government get?

J Gilchrist makes no attempt to contend with the substance of my
letter, namely, that there is no scientific basis for the theory of
evolution and that the facts of science point rather to Special Creation
by the Almighty God of the Bible (December 16 and 23).
It is perhaps his own knowledge of the real state of affairs that
causes him to ignore this and turn instead to a feeble attempt at
ridicule. Such has been the posture of much of the scientific community
until recently, but now many have faced up to the contradictions of
their stance and have given up their ''faith'' in the philosophy of
evolution.

I expect many of your readers shared with me a deep sense of anger and
disappointment at the tenor of James Freeman's article on the issue of
life sentences (December 27).
His use of the term ''lifers'' throughout the piece was surely no
coincidence as not once did he seek to consider the fact that those in
question were incarcerated because they had murdered one or several of
their fellow citizens.
Moreover his perception that the desire for stronger action against
such individuals stems primarily from the tabloid press and a handful of
politicians is palpable nonsense, flying in the face of the increasing
fear and anger felt by so many of our citizens towards these killers.
James Freeman's sentiments sounded a particularly hollow note as the
same issue carried details of still more murder and misery in Scotland.
The article's assertion that ''a life sentence really means life'' was
the most derisory of all. It was immediately undermined by the statement
that, on average, a murderer will be walking the streets within 12
years.
James Freeman further highlighted the constraints placed upon the
actions of those murderers released on licence, while failing to
recognise that most citizens live under identical or largely similar
constraints in modern society.
Sadly the people who suffer a ''death sentence'' are the victims
themselves, while a ''life sentence'' of torture and heartache is always
accorded to their families -- with no prospect of remission after a
dozen or so years.
While those such as James Freeman contend that life should mean life
only in particular cases where exceptional circumstances apply, the
opposite, in fact, should be the case.
As a society, we owe it to the victims and to our fellow citizens to
ensure that life sentences are applied in a literal manner to those who
commit such heinous crimes.

AND the winners so far in the lottery that constitutes English
football's arduous holiday period are . . . Blackburn Rovers and
Liverpool at one end of the table, Sheffield Wednesday at the other.
Those three have answered the demands of the past week by achieving
100% records which could all be maintained with home advantage today.
Kenny Dalglish was in stitches, for once, as Blackburn ended 1994 as
Premiership leaders. An appendix operation on Christmas Eve confined him
to bed but had no adverse effect on his team, who defeated Manchester
City and Crystal Palace without undue fuss. Had last Wednesday's home
game against Leeds not been postponed, their lead might have been six
points. It still will be if they reverse last season's unexpected home
defeat by West Ham today.
United, suffering a run of injuries, dropped two more points in a
robust game at Southampton on Saturday to follow those squandered last
Wednesday when Mark McGhee took Leicester City to Old Trafford and
surprised his former Aberdeen mentor Alex Ferguson with a 1-1 draw.
Another sorcerer's apprentice upstaging his master is Liverpool's
gifted young striker Robbie Fowler. After scoring in each of his side's
three wins in a week, Fowler has 22 goals this season to Ian Rush's 11.
Norwich make the uncomfortable cross-country trek to Anfield with a
victory behind them, 2-1 over suffering Newcastle United, who have won
only twice in 10 games since Manchester United ended their long unbeaten
sequence late in October. A knee injury that will rule the elegant
Belgian defender Phillipe Albert out until next season is an awful blow
to Tyneside.
There are already some startling changes in the league table.
Tottenham used the fear of relegation to sack Ossie Ardiles, yet now lie
sixth. How they must have celebrated in the Spurs half of north London
following a 4-0 success at Coventry, which coincided with a 3-1 home
defeat for hapless Arsenal by Queen's Park Rangers. It was not the day
on which Dane John Jensen would have wished to finally score for the
Gunners, at his ninety-eighth attempt; nor the build-up George Graham
wanted to tonight's derby at White Hart Lane.
Sheffield Wednesday's Trevor Francis has managed to confound the
prophets of doom. Saturday's 1-0 win at Leicester followed nine goals in
two previous games and carried Wednesday into the top 10 for the first
time this season.
Ipswich and Leicester, left far behind, meet today with victory for
either welcome enough, but of limited use following further defeats on
Saturday. Everton's 4-1 win over Ipswich and their new manager George
Burley -- Duncan Ferguson scoring the first -- made up for a home defeat
against Wednesday by the same score.
The teams sinking fastest towards trouble are Coventry (nine goals
conceded in two games) and Crystal Palace, who must have forgotten how
it feels to score a goal after eight league games without one.

New document disclosures reveal that, in issues ranging from sex
scandals to radioactive school milk, secrecy was the Government
watchword three decades ago
THE year was 1964. While the country was supposed to be swinging,
Beatlemania was the rage and Mods and Rockers fought on the beaches, the
Tory government of Sir Alec Douglas-Home was limping towards defeat,
writes MARGARET VAUGHAN. Harold Wilson led Labour to a narrow victory at
an October General election, ending 13 years of Conservative rule.
Secret government papers for 1964, opened for the first time
yesterday, reveal that open government was not even a fearful glimmer in
the eye of an establishment inured to keeping confidential the business
of how best to rule the country.
The public interest was served by secrecy. And the files disclose the
extent to which the concealment of information was often the guiding
priority of those who believed they knew best. From rumours that a Tory
peer was involved in a homosexual relationship with gangster Ronnie
Kray, to senior civil servants hushing up high levels of radioactive
contaminated milk being swallowed by Scottish children, secrecy was the
watchword.
Other earlier documents released yesterday under the current
Government's open-government policy -- they were intended to remain
closed for 50 years -- include the final medical reports on mass
murderer Peter Manuel in 1958 (see opposite page); 4500 school
inspectors' reports; and revelations on the American attitude to
compensation for Scottish victims in the event of a nuclear catastrophe
at the Holy Loch Polaris base on the Clyde.

THOSE who claim that Huntly are not as good a team as last season have
been made to eat their words of late as the Highland League side opened
up a five-point gap at the top of the table.
A recent victory at Keith, whom they again meet in the Scottish Cup
this weekend, allowed the champions to enjoy their Hogmanay, while
defeats for some of their challengers also slipped down well for the
leaders.
Elgin City's title aspirations took a dent against fourth-placed Cove
Rangers, who won 3-1 with goals from Ray Lorimer, Mike Beattie, and Dave
Caldwell.
A further blow for City is that keeper Craig Hinchcliffe may be about
to join Huddersfield. He has had a successful trial with the English
side and City are awaiting further further developments.
Another title-chasing side suffered a reverse. Lossiemouth were beaten
at home by Fort William, with Finlay Shearer, brother of Aberdeen and
Scotland striker Duncan, netting the winner after 75 minutes.
Fraserburgh took 69 minutes to open the scoring against Rothes -- then
hit five within 18 minutes through Keith McRedie, Chris Beaton, Marino
Keith, and Paul Keith (2).
Alan Murray netted for Wick -- his eighteenth of the season -- in
their 2-2 draw against Nairn County, while Alan McPherson struck in the
last minute to give Buckie Thistle the points at Forres.

ABERDEEN travel to Tannadice today hoping to kick off 1995 with the
confidence which Duncan Shearer helped restore on Hogmanay.
Shearer's absence through injury since September has coincided with
one of the worst runs in Aberdeen's history and there was a huge burden
of expectation from his team-mates, as well as the Aberdeen fans, when
he started his first full game against Hearts.
He took just five seconds to show it was a responsibility he could
shoulder.
Dodds took the kick-off and tapped the ball to Shearer, who took
advantage of the wind to send a 45-yard shot rocketing towards the
Hearts' goal, forcing Craig Nelson to tip it over the bar for a corner.
''I didn't expect to score, but it gets the crowd behind you,'' said
Shearer. ''The gaffer's always saying to try and get an early shot in,
and you can't get much earlier that.''
Just a minute after having rounded the Hearts wall with a 25-yard free
kick, Shearer scored Aberdeen's first goal at Pittodrie since October
29. In the thirteenth minute Nelson came off his line to try to catch a
Miller cross, but Shearer beat him to it and sent a header looping over
the keeper and into the net.
John Inglis, who is establishing himself as a commanding force in the
Dons' defence, notched his first for the club after 28 minutes by
tapping in a Stephen Wright cut-back.
After the interval Ray McKinnon replaced Peter Hetherston, who had
twisted his knee and is a serious doubt for today's match with Dundee
United. He quickly made an impact, providing the pass to Kane, who set
Shearer up with only Nelson to beat, and the striker curled the ball
round the keeper.
Aberdeen had been playing some of their best football of the season,
although the Hearts performance did make life a little easier for them,
but after the third goal they eased up.
Youngster Kevin Thomas, who had replaced John Robertson at half-time
in a tactical move, pulled one back when he was left unmarked to head in
a Colin Miller cross. But Hearts never looked capable of denying
Aberdeen a victory they so desperately needed.
Hearts manager Tommy McLean felt his team got what they deserved. ''We
cut our own throats,'' he said. ''The calibre of the goals was
ridiculous and can be traced back to three individual mistakes. They
played in fits in starts and in the later stages had a wee flurry, but
by then the game was lost.''
Aberdeen assistant manager Roy Aitken was delighted with the victory
but unhappy at how the players ''took their foot off the pedal'' in the
second half.

THE US Government unashamedly tried to wriggle out of a legally
binding agreement which would have forced it to pay compensation to
Scottish victims in the event of a nuclear catastrophe at the Holy Loch
Polaris base on the Clyde, the newly-released Cabinet papers for 1964
disclose.
President Johnson's attempt to renege on the deal came at a late stage
of negotiations on safety precautions at the Holy Loch after the talks
between the two governments had been going on for three years.
The last-minute turnaround caused great consternation in the Cabinet
as the Conservatives' 13-year term of government was rapidly running
out. It was an embarrassment for Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home,
anxious to conclude a Holy Loch agreement before a General Election was
called later that year.
Had the US got away with it, it would have broken an agreement reached
two years before.
In an attempt to save the Government from embarrassment, a compromise
was hastily worked out and was included in a Memorandum of Understanding
agreed at a meeting between the American President and Sir Alec in
Washington that February.
However, while the compromise did include a form of words that
satisfied the Government's conscience, it did leave room for ambiguity
-- on which the Americans would have been able to rely in a court-test
scenario.
Thirty years on, it might come as a shock to those living close to the
base -- and those living in Glasgow could be included -- that
politicians were thinking in terms of liability and compensation.
Thirty years on, it might come as a shock to those living close to the
base - and those living in Glasgow could be included - that politicians
were thinking in terms of liability and compensation.
In 1962 Britain and America had agreed on a formula covering how
liability in a nuclear accident should be assessed and the basis on
which claims could be met.
In essence these matters would be dealt with under the terms of the
Nato Status of Forces agreement in accordance with the principle of sole
and absolute liability of the operator -- subject to a maximum of $100m
for claims arising out of any one incident. That formula had the benefit
of being binding in law.
Out of the blue, the Americans withdrew their agreement as it would
have become a precedent for dealing with incidents arising from the
presence of nuclear-powered warships anywhere in the world.
As an alternative they proposed that claims should be settled through
diplomatic channels in accordance with customary procedures for the
settlement of international claims under generally accepted principles
of law and equity.
In a memorandum to the Premier, Cabinet Secretary Sir Burke Trend
declared that the Americans were trying to avoid not only the
application of the Nato Status of Forces Agreement, but also any
detailed formula for liability. He was scathing about the US proposal to
deal with such matters through diplomatic channels.
''There are no generally accepted principles of Law and Equity in
relation to nuclear damage and the danger is therefore left at the mercy
of any delay or prevarication which the US authorities may see fit to
deploy,'' he said.
The Cabinet was told in January 1964 that acceptance of the revised
American formula would not be consistent with assurances previously
given to Parliament that claims would be dealt with under the Nato
status agreement. Moreover, it would not give claimants an unambiguous
right to restitution.
According to the newly-released Cabinet minutes, Defence Minister
Peter Thorneycroft told his colleagues: ''The Government is not in a
strong position to negotiate better terms; but it might be possible to
reach a compromise on the basis of a formula which retained at least
some features of the earlier agreement.''
That is what happened.
The form of words agreed and included in the Memorandum of
Understanding was: ''Except in cases covered by the Nato Status of
Forces agreement, claims following from a nuclear incident or accident
involving one of the submarines will be dealt with through diplomatic
channels in accordance with customary procedures for the settlement of
international claims.''
This enabled Sir Alec on his return from Washington the following
month to report to his colleagues that the difference of views over the
Holy Loch matter appeared to have been satisfactorily resolved.

THEY didn't do a lap of honour around Hampden. With due respect to
Falkirk's hard-won current reputation, beating them at home is not quite
the stuff of ritual dance, although Celtic had reached the point where
victory over anybody was bound to induce some joy.
The first league win since September, after a run of 12 games without
a victory, entitles any side to a wee celebration but, times being the
way they are, Celtic are a long distance away from open-top bus parades.
They were not easy winners, even if the 2-0 scoreline suggests a
comfortable afternoon. Until they scored the first goal midway in the
second half, in fact, they looked a shade odds-on to be the victims.
However, they have lost games they should have won often enough in the
past and it would be churlish to grudge them the three points this time.
If there were few inspiring moments, no-one could deny the
willingness, industry, and urgency in their play. As things stand, that
combination may help them to regain some self-belief but looks unlikely
to be enough to lift them to trophy territory.
Manager Tommy Burns, none the less, was entitled to be a bit happier
as the new year beckoned. If he had been leading his team into the Old
Firm meeting with a 12-game winless run behind them, injecting any kind
of confidence would have been difficult, if not impossible.
For all his awareness of the team's vulnerability -- and Burns has not
been shy about facing up to the realities -- the manager has shown a bit
of courage himself by throwing in the young players in the midst of what
was to become the longest unsuccessful run of league matches in the
club's history. He did not shirk the possibility of outraged criticism,
either, when he decided to play with two wingers in the last two games,
against Aberdeen and Falkirk.
He earned the reward for his daring with a draw at Pittodrie and a win
yesterday. The two young wingers, Chris Hay and Brian McLaughlin, were
by no means outstanding but they show enough ability to warrant an
extended run.
The best showing of a young Celt this time was by Stuart Gray -- son
of former Leeds and Scotland star, Eddie -- the midfield player who was
hauled on to the field as a full back to replace injured Tosh McKinlay
after only half an hour. Gray had a splendid game, slotting in
comfortably to his defensive role but also using the ball intelligently
when he did get forward.
Still, the top man for the Parkhead lot was someone who has been
around the scene a while. He may be the centre of much controversy among
some Celtic fans, who seem to be either loudly for or bullishly against
him, but Peter Grant can never be accused of dereliction of duty.
He led by example in the second half, tackling furiously in his own
half one moment and racing forward the next.
0 It was his anticipation of what could develop that brought the
opening goal. He ran something like 60 yards as a move on the left
gathered momentum. Collins fed the ball back to Gray, whose pass to
McLaughlin was accurate enough to leave the little winger with space and
time to decide his next move.
It was decided for him, however, as by now Grant had completed his
long journey and was ready to join the fun. McLaughlin duly obliged with
a sweet pass and Grant hit it early to beat Billy Lamont.
The goal came just when Falkirk seemed to have the upper hand and
transformed Celtic into a team who suddenly wondered what all their
uncertainty was about. Six minutes later Andy Walker, who had missed an
easier chance in the first half, squeezed in the second goal and
everything in the Celtic garden was fine.
''That was a game we should never have lost,'' said Falkirk gaffer Jim
Jefferies. He was right but, as Burns could tell him, it sometimes works
that way.

* THE Scottish Office papers on the typhoid epidemic reveal the fury
within the ranks of its own medical establishment at the high-profile
tactics adopted by Aberdeen's Medical Officer of Health, Dr Ian McQueen.
His open response to the crisis, holding two press conferences a day
and going on TV and radio to explain what was happening, contrasts
sharply with the preferred tactics of medical officers employed by the
Home and Health Department.
He was credited with preventing the epidemic from becoming a tragedy
but there were no plaudits for his open response from within Civil
Service circles.
In a scathing memorandum on the file, dated June 16, 1964, Dr I N
Sutherland criticises the publicity given to the epidemic and blames Dr
McQueen and the media for inflaming public fears:
''It is indeed interesting that this outbreak, which has not led to
the death of any patient from typhoid, has on the whole caused as much
disorganisation and misrepresentation as a localised outbreak of
smallpox.
''For that I think some blame must be laid at the door of the global
media, including particularly television and the press.
''They were ready to seize the opportunities given them by a medical
officer of health who was acutely health-education-conscious and to
apply outside Aberdeen measures which it was his duty to try and apply
within the city itself.''
A few days earlier, Scotland's chief medical officer of health, Dr
John Brotherston, reported in a memo on the file that he had discussed
the epidemic with Dr McQueen and, somewhat tartly, pointed out: ''He is
obviously tired. The sooner he can be persuaded to take some rest the
better.''

HEALTH officials knew months before the 1964 Aberdeen typhoid epidemic
that cans of corned beef from Argentina, similar to those responsible
for the outbreak, were contaminated with the disease.
The newly-released Cabinet papers reveal that, following a health
inspection of the South American plants producing meat the previous
year, at least one ship carrying consignments to this country was turned
around on the high seas for fear of a typhoid epidemic.
Amazingly, the documents show that corned beef from the same sources
already in the country was allowed to be distributed. The Government was
at pains to keep this dark.
The 1964 Cabinet, under the premiership of Sir Alec Douglas-Home, was
kept up-to-date with the Aberdeen crisis.
Minutes of a Cabinet meeting reveal ministers were informed that ''it
had recently come to light that, as the result of two isolated cases of
the disease which had appeared in the previous year, arrangements had
been made to inspect certain meat-packing establishments in the
Argentine, from which supplies of tinned meat, similar to those which
were believed to be the cause of the outbreak, were regularly shipped to
this country.
''This inspection had resulted in a decision that we should refuse to
accept further consignments from these establishments until they adopted
more satisfactory hygienic precautions, particularly as regards
chlorination of water used for cooling the tins.''
However, the minute goes on to record: ''Certain consignments which
had already reached this country were allowed to be distributed.''
The documents show that the Government of the day was concerned to
play down knowledge of the previous outbreak.
Mr Selwyn Lloyd, Leader of the House of Commons, was asked to keep
ministers in close touch with developments in Aberdeen and to consider
''how the possible implications of this outbreak would best be
presented, if necessary, to public opinion''.
In a report to another Cabinet meeting, Health Minister Anthony Barber
reported that, following the initial inquiry and the discovery that an
Argentine plant had been using unchlorinated water in the canning
process, consignments had been turned back on the high seas.
He admitted that supplies already distributed in the UK had not been
recalled and he told his colleagues it was desirable to avoid
stimulating public anxiety about the large stocks of corned beef
imported before the introduction of the practice of using chlorinated
water in the canning process.
The outbreak caused near-panic. So much so that Mr Michael Noble, then
Secretary of State for Scotland, was asked to research any action that
would be required if it was later found necessary to isolate Aberdeen
from the rest of the United Kingdom.

IT was perhaps thoughts of the forthcoming General Election that
encouraged Sir Alec Douglas-Home and his Cabinet colleagues to save the
Highland rail lines from the Beeching axe in 1964, writes James
McKillop. The Inverness-Kyle and the Inverness-Wick/ Thurso lines remain
open to fight the same battles today.
Clearly 30 years ago Sir Alec was concerned about the way public
opinion was moving in Scotland. In January he met three deputations from
north of the Border in a two-hour meeting at Dover House in London. Each
argued for the retention of lines. The largest deputation was led by
Lord Polwarth, then chairman of the Scottish Council (Development and
Industry).
Such was the Prime Minister's concern about the dwindling Conservative
support in Scotland that he specifically asked his officials to provide
him with the account of the meeting carried in the Glasgow Herald.
At the time of the meeting it seemed unlikely that the Government was
willing to give in. However, with Conservative support in Scotland
disintegrating, it was announced in June that the rail lines would be
saved.
As it turned out, Sir Alec was right to be concerned about
Conservative support in Scotland. In October he lost the election to
Harold Wilson by only four seats. But for the Scottish massacre of
Tories, the history of the past 30 years might have taken a different
route.

CHANCELLOR Reginald Maudling was becoming deeply concerned about the
state of the economy, but still the Conservative Cabinet of 1964 was
determined to push on with expensive grandiose schemes, writes James
McKillop.
High on the list of priorities was approval to join in a scheme to
construct a Channel Tunnel. It would have cost a staggering #80m, the
Cabinet was told.
Nevertheless, it would cut the transport costs of exports to Europe by
10%, and from about 1977 onwards the cumulative cost of the then
existing sea and air links between UK and the Continent would show an
increasing excess over the comparative cost of the tunnel.
Ministers of the day supporting a Channel Tunnel argued that unless we
joined in the project, the French would claim the United Kingdom was not
committed to a close relationship with continental Europe.
But the Conservative Government was overwhelmed by the likely cost of
participating in the construction of the Channel Tunnel. Agreeing that
Britain's share was likely to be #80m, it felt that the amounts involved
over a period of years could endanger the economy.
Another point made at a Cabinet meeting was: ''It would be unwise to
assume a project of this magnitude could be financed by private capital.
In particular it would be objectionable to allow a private company the
freedom to vary charges for the use of the tunnel which would be
necessary to attract equity capital.''
The original tunnel project was shelved, but the likely cost of the
programme reactivated by the later Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
is now estimated at around #10 billion. Investors in the project
probably regret that she opted that it should be funded out of private
capital.

IT WAS a sponsor's nightmare when the train carrying Scottish athletes
from Glasgow arrived almost an hour-and-a-quarter late in Durham for the
World Cross Challenge meeting on Saturday, writes Doug Gillon.
The hopes of three-times national champion Tom Murray and former
double runner-up Robert Quinn were derailed by the delay -- even though
they had changed on the train, and hurried by taxi from the station.
The pair were due to compete in the main event, the 9200-metre
international race. Quinn, searching for race numbers, missed out, while
Murray, despite having had no warm-up, and without any number on his
vest, dashed to the start and finished a creditable thirteenth.
Quinn was allowed to switch to the 3000m event, a race sponsored, to
his ironic amusement, by Intercity East Coast -- the very service which
had delivered them behind schedule.
Edinburgh University's 21-year-old Scottish internationalist, Phil
Mowbray, won the 3000m by a convincing eight seconds from Tony Whiteman.
Quinn finished sixth, just two seconds behind Greenock Glenpark's Alan
Puckrin.
Back in eleventh, in the muddy going, was Steve Cram, and the Scottish
trio claimed the other notable scalps of Matthew Yates, Mark Rowland,
and John Mayock.
The main race was a benefit for Kenyans, Moroccans, and Ethiopians.
Kenya's world 5000m track champion, Ismael Kirui, won by nine seconds,
while Murray, thirteenth, was seventh British finisher.
''With proper preparation, instead of that shambles, I could have done
much better,'' said Murray, ''but it encourages me to think I can win a
place in Britain's world-championship team at the same venue, in March.
I think then it would be wise to arrive the day before.''
Clydesdale's Des Roache, who celebrates his nineteenth birthday on
Thursday, won the under-20 race, over 6000m, by an impressive 11-second
margin.
Paula Radcliffe made an encouraging comeback in the women's
international event. World junior silver medal-winner Rose Cheruiyot
beat European champion Catherina McKiernan by almost half-a-minute, but
Radcliffe was just another four seconds behind, relegating European
3000m track champion Sonia O'Sullivan to fourth.
Quinn, and Shettleston pair Adrian Callan and Graeme Wight, have been
selected by Scotland for the World Cross race in Belfast next weekend.
The women chosen are Sue Ridley (Edinburgh Woollen Mill), Marlene
Gemmell (Strathkelvin Ladies), and Helene Diamantides (Westerlands) who
will be making her international debut at cross-country. Durham results
and Scottish placings:
9600m: 1, I Kirui (Kenya) 30min 03sec; 2, A Pearson (England) 30-12;

THE #4000 which Doug Walker collected for his sprint victory in
Edinburgh's annual new year athletics festival will help fund a campaign
which he hopes will lead to a World Student Games medal this year in
Fukuoka, and a place in Britain's team at the Atlanta Olympics.
The Edinburgh Athletic Club sprinter produced the finest run since
George McNeill's memorable 1970 success when he won the final of the 110
metres from the back mark of 2.25 metres in a time of 11.07sec. He
conceded a metre to runner-up Doug Turner of Cardiff, and won by the
same margin in sub-zero temperatures and with a slight tailwind. Douglas
Donald, from Oakham, the 1991 winner, was third in 11.20.
UK 400m internationalist Mel Neef, from City of Glasgow, made history
as the first woman to reach the final of the big race, finishing seventh
in 11.43. As a consequence, she was unable to defend the one-lap crown
she won last year. That title went to her 34-year-old clubmate, Jane
Low, the Commonwealth Games 400m hurdler.
Low's success was a poignant triumph for her 83-year-old coach, Tom
Williamson, who was ruled out of amateur athletics more than 60 years
ago for participating in pedestrian meetings when the amateur code stood
aloof. At last sense prevails.
Walker, a 21-year-old estate management student at Heriot Watt
University, showed how much he has improved since the Commonwealth Games
where he reached the 200m semis.
Though available at 4-1 before the opening round, before his 10.95
heat, he was subsequently off the board with the bookies, the biggest
certainty in years.
For his coach, Davie Gibson -- who confirmed their school had made
some #3000 in bets -- Walker was his fourth big sprint winner, after Pat
Mulgrew (1974), Doug Burgess ('76), and Tony Foster ('79).
Gibson, chief estimator for the company which laid the Meadowbank
track, must have buried some talisman when the work was done. He has
steered his proteges to 23 wins at this meeting. ''But Walker is the
best I have ever had,'' he said.
AAA bronze medallist Walker said: ''This money will help prevent my
parents funding my athletics, and hopefully help me to the major
championships over the next two years.'' His next outing will be a debut
400m appearance indoors at the East indoor championships later this
month.
John Mackay of Shettleston took the 1600m off the back mark, in a
breathtaking finish, clocking 4-12.86 to continue a family tradition.
His wife's grandfather, Allan Scally of Broomhouse won the Powderhall
10-mile title five times in the twenties and thirties.
Perhaps the most valiant winner of the meeting was Ian Turnbull, who
won the 200m in 20.89. The Hawick hosiery worker, who dislocated a
shoulder just three weeks ago, ran out of his socks, diving at the line,
then sprawling on the track. He dislocating the left shoulder again,
being rushed to hospital, albeit #400 better off.
Meeting promoter Frank Hanlon, however, ended as usual, out of pocket.
Why the City of Edinburgh declines to make this historic event part of
the festive celebrations defies belief. Results:
110m: D Walker (EAC, 2.25m) 11.07; 2, D Turner (Cardiff AC, 3.25)

THE major health risks from atomic-bomb testing to which Scottish
children were exposed in the early 1960s emerge from newly-released
documents, writes Margaret Vaughan.
Radioactive contamination of milk from fall-out was giving serious
cause for concern, according to the official papers which disclose that
three-quarters of the worst-affected areas of Scotland were in Argyll.
Monitoring also revealed high levels of contamination by strontium 90 in
the Outer Isles. Remote areas with high rainfall were worst affected.
The file discloses that, at the end of 1963, inter-departmental
discussions had been held to draw up plans for providing alternative
milk supplies for children in areas of high rainfall. But there were
concerns that this would lead to a public clamour for alternative
supplies for all children.
Then, in February 1964, a memo by a senior civil servant, Miss M K
MacDonald, says: ''We have known for some time that the ARC
(Agricultural Research Council) report to be published at the end of
February would show levels of strontium in milk in certain areas which
would give rise to concern.'' The memo says that it had been hoped that
by the time the report was published, it would be possible to announce
what counter-measures would be taken.
In the event, in spite of prolonged wrangling, the departments
concerned could not agree on how best to proceed. Instead a working
party was set up. However, the public was not to know: ''We propose no
publicity on the setting-up of the working party,'' a civil servant
notes.
The resumption of large-scale nuclear weapons testing by the US and
USSR in 1962 had rekindled fears about the health dangers of radioactive
fall-out. For two years, a medical team at the Royal Hospital for Sick
Children in Glasgow, led by Dr Gavin Arneil, had been monitoring levels
of strontium 90 in human bone.
Dr Arneil, according to the file, had been looking at levels in the
bones of dying infants. More than 100 histories were amassed. Case N690,
one of those screened, was of a baby from an Outer Island with extremely
high levels of strontium 90 in its bones.
Strontium 90 emits radiation for many years. It behaves like calcium
and is absorbed by the bones. It has a half-life of 28 years and is
retained for comparatively long periods in bone. Levels are highest
young children's bones.
Civil servants at the Scottish Office were keen that a proposed pilot
plant to remove strontium 90 from milk supplies should be sited in
Scotland, because it was said 75% of the worst affected areas were in
Argyll.
Yet despite fears about the risks of leukemia and cancer in children
from radioactivity, expressed in medical journals and in the press of
the time, Government medical officers continued to insist that the link
was unproven.

SOLOMON Wariso grabbed a medal double at the Birmingham New Year Games
over the weekend, his first outing since completing a three-month ban
for taking drugs.
The 28-year-old Haringey sprinter, suspended in July after traces of a
banned stimulant were found in tablets he was taking, took the bronze in
the 60m final on Saturday, but he went one better yesterday, finishing
second to clubmate Darren Braithwaite in the 200m.
In the 60m, Wariso clocked 6.72sec. Michael Rosswess, three times
European bronze medallist, won in 6.67, the fastest time in the world
this season.
But at the longer distance, Wariso took silver as Braithwaite set a
personal best and new games record of 20.87sec in an exciting final.
Braithwaite's time put him fifth on the all-time UK indoor list while
Wariso's 20.99sec was also a personal best.
Wariso is hoping to make a rapid return to international competition
in Britain's match against Russia on the same track next month.
Sale's Stephanie Douglas won the women's 60m in 7.40sec, and Midlands
athlete Paula Wilson was just three centimetres short of equalling the
UK pole-vault record held by Kate Staples -- better known as Zodiac of
Gladiators fame -- with a 3.40m clearance.
Gael Davies from Gloucester set a new UK indoor junior record as she
won the Under-17 300m in 40.58.
Grant Graham (Clydesdale), who ran for Britain in last summer's
Under-23 Europa Cup final, finished runner-up in the 1500m, with a time
of 3-50.46. He took up the running with 300m to go but was out-dipped by
Ian Grimes (Midland Counties, 3-50.40). Anglo-Scot Ian Gillespie
(Birchfield) was third in 3-53.80
* SCOTLAND'S Karen Macleod finished eighth in a world class field at
the annual New Year's Eve Sao Silvestre road race in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
She clocked 53min 20sec, just three seconds behind European marathon
champion Manuela Machado for the hilly 15,000m course. The race was won
by Ethiopia's Olympic 10,000m champion, Derartu Tulu, in 51-17.
Macleod, fourth in the Commonwealth marathon, will use her winnings to
build up a war chest to contest the World Championship event in
Gothenburg.
Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won the men's event in 44-11.

THE name of the Forth Road Bridge was settled after a talk at the top
level of Government, it is shown in Scottish Office records for 1964,
writes Christopher Reekie.
As careful preparations were being made for the Queen to open the
bridge on Friday, September 4, Scottish Secretary Michael Noble arranged
to see the Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, to discuss what it
should be called.
The Scottish Development Department liked ''The Queen's Bridge'',
although bridges elsewhere, particularly at Perth and Belfast, had this
title.
A Scottish Office internal note of July 28 says Mr Noble had a brief
word on the subject with Sir Alec that day. The outcome was: ''The Prime
Minister feels -- and the Secretary of State agrees -- that the name
should be left as 'the Forth Road Bridge'.''
* The files will become available for public inspection in the
Scottish Record Office at West Register House, Edinburgh, from
Wednesday, January 4.

SCOTTISH women filled three of the first four places in yesterday's
Morpeth-Newcastle road race, but Lynn Harding, the Sunderland-based
marathon internationalist, was thwarted in her bid for a record
fourth-successive win.
Catherine Mijovic, from Birchfield, finished thirty-fifth overall in
the 14[1/2]-mile event, with 1hr 18min 30sec. Harding was second, in
1-21-23, the same time as Allison Rose (Edinburgh WM) who made her UK
marathon debut at the in Helsinki last year. City of Glasgow veteran
Sandra Branney was fourth in 1-21-35.
Brothers Ian and Mark Hudspith, trained by former five-time winner Jim
Alder, finished together, in 1-8-07, at the head of the men's race.
Commonwealth marathon medallist Mark, a former winner, eased up on the
line to give his brother the verdict. Ken Chapman, of Leslie Deans
Racing Club, took third, in 1-10-31, 19 seconds ahead of Gary Nagle.
Other Scots:
13, M Ferguson (EAC) 1-14-09; 15, J Cooper (Springburn) 1-14-41; 22, C

DESPITE opposition from Civil Service unions and lacklustre support
from the then Paymaster-General, the Scottish Office drew out all the
stops to secure the transfer of the Post Office Savings Bank to Glasgow,
writes James McKillop.
Thirty years on, the arguments used by the then Scottish Secretary,
Michael Noble, to persuade his Cabinet colleagues that Cowglen should
succeed over the Teesside competition for the savings bank make
interesting reading.
Central Scotland since the war had a consistently higher rate of
unemployment than any other comparable region of Great Britain, he said
in a memorandum. Emigration of young people was a critical problem. The
Scottish educational system was still good, but more and more had to
seek employment outside the country.
Writing in 1964, Mr Noble pointed out: ''No unit of Government
administration has been settled in Scotland since the move of about 50
Scottish Office civil servants from London to Edinburgh in 1935.
''A decision in favour of Teesside, following the establishment of the
Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance at Newcastle and the Savings
Certificate Division at Durham, will tend to be regarded as final proof
that these moves stop on the south side of the Border,'' he informed his
colleagues.

GHK 8,
Stewart's Melville FP 62
ON THE face of it, a game to be quickly consigned to the dustbin of
history. GHK had to scrape the barrel to turn out a pack. Stewart's
Melville had their top front five in operation for the first time since
early November. No wonder the referee's watch went fast in the second
half!
Yet the clash may have contained within it an encounter as historic as
that of the young RL Stevenson with Sir Walter Scott. In this case it
was GHK flanker Iain Sinclair, captain of Scotland's under-18s, having
to face -- and even tackle -- his boyhood hero, Finlay Calder.
Sinclair didn't flinch, still beavering away deep into the second half
with his superannuated colleagues bushed. He may lack the physical
presence said these days to be needed for a top flanker but, unlike
clubmate Alan Watt, he isn't going to let anyone else decide where he
will play.
To Stew-Mel's credit, the vast amount of possession they won was
handled crisply throughout. Bill Faulds and Ben Gordon had a field day
at the lineout and Graeme Burns thrived.
Further out, the man of the day was Danny Bull. The left winger was to
touch down four times. His hat trick came within the first four Stew-Mel
tries, at a time when home morale was still firm. The big under-18 cap
is a clever runner, difficult to put down, and delights his mentors by
putting their tips into practice.
With Ally Reeves and Alan Kittle getting in on the scoring, and George
Breckenridge touching down and kicking a penalty for GHK, the visitors
led 31-8 at the break. GHK put the shutters up for 10 minutes at the
restart but when the dam burst, tries by Adrian Huett (two), Kittle,
Bull, and Phil Hodgson, who kicked six conversions, flooded in within 15
minutes.
GHK -- H Bassi; G McLeod, N Barrett, S Little, G Breckenridge; S
Hirini, A Kerr; S Williams, C Docherty, A Stewart, N Adams, S Delbecq, G
Peterson, W Malcolm, I Sinclair. Replacements -- S Inglis for Williams
(58min), A Shields for Peterson (62).
Stewart's Melville FP -- F Pollock; N Penny, L Hamilton, A Huett, D
Bull; P Hodgson, G Burns; R McNulty, A Cadzow, A Kittle, B Gordon, W
Faulds, M Paton, A Reeves, F Calder.
Referee -- J Logan (Marr).

Scottish Schools 17,
Australian Schools 18
DEJA vu. The side in blue have sneaked the lead with just a minute
left on the clock. Then, with literally the last kick of the game, a
majestic penalty goal spears between the uprights and the sweet taste of
victory turns to ashes in Scottish mouths.
The similarity between England's 15-14 victory in last season's
Calcutta Cup encounter and the dying-seconds turnaround in this Bank of
Scotland Schools International was uncanny in the extreme.
For the Auld Enemy read Australian Schools, and for Jon Callard read
Elton Flatley.
Remember the name. That boy Flatley has ice-cold water running in his
veins and obviously possesses the temperament to kick many more sides to
death in the years yet to come.
The young Australians arrived at Murrayfield on the Scottish leg of
their 13-match European tour with their record intact.
They had despatched three out of four sides in Ireland, only a 12-12
draw against Munster spoiling the symmetry.
On Wednesday, against Scottish Schools B, they won by the handsome
margin of 30-3 and had to be considered favourites against the Scottish
first-string on Saturday. The young Scots, though, obviously hadn't read
the script.
For an hour the Scottish Schools were never headed. And neither were
they just haplessly hanging on in there. They were justifiably ahead
11-7 at the interval and, in truth, had the margin been even more
substantial then the youngsters from Oz could not have quibbled.
Only in the final quarter did the Scotland effort begin to fade when
the Australians, with Abbot and Bowman taking control on the touchline,
fought their way back into the game.
There were no ''standouts'' on either side, both teams playing
controlled ''unit'' rugby which provided fine entertainment for the
vociferous Murrayfield support.
Scottish Schools began at a brisk pace, Bulloch and Craig making
dangerous inroads into enemy territory before the St Aloysius' wing
outran his support.
The try was not long in coming, though, and when it did come, in the
third minute, it was a beauty.
Lineout ball from White was spun left across the park. The momentum
was lost momentarily when ruck-ball was slow in coming but then Scottish
Schools utilised the blindside, with Ross and Gladstone both in the
reckoning before Charles Keenan sneaked over in the corner for the try
which was no less than the young Scots deserved.
Twenty minutes later the Scots struck again. A scrummage heel against
the head on the Australian twenty-two let fly-half Gordon Ross take aim
on the uprights and his drop-goal attempt flew sweet and true to give
the Scots an 8-0 lead.
Throughout their tour the Australians have been consistently penalised
for handling on the deck and Saturday was no exception. Danny Mallinson
kicked the first of his three penalty goals after 27 minutes and a
repetition of Scottish Schools' 17-8 victory in Sydney 16 months ago
seemed on the cards.
But, four minutes before the interval, Australia showed that they were
not to be brushed aside so easily. There was, however, an element of
loose Scottish tackling in the lead-up to Mark Stcherbina's try and,
even when Flatley converted to make it 11-7 at the interval, the Scots
knew that they were still in with a better than evens chance of securing
a handsome win.
After the turn-round Mallinson was off target with a penalty attempt
but Flatley pared the Scots' lead to a single point with a successful
penalty kick of his own.
The Scots eased away again with a Mallinson penalty goal after 50
minutes but four minutes later the Australians scored what they thought
had been a try through Manuel Edmonds.
Their celebrations were cut short as Scottish touch-judge Bob Dickson
had flagged for a piece of blatant Australian obstruction on Keenan, a
misdemeanour spotted by almost everyone bar the Irish referee Graham
Crothers.
The Australian youngsters stuck to their guns, though, and as the game
developed they gradually began to achieve the upper hand. On the hour
mark they went ahead for the first time when the Scots simply ran out of
tacklers and Edmonds, who had been earlier denied, went over for a try
at the touchline.
It was 14-15 with just a couple of minutes to go and surely the next
score just had to be the winner. Wrong! Mallinson made it 17-15 with a
35-metre penalty effort and that, as they say, seemed to be that.
But from the restart, and with the seconds counting down to no-side,
Scotland committed the cardinal sin of not grabbing possession and
booting the ball into the top tier of the Murrayfield stadium.
Instead, with 80 minutes showing on the clock, the Scots conceded a
penalty and the final act in the drama was left to young Flatley. The
programme notes declared that, when he isn't playing rugby, he's not
averse to a spot of surfing. But no beach-bum he.
It was a 45-metre kick and certainly no gimme. The proverbial pin
could be heard to drop as Flatley lined up the match-winning kick. It
sped straight and true between the sticks and before the ball had even
come back to earth Mr Crothers' whistle had sounded for no-side.
Antipodean joy and Scottish despair.
For 79 minutes and 59 seconds it had seemed as if a side wearing blue
might actually have won in the new Murrayfield.
Sadly, though, we are still waiting.

Melrose 70, Langholm 0
ANYONE popping into the Greenyards on Saturday afternoon could have
been excused for thinking that a seven-a-side tie was in progress,
because much of the Melrose pattern in running in 12 tries against
plucky Langholm bore the hallmark of the short game, with sweeping
handling, adventurous counterattack, and occasional sleight of hand.
Gary Parker had a field day with three tries that had elements of
cheeky deception (he might have had six) and five conversions. He thus
became only the second Melrose player to top 1000 first XV points, with
1020 -- including 64 tries in 92 club games for an average of 11. He is
now just 61 points short of David Chisholm's club record of 1081, which
included 52 drop goals.
The tall Melrose legions gorged themselves on lineout ball, Euan
Simpson notably successful. The first of Doddie Weir's two tries was a
scrummage pushover in which his ball-control was exemplary, Derek Lunn
and Scott Aitken made numerous standing-off drives, and Stephen Scott
popped up all over the place for vital contributions to six of the
tries.
Craig Chalmers rang the changes as well as scoring an individualist
set-piece try and there were a number of thrilling, weaving
counterattacks by Derek Bain and Craig Joiner, the international wing
operating for 55 minutes as a creative centre. There was also a
typically effervescent display by Bryan Redpath for his three tries.
In essentially a damage-limitation exercise, Langholm's scrummage
never capitulated but they were desperately short of a platform
elsewhere, which thus limited them to just three near scores.
Otherwise it was a case of all hands to Langholm's defence pumps, to
which the entire side responded bravely.
The other Melrose tries were by Purves, Robbie Brown, and Ian McCall.
Melrose -- D C Bain; C A Joiner, T Herring, A A Purves, G A Parker; C
M Chalmers, B W Redpath; I W Cornwall, S Scott, D Lunn, R R Brown, E M
Simpson, A J Kerr, G W Weir, S A Aitken. Replacement -- I McCall for
Herring (25 minutes).
Langholm -- D Patterson; D Johnstone, A Beattie, B Middleton, N
Basnett; B Little, R Johnstone; E Beattie, I Scott, S Mabon, D McVittie,
K Donaldson, C Cottrill, G Brannan, C Imrie. Replacement -- C Grant for
Mabon (69).
Referee -- A N Lyall (Gala Star).

DERRICK Grant -- former coach of Scotland's XV, now manager of the
nation's under-21 team -- and his fellow selectors had plenty of food
for thought after the age group's trial on a Murrayfield back pitch on
Saturday. The contest spawned no fewer than 11 tries in the Reds' 45-22
victory over the Blues.
It was more like a holiday runabout than the nitty-gritty of competing
for international places. No-one tried for a penalty goal, and only
Colin Morley attempted a drop kick at the posts: Graham Dall blocked
that, as if reminding all around that the occasion's emphasis was to
score tries.
None was better than the Reds' last. It was born in their own
twenty-two with Ross Brown's interception before Paul Jennings, Bryan
Easson, Dave Clark, Dall, Iain Leighton, and Stuart Grimes carried on in
an exhilarating full-length thrust for Allan Featherstone to finish off.
Easson kicked the goal for a 45-12 lead and a personal haul of 15 points
from a try and five conversions.
Whatever Grant and his selection team make of the afternoon's fare,
they have not left themselves too long to digest it after the New Year
festivities. They meet on Wednesday to choose the team for their
season's first international, the Myreside match against Ireland on
February 3.
As they look back on the happy trial, they will still have one
conundrum to solve. Why was it that the match did not reflect
Edinburgh's all-conquering sweep through the under-21 district
championship in the past two months? The defeated Blues had eight
players who played for the champions whereas the winning Reds had only
four, all forwards -- Dall, Dave Clark, Jennings, and Dave Cunningham.
Clark led by example and efficiency. He and Dall formed a productive
back-row liaison with Stuart Grimes, Jennings and Grimes dominated the
lineout, especially in the first half, and Jennings also scored two of
the four tries that put the Reds 24-0 ahead at the interval.
Grimes, who played in the trial only as a late replacement, was an
unqualified success as a flanker of all-round potential, busy in
chasing, chopping, and supporting. No-one, though, could surpass Dall
for leech-like attention to the ball-carrier.
Featherstone exploited possession of quality and quantity, Easson
displayed admirable control as well as making an incisive break for his
try, and Matt McGrandles continued to add to his credits. Not the least
of the Stirling centre's contributions was the tackle to explode the
ball from Morley before Brown arced across the field to link with
Leighton, allowing the the full back to send Colin MacRobert away for
his second try.
Jennings' tries opened and closed the first half's scoring. For the
first he was driven over by his fellow forwards from his own lineout
take more than 10 metres out, and his second completed lead-up by
Featherstone, Grimes, Brown, and McGrandles. Between those scores,
Cunningham went in from Featherstone's quickly tapped penalty after
Leighton, Dall, and Clark had paved the way, and MacRobert had his first
from McGrandles' kick ahead.
It was Grant's disappointment that the Blues had not won more ball to
make a game of it in the first half, but the pattern changed after the
interval. The Blues' forwards stirred themselves into more competitive
activity, and Malcolm Rennie, introduced at half-time, added zest at
scrum half, as he soon proved with a sniping run as the prelude to the
tapped penalty for Rob Hogg's try in 47 minutes.
John Morrison converted, and only four minutes later Hugh Gilmour
intruded off the blind side for Morley to send Chris Dalgleish in. It
was not, however, to signal a Blue comeback. Tries by MacRobert, Easson,
and Featherstone took the Reds 33 points clear after 68 minutes.
Only then did the Blues come again. Rennie's eager break drew out a
saving tackle by Leighton as the preamble to a Morley try and Dalgeish's
second. Peter Flockhart had a hand in both of those, reward at last for
his promptings from full back, even against the tide in the first half.
Blues -- P W B Flockhart (Stewart's Melville FP); H R Gilmour
(Heriot's FP), C Morley (Bath), C Sangster (Stirling), C S Dalgleish
(Gala); J Morrison, D Rogerson (both Currie); M H McCluskie (Edinburgh

IT'S a new year, and it's sunny and full of hope. 1995 -- who the hell
would have believed I'd have made it this far in life without dying?
It's 20 years since I left school, and from the day I was told by my
headmaster in Malaya at the age of 10 that I would play for Scotland,
I've been addicted to the game. Share, with me, a few memories and
thoughts as we snooze in the Fife sunshine.
Rugby has moments no other game can rival. Take Erica Roe, for
example. She ran topless on to Twickenham in 1982.
She was bigger than big Jill from Haddington, larger than long-legged
Linda from Linlithgow, and heavier than Hazel from Harthill.
''Look,'' said English scrum half Steve Smith midway through Bill
Beaumont's half-time talk. ''There's a girl just run on to the pitch
with your behind strapped to her chest.''
Other glorious moments that help me to day-dream are that Gareth
Edwards try in 1972 for the Baa-Baas, the 1990 Grand Slam, the 33-6
stuffing of the English in 1986, the Aussies who rewrote the rules with
the incredible Aboriginal Ellas in their side, big Gav crying on TV, the
Shark -- allegedly -- denting the Calcutta Cup, Welshman Paul Ringer
getting his jotters against the English.
I never held that against Ringer, by the way. I played with him once.
He was a heavy-smoking asthmatic, and it was a major shock that he ever
got there in the first place. And it was the English, so who cares.
Mike Burton, the English prop, getting sent off, too -- he had
probably been caught with a few black-market tickets.
One big skill in rugby is never to let the opposition know what you
are doing. It was only after the 1983 Test series that the All Blacks
told the Lions that they had known from the first game just where the
ball was being thrown at lineouts. If it was going to the front, then
Welsh prop Staff Jones faced the front, same for the middle, and a throw
to the back was preceded by Staff standing out of the lineout staring at
the back. We should have shot him there and then, thinking back.
The thought of being coached by Jim Telfer can still make me jerk
uncontrollably. It's bloody hard to reconcile the almost avuncular
pleasantness of the Director of Rugby with the screaming hab-dab that
took some of us as boys. ''If anyone tackles you, then elbow them on the
ground. Get low.'' He was a second father to us, that man.
Finlay Calder getting the captaincy was good. His first press
conference was better. ''It was a game of two halves,'' said Calder.
''The boys done well, we did it for the boss -- two more points and
we're in Europe.''
Aye, and in all seriousness, and looking forward now, the sooner we
get Finlay Calder, David Sole, and John Jeffrey into coaching the team,
the better. They don't make folk like that all that often, and we need
those three alongside David Johnston guiding our international side.
They've been there, and they've done it all, they have the respect of
all. Perhaps it's too early in the coaching lives of the three forwards
coaches, but it will have to be laid on the line soon that success is
what is needed.
As Jim Telfer said recently, it's not good enough to play for
Scotland, you have to win for Scotland.
Sole and Calder have an arrogance that is tangible. They know what it
is to win for Scotland and if the current crop of players need anything,
it's that self-same badness and ''sod you'' approach that those blokes
have. Am I alone in thinking this?
Look, there's a direct link between good rugby memories and what you
want from the game. Memories are good, but there's no use looking back
without learning.
We have to make sure that we do not spoil the players, we should not
give them the kit, the watches, and the easy cash until they win.
Life's tough, and tough blokes win. Looking back's great, but I tell
you something. I'd rather look forward with hope, knowing the set-up is
right, than look back. Here's to a good Five Nations. Snooze on in the
sun. Time to wake up soon and go for a jog on the beach. Aye, sure.

Opened-up documents on Peter Manual re-open grim memories of the mass
killer who left an ugly scar on Scotland's memory, reports JACK WEBSTER
THE distinguished figure who became a legend of Scottish courtroom
drama straightened himself in familiar posture and recalled with
distaste ''the most evil man I ever knew''. Predictably, he was talking
about mass murderer Peter Manuel, the fiend of Birkenshaw, who
terrorised the Glasgow area in the 1950s with a catalogue of horrendous
slaughter.
And just as predictably, the recollections were those of the great
Laurence Dowdall, now in his 90th year but still possessed of that
shrewd eye, logical brain, and golden tongue which set him apart in an
age when criminal pleading held a special fascination for the general
public.
''Get Dowdall!'' was the cry of anyone in trouble with the law. It was
the cry of Peter Manuel as he faced the Murder Trial of the Century,
brought back into focus this week with the opening up of documents at
the Records Office in Edinburgh.
In all truth, the Manuel case has long been documented in grisly
detail, well-remembered by those who lived through it but emerging no
doubt as a surprise to a generation which scarcely knows his name.
''When Manuel's mother came along and said he wanted me to defend him,
I explained it was out of the question,'' said Laurence Dowdall, who now
lives quietly in a flat on the South Side of Glasgow. ''She was a good
and devout lady but I had to tell her I was liable to be a witness for
the prosecution.''
Indeed, Dowdall was already deeply involved in what would prove to be
the most sensational aspect of the whole case.
Long before the public had even heard the name of Peter Manuel, they
were caught up in another strange tale, concerning a Glasgow business
man, William Watt, who owned the Deanholm Bakeries in the city's London
Road.
In September 1956, Mr Watt left his home at 5 Fennsbank Avenue, High
Burnside, for a fishing holiday at the Cairnbaan Hotel, Lochgilphead,
leaving his invalid wife Marion with their daughter Vivienne and Mrs
Watt's sister, Mrs Margaret Brown.
On the morning of Monday, September 17, the home-help, Mrs Helen
Collison, arrived at the Watt home, surprised to find the back door
locked. Vivienne usually left it open when she went off to Skerry's
College. Mrs Collison peered in at the window and could just see the
figure of the girl still in bed. Rattling at the window brought no
response.
She went round to the front door and was alarmed to find a pane of
glass had been smashed. Just then, postman Peter Collier came whistling
up the path. Cautiously they made their way inside together -- to be
confronted with a house of horrors.
In one room, Mrs Watt and her sister lay dead, shot through the head,
with only a trickle of blood from their nostrils to indicate what had
happened. In the next room daughter Vivienne too had been shot in the
head but was still alive. Before the ambulance arrived, however, she
uttered one last groan and died.
Vivienne's pyjama trousers had been pulled off and her top ripped open
but she had not been sexually molested.
As William Watt was summoned from his fishing holiday and told of the
tragedy, the hunt was under way for the Burnside killer. Ten days later,
the police believed they had their man and arrested him. Sensationally,
William Watt himself was charged with the murders of his wife, daughter,
and sister-in-law.
Discovering that Watt had been unfaithful, the police assumed that he
had tired of his invalid wife. The theory was that he had driven back to
Glasgow from his holiday hotel in the middle of the night, committed the
murders and returned via the Renfrew Ferry and Loch Lomondside before
morning, as if nothing had happened.
To make things worse for Watt, the ferryman identified him as the
driver of a car which had crossed in the middle of the night. He did,
however, insist the car was a Wolsley, whereas Watt's was a Vauxhall.
Now incarcerated in Barlinnie Prison, he issued the familiar call: Get
Dowdall!
''That was how I came to meet him,'' Laurence Dowdall recalled. ''Here
he was in Barlinnie, charged with killing his own family and distraught
at the injustice of it all. So I set about making my own inquiries into
the case against him.
''For a start, I took my Bentley car and timed the alleged journey
from Lochgilphead to see if it would have been possible for him to do
what they said he had done. Yes, it was physically possible.
''Nevertheless, I was soon convinced that Watt had not committed the
murders. When I was at the Cairnbann Hotel, a girl who worked there told
me she had seen Watt's car that morning and it was covered in frost, as
if it had been there all night. The woman at the hotel was a light
sleeper and said she would have been wakened by a car.''
Days after Watt's arrest, another man arrived in Barlinnie to begin a
sentence for housebreaking. His name was Peter Manuel, who was soon
considering an appeal.
Dowdall resumes the story: ''I received a letter from Manuel in
Barlinnie, asking my advice about an appeal. But that wasn't all. He
added: 'I can also tell you that a client of yours who is in here is
innocent.' So I went to Barlinnie and asked Manuel which client he was
talking about.''
''Willie Watt,'' he said.
''How do you know he is innocent?'' asked Dowdall.
''Because I know who did it,'' replied Manuel, who proceeded to repeat
certain things which had already been in the newspapers.
''Can you tell me anything that other people don't know?'' asked
Dowdall.
''Yes,'' said Manuel. ''My informant told me that, having shot the two
women, he struggled with the young girl and had knocked her out when he
heard a stirring from the other bedroom. He went in and found Mrs Brown
still alive so he put another bullet in her.''
''I made inquiries,'' said Dowdall, ''and sure enough, there had been
two bullets found in Mrs Brown. When Manuel also gave me accurate
details of the Watt house and its furniture, I said to him: 'That leads
me to one conclusion -- that you did it.' When he denied it I said: 'Do
you really think an informant would give you such piffling details of
the house as you have given me?'
''Now more and more convinced that Manuel was the murderer, I was in
touch with Alex Brown, Bob Kerr, and Tom Goodall of the CID and said
this man knew more than he was saying.
''They asked if I would be a witness. I was able to tell Watt in
Barlinnie that I believed the real killer was currently in this very
prison.''
Laurence Dowdall convinced the Crown Office there was no case against
Watt and, on December 3, 1956, he was released from Barlinnie after 67
days.
Manuel would remain in jail for another year, during which time
William Watt, anxious to get to the bottom of his family tragedy, was
making his own inquiries around city pubs.
Having already arrested the wrong man, the police were more cautious
in their decisions over Peter Manuel. Though the general public didn't
know his name, he was amassing quite a police record. So who was he?
In a familiar pattern, the Manuel parents had emigrated from
Lanarkshire to the United States in the 1920s and son Peter was born in
Manhattan on March 15, 1927. But they found it tough going in America
and returned to Scotland when he was still a small boy.
Nevertheless he would affect an American accent and in later years
fantasise that he was once a henchman of Al Capone! He was soon building
a criminal life of his own and, by 18, had attacked a woman on the same
footpath where he would commit murder 12 years later.
Without paying too much attention, I had actually seen him during a
visit to Peterhead Prison in 1951, but the main thrust of his crime was
still to come. In 1955, he attacked a woman, and threatened to cut off
her head but didn't rape her. He successfully defended himself to a Not
Proven verdict, which would be a dry-run for things to come.
Manuel, small, stocky, good-looking, was now on the rampage. On
January 2, 1956, eight months before the Watt murders, an East Kilbride
girl, Anne Kneilands, was going home to the Calderwood district after
being stood up on a date. Passing the golf course, she met a stranger
and was found two days later, skull caved in, underwear removed but not
sexually assaulted.
Harry Benson, now a world-famous photographer but then working for the
Hamilton Advertiser, recalls arriving with his camera at the murder spot
and hearing from a local policeman: ''This is the work of Peter
Manuel.''
Manuel was indeed in a squad of Gas Board workers, laying pipes
nearby, who were interviewed by the police. Asked about fresh scratches
on his face, he said they came from a Hogmanay fight. His home at 32
Fourth Avenue, Birkenshaw, near Uddingston, was searched but no evidence
was found and he was freed.
Gaining confidence, he now embarked on a two-year reign of terror.
Having served his latest sentence in Barlinnie, he was released on
November 30, 1957, and within days had gone to seek work in Newcastle.
There he hailed a taxi to take him to Edinburgh and, en route, shot
driver Sydney Dunn in the head and cut his throat. Motive? A mystery.
The underworld already knew him as a boastful, arrogant psychopath who
gained his sexual thrills by terrorising women and who liked to sail
close to the wind, as with his revelations to Laurence Dowdall,
apparently made because he felt William Watt was gaining the ''glory''
which he knew to be his own.
Still anxious to track down his family's killer, Watt now came face to
face with Peter Manuel at an extraordinary confrontation in December
1957, arranged to take place in the cocktail bar of the old Whitehall
Restaurant in Renfield Street, Glasgow.
Laurence Dowdall was the only witness to the meeting, at which Manuel
taunted Watt with details of his wife's bedroom. He said the ''real
murderer'' had intended to break into the neighbouring house of Mr
Valente, who was believed to have #10,000 in a safe.
On the night before, the Valente daughter was seen going into the Watt
house and it had been wrongly assumed that No 5 was Valente's.
(Deanne Valente had indeed gone in to listen to Radio Luxembourg's Top
Twenty with Vivienne Watt. Back in her own house before midnight, she
could still hear Vivienne playing the No 1 in the charts. Ironically, it
was Doris Day singing Whatever Will Be Will Be.)
''During that meeting,'' Laurence Dowdall recalls, ''Watt leaned over
to Manuel and said: 'If I thought you had anything to do with this, I
would strangle you, you little bugger!' He was a big hefty man and could
have done it.
''But Manuel sat up straight and said: 'People don't do that to Peter
Manuel'.''
Taunting again, he produced a picture and asked if they knew who that
was. It was only later that Dowdall realised it was Anne Kneilands from
East Kilbride.
The police had received information that Manuel, ever boastful, had
been in a pub just before the Watt murders, saying he was going to rob a
house where there was money and that he was ready for any obstruction,
winking and tapping at a bulge in his pocket.
They were closing in but the psychopath was now in full flight. On
December 28, 1957, the attractive Isabelle Cooke left her home at 5
Carrick Drive, Mount Vernon, on the edge of Glasgow, to meet her
boyfriend in Uddingston. She didn't get there; nor was there any sign of
a body.
Three days later, on Hogmanay night, lights were showing normally at
the home of civil engineer Peter Smart at 38 Sheepburn Road, Uddingston.
On New Year's morning, his garage doors were open and his car was gone.
But, with the holiday period, it was not until January 6 that the
alarm was raised. Peter Smart and his wife Doris were found dead in bed,
shot at point-blank through the head, Mrs Smart's nightdress ripped
open. In the next bedroom their 11-year-old son Michael also lay dead,
again with a bullet.
The killer had spent some time at the house over New Year, even
returning to feed the cat, it seemed.
Having taken the car, Peter Manuel also had the audacity to give a
lift to a policeman who was about to join the search for Isabelle Cooke.
Dropping him off, he said: ''They are searching in the wrong place.''
The policeman paused to wonder.
Public alarm reached fever pitch. Even the hardened underworld was now
appalled by the callous killer and the police were informed that Manuel
had been spending freely -- and in certain pubs. With some good
detection, they recovered notes which tallied with those Peter Smart had
drawn from his bank at Parkhead.
They swooped on Manuel's house and recovered more notes. When he was
taken in for questioning, he tried to implicate a leading figure of the
Glasgow underworld, Samuel ''Dandy'' McKay, saying he had given him the
notes.
The police called in McKay and asked Manuel to repeat his accusation.
He did -- and a shocked McKay told him he had just made the biggest
mistake of his life and would swing for it.
Dandy McKay knew a lot about Manuel and was prepared to tell the
police about it, complete with dates and times. Manuel began to crack.
The case against him was now complete.
At a dramatic meeting attended by the parents he adored, along with
detectives Brown, Goodall, and McNeill, his mother set the drama in
motion when she said quietly: ''Tell us everything, Peter. Tell the
truth.''
Manuel confessed: ''I've been fighting this for years. I have done
some terrible things.'' So the story spilled out -- how he had killed
Anne Kneilands, the Watts, the Smarts, Isabelle Cooke.
He led the police to Burntbroom Farm, Uddingston, walked around a
ploughed field till he stood on a spot and said: ''I think she is just
about here. I think I'm standing on her.'' The police dug and found the
half-naked body of Isabelle Cooke.
He told of throwing his guns into the River Clyde, near the High
Court, and divers went down and found the Webley revolver which killed
the Watts and the Beretta automatic of the Smarts' killing.
The trial at the High Court in Glasgow began on Monday, May 12, 1958,
Lord Cameron presiding, with a jury of nine men and six women.
Manuel pleaded not guilty to eight capital murders, the taxi-driver's
having taken place in England. It would need only one of these charges
to send him to the gallows. He put up alibis for all except Burnside,
for which he now blamed William Watt.
The courtroom drama heightened when he dismissed his counsel, Harald
Leslie QC (later to be Lord Birsay), and conducted his own case,
bringing forth the judge's comment to the jury that he had done so with
''remarkable skill''.
After 16 days, however, it took the jury just two-and-a-half hours to
find him guilty of seven murders, the Anne Kneilands one lacking
evidence. Lord Cameron pronounced the sentence: ''To suffer death by
hanging.''
Fresh from snapping the Clintons at the weekend, the New York-based
Harry Benson, whose father founded Calderpark Zoo, Uddingston, told me
of how he developed a journalistic rapport with Manuel and visited him
in Barlinnie. On one occasion, Manuel took exception to what a warder
had said and made a leap at him, creating a frightening scene of
violence.
Benson returned to the death cell and found a different man: ''He was
now subdued, saying he knew he was guilty and was resigned to his
fate.''
When his appeal failed, Manuel confessed to three other murders and
the police believed there were still more. He did try to commit suicide
and even to feign madness, which would have been his only hope of
escaping the noose.
Nowadays he would be in Carstairs, aged 67, one of the few survivors
of the drama, along with Laurence Dowdall -- and William Watt who,
contrary to public belief, is still alive in a Fife village, now aged
87.
On Friday, July 11, 1958, hangman Harry Allen appeared at the door of
the Barlinnie cell just before 8am. A priest was saying his last words
and Peter Manuel then went smartly to the scaffold. His hands were tied
behind his back, a white hood placed over his head and the noose fitted
round his neck.
The monster was finally in his trap. At one minute past eight it was
all over.

THE funeral of a Western Isles man, whom hospital staff forgot to
certify dead, finally went ahead on Saturday morning.
Mourners were gathering for the funeral of Ewen Cameron, 53, of Dun
Innes, Great Bernera, at the Church of Scotland on tiny Breaclete last
Friday when an undertaker arrived with a police escort and took the body
away.
Doctors at Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway had failed to issue a
death certificate procurator fiscal Debbie Wilson, ordered the police to
reclaim the body, which was then taken to Inverness for a post mortem.
The remains arrived back on Lewis at 5am on Saturday after the Cal-Mac
ferry Suilven was stormbound for eight hours in Ullapool.
The funeral went ahead at 10.30am, but many mourners had to make a
dash for the final ferries and flights to the mainland before the New
Year holiday.
Mr Duncan Cameron, a 28-year-old oil worker stepson of the dead man,
has demanded an explanation from hospital chiefs, but there was no
comment from Western Isles Hospital yesterday.

<HEADLINE>Bottomley signals prescription charge rise from April</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HEALTH Secretary Virginia Bottomley has signalled that the
prescription charge -- currently #4.75 -- could rise by more than the
rate of inflation from April.
The charge was increased last April by 50p. When Labour left office in
1979 it was only 20p.
Mrs Bottomley is expected to announce the increase at the end of
January as part of a package agreed with Chancellor Clarke at the time
of the Budget.
Asked yesterday to justify the move, which could bring the
prescription charge to #5, Mrs Bottomley said: ''We have fairer
prescription charges than any other country in Europe . . . and in
delivering the results we are delivering, we cannot shy away from
difficult decisions.''
Mrs Bottomley went on to condemn Labour plans to reverse Tory NHS
reforms as ''a tragedy''.
Her attack followed an Opposition pledged to scrap trust hospitals and
GP fundholders, which, she warned, could spell trouble for Mr Blair.
She said:''I think it is a tragedy that I am sure will backfire on the
Labour Party -- that Tony Blair should try to demonstrate his left wing
credentials by making the NHS a pawn in his campaign to appease them.''
However she praised Mr Blair for his ''enlightened attitude'' to
education policy, but challenged him to ''come clean'' over Labour's
health plans and state whether he wanted to turn the clock back to 1948,
when the NHS was created. She also questioned the wisdom of placing
Margaret Beckett in charge of the party's health policy.
''He has chosen a very left wing shadow health secretary who is
committed to Clause 4 and so far he shows no evidence of applying
intellect or judgment to the health service.
''He is simply using it to appease the unreconstructed left wing of
his Party,'' she claimed.
Last week it was reported that Mr Blair wants to sweep away NHS
bureaucracy and save millions of pounds by sacking around 8000 managers.
But, in a New Year message to the country's trust and health authority
chairmen, Mrs Bottomley said: ''The NHS does not need further wholesale
change.
''Our priorities must be to complete the unfinished business of the
reforms and to get on with the task of making the most of the new NHS.
''The potential is there and so too is the spirit to work together to
met the challenges we face.''
But she added she would not put up with trust chiefs who put profits
before patients.
''Those who do not share the values of the health service are not
welcome as either executives or non-executives. I would extend that
statement, however, to those who do not recognise the value of
efficiency, of taking the wider perspective and of playing as members of
the team,'' she said.
She added that the introduction of local performance pay for
consultants, which is being resisted by the profession, was ''an
opportunity for trusts themselves to forge closer links with their
staff''.

AN AYRSHIRE fisherman drowned on Hogmanay, despite heroic efforts by
his cousin, who leapt after him into ferocious seas in darkness miles
off Shetland.
Mr Thomas McLeish, 30, of Vickerton Street, Girvan, fell overboard as
waves buffeted the crab boat Amadeus in gales and snow.
Cousin Robert McCreath, 31, immediately grabbed a lifebelt and jumped
into the sea.
But he was unable to reach his life-long friend, and was then dragged
-- by now unconscious -- back on board by the rest of the shocked crew.
Rescue services later praised his courage in conditions so severe that
a helicopter and lifeboats had to abandon search operations.
But at Mr McCreath's mother's home in Roodlands Road, Girvan, his
brother Campbell -- told of rescue bid, said: ''I don't know what
happened, but it sounds just like the sort of thing I would expect him
to do.''
It is understood the cousins were on the ill-fated trip only by
chance, recruited as relief crew at the eleventh hour because of the
holiday period.
It is also understood that the dead man and his cousin had been
fishermen since leaving school -- and that another member of the family
is due to take over as skipper of the Amadeus later this week.
A Coastguard spokesman said of Mr McCreath, who is married with two
young children and now lives in Cornwall: ''He was five minutes in the
sea and almost died in his attempt to save his colleague. He deserves a
medal. He is a very brave man.''
A Shetland Coastguard rescue helicopter was scrambled and the Aith
lifeboat launched just after 9pm on Hogmanay after Mr McLeish fell from
the Devon-based Amadeus some six miles north of Foulas island, 20 miles
west of Shetland.
The helicopter flew near to limits through 60-knot winds and blizzards
in a fruitless search for Mr McLeish.
After two hours, the helicopter and lifeboat were recalled because of
worsening sea conditions and deteriorating visibility.
An attempt to winch Mr McCreath aboard the helicopter because he was
showing severe signs of hypothermia was also abandoned due to the
extreme weather conditions.
The Amadeus was ''bobbing like a cork'' in the heavy seas, according
to winch operator Kieran Murray.
He added: ''Mr McCreath deserved every effort to be made after his
very valiant attempt to rescue his colleague.''
However, it was agreed the boat would bring him ashore because he had
recovered consciousness and was speaking.
Mr Murray said: ''We understand he ran down the boat, grabbed a
lifebelt, and jumped over.
''Although he got close to him, the missing fisherman disappeared. The
crew had a job getting him back on board, by which time he was
unconscious.''
The Amadeus, from Teignmouth, berthed at Scalloway harbour just before
2am yesterday.
Mr McCreath was taken to the Gilbert Bain Hospital, Lerwick, where he
is recovering. A relative said he was ''improving,'' and was expected to
be released soon.
Relatives of the dead man were not available for comment.

<TEXT>
THE name of Graham Strachan was synonymous with that of the Clydeside
firm of John Brown Engineering for many years. He was killed yesterday
in an Aviemore hotel fire.
Mr Strachan, who was 64, masterminded JBE's successful transition from
shipbuilding to turbine manufacturing.
As the quietly spoken but highly determined managing director, he also
guided the firm through a profitable period in the 1970s and early '80s
while the parent company, John Brown PLC, was #130m in debt.
JBE was the jewel in the crown, which made his resignation in
September 1983 as MD after a career of 30 years with the company all the
more shocking to the workforce and the business community.
After more than a decade in which the company's record in exports was
acclaimed, Mr Strachan said he wanted to pursue new horizons. Within
months, he was appointed executive director of Scott Lithgow on the
lower Clyde.
He came from a family with long traditions in shipbuilding in both
Scotland and Northern Ireland, and first saw Clydeside in 1935 when his
family moved from Belfast.
His father George was engineering director and later deputy managing
director of John Brown's shipyard.
After graduating from Cambridge in mechanical sciences, Mr Strachan
joined Alexander Stephens of Linthouse as an engineering apprentice in
1950. Two years later, he switched to John Brown and Co Ltd (Clydebank)
to complete his apprenticeship.
After National Service, he returned to John Brown's in 1957 as a
design engineer -- and the relentless drive to the top had begun in
earnest.
He became development engineer in 1959, engineering director in 1963,
and was appointed director and general manager in 1966. He became
managing director in 1968, group managing director in 1975, and was
deputy chairman in 1983.
The services of Mr Strachan, who received the CBE in 1977, also
included leading positions with, among others, British Smelter
Constructions, CJB Offshore Ltd, and Stephens of Linthouse Ltd for many
years.
He perhaps walked tallest during the 11-month international crisis in
1982 over US sanctions against a Russian gas pipeline project that put
JBE's biggest and best contract, worth #104m, in peril.
He was determined to preserve Scotland's leading engineering firm,
regardless of President Reagan's embargo.
That was when his political skills came to the fore -- on both sides
of the Atlantic, after threatening to load turbines for the pipeline on
a Russian freighter.
The crisis also underlined his business acumen. Even before a
face-saving peace formula was devised, Mr Strachan had ensured any gaps
in keeping the shopfloor busy were filled by bringing other customers'
orders forward.
A former executive committee member of the Scottish Engineering
Employers' Association, his current positions included chairmanship of
the Scottish Council Foundation and vice-presidency of the Scottish
Council (Development and Industry). He was also a director of Glasgow
Chamber of Commerce, a post held since 1978.
Mr Strachan was a former member of the Court of Strathclyde
University. His favourite recreations were skiing, golf, and jazz. He
also found time to write. Last month, he had a letter published in The
Herald -- about HCI's hospital at Clydebank.
He is survived by his wife, Catherine, who was injured in the fire at
the ski resort. They married in 1960, and have two sons.

ALLIGATORS and adultery appear among the hazards which faced the RAC
last year, according to a log of last year's call-outs.
A patrolman found a live alligator in the back of a broken down car,
then ''beat a snappy retreat'' said the RAC.
In another case a man contacted the RAC's legal department wanting
help to arrange his divorce.
When he was told the RAC was a motoring organisation, the man
explained: ''Well, I did catch my wife committing adultery in the back
of the car.''
In another call-out a patrolman donned rubber gloves to retrieve a
member's car keys from a toilet bowl.
One would-be member sent in a 1969 application form, and was
disappointed to find membership is no longer #3.
RAC spokesman Peter Brill said: ''We never cease to be amazed at the
things we are asked to do.''
In two separate incidents, a patrolman was called out to remove a
squirrel's nest from a car engine, and another went to the aid of a
woman who found a snake in her car.
The fishiest call came from a motorist who wanted a suspicious parcel
checked out. The parcel, which had been taped to the car's radiator,
turned out to be a packet of kippers.

THIRTEEN drivers failed the breathalyser on Hogmanay in Strathclyde.
The day's total is more than treble last year's when only four motorists
gave a positive reading.
Nearly 600 motorists in Strathclyde were breathalysed by police
between 7am on December 31 and 7am on January 1 -- 557 drivers tested
negative, while two refused the test. This compares with 385 negatives
and one refusal last year.
The rise happened despite a hard-hitting campaign by the Association
of Chief Police Officers.
Strathclyde assistant chief constable Ian MacKinnon said: ''It is
disappointing that despite this very high profile campaign . . . a small
number of motorists are continuing to drink and drive.''
The figures follow reports that a hardcore of motorists continue to
flout the law despite life bans and prison sentences.
One Grampian man with nine previous convictions again failed the
breathalyser test last week. Three other drivers tested positive in
Strathclyde each had five previous convictions.
Of the 959 people who failed the breath test in Scotland over the past
month about 100 had a previous conviction.
Meanwhile, the Hogmanay figures for Scotland as a whole also show a
rise in the number of motorists failing the breath-test.
Some 29 motorists gave positive readings out of a total number of 1335
who were stopped. This compares with 28 positives out of 1433 tests last
year.

THE chairman of an Argyll area tourist board has been ousted by a
directors' meeting.
Mr Douglas Campbell -- chairman of the recently merged Bute and Cowal
Tourist Board -- has been replaced as chairman by Mr Robert Dodds, owner
of Hafton House Hotel in Dunoon.
Insiders claimed that Mr Campbell had been to meetings of the new,
larger area tourist board, covering Argyll, the Trossachs, Loch Lomond,
Stirling, and Clackmannan, which is due to take over the
responsibilities of the four existing area boards in 1996.
Mr Campbell, a businessman from Lochgoilhead, is said to have failed
to inform board members of the meetings. The board says he will now be
left off any new committees.
Mr Dodds said that his first job would be to try to re-recruit members
of the Dunoon and Cowal Hotel and Guesthouse Association and the Isle of
Bute Hoteliers Association to the area tourist board: ''I want to see a
fresh start. We cannot go forward to amalgamate with the other four area
tourist boards divided as we are,'' he said.
Following the merger of the Bute and Cowal boards more than 18 months
ago, members called on Mr Campbell to resign after it was discovered
that he used membership monies to pay more than #10,000 in legal fees in
the board's battle against its own members.
Mr Campbell admitted using members' annual subscriptions to pay the
legal costs. Hoteliers and guesthouse owners called for an investigation
but this was not granted.
The row and continued acrimony followed a protracted legal battle over
control of the two unitary tourist authorities.
More than 60 Cowal and Bute hoteliers besieged the tourist office in
Dunoon but were barred from the inaugural meeting of the board.
The Isle of Bute Hoteliers Association broke away and began putting
out its own tourist information after three members were removed from
the tourist board. Guesthouse and hotel owners in Dunoon also formed a
breakaway marketing group.
Mr Campbell said he had no regrets about his actions and intends to
remain deeply involved in tourism in Bute and Cowal.
''As far as I am concerned, I am still the delegate to the committee
which is forming the new, larger tourist authority. I was the one who
stuck out like a sore thumb in support of this new board and fell foul
with many people as a result. But I have no regrets.
''I have tourism very much at heart as much of my business commitments
are in this industry. Not being the chairman of the Bute and Cowal
Tourist Board is not a worry, it just means that is one less job I have
to do.''

SENIOR Government ministers and Scotland's top law officers feared
they would be forced to cancel the execution of murderer Peter Manuel.
Secret papers, released yesterday, reveal that doubts about the sanity
of Scotland's most notorious killer induced alarm at the highest levels
of Government in 1958.
Fearful of public criticism if Manuel were reprieved, the Secretary of
State for Scotland and the Lord Advocate made plans to brief a sheriff
and invoke a disused legal power to have Manuel certified.
Manuel was convicted on May 29 1958 of seven murders. On June 20,
before his appeal, he began manifesting signs of madness which the
authorities believed were feigned.
With the execution scheduled for Barlinnie prison on July 11, the
documents reveal, an element of panic appeared to grip senior Government
ministers, law officers and civil servants at the prospect of Manuel
being certified as insane.
One of three psychiatrists who examined Manuel before the trial had
described him as having ''psycopathic'' tendencies. A Royal Commission
into the death penalty had advised that courts should take more account
of psychopathic behaviour when considering execution.
The documents, released 20 years early under the open-government
initiative, say the Home Office and the Lord Advocate were awaiting the
outcome of further medical reports.
The Lord Advocate wanted to use section 89 of a 1857 Act by which a
sheriff would certify Manuel as insane. It was thought this might
forestall public criticism.
The medical notes reveal that four days before his appeal was to be
heard, shortly before a meeting with his solicitor, Manuel was found on
his prison bed frothing at the mouth. His stomach was pumped but nothing
was found to explain it. Manuel refused to answer or communicate with
anyone.
Two medical commissioners who tried to interview him reported that he
was faking madness: ''We consider that the symptoms he is at present
displaying are consciously motivated.''
Manuel's sister was a psychiatric nurse and it was suspected that he
had gained knowledge of insanity from her.
The file describes how, in medical examinations, Manuel sat huddled in
a chair, grimacing, pouting his lips, shrugging his shoulders, clutching
his stomach and moving his head from side to side.
The final medical report concludes that Manuel was well aware of the
possibilities of being insane. It was well within his capacity to
produce ''a convincing and suitable display of symptoms of mental
disorder'' if it was of use to him.
The documents reveal that a last minute plea by Manuel's mother to
have her son examined by an independent psychiatrist was rejected by the
Scottish Office.
When she visited him and could get no reponse, she had slapped his
faced and pulled his hair saying ''he couldn't fool her''.
On his last night alive, Manuel wrote notes to his parents asking them
to get their MP to make a final attempt to halt the execution. He
claimed he had emerged from a blackout and could remember nothing since
June, when he alleged, he had been assulted by a prison officer. His
appeal would have been carried out while he was in this state, and so
could not stand.
By the morning of his execution, Manuel's manifestations of madness
had disappeared. After hearing Mass, he took breakfast and before being
hanged asked the governor to thank staff for their kindness.

A GUARANTEED National Lottery jackpot prize of #10 million is to be
offered on an ''occasional'' basis, organisers Camelot announced
yesterday.
The first #10 million National Lottery Super Draw will be made next
Saturday and will be broadcast live from Portsmouth.
The Super Draw announcement comes after Camelot revealed that one
person had won #6.5 million in the last jackpot prize of 1994.
The winning numbers in the New Year's Eve draw were 17, 44, 36, 32, 9
and 42, with the bonus ball of 16. The jackpot was #6,554,085.
There were also six match five plus bonus winners who each pick up
#336,106. In total, more than 1.2 million punters were in the money
after the draw.
Camelot is committed each year to paying a certain percentage of sales
in prizes.
A reserve is kept for special additional prizes, and currently this
accounts for about 1% of sales to date -- around #3 million after the
first six weeks of draws.
Exactly how and when the money is used is for Camelot to decide, but a
spokesman said it would be ''an occasional one-off''.
Camelot said the #10 million was derived from the jackpot prize
determined by ticket sales, plus a top-up from the reserve.
If the #10 million is not won, only the jackpot from ticket sales will
be rolled over.

ONE of Scotland's top industrialists was killed in the hotel fire at
Aviemore which also claimed the life of a woman guest just five hours
into New Year's Day.
Nearly 190 other people, including 32 children, managed to escape in
their nightclothes to safety.
The man who died was Mr Graham Strachan, 63, a director of Scott
Lithgow Ltd, on the lower Clyde, since 1984 -- but best known for his
30-year association with John Brown Engineering in Clydebank where he
began as an apprentice and ended up as managing director.
The dead woman was named as Mrs Patricia Shaw, 55, of Pondfields
Drive, Kippax, Leeds.
Mr Strachan was also chairman of the Scottish Council Foundation,
vice-presidency of the Scottish Council (Development and Industry), and
a directorship of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.
His wife Catherine, 59, was taken from the ski resort to Inverness's
Raigmore Hospital after the fire. Her condition is not thought to be
life threatening.
Mr Strachan, of The Mill House, Milndavie Road, Strathblane, listed
skiing as a recreation in Who's Who.
Mr and Mrs Strachan had gone to Aviemore to bring in the New Year.
Neighbours in Strathblane, on the outskirts of Glasgow, last night
expressed their shock and sorrow at the tragedy.
Mrs Marjorie McNicol, of the Milndavie Farm Riding School, said she
had known the couple, who have two grown-up sons, for the past 12 years.
Mrs McNicol said: ''They are very nice people, although they kept
themselves to themselves. I was very upset to hear the news.''
Another neighbour, Mr Roy Thompson, of Milndavie Road, said: ''It's
quite a shock, I must admit. They were extremely good neighbours. We are
all devastated.''
Mr Peter Mackay, secretary and chief executive of the Scottish Office
Industry Department said last night: ''He was a very straightforward and
public spirited man.
''He certainly made a very significant contribution to Scottish
engineering and also to the wider community in Scotland in both the
public and private sectors. As far as the Government was concerned, he
was always ready to do his bit for the common good.''
Seven had to receive medical attention and one was detained at
Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.
Highland regional councillor for the area, Dr Iain Glen, said last
night: ''There is a great sadness in Aviemore tonight over the two
deaths and nobody would ever understate the tragedy of that. But there
is also a feeling that we have just avoided an absolute nightmare of a
disaster.''
The fire was discovered in the kitchen area of the Stakis-owned Four
Seasons Hotel at 4.55am. The hotel manager, Iraq born Houseman Meshkati,
tried to tackle the blaze himself but had to be dragged back for his own
safety.
The local fire brigade unit was in attendance within minutes but four
other units and six ambulances from Inverness, 32 miles away and
Kingussie and Grantown on Spey, 15 miles away, had to fight their way
through the blizzrds that were sweeping the A9 Perth to Inverness road.
Divisional fire officer Mr John Cheadle said yesterday: ''This fire
was fairly severe, but it was in a limited area used for storage, office
space and kitchen preparation.
''The crews brought it under control but smoke was filling the
corridors and staircases. Most of the guests had been evacuated but
quite a few were still in their rooms and were shouting down from their
windows.
''They were taken to safety by crews wearing breathing apparatus. An
investigation into how the fire started has already begun but there are
no indications as to its cause so far.
''Mrs Shaw died as she was being evacuated down a ladder. Mr Strachan
was found on a staircase directly above where the fire started. It was
particularly difficult because it was a New Year's morning and we didn't
know how many of the 190 guests were in their rooms.
The hotel was filled with skiers and other holidaymakers enjoying a
New Year in the Highlands. One was Mr Robert Broadfoot, 46, a dentist
from Pollokshields in Glasgow who was on a three day break and was
staying in a second floor room. He said that when he heard the alarm go
off he thought it was a false alarm.
''I just presumed somebody had set it off as a carry-on or something,
but I got up and grabbed a few clothes anyway. As soon as I got into the
hall I could smell the smoke and realised there really was a fire.
''Hotel staff were on the scene quickly and they took us out to the
car park. I saw the kitchen was in flames.
''There were folk up on the fourth and fifth floors until quite late
on. They couldn't get out and had to be helped. The conditions were bad
because of the snow and wind. It was difficult for the firemen,'' he
said.
Meanwhile retired driver Mr James Lockie, 73, from Plymouth, praised
the hotel staff and firemen who helped him escape the building when he
began having breathing problems. He had left his sixth floor room with
his wife Sylvia when he began suffering from the smoke.
''The hotel staff appeared and helped me all the way. They did a
really good job. I have breathing problems anyway but the smoke was
making it worse after I had come down a couple of floors,'' he said.
Firemen by carried Mr and Mrs Locke to safety.
Mr Don Lawson, managing director of the Aviemore Mountain Resort, on
whose land the Four Seasons stands, said: ''The local unit was here
within minutes and reinforcements arrived quickly afterwards despite the
terrible blizzard conditions.
''They had the situation quickly under control and there is no doubt
they prevented further deaths as a lot of people were at their bedroom
windows, some up to six floors up. Anyne trying to jump would have been
killed.''
An emergency evacuation centre was set up at the nearby Crofters bar
where the freezing guests were looked after with hot drinks and
blankets.
Mr Karly Turner, area manager for the Stakis Group hotels, meanwhile
said that guests had been taken to the company's other complex in the
area at Coylumbridge. Other hotels were being contacted to see if they
could accommodate them.
Inspector John MacDonald of the Northern Constabulary said a report
would be sent to the Procurator Fiscal in Inverness.

A VACCINE against HIV may be closer today following the discovery that
a number of prostitutes have apparently developed resistance to the
virus.
Scientists from the UK Medical Research Council made the discovery
after subjecting blood samples taken from the women in the Gambia to a
series of laboratory tests.
Although the women persistently tested HIV-negative, the scientists
found evidence -- described as having ''enormous'' potential for vaccine
development -- that they had been exposed to the Aids virus and fought
it off.
This was in the form of CTL -- so-called ''killer'' T-lymphocytes --
which responded in test-tube tests when they were exposed to viral
material from HIV-positive donors.
These are part of the immune system's early warning system which
stimulates the production of antibodies to fight infection. In the case
of HIV, these antibodies are ineffective and serve only to show that the
virus has taken hold.
The research, published yesterday in the inaugural issue of Nature
Medicine, suggests that the killer lymphocytes themselves wiped out the
''invaders''.
But the only parallel to this discovery until now has been the
exposure of babies during childbirth to maternal infection. Doctors in
Edinburgh were among the first to discover that some babies had raised
CTL counts which later disappeared, indicating transient exposure to the
virus.
This has been one of the lines of inquiry scientists have followed in
their quest for a vaccine.
Unlike babies, the Gambian women are likely to have been repeatedly
exposed, in some cases over a period of years.
One theory being considered is that the women were exposed first to
HIV-2, the less virulent of the two broad types of the virus so far
identified and the first to predominate in the Gambia, and that this
primed their immune system to combat later infection by the more
powerful HIV-1.
Exposure to both strains was confirmed in tests. The presence of HIV
itself was ruled out by highly-sensitive polymerase chain-reaction
tests.
The tests failed to produce a CTL response from the three other women
-- due to them escaping exposure by chance or to limitations in the test
-- or from 19 volunteers with no history of exposure.
One of the researchers, Dr Sarah Rowland-Jones, said yesterday: ''This
is an unusual and promising finding.''
The development of a vaccine was still some years ahead, but Dr
Rowland-Jones said: ''We believe that the potential implications for its
development are enormous.''

<HEADLINE>Leaders rule out Labour's VAT plan for school fees</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980566234</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S leadership yesterday dramatically ruled out taxing school
fees in a bid to nip a potential row in the bud.
The party's education team had no sooner confirmed that it was
studying a proposal to put VAT on school fees, when leader Tony Blair
and shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown intervened over their heads to rule
it out.
They acted swiftly to fend off a fresh controversy after Education
Secretary Gillian Shephard attacked the idea as ''taxation on choice''
and accused Labour of the ''politics of envy''.
But Labour confirmed that it was still looking at proposals to end the
charitable status tax break enjoyed by most private schools -- a move
which some schools say will force them to close.
Labour's policy was thrown into confusion after education spokesman
Bryan Davies last night confirmed newspaper stories that the party was
considering VAT on fees.
He said: ''It seems weird that the ordinary taxpayer on limited
resources should be asked to provide a subsidy for private education
which is purchased at great cost by the better off.
''We are looking at the question of removing advantages which private
education enjoys within the tax framework.''
Yesterday Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett also confirmed the
idea was being considered.
''I'm ruling nothing out at this stage because we want to look at the
two issues of charitable status and VAT on private school fees together
so that we can see what would be fairest,'' he said.
But later it became clear that the leadership had suddenly got cold
feet over the issue.
''The shadow chancellor and the leader of the party think it is
helpful to rule out that possibility in order to avoid confusion,'' Mr
Blunkett told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend.
Liberal Democrat education spokesman Don Foster immediately pounced on
signs of trouble in the 'new' Blair-led Labour party which has had a
fairly smooth ride over the past few months.
''Who is in charge of Labour's education policy? Brown, Blair and
others in the shadow cabinet are playing piggy in the middle with David
Blunkett.''
David Woodhead, director of the Independent Schools Information
Service, defended private schools' special status.
''Something like charitable status is designed to extend parental
choice by making independent schools more widely accessible,'' he told
The World This Weekend.
He warned that Labour's proposal would limit access and lead to only
the very rich being able to send their children to private schools.
''It is the independent sector parents that are subsidising the state
sector of education to the tune of #1 billion to #1.5 billion by paying
fees as well as their taxes,'' he said.
Labour is already committed to ending the assisted places scheme which
funds children from less well off backgrounds attending private schools.
Meanwhile, Mrs Shephard is quoted in a newspaper as criticising the
ideas as ''taxation on choice''.
''It shows that Tony Blair's modern Labour party is still motivated by
the politics of envy,'' she said.

BLIZZARDS decided to first-foot parts of Scotland yesterday and
knocked hardest on the door of the North-east.
In Grampian Region, snowploughs and gritters fought a losing battle
throughout the day. All main roads out of Aberdeen were badly affected
and police advised motorists to stay at home.
Two main roads out of the city, the A92 to Stonehaven and the A96 to
Inverness, were blocked. Police had to help drivers whose cars had
become stuck at Portlethen, just south of the city, and on the Aberdeen
to Ellon road, at the Newburgh turn-off.
A total of 40 roads in the region were severely affected and 12 were
closed for most of the day. ''It is slowly grinding to a halt,'' said a
Grampian Police spokesman. ''The snow is blowing in as quickly as the
roads are being opened.''
Last night, police warned that nine roads remained closed because of
drifting snow, another nine were not advisable because of blizzard
conditions, and five were passable only with extreme care.
In Perthshire, four climbers were rescued after they got stuck on Ben
Ledi, near Callander.
A rescue helicopter from the HMS Gannet Royal Navy base at Prestwick
and members of Killin Mountain Rescue Team were called out after the
group became crag-bound.
The four -- all from the Perth area and aged between 14 and 31 -- were
found to be cold but otherwise well.
Other areas hit included parts of the Highlands, where four inches of
snow covered the ground at Aviemore.
A miniature of Drambuie was given to the first 200 skiers to head up
the hills.
Only 350 skiers took to the Cairngorms yesterday, as high winds forced
the closure of the high runs. The lower slopes at Coire Cas did not have
sufficient snow and ticket sales were restricted.
At the Nevis Range ski centre, a spokeswoman they had around 1400
skiers, with 29 of them taking part in the annual 2km run from the lower
station to the top station.
Many areas south of the Border were also hit by blizzards yesterday.
In Kent, two inches of snow fell in one hour and a blanket 30mph speed
limit was placed on all motorways in the county.
Motorists on the M25 and M11 in Essex faced settling snow, while in
Wiltshire traffic was brought to a halt near the Membury services.
After a snow-free Christmas, bookmakers William Hill were preparing to
pay out up to #25,000 to people who guessed there would be snow on New
Year's Day.

THE title of the new head of any Scottish Parliament is a side issue,
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said yesterday. It was much
more important to get the assembly up and running.
Mr Robertson's comments came after reports that Labour was toying with
a number of ideas for Scotland's head of Government, including premier,
chief executive, and provost.
Labour is committed to the setting up of a Scottish Assembly in the
first year of government, and the Prime Minister has made it clear that
he sees the future of the Union as a key electoral card.
Mr Major warned last week against the ''folly'' of tearing up the
British constitution and said the whole country would be infinitely
poorer if Labour's proposals were endorsed by the voters at an election.
''This is one of the most dangerous propositions that has ever been
put before the British nation,'' he said. ''It certainly would need a
referendum if they were going to have it.''
However, Labour leader Tony Blair has made it equally clear that he
sees constitutional change as a crucial battleground and his views were
backed up by Mr Robertson.
He said of Mr Major's comments: ''His central argument appears to be
that the people of Scotland do not want this and that Labour is foisting
this upon them. That is absurd. Around 80% of the people who voted in
the last election in Scotland voted for change.''
Mr Robertson said: ''The title of whoever might head up a Scottish
Parliament is one of a number of issues being considered but it is a
detail and not the most important part of the package.''

REVELLERS received a sobering New Year's present from the Chancellor
today -- new taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and petrol.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's time lag tax increase came into effect at
midnight.
It was the result of his ''killjoy'' mini-Budget introduced hurriedly
in December after Tory backbenchers defeated Government plans to
increase VAT on fuel.
An extra 6p in duties has been put on a packet of 20 cigarettes, 1p on
a litre of petrol, 1p on a pint of beer, 5p on a bottle of wine and 26p
on a bottle of spirits.
In a fresh offensive against the Government's tax record, both Labour
and the Liberal Democrats said the extra duties made a mockery of the
Prime Minister's New Year message pledging tax cuts as soon as it was
prudent.
Labour's Treasury spokesman Alistair Darling said: ''The new Tory
taxes will make a pretty grim new year for the British public.
''No amount of promises or hints that the Government will cut taxation
in the run-up to the election will make up for the fact that people will
be paying more taxes than ever before as a result of the last two
Budgets.''
Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce said: ''The
Government's tax strategy before the next General Election is to cut and
run -- cut tax rates to bribe voters and run for their political
lives.''
John Major has justified the tax rises as necessary to tackle
Britain's high level of borrowing and to keep the economic recovery on
track. He has pledged to cut taxes when it is prudent.
But Mr Bruce warned that taxpayers faced the equivalent of a 2p rise
in income tax in 1995.
Personal taxes were set to go up by almost #4 billion in a legacy from
previous Budgets, he said.
The main increase would be through further reductions in the married
couples' allowance and mortgage interest tax relief, combined with the
higher duties on petrol, alcohol and tobacco.
* Lord Tebbit has made a public gesture of support for the nine Tory
Euro rebels in a move that will only fuel the row raging in party ranks.
The former Cabinet minister and ex-party chairman, who was once
Margaret Thatcher's right-hand man, has offered to visit the
constituencies of the dissident MPs.
Known for his deeply sceptical views on Europe, Lord Tebbit's signal
to the rebels comes despite attempts by the party hierarchy to
cold-shoulder them.

A ROTHESAY newsagent whose dedication to duty on New Year's Day almost
cost him his life faces a ticking off from a very relieved wife on his
release from hospital.
With no island deliveries because ferries were on holiday, 57-year-old
Mr Alex Gibson borrowed a friend's rowing boat and set off early
yesterday morning to make the 600-yard trip across the Kyles of Bute to
collect Sunday newspapers from the mainland.
He got only 30ft out from Rhubodach en route to Colintraive on the
Cowal peninsula when the nine-foot rowing boat capsized in gale-lashed
waters.
A Royal Navy Sea King rescue helicopter based at HMS Gannet,
Prestwick, was scrambled and lifeboats were called out as Clyde
Coastguard co-ordinated a search in Force Seven winds.
However, Mr Gibson's son Paul, 32, who was standing on the shore,
dived into the icy waters and pulled his father to safety.
Mr Gibson, suffering from hypothermia, was then taken to hospital by
his other son, Scott, 30 -- a qualified nurse, on holiday from Canada.
Asked if her husband should have put to sea, Mrs Gibson said she had a
35-year marriage to protect but added ominously: ''Put it this way --
there is no way you can tell a man anything.''
She went on: ''He's a very lucky man. If he had been another few yards
out from shore, I doubt if Paul could have saved him. The wind and the
tide were strong and he was drifting down the Kyles.''
Mrs Gibson then returned to selling newspapers at the Teapot cafe in
Port Bannatyne, so-named because of the couple's collection of old and
unusual teapots. A fishing boat collected the papers after hearing of
the accident.
Paul was not available to tell of his daring rescue; he was at an
undisclosed location for a drink with friends.
Mr Gibson, of Marine Place, Ardbeg, had planned to repeat his Ne'erday
sailing of last year because it proved so popular with customers
normally deprived of a read on January 1.
He too was not available for comment -- perhaps wisely in the
cirumstances. Staff at Rothesay's Victoria Infirmary said he was
sleeping.

THE Gloucester builder Frederick West, who was suspected of killing 12
women and girls, was found hanged in his cell in prison yesterday.
Mr West, who owned the so-called ''house of horrors'' at 25 Cromwell
Street where police unearthed nine corpses, was discovered just before
1pm in his cell in Winson Green Prison in Birmingham. Prison staff tried
to resuscitate him but he was pronounced dead a short while later.
Last night, West Midlands Police said they were looking into the
death. Asked if it was being treated as a suicide, a police spokesman
said: ''Suffice to say at this stage that we have to keep all options
open, though that may be the case at the end of the day.''
Mr West's death throws what would have been one of Britain's biggest
murder trials into chaos and leaves a series of unanswered questions
about the disappearance of a number of girls in the Glasgow area.
It is understood that police have been looking into possible
connections between Mr West and four young women who went missing from
Glasgow. It is thought they were going to have to wait until after Mr
West's trial before taking the case further.
Mr West lived in Glasgow in the 1960s with his first wife, Catherine,
or Rena, Costello. Police diggers uncovered her remains on April 10,
last year, in a field near Kempley in Gloucestershire. The body of their
daughter, Charmaine, 8, was uncovered when police searchers broke
through a concrete kitchen floor at the Wests' first Gloucester home at
25 Midland Road. The body of family friend Anna McFall, 18, from
Glasgow, was the last of the 12 to be discovered, in the Fingerpost
field at Kempley.
Former neighbour John McLachlan, who lived beside the couple in
McLellan Street in Glasgow, said yesterday his sudden death means some
mysteries may never be solved.
''He will take a few secrets with him. I reckon there's a few other
bodies planted somewhere. When he lived up here, he was running about at
2am and 3am with girls. The police said four girls are missing from that
time. Where are they? He was up at his allotment at 1am and 2am. The
allotment is now under the M8.''
According to one expert source, Mr West died during the slackest time
in prison security.
Academic Dr Jim McManus, the Scottish prisons complaints commissioner,
said the lunchtime shift change meant staff were passing information to
each other so could not keep such a close watch.
In addition, staffing levels were probably lower at this holiday
period over Christmas and the New Year.
Dr McManus, on secondment from Dundee University, said Mr West would
have been under close scrutiny because of the charges he faced but would
not necessarily have been under the 15-minute suicide watch regime.
It was impossible to stop someone killing themselves if they were
determined, he added.
A former inmate said Mr West was ''detested'' by the other prisoners
at Winson Green. Mr Stephen Palmer, 25, said yesterday that ''every thug
in the place was dying to get their hands on him''.
Mr Palmer, who saw Mr West every day, said: ''He was watched day and
night by the screws and he wasn't given any space to move.
''Everywhere he went, he was accompanied by two prison guards and he
was never left alone.
''At lights out, his cell was carefully checked and sometimes it was
turned over with a fine-toothed comb.
''He always seemed sort of neutral about everything and he hardly ever
showed any emotion.
''The first time I plucked up courage to speak to him, I asked him how
he was and he just looked up at me at with an icy grin and said, 'Go
away', smiled like a maniac and then continued polishing his boots.''
After the news of Mr West's death broke yesterday, Shadow Home
Secretary Jack Straw demanded a thorough inquiry into the West case and
attacked Home secretary Michael Howard for another prison security
lapse.
''Taken with the ever-growing number of security lapses in the prison
service -- including Whitemoor -- this is further confirmation that
Michael Howard's grip on the prison service is far too weak,'' he said.
''Precisely because of the horrendous nature of the charges brought
against him, the public, and above all the victims' relatives, had a
right to expect that West would be kept securely until his trial.''
The arrest of Mr West triggered one of the biggest police
investigations in modern times. He was detained on February 25 last year
along with his wife Rosemary West by detectives investigating the
disappearance their daughter Heather, who was last seen alive, aged 16,
in 1987.
A day later, police using mini-diggers found Heather's remains buried
under a patio in the small back garden of 25 Cromwell Street. Nine
bodies were eventually discovered at the house. Another was found at Mr
West's old home in Midland Road, Gloucester, and two more were uncovered
in fields at Kempley, on the Gloucestershire border. The huge
investigation put an immense strain on the resources of the
Gloucestershire force. By the time the digging was over in June, the
bill had run into hundreds of thousands of pounds.
Mr West was last seen in public when he appeared before Gloucester
magistrates on December 13, sitting in the dock with Mrs West. The pair
faced nine joint charges of murdering young women. Mr West was also
accused of a further three murders -- his first wife Catherine, their
eight-year-old daughter Charmaine, and Anna McFall. Mrs West was told of
her husband's death yesterday afternoon.
Mr West and his wife never exchanged words and appeared to avoid eye
contact during their regular monthly remand appearance in court. Flanked
by prison staff, they would sit several feet apart in the
wooden-panelled and glass-fronted dock.
Before pre-trial court proceedings in February, Mr West had been due
to make one last brief formal appearance before the magistrates on
January 10, but the full trial on the mass murder allegations had not
been expected until the end of this year.
It was not clear last night whether his dramatic death will now force
a postponement of those proceedings in the case of Mrs West.
Mr West, who passed his 53rd birthday in jail in September, was
regularly brought to Gloucester Magistrates Court, a curly-haired, burly
figure frequently dressed in a navy windcheater. He spoke only to
confirm his identity to the court clerk. He appeared to have lost weight
since his first court appearances.
He was held initially at Gloucester Jail after his arrest following
the ''House of Horror'' investigation last February but was moved to
Winson Green several months ago. He had regular visits from members of
his legal team and some relatives.
Mr McLachlan said at his home in the Milton area of Glasgow that he
had been deeply shocked when he learned of Mr West's death.
''I don't feel any remorse for him,'' he said. ''But I don't feel too
good about what he did today. The man must have had a terrible guilty
conscience.''

A VETERAN driver who took to the wheel when the horse and cart ruled
the road has finally cancelled his car insurance and is taking to
Shanks's pony. Mr Richard Crosby, 91, of Ilkley, Yorkshire, has had 74
accident-free driving years and stayed with the same insurance company.
Now Avon Insurance is presenting Mr Crosby with a commemorative
engraving of a Model T Ford, the car he first insured in 1920. Mr Crosby
said he would be walking in future or using public transport because
''there are too many young fools driving on the roads''.  His tips for
younger drivers wishing to emulate his exemplary record: ''Always keep
your eyes on the road and anticipate trouble ahead.''

EXCLUSIVE
By IAN BRUCE
GOVERNMENT plans to virtually scrap the Defence Ministry's
Glasgow-based equipment quality watchdog department will have
''catastrophic effects'' for British industry and could cost the
taxpayer many times what the Treasury aims to save.
According to a confidential internal Civil Service document,
cost-cutting proposals to axe the Assistant Directorate of
Standardisation and replace it with a smaller ''policy cell'' in Bristol
will also put servicemen's lives at risk by removing vital safeguards on
the reliability and safety of military hardware.
More than 50 senior posts at Glasgow's Kentigern House are to be lost
over the next three years in one of a number of moves aimed at slashing
an annual #750m from the defence budget. The MoD describes it as ''a
down-sizing''.
This follows two Treasury-led economy drives. The first, Options for
Change, has already bitten deeply into the manpower of the armed forces.
The second, Front Line First, targets support services and the civilian
defence sector.
However, civilian defence staff and industrial prime contractors fear
that proposals to allow industry to police its own quality control of
components will lead to falling standards and jeopardise chances of UK
firms competing for international and multi-national contracts.
A major impact will be felt by the defence electronics industry, one
of Scotland's leading employers and exporters. GEC-Marconi and Ferranti,
both based on the east coast, are major producers of defence equipment
such as radars and other aerial and seaborne sensors.
Current parts' management in the field, known as Defcon 17, saves the
MoD about #18m a year. This is now to be cancelled, leading to what
officials fear will be a commercial free-for-all and the possibility of
sub-standard components and counterfeit parts.
Wasteful duplication of effort in research would slice an estimated
further #5m a year from any planned savings.
The internal staff document states: ''Removal of Defcon 17 could
adversely affect the UK's ability to participate in international
collaborative projects. UK component suppliers will be disadvantaged in
international markets because they will have to comply with foreign
parts' management policies which suppprt the indigenous national
industries.''
It adds: ''The latest defence costs study proposals on standardisation
would have a detrimental effect on the fundamentals of procurement. The
use of standards is not a peripheral option. It is central to defence
procurement, permitting effective contract control.
''The erosion of the central use of standards would have a
catastrohpic effect on UK MoD and industry, and in the long term would
cost far more money than it saves.''
The Kentigern House department was brought north to Glasgow in the
1980s as part of the Government's civil service dispersal programme.
A source within the Federation of the Electronics Industry said
yesterday: ''Equipment makers and component manufacturers both want a
common standard of quality-assessed procurement from MoD. About 75 major
companies in Britain currently qualify for the existing
internationally-recognised standard.
''But all of that could be damaged or even wiped out unless the
Government gets its act together.''
Staff unions within the MoD are concerned that the Government's study
of the subject is flawed to the point where it might damage defence
capability and industrial capacity as well as cutting civil service
jobs.
They have called for an urgent appraisal of policy, claiming the
potential effects on safety, efficiency, reliability, and budgets in
other MoD areas have not been properly considered.
A staff union source said yesterday: ''To pin everything on industry's
ability to self-audit its products is a gamble not worth taking.
Industry itself is unhappy with that situation.''

British and Dutch rescuers were put on full alert last night after a
distress call from a British freighter in the North Sea with 46 crew on
board. The Forth Bank reported that her cargo of chemicals had shifted
in high winds and heavy seas in a position 100 miles east of the Humber
Estuary. However, the vessel later contacted the Dutch Rescue
Co-ordination Centre at Ijmuiden and reported that the situation on
board had been stabilised and she no longer required assistance.

BUCKINGHAM Palace yesterday denied reports that the Prince of Wales is
planning to buy a multi-million harbourside home in Sydney. The Sydney
Telegraph, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, claimed the
Prince was interested in a new #51.3m harbourside high-rise development
to be built near the famous harbour bridge where penthouse apartments
are expected to fetch up to #3m.
The Prince's last visit to Australia a year ago was marred by an
incident in which a man near him fired two shots from a starting pistol
soon after the Prince had expressed his ''enormous affection'' for the
country. He attended the famous Geelong Grammar School in Victoria 30
years ago.
