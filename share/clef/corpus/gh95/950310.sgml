DEREK Stark, the Boroughmuir winger, may be one of the first to
benefit from the Scottish Rugby Union's jobs initiative, aimed at
keeping Scotland's top players north of the Border.
Stark, 28, capped four times in 1993 and who scored a try against
Ireland with his first touch of the ball in Test rugby, has signed
provisional forms with the English first division club, West Hartlepool.
The Kilmarnock chef, a likely candidate for the Scotland World Cup
squad, is the latest in a string of leading Scottish players to have
exercised the option of playing rugby in England.
The GHK internationalist lock forward, Shade Munro, and Rowen
Shepherd, of Edinburgh Academicals, also have been linked with West
Hartlepool, where they would join Scottish flanker Rob Wainwright and
replacement scrum half Derrick Patterson.
Gala's Gregor Townsend has already indicated that he has signed forms
with Ian McGeechan's Northampton, while Peter Dods and Chris Dalgliesh,
from the Netherdale club, also have been targeted by wealthy English
clubs.
The potential drain on Scotland's domestic playing resources has so
concerned the SRU that a Murrayfield working party has been established
to examine ways and means of providing worthwhile employment in Scotland
for Scottish players, attracted by the lure of job packages being
offered by clubs south of the Border.
The working party, which comprises SRU president Ken Smith, director
of rugby Jim Telfer, international board representative Freddie McLeod,
and SRU committee man Ken Crichton has met and is due to meet again next
week.
Stark works for the family-run Foxbar Hotel in Kilmarnock which is
soon to be placed on the market, and he is currently seeking alternative
employment. ''I don't want to leave Scotland and I want to continue
playing for Boroughmuir, but I have to think of my future employment
prospects as well.
''I have signed forms with West Hartlepool to keep my options open.
Ideally, I would like to work in Edinburgh and continue to play at
Meggetland, but maybe that won't work out.''
Yesterday the SRU president declared: ''I had heard a suggestion that
Derek was thinking about moving south. He is just the type of player
that we want to keep in Scotland and he is certainly one of those we
will be talking about when we meet next week.''
Smith added: ''If all the players who have signed for English clubs
actually go, the Scottish game would be decimated. What we want to do is
to make the Scottish business community aware of the problem and ask
them if they can do anything to help.
* JOHN Connor, the Stirling Fibre waste-paper re-cycling magnate who
heads a consortium of businessmen who want to buy a Scottish rugby club,
has had three approaches from interested clubs.
''Two second division clubs and one from the fourth division have
expressed interest,'' said Connor. ''They do not want to be named but
they will talk to their committees and then we will take it from
there.''
* THE Division 1 game between West of Scotland and Edinburgh
Academicals, due to have gone ahead at Burnbrae tomorrow, has been
postponed.
Accies have made use of the SRU dispensation ruling for clubs with
players involved in the squad for next Saturday's Twickenham
international.
Jeremy Richardson, who will be on the Scottish bench in London, had
intended playing for Accies but will now be attending Saturday's
Scotland training session at Murrayfield.
* THE SRU have announced that, as from this weekend, league matches
postponed due to bad weather can be played the following day if both
clubs agree.

THE world body of athletics, desperate to beef up the star-starved
World Indoor championships in Barcelona, was struck another blow
yesterday when leading 3000m runner Venuste Niyongabo of Burundi was
deported.
Even more embarrassing than their mishandling of the 60m -- Linford
Christie will not run on a wild card -- was their failure to supply a
promised visa at the airport. Niyongabo was deported to Rome and will
not run.

EXCLUSIVE
ONLY a week after football club chairmen lined up to pour scorn on the
suggestion that a meeting had been organised to discuss league
reconstruction, some of them will rendezvous in Edinburgh this morning,
and although the agenda was not disclosed, it would be naive to believe
those who show up will discussing the weather or the price of team
balls.
Calls were made in the middle of this week, asking chairmen or their
representatives to convene at 11am at Hopetoun House, which is where the
Hearts chairman, Chris Robinson, bases his Wheatsheaf catering offices.
Robinson was one of those who, last week, suggested secret meetings on
reconstruction were not on, and, of course, at that time he was correct,
but many things can change in one short week in football. Perhaps the
game's chairmen believe the issue and its implications should now be
discussed.
There has been talk that some clubs were concerned that Aberdeen, who
are struggling against relegation and not providing great hope of their
survival, could be lost to the top division and that something would
have to be done to rescue them. But reconstruction for that particular
end would be morally wrong and insulting to clubs like Partick Thistle,
Falkirk, and Dundee United, who also are in jeopardy.
It is also the case that many of the larger clubs are not in favour of
changing the system so soon after the current set up of four divisions,
each of 10 clubs, was introduced. Last year, when this structure was
agreed, it was decided to stick with it for at least five years.
There are enough club chairman concerned about the possible adverse
effects on sponsorship income from yet another alteration to cast doubt
on further change.
In fact, I believe that Rangers will not attend today's meeting, and
neither will Celtic.
Without the Old Firm, any moves to enforce change would be doomed to
failure and, in fact, it required only the withdrawal of Celtic's
support from the move to create a Superleague last year to end that
particular drive. The Superleague perished with several chairmen
severely critical of Celtic's behaviour, and one can only wonder what
might be achieved this morning in the absence of the country's two most
powerful clubs.
If change is to be introduced through normal procedure, by having it
placed on the agenda of the Scottish League's annual meeting -- the next
one will be in May -- a two-thirds majority would be required. But if
change is to be pushed through in time for the start of next season, an
extraordinary general meeeting would have to be called. But a 75%
majority of votes cast would then be required, and that would be much
more difficult to achieve.
It is my understanding that one or two others who have been invited
will not attend this morning, which would mean the gathering might even
be meaningless. Then again, perhaps the meeting has been called merely
to allay fears that plans are afoot to change the set-up.
Perhaps Robinson and co will let us know, or maybe they will keep try
to keep their meeting secret.

GEORGE Graham came out fighting yesterday after a Caribbean holiday --
and claimed that actions taken against him amounted to a #1m fine
''without anything proved against me.''
Graham, sacked by Arsenal last month in the wake of the Premier
League's ''bung'' inquiry, was this week charged with misconduct by the
FA. He welcomed that move, in a statement through his solicitors, saying
that a properly constituted inquiry was the only way he could clear his
name.
''The Premier League inquiry was a travesty,'' said Graham. ''They had
already made their minds up and were demanding my dismissal from Arsenal
before the evidence had been presented.
''Acting on the advice of my lawyers, I declined to answer further
questions and so the FA's proceedings will be the first time that my
side of the story will be told.
''I have been given a fine of at least #1m without anything being
proved against me.''

WHEN Celtic played their first match at home under new manager Tommy
Burns, he had the problems, which have beset him throughout the season,
exposed in stark relief. Yesterday, as he prepared for tonight's
Scottish Cup quarter-final clash with Kilmarnock, Burns recalled that
day when he saw for himself the crisis of confidence which has struck so
many of his players.
''We had been in Ireland for three games,'' he recalled, ''and the
lads had looked good. Then we came back to Hampden to play Flamengo and
we drew the curtains back and saw all the problems we had.
''We saw players who were frightened to go out and perform at home.
They were frightened to play in front of their own fans. It has not been
so much the worry of playing at Hampden instead of Parkhead, it has been
this lack of confidence. They had had the worry of not having won a
trophy for five years and some of them have been slaughtered by the
support. But I cannot have players who are afraid to go out in front of
their own fans.
''Look, we are not talking about bad players here. Just because they
have not had success it doesn't follow that they are poor players.
Things have been very difficult here for everyone. I have arrived to
take up five years of frustration -- but I can handle that. The players
have to learn to handle their problems too. It is as simple as that.''
So far it has not been simple. It has been Burns' major problem, and
it has led him to make changes, some dramatic. Club captain Paul McStay
has been dropped this season, John Collins joined him last Sunday, and
Burns has stressed that players must show consistency if they want to
stay in the side.
He added: ''I want the support to get behind the team tomorrow night.
We need that. I know how they are feeling. Remember I am a Celtic fan
myself. I want them to place their trust in me. I will not insult them
by bringing inferior players here. But, right now, I want them to lift
the players. I don't think some fans realise how important they can
be.''
Meanwhile, Burns continues to move unwanted players out of Parkhead.
Paul Byrne has gone to Brighton on a month's loan and Mike Galloway will
stay with Leicester for a further two-month spell. After that it seems
certain the move will become permanent for a fee of around #250,000.

Going places: Stephen Hendry has been in the driving seat, at least in

TITLE holders Oksana Grischuk and Evgeny Platov remained on course to
retain their ice dance crown at the World Figure Skating Championships
in Birmingham yesterday.
The Russians, who defeated Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean last
year, will lead going into today's free dance climax after having won
the original dance section at the NEC.
But Finnish couple Susanna Rahkamo and Petri Kokko, who took the
European title last month when their rivals were absent, could still
snatch gold if they win the free dance.
Rahkamo and Kokko were ranked first in the original dance by the
British judge, but the other eight judges came down in favour of the
Olympic and World champions.
Grischuk and Platov also won the compulsory dances to show they are
determined to win, despite talk of a stormy off-ice relationship and
Platov's reported knee injury which kept them out of the Europeans.
Slough's Michelle Fitzgerald and Vincent Kyle, competing in what is
usually their strongest dance, slipped two places to twenty-first
overall.
Meanwhile, Nicole Bobek -- the American who courts controversy off the
ice just as much as she thrills on it -- returns to centre-stage again
this afternoon when the women's competition gets underway.
But the 17-year-old is not expected to figure among the medals when
the event finishes tomorrow afternoon, even though she will be the
darling of the crowd.
Favourite Surya Bonaly makes her first appearance today hoping to take
the initial step to adding finally the world crown to the five European
titles she has collected.
The ''Black Pearl of France'' as she is known, will never have a
better chance, with last year's winner, Yuka Sato, and Olympic champion
Oksana Baiul both missing after having turned professional.

<HEADLINE>Stirling Tories trim the bill again.  A unique cut as average council taxes rise by 6%</HEADLINE>

TORY councillors in Stirling have repeated their feat of being the
only district in Scotland to achieve a cut in council tax bills.
Their decision to reduce the average Band D level by #3 followed
Central region's freeze on its part of the council tax, and a #1 cut in
water charges. Overall, a Band D household in Stirling will pay #623
next year, down 0.6%.
While only a small decrease, it compares favourably with a national
average rise of more than 6%, and with the increases levied on residents
in neighbouring districts in Central -- Clackmannan (4.8%) and Falkirk
(1.9%).
Last year, Stirling cut #50 from its Band D rate, although that was
partly offset by a #28 increase in the regional elements.
Other Scottish district authorities have managed to reduce their
charges this year, but found increases in the regional and water taxes
have pushed up the overall bill to residents.
Stirling's Tory group leader, Councillor Keith Harding, told
yesterday's council meeting that his budget was realistic and prudent,
and took account of the Conservatives' commitments to reduce council
tax, improve core services, and retain adequate reserves.
It meant, he added, that since taking power from Labour two years ago,
the Tories had cut the tax by 30% in real terms.
''The council is now much leaner, fitter and more efficient, and this
augurs well for staff and their jobs in the difficult period of
reorganisation and the years ahead,'' said Mr Harding.
''We look forward to taking on regional services and their budget,
with all its fat. We will take great pleasure in rendering this down --
slashing the council tax, cutting out bureaucracy, and putting more
monies into front-line services such as schools, police and social
services.''
Before the meeting, council staff hung three black balloons on
railings outside the municipal buildings in protest at the sacking of
three senior staff.
Mr Harding said the redundancies of the marketing director, Mr Paul
Crake; the head of estates services, Mr Steve Smith; and the executive
director of policy and strategic planning, Mr Phil Harding, were
regrettable, but would save #125,000 a year.
A change in council financial strategy had led to a reduction in work,
he said. ''We cannot justify paying for some staff who would not be
fully utilised.''
The council's opposition Labour group declined to produce an
alternative budget after being refused a request for a four-hour
adjournment to study the figures.
Labour leader Councillor Gillie Thomson accused the Tories of
''mortgaging the family silver'' by increasing borrowing to help pay for
the tax reduction.
* SHETLAND councillors also achieved a record yesterday when they set
the lowest tax in Scotland for the third year in a row.
Islanders will have to pay an extra 4% next year, but the #547 figure
for Band D houses is still #15 below the next lowest, set by Kincardine
and Deeside in Grampian.
However, there was little celebration at yesterday's meeting in
Lerwick, which was seen as signalling the end of the 20-year spending
bonanza of Shetland's oil era.
An 8.2% reduction in all council budgets is expected to mean some
redundancies for primary and specialist teachers, ferry passengers
facing big fare rises, and up to 500 job losses among construction
companies, as the council has halved its ambitious building programme.
Council convener Canon Lewis Smith said: ''The blame does not lie with
the council. The blame lies with the Scottish Office and the Treasury.
We have to live within the budget.''
He warned that, if the council did not make economies now, its capital
reserves would be exhausted early in the next century and would then
face cuts ''too horrific to imagine''.
* TAYSIDE councillors last night voted through a 6.8% increase in the
authority's council and water tax levels.
It will mean an extra #35 on bills for Band D households in Angus and
in Perth and Kinross, where district councillors had earlier agreed to
freeze their charges at last year's rate.
However, Dundee residents will have to pay an additional #47, as the
district authority yesterday agreed to levy an increase of #12, or 5.4%.

JUST short of 20 years ago, Joe McBride was the wonderboy of Scottish
football, the teenage winger every club wanted to sign, the young man
who was offered a staggering #8000 signing on fee to join Arsenal.
The money on offer was the talk of Scottish football and his father,
Joe McBride Sr, scorer of so many goals for Celtic and Hibs among
others, guided his son through the negotiations.
Young Joe finally went to Everton. Then to Rotherham, Oldham, Hibs,
Dundee, East Fife, and now he is playing part-time for Albion Rovers,
arguably the worst senior team in Britain.
From someone who made his first-team debut for Everton in a European
clash with Feyenoord, it is quite a comedown now to be picking up #40 a
week plying his trade in front of a few hundred fans.
Yet McBride, now 34, retains his enjoyment of the game which once
promised him so much only to snatch stardom from his grasp. He will not
even blame the sport for the disappointments which dogged him and
brought him to Cliftonhill this season.
''I was silly for myself,'' he said. ''Just a stupid young kid really.
I was in the first-team squad at Everton but I wanted more. I was asking
for a guaranteed first-team place, and when that was not going to be
available I decided that I had to move on.
''That was the decision which damaged my career more than any other.
It was also the one major decision I made without consulting my old man.
If I had spoken to him then, things might have turned out differently.''
It was Emlyn Hughes who talked Joe into joining Rotherham. Hughes was
manager at the time but disastrous results led to relegation for the
Yorkshire team, Hughes was sacked, and McBride on his way to playing for
Joe Royle at Oldham.
''It's difficult to believe now when I'm playing up here in Division 3
the big names who were in the same Everton team as I was,'' he recalled.
''Brian Kidd was there and Bob Latchford. Then there was Asa Hartford
and Colin Todd and Gary Stevens came into the side just around the time
I was leaving.
''I know now that I should have stayed. After that it was all kind of
downhill. Rotherham turned out badly and then after Oldham I came back
home to Hibs.
''For a spell there it was good, but when Alex Miller took over it
became obvious that I was not the kind of player he wanted. So I went to
Dundee, and again things started well but didn't work out.
''After that it was East Fife but the travelling to and from Methil
for training was too much. I more or less walked out on them and it was
Tom Spence who persuaded me to play for Rovers.
''I had played with Tom at East Fife and he was manager at Cliftonhill
so that's how I ended up here. I can get to training in 20 minutes and
that means I can still spend time at home when I finish work instead of
being away in Fife and getting home at all hours.''
Basically McBride plays on because even at 34, and even at the bottom
of Division 3, he still enjoys playing. ''Once I lose the enjoyment
that's when I'll stop,'' he said. ''Whether you believe it or not there
are still good times in the game, still moments when you think to
yourself, that was really good.
''It doesn't matter at what level you are playing you can still find
yourself doing something which might still be a little special.''
Sometimes his dad goes to watch and take reports home for his grand
children, Sean and Joseph, who are six, and Jessica, who is four. Joe Sr
has always been there to run a critical eye over his son.
''He has never been the kind of father who looked on and said his son
was wonderful,'' said McBride Jr. ''He used to tell me that I could do
better. And he wanted me to go south initially because he didn't want me
lumbered with the whole thing of being 'Joe McBride's son,' and he was
right. I never encountered that until I went to Hibs.''
This weekend, though, young Joe's memories will become particularly
bitter-sweet. Tomorrow he will play for Rovers at Ross County -- 24
hours later he will sit in his Bishopbriggs home watching Everton face
Newcastle in the quarter-final of the English Cup.
And 24 hours after that, he will be reporting for work with
Strathclyde Region roads' department with only a few regrets for what
might have been.
After all, he did make the big time and those memories remain.
Amazingly, he collected a signing-on fee from Everton which was six
times as much as his Dad got when he joined Celtic.

THERE is as much room for sentiment in the modern football game as
there is for a right half (remember them?) and perhaps it is no surprise
that the reaction to Aberdeen's plight ranges from indifference to
disguised glee among many neutral fans around the country. That is a
very disappointing and painful reality which the leaders of the club at
Pittodrie have to confront as they attempt to lift their side from
second bottom place in the division.
If the team suffering this indignity was Rangers or Celtic, the glee
would be undisguised, of course, but that reaction would be predictable,
given the wealth and domination these two have enjoyed over the years.
If there is no great gnashing of teeth over Aberdeen's crisis, there
has to be an explanation why this has happened to a club that had many
thousands of sympathisers from the central belt when it was taking on
and beating the Old Firm at their own game during the eighties.
Perhaps it is not too difficult to unearth. Throughout that halcyon
decade the northern team was not only excellent on the park but
dignified and civilised off it. There was an image, however accurate it
may have been, of a family club with a firm commitment to principle and
compassion.
The moment that stance appeared to be abandoned was the day the club
sacked Alex Smith, a decent man and, in retrospect, a pretty good
Aberdeen manager.
There was an inescapable sensation in football's chattering houses
that the dismissal of Smith was the beginning of the end of the Aberdeen
of old, a decision taken on purely business terms and one which has
since proved to have been been misguided. Nothing that was to happen
afterwards, even if the club had gone on to greater success than Smith
achieved (which it has not), could have erased the awareness that an era
had passed. Not only has that turned out to be true on and off the park
but there is a real danger that an alarming destiny awaits the club if
they succumb to relegation for the first time in their history.
Let me divorce myself from the glee club who may be enjoying their
discomfort. No-one should forget the debt we owe to Aberdeen for their
contribution to the Scottish game in the eighties when, along with
Dundee United, they showed that the Old Firm can be challenged
successfully. In fact, under Alex Ferguson they became the best team in
the country and for that, every non-Old Firm fan in Scotland should have
been grateful.
The dominance of either one of the Glasgow clubs can induce apathy in
fans of the other teams, a kind of what's-the-point syndrome, and the
consequence of that is not difficult to envisage.
From a practical aspect, neutrals might ponder the chances of any of
the other struggling sides, however noble their battle against
relegation is being fought, being able to challenge for the championship
one day in the future. If Aberdeen go down to the first division, where
the competition to return is immense, the Scottish game will be very
much the worse off.
The Pittodrie side must tackle a different type of competition from
now until the end of the season, one that requires the ferocity of
commitment that a fight for survival demands. They need a player who,
however well or badly he is playing himself, will metaphorically lift
his mates by their shirt tails and hurl them into the action.
Do they have one such? The caretaker manager, Roy Aitken, ought to
know the answer. If I was in his shoes, I would take them off and put on
my boots at Firhill tomorrow. It is time to blow the bugle, Roy.

SCOTTISH-trained runners should represent good value at the Ayr
two-day meeting which starts today.
Last month local handlers sent out six of the seven winners, when Pit
Pony, from David Robertson's small yard in Kilmarnock, sprang the big
surprise.
At the televised meeting in January, it was five out of seven when Len
Lungo's Sheelin Lad saw off the opposition from south of the Border in
the #12,000 feature novices chase.
At both meetings the going was heavy, stamina playing a crucial part.
It will be the same again over the next two days when conditions will be
extremely testing.
Clerk of the course Sam Morshead expects racing to go ahead on both
days despite the forecast of more rain. ''Safety is the main
consideration and as long as they don't try to go too fast, there should
be no problems,'' he said.
The prospect of heavy ground has kept today's entries low, with only
three runners in the main feature, the #5000 Mad March Hare Handicap
Chase, in which Dawn Goodfellow's Ceilidh Boy takes on course specialist
Cornet and Ninfa.
Lungo has four runners, including Noyan and Oat Couture in the Doon
Handicap Hurdle.
Sheelin Lad returns after his shock defeat by Pit Pony last month,
hoping to win the Hollybush Novices Chase, but is again burdened by top
weight.
Youandi, a recently disappointing beaten favourite at Edinburgh, will
be strongly fancied in the Lagg National Hunt Novices' Hurdle.
Sue Bradburne's Off The Bru returns after an enforced lay-off of 11
months in the Amateur Riders' Handicap Hurdle in a bid to recapture his
confidence.

TOMMY Gilmour has won the purse bidding to stage the final eliminator
for the British featherweight championship between his own boxer, Wilson
Docherty, and former champion Peter Harris, of Wales.
The Glasgow promoter beat off opposition from Wales for the contest,
and it will now go ahead at the St Andrew's Sporting Club in Glasgow on
April 24 -- a huge boost for Docherty, who suffered the biggest
disappointment of his career in January when he lost on points to
Paisley's Michael Deveney for the vacant title.
Now the man from Condorrat, younger brother of British bantamweight
champion Drew, is back on course to make it a family double of
champions, and he has the confidence of knowing he already holds a
decision over the 32-year-old Harris.
That came in August last year when Docherty, making a defence of the
Penta Continental title, beat Harris over 12 rounds in Cardiff in what
was his best performance since turning professional.
If he can do the double over Harris, who has fought such as current
world featherweight champion Steve Robinson and former world champion
Paul Hodkinson, Docherty, will then have a second chance at the title
against either Deveney or England's Jonjo Irwin, the No.1 challenger,
who meet in Doncaster on April 21.
Said Docherty: ''This is just the boost I needed, because I have been
so down since losing to Michael. I thought I won that fight, but there
is no point looking back.
''The best thing I can do is concentrate on the Harris fight, then
make sure I don't slip up when I get another crack at the title.
''I am just very happy that Tommy Gilmour has managed to get this
eliminator for Glasgow, even although I've already beaten Harris on his
home territory.''

AS Portugal's round of the world rally championship reached
two-thirds' distance in Viseu, Colin McRae, driving a Subaru Impreza,
was in third place overall.
McRae, navigated by Glasgow's Derek Ringer, swapped places with
Frenchman Didier Auriol, who overturned his Toyota Celica in yesterday's
thirteenth special stage.
The Lanark driver's normally sharp, competitive edge appears to be
blunted by mechanical problems and self-imposed pressure to ensure he
finishes this rally after having retired on the two previous
championship rounds.
Leading after 21 of the scheduled 31 gravel-track special stages is
last year's winner, Juha Kankkunen, in a Toyota Celica. The Finn,
navigated by Welshman Nicky Grist, regained the advantage from Carlos
Sainz, McRae's Subaru team-mate, and has opened a 22-second gap over the
Spaniard.
On their Portuguese debut, Richard Burns and Perth's Robert Reid,
driving an Impreza, are in eighth place. The event finishes in the
Atlantic resort of Figueira Da Foz this evening. Interim results after
21 of 31 special stages:
1, J Kankkunen/N Grist (Toyota Celica) 3hr 48min.00sec; 2, C Sainz/L
Moya (Subaru Impreza) 3-48.22; 3, C McRae/D Ringer (Subaru Impreza)
3-49.27; 4, D Auriol/B Occelli (Toyota Celica) 3-49.52; 5, A Schwarz/K
Wicha (Toyota Celica) 3-51.03; 6, B Thiry/S Prevot (Ford Escort)
3-54.01.
* THE Jim Clark Trophy has again been awarded to Colin McRae in
recognition of his achievements during last year. The trophy is awarded
annually to the Scottish driver contributing most to the sport.

IT was almost three years ago that the former NFU president John
Cameron received the news that he was to receive #1m in compensation
from Scottish Natural Heritage for not planting a series of six 200-acre
shelter belts on his 22,000-acre Glen Lochay estate near Killin in West
Perthshire.
The judgment by the Lands Tribunal for Scotland was greeted on all
sides with incredulity. But now a more sanguine view is being taken on
all sides -- not least by the original protagonists.
Earlier this week, Mr Cameron played host to an open day at Glen
Lochay which has six Munros in its rugged terrain. More than 250 farmers
and other interested parties arrived to find out how Mr Cameron had
spent some of the compensation money. Most of them left happy with what
they had seen, if perhaps still wondering why there had been such a
fuss.
Mr Cameron has invested #60,000 in a new building to house the 1000
gimmers from his flock of 5000 blackface ewes. They certainly looked
happy and decidedly welfare friendly in their new abode. So too was Mr
Cameron.
''We can get some pretty rough weather up here with an average
rainfall of 107 inches which is 2[1/2] feet more than 30 years ago. Over
the last two or three years we've only been achieving a lambing
percentage of 40 with the gimmers and I just couldn't sleep at night
with that,'' he said.
Mr Cameron demonstrated how he had done his budgeting which showed
that with 90% lambing, the project is viable on a 30-year depreciation
scale. He also put forward another aspect to which there is no straight
financial answer. ''I believe that taking the sheep off the hills for
100 days in winter will ease grazing pressure and be good for the
environment.''
There were, of course, those in the audience who quietly wondered what
had become of the #940,000 balance from the SNH cheque. #40,000 has
already been spent on another building and more than #20,000 on an
imported go-anywhere-in-any-weather tracked vehicle from Canada.
After the proceedings were over, Mr Cameron discussed the details of
the case. He said: ''The award was, in the first instance, #650,000
which was reckoned to be the difference in the value of the property by
not having the trees and their shelter and that which the court felt it
would be worth if my plans had gone ahead.
''The rest was made up by interest charges at a time of very high
rates in the three years it took for the appeal to be heard, plus my not
inconsiderable legal costs.''
Asked whether he would rather have had the trees or the cash, Mr
Cameron responded: ''I'm a traditionalist and on balance I think the
shelter belts would have been better for the glen as a whole helping the
entire flock and the cattle and not forgetting the deer who gain nothing
from the new shed.''
Mr Cameron said that he could have done nothing at Glen Lochay with
the money and instead could have bought a yacht in the West Indies. But
he added: ''That's not for me. I am a farmer and the balance of the
money will come back into agriculture.

SUE Lawrie, the Scotland and Great Britain's goalkeeper who switched
her allegiance at the start of the season from second division Ealing to
Slough, is on the move again, this time to Boroughmuir.
Lawrie's initial transfer proved a disaster, because she was injured
at a Great Britain training camp in August and missed the start of
Slough's campaign. When she was fit again, Sue Knight had taken her
place and performed so well that she was promoted to the England squad.
During her five months at Slough Lawrie started only one league match
and was substitute in two others, including a cup-tie. Yesterday she
admitted: ''In order to continue my international career I had to
move.''
Lawrie will be a tremendous asset to Boroughmuir in their struggle to
avoid relegation. However, she is unlikely to gather any points
tomorrow, when Edinburgh Ladies are their opponents.

MENZIESHILL, Scotland's representatives next season in the European
Men's Indoor Club championship, this week received the welcome news that
they will encounter only one German side in the finals.
Rot Weiss Cologne, the reigning champions, regained their national
title with an 8-7 victory over Havestehuder, with Durkheimer taking
third place following their 14-12 defeat of European outdoor champions
Uhlenhorst in what has gone down as one of the greatest contests ever
seen in the German championship.
Indeed, if the European Hockey Federation continues with its normal
draw procedure Menzieshill, thanks to MIM winning the B Division last
month, will be seeded No.7 and will go into the opposite group from
Cologne along with the national champions of Poland, Czech Republic, and
Spain.

STEVEN Cousins produced the best performance by a British male skater
for 15 years when he finished eighth at the World Figure Skating
Championships in Birmingham last night.
The 22-year-old Deeside skater's hopes of a first major medal were
dashed when he dropped two places in the long programme as Elvis Stojko
of Canada retained his title.
But it was an improvement on his tenth spot in Japan last year -- and
the highest placing by a Briton since his namesake, Robin, won the
silver medal in Dortmund in 1980.
America's Todd Eldredge, who had led after the short programme, had to
settle for second place with Frenchman Philippe Candeloro taking the
bronze medal.
Clive Shorten of Stevenage revelled in the huge British support at the
near capacity 7000 crowd at the NEC also toproduce the best performance
of his career to finish nineteenth.
Cousins -- dressed in a Sgt Pepper's outfit as he skated to a medley
of John Lennon and Paul McCartney tunes -- paid for a fall during one of
his triple jumps as he dropped from his sixth place in the short
programme.
But he will be delighted for Stojko -- the duo train under the same
coach, Doug Leigh, in Canada -- who defied an ankle injury to take the
title for a second time.
Stojko clinched gold with a near-perfect performance -- and indeed one
judge gave him a perfect 6.0 for technical merit. There were also five
5.9s for merit and another four for interpretation.
Cousins, the six-times British champion, was last to skate -- doing
the high fives with Stojko as the 23-year-old Canadian left the ice
knowing the gold medal was his.
But despite the support of the huge home crowd, and another impressive
interpretation of the music, it was not enough to achieve the miracle
Cousins felt he needed to take a medal.

Barcelona,
AILEEN McGillivary used to be a hell-raiser. The fast lady of Scottish
athletics, with more national sprint titles than any other woman, she
also has a record of putting the needle into the red off the track --
not just in her car, but in her social life as well.
Today, however, the multi-titled national sprint champion will channel
her zest for life into what she does best, when she makes her senior
debut for Britain over 60 metres at the World Indoor championships in
Barcelona.
She admits to having paid the penalty for fast driving in her
1.6-litre Escort, and for topping up her personal tank with an
occasional excess of Southern Comfort. ''When I was younger, I was a
nightmare to my coach, Stewart Hogg,'' she confessed. ''We used to fall
out -- but I'm older now, more mature. I know where I am going, and we
get on great.''
More than 15 years of working with footballers at Ibrox, Tannadice
and, whisper it, most recently at Pittodrie, did not necessarily equip
former British professional sprint champion Hogg to deal with a
precocious tearaway with exceptional talent.
For a spell she arranged her own sessions, because the ones which Hogg
had set out interfered with her social life. ''I wanted to be out with
my chums every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night,'' she said. ''I
wanted the best of both worlds. I was awful.''
Hogg discovered she had not trained with the group. ''He hung up the
phone on me,'' said Aileen. ''I called him after nearly a fortnight. I
found out that he was on the brink of writing, advising me to go to
another coach.''
Hogg confided this week that what infuriated him was his certainty
that McGillivary had real ability, but that she was wasting her talent.
In addition to winning the British pro 120-yard title in 1967, Fifer
Hogg also ran second in the Powderhall Sprint, experiences which he put
to good use, helping Tom Boyle build a sprint finish into European 3000m
champion Yvonne Murray.
''I was hard on Aileen because she told me she wanted to be the best
in Britain,'' said Hogg. ''But she did not understand what was required.
She wanted to have her cake and eat it. But once Aileen realised what it
was about, she never made the same mistake twice. She is a very fast
learner.''
McGillivary, 24, admits however that she found it particularly hard to
confess to Hogg that she and boyfried Greg were having a house built,
and planned to set up home. ''But my running has got better and better
since we moved in together.''
Greg, a rugby winger with Cumbernauld, regularly helps out with
training. ''He can beat me out of the blocks -- the first time,'' said
Aileen. ''But once we have done a few reps, he finds it hard to catch
me.''
Some years ago, McGillivary gave up the chance of playing football in
Italy. ''I played with Cumbernauld Cosmos, and was to go for a trial.
I'd to choose between football and athletics. I have no regrets.''
She began athletics life as an 800m runner, coached by her dad,
Harvey. ''I used to jog round, then sprint the last 100m,'' she said.
''When I did take up sprinting, I remember we worked out that I was
seventeenth fastest in the West District over 100m. I thought it was
great.''
Mum Agnes, also a qualified coach, trained Aileen until she won her
first Great Britain vest as a junior over 200m. ''I think she panicked
then,'' said Aileen. ''She worried that if I didn't go it might be her
fault -- that she might not have done me justice. Mum spoke to Hoggy,
and that's how we got together.''
She agrees that she perhaps became too intense, but it did not stop
her winning the Europa Cup sprint for Britain, East Germans et al. ''I
have learned how to relax now, not to take myself so seriously,'' she
said. But her commitment is unquestioned.
The Halifax Building Society in Falkirk, where she works as a customer
service assistant, have given her six months' unpaid leave to pursue her
ambition of a 200m place at the World outdoor championships this year.
Ayrshire building contractor Alex Moir, who has backed her for the past
five years, is making up the lost wages.
Under Hogg's guidance McGillivary has won six Scottish 100m titles,
surpassing Margot Wells' record of five. In nearly eight years with Hogg
she has become faster every season, save last year, when injury struck.
She qualified for the Commonwealth Games in Victoria on the final day,
but then was injured again in Canada. ''I was in a room with five other
competitors. I laughed and joked my way through the Games. But as soon
as my event went on track, I cracked up. I flew home the next day, and
was in tears as I watched the closing ceremony on TV.
''I've had my problems -- had to sleep on the floor for a month, with
back trouble, but the worst was the hamstring, and then the calf last
year.''
Hogg, through his football contacts, arranged two costly magnetic
resonance image scans, which finally identified the problem. David
McLean, the SRU fitness advisor helped put McGillivary back together
again.
''But I could only rebuild my lost confidence myself -- it is a
fragile thing, but paramount in sprinting. I have regained it indoors
this winter.''
Despite being beaten by her pal, Melanie Neef, the first Scot to do so
in five-and-a-half years, McGillivary has run inside her previous best
for 60m four times this winter, and now holds the national record
jointly with Neef at 7.36. That could easily fall today.

INDUSTRIAL conglomerate BTR gave the City a big fright last September
when it reported that first-half margins were under pressure from higher
raw material costs and had dipped from 15.7% to 15.2%.
Later in the year it sought to allay these fears by promising a better
second half but the shares have remained under a cloud.
Yesterday's full-year results, though, should go some way to restore
confidence in the share price and also encouraged an upgrading in
analysts' forecasts for 1995.
Profits for the year emerge up 10.8% from #1274m to #1412m ahead of
tax. At the operating level ahead of disposals and interest they rose
13.6% from #1298m to #1475m on sales of the continuing operations up
12.2% to #9111m.
Margins for the year have been boosted to 16.2% reflecting a
second-half surge to 17.1% and the outlook generally is regarded as
promising.
Shareholders are to receive a better-than-expected 10.2% rise to 13.5p
with a final, up from 7.3p to 8.3p. This is covered 1.8 times by
earnings per share of 24.5p.
BTR chief executive Alan Jackson is able to report that the improving
trends in sales and orders have continued through the last quarter of
1994 and into the early months of 1995. And he reassures the market that
during this period BTR has continued to be successful in mitigating the
impact of the rise in raw material costs by price increases and through
productivity and buying improvements.
Productivity and efficiency savings added some #78m to operating
profit last year. Volumes are also improving.
The better trading conditions which the company has seen in many of
its major markets in the last quarter of 1994 were particularly
noticeable in the US and Australasia. Many of BTR's US-based groups have
experienced buoyant order positions.
Demand in the automotive and construction sectors remained strong in
Australia throughout the year. And despite some commentators' forecasts
for slower growth in the economy later in 1995, progress in most of
BTR's groups in Australia is expected to continue this year. Group
operations in South-east Asia have continued to benefit from
above-average growth rates.
In the UK the picture is more cloudy. Economic growth has been less
marked although most operations in the automotive, industrial
manufacturing and construction sectors have improved on 1993. But
against a background of some political uncertainty and rising interest
rates, together with sluggish order activity in rail and electric power
contract business, patchy growth at home is expected to continue.
In Continental Europe it has been a year of consolidation after the
steep decline into recession in 1993. BTR reckons that decisive
management action has left it well placed to benefit from the gradual
growth anticipated in most major European markets in 1995.
Analysts welcomes the results and also the company's decision to
retreat from issuing warrants after six years. The conversion of
warrants restricts pace of earnings per share growth in the short term.
BTR is looking for a further increase in sales and profits in 1995,
supported by the current improving trend in orders. The company will
continue to focus on improving its results by ongoing attention to cost
control, productivity, seeking profitable growth opportunities to its
existing businesses and, inevitably and fashionably, by searching for
acquisitions which will add to the core businesses.
At 312p, up 4p yesterday, BTR is selling at just under 13 times
historic earnings on a yield of 5.8%, a rating which could now be due
for an upward adjustment.
Mr Jackson retires at the end of the year and is to be succeeded by
the highly-regarded Ian Strachan, formerly deputy chief executive of
mining conglomerate RTZ.

ROLL-Royce propelled profits past #101m in 1994, ahead of City
estimates, as it continued to slash its workforce, figures released
yesterday showed. The aero-engine giant lifted taxable profits from #76m
the previous year.
Restructuring at the company has continued ahead of plan, said
chairman Sir Ralph Robins. He believes the company is in good shape to
cope with poor market conditions in its two main businesses of aerospace
and industrial power.
At the year-end the workforce stood at 41,000, a reduction of 10% in
the year and more than 20% since the programme was announced in 1993.
During the year, Rolls-Royce's job cutting cost #95m in restructuring
charges. Sir Ralph said there were no plans for any further provisions
or major plant closures although the drive for cost reductions and
efficiency gains will continue.
The company's research and development spending is set to fall sharply
because the company has completed development of its new Trent engines
which were principally designed for the new Airbus A330 and Boeing 777
airliners.
Group sales fell to #3200m against #3500m in 1993, reflecting the
anticipated decline in military engine deliveries and reduced level of
business in industrial power. In a highly competitive market, just over
400 civil aero engines were delivered and important contracts were
secured in the industrial power business.
In aerospace, sales declined by 8% and by 13% in the industrial power
group. In the aerospace business, the fall was attributable to the lower
level of activity in the military sector, which had been expected. Sales
were flat in the commercial sector, both for engines and spares.
The chairman said that the 1994 results, despite lower sales,
reflected ''both the greater efficiency arising from our continued
restructuring and the successful development of the Trent 700 and 800
engines which have passed significant milestones in the past year''.
The group's order book stands at #5900m compared with #6200m a year
ago. Its balance sheet is strong with net cash at the year-end of #285m.
Dividends are pegged at 5p, in line with expectations, on earnings of
6.62p against 5.95p. The shares gained 1[1/2]p to 149[1/2]p.
HILLSDOWN Holdings expects 1995 to be as tough as 1994 for the food
industry but hopes that cost savings and small bolt-on acquisitions will
enable profits to continue to advance.
Pre-tax profits rose 6% to #172m in 1994 which encouraged chairman Sir
John Nott to be less defensive than hitherto. The dividend total was
increased from 8.8p to 9.2p with a 7p final. The shares dropped 7p to
173p where they yield 6.6%.
Profits were down sharply in meat and produce but poultry and ambient
salads were well ahead.

<HEADLINE>Bus giant told to sell Mainline stake Government ruling puts the skids on Stagecoach shares</HEADLINE>

SHARES in Stagecoach Holdings hit the skids yesterday, after a
Government competition ruling which analysts believe casts doubt on its
aggressive expansion strategy.
The Department of Trade and Industry took an even tougher line than
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on Stagecoach's acquisition last
summer of 20% of the Mainline Partnership bus group in South Yorkshire.
Corporate Affairs Minister Jonathan Evans ruled that Stagecoach must
sell its entire holding after the MMC said the Perth-based company's
stake might be expected to operate against the public interest.
Stagecoach, the UK's largest bus operator, will also have to give up
its seat on the Mainline board, although it is taking legal opinion and
may seek judicial review.
The MMC had merely proposed a bar on Stagecoach acquiring any more of
the company.
Shares in Stagecoach, whose #8.3m acquisition of a 20% stake in
Glasgow's Strathclyde Buses is currently under investigation by the MMC,
tumbled 28p to 209p.
The MMC is also investigating bus services in the north-east of
England. Operators there have complained about alleged anti-competitive
behaviour by Stagecoach-owned Busways Travel Services.
The Perth-based company's aggressive growth strategy contrasts sharply
with that of one of the sector's few other quoted companies,
Aberdeen-based GRT Bus Group. GRT has expanded more slowly and bought
with cash.
With Stagecoach shares on a relatively high rating, the City is
perhaps now worried there will be an insufficient profits stream from
mainly paper acquisitions to compensate for the resultant dilution of
earnings per share. It may require some convincing by the company.
Bill McCall, a director of stockbroker Tilney &amp; Co, said: ''There are
a couple of other referrals to look at. There is a bit of doubt and the
last thing the market wants is uncertainty.''
However, Brian Souter, executive chairman of Stagecoach, stressed
there would be no change in strategy.
Believing the City's reaction overdone, he added: ''I think it
probably comes from all the nonsense there has been in the last
fortnight from regulators in other industries. I think it results from a
misunderstanding of what happens in the bus industry.''
Earlier investigations have normally ended with Stagecoach giving
assurances about the levels of fares and frequency of services.
The DTI has only twice before issued a divestment ruling. In
Portsmouth, Stagecoach ultimately negotiated partial divestment, while
in Hastings it eventually satisfied the DTI with undertakings.
Reluctant to predict the outcome of the Strathclyde Buses'
investigation, Mr Souter stressed the MMC took each case on its own
merits.
He said the DTI ruling did not stop Stagecoach, whose minority
holdings account for a quarter of its 8400 buses, acquiring companies in
areas where it had no existing presence.
The MMC concluded the relationship between Stagecoach and Mainline was
a significant deterrent to new entrants to the South Yorkshire bus
market, had reduced actual and potential competition between the two
operators, and enhanced Mainline's ability to weaken smaller companies.
It concluded that a merger situation had been created because
Stagecoach had the ability to exercise material influence over
Mainline's policy.

ULSTERMAN Darren Clarke was joint leader after the first round of the
Malaysian Open in Kuala Lumpur -- but missed out on setting a new course
record.
Clarke had opportunities to take the outright lead and break the
Templer Park Country Club course record of 66. However, he missed five
birdie putts in succession from the thirteenth to seventeenth and
finished on five-under-par 67 to share the lead with Canada's Jim
Rutledge. Leading scores:
67 -- J Rutledge (Canada), D Clarke (Ireland).
68 -- L Porter (USA).

<TEXT>
TRAINER David Nicholson has been fined #1500 after having been found
guilty of violent and improper conduct and bringing racing into
disrepute by the Jockey Club.
Five days before the Cheltenham Festival he was convicted of
threatening and using obscene language towards Edward Whitaker, a racing
photographer.
After a long hearing yesterday, Nicholson emerged from the inquiry
claiming to be ''delighted, but not with the fine. I was found not to
have hit Whitaker.''
The trainer was summoned to Portman Square following a fracas that
followed the running of the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing
Day.
He clashed with Whitaker as the photographer attempted to take
pictures of Nicholson consoling his jockey, Adrian Maguire, who had been
unseated from Barton Bank at the last fence.
Whitaker claimed Nicholson had struck him, and at yesterday's hearing
produced a witness.
Nicholson said: ''I didn't hit him and that's been proven. I expect
some apologies from somewhere. It's a stiff fine but nothing a large
brandy wouldn't cure.''
Jenny Pitman was the last trainer to be punished when she was fined
#200 for striking Jamie Osborne in the face at Ayr in 1990.

ALEXANDER Cejka, already being hailed as the next German superstar to
follow Bernhard Langer, equalled the course record with a six-under-par
66 in the first round of the Moroccan Open in Agadir yesterday.
Only last Sunday 24-year-old Cejka gained his first European PGA tour
victory, when he carried off the Andalucia Open title in Spain, and he
is determined to prove it was no fluke.
Yesterday, despite taking pain-killers and medicine to combat water on
the knee, he tamed the King Hassan-owned Royal Golf Links with a round
that included only 26 putts.
Cejka leads Scotland's Sam Torrance by one shot with five other
players, including Irishman Eamonn Darcy and Sheffield's Malcolm
Mackenzie, on 68.
Torrance, who is playing well enough to win a Ryder Cup place for the
eighth successive time this year, set the early pace when he birdied six
holes and had only one bogey for his 67.
''That's as nice as I can play,'' said Torrance. ''I had a long rest
in the winter and it has done me the world of good.''
It looked as if Torrance would lead, but Cejka, starting late from the
tenth, went to the turn in a four-under-par 32 and then birdied the
first and third to go to six under. He parred the last six holes.
On two-under-par 70 were four more Scots -- Gary Orr, Craig Ronald,
Gordon Brand Jr, and Andrew Coltart. Leading scores (British or Irish
unless stated):
66 -- A Cejka (Germany).
67 -- S Torrance.
68 -- A Gillner (Sweden), R Karlsson (Sweden), E Darcy, M Mackenzie, M
Besanceney (Frane).
69 -- P Way, A Bossert (Switzerland), D Carter, P Eales, I Palmer (S
Africa), G Levenson (S Africa), I Pyman, V Fernandez (Argentina), R
Claydon, D R Jones.
70 -- P McGinley, M James, S Richardson, M Jonzon (Sweden), G Orr, H
Clark, C Ronald, J Robinson, G Brand Jr, A Coltart.
Other scores included: 71 -- D Gilford. 72 -- B Gallacher, B
Marchbank. 73 -- M Miller. 75 -- A Hunter, B Barnes. 77 -- S McAllister,
R Drummond. 78 -- D Robertson.
* THE PGA European Tour's Extremadura Open, scheduled to take place at
Badajoz in Spain from March 30 to April 2, has been cancelled because
the organisers can raise only 60% of the #250,000 prize-money.

AND so to Inverness for what, I fear to think, must be my twenty-first
Scottish Labour Party Conference. Particularly in this venue, it is a
chance to meet old friends and re-visit familiar arguments. The nights
will be late and the humour good, but there my predictions end.
The tragedy, which must form the backdrop to everything we say and do,
is that 16 of these years have been spent without a Labour Government.
For those here this weekend under the age of 30, there is no first-hand
recollection that government can be a force for good. It is an article
of faith and common sense.
This is a vacuum which our opponents seek to fill with false history
and doctrines of despair. But the attacks of Toryism and sneers of
nationalism disguise the essential fact of post-war politics -- that
none of them would dare reverse the great social legislation which
Labour alone has given to this country in the teeth of opposition.
Yes, an enormous amount has been eroded since 1979. But the pillars of
decency which Labour put in place -- the NHS, welfare state,
comprehensive education, equal opportunities, and the rights of working
people -- are still just about in place; crying out to be reinforced and
built around.
I sometimes think that a party political broadcast should be devoted
simply to listing the lasting monuments to Labour Governments for the
benefit of a generation which might be deceived into believing that
''they're all the same''. They are not, never were, and never will be.
After 16 years in opposition, there are few in Labour's ranks who have
held ministerial office. I doubt if that is such a bad thing. On so many
fronts, there will be the prospect of radical thinking and a fresh
start. Inadvertently we have skipped a generation. I would hope and
expect that the Labour Government of 96 or 97 is more self-confident and
less in awe of the Sir Humphreys than any that has gone before; that its
determination to achieve will have been sharpened by the long wait.
But first we have to get there and anyone who believes it is in the
bag is suffering from self-delusion. In the months leading up to the
election, the Tories, their press, and their financiers will fight like
cornered vermin.
One need look only at the vast unearned wealth currently slushing
around in the privatised utilities to understand the size of the stakes.
I simply don't believe these stories about the Tories going into an
election under-funded. There are too many vested interests for that to
happen.
The Labour Party has been set a simple test by Tony Blair. It is to
say what we mean and mean what we say. If we can pass that test with the
electorate, we will be unstoppable. But first we have to pass the
internal examination.
There is a large school of thought which maintains that the Clause 4
debate should never have been opened up. Let sleeping albatrosses lie.
That is neither a radical nor particularly honest position, even if it
has a very obvious appeal when we are 20% or 30% ahead in the polls.
I certainly don't expect a watered-down form of words to emerge from
this process. And the ones which are finally approved will have the
force and relevance which comes from being written in 1995 rather than
1917.
A commitment made during the First World War can be dismissed as an
antique, held in affection but not meant to be taken seriously. That is
indeed the story of Clause 4 as it stands, behind the protestations that
it is immortal, timeless, and enshrines everything we hold dear.
It doesn't and never did. But whatever summary of our aims and values
emerges from the current process will be incapable of concealment or
denial, because it will have been newly minted for the express purpose
of defining what we stand for.
We're often told that Clause 4 is never brought up on the doorsteps as
a reason for not voting Labour. True enough. But how often do Labour
Party members feel bold enough to raise it in a positive way, by pulling
out the party card and saying: ''Look! This is what we are about''?
There is no argument for no change, other than that the debate should
not have been opened. And that isn't really an argument at all.
So let's have a good conference, a passionate debate, and a vote which
will take us one step closer to the only function which justifies
political activity for socialists.
And lest we forget, that is the exercise of power in a way which will
advance the interests of the many rather than the few, and bequeath to
our children a better world than the one which we inherited.

<HEADLINE>Rise in cow slaughtering</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>22</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979468467</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DAIRY farmers concerned at the cost of exceeding milk quota limits
have contributed to a sharp rise in cow slaughterings in the final
quarter of 1994. The January total, including adult bulls, was estimated
to have reached 93,000 head, an increase of 40% over the previous
January.
Despite high slaughterings, prices have risen. The grade one average
was 92.4p a kg, an increase of 4p over the same period last year.
The Meat and Livestock Commission expect that the current pressure to
cull cows will ease during the second quarter of this year.
A Likely reduction in the level of slaughterings, combined with
progressively lower availability of manufacturing beef from stocks
across the European Union, should continue to provide strength to the
cull cow trade as the year progresses.

SCOTLAND'S Peter Nicol claimed his place in the semi-finals of the
#30,000 Portuguese Open in Lisbon yesterday without striking a ball when
opponent Anthony Hill was forced to withdrew through illness.
The Australian world No.9, winner of the Stroh Open in Calcutta last
week, had visited hospital with breathing problems following his
second-round win over England's Paul Johnson on Wednesday.
''X-rays showed that I had a lung infection, which I suspect I picked
up in India,'' said the 25-year-old, who had reached the last eight with
two convincing victories.
''I've been put on antibiotics, and it's not worth taking the risk of
playing in what would be sure to be a very hard match against Peter.''
For Nicol, the removal of a potentially punishing clash came as a
great relief. The world No.5 has also suffered health problems with a
bout of tonsilitis in the build-up to this week. He said: ''It's good
for me that I have had an extra day's rest.''
Winner of the US and Singapore Opens this season, 21-year-old Nicol
now meets world No.1 and defending champion, Jansher Khan. He defeated
his unrelated namesake Zarak Jahan Khan.
Nicol's aim tonight will be to repeat his Welsh classic win of 13
months ago against Jansher, although in their most recent meeting the
Pakistani scored an easy win in the final of the Hong Kong Open.
In the other semi, England's World No.2 Peter Marshall meets
Australia's Rodney Eyles, who is just one place lower. Quarter-final
results:
(4) P Nicol (Scotland) beat (7) A Hill (Aus) w/o; (2) P Marshall
(England) beat (9) S Elopuro (Finland) 15-12, 15-10, 15-6; (3) R Eyles
(Australia) beat (5) Simon Parke (England) 15-11, 15-9, 6-0, retired
injured; (1) Jansher Khan (Pakistan) beat (8) Zarak Jahan Khan
(Pakistan) 15-5, 15-5, 15-11.
* NATIONAL League results:
Division 1 -- Glasgow Accies 3 (14), Aberdeen 2 (6); Glasgow Accies 0

<HEADLINE>MLC survey shows upsurge in beef exports to Continent</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>MIKE INGHAM</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>22</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979468469</RECORDNO>

BEEF exports appear to have staged a remarkable recovery from the
severe disruption caused last autumn by German attempts to ban British
supplies and the restrictions imposed under the EU compromise aimed at
settling that dispute.
Latest indications are that sales of British beef into Continental
markets were actually higher in the first few weeks of this year than in
early 1994, although trade with Germany virtually ceased.
Totally reliable figures are not available because a new trade
recording system is not yet fully operational. It replaces customs
statistics which ended with the advent of the single market two years
ago.
However, Meat and Livestock Commission staff now run a regular survey
of trading companies and have calculated that British exporters shipped
nearly 8% more beef to other EU states in January than 12 months
earlier.
German demand evaporated in the light of fears of catching ''mad cow
disease'' but fears that BSE panic might spread across the Continent
have proved groundless. Germany was not a particularly significant
market for the British industry, although a couple of individual
companies will have been badly hurt by the loss of trade.
Much more important for livestock producers in general is France. The
French meat trade, in particular its catering sector, is traditionally
by far the biggest outlet for British beef exporters.
The commodity the French want predominantly is cowbeef, which
indicates why the BSE controversy was potentially so devastating.
The threat was not primarily from consumers terrified by BSE, because
the French are not usually much concerned with such issues. Instead,
exporters fretted over the risk of losing the trade for bone-in cow
carcases and cuts because trade restrictions authorised by the European
Commission, in an attempt to pacify the Germans, discriminated against
these products.
Exporters have overcome the obstacles. The MLC's latest survey shows
that January shipments to France are back up to within about 10% of the
volumes sold a year earlier.
Exporter demand to serve this revived trade probably helps explain the
surprising strength of cow prices in the face of the extremely high
culling rates over recent months.
The most startling aspect of the trade has been demand from the
Italian market, where Inverurie-based ANM Group is particularly active.
Italy's purchases of British beef more than doubled between January 1994
and the first few weeks of this year, according to the MLC's new
figures.

THE presence of so many Europeans in Florida this month has
temporarily made the US Tour seem like the world tour that Greg Norman
once envisaged -- and the Europeans are more than justifying their
places in the Honda Classic field here in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
Nick Faldo, winner last week at Doral, shot a four-under-par 67 to
finish the first round in third place two off of the lead, held by Jim
McGovern, and one behind 1989 Open champion Mark Calcavecchia.
One behind Faldo was Ian Woosnam, while Severiano Ballesteros hit his
only bad shot of the day into water on his last hole. The Spaniard ended
on 70, still a strong score given the strong winds.
The Europeans who played in the afternoon also fared well, with Colin
Montgomerie shooting a 69 that included two chip-ins, one for eagle, the
other time for one of his three birdies. Bernhard Langer, who played
with McGovern, shot 70.
Faldo had four birdies on Weston Hills' front nine, the first time he
had seen that stretch this week. He had planned to play them in the
pro-am, which was cancelled.
He said: ''I played very solidly. It was tough out there and I got off
to a good start. Most of the day I was looking at 25 feet or better on
the greens. The back nine was really tough with the wind. But I only
made one mistake, underclubbing on the thirteenth.''
Woosnam, playing his first competitive round since December, played
his front nine in three under par. He said: ''On the front nine I played
fantastic. I had a putt for birdie on every hole. I couldn't believe
that I hadn't played for three months.'' Leading scores (Americans
unless stated):
65 -- J McGovern.
66 -- M Calcavecchia.
67 -- N Faldo (England), D Barr (Canada).
68 -- I Woosnam (Wales), M Wiebe, M Sullivan, M O'Meara, L Rinker.
69 -- K Clearwater, S Rintoul (Australia), G Sauers, C Montgomerie
(Scotland), B Claar, S Stricker, B Lohr, J Haas, V Singh (Fiji), L
Janzen, A Magee, K Fergus.
Other scores included: 70 -- S Ballesteros (Spain). 71 -- D Feherty (N
Ireland). 72 -- J Parnevik (Sweden).

Ross Finlay marks the big German's progress
THE coffee stop on our first drive of the Audi A4 was at the famous
Prescott Speed Hill Climb Course near Cheltenham. Roy Lane, several
times British hill climb champion, runs a competition driving school
there, and we were invited to chauffeur him up the hill in a much faster
Audi laid on for the occasion -- a Porsche-modified Avant RS2.
Having watched Roy hurtle his almost Formula One-specification
single-seater up climbs like Doune and Fintray, I thought that was an
absolutely ludicrous suggestion. It would have been like going to
Murrayfield and asking Gavin Hastings to watch my pitiful attempts at
kicking a penalty goal. So I insisted that Roy drove me, then sat back
and enjoyed the experience, being amused to see that, turning down the
return road, he slightly muffed a gear change. Ah, I said loftily, Audi
has never built a decent gear change yet.
For a company so intense about its high-tech design work, Audi seems
unable to get away from a rather sloppy gear lever, although the A4's is
better than some. On the other hand, there is nothing remotely sloppy
about the brake pedal action. Look at it sideways and the anchors slam
on. I would prefer a more progressive approach.
If this report so far makes the A4 seem something of a dog, we had
better move on to the good news. It is a far more stylish car than the
Audi 80 it replaces, impeccably built, and a great advance on the
earlier model in terms of engineering, finish, performance and economy.
The A4 has a revised choice of engines, a brand new interior, and
front suspension from the elegant, mostly aluminium A8. It is far more
refined than any model of the 80 series ever managed to be.
On the launch, I tried a 1.6-litre which starts at #14,920, and a 1.8
which starts at #16,745. The basic range includes a turbo diesel, a
1.8-litre turbo sport, and a couple of 2.6-litre V6 variants, topped by
a quattro at #22,845. There are also special equipment models at prices
from #16,450.
The 1.8 is the first car in this class with a five-valve layout --
three inlet and two exhaust per cylinder. Better gas flow is the result,
not so much to increase power output as to enhance the torque and fuel
consumption. The power is there, all the same, because the A4's 125bhp
is 10bhp more than you get from the superseded two-litre Audi 80, and a
high figure for the class. Torque is up too, although I am surprised
that the peak comes at a much higher engine speed than in the older car.
You can expect to whistle the 1.8 to 60mph in about 10.5 seconds, and
it has a test track maximum above 125mph. But Audi makes sturdily built
cars these days and, while the A4 is lighter than the 80, it does not
have an entirely favourable power to weight ratio.
However, there are few complaints about its fuel economy. The Audi
cannot match a lean-burn engine in this department, but it should return
something like 48mpg at 56mph, 37 at 75 and 28mpg in town.
Handling and ride quality are in a completely different league from
the 80's. Like the braking system, the steering is uncommonly light, for
a European car, anyway.

THE Halifax and the Leeds Permanent Building Societies' members could
get around 600 shares each as a basic allocation in addition to perhaps
another 5% arising from balances between #1000 and #50,000.
The two societies are seeking High Court approval on March 20 which
would allow them to be more generous in the extent of their offer in the
proposed merger than Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester which is being taken over
by Lloyds Bank.
Any investor who has at least #100 in share accounts with either
society or is a holder of their permanent interest-bearing securities
will qualify for the basic distribution of a fixed number of free
shares.
In addition, those of two years' standing and with share account
balances of between #1000 and #50,000 will receive a variable
distribution depending on the size of the total balance. But unlike at
C&amp;G where there were legal restraints, borrowers will be entitled to the
fixed amount of shares as long as the loan is in excess of #100.
The court judgment is expected soon after the hearing and is necessary
as there is ambiguity in the Building Societies Act between Sections 108
and 109 as to whether members who have invested for less than two years
have the right to any distribution.
Halifax chairman Jon Foulds said that there had been very friendly
discussions with the Building Societies' Commission on this point and
which approached the court to determine its legality.
If the court agrees, then members will be asked in the spring to agree
the merger which will create Britain's third-largest bank with assets of
around #90bn. It will considerably increase competition in the financial
services area such as personal loans although there is a consequent risk
of upwards pressure on costs to the disadvantage of both investors and
housebuyers.
There will be a separate vote to convert the combined group to plc
status with the subsequent issue of shares.
Mr Foulds said he would be disappointed if the market capitalisation
was less than #8000m but he did not expect it to exceed #10bn. He was
non-committal as to whether the enlarged Halifax would seek new capital.
With around 10 million accounts, the merger will create by far the
largest share register in the world with some 7.5 million investors and
2.5 million borrowers as well as employees and pensioners who will get
the fixed number of shares.
The allocation of shares will be loaded towards the basic rights of
membership, Mr Foulds said, but he would give no indication as to what
the weighting would be. Analysts are expecting that on the basis of an
#8000m market value about #6000m would be appropriated to the basic
distribution with the other #2000m being disbursed according to
qualifying balances.
The matter has been complicated by the allocation of free shares being
influenced by the lowest qualifying balance on each account on a number
of reference dates -- the first being midnight on November 25 last year.
Other dates will be announced in due course and some of these may be
retrospective. There will be a number of variable narrow bands with a
minimum of #1000 and a maximum of #50,000 to qualify for the free
shares.
There is a Halifax-Leeds merger helpline 0800 888 844.

IT is disappointing that your critic, Clare Henry, is not more
positive about the current exhibition, Contemporary British Art in
Print, at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.
The keeper and his staff should be congratulated not castigated for
their initiative. This exhibition is the first since the 1980 show at
the Tate devoted to the Kelpra Studio to acknowledge the contribution
made to British art by a print publisher.
The contribution is all the more remarkable for its high quality in
this case, as it has been made by an individual working in collaboration
with a series of different print workshops, both north and south of the
Border.
Exhibitions of the kind at present on display at Belford Road,
accompanied by very informative catalogues giving full credit to the
artists and printers involved in similar print publications across the
Atlantic, are regularly mounted by leading American museums and are
highly acclaimed internationally.
It is no accident that Scotland has been the venue for this exhibition
but a tribute to the strength of its contemporary printmaking.
Let us hope that this show, devoted to the Paragon Press, is the first
of a series and that future exhibitions, held not just in Edinburgh but
in other British cities, will highlight the best publications of the
Scottish printmaking workshops among others.

ANN SHAW described research into a new drug for the management of
alcohol-related problems being evaluated at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital
(February 23).
She correctly quoted the Guidelines for Sensible Drinking as 21 units
a week for a man or 14 units for a woman, but can I emphasise that one
unit is the amount of alcohol contained in half a pint of beer, in one
single measure of spirits, or in one glass of wine.

DR J D Duncan is entitled to his opinions about the relationship
between poverty and health despite the fact that some of them seem to be
at variance with the published research on the subject (February 22).
It should also be noted that the majority of public health doctors
have years of clinical experience behind them, including general
practice, before entering the speciality of public health medicine.

Had he any sympathy for Cunningham's feminism he would not have
written the vulgar, point-scoring piece that he has but would have
addressed the serious issue of the under-representation of women in
public life or the way some politicians/journalists disingenuously

ENTERPRISE Oil had some comfort last year in that it was able to
increase oil production by 27% and can look forward to a 38% increase by
1997.
Chairman and chief executive Graham Hearne does need some consolation
after losing the bitter #1300m battle to acquire fellow independent
Lasmo and to make up for the rotten oil price.
The average price received was down by over #1 a barrel -- from #11.58
to #10.34 -- and there are few bulls around at present who expect to see
much forward movement in the short to medium term.
As already known, the Lasmo bid cost about #24m, including the
write-down on the 9.8% stake in Lasmo to 150p (now 153p).
Pre-tax profits eased #6m to #94m but at the attributable level there
was a 25% decline to #71m. The dividend is being held at 16p as it has
since 1992 and just covered by earnings of 16.8p before allowing for the
Lasmo costs.
Fortunately cash flow, excluding the investment in Lasmo Exploration
last year, is very positive and resulted in 23 wells being drilled, of
which half had a positive result. This time, some 40 wells will be
drilled which will boost the budget by #40m to #130m.
The offset is the continuing attempt to reduce operating costs. These
fell by a sixth in 1994 to #2.83 and finance director Andrew Shilston
expects to cut another 30p off this year when production should start
rising further towards the 1997 peak of 250,000 barrels a day.

I WRITE to express my profound disappointment that James Allison,
Labour Party Scottish Organiser (1977-1991), has chosen to reward the
unquestionable loyalty of party members and staff with an autobiography
penned in his own inimitable style (March 6,7,8).
I do not wish to contest the remarkable 20/20 hindsight or the
accuracy of the selective quotations from the many entries in Allison's
famed diary. I simply wish to point out to your readers that this is a
highly personal view of the recent history of the Labour Party in
Scotland.
As a member of the Labour by-election team and having worked closely
with many of those named in Monday's extract, most notably Donald Dewar
and Murray Elder, I am offended by Allison's contemptuous tone.
It is my belief that the humiliation at the hands of the SNP at Govan
was the catalyst for modernising Labour's by-election team, both
candidate support and campaigning techniques. In contrast to Allison's
obdurate dismissal of these developments, it is a testament to the
humility, talent, and political maturity of most members of Labour's
team that they were able to learn from the experience of defeat.
And go on to secure the subsequent victories in Glasgow Central and
Paisley North and South.
It is all too easy for an embittered employee of an organisation to
embark on a personal vendetta against those whose ideas and
determination to modernise he could not accept nor democratically defeat
while in office. It is indeed fortunate for the Labour Party, if not
your columns, that all the other participants in these debates have put
the duties of their office to the fore.
I hope that this letter expresses the sentiment of myself and others
who have recently been, or continue to be, entrusted with Labour's
campaigning responsibilities. Their trust and respect for
confidentiality is beyond question, and willingly given.

A. Findlay McFadzean advises readers to think about the idea that we
have no rights, only duties (March 3). If we take his advice we will see
this idea presents us with a problem.
I have a duty towards A which I acknowledge. Does A then have the
right to expect me to do my duty towards him? If so, do I not have a
justifiable right to expect A to do his duty towards me? I think it is
rather obvious that rights and duties are reciprocal and that you can't
have one without the other.
But what is this duty we have towards one another? My grandmother
often taught me about ''the Golden Rule''. It was based on the Christian
admonition to ''love your neighbour as yourself'' and was that ''you
didn't do anything to other people that you wouldn't like them to do to
you''.
Inherent in this teaching is the idea that people have a common sense
of justice and are resentful of injustice.
It is in recognition of this at the state/people level that the
preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says, ''It is
essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last
resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights
should be protected by the rule of law.''
Human rights are no artificial construction and if governments were to
do their duty and respect human rights there would be a lot less crime
and social disruption within states and fewer wars between them.

CERTAIN reports concerning the protest against the M77 have attempted
to portray the participants as primarily unemployed and ''outsiders'' --
some migrant band of ''professional activists'' with no base in the
community.
As someone conducting research into the M77 protest, I must say that
such a portrayal does a grave injustice to the many local people from a
variety of backgrounds who are involved in the protest.
There are, certainly, some folk who have moved to Glasgow in order to
protest the construction of the M77. However, the resistance against the
motorway has also seen the involvement of several community groups, an
array of Glasgow-based professionals -- including academics, planners,
social workers, cartographers, physicians, and environmental workers --
and many adults and school children from local communities such as
Pollok and Corkerhill who will be most affected if the road is built.
To portray such a broad coalition as ''outsiders'' is to enact an
exclusionary politics of the most undemocratic kind.

IT is rarely possible for anyone to be truly objective in any
discussion regarding care of the elderly in society, particularly those
of us who are involved in the caring sector.
However, the facts are simply that private nursing homes are facing a
crisis which will bankrupt many and at the same time disadvantage the
frail elderly men and women who rely on their services.
I have read the excellent letters of Dr Colin Barron, John Shearer,
and others regarding their concerns and views and I support them
wholeheartedly.
Residential homes and nursing homes must never be confused. Only
nursing homes require professionally qualified nurses in charge at any
time of the day or night. Regrettably there have been those which have
been poorly run, a fact which has reflected badly on the owners but
equally on the regional councils responsible for standards in
residential homes and health boards which register and monitor private
nursing homes.
These few unacceptable homes have distorted public perception of a
profession which is absolutely central in offering the best option at
the best price for those who require help.
The truth of the matter is that private nursing homes are now the most
closely monitored and keenly legislated establishments in existence, a
circumstance encouraged and promoted by federations such as the one I
represent.
Loneliness, rarely mentioned in these debates, is the most potent
factor in the physical and mental decline of an elderly person. Nursing
homes create an environment where loneliness simply cannot occur.
No matter the political view, it is simply ludicrous to ignore the
huge costs involved in placing elderly people in social work
department-owned homes and in NHS hospital beds when the private sector
can offer every bit as good a service, and in many instances a much
better one, at infinitely lesser cost to the patient and to us all as
taxpayers.
The present legislation endangers this right of patient choice, and
with the explosion in numbers of elderly people in society over the next
five years, the problem has to be addressed by central Government.
It is a pious hope to believe that all those people needing care can
be kept in their own homes irrespective of cost. The truth of the matter
is that fewer and fewer people will receive the help they need as the
Community Care Act in its present form bites deeper and the funding is
unwisely allocated.

AS a distinguished former administrator, Mr Drummond Hunter will
appreciate that achieving health gain in the developed world takes time
and concerted effort (March 2).
At a national level, accredited information provides real evidence
that the new NHS is treating more patients with waiting lists falling.
Importantly, the alliances with local authorities and voluntary agencies
are ensuring the needs of the elderly, and other priority groups, are
being met in a more comprehensive way. They remain top priority in the
Scottish NHS.
At a local level, the first and second wave NHS Trusts -- 17 of them
-- have presented their annual reports. These reports evidence
innovation and imagination in health care delivery which is benefiting
patients.
They are of course available for public and academic scrutiny. From
April, 1995, NHS Trusts will provide agreed health care programmes for
all of mainland Scotland. On the basis of progress so far, improvements
for patients will be considerable.

Glaxo had already won the backing of the charitable Wellcome Trust,
which owns 39.2% of Wellcome, for the #9000m deal. The Wellcome board,
which had been fighting the takeover, conceded defeat on Tuesday after
''white knight'' counter-bidders failed to emerge.

I DON'T suppose readers are much interested in how their Herald is
produced, or the people who produce it, as long as it is available to
them in the morning, but I really do feel they should know a little more
about people like James McLaren, The Herald's one-time Motoring
Correspondent, whose death you reported (March 4).
Jim was a first-class journalist in every way, as a writer and
technician. In the late 1940s when I became the Herald's night and crime
reporter Jim and I were the only ones on duty in the early hours of the
morning.
I would phone in my stories and Jim would allocate them a space in the
paper and ensure that they fitted that space. Night after night he
performed miracles with my copy and helped to bring The Herald into the
post-war world. Then he would race home madly on his motor bike at 4am.
Sir William Robieson, our editor, must have winced often at the things
the rather dignified Herald published when he had gone home for the
night -- murders, fires, accidents, floods, train crashes -- but he was
a real journalist, too, and realised that the paper could no longer
afford to ignore the kind of thing other newspapers were publishing with
success, although it was still considered by The Herald hierarchy that
the most important items in the paper were the births, marriages, and
deaths on the front page.
The kind of news in which McLaren and I dealt didn't appear on page
one until October, 1958.
Even with modern technology the production of a daily newspaper is
still a miracle of co-operation among many departments and skills, but
it was the Jim McLarens of this world who led the way. Journalism owes a
lot to his kind.

THERE is no prospect of sterling rejoining the Exchange Rate Mechanism
(ERM), said Prime Minister John Major yesterday.
His comments came as sterling failed to maintain its earlier firm tone
and sagged in late European trading.
It continued to follow the dollar lower in the face of the market's
continued preference for mark investment. Traders ignored the
disappointing industrial output figures but if more weak economic data
emerges it will start to impact the pound.
Against the mark, sterling eased back to DM2.2503 compared with
DM2.2517 overnight and $1.6170 from $1.6175, while its trade-weighted
index dipped 0.1 to 85.9.
The US currency continued to recover following comments from the
Federal Reserve about the need to remain vigilant on inflation.
Elsewhere the Mexican peso slid back despite news that Mexico is shortly
to announce a new economic plan.

I AM writing to express concern at the introduction of ''scratch
cards'' by Camelot. I question whether the introduction of such cards is
socially wise or morally justifiable (March 1).
Despite the proferred purpose of raising money for good causes,
Camelot will gain and that is their prime purpose.
There are many people in this country who see no way of escaping the
unsatisfying grind of existence except by accumulating a large sum of
money. They have no way of gaining such a sum except by a real stroke of
luck or by a criminal act.
There is a difference between the Lottery (or Ernie) and scratch cards
in that only in the latter is there a promise of immediate
gratification. Those who are at most risk are those who are unable to
defer immediate gratification.
Scratch cards, like gaming machines, pander to that personality and
are designed to tempt such people to buy and scratch in the hope of
immediate gratification.
I fear there are many families who will suffer in order to increase
Camelot's profits.

ONE day last September I had a minor contretemps with Professor
Stephen Littlechild and his retinue. The director-general of Offer, the
Office of Electricity Regulation, had travelled to Glasgow to announce
details of his review of distribution and supply price controls for the
two Scottish electricity companies.
We were invited to a hotel press conference at 11.00am to hear the
details. I was, therefore, taken aback to hear Littlechild on the radio
that very morning, at just after 8.00, revealing all. He was able to do
so because the details had just been announced to the Stock Exchange
minutes before, right at the start of the day's trading.
This practice of getting market-sensitive announcements out early to
grab a sound bite or two on radio or breakfast television is
increasingly popular among listed company bosses. It is, naturally, much
encouraged by our friends in the electronic media.
It gives chairmen and chief executives two bites at the cherry -- the
brisk on-air interview one morning, the more in-depth coverage in the
printed media, 24 hours later. It also leaves newspaper types like me
feeling distinctly disadvantaged.
How these companies choose to handle major announcements is, at the
end of the day, up to them. But, arguably, when a regulator responsible
to Parliament makes a major announcement affecting millions of consumers
and investors he has a duty to be more even-handed in how that news gets
from Offer to the masses.
I made that point, as forcibly as I could, to the Littlechild team in
the hotel corridor, before the briefing began. The professor stayed in
the background. I was confronted by his patrician deputy, who
disdainfully suggested that, whoever I might be, I simply did not know
what I was talking about. Offer had an obligation to inform markets
first and that's what it had done.
That, of course, was not my point. Offer certainly has that obligation
to inform markets first. But it didn't have to do it at 7.30 in the
morning to get the prof on the airwaves at eight, while the rest of us
were forced to wait until 11, with no chance of getting the story across
to our readers until the next morning.
My mind flipped back to that incident this week as I watched the
hapless Littlechild get himself into a right old pickle with his warning
of a tougher rethink on the price controls he imposed on the English
regional electricity companies last August.
Market-sensitive timing? The electricity regulator could not have been
more insensitive about announcing his U-turn. He could not have wreaked
more mayhem in the sector if he had announced that four RECs had
rendered themselves insolvent through derivatives trading, Leeson-style.
To choose last Tuesday to reveal his mounting doubts about whether he
had been tough enough on the RECs last year, to drop his bombshell the
day after the Government sold its remaining 40% stake in National Power
and PowerGen, and three days before Trafalgar's offer for Northern
Electric closes, betrays, at best, naive otherworldliness, at worst,
reckless incompetence.
Singlehandedly Littlechild has wiped billions off the value of
electricity shares. He has pushed the Northern board into recommending
Trafalgar's #11 a share cash offer but, thanks to Northern's plunging
share price, he has also put the bid itself back in the melting pot. He
has left new investors in the two English generators licking their
wounds and has dealt a fresh blow to the London market's reputation for
probity after the Barings fiasco. Who knows what will now happen to the
planned sale of National Grid?
Champions of the consumer interest may be tempted to see in all this
the emergence of Saint Stephen, a diminutive bearded David-like figure,
bringing down a high-voltage Goliath, not with a slingshot, but with a
tougher ''RPI minus X'' price control. But Littlechild had his chance to
be that tough with the RECs last August and, frankly, had the wool
pulled over his eyes.
The way the markets received his five-year settlement then, with REC
shares soaring skywards, said it all. The professor's attempts to
explain that away as a natural reaction to the ending of a period of
uncertainty are hogwash. He got it spectacularly wrong then. And, to
suggest that he can put it right now but, in the process, turn the
market into a disorderly bear pit, simply compounds the doubts. He is
not up to the job.
In his Tuesday statement, Littlechild said he was responding to ''what
appears to be widespread public concern'' about the price controls he
had already proposed. That hardly sounds like a decisive basis for
action. Yesterday, in a further explanation penned for the FT,
Littlechild perhaps gets nearer the nub.
''I believe that a suitably revised price control will increase public
confidence in the regulatory regime,'' he writes. In other words,
Littlechild is trying to restore his own credibility, regardless of the
consequences for others. It will not do.
The creation of a new breed of independent regulators was part of the
Faustian bargain the Government entered into when it decided to
privatise the former monopoly utilities in Britain. Would-be investors
had to be encouraged to part with their money, with the prospect of
rising share values and mounting dividends. But consumers had to be
reassured that they wouldn't pay for it all through rising phone,
electricity, and gas bills.
Giving the regulators the power to enforce real cuts in prices means
that the market in these privatised stocks, far from being free --
dictated only by the law of supply and demand -- is, in a very real
sense, rigged. Striking the right balance between returns to investors
and savings for consumers calls for consummate skill and judgment.
Professor Littlechild has been found lacking in that this week. But,
with a second five-year appointment already safely in his pocket, who
now regulates the underperforming regulator? If he won't resign, who can
sack him?

KINGFISHER, the Woolworths-to-Comet group, announced yesterday that
four ousted directors are to share #3m compensation.
The company also announced that chief executive Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy,
who stepped down as chairman in January, is to take a dramatic cut in
his pay to #700,000.
Sir Geoffrey was bitterly criticised last year when his pay was
increased to more than #1m.
Shares in Kingfisher fell sharply through 1994 and in the early weeks
of 1995 after the group announced that Woolworths suffered poor
Christmas sales for the second successive year and electrical retailer
Comet had fallen into a loss.
In a brief statement to the Stock Exchange, Kingfisher said:
''Compensation for the four Kingfisher directors leaving the company as
a result of the board changes announced on January 27 and February 13
will not exceed a total of #3m.
''The remuneration, excluding pension contributions, of chief
executive Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy for the year ended January 28 will not
exceed #700,000.
''This reflects a decision by Sir Geoffrey to waive his long-term
incentive bonus and a reduction in his performance-related bonus.''
In a major about-turn, the company also said it is to replace
executive directors' three-year rolling contracts with two-year rolling
contracts.
The four former directors -- chief executive Alan Smith, finance
director James Kerr-Muir, corporate affairs director Nigel Whittaker and
strategy and international development director Tim Breene -- were on
three-year rolling contracts.
Smith was believed to have earned #635,000 to #640,000, Whittaker
#495,000 to #500,000 and Kerr-Muir #410,000-#415,000, while Breene
earned a salary near the bottom end of these levels. The figures exclude
pension contributions.
Kingfisher has yet to report results for the year to the end of
January.
In the six months to July 30, 1994, the group made pre-tax profits of
#88.1m compared with #82m in the corresponding period the previous year.

THERE is no point in attempting to minimise the seriousness of the
rebuff administered to the British Government by President Clinton
yesterday. The decision to allow Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein to visit the
United States, to invite him to meet President Clinton, and to attend a
St Patrick's Day dinner with American leaders (even if loyalists and Mr
Ian Paisley have also been invited) is bad enough. It is made even more
serious by President Clinton's determination to allow Mr Adams to open a
new Sinn Fein office in Washington and to raise funds for his party in
the United States. Mr Adams will relish the propaganda coup. The British
Government has been lobbying hard for some time to prevent all of this
happening. Sir Patrick Mayhew, in Washington earlier this week, added
his considerable diplomatic skills to the effort but President Clinton
has another agenda, not far removed from the fact that the campaign for
the next presidential election in the United States has started already.
The Irish-American lobby has been active and the Irish Government under
Mr John Bruton is clearly able to demonstrate continuity with the
determined efforts of the previous administration in Dublin.
The affair appears to have been clinched by Gerry Adams's promise to
discuss the decommissioning of IRA arms, though this is not the sort of
word that should ever have been used to describe the process. Ships and
other military ventures are commissioned as a means of welcoming them
into honourable service. Terrorist weapons are no more decommissioned
than they are commissioned; they are simply used to murder people and
there is nothing honourable about that. Nevertheless, their removal has
to be discussed. The difference in the context of these proposed
discussions, between that agreed by President Clinton and Gerry Adams,
and that preferred by the British Government, is significant. Throughout
his Washington visit this week Sir Patrick insisted, both to his
American hosts and in discussions with a wide range of US politicians,
that any talks on the removal of IRA weapons had to be constructive.
Northern Ireland Office Minister Michael Ancram reinforced the message
on Wednesday with his stipulation that any talks must be serious and
constructive. As far as anyone is aware this morning, Mr Adams has only
agreed to discuss the removal of the arms and President Clinton has
accepted this promise as adequate.
It is, of course, nothing of the sort. Mr Adams has an inexhaustible
ability to discuss anything at the greatest length possible. Whether
these discussions are serious or constructive, in the sense of moving
towards an acceptable conclusion, is another matter. He knows that, and
he knows that Her Majesty's Government also knows it. He has managed to
extract maximum benefit from Washington by making a meaningless promise,
and any genuine moves to surrender IRA weapons will bring a double
benefit in the form of a future concession by the British and Irish
governments. What this does for the constant assertion that he does not
speak for the IRA is not explained. Mr Adams, meantime, will be able to
amass considerable sums of money from Irish-American sympathisers. The
pool of potential donors is large. The best estimate suggests that there
are 40 million Irish-Americans in the United States and even if only a
small proportion of them donate money a tidy sum will be gathered. Mr
Adams has promised that this will be used for political purposes.
Despite the peace process and the fact that the various parties are
talking to each other, he should not be taken at his word. It should not
be impossible for some sort of monitoring of money transfers from the
United States to be established. Perhaps the United States government,
which has so generously tipped this pot of gold into stained hands,
could assist? In the circumstances, it is the least they should do.

LIFE looks good at IMI at present with the engineers emerging from
1994 buoyed by a second half volume increase of 11% and that being
maintained so far into 1995.
Pre-tax profits last year jumped 19% to #85.3m but were offset by the
#35m write-off on the diversification into computing through Redwood
International so that stated profits slid from ##71.7m to #50.3m.
Chief executive Gary Allen said yesterday that with gearing at just
22%, IMI is looking for acquisitions in the US and Europe -- the Far
East is too difficult for takeovers and growth there will have to be
organic. The chosen areas would be in building products, fluid power,
and drinks dispensing.
Last year, the building side of the group continued to benefit from
the strength of the German operations. Eastern Germany is building at a
quick pace in an attempt to recover from the Communist era.
Well over half the company's UK copper tube production is exported to
Germany while in the UK prospects are improving in commercial building
which should more than offset any slowdown in the private sector house
building which accounts for about #40m out of divisional turnover of
#355m.
Fluid power benefited from the economic recovery in major markets and
with Australia looking good as a springboard for Pacific Rim expansion.
The drinks dispensing business was particularly strong in the US. IMI
has exclusive supply agreements with Coca-Cola and Pepsi which are
helping to place its coolers and dispensers into new markets as the two
soft drinks giants extend their empires into the developing world.
The sore point is titanium where losses of ''several millions''
continue. That is a result of weak demand from Rolls-Royce and intense
price competition --there is no serious threat as yet from Russian
suppliers which have still to get Western quality accreditaion.
However, there is no respite likely for 1995 with losses of around
#6m. Coin minting has been quite buoyant but the significant divisional
growth has been in producing tokens for casios in America where 16
states in the last year or so have lifted the restrainsts on gambling.
The dividend total has been raised just [1/2]p to 10.5p for a 4.6%
yield with the shares 15p easier on the day at 285p. Current year
profits seem set to jump by around a quarter to #107m where the shares
would be selling at 13 times probable earnings.

EXPOSED: cuddly marine mammal is secret killer. Of course it is, and
not so secret at that. The dolphin kills fish to eat and -- according to
the evidence of last night's BBC Scotland film Operation Survival --
kills harbour porpoises, possibly to protect its food source. But here's
another moral dilemma for animal rights activists and New Age mystics
who believe that in saving the dolphin we save ourselves: what's the
pay-off for lovable Flipper's equally amiable wee cousin?
The dolphin is a nineties icon. Above the panda, beyond the whale, it
has become the supreme deity in the pantheon of animal worship. The
secular West still needs its gods, and the dolphin's divine powers have
been credited with faith healing, telepathic communication, and shark
protection duties.
There are any number of witnesses to the marine epiphany of swimming
with the dolphins, but who among you will now pop your boy on the back
of a bottleneck in the Moray Firth?
The sacred one has flippers of clay. I'm not being entirely flippant.
When the big sea predator is seen doing what comes naturally --
eliminating the competition -- it throws into further confusion all our
crazily scrambled attitudes towards animals. If we give animals
''rights'' equal to our own, do we also give them  ''rights'' equal to
each other's? Or when we save the dolphin do we punish the harbour
porpoise?
The point that seems to get missed by many activists is that we don't
liberate animals by giving them ''rights'', we reassert our supremacy
over them. We extend to them moral systems developed singularly because
we are human and unique. If we teach a child not to kick a dog, as the
old example goes, it's not only good for the dog but good for the child.
But will it stop the dog mauling the neighbourhood cats? You bet it
won't.
If we ban fox-hunting will the grateful fox renounce its own brutish
nature and leave the henhouse alone? Of course not; and neither is that
an argument for NOT banning fox-hunting. Like the case against capital
punishment it's not so much what execution does to the murderer which
matters as what it does to us.
My own position on fox-hunting is neutral, partly because the debate
is tainted by such vicious levels of class hatred and blind emotion it's
impossible to make sense of it, and partly because I don't know enough
about the hunt. A keeper of hounds, a veteran huntsman of humble rural
stock (note how it's necessary to define his social class), once told me
that the fox's death is swift; that the hounds break its neck in one
movement well before they start pulling it apart.
On the other hand, I don't doubt the fox feels terror in its beasty
breast when the pack bells its excitement, much as the chicken panics
when old Reynard comes a-calling; unless, of course, it's a battery
chicken, in which case it will be securely protected from all predators.
See what I mean about scrambled attitudes?  Spare the fox and you
condemn the free-range hen.
The most serious obstacle for animal rights activists, however, is
their own negativism. True, there are some disagreeable practices for
which they can provide options. It shouldn't be necessary to transport
live animals long distances for slaughter when we have abattoirs in this
country; it should be possible to re-educate the European palate to
enjoy pink veal, although I dislike the xenophobic,
we're-nice-they're-nasty undercurrents to the anti-crating case.
But the real opposition to organisations like, say, Compassion in
World Farming, is the enemy within: the extreme liberationists and the
proselytising vegan/vegetarian movement. They do speak such nonsense.
They do lack imagination, and even the most elementary knowledge of
human history.
The other day I read a claim by one of their missionaries that British
people had only become serious meat-eaters in the twentieth century
(which is true, for reasons of economy rather than ideology) and that we
should all therefore return to a ''more natural'' vegetarian diet.
If we followed his advice and returned . . . and returned . . . and
returned, we would find ourselves back in pre-agrarian societies happily
hunting and gathering. Might not be a bad thing. There's a lot of
evidence that pre-agrarian Europe was a carefree, creative place for
tribes not yet held in bondage to the back-breaking work of planting,
harvesting and grinding grain, or the year-round husbanding of
livestock.
Their social groups hunted and gathered when they needed to feed
themselves, and spent the rest of the time drawing pictures on rock
walls, making rudimentary jewellery and learning to sing for pleasure.
But they also spilt the blood of Brother Boar and Sister Deer.
The consequences of an exclusively vegetarian culture -- and even more
a vegan one -- seem to be overlooked by the zealots. For what destiny
are they sparing the animals? What will happen to the Aberdeen Angus
when no-one wants to eat him? What will happen to the Suffolk sheep when
no-one wants her lambs?
For the vegan not even the Friesian has a future, or the sheep for her
wool, and the welfare of the chicken will be left to the fox. Farm
animals will become endangered species. Those who investigate these
things already know that the cow  would be extinct if it hadn't been
useful to the human purpose, and I'm old enough to have experience of a
more recent example.
Everyone over 40 remembers the days when heavy horses were part of the
urban traffic and fixtures on the rural landscape. Everyone under 40 is
hard pushed to tell their Clydesdales from their Shires unless they seek
out the splendid great  beasts in ''heavy horse centres'', where -- like
redundant miners -- they've become part of the heritage and tourism
industries.
Is that what the campaigning vegetarian wants? The Charollais cow as
protected species? Perhaps it is. So let's assume that the movement
gathers momentum until its aim has been universally achieved, and we are
back in the Garden with only apples to eat. The animal rights activist
doesn't go away. There is still a serpent to sort.
There is still the problem of the sheep and the goats to resolve. Whom
shall we save?  Who are the justified sinners of the animal world? The
Siberian tiger, who slaughters his own cubs if he gets the chance? Orca
the whale, with her appetite for pretty penguins and soppy seals?  The
friendly neighbourhood dolphins of the Moray Firth?
And whom shall we reject? The tenacious rat, intelligent but unloved?
The ugly hyena, slavering scavenger and devoted mother?  Who will stand
up for the harbour porpoise when the smiling dolphin batters him with
his bottle nose?

WHEN those at the centre of the Tory Party start shunting gently in
the opposite direction it is time for Mr Major and his colleagues to
take notice. Viscount Whitelaw, an icon of decent Conservatism, is not
one of nature's rebels. By age and experience, and certainly by
inclination, he is interested in the unfashionable concept of service.
In the context of Britain's fragmented and soon-to-be-privatised rail
system that makes him distinctly steam-driven. His reservations over the
manner in which rail privatisation is being conducted are utterly
correct, if spoken with characteristic caution and grace.
Nevertheless his fears are evident. He undoubtedly believes that the
West Coast Line is in danger of abandonment through neglect and, despite
the protestations of Government Ministers, it is hard to find anyone
with knowledge of the railways who would disagree. Viscount Whitelaw's
anger on this issue was made clear when Transport Minister John Watts
cancelled a meeting with concerned MPs and peers on the grounds that he
was unprepared. This was understandable, and anyone who has witnessed
the unfortunate Mr Watts attempting to explain policy might have taken
it as a blessing. Nevertheless it stands as a perfect symbol of a policy
which is horribly misconceived, abortive in practice, and unlikely ever
to meet the requirements of the modern transport system which this
country needs so desperately.  Viscount Whitelaw knows this, Government
Ministers in their innermost hearts know this, and now we understand
that British Rail chairman Sir Bob Reid is in agreement. He admitted
yesterday that services have worsened in the run-up to privatisation and
claimed ringingly that he would not put his own money into any of the
new rail companies. If Viscount Whitelaw is a genteel shunter, Sir Bob
is definitely a buffer-basher. He tends to say what he thinks, and what
he thinks about rail privatisation is clearly of little comfort to the
Government. When charged in the Commons yesterday with Sir Bob's
disaffection and reluctance to put his money where his tracks used to
be, the Prime Minister responded, with one of his triumphant grins, that
all of Sir Bob's comments should have been mentioned, and particularly
the bit where he gives his assent to privatisation of a workable sort.
Frankly, this was pathetic. Much of Sir Bob's unease centres on the
proposed operation of Railtrack which will gather track access charges
from the train operators.
Railtrack is being used, through the raising of access charges and the
subsequent costing of the services which use them, as a handy vehicle
for discovering justifications for withdrawing services. This is a
simple indication of the deviousness of the system and its essential
impracticability. None of this passes muster in the country at large.
Now it is clear that it is no less acceptable at the centre of the Tory
Party or within the core of railway professionals.

<HEADLINE>Westland order lifts GKN.  Group earnings morethan double to #200m</HEADLINE>

THE Ministry of Defence order for helicopters from Westland underpins
prospects for GKN, which staged a sharp recovery last year, with profits
more than doubling to #200m. GKN chairman Sir David Lees said 1994 was a
good year for the group.
Westland has been waiting years for the order and as deliveries build
up in coming years the company stands to make much higher profits. The
order is a fitting swansong for Alan Jones who has run Westland in
recent years but is now leaving to join BICC.
''Westland is in a very good position relative to its competitors and
will make good returns in future,'' said Mr Jones.
Until now the company has been living on a rather hand-to-mouth basis
through maintenance work and spares, though achieving considerable
success in winning update work on existing Westland helicopers in
service around the world.
It is hoping export orders will start flowing in now the UK defence
establishment has given a vote of confidence to the EH101 support and
Apache attack helicopters.
Mr Jones said Westland and its sub-contractors would be recruiting
more labour as a result of the contracts. The company's main production
facilities are at Yeovil. The new work will raise margins at Westland
through creating more volume and raising capacity utilisation.
Westland contributed its expected #19m of profits last year. GKN's
other defence interests were the only activity to show lower profits,
reflecting a gap between deliveries of Warrior armoured cars to the MoD
and the start of the Kuwaiti order. This will be in full swing by
mid-year.
The upturn in the car market in the US and a lesser extent in Europe
brought an upsurge in operating profits from the main vehicle driveline
business. They rose 61% to #122m on the back of higher volumes and
continuing productivity improvements which boosted margins. The group
accounted for 34% of world production of constant velocity joints, a
gain of 4%. It actually made 56 million joints.
The outlook is positive though there is some concern over the 15%
increase in raw material prices. The group will seek to recover this in
prices though Trevor Bonner, who heads the automative side, agreed that
this would be difficult.
GKN's cash position has been greatly strengthened by the cash
settlement of the dispute between Westland and certain Arab countries,
strong cash flow and customer advances. It has cash of #300m and even
disregarding customer advances has no debt. But acquisitions are not on
the cards because of the investment demands of existing activities.
The Chep pallet business, now in a simplified ownership structure with
the Australian Brambles Group, went from strength to strength, raising
profits by 35% to #42m. The reorganisation has made it easier to develop
the European activities, which are rapidly expanding, with a pallet
fleet of 33,000,000.
GKN's dividends are going up for the first time since 1989. The 13.5p
final raises the total by 5% to 21.5p. This is covered only 1.3 times
against the target of twice, averaged through the trading cycle, and is
a measure of the group's optimism.
Last year's trading trend is continuing into the current year and the
group is clearly confident of another strong advance in profits, which
solidly underpins the shares. They rose 14p to 579p as analysts upgraded
their profit forecasts to around #270m.

FOREIGN &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, the largest in the sector, more
than achieved its goal of increasing dividends ahead of inflation last
year.
With a final of 1.1255p, plus a foreign income dividend of 0.1532p,
the total is up 6.7% at 1.88p. But asset value dipped by 9%.
The number of shareholders in F&amp;C is poised to top 100,000 and small
shareholders will soon have more than 50%. This is largely a reflection
of the group's share-saving scheme which has also virtually eliminated
the discount of the shares to asset value.
The saving scheme did start pushing up costs, prompting questions at
the annual meeting. The costs of the plan, however, were reduced in 1994
as a result and a further reduction is seen this year.
Group expenses still rose 9% largely as a result of the management fee
which was up 15% because it is based on a three-year rolling average of
assets.
F&amp;C manager Michael Hart is confident about the longer-term outlook,
though the next few months may be difficult as a result of the likely
inflation numbers and higher interest rates. But overall he feels higher
rates have largely been discounted. The group has raised its gearing
slightly to 11% as it anticipates better investment conditions.
Mr Hart considers the UK economy is looking good, though there is some
concern over the policies of a future Labour government. He is cautious
about the US market because of high valuations, but is hopeful for
Europe where the economy is moving forward and industrial restructuring
is continuing. Japanese markets could be attractive in 1995 if local
investors recover their nerve.
So F&amp;C will remain fully invested. The portfolio ended 1994 with 43%
in the UK, 21% in the US, 12% Japan, 6% the Far East and 2% Latin
America.

A NAE Luck Award to Jack McGinn, former chairman of Celtic FC and
vice-president of the Scottish Football Association.
Although Jack has no longer any position of power at Parkhead, the new
regime allowed him to remain as a Celtic representative on the SFA. He
had fond hopes of taking over soon as SFA president, with all the
honours, not to mention perks, the post carries.
This is now extremely unlikely because of the financial restructuring
which has taken place at Celtic Park. Celtic plc, the new public limited
company, has been registered with the SFA and Scottish Football League.
The plc has three directors. Jack McGinn is not one and therefore
cannot represent Celtic on Scottish football's ruling bodies. The
directors are Fergus McCann, Eric Reilly, and Willie Haughey. The
absence of Celtic club secretary Dominic Keane means that he too will
have no voice on the Scottish Football League.
Labouring it
CHRISTINE Richard, the Edinburgh Tory councillor and controversialist,
is taking the Labour Party to task. Hold the farming page, we hear you
cry.
But haud on. She is complaining that the comrades are taking too long
to process an application by her son Christopher to join the People's
Party. She claims to be miffed at the discourtesy shown to her
''champagne socialist'' son, as she describes him.
Mrs Richard is no doubt deeply unhappy that her offspring should jump
the dyke politically. But that's what she gets for sending him to Fettes
College. We all know what happens to Fettes' best and brightest. Yes,
they grow up to be leader of the Labour Party.

would invariably exclaim before getting on with her work: ''Hauf-past

Mr Watson adds: ''Another similar saying that comes to mind is
'Half-past ten and not a whore in the house dressed'. I'm sure your
readers will have other versions.''

EFFIE Davidson, an old girl of Dollar Academy, writes to say that plus

resident in Findochty, Banffshire, tells us: ''During my last year at
school (1938) it was announced at morning prayers by the then rector
that boys and girls must not be seen walking together along the Back

Gaelic on a plate
ONE of our Gaelic chums has been taking an interest in motor car
registration numbers. Licence plates can mean something totally
different when they contain certain Gaelic words.
The letters BAS should be avoided since they mean death. MAS
translates as posterior, backside, erse even.
CEO means smoke. BEO is alive and would be entirely inappropriate if
included on a licence plate belonging to a hearse. LAS would be nice on
a fire engine since it means to light up.
The AA should note that the letters SAS mean ''stuck''. Those driving
around with DIA in the registration are getting above themselves. It
means deity.
That's all your Gaelic for today.

Gown yersel
WITH technical colleges achieving university status, it was only a
matter of time before further education establishments aspired to higher
things.
Kilmarnock College, for example, has gone all gaudeamus igitur. It is
now compulsory for the sundry mechanicals and hairdressers graduating
from the college to wear academic gowns as they collect their Scotvec
certificates.
The college authorities are currently debating whether to go ahead
with a scheme similar to the honorary degrees doled out by universities.
Local businessmen and dignitaries will be created ''fellows of
Kilmarnock College''. Rumours abound, but are denied, that a publican
and a car dealer are on the short-list.
The yoonie that likes to say Yes, Yes, Yes!
HEIDIE of this parish writes to let us know that Strathclyde
University's faculty of education, Jordanhill College as was, is

PHYLLIS Nagy's The Strip, which runs until April 1, is certainly her
most ambitious play to date, a giant leap forward that flies and falters
but challenges us on almost every level. Set simultaneously in
Liverpool, a modernistic Las Vegas, and London's Earls Court (Tobias
Hoheisel's set is part chrome-plated airship, part virtual reality
pyramid and Sphynx landscape) it is a play of possibilities.
In Steven Pimlott's stylish though partly still unfathomable
production, Nagy taps into a world of personal choice, random events,
and current preoccupations, suggesting that though consumerism and
technology may be leading us by the nose, we ourselves are all at sea,
bobbing between identities.
At least, that's what I take to be the inference of a play that offers
few concessions to convention. Nagy's characters -- who include a female
impersonator (played by a woman), a southern racist and his wife,
several gay and lesbian couples (in quite restrained mode for Nagy) --
and a multi-strand narrative line all combine to push the boundaries of
audience credibility to their limits.
If you want comforting entertainment, Nagy is not for you. But if you
delight in wry humour, her wicked ability to play cultural and sexual
clashes (the US v England, straight v gay) against each other, then The
Strip is a tantalising, apocalyptic taste of the future. Even when, as
here, the picture is a flawed one.
A gold-edged cast includes Cheryl Campbell, Nicholas Le Provost,
Nicholas Farrell, John Padden, and Deirdre Harrison as a raunchy Madonna
lookalike.

ONE of the main arguments against introducing entrance charges to our
national museums and galleries is that it would deter occasional or
lunchtime visitors. Certainly exhibitions like The Taking of Christ,
currently showcasing Caravaggio at the National Gallery in London, would
make no economic sense. A great pity, as it's a little gem.
Three Caravaggio paintings normally on show in the main galleries
provide context and meaning for a fourth, The Taking of Christ,
discovered in 1990 in Dublin after having been thought lost. The
National Gallery's Supper at Emmaus, painted for the same patron as the
Dublin picture, helps remind us that Caravaggio produced some of the
most deeply moving religious works of the baroque period.
Both works are roughly the same size and may have been conceived as a
pair. The Taking of Christ depicts the moment when Christ was identified
by Judas to the Roman soldiers. Caravaggio has represented the scene at
night, with only a lantern's glow piercing the darkness. The effect is a
brilliant piece of theatre: the characters are isolated, we are not
distracted by superfluous detail, and the two heads meeting for the
fateful kiss provide a wealth of meaning in their contrast.
Caravaggio's appeal to a present-day viewer probably lies in his
realism. The interest in textures in the frugal meal in The Supper at
Emmaus or the virtuoso performance of the armour in The Taking of Christ
could hardly be bettered. Yet there is a more profound realism at play,
too, as well as a sense of historical accuracy suggested by dirty
fingernails, shabby clothes, and lined faces. Caravaggio's religious
figures, with not a halo among them, are among the most accessible and
appealing in Western art.
The Boy bitten by a Lizard comes as a shock after such sobering works.
Its unabashedly homo-erotic overtones, with the naked youth wriggling in
horror as the lizard bites his finger, is a reminder that
seventeenth-century artists had to court as wide a circle of patrons as
possible.
Yet the connection to the religious works resides in its still-life
details. The sensual gratification oozing out of the picture, apparent
in the fruit and flowers in front of the naked boy, would have been
recognised by a contemporary audience as a reminder of the frivolity of
pursuing earthly pleasures. It is only when an exhibition like this
regroups works afresh that such links can easily be made.

CONSUMERS' emphasis on value for money and good service from retailers
is good news for the John Lewis Partnership which has prided itself on
being ''never knowingly undersold''.
In the year ended 28 January 1995, the partnership increased its
pre-tax profits by 25% to #116.8m. This followed the 31% improvement
last year. Group sales grew by 6% to #2575m with department stores the
star performer.
The 34,000 partners, or permanent staff working in the business, are
to share a #43m bonus equivalent to 12% of annual pay, or six weeks
extra pay. Many organisations could benefit from adopting the
partnership's constitution which effectively caps the renumeration of
the chairman at around #500,000, based on a formula.
Despite this voluntary restraint, John Lewis said that in its entire
history it had never had any of its senior directors poached by rival
organisations.
Chairman Stuart Hampson said: ''This partnership style of trading was
very much better attuned to the 1990s'' compared with the brasher 1980s.
This ''inclusive approach'' to retailing, which recognises that there
are many stakeholders in the business including workers, customers, and
suppliers, has been part and parcel of John Lewis' trading philosophy
since its inception.
Mr Hampson added that the group had made ''strong headway in what has
been a generally weak market'', largely due to careful cost control.
The partnership currently has 22 John Lewis department stores
including sites in Aberdeen and Edinburgh.
The stores remain commited to selling a wide product mix, not just
clothes and accessories, from large High Street sites in established
retail areas. There has been talk of department stores being an outmoded
retail format for the future but the trading performance of John Lewis
suggests that this is not the case. John Lewis' reported sales per
square foot of #450 are the envy of many in the industry.
Mr Hampson attributes the success of the business to respecting its
customers, honest fair trading, and constant good value rather than
''spurious special offers and discounts''.
Although food retailing has been intensely competitive for the past
few years the partnership's Waitrose foodstores have managed to more
than hold their own by focusing on offering high-quality merchandise.
Current sales are 5% up on an underlying basis.
Waitrose has benefited from opening 20 of its foodstores on Sundays
and introducing scanning technology.
Waitrose stores are all located in the Midlands and southern England
and there are no plans to extend the chain northwards. It has 2% market
share compared with 11% held by Sainsbury, the market leaders.

THERE I am in a favourite wee haunt of mine on the South Side, The
Elcho Bar, having a wee cup of tea with a wee goldie to wash it down and
a Danish pastry with Evelyn Sexton the proprietrix.
I have but an hour ago committed the splendid tones upon the wireless,
Radio Scotland's Annie Webster Show in fact, and the wee goldie is
rather a favorite blend of mine, a whisky from the bottom of the Fort
William heap, Ben Nevis. It is a good blend (though they also do a
superb 26-year-old malt, if you can get your hands on it). I am enjoying
the bathe in its aroma when in pops an old chum -- Art Sutter, the
entertainer and broadcaster who was bumped unceremoniously off the Radio
Scotland airwaves a while back there along with such luminaries as
Jimmie Macgregor.
I didnae care all that much then: I was still getting employed by the
Beeb. Och, I did care: I like both the gents. Well, Art is still
broadcasting of course, notably for Grampian, but what he was doing in
the Elcho was representing, criv, what else, Ben Nevis Whisky and, by
the cost of his cashmere raiment, doing very well at it. (Is that enough
to get my hands on a Ben Nevis 26-year-old?)
It was a year or so ago. Some of those who were permitted to ''rest''
I was pleased about. I think everybody in Scottish broadcasting was glad
to see Neville Garden going. I'd rather see Neville alive and not
hearing him on radio, than listening to his obituary over the morning
cereal, and Neville was in the business of working himself into the
grave. Yet some of the changes were definitely odd.
Mind you, Radio Scotland remains a remarkably capable unit. If you are
a radio listener you will know what I mean. I regret the passing of the
abrasive Lesley Riddoch, who went off to a ladies' newspaper in the
East, but her programme, Speaking Out, is still of interest, headed now
usually by a bete noire of mine, wur ain Ruth Wishart.
Tom Morton's programme which follows is grand (except for the music;
dear God, Tom, you are needing the Frank O'Hagan band, featuring the
Urban V on moothie: hint). Tom is a touch similar to The Herald's Tom
Shields: you only know how good they are when somebody else deps for
them.
The touchy Colin Bell has no rivals, and Edie Stark has the cheeriest,
and often the most idiosyncratic, radio show outside of Ireland. By and
large Radio Scotland does a good job, especially when I am on it myself,
with a Ben Nevis inside me of a morning.
The other week Tony Currie wrote a bitter piece about the private
radio boys and girls in Scotland. He was referring in particular to
Scot-FM, and a chap called Scotty McClue especially. This McClue -- who
doesn't actually use his own name and I am not surprised at that -- does
a phone-in in which he is rude and unpleasant to all and sundry.
He is a disgrace to broadcasting, but it appears he is popular and
indeed now is alleged to contribute a column of sorts to a Scottish
tabloid. Many years back I kicked off the same sort of phone-in -- the
sort of thing they all do now, the ''shock-jocks'' programming.
I did it then on Radio Clyde and we copied the notion from America,
especially a broadcaster called Captain Bad. The difference was that we
may have been pugnacious, but I never said a thing I didn't believe in
(and used to cop some criticism from Clyde deputy supremo Alex Dickson
for it). The difference was that a lot of broadcasters were a touch
professional then. Not that we were well paid.
My phone-in prog was hugely and surprisingly successful and they used
to repeat it twice over. They paid me twenty-five quid a week. That is
more than, for instance, the recent Scot-FM paid me for a two-hour stint
on the Margo MacDonald show in its first week.
They didn't pay me at all (though, having asked me to do another show
they say they will and it is all an oversight and I hope it is). A
Paisley mob called Q96 had me working for them for two months every
Saturday and me paying my taxis there and back and not a penny have I
seen.
Probably the most disgraceful was the prestigious Good Morning America
which had myself and wee Cliff Hanley on three mornings in a row and, on
being questioned regarding the poppy, said: what the hell, you got free
coffee.
I took a Ben Nevis from Art in The Elcho. ''You're well oot it, Art,''
I said. The phone rang. Evelyn took it. ''BBC looking for you Jack.'' My
cynicism swept into the darkness and my heart leapt. Something wrong
with broadcasters, ain't there?

SEEN the score; read the poem; interviewed the composer. But none of
it prepared me for the unveiling last night of the vast musical
landscape that is William Sweeney's setting of Sorley Maclean's poem,
The Woods of Raasay.
With the inevitable moments that, in any new piece, require a couple
of hearings to sort out their context, this is as evocative and
effective a piece as the composer has written.
Mirroring the duality of the poem, the music exists on two levels: it
has a beautiful simplicity and an impressive complexity. The simplicity
-- and it is gorgeous -- lies in the clarity of the music's expression.
The first section is underpinned by a gentle, lilting, strumming. The
second -- the slow movement -- is sheer luminosity, erupting into the
third, which features bellowing, driven music. And the finale, which
echoes the opening, is characterised by a swinging, psalm-like tune.
On top of this Sweeney has set Maclean's rich text for bass and
soprano in a vocal line that blends continuous lyricism with
mind-boggling virtuosity. Drenched in imagery and expressive beauty, the
vocal lines -- spectacularly performed by Virginia Kerr and Stephen
Varcoe -- take flight and settle only 35 minutes later at the end of the
piece. Atmospherically played by the SSO under Martyn Brabbins.
Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony -- the second-half piece -- can't fail
in the City Hall. The impact is immense and immediate. That said, this
was a fairly direct reading, packed with incident but rather lacking in
direction and overall thrust.

NEW single-tier Labour-controlled councils will work together after
the local elections to defend their services against privatisation,
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson promised yesterday.
He claimed the Tory Government did not care if local services were
surrendered to ''all manner of sharks and fly-by-night cowboys'' through
compulsory tendering.
Ministers had a ''hidden agenda'' in the reorganisation, which was the
emasculation of local democracy. Labour councils would resist the
privatisation process, if necessary by organising services across
council boundaries.
The Government's aim was to atomise our major public services in order
to leave them more vulnerable to privatisation and keep control in the
hands of St Andrews House, said Mr Robertson.
As a result, Labour councils would have little choice but to establish
joint arrangements between the new shadow authorities.
These in turn would take over the contractor's function of existing
Direct Service Organisations and Direct Labour Organisations, and would
be responsible for running the existing contracts for the rest of their
duration. As well as preparing ''in house'' bids for any future
tendering round.
''Above all we should try to ensure that large contracts are not
broken up and sold off to the private sector,'' said Mr Robertson.
It was utter madness to restart the tendering process as quickly as
the Government planned. There should be a moratorium until the next
General Election.
He also attacked the Government for not listening to the Staff
Commission, appointed to advise Scottish Secretary Ian Lang.
Ministers had ignored the warnings of the chairman, Mr Robert Peggie,
about the tightness of the reorganisation timetable, and had recommended
redundancy payments for staff far below the level suggested by the
commission. When they were defeated in committee they simply dismissed
the vote as irrelevant.
''If you take that attitude then what is the point of having a Staff
Commission or even, for that matter, votes in Parliament?''

THE academic overkill to which the work of Samuel Beckett has been
subjected can encourage the impression that a piece like Waiting for
Godot is an abstruse, esoteric and, above all, difficult enigma. What
Kenny Ireland's Lyceum production gloriously reminds us is that Beckett
was a writer who understood the mechanics of the theatre and, even while
he was stretching those mechanics to the full, knew how to write great
parts for actors.
I say this not to underestimate the impact of the play's many
resonances, rather to suggest that it takes a lively, irreverent and
theatrical team of actors, not a heavy directorial concept, to release
those resonances. And here they are released in full glory, from
music-hall knockabout to self-doubting angst, in a production that plays
for laughs with a piece that is seriously unsettling in return.
David Shaw-Parker and Tam Dean Burn as Estragon and Vladimir may look
and move like Laurel and Hardy, but their short-tempered relationship
and delight in daft diversions sets them closer to Reeves and Mortimer.
Appropriately, the Vic and Bob generation was out in force for last
night's free preview, lapping up Eric Barlow's Pozzo and Rab Christie's
Lucky like they were visitors to Fantasy Island.
The performers have developed a curious on-the-surface style of
acting, you see every emotion, every reaction rather like they were
children's TV presenters.
But for every dose of absurdist comedy there's a chilling moment of
empty yearning round the corner. Excellent stuff.

SCOTTISH Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton warned yesterday
that new powers being introduced on child care law in Scotland must be
treated with caution.
The Children (Scotland) Bill, currently going through its Commons
committee stage, brings in a number of new measures, many of which stem
from the inquiry into the removal of children from Orkney and the report
into child care policies in Fife.
One is the concept of exclusion orders, under which an adult accused
of abusing a child would be removed from the family home, rather than
the child or children concerned.
Lord James said: ''While there is universal agreement that it is the
abuser who should be obliged to leave the family home rather than the
child, there are very difficult issues which cannot be glossed over.
''The rights of the individual have to be taken into account and I
have some reservations on creating a situation where people could be
excluded from their own house without having an adequate opportunity
before an order is made even on an interim basis to defend themselves
against an allegation that might possibly be malicious.''

WALKERS, the crisp company, denied yesterday that television
commercials featuring footballer Gary Lineker encouraged children to
talk to strangers.
The Independent Television Commission is investigating 23 complaints
from viewers, in the main made because Lineker is shown stealing crisps
from a boy and a #10,000 cheque from a nun.
The commercials, which are part of a #10m campaign, could be dropped
if the ITC rules against them. It does not have the power to ban them.
It can only request that they be withdrawn.
An ITC official said: ''The main concern is that one advertisement
shows Gary Lineker stealing crisps and being chased by a small boy.
People think this might send signals that it is all right to walk away
with a stranger.''
Walkers said: ''In no way are the advertisements designed to encourage
children to talk to strangers. Gary Lineker is not a stranger, he is a
well-known personality and national hero.
''Walkers Snack Foods looks forward to hearing the final ruling by the
ITC.''
Lineker, the former England centre forward who now presents BBC sports
programmes after his playing career ended, was not available for
comment.
He is said to be receiving #750,000 for the advertisements. In one, he
is seen stealing a #10,000 cheque from a nun who finds her crisp packet
has a prize-winning blue bag inside. She shows him the cheque and he
fills in his name before running off.
Walkers said yesterday that justice would be done in the next episode.
Another nun, played by BBC sports presenter Desmond Lynam, will catch
the fleeing footballer and retrieve the cheque.

A LABOUR MP criticised Rolls-Royce yesterday after it announced
profits of #101m for 1994.
The aero engine giant, which is cutting 600 jobs at East Kilbride,
said it had lifted taxable profits from #76m the previous year.
However, Mr Adam Ingram, Labour MP for East Kilbride, found cold
comfort in the figures. He said the Rolls-Royce workforce in his
constituency had made a major contribution to the company's profits over
the years ''only to be rewarded with redundancy''.
Mr Ingram said the company's profit-driven approach had resulted
overall in thousands of jobs being thrown on the scrapheap.
''The recent announcement that 600 jobs are to go at East Kilbride
shows Rolls-Royce has put the pursuit of profits of the aerospace
industry first.''
The MSF union chairman at the plant, Mr Owen Thomas, said the profit
had not been unexpected. However, it was not sizeable for a company such
as Rolls-Royce and played straight into the union's hands, because East
Kilbride had been the major contributor towards it.
He said: ''We made #97m profit in 1993 and contributed the bulk of
1994's #101m profit. This only goes to underline that the board had got
it all wrong.''
Mr Owen was confident that they would eventually get the company to
change its mind on its ''transparently stupid'' decision to axe the jobs
at East Kilbride.
This would be brought about by a two-pronged approach -- a business
case backed by customers and a careful programme of industrial action.
Ballot papers on industrial action -- which would only be taken as a
last resort -- would go out within the next 10 days.
In the meantime the workforce hoped to have an emergency resolution
debated at the weekend at the Scottish Labour Party conference in
Inverness.
Sir Ralph Robins, chairman of Rolls-Royce, said in a statement that
restructuring at the company had continued ahead of plan.
At the year-end the workforce stood at 41,000, a reduction of 10% in
the year and more than 20% since the programme was announced in 1993.
During the year Rolls-Royce's job cutting cost #95m in restructuring
charges.
Sir Ralph added: ''Our 1994 results, despite lower sales, reflect both
the greater efficiency arising from our continued restructuring and the
successful development of the Trent 700 and 800 engines which have
passed significant milestones in the past year.''

BONNIE Charlie's coming back safely o'er the friendly main.
On August 19 the Young Pretender will return to Glenfinnan, to mark
the 250th anniversary of the Raising of the Standard there which
launched the 1745 Jacobite rebellion.
His reappearance is part of the celebrations of the event being staged
by the National Trust for Scotland announced yesterday in London, the
city Charles Edward Stuart failed to reach.
The re-enactment will take place before the opening of the annual
Glenfinnan Highland Games, and the end of the rebellion will be marked
on April 16, 1996, by a memorial service at Culloden.
Other events commemorating the '45 will include an exhibition in the
Clan Donald Library, Skye, showing the clan's role in the rebellion; an
exhibition of royal tartans in the Royal Museum of Scotland, including
the only proven one worn by a Stuart king; and Charlie's Year, an
exhibition in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum which will seek to
reveal the truth behind the myths. Other events will be held in the
Hebrides throughout the year.
The trust is looking to the National Lottery to provide it with the
funds for its work, Mr Douglas Dow, director of the National Trust for
Scotland said. A proposal seeking cash to allow it to operate the Mar
Lodge estate is currently being considered by the National Heritage
Memorial Fund, which will allocate the #150m the lottery is expected to
raise annually for heritage projects.
''The lottery is a marvellous thing for the heritage,'' said Mr Dow.
''The situation has changed out of all proportion and we may be able to
save a lot more of Scotland's heritage as a result.''

THE estate in Inverness-shire where the golden retriever was first
bred in the nineteenth century has been sold.
Sprawling Wester Guisachan was the location for a Pedigree Chum
television commercial which ran for 18 months.
An unnamed Dutch industrialist paid more than #575,000 for the
10,000-acre estate at the foot of Glen Urquhart.
The new owner intends to manage the estate along traditional lines.
The deer stalker has been re-employed and a farm partnership arrangement
is be continued.
Sir Dudley Marjoribanks, the first Lord Tweedmouth, started breeding
golden retrievers as gun dogs around 1835 on the estate, which was said
to have had some of the finest stags ever killed in the Highlands.
Records kept by his family show how he created the new breed from
carefully planned matings between yellow retrievers and two Tweed
water-spaniels.
The estate was originally part of Clan Chisholm and Fraser lands until
bought by Sir Dudley.

TWO Highland police officers based in popular climbing areas attacked
''nutter'' climbers who ignore avalanche warnings and urged them to stay
off the mountains when avalanches are forecast.
With police and mountain rescue teams bracing themselves for an
invasion of climbers this weekend -- despite renewed avalanche warnings
-- two officers regularly involved in co-ordinating rescue operations
launched a strong attacks on climbers who ignore a comprehensive
avalanche warning system which is paid for from the public purse.
A total of 14 people have died in climbing accidents in Scotland so
far this year while another six are still missing, including three from
West Yorkshire who are feared to have died in an avalanche in Glencoe.
The Scottish Avalanche Information Service, based at Glenmore Lodge
near Aviemore, receives #65,000 a year from the Scottish Office to
provide daily forecasts of avalanche conditions through the media and at
mountain resorts.
Avalanche risk information is also provided to climbers on a recorded
telephone information line and warnings are posted at all police
stations in the Northern Constabulary area.
Sergeant Bob Severn, who is based at Northern Constabulary's Aviemore
office, said yesterday: ''The readings help provide daily avalanche
reports and warnings are posted everywhere -- but very few climbers
appear to take any notice.''
A keen hillwalker, Sgt Severn said some climbers ''can only be
described as nutters'', adding: ''I would like to think that if more
people availed themselves of the facts about local weather conditions
then maybe we could reduce the number of deaths on the mountains. We
don't want to spoil people's fun, but the knowledge is there and should
be used.''
Inspector Sandy Mackenzie, who is based at Fort William police office
which co-ordinates rescue operations in the Lochaber area, said that
some climbers on excursions from far afield planned their trips for some
time and were reluctant to cancel their arrangements.
He said: ''The attitude some take is I've come all this way, so I'm
heading up into the hills come what may.''
He added: ''I can only plead that they will have more sense this
weekend and stay off the hills . . . it is looking very dangerous once
again.''
The Scottish Avalanche Information Service said yesterday that the
risk of avalanches in Lochaber and Glencoe would be very high and high
today and would probably remain high or considerable in those areas and
in Cairngorm this weekend.
The police officers' criticism was echoed by Mr Blyth Wright,
co-ordinator of the avalanche service, who said the service did not
describe its avalanche information as a warning but issued the
''advice'' in the hope that climbers would take notice.
A spokesman for Northern Constabulary in Inverness was not available
for comment yesterday.
Aviemore police office was at the centre of a rescue operation earlier
this week for two climbers from Cumbria who have not been seen since
they set off near the Cairngorm ski centre on Saturday.

I'm alone in the world
and have been for a
long time. To survive, I
say what I want to say and
do what I want to do
When I want a really
special memory I re-read
Bogie's love letters.
I've kept them all; he was
a very romantic man
The woman Bogie described as 'steel with curves' is still pretty
tough, reports Douglas Thompson
SHE arrived in Britain this week as capricious as ever with legs and
an attitude that sneer at the calendar. Pushing a Heathrow trolley
rather than a zimmer frame Lauren Bacall, 70 this year, had the airport
flashbulb crowd pop, pop, popping along. She prefers coffee first thing
in the morning.
It was not a time for deep discussion about whether or not she was
returning to the London stage for the first time in a decade. (Contract
talks are going on). Nevertheless, some hapless hack had been assigned
to press her on just that matter.
Now, Bacall is not quizzed. She's also not intimidated. And so far she
had only had the airline coffee. Her hair brushed wildly back she
dismissed her eager, earnest inquisitor with: ''Be a good boy, now.''
He was. We all would be. She has that confidence of the successful and
the assured. She will always get a taxi or attention first. She was a
legend when models illustrated knitting patterns and we didn't know
their names. The world has changed, but not New York-born Betty Joan
Perske who the movies called Lauren Bacall and her first husband
Humphrey Bogart said was ''steel with curves''.
All these years on, you still can't get away talking about Bacall
without Bogie, who died in 1957 after a long, painful fight with cancer.
He was 57. The couple had been married a little short of a dozen years.
She was 33. A lifetime loomed, but so did a legend. Bacall has accepted
it, but can be irritated that the man she fell in love with when she was
19 still dominates her life today. She'll say: ''There's no getting away
from Bogie -- damn it, let's deal with what I've done for years without
him.''
More mellow, it comes out this way: ''It was only because I was
married to Bogie that there was a myth of the movie star about me. I
don't think I've done anything to produce such a feeling. Bogie is the
big legend. He is a bigger star now than he ever was. He will live
forever.''
So, things won't change? ''I'll be fighting the battle until they
close the coffin. I'll be in there shouting, 'Just a minute . . . '''
Her autobiography By Myself was published in 1978 and was a runaway
bestseller. She is in the UK to publicise what could loosely be
described as a sequel. It is about her children (three), her dogs
(several past and present), homes (now a 10-room apartment in
Manhattan's landmark Dakota building that they wouldn't let Richard
Nixon into, but where John Lennon was living when he was shot) and the
December of life, dealing with the loneliness and, in her game, the
wrinkles.
She spouts Tinseltown heresy: ''What's so terrible about growing older
and having wrinkles? Well, don't ask the ladies of Baywatch.'' Much more
fun to listen to Bacall: ''I think the preoccupation with youth is
terribly depressing. It's as if the only alternative is suicide.
''A friend said recently: 'Oh, you've had your face lifted.' I said:
'Are you out of your mind?' Can you imagine a 'friend' saying something
so cruel. Listen, I've stuck with this face. God knows, there's room for
improvement. I've earned every one of my wrinkles. Cheese ripens with
age. Wine ripens with age. Why can't people? Does everybody have to be
plastic?
''I think I have value and worth as a human being. I've tried to be a
good mother and a good wife. I feel I'm a better friend, more than
anything.''
She talks positively. In Now, the feelings are more ambivalent. At one
point, she writes: ''I wonder if I will ever love anyone again or if
anyone will ever love me. I know how lucky I have been to once have had
in my life a man who loved me without reservation and whom I loved in
the same way. But that was long ago. Can it happen again? Will it? I
hope so.''
Off page, she's not so sentimental: ''Marriage again? Forget it! I'd
simply like to find somebody I could go out to dinner with, but I don't
meet anyone I can have a conversation with.
''There are very few eligible men around, and those I might be
interested in either have no self-confidence or they want 12-year-old
girls as lovers and I have no interest in that.''
''Steel with curves'' doesn't sound all that tough when it comes to
personal relationships today.
''People have always had the wrong impression of me. If I didn't have
a sense of humour I would probably have killed myself over some of the
things that people have said and written about me. They hear my deep
voice and think I'm tough. They think I'm always in control and can
handle any situation. Well, they're wrong.
''Listen, I'm alone in the world and have been for a long time. To
survive, I say what I want to say and do what I want to do. That's
always gotten me in trouble and I know it grates on those people who
wish I would just shut up. Why, sometimes I wish I would shut up. But I
can't analyse what people think of me. I can't change anything now --
it's too late.''
She met Bogart on the set of To Have and Have Not, a loose, 1944 film
reworking of Hemingway's story. She wasn't 20, he was 25 years older,
but the magic, the charisma, the whatever ''it'' is that makes a movie
or a love affair, sparked spectacularly on and off director Howard
Hawks's film set.
On screen, Bacall kisses Bogart and tells him: ''It's even better when
you help.'' Then, she says: ''You don't have to act with me, Steve. You
don't have to say anything, you don't have to do anything. Not a thing.
Oh, maybe just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? Just
put your lips together and blow.'' She walks out of shot and Bogart
purses his lips, blows a low whistle, and smiles.
If you squeeze your eyes and let memory flick the frames of her life,
she's never really changed that much. Bogart called her ''Slim'' in
their landmark movie and she always has been. Of course, she's aged, but
only in real life. On the video shelves she'll always be ''Slim'',
asking Bogie if he can whistle.
She says -- and she's used to the questions -- that her recollections
are not painful.
''Bogie was an extraordinary, sensational man, and I always had
tremendous admiration for him. God knows those were wonderful years -- I
have no complaints. But our life together was so many years ago. I'm not
sure I'm the same person now that I was back then. Why should I live in
the past? It's funny, but I don't think of 'missing' Bogie because he is
still alive in all the wonderful things he said to me and the moments
and events we shared.
''When I want a real special memory I re-read his love letters -- I've
kept them all. Bogie was a very romantic man. I only wish I'd kept his
trench coat -- getting rid of that was the stupidest thing I've ever
done.
''Bogie and I didn't have a perfect marriage. We argued. He drank.
When I married him I was a baby -- I was mindless -- and since I knew
nothing about marriage I was bound to get out of line. And I did. But
Bogie and I had a relationship. We had love. If he hadn't died I would
still be married to him. I would always have been married to him.''
Four years after Bogart's death she married the award-winning actor
Jason Robards. It followed a torrid but horrid affair with Frank
Sinatra, although she recalls now: ''I liked what I had of him. He was
interesting.''
With Bogart she had two children (Stephen who was born in 1949 and is
now a TV producer in New York, and daughter Leslie, born in 1952 and now
a yoga instructor in the city). Her marriage to Robards produced son Sam
in 1961. He's an actor, based in Manhattan.
Like Bogart, Robards drank. He doesn't anymore. but he didn't stop
sipping in time to save the marriage, which ended in 1969.
The clock ticked on. Bacall finds it a strange new world in which
actresses are required to do ever more for their craft. She is amused by
the marital merry-go-round in Hollywood, and says: ''It's the only place
in the world where an amicable divorce means that each gets 50% of the
publicity.''
In To Have and Have Not she was sultry and sexy, but revealed nothing
but her dental work. Just a shade more than 50 years later, actresses
are still trying to turn audiences on but are, well, rather more
forward. After Basic Instinct and the stunning success it provided for
Sharon Stone, scripts in Hollywood now include dozens of pages of
material reflecting naked ambition for box-office hits.
Bacall believes one pair of knickers too many have been dropped, and
prefers the style of yesteryear: ''Glamour was great, it was total
glamour in the movies, and it was so seductive you just wanted to be
part of it.
''It had such an aura and now it's kind of too graphic. Everyone knows
everything about how movies are made, what goes on, how special effects
are done, who wears what and who's doing it to who. I don't know . . . I
don't know . . .
''It's just too explicit in every direction. The great thing about
what we now call 'old movies' is that you were able to use your
imagination. You were able to envision whatever you wanted, whatever you
were able to imagine instead of having it all laid out in front of you.
''I think romance is almost a thing of the past as far as movies are
concerned. I think it's sad, because I think romance is something people
always want and look for. It's what you hope for, what takes you out of
your reality.
''I like sex as much as anyone, but don't wanna watch it on television
or on the screen in a movie theatre. I don't want to watch Michael
Douglas at it all the time, thank you. I really don't, cute as he is.''
What of today's female stars?
''Julia Roberts -- she's only 20 years old or something and she's
making a comeback. I mean, that's pretty stupid, isn't it?
''Sharon Stone, who came from nowhere, right, and she's been around as
it turns out but it's always one break that makes the difference. She's
made a noise and she's got kind of an old-time movie star look about
her, which is great. There's always a place for that, but who knows how
long any of these women are gonna last if it's only based on a small
thing.
''Madonna certainly was one person who made a wave, but I think she
was different because she was really so smart about selling herself in
such a major way that she's become almost a world unto herself. You
can't call her a flash in the pan; she's been around too long. For
actresses, you have to have some talent that's going to last.
''When I went out to California I was 18 and I didn't know anything
about anything,'' she said. ''Bette Davis was the big star -- she owned
the Warner Brothers lot. Barbara Stanwyck and Ann Sheridan -- they were
the top ones. And you had Garbo and Katharine Hepburn and Lana Turner,
Ava Gardner, Norma Shearer, and Joan Crawford. Endless women stars.''
But stars without power. Bacall agrees that men did and do run
Hollywood: ''It's still a chauvinistic town. Women have to struggle and
fight. The sex and violence -- I don't blame television to some degree
for doing that obvious kind of cheap stuff. It's not quality time that
is spent watching these shows. I think if women were more in control the
stuff would be better.''
But, she admits, women have never been in control. She's asked about
sexual harassment in Hollywood. She clearly doesn't regard it as some
new politically correct art form: ''That's always existed at any
business at any office. The casting couch theory was always true for
people in the theatre and in the movies. Lots of executives have their
girlfriends in movies. If they're lousy, they don't last very long.
''Maybe I should have paid more attention to my career. I made a lot
of mistakes in my life and I'm not foolish enough to think I will never
make another one. I've lived well, but I'm not going to sit around. I'm
going to keep moving. What else could I do -- sit around and give
soirees for the rest of my life? That's not where my head is at. If I
fall on my ass I'll pick myself up, dust myself off, and go on.''
She knows how to whistle.

BANNERS with advertising have been used successfully at noted
buildings in Glasgow, London, New York, even Edinburgh itself, but now
according to certain councillors in the capital they're ''tacky'' and
''a second-class idea''.
Yesterday the critics of displays which would be inserted into five
tapering sails planned for the entrance to Edinburgh's #37m
International Conference Centre, due to open this summer, found support
from an amenity watchdog which urged the developers to drop the idea.
The Cockburn Association said it had ''a certain empathy'' with
criticisms made by two councillors on Wednesday when the proposal,
debated before, returned to the district council's development control
sub-committee.
The committee rejected by six votes to five the proposal to
incorporate ''signage'' within the sails element of the main canopy
structure.
Councillor Billy Fitzpatrick described the idea as ''tacky'' and
accused the applicants of trying to wear down the committee.
Councillor Douglas McKay felt the centre was a first-class building
but advertising banners were ''a second-class idea''.
Mr Terry Levinthal, secretary of the Cockburn Association, believed
the centre should now accept defeat. The association did not like
''things hanging off buildings''.
The sails were included in the original design and have planning
approval. Material which would be inserted on either side of the 25ft
high vertical sails is the stumbling block.
The signage would either identify the centre or advertise a particular
conference.
A report to the committee highlighted their successful use at Glasgow
Royal Concert Hall, Edinburgh's National Portrait Gallery of Scotland,
London's Design Museum, and New York's Museum of Modern Art.
Councillors in favour claimed it was the most important building in
the city for the last 10 years and there had to be some advertising to
let the public know what was happening.
A spokeswoman for the centre said that it had taken on board what was
said at the meeting and was looking at suitable options.

David Belcher raves about the merchants of doom
ANY attempt to hymn the diffuse and bittersweet glory of Tindersticks
is bound to fail. What's their music like? It's a thing of shabby
gentility. It's like skeins of smoke, kinda blue and floaty.
Tindersticks' music is languidly propelled by multi-faceted lyrics which
were evidently written in a collaboration between Joe Orton, Edward
Thomas, and T S Eliot.
Tindersticks echo the Blue Nile, albeit with a greater air of
regretful resignation. Tindersticks may be the chamber-orchestral
version of Portishead. Crooning with doomed elegance, Tindersticks'
vocalist Stuart Staples could well be Bryan Ferry's younger brother.
But only if Bryan Ferry had a younger brother who was prone to 72-hour
drinking expeditions and undergoing baroque religious experiences in
strip clubs. And falling hopelessly in love with unsuitable women who
inevitably rebuff him. And only if Bryan Ferry wasn't merely a triumph
of style over content.
Above all, Tindersticks' music is complex without being difficult. So
despite the off-putting fact that jaded, know-all critics like me drool
over it, the Tindersticks are in fact easy to listen to, without ever
being facile.
Oh aye, yon critics blab on about ''Tindersticks' soiled romanticism
and obsessive melancholy'' and their penchant for ''subverting
miserabilism with dry wit''. Notwithstanding, decent God-fearing folk
can listen to Tindersticks and opine that, by gum, it's a bit funereal,
but they've got loads of knock-out chunes.
Tonight's sell-out crowd for Tindersticks' show at Glasgow's old
Athenaeum know all these things. They'll be looking forward to a
vigorous wallow in Tindersticks' woozy, moody, sombre, perverse, and
wholly compelling world. There will be strings attached, of course.
Thirteen sets of them, plus additional brass and woodwind.
All the better to perform some of the swirling, ominous stuff from The
Tindersticks' First Album which the sextet are usually unable to do
live, like City Sickness and The Not Knowing, as well as preview their
forthcoming second album, the laconically-titled and wholly-essential
Tindersticks' Second Album, released on the Polygram-offshoot label This
Way Up on April 3.
There's a song on the new album called My Sister, a bizarre yet
organic tour de force which sums up Tindersticks as well as any of their
creations. A spoken monologue underpinned by a jauntily-sinister musical
accompaniment, My Sister begins in somewhat mawkish childhood
reminiscence. It then encompasses mundane grotesquerie, bleak realism
and black comedy, before winding up standing at a graveside with tears
in its eyes.
Ah, but tears of laughter or tears of woe? Listeners may wind up
feeling unable to decide whether they've been mugged by Leonard Cohen or
Les Dawson, or both.
Reassuringly, Tindersticks' guitarist, Neil Fraser, has no time for
such airy posturing. He evinces a fetching modesty, opting to view
Tindersticks as down-to-earth artisans and not flouncing artists. How
else do you explain the band's decision to assemble all their record
sleeves themselves, even going so far as to hand-number and hand-crayon
some of their limited-edition singles? Of My Sister, Neil will merely
say that it is perhaps a little bit abstract, but definitely funny.
Tindersticks' audience: in this era of hideous blare at 143
beats-per-minute, who are your people?
''Forty-year-old lecturers . . . 15-year-old girls. There are some
records that you need to make an effort to get hold of, like ours . . .
and so the folk who've made the effort must have something about them.
But we carry on regardless. Some folk will like you; some folk won't.
''We're doing what comes naturally, which isn't always slow and
melancholy. But we aren't going to pander; to try to be more accessible,
whatever that means. We aren't going to go mindlessly up-tempo.''
Hurrah. I clutch my promotional CD copy of the new Tindersticks' album
to my breast, hotly. It is neatly hand-wrapped in a square of thick
brown paper, sealed with a blob of red wax bearing This Way Up's
imprint. So presented, it appears a useful gift and an everyday
surprise. Like Tindersticks.
* If you don't have a ticket for tonight's show, Tindersticks return
to Glasgow, minus the orchestra, on April 23 to play at the Garage.

An Aberdeen school is pioneering a scheme for promoting good
discipline in the classroom. The carrot is a reward system for positive
behaviour, and the stick for pupils who breach the code is banishment to
the Remove.
CLASSROOM indiscipline is the curse of teaching. It is persistent,
low-level indiscipline on the part of pupils that wearies teachers. The
most common types of bad behaviour include pupils talking out of turn,
being deliberately idle and avoiding work, hindering other pupils, and
eating in the class.
Indiscipline takes its toll on teachers and disrupts learning.
Research has shown that dealing with low-level indiscipline can cut
teaching and learning time by half.
At St Machar Academy, a 1200-pupil inner-city comprehensive in
Aberdeen, a survey of staff opinion confirmed the debilitating,
disruptive influence of such forms of bad classroom behaviour.
The headteacher, Doug Marr, recalled earlier this week: ''Discipline
came out as being a major concern of our teachers, as would be the case
in every school. Was there something that could be done to address the
behaviour which disrupts ordinary learning and teaching?''
Meg Price, the teacher in charge of the unit for pupils with social
and emotional behavioural difficulties, visited Bebington High in
Merseyside, a school which broke new ground in rewarding and promoting
positive behaviour.
Rowdy pupils who breach the Bebington code suffer the ''consequences''
of their actions, culminating in a spell in the Remove, a room where
they work under supervision until their parents come to school.
Meg Price came back to St Machar with the message that the initiative
could be adapted for the academy. The school's senior management and
senior pupils worked on producing a St Machar version of the classroom
partnership which has been in operation for less than a year. Many
schools are now involved in promoting positive pupil behaviour but none
has gone as far as St Machar.
Mr Marr and the staff most heavily involved -- Meg Price and assistant
head Paul Firth -- are careful not to exaggerate its impact but there
can be little doubt that it does work and is effective.
According to Judy Norton, head of the biggest department, English,
there is a calmer atmosphere about the school. ''More work is being
done, pupils have a greater understanding of why punishments are handed
out and argue less when they are imposed, and there's more of a feeling
among teachers that they should be looking to reward good behaviour,''
she said.
The partnership is for first, second, third, and fourth years, where
the vast majority of ill-discipline occurs. It is not intended to deal
with serious disciplinary incidents such as physical violence and verbal
abuse. St Machar, in common with other schools, has a procedure for
dealing with such incidents which are, in any case, rare.
The partnership is based on a code for pupils which requires them to
respect others and their property; enter and leave classes in a quiet
and orderly way; be prepared for lessons; do what they are asked at the
first time of asking; raise a hand and wait to be asked before speaking;
and stay seated unless they have been given permission to move
elsewhere.
The final two requirements can be relaxed, for example for PE, group
discussions in English, modern languages, art, and home economics
classes.
Pupils who behave well in each class are given a credit which goes
towards a certificate, or award, for each subject. Each department sets
its targets for the number of credits required for each award, which is
at five levels attainable through the school year -- merit, bronze,
silver, gold, and ultimately a diploma of excellence.
Said Mr Marr: ''The basis of the system is to praise and reward pupils
who conform to the classroom code, to try to change fundamentally the
climate in the classroom. Pupils are going to respond to the person who
responds positively to them, who values their contribution.''
Mr Firth said pupils enjoyed receiving awards, but it was also
important for teachers to have something positive to say to each
youngster in the class. ''It's bloody hard but it's a nice thing to do,
although I don't think we've seen the real pay-off from that yet,'' he
said.
There have, however, been teething problems. Some teachers have found
the emphasis on being positive difficult to come to terms with, seeing
it as a threat to the way they handle discipline in the classroom.
St Machar also has its Remove, which accommodates pupils who have
breached the code on five occasions in the course of a class lasting one
or two periods. They also remain there until their parents or guardians
come to the school to talk about the breaches of discipline with their
child and a senior member of staff.
''I think the vast majority of parents want us to get to grips with
the small minority who regularly disrupt learning and teaching. Some
parents are, however, expressing dissatisfaction because they are
constantly being summoned to the school to have their child released,''
said Mr Marr.
The Remove is not a nice place. The walls are bare and the room
contains the minimum of furniture. Pupils sit facing the wall and copy
material from textbooks, supervised throughout the day by a teacher.
They are not allowed to talk until permission has been granted, and may
leave only to go to the toilet and for lunch.
There are playground myths about the Remove being better than being
taught in the classroom, but the fact that 53 out of the 74 pupils who
have been detained do not return tells a truer tale.
Jade, a second-year pupil, has been in the Remove three times. She
said her present detention would be her last. ''It's not much fun. It's
quiet, stuffy, and you get bored a lot. It feels like a long day.'' She
had been in the Remove for three days -- for repeatedly talking back --
and said her mum was coming to the school the next day to secure her
release.
James, a first-year pupil, had also been in the Remove for three days,
and for the third time. ''Some folk get put in and show off about it but
I don't because I hate it. I live with my gran and grandad and they said
they'll leave me in until I've learned my lesson. I've learned it this
time.''
Pupils are as aware of the consequences of breaching the code as they
are of the rewards that go with being an ''honest citizen''. They start
each class with a clean slate.
As Meg Price put it: ''There is no discipline system which has all the
answers but, with the partnership, we're attempting to put the teacher
back in control in the classroom so that there is no diversion from the
school's central purpose of teaching and learning.''

AFTER 14 years at the top of Buchanan Street, Glasgow's Ewan Mundy
Gallery has relocated to a handsome new space in West Regent Street
which is more accessible and visitor-friendly. Mundy specialises in
top-class pictures from the first half of the century and has opened the
gallery with a stunning exhibition of work by that favourite Scottish
Colourist, Francis Campbell Boileau Cadell.
The show is a joy: full of colourful, angst-free pictures that
delight. No hand-wringing here, just unashamed indulgence in the good
things of life: the idyllic beaches of Iona, elegant Edinburgh New Town
apartments, and lovely women.
Cadell, by nature a wit and bon viveur, made hedonism into an art.
Mundy's star exhibit is Miss Don Wauchope, red-haired, beautiful and
aloof, in full glory wearing a big black hat and gold hoop earrings.
It's a magnificent picture, captured with an impressive economy of
means.
Cadell's passion for colour proved controversial. ''Vulgar screaming
farces . . . the drawing of which any schoolchild would be ashamed'',
raged one reviewer in 1920.
Yet the overall impression is of sunshine: a breezy-day Port Bhan,
cattle on the shore and a thatched croft perched by the deep blue sea
and miles of empty white beach. ''He captures the pulse of the place,''
says Mundy. ''The light in Iona is extraordinary. Cadell's colours, his
mauves, lilacs, azure, and turquoise blues are not exaggerated in any
way.''
Today when art has become so ironic and socially self-aware, these
refreshing, euphoric images of a less pressured era are to be treasured.

* ''LAID back'' is scarcely the image that springs to mind with
pedal-pushing: huffing and puffing to the top of the Mound is more like
climbing Everest for all but the dedicated physically fit. But,
anatomically at least, that's the concept which Edinburgh-based
Aerobikes are hoping will excite cycling enthusiasts, and win new
converts.
Believed to be Scotland's only cycle makers -- bringing the craft back
to the capital after a century -- designers Loren Hufstetler and Robert
Turner claim comfort, safety and efficiency are better achieved with the
rider in a reclined position, butt resting on a low-level seat and legs
stretching out to pedals over the front wheel.
At first sight it's uncomfortable and ungainly; but once ''recumbent
riding techniques'' are mastered the machine's better stability and
improved visibility through a windshield can rapidly translate into
confident commuting and long-distance biking. Had it been around in the
eighties, though, Norman Tebbit could hardly have commended it as a
passport to employment, with a pricey tag of #1150 to #1850. Despite
this, Turner and Hufstetler expect a waiting list, both home and abroad,
for their hand-built, luggage-accommodating velocipede. To order, phone
0131-657 5655.
* SPRING . . . and a young man's fancy (even a young woman's) turns to
thoughts of picking up a trinket at the High Street jewellers that
betokens undying affection.
All too often, alas, it's a rash choice -- for nickel in costume
jewellery can spark off an allergic reaction in sensitive skin. Your
partner may be itching to tell you, but doesn't want to hurt your
feelings. Thankfully, a solution is at hand: Skin Guard 2000, produced
in Scotland, sets up an invisible protective barrier against irritants.
Odourless and non-greasy, it's available in 30ml bottles, costing #2.99
at selected chemists or phone 0131-557 3622 for mail order. Then you can
grin and wear it.
* TAILPIECE: The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals is stepping up its efforts to eliminate ''cosmetic'' tail
docking with an appeal to the public to report suspicious cases. Docking
by vets is still allowed, although the Royal College of Veterinary
Surgeons believes it is unethical. If a new dog appears in your area
with its tail docked, contact a local inspector or the SSPCA's HQ on
0131-225 6418.

Anne Simpson reports from Milan as the latest Mob murders serve to
remind Italy about the evil of its darkest secrets.
SHOULDERS hunched, the head jutting forward at a rigid angle, Giulio
Andreotti already looks like a man with his neck in a noose. This week
the former Italian Prime Minister once regarded as the custodian of his
country's wellbeing and now accused of Mafia cronyism, pursued his new
role of frail septuagenarian during the trial in Reggio Calabria of
Salvatore Riina, charged with involvement in the murder of an appeals
judge in 1991.
For Andreotti the timing could not have been more disobliging, for
elsewhere the Mafia was once again reminding Italians of its monstrous
lust for blood. As Andreotti was denying any acquaintanceship with
Riina, boss of bosses, the capo of Cosa Nostra, Sicily's gang warfare
had claimed another three victims, bringing the number of assassinations
to 10 in just over one week.
So far no blame for the killings has been attributed but the
indications suggest an inscrutable power struggle within the Mob itself.
Riina's capture in 1993 left the organisation in disarray and was the
result of evidence given to the authorities both in Italy and the United
States by disaffected members of the clan. A fugitive for 23 years,
Riina headed the Mafia's Corleone stronghold in the hills south of
Palermo where his ruthless control gained him the nickname of The Beast.
Andreotti, seven times Prime Minister for the Christian Democrats and
for six years the governing party's Foreign Minister, is now not only
alleged to have had political links with the Mafia but to have been seen
embracing Riina in 1987, a gesture indicating oneness with the
brotherhood. Today these present murders, bodies hideously frozen by
gunfire in Palermo streets, serve to remind Italy about the evil of its
darkest secrets. And for the first time this painful confrontation
appears to have real meaning. The old, complicated acceptance of
treachery as some sort of demonic gene in the country's national life
seems finally in scant supply.
This significant change of mood began emerging three years ago after
the brutal death of Judge Giovanni Falcone and his wife. Falcone's car
was bombed because his effective pursuit of the Mafia had led beyond the
usual territory in the south to secret, bulging bank accounts in
Switzerland and to corners of laundered riches in Milan. Since then the
investigations by Milan's own magistrates into bribery and the illicit
funding of political parties have located connections with the Mafia,
placing all manner of notable names under scrutiny, but none more
''respectable'' than that of Italy's most prominent post-war statesman.
''Once the ball of thread began unravelling it was perhaps inevitable
it would lead to Andreotti,'' says one political observer in Rome.
''There had always been rumours but they were jokey rather than anxious
suspicions, yet in this country a man doesn't remain pivotal to politics
for around 45 years without doing deals with nasty people.''
Even so, Italy's already troubled equilibrium has been further damaged
by Judge Agostino Gristino's decision the other week that Andreotti will
stand trial in September on charges that he acted as protector and
friend of the Sicilian Mafia during his long stewardship of the country.
Thus the stage will be set for a remarkable courtroom drama in which
the prosecution will seek to prove that the 76-year-old politician was
''a man of honour'', the cynical gangland euphemism for full membership
of the Mob, and that Andreotti also carried out favours for the most
notorious criminal organisation in the world.
For his part Andreotti denies the charges, calling the trial
''unjustified'', its only advantage being that those who accuse him will
be ''examined and cross-examined''. The prosecutor's case is contained
in more than 86,000 pages of testimony from prominent Mafia pentiti, the
Italian word for turncoats. In return for leniency these men have broken
their vows of silence, and among them is Tomaso Buscetta who lives in
America under an assumed identity but, on several occasions, has
returned to Italy to finger both local and national politicians.
However, the most threatening evidence is said to come from
Andreotti's own Sicilian Christian Democratic proteges who finessed
mutually beneficial arrangements between the party and the Mafia because
of their common hatred of communism. And here, in fact, may lie a key to
Andreotti's staying power in other contexts.
All through his tenure as Italy's most stable politician his stand
against the communists ensured support from US governments and the
church. His outward adherence to Catholic orthodoxy on abortion and
divorce, for instance, always won Vatican approval, and indeed he
attends Mass every morning, claiming that whatever woes may have
befallen him, his religious faith and knowledge of his innocence
safeguard him from thoughts of suicide.
Always respected as a brilliant tactician, Andreotti insists that he
is not the target of a conspiracy aided and abetted by enemies in
America. But increasingly he looks like an old fixer who is running out
of luck. Last month his lawyers were unsuccessful in arguing that the
autumn trial should be transferred to Rome where it would be heard
before a special tribunal for criminal charges against government
ministers. Dismissing the plea, Judge Gristino set the event for Palermo
on September 26.
Andreotti faces 20 years in jail if convicted, and today when he
speaks to the judiciary or to the press his words are precise but light
as a whisper as if the very breath that carries them is rationed.
''If he has done these things,'' says Angelo Ponte, a lecturer in
politics, ''he is the devil incarnate, but if not, nothing will ever
compensate for his character destruction.'' But because the implications
of this whole business are so shocking many hope for Andreotti's
acquittal, otherwise his guilt, they say, will tell Italians something
terrible about themselves.

For weeks, an array of sweetie gifts
has been out on the shelves to
tempt shoppers. Deedee Cuddihy
considers the advent of the
chocolate Easter egg and tests
what's on offer -- with the help
of some volunteer experts
We are the third
biggest eaters
of cocoa in the
world after the
US and Germany
IF all the Creme Eggs made by Cadbury during the run-up to Easter this
year were stacked on top of one another, the pile would be 900 times
higher than Mount Everest (or so it's claimed).
To save you all the bother of measuring a Creme Egg and dividing it
into the height of Mount Everest to discover just how many eggs we're
talking about, let me tell you that Cadbury produce about 300 million of
those gooey, sticky things each year; 200 million of which are consumed
in Britain, the rest exported mainly to Canada and the United States.
Here's another statistic for you, one which is even harder to swallow:
chocolate sales in the United Kingdom now total more than #3000m
annually, making Brits the third biggest consumers of cocoa in the world
after the USA and Germany.
Although there has been a drop in the number of 15 to 24-year-olds --
the age group that consumes the most chocolate -- an increase in
snacking means that sales have continued to grow.
Chocolate buying at Christmas (#650m!) accounts for more than 20% of
annual sales, but hardly have we smacked our lips over the last of the
festive Milk Tray or an edible Santa than the confectionery companies
are gearing us up for Easter (not forgetting the preceding special days
devoted to St Valentine and dear old mum, of course), when we will spend
a further #226m on eggs, eggs, and more eggs, as well as an increasing
number of assorted chocolate animals including bunnies, ducks and bears
and (new this year) the dreaded Power Rangers.
As well as the Creme Eggs -- and it can't have escaped your notice
that other confectionery giants such as Mars and Nestle -- Rowntree have
now come up with their own versions to rival the Cadbury's original,
which first appeared in 1971 -- we also buy 80 million chocolate-shell
eggs every Easter.
Cadbury, according to an interesting little leaflet produced by the
company, brought out its first Easter eggs as long ago as 1875 and by
1931 chocolate eggs were being attached to an extraordinary range of
Easter gift items, everything from watches and necklaces to saucepans
and sets of cutlery which make today's novelty mugs and egg-cups seem
quite modest by comparison.
The Second World War brought chocolate-egg production to a halt
between 1940 and the early fifties, but in the swinging sixties, when,
according to Cadbury historians, many of the Easter traditions like
Easter bonnets, new clothes and egg-rolling were forgotten, ''Easter
eggs had come to represent the crucial gift and all the major
manufacturers worked hard to provide a variety of products''.
Of course, eggs at Easter are a lot older than Cadbury's. At one time
they were a forbidden food during Lent but came into their own again on
Easter Day, when they were given as presents, in decorated form, to
friends and servants.
I remember the Easter egg hunt of my youth in America when we would
look for hard-boiled eggs whose shells had been delicately coloured with
special dyes. What I can't remember is what effect eating as many as six
hard-boiled eggs in one day had on me.
To say that these days we are spoiled for choice where chocolate
Easter eggs are concerned would be an understatement, although it's
worth pointing out that in 1925 Fry's Easter range comprised 50
different items, including chocolate bears, lions, pigs and elephants.
Now there is a foil-wrapped Easter egg in a fancy cardboard box to go
along with any chocolate bar you can think of.
A more recent development is something called character merchandising
where the product is tagged, not to an existing bar or brand of
chocolate but to a well-known character such as Postman Pat or Rupert
the Bear. Kinnerton, a British confectioner, was a pioneer in this field
when it first set up in business some 15 years ago. Its range now
includes numerous Beatrix Potter characters and while the confectionery
is, no doubt, excellent, it is Peter Rabbit and his chums and the
novelty packaging which attract consumers.
Always on the look-out for new ways to get us to spend even more money
on their products, confectioners must have been delighted with recent
claims that chocolate is actually good for you. The London-based
magazine, Natural Products News, reported that ''the main saturated fat
in chocolate is stearic acid, which is metabolised in the body to form
oleic acid, the mono-unsaturated fatty-acid that occurs in olive oil,
and which is widely considered to be good for the heart''.
So, who knows? Cadbury's and the like may soon be exhorting us to ''go
to work on a chocolate Easter egg''.
No article about chocolate Easter eggs would be complete without a
taste test of some of the hundreds of products available and without too
much difficulty, we persuaded the Lynas family -- Arthur, Monique and
daughters Kerry, and Eilis (nine-month-old Siobhan was asleep most of
the time) -- to try out a few on your behalf. Elizabeth Shaw
Chocolatiers supplied four examples for the test and the others were
bought from a variety of retail outlets.
At the end of a gruelling two-hour session, we were all feeling
somewhat jaded. However, it was generally agreed that the Kinnerton
Barbie milk-chocolate egg (#1.99 including badge, heart-shaped sweets
and cut-out bookmark) and the Elizabeth Shaw milk chocolate egg with
assorted truffles (#3.99) tasted the best and that the Power Rangers
milk-chocolate egg with jellies (99p exclusive from Woolworths) was the
least nice.
We also tested four creme eggs -- Cadbury's, Mars, Rolo (approximately
26p each) and Thornton's Champagne (49p) -- with the Cadbury's coming
out best followed by the Thornton's and the Rolo. No-one liked the Mars
egg.
In addition, we tried some Boots diabetic chocolate drops (95p a bag)
which everyone enjoyed; a carob non-dairy, non-chocolate egg (#1.05)
which I loathed but everyone else said was okay but not at all like
chocolate, and two environmentally and politically correct chocolate
bars, one orange-flavoured, the other with banana (approximately #1.70
each from Grass Roots in Glasgow), which everyone else loathed, but I
thought were far superior to everything else we tested.

A BOSNIAN girl scarred by a sniper's bullet which almost killed her
cuddled up to her father yesterday in a Scots hospital after a mercy
flight from her war-torn country.
Blonde-haired Dzenita Kurbegovic, who could have an operation next
week to rebuild a life shattered two years ago a by bullet, faced up to
media interest, despite an exhausting journey from Croatia.
The nine-year-old, who has speech, breathing and eating difficulties
caused by the throat wound, heard her father Shemso pay tribute to those
who had made it possible for her to travel to Edinburgh's Royal Hospital
for Sick Children.
Her few words as she prepared for a three-day spell of assessment by
medical staff brought no problems for the interpreter. ''She wants to
say cheerio,'' he told reporters.
The medical mission involving Dzenita, said to remember vividly the
day she got caught up in crossfire, was made possible by cash support
the Edinburgh Direct Aid charity.
Treatment at the hospital was recommended by Colonel Michael Staunton,
a Scots senior medical officer serving with the UN force, who knows the
hospital well through being involved in fund-raising for it.
Lothian Health Board has agreed to meet the costs, and hospital
administrators stressed neither patients nor people on waiting lists
would be inconvenienced or held back. Staff were working extra hours to
help the little girl.
Mr Graeme Millar, chairman of the hospital trust, said he was
confident the staff would do their best for a little girl whom many
people had taken to their hearts.
This is the first time the hospital, which has been on stand-by
before, has received a victim of the Bosnian war.
Shemso, a fabrics factory worker and father of two other daughters,
thanked ''the special people'' who had made it possible for her to
travel and ''all people with a big heart''.
Mr Kurbegovic said there were many Bosnian children in the same
position and he pleaded for people's help.
At that point Dzenita got her chance to say ''cheerio,'' but not
before she managed three other words -- ''war is terrible''.

<HEADLINE>Labour leader is strong on public ownership but shy on Clause 4 form Blair commits to win over the undecided</HEADLINE>

LABOUR leader Tony Blair will today reaffirm his commitment to public
ownership in a desperate effort to persuade undecided delegates at
Labour's Scottish conference to back his proposal to rewrite the party's
constitution.
Although his speech this afternoon before the conference in Inverness
is being billed as the clearest signal yet of his intentions, Mr Blair
will stop short of revealing his preferred form of words to replace the
current Clause 4.
He will instead set out what principles he wants Labour to enshrine in
its new constitution and will appeal to the Scottish party to back him
by conceding that, without Scotland, Labour cannot win an election: ''By
working together we can achieve what we cannot do alone.''
He will tell delegates that there is more than devolution on offer.
Democratic renewal for Scotland will come with partnership in ''new''
Britain, ''a Britain where individuals flourish in a community in which
rights and responsibilities are recognised, where power, wealth, and
opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few, where poverty and
prejudice are overcome, and where we act together to realise the
potential of all.''
He will say Scottish values are Labour's values -- social justice, the
fight against poverty and discrimination, belief in solidarity. To those
who accuse him of being interested only in the south, he will say that,
without a Labour Government in London, there will never be a Scottish
Parliament in Edinburgh.
Mr Blair will say that, far from being a distraction, the debate over
Clause 4 has strengthened the party by attracting new members. He wants
a constitution which makes clear the party's principles and values in
terms ''that cannot be misrepresented''.
A number of drafts for the new clause are in circulation but
leadership sources insist that a final draft has not yet been prepared.
It will be drawn up by Mr Blair and deputy leader John Prescott and
submitted to the party's national executive committee on Monday.
Last night, Mr Blair's staff said he acknowledged that the debate
would have been easier had there been an alternative form of words for
public discussion. His appearance at the Scottish conference is the last
of a series of addresses across the country.
Mr Blair has been under pressure to provide reassurances on public
ownership as a means of heading off an embarrassing defeat. He will say
he sees a role for public ownership but will disappoint traditionalists
by calling for the constitution to express support for a strong private
sector.
Critics of change who believe the current commitment to the common
ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange will be
told to argue their case.
A TINY number of the 500 delegates have it in their power to boost
their leader's modernisation of the party or to deliver a humiliating
setback, writes Robbie Dinwoodie, Scottish Political Correspondent.
Both sides in the Clause 4 debate emerged happy from the compositing
process which reduced 26 motions and several amendments to a single
issue: will the 1918 wording aspiring to common ownership survive into
the twenty-first century?
The party's Scottish secretary, Mr Jack McConnell, normally given to
bullish, upbeat assessments, admitted that, with the unions evenly
divided, it was down to ordinary representatives of the rank and file to
call the shots.
''There are two clear positions,'' he said. ''One is that the current
Clause 4 should remain unaltered. The other is the call from the Unison
trade union for a redraft.''
However, supporters of the Campaign for Socialism later made the point
that their motion, while leaving the existing wording intact, did allow
for additions which could modernise its sentiments. This position --
known in internal party jargon as Clause 4 plus -- was seen as having
the potential to sway many waverers who want to modernise the party and
support Mr Blair without jettisoning traditional principles.
However, the left also agreed that the outcome was in the balance.
Campaign co-convener Mary Picken said: ''It all comes down to perhaps a
couple of dozen unmandated constituency delegates. I wouldn't bet on the
outcome, and I'm a betting woman.''
The wording which will be supported by the party leadership today
recognises that the current clause needs to be ''toughened and
sharpened, defining Labour's fundamental principles and values in a
clear and up-to-date manner''.
It calls for a reaffirmation of commitment to public ownership where
justified on grounds of efficiency and equity.
The traditionalists call for Clause 4, and its crucial fourth section
to ''remain unaltered in any redrafted constitution'' because they
represent the ultimate object of Labour's democratic socialism. It does,
however, support a review of the constitution provided it clearly
declares commitment to a public sector, full employment, and social
control of medicine, transport, education, and public utilities.
The campaigners have also inserted a reference to reinvigorated and
devolved local government and to a Scottish parliament based on gender
equality -- a deliberate addition given that Mr Blair this week appeared
to cast doubts on the practicality of this.

<HEADLINE>Supermodels too big for their boots, says designer</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
Rome, Thursday,
ITALIAN designer Gianfranco Ferre today said supermodels had become
too big for their boots and had helped turn Milan's twice-yearly fashion
shows into a circus.
''Fashion is becoming a circus. The top models are in decline, with a
few exceptions, and they have abused their roles,'' said Ferre, who will
show his autumn and winter 1995-96 collection tomorrow.
''There are even those who come to Milan, like Claudia Schiffer and
Naomi Campbell, to publicise their books,'' he told Corriere della Sera
newspaper in an interview.
The interview was published hours before Schiffer, one of the
industry's top models who is paid about $10,000 a show, began signing
copies of her new book, Souvenirs et Confidences, (Memories and Intimate
Details) in Milan.
Hundreds of young and old people thronged the bookstore in Milan to
catch a glimpse of the German blonde as she signed autographs and smiled
for the cameras.
Last year, Campbell was in the spotlight, promoting her ghost-written
novel, Swan, an inside look at the modelling industry, and her record
album Love and Tears.
Last October, during the spring and summer fashion shows, Campbell
only appeared in two fashion shows, Prada and Versace, because she was
too busy to do the rest.
Modelling agents say Ferre is wrong and that the supermodels have a
right to do more than just stride down the catwalk.
''The supermodel is not in decline, she's going stronger than ever,
and now she has more commitments,'' said David Brown, a modelling agent,
who represents Campbell and Carla Bruni.
''Ferre's comment is unjustified. Unfortunately, the top girls like
Naomi now have other commitments that are just as important as
modelling,'' Brown said.
No matter what side of the catwalk they are on, the supermodels are
treated like celebrities.
Before the Prada show today, Schiffer was backstage getting a massage
and Campbell was dogged by reporters and photographers.
Miuccia Prada showed off a collection which either flattered models'
figures or turned them into frumps.
There were neat navy or black cashmere coats, double-breasted coat
dresses, and grey suits whose trim-waisted jackets puffed out around the
hips. Black and white leopard print skirts and jackets were also
featured.

GREATER commercial freedom for the Post Office, including the removal
of all restrictions on the business activities of sub-postmasters, while
retaining a core number of Crown Post Offices was urged by a powerful
committee of MPs yesterday.
At the same time, Labour pledged to halt the closure and franchising
of post offices if it wins the next election, and joined the Union of
Communications Workers in campaiging for the retention of the remaining
750 Crown offices.
The all-party Trade and Industry Select Committee was unanimous in its
call for legislation to convert the service into a 100% Government-owned
plc, outside of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, as a way of
loosening the financial ties with the Treasury.
Board of Trade President Michael Heseltine had wanted to sell off 51%
of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce while retaining PO Counters in the
public sector, but was forced to pull back for fear of a rebellion by
back-bench Tories.
In evidence to the committee in January, Mr Heseltine left no doubt
that he would still like to privatise, and it is believed that if he
does accept the committee findings, it is likely to be on the basis of a
compromise towards possible privatisation at a later stage -- although
presumably not before the next General Election.
Labour trade and industry spokesman Brian Wilson suggested the report
left Mr Heseltine ''isolated and petulant'', and said ''he should now
show some respect for public opinion and the conclusions of the
all-party committee by adandoning privatisation once and for all.''
The MPs concluded that continuing uncertainty over the future was only
benefiting foreign competitors.
Their recommendations included: Legislation to convert the Post Office
into a 100% Government-owned plc; sale of Government shares subject to
parliamentary approval; removal of restrictions on the activities of
sub-postmasters; and a minimum acceptable number of post offices,
including Crown offices.
The report states: ''No solution will be perfect, but we believe that
the plc option is the only realistic opportunity available at present.
It would enable greater commercial freedom in the short term, and pave
the way for a successful future in either the public or private
sectors.''
Committee chairman, Labour MP Richard Caborn, said converting the Post
Office into a limited liability company with the Government as sole
shareholder was the best way out of the present ''malaise''.
Post Office chairman Mike Heron ''applauded'' any proposals that would
lead to genuine commercial freedom.
Mr Bill Cockburn, PO chief executive, said: ''The select committee
report is very supportive and we look to the Government to respond
quickly and decisively. We want the Post Office of the future to be a
dynamo, not a dinosaur.''
The Communication Workers' Union welcomed the report and said the main
recommendation to convert the Post Office into a Government-owned plc
was ''imaginative''.
Mr Colin Baker, general secretary of the National Federation of
Sub-Postmasters said the federation was ''extremely pleased''.

Brussels, Thursday
THE European Union yesterday took a step closer to setting up its own
cross-frontier intelligence agency, Europol, which will fight organised
crime.
But progress was slowed by Britain whose Home Office Minister of
State, Mr Michael Forsyth, warned that the British Government is worried
at the prospect of the European Court of Justice (CoJ) having an
overseeing role in the agency's work.
The Government's view of the Luxembourg-based court has been soured by
a series of judgments which have gone against Britain in recent times.
If EU plans are adopted, the court would have jurisdiction in
Europol's work, a fact which would infuriate Conservative Eurosceptics
and provide another stick with which to beat Premier John Major.
Mr Forsyth told reporters: ''We are anxious to see Europol up and
running, but we underlined our reservations about the involvement of the
CoJ.
''This is an inter-governmental matter and we don't see there is any
role for the CoJ. It is important it should remain inter-governmental.''
Europol exists already in embryo form in The Hague. It is currently
the European Drugs Unit.
Eventually, once agreement is reached, it will work with EU member
states' police forces combating a series of cross-border crimes
including drug trafficking, car theft, illegal immigration and the
so-called ''trade in human beings'' mostly involving refugees who are
bought and sold for cheap labour.
Ministers want Europol eventually to tackle terrorism but not until it
is established and working smoothly, perhaps two years from its
start-up.
The new agency will have no active units and the EU has been at pains
to play down the idea that it will be Europe's answer to the American
FBI.
Europol will, instead, be mainly a data base for cross-border criminal
intelligence and will act as a liaison agency with various police
forces.
For the past few months, member states have been bickering over the
question of how much sensitive information can be made available by
Europol and to whom.
Ministers have now made progress towards resolving this question by
setting up an elaborate scheme in which intelligence will be graded
according to sensitivity.
Some will be readily accessible to any police force but the more
sensitive intelligence will only be released once police forces have
satisfied Europol and, if necessary, other states, that a ''need to
know'' genuinely exists.
The French, holders of the rotating EU presidency, want the Europol
issue agreed before they hand over the leadership of the community to
Spain in July.
A special informal meeting of home affairs and justice ministers is
scheduled for next month before a meeting in June, just before the
Cannes summit, when final agreement should be reached.
The EU believes an effective Europol is essential if the new single
European market with its disappearing border posts is not to be
exploited by organised crime.
The Community is concerned that public worry about border insecurity
and crime does not express itself in the blocking of further European
integration.

<HEADLINE>Defence Secretary over-rules advice and gives a jobs boost to Westland Rifkind puts Britain first in copter deal</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979468539</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DEFENCE Secretary Malcolm Rifkind tookthe unusual step of over-ruling
his Accounting Officer to order British helicopters and save thousands
of jobs in a #1200m deal, it emerged last night.
A decision to buy a purely American fleet of Chinook helicopters would
have saved the taxpayer #300m.
However, the Government decided that the need to safeguard jobs and
retain a UK helicopter manufacturing industry was more important.
Consequently, the RAF is to get a mixed fleet of 22 Westland EH101s
and 14 Boeing Chinooks.
The long-awaited decision -- strongly opposed by senior RAF officers
and civil servants -- was warmly welcomed by MPs of all parties,
Westland and its workforce.
Mr Rifkind revealed he was forced to issue a directive to his
accounting officer, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, the Chief of Defence
Procurement, before the deal could proceed.
Dr McIntosh objected to the planned purchase on the grounds of value
for money.
The need to set up an EH101 support infrastructure from scratch meant
it was much more expensive than the Chinook, as the RAF already operates
a 32-strong fleet.
Boeing, which agreed to place work to the value of the contract with
British industry, had offered to double that deal to 200% the value of
the contract if just the Chinook was chosen.
Mr Rifkind, who stressed there were precedents for issuing directives
to accounting officers, said: ''He looks at the very narrow sense of
value for money ensuring the least expensive way of meeting a
requirement.
''But there is the need to ensure our armed forces have the helicopter
lift capability required; second, the necessity to retain a military
helicopter manufacturing capability in the UK and third, we look at the
wider employment and industrial benefits that flow.''
Dr McIntosh eventually concluded the overall benefits outweighed the
costs.
The Government has already invested some #1500m in the development of
the EH101 family, central to Westland's comprehensive design and
manufacturing capability.
Mr Rifkind said it had excellent export potential in both its military
and civil variants, from which the Government would derive substantial
benefit through the levy on sales.
''Our decision demonstrates the confidence that we have in this new
British aircraft,'' added Mr Rifkind.
First deliveries would be in 1999 and the announcement would increase
the military's medium support helicopter capacity by some 70%.
''It will help to secure the future of the UK helicopter design and
manufacturing capability and so strengthen the UK aerospace industry,
which provides important opportunities for UK suppliers as well as
technology and skills both within and outside the aerospace industry.''
He said a number of countries had expressed serious interest in the
EH101.
Shadow Defence Secretary David Clark said: ''We very much welcome the
announcement, for the Labour Party has always championed the Westland
EH101. We think the news today is important, not only for the armed
forces but also for the UK defence industry.''
It was ''absolutely vital'' that the UK maintained its
helicopter-building capability, added Dr Clark.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, whose Yeovil constituency
includes the main Westland plant, declared: ''This order, though late
and less than originally promised, is nevertheless very welcome.
''It is a vote of confidence not only in the aircraft, but also in the
workforce and the management that have produced it.''
He said the decision opened up the possibility of wider use for the
EH101, which could become a Nato standard.
The order will help safeguard 6000 jobs at Westland and thousands more
at 200 sub-contractors, including Rolls-Royce, Lucas and GEC-Marconi.
It was received with a mixture of relief and rejoicing in Yeovil, home
base of the helicopter manufacturer.
News of the deal was delivered to the Westland factory by Roger
Freeman, the Defence Procurement Minister.
Addressing several hundred employees in the EH101 assembly hall, he
said: ''It is important we retain in the UK and here at Westland the
capability of designing and manufacturing helicopters, both civil and
military.''
Sir David Lees, chairman of Westland parent GKN, said he was delighted
by the announcement.
''This is very good news for Westland. We have always been convinced
that the EH101 was the right aircraft to meet the needs of the RAF.
''There is considerable interest in all variants of the EH101 in the
Middle and Far East, where a vigorous marketing programme is already
under way.
''This latest order, together with civil certification by the British,
Italian and US authorities last November, will further strengthen our
position.''
The Mayor of Yeovil, Tony Fife, was ''delighted''.
He said: ''It is splendid news but long overdue. Westland is
fundamental to the economic being not only of Yeovil, but of south
Somerset and north Dorset.''

Sarajevo, Thursday,
CEASEFIRES in Bosnia and Croatia are beginning to unravel, according
to United Nations special envoy Yasushi Akashi, who appealed to
combatants today to avoid sliding back into war.
Bosnia's current four-month ceasefire is regarded as more unstable
than Croatia's, which has generally held since 1992, and Akashi planned
urgent talks with Bosnian government and separatist Serb factions in the
coming days.
But UN sources said little hope remained in the peacekeeping mission
that Bosnia's ''cessation of hostilities'' accord, which expires on May
1, can be salvaged.
''The ceasefire agreement is dead in the water,'' said one UN official
who asked not to be identified.
Akashi said the ceasefire forged by Croatia and rebel Krajina Serbs a
year ago was also ''progressively degrading'' in the wake of Zagreb's
decision to cancel the mandate of 12,000 UN peacekeepers effective from
April 1.
He said the number of truce violations along the UN-patrolled
separation line between the two parties had risen from 140 at the end of
December to 220.
Bosnia's UN-brokered ceasefire, signed on December 31, is become
increasingly unstable around Sarajevo and elsewhere.
''Unless the parties to the conflict renew their commitment to the
cessation of hostilities agreement, a further deterioration of the
ceasefire in the coming weeks is almost inevitable, with all its dire
consequences,'' Akashi said.
''Both sides are clearly undertaking military preparations in
violation of the spirit of the agreement,'' added Akashi, the civilian
head of the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) in a statement.
Peacekeeping troops faced new restrictions on their movement and both
the Muslim-led Bosnian government and Serb forces were violating the
Nato-backed UN ban on military flights over Bosnia with increasing
frequency.
He also accused the Croats and Krajina Serbs of military
preparations.--Reuter.

Erez, Gaza Strip, Thursday.
ISRAELI Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO chief Yasser Arafat
today set July 1 as the deadline for a detailed accord on a West Bank
troop withdrawal and Palestinian elections.
A timetable had eluded negotiators for months, amid deadlock over how
to expand Palestinian self-rule to the West Bank without endangering
Israelis, and today's announcement was seen as a much-needed
breakthrough in the bedeviled peace process.
United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher welcomed the
success on arrival in Tel Aviv today, less than an hour after the
announcement.
''I congratulate him (Peres) and his team on the progress in
unblocking the negotiations,'' Christopher said after arriving in Israel
on a new Middle East shuttle in which he hopes to break the persistent
deadlock between the Jewish state and Syria.
Christopher arrived from Cairo on the second leg of his Middle East
mission and will meet Arafat in Gaza tomorrow.
Tonight, after a 90-minute meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and Peres, he said: ''My strong perception is of a renewed
commitment on their part to push ahead in seeking the comprehensive
peace in this region.''
Peres and Arafat were relaxed and smiled after their two-hour meeting
at a joint Israel-PLO command station between Israel and the PLO-ruled
Gaza Strip.
''I would consider it as a breakthrough in the second stage of our
negotiations,'' Peres said.
In the first phase, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank town of Jericho last May, turning over control to Arafat and the
Palestinian police.
Palestinian Economics Minister Ahmed Qureia, who participated in the
meeting, agreed the statelemate was over.
''I think the breakthrough is Israel's commitment to a specific
date,'' Qureia said. ''This time, I'm optimistic about the date.''
Under the initial Israel-PLO accord, Israeli troops were to have
withdrawn from Palestinian towns in the West Bank by mid-July 1994, and
the pullout was to have been followed by Palestinian general elections.
But Israelis balked at ceding West Bank land after Islamic militants
carried out a rash of suicide attacks, killing 56 Israelis since last
October.
Rabin said he considered the time until July 1 as a test period in
which Arafat must prove he can foil attacks by Islamic militants. ''The
only and the main obstacle to moving ahead with the Palestinians is
terrorism,'' Rabin said.
Arafat talked at length about a new security policy. ''I want to
confirm again that we understand the Israeli security needs,'' he said
in a joint news conference with Peres. ''We are doing the best we can in
this regard.''
He hinted he would meet one of Israel's key demands and disarm his
militant opposition, saying he planned to license guns and crack down on
arms dealers.
''We will not hesitate in confronting those who are carrying out acts
of violence and try them before special courts,'' Arafat said.
Peres repeatedly referred to Arafat as ''rais,'' using the Arabic word
which can mean president or head. ''I like the name. I'm studying
Arabic,'' Peres said.
Arafat thanked Peres for what he perceived as a concession by the
Israeli leader. Israel has not recognised Arafat's claim to be president
of the would-be state of Palestine.
Christopher's six-day tour of the region, his first this year, will
also take him to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria and he will be hoping
that any mood of conciliation in the air may prove infectious.
Rabin, who has resisted Syria's long-standing insistence on a full
Israeli pullout from the Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 Middle East
war, said: ''I would like to make it clear: we are capable to achieve
peace with Syria. We want to achieve peace with Syria.''
Referring to Israeli-Syrian talks suspended since December, Rabin
added: ''I believe there is no reason why we shouldn't continue these
negotiations.''
Israeli officials, citing the impact of elections in the United States
and Israel next year, have called 1995 a now-or-never opportunity for
peace with Syria.--Reuter/AP.

RUSSIAN artillery pounded separatist Chechen villages today despite a

Refugees poured out of the Achkhoi-Martan district west of the
devastated Chechen capital Grozny and said the Russians were still
firing on settlements. White flags fluttered from their ramshackle
convoys.
In Moscow, Yeltsin told three European foreign ministers he intended

<TEXT>
US-STYLE ''boot camps'' where young offenders are sent for a taste of
military discipline could be introduced in Britain, Home Secretary
Michael Howard told the Commons yesterday.
He disclosed at Question Time that he and the Prison Service were
evaluating a study that had been undertaken on the camps.
Mr Howard told Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Sir Ivan
Lawrence (Burton -- Con.), to Tory cheers: ''I share some of your
enthusiasm for some of the facets of the boot camp system and I hope to
make an announcement shortly.''
Mr Howard and Sir Ivan have both visited ''boot camps'' in the United
States -- so-called because of their rigid discipline which includes
parade ground drilling.
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said last night: ''We have no
proposals to introduce such regimes in Scotland, but of course we will
watch the experience in England and Wales with interest.''
Mr Derek Turner, general secretary of the Scottish Prison Officers'
Association, said Mr Howard's suggestion on ''boot camps'' was a
''knee-jerk reaction'' to public opinion.
Mr Turner said that the Government had abolished detention centres,
believing they were too austere and rigorous.
He added: ''I start to wonder whether the Government knows what it is
doing and why it interferes so much with penal policy. It is driven by
dogma and knee-jerk reactions to public opinion.''
A spokesman for the Prison Service in England said last night that if
the camps were introduced in Britain there would be more emphasis on
vocational training, rather than ''square bashing''.
They would want to see young offenders achieve specific goals before
leaving the camps, with some indication they did not intend to
re-offend.
Sir Ivan had called for Mr Howard to introduce a pilot scheme based on
the US camps.
''These camps provide training in discipline and respect for other
people, which we have lost since the abolition of National Service. They
provide training in the work ethic and respect for other people in
society, particularly families.
''The advantages of this are beginning to percolate into the American
system and ought to be imitated here.''
In the United States, the camps operate on a rigid timetable, normally
starting with early morning runs, followed by periods of skill training,
parade ground drilling, and special sessions with social workers, who
try to discourage the inmates from re-offending.
British ''boot camps'' could replace some of the ''short sharp shock''
centres introduced by former Home Secretary Lord Whitelaw during the
early 1980s.
It has not been decided whether British camps would be run by private
companies or the Prison Service, the spokesman said.
Later, Tory Nigel Evans (Ribble Valley) called for a debate on the
prison regime.
He said: ''I could then have an opportunity to give my full support to
the military-style boot camps that are so popular in the US.''

Copenhagen, Thursday,
THE United Nations social summit, striving for a formula to end global
poverty, raced against a midnight deadline today to agree a blueprint
for narrowing the yawning gap between the world's rich and poor.
Hours before world leaders were due to start arriving in Copenhagen,
officials struggled to bridge their differences on the summit
declaration, which aims to eradicate poverty, slash unemployment and end
social injustice.
Although progress was made on key areas such as aid to developing
countries and debt, the wording regarding child labour, trade unions and
education remained unresolved.
Delegates from participating states, already under fire from aid
organisations who say the summit proposals are weak, prepared to
continue negotiations throughout the evening.
Government and political leaders from around 120 countries are due in
Copenhagen for what has been billed as the biggest summit in world
history.
Presidents Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Fidel Castro of Cuba and
Francois Mitterrand of France, as well as US Vice President Al Gore and
Chinese Premier Li Peng are among those who will attend the final
meeting tomorrow and Sunday.
Several thousand officials are already in the Danish capital, guarded
by more than 3000 police as they discuss ways of cutting debt, making
aid work harder and other vital issues for the world's 1.3 billion poor.
The whole week-long event will cost more than $30m.
Hundreds of charity, aid, peace and religious groups criticised the UN
conference today for not going far enough to rid the world of poverty.
They blame rich Western governments which are mostly cutting aid
budgets.
Meeting at a former naval base in Copenhagen, the ''alternative
summit'' presented its own resolution urging world leaders to close the
gap between rich and poor.
''No nation so dramatically divided has ever remained stable; no
frontier or force can withstand the despair and resentment that a failed
system is now actively generating,'' it said.
The document called for full and equal rights for women, cuts in
military spending, and an immediate cancellation of the debts of
developing countries.
As officials at the official UN World Summit on Social Development
tried to complete their declaration, the conference devoted its fourth
day to speeches on unemployment -- seen as a ''malaise of the modern
world''.
The meeting hear that out of the world's total workforce of 2.8
billion, more than 800 million people were either hunting vainly for
jobs or were underemployed.--Reuter.

LABOUR MP George Foulkes yesterday questioned how the Conservative
Party had managed to secure a #14m overdraft from the Royal Bank of
Scotland when some of his own constituents could not even get ''a few
hundred quid''.
Calling for a Commons debate on the funding of political parties, Mr
Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) highlighted claims that the
Tories were struggling to get funds.
He told the House during questions on next week's parliamentary
business that a debate was needed in view of a newspaper report that
Tory Party treasurer Lord Hambro ''has returned from a fund-raising trip
to Hong Kong empty-handed''.
He added: ''I think the Tory Party is in need of some assistance.''
Mr Foulkes demanded: ''I would also like to know why or how they are
able to get a #14m overdraft from the Royal Bank of Scotland -- chairman
Lord Younger of Prestwick -- and they haven't got any collateral.
''They don't own their headquarters. They have got no basis to get
that loan, when some of my constituents can't even get a loan of a few
hundred quid from the Royal Bank.''
Commons leader Tony Newton replied: ''I am sure Conservative Party
chairman Jeremy Hanley will be grateful for your offer of help.''

THEIR eyes met across a crowded room and in an instant they both
realised it was true. All the messages were there -- the body language,
the subtle signals given out one to another.
Could they resist the temptation to openly declare their relationship,
or would its strength and power forever remain shrouded in mystery?
Then, at last, it was clear for all to see. Yes, John Major and Paddy
Ashdown have absolutely no time for each other.
It has been building for some time, let's face it. Every time Mr
Ashdown gets on his feet in the Chamber these days there is a
perceptible groan from the Tory benches which manages to sort of waft
itself up to the Press Gallery as smoke rises to the ceiling of a room.
Tory eyes roll, eyebrows are raised, knowing smiles and glances are
exchanged, elbows nudged, guffaws released and probably unfortunate
comments -- none of which can usually be clearly heard -- are exchanged
across the floor.
Mr Ashdown duly does his stuff, to dutiful support and roars of
approval from his tiny band of faithful supporters, and Mr Major duly
knocks him down.
It is all a far cry from the days of the Gulf war when Mr Ashdown,
former commando and all sorts of other things which gave him
credibility, was actually listened to by Tory MPs and even the
Government Front Bench. What exactly he has done wrong in the interim --
apart perhaps, from winning almost every by-election in sight by miles
and trying just a little too hard to be all things to all men -- is hard
to discern.
Anyway, Mr Major's animosity could hardly be deeper or less closely
concealed. The Prime Minister had delivered to the House an explanation
of (apparent) shenanigans over electricity and so on which, frankly,
would have baffled dear old Rumpole of the Bailey and had even the most
experienced shorthand writers in despair.
Labour leader Tony Blair came back with a series of questions which at
least earned him praise from the Prime Minister for being ''a
distinguished lawyer,'' but there was no such accolade for Mr Ashdown.
He wanted the Prime Minister to ''cut out the waffle,'' and Liberal
Democratically propounded the theory that the real question was not what
was legally possible but what was right.
Mr Major swept him aside as one might an insect. ''Well, you are not a
distinguished lawyer,'' he witheringly told Mr Ashdown. If you let fly
like that I hope you are never sitting down when you have to take a cool
and calm decision on what is in the national interest.''
Elsewhere, there was a great deal of talk about the European Exchange
Rate Mechanism, with former Trade Minister Neil Hamilton to the fore on
the fact that interest rates in France had had to be raised by 1.5% this
week, notwithstanding the fact that inflation was virtually non-existent
and unemployment was standing at 12.5%.
This, he claimed enthusiastically, had been necessary to confirm
France's status as an ''economic vassal state of Germany,'' and was it
not therefore a cause for congratulation that the Government had not
been obliged to take the same course of action this week?
Mr Major chortled on about exchange rate turbulence, made clear
Britain would not in the foreseeable future be shadowing the
Deutschmark, and trumpeted the current performance of both British
industry and the British currency.
Much talk, then, about the franc and the mark. Not much trouble, as
far as he is concerned, for the John. But what price the Paddy?

THE Prime Minister yesterday was involved in fresh controversy over
the Government's handling of the #4bn sell-off of the electricity
generators National Power and PowerGen.
Amid noisy exchanges in the Commons, he produced a complicated legal
justification for what the Government had done -- which prompted an
angry response from Labour and a claim from the Liberal Democrats'
leader Paddy Ashdown that the public had been ''hoodwinked.''
Mr Major confirmed that the flotation had gone ahead after the
Treasury's lawyers advised that an impending review of electricity
prices was ''not material'' to the sale.
The admission brought an accusation from Labour leader Tony Blair that
the whole privatisation programme was tarnished by ''at best
incompetence and at worst double-dealing by the Government.''
Millions were wiped off the value of shares in the two companies after
the announcement on Tuesday by the regulator, Professor Stephen
Littlechild, of new curbs on electricity prices -- the day after the
start of trading.
Mr Major told MPs that although the Treasury and the Department of
Trade and Industry were aware Prof. Littlechild was considering a review
of prices the regional electricity companies could charge, he did not
notify them he was going ahead until after trading had begun on Monday
afternoon.
Nevertheless, he said the Treasury had taken independent financial and
legal advice at the end of last week on whether, in the light of the
possible uncertainty, the original share prospectus was still accurate.
''The legal and financial advice they received was that even if the
issue of price controls for the regional electricity companies was
reopened, that was not material to the share sale of the generating
companies,'' he said.
''It was in the light of that legal and financial advice that the
Treasury decided to proceed.''
The explanation failed to satisfy Labour. Shadow Trade and Industry
Secretary Dr Jack Cunningham last night wrote to Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke and President of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine demanding
an explanation over why the sale had gone ahead.
He said that the information that the regulator was considering a
review was clearly price sensitive and failure to disclose it to
investors amounted to insider dealing.
In the Commons, Mr Blair asked: ''Is it true that when Government
Ministers proceeded with the sale of electricity shares on Monday they
already knew that the electricity regulator was actively considering
making an announcement to cut prices?''
Mr Major told him: ''The fact is that Prof. Littlechild did not decide
to undertake his review until Monday afternoon, after trading had begun
in the shares of PowerGen and National Power. Although the Treasury and
the DTI were aware he was considering the possibility, he had not
notified them even on Monday morning, when stock exchange trading began,
that he had taken any decision to go ahead.''
Mr Major said the Treasury had taken independent financial and legal
advice at the end of last week on whether, in the light of the possible
uncertainty, the share prospectus was still accurate.
He told the House: ''The legal and financial advice they received was
that even if the issue of price controls for the regional electricity
companies was reopened, that was not material to the share sale of the
generating companies.''
To shouts of ''Rubbish'' from the Labour benches, Mr Major said the
generating companies were subject to a wholly different basis of
regulation. ''It was in the light of that legal and financial advice
that the Treasury decided to proceed,'' he said.

OSLO: A 32-year-old British citizen yesterday was convicted of
murdering a gay former doctor by stabbing him at least 20 times, the
Norwegian news agency NTB reported. Throughout the four-day trial in
Oslo Superior Court, Christopher Kirby maintained his innocence, saying
he had been to the Norwegian's apartment but did not remember stabbing
him.
The body of Tage Ansethmoen, 34, was found in his Oslo apartment on
November 23, 1991, shortly after he was paroled from prison. The former
doctor had been sentenced for the attempted murder of an 81-year-old
woman. The court was expected to sentence Kirby today, said NTB.

THREE children died yesterday after their mother phoned her husband
for help rather than the fire brigade.
Fire swept rapidly through their home in Bradford, West Yorkshire.
About five minutes were lost before rescue services arrived. By then a
girl of three and a boy of 14 months had died in their beds upstairs.
Their two-year-old brother died downstairs.
Mrs Razai Begum, who is eight months' pregnant, escaped from the
blazing house.
Assistant Divisional Officer Vincent Rolfe said: ''We were not
contacted straight away. She phoned her husband and as a result there
was a four or five-minute delay.
''The mother was in the bathroom and we think had smelled smoke, but
the fire was already well alight. She must have panicked.
''When we arrived the front and back doors were kicked in by
neighbours trying to help, but this allowed the air to get in and fuel
the fire.''
Mrs Begum had recently moved to the house with her husband, a taxi
driver. She was was detained in Bradford Royal Infirmary suffering from
smoke inhalation.
The cause of the fire is being investigated but there are not thought
to be any suspicious circumstances.

THE number of students at Scotland's higher education institutions is
the highest yet, according to figures issued today.
A bulletin published by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council
shows that the equivalent of 114,000 full-time students are being taught
this year, up 3% on 1993-4.
The increase includes a 4% overall growth in the subjects of priority
recruitment -- science, engineering, maths, and computing.
Mr John Sizer, the council's chief executive, said: ''In general,
universities and colleges have acted very responsibly and have coped
well with the difficulties arising from the new applications system.''
The controlled expansion in Scotland contrasts with the situation in
England and Wales, where a number of institutions have been financially
penalised after recruiting excess numbers of students.
The largest subject group was science, with 18,800 students (up 5%);
followed by business and administrative studies, 16,200 (up 2%);
humanities, languages, and mass communication, 15,000 (up 4%); and
engineering and technology, 12,500 (up 2%).

AN inquest jury last night saw a video showing the naked body of an
appendix patient who crawled among heating ducts in a hospital boiler
room to die.
The jury was shown a police video of the basement cranny in which the
remains of Mr Carlos Padillo were found, a month after he threatened a
nurse and disappeared from his ward at St Thomas's hospital in London.
The shocked hospital engineer who found the decomposing body told the
inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court how he began searching after staff
complained of a bad smell.
Mr Brian Shrubsole said he wriggled through a small gap and saw the
missing patient's body on January 20.
The video showed the body, still with surgical stockings on the legs,
huddled beneath the ducting.
The boiler room -- directly accessible only by a service lift -- was
on the third floor, eight floors away from the ward where Mr Padillo had
been recovering from surgery.
The inquest heard that Mr Padillo, 40, who had a drinking problem,
told doctors he had tried to commit suicide and wanted to die during his
routine operation.
After he disappeared early on December 22 last year, hospital security
staff and police with sniffer dogs searched the hospital and the
surrounding area.
The surgical gown he was wearing was discovered on a stairwell but no
other trace was found, the inquest heard.
On December 22, Mr Padillo got out of bed and threatened a senior
nurse with an intravenous painkiller pump unit. He then ran out of the
ward, smashing a fire-escape window as he left.
It was found he had a ''markedly'' low amount of oxygen in his blood,
suggesting a potentially fatal blood clot on the lung.
Senior physician Dr Ananth Prasan said ''it would be essential'' the
patient be found so his condition could be monitored and the correct
drugs administered.
But senior surgical registrar at the hospital Andrew Northeast -- in
charge of the patient -- told the inquest he was happy that ''adequate
steps had been taken by the relevant authorities to find the missing
patient''.
The hearing continues.

A HIGH Court judge will decide today if a health authority's refusal
to fund life-saving treatment for a 10-year-old girl is in breach of her
''fundamental right to life''.
The father of B, who cannot be named for legal reasons and is
critically ill with leukemia, asked the judge to overturn Cambridge
Health Authority's ''unreasonable'' decision last week, not to pay the
estimated #75,000 it would cost for chemotherapy and a second bone
marrow transplant.
The authority said B was unlikely to survive the ''unpleasant'' and
distressing treatment and its ''limited resources'' could be spent more
effectively on other patients.
Mr Bruce McIntyre, appearing for the father, who gave up work to look
after his daughter at their home in the Cambridge area, told the court B
was bound to die without further treatment, and her fundamental right to
life was threatened.
''It (the authority) has, by refusing funding of this treatment,
effectively taken a step whereby life is denied to this child''.
Mr Nigel Pitt, for the authority, denied it was taking away B's
fundamental right to life.
He said: ''If health authorities spent their money on treatments which
doctors thought extremely unlikely to succeed and then had no money left
to treat hundreds of other patients who might have been effectively
treated, what would the public say about that?''
The court was told that at the age of five B developed Hodgkins
lymphoma and was sent to Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, where she
received chemotherapy and, by August 1992, appeared to have made a full
recovery.
However, 15 months later she was diagnosed as suffering from acute
myeloid leukaemia and was transferred to the Royal Marsden Hospital for
her first bone marrow transplant, the donor being her sister, now aged
nine.
She was released around May 1994, and returned to school. In January
this year she had a relapse and her father was told she had about six to
eight weeks to live and could not be treated further.
Mr McIntyre argued that doctors had agreed that B would have ''a
significant chance'' of her leukemia going into remission if she had
further chemotherapy.

A HEALTH Minister admitted last night that it was ''entirely
unsatisfactory'' that a patient had to be flown 200 miles for urgent
hospital treatment because he could not be offered a nearer bed. The
patient later died.
Mr Tom Sackville spoke as a row developed over the treatment of
Malcolm Murray, who was taken to Leeds General Infirmary by helicopter
after being hit by a van outside a bar in Orpington, Kent, on Monday
night.
Despite efforts by doctors to find a neurosurgical unit in the
South-east which could take him, the only available bed was in Leeds,
where he died on Wednesday night.
The Prime Minister appeared to seek to justify Mr Murray's treatment
during heated exchanges in the Commons.
He told MPs: ''I have to say, although the final facts are not yet in
front of me, I understand Mr Murray required a very specialised form of
treatment and Leeds was in a position to help.''
But Mr Sackville, in a letter to Mr Murray's MP, Citizen's Charter
Minister John Horam, seemed to suggest the flight could have made
matters worse for the patient.
''It is not clear to what extent Mr Murray's condition deteriorated as
a result of being transferred to Leeds,'' he said.
''It is, however, entirely unsatisfactory that he could not be
admitted to a closer hospital.''
In a letter to Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley, Labour's health
spokeswoman Margaret Beckett said Mr Horam had demanded: ''What on earth
happened here?''
She added: ''I understand he is not the first Minister to complain
about the effect of the reforms and the loss of important local NHS
hospitals and beds.''
She said that Mr John Taylor, a junior Minister in the Lord
Chancellor's department, had reportedly chaired a protest meeting in
support of his local hospital.
She urged Mrs Bottomley to make public the names of other Ministers
who had attacked the effects on their local hospital of NHS ''reforms''.
Mr Horam later accused Mrs Beckett of using his constituent's death
''as a pretext for party political mud-slinging''.
He wrote to her: ''I deeply regret that you should instantly seize
this case to make a cheap political attack, particularly one of such a
puerile and tenuous nature.''
He was satisfied that the investigation launched by the South Thames
Regional Health Authority was the correct response.
Mr Murray, 45, the victim of an alleged hit-and-run incident on
Monday, was initially taken to his local hospital, Queen Mary's at
Sidcup.
He had severe brain injuries which could not be treated there. It has
no neurosurgical unit.
Doctors tried to get him admitted to units in London but the nearest,
the Brook Hospital at Shooters Hill, was closed to new admissions
because of a flu outbreak and all the others refused to take the case.
The Liberal Democrat health spokesman, Mr Alex Carlile, said: ''This
is evidence that the Government has been listening to anyone but the
doctors who have to deal with trauma.
''Why was Mr Murray not airlifted straight to the helipad on top of
the Royal London Hospital where American boxer Gerard Maclellan is being
treated so skilfully by neurosurgeons?
''What would have happened if, yesterday in Orpington, there had been
a disaster involving a number of people with brain injury? Would there
have had to be a procession of helicopters to Leeds?''
The pressure group London Health Emergency said six intensive care
units -- including specialist neuro units at the Brook Hospital,
Atkinson Morley's in Wimbledon, and Oldchurch in Romford -- were under
threat of closure.
Its campaigns director, Mr Geoff Martin, said: ''The pressure on
intensive care beds, and particularly specialist neuro beds, is already
past breaking point as this latest tragedy highlights only too
clearly.''
A 33-year-old landscape gardener has been remanded in custody charged
with the attempted murder of Mr Murray.

<HEADLINE>Anger over legal aid for Adams</HEADLINE>

POLITICIANS reacted angrily last night to the news that Sinn Fein
president Gerry Adams has been granted more than #9000 in legal aid to
contest an exclusion order -- now lifted -- barring him from mainland
Britain.
A total of #9234 has been paid so far, but the final bill is expected
to be much higher.
Mr Adams has applied for a judicial review of Home Secretary Michael
Howard's decision to exclude him from entering the mainland under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act.
He claims the exclusion order breached European law by preventing free
movement of people within the EU.
The issue has been referred by the High Court to the European Court of
Justice for an interpretation of the relevant EU law.
The figure was disclosed by Lord Chancellor's Department Minister John
Taylor last night in a parliamentary written answer.
He said: ''In dealing with his application for legal aid, Mr Adams was
assessed on the same means and merits criteria as any other applicant
for legal aid, in accordance with the appropriate regulations.''
Earlier this week. Mr Howard promised: ''I shall never authorise any
payment of damages as a result of this case.''
He was speaking amid fears of similar claims by up to 500 other IRA
sympathisers who have also been banned from Britain at some time under
emergency laws.
Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland
committee, said the legal aid rules needed changing.
''I'm horrified. I do not believe a man who has been an apologist for
the murder of British citizens should receive a penny of British
taxpayers' money.
''I condemn this development. It's entirely unacceptable. I can think
of lots of people who have a far better case for legal aid than Mr
Adams,'' he said.
Legal aid is granted to people with limited means who cannot afford to
pay the fees.
Ulster Unionist David Trimble, MP for Upper Bann, asked: ''Has there
been a proper investigation of his means because we know that Mr Adams
is a leading figure in a multi-million- pound empire.
''Sinn Fein-IRA has an income of #6m per annum, and the answer is no
there hasn't been a proper investigation of his means because they are
too scared.''
Liberal Democrat Northern Ireland spokesman Lord Holme said: ''Gerry
Adams would be better advised to concentrate on de-commissioning his
armoury of terror than raking over the coals of his dubious past.
''British taxpayers' money should not be used to help him in his
appeal.''
Tory Peter Bottomley, MP for Eltham, said: ''There are far better
cases for the money to be spent on.
''This will come as a surprise to many people and will upset many
people. The best advice for Gerry Adams is to drop the case and get on
with creating a better future for Northern Ireland.''

A RESEARCH lodge in a Highland glen is to be torn down because of
flaws in the construction, 18 months after it was built at a cost of
#150,000.
Scottish Natural Heritage has decided to build another lodge on the
same site for a similar price.
Iolaire Lodge, in Glen Doll, Angus, was to be used as a research and
educational base for the nearby Caenlochan National Nature Reserve and
sites of scientific interest.
Mr Iain Rennick, SNH regional administrator, said: ''The contractors
made a number of flaws in the way the building was held together. The
flaws raised doubts about safety.
''Surveyors were concerned that part of the building may have been
able to blow in. There was a possible danger to anyone using the
building and we couldn't take any risks.''
Mr Rennick said that the Fife-based contractors involved had gone
bankrupt since the building was finished and the flaws were spotted.
He said: ''We would have asked them to make good the mistakes, and if
they had failed to do that we would have sued them.
''The organisation is very disappointed about this because of the cost
involved.
''It has not been a good experience.''
Work to demolish the lodge is expected to be finished by next month.
It is hoped that the new building will be completed in the autumn.

<TEXT>
COMPUTER games giants Sega and Nintendo ''operate against the public
interest'' in pricing their goods and controlling the market, an
official report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission disclosed
yesterday.
The report found that ''monopolistic practices'' existed in the
industry, which ''operate against the public interest and have adverse
effects on the prices and availability of video games''.
The two companies, which dominate high street sales of video consoles
and games, are criticised for practising ''discriminatory pricing''
which results in software prices which are ''excessive'' in comparison
with the cost of hardware.
The commission's findings were announced yesterday, 14 months after
the matter was referred to them by the Director General of Fair Trading.
Accepting the report, Corporate Affairs Minister Jonathan Evans
criticised Sega and Nintendo for the restrictive conditions applied to
independent publishers producing games on their consoles, thus
''enabling them to control the supply of video games''.
''The MMC has concluded that the appropriate remedy to open the games
market to more competition is to require certain restrictions in the
licence conditions to be removed,'' said Mr Evans.
He said there would be three months' consultation on the commission's
key recommendations, with a threat that price controls might be imposed
if suitable remedies cannot be agreed.
The commission found that a monopoly existed in favour of Sega Europe
for hardware and software for the year ending June 1994.
It also found that Sega and Nintendo exercised a complex monopoly by
supplying more than one quarter of video games sold in the UK.
The report also noted that the companies incorporated technical
features into their products which made it ''very difficult to produce
software that can be played on their machines''.
The companies also conducted their affairs ''so as to prevent,
restrict, or distort competition'', it said.
The key recommendations are that:
* Restrictions in licensing conditions limiting the number of games
published and requests for approval prior to publication should be
lifted;
* Controls on packaging and presentation should be removed, ''in
particular'' the requirement that Sega and Nintendo arrange or control
the manufacture of cartridges;
* If this does not prove possible, there should be an ''alternative
remedy'' of price controls.
* Restrictions on games rental should be removed, and software
supplied by Nintendo and Sega be ''freely available to rent''.
A statement from Sega Europe said the company's initial reaction to
the commission's findings was one of ''disappointment''.
However, it welcomed the Department of Trade and Industry's decision
to invite comment, and pledged ''full participation'' in the
consultation process.
A spokesman for retailer HMV said: ''We now await the commission's
final recommendations in the hope that we will be able to pass on any
resulting price reductions to our customers.''
Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, Mr Nigel Griffiths, said the
inquiry was ''overdue'' and demanded immediate action.
''I raised with Ministers two years ago the high prices and refusal to
permit rental of these games and nothing was done. Yet millions of kids
have now paid a packet for the games.
''This has been another missed opportunity by the MMC. Even now it's
letting these companies off for another three months. Immediate action
is required.''

THE future of two other members of a Scottish National Heritage
regional board has been questioned because of opposition to the proposed
superquarry at Lingerbay, south Harris.
Western Isles Islands Council vice-convener, Mr Angus Graham, was
removed from the north-west regional board of SNH this week for publicly
attacking the organisation's opposition to the quarry.
The two members, Mr Peter Peacock, vice-convener of Highland Regional
Council, and writer and historian Dr Jim Hunter, have never hidden their
deep concern over the SNH approach to the quarry. They are not great
supporters of the proposed operation but are troubled at how SNH arrived
at its stance of outright opposition.
Neither, however, would comment yesterday on speculation that their
continued membership of the regional board was in doubt.
Mr Peacock told The Herald: ''I was in Edinburgh at a meeting of the
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities when all this blew up over
Angus Graham so I really am just catching up with it all. I certainly
can't make any comment on the background to Mr Graham's departure,
neither can I say anything about my own future.''
Dr Hunter, who has been reported as already considering his future for
personal reasons, yesterday would say only: ''My views on Lingerbay have
been well publicised and I have nothing to add. I have no comment to
make on Mr Graham leaving the board or on its future composition.''
Meanwhile, more information has emerged concerning the project which
Mr Graham is convinced finally led to his removal from the regional
board.
He had opposed SNH giving #150,000 to one of the Countess of
Sutherland's family trusts in compensation for not clear-felling 100
hectares of Scots Pine on the shores of Loch Fleet where it was proposed
to establish a national nature reserve.
Lord Strathnaver, the Countess of Sutherland's heir, is also a member
of the SNH north-west regional board which had been asked to support
this project. The propriety of Lord Strathnaver's role in this, however,
is not in doubt.
Mr Graham said last night: ''I am not questioning Alistair
Strathnaver's integrity in any way. It wasn't the case of the trust
coming to SNH and looking for money but rather SNH rushing out and
trying to persuade them to take it.''
An SNH spokesman said: ''Negotiations have been under way for over two
years on the possibility of setting up an NNR on this internationally
important Site of Special Scientific Interest.
''But these have still to be concluded and, until that time, it would
be quite wrong and may prejudice the negotiations themselves to talk of
particular figures.''

VISCOUNT Whitelaw, the former deputy Prime Minister and one of the
Conservative Party's most respected figures, has expressed fears over
rail privatisation and warned Ministers it threatens the existence of
the west coast main line.
In an exclusive interview with The Herald, Lord Whitelaw cast doubts
on its chances of success, and said it was up to Transport Secretary
Brian Mawhinney to provide reassurances.
He has made his views known privately to Ministers, and pledged to
fight for the future of the west coast line, which passes near his home
in Penrith, Cumbria then on to Glasgow.
He said there was no sign that privatisation is working. ''I have
always had doubts, and remain with doubts, about the privatisation of
the railways, simply because there is no evidence yet that this is going
to succeed.''
Lord Whitelaw has joined the campaign to safeguard the west coast main
line organised by MPs and peers along the route.
''My suspicion is that in the end most of the traffic to Scotland will
go up the east coast line. So the future of the west coast line is of
course the great worry.''
Lord Whitelaw's comments coincided with stinging criticism from
out-going BR chairman Sir Bob Reid, who accused the Government of going
about privatisation the wrong way and insisted he would not put any of
his money into it. ''When the chairman of the railways says he thinks
the Government has gone about it the wrong way, there must be something
not quite right.''

THE woman alleged to have been Robert Hughes's mistress yesterday
surfaced for the first time since he resigned as Citizen's Charter
Minister.
Janet Oates, his Commons secretary, faced journalists gathered outside
her flat in his West Harrow constituency.
According to newspaper reports, she was the woman with whom he had the
affair which led 43-year-old Mr Hughes to announce his resignation on
Monday.
When she arrived at her home, Miss Oates, 36, avoided questions as to
whether she was his lover. In an angry and tearful confrontation, she
was reported as telling journalists: ''I am not saying I had an affair
with him.''
She added: ''I am not in hiding. I am just being hounded. All my
family are being hounded. Just leave us alone.''
When asked if Mr Hughes quit because he was being blackmailed, she
reportedly retorted: ''Don't be stupid. Who would want to blackmail
him?''
The MP's political future looked bleaker yesterday as local Tory
officials began to sound out activists over whether they wanted him to
stay on.
According to some reports, Mr Hughes started a relationship with Miss
Oates after she turned to him for help because she feared her former
boyfriend, who was jailed for nine years for assaulting her, would be
released early from prison.
His constituency chairwoman, Mrs Joyce Nickolay, said the latest
allegations left a question mark over the MP's judgment.
She would take soundings within the constituency over whether people
wanted him to continue as the MP.

Ottawa, Thursday,
THE European Union's executive Commission accused Canada of piracy
today, saying it had seized a Spanish vessel in a row over fishing
rights.
Emma Bonino, the EU commissioner in charge of fisheries, told a news
conference the seizure had taken place outside Canadian waters.
But in Ottawa, Canada denied a news agency report about a Spanish boat
being boarded.
Canada is trying to stop a surge in EU catches of Greenland halibut,
also known as turbot, which it says are threatening stocks of one of the
last commercial species in the region.
Canada later said it had arrested a Spanish fishing boat off its east
coast in the Atlantic Ocean.--Reuter.

VISCOUNT Whitelaw is worried about rail privatisation. He does not
rate its chances of success, and thinks it will mean the slow death of
the west coast main line.
His fears are not the sort of thing Mr Major would wish the public to
hear.
The Government cannot afford to have one of its elder statesmen
expressing concerns -- however politely -- about a policy that is
already in difficulty.
Lord Whitelaw has done it before. Little more than a year ago, he was
one of the Tory peers who gave Home Secretary Michael Howard a roasting
over the Criminal Justice Bill. ''When I find I am anxious and
concerned, surely it must be my duty to speak out firmly, and that is
what I am doing.''
This time it is the railways that are causing him anxiety. Yesterday
in his office in the Lords he spoke cautiously, but his message was
clear: he has always had doubts about this privatisation.
Lest Labour and privatisation's opponents get too excited, he
emphasises his support for the Government. His political longevity and
success are based on an old-school loyalty to the party and its
leadership.
Even on the railways he acknowledges a duty to give ''fair wind'' to a
policy that has been decided by Cabinet. But those closest to the throne
are often the most dangerous.
He is equally adamant about his commitment to the west coast line.
Despite repeated assurances from Ministers, he thinks it is in trouble.
He believes that what he considers the economic lifeline of the rural
area he served at Westminster for 28 years is being eroded, and that it
will eventually be supplanted by the modernised east coast line.
Yesterday's comments from outgoing British Rail chairman Sir Bob Reid
have not helped. Sir Bob said the Government is going about it the wrong
way, and admitted he would not put any of his money into a passenger
franchise.
The break up of BR into a myriad of companies is designed to bring
transparency into the railway's finances. Transparency, where each line,
service, and activity is expected to know its costs and income, will
open the way for private sector investment. Or so the argument goes.
Lord Whitelaw is happy for the Government to give it a try. But woven
through his conversation is an obvious lack of confidence. ''The course
it set to do it, and whether they have got their plans right I don't
know. One is bound to be anxious at whether it is going to work.''
William Whitelaw is not a natural rebel. He once admitted that he
would have been a ''fatal'' choice to lead the party, adding: ''I'm not
good at always being against things.''
His background -- both grandfathers were MPs -- is steeped in public
service. He was born in 1918 in Edinburgh, though the Whitelaws come
originally from Coatbridge.
After entering the Commons in 1955, his career took him to the highest
offices: Chief Whip, Leader of the House, Northern Ireland, Home Office,
Chairman of the Conservative party, and, ultimately, Margaret Thatcher's
deputy Prime Minister.
As the loyal lieutenant he was overshadowed by the Iron Lady --
''Everyone needs a Willie,'' she said.
0 His interest in the railways is a family affair. His grandfather was
chairman of the Highland railway, and when the railways were
amalgamated, he served as chairman of the LNER.
He has expressed his views in private to Ministers. And he has written
to the chairman of the Rail Users' Consultative Committee over the loss
of sleeper and motorail services.
Last month Transport Minister John Watts added to his worries by
failing to turn up for a meeting with MPs and peers fighting for the
west coast line.
The abrupt cancellation -- Mr Watts claimed he wasn't sufficiently
briefed -- still angers Lord Whitelaw. An uncertain Minister does not
reinforce confidence in an unpopular policy.
Lord Whitelaw is too loyal to lead privatisation's opponents from the
front. But by going public the Tories' senior peer has drawn attention
to the disquiet over privatisation that exists at the heart of the
party. And by pledging to continue his efforts to save the west coast
main line, he has effectively warned Mr Major, in the nicest way
possible, that all is not well with the railways.

IN WHAT is destined to become one of the great political
understatements of the year, Roseanna Cunningham looked back on the
SNP's now infamous preliminary selection meeting for the Perth and
Kinross contest and said: ''It is probably not the way I would have
chosen to start the campaign.''
Nor is there likely to be a more optimistic comment than: ''I suppose
that at least there can be few people left who don't know who I am.''
For the benefit of these remarkably few people, Ms Cunningham is the
advocate who contested the seat at the last General Election and came
within just over 2000 votes of taking it from the late Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn. She was then dropped from the provisional shortlist 12 days
ago after an astonishing onslaught concerning her private life during a
preliminary selection meeting.
It was soon clear when details of this secret meeting were leaked, it
concerned an accusation from party president Winnie Ewing that Ms
Cunningham had been responsible for the break-up of the first marriage
of her daughter-in-law, SNP parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing. Ms
Cunningham says she had a relationship with Mr Donald Bain in 1977 only
after the couple had publicly announced their separation.
''I had literally only minutes warning that this issue was coming
up,'' she said, ''and none whatever that it was going to be raised as
dramatically as it was. Had I known I could have taken steps to deal
with it, instead of it becoming the mess it did.
''There is a saying that there is no such thing as bad publicity.
Whether that's true is another matter. What there is, is publicity that
puts you under enormous physical and emotional stress. I was just the
unwitting person, hunkered down while the storm raged overhead.''
Her first reaction was that, although the episode, from 18 years ago,
was a supposed sex scandal that never was, the screaming tabloid
headlines would cause the SNP damage and so she withdrew her name from
the selection process.
However, after what she described as the fantastic support from both
the party leadership and from grass-roots supporters, she put her name
forward again at national conference in Stirling last weekend.
''I am tired but I am angry,'' she said. ''That will see me through. I
am absolutely determined not to be brought down by this and allow it to
affect me politically. It cannot be right that we let tabloid newspapers
dictate to us how our politics should be conducted, as if we have to be
submitted to them for approval.''
For Ms Cunningham, the headlines made strange reading: ''I saw myself
labelled in some pretty amazing ways, ways that meant I did not
recognise myself. I don't think any of my views are particularly
startling.'' One label which has often been applied has been that she is
some kind of republican socialist firebrand on the far left of the SNP
who would be entirely the wrong candidate to fight a rural, conservative
seat.
She claims that the labels are wrong both in terms of herself and the
constituency, pointing out that more than half the electorate of the
seat live in Perth itself, where people living in council houses are
unlikely to be ''more tweedy, or Conservative than anywhere else''.
She says: ''At the end of the day people struggling to pay their fuel
bills face the same problem, whether they live in a city in a council
house, or live in the country in a tied cottage . . . flooding is just
as devastating, whether you live in Perth or Paisley. People are so busy
looking for differences, they don't see the similarities.''
In any event, her own views put her very much in the Scottish
mainstream, she says, and while she is not in favour of the monarchy she
has always adhered to the party line on this. Part of the problem, she
believes, is that because she did not come to the SNP with a background
in Scottish left-wing politics, people don't know where to place her in
the spectrum.
Ms Cunningham was nine when her parents decided to emigrate to
Australia. That was in 1960. ''These were the days of 'you've never had
it so good.' They looked round and thought, if this is as good as it
gets, we're better off out of it, and they booked their #10 ticket to
Australia.''
She attended university in Perth -- Western Australia -- and in 1976
decided to return to Scotland.
''I joined the SNP because of my belief in independence, not because
of any of my other views, and certainly not because they took primacy. I
have been on different sides of debates and have won some and lost some.
That's the way political parties work.
''Once defeated, I always accepted the party line. The royalty issue
is not important enough to make a difference to my party politics.
''I suppose I am left wing, but I am never too sure what people have
in mind by that phrase. I believe in public ownership of some things,
for example, but not centralised state ownership. Housing associations
are a good argument for decentralised public control.''
After a spell of two years as a party researcher on her return from
Australia, she did a law degree and became a solicitor carrying out
court work for local authorities and building up a background in the
local government union Nalgo.
Just over four years ago she became an advocate. In that same year,
1990, Jim Fairlie, the SNP candidate for Perth and Kinross, quit the
party over its pro-European stance, and Ms Cunningham, who was already
on the shortlist for Paisley South, was adopted. Having come close to
capturing the seat in 1992, she was keen to finish the job, but how much
damage has been done to the SNP campaign by the public spat with the
party president?
''There is a danger that this personal issue could have stopped us
running a campaign on political issues. But once the by-election gets
under way I will be put under pressure for my politics and I can handle
that. I can't see where the press can take the personal stuff now,
without simply appearing vindictive, so once the campaign starts in
earnest the focus will shift back to politics.''
Was she sure of that? There was a long pause. ''Yes,'' she said. We
shall see.

Paris, Thursday.
FORMER rivals and show business personalities jumped on Paris mayor
Jacques Chirac's bandwagon today as his lead over fellow conservative
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur widened in France's presidential race.
In a tell-tale sign of shifting winds, Charles Millon, parliamentary
floor leader of the centre-right Union for French Democracy (UDF), came
out in support of Chirac and 22 UDF members of parliament followed suit.
Millon, who briefly toyed with standing himself and hopes to stand for
mayor of Lyon in June, said Chirac was not only a more energetic leader
and reformer than Balladur but also a more committed European.
Most of Millon's movement has backed Balladur and five of its six
component parties demanded his resignation as floor leader. But Millon
retorted that some of his critics were already making their own secret
approaches to Chirac.
Two new opinion polls showed Chirac was now seven points ahead of
Balladur on the April 23 first round and would easily beat either the
prime minister or Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin in the May 7
run-off.
A Louis Harris poll for the magazine Valeurs Actuelles, taken on
Monday, gave Chirac 26% of the vote, Jospin 22 and Balladur 19 on the
first round. It said Chirac would beat Jospin 56-44 in a run-off and
would crush Balladur 60-40.
An IPSOS survey for the weekly Le Point, taken on Tuesday and
yesterday, credited Chirac with 27% on the first ballot, with Jospin and
Balladur tied on 20. It too saw Chirac winning a run-off easily over
either opponent.
Jospin, a former education minister, sought to counter Chirac's surge
in popularity by saying the Paris mayor was too inconsistent and
indecisive to be president.
''If I have to fight Chirac in the run-off, I will recall how he
changed positions on crucial issues for the country and how he has
successively been influenced by totally contrasting ideologies,'' he
told Socialist parliamentarians.
Balladur, hit by new controversy over his share sales and consultancy
earnings from a computer firm he used to head, tried to revive his
campaign with a message of optimism about France's economic recovery.
During a tour of the western Sarthe region he said he expected growth
this year to exceed the government's three percent forecast.

THE parents of a seven-year-old boy who accidentally jabbed himself
with a discarded needle he found in a lavatory at a McDonald's
restaurant face an anxious wait to see if he is at risk from the HIV
virus.
Doctors have told Mr Andrew Chapman, 32, and his wife Josephine, from
Maryhill, that it will be three months before any sign of HIV infection
could become evident.
They fear the needle may have belonged to a drug user and could pose
the risk of the HIV virus or hepatitis.
Their son Scott was rushed to hospital after the incident on Tuesday.
Yesterday, the fast food chain said it had launched an investigation and
stepped up security after he found the syringe at the restaurant in
Maryhill, Glasgow.
The child has been placed on a six-month course of antibiotics and his
parents have been offered counselling on HIV.
Scott had been at the restaurant with his parents and sister Nicola,
10, as part of the children's weekly treat.
A spokeswoman for McDonald's said the matter was under investigation.
She said the safety of customers was a priority, and added: ''This
should not have happened. We are investigating how it could have
occurred and have been in touch with the parents.
''We are trying to take as many measures as we can to try to stop
drug-takers using our restaurants. We are as vigilant as we can be in
the dining rooms, and toilets are checked every 15 minutes,'' she said.

ALMOST 100 of the Army's most senior officers were told yesterday that
they are to be made redundant. In all, 17 major-generals, 32 brigadiers,
and 48 colonels learned that they were to be the latest casualties of
last year's Defence Costs Study, intended to save #750m a year.
The redundancies are compulsory and across the board. Pensioning off
the top brass will start next month and take until March 1997. The ages
of those affected range from the early 40s to early 50s.
The fact that there would be job losses at two-star level and below
had previously been made public. Yesterday's notices will leave the Army
with only 27 major-generals. Six full generals and nine
lieutenant-generals have survived.
They are part of a total Army manpower cut of 500 jobs under the
Defence Cost Study. The remaining 400, mainly in the medical service,
will be told of their fate in September. This latest reduction has to be
seen in the context of a cut of almost 17,000 over the past three years.
The Ministry of Defence insisted last night that the severance
payments to major-generals would be on the same scale as that for other
ranks -- adjusted for differences in pay. The salary of a major-general
currently stands at #63,500.
Under the redundancy terms, a two-star officer with 21 months to serve
will receive a lump sum of #116,741 made up of a terminal grant of
#85,964 and a capital payment -- a so-called golden farewell -- of
#30,777. Thereafter he will receive an index-linked retirement pension
of #28,655.

TORY MPs yesterday demanded that senior Labour backbencher Greville
Janner should resign from his post as head of the parliamentary probe
into ''fat cat'' salaries.
They accused Mr Janner, MP for Leicester West, of offering the
services of his private company to the very executives summoned to
appear before the Commons employment select committee.
The committee is involved in a lengthy inquiry into alleged excesses
in the pay and perks of boardroom executives of privatised companies.
But 16 Tories accused committee chairman Mr Janner -- a director of
training and publishing company JSB Group -- in an emergency Commons
motion of having a conflict of interests.
He was condemned for his role in the award of a massive salary and
share options scheme to the chairman and directors of betting and
leisure company Ladbrokes.
Mr Janner is a non-executive director and member of the Remuneration
Committee of Ladbroke plc, whose chairman earns #583,000 a year.
The MPs said five Ladbroke directors were also granted share options
worth #2.3m.
The Commons motion calling for Mr Janner's resignation noted that he
was ''interviewing leading industrialists and businessmen on their
remuneration packages, while at the same time offering these people his
services on how to improve their public speaking and presentational
skills''.
It claimed that Mr Janner also offered advice on redundancies and said
''these activities represent a conflict of interest with his current
position as chairman of the employment select committee''.
After tabling the motion, the MPs later demanded a Commons debate on
the question of referring their claims about Mr Janner to the Nolan
Committee examining standards in public life.
The motion was raised with Commons Leader Tony Newton during questions
on next week's business. He told them their remarks ''do indeed indicate
some concern about these matters''.
* Meanwhile, Britain's highest paid coal industry executive Richard
Budge may face industrial action by the National Union of Mineworkers in
protest at a three-year pay freeze. And he may be called before the
Commons employment committeee to explain how his salary has leapt by
45%.

BRITISH RAIL chairman Sir Bob Reid yesterday admitted that the
performance of train services has worsened in the run-up to
privatisation -- and said he would not put his own money into the new
rail companies.
His critical comments will further embarrass a Government striving to
win over a sceptical public about the merits of privatisation.
Sir Bob, standing down at the end of the month, said he backed
switching the rail network to the private sector, in principle. But he
stressed he would have done it differently, and it would have worked.
When it was put to him that the first consequence of the Government's
reorganisation of the network in the privatisation run-up was that
services have worsened, he replied: ''Performance has gone down . . .
and nobody can deny that, and figures show that.''
He also said he would not have introduced Railtrack as a separate
track authority, but stayed with an integrated operation. He would also
have kept a nucleus of very experienced executives and not needed a
franchise director.
Asked if he would personally put money into a passenger franchise, he
replied: ''At this stage, no, I wouldn't.''
His reactions are as damning as those of Mr Chris Green before his
resignation last month as director of ScotRail.
Mr Green, frustrated by running trains on track over which he had no
control, was ''gagged'' as a direct result of his bleak assessment and
critical comments in an article in The Herald about the network's fate
leading up to privatisation.
He was ordered by Mr John Welsby, chief executive of the British
Railways Board, to stick to the company line and not speak directly to
the press unless it benefited the company.
Mr Welsby is taking over as chairman from Sir Bob who, like Mr Green,
has refused to pay lip-service to the Government and has reinforced
public concerns about the quality and standard of services after
privatisation.
The white-collar rail union, TSSA, yesterday welcomed Sir Bob's
comments -- and said it believed Railtrack would soon announce a
reduction of its regions from 10 to seven.
''Railtrack is desperately trying to make an unworkable system work,''
said general secretary Richard Rosser. He added: ''Just as the
Government is setting up 25 passenger operating companies, Railtrack is
going in exactly the opposite direction and is about to reduce its
zones.''
Railtrack said the suggestion of a reduction in regions was ''complete
speculation''.
Liberal Democrat transport spokesman Paul Tyler urged the Government
to heed Sir Bob's advice. He said: ''With both opposition parties
opposed to the Railtrack sell-off and with no election mandate for its
privatisation, the Government would be prudent to postpone a decision.''
Sir Bob's predecessor at BR, Sir Robert Reid, also made a strong
attack on rail policy towards the end of his chairmanship. He was
critical of the level of Government investment.

EFFORTS to sell a Scottish aeroplane led to unfounded fears of a
''near miss'' fears over Strathclyde last night.
A number of people contacted Strathclyde police, Glasgow Airport, and
the Civil Aviation Authority after spotting a large, distinctively
coloured passenger plane bank away from a smaller twin-engined aircraft
before completing a 360-degree turn and appearing to pursue the smaller
plane.
Mr Andrew Walker, from Bellshill, said it looked as though the smaller
craft had cut the bigger, turbo-prop plane up and the ''big boy'' was
going after him to give him a ''right talking-to on the radio''.
However, the truth was less sensational. The low flyers were making a
promotional film for British Aerospace, which manufactures the Advanced
Turbo Prop aircraft at its Prestwick plant.
The small, twin-engined plane was filming the larger ATP and flew in
tandem for some time, scouting out the best backdrops.
A spokesman for Glasgow's Air Traffic Control said the operation had
been fully approved by the Scottish Air Traffic Control Centre.
The Glasgow office and Glasgow Airport received a number of calls.
Mr Walker said last night he had heard the distinctive engine noise of
a ''twin turbo-prop revving hard'' at about 4.30 yesterday, and looked
up to see the big plane banking away from the smaller craft: ''These two
looked far too close together for safety. I thought they must just have
missed each other.''

<RECORDNO>979468582</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SURGEON who left two patients in agony with swabs inside them after
birth operations, was found guilty of serious professional misconduct by
the General Medical Council yesterday.
The council's professional conduct committee heard that Dr Karen
Wilson, 32, endangered the life of a caesarian section patient by
leaving a swab inside her at the North Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton,
North London, on March 31 last year.
Dr Wilson refused to heed advice from nursing staff that there was a
''missing swab'' after the operation on Mrs Valerie Rolph, of Stoke
Newington, North London -- and failed to acknowledge her mistake when
she was shown an X-ray indicating the distinctive ''bird's-nest'' shape
of the swab two days later.
Dr Wilson, who admitted failing to act on information about the
missing swab, also pleaded guilty to ''forgetting'' that she had left a
roll of five (four by four inch) swabs inside patient Mrs Helene Brett,
of Sidcup, Kent, after a forceps delivery of her daughter, Charlotte,
while she was working as a locum at Queen Mary's Hospital in Sidcup in
August last year.
Council barrister Miss Rosalind Foster said both patients had suffered
''excruciating'' pain following the operations.
Glasgow-born Dr Wilson also admitted failing to check the blood
pressure of ''at risk'' patient Mrs Annabelle Easom, also of Sidcup, at
Queen Mary's and inserting sutures into the bladder of Mrs Yvonne Martin
while she was a locum registrar at Basildon General hospital.
Miss Foster told the committee the three offences at Queen Mary's and
Basildon were committed while Dr Wilson was on suspension from the North
Middlesex, following the incident involving Mrs Rolph.
Dr Wilson claimed she had been tired and under pressure because of
trivial accusations made against her by midwives and other non-medical
staff at the North Middlesex, when she performed the caesarian section
on Mrs Rolph -- although she was ''ashamed'' of what she had done.
The committee stopped short of ordering the erasure of Dr Wilson's
name from the register but imposed stringent conditions on her
registration for a period of two years.

ROSEANNA Cunningham last night had the SNP banner for the Perth and
Kinross parliamentary by-election thrust into her hands.
Despite the murky weeks along the road to the candidature, she won it
with 15 of the 20 votes cast at the constituency's selection committee
meeting in a Perth hotel.
Immediately after her victory was announced, Ms Cunningham, 42, an
advocate, declared: ''I am pleased that, despite what has happened in
the last two weeks, I have now been selected. I expect to have a hard
fight ahead of me and I fully expect to defeat the Tories in this
by-election.''
Ms Cunningham told media representatives: ''I will be speaking to you
in greater detail tomorrow.'' She is due to take part in a press
conference in Perth with party leader Alex Salmond today.
She did respond last night to one pointed question -- was her
selection a personal triumph? Her reply was: ''It is a triumph for the
SNP.'' Pressed further, she would only repeat that it was a triumph for
the party ''and for the democratic process within the party''.
Four of the five votes which she did not collect went to local
district councillor Mr Bruce Crawford. The single remaining vote was
cast for Alasdair Morgan, national secretary of the party.
Councillor Crawford pledged his support for Ms Cunningham. ''I am 110%
behind her,'' he said. He announced that he would be standing in the
shadow local government elections in Perth and Kinross next month.
A fourth contender, Mr Keith Brown, the SNP transport spokesman,
withdrew only hours before the selection meeting.
Party president Mrs Winnie Ewing put what the party will be hoping is
the final seal of approval for Ms Cunningham in a quickly produced
statement.
She said: ''I send my heartfelt congratulations to Roseanna. I am very
hopeful that we will have an SNP victory in the by-election and I firmly
believe that Roseanna will be the first by-election victor to hold the
seat at a General Election. I am greatly looking forward to campaigning
in Perth and Kinross.''
Last night, one branch member said as she left the hotel: ''I think
that all the publicity which seemed to be going against Roseanna, and
the way she handled it, helped her tonight.''

<HEADLINE>Companies win interdict against families in bitter Cormorant Alpha compensation battle. Judge bans US court moves in oil case</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>BRUCE MCKAIN, LAW CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>

THE bitter legal battle over compensation for the families of those
who died in the Cormorant Alpha helicopter tragedy was joined again
yesterday.
The families and survivors are attempting to sue oil giants Shell and
Esso in the US, but this is being resisted by the oil companies who
claim that the natural venue for the case is Scotland.
The families can expect to win up to 20 times as much compensation if
damages are awarded in the US.
In Brazoria County, Texas, Judge Neil Caldwell has already ruled that
an action in the name of 53 relatives and survivors should be allowed to
go ahead in the US.
Apart from deciding that the Texas courts had jurisdiction because of
the oil companies' business links in the state, the judge was highly
critical of the way the case had been conducted.
He alleged that the oil companies had undertaken a series of
deliberate, calculated manoeuvres to obstruct and impede the families.
Judge Caldwell also stated that there were reasonable grounds for
alleging that Shell and Esso had been responsible for the helicopter
crash because of their ''unrelenting push'' to reduce ''non-productive''
time by using the Super Puma helicopter to cut waiting time in storm
conditions.
These allegations are denied by the oil companies, who want to
challenge Judge Caldwell's finding on jurisdiction in the Supreme Court
in Texas.
Eleven men died when a Bristow-owned Super Puma crashed just after
taking off from Shell's Cormorant Alpha platform in atrocious weather
conditions on route to a nearby accommodation platform in March 1992.
Six men, including the pilot survived.
There have already been a number of lengthy hearings in the Court of
Session, and yesterday Mr Colin Moynihan, for the oil companies, asked
Lord Abernethy for an order banning the 53 plaintiffs from moving the US
proceedings from the District Court in Brazoria County to the probate
court.
Mr Moynihan said the application was being made to transfer the case
in Texas at 9pm British time last night.
He reminded Lord Abernethy that at a previous hearing the judge had
made it clear that no procedure should take place in the US apart from
the decision on jurisdiction.
In December last year, a guardian had been appointed to the ''minors''
involved in the case in the US. Some of these were, in fact, in their
mid-20s, and there was more than a suspicion that the guardian had been
appointed by Keaty and Keaty, the US lawyers who continued to act for
the families.
Then, on February 14 this year, the guardian had appointed an
administrator to look after the interests of the estates of those who
had died in the disaster. The administrator was someone in control of at
least part of the action beyond the reach of the Court of Session.
The next step was that on March 1, the administrator filed a motion to
transfer the whole US damages action involving the 53 plaintiffs from
the district court to the Probate Court in Brazoria.
That sequence of events aroused the suspicion that the whole exercise
was a device on the part of Keaty and Keaty.
The conduct of the litigation in America would be placed, at least in
part, beyond the control of the families and survivors, with the result
that an order from a Scottish court would be of no practical value.
The oil companies were apprehensive that the current transfer
application was no more than a preliminary step to dealing with the
merits of the case in the US. They were also concerned that it would put
a spanner in the works of their jurisdiction appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court.
Mr Colin Sutherland, QC, for the families, denied that they had filed
a motion in Texas to transfer the case. This had been done by the
administrator, who was an officer of the court in the US who had been
appointed by the guardian, also an officer of the court.
Both were outwith the jurisdiction of the Scottish court and Lord
Abernethy could take no action over it.
But the judge said he had to do all he could to preserve the position
previously reached by the Scottish courts -- that the oil companies had
made out an arguable case that Scotland was the proper venue for the
case.
He granted interdict against the 53 relatives to ban them from taking
any steps to move the US proceedings to the probate court.

THE owners of a Scottish nursing home yesterday failed to win a court
order banning a BBC Scotland television programme being broadcast last
night. Raymond and Margaret Baigent, of Orchard House Nursing Home,
Crossford, Lanarkshire, said their reputations would be damaged by the
Frontline Scotland documentary.
They have instructed their solicitors to raise court proceedings for
defamation. The programme alleged ''appalling'' standards of care.
At the Court of Session in Edinburgh yesterday, the Baigents' counsel,
Mr Neil Davidson, QC, claimed the accusations were ''unfounded, unjust,
and untrue''. The couple wanted the court to block the screening of the
programme but Lord Morton of Shuna refused their request.
Lord Morton said: ''There is a public interest at the moment in
Scotland about the running of nursing homes for the elderly.''
He refused the application on three grounds. He said: ''It is
impossible to grant an interdict in the terms sought. That is the first
ground.
''The second is that I consider even if the terms of the interdict
sought were varied, the balance of convenience in the light of the
publicity that appears to have happened makes it better that the thing
should be broadcast. Thirdly, there is a remedy of damages.''
During the hearing, Mr Davidson read out parts of a report in
Thursday's editions of The Herald about the BBC programme and the home.
He said The Herald article raised questions over the accuracy of the
Frontline Scotland programme.
Mr Davidson went on: ''I accept the topicality of this has increased
but material that has been discovered by The Herald as stated here
fortifies the strengths of the pursuers' case.''
He produced 93 letters from staff, residents, and former residents and
their families in support of the home.
Mr Davidson added: ''The Herald article appears to give greater
information about the notion that there was some conspiracy against the
Baigents and their home that comes from dissatisfied, sacked, resigned
former members of staff.
''The position now, I would submit, given the correspondence that is
produced, is that there is a very, very strong case that lies are being
told and will be broadcast by the BBC.''
Executive producer of Frontline Scotland Val Atkinson said: ''We are
delighted that viewers will be able to see the programme.''
In a statement issued through their solicitors last night, Mr and Mrs
Baigent said: ''Our nursing home has at various times, including very
recently, been checked by various independent medical authorities,
including Lanarkshire Health Board, a consultant surgeon, and the local
general practice. On no occasion have these authorities found any cause
for concern.''

WHEN Professor Peter Odell says the North Sea oil industry has at
least another 30 years to go and the gas industry will be of growing
importance people should sit up and take notice.
Scorn was poured on his predictions in 1973 that the North Sea would
be a much larger oil and gas province than the oil industry was prepared
to concede.
''Quite simply we say his estimates are rubbish,'' a BP spokesman said
at the time.
However, Professor Odell's predictions have proved to be largely
correct and, as well as at least one BP spokesman, he believes the
Labour Party must also rue the day it ignored him.
Professor Odell was in Aberdeen last night presenting a lecture: North
Sea Oil and Gas, 30 Years Gone -- 30 to Go? which was organised by
Aberdeen University and the Royal Scottish Geographical Society.
He outlined how the North Sea oil had proved extremely important to
the international oil industry in terms of the impact it had by bringing
oil down in price and also in the context of introducing the industry to
a new environment.
He emphasised its importance to the UK economy and said: ''I often
think that if it had not been for oil, Britain might have just
disappeared beneath the waves.''
Professor Odell said the discovery of oil and gas in the North Sea was
one of the most important post-war events for Britain and Europe.
He said there was enough oil already discovered to maintain three
million barrels a day UK North Sea production for well into the early
years of the 21st century but most importantly Britain was now moving
into a period when the importance of gas in the North Sea was being
recognised.
The professor added that since the early 70s gas had been dominated by
oil but early in the 21st century the output of gas would exceed the
energy output of oil and would nearly double its current levels by about
2020, setting up a flow of jobs and a flow of revenue.
Speaking of the criticism of his 1973 study he said: ''We were thought
to be way off beam and were defined as having made serious errors in our
calculations.''
He said that Tony Benn had appointed him as a special adviser in the
early 1970s but then failed to take his advice and it meant the Labour
Government had ''to go begging to the IMF'' to help it out instead of
securing what it needed from the North Sea, probably bringing a
premature end to the Callaghan Government.

AN appeal was launched yesterday to raise #4m to build a National
Opera School for Scotland in Glasgow.
The new building will be on the premises of the Royal Scottish Academy
of Music and Drama, and will be called the Alexander Gibson Opera
School, after the conductor who founded Scottish Opera and was president
of the RSAMD until his death in January.
The project is intended to enhance the professional training already
given at the RSAMD, and to expand it by attracting high quality students
of opera from throughout the UK and abroad.
It was launched yesterday with a feisty optimism and determination
reminiscent of the heady days of Glasgow's year as European City of
Culture.
Already #800,000 has been secured -- with the Queen Mother, patron of
the RSAMD, a primary benefactor. The building, which will include
teaching, rehearsal and performance facilities, should be completed by
August 1997.
Mr Morrison Dunbar, appeal chairman, and a former chairman of the
board of governors of the RSAMD, said there was a critical shortage of
space for opera coaching, despite the excellence of the facilities in
the Renfrew Street building, opened in 1988.
At present, coaching in the opera department takes place in rented
accommodation in Bath Street. ''These premises,'' said Mr Dunbar, ''are
not even available to us in the evenings or at weekends.''
The Alexander Gibson Opera School, he said, will be situated at the
rear of the Renfrew Street building, where there is at present a car
park. It will be linked to the main academy building, but with its own
entrance on Cowcaddens Road.
The organisers yesterday stated their intention of going for the big
money. Principal targets will be the Foundation for Sport and the Arts,
the Millennium Fund, and the National Lottery, whose money is available
for capital projects. Banks and the biggest businesses can also expect a
knock on the door.
The #800,000 already secured has come from, as well as the Queen
Mother, a range of trusts and individuals, including the RSAMD and
Broadwood Trusts, Lady Veronica Gibson, widow of Sir Alexander, and the
Dunard Fund.
The organisers intend, however, to cast the net as wide as possible,
seeking covenants, donations, in-kind sponsorship, specialist equipment,
and the sponsorship of individual rooms and seats.
Chartered architects Boswell Mitchell and Johnston have been appointed
the school's architects.

PLANS for Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg to go with the Prime
Minister this weekend to Israel apparently have been dropped in what is
seen by Middle East watchers as a move to avert a diplomatic row.
Mr Hogg had been widely expected to travel with Mr Major, although
this was never officially announced and the Foreign Office insisted
yesterday that no final plans were made.
His expected visit was reported to have prompted diplomatic
representations from Israel to try to stop Mr Hogg visiting Orient
House, the Palestine Liberation Organisation's headquarters in east
Jerusalem.
Israel says the Palestinians, who claim east Jerusalem as their
capital, can use Orient House as a cultural centre but not for political
meetings.
East Jerusalem is viewed by the Palestinians as the capital of their
future state.
The Foreign Office said last night that the decision that Mr Hogg
should remain in London was taken on Wednesday by the Prime Minister and
Foreign Secretary because somebody was needed to ''mind the
shop.''Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd will be in the Gulf over the
weekend while Mr Major is in Israel.

FREDDIE Starr's gay ex-gardener is facing a prison sentence for
stealing thousands of pounds worth of jewellery from the comedian and
his former wife Sandra.
Robin Coxhead, 44, was found guilty of two theft charges after a jury
at Reading Crown Court dismissed his claim that he had been given the
jewellery by Mr Starr in exchange for sexual favours.
Coxhead showed no emotion as Judge John Crocker said he would pass
sentence on April 7, after reading reports.
Coxhead denied stealing any of the gems, claiming the comedian asked
him to perform oral sex at his mansion in Maidenhead, Berkshire, and
afterwards gave him gifts, including a #12,000 diamond engagement ring
belonging to his then wife, plus bracelets and a pendant necklace.
The judge had already directed the jury to find Coxhead not guilty on
another charge of stealing a watch belonging to Mr Starr.
Coxhead, of Audley Street, Reading, was released on conditional bail.
Judge Crocker told him: ''I want you to be under no illusion
whatsoever that these offences are very serious. It involves a breach of
trust and a very large amount of money.''
During the four-day trial, the court heard allegations that Mr Starr
was addicted to valium and diazepam and would fly into uncontrollable
rages, during which he would abuse Coxhead both verbally and physically.
Coxhead told the court that Sandra Starr, now divorced from the
comedian, had told him she feared for her life on several occasions. Mrs
Starr denied the claim when she spoke from the witness box.
Mr Starr, a teetotaller, admitted to the court that he had had a drug
problem in the past, but said he had got help for it.
The couple's former housekeeper, Susan Englefield, said Coxhead told
her about his sex romps in the Berkshire mansion while the family were
on holiday in Florida.
The court heard that the loss of #41,000 worth of jewellery belonging
to Mr and Mrs Starr was discovered on their return from holiday in
February 1994.
Later Coxhead told police he had #38,000 debts.
When Coxhead was arrested in March last year, he denied stealing the
jewellery.
Arrested for a second time in April, he admitted he had the jewellery,
but had thrown it in the Thames when he realised Mr Starr had ''set him
up''.
When he finally admitted to police he had the jewellery, including a
Cartier watch valued at #10,000, Coxhead said: ''I did not want this to
come out about me and Freddie.''
But Mr Starr strongly denied the sex favours claim, telling the court:
''I am 100% heterosexual -- the allegations are totally despicable.''

<HEADLINE>Fury over Sinn Fein funds Fury over Clinton's move on Sinn Fein</HEADLINE>

PRESIDENT Clinton's signal that he will permit Sinn Fein leader Mr
Gerry Adams to resume fundraising in the United States was met with cold
fury by the British Government last night.
It is seen as an acknowledgment that Mr Adams is now entitled to join
political talks before the IRA has handed over a single weapon.
The President is inviting seven party political leaders in Northern
Ireland to a St Patrick's Day reception in the White House. Dr Ian
Paisley rejected the invitation immediately and Mr Jim Molyneaux, the
Ulster Unionist leader, was expected to do the same.
Mr David Irvine and Mr Gary McMichael, recognised spokesmen for the
loyalist paramilitaries, are consulting their party executives about the
invitation, but it is likely that President Clinton will be left with Mr
Adams and Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr John Alderdyce of the
Alliance Party, as his guests.
The St Patrick's Day reception will be toasting the Irish Prime
Minister, Mr John Bruton. Whitehall regards this as a politcal stunt by
President Clinton pressed on him by his National Security Adviser in the
White House, Mr Tony Lake, and the Kennedy Democrats in Congress.
Mr Major, who is to visit Washington in the first week of April, now
finds himself in a situation that might affect his control of the
ongoing delicate negotiations to force the IRA to give up their
offensive weapons before Mr Adams is allowed to meet British Ministers
as an accredited political negotiator.
The American decision to allow Sinn Fein to restart fundraising in the
United States is a desperate blow to Mr Major and his Northern Ireland
Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, who only last week believed that he had
persuaded the United States Government to continue the ban on Sinn
Fein's fundraising there.
Last night Mr Major was contemplating whether to contact President
Clinton personally to try to persuade him not to take two steps forward
before Mr Adams and the IRA have taken the essential one step forward --
to begin delivering up their stores in the Republic and elsewhere of
Semtex explosives, ground-to-air missiles and heavy machine-guns.
What has infuriated British Ministers is what they regard as a
specious argument advanced by the White House that there is no ban on
Sinn Fein fund-raising in the UK. This is not technically correct.
Furthermore, it has been pointed out to Washington that the IRA robs
banks and murders people on this side of the Atlantic in order to raise
serious funds.
This new crisis for No 10 and the White House has deeply irritated not
only Downing Street but also the US Secretary of State, Mr Warren
Christopher, who once again has been overruled by Mr Lake.
The President and Mr Lake are judged here to have taken too literally
a statement from Mr Adams yesterday, indicating that he is now prepared
to start serious talks about ''decommissioning'' of weapons. But he
links this with what he calls ''movement on a range of issues, including
repressive legislation, prisoners and the decommissioning of weapons''.
Mr Adams insisted: ''Everyone must be at the table and every issued
must be on the table. It is in this context that progress can be made on
the whole range of relative issues -- justice, discrimination in
employment, prisoners, political and constitutional matters and
demilitarisation.''
Without President Clinton's stunning intervention the British
Government would have taken the Adams statement as an encouraging step
forward in the peace process. Last night there was profound gloom in
Whitehall, particularly as Mr Dick Spring, the Irish Foregin Minister,
expressed gratitude to President Clinton for his keen interest and that
of Congress.
Mr Spring also welcomed Mr Adams's acknowledgment yesterday ''that the
decommissioning of weapons is among the important issues which must be
addressed, and confirming that his party is now ready to include this
issue among the matters they look forward to discussing in dialogue with
British Ministers''.
The British view is that this sentiment also races ahead of what has
actually happened. Sir Patrick has indicated to Mr Adams that, if he
begins to arrange the hand-over of IRA heavy weapons, he could be
allowed to meet Mr Michael Ancram, the British Minister in charge of
developing political negotiations.
In particular Downing Street did not wish the American Government to
sanction a resumation of Sinn Fein fundraising in the United States
until the IRA had taken this essential first step towards
decommissioning their arsenal -- almost 90% of which is believed to be
lodged in the Republic.
Sir Patrick last week in Washington emphasised this and thought that
he had won agreement.
He pointed out to Mr Christopher that the IRA is still recruiting,
still intimidating and still using violence such as knee-capping and
other tortures.

PENSIONERS were last night warned to be on their guard against a
hoaxer sending letters out on Lothian and Borders police headed
notepaper.
Two pensioners have already notified police about the bogus
correspondence sent out within the last fortnight.
One was sent to an 84-year-old Edinburgh man telling him he was a
witness in a rape case, and that he should report to a city court on a
certain date. Failure to do so would result in a #150 fine.
In the other case, a 74-year-old man from Bathgate in West Lothian
received a hoax letter claiming he owed several hundreds of pounds to
cover the costs of the services of police officers and RSPCA officials
in the hunt for his stolen car containing his dog.
The Edinburgh pensioner, Mr Alex Hope, yesterday warned other elderly
people who may have received suspicious letters to take them to the
police.
Mr Hope said: ''I have no idea where they got my name or why they
picked me out.
''The letter looked official and did cause me great concern and
worried both me and my wife. I had no knowledge of any court case or
anything like that.
''What raised my suspicions was that the envelope wasn't properly
sealed and there were some spelling errors in the letter.
''I took it to the police straight away and would advise any other
pensioners who may have had the same sort of letter not to worry and to
do the same thing.''
A Lothian and Borders police spokesman said both cases had caused the
people involved great concern.
The spokesman said: ''In both these cases elderly people have been
picked out to be sent the hoax letters. These sort of letters do cause
alarm to people.
''Our inquiries are continuing into the sending of the letters and we
would ask any other pensioners who have received similar ones to contact
us immediately at police HQ at Fettes in Edinburgh.''
Last month a hoaxer sent a letter to residents in a narrow Edinburgh
street telling them a ''fast lane'' for drivers was to be created
outside their homes.
The correspondence, purporting to come from Lothian Regional Council,
claimed the move would not pose any danger to householders.
A number of residents who received the communication initially
believed it to be genuine.

THE world's three great trading blocks -- Europe, North America, and
the Asia-Pacific region -- should band together in a tri-lateral
initiative to boost economic regeneration in South Africa and, through
that, save the rest of the sub-Saharan Africa from oblivion.
That was the impassioned plea to a Glasgow audience last night from Mr
Pik Botha, former South African Foreign Minister, and now Minister of
Mineral and Energy Affairs in the Mandela government.
Mr Botha told the annual Petroleum Dinner at the Hospitality Inn:
''Without a successful South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa will slide
further into anarchy and misery.''
He said companies coming to do business in his country, instead of
paying taxes, should contribute to the building of new schools and
hospitals.
Acknowledging the nature of the audience, he pointed to South Africa's
300 years of coal reserves and its offshore oil and gas prospects as
clear commercial opportunities.
Again and again, he returned to the theme of hunger and disease on the
continent, and the need for action. The greatest challenge facing the
world, he added, was global economic inequality.

AT LEAST one in three families living in council houses in Glasgow are
waiting for repairs to be carried out on their homes, it was claimed
yesterday.
The figure emerged after Scottish Militant Labour councillors accused
the city's Labour administration of a cover-up over the true level of
the repairs backlog in the city.
Councillor Tommy Sheridan alleged: ''There is a massive repairs
scandal in Glasgow. Many repairs are simply not being carried out while
the waiting time for others is several months.
''I have been given figures for Pollok, my ward, which show there are
7000 outstanding repairs. There are only 9200 houses in the ward. It is
obvious people in the schemes, where problems are concentrated, are
bearing the brunt of this crisis.''
Councillor Sheridan also claimed that the council's repairs budget had
been cut by #2.5m in the last two years and said #3m should be taken out
of the city council's #6m reserves immediately to redress the situation.
Since 1989 ''non-essential repairs'' have been suspended by the
council, but Councillor Sheridan said tenants were waiting for repairs
that were not on the suspended list.
Mr Ronnie MacDonald, depute director of City Housing, admitted that
there were 57,000 repair lines outstanding for council houses last
month. The council has a housing stock of 120,000.
However, Mr MacDonald said: ''It's wrong to say that 50% of tenants
are waiting for work to be done. Some of these repair lines will be
duplicates and some houses need several repairs. There's also the effect
of the floods in Pollok a couple of months ago.''
The Herald visited a number of tenants in Pollok yesterday who said
they had been waiting months for work to be done.
The front door of Miss Margaret Cryans's flat on Linthaugh Road was
kicked in by burglars in November. ''There is a huge hole in the
panelling of the door, the mortice has gone, and the Yale lock is only
held on by one nail,'' she said.
''When I go out the house I am scared to come back in case somebody is
in. And when I am in bed at night I am terrified someone will break
in.''
At nearby Dormanside Road neighbours Miss Kath Lynch, 27, and Miss
Margaret Doherty, 44, said the security door at the entrance to their
close had been destroyed three years ago and never repaired. The close
is invaded nightly by up to 30 youngsters.
The housing convener, Councillor Madge O'Neill, said that tenants were
not waiting longer for repairs than in the past. In fact, she added, the
repairs backlog had been reduced.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair received a boost for his drive to reform
Clause 4 when he won the backing of the party's Scottish executive.
It voted 18-12 in support of a reforming motion to be voted on at
today's conference in Inverness. This would water down the commitment to
nationalisation.
By a similar margin, the executive also voted to oppose a hard line
motion urging no change to Clause 4.
It is now expected that the reformers will win the day, although
opponents were still saying last night that the vote would be too close
to count.
Mr Jack McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish party, said the
executive's vote mirrored a substantial change of mood in the party over
the past three months. ''People's opinions have been changed as they
have listened to the debate.'' Last month, the executive tied 17-17 when
it voted on the principle of reform.
However there is still uncertainty about how the GMB union will vote.
Delegates were in a caucus meeting last night trying to reach a
decision. If they swing behind Mr Blair, he could have a more decisive
victory.
Mr McConnell said Mr Blair regarded it as most important that a
majority of constituency parties should support his plans. He said Mr
Blair had made clear throughout the campaign to replace the 77-year-old
Clause 4 of the party's constitution that he wanted to win the vote by
convincing individual party members he was right.
On Grampian TV's Crossfire last night, Mr Blair said he had no
intention of pursuing the policies set out in Clause 4 when in
government.
He said he did not regret starting the debate on the Clause and denied
it was a distraction.
''To win we need to be trusted and to be trusted we need to be
clear,'' he said.
There were industries which should be in the public sector, like the
railways, but he also wanted Britain to have a strong competitive
private sector.
On the same programme Mr Dennis Canavan, Labour MP for Falkirk West,
said: ''It would be contrary to the principles of democratic socialism
to say that just because the man at the top says something we should all
bow down and agree with him'.''
Mr McConnell said: ''The Scottish party now faces a very stark choice.
It can go for the status quo or it can vote to spell out party policy in
words that people can understand and endorse in the 1990s and beyond.''
Opponents will line up behind a motion to be moved by Glasgow Maryhill
party, which provided, in Mr Jim Mearns, a speaker who galvanised last
year's national conference. The key part of the motion says that Clause
4 and the principles it contains ''represent the ultimate object of
Labour's democratic socialism and should therefore remain unaltered in
any redrafted constitution''.
Meanwhile, Mr Blair moved swiftly last night to deny a report saying a
new 50% top rate of income tax would be introduced by an incoming Labour
Government.
A spokesman for the Labour leader said: ''No such decision has been
taken. The discussions that would be necessary for such a decision to be
taken have not been held.
''The Labour Party will not decide its tax rates until much nearer the
General Election.''
According to an ''exclusive'' report in yesterday's Daily Telegraph,
Mr Blair has decided to go into the next election promising that there
will be no return to the penal 83% top rate on earned income when the
party was last in power, but a new 50% top rate of income tax will be
introduced, it says.
The newspaper says no decision has been reached on the level at which
the rate will come into effect.
The newspaper says Mr Blair is understood to favour levying the new
top rate on earnings of at least #80,000 to #100,000 a year, to prevent
a backlash from the middle-income professionals Labour is trying to woo.
But Labour left-wingers -- says the newspaper -- want the higher
levels of tax to bite much lower down the scale, probably at around
#40,000 a year, to raise money to improve health, education, and other
services.

<HEADLINE>Celtic to sue ex-manager Lou Macari for #727,000 Celtic in claim for damages</HEADLINE>

CELTIC Football Club yesterday launched a #727,000 damages claim
against Lou Macari, listing a catalogue of alleged incompetence on the
part of the club's former manager.
As part of the action, Celtic allege that the team's failure to
qualify for Europe under his ill-fated stewardship cost the club more
than #380,000.
The action by Celtic in the Court of Session is a counter-claim to the
former manager's action in the same court for #431,000. Mr Macari is
claiming breach of contract over his dismissal in June last year.
In its counter-claim, which Lord Prosser allowed to be lodged
yesterday, Celtic alleges that the #250,000 paid to Stoke City to
recruit Mr Macari was a waste of money. Mr Macari is now back with the
Potteries club.
Celtic says the former manager spent most if not all of his working
week elsewhere than at Parkhead.
''He perceived his role as in large measure that of a sort of
super-scout scouring the country for new players,'' the club maintain.
''He infrequently attended coaching sessions with the players. He failed
to monitor injuries.''
His alleged lack of leadership is also criticised. ''He avoided even
discussing team formation. On occasion, the team were told immediately
before the game or not at all the formation in which they should play,''
say Celtic.
The Parkhead club allege that the players had little confidence in the
manager and made their views known within the club.
In their claim, Celtic say: ''Exceptionally, for only about the second
time in 20 years, they (the team) failed to attain a final position in
the league sufficient to earn them a place in a European cup
competition.''
The club allege that the poor performance of the team reflected the
low morale, the lack of discipline and organisation, and a lack of
leadership and add that but for Mr Macari's ''breach of contract'' the
team would have qualified for Europe.
Detailed losses alleged by Celtic are:
* #380,851 for failing to get into Europe.
* #250,000 ''wasted'' in payment to Stoke City.
* #23,777 in ''wasted'' management time.
* #67,794 in recruitment costs to find a relacement manager.
Mr Macari's ''excessive'' travel to and from Stoke is also said to
have cost #4928.
In his action against Celtic, Mr Macari claims that, under the terms
of his contract, the club were required to give him two years' notice of
termination of employment, but failed to do so.
He explains that he rented a house in Glasgow but that his wife and
children continued to stay in Stoke-on-Trent because of the children's
schooling.
He says he came to Glasgow from Monday to Saturday during the playing
season and worked every day of the week on Celtic's behalf.
Although he attended matches looking for new players, senior staff
were always present at Parkhead, delegated to carry out duties in his
absence.
Mr Macari alleges that the club's chief executive, Mr Fergus McCann
''appeared to be keen to and did generate paper complaints based on
misinformation or a misapprehension on his part of what the working of a
football manager required''.
Mr Siggi Bennett, counsel for Celtic, told the judge Celtic were
disputing Mr Macari's action on the basis that his sacking was fully
justified.
A further hearing in the case is expected.
Mr Macari was successful as a manager at Swindon Town, West Ham
United, and Stoke City before Celtic asked him to return to the club
where he had been popular as a player.
