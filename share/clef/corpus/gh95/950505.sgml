DAMON Hill escaped unhurt when he lost control of his Williams and
crashed heavily into a trackside wall during testing at Imola yesterday.
Hill, who won last Sunday's San Marino Grand Prix on the same track to
take the lead in the world drivers' championship for the first time, had
spun off the circuit when he collided backwards with the wall. A team
spokesman said the car was badly damaged, but confirmed Hill had not
been injured.
There was also trouble for Hill's team-mate David Coulthard, whose
car's engine burst into flames while he was out on the circuit. The fire
was controlled quickly and there was no serious damage to the car.
Coulthardt was also unhurt.

NEWS of great sociological changes in the infrastructure of Clootie
City. Well, Mennie's bar, one of the most kenspeckle howffs in Dundee,
is about to be sold with the concomitant departure of Connie the
barmaid.
Connie is of German origin and is known in the bar for being strict in
a Prussian sort of way. Her no-nonsense regime led to her being
nick-named The Hun at the Till. Connie's fame has spread even as far as
the Campbeltown Bar, the pub along the road, where the following piece
of graffiti can be found: ''Far from the madding kraut.''
* Talking about huns and krauts, we have news of how the Scottish TUC
is approaching the coming VE Day bank holiday. The comrades are of
course upset that May Day, the workers' celebration, has been sidelined
by the Tory Government in favour of us all marking the events which led
to Winston Churchill, MP, winning #12.5m in the National Lottery.
The STUC workers, however, were quite keen to have the VE Day holiday
as well. The STUC high heid yin have bitten the bullet and agreed. In a
message to the troops, deputy general secretary Bill Speirs says: ''I
have given consideration to the request that the office be closed on
Monday May 8, for the special holiday to mark the 50th anniversary of VE
Day. I have reluctantly concluded that I suppose the holiday will have
to be granted.''
No street party for Oor Bill on Monday and no wearing of decorations,
we suppose.
Today's letters
WE have reached the letters E and F in our A-Z of Scots Words for
Young Readers (Scottish Children's Press, #4.95) and today's Doric
sentences are:
I was ettlin to head eist tae Embro but indulged too much in raising
the elbuck and ended up inebriated as an esk. I had planned to head east
to Edinburgh but entered licensed premises where I raised the elbow so
much my condition could be compared to that of newt.
Fit a fankle I wis in when yon foggie bummer flew up my fillebeg. I
was fair fleggit and forfochen forbye. What a tangle I was in when that
wild bee flew up my kilt. I was truly frightened and exhausted as well.
It was gey gallus, glaikit, and gypit tae ask the Glesca wifie to have
a glisk at her girdle. It was extremely cheeky, stupid, and foolish to
inquire of the lady from Glasgow if we could have a peep or glance at
her flatiron for baking.
Haud yer wheesht! Enow o' this haverin, ye hillock. Be quiet! Enough
of this nonsense, you fat or sluggish person.
Up in the air
OUR dear colleague Lord Meek was complaining in his column yesterday
about service these days on his many circumnavigations of the globe. He
suggested that the Belgian airline Sabena stood for Such A Bad
Experience Never Again.
This is a rich source for acrimonious examination of acronyms.
Alitalia is, of course, Aircraft Lands In Tokyo All Luggage In Athens.
R D Don of Dailly, Ayrshire, was quick on the fax with PIA, Pray It

Singing not typing
THE Diary's opinion that Opera on a Shoestring's production of La
Traviata would be the highlight of Mayfest has been vindicated by a
right good opening night at the Cottier Theatre in the West End of
Glasgow.
Head diva Christina Dunwoodie and the rest of the wee aria people done
brilliant as you may have seen from the reviews. But enough of this
praise. Let's talk about the spelling and the bad language in the
programme.
Director Terry Gilbert appears as Terry Silbert and among his credits
for ''choreagraphy'' is listed a film called Four F****** Weddings and a
B****** Funeral. Ever on the lookout for some financial support, the wee
arians say they are able to provide ''interesting opportunities for
sponsors and doners''. What have kebabs got to do with it, we ask?
A clue to the variable quality of the typing can be found in the
Shoestring appeal for help in kind including ''typing -- we sing we
don't type''. They are forgiven especially since it was the head diva
herself who did the typing in between rehearsing the lead role and
making the tea.
* An addendum to colleague Tumelty's review. The show is even more
worth seeing if your seat gives a view of director Gilbert standing by
the touchlines of the intimate performance area. To extend the
footballing metaphor, Terry kicks every ball during the show.
Drowning sorrows
WINNER today in our quest for definitive examples of when you can tell
people have supped too well but not wisely is Lawrence Keith of
Stranraer. He cites the time Dumfries and Galloway fire brigade were
called to a blaze at the home of a chap renowned for his tippling. They
travelled at high speed through the country roads to reach the scene but
found the house well alight.
They were met in the driveway by the aforementioned man of the house
clutching a bottle of whisky and several glasses. He thanked the firemen
for coming and invited them to have a small refreshment before they got
down to work.
The offer was declined by the firefighters who proceeded, with
difficulty, to rescue the man's aged and infirm mother who was trapped
in the upper storey of the house.

THOSE of us charged with selecting the player of the year did not need
a great deal of heart searching and justification for our choice this
season. Rangers' star turn, Brian Laudrup, was so far ahead by halfway
that he would perhaps need to have scored six own goals, assaulted eight
goalkeepers, and robbed a bank to have caused any pangs of conscience.
The next task facing many of the Fourth Estate is not so simple.
Bell's, the Scottish League sponsors, wish us to select managers of the
year, from the overall winner through each of the four divisions, an
exericse which, I hope they appreciate, necessitates a bit of
cogitation. At this time of the season we are not into cogitation.
At first thought, naming the managers of the year seems
straightforward. The men whose teams won the divisions would seem the
natural recipients of such a prize, and yet it would be unfair to
exclude altogether the tools and resources with which the various bosses
are asked to perform their miracles. It is also difficult to compare
like with unlike.
If, for instance, Allan McGraw wins the second division with Morton,
who might just be able to afford a debenture at Ibrox, is his
achievement less worthy than that of Walter Smith leading his side to
the premier title? Of course, the fact that Smith has done it for the
seventh time in a row does merit special consideration, however wealthy
his club is.
John Lambie has spent much of his managerial life spending his money
in Shoprite, while others do their business in Harrods and, therefore,
evaluating his achievement, if he keeps Partick Thistle in the premier
division, must be different.
His Firhill side were bottom of the table from early October, yet
almost by dint of his own willpower, the players have responded so well
to the crisis that they are now fourth from bottom.
Jim Jefferies, who has maybe been able to visit Asda more often than
Lambie, still has had to prove himself year after year with limited
resources. His team, Falkirk, looked to be heading for the big slide
only a couple of months ago, but that was when his courage in changing
the personnel was shown.
In signing Maurice Johnston, Steve Kirk, and Paul McGrillen, Jefferies
took an enormous gamble at a stage of the season when there would be no
way back if he had got it wrong.
He got it right. Falkirk not only manoeuvred their way out of the
relegation zone but are still in with a chance of taking second spot in
the league and a place in Europe. If that does not represent good
management, nothing much will.
They are not the only contenders for the premier award, either. How
about Alex McLeish? The former Aberdeen defender took over a team that
had finished third in the table last season, a side that had been
fashioned over a decade by Tommy McLean to the point where they were
already cup winners and championship contenders.
There might be a limit to what more could be achieved at Fir Park.
McLeish, who might have been tempted to make sweeping changes to
establish his own personality on the side, showed great maturity in
leaving it relatively untouched for a while (if it ain't broke don't fix
it) and then, after having taken a chance by selling his most prized
player, Phil O'Donnell, to Celtic, gradually imposed his own self
confidence on the team.
The result is that he is very much on course to improve on last year
by taking the side to second place, not bad in his first year of
management.
And then there is Alex Totten. Who would have envied him in taking
over from the man who had become a huge favourite at Rugby Park, Tommy
Burns (how things have changed)? In the midst of an undignified and
messy row about compensation for his predecessor, many a man would have
wondered if he had made a sizeable error in tackling the job.
Totten, however, is his own man and he, too, made some judicious
entries into the transfer market, with the consequence that his side
have achieved a decent place in the league to save Kilmarnock the
embarrassment of relegation in the year their splendid rebuilt stadium
was completed.
Who should the premier man be, then . . . Smith, Totten, Jefferies,
Lambie, McLeish? It is not all pie and bovril, this business.
* THE great debate surrounding the unfortunate John Davies, who is
almost certainly out of the Tennents Scottish Cup final as a result of
suspension, seems to be missing a couple of salient points.
In the first place, take the argument that says there is a case for a
reprieve as the TV evidence indicates that Davies' ''victim,'' Jackie
McNamara of Dunfermline, went down without any contact being made by
Davies' elbow. Even if that is true, the fact that Davies attempted to
use an elbow is unquestionably violent conduct, and would have warranted
a sending off, anyway. All that the TV pictures could prove would be
that McNamara also should have been punished for feigning injury.
Secondly, if the feeling is strong in the country that players
punished in league matches should not be forced to miss the cup final as
a result, then why have Airdrie, who have suffered from this rule in the
recent past, or some other club not raised it at the annual meeting? The
rules can't be changed on the hoof.
It is a great pity that Davies, like Celtic's Tony Mowbray, is out of
the final but rules is rules, unless you change them. My hope is that
Airdrie reach a play-off place (and that will make me popular in
Dunfermline and Dundee) which would let Davies use up his suspension.
No-one enjoys seeing a player miss out on the big day.

THE senior Finance Ministry official I met in Tokyo was non-commital.
''We can't say we will or won't do this or that at this stage,'' he
equivocated. Then came the killer punch. ''It seems that in the UK your
Government raises liquor taxes every year,'' he beamed.
I had asked, at one of a series of briefings, about the vexed question
of tax discrimination against imported spirits like Scotch whisky in
Japan. Days before, the European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon
Brittan had decided to consult member states ''with a view to seeking a
WTO ruling on Japanese liquor taxes''.
The WTO, the World Trade Organisation, is the successor body to the
GATT Council which, in 1987, ruled against Japan on the issue and called
for all outstanding discrimination to be removed. Despite tax reforms in
1989 and again last year, Japan stands accused of continuing tax
discrimination in favour of the local spirit shochu, which continues to
be taxed at between a sixth and a quarter of the rates imposed on whisky
and brandy.
The EU, backed by bodies like the Scotch Whisky Association, wants the
WTO to wield the big stick. According to the SWA, sales of shochu have
increased by 11% since 1989 and the local vodka-like drink now accounts
for more than 70% of the total Japanese spirits market, while sales of
imported spirits have fallen.
''Will a WTO referral embarrass your Government?'' I asked my smiling
bureaucrat. ''We are not discriminating between imported and domestic
whisky,'' he replied serenely. ''So it shouldn't embarrass us. If the
issue is referred again, we would like to explain our case to the WTO.
''In total, imports of whisky are increasing. But unfortunately
imports of Scotch seem to be decreasing. It is sales of bourbon which
are going up. Yet the tax rates on bourbon and Scotch are the same.''
He went on to argue that the tax rate on Scotch is now less than half
what it was before the reforms, while the tax on shochu had doubled.
''And on top of that we again raised the tax on shochu last May by
between 30% and 44%. It would be very difficult to raise taxes on shochu
again in the tax reforms to be implemented in 1995.''
You get the point? The Japanese government is digging its heels in on
the issue. There will be no rush to please Sir Leon or the SWA. Tokyo is
playing the long game. But, before the issue escalates further in a
fresh skirmish in the ongoing global trade wars, let's just consider
whether we are being told the whole story.
Is Scotch whisky's relative underperformance in one of its most
important export markets an everyday story of protectionist
discrimination in favour of local producers? Or is the issue rather more
complex than that?
A few days after my meeting with the man from the Finance Ministry, I
was window shopping in Kyoto. In what Americans would call a Mom and Pop
store I saw a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label on offer at 2980 yen.
Red label was sitting beside it, priced at 1980 yen. A good selection of
prime Scotch single malts was available at prices between 3000 yen and
4000 yen.
At sterling's current depressed exchange rate against the Japanese
currency, thanks to our coat-tailing the foundering dollar, these prices
translate into #14.75 for a bottle of Red Label, #22.25 for Black Label,
and between #22.25 and #29.85 for single malts. At the exchange rates
prevailing before the recent dollar/sterling slide these yen prices
would have looked even more attractive.
As regular whisky drinkers will recognise, Scotch is now available on
the streets in Japan at prices only marginally above those charged here
in the UK. And that raises a crucial question. By campaigning so hard
for tax equality, has the Scotch Whisky Association undermined the
appeal of our national drink in an export market where, thanks to the
conventions of gift giving and the corporate entertainment market, the
price of the bottle is every bit as important as the quality of the
contents in determining its appeal?
Bluntly, has the campaign waged at GATT and now likely to re-errupt at
the WTO, damaged the image of Scotch as a high-class liquor Japanese
will want to be seen drinking in expensive Ginza bars and giving to
friends and clients as a sought-after gift? Is the unwanted side-effect
of the campaign to turn Scotch into another commodity tipple?
I don't wish to overstate the case. But 10% of the premium Scotch
market in Japan goes directly into gift giving. And another 50% of
premium imported Scotch is consumed in bars. So 60% of total premium
Scotch consumption is influenced, to some extent, by the esteem in which
the product is held. And that esteem is, in turn, linked to the price
tag on the bottle.
The SWA argues that still-protected shochu is being given an unfair
advantage which is being reflected in its sales. But the SWA is being
selective in the statistics it uses.
Its claim that shochu sales have grown 11% since 1989 is true. But
almost all that growth appears to have taken place between 1989 and
1990, recovering most, but not all, of the volumes lost when the tax on
shochu was first raised after the original GATT panel ruling.
Since 1990, on figures given to me by Suntory, the leading Japanese
drinks company with a direct interest in both Japanese and Scotch
whisky, sales of shochu have been virtually flat since 1990.
On the latest annual returns, our whisky industry has shown it can
increase export revenues even when volume sales overseas are falling. I
wonder to what extent it has sown the seeds of the present volume and
value decline in sales of Scotch to Japan, by undermining the
price-sensitive esteem in which our national drink was once held there.

MY DADDY had us out in the street giving it big licks for Major Atlee.
He wasn't a man for Churchill at all. In fact he was practically
apoplectic about Churchill. We were the only family in Cathcart who flew
flags for Labour. Yet my daddy proved prophetic.
Not only did Labour and Major Attlee win, but handsomely too. All
those RAF chaps with handlebar moustaches voted for the socialists, so
did the Two Types. Everybody did in fact: shocked Winston Churchill. Not
very much I suspect.
I have a lovely ceramic jug in my house, probably worth a few bob,
now, a tea-mug, a jar. It is shaped like a hogshead. The handle is
Winston Churchill and the slogan on the mug states ''Roll out the
barrel''. Originally an obscene ''Jass'' song, it came to be part of
British culture, and so did Winston.
Churchill was just over five feet six, a little man. He had red hair.
He ranted and raved and got upset easily. So far he could have been a
Scotsman. He was in the very last cavalry charge -- Omdurman in 1898 --
that the British army engaged itself in. He was a hero in the Boer War
and escaped from prison. He was the Home Secretary when Peter the
Painter and his Anarchist chums set the siege of Sydney Street. He
danced himself daft during the 1920s. His father went demented with
syphilis and his son went worse with drink.
Chaps like myself remember Randolph, his son. Randolph drank more than
the Urban Voltaire does, and said sillier things than Lord Boothby. He
was also a very nice man which is more than could be said for his
father, for Winston was undeniably a statesman. What he wasn't was nice.
And why should he be nice at all? He was dreadful during the General
Strike and sent in the troops to destroy the miners. That poor and
decent man Ted Heath reaped the whirlwind of what that arriviste
Churchill had sown all those years ago, for Churchill sowed such
bitterness among the working classes that he was never forgiven.
He shifted himself from the Tory Party to the Liberal Party and back
again so much the middle-classes never forgave him either. Ah but they
did. We all did. If I was told not to vote for Winston I was also told
to honour him.
And we didn't honour him very much really. We gave him a sort of
knighthood, but then Winston was very much a lord anyway. The
aristocracy hated him more than the miners.
But my dad and his generation went against him and his Government and
quite right too. But, you know, they went into battle because the cause
was right, and because there was a little, red-haired, argumentative,
aggressive, warmongering, determined Briton, a scion of aristocracy and
America -- Winston Churchill. He was voted out in 1945 but, you know, we
owed a lot to Winston then, and we do now too.
Churchill was of course, as English columnist Godfrey Smith says, a
bounder. All his colleagues were cads too. Brendan Bracken, Lords
Birkenhead, and Beaverbrook were small, red-headed, bounders too. Wars
need bounders, and the last war needed one which could see a finest
hour.
I knew and much-liked the man who did the voice of Churchill, Felix
Felton: he lived upstairs from me in Kilburn High Road. Felix did the
voice, often, for Churchill, during the war. Felix got to know Churchill
well. ''What was he like?'' I asked once. ''Pissed, had a lisp. Well,
there was a war on. I was in bloody uniform. Buggers sent me off to
Jugoslavia with Fitz MacLean''. That is an absolutely verbatim exchange
at that. Felix continued, throughout Europe, to do the voice of
Churchill.
We didn't vote for the wee bounder, none of us did, but we never
forgot him either. When he died we buried him decently I think, and
there's more -- no other man in the whole of Britain can ever be
considered as we, as a nation, thought of the little man -- we thought
of him with an affection no other politician could possess. In short,
when Churchill died, my father, and every other socialist, took his hat
off and put it to his breast and knew a great man had gone. And perhaps
a man who had made a difference.
So when you are standing to attention for the war, when you are
thinking of the sacrifices, you may not be thinking of the man who told
the world that we ''shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the
landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we
shall fight in the hills . . .''
The wee bounder ended up with something which, Tory wee sod as he was,
yet brought a moistening to my socialist father's eyes, and does to
mine: ''We shall never surrender.'' We never did and the world is a
better place for it. At the end of the day, Good Old Winnie. I never
thought I'd write that. But I have.

DOUGLAS ROSS, Scottish PR Officer for the British Field Sports
Society, suggests I am asking farmers to write off the loss of 50,000
lambs per year to predators as ''acceptable casualties'' (April 29).
I assume his 1% mortality rate refers to Scotland only as previous
figures released by the BFSS refer to 250,000 lambs annually lost to
foxes in the UK.
However, as the BFSS also claimed that nearly one million people
attended Boxing Day hunts in 1993 I take their figures with a pinch of
salt.
Using current UK sheep industry figures, four million lambs (15% of
births) are lost to exposure and malnutrition each year. It is only
these weak and dying casualties that foxes predate. If farmers want to
reduce lamb losses they should improve their husbandry methods. Healthy
lambs born to healthy ewes are unlikely to fall prey to foxes.
The BFSS use lamb mortalities, real or imagined, as an excuse to ride
roughshod over rural and urban public opinion simply to kill foxes for
fun.

<TEXT>
BRIAN Laudrup, named as the Scottish Football Writers' Player of the
Year, is in line to emulate three of his Rangers colleagues by pulling
off a prestigious double.
The Dane is on a short leet of four to pick up his fellow
professionals' annual award.
The Scottish Professional Footballers' Association awards will be made
at a special dinner in Glasgow on Sunday week, and the men in line for
the top prize are Laudrup, Hibs keeper Jim Leighton, Motherwell striker
Tommy Coyne, and Michael O'Neill, of Hibernian.
But Laudrup is favourite after having made such an impact in his first
season in Scotland and, if he does win, he will follow in the footsteps
of Andy Goram, Mark Hateley, and Ally McCoist, who have done the double
over the last three years.
Yet, just a year ago, Laudrup was not quite sure in which direction
his career was going. ''When I joined Rangers it was very much a case of
it's now or never,'' he said. ''I had spent six years on the Continent
and had a few disappointments.
''It was important for me to do well in my first season, but I never
expected things would go so well.''
Laudrup said that he is convinced Rangers can make it big in Europe.
''If we can make a few quality signings -- and I'm told that will happen
-- we can do well in next season's European Cup,'' he said.
''I have heard talk that we may be seeded in next season's
competition, and if that happens it would be a great bonus. But if we
are not seeded, then we face similar problems to last year when we had
to play AEK Athens at the start of the season. It won't be a question of
whether Rangers are good enough. It will be whether they are good enough
at that particular time.''
On the subject of other big clubs wanting to take him back to the
Continent, Laudrup is clear about his intentions. ''I like the
commitment to the game in Scotland, and I want to see out my contract
here, which means I'll be here for another two years, at least.''
The nominations for the Bell's League Championship/SPFA annual Player
of Year awards are:
Player of the Year -- Tommy Coyne (Motherwell), Jim Leighton
(Hibernian), Michael O'Neill (Hibernian), Brian Laudrup (Rangers).
Young Player -- Steve Crawford (Raith Rovers), Kevin Harper
(Hibernian), Brian McLaughlin (Celtic), Charlie Miller (Rangers).
Division 1 -- Colin Cameron (Raith Rovers), Steve Crawford (Raith
Rovers), Peter Duffield (Hamilton), Jackie McNamara (Dunfermline).
Division 2 -- Warren Hawke (Berwick Rangers), Derek Lilley (Morton),
Derek McInnes (Morton), Marco Rjamaki (Morton).
Division 3 -- David Bingham (Forfar), Michael Geraghty (East
Stirlingshire), Colin McGlashan (Montrose), Gary Orr (Queen's Park).
* STEVE Crawford, of Raith Rovers, is set to leave Stark's Park at the
end of the season, but the 21-year-old is determined to go out on a high
note.
When asked about his intentions for next season, he said: ''I'm
ambitious and if one of the big clubs came in for me, I would take the
chance. I don't think our manager Jimmy Nicholl would stand in my way.''

I READ in the public prints that greatness is to be thrust upon Mr
Ralph Leishman, erstwhile chairman of the Scottish SDP -- remember them?
-- who is now prospective Tory candidate for Argyll and Bute.
Mr Leishman, I read, has been selected to move a resolution on
transport at the Scottish Tory conference. Fearlessly, it will be ''a
resolution praising the Government's policies on transport and
vigorously defending plans to put ScotRail services and those of other
rail operators out for franchising''.
We can hardly wait. In the meantime, Mr Leishman has been good enough
to give us a foretaste of the ''vigorous defence'' which he will offer
in relation to those overnight rail services which are due to disappear
at the end of this month.
He is quoted as saying: ''It is absolutely appalling that BR are
trying to close these services down ahead of privatisation, to prevent
another operator with improved marketing from doing considerably better.
''BR are using technical matters (sic) to claim they are not axing the
service from a particular line. That is not the Government's fault and
it is not the Government's responsibility that attempts are being made
to shut down this line.''
Eh? Even for a former SDP chairman-turned-Tory-candidate, Mr Leishman
sounds like rather a confused citizen. It might be charitable to assist
him in his understanding of these issues before he faces the diminished
ranks of Scottish Tory activists, since even they might be in more
sceptical mood than usual.
So let us be absolutely clear. The overnight services are the first
but certainly not the last victims of the franchising system which Mr
Leishman is anxious to ''vigorously defend''. Second, the threat to
these services stems directly from the actions of Ministers and
officials who are under their direction.
Third -- and at this late stage, perhaps most relevant -- it is
entirely within the power of Ministers to prevent the withdrawal of
these services. If Mr Leishman can grasp that important reality, then he
may yet have something useful to say. So let me explain to him.
Until April 1, 1994, the overnight Anglo-Scottish services were
comfortably contained within the InterCity network which was profitable
overall. If the Tories had a little more sense and less ideology, they
would have claimed that as a success since a profitable network is
almost unique in the railway world.
Instead, Ministers -- and nobody else -- decided to break up InterCity
and insist on ''transparency'', which is the breakdown of revenue and
costs on every service. As a matter of principle, cross-subsidy was to
be eliminated. No longer could east support west, urban support rural,
or day support night.
The implications for the overnight services, which had always lost
money, were obvious. West Coast Main Line didn't want to know about
them. Chris Green, who had seen his beloved InterCity taken away from
him (by Ministers, Mr Leishman), thought he could make a go of them and
at the same time get back into Anglo-Scottish services. So ScotRail took
over responsibility.
Enter at this point, the Franchise Director -- appointed, Mr Leishman,
by the Secretary of State for Transport and, in terms of the Railways
Act, under that Minister's direction. In virtually his first
pronouncement, this official announced on December 14 last year that he
was going to ''end uncertainty'' about the future of the overnight
services.
He was doing this by giving notice that subsidy would be withdrawn
after May 28 from the London-Fort William, London-Carlisle, and
Glasgow-Plymouth sleepers, and all Motorail services. The remaining four
sleepers in each direction would be merged into two trains.
So be absolutely clear before you make your speech, Mr Leishman. The
decision that these services would die was effectively taken last
December since -- like virtually every other service in the country --
there was no prospect of operating them without the allocation of
specific subsidy.
British Rail's decision to keep running a ghost-train over a stretch
of track which would otherwise face a closure inquiry is, of course, a
dirty trick and I hope that they get their comeuppance today in the
Court of Session. But it is only a by-product, presumably approved by
Government, to facilitate withdrawal of the overnight services.
At only one point, it seemed that there had been a breakthrough in
this long campaign. Sir Hector Monro told the Scottish Grand Committee
that of course the services would not be withdrawn until the
consultation was complete. He thought he was being honest. But he was
then silenced and the meaning of his words was denied. Explain that one,
Mr Leishman.
And don't forget to tell the ''representatives'' as they are called --
though one is no longer sure whom they represent -- that the process
applied to the overnight services will also be used to get rid of many
more vulnerable services on the network, through the application of
''transparency'' and the artificial inflation of costs.
So please, Mr Leishman, defend the withdrawal of the sleepers; the
abolition of Motorail; the complete removal of seated accommodation on
overnight services, the decimation which will logically follow. But
please don't insult our intelligence by pretending that it's anyone
else's fault but that of the Conservative Party, whose banner you now
proudly fly.

BRIAN Watson, the Falkland captain, and professional Manoj Parmar were
building a solid opening against Royal High last week. The score ambled
along to 39, at which point Paul Fraser struck the first of his eight
blows.
A mere 16 runs later, it was all over and the league newcomers had
been given a savage demonstration of the gulf between first and second
division cricket.
They face another severe test tomorrow when champions Heriot's pay
their first league visit. A crisp start to the defence of their title
brought smooth victory over Edinburgh Academicals, and Heriot's will
expect to haul in full points from the deflated Fifers.
Royal High face a stiffer examination when they travel to Raeburn
Place for a tilt at Grange. Gordon McGurk has started at Grange with a
bang, almost 200 runs last weekend against Carlton and Aberdeenshire --
and his wicket still intact.
The brothers, Mike and Johnny Everett, are back on a regular basis
after a season when business demands took a heavy toll of their
availability. The bowling, too, has a convincing look now that Pete
Steindl and Graham Hurlbatt have joined forces.
All of which suggests that they will be up there disputing the title
with Heriot's, as will Stenhousemuir who are across the road as guests
of the Academicals. Their burly Australian visitor over the last couple
of seasons, Peter Gardiner, has not been able to finance the trip this
year, but that hardly mattered last week when they ran up the day's top
score in defeating Watsonians.
The Myreside men were naturally disappointed but theirs was an
encouraging performance with the bat and they will be no pushover for
Freuchie.Carlton are at Corstorphine.

STIRLING appear to have found a solid base on which to build a good
challenge for this year's title.
According to captain Bruce Russell, New Zealand professional Kyle
Wealleans, an opening batsman and occasional off-spinner, has added much
needed depth. ''I did not play well last year,'' said Russell, ''and
agreed to play this year as an amateur. Our other fault last year was to
play well in cup competitions but not in the league. Now we are better
all round.''
West Lothian are tomorrow's visitors to Williamfield with their new
pro, Ian Beven, leading the assault.
Strathmore, the champions, are at home to last season's runners-up
Aberdeenshire. With Sanju Mudkavi, second in last year's batting
averages, coming up against Strathie skipper Mark Kelaher, third last
year, there is little doubt that run making rather than wickets should
decide this one.
Fifeshire, with last season's top scorer Ashok Malhotra still at
McKane Park, travel to Ayrshire, while Arbroath County entertain
Forfarshire, and the wee county of Clackmannan visit the vast open
spaces of the North Inch to take on Perthshire.

THE ferocity of the supermarket price war is encapsulated in just two
figures. Tesco is claiming like-for-like sales rising 7%, Kwik Save
concedes like-for-like falls running at 3%.
The dichotomy continues with Tesco talking just three weeks ago of
some improvement in individual customer spend with some initial signs of
trading up. Yesterday, Kwik Save managing director Graeme Bowler said he
is seeing a continuing shift from higher to lower prices.
Appropriately they have something in common in that they have acquired
significant presences in Scotland with Tesco taking Wm Low last
September for #250m, and two months later, Kwik Save rescued the
operating assets of deep-discounter Shoprite for #47m.
The end result is that Kwik Save has seen the first profits setback
since it came under the management control of the Jardine Matheson Dairy
Farm satellite which controls just under 30% of the equity.
Pre-tax profits have fallen 5.8% to #61.6m on sales 4.1% higher at
#1573m, excluding VAT.
However, it did manage to slightly raise gross margins because of
increased chilled and frozen produce in its mix helped by greater buying
power following the Shoprite deal.
Shoprite lost about #2m, split between trading loss and finance cost.
The first step was to start to improve staff morale and fill the
shelves for Christmas in the 92 outlets which had been seriously run
down. It is hoped to convert 60 to the parent company format by August
and the remainder by the year-end.
There is a lot to go for with sales in those now up and running having
risen from #4 per square foot through the group average of #10 to
something slightly higher. Tesco averages #15.80 per square foot each
week and a #1 profit compared with Kwik Save's #12.30 of sales and 49p
profit.
To some extent Kwik Save has brought problems down on its own head. It
has allowed a pool of 350 ''brown'' stores to accumulate out of a
portfolio of the 968 outlets as at the end of March. These older units
are being refurbished over a two-year period and were almost entirely,
but not quite, responsible for the 3.4% fall in volume in the first 28
weeks of the trading year.
Of course it is easy to criticise but action could have been taken two
or three years earlier to present shops more acceptable to the shopper.
The other problem is price deflation which amounted to just 0.1% in
the period overall. But that conceals the impact of higher tax and
manufacturers prices on high-volume, low-margin items such as cigarettes
and drink and the need to extend the various offers such as the 137 No
Frills and Kwik Savers which will account for almost 10% of turnover.
Overall grocery food deflation is estimated to have been 4% during the
winter. But Mr Bowler warned that fresh food price inflation is
currently 14% which translates to about 3.5% in the average shopping
basket. The question is whether the supermarkets will be able to pass
this on successfully to the customer.
The good news for Kwik Save is that the level of competition is easing
with the disappearance of some of the smaller discounters with Budgen
giving up its discount business. Argyll has sold off Lo-Cost and at
least one US chain retreated back across the Atlantic.
A major asset is that it has the strongest balance sheet in the sector
and will be able to withstand whatever is thrown at it in the medium
term.
Profits this year seem set to decline from #136m to perhaps #127m,
ignoring exceptionals, which would leave the shares, at 573p, up 12p as
like-for-like sale were not as bad as feared, trading at just under 11
times likely earnings.
The troops are being encouraged by a 3.5% rise in the interim dividend
to 5.95p indicating a 20p total for a 4.4% yield.

GLASGOW'S specialist engineering company Clyde Blowers is setting up a
high-powered Singapore office in July to develop massive export
potential in Far Eastern markets, particularly China, where the company
hopes to set up a new factory.
Chairman and chief executive Jim McColl said the Chinese market for
Clyde Blowers' specialist gear that cleans the insides of boilers and
heat exchangers in power stations and large factories was huge.
''Sixty percent of all equipment sold for power generation over the
next 10 to 15 years will go to China,'' he said, predicting that Clyde
Blowers would establish a joint venture there by the end of this year.
Clyde Blowers already has a local representative in Beijing and Mr
McColl said business with China could grow to about #80m per year over
the next decade.
That is three times company's present annual turnover of #27m, but Mr
McColl said the Chinese market ''could be worth a lot more if I set my
goals a bit higher''.
Clyde Blowers' Singapore office will be headed by Bill Thompson, a
senior company executive who has been learning Chinese for the past year
at Glasgow University.
He will assume the newly-created position of managing director (Asia)
and will visit China in July as part of a delegation led by the
President of the Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine, before taking up
residence in Singapore.
Mr McColl said Clyde Blowers hoped to manufacture its boiler-cleaning
equipment, which is widely used in oil refineries and paper factories as
well as power stations, in China in collaboration with a local partner.
The Scottish company would transfer specialist technology and in
return would enjoy the benefits of cheap labour. ''We were talking to
one Chinese company with 300 employees who together earned the same as
14 of ours in Scotland,'' Mr McColl said.
Earlier this week Clyde Blowers announced the shutdown of its
manufacturing operation in Belgium to concentrate its present production
of boiler-cleaning equipment at a new plant in Glasgow.

EXCLUSIVE BY ROBERT POWELL
THE Wood Group, which provides contracting, engineering and design
services for the offshore oil industry, expects export business to
treble to #250m over the next four years as new markets open up in Latin
America and the Far East.
Sir Ian Wood, the chairman and managing director of the Aberdeen-based
group, said it was also contemplating a new venture into aero-engines in
the United States.
''Overseas business last year was about #90m. Our present plan shows
that growing to #250m in the next four years, so there is a very major
drive to develop overseas business,'' he told the Herald yesterday on
the sidelines of a business seminar in Glasgow.
Sir Ian said the Wood Group had recently bought a company in Argentina
to develop business in Latin America and it was now looking at an
acquisition in Malaysia to act as a base for operations in the Far East.
The Wood Group last week reported a 7.3% advance in its 1994 pre-tax
profits to #20.5m and a 20% rise in turnover to #291m, with margins
squeezed by heavy investment in its North Sea operations.
Sir Ian said the Wood Group had improved the productivity and
efficiency of its offshore activities significantly over the last three
to four years and was now in a good position to market its skills
abroad.
He said a wave of privatisations sweeping Latin America was opening up
new opportunities in the continent's oil industry, particularly in
Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia.
But the big prize is South-east Asia, where rapid economic growth is
creating a virtually insatiable appetite for more energy.
''They are desperately short of power and desperately short of their
own energy resources, so almost regardless of what happens to the world
price of crude oil they are going to be exploiting their oil on the fast
track,'' Sir Ian said.
He saw particular market potential in Malaysia, where he is flying to
today, and in Vietnam and China.
Sir Ian said the Wood Group, which started off 30 years ago as a small
Aberdeen fishing company, was now planning a new venture into the
aero-engine market.
Building on its skills acquired in servicing gas turbine engines in
the North Sea, it hoped to link up with an aero-engine company in the
United States, he said.
''It would be a very major move because the aero market is about 10
times the size of the industrial (gas turbine) market and it's one we
haven't been in at all,'' Sir Ian said.
The group was looking closely at opportunities in the US because that
was the biggest domestic aero-engine market in the world, he said.
''The market has been very depressed and might be about to recover so
from our point of view it might not be a bad time to look at it,'' Sir
Ian said. ''We are working on that right now.''

<TEXT>
SHARES of motor trading group Henlys soared 44p to 380p yesterday on a
#41m expansion drive in bus and coach building in northern England and
Canada. It is buying double-decker maker Northern Counties for #10m and
has entered into a #31m partnership deal with Volvo in Canada.
''Northern Counties gives us a leading position in the UK
double-decker bus market,'' chief executive Robert Wood commented on the
acquisition of the Wigan-based firm. Henlys is also putting #31m into
Prevost Car, a coach and bus body manufacturer based in Quebec which
supplies the North American market. The company will have a 49% share of
Prevost with Volvo owning 51%.
The expansion moves are being financed by a share placing at 330p and
bank loans.
The investment in Prevost will give Henlys a major shareholding in a
quality coach builder and allow it access to the important North
American coach and bus market which has recovered from the slump in the
early nineties. ''Volvo's confidence in Henlys as an international
partner is a clear demonstration of the progress that has been made by
our coach and bus operations,'' said Mr Wood.
Bus and coach businesses have been the main impetus behind a financial
improvement at Henlys in recent years and accounted for the largest part
of the group's record #16.1m pre-tax profit last year.

LLOYD'S underwriting syndicates struggling to meet their liabilities
on ''long-tail'' policies -- and indeed all those who have had disputes
with insurance companies -- will be heartened by the failure of Eagle
Star to limit its obligation to pay out on a reinsurance policy.
The company originally accepted a policy for a one-off premium from
syndicate 640 in 1973, obliging it to cover any claims against the
syndicate arising from 1965 and earlier.
Paul Toomey, run-off manager for the syndicate, explained that even in
1973 his father Len, who was the underwriter at the time, was worried
about potential liabilities which could arise from American casualty
business he had taken on.
However, there was no conception of the nightmare of asbestosis and
pollution-related claims that lay ahead and now threaten Lloyd's very
existence.
Eagle Star paid all claims under the policy for 18 years and then in
1991 stopped, claiming the syndicate should have to give definite proof
it was liable to pay the claims which were arising. This was the subject
of a High Court action, where the judgment and appeal favoured the
syndicate.
Then further issues were raised by Eagle Star relating to the original
information provided by the syndicate in 1973. This action also failed
and the company was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.
Now Eagle Star has reached a settlement with the syndicate which
completely reinstates the policy. It has paid more than #10m to settle
outstanding claims plus interest and 75% of the syndicate's #750,000
costs.
The company now faces the prospect of having to pay up for any future
claims which may arise indefinitely. Claims on such policies are still
coming forward relating to events dating back to the forties. The
company says it is fully reserved for claims under the policy.

LOOKING back, I realise my tactics were all wrong. Emotional pleas,
even cool, scientific arguments (''That man said it would take 20 years
for the roots to reach the foundations'') didn't work. Local opinion,
even local bureaucracy was against me. I was a voice in the wilderness,
and the wilderness was the lush frondescence of an arboreal behemoth.
Round about now the behemoth should be pushing its fists through their
glossy casing and flexing five fat fingers: preparing its candles for
their summer conflagration and its conkers for the autumn arsenal. But
its sap has been zapped by chainsaw and axe and its glorious green
energy knackered in the bud. My chestnut tree is now a funeral pyre of
logs.
Arboricide. Would it have made any difference if I'd built a
tree-house and taken to the branches like the anti-motorway dryads of
Stanworth Valley? These past few days I have envied them the dappled
light and leafy rustling of their May morns, and in principle I'm on
their side. But the treetop protesters' nine-month occupation of a
Lancashire wood does seem a little privileged to one who has tried to
defend her tree with words alone. They bring to mind the lugubrious face
of an old editor of mine who, during the Iranian revolution, used to
look at the latest agency pictures of mass demonstrations in the streets
of Teheran and sigh: ''Have these people got no work to go to?''
The luxury of the long-term roost was not available to this
eco-warrior, but how I would have loved a bijou bungalow in the arms of
my chestnut tree! The child in every adult, the Wendy in every woman
craves a tree-house; sleeping with the squirrels, waking with the birds,
tucked out of harm's way above the forest floor. Tarzan swung on
creepers but Jane wove palm-fronds into curtains and made cushions from
banana-leaves.
Trees occupy our subconscious like parallel nervous systems. Their
roots go back a long way in the collective memory of humankind. We
feared them and we worshipped them. We honoured some and despised
others. In early Britain great swathes of forest were cleared not for
grain or settlement, but to disperse the malevolence of woodland
spirits. But the oak was sacred to the Druids, and Aeneas plucked the
Golden Bough to protect him in the Underworld, and there were folk in
the Highlands who commissioned the rowan to keep witches at bay.
Even today we're arboreally ambivalent, ascribing vice and virtue to
different species. The Caledonian pine is a Good Tree; the Sitka spruce
is a Bad Tree. Hardwoods are valuable, softwoods disposable. The
glittering beeches of planned parkland are cherished more than the
sombre conifers of planned forest.
We still fear the wild wild woods, we dread their gloom and their
furtive noises. The only person I've met who felt ''safe'' in dense
woodland was the late writer Jessie Kesson. ''I feel cosy among trees,
protected by them,'' she once told me. She put it down to her Elgin
childhood and the forest path to her grandmother's house. No Little Red
Riding Hood she.
My own childhood had its share of woodland, too, but none which
defined so precisely a place of welcome. Our various gardens (we moved
about a bit) had flowers and shrubs and grass and vegetables, but no
trees. In adult life came flats without gardens and finally our present
house. I felt peculiarly pleased when we also took possession of three
old apple trees at the back and one young chestnut at the front. At last
I was a tree-owner.
That was nearly 10 years ago, when the chestnut was only a teenager.
Remember ''Plant a Tree for 73''? According to local lore the previous
owners of our house had stuck a conker in the ground in 1973 and
produced a sapling. It thrived in our small city garden. By the time we
arrived it was 15ft high, with wonderfully symmetrical branches just
beginning to overhang the pavement.
It grew and grew, stunting everything in its shadow, and a long root
snaked like a vein beneath the skin of the lawn towards the house. A
tree man came and pruned the branches, but next spring the foliage
arrived in triplicate. Enormous leaves descended in autumn; you could
have slept 50 Babes-in-the-Wood under their blanket. We were kept busy
clearing them from the pavement, where they were dangerous when wet.
Finally the terrace began dropping hints.
''You should hear what our gardener says about your tree!'' said one
neighbour, feigning amusement. ''It's a forest tree, he says. It should
never have been planted in the city.''
I didn't like to tell her I thought all trees were forest trees, or
that the streets of Paris are full of chestnuts, but another neighbour
raised the question of the Parisian genus. ''Have you thought of
pollarding?'' she asked. ''That's how they keep the chestnuts under
control in Paris.''
By this time only the local children were on my side. My husband, who
had always been hostile (''It blocks the light, it ruins the grass, it's
anti-social''), appointed himself executive executioner and, worn out, I
conceded it would have to go, distancing myself from the necessary
arrangements. This won the tree a reprieve of two springs. It was spared
for a third year when I pointed out that we'd better get planning
permission, secretly hoping the bureaucrats would turn us down.
They didn't. Back came a letter inviting us to proceed. It described
the tree as ''inappropriate'' for its site and the following Sunday, as
if by telepathy, a jobbing tree-man appeared with a youth and a chainsaw
and offered to fell it for #50. My husband fell upon him. I interfered
only to demand that he left us some logs, then went into mourning.
They had cleared all the branches when the chainsaw broke down. For
another week the chestnut lingered, reduced to its noble column of
trunk. I had the desperate idea that perhaps the column could be carved
into a wood sculpture, and even phoned the art college to ask if they
were interested. But no-one answered the phone and fate took over. The
next day, while I was out, the trunk disappeared; the jobbing tree-man
had somewhat improbably returned to finish the job.
So I know how they feel down in Stanworth Valley and in Pollok Park,
and we don't even need a motorway where we live. Six weeks on and the
vacuum in the garden still causes a ghostly ache; while the last of last
autumn's leaves, dried and pressed, is pinned to the kitchen wall like a
crucified hand.

MOTOR RACING
THE new driving force of Formula 1, David Coulthard, turned away from
the accusations of Jean Alesi, who claimed the young Scot had driven an
''incorrect'' race in the San Marino Grand Prix, and ran head on into
the glowing accolades of a group of Italy's most knowledgeable
motor-racing fans.
Coulthard, who finished fourth at Imola last Sunday despite spinning,
pit stops, and a 10-second penalty, was asked to remain in the region to
be honoured by the people of Brisighella who dismissed Alesi's scathing
criticisms.
The Frenchman, who has Sicilian blood coursing through his veins and
may be prone to over-reaction, was unhappy that he could not overtake
Coulthard and felt the 24-year-old from Twynholm was deliberately
obstructive.
''He drove an incorrect race,'' Alesi complained to reporters after
having finished second behind Coulthard's Williams' team-mate Damon
Hill.
''I have driven with other aggressive drivers but Coulthard zig-zagged
and I didn't like that. He also touched my car on a corner and I was
lucky to stay in the race.''
Coulthard refused to be drawn into a controversy, but the people of
the Imola area moved to put 30-year-old Alesi in his place by awarding
the younger driver the prestigious Lorenzo Bandini Trophy for having
been the outstanding driver of the 1995 San Marino Grand Prix. The
porcelain trophy is presented only when the benefactors have been
inspired by a particular driving performance and the ability of
Coulthard won them over.
The Scot's success in holding off Alesi while also trying to overtake
Hill in the early stages of the Imola race was the most exciting part of
the contest and the entire town of Brisighella, where Bandini was born,
turned out to honour him.
'It was remarkable,'' he said yesterday. ''It was as though they were
greeting royalty. Lorenzo Bandini's family were there and I was more
than delighted to stay on in Imola and accept their accolade. I think it
puts anything Alesi said into perspective.''
Bandini, who drove for Ferrari and who was killed during the 1967
Monaco Grand Prix, is a legend in Italian motor-racing history and
especially the Imola region. ''I have to admit also that I was surprised
when I was told they wanted to honour my drive and even though many
people have said they thought I drove a good race I am still
disappointed,'' Coulthard added.
''From a personal point of view, the same kind of car I drive finished
first while mine was fourth. I spun and had four pit stops, three
scheduled and one because of a 10-second penalty for having exceeded the
speed limit in the pit lane, but these were mistakes on my part.''
A man in search of perfection, Coulthard has used his extended stay in
Imola to further test his Williams-Renault car hoping to make the minor
alterations which may help him achieve his first F1 triumph in the
Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona a week on Sunday and he stressed that
nothing Alesi said will have any kind of effect on him.
''I didn't want to conduct any dialogue through the newspapers and I
went to see Alesi after the race and asked him to explain what he had
been talking about,'' Coulthard said. ''We have sorted it out, but I
firmly believe that if you have a problem with someone you don't go
running to his mother or go to the papers and tell the whole world.
Alesi should have come to me.
''If I had done anything even a little dodgy during the race I'm
certain the authorities would have taken action because I am a new
driver and because of what happened at Imola last year when two drivers
were killed.''
Coulthard was referring to the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland
Ratzenberger, whose accidents prompted safety improvements costing #4.5m
to the circuit.

Spain
THE Scottish Rugby Union, for so long seen to be dragging its feet as
the game moves ever closer to a semi-professional position, has taken
the unprecedented step of paying its players at the World Cup in South
Africa.
The Herald understands that each member of the 26-strong playing squad
plus, even more uniquely, the coaches and medical team will each receive
#3000 from union funds as a special one-off payment for their efforts in
South Africa.
The special payment is in addition to International Rugby Football
Board regulations governing tour allowances. Under the ''personal and
communication allowance'' squad members are eligible for #25 a day.
If Scotland reach the final then they will have been away for 40 days,
representing a total payment of #1000 to be augmented by the #3000 from
the SRU. In special cases where financial disadvantage can be proved,
players are eligible for a maximum payment of an additional #45 a day.
The decision to recompense Scotland's rugby representatives in South
Africa is a historic landmark and denotes an enlightened approach from
the union which, hitherto, has always been portrayed as a reactionary
force determined to thwart mainly Antipodean efforts to push the game
ever closer to full professionalism.
The initiative to reward the squad to the tune of #3000 per man has,
apparently, been taken after careful consideration of the strict IRFB
regulations governing amateurism and there is no doubt that if it was
felt that the rules were being breached then the payments would not have
been sanctioned.
The fact that the coaches, Dougie Morgan and Richie Dixon, alongside
the medics, are also to receive the special South Africa payment is
recognition of the work that they put in which, in many cases, is more
time-consuming than that of the players.
The Herald understands that the team manager, Duncan Paterson, is the
only member of the official party who will not receive the #3000 payment
but that the deal had been negotiated with his full agreement and that
he had not pressed to be included in the share-out.
The cash bonanza is just the latest example of Murrayfield largesse.
The union has already agreed that, again in an unprecedented step, wives
and girlfriends will benefit from a two-week, all-expenses paid trip
reckoned to be costing around #1000 a head while their menfolk are
taking part in the tournament.
The South African cash, seen as a reward for the commitment that the
RWC squad has displayed, is entirely separate from the money that the
players are already earning from the Players' Trust Fund. That fund,
administered by the players' agent, the former Scotland captain Ian
McLauchlan, is serviced by cash earned by the players for non-rugby
related ventures such as marketing promotions and personal appearances.
The biggest single contributor to the fund is the team sponsor, Famous
Grouse, the whisky company having pumped #100,000 into the fund this
season alone.
Precise figures are difficult to come by, but it would not be too wide
of the mark to estimate that, after the World Cup, long-term members of
the Scotland squad will have earned around #10,000 throughout the
international season, with particularly high-profile players being in
receipt of more than that.
The decision to recompense the players in South Africa is recognition
of the fact that the Scots deserve to be competiting on the same
financial playing field as New Zealand, France, Australia and South
Africa where, historically, administrators have taken a more
laissez-faire attitude towards IRFB cash guidelines.
It was at the first Rugby World Cup in the Antipodeas in 1987 that
northern hemisphere players had their eyes opened as to the financial
rewards that were being made available to southern rivals.
Since then, due mainly to pressure from players who were experiencing
great difficulty balancing the competing commitments of family, career,
and international rugby, the game has been moving with stealth towards,
at the very least, a semi-professional stance.
The unique decision by the SRU to reward its World Cup squad is a
tacit admission -- if not of that the game is moving inexorably towards
professionalism -- then certainly of the huge commitments now demanded
of players who aspire to play rugby at the highest level.

STUART TROTTER believes that the replacement of income support for
mortgage interest payments (ISMI) with private insurance is ''probably a
good idea'' (May 3). Over 556,000 people claimed #1.2 billion in 1993,
the cost to society of increasing numbers of marginal households being
drawn into mortages because there is no rental choice.
Private insurance can only be supported if it will provide at least as
comprehensive a system of support as ISMI. It will not.
Not everyone will qualify for insurance: health problems or insecure
employment equal bad risk. The single biggest change in the UK labour
market in recent years, of course, has been the growth in temporary,
part-time, and self-employed work. Mortgage arrears will increase, the
cost of housing will increase, and only a select few good risks will
benefit.
Insurance companies and economists have long understood that private
insurance cannot provide a comprehensive alternative to state-funded
unemployment benefit. The market does not work and will not provide a
fair and efficient alternative to ISMI.
The real agenda is the privatisation of welfare and the planned
reduction in social security expenditures on housing benefit and income
support. After decades of moving support away from bricks and mortar to
means-tested subsidies that trap the poor, blind expansion of home
ownership has sucked in households for whom long-term borrowing will be
increasingly difficult.
The Government needs to act on housing policy if it is going to
address social security problems like ISMI.

HE may be anxious to keep a low profile, but, when stirred, Jim McLean
can be relied upon to leave those around him shaken and yesterday the
Dundee United chairman had some harsh words for the club's players, who
are facing, perhaps, the most important match of their careers.
Along with Aberdeen, the Tannadice side have been sucked into the
relegation quicksands and both clubs face one another at Pittodrie
tomorrow in a match which holds great appeal to those genuinely
interested in the welfare of these two clubs and also Scottish football
in general.
United manager Billy Kirkwood, who, ideally, would have waited until
the end of the season before deciding whether or not to leave his post
at Ibrox, wonders if the game can afford a scenario in which his side
and Aberdeen are relegated, but McLean sees it differently.
''If the recent talks about reconstruction had been held because of a
need to save us and Aberdeen then that would have been diabolical,'' he
said.
''I believe that, mostly, you get what you deserve and we have to
accept whatever comes our way after Saturday's match. If Dundee United
can't finish somewhere in the top eight of Scottish football then we
deserve to be relegated.''
The chairman also stressed that he does not have any sympathy with the
players, pointing out: ''I don't feel sorry for them at all. It's the
supporters I feel for and they have been sold short. I'm not having a go
at Ivan Golac, but we deserve to be where we are.''
Golac, of course, was dismissed after United's run in the Scottish Cup
came to an end, but had cup defeat arrived sooner so, too, would Golac's
end, so far as United were concerned. However, United knew they would
have been ridiculed had they sacked a manager while he was undefeated in
the cup, but there is little doubt the club believe too many mistakes
were made in the previous reign and Kirkwood is now having to cope with
the effects.
Changes were made to the playing staff and few of them met with all
round approval and United are not performing as robustly as in the past.
Kirkwood has the added problem of having to cope without Billy McKinlay,
Gordan Petric, Dave Bowman, and Brian Welsh, who are all suspended and
will have no alternative than to turn to younger players like Grant
Johnston and Robbie Winters.
Yet, he believes those still available can see the club through this
traumatic time, but that United should be two matches away from
relegation has wounded McLean, who shaped the club and made them
successful at home and abroad.
''But it isn't about Jim McLean, this club is much more important than
any one person,'' he said. ''This club won the league, the cup, and were
in a European final.
''The European nights were magnificent and I would give almost
anything to have them back, but the league championship is the most
important thing and we should be looking to finish at least fourth.
''That might sound like pessimism to some supporters, but it isn't. It
is realism when you consider the resources.''
Pessimism or not United, who have fallen a long way since the glory
days of Europe are in jeopardy of sliding even deeper into mediocrity
which can be a bleak domain without exits.
''We are in a dire situation,'' McLean continued, ''and it hurts me as
much as any supporter.
''The players have not worked, they have not been disciplined and
maybe we are being punished. If so, we must accept it.
''However, Dundee United are on the way back even if the worst comes
to the worst. We've got things right now.''
As he spoke he glanced across to Kirkwood and it was clear McLean is
willing to entrust United's future to the new manager. ''Any major
changes which may have to be made will be made by Billy Kirkwood. My
position here is not important now,'' McLean said.
Kirkwood said that he had not given any thought to life after the
premier division and doesn't want to look that far ahead preferring to
deal with tomorrow's match and then the final one, against Celtic at
Tannadice next week, but he does fear Scottish football also could lose
out if Aberdeen and United are lost to the top league.
It would be harder for them to incorporate the right kind of boys into
youth systems which have been successful at both clubs and with the
consequences that might have on the wider game in mind Kirkwood is
saddened that so many might want to see United or Aberdeen -- or both --
relegated.
''Are we good enough as a nation to cope with such possible losses?''
he asked. ''Yet, I know that there are a lot of club managers gloating
over the position in which United and Aberdeen find themselves.''

THE West Indies' crown has slipped badly -- but they remain red-hot
favourites to walk all over England this summer.
After enjoying 15 years of near non-stop triumph, Caribbean cricket
fans are in a state of shock following Australia's magnificent 2-1 Test
series victory.
And Richie Richardson's devastated team have just a few days to pull
themselves together before starting a four-month tour of England that
must suddenly seem more daunting than usual.
There is no doubt the 1995 West Indian model cannot compare with those
great Caribbean sides of years gone by.
Their batting has looking brittle ever since that Rolls Royce of
opening partnerships, Greenidge and Haynes, was dismantled.
A once frightening four-pronged pace attack now relies heavily on the
ageing and overworked double act of Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh.
And there is evidence of a lack of harmony and unity within
Richardson's team.
But, having considered all the facts and figures from the past few
weeks, bookmakers Coral yesterday saw no reason to change their odds for
this summer's six-Test series.
They still make West Indies 2-1 on favourites for victory over England
and the draw at 7-2. And their price for a 6-0 'blackwash' remains no
better than 20-1.
A wager on Mike Atherton's men suddenly looks an attractive
proposition. But if Ray Illingworth decides to back them -- and his
ability to get English cricket moving in the right direction again --
with some hard cash it will have nothing to do with recent results in
the Caribbean.
''If anything, I think Australia's victory makes our task harder this
summer, not easier,'' said chairman of selectors and team manager
Illingworth.
''The West Indies will be very upset at losing their unbeaten record
and they'll be trying like hell to bounce straight back. They will want
to show everyone they can still play like world champions.''
Illingworth was the last man to captain England to a series victory
over West Indies -- 26 years ago.
Since then, it has been almost exclusively one-way traffic. The
Windies have won nine out of 11 series -- and drawn the other two. And
51 Tests have produced just five English victories.
So, will it be any different this summer? Could the bookmakers be
wrong?
Possibly. If England can steer clear of injuries, field a settled
side, and consistently produce performances like those in which they
beat West Indies in Barbados (1994), South Africa at The Oval (1994),
and Australia in Adelaide (three months ago) then anything is possible.
The West Indies, on the other hand, have something to prove again --
and that makes them potentially more dangerous than if they had just
preserved an unbeaten Test series record against all countries which
stretched back to 1980.
Curiously, a player who has not made a Test appearance for two years
could hold the key.
Ian Bishop was the latest in the long line of fearsome Caribbean fast
bowlers until two serious back injuries almost ended his career.
Now Bishop is on the comeback trail and if he proves fit enough to
join forces with Ambrose and Walsh then England's batsmen could be in
for a torrid time yet again this summer.
The West Indies may be down at the moment, but, potentially, they are
like wounded tigers -- ready to snarl back from the moment they arrive
at Gatwick on Monday morning. Squad:
Richardson (captain), Campbell, Williams, Lara, Hooper, Adams,
Arthurton, Chanderpaul, Murray, Browne, Gibson, W Benjamin, Ambrose,
Walsh, K Benjamin, Bishop, Dhanraj.

RALLYING
THE top five places in Corsica's round of the World Rally Championship
were unchanged yesterday when the rally halted in the coastal resort of
Calvi.
Ford team-mates Bruno Thiry, of Belgium, and Frenchman Francois
Delecour were 35 seconds apart after 14 of the 22 special stages, with
five-times Tour de Corse winner, Didier Auriol, in third place a further
two seconds behind.
Thiry delivered a stunning performance on the first of yesterday's six
narrow, timed speed-tests which he said ''was for everyone to take
notice of.''
Delecour, winner in 1993, attacked but dropped back when his Escort's
gearbox lost two of its six gears. ''I think Bruno must have been taking
risks over the bumps,'' he commented.
Auriol admitted he was driving as hard as possible but could not match
the pace of the two Escort drivers in his Toyota Celica.
Only one second separates fourth-placed Carlos Sainz from his Subaru
team-mate, Italian Piero Liatti. The Spaniard has made several changes
to the suspension on his Impreza in an attempt to make it perform to his
satisfaction.
Colin McRae is in seventh place in the third Subaru in only his third
attempt at this specialised rally.
Italian Andrea Aghini driving a Lancer for Andrew Cowan's Mitsubishi
team has slipped from fourth to sixth. His team-mate, Tommi Makinen from
Finland, has moved up two places to tenth.
The rally finishes in the island's capital, Ajaccio, this afternoon.
Leading positions (after 14 stages):
1, B Thiry/S Prevot (both Belgium), Ford Escort, 3hr 15min 59sec; 2, F
Delecour/C Francois (both France), Ford Escort, 3-16-34; 3, D Auriol/D
Giraudet (both France), Toyota Celica, 3-16-36; 4, C Sainz/L Moya (both
Spain), Subaru Impreza, 3-17-20; 5, P Liatti/A Alessandrini (both
Italy), Subaru Impreza, 3-17-21; 6, A Aghini/S Farnocchia (both Italy),
Mitsubishi Lancer, 3-17-32; 7, C McRae/D Ringer (both Britain), Subaru
Impreza, 3-17-44.

Football Round-up
DUNDEE United will be pressed to provide proof following their
complaint that their former manager Ivan Golac had been illegally
approached by Celtic.
The Scottish League Management committee was yesterday informed that a
letter of complaint had been received from United.
United had acted as they believed that Celtic, in defending their
actions over the approach to their now manager Tommy Burns when he was
at Kilmarnock, had stated to the SFA that they had also had talks with
Golac.
Following the meeting in Glasgow, secretary Peter Donald said: ''We
will be writing to Dundee United asking them to supply proof before
discussing the matter further.''
* THE premier division club which takes part in the play-off with the
side second top of the first division, will play at home first. If
Airdrie, who are in the Scottish Cup final on May 27, get to that second
top place they could get some relief. The committee would look again at
the dates for the play-offs which are due on May 21 and 25.
* SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown will be looking to build a new midfield
when he takes the international squad to Japan later this month, and one
man who will certainly figure in his plans is Nottingham Forest's Scott
Gemmill, whose father Archie won 43 caps.
Gemmill, an under-21 internationalist, is back in form after a
disappointing spell and will be given the chance to fight his way into
Scotland's European Championship squad when Scotland take on Japan and
Ecuador on the tour.
Scotland's midfield problems are enormous, with Celtic's Paul McStay
and John Collins ruled out of the Japanese trip because they will be
involved in the Tennents Scottish Cup final against Airdrie on May 27.
National captain Gary McAllister and Rangers' Stuart McCall also will be
missing because of injury.
Brown will leave announcement of his squad next Wednesday to assistant
Alex Miller, of Hibernian, because he will be in Bratislava at a FIFA
coaching seminar.
Others who could be in the squad are Chelsea's Craig Burley and Paul
Bernard, of Oldham, who would see inclusion as a chance to win a move
back to Scotland.
* BILL McMurdo has been awarded Scotland's first FIFA agent's licence
and he may end up the only one with that official standing. The SFA
confirmed last night that the Glasgow-based promoter has been accepted
under the world ruling body's new screening process.
Four others interviewed earlier in the year by the SFA have not yet
had their applications forwarded to FIFA in Switzerland. In order that
the applications be complete a #100,000 bank bond must be lodged and
McMurdo is the only one to have put the guarantee in place.
Jake Duncan, Jim McArthur, Blair Morgan and Raymond Sparkes were all
seen at Park Gardens, but that is as far as their efforts for acceptance
have gone.
The SFA's Bill Richardson warned clubs and players that they cannot
any longer deal with agents who do not hold the new FIFA licence.
McMurdo has around 30 players out of contract this summer including
Stephen Wright, Darren Jackson, Scott Booth, John Robertson, Mark
McNally, Steve Crawford, and Derek Ferguson. Around 40 others are also
expected to be in the market for a new deal at the end of June.

IT was good to see Andy Wightman opening up the debate on the land
question (April 15). As Henry George was extensively referred to and
quoted from in the Herald Essay, however, may I make clear the
following?
Henry George would not have interested himself in debates upon land
use. He saw too clearly that distorted patterns of land use arise from
distorted patterns of land tenure.
The question of land tenure was by no means to him a primarily
countryside matter. He recognised it as a question ''that affects every
man, every woman and every child. The land question is simply another
name for the great labour question.''
It is in the cities, in fact, that the highest land values are to be
found since pressures of population on land are highest there, and it is
these distorted land values which are the killing ingredient in the high
rents and heavy mortgages townspeople are forced to endure; and small
businesses too.
Henry George would resolutely have opposed any such measures as the
forming of ''land trusts'' to ''intervene in the land market''. His
radical proposal instead recognised the ancient ethic of collecting 100%
annually from each occupant of land its full rental value.
This simple measure goes to the root of the problem by cancelling out
those false capital values attaching to land, which are after all but
the prize of uncollected rental ones. What need, then, of the creaky
furniture of land trusts, et al?
Henry George would have opposed, moreover, the use of public (ie
taxpayers') money to buy up land, on three specific counts:
Why should some of the people pay over their hard-won earnings to set
some other of the people free while they themselves still suffer under
the same cruel land monopoly?
Why pay over a hefty lump sum to that same land ownership which has
already -- for decades and centuries -- milked the people of their
proper dues?
The buying up of land, under whatever pretext, but cements more firmly
into the public psyche the ongoing false belief in land as capital.
Finally, our European counterparts unfortunately do not ''understand
the land issue very clearly'' at all. Various artificial regulations
they may have imposed upon the underlying land monopoly structure, aimed
at preventing its worst abuses, but these all leave land as firmly
ensconced as ever in its false role as capital.
Oh, Henry George, we need thee now!

ALEX FLEMING is right that there is a language myth in Scottish
history (The Bruce, April 24), but French was literally the lingua
franca of medieval western Christendom. The de Brus' were as French as
the Plantagenet kings of England and the Capetian kings of France.
When John Balliol capitulated to Edward I in 1293 he said: ''Sire, jeo
suy vostre homme de realme de Escoce.'' When Brus' father taxed Edward I
with conferring the Scottish crown on him, he is said to have replied:
''Ne avons rien autre chose a fere
Que a vous realmes de ganere.''
In 1302, Brus himself reached an agreement with Edward I about his
''droit'', his right in Scotland.
Brus would share his namesake's Norman pride expressed at the battle
of the Standard by Walter Espec, ''For why should we despair of victory
when victory has been given to our race (the Normans) as if in fee from
the most High?'' A sentiment echoed some three centuries later by Henry
V when he said, ''Mais il est bien voir que la victoire n'est pas en la
multitude de people . . . mais en la puissance de Dieu.''

FROM personal experience of hill farming I wish to congratulate Anne
Simpson on her descriptive and honestly portrayed article covering the
life of a typical hill farmer (April 24).
What hands-on experience allows Louise Middledorp to spout the way she

if he knew where his drinking water came. He answered: ''The Spikit.''

Speaking as a ''crank, weirdo, or pundit'', to use his description of

recollection of the evidence is rather different from his.
I recall fishermen describing the threat to their livelihoods from
pollution and the reputation of the clean seas of the Hebrides; the
description of Glensanda, Scotland's only other superquarry, and how
dust blows from that quarry across Loch Linnhe to the Appin shore; how
Glensanda's visual intrusion far exceeds the original planning
conditions; how Redland's QC tried to fool witnesses into accepting that
the Harris superquarry was the price Harris had to pay for the financial
support coming to the Highlands and Islands under the European Union's
Objective One programme.
Neither do I recognise the ''empty island'' in John Macleod's
diatribe. We stayed in new bunkhouse accommodation recently established
by a young Edinburgh couple, returned to live on the family croft at
Borve.
It was crowded with competitors and supporters recently arrived for
the Western Isles Challenge.
On the ferry cars and vans carried the canoes and mountain bikes of
the 40 other teams taking part in this event, first established last
year by local people in Harris.
It would be nice if, the next time John Macleod writes about the
superquarry, he first opens his eyes and ears to what is really
happening at the inquiry and in the local communities.

IT IS clear from articles which appear from time to time that there is
still some misapprehension about the employment benefits to Harris from
the proposed development at Lingerbay.
According to Professor Peter Wood, expert economic witness for Redland
Aggregates Ltd, giving evidence at the public inquiry, 43 out of the
estimated total of 223 jobs at full production from the quarry would
come to Harris residents.
Professor Wood calculated that about one-third of the 100 direct jobs
at the quarry, ie 33, would go to Harris residents, that few if any of
the jobs created from supplies to the quarry and that only 8% of the
induced jobs (jobs created from the extra household incomes brought in
from the quarry) would be in Harris.
He agreed under cross-examination that the bulk of the benefits would
go to Stornoway.
Redland Aggregates Ltd have always expressed their preference to
employ Harris people wherever possible. Their witnesses at the inquiry
have also said that other industries -- eg fishing, fish farming,
tourism, and weaving -- will not suffer as a result of the quarry.
This was not the opinion of the Western Isles Fishermen's Association
who gave evidence to the inquiry last week, nor was it the opinion of
the fishermen who gave evidence. David Morrison and Donald Morrison from
Scalpay, and Roddy Morrison, from Stockinish, employ 16 fishermen among
them and the Scalpay skippers made it clear that their evidence had the
unanimous support of a meeting of Scalpay fishermen.
Previously, Donald Norman Maclean from Leverburgh had spoken against
the proposal on behalf of 19 fishermen from the Leverburgh area.
Opposition has also come from Berneray fishermen.
Also expressing concern at last week's session in Leverburgh was Murdo
Mackinnon from Stockinish, speaking on behalf of fish farm workers, of
whom there are 82 living and working in Harris. (This figure does not
include the expected creation of 20 new jobs in the industry reported in
last week's issue.) The interesting thing about fish farmers is that
they tend to be young -- average age is 30.
Tourism has tended to be devalued at the inquiry as a part-time
seasonal occupation, but B&amp;B has provided very valuable additional
income to many households in Harris over the years. Again the company
say that their development would have no impact on tourism, but the
feedback which tourist operators have had is that it will discourage
some tourists from returning.
Another concern raised at the inquiry was that the quarry development
would discourage other developments. For example Scotia Pharmaceuticals
are interested in setting up a plant in South Harris, but it would be
incompatible with the quarry.
All these facts have to be balanced before arriving at a conclusion
about employment benefits.

YOUR Parliamentary Correspondent's report of a debate relative to a
Labour amendment to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill seeking to
define the limits within which children can be struck states that Jim
Wallace (Lib Dem) said it was ''unacceptable'' that implements should be
used to hit children, and that this view was shared by both Labour and
SNP members as well as also being the position of the Scottish Law
Commission (May 2).
In short, our august Members of Parliament are hellbent on destroying
discipline in our homes in the same way as they have already done in our
schools.
When the Labour members of the Education Committee of Strathclyde
Regional Council, led by Dr Malcolm Green, banned corporal punishment in
schools they banished discipline from our schools and created a
lawlessness on our streets.
Until such time as the good burghers of Lochgelly return to their
traditional employment, and until such time as the none too gentle slap
of leather upon palm once more resounds along the corridors of our
schools, acceptable levels of good behaviour will remain but a fond
chimera.
Despite what many people think, and what politicians and
self-appointed professional educationists and assorted bleeding-heart
do-gooders earnestly want us to believe, the European Court has never
outlawed corporal punishment. It ruled on the specific and peculiar
circumstances of one case and made it clear that precedent was not being
set.

I AM proud to say that I have on several occasions been told by
fly-posters to do unmentionable things to myself. On one occasion I
managed something approaching a conversation with one of them. When I
pointed out that fly-posting was illegal he seemed to agree with me.
I then asked him why he was doing it and got the totally honest reply,
''If I don't put them up, I don't get paid.'' I then asked him, ''Paid
by whom?'' and was to told to remove myself.
This is the key question that the police should be asking so that
those truly responsible for the unsightly mess created by widespread
fly-posting can be prosecuted.

THE depressing experience of fighting against relegation is something
which has never been experienced by the young breed who follow the
fortunes of Aberdeen and Dundee United, clubs who meet at Pittodrie
tomorrow in what is arguably the most vital match between the clubs.
However, it is certainly not unique to those who were around when the
premier division was formed.
In fact, it is just 19 years ago that the New Firm, as they were later
labelled, managed to cling onto their premier status only on goal
difference, and two men who can remember the harrowing run-in to season
1975-76 are St Johnstone manager Paul Sturrock and Doug Rougvie, the
Huntly defender.
They were involved in that struggle and both can hardly believe their
old clubs are in the same kind of trouble.
Sturrock spent his playing career with Dundee United, winning a league
championship and League Cup medals, but he recalls the season the
Tannadice side almost went down.
''I played for most of that season, but for the last 10 games or so,
Jim McLean dropped the young lads to make way for the more experienced
players in a bid to keep us up.
''We stayed up on the last day of the season, so I suppose it
worked.''
Sturrock, who suffered the heartache of being relegated with St
Johnstone last season, sees tomorrow's Pittodrie clash, which is a
sell-out, too close to call.
''There is no doubt this match will be a dour, tight struggle,'' he
said. ''It won't be pretty, because there is too much at stake. Both
sets of fans won't care how they win, just as long as they've got the
points at the end of the day.
''If I were a betting man, I would stick my money on a draw, because
it is going to be so tight.''
Sturrock admits he has been as surprised as anyone by the New Firm's
fall from grace, and he pinpointed a lack of experience in the drop zone
as the reason why United and Aberdeen are struggling.
''Once things started to go wrong with both clubs, they really didn't
have players who had been in that position,'' he said. ''Being at the
bottom is not a time to have young, inexperienced players in the team,
but there appears to be not many options for United at the moment.''
Rougvie reckons Aberdeen will be under more pressure tomorrow than his
side were when they captured the European Cup-winners' Cup.
The big fellow knows the strain the present Dons side are under for
this match, for he played in a similar survival battle against Hibs at
the end of the 1975-76 season -- and won to keep the club in the premier
division.
Rougvie, now 39, and a stalwart in Huntly's title-winning side this
season, said: ''The similarities between then and now are amazing. Ally
MacLeod, the manager then, never mentioned relegation, but every player
knew what was at stake.
''It was scary. You kept trying to put the issue to the back of your
mind without any success. It was worse than any cup final I have known,
including Gothenburg. At least if you are beaten in a final, you know
you have achieved a measure of success to get there.
''If you go down there is only failure and that is a terrible
prospect. We didn't want to be the first players to get the club
relegated, and I am certain the present lot will not want to live with
that stigma.
''It was not pretty and it wasn't football. But we eventually ran out
convincing 3-0 winners over Hibs.
''Aberdeen have not won two games back-to-back all season which is
another pressure. But this is something you must deal with and they can
use this as a spur to get the result needed.
''I'll be there to cheer them on and do my bit to help them stay up.
It would be a disaster not only for the club but Scottish football if
they are demoted.''

MILES Maclagan will meet Ross Matheson for the first time on a
Scottish court at Craiglockhart today.
Scotland's top two players won through their second-round matches at
the LTA Spring Satellite tournament and now face each other for a place
in the last four.
Maclagan beat German Arnd Caspari 6-1, 6-4, while Matheson, seeded
No.3 and 15 places higher than his compatriot on the world rankings,
defeated Swiss-born Londoner Christian Wall 5-7, 6-3, 6-2.
They have met three times before -- twice in Turkey and once in
England -- and Maclagan leads 2-1.
''He's playing well, so it should be interesting,'' said Matheson, who
struggled in the first set against Wall, who had come through the
qualifying rounds.
There was a shock for top-seed Brent Larkham -- the Australian going
out to English qualifier Luke Milligan 6-3, 6-1.

POLOC and Ferguslie were well there for much of last season's title
race. And after last weekends results, the indications are that they
again will be leading contenders.
Tomorrow, they meet at Shawholm, marking a Union homecoming for
Scotland spinner Keith Sheridan. Last winter he spent his time -- and
what he earned -- in New Zealand, playing for the Stratford club. And it
is an experience he is keen to replay.
''It was a great place to play,'' said Sheridan, ''and I would
recommend the it and the cricket to anyone.'' He took 32 wickets and
nearly 500 runs and has been offered another contract Down Under.
This summer, Sheridan -- part-time groundsman at Poloc -- is only
interested in helping the club advance on last year's efforts. ''We were
always in the hunt in the league until the last months or so, and we
reached the Scottish Cup final only to lose to Forfarshire.
''I don't see any reason why we shouldn't go as far if not further. If
anything, what changes there have been will have bettered the team.''
Ronnie McGregor will take wickets, while the arrival of Aussie Ian
Holten, who played for the Melbourne club, will help in the batting and
bowling front. And, of course, few can match the run-making capacity of
Sajid Ali.
However, Poloc will have a game on their hands against Ferguslie, who
will give as good as they get on Saturday.
Clydesdale meet Drumpellier, Uddingston play Greenock, while things
can only get better for Ayr. who face West of Scotland.
Kelburne and Kilmarnock propped up the table last season, and they
will give further indicators as to whether or not that will be the case
again at Whitehaugh.

THE big guns of British middle-distance running, their sights set on
$52,000 in prize money, have had to take second place to the Duke of
Northumberland's grouse chicks.
Thirty leading athletes -- 15 men, 15 women -- contesting The
Northumberland Castles Challenge, have been forced to amend the planned
route of one of six races on successive days because of the potential
harm it may do to the duke's shooting rights.
Before Commonwealth internationalist Chris Robison won the second race
of the series, a 5000m at Hexham last night, the competitors learned
that Sunday's hill race, on the ducal estate at Rothbury, has been
rerouted to steer clear of the breeding birds.
Robison broke clear, winning in 14min.14sec, out-sprinting 3-53 miler
Adrian Passey. Robison's Spango Valley clubmate, Tom Murray, was tenth
in 14-28. Scottish cross-country champion Keith Anderson, winner of the
opening race, on sand, retained the overall lead, eight seconds clear of
Robison. Heather Heasman (Kent) won the women's race in 16-14.
The event, whose six races, all on different surfaces, add up to the
marathon distance, is being filmed by Channel 4. Presumably the nesting
grouse will not take exception to the chatter of the helicopter which is
following the odyssey.

Navacerrada, Spain,
THE fitness of Scotland lock Damian Cronin was still being monitored
yesterday as the Scottish side prepare for the pre-World Cup warm-up
match with Spain in Madrid tomorrow.
Cronin, who has not played since damaging an arm against France in
February, is suffering from what has been diagnosed as a strained left
hamstring, and he is still receiving treatment at the Scottish camp in
the Sierra Madrid.
The injury takes on special significance because, before the World Cup
squad departed for Spain, manager Duncan Paterson said that every member
of the World Cup party would have to play on the warm-up tour to be sure
of their place in South Africa.
''Damian has been out walking and jogging and he could not have done
that if the hamstring had been torn,'' said Paterson, ''and we are still
hopeful that he will play on Saturday.''
The injury is, apparently, a legacy of the gruelling mountain run
which half a dozen of those not involved in Tuesday's game against
Madrid took part in on the morning of the game.
So far as Cronin's participation in the World Cup is concerned the
management remain optimistic that he will play on Saturday and prove
that he has recovered from the surgery required to repair his damaged
arm.
''He has not played since February so we are in a bit of a dilemma,''
said Paterson. ''It is not just the hamstring that is the problem. We
want to see how his arm is as well.
''We want to see him play but we have to be sensible. We will not be
taking guys to South Africa about whom there is an extreme doubt, but if
Damian does not play on Saturday then there are other ways of proving
his fitness, but I would like to see him playing.
''Of course there is a cut-of point, as things stand today, I am
hopeful that he will play on Saturday,'' said Paterson.

Special Scottish Professional Championship at Dalmahoy yesterday after a
one-under-par 71 placed him alongside Stuart Syme of Glenrothes Driving
Range, David Herd of Alloa, and Machrihanish's Ken Campbell.
In perfect conditions across the 6677-yard East Course, only these
four broke par. With seven players tieing on 75, Neil McGill was the
last of 32 qualifiers to move on to the final stage which starts on May
18 at the same venue.
He parred the third extra hole to win a seven-way play-off. One
notable absentee will be former Northern Open winner Colin Brooks, of
Braid Hills, who slumped to a six-over-par 78. Leading scores:
71 -- S Strachan (Bathgate), S Syme (Glenrothes DR), D Herd (Alloa), K
Campbell (Machrihanish).
72 -- I Seath (Liberton), S Craig (Dunfermline), S Kerr (Renfrew), A
McCloskey (Airdrie), S Dunsmore (Falkirk Tryst), P Jamieson (Dunblane),
S Stevenson (Turnberry), B Marchbank (Auchterarder), R Collinson

THE pride of Scotland's women's team has certainly been dented by
events of the past week at Poznan, Poland, in the European under-21
championship qualifying tournament. But that could change this weekend.
The senior side is in Brussels for a two-match Test series against
Belgium which should produce two Scottish victories which will help
erase some of the disappointment of the past few days.
The state of women's hockey, however, is reflected by the fact that
senior coach Neil Menzies now has six players aged 30 or over in his
squad.
This unwelcome statistic leaves Scotland with possibly the oldest
squad at the forthcoming European Nations Cup in Amsterdam.
Though the feature of the present Scottish side is on age, it is
encouraging that some young players like 22-year-olds Susan Gilmour and
Rhona Simpson, who have won places along with Helen Walker, who is 12
months their senior.
The fact that goalkeeper Tracey Robb, at 24 and the possessor of 39
caps, is actually the fourth youngest member of the 16-strong squad will
hopefully spur some officials into a positive response.
In the women's junior championship, Scotland will be playing off for
places five to eight in the course of today and tomorrow.
The men, however, are on course for a top-three finish at Genoa in
Italy. Their failure to secure a place in the final is also a source of
disappointment but the fact that nine of their original training squad
were unavailable for the event will help alleviate some of their pain.
Today's fixtures:
WOMEN: Semi-finals -- Holland v Czech Republic, Ireland v Ukraine.
Places 5/8 -- Poland v Finland, Italy v Scotland.
MEN: Switzerland v Gibraltar, Scotland v Portugal, Italy v England.

WORLD champion Stephen Hendry has compiled his second maximum break
inside a week -- and against the same opponent, Jimmy White.
Hendry's second maximum in seven days came against White during an
exhibition match at the Barbican Centre, York, last night.
The world No.1, who won the world title for a fourth successive year
on Sunday, also completed a perfect run against White in the second
session of their semi-final to pick up #147,000 at Sheffield last
Thursday.
* TONY Drago delighted his home fans by beating veteran compatriot
Paul Mifsud 4-3 last night to qualify for the semi-finals of the #15,000
Cisk Gold Malta Masters.
Drago meets Liverpool's Rod Lawler, the world No.43, who beat
17-year-old Welsh rookie Matthew Stevens 4-2 to progress. The other semi
features a first clash between Derby's David Roe and teenage Scot John
Higgins.
The semi-finals, over nine frames, take place tomorrow. The winner of
Sunday's 11-frame final will collect #4000 and the runner-up #2300.
* SNOOKER chiefs yesterday unveiled plans for a #400,000 World Cup
team event to be staged in Thailand in December 1996. More than 40
countries are expected to compete in the tournament, with the winning
side collecting more than #100,000 in prize money.
There will be three players in each team, decided by the official
rankings for the 1996-97 season.
Eight countries -- from the Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania/America
zones -- will have to endure a series of regional qualifiers to join the
12 seeds in the final stages in Bangkok. The 20 finalists will then
compete in round-robin groups, with eight teams going forward to the
knock-out quarter-final stages.
Thailand has also secured another ranking event -- in addition to the
Kloster Thailand Open -- called the Thailand Classic. This will be held
from September 30 to October 7 this year.

EDINBURGH Inca Trust, a capital growth fund based on Latin American
equities, saw its value halved during the six months to March 31 as
share prices tumbled throughout the region in response to the Mexican
peso crisis.
Edinburgh Fund Managers said the net asset value of its trust's shares
fell 49.1% to 28.78p from 56.55p after panic selling hit the Mexican
peso in December, sending shock waves as far south as Argentina.
Administrative expenses of #303,000 during the six-month period wiped
out the trust's gross income of #267,000 and the managers warned that
''investors may not recover the amount of their original investment.''
Edinburgh Fund Managers put a brave face on the nosedive by noting
that it was in line with a 49.5% fall in the International Finance
Corporation's Latin American Investibles Index over the same period.
The firm, which has #3100m of assets under management, said the
outlook for Latin American stock markets was one of ''tempered
optimism.''
But it noted that stringent economic stabilisation measures in Mexico,
being implemented with the help of a massive US aid package, are likely
to plunge the country into recession, with GDP declining 3% this year.
The fund managers also expressed concern about developments elsewhere
in Latin America.
They noted rising imports and a growing current account deficit in
Brazil and said Argentina's stock market had proved ''exceedingly
volatile''.

WILL Carling may face disciplinary action from the Rugby Football
Union following the England captain's comment that the sport in this
country is run by ''57 old farts.''
Carling, speaking alongside team-mate Rob Andrew on Channel 4's ''Fair
Game'' programme last night, criticised the way the sport is organised
in England and Twickenham's reluctance to break with amateur traditions.
He believes the game is becoming professionalised, yet slams the RFU
for denying players any benefit from the vast amount of money now
entering the amateur code.
RFU secretary Dudley Wood said: ''It does not tell us much about the
committee, but does tell us something about Will Carling.''
There is a committee meeting of the RFU a week today and Wood hinted
that Carling might have talked himself into trouble.

BRITISH Polythene Industries yesterday announced the #1.24m cash
acquisition of a Shropshire-based company which makes bags for poultry
and potato crisps -- its fourth purchase in eight weeks.
The Greenock-based group is also assuming borrowings of #295,795. BPI
plans to grow its new company, Flexoset, within its retail division.
Tim Crow, who held the entire share capital of Flexoset, will remain
with the company, and the 53-employee firm will continue to operate from
its existing location in Telford.
Flexoset, which makes printed polythene, polypropylene and laminated
film products for the food industry, fits well with the current
activities of BPI's retail division.
BPI's customers already include Sainsbury, Tesco, Asda, Safeway and
Marks &amp; Spencer. It supplies them either directly, with products such as
carrier bags, or indirectly, by making wrappings for the likes of frozen
vegetable packers.
In the year to November 30, Flexoset made sales of #4.16m and pre-tax
profits of #172,685. Net assets were #487,181.
BPI, by far the biggest manufacturer of polythene products in the UK,
announced a 25% increase in 1994 profits to #19.2m in March.
Those who believed the absence of takeover announcements between last
August and February meant BPI had run out of ideas in relation to its
long-standing growth-through-acquisition strategy have certainly been
proved wrong in the last eight weeks.
Last month, it announced the #1.1m cash acquisition of Norwich-based
Polycon Packaging (East Anglia).
In March, it announced it was paying #IR900,000 for the business and
some of the trading assets of Irish company Globophan Industries.
Earlier the same week, it announced a #2m investment in the recycling
of waste polythene from farms, purchasing a factory in Dumfries from
Swiss confectionery giant Nestle.
BPI shares yesterday put on 1p to 551p.

Ross Finlay tests the reflexes of an imposing saloon
THE first thing I did when I took over the Vauxhall Omega was to
detach the centre rear head restraint and stow it in the boot. This item
may have its uses on the rare occasions when there are three people in
the back seat, but otherwise it restricts rearward vision to an alarming
extent. And if I had been the owner of the car, I would have thrown away
the twin-lens driver's door mirror and replaced it with a plain-glass
passenger's-side mirror from a left-hand drive Opel version. After all
that, the Omega would have been ready to go.
It was always a puzzle, in the 1980s, why Vauxhall introduced two
separate big-car model lines in the Senator and the Carlton, the
latter's image -- if hardly sales -- boosted by the arrival of the
377bhp Lotus Carlton with twin turbochargers, six-speed box and almost
180mph test track top speed. In this much more rationalisation-conscious
decade, the Omega takes over the executive-class saloon and estate car
role.
It is an imposing car on the road, with the same bodyshell used for
four different engine options and a multiplicity of trim and equipment
levels. Saloon prices go all the way from #16,495 for the entry-level
two-litre to #27,995 for the top-ranked three-litre V6 Elite. The car I
used for 1000 miles and more was a middle of the range 2.5-litre V6 at
#19,545.
One thing the Omega provides in abundance is space, both for
passengers and for luggage. The rear compartment is generous in
headroom, legroom and width. On long runs I liked the driving position,
although I accept that Vauxhall's habit in airbag-equipped cars of
offering seat height adjustment rather than steering wheel adjustment is
not really good enough.
The test car was a little weary, perhaps having been hammered by too
many journalists already. On-paper performance is fine, with a 0-60mph
time of 8.5 seconds and a test track maximum just short of 140mph, but
this particular car did not seem all that eager in the middle ranges. On
the other hand, allowed to rev higher it began to motor much more
purposefully, with that fruitier engine note typical of a V6 on song.
Fuel consumption figures should be around 40mpg at 56mph, 32 at 75 and
24mpg around town.
Even the GLS has a good level of equipment, and all Omegas come with
impressive anti-theft systems. The test car's were a little too
enthusiastic, because there were several occasions when I needed three
or four attempts to bypass the engine immobiliser, and even more when
the car remained obstinately silent as I tried desperately to leave the
embarrassing surroundings of a car wash. Working properly, Vauxhall's
deadlocks and immobilisers are regarded as some of the most effective in
the industry.
This is a fine motorway mile-eater, and in some big Vauxhalls of the
fairly recent past that would have been regarded as quite sufficient of
a design goal. However, one of the most appealing features of the Omega
is that the engineers have given it unexpectedly sporting reflexes on
winding roads.
It is a substantial car which is set up to achieve remarkably good
point to point averages on country roads, with accurate turn-in, an ease
of putting its power down, decently controlled body lean, and a high
standard of ride. As with all properly balanced big saloons, it soon
seems, when pushed along smartly, to be a smaller car than it actually
is.
The main source of this excellent on-road ''feel'' is a suspension
design which in its details and mounting arrangements carries on where
the final 24-valve Carltons and Senators left off. Another carefully
thought-out feature is a kind of traction control system for
slippery-surface starts which works by automatically cutting the fuel
flow when the wheels are about to spin. All this is reassuring evidence
that, as began to happen in the 1980s, the engineers' as well as
marketing men's input to Vauxhall design remains significant.

UNDERVALUED Assets Trust, which has made something of a nonsense of
the efficient market hypothesis in its first year, yesterday declared
itself the best-performing UK capital growth investment trust.
Since its launch last spring, the #53m fund's managers have
hand-picked less than 40 companies.
They believe these companies' share prices do not fully reflect the
value of the underlying assets or the potential for cash generation.
In the period from incorporation on March 17 last year to end-March
this year, Undervalued Assets achieved a 3.6% increase in net asset
value to 99.53p (ex-dividend), an impressive result considering its
benchmark All-Share index fell 1.2%.
Undervalued Assets, which is managed by Edinburgh-based Scottish Value
Management, declared itself the best performer in its sector.
It will make a single payout of 1.75p, in line with its policy of
achieving a yield between 50% and 75% of that on the All-Share index.
Colin McLean, managing director of Scottish Value Management, said
yesterday: ''Increasingly, the idea that the market is efficient is
being discredited. We added to our holding last week in Cairn Energy at
74p. People were paying 86p in the market yesterday.''
Undervalued Assets has benefited since March 31 from the rally in the
London market. Its shares, at 104[1/2]p, are trading around current
pre-dividend net asset value, which is a healthy state of affairs.
The fund, almost exclusively invested in the UK, has a bias towards
the financial, industrial and service sectors. Companies are selected on
the grounds that they demonstrate strong competitive advantages or have
undervalued strategic assets.
Glasgow-based ports operator Clydeport, which makes up 4.8% of the
portfolio, is a close second to leasing company Baltic in terms of the
size of Undervalued Assets' holding.
As well as being invested in relatively small Scottish companies, such
as Coatbridge-based Magnum Power and Edinburgh-based oil and gas company
Cairn Energy, FTSE-100 stocks such as British Steel, Barclays, Royal
Bank of Scotland and Reuters also feature in Undervalued Assets'
portfolio.
Trust chairman Professor John Kay believes the portfolio has further
potential.
* ANOTHER debutant of last year, Saracen Value Trust yesterday
reported a 9.1% decline in net asset value to 87.77p in the 13 months to
end-March.
However, it outperformed its benchmark FTSE Small Cap index (excluding
investment trusts), which lost 15.5% during the period.
The #32m UK smaller companies fund, managed in Glasgow by SFM
Investment Management, announced a final dividend of 0.6p, taking the
total payout to 1.2p.
Trust chairman Antony Dick said, while it was disappointing to
announce a reduction in net asset value, the current portfolio meant the
fund was well placed to benefit from stronger markets.

ANDY Little, the manager of the Scotland squad which will take part in
the two-day Melun Euro Sevens event which begins this evening, has
descrbed this weekend's tournament as the ''start of Scotland's 1997
World Cup preparations.''
''If we want to be on the world stage in sevens in two years' time
then that implies preparations,'' said Little who will manage an
experienced set of sevens players several of whom were involved at some
point in the last world cup staged at Murrayfield in 1993.
The Scots who are coached by Andrew Ker, the former Scotland and Kelso
stand-off, face a hard opening match tonight against Wales who have
included two caps -- Matthew Back of Bridgend and Neil Boobyear of
Llanelli -- in their squad. Also listed in the Wales squad are A caps
Chris Wyatt of Neath and Jonathan James of Llanelli.
Scotland then play Italy and finish the first session of the two-day
tournament against the Melun select seven which is expected to consist
of Australian and New Zealand players. The other pool will contain
France, Ireland, England, and the Netherlands. Scotland sevens squad:
F Henderson (Watsonians), M Moncrieff (Gala), M McKenzie (Stirling
County), C Little (GHK), G Farquharson (Gala), N Crooks (Gala), R
Kirkpatrick (Jed-forest), G Mackay (Stirling County), A Roxburgh
(Kelso), N Penny (Stewart's-Melville FP).

VETERAN hill farmer David Ker, president of the Scottish Land
Use/Association yesterday attacked the 'constant interference' farmers
were facing from do-gooders with little knowledge of the countryside.
Mr Ker, who farms at Sanquhar in Dumfriesshire told an SLUA conference
in Aberdeen that in his experience birds of prey and other predators
were multiplying every year while the likes of curlews, grouse, larks
and mosscreepers were becoming fewer and fewer.
''Last year I only heard one cuckoo once,'' he said. ''I have humane
and legal cages for hooded crows and these are regularly opened and
vandalised -- letting the call birds out to pick the eyes of lambing
ewes.
''My shepherd came in the other day with a very long face. One of his
favourite ewes had been on her back prior to lambing and the hooded
crows had ripped her open and eaten the unborn lamb. That is the sort of
thing that happens, and yet the 'do-gooders' are protecting the birds
that do that. If I am not very careful I could be fined #2000 for
killing them. I think that is very unfair.''
Mr Ker suggested that the whole agricultural industry should combine
to combat the effects of the strong anti-farming lobby. Someone like
David Attenburgh, he said, should be asked to make a stirring film
showing the horrors of nature with which farmers had to contend.
Yesterday's conference was called to study ways of widening the
economic base of the countryside and while defending the need for
government grants Mr Ker proposed one possible change. The Hill Ewe
Subsidy should be paid in line with labour units, he suggested -- with a
maximum of 1000 sheep per shepherd.
''I know of many farms, formerly properly shepherded with, say, three
or more shepherds but now the sheep sometimes see someone on a land
vehicle now and again. Worse still is the farm with no one at all and a
visit by a 'gang' three or four times a year. This is ranching at its
worst and downright cruelty. The owners if these sheep receive the same
subsidy per head as those of us who try to farm properly with fair
attention to stockmanship. This is another case of de-population of the
hills.
The need for a better presentation of the farmers' and landowners'
case was endorsed by Mr Andrew Dingwall-Fordyce, vice convener of the
Scottish Landowners' Federation. Instead of a film, however, he called
for a long-term', integrated campaign by people who lived and worked in
the countryside. We have a lot to show and we do a very good job as
custodians of the countryside,' he said.

NEAL Briggs was the surprise first-round leader of the Italian Open
after a seven-under-par 65 yesterday in Milan.
The Wilmslow-based player leads Spaniard Jose Rivero, who won a Nissan
Maxima car for a hole-in-one at the 155-yard seventeenth, by one shot
and Irishman Ronan Rafferty and London-based Yorkshireman Malcolm
Mackenzie by two.
''I had a putting lesson from John Hawksworth, my partner in the Pairs
tournament in Paris last week,'' said Briggs.
''He kept whinging at me for moving my head when I putted so I
concentrated on keeping it still and it worked.''
Briggs, who had six birdies and an eagle 3 -- at the 479-yard
eighteenth -- on his card, has played nine tournaments and missed four
cuts so the round was his most encouraging start of the season.
Rivero was two under with two holes to play, then holed in one with a
No.7 iron at the seventeenth and had an eagle 3 at the last to go to six
under.
Rafferty, who is playing in this event in preference to the Irish PGA
championship in Belfast this week, had the most consistent round of the
day, 13 pars, five birdies and not a single bogey.
Mackenzie looked like challenging for the lead when he went to five
under with four to play, but he bogeyed the seventeenth before getting a
birdie at the last.
Scots Stephen McAllister and Andrew Coltart both shot 68s.
Sam Torrance, only seconds away from withdrawing from the tournament,
took a gamble to shoot a three-under-par 69. Torrance, who had declared
himself fit and well on the eve of the tournament, woke up yesterday
with a strained tendon at the top of his left leg.
''I might have done it in practice,'' said the Scot. ''Or maybe it was
the long walk back from the restaurant last night. All I know is that it
hurt when I got up this morning.
''I went for treatment, had a few shots on the practice ground, and it
was only seconds before I was due off that I decided to play. But I'm
glad now I made the effort.''
Sweden's Gabriel Hjertstedt, who was taken to hospital on Wednesday
with suspected food poisening, was fit yesterday and went round in
two-under-par 70. Leading first-round scores (British or Irish unless
stated):
65 -- N Briggs.
66 -- J Rivero (Spain), M Reale (Italy).
67 -- R Rafferty, M Mackenzie.
68 -- R Willison, S Dodd, E Canonica (Italy), S Cage, S McAllister, C
Rocca (Italy), A Coltart, J Sandelin (Sweden).
69 -- M Roberts, V Fernandez (Argentina), S Tinning (Denmark), C
Cevaer (France), G Emerson, S Torrance, P Broadhurst.
70 -- J Arruti (Spain), M James, C Mason, T Johnstone (Zimbabwe), G
Levenson (S Africa), T Price (Australia), P Quirici (Switzerland), C
Suneson, R Boxall, M Pinero (Spain), W Riley (Australia).
Other scores included: 72 -- A Hunter, R Drummond. 75 -- B Marchbank.
76 -- C Ronald. 80 -- D Robertson.
* FORMER Walker Cup golfer Charlie Green and Oxfordshire member Alan
Holmes both carded one-over-par 72s over the New Course on the final day
of the Royal and Ancient's Spring Medal meeting. They will play off
today. Leading scores:
72 -- A W J Holmes, C W Green.
73 -- P R Hare.
75 -- A D McLeod, I Campbell-Gray, P Dawson, K W Mackintosh.
* RESULTS of the Renfrewshire Ladies Foursomes at Whitecraigs:

* HOLDERS Callander set up a repeat of last year's Stirlingshire Team
championship final against Stirling at Grangemouth last night when they
trounced Bonnybridge six up to move into the semi-finals. Other
quarter-final results:
Stirling beat Glenbervie 7 up, Manuel beat Polmont 3 up, Falkirk Tryst

THE 153rd Ayr Show concluded yesterday after two days of warm sunshine
which saw huge crowds pack the racecourse and fill the car parks close
to capacity.
The mood was definitely upbeat with the grass growing and crops
looking well. However, farms were warned that they face an unpleasant
shock in the price of many inputs as the pound continues to depreciate
against other European currencies.
While the major trade stands reported an excellent level of inquiry,
it was left to Douglas Hamilton, joint managing director of Hamiltons of
Larkhall, one of the leading machinery dealers in West Central Scotland,
to lay out the facts.
''We have had a good start to our year but prices are definitely set
to rise with 75% of our product range being imported from Denmark,
Norway, Germany and France. We are looking at increases of between 7%
and 15% on new orders,'' he said.
Mr Hamilton added that tractor sales have been good but he said that
farmers needed some patience when ordering. ''Availability is the
problem. Around four weeks is normal and if a customer wants a
particular specification then it can be up to four months. However, the
second-hand market is good and tractors are holding their value.''
Materials handling equipment is selling well but sales of slurry
handling gear are slower as a result of the complete removal of all
grant aid.
Another unpleasant shock is the steep rise in the price of plastic for
covering round bales. Mr Hamilton said: ''We are still selling a lot of
balers but a roll of plastic has gone up from around #40 to #50 and with
each roll only doing 20 bales that works out at an extra 40p per bale.''
The focus in the judging rings was firmly on the various inter-breed
contests. The beef team award went to the Charolais trio ahead of the
Aberdeen-Angus team with the Charolais cow, Celeste, from Gelston Castle
Farms, Castle Douglas, judged the supreme individual beef animal ahead
of the Simmental cow from Hugh Wallace &amp; William Wales, Redding Farm,
Galston.
In the dairy ring, the four-year-old Holstein cow, Whitborne Counselor
Ghost, from Jim Hodge, Lemington, Eyemouth, Berwickshire, reigned
supreme over his father's Ayrshire champion. When it came down to the
choice of the champion of champions, the Holstein cow just had the edge
on the Charolais.
In the sheep rings the native breeds scored a notable triumph in the
inter-breed title with a home-bred Border Leicester ewe hogg from John
Forsyth, Glenside, Maybole, getting the nod over the Muiresk-bred
Suffolk shearling ram from David &amp; John Steel, West End, East Kilbride.
In the Clydesdale horse section, the championship went to David
Greenhill, Leuchars Lodge, Leuchars, Fife, with a yearling filly.

HOLDER John Daly birdied his final five holes to vault within two
strokes of leaders Jim Gallagher and Bill Porter during the opening
round at the $1.3m BellSouth Atlanta Classic yesterday. He changed his
putting grip after 13 holes, and sank three 25-footers over the next
five holes for a five-under-par 67 at Atlanta Country Club.
''I wasn't making any putts so I went from the overlap to interlocking
grip,'' said Daly who reckoned his previous best run of birdies was
three.
Daly's wild round included one eagle, seven birdies, two bogeys and a
double-bogey.
The more consistent Gallagher compiled eight birdies and one bogey for
a score later matched by first-year US Tour member Porter.
About 40 players failed to complete the round yesterday due to a
nearly three-hour rain delay. Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
65 -- Jim Gallagher, Bill Porter.
66 -- Tom Kite.
67 -- Bob Estes, John Daly, Mark Calcavecchia, Stephen Keppler, Davis
Love.
European scores: 69 -- David Feherty (N Ireland). 76 -- Jesper
Parnevik (Sweden).

THE saving grace last year for struggling betting-to-pubs group Brent
Walker, which has debts of #1400m and is being kept afloat by the banks,
was the William Hill betting chain.
Despite flat turnover it helped the company to more than halve losses
from #319.1m to #142.7m at the pre-tax level. Ahead of exceptional items
and before interest charges, operating profits rose from #53.7m to
#66.1m.
Losses on the sale of casinos and hotels, together with write-offs on
public houses, again hurt the group whose turnover remained virtually
unchanged at #1690m.
Interest charges of #188.3m resulted in a deficit of #915.2m in
shareholders' funds compared with #863.3m last time.
''Despite the resolution of significant financial and legal issues
there are still problems to resolve and the group remains in a difficult
financial position, as is evident from the accounts,'' said chief
executive John Leach.
Brent Walker said it had not been able to negotiate the sale of the
famous Elstree film studios due to a dispute with the local council. The
main remaining property assets are at Brighton Marina and in Cardiff.
In the William Hill betting chain operating profits gained #10m to
#57.5m last year. ''William Hill's performance during the year was
exceptionally good despite turnover remaining flat and a trend of lower
turnover has been experienced in the current year,'' said the company.
It is not yet able to calculate with any degree of certainty the full
effects of the National Lottery on the business. The later is increasing
the range of games offered and many more sales outlets are to be added
in the coming months.
However, Mr Leach said: ''It must be an encouraging sign that we are
seeing a degree of deregulation of the betting industry which will allow
us to give a wider range of services to our customers and substantial
effort is being made to market these opportunities.''
The company, which was founded by George Walker, is still in dispute
with Grand Metropolitan over the price it paid for William Hill and is
seeking #200m from GrandMet in compensation.

LONG-established Glasgow printing company Bell &amp; Bain has been taken
over by the Gibraltar-based Inishtech Group in a #3m deal, writes IAN
McCONNELL.
Inishtech is paying #3m in cash and loan notes for 90.7% of Bell &amp;
Bain, which had net assets of #1.83m at March 31.
The consideration is net of cash balances in Bell &amp; Bain of #1.34m.
Bell &amp; Bain, a specialist printer of scientific, medical, technical
and educational journals and books, services publishing markets,
principally in the United Kingdom.
The acquisition, made through Inishtech's Droyhurst Holdings
subsidiary, will broaden the product range which Inishtech's printing
division can offer to UK customers.
Alfred Downie, managing director of Bell &amp; Bain, and his senior
management team will remain with the company in their present
capacities.
Droyhurst has the option to acquire the remaining 9.3% of Bell &amp; Bain
for #431,000 in cash during the two-year period from next February.
Inishtech also has operations in the Republic of Ireland and England.
Bell &amp; Bain made pre-tax profits of #852,000 in the year to
end-December.

Blimey. How do we dealthis? Another festival opened last night, the
Academy Now! Festival, in which advanced students at the RSAMD -- all
technical brilliance, performing muscle, and theatrical cheek --
launched a two-day, three-concert showcase of contemporary music.
That's not the problem. The problem is that in the opening concert
alone there were 10 musical works, three films, and four world
premieres. Get my point? It would take a few columns just to get the
chapter and verse over. And a couple more for a few performances that
were so dazzling that they should be written up long and large.
The shape of the evening was as follows: there were three core works.
Janet Beat's Joie de Vivre (a premiere) for four guitars and percussion
-- strangely arid and largely inexpressive -- belied its title. Gordon
MacPherson's string sextet, Prosen, was a craggy, heterophonic piece of
Highlandry, earthily effective. And Berio's classic thesaurus of vocal
virtuosity, A-Ronne, which received a performance of stupendous hilarity
and panache from the octet of singers.
Laced through the evening were atmospheric, sensitive performances by
two pianists of Berio's four impressionistic Klavierstucke. And then
there were the films. Three short silents were drawn from the Scottish
Film Archive. Three of the RSAMD's proliferating band of composition
students were set the task of providing new music for the movies.
All the compositions were effective: Edward Rushton's a pulsing piece
of minimalism, and Joe Evans's a study in mostalgia and wit. But in
Matthew Roddie's rambunctious, riotous pastiche of martial music,
delivered with Ivesian elan, we saw one of tomorrow's real stars: a
young lad with staggering technique, consummate style, and an awesome
inspiration. Watch out for him. Peter Inness and Richard Jeffcoat
conducted.

MICK Martin's play, On A Stone Bridge, receiving a well-deserved
second airing in Ben Francombe's pacy but poignant production, first hit
Glasgow's stages last January as part of the Ramshorn New Playwrights
Initiative. Francombe, the driving force behind the playwright festival,
picked a winner in developing this powerful script and furnishing it
with a production of such focused energy.
The subject matter is scarcely original, racism set amidst the urban
deprivation and no-hope culture of contemporary England. But Martin
avoids the mundanity and cliched naturalism of so many
Thatcher's/Major's Britain dole-queue dramas. His acutely, and at times
wickedly observed, portrait of life in a small northern English town is
painted in language at once poetic and earthily ironic; affectionate and
condemning; political, but without polemic.
A Friday night of beer, Bacardi, short skirts, and sun-bed tans
triggered instant recognition of negotiating the weekend streets of
Huddersfield, Halifax . . . or Hamilton. Balancing the bizarre and
off-beat, with the everyday, he conjures a world that is uniquely
Yorkshire, but universally identifiable.
The romance between two opposing cultures; Pank, a soft-hearted
skinhead, and Asia, the Pakistani shopkeeper's daughter, which forms the
core of the piece, again is hardly a new idea.
Movingly, and sensitively played by Nik Wardzynski and Sharon
Shrubsall, their relationship takes on the epic quality of a fable.
Together with John Comerford, the third and equally strong member of the
cast, they switch cleanly between characters, in and out of a running
commentary of the narrative. In a set-less and prop-less, tight but
vigorous physical performance, their age-old story is recounted;
observed and left ultimately unresolved.

THERE was cheering news yesterday for shareholders attending the
annual general meetings of engineering groups Glynwed and T&amp;N, the
latest in a string of buoyant meetings, boding well for much of
manufacturing industry this year.
Both companies reported a good start to the year although the shares
reacted differently with Glynwed up 8p to 344p, while T&amp;N slipped 2p to
162p.
Glynwed chairman Gareth Davies told the meeting that at the end of the
first quarter all the group businesses were well ahead of the same
period a year earlier, with the plastics and steels operations and the
metal services distribution business achieving particularly strong
performances.
''These results underline our confidence that, barring a reversal of
the current economic recovery in the UK, Glynwed is on course for
another significant increase in earnings,'' said Mr Davies.
Colin Hope, chairman of T&amp;N, also reported that the year had started
on a particularly good note with both sales and profits well ahead of
last year.
He said: ''While this trend is reflected throughout our worldwide
operations, it is particularly pleasing to note that at the end of March
exports from the UK were 22% up on last year.''
Touching on the vexed question of US asbestos litigation and liability
which has plagued the company for many years, the chairman said that
there had been no further adverse developments. He added: ''Indeed, in
co-operation with the Center for Claims Resolution, we re-evaluated all
oustanding claims at the end of March and the result was in line with
the evaluation on which the 1994 accounts were based.''
He concluded: ''The future prospects on trading are encouraging and
current customer demand remains high. Nevertheless, we continue to plan
so that any modest reduction later in the year will have only very
limited consequence for the operating results.''

Robyn Hitchcock is back -- and going it alone, reports David Belcher.
ROBYN Hitchcock's first performance in Scotland, almost two decades
ago when he was fronting the Soft Boys, inspired an unexpected form of
approbation from the patrons of Paisley's Bungalow Bar.
''I remember travelling up from London in a state of terror, alarmed
by having read stories in Sounds about mass fights in every venue;
savagings, dismembered limbs,'' says Hitchcock, due back in Scotland
next Tuesday evening, on Mayfest duty aboard the Renfrew Ferry. ''In
fact, our audience that night were a most peculiar crew who were all
tripping on mushrooms.
''You see, the Soft Boys had this reputation as a druggy, post-punk
acid band, but none of us ever performed under the influence of anything
stronger than Guinness. So, while our audience in Paisley were deranged,
they weren't hostile . . . actually, one of them kept phoning me up at
home for nice chats for some time afterwards. They piled all the tables
up and then danced on top of them. It was very interesting for us to
watch from the stage.''
Critical reactions to Hitchcock's work have been similarly amiable but
oblique. He has crafted 13 albums in the past 15 years, eight solo LPs
and five as leader of the Egyptians, and nearly every attempt at
categorising him has resulted in verdicts which sound like accusations
of wilful obscurity.
''Capable of baffling the uninitiated and delighting the converted,''
wrote one critic. ''Endearingly eccentric,'' said another, adding that
Hitchcock ''evokes the same benign insanity which marked John Lennon's
most whimsical moments.'' One other name has been repeatedly, and
somewhat unhelpfully, linked to Hitchcock -- that of the patron saint of
fey, wayward lost genii: Syd Barrett.
''I suppose it's more accurate than comparing me to Sam Cooke,'' sighs
Hitchcock, with dry resignation. ''Syd was obviously an enormous
influence, and he continues to show in my work; and my first solo album,
Black Snake Diamond Role, reeks of Syd. But I plead that I did it in
good faith.
''As for calling me inaccessible, or a cult figure, the creator of a
music which is only for the select few . . . it's like accusing a bottle
of milk of being full of white liquid. I'm accessible to anyone who
bothers, who makes the effort; and all tastes are acquired.''
Prominent among the fans Hitchcock has gained in the more recent past
have been REM. Indeed, Peter Buck's guitar is discernible on You And
Oblivion -- an album of hitherto-unreleased Hitchcockiana freshly issued
this year by the Sequel label, along with Hitchcock's entire solo
back-catalogue.
Such a major reissue programme would seem to be in direct
contradiction of Hitchcock's minority cult status. It transpires that a
passable number of Americans have grown very fond of him in the past 10
years, to the extent that he is a regular transatlantic commuter.
''We always wondered where the last Soft Boys album and my first solo
one went, because we could never find copies of them in the UK, and it
seems that they ended up at a record distributor in Georgia. Of course,
Peter Buck was working in a record shop in Athens, so that was how he
heard me. So while I've been pretty invisible in Britain, I went to
America in 1985 and found a seam that could be mined.
''I'm just back from a tour of the more real bits of America. Vermont,
Dallas, Cleveland. The Egyptians having burnt themselves out, I was
accompanied over there by a violinist, Deni Bonet, but in Glasgow it
will just be me.''
Hopefully this will not preclude Hitchcock from performing a one-man
verison of The Yip Song: a spiralling, headlong epic featuring walls of
guitars and addressing the saintly, life-giving powers of Vera Lynn.
''Cleanse us with your healing grin now, Vera Lynn.'' Timeous, what with
all this VE-Day stuff. The song appeared on Hitchcock's most recent
album, the wondrous Respect, in 1993. Released in the US by A&amp;M, the LP
was cruelly spurned by the label's UK arm.
Hitchcock is right now between record deals, although a new one is
imminent. He's nothing if not a realist, Robyn Hitchcock. While
repeating his disavowal of an appearance on Top Of The Pops, he is aware
that teeny-bop idolisation has passed him by. (''I have children who are
almost as old as me . . . my step-son actually works in the House of
Commons, fortunately for Labour.'')
He knows who he is and why he's never been flavour of the month with
the British rock press. ''Journalistic self-hatred. When the Soft Boys
began, most of the music papers were run by middle-class kids who wished
they weren't.
''In consequence, they like a bit of rough. Something American and
exotic, or working-class and well-'ard. Or working-class and quoting
Oscar Wilde. Certainly not middle-class wise guys like them, which I
palpably was and am.
''And there's also the fact that rock is based on the herd instinct.
You go against its trampling hooves at your peril.''
Fear not, Sir Robyn: we will be forming ourselves into a free-thinking
Hitchcock-flock on Tuesday night and stampeding towards the ferry.

SCOTLAND is to gain the headquarters for a major new producer of
electrical power. It sounds good, but is it? The Government is
determined to privatise nuclear power and to merge the highly successful
Scottish Nuclear with the larger English company, Nuclear Electric. The
two operating companies will be based in Gloucester and East Kilbride
and the HQ will be an imposing brass plate somewhere in Scotland. Mr
Lang is upbeat, but then Mr Lang is professionally upbeat; he has to be.
He is confident that jobs will be maintained in Scotland. Indeed, some
administrative jobs may move from England. Yes, yes, but where is this
getting us? The answer is, precisely nowhere. Leaving aside the question
of privatisation of the nuclear industry, fraught as it is, and will
remain, with unanswered questions over the future cost of
decomissioning, the Government's plans for the nuclear industry are not
just a folly, but the repeat of a folly. Thus, the first act in
deconstructing this hastily assembled edifice of naked political
opportunism is to examine its content of common sense.
Frankly, there is none. Competition is a good thing as long as it is
genuine competition. When the Government sold off the non-nuclear
electricity generating industry four years ago it committed the cardinal
error of lumping the units into only two companies. Competition is,
therefore, limited and the industry's potential for innovation and
diversification into the many highways and byways of electrical supply,
with all that could have meant for our exports around the world, has
been stifled and stultified. This was foolishness; it is a function of
foolishness that it rarely leads to lessons learned. So it is with this
Government which is intent on repeating the mistake of four years ago by
forcing into an uneasy and unwanted partnership two producers with
distinctly different approaches to their task. Scottish Nuclear is a
successful company which differs from its bigger English counterpart in
a number of significant areas. These include the method of both
generating nuclear electricity and of disposing of waste. This fact is
recognised in the wider industry, and if the two providers had been kept
separate the innovation, creativity, and service which would have sprung
from the resulting competition would have benefited both as well as
their customers. In the important values just mentioned we believe,
without bias, that Scottish Nuclear had a better record than Nuclear
Electric and as an independent and distinct operator would have
maintained that qualitative lead. This chance has now been lost. If the
economic and organisational arguments for the merger are as stupid as we
have suggested, where lies the rationale?
It is political, of course, but it is the politics of the lost. The
Government needs revenue to allow tax cuts before the next General
Election. There are precious few ways left for this Government to raise
revenue and privatising the nuclear industry is just about the last
throw left for such desperate gamblers. It may even work for them in
terms of the politics of southern England but nobody in the Tory Party
should be under any illusion that it will convince Scotland. The company
headquarters proposed for Scotland is the merest cipher, indeed it is an
insult to presume that the august figures of the Scottish business
community, or the electorate of Scotland, will be fooled by such tawdry
beads. This trick has been tried before, notably by Guinness. It was
generally despised then and it will be comprehensively despised now. The
Scottish economy and Scottish business needs control over the productive
capacity of the nation and the services which feed it. Time and again we
have seen these disappear for no good reason. We have lost the core of
Rosyth, British Steel, Rolls-Royce, and a number of other enterprises
for a mixture of political and economic reasons which hold in common the
notion that in a time of tough decisions it is the English interest
which much take precedence over the Scottish dimension. To complain is
not nationalism, and it is most certainly not political nationalism. It
is simply a reflection of a need and a desire to fight our own corner.
We are willing and able to do this on an even basis; we might even
manage it on the present uneven basis; what we will not do is accept a
story which tells us a brass plate is business power and that the loss
of yet another distinctive company is good news.

Anne Johnstone discovers how racists and other extremists are
spreading their messages of hate worldwide by hitching a lift on the
information superhighway
THE Internet offers us undreamed-of freedom to cruise the information
highways of the world, but does it also offer a dagger? Users of the
Internet, and the clutch of magazines which have sprung up to serve
them, like to emphasise the exhilarating, liberating sensation of 30
million people surfing around a mind-boggling, world-spanning maze of
information and opinion on anything you care to think of.
Douglas Rushkoff, the young Californian author of Cyberia -- life in
the trenches of Hyperspace, typifies this enthusiam. ''What we've got on
the Internet is such a tremendous empowerment experience. We've got the
whole world in our hands, a privilege that was formerly reserved for God
Himself . . .'' he told Net magazine.
But with freedom comes danger. Like every piece of new technology
since the wheel, the Internet is proving a double-edged sword. Last
August a young computer hacker from Fife was charged with using it to
distribute information illegally.
If the case comes to court, it will be the first of its kind in the
UK, for although police forces are aware that extremist groups are using
computer systems to collect and disseminate information, they say they
lack the know-how and resources to bring them to book.
Last year saw concern about paedophiles using the Internet to
distribute information about, and images of, child pornography. Now the
worry is about the Internet giving extremist groups a unique opportunity
to spread racist and anti-Semitic propaganda. Mike Whine, of the Board
of Deputies of British Jews, says: ''As far back as the mid-80s the
far-right in America, Scandinavia and Germany marked out the Internet as
an area to concentrate on. The extreme right in Britain is far less
sophisticated but, of course, everyone here can receive this stuff.''
What stuff?
A self-confessed duffer with all new technology, I took my first
faltering steps on the superhighway yesterday, to see how easy it would
be to stumble across the sort of material I wouldn't like my
nine-year-old daughter to read. A boy of the same age recently
constructed a napalm bomb, using a recipe he had culled from the
Internet.
I was looking for information pages in the service known as the World
Wide Web (WWW) and also for ''unmoderated'' newsgroups (these are for
particular interest groups and in some instances nothing is considered
too outspoken). The first thing to discover is that many of the
reputable access providers, including my first choice (CompuServe),
screen out this sort of material. (A useful lesson for anxious parents.)
For unrestricted access I needed to reconnect, this time using Demon.
By this route, I was soon perusing the WWW where, among files on
everything from the weather to training your dog, I came across Spunk
Press, an index to anarchist resources around the Web.
It seems paradoxical that anarchists are so well organised. The
material was mostly pretty tame, and included schoolboy pranks like
sugaring police car fuel tanks. The right-wing equivalent, a directory
called The Right Side of the Web was similarly bland; rude jokes about
Bill Clinton and the like.
But the newsgroups were an eye-opener. Under headings like
''alt.revisionism'', ''alt.skinheads'' and ''alt.politics whitepower'',
there was an undiluted diatribe of racism, much of it apparently timed
to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of Hitler's
death camps.
One typical comment in the skinhead file read: ''I don't believe
Hitler gassed six megakikes. And even if he did, so what?'' There was
also information about forthcoming neo-Nazi events in Germany, some of
it in code.
Supporters of the Internet, such as Angus Kennedy, a reviewer for the
magazine Internet, argue that such comments are acceptable because the
net is open to all, and anyone is free to come back and contradict it.
Elsewhere in the Internet, there is certainly plenty of anti-racist and
anti-Nazi material.
But many of the ''bulletin boards'' -- electronic message boards
accessible via the Internet -- don't welcome outsiders. For example, one
entitled Cyberspace Minutemen bills itself as ''a meeting place for
those courageous men and women fighting to preserve their Northern
European culture.''
Kennedy also argues that anyone worried about the Internet should have
similar concerns about other new technology developments, such as
satellite television, which ignore national boundaries in the same way.
But Mike Whine, for Britain's Jewish community, says the Internet is
unique in its capacity to create worldwide networks of extremist groups,
allowing them to pool information and recruit new members.
American right-wing militias, including the one implicated in the
Oklahoma bombing, are regulars on the Internet. The net is also used to
publish ''hate'' articles, aimed at prominent Jews. In one case, says
Whine, right-wingers hacked into an American Jewish professor's E Mail
box and used it as a base to send out anti-Semitic messages to other
Jews.
Could and should the Internet be regulated? Kennedy says such a move
would be futile and wrong. Regulation is up to users, he says. ''If you
walk into a red light district, you're going to see prostitutes.''
Dr Brian Loader, senior lecturer at the School of Human Studies at
Teesside University, organiser of the recent conference there on the
governance of cyberspace, sees a more complex moral dilemma here. ''It's
all very well saying the Internet is liberating us and it's up to us to
choose what we want to see there, but sooner or later any public space
falls under some kind of control. Most people think the Internet should
be regulated in some way. The question is how?''
He believes it might prove impossible to gag because of its constantly
evolving form. ''You could cut a connection in one place and someone
could build it somewhere else.''
Internet fans like Rushkoff dismiss the fuss as hype from a printed
media with a lot to lose ''because people are getting their information
from each other''. Loader is also wary about over reaction to the
negative side of the Internet, but believes the eventual solution may be
the creation of some kind of global authority to police it.
National governments, meanwhile, are forced back on legislation which
largely pre-dates the net. Michael Whine says technically, several
pieces of legislation could be used to control abuse of the Internet in
Britain (for example, the Malicious Communications Act of 1988, which
makes it an offence to convey ''a message which is indecent or grossly
offensive''). However, he admits that because it is so easy to disguise
the source of messages, prosecutions are extremely difficult.
Labour's heritage spokesman, Chris Smith, says Whine's findings show
the need for international agreements to ban groups preaching violence
through the net: ''Current laws were framed in the age of print. We need
a new framework for the age of electronic communication.''

JACQUES Santer, president of the European Commission, is some puppet.
He was propelled into his elevated job because he could be trusted to
oppose ''big government'' (John Major's phrase) and, more immediately,
because Major could not stomach the thought of the federalist Jean-Luc
Dehaene of Belgium succeeding Jacques Delors. John Major thought Santer
would be less of a ''philosopher king'' (Douglas Hurd's phrase) than
Delors and so he has proved. The only problem is that Santer has begun
to relish being his own man. His speech in London last night merely
confirms that he is part of the European mainstream and that gestures
like the British veto of Mr Dehaene are whistling in the wind.
His speech was typically European, praising, correctly, the input of
successive British Governments to the construction of the new Europe.
Britain supported the internal market, championed subsidiarity, shouted
loudest for spending discipline and against fraud, embraced deregulation
and privatisation, and most recently supported enlargement so that the
former communist countries could enjoy the underpinning of democracy
that the Greeks, Spanish, and Portuguese have enjoyed since their
emergence from totalitarianism. In other words he showed, if it really
needed showing, that Britain is a prime mover in the new Europe and has
been so since the British people voted convincingly to board ship more
than 20 years ago. The pity is that internal Conservative Party
divisions have recently discredited Britain's Europeanness and
encouraged a weak Government to flirt with nationalism as it seeks to
appease the Tory Europhobes enjoying their transient power and
celebrity.
Such appeasement won't work. British nationalism is mainly a southern
English phenomenon with no great support outside the Home Counties. To
be sure there are doubts about Europe and about Britain's sovereignty
but these are no more than the worries shared by the other 14 member
states of the EU as they prepare for next year's Maastricht review.
Santer took it upon himself to accentuate the positive which is why he
showed a fondness for quoting Winston Churchill (although he tactfully
ignored the Churchillian vision of a United States of Europe). He spoke
for most of Europe when he suggested obliquely that Britain should think
again about our Government's ridiculous negotiating stance (our words,
not his) on Maastricht 2 in which the Prime Minister has already made
clear he will immediately wield the national veto if the national veto
is threatened. More, Mr Santer believes a single European currency is
inevitable -- which it is -- and that Britain should be in at the start
of the monetary union process. He is correct there, too, because the
ground rules for a single currency would otherwise be set by others,
leaving the British to come late to the club where we must accept other
peoples' ground rules.
What the diplomatic Jacques Santer did not spell out is also
instructive. And that is the growing feeling around EU capitals that the
way to deal with British Conservative recalcitrance is simply to delay
signing Maastricht 2 until after the next British General Election. That
should focus Mr Major's mind.

Kathleen Rantell reports on a remarkably understated announcement
about the development of one of the best sites in Europe
YESTERDAY, when Glasgow Development Agency displayed the drawings and
a model of the winning design in their architectural competition for a
science centre at Pacific Quay -- part of the former Glasgow Garden
Festival site -- they provided the minimum of information about the
development. They did not even bother to quote the judges' report on the
chosen building, yet that stretch of waterfront is probably the best
undeveloped city-centre riverside site in Europe.
Congratulations to the winners, Building Design Partnership of
Glasgow, whose Sandy Fergusson gave a hint of the thinking behind his
firm's proposals.
But thumbs down to the GDA who did not mention the names of the three
runners-up let alone put their submissions on show, as is usual when the
winners of major competitions of this kind are announced. Well, here are
the names of the three other firms who made the short leet. They were
John Findlay of Edinburgh, Richard Horden of London, who designed the
proposed Millennium Tower, and Allan Murray of Edinburgh, who won the
competition for the Vision (science) Centre at Strathclyde University,
which has been displaced by the new riverside proposal.
When the GDA announced the winner of their Millennium Tower
competition just over two years ago they provided acres of background
information and filled the courtyard space of Princes Square with the
drawings of nearly 100 entrants along with the models of those on the
short leet. After a sojourn there the entire exhibition moved on for
display in London. In addition, notes on the work of all 353 competitors
were published.
That invitation to the public to discover the diverse possibilities
that can flow through the minds of architects concerned a #5m tower, at
1993 prices. The estimate for the proposed science centre is #25m, of
which this first-stage building is expected to cost #10m before fitting
out.
Three events divide the Millennium Tower and the science centre
competitions. Glasgow had the support of the GDA in its bid for the City
of Architecture and Design 1999 award and this was won largely on the
city's promise to involve its citizens in further development. The bid
outlined the proposed establishment of a special venue, the Lighthouse
in the Mackintosh tower on Mitchell Street, in order to widen interest
in architecture and design. You could call it a centre for visual
education where seeing possibilities will nurture understanding.
In addition, the Millennium Commission, from whom it is hoped funding
will be acquired for the science centre, has said repeatedly that in
making decisions on the disbursement of funds it wants to know what the
people want in addition to what organisations have in mind.
But over the past six months the GDA has faced verbal brickbats from
members of the public who wanted them to rethink their master plan for
the former festival site. A large number of eminent people preferred
Geoffrey Jarvis's concept for a Tivoli Gardens project to delight
Glaswegians and draw in tourists.
That proposal would have kept the adjacent docks as a maritime museum
instead of becoming a site for housing development. And a lot of
supporters for this alternative plan hoped for a compromise with the
GDA's propsals, integrating a science centre with the Tivoli Gardens
plan. But GDA appeared determined to kill any alternative to making the
science centre part of a business park. They discovered public
participation can be a nuisance.
Was this why they gave such meagre information yesterday about the
#10m building chosen?
No, says a spokesman. ''We wanted to announce the winning design and
designer, also to announce the GDA's second-round submission to the
Millennium Commission and to announce the setting up of a foundation for
the proposed science centre which will be headed by Professor John Ward,
chairman of the CBI in Scotland.
''Some people may have considered it would confuse the issue had we
published more about the building.
''We are going to put the winning proposals out to public display in
Princes Square on Tuesday for a fortnight and the exhibition will
include drawings from the three other practices who entered the second
stage of the competition.''
Later this display is to move to other venues in the city.
That will make some amends. But surely the building chosen for this
site was sufficiently important to warrant an announcement of its own.
Initially 12 firms were invited to submit proposals. All must have
invested thousands of pounds in their work and in the opinion of one
specialist unconnected with any of the practices involved, those chosen
to enter the second stage must have spent at least #16,000 on their
submission. In consideration of this wasted time and money, competition
entrants at this level deserve and expect their work to be seen if not
built.

UNFAIR ''small print'' in consumer contracts could be challenged by
the Consumers' Association and other independent watchdogs if the CA is
successful in a High Court challenge to the Government's interpretation
of a European Union directive.
Last week it won leave to apply for a judicial review of the
Department of Trade and Industry's decision to refuse consumer groups
the right to challenge unfair contract terms in the courts. The
Government has restricted that role to the Office of Fair Trading, one
of its own departments.
An EU directive on unfair terms, which comes into effect in July,
specifies that persons or organisations recognised in each country as
acting on behalf of consumers, should be allowed to mount a court
challenge to the wording of consumer contracts. This has been
interpreted in other countries as including independent consumers'
organisations, and the German equivalent of the CA has already notched
up about 100 challenges a year.
Small print plagues a wide range of contracts, from holidays, credit,
insurance, mobile phones, and even public transport -- to the extent of
robbing consumers of their basic rights, according to the CA's new
director, Sheila McKechnie.
An example is the double glazing firm whose contract does not allow
the practice, applicable under normal consumer law, of holding back some
of the payment until the work has been satisfactorily completed.
They say: ''If there is some minor defect in the work, the company
expects you to rely on its assurance that it will be rectified in
accordance with the terms of the guarantee. Your failure to pay the
balance would be a breach in the agreement.'' It means that if a window
leaks, you have to pay up and then persuade them to come back and fix
it.
The most blatant example is a clause in the brochure of a US cycling
company selling holidays through a UK agent, which disclaims all
responsibility for everything. Participants are expected to sign the
following statement: ''I . . . fully assume all risks of illness, injury
or death, and hereby release and discharge the company and its agents
and associates from all actions, claims or demands for damages resulting
from my participation in the trip.''
According to Rebecca Evans of the Consumers' Association's legal
department, such a clause would be legally unenforceable. As she points
out, though, the consumer has to know that to take any action.
The only way the association can pursue a company relying on unfair
small print at present, is to back individuals who have been affected to
take court action. It is expensive and, according to Ms Evans, doesn't
work because it does not necessarily mean the small print itself has to
be amended.
''We would not be taking court action as a first step, but when we had
an example of an unfair clause, we would write to the company and say we
wanted to discuss it in a reasonable way.
''If the judge gives us the right to challenge such contract terms, we
then have the possibility of taking them to court as a back-up. I am
sure the Office of Fair Trading will take the same approach, but there
are so many other things they are required to do, they may not make this
a priority,'' she added.
It could be another 18 months before the CA's case has a substantive
hearing -- and it is possible, since it involves European legislation,
that the court will refer it to the European Court.

DERRY-based theatre company Ridculusmus's adaptation and fusion of two
of Nikolai Gogol's stories has a great deal to commend it. With its
oft-times slapstick comedy and invariably childish verbal jokes, it is
accessible to even the most unsophisticated of theatre goers.
The two strands are cleverly interwoven. The play's starting point is
a freak show with two crowd-drawing headlining acts: a performing nose
(which is treated and feared in much the same way as a lion) and
Bashmachkin, a ghost with a predilection for swiping audience members'
outer garments.
From here, we are flashed back 30 years to when the ghost became a
ghost and the nose went on the run.
The first half of the play moves quickly, lurching from gag to gag.
The three actors whiz through enough personality changes to make even
the most confused of schizophrenics sympathetic. Characters transmogrify
into other characters in front of us, with only the change of a hat and
voice. David Woods stands out as the most multi-colourful-charactered
and energetic of the trio.
His first part, as Bashmachkin's landlady is a priceless comic
creation: one part Rigsby, one part Mony Python, one part Hilda Ogden.
Post-interval, events take a turn for the slow, and the serious, as
the morals -- the superficiality of friendships and vanity -- and
conclusions emerge.
The only quibble would be that the production could have done with a
bit of the chopping that Woods's over-enthusiastic barber was into.

PERTH'S most recently acquired venue, ideally intimate listening space
though it provides, is a little plusher than the usual setting for Steve
Young's songs. This is music best accompanied by a cold beer or three.
Young was already honing his art when many of today's new country
stars were in diapers -- and it shows. The voice is lived in. The songs
have been lived. Many of them were autobiographical, tracing his early
career as a left-wing folk singer in Montgomerie, Alabama (not his best
idea) through his metamorphosis into the self-confessed worst mail man
in Los Angeles.
When someone else had beaten him to the song that said what needed to
be said, he happily conceded his ground and let the words of John D
Loudermilk (a razor sharp Tobacco Road) or Warren Zevon (the grubby Echo
Park) talk for him.
As a guitarist he is more than able, conjuring up accompaniments
ranging from complex strumming to dextrous bluesy finger-picking and at
one point doing a more than fair impersonation of Fats Domino's piano
style.
Although his own attempt at a humorous song, White Trash, fell a bit
flat, Shopping For Dresses, the song he was handed on the recent Merle
Haggard tribute, Tulare Dust, proved that he can handle a delicate
mixture of humour and poignancy.
Midnight Rider, written while driving through Scotland and owing a
debt melodically to Wild Mountain Thyme, confirmed that he had been here
before, but performers of this character don't pass this way too often.
He's at King Tut's, Glasgow, tonight, and Roman Eagle Lodge, Edinburgh
tomorrow -- catch him if you can.

PEOPLE living in Edinburgh are to get their say over how local
services should be organised and delivered in an exercise designed to
strengthen local democracy, Labour leaders of the new city council
promised yesterday.
The large-scale consultation will include meetings with local people
and organisations and the use of market research to identify local
priorities.
Ways are also to be found for community organisations and other bodies
to have an input into the agenda of the new council's policy committee.
Only 45% of people in Edinburgh voted at the recent local elections,
Councillor Keith Geddes, the leader of the new City of Edinburgh Council
told yesterday's second meeting of the shadow authority.
This was disappointing given the impact that local government had on
everyday life, he said. He added: ''We need to encourage public
participation and strongly believe that people who use the services
should play an active part in their development.
''We are preparing a strategy to take us through the council's
formative years from 1996 until 1999 and it is essential that our
policies reflect the needs and priorities of local people.''
The Labour motion, which was agreed unanimously, also promises to keep
members of the public informed about the progress of the new council and
to extend the consultation process to include organisations in the
private and public sector important to Edinburgh's development.
Councillor Geddes also said it was a priority to forge close links
with neighbouring councils to ensure that strategic and specialist
services could continue to be provided on a cross-border basis.
The council approved unanimously the appointment of Mr Tom Aitchison
as its new chief executive. He is currently chief executive of Lothian
Regional Council.

The Herald's Great Spam Fritter Tasting, threw up some piquant
results, but first Anvar Khan explains the cut and thrust a great
wartime staple
AS BOB Finley of Dallas said at last year's SPAM Olympics in Austin,
Texas: ''It was the worst thing I ever put in my mouth. I may hurl any
minute.'' What Bob tasted was a Spamalamadingdong, a bite-size SPAM
sandwich covered in chocolate with whipped cream in the middle.
In Britain, Second World War veterans and war babies associate SPAM
with health and occasion, with the self-discipline of living by rations,
with winning the war in Europe. In America, SPAM is consumed at a rate
of 3.8 cans a second, the emblem of a greedy, consumer lifestyle.
Rampant SPAM eaters come together, by their own design, once a year, to
share their passion for the pink luncheon meat.
It is a testament to the success of SPAM as an icon of popular culture
that it can be so badly abused. At the busy, action-packed SPAM
jamborees, from Minnesota to Alaska, sporting events include a five-mile
hog jog and a SPAM etching contest; SPAM throwing and a SPAM Cram, in
which contestants guzzle an entire tin in seconds.
Here, SPAM is a form of personal expression. At Seattle's annual SPAM
Carving Festival, 150 contestants are given 15 minutes each to carve an
''interesting shape'' out of America's most celebrated snacking meat.
Winning entries have included a scale model of the ancient Druid site,
SPAM Henge, and country singer, Spammy Wynette.
''Contestants range from five to 60 years old, and they come from all
over the States,'' says Ruby Montana, the festival founder. ''Some of
them eat SPAM, but most of them prefer to carve it rather than consume
it. They consider it a bold and exciting new sculpture medium.'' It's
true. Last year a mouth-wateringly fuschia version of Nude Descending a
Staircase emerged as a clear winner.
Regardless of the various, tribal rituals of the SPAM cult, opening a
wee tin of SPAM for dinner, both in Britain and America, probably
signifies poverty rather than choice.
''Over 60 million people currently eat SPAM around the world,'' said a
spokeswoman for the Hormel Food Corporation in Texas, which launched
SPAM in 1937. They say that Hawaii presently eats more SPAM, with sales
of 4.3 million cans a year.
''There is a direct relationship between increased SPAM consumption
and widespread poverty,'' says David Heber, professor of medicine and
chief clinical nutritionist at UCLA. ''A slice of SPAM has twice the
calories, four times the fat and more than 18 times the salt content of
an equivalent portion of skinless chicken breast.''
In response to such criticism, last year Hormel introduced SPAM Lite,
with 25% less fat, 25% less salt and 20% fewer calories. Although it
proved successful with health-conscious consumers, the good
old-fashioned wartime variety remains America's favourite, with total
sales topping $2.8 billion.
In Britain too, SPAM is a high-profile meat, if only through
notoriety. Last year, VE Day SPAM Fritter Frying contests were
publically condemned by no less an authority than Denis Healey. It had
been naively suggested that SPAM, given its prominence in the British
public's diet during the war, could assume its rightful place in the VE
Day celebrations.
''Oh God,'' sighed David Mellor, on the ensuing fuss at the time.
''Listen, the SPAM fritters were suggested by the Royal Marines, not us.
The idea of street parties was created by the Sun, not us.''
However, the country's frontline of moral guardians were so offended
at the possibility of indiscriminate street SPAM fritter frying that the
yearly sighting of the perennial Dame Vera Lynn was even threatened. She
proclaimed that she would boycott the celebrations if the idea wasn't
dropped immediately.
SPAM sounds like a toddler's expletive. But the naming of the product
demanded no more imagination than the merging of Spiced and Ham. If
perhaps, it had a more sombre name, a more stout, solid British name
like Corned Beef or Steak and Kidney Pud, the fritter frying event may
not have sounded so annoyingly frivolous.
However, maybe Lord Healey had a point. Given the results of The
Herald's Great SPAM Fritter Frying Test, the former Labour Defence
Secretary could have been talking about the product itself when he
lampooned the VE Day suggestion as ''tasteless and disgusting''.
In recent years, it has become more difficult to obtain SPAM. ''We
bought SPAM in tins and sliced it down but we've stopped selling it
because people have stopped asking for it,'' said a spokeswoman for
butchers Henry Healey.
''Luncheon meat is a cheaper product. Spam is more expensive,''
expounds Grant James Rennie of Grant James Foods. ''My family have had
96 years of selling canned meat. The cheapest come from Denmark -- they
produce a lot of pigs -- and the cost of shipping meat over by sea is
less. All processed meats tend to be owned by the same firm. SPAM is a
trade name, but some people sell luncheon meat as Spam.''
* Anvar Khan is UK feature writer of the year.
THE RECIPE
By Chef Bill Taylor
Ingredients:
One tin of luncheon meat, sliced; 8oz flour; [1/2]-pint water; 1 egg;
salt; 1oz baking powder; 2 tblsp vinegar; a dash of yellow food
colouring.
Method:
Cover each slice of meat with mixture and deep fry.
Makes approximately 6-8 portions.
A bit of a battering as our panel puts fritters to the test
The judges who took part in The Herald's Great Spam Fritter Tasting,
in
no particular order of merit
or appearance, were, Jane Westmorland, Bob Sutter, Ron Anderson,
Morena Quinn and Grant James Rennie
Princes Pork Luncheon Meat
Marks out of 10: A collective 33 out of 50.
Price: 39p for 300g
Contents: Pork, Water, Wheat Starch, Salt, Sodium Caseinates, Egg
White Powder, Isolated Soya Protein, Stabiliser: Sodium Polyphosphates,
Spices, Antioxidant: Sodium L-Ascorbate, Preservative: Sodium Nitrate,
Colour: Erythrosine.
Claims: 80% meat.
Bob: A couple of mouthfuls and it gets OK.
Morena: I don't like it.
Grant: Bland.
Jane: The meat's soft.
Ron: I don't think there's any real taste, but the batter's terrific.
SPAM Chopped Pork and Ham
Marks out of 10: A collective 26 out of 50.
Price: #1.19 for 340g.
Contents: Pork, Salt, Sugar, Starch, Sodium Polyphosphate, Spices,
Preservative (Sodium Nitrate).
Claims: Made with prime cuts of quality pork; 90% pork.
Bob: The taste lingers a bit.
Morena: I can't taste it until I've eaten it.
Grant: It tastes fake. It's poor. Too pulpy and emulsified. The
Princes meat tastes better because it has more rubbish (added
preservatves) in it.
Jane: This is my least favourite. The Princes luncheon meat was much
better.
Ron: Very rubbery and greasy.
Springrose Pork Luncheon Meat
Marks out of 10: A collective 12[1/2] out of 50
Price: 40p per quarter loose.
Contents: Pork, water, starch, salt, casienate, soya protein, sodium
diphosphate, spices, antioxidant, sodium L-ascobate, preservative:
sodium nitrate, Colour: erythrosine.
Claims: Minimum 80% meat.
Bob: My wife makes me Spam fritters, but if she gave me this I'd tell
her to put it away.
Morena: I don't like this one either.
Grant: It's quite disgusting. It might suit as a cold meat. When
luncheon meat is heated up all the fat tends to run out.
Jane: This is more spicey, a stronger tasting meat.
Ron: Very greasy.
Lane's Danish Luncheon Meat
Marks out of 10: A collective 31 out of 50.
Price: 38p per quarter loose.
Contents: pork, water, starch, salt, caseinate, soya protein,
triphosphates, spices, antioxidant E301, preservative E250, Colour E127.
Claims: Minimum 80% pork.
Bob: This is not as heavy as the others. It's all right.
Morena: It has more taste.
Grant: A stronger flavour. The chopped pork comes to the fore.
Jane: I prefer the Springrose.
Ron: You're talking about a very educated palate here, and I think the
SPAM is way ahead of this luncheon meat.

EMERGENT native novelist A L Kennedy makes her playwrighting debut
tonight with The Audition at Paisley Arts Centre (8.0pm). Drawing on her
own evidently less-than-hilarious experiences as an aspiring actor, the
play plots the unhappy trajectory of a loser thesp as he spirals
downward into drink-fuelled self-disgust.
Another first public performance, of a new piece composed by Sir Peter
Maxwell Davies, will have gotten underway in the City Halls 30 minutes
earlier. Conducted by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies himself, the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra will be performing Carolissima Serenade. This was
recently commissioned by a noted Edinburgh patron of the arts, Jens
Hogel, as a birthday present for his wife, Carol. Its only other airing
was at Mrs Hogel's birthday party.
In addition, the SCO's closing concert of their winter season will
feature Sinfonietta Academica. This is a piece of music, and not -- as
the Mayfest brochure would have you believe -- a new ensemble.
While we're on the theme of Mayfest brochure errors, it should be
pointed out that there is no late-night comedy at the Tron tonight. The
Tron's next bout of mirth-making round midnight will be on Sunday when
Rhona Cameron drops by.
Tonight's late-night music at the Mayfest Club will be provided by
three local combos: Johnny Seven, Sandy Nelson and the Usual Suspects,
and Lorna Brooks and Her Band.
Another local combo, the Radio Sweethearts, will be providing tasty
country-rock licks and flavourings earlier in the evening, at 8.30, when
they support Nashville-domiciled singer-songwriter Steve Young. Turn up
at King Tut's in time for the Radio Sweethearts, though. They may not
hail from Nashville -- Bellshill and Kelvinbridge, actually -- but they
sure do their thing in a way that Hank Williams would approve.

THERE is a baker's dozen of dramas in Breadmakers, Clyde Unity's
splendid adaptation of Margaret Thompson Davis's best-selling novel. All
of them have a capital D and 13 is an unlucky number for the families
around which they revolve.
Murder, miscarriage and madness cover only the M's in this dark tale
of ordinary Govanites. If you're looking for a quaint tale of shortbread
and tin baths you've never read Thompson Davis; she only types on black
paper.
But the words give it a white light and there is always a coal fire
during the darkest night, which comes at the climax after Young
Catriona, who married an older baker yet loves his young employee,
retains her senses.
Women usually take a kicking, emotional or otherwise, before rising to
their feet in Davis's stories. In Breadmakers it's against the twin
forces of monstrous mothers and a baker whose damaged cold heart
replaces a soft centre.
Kevan MacKenzie as Melvin MacNair, the bullying baker is a chiller. He
makes that subtle switch from an oaf to an emotional ogre who mixes good
intentions with foul deeds.
Yet here the story is all and the company under John Binnie's
direction drive it along by turning a basic kitchen set into
paddle-steamer, furnace and gallows.
There are deaths and family destructions in this story which you would
read with your eyes shut, but on stage you wouldn't risk missing a
moment. For Breadmakers has the ''gotta'' -- you gotta know how it ends,
and it's well worth the wait.

IF it's true that in the sixties they invented sex, it's equally true
that in the eighties they invented illness.
That the diseases brought on by the onset of Aids are abhorrent,
debilitating and tragic should go without saying. But that isn't reason
in itself for believing the condition is any more special or important
or significant than any other. You'll hardly find victims of terminal
cancer, leukaemia or brain tumours claiming their life is a
laugh-a-minute either.
No, what singles out Aids -- at least in the West -- is its political
impact, the way it forces issues of sexual behaviour into the public
arena, challenging mainstream values, and redefining the acceptable
range of human relationships.
So the cynical side of me says that Elegies for Angels, Punks and
Raging Queens, a theatre-cum-cabaret equivalent of an Aids memorial
quilt, is self-regarding schmaltz. It's simply too easy to play on an
audience's emotions with tales of young lives lost nobly, spiritedly,
unwillingly or whatever. Yes of course it's sad, yes of course people
get angry and upset, but so what?
The rather less cynical side of me says that Luckenbooth Theatre
Company's production of Bill Russell's poetic and musical collage is
simply tremendous.
Performed on Kenny Miller's cabaret catwalk, bedecked with crepe paper
and candles, it feels at times like you're watching a roll call of the
next decade of Scottish acting talent.
The cast is massive and staggeringly good. The singers -- Joanna
Booth, David Arneil, Andrew Gillan, Linda Cameron and Marj Hogarth --
are supremely assured, effortlessly filling a big awkward space without
amplification, and the whole thing generates a feeling of love, humanity
and common cause that sends you out glowing. Politics some other time.

The term dancer does not begin to describe Hungary's amazing
performer, Yvette Boszic. Mary Brennan recalls her past performances and
looks forward to her Glasgow debut
ONCE upon an Edinburgh Fringe, I watched a pale, fragile creature
perform a fierce, fantastical rite of evolution and survival. Clad in an
amazing, sculptural costume that was full of hidden attributes, she
changed from brooding bird-thing to rutting animal, shifting sex and
status like some rapidly-adapting spiral of DNA.
The piece reeked with primitive instincts, it was sweaty with all
kinds of gut hungers. It left audiences reeling out into the lunchtime
sun unsure of what they'd seen, but knowing it was brilliant.
The slender wraith causing these shock-waves was Yvette Boszik. Born
in Hungary, she had trained originally as a classical ballerina. Indeed,
she was still dancing in productions of Sleeping Beauty to finance her
own creative projects. She was in Edinburgh because she'd come to the
attention of -- who else! -- Ricky Demarco.
Before there was time to spread the news about her and her
extraordinary work -- she had gone. Back to Hungary, back to another
stint on pointe, back to waiting and planning. Happily, Demarco kept
track of her movements. The following year she returned, bringing
something that looked like a glass coffin. Her watchful companion
explained: sealed inside, she would perform until the air ran out . . .
Again, audiences were taken unawares by the raw, graphic quality of
the work. Naked, but for a cache-sex, Boszik hunkered and squirmed in
her see-through box. No room to stretch full out, or even sit up
properly. No privacy. Only exposed solitude.
The air lasted almost an hour. During that time her actions conjured
images of tyranny, restriction, and the elemental need to keep alive,
functioning. Zoo captivity, political repression, ritual behaviour,
social conventions -- there were spasms of all these and more.
Word of mouth had scarcely spread about this startlingly original
talent, before -- shades of Cinderella -- she had, again, packed and
gone home.
The impact lingered, however. And when she came back -- again
programmed by Demarco -- there was an expectant rush to see what she was
up to now. The 1993 show was a version of Huis Clos. Two women, one man,
trapped together in the limbo of a brittle society ruled by affectation,
sham morality, and selfishness. It was a searingly bleak vision of
empty, posturing lives.
There was Boszik, juddering like a little clockwork doll, primping and
simpering in all her pretty finery -- before ripping it away, to stand
childlike in her skinny underwear, just so as to attract the man away
from her rival. Who, thwarted and rejected, promptly crammed
compensatory cakes into her unhappy face. It was an ugly, honest
statement about women as their own worst enemies.
This time, Boszik did not escape media attention. Theatre critics and
dance critics vied to review her, while The Independent's panel of
judges (myself among them) sent her to Hampstead, as the winner of their
Fringe Theatre Award. The story persists that Jenny Topper -- director
of Hampstead Theatre -- tentatively inquired if there was anything else
Boszik might bring, to make a double bill. She was frankly hoping for
something a little less intense . . .
Seemingly the reply was: ''Yes, there was something. A
version-in-progress of Kafka's The Castle.'' Sartre was deemed
sufficient for Hampstead's regular audiences.
Which brings us to The Countess -- much praised at last year's Fringe,
and now at Mayfest. Once more there are the key elements of restriction
and individual will, the images of female behaviour that defies dictated
convention, the scraping away of social niceties to reveal the
primitive, visceral sides to human nature, human sexuality.
As before, on stage, Boszik displays this marvellous, chameleon
charisma. She is a remarkable technician. One moment she is a sleepily
sensual women, nestling amid velvet cushions, the next she is a wilful
little girl ordering her maid to play games on her terms. Everything --
moods, thoughts, circumstances, and subtext -- comes to us through her
movements, through the tiniest gestures and details of her performance.
It can, in the afterglow of a striking performance, be all too easy to
describe an artist as ''unforgettable''. Then, years later, find the
programme and wonder why you've kept it. I've no idea where any of her
Fringe programmes are, I can't even recall the names of the individual
shows -- but Yvette Boszik's work sticks effortlessly in my mind, the
images as provocative as ever.
* RICHARD DEMARCO writes: I first saw Yvette Boszik in Communist
Hungary in 1989 at the Spring Festival in Budapest and was overwhelmed
by her. A young woman performed the most extraordianry piece of theatre
in which she enacted the birth of a primeval creature. She then
transformed herself from an insect to a bird to a human being.
I was the only British person there and when I talked to her
afterwards I discovered we had a shared enthusiasm for the work of
Jospeh Beuys and Tadeush Kantor. They had trained in classical ballet
and the Hungarian National Ballet but packed it in because she couldn't
stand it. It simply wasn't intelligent enough for her.
She was working with sculptor and philosopher Gyorgy Arvi, who had
directed the show The Originator and the Yesterday of Victory. I brought
her and her Theatre of Natural Disasters to my Festival Fringe venue in
Blackfriars Street in 1990 and she was an immediate success, returning
the following year with the same company to perform a show inside a
glass coffin 155cms by 85cms by 52 cms, a symbolic drama about the
limitations of and on the human body. It blew everybody's mind.
When we moved to Albany Street in 1993, I brought her to be the focus
of it and she formed her own dance company to perform the show Soiree,
based on Jean-Paul Sartre's Huis Clos, with dancer Ava Magyar and with
beautiful music by Jean-Paul Heritier. It too was showered with plaudits
and prizes and transferred to the Hampstead Theatre Club. She was also
appointed a visiting fellow at Kingston University, where I am Professor
of European Cultural Studies, and I have seen her mesmerise students at
a master class.
Still only 24 years old, or thereabouts, she is a one-off: a great
teacher, a great choreographer, and a playwright who does not need words
to deal with powerful themes to do with life, death, and regeneration.
Her message is up-beat despite the terror she can create and she is like
a hypnotist -- people cannot stop looking at her, not just because she's
beautiful, but because of her mastery.
She is one of the few artists who can combine the visual and
performing arts -- she is a living sculpture. Alongside Kantor, Theatre
Obala from Sarajevo, and Poland's Theatre Kana, she is my proudest
discovery.
Yvette Boszik makes her Glasgow debut with The Countess at The Tron
from Sunday, May 7, until Tuesday, May 9.

THE printed blurb informed that the Melos Ensemble Wien draws its
members from the younger generation among those rich resources of the
Vienna Philharmonic, Vienna Symphony, and Volksopera orchestras.
This certainly was a generally more youthful-looking band but they
played with a very mature sound, the silky string section coming
straight out of the Viennese mould.
Mozart, Schubert, and Johan Strauss the Second were the programme,
represented by ideal selections for this chamber-sized orchestra to show
its paces. Conductor Christian May gave Eight of Mozart's German Dances
a perky, foot-stomping outing, full of varied colourings, with a nicely
judged balance between strings and woodwind sections.
Schubert's Symphony No 5 should have been perfect for this ensemble
but while it was clearly articulated with clean changes of gear and
precise endings, this performance suffered from a touch too much forward
momentum.
After the interval the band returned to their opening form in a
selection of eight Straus polkas and waltzes. The strings sang clean and
sprightly with no descent into smaltz. From their smiling faces the
orchestra were clearly enjoying themselves as they tripped lightly
through a host of golden favourites.
Their enthusiasm, however, failed to transfer to the audience who sat
every so stiffly with not a head bobbing to the infectious rhythms,
hardly a finger tapping in tune. Applause was polite enough to gain an
encore after a sparkling Magic Bullets Polka, but with conductor
Christian May's rather formal hand on the event there was never any
danger of this audience taking to waltzing in the aisles.

THE CHIEF executive of the new all-purpose Highland Council will be
Arthur McCourt, presently assistant chief executive of Tayside Regional
Council.
Mr McCourt, 47, was selected by the full 72-member council in
Inverness yesterday, ahead of the only other candidate remaining, Mr
Geoff Bonner, chief executive of Stirling District Council.
As councillors met they were shocked to hear that Mr Douglas Sinclair,
chief executive of Central Regional Council, had withdrawn that morning.
Mr Sinclair was seen by many as favourite for the Highland job, having
worked in the Western Isles Council, then becoming chief executive of
Ross and Cromarty District Council before going to Central.
He had attended pre-meetings in Inverness on Wednesday and appeared
again yesterday morning, but when the council convened a letter from him
announcing his withdrawal was read out.
There was immediate speculation that Mr Sinclair, who would have had
to accept the Highland job if successful yesterday, was looking to the
chief executive post in Fife, or the secretary generalship of the
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.
A week ago there had been six candidates. Very quickly Mr Ian Smith
withdrew having landed the Dumfries and Galloway post, as did Mr John
Anderson having secured the chief executive's job in Glasgow.
At the beginning of the week Mr Alan Campbell, chief executive of
Grampian, was appointed to the top job in Aberdeenshire.
Having lost four candidates within a week the convener of the
Highland, Council Peter Peacock, yesterday reflected on the timetable
which dictated a rush between the new councils to get the best
candidates.
He said: ''This isn't really satisfactory, but I don't know what would
have been.''
Mr McCourt, whose salary will jump from #53,745 to #84,000, said that
he was delighted with his appointment. ''I believe it the most exciting
and challenging of jobs in local government in Scotland.''

Is it theatre? Is it puppetry? As ficionado MINTY DONALD reveals, the
Doo Cot company is both of these and more
THE title ODD -- If You Dare serves as much as a fittingly
uncompromising epithet for Manchester-based theatre company Doo Cot, as
it does for their new show, currently touring Britain. Doo Cot's
co-founders and directors, Nenagh Watson and Rachel Field, dare to be
different.
Their idiosyncratic and risk-taking approach to theatre defies easy
categorisation, and elicits vehement responses from both their fans and
their detractors. I should come clean -- I stand firmly in the former
camp. Since meeting them and seeing their work at the deliciously
different Festival of Live Art in Lancashire, I've been an unashamed
aficionado, happily traipsing around the countryside to catch their
performances.
Formerly describing themselves as ''theatre of objects and figures'',
they shift around the territory of live art, puppetry, and experimental
theatre, never quite happy to align themselves with one faction. This is
a tendency that can cause problems for promoters but which consistently
produces work of rare passion and magic, astonishing and delighting
audiences and critics alike, and winning them last year's prestigious
Barclay's New Stages Award.
Watson, who trained as a sculptor and puppeteer, and Field, whose
background is in fine art, a painter with several solo exhibitions to
her credit, met in 1986. Their personal relationship almost immediately
became a working partnership, and Doo Cot was born. Questioned about the
name, Watson confesses to a slight sense of embarrassment regarding its
origins.
While working in Glasgow during 1990, they were inspired by the pigeon
lofts which litter the city's urban landscape. Both the resemblance to
puppet booths and their appearance of being assembled from discarded
materials appealed to the fledgling company's vision.
Their theatre is firmly rooted in a contemporary urban environment,
drawing on stories and images from the area where they base themselves.
Whalley Range, Manchester's red-light district, the bed-sit land
conjured by Morrissey's angst-ridden anthems, provides a rich source of
material.
In last year's award-winning piece, they unfolded ''a stolen true
story'' of a gay man lovingly tending a menagerie in the city. The
peacock, jewel of his collection, gave the piece its title, and became
in Doo Cot's hands a moving symbol of gay male pride. Puppets were
fashioned from scrap objects; a vicious dog from sack cloth and rusted
tin; the magical peacock beginning life as an umbrella and shopping
basket. These performed alongside wood-carved figures based on
traditional Japanese Bunraku puppets, shadow images and projections.
ODD -- If You Dare promises to continue their unique brand of daring
and eccentric theatre. Mixing video imagery of Soho sleaze with Catholic
kitsch, junk puppets and finely carved fibreglass figures, music which
moves from Operatic Diva to Riot Girl, they tell a tale of loss, sex,
and death; two women's struggle for survival.
While Peacock dealt with gay male relationships and homophobia,
achieving -- astonishingly perhaps, since it took place between two
puppets -- the most moving love scene I have witnessed in the theatre,
ODD -- If You Dare again pulls no punches, with a powerful depiction of
rape. This puppetry is not kids' stuff.
Field and Watson are an openly lesbian couple who do not shy away from
confronting the issues and concerns which inform their lives. They
tackle frequently bleak and desolate subject matter without polemic, but
with humour and compassion. Joined, on this occasion, by Tania Peach, a
trainee puppeteer, singer Doreen Edwards, and long-term collaborator
musician Sylvia Hallett, Field and Watson's relationship remains
pivotal.
As a couple, their extraordinary physical presence on stage celebrates
and affirms the right to be ODD, and a sense of mutual trust and respect
pervades the work. Doo Cot make the bold claim that they will change
your definition of puppetry for ever. Love them or hate them, it's a
guarantee I'd be happy to endorse.
* ODD -- If You Dare is at Paisley Arts Centre on Saturday, May 6.

John MacCalman, Municipal Correspondent, reports that Glasgow district
councillors, absorbed in their own rivalries, took their eye off the
Strathclyde 'juggernaut'.
SHOCK waves are still reverberating around Glasgow's City Chambers
over the appointment of a senior Strathclyde Regional Council official
to Scotland's top local government post.
Mr John Anderson, 47, currently depute chief executive of Strathclyde
region, was selected as chief executive of the new Glasgow unitary
authority last week, with the selection panel split 5-4 between him and
Glasgow district's town clerk, Tom Monaghan, aged 48.
Many district officials are now wondering how many of them will be
casualties of the new order and morale is said to be at an all-time low.
But the decision also infuriated a significant number of current
district councillors who now have a sense of being run over by a
regional council juggernaut.
At the driving wheel is the unassuming, but eminently shrewd,
Strathclyde Labour leader, Councillor Robert Gould. He has adroitly
manoeuvred himself into the political leadership of the new ''shadow''
authority, and now has his ''own man'' as chief executive who can be
depended on to preserve, as far as possible, the regional ethos of
service delivery and corporate management.
Gould also looks well placed to crush, or at least neutralise, the
infamous factions which have developed over the years as the rivalry
between the current district council leader, Pat Lally, and his bitter
enemy and former leader, Jean McFadden, intensified.
Few would disagree that something has to be done about the factions,
given that they have brought the council into disrepute in recent years.
The deep and abiding hatred between them might even be considered to
rival the enmity between the Campbells and the Macdonalds. Gould has
already stated he will not tolerate factions or caucus meetings. His
strategy is to effect a scattering of the two clans, although he was
able to exploit their mutual antipathy in winning control of the new
authority.
Clan rivalry was very much in evidence during the selection of Labour
candidates for last month's single-tier elections when a variety of
''strokes'' were pulled to further factional interest. In one instance,
a community hall was flooded (the taps were turned on and left running)
in an attempt to prevent a selection meeting going ahead. Apparently one
of the clans was not quite prepared for battle that evening.
Then just days after Labour's triumph in the single-tier election, a
district councillor commented uncharitably on Lally: ''A body bag,
riddled with bullets in George Square, is too good for that man!''
Clearly Gould has a big job ahead of him to instil some unity of purpose
within the new Labour Group.
Perhaps the two clans were too busy watching each other to be fully
aware that the quiet-spoken, unassuming Gould was actually working a
number on both. One insider said: ''I think he is trying to break up
that whole sterile conflict. Most regional councillors are 100% behind
him in that.
''He has managed to treat with people on both sides of the tribal
divide, and that's healthy. Hopefully the majority from both sides will
realise that it is time for a fresh start and that seems to be what's
happening.''
Already new members of the ''shadow'' council have been given a tour
of Strathclyde House to see how it operates and what access they can
have to information about current regional services like education,
social work, and transportation which will become the responsibility of
the new unitary authority when it assumes full powers next April.
This has given rise to fears that Glasgow will effectively be run from
Strathclyde House, and there are indications that a significant number
of the new councillors are willing to base themselves at Strathclyde
House, at least for the ''shadow'' year. ''They were shown that there
are places in this world other than the stuffy old City Chambers and
more than one style of local government,'' said one regional councillor.
All this ignored the fact that there are more regional services than
district services -- in a proportion of two to one. There will be
something like twice as many ex-regional employees than former district
employees on the new single-tier authority. With the controversial
appointment of Anderson as chief executive, these basic facts of life
should become more widely appreciated.
Gould is now being urged to press ahead with setting up a committee
structure with appropriate conveners to consolidate his position and
thereby reduce the possibility of the clans uniting against him on some
sensitive issue. It's a high-wire act and he will require all his
political skills to maintain his balance. However, some of his regional
colleagues say they have never seen him evince such assertiveness and
sureness of touch.

<HEADLINE>High Court is asked to consider forensic advances. Killer 18 years ago moves for appeal</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>JAMES FREEMAN, HOME AFFAIRS REPORTER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>13</PAGE>

A THREE-JUDGE High Court bench will later this month decide whether to
allow an appeal to go ahead in the case of a Lanarkshire man sentenced
to life imprisonment for murder more than 18 years ago.
No appeal was lodged at the time despite what appears to have been
widespread dismay by everyone involved, including the trial judge, when
Andrew Smith was found guilty of murder by a jury in Glasgow.
Counsel's opinion now indicates that the legislation might allow an
appeal despite the time lapse. The improvements in the state of forensic
knowledge over the years might also be an important factor.
Smith punched a man in a Larkhall pub brawl, knocking him to the floor
of a toilet. The Crown alleged that the victim died as a result of a
kick to the side of the head, a claim based on the evidence given by
Scotland's pre-eminent forensic scientist of the day, the late Professor
Arthur Harland.
The defence contended that an injury caused by a fall had caused
death, but appeared to have been unable to shake the Crown evidence
which appeared to have been based on the direction of the skull
fracture.
Should an appeal be allowed, it will consist of a new analysis of the
forensic evidence by Derrick Pounder, professor of forensic medicine at
Dundee Royal Infirmary, who will contend that the fatal injury was
caused by a blow to the back of the head when the victim fell and that
there was nothing in the medical evidence to suggest a kick could have
been responsible.
He will base this argument on the pattern of injury to the brain. Had
this evidence been available at the time then the question of culpable
homicide would have almost certainly become of paramount importance.
There was no evidence in the original case to indicate that Smith kicked
the victim hard enough to cause a skull fracture.
Smith, who was then 18, has been in prison ever since -- a remarkable
sentence in view of the nature of the original offence which caused Lord
Avonside, the trial judge, to remark that while the only sentence he
could impose was life imprisonment, if Smith behaved himself then he
would not serve a long time. On average, the current custodial part of a
life sentence is about 12 years.
Smith, now in Noranside Prison, agrees he has had many opportunities
to return to society. People close to the case acknowledge that
practically every time he has been entrusted with freedom he has ''blown
it'' through alcohol abuse.
Even so there is measurable embarrassment among the authorities that a
man whose crime was clearly at the lower end of the scale should have
served longer than many notorious killers.
The Parole Board clearly recognised the nature of the case by
releasing Smith after six years, the shortest-ever custodial period for
a lifer in Scottish legal history. He was recalled by the Parole Board
after offending in 1985 only to be released again on life licence later
that year. But his freedom was terminated once again after 13 months in
November 1986.
Since that time Smith has repeatedly worked his way up in the prison
system to the point where freedom is once again a consideration. He has
told The Herald he has appeared before the Parole Board six times.
He also admitted to The Herald that his attitude over the years might
have been less than perfect.
''I have never been on a prison roof. I have never committed any
violent act in prison. But I have never willingly gone through the
hoops, complied with the potty training which is necessary,'' he said
yesterday from Noranside.
Both the Parole Board and the Scottish Prison Service refuse to
discuss individual cases, but an informed prison source said yesterday:
''He demonstrates time and again that his behaviour in prison is not a
problem. The problems seem to arise when he is away from the controlled
prison environment and he gets access to alcohol.''
Another person close to Smith says that he had suffered great problems
in coming to terms with the conviction, maintaining all along that it
was never his intention to kill and that the treatment of the drunken
victim by others following his assault could have contributed to the
death.
Miss Anika Jethwa, of Bruce Short, the Dundee solicitors representing
Smith, said yesterday: ''After we studied the evidence we were amazed
that Mr Smith had been convicted for murder in the first place and that
no appeal was lodged at that time.

Kirsty Scott reports how the war between a cheesemaker and health
officers is taking its toll.
THREE more letters dropped through the front door of Walston Braehead
Farm yesterday morning, one from a minister in Leighton Buzzard
enclosing #10, the others with neatly handwritten words of encouragement
from a Glasgow headmaster and an English business man.
While Prince Charles's private words of comfort to Humphrey Errington
last week were gratefully acknowledged, it is this flood of support from
the ordinary public which has taken his breath away.
''It's quite incredible,'' says Errington, dropping the three latest
epistles into a box on the sideboard in his farmhouse kitchen. ''Look at
these. There's about 270, and it's through donations like this that our
fighting fund is now at #15,000 or so.''
The approach by the Prince of Wales, who is patron of the Specialist
Cheese Makers Association, came at a food exhibition in Earl's Court
last week.
''I felt it was particularly important to be there at this time, to
show we were still going on,'' said Errington. ''People were coming up
to wish us well. A chef from one of the top London hotels put his arm
around me and he actually had tears in his eyes.
''Prince Charles was there and he apparently asked if he could meet me
and they brought him over. He repeated several times 'It must have been
awful for you, it must have been awful for you.' He said he had written
several letters on my behalf to support me and as he left he asked: 'Why
do you think the environmental health officers are taking this line?'.''
Errington has been asking himself the same question since his renowned
Lanark Blue cheese was first taken from a butcher's shop in Edinburgh in
early December and declared to be contaminated with listeria
monocytogenes, a potentially harmful strain of bacteria. Follow-up
checks on samples taken by Clydesdale District Council also yielded
positive results. Errington voluntarily recalled his cheese and sent off
samples to three independent laboratories which all cleared them.
There followed a well-documented process of claim and counter claim
and legal to-ing and fro-ing which resulted in a Mexican stand-off
between the Erringtons and Clydesdale District Council environmental
health officials at the farm on Wednesday.
The council had planned to seize the #27,000 worth of cheese in
question but were denied access. It was eventually agreed to leave the
cheese where it was and allow council officials access to it and to the
new batch of cheese, which is making its way to the shops. Yesterday
afternoon both sides were figuring out the next step in the protracted
legal fight.
If Errington had taken his father's advice he may never have found
himself in the current legal quagmire. His grandfather farmed in Mull
during the agricultural depression of the 1930s and it put his father
off the idea for life. ''He believed the last thing anyone should go
into is farming.''
Errington started his first upland hill farm in Beattock in 1981 and
then moved to Lanark where they first toyed with the idea of producing
an unpasteurised blue cheese from sheep's milk.
''We spent two years going to trade shows and visiting shops in London
and speaking to cheese wholesalers. It became clearer and clearer that a
blue cheese, particularly a sheep's blue cheese, would have a market,''
he said.
The family invested about #200,000 to set up the operation and
recruited seven staff, among them an expert cheesemaker, 47-year-old
James Little.
In 1984, as they were about to start up, they were approached by
officials from the Scottish Office who asked them to consider
pasteurising the cheese.
''We did at the time look at it very seriously,'' said Errington. ''We
could see on the one hand a niche market for unpasteurised cheese and on
the other hand we obviously had to satisfy ourselves that it was not an
irresponsible thing to offer for sale.''
They sought and received assurances from scientists who had studied
blue cheese and ''decided it was not an irresponsible thing to do
provided we put a lab on our own premises and tested the cheese on a
very regular basis, and that's what we have continued to do''.
Hygiene has always been a top priority and the farm is dotted with
hygiene restriction notices. Errington said James Little, who started in
the cheese-making trade when he left school at 15, was particularly
upset at the condemnation of his product.
Standing in the farm's cheese room in his green apron, white suit and
hat, Little admitted that the environmental health pronouncement was
devastating.
''It was terrible. It was totally unexpected. I've spent 30 years
making cheese and I've never seen it before affecting us this way. We
have a code of practice we follow every day; we do everything to the
best of our ability.''
Little said they were hopeful that Lanark Blue would win out in the
end, but for him damage has already been done. ''The cheese is wasted
now anyway. We spent all year making it. My profession is the cheese,
and that's a loss to me.''
Errington, meanwhile, has been under enormous strain since day one,
with taunts at school for his daughters and a sense that they are now
under siege.
''When it first happened in December and January we felt very
isolated. Nobody really knew about it and nobody cared. That was an
awful time for the family. It was Christmas and it was a big effort to
keep cheerful.''
Over at Clydesdale District Council headquarters, the director of
environmental health, Bob Russell, says his staff have felt equally
beleaguered.
''All the district council, myself, and the staff, are unhappy that we
have been painted as the bad guys in rather insulting terms used by the
media,'' he said. ''We have been described as health fascists, as the
Gestapo. It's highly insulting but we have come to accept it because
that's part of the public servants' lot. My view is that I would much
rather be criticised for doing my job than be criticised for not doing
my job.''
Mr Russell said the council had acted properly throughout the entire
matter and would continue to do so.
''If you take a step back from all of this and look very closely at
what's happening, the district council, as an environmental health
authority, has certain obligations placed upon it under the Food Safety
Act. The guidelines are very clear and we acted on that. We carried out
our duties exactly as laid down.''
Back at Walston Braehead Farm, Humphrey Errington admits that the
issue has gone beyond a batch of cheese and that he has become a
standard bearer for many who feel the grip of bureaucracy has become a
little too tight. He says he is committed to fighting on and touches the
pile of letters in front of him. ''I feel I owe it to them,'' he says.

BUSES with full driver protection screens were transferred to Airdrie
from depots all over Lanarkshire yesterday as an emergency response to
the latest in a series of violent attacks.
Two drivers, one a woman, were badly injured on Wednesday night when
masked men armed with a gun and a baseball bat held up their Kelvin
Central bus at a terminus in Petersburn, Airdrie, and stole the takings
of a few pounds.
The 20-year-old man, who was off duty at the time, was hit over the
head and knocked unconscious. The 28-year-old woman driver was
threatened with the gun and struck across the legs with a baseball bat.
She later managed to drive the bus back to the town's main depot before
raising the alarm.
The armed attack, the second in just over a week and the third in
months, provoked the depot's 166 drivers to hold a meeting last night
and to demand full protection when working night-time shifts. Many were
angry that screens that separate drivers from passengers had not been
installed earlier.
Mr Bryan Russell, depot shop steward, said: ''We're appalled at the
situation that is going on and quite honestly it has been left to go on.
A request for safety screens was made after the first armed raid in
December, but very little has happened.
''The drivers are not just scared -- they are petrified. The areas
they go into are very quiet. There is nobody about to witness anything,
help, or raise the alarm.''
Mr Russell did praise Kelvin Central for reacting quickly to the
latest attack. Company managers spent much of the day organising the
movement of buses with protection to Airdrie.
''They moved very swiftly today,'' he added. ''The buses are fitted
with the old-fashioned screens and the drivers want screens that can be
raised during the day.
''But it doesn't really matter what screens are installed -- if people
are still able to get at the money drivers are at risk. We would like a
system where the money is stored in a secure vault away from the
driver.'' The Airdrie depot manager, Mr David Houston, said that
customer-friendly safety screens which could be opened had been on order
before the latest attack occurred.
''We're very concerned about these attacks. We have arranged to swop
buses with other depots so that we can meet the drivers' requirements.
They are fitted with the old-type screens that don't open, but we are in
the process of designing screens that will allow drivers to have contact
with passengers.
''The vast majority of our passengers do not attack the drivers and we
do not want to alienate them.''
The drivers agreed at last night's meeting to run night-time services
as normal with the old-type screens after hearing that union officials
and management will work to get the new-type screens fitted as soon as
possible.

A BISEXUAL pharmacy technician was jailed for life yesterday for the
murder of a 57-year-old retired seaman.
Iain Mackie, 24, of Maybank Villas, Corstorphine, Edinburgh, was found
guilty of murdering Mr Hewie Noble in the victim's home in Broomhall
Drive, Carrick Knowe, Edinburgh, early on Christmas Day last year. The
High Court in Edinburgh heard that Mr Noble was stabbed in the chest and
back 26 times and his throat slashed.
The court heard that the victim was a homosexual and that the two men
had had a sexual encounter shortly before the murder.

SCOTLAND could miss the opportunity of becoming a leading centre in
the age of the information super-highway if it does not free itself of
the attitudes and political culture inherited from the days of the
industrial revolution, argued former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil
last night.
Mr Neil, speaking at a dinner organised by The Herald in association
with the Glasgow Hilton Hotel, told the audience: ''The main source of
economic growth in the 21st century will come from telecommunications
allied to the computer. It will be a repeat performance of the
industrial revolution, but on a far greater scale.''
Just as the railways had created the urban world we all now knew, so
the Internet would shape tomorrow's society: work would now come to the
workers.
No other nation of Scotland's size had made as big a contribution to
the civilised world in the past. ''The information age gives Scotland
its chance to play its part again.''
But he warned: ''We are cribbed and confined by the legacies of the
industrial age, the attitudes and the political culture that came out of
that age.''
Last night's event was the first in a series of ''World of Hilton''
dinners featuring speakers of international reputation. A Young Achiever
award was presented to Mr Danny Goldie, 29, production manager of SCA
Packaging Scotland.

WARNINGS about exposure to summer sunshine began on TV weather
forecasts this week. But while the risks of overdoing it on the beach
are increasingly well recognised, those associated with ''indoor''
sunshine -- sun beds -- may not be so widely understood. Ironically,
centres can be at their busiest right now as people try to acquire a
''starter'' tan for their holidays.
A guide from Edinburgh District Council's Environmental Health
Department provides an 18-point safety check covering UV exposure times,
electrical safety, temperature control, eye protection and hygiene.
It's important, for example, to shower for tanning sessions with soap
that does not contain a sensitising agent. To ensure your health studio

Margaret Vaughan examines a taxing problem as the Inland Revenue eyes
insurance policies that provide an income.
IT'S a tax on insecurity, squealed the Liberal Democrats' Malcolm
Bruce; it's nuts, lunacy, and madness, shouted the Tory Nicholas
Winterton; it's a disgrace, thundered Labour's Gordon Brown. It won't
happen, said the Chancellor.
Thus was any notion by the Inland Revenue that it might tax pay-outs
from mortgage protection policies consigned, swiftly, to the trash can
of tax wheezes that won't wash on Tuesday. Yesterday the Treasury
disclosed that the Inland Revenue is still considering whether pay-outs
on other insurance policies should be taxed.
The Chancellor's earlier insouciant insistence that it was a problem
solved in 10 minutes seems to have erred on the sunny side. For the
political implications of what began as a simple way of shifting the
costs of paying the mortgage interest of those forced out of work by
redundancy or long-term sickness from the state to the individual, by
making people take out personal insurance, are taking longer to sink in.
No, no, no, it's not a new tax insisted a plaintive John Major when
confronted by Tony Blair in combat mode at Prime Minister's question
time. What is it then? Can anybody out there tell us?
Alan Barr, a tax law specialist at Edinburgh University made a brave
stab: ''Basically, benefits from insurance policies may be taxable as
income under certain circumstances after 364 days. One year's pay-outs
are tax free, thereafter they can be treated as income by the Inland
Revenue.'' Still with us? He goes on: ''On Tuesday, the Chancellor said
mortgage protection insurance would be exempt. The Treasury seems to be
saying that what they are now considering is exactly the same piece of
law being applied to insurance policy proceeds which replace income, and
which are not exempt from tax.''
It does not mean, for instance, that you will be taxed on pay-outs if
you are burgled or if you have to replace your car after an accident.
Such claims are treated as capital: ''Now, many insurance companies and
the credit-card companies are offering bolt-on additions to policies,
which mean that if you are forced out of work you get a pay-out on the
policy. You are replacing income that you would otherwise get from
employment. It doesn't sound fair, but that's not the issue for the
Inland Revenue.''
The law in question is Schedule D, Case Three of Income Tax, under the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, Section 18.
''You can insure against anything,'' says Mr Barr. But not against the
Inland Revenue applying legislation which, in part, goes back to the
nineteenth century and which has not been applied until now because
until recently it was hardly worth the effort to collect the tax. Now it
is estimated that some 10 million people take out cover on their credit
card debts or personal loans.
The Treasury insisted yesterday that the tax man has yet to come to
any definitive view: ''Inland Revenue has recently been asked by the
industry to consider its view on how the tax law applies to insurance
for other payments to cover credit cards and other household bills,'' a
Treasury spokesman said.
A meeting has been set up between the Inland Revenue and the
Association of British Insurers: ''The Inland Revenue will in due course
report to Ministers. Permanent health insurance policies are taxable and
tax is being collected, subject to the long-standing concession whereby
some payments are exempt for the first year.''
Still confused? Then spare a thought for Mr Roger Evans, the Social
Security Minister responsible for the mortgage interest changes, who did
not appear aware earlier this year that the Treasury was conducting the
review of such charges which the Chancellor jettisoned on Tuesday.
In a letter circulated to mortgage lenders two months ago, Mr Evans
indicated that the Inland Revenue would insist on payment of tax where
applicable and that insurance companies ''should deduct this tax from
mortgage protection policy benefits''.
It is perfectly explicable, says Kenneth Gibb, an economist in Glasgow
University's Centre for Housing Research and Urban Studies. After months
of research on the Government's proposals to switch mortgage protection
from the state to insurance cover, he concluded that it wouldn't work.
The current shambles is indicative of how misguided is the idea that you
can replace social welfare with a personal insurance net: ''This kind of
move from providing support through social security to insurance won't
work because it's essentially the same as a private unemployment scheme
-- it simply doesn't work as a comprehensive alternative. It hasn't in
any other country.''
The curbs on mortgage interest relief, which will take effect from
October, provoked something akin to panic among homeowners in less than
secure employment. The new legislation led to a sharp increase in
inquiries about mortgage protection policies. Typically such insurance
covers monthly mortgage repayments of up to #1000 a year, after an
excess period.
Before the Budget, home owners could rely on income support to help
with mortgage interest payments if they lost their jobs. The
Chancellor's decision to curtail this help is aimed at cutting the
social security bill. It had risen from just #31m in 1979 to #1.1bn this
year.
People taking out loans from October will be expected to cover
themselves by insurance or by some other means for the first nine months
of unemployment or if they give up through illness. After nine months,
help with payment of mortgage interest will be available to those who
are eligible for income support.
This latest row over taxing insurance payouts can be seen as a direct
consequence of the new rules. As more people seek ways of covering
themselves financially against hard times, the insurance industry sought
clarification of the tax rules and the Inland Revenue was keen, with its
new improved business ethos, to take a look at the pickings.
Mr Gibb warns that there will be a significant number of losers in the
insurance game: ''The insurers want low-risk people taking out
insurance. On the other side are those at high risk. From the insurance
industry's point of view, the wrong people will be taking out
insurance.''
The industry will screen applicants and decide whether they are a good
risk. Those most at risk of losing their jobs will be first in the queue
to take out policies to cover themselves. They are the most likely to be
turned away or face swingeing insurance payments, he argues: ''I think
there are technical problems, that the coverage won't be complete and it
can't be as comprehensive as social security which by definitition
covers everybody who falls into the gutter. It won't happen with private
insurance.''

Lusaka, Thursday
SIX months after the Angolan government and Unita rebels signed an
accord aimed at ending one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars, leaders of
the two sides meet tomorrow to try to make sure that peace lasts.
Political analysts said the two rivals, Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos and Unita leader Jonas Savimbi, needed much more than a
simple handshake: they must come up with results rather than gestures in
order for the peace to stick.
''Both leaders need a commitment from each other . . . to repair
mutual confidence which has been shattered over the years,'' one Western
diplomat said.
On the agenda will be ways to prop up the fragile peace accord signed
in Lusaka last November, participation by Savimbi's Unita in the
government of the oil and diamond-rich country and the integration of
the two sides' armed forces.
Each side has accused the other of repeatedly violating the ceasefire,
delaying the arrival of 7600 UN peacekeepers.--Reuter.

Bonn, Thursday
THE son of a British soldier has been jailed indefinitely for stabbing
to death a British woman at Britain's Rheindahlen military headquarters
in Germany, a spokesman said today.
A court-martial yesterday ordered 19-year-old Alan Martin held
indefinitely because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder, said
spokesman George Attard-Manche.
''He will be sent back to a civilian prison in the UK, I would think
at the first opportunity,'' he added.
Vanessa Chappell, 30, was found dead along a jogging trail at the
Rheindahlen base on February 4, 1994. She was believed to have been
killed a couple of days earlier.
Reports at the time said she was handcuffed and stabbed in the face
and throat.
Martin denied killing Ms Chappell, but said he had sex with her.
The woman, from Stockport, near Manchester, had been working at
Rheindahlen since 1993 as a computer operator. She was not married.--AP.

Madrid, Thursday
POLICE today rescued 41 British tourists choking in dense smoke after
strikers set fire to a barricade of tyres inside a tunnel in Bilbao, the
port city on Spain's north coast.
The tourists were trapped in their coach just after arriving aboard
the 37,000-tonne P &amp; O ferry Pride of Bilbao from Portsmouth.
They were taken from the coach, their faces covered, by police and
other rescue workers and led nearly 200 yards out of the tunnel to
safety.
One of the Britons was treated for the effects of smoke and shock at a
nearby hospital.
Chris Davey, P &amp; O's port manager in Bilbao, said: ''This could have
been a disaster. Only the very quick action of the police prevented a
very possible tragedy.
''Conditions inside the tunnel must have been horrendous with the
thick smoke from the burning rubber.''
He added: ''I have asked the authorities for a full account of what
happened and who was responsible. I am also seeking a guarantee that
nothing like this will happen again.''
There are two tunnels in each direction from the busy port and ferry
terminal area leading to a motorway. ''One was blocked for alterations
and the other was taking traffic both ways,'' said Mr Davey.
He said: ''The action was very stupid. I don't think it was aimed at
British tourists in particular, but everyone knew that the ferry had
just arrived.
''We had 900 passengers on board and a lot of freight, so it was
obvious there was going to be a fair amount of traffic in the tunnel.''
Strikers from the militant local hauliers' association demanding
better contracts and fees had already built and burned barricades on
several major roads around the city before they struck in the tunnel.
An official at Bilbao's emergency rescue co-ordination centre said:
''What shocked us was that these tyres were set on fire inside the
tunnel. Any sane person would have known what might happen.
''These passengers were trapped on board the coach. There were also
two lorries stuck in the tunnel. We had to go in and get those trapped
out of the vehicles and out of the tunnel on foot.
''They were coughing and spluttering and gasping for air. We were
lucky that it was not far more serious.''
A sports centre six miles away was opened to care for those rescued.
They were checked by doctors and Red Cross workers, given a shower, and
changed out of their smoke-ridden clothes.
After a meal, they were able to continue their journey to the city of
Burgos, 150 miles south.
The coach driver, Bob Jenkins, 49, told how he and the group's tour
guide took the tourists to safety from the tunnel in single file.
''The guide led the way and I brought up the rear, carrying a torch.
It was pitch black and very frightening. We were all choking and
coughing.
''There is a toilet on the coach and we all soaked handkerchiefs and
tissues and put them to our faces before we got off.''
He told how a van overtook his coach in the tunnel and then stopped.
He said: ''They blocked the road and threw out these tyres. Then they
doused them in petrol and set them ablaze.
''We didn't know what was happening. We sat tight for a few minutes
and then realised we had to get out. There was absolutely no panic.''
The tourists, all from the Portsmouth area, were on an eight-day trip
to northern and central Spain.
One of them, retired Navy dockyard engineer Brian Edwards, 61, said:
''It's not true to say we were rescued. We got out ourselves.''

Freetown, Thursday
SIERRA Leone's Revolutionary United Front rebels massacred about 150
people in an attack on the diamond centre of Koidu, state television
reported today.
''RUF rebels in the early hours of the 29th of April attacked Koidu
town and massacred about 150 people,'' the television said in a filmed
report last night. Witnesses fleeing to the capital Freetown put the
number of dead much higher.
The witnesses, interviewed in Freetown today, said up to 200 people
died in Koidu but one suggested this may have included those killed
during fighting in a counter-offensive by government troops and civilian
volunteers.
According to the witness accounts, rebels numbering about 50 entered
Koidu town, 200 miles east of Freetown, and attacked the secretariat of
the military government's National Provisional Ruling Council there.
Government soldiers guarding the building fled, leaving behind large
quantities of arms and ammunition.
''The rebels were on a killing spree. They killed anyone they came
across in Koidu, especially when they were retreating from the town,'' a
witness told Reuters.
Another witness offering a different account said: ''While the rebels
were busy preparing their defences on the newly gained ground, a joint
force of the military and civilian volunteers counter-attacked, hence
the resulting carnage and loss of life.''
Sierra Leone's civil war, which began in 1991, has devasted much of
the countryside, and the rebels have recently attacked the heavily
defended approaches to the capital. Rebels and government troops trade
accusations of who has killed civilians and destroyed homes and
businesses.
RUF spokesman Ibrahim Jalloh called Reuters in Abidjan earlier to say
the rebels were in control of Kono district, of which Koidu is the
capital. He denied RUF had been driven out of the area but made no
mention of fighting.

Cape Town, Thursday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela and Zulu nationalist leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi exchanged smiles and handshakes today, trying to defuse a
dispute that could set off more fighting among their followers.
Their appearance before cameras contrasted with rhetoric of previous
days that included Buthelezi's call for supporters to resist the central
government and Mandela's threat to cut off federal funds to
KwaZulu-Natal, the province that Buthelezi's party controls.
''(We) do not think there is a crisis,'' Mandela said after talks with
Buthelezi, head of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and Home
Affairs minister in Mandela's government. Both men smiled and appeared
at ease.
''We will look at the problems at our own pace,'' Mandela said.
Later, in a speech to parliament, Buthelezi said Mandela had pledged
to take up Inkatha's calls for international mediation with other
African National Congress leaders.
Buthelezi accuses Mandela of reneging on a promise for international
mediation on how much power regional governments should have compared to
the central government. Inkatha believes the ANC-controlled central
government cannot be trusted to protect Zulu culture and traditions.
Mandela has said the issues are internal ones not requiring
international mediators.
The promise of mediation induced Inkatha to take part in last year's
vote, according to Buthelezi, who eventually joined Mandela's coalition
government under a power-sharing formula.
Fighting between Mandela's ANC and Inkatha in the traditional Zulu
homeland killed thousands of blacks in the decade prior to last year's
all-race election that brought the ANC to power.
The violence, which decreased with Inkatha's decision to enter the
elections, has begun to rise again.
The independent Human Rights Committee said today that KwaZulu-Natal
Province was the site of nearly two-thirds of the 1518 deaths attributed
to political violence since the vote.
''This province is the only area where old-style political violence
continues,'' the committee said. ''The killings have been largely
ignored by political leaders and no clear initiatives have yet been made
to end them.
* The number of South Africans leaving the country outstripped legal
immigrants in 1994 for the first time in six years, the Department of
Home Affairs said today.
Most of the 10,235 emigrants were professionals headed to Europe, the
department said in a report to Parliament. Legal immigrants, also mostly
professionals, numbered 6398.
The department did not break down the figures by race, but
professionals were likely to be white. South African politicians have
expressed concern that whites who benefited from preferential education
and employment under apartheid would take their much-needed skills
abroad because they feared living under a black-led government.
At the same time, thousands of illegal immigrants were coming to South
Africa, most from Mozambique and other African nations. Estimates for
illegal immigrants were unavailable, but the number of deportees --
90,692 last year -- is a measure of the influx.
South Africa has one of the strongest economies in the region, and its
transition from apartheid to black-led democracy last year has only
increased the country's pull on people living in poor neighboring
countries.--AP.

Kigali, Thursday
SOME 270 besieged Hutus agreed to leave Rwanda's Kibeho camp today but
many more refused to quit the filthy site where thousands of their
tribesmen were slaughtered 12 days ago.
Reporters who visited Kibeho said they counted 270, mostly women and
children, filing out of the squalid compound and boarding UN trucks.
Others told UN officials they would leave tomorrow.
They said the UN had laid on more than 20 trucks to transport the
Hutus back to villages they abandoned last year at the height of war and
genocidal killings.
The nearly 1800 Hutus besieged by Tutsi troops at Kibeho told Interior
Minister Seth Sendashonga yesterday they would leave and go home.

Washington, Thursday
RUPERT Murdoch won his battle with the Federal Communications
Commission today. The FCC ruled that his Fox television network could
have a waiver of the rule against foreign ownership if he could show
that the network operates in the public interest.
Fox should have no difficulty in meeting that undemanding standard.
While it may be argued that some Fox programmes have led the way in
sleaze, it cannot be said that the other networks have hesitated to
follow or even surpass the worst that Fox can offer.
If Fox is not in the public interest, than neither are any of the
other three established networks. Furthermore, there is no doubt that
Fox has increased competition among the networks.
It may be that bad television drives out good, though the case is more
difficult to make here than in Britain because of the generally low
standards. But the FCC sees competition as a good in itself, and Fox
amply satisfies that.
The charge against Murdoch was that although he became an American
citizen in 1985 in order to buy six television stations and form a new
network, the ultimate ownership of the company rested with News Corp in
Australia.
There is an ancient law on the books providing that broadcast outlets
cannot be more than 25% foreign-owned.

Brussels, Thursday
A CARPENTER accused of kidnapping one of Sweden's top showjumpers
pleaded with his captive for forgiveness after she told a court of her
traumatic ordeal.
Ulrike Bidegard, who was kidnapped in January 1993 from her home in
Brussels, told the Belgian court how she was gagged, bound and strapped
into a coffin-like box for five days before police rescued her.
The accused, Lars Nilsson, 33, did not look up during Bidegard's
testimony but asked for forgiveness after she had described the brutal
kidnapping. She was then 28 years old.
''I want to ask for forgiveness. It is a terrible thing that happened
. . . I hoped that she can put this terrible experience behind her,'' he
said.
Bidegard, who married one of her rescuers and is now pregnant with her
first child, said her captor gave her only two bananas and a few glasses
of water during her imprisonment.
The water tasted peculiar and she believed it probably contained
drugs.
''It was very hot in the box and I had problems breathing,'' said
Bidegard, who told the court she was claustrophobic.
''I asked him many times to let me free, to untie my hands, but he
never did,'' she said.
Nilsson did not let her out of the box to go to the toilet and even
refused a request to let her remove a hair pin which was sticking into
her head under the blindfold and causing pain.
''I asked many times, but he always said no,'' she said.
Bidegard, who was part of the Swedish showjumping team at the 1992
Barcelona Olympics, said her captor demanded a #300,000 ransom from her
wealthy industrialist father.
''He told me that if he did not get the money, he would murder me,''
Bidegard told the court.
She was finally released on February 1 when police stormed the
Brussels apartment where she was being kept.
Bidegard's mother, Lena Adler, said outside the court that she could
never forgive Nilsson. ''It does not help to apologise now. It is too
late for that,'' she said.
The case continues.--Reuter.

THE curse of Ethiopia's Olympic marathon champions has struck again.
Mamo Wolde, who won the Olympic title in 1968, in Mexico, has been
detained for the past three years on charges which carry the death
penalty, it was confirmed yesterday.
Ethiopian sports officials said that Wolde, who also won Olympic
silver and bronze, is suspected of having taken part in the ''Red
Terror'' campaigns under the Derg, the former Marxist government which
overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie.
Sibehat Belya, first vice-president of the Ethiopian Olympic
committee, said in Addis Ababa that the former athlete is alleged to
have served in the revolutionary guard of ousted dictator Mengistu Haile
Mariam during the pogroms of the 1970s. His case is being investigated
and is expected to be taken to court soon.
''The Ethiopian Olympic committee has petitioned the government on
behalf of the Olympic hero. Since he is suspected of involvement in
capital offences, we have been advised to await the verdict of the
court,'' Sibehat said.
''We intend to appeal to the government to consider Mamo's sports
exploits and show leniency towards him.''
Wolde won the Mexico Olympic marathon by more than three minutes a
week after having won silver at 10,000 metres. Four years later at the
age of 40 he won marathon bronze at the Munich Olympics. Now he is in
the End of the World jail, in Addis.
During the Red Terror, the Derg's victims included children, who were
shot on the streets. Before retrieving the bodies, parents were forced
to pay for the bullets used.
A member of the Ethiopian Olympic Committee has been allowed to visit
Wolde regularly in jail, and provide him with sports equipment.
Mystery surrounds the fate of Wolde's family, however. The committee
has been paying #50 a month in compensation for the runner's suspended
pension payments. Sibehat says Wolde's wife is alive and receiving the
monthly payments.
But the human rights organisation, Amnesty International, which has
taken up the case, insist the athlete's wife died in 1993, and he had
not been allowed to attend the funeral. Amnesty says it has never seen
any evidence to suggest that Wolde, a local government official at the
time of his arrest, had been implicated in any human rights abuses.
A spokesman for the International Olympic Committee said president
Juan Antonio Samaranch had sent an urgent message to the president of
the Ethiopian Olympic Committee requesting a detailed report.
Wolde's predecessor as Olympic champion, Abebe Bikila, found two
marathon gold medals bestowed no luck.
Bikila, a member of Haile Selassie's Imperial bodyguard, memorably won
the marathon barefooot in record time in Rome, in 1960, then performed a
gymnastic routine including handsprings to demonstrate how fresh he was.
Four years later, despite an appendix operation just six weeks earlier,
Bikila became the first man to to retain the Olympic marathon crown,
again in record time. This time, however, he wore shoes.
In 1968, as Wolde won, the 36-year-old Bikila was forced to drop out
of the Mexico marathon. The following year he broke his neck in a car
accident, suffering paralysis. He spent four years in a wheelchair
before his death in 1973.

Paris, Thursday
FRANCE'S presidential campaign heated up today as frontrunner Jacques
Chirac unsettled the franc with a call for a referendum on European
Union ahead of Sunday's contest against Socialist Lionel Jospin.
Anxious to mop up the last of the undecided voters -- latest surveys
put them at 20% of the electorate -- Chirac aides warned of
Italian-style political paralysis if underdog Jospin won.
Jospin, dropping the courtesy that marked a marathon face-to-face
debate this week, retorted with a charge that Chirac had an ''archaic''
idea of the presidency and lacked a leader's vision.

Grozny, Thursday
FIGHTING raged between Chechen rebels and the Russian army today,
sparking fears that the violence could spoil a giant party planned for
more than 50 world leaders in Moscow next week.
Heads of state from around the world are due in Moscow for May 9
celebrations marking the end of the Second World War in Europe 50 years
ago.
Today Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said all but a few rebels
had been crushed, but they could still ''spoil the festive mood''.
Western leaders have criticised Moscow's four-month war in Chechnya to
end the tiny region's bid for independence. In an apparent attempt to
stifle more criticism Russian troops have been trying to finish the job
before May 9.
Grachev said he has no plans to talk peace with Chechen commanders
until after the end of the Victory Day celebrations.
Meanwhile in a clear sign that the war is far from over the Kremlin
decided to send in marines specially trained to fight
guerrillas.--Reuter.

BOSNIAN Serb leader Radovan Karadzic tonight pledged to help defend
his Croatian Serb allies regardless of any undertakings to the United
Nations.
''I am fully obliged to help them,'' he told CNN in an interview from
the Serb-held city of Banja Luka in Bosnia. ''We are going to defend all
our people by all our means.''
He said the UN had not reacted to his request that Western Slavonia be
turned into a safe zone like those for Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica,
Sarajevo and Gorazde.
''Since it did not happen we do not have any obligation towards the
international community, particularly the UN, because they are not
treating Serbs equally,'' he said.
Meanwhile Milan Babic, foreign minister of Croatia's self-appointed
Krajina Serb republic, denied his side had ever accepted an invitation
to meet a Croatian government delegation for peace talks in Geneva.
''Such a meeting is impossible in the present renewed hostilities and
aggression by Croatia against the Serb people,'' he said.

Pakrac, Croatia, Thursday
THE Croatian army today captured the last pocket of rebel resistance
in a Serb enclave overrun in a flash offensive, rounding up prisoners in
handcuffs before jeering crowds.
Croatian troops wrested back the Western Slavonia region in central
Croatia this week in their first significant victory over rebel minority
Serbs who seized almost a third of Croatia after it seceded from
Yugoslavia in 1991.
Government soldiers occupied the rebel half of the town of Pakrac this
afternoon after a final two-hour firefight with diehard fighters of the
18th Krajina Serb brigade, some of them holed up in woods nearby.
Local Serb commander Lieutenant-Colonel Stevo Harambasic and the top
two civilian officials from Serb-occupied Pakrac surrendered and were
handcuffed after being escorted to the government side in a UN armoured
car.
Scores of militiamen then came down from the hills or emerged from
hiding places in the Serb part of town and were marched off at gunpoint
by Croatian soldiers.
Croatian civilians gathered to jeer some of the dishevelled
separatists as they trudged by with their arms held in the air.
Hundreds of women, children and elderly carrying possessions as if
fearing they would be driven out of Pakrac, queued in the streets to be
searched and identified by Croatian troops.
''Yes, I want to stay here. I accept everything. I'm an old man.
Whichever way you look at it, this is where I earned my pension and I'm
not going anywhere,'' said one elderly Serb.
''We didn't need this. Croatia was always ours. I've always lived and
worked here,'' said a bitter Serb woman.
Croatian soldiers tore down a ''Republic of Serbian Krajina'' sign
from the police station in the rebel half of the town and replaced it
with the emblem of the Republic of Croatia.
Artillery, mortar and small-arms fire raged in Pakrac today despite a
truce pact hastily negotiated by Akashi the day before to prevent the
Slavonian fighting from spreading to other Serb-held enclaves.
The Serbs stopped shelling the Croatian side of Pakrac at 4pm after
bowing to Zagreb's demands for unconditional surrender, state television
said. Government soldiers then entered the rebel side of town amid
general calm.
But sporadic artillery booms could still be heard in the wooded hills
above Pakrac at dusk, suggesting some Serbs were still refusing to lay
down their arms.
''There have been skirmishes in the woods today and our units are now
combing the terrain. But the (Serbs) cannot hold out any longer in these
woods so our entire operation should be over tonight,'' said Interior
Minister Ivan Jarnjak.
''All civilians will be cared for and prisoners-of-war will be treated
according to international conventions,'' he said.
Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy for former Yugoslavia, tried to reach
the area by helicopter to smooth the surrender but had to turn back when
Croatians refused to let him land.
Meanwhile, Serb shells crashed into the northwestern town of Bihac
today, killing a woman and injuring six, four of them children, the UN
said.
Pro-Bosnian government Sarajevo radio said two had died in the attack.

A FORMER student protester who marched on the Scottish headquarters of
the BBC in the 70s was yesterday appointed to its management board as
secretary of BBC Scotland.
Ms Maggie Cunningham, 39, from Scalpay, off Harris, is the editor of
Radio nan Gaidheal, the Gaelic radio service, and several other Radio
Scotland programmes.
She has held the job, based in Inverness, since 1992.
Yesterday she admitted she was one of the leading demonstrators in two
marches against BBC plans to move Gaelic programmes to FM in the
mid-70s.
''I have no regrets. I was a student then and it was an appropriate
thing to do at that time.''
But yesterday she finally admitted that the BBC had probably been
right all along.
She said: ''Looking back, I think moving to FM, or VHF as we called it
then, was the best thing that could happen.
''The quality is so much better than the scratchy medium wave we were
used to.''
She is a former newspaper reporter and TV presenter, and is married to
John Byrne, who works with Highlands and Islands Enterprise in
Inverness.
Ms Cunningham will provide a secretariat service for the BBC's
national governor for Scotland, the Rev Norman Drummond, and for the
Broadcasting Council for Scotland.
She will take up her duties later in the summer.

A COUPLE told yesterday how they tried in vain to save their
two-year-old son as he choked on a sausage.
Conor Ryan, from Newtongrange, Midlothian, was eating a sausage
casserole and chips on Tuesday evening when he began choking.
His stepfather, Mr Mark Ryan, 26, took hold of the boy and tried to
dislodge the food from his throat by hitting his back.
When the child started to turn blue, Mr Ryan turned him upside down
and attempted to clear the obstruction by shaking him up and down, to no
avail.
He then tried to remove the obstruction from the boy's throat with his
fingers before summoning help from neighbours who called the emergency
services.
Paramedics eventually managed to remove the obstruction with forceps
at the scene.
The unconscious boy was taken to the Royal Sick Children's Hospital,
in Edinburgh, where he was put on a life-support machine. However he
failed to revive, and the life-support machine was switched off at
5.30am on Wednesday.
The couple -- who married in March -- said the boy had suffered from
asthma and had also fought off a bout of pneumonia since he was born. He
had difficulty swallowing and had had his tonsils and adenoids removed
in an attempt to ease the problem.
The choking incident happened on Tuesday at around 7pm as the family
were settling down to have a meal in the living room.
The boy was sitting in his toddler chair and table next to his parents
when he began eating the casserole.
Mrs Amanda Ryan, 24, said her son began to choke. ''I began panicking.
I was so distressed I couldn't do anything''.
She added: ''He was the happiest wee laddie you could ever meet. He
was a boy who would be the apple of any parent's eye and now he's
gone''.
Mr Ryan said: ''I did everything I could and it wasn't working.
''I ran outside into the street with Conor. His face turned a blue and
sickly yellow colour.
''Then just before the ambulance arrived his body went limp in my
arms.''
Yesterday a hospital spokesman confirmed the boy had died from
asphyxiation.
He will be buried next week.

A GLASGOW-based firm has won a national architecture competition for
the design of the proposed Scottish National Science Centre on the
former garden festival site.
Glasgow Development Agency yesterday unveiled the glass-fronted design
by Building Design Partnership that will be the cornerstone of its #90m
bid to develop Pacific Quay in the heart of Glasgow.
The pea-pod shaped science centre, along with a 100ft Millennium
Tower, forms the centrepiece of the GDA-led consortium bid to the
Millennium Commission. The plan for the 47-acre site also includes an
Imax large-format cinema and planetarium, a business park, a hotel,
restaurants, and a bridge across the Clyde.
Building Design Partnership's concept was chosen from plans submitted
by 12 leading British architects after a competition launched in
November. None of the four shortlisted, including one by the Millennium
Tower architect, Richard Horden, was put on public display.
The winning design was chosen by a six-strong panel led by the GDA's
chief executive, Mr Stuart Gulliver. The company has previously designed
the city's Atlantic Quay and was contracted to design the Channel Tunnel
terminal at Folkestone.
Explaining the layout of the #25m science centre, GDA chairman Forbes
Macpherson said it would be linked to so-called outreach science centres
in towns around Scotland.
''Scotland must celebrate the fact that it enjoys a position as a
world leader in science and technology. The National Science Centre will
not only put that to rights but will make sure that Glasgow further
develops the innovation and technological vision that will be central to
its prosperity in the future.''
Mr Macpherson also announced the setting up of a foundation headed by
the Confederation of British Industry's chairman in Scotland, Professor
John Ward. The foundation will develop the centre and aims to encourage
academic bodies to participate in its running.
The GDA-led consortium is seeking #40m from the Millennium Commission,
which will award funding in the autumn, and hopes to secure #50m from
local authorities and the private sector. The proposal, it claims, will
create a total of 3500 jobs in addition to construction jobs. It is
estimated that it will attract 500,000 visitors a year.
Work started on the site yesterday. Mr Macpherson said that even
without Millennium funding, a lower-key development would go ahead.
However, he said the GDA was confident of getting planning permission
and said the scheme had the backing of the Scottish Office, MPs,
universities, and the Scottish Education Department.
Describing the centre as a pea-pod shaped structure with a ship's hull
feel to it, BDP's Mr Sandy Fergusson said the building would be a
landmark that could be viewed from numerous city vantage points such as
the Kingston Bridge, Govan, and the Clydeside Expressway.
However, Mr Geoffrey Jarvis, director of Clyde Festival Gardens 1999
Ltd, which has submitted a rival proposal to the Millennium Commission,
reiterated his criticisms of the GDA plan.
He said the Clyde Festival proposal incorporated the GDA idea for a
science centre and the Millennium Tower but also included a tropicarium
and a maritime heritage centre. The GDA's bid, he said, was dominated by
car parks.

THE chief executive of Edinburgh District Council has been ordered to
carry out an investigation into how a sculpture made of 8000 old tyres
ended up costing the city more than #120,000.
The inquiry was ordered by the policy and resources committee
yesterday.
When an all-party council committee took the decision to go ahead with
the project, the estimated cost of the sculpture, by Fife-born artist
David Mach, was #90,000, with #40,000 being promised in private
sponsorship. But the final cost was #120,608.
The Conservatives expressed their anger at the cost ''at a time of
savage Labour cuts in services''. Their group leader, Councillor Daphne
Sleigh, said at first she had been told the sculpture would not cost the
city anything, then that it would cost #50,000. Now they were being told
the cost of ''this appalling piece; this pile of junk'' was #120,000.
The Temple of Tyre was part of Edinburgh's failed bid for the City of
Architecture and Design title, which was won by Glasgow.
''Not only did it not get us the title,'' said Councillor Sleigh,
''but the judges didn't even see it because it was not built when they
were here.''
The Temple stood for only four weeks in Leith Docks. Councillor David
Manson pointed out that the city had been gifted, on extended loan,
another sculpture by David Mach -- The Sumo Wrestlers, valued at #30,000
-- which had been erected on the Water of Leith.
Leith Councillor Steve Cardownie said although he had been impressed,
someone had knocked one head off.
''That just shows that even sumo wrestlers don't get their own way in
Leith,'' he added.

A SCOT who serves in the French Foreign Legion has been threatened
with jail and ordered to surrender his passport following a disturbance
he caused on a flight into Glasgow.
Craig McKendrick, 32, whose mother lives in Townhead, Glasgow, caused
so much alarm during the flight from New York that he was arrested on
the tarmac at Glasgow airport.
When he appeared in custody at Paisley Sheriff Court yesterday, he
pled guilty to committing a breach of the peace on board the aircraft by
acting in a disorderly manner.
The court heard how McKendrick drank a half bottle of whisky shortly
after take-off, placed his hands round the neck of a female passenger,
tried to kiss a stewardess, and shouted and swore.
The captain had him put in leg and arm shackles in a spare crew seat
on the British Airways Boeing 757.
Depute fiscal Margo Addison-Scott said that after the accused, who was
drunk, caused a disturbance, he ''had to be carried along the aisle and
began shouting and swearing''.
She added: ''It took five members of crew to control him.''
When arrested by police and cautioned and charged, he again used
abusive language.
His defence agent said he wished to apologise unreservedly for the
alarm he had caused.
Sheriff Neil Douglas deferred sentence until May 25, releasing
McKendrick on bail. He warned that a jail sentence would be considered.

<TEXT>
COLIN Stagg, cleared last year of killing Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon
Common, was given 12 months' probation yesterday for threatening a man
with an axe on the common earlier this year.
Stagg, 31, appeared for sentencing at Wimbledon magistrates court
after pleading guilty last month to possessing an offensive weapon and
threatening behaviour.
The offences occurred not far from the spot where Ms Nickell, a young
mother of 23, was found stabbed in July 1992.
Stagg's fiancee, Diane Beddoes, 26, also appeared for sentencing after
admitting possession of a cosh. She was given a six-month conditional
discharge.
Magistrate Bernard Doswell told Stagg: ''Probation is a punishment --
it's designed to ensure your personal liberty is retracted in some way.
''We hope that the probation officer will give you some support,
because it's clear you are in some ways a target and in some ways it's a
stressful period in your life.''
Mr Mark Dennis, prosecuting, said that Stagg and Beddoes, both of
Roehampton, south-west London, had become involved in an ''altercation''
with 34-year-old gas fitter James Roberts.
Stagg plans to sue the Metropolitan Police over his arrest and
prosecution for the murder of Ms Nickell.
He was cleared of her killing last September when Mr Justice Ognall
ruled that evidence gathered during an eight-month undercover operation
was inadmissible.

But the day-old girl remains critically ill and the next 48 hours are

A spokesman at Singleton Hospital, Swansea, said Mrs Karen
Battenbough, 24, remained in a ''stable'' condition.
He added: ''Preliminary discussions are now taking place with medical
staff at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, with regard to her return to the

<HEADLINE>Top prison service job advertised.  Insiders predict present chief will be front runner</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978551060</RECORDNO>

THE post of chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service, now an
executive agency, is advertised today in national newspapers and
insiders are predicting that Mr Eddie Frizzell, who currently holds the
post, will be the front runner.
Should Mr Frizzell land his own job he could find himself up to
#20,000 better off. He has headed the service for more than three years
and earns a salary believed to be around #60,000.
With the aim of attracting top candidates from industry and other
areas of the public service, the Scottish Office is pitching the new
post at #80,000 with ''more available for a candidate with exceptional
qualifications and experience''.
Although Scottish prisons have enjoyed their most stable period for
decades, with no serious incidents in the last 12 months, the trawl for
a new chief executive was always on the cards. Government policy on
agencies is ostensibly designed to ensure top performance from chief
executives, underpinned by the dogma that the private sector are better
at running large-scale undertakings anyway.
But by any objective standards the SPS job has always been underpaid.
It involves the handling of 4600 staff -- by far the biggest and
toughest Scottish Office enterprise -- and a budget last year of #166m.
Many senior local government figures running departments in the
regional councils are paid far higher salaries and the new SPS level
will be average compared with the salaries of the chief executives of
the new unitary councils next year. The highest will be close to
#100,000 and the general secretary of Cosla, with a staff of 45, will be
paid around #80,000.
The reign of Mr Frizzell over the prisons has, in contrast to the
English system, brought a period of stability and progress despite
record prisoner numbers. He has apparently successfully restructured
staff and working practices with the aim of facing up to
Government-promoted competition from the private sector, although the
main trade union, the SPOA, fought the changes bitterly.
Recent innovations include a new national induction unit at Shotts
Prison and a revised and revitalised small units policy, all designed to
deal with problem prisoners. In addition, the fraught subject of
intervention programmes for sex offenders has been tackled, with the
project at Peterhead Prison attracting international attention.
Another strong factor in favour of retaining Mr Frizzell is the fact
that his experienced and colourful deputy, Alan Walker, has just quit
Scotland to take up one of the top prison posts in England at a salary
in excess of that of his former boss.
The chief executive of the English service, Derek Lewis, has had his
contract -- worth #125,000 plus #35,000 performance bonus -- extended
for another year but in the wake of the Whitemoor Prison Semtex scandal,
the Parkhurst and IRA escapes, and the suicide of Frederick West, prison
commentators are viewing that as a narrow escape.

THE solution to Renfrewshire's current upsurge of criminality, with
drugs and money-lending criminals using guns as routine, was yesterday
pinpointed by Strathclyde's chief constable as a change in the local
culture.
Mr Leslie Sharp, while stating that the police, not the criminals,
were in charge of the streets of Paisley and Renfrewshire, demanded that
the local people had to stop trying to solve their problems in their own
way and start giving unstinted support to the police.
Police action, know as Operation Dragon is under way, and another
series of arrests were made in Paisley and the surrounding areas on
Wednesday. A number of men have already been arrested and have appeared
in court in relation to firearms and intimidation charges.
Detectives are gathering evidence into the murder of Mr Andrew
McLaughlin, shot on his doorstep in Armour Place, Paisley, on March 14.
In the wake of the police blitz and the series of arrests, Mr Sharp's
statement yesterday could be seen as a high-risk strategy, aimed at
persuading the people of Paisley's troubled housing schemes and the
surrounding towns that a decent future is in their own hands, trusting
in the police and not knuckling under to drug dealers and money-lenders.
Mr Sharp said that between September and December 1992, in response to
an upsurge of drink and drugs related violence in Paisley and the
surrounding area, Operations Dove and Hawk had been mounted, resulting
in 570 arrests under Dove and 72 arrests for drugs trafficking,
attempted murder, theft by housebreaking, fraud and firearms offences
under Hawk. The intelligence gathered at that time had been used
successfully since, but the outbreak of gun violence last year led to
the current Operation Dragon.
Mr Sharp detailed six firearms incidents since January, including the
murder but emphasised that it was wrong to refer to the operation as
being based solely in Paisley.
The operation had been hindered by myth and rumour since the first
shooting and by the reluctance of witnesses to give evidence. Despite
that, arrests had been made and the premises of FCB Securities in
Ferguslie Park and the building materials company, Paisley Recoveries,
in Blackstone Road, had been searched and documentation seized.
He said that, since the inception of Operation Dragon, his men had
arrested 198 people for offences including possession of drugs, threats
of intimidation, assault, resisting arrest, breach of the peace,
shoplifting, police assault and public disorder, robbery and illegal
possession of firearms.
He added that, despite rumours to the contrary, firearms had been
issued on one occasion only and that to make an arrest. ''No-one should
be misled by colourful myth and rumour or braggart small-time crooks,''
he declared.
He said witnesses would be protected, stating Paisley was as safe as
it was 10 or 15 years ago.
''Strathclyde Police are in control of the streets, they always have
been and they always will be. With the help of the public we can bring
this trouble to an end.''

SCOTRAIL has had to put an extra carriage on the threatened Fort
William sleeper service to cope with increased demand, it was revealed
yesterday.
The convener of Highland Regional Council, Duncan McPherson announced
this as he left for Edinburgh and the Court of Session, which this
morning will consider the council's case against the withdrawal of the
service.
He said the service had been running close to capacity and, from May
18 to the last scheduled journey on May 26, it was fully booked. He
accepted that some of this was due to people wishing to make a last
nostalgic journey, but there were other reasons.
''Since ScotRail took over responsibility for sleeper services on
March 6, usage of the Fort William service has increased greatly.
''It is clear that people who never knew the train existed before the
recent publicity have been attracted to the service. And it remains my
view that the service has picked up because ScotRail are now marketing
it and have an efficient booking system.''
A ScotRail spokesman said last night that Mr McPherson's information
was correct. The extra carriage had been introduced after Easter and
would run until May 26.
Meantime, Labour claimed yesterday that Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
had conspired to con the public by withholding information on the
viability of threatened rail services in Scotland.
Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish published a leaked letter to
Mr Lang from franchising director Roger Salmon which suggests the
Government has artificially inflated the amount of subsidy required to
run the Fort William sleeper.
His letter, dated February 6, sets out the seven options available to
him when he made his decision last December not to include the services
in the passenger service requirements for a privatised ScotRail
franchise.
Mr Salmon told Mr Lang the annual subsidy required to run the Fort
William sleeper was #2.4m, or #100 per passenger. This contradicts the
#453 per passenger figure relied on by the Government and British Rail
to justify axing the services.
Mr Salmon also reveals that the average subsidy per passenger on all
ScotRail services is about #4. Yesterday Mr McLeish claimed that
exposing the subsidy posed a threat of ''catastrophic cuts'' to rail
services in Scotland.
Mr McLeish said Mr Salmon had exceeded his brief by announcing he
would not support the Fort William sleeper before the Government had
issued its guidelines for how such decisions should be taken.
''Mr Salmon's letter exposes a web of hypocrisy and deceit concealing
the truth about the axing of the sleeper and Motorail services. It
reveals a conspiracy to deceive the public over the true cost of
subsidies and makes a mockery of the so-called consultation,'' Mr
McLeish said.
''Clearly, political decisions are being taken by the franchise
director based on costs which were to be concealed from the public. And
a quango is being allowed to dictate future passenger service
requirements.''
Mr McLeish claims Mr Lang has failed to use the information provided
by Mr Salmon to defend the threatened services in public.
* Councillors, MPs and other campaigners opposed to threatened
cutbacks in Scotland's train services will gather in Glasgow next week
to discuss the issues arising from British Rail privatisation and its
implications for Scotland.

ALTNACRAIG has withdrawn from the running in the bid to take over
Ferguson Shipbuilders, leaving only Holland House as serious bidders for
the Port Glasgow yard.
Shareholders in Ferguson were informed by letter yesterday that
Altnacraig did not intend to make an offer.
However, the letter stated that the company was continuing to hold
discussions with Holland House, which is believed to have offered more
than #4 a share.
The letter to the Ferguson shareholders makes no reference to any
talks with Yarrow, and it is believed that the defence shipyard is no
longer interested in taking its interest further, but no-one was
available at Yarrow to make a comment.
Sir Ross Belch, chairman of both Altnacraig and Ferguson, said last
night that he was still bound by the City's takeover code, and could not
comment.
The Altnacraig offer for Ferguson was believed to have been #3 cash
plus several shares. One of the difficulties the board of the Port
Glasgow shipyard had when considering the Altnacraig offer was what
value to place on the Altnacraig shares.
The shareholders in Ferguson are covered by the Business Expansion
Scheme regulations which means that, if they sell out for cash now, they
will lose the tax relief advantages provided by the scheme.

WOMEN and children had to be moved to less crowded first-class
compartments to cool down after the air-conditioning system was shut off
for nearly three hours in the sweltering heat yesterday on a through
train from King's Cross to Edinburgh and Glasgow.
The train took more than eight hours to complete its journey, nearly
double its scheduled time. More than 150 furious passengers were met at
Edinburgh's Waverley Station at 10pm last night and told by InterCity
staff they would be getting a refund.
The trouble with the 1.30pm train from London brought the rest of the
east coast rail network in Scotland to a standstill. At one stage five
trains were backed up behind each other just outside Berwick.
The long hold-ups were caused initially by a fire in fields near the
line which stopped the train from King's Cross getting through. When the
blaze was brought under control it was found the train would not start.
A relief train sent from Edinburgh was then unable to get through
after the power lines were switched off for safety reasons.
Passenger Bruce McFarlane said: ''It was an absolute disgrace. The
train first stopped around 5.20pm just outside Berwick because of a
fire. When they tried to get going again around six o'clock they found
that it wouldn't start. The whole thing was a disaster.''
Another passenger said: ''Communication was the real problem. They
kept saying we would be moving in half an hour. They kept saying that
for nearly three hours until we finally did.''
An InterCity employee told The Herald: ''It's been pandemonium. The
inquiry desk at Edinburgh and Glasgow has been inundated with calls.''

AN eleventh-hour out-of-court settlement over an alleged non-payment
of a near #50,000 bill prevented Celtic Football Club being evicted from
their temporary home at Hampden Stadium in Glasgow, it has been
disclosed.
Queen's Park, who own the national stadium, are understood to have
warned Celtic that failure to pay a bill of #47,600 by 5pm last Thursday
for outstanding rent and other costs incurred for using the stadium
would result in their eviction.
Had the eviction threat been carried out Celtic would have had nowhere
to play their fixture earlier this week against Partick Thistle (which
they lost 3-1) or Sunday's Old Firm clash with Rangers.
Celtic intended to challenge the threat by seeking an interdict in the
Court of Session claiming that the dispute should have been referred to
the Scottish Football Association.
In the event, the club did not proceed with the legal action and the
matter was settled out of court.
Mr Peter McLean, spokesman for Celtic, said last night: ''We are
pleased the matter has been resolved. Celtic's bills have been paid on
time throughout the season and are up to date, as they have been
throughout the year.''
The use of the national stadium in the past season is understood to
have cost Celtic about #575,000.
Mr Malcolm MacKay, president of Queen's Park Football Club, declined
to comment on the matter. He would only say last night: ''We don't have
any problems with Celtic Football Club.''
Celtic are hopeful of returning to Celtic Park for the start of next
season.

THE estranged wife of top Scottish snooker star Alan McManus won a
maintenance award yesterday after the break-up of their five-month
marriage.
Kate McManus, 23, was given the interim aliment at a private hearing
in Hamilton Sheriff Court.
A date has yet to be fixed for a full hearing of the aliment claim.
Lawyers for Mrs McManus declined to disclose the amount.
Mrs McManus is seeking advice over the annulment of her marriage to
the 24-year-old snooker ace, rated among the world's top 10.
Her lawyers said there was ''no question'' of divorce proceedings
being launched ''at this time''.
They said that after the breakup of the marriage in December 1994, she
was left with no option other than to leave ''what she thought was her
marital home''.
Mrs McManus's solicitor, Mr Michael Graham, of Glasgow firm Paterson,
Robertson and Graham, said his client had refused ''large sums'' of cash
by newspapers to tell her story.
Callers to Mr McManus's home in Bothwell were told ''No comment''.

ACTOR Mark McManus, who played the leading role in the TV show Taggart
until his death last year, left #563,160 in his will.
The actor amassed the money through a successful 11-year run of the
popular TV detective series which shot him to stardom.
The contents of the will, published yesterday, indicate that his
daughter Kate, from his first marriage, will inherit everything.
Details in the will, drawn up in 1988, reveal that Mr McManus had
invested in building societies and banks.
His estate also includes the proceeds -- almost #100,000 -- from
several life-insurance and pension policies.
A list of fees due to the actor for repeat transmissions of three
Taggart episodes show that he earned between #21,000 and #24,000 for
each broadcast.
One payment of #150 from Strathclyde Police for his involvement in a
recruitment drive is also logged.
The value of personal effects -- including antiques and paintings --
at his properties in Symington, Ayrshire, and Queens Drive, Glasgow, is
put at around #14,000 and a horse he owned -- Scottish Boat Lady -- is
valued at #1200.
Mr McManus, 59, died almost a year ago after he was taken to hospital
suffering from pneumonia.
Those close to him said the actor had drank himself to the grave after
his second wife Marion died of cancer four days before her 40th
birthday.
Alcoholic liver failure was given as the cause of death on his death
certificate.
Thousands lined the streets to pay their last respects at his funeral
last June.
Mr McManus had been struggling to get over the loss of two sisters,
two brothers, and his 88-year-old mother when he was told that his wife
Marion had contracted a rare form of cancer. She died in October 1993.
Within weeks he had shut himself away, spending lonely hours drinking
heavily in the flat he had shared with her on Glasgow's South Side.
The Taggart character he played is known in 50 countries. In the UK
some 13 million viewers regularly tune into the show.
The detailed will, lodged at Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday, contains
an indication that he kept on top of debts and paid his bills with just
a little too much enthusiasm.
Three of the sums which help make up the total to be inherited by his
daughter are refunds from British Telecom, Strathclyde Regional Council,
and Scottish Power for overpayment of telephone charges, council tax,
and electricity charges.

EDINBURGH Lord Provost Norman Irons gave a spirited answer to those
doubting the value of remembering the end of the Second World War.
He had heard questions being asked ''Was the war worth it?'' and ''Why
are we celebrating VE-Day?'', and answered them by referring to the
visit to Auschwitz he and the Lady Provost, Mrs Ann Irons, had made
recently.
Auschwitz was called a concentration camp, but was really an
extermination camp.
The war was fought to defeat fascism and totalitarianism, and ''of
course, it was worth it''.
The Lord Provost, in Princes Street Gardens, was lighting a peace
torch as part of the ceremonies to mark the 50th anniversary of VE-Day.
The flame for the torch was then passed to Lady Jane Gow, wife of
General Sir Michael Gow, who lit a miner's lamp which was being taken to
London by a member of the Sri Chinmoy Peace Run Team.
This flame and others lit in London, Cardiff, and Belfast will be kept
burning tonight in Westminster Abbey before being taken to Hyde Park
tomorrow.
There, the flame will be used by the Queen Mother and Princes Margaret
to light the flame within the large globe of the world, the 70ft
centrepiece of the VE-Day celebrations.
On Monday, the peace runners will relight their torches from the
globe. One of the torches will be handed to the Queen to light a beacon
in Hyde Park, the first in a nationwide chain.
The torches will be carried by thousands of runners this month and in
June in the Sri Chinmoy Oneness Home Peace Run, a biannual relay event
which links more than 70 countries and covers more than 50,000 miles
throughout the world.
* Planning officers who allowed contractors to dismantle a seaside
resort's war memorial last night promised to rebuild it in time for
VE-Day on Monday, writes Rob Robertson.
Locals in Seahouses, near Berwick-Upon-Tweed, were incensed when the
70ft high memorial was taken down on Tuesday.
The borough council said it allowed contractors to take it down
because no official ceremony had been planned for VE-Day.
However after angry locals made it clear they wanted to lay wreaths
and make their own personal tributes the council changed its mind.
The memorial was to have been removed only temporarily as part of a
#250,000 landscaping scheme.
The council's assistant planning officer, Mr Peter Rutherford said:
''The community was not against moving the memorial temporarily. However
the timing has proved very unfortunate.''
* A father and son will participate in the national commemorative
service to mark VE-Day at St Giles' in Edinburgh on Monday.
While former Seaforth Highlander John Falconer, 72, attends the
service with other veterans, his son, Sergeant Ian Falconer, 32, will be
playing with the Army Lowland Band in Parliament Square.
Yesterday Mr Falconer Sr watched his son, playing the bass drum,
rehearsing with the band at Redford Barracks, Edinburgh.
Mr John Falconer, now living in Portobello, fought in Sicily and in
North-west Europe from D Day plus 1. Originally from Pittenweem, Fife,
he served in the Army from 1941-47 and again from 1952-68.

SCOTTISH higher education institutions are to be allowed for the first
time to use capital grants to help pay off money borrowed for equipment
and minor works.
The decision by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to
permit the use of these grants, which amount to #43m for the forthcoming
academic year, to support loans taken out for estates and capital
equipment is recognition that institutions are having to turn to private
finance for project funding.
The council, which receives its funding from the Government, does not
have the resources to meet the needs of the HE sector.
Its chief executive, Professor John Sizer, said the decision gave
institutions additional freedom to raise private money at a time when
resources available to the council remained limited.
Representatives of the UK higher education sector were told recently
that universities would have to turn to the markets if they were to meet
the cost of capital projects into the next century.
Paisley and Edinburgh universities have already been involved in
tentative discussions about setting up a UK consortium to raise up to
#100m on the capital markets.
The pressure for greater borrowing for capital projects has been
caused by the dramatic rise in student numbers.
But the sector is concerned about Government cuts in recurrent
funding, making it more difficult to cover the cost of borrowing.
Professor Sizer said the announcement by the funding council
recognised ''the desirability of giving institutions greater freedom to
decide their own priorities in spending their resources''.
He said: ''In the longer term, the council intends to provide
institutions with grants for teaching and for research which cover both
capital and recurrent requirements.''
For 1995-6, the proportion of funding for computing and information
technology equipment has been increased to help institutions use more
new technology.
Formula funding is being used more in the allocations to institutions
to take greater account of funded student places and teaching and
research grants.
The allocations for equipment and minor works range from more than
#7.4m for Scotland's biggest university, Edinburgh, to #155,000 for the
Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow.

A WATERCOLOUR painted by Earl Haig while he was a prisoner of war will
be on offer at a book sale in Edinburgh to raise money for Christian
Aid.
The painting shows four PoWs lying in bed. It was thought by the sale
organisers to have been done in Colditz in 1942.
Lord Haig, the son of Field Marshal Earl Haig, said yesterday,
however, he thought it had been painted in his first camp in Italy after
he was captured in the Western Desert in 1942. He was later imprisoned
in Colditz.
1 He remembered holding an exhibition of his works in Edinburgh in
1945 after his return from the war, and the watercolour was on display.
The organisers of the book sale at St Andrew's and St George's Church
in George Street received it from a supporter and hope it will fetch a
four-figure sum. The sale runs on May 13 and 15-19.

<HEADLINE>Call to implement ban on cockle harvesting</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978551071</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth Scotland
yesterday accused the Scottish Office and its environmental advisory
body, Scottish Natural Heritage, of failing to implement legislation
which would prevent the cockle population of a beach on Barra from being
devastated.
Mr Kevin Dunion, the FoE Scotland director, said that the Scottish
Office and SNH had the power to implement section 29 of the Wildlife and
Countryside Act, which allows the Secretary of State to take immediate
action to stop destruction of a Site of Special Scientific Interest --
which Traigh Mhor beach is designated -- but had not done so.
He added that a report by the Scottish Office Agriculture and
Fisheries Department had produced a report concluding that ''cockles on
the foreshore analysed cannot support commercial harvesting and that
persuasive environmental arguments against land-based vehicular fishing
exist''.
The report added: ''The cockle stock studies have taken place on prime
cockle sites. As these cannot sustain tractor exploitation, it is
reasonable to extrapolate that no Scottish foreshores, with equivalent
or lesser stocks, would be able to support sustainable land-based
vehicular dredging activities.
''We therefore propose that all land-based fishing from or by means of
a vehicle be banned in all foreshores of Scotland.''
Studies show that stocks in November 1964 on Traigh Mhor were 1161
tonnes; in September 1972, 1057 tonnes; in August 1993, 929 tonnes; and
in March 1995, on Traigh Mhor and an adjacent beach, 257 tonnes.
The recent pressure on Scotland's cockle resources follows a ban on
cockling in the Solway Firth and and severe depletion of stocks in
England and the Low Countries. Prices for Scottish cockles have
therefore been pushed up, making exploitation much more profitable.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said that Mr Ian Lang, the
Secretary of State, had considered the option of using the Wildlife and
Countryside Act to control harvesting on Barra, but, on the advice of
SNH, had felt that provisions in fisheries legislation were more
appropriate.
''Section 29 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act was rejected as a
course of action, because it was felt this was not so much a nature
conservation problem as essentially one of conserving fishing stocks,''
he said.
The spokesman added the Wildlife and Countryside Act could have
''stopped everything in the area concerned'', whereas the main issue was
to try to stop over-fishing of cockles.
Under fisheries legislation, tractor dredging of cockles will be
banned before the end of July, if not earlier in the month, said the
Scottish Office. The current ban on cockling in the Solway will be
renewed at the end of July and Barra will be included when it is
enacted.
A spokesman for the North-west Region of SNH said that SNH was not
against the harvesting of cockles, so long as the resource was managed
sustainably.
Mr Dunion said that islanders feared that, at the rate the cockles
were being harvested, their eco-system would have sustained irrevocable
damage by the time the ban comes in.

A RAPIST who carried out a ''despicable and cowardly'' attack on a
deaf woman was jailed for eight years yesterday.
Unemployed Paul Stewart, 21, of no fixed address, admitted raping the
26-year-old woman on an industrial estate on January 6 this year.
Mr James Campbell, Advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh
that the woman, who is deaf and cannot speak, had met Stewart in an
Edinburgh nightclub.
She left with him when the club closed at 3am, taking with her a
bottle of champagne which she had bought earlier at an off-licence.
After they got out of a taxi, she became concerned about Stewart's
intentions when she was led to a part of Edinburgh she did not
recognise.
When they reached Broughton Market, a small industrial estate, Stewart
tripped her and pushed her to the ground. She struggled, but he lay on
top of her and raped her.
He then walked away, robbing her of the champagne and #17, leaving his
distressed victim lying on the ground.
She managed to flag down a passing taxi and was taken to a police
station where, with the help of sign language, she managed to give a
full account of her ordeal.
On the night of the rape, Stewart had been seen carrying the champagne
by two friends with whom he was sleeping rough. After reports of the
attack appeared in the press, they reported the matter to the police.
Mr Jack Davidson, defence counsel, said that his client was remorseful
and wished to apologise to his victim. He had befriended her in the club
and wrongly formed the impression that she had been willing to have
sexual contact with him.
Lord Milligan told Stewart that rape was rightly regarded as a serious
crime, and this case involved a particularly cowardly, despicable,
callous and violent attack.
Stewart shook his head in disbelief when he was led away to begin his
sentence.

Brussels,
JOHN MAJOR's determination to block any reduction in Britain's veto
power in the European Union was attacked last night by Mr Jacques
Santer, the President of the European Commission.
In a speech aimed at coaxing Britain back into the EU's political
mainstream, Mr Santer praised the UK's role in European affairs, but his
studied diplomacy was underscored by a series of hard arguments against
continued British resistance to further European integration.
In effect he called on the UK to abandon its opposition to expanding
majority voting in the Council of Ministers, thus reducing the scope for
a national veto. Mr Major has vowed to block any move in this direction
in advance of next year's inter-governmental review of the Maastricht
Treaty.
Addressing the Corporation of London, Mr Santer also signalled the
commission's desire to see Britain signing up for the controversial
Social Chapter of Maastricht from which the UK has an opt-out. He also
called on the UK to accept the inevitability of a single European
currency, citing the lead given by British businessmen who are mostly in
favour.
It was Mr Major who catapulted the former Luxembourg Prime Minister
into office by vetoing the proposed appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene,
the Belgian Premier, in succession to Mr Jacques Delors.
But any idea that Mr Santer is happy to be seen as Britain's stooge
disappeared with his comments, in which he repeatedly quoted Sir Winston
Churchill's pro-European sympathies.
Mr Santer turned on Mr Major's vow to protect British sovereignty by
blocking a reduction in the national veto. ''Since there are 15 member
states in the EU co-operating together a reduction is essential for
progress,'' he said.
''No member state can just expect to make hay in its favourite areas
and block everyone else in theirs because that leads to political
gridlock. Worse still, blocking in specific areas will mean the chances
of achieving one's own priorities may be much reduced. A policy of
give-and-take is required. It is not advisable to take up rigid
positions when the negotiating process in Brussels is a movable feast .
. .''
On the Maastricht Social Chapter, which Labour has vowed to support if
it forms the next UK government, Mr Santer said: ''Social solidarity is
also vital. I cannot accept a dual society in the EU with a
disadvantaged group in the gutter of poverty, with no hope, no
qualifications, no chance of finding work, often ill -- the cast-offs
from a civilised society. That is not what Europe is about and I will
not support any policy that leads in that direction.''
Mr Santer also spoke up for regionalism and subsidiarity, the
Euro-jargon for devolution. He obliquely challenged the UK Government's
insistence that devolution from Brussels stops in Whitehall and excludes
Scotland when he said there should be less action but better action in
governing Europe.
Mr Santer rounded on Brussels scare stories including the removal of
British red buses, harmonised Euro-rules for cricket, no more pints of
beer, prawn crisps, and the imposition of the square strawberry. ''We
have checked all these so-called stories (and stories is what most of
them are) and the vast majority are hearsay, rumour, or plain rubbish,''
he said.
William Russell writes: Foreign Office sources said last night that
overall the speech had been, from Britain's point of view, helpful.
There were areas of disagreement, such as the extension of majority
voting, but Mr Santer's views had been put in a moderate way which
invited debate. It was ''a pragmatic and sensible speech'' and its
moderate tone was helpful.
Mr Santer had recognised the role the United Kingdom had played in
shaping Europe's policies and his emphasis on subsidiarity was welcome,
the source added. So too was the emphasis on increasing competitiveness,
on keeping labour costs down, and the recognition of the need for policy
changes before enlargement.

A SENIOR Scottish Tory has joined the Prince of Wales in backing the
maker of the beleaguered Lanark Blue cheese.
The chairman of the Tory Reform Group, Mr Arthur Bell, who is now
being questioned by environmental health specialists for eating blue
cheese made by Mr Humphrey Errington on a television programme,
yesterday condemned Clydesdale District Council for wasting public money
pursuing ''a man who was only trying to create more jobs for the area''.
Prince Charles approached Mr Errington at the International Food and
Drink Exhibition in London last week and offered his sympathy.
Mr Errington said he had attended the fair to show that he was
standing firm in his dispute with Clydesdale's environmental health
department. It claims that his unpasteurised Lanark Blue cheese contains
listeria and is unfit for human consumption.
During the conversation, Mr Errington said the Prince, who is patron
of the Specialist Cheese Makers' Association, repeated several times:
''It must have been awful for you.''
Three years ago the Prince spoke out publicly in Paris against
''bacteriological police'' in the EU who, he claimed, were drawing up
hygiene standards which could end cheese-making by traditional methods.
Meanwhile, Mr Bell, who is head of the Scotland Direct gourmet food
business in Biggar, hit out at demands by Mr Bob Russell, Clydesdale's
environmental health director, that he explain the origins of a piece of
blue cheese he ate while taking part in a television news report.
Failure to reveal the origins, Mr Bell was told, could lead to legal
action.
In March, on the day that the district court ordered the cheese to be
destroyed, Mr Bell appeared on BBC's Reporting Scotland as a local
businessman who markets Lanark Blue surrounded by a variety of Scottish
cheeses. He ate a piece of blue cheese.
''It was not stated that I was eating Lanark Blue, nor was I eating
Lanark Blue. I was surrounded by Scottish cheeses and had a piece of
blue cheese which was made also by Mr Errington. I made no comment apart
from the word 'delicious','' said Mr Bell.
On Wednesday, Mr Bell received a second letter from the environmental
department asking: ''Was the cheese consumed by you in the televised
report Lanark Blue cheese? If so, where did you obtain the cheese? If
not, what cheese did you consume in the televised report, with the
inference that it was Lanark Blue?''
Mr Bell said: ''It is wrong that public money should be spent in this
way. It appears that council tax payers and business rate payers are
spending a lot of money pursuing Mr Errington, who is only trying to
create jobs.''
Mr Russell said: ''If that had been part of the cheese that had been
detained, Mr Bell was committing a criminal offence as the cheese posed
a public health risk. If Mr Bell had Lanark Blue cheese, was aware of
the hazard posed by it, and he had purchased that cheese, we wanted to
know where he purchased it in order to give that information to the
public health authority.''

IT was only a matter of time before this Government was blamed for the
air. The air quality was rotten, said Ms Diane Abbott (Hackney North --
Lab.), and Government policies were to blame.
Had Mr Michael Heseltine been Leader of the Commons, he might well
have claimed that the gloriously warm, sunny day outside was the
Government's doing and people voting in the English local elections
should remember that as they placed their cross. The more cautious Mr
Tony Newton succumbed to Ms Abbott and said the air quality ''was very
much an environmental priority for the Government''.
Mr Major's priority is beginning to look like survival. He sounded as
if he was eating his words of the day before in Londonderry when he told
MPs that he would think about whether to call off next week's talks with
Sinn Fein over the weekend, but that he rather thought he would decide
not to -- hardly a demonstration of clearcut leadership from a man whose
leadership is likely to be even more sceptically examined by his
colleagues after the election results.
Mr Blair returned to the review or reviews of the tax or taxes on
various forms of benefit or private insurance. The detail has become so
complex -- to everyone except the Chancellor -- that it is difficult to
assess what impact it is having on the public.
Labour hoped it had convinced most voters that Ministers planned to
tax just about every insurance pay-out anyone receives. The Tories must
have hoped that most voters were so confused that they had ceased to
take the matter into their consideration.
Mr Blair had a bit of fun about the Chancellor catching up with these
reviews by the Treasury -- of which he is the day-to-day boss -- after
everyone else had heard of them.
Mr Major, with a degree of brass neck which was almost laudable, said
that to him Mr Blair sounded ''a little desperate''.
To the rest of us, Mr Blair sounded as if he was having a jolly good
time as indeed he is -- victory on Clause 4 last Saturday, ''Government
in tax chaos'' headlines midweek, the local election results to savour
this weekend.
Mr Major said the Inland Revenue was perpetually answering queries
about who or what it was going to tax next, except that he said ''day
after day after day,'' a formula of which he is unfortunately fond.
Ministerial denials have now attained a rather splendid comprehensive
finality. They were not planning a tax; having reviewed the plans, they
have decided not to; the benefits under consideration have been taxed
back to the last century; there is no record of any tax being deducted
from these insurance payments. That seems to cover just about everything
and lacks only the virtue of coherence.
Mr Blair was not to be denied his soundbite. This was a policy which,
like so many others, he said, ''begins in incompetence, falls into
confusion and ends in chaos''.
An exasperated Prime Minister could only reply that there was nothing
to this issue when Mr Blair raised it on Tuesday, there was nothing in
it now, and it was just another example of ''Labour scaremongering for
cheap political gains.''
As the gains Mr Blair has in prospect look anything but cheap, he
could afford to smile.

THE Prime Minister and the Treasury sought yesterday to calm the row
over insurance cover for mortgage protection and those who have insured
their credit card and hire purchase repayments against sickness or job
loss.
In the Commons, there was an angry clash between Mr Major and Labour
leader Tony Blair after days of confusion in which the Government has
been accused of making policy on the hoof.
The Treasury said yesterday that the Inland Revenue was considering
whether pay-outs on insurance policies covering credit cards and other
household bills should be taxed under existing law, but said it had not
yet come to any final view.
Officials made clear it was not a question of a new tax being
introduced, but of whether existing tax law should be applied to
payments from these policies.
The announcement followed the political row this week when the
Government announced a U-turn on mortgage protection insurance and said
payments on these would be exempt from tax.
The Treasury said: ''There is no question, and never was any question,
of new taxes being introduced. The issue is whether payments under
certain insurance policies are taxable under existing law, which goes
back to the 19th century. Views on these kinds of issues are regularly
sought from and taken by the Inland Revenue in the normal course of
their business.''
Mr Major insisted at Question Time that there was no new intention to
levy taxes on policy payouts and accused the Labour leader of
''scaremongering for cheap political gain.''
However, with the political sensitivities of the local government
elections south of the Border in the background, Mr Blair accused the
Government of a ''pre-election panic attack,'' adding: ''It bears all
the hallmarks of your Government. It begins in incompetence, falls into
confusion and ends in chaos.''
Mr Blair said that at Question Time on Tuesday, Mr Major had said that
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke had conducted a review over many months into
the taxation of insurance payments and had removed any uncertainty.
Now, Mr Clarke had ''popped up and announced a new and different
review into part of the same problem.'' Mr Blair challenged Mr Major:
''Why did you not tell us about this other review on Tuesday?''
The Prime Minister retorted: ''I am afraid you are a little confused
and are seeking again to spread just a little despondency. There is no
new intention to levy taxes on the payments from certain insurance
policies.''
The question that had been raised by the insurance companies was
whether they were already taxable under existing tax laws which dated
back to the last century. Mr Major insisted: ''The Inland Revenue get
questions like this from the insurance and other industries on a routine
basis week after week.''
When the Inland Revenue had concluded its consideration of that it
would report to Ministers, and when the Government had that view, it
would consider whether the law had to be changed.
Downing Street said later that the matter had been discussed at
Cabinet yesterday, and officials rested firmly on the statement made by
the Prime Minister in the House. However, Opposition spokesmen were far
from satisfied.
The Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, Mr Malcolm Bruce, said:
''The Inland Revenue is sneaking in tax increases by the back door,
making a mockery of John Major's pretence of months of review.
''The sting in the tail of all this is not just about who in the
Government is in charge of tax policy, but that these increases come
hard on the heels of tax on insurance premiums. This is a tax on
insecurity -- the Government has created insecurity over employment and
housing and now is slapping tax on it.''

THE Prime Minister yesterday made clear that Minister-level talks with
Sinn Fein will go ahead as planned, despite the violence which marred
his visit to Londonderry on Wednesday.
However, Mr Major also accused Sinn Fein of intimidation and thuggery,
and pledged that next week's talks would be used to ''hold Sinn Fein's
feet to the fire'' over its commitment to peace.
The violence was proof that the ''mask has slipped'', he told MPs.
''I have no illusion about the nature of Sinn Fein or their spokesmen.
I think the behaviour of a few hundred of their supporters yesterday
showed how far they have yet to go before they become a democratic
party.
''In two hours yesterday, they destroyed the image they have been
seeking to build up over recent months,'' he said.
Minutes earlier, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams told a Westminster
news conference that he had no cause to apologise for the clashes
between his supporters and the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which left 12
policemen injured.
Instead, Mr Adams blamed the RUC. ''I think once again the RUC have
behaved in a disgraceful manner. There was no need for the violence
which they visited upon citizens making peaceful protests,'' he said.
Wednesday's events dominated Prime Minister's Questions yesterday.
Mr Major, visibly angry, said he would consider the implications of
the worst clashes in six months of ceasefire, but added that talks would
''probably'' go ahead in the interests of bringing Sinn Fein into the
democratic process.
However, he warned: ''Peaceful democratic parties don't act in the way
Sinn Fein supporters acted yesterday. They don't act as front
organisations for heavily armed paramilitaries. They don't intimidate
and threaten the population.
''They don't break the legs of teenagers with baseball bats. And they
don't behave in many of the thuggish ways that have occured.''
Getting rid of the IRA's arms would remain a priority. Pressure on
Sinn Fein to accept the obligations of peaceful democracy was in the
wider interests of the people of Northern Ireland.
He added: ''Now we have come this far, the wider interests of the
people of Northern Ireland should not be abandoned without holding Sinn
Fein's feet to the fire in face-to-face negotiations.''
Mr Adams was in London to launch his latest book. He had planned to
hold the launch at the Commons, but the event was banned by the Speaker.
Instead, he had to settle for a packed news conference.
On his way through Westminster Hall, he paused to admire the red
carpets and thrones laid on for today's VE commemorations, when the
Queen will address a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament.
He rejected suggestions that he sould apologise for events in
Londonderry. ''I have nothing to apologise for and no-one to apologise
to. British Ministers coming to my country need to be mindful that they
are in Ireland and that they are in a new situation. That new situation
needs all of us to look forward, to look to a new agenda.''
Mr Adams claimed that the RUC ''harassed and hassled'' demonstrators,
and that 20 civilians were hurt, including several prominent members of
Sinn Fein.
Talks with British Ministers should not be postponed any longer, he
said.
''It is ridiculous we have waited so long.''
* Sinn Fein is to hold an ''eve of talks'' march in Londonderry on
Tuesday night, the day before Government Minister Michael Ancram is due
to have his first meeting with the party.
Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness called on people in the city to support
the march, saying: ''The demonstration has been called to protest at the
British Government's attempts to treat our electorate as second-class
citizens.

<HEADLINE>Forces ban on homosexuals to stay</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>8</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978551080</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE ban on homosexuals in the armed forces will stay, the Government
insisted in the Commons last night.
Defence Procurement Minister Roger Freeman criticised Labour's plans
to review the issue and said homosexuals in the forces would undermine
order and discipline.
His comments came during a wide-ranging debate on the RAF.
Mr Freeman clashed with Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark over
Labour's plans to set up a commission to examine the ban.
He said: ''The MoD has long taken the view that homosexuality is not
compatible with securing the aims of the armed forces because it
undermines the order and discipline necessary for military
effectiveness.
''It is not a moral judgment but a practical assessment by those best
placed to make it, that is to say the military.''
To Tory cheers, he said homosexuals had to be excluded ''because of
the different and unique nature of Service life''. Service personnel had
to live and work in close proximity, often in single-sex accommodation
and under stress.
About 35% of new recruits were under 18. ''The Services have a
responsibility for the welfare and morale of their young recruits.
Parents as well as young people themselves trust the Services to look
after and safeguard them properly. We would be failing in our duty if we
did not do so.''
However, Dr Clark said it was a problem facing the British armed
forces and others around the world.
''Other countries have addressed this issue and have been able to
arrive at a constructive solution acceptable both to the armed forces
and society as a whole,'' he said.
Labour MP Harry Cohen (Leyton) said the armed forces in other
countries had homosexuals in their ranks without any problems.
''In this year of the 50th anniversary of the end of the last war, the
country was very happy to have very many people of homosexual
orientation fight for this country and lay down their lives . . . why do
you take this backward attitude now?''
Mr Freeman replied: ''I am not casting any aspersions on the valour of
Servicemen and women who may or may not have been homosexual in the
Second World War.
''It is the military judgment that homosexuals should not be retained
in the armed forces.''
Mr Bill Walker (Tayside North -- Con.) said that as a teenager he had
served in a remote part of the Middle East, living in a tent with
adults. He had been the youngest.
''It would have been totally unsuitable for any kind of situation with
a homosexual in these circumstances, particularly on active service.''
Winding up for Labour, Dr John Reid called for a review of whether
homosexuality should be allowed in the armed forces and claimed that
such a review was already taking place inside the Defence Ministry.
He told the House: ''It is sheer prejudice for Members on the other
side to pluck at primitive prejudices, because in this case it is
prejudice not patriotism that is the last refuge of scoundrels.''
Mr Freeman said that after the changes of recent years in the RAF,
there would now be a period of stability, but he confirmed future
redundancy plans as a result of restructuring.
The first phase of redundancies in 1995-6 would amount to 2100 people.
They would all be volunteers. However, he warned: ''We expect there will
have to be some compulsory redundancies in the second phase of some 6500
in 1996-97.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Menzies Campbell praised the RAF for its
heroics in war and professionalism in peacetime.
Mr Campbell added: ''But we have to look very carefully at the
question of overstretch to the RAF.
''There will be bases to be closed, there will be reductions in
personnel and some of that will not be fully implemented until the end
of the century.''
Mr Walker said he believed the search-and-rescue capability of the RAF
was being overstretched as a result of people climbing the Scottish
mountains.
He was happy Scotland had so many visitors, but the search- and-rescue
costs should not all fall on the RAF.

<TEXT>
A TORY MP fighting Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley's changes for
London hospitals warned yesterday that she could face a crushing defeat
in the Commons next week.
Sir John Gorst, Tory MP for Hendon North, one of Mrs Bottomley's
fiercest critics over the closures, pledged to vote with Labour in next
Wednesday's debate.
There were so many angry Tories that it was possible the Government's
slim majority would be overturned, he added.
Labour is planning to exploit Tory anger by using its Opposition
debate to force a vote on the cuts, which include closing 900-year-old
St Bartholomew's Hospital.
Sir John warned: ''I shall vote against the Government in respect of
the closure of Edgware General Hospital's accident and emergency
department.''
He said it would take just half-a-dozen rebels joining Labour in the
voting lobbies to defeat the Government.
''I'm assuming it will be possible to get that number either by voting
outright or by abstention,'' he said.
Sir Rhodes Boyson, Tory MP for Brent North, warned: ''If the
Government goes ahead and closes the accident and emergency department
of the Edgware General Hospital, the Government can no longer count on
my support in any vote on health in London.''
He added: ''I expect the Government to give in and make concessions.
This Government has got to listen to people if it is going to win the
next General Election.''

<HEADLINE>Lords to rule on row over council house sale</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978551082</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A COUPLE'S attempts over four years to buy the council house they have
lived in for 40 years are going to the House of Lords.
Ross and Cromarty District Council is ready to appeal to the Lords in
a bid finally to solve a ''legal loophole'' case, which has implications
for thousands of Scottish council tenants.
John and Rebecca Patience found out that the council could not sell
them their two-storey home in Avoch under the Government's ''right to
buy'' laws.
The reason was that the owner of the estate which originally sold the
land on which the Patiences' home is built was claiming feudal rights
over it.
Broadlands Properties, of Scarborough, Yorkshire, paid #7.1m in 1991
for the Rosehaugh Estate in the Black Isle.
The company demanded a four-figure sum from the council before it
would waive its ''right of pre-emption'' over the ground.
This would have allowed the council to sell the house to the couple.
However, the council refused to pay and went to the Court of Session
to resolve the anomaly.
Lord Marnoch found against the council last June and a subsequent
appeal earlier this year also failed.
Mr David Neill, the council's legal services director, yesterday
confirmed an appeal would be made to the House of Lords. This could cost
more than #10,000.
He said: ''If the decision by the Court of Session stands, then
tenants all over Scotland could be affected.''
The Scottish Office said yesterday its lawyers were still looking into
ways of settling the dispute.
But Mr Neill said that it was almost 10 years since the Scottish
Office found out about the problem, in another case brought to its
attention by his council.
In a letter dated May 1985, the Scottish Office told Ross and Cromarty
District: ''We are looking carefully at the possibility of including a
'for the avoidance of doubt' provision, with retrospective effect, in
the next Scottish Housing Bill, in order to clarify the position once
and for all.''
The case where feudal laws dating back to the Middle Ages override the
right to buy Act has also been raised by Mr John McAllion, Labour's
Scottish housing spokesman.
Mr McAllion, MP for Dundee East, said he had not yet received a
response to his question from Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the relevant
Minister.
Broadlands Estate is represented by Mr John MacLeod, of Snell and Co,
of George Street, Edinburgh.
He said yesterday: ''I have not yet been formally told by the council
that it intends to appeal to the House of Lords.'' He would make no
further comment.

THE Nolan committee, charged by the Prime Minister to recommend new
rules of conduct for Ministers and politicians, is expected to report
next Thursday.
Mr Major set up the committee to try to bring an end to the ''sleaze
factor'' in British politics.
A succession of scandals has plagued the Government, most recently the
suspension of two Tory back benchers embroiled in the cash-for-questions
accusations.
The report is expected to recommend that Ministers should be subject
to the same rules as civil servants over lucrative jobs in the private
sector after they have left office.

Has an industry been sacrificed on the altar of tax cuts? Businessmen
and
workers give their verdict.
THE deed is done. The Cabinet sceptics have been silenced. If
Ministers get their way, the UK's civil nuclear power industry will be
privatised as a single merged company by next summer, the process
sweetened by promises of a Scottish HQ for the holding company and bill
rebates for electricity customers north and south of the Border.
Despite some valiant lobbying by Scottish Nuclear, its independence is
to go, sacrificed -- like any pretence that this will add to competitive
forces in the UK electricity supply industry -- to the tottering Major
Government's need to find quick money for tax cuts before the next
election.
I have said before that this has been a tawdry exercise. It reached
new depths yesterday when harassed and concerned officials at Scottish
Nuclear's East Kilbride headquarters had to feed staff unconfirmed media
reports of what is to befall them, because lobby journalists were better
briefed on what the Government intends than the people who may lose
their jobs to make the sale stack up.
In meetings in London, chairman James Hann and Dr Robin Jeffrey, chief
executive, were told to make no statements, either internally to their
staff or to the outside world, before next Tuesday's publication of the
White Paper setting out the sale plans in detail.
That gag is presumably designed to allow the Prime Minister,
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, and assorted
other Ministers to make their way to the Scottish Tory Party conference
in Glasgow next week and put the best gloss they can on the deal.
Perhaps they could use the planned Scottish Nuclear-sponsored evening
reception to reassure worried SN workers about their futures.
Scottish Office sources insist that Mr Lang is well aware of all the
alarming precedents that promises of corporate headquarters bring to
Scottish minds. This will not be a brass plate job, we are assured. No
rerun of Guinness or TSB. Real jobs will move north.
Arrangements have been made to anchor the structure to that Scottish
commitment, we are told, although no-one is prepared to put a time-scale
on how long that anchor will hold.
That leaves some very big questions unanswered. If the nuclear
generating side of electricity supply was deemed unsellable in 1989,
won't investors demand a lot of convincing now that every excess jot and
comma of cost has been stripped out of the merged business before they
will buy? And doesn't a structure consisting of a small holding company
HQ and two parallel operating subsidiaries, along the lines of the
present Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric, each with its own
administration, imply exactly that -- excess cost?
Name me one recent merger in private sector, Mr Lang, where
rationalisation, consolidation, and some surgery on jobs have not
inevitably followed the marriage. We must await the White Paper. But it
is hard to see how the Government can insist on this holding company
structure in perpetuity without damaging the merged company's appeal to
investors.
With the Scottish Nuclear bosses gagged, Whitehall has been furiously
lobbying to the effect that Scottish Nuclear was too small to be
privatised on its own, that one of its two stations, Hunterston, has
only 20 years life left in it and that, once privatised on its own, it
would be an obvious target for predators.
It was even being suggested yesterday that the unaudited results
issued last week, showing a #31m profit last year, after all subsidies
were stripped out, would not look so good when they auditors had
finished with them.
That, The Herald understands, is a complete falsehood. The latest
Scottish Nuclear adverts did not mention the word ''unaudited''
apparently because the figures are now regarded as robust. That rather
dents the Government line.
If the industry is to be privatised at all, in an age when many
companies with fewer assets and much less profit-making potential are
finding their way to a Stock Market listing, it is diffult to find any
substantial reason against a separate privatisation for Scottish Nuclear
other than the Government's need to see the job done quickly and avoid
any regulatory hiccups which might knock the timetable off course.
The contrary argument needs to be put and answered. Scottish Nuclear
has been, by far, the more pro-active of the two companies in dealing
with the issue of reprocessing of spent fuel. It threatened to build dry
stores at its two stations as an alternative to paying British Nuclear
Fuel's exorbitant reprocessing charges. That triggered a capitulation by
BNFL and the offer of a much lower cost contract, which Nuclear Electric
then coat-tailed on.
When you consider the current problems with cracking at Nuclear
Electric's Dungeness and Heysham 1 stations, and earlier problems
getting Hartlepool and Dungeness into production at all, over the long
term the Scottish nuclear utility has been, by far, the more successful
of the two companies in running AGR stations.
Apart from the sea water ingress incident at Hunterston in the
mid-seventies, power station performance has shown consistent
improvement under both the old SSEB and Scottish Nuclear.
But the merger plan snuffs out all that competitive tension. It
creates yet another large UK generator in an industry which, arguably,
needs more, not less, competition among generators. If that was not so,
why are both PowerGen and National Power under orders from the regulator
to sell off some of their middle ranking capacity this year?
The nuclear review ought to have been a rational debate about the
future of nuclear power in this country. Instead it has turned into a
dash for cash for political ends. Competition considerations have been
dumped. The old Magnox stations and the unquantified bill for
decommissioning them is to stay with the long-suffering taxpayer. And a
thriving independent Scottish company is to lose its independence to
squeeze the timetable in before the next election.
There may be a few people sitting behind the promised brass plate
headquarters. But this still looks and smells like a short-sighted
political con.

NEWS of the Government's merger proposals for Scottish Nuclear were
met with scepticism, disappointment, and anger by many of the 380
employees as they left the company's East Kilbride headquarters last
night.
They failed to be convinced by promises that the corporate
headquarters following any merger would be established in Scotland or
that their jobs would be secure, citing scenarios that had gone before
at Britoil and Distillers and Government guarantees given over
Ravenscraig and Rosyth.
Concern was expressed that the corporate headquarters may only remain
in Scotland for 18 months to two years following the decision and that
the operation would be transferred to England once a rationalisation of
a proposed British Nuclear was complete.
A Scottish Nuclear spokeswoman said yesterday the company had been
advised by the Government not to comment on any decision until the
formal announcement which is expected on Tuesday.
Although workers at Scottish Nuclear's East Kilbride headquarters and
its nuclear power stations at Hunterston and Torness had still to be
formally advised of any decision last night, Scottish Nuclear Workers'
Campaign members from the three operations have already pledged to
continue their fight to oppose the merger and privatisation.
Campaign member, Mr Stephen Hinde, 27, said: ''Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang says he is happy at the decision but he has given no guarantees
over the future of almost 400 jobs at East Kilbride and 1300 at
Hunterston and Torness.
''The workforce is angry and feels betrayed by the Government.''
Mr Hinde, whose wife Angela, 24, also works for Scottish Nuclear,
pointed out that up to 200 jobs could go at the Scottish nuclear power
stations, if the same policy was applied as in stations operated south
of the Border by Nuclear Electric.
He added: ''We have ruled out strike action because of the nature of
the business. We have had great support from the general public and MPs,
including some Tories, and hope they can carry the fight to Parliament
and force a vote on the issue.''
Mr Eric Tottman-Trayner, 48, a principal engineer in fuel design with
Scottish Nuclear, said of the merger plans: ''It is difficult to trust
the Government after what happened with Britoil and Distillers.
''It really depends on whether their promises are going to be taken on
by the new owners, whoever they may be, and whether privatisation
guarantees the promises made.
''The corporate headquarters in Scotland could be a caravan in
Edinburgh which slowly moves down the A1. Within five years it may be
nowhere to be seen.''
Mr Tottman-Trayner, who has worked for 32 years in the electricity
supply industry, added: ''It has been impossible to find a political
commentator or an expert within the industry who thought the
Government's plan for the merger and privatisation was a good idea.
Almost everyone agrees it has been a hasty decision.''
Mr Brian Bruce, 37, a project accountant, who has been employed with
Scottish Nuclear for the past 21 years, said any promise that there
would be no job losses should be ''taken with a pinch of salt'' after
''similar scenarios'' at Rosyth and Ravenscraig.
''It may well be that the corporate headquarters will be in Scotland.
But for how long? I can't see how any new organisation would have two
corporate offices.''
He argued that the announcement amounted to ''a stay of execution''
and that the future of the East Kilbride operation had to be regarded as
bleak.
''It has been job losses all the way since the rest of the electricity
industry was privatised in 1990. I don't think this privatisation will
be any different.''
Mrs Angela Boslam, 27, a treasury officer, and her husband Stuart, 31,
a clerical assistant, both work at the East Kilbride headquarters.
Mrs Boslam said: ''Historically Britoil, BP, and Guinness, have all
said they would have head offices in Scotland. But these were slowly
eroded away and moved down south.''
Her views were supported by Mrs Gillian Paris, 27, a finance
department employee, who said: ''We will be living on borrowed time if
this merger proceeds.''
Mr Ken Gorman, 42, an engineer at the East Kilbride headquarters, said
there was ''real concern'' among the employees about their long-term
future despite assurances given by Mr Lang.
Mr Gorman said: ''No-one here has any confidence whatsoever in
assurances Mr Lang gives after what happened at Ravenscraig and
Rosyth.''
Information systems department employee, Mr David Slater, 42, who has
worked for SSEB and Scottish Nuclear for 20 years, also highlighted the
''poor track record'' of the Government after promises were broken
following privatisations at Britoil and Distillers.
He said: ''The fact is that once the company is privatised the
Government will have no say what happens''.
Mr Ian Donnellan, 42, employed in electronic control design, said the
mood among staff was ''very guarded and not very optimistic''. He
believed many employees were ''very doubtful'' about the long-term
prospects of the Scottish operation.

THE Cabinet decision met with blanket hostility from leading players
in the Scottish business community last night.
Sir Donald Miller, the former chairman of ScottishPower, who has been
openly critical of the proposal for a merger, said last night: ''It's
obvious that people in Westminster do not appreciate the depth of
feeling in Scotland about this. They either don't know or they don't
care.''
Responding to Mr Lang's claimed victory in achieving a Scottish
headquarters for the merged company, Sir Donald said: ''That's a strange
victory: 20 jobs, against the loss of 500.
''It is clear that this is a sop; something nobody will take at face
value for one minute.''
Mr Hamish Morrison, chief executive of the Scottish Council
Development and Industry, last night repeated his condemnation of the
move.
Earlier, he had written to Mr Lang and the Department of Trade and
Industry, saying: ''The familiar experience of post-merger
rationalisation would decimate this important centre of scientific and
technical excellence to the great disadvantage of graduate employment in
Scotland.
''In both operations and innovation, the company compares very
favourably with its southern neighbour. It would be immensely damaging
to the development prospects of Britain's nuclear industry if this
competition through emulation was to be lost.''
Scottish Engineering had said it would be ''appalled'' at a merger
decision, which would represent a ''hijack'' of a Scottish
high-technology engineering institution, and ''a criminal loss''.
Chief executive Howard Jordan said, in a letter to The Herald, that a
merger would involve an emasculation of Scottish Nuclear.
However, last night he said his opinion would be slightly more
positive if the Government insisted that corporate headquarters, with
the full range of senior staff, was located in Scotland.

REPORTS that Scottish Secretary Ian Lang is fighting pressure from
Cabinet colleagues to cap spending by Strathclyde region have sparked
suspicion that a situation is being contrived to give him a ''victory''
prior to the Scottish Conservative Party conference and the Perth and
Kinross by-election.
The alleged Cabinet row is over Strathclyde region breaching the
revenue-capping level by #34m, with the council using the accountancy
device of absorbing this sum in its capital budget.
Although this procedure has still to be approved by the Secretary of
State, it is understood that Environment Secretary John Gummer, who is
responsible for English local government, and Mr Jonathan Aitken, Chief
Secretary to the Treasury, have argued that it would be wrong for
Strathclyde to escape when eight English councils face capping.
Strathclyde has already threatened legal action against the Secretary
of State if he forces the council to meet #107m of cuts solely from
revenue -- a move that could involve 5000 compulsory redundancies.
But the row story was being greeted with some scepticism yesterday at
Strathclyde House. Councillor John Mullin, finance chairman, said: ''I
have no doubt that the story has come from sources close to Ian Lang.
''I think Mr Lang is long overdue a victory. If you have a look at
other issues affecting Scotland in which he has intervened he has lost
hands down on every occasion.''
Earlier this year Strathclyde region imposed a 13% council and water
tax increase after being instructed by the Government to make savings of
#107m.
Instead it made savings of #73m at a cost of 1000 job losses -- mainly
through non-filling of temporary contracts -- and transferred the
remaining #34m revenue expenditure into its capital budget, thereby
preserving core services.
It also stated that should the transfer be blocked by the Secretary of
State the council would challenge him by seeking a judicial review in
the Court of Session.
A Scottish Office spokesman said the Secretary of State had still to
make a decision on Strathclyde's budget proposals.

THE Tories looked set for electoral catastrophe last night as they
felt the full force of voters' anger in England and Wales. The results
are almost certain to renew speculation about Mr Major's leadership.
One Labour insider said the Conservatives looked ''on the verge of
meltdown''.
Early indications were that the Tories would lose more than 1500
seats, with some predictions of enormous losses in excess of 2000.
It appeared their share of the national vote could slump to 26% -- a
record election low -- compared with 47% for Labour and 23% for the
Liberal Democrats.
The BBC said Labour, with its estimated 47% of the vote, was heading
for its best performance in more than 30 years.
The Tories were losing seats all over the country. Early figures
suggested that roughly two-thirds of all Conservative-defended seats
were falling to Labour or Liberal Democrats.
Almost 29,000 candidates were contesting about 12,000 seats in England
and Wales.
Jubilant deputy Labour leader John Prescott told BBC TV: ''It is going
to be a record night for Labour, a very good night indeed. All our
results show we are taking seats from the Tories and the Liberals.''
Environment minister David Curry admitted it was a bad night for the
Government, but moved quickly to dismiss talk of a crisis or threat to
Mr Major's position.
''I think especially in shire England where these elections are
concentrated, people are still not feeling the confidence in the
recovery and they are taking it out on the Conservatives,'' he said.
''I don't think that the Prime Minister is under threat as a result of
this.''
Labour leader Tony Blair said the electorate appeared to be turning to
his party.
''I think it indicates that people are not just voting against the
Conservative Party, they are voting for the Labour Party,'' he said.
''It is looking extremely good.''
Environment Secretary John Gummer, however, suggested that many Tory
voters were simply staying at home rather than defecting to Labour.
''The signs are that it is not true they are voting for the new Labour
Party,'' he said.
The Government had been prepared for a bad result, he said, adding:
''People are still feeling the cost of higher taxes and the like so I am
not surprised.''
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said it was a ''very good
night'' which had allowed his party to reinforce its grip in areas where
the Tories had to be beaten.
''If you look at tonight as the major electoral test before the next
election, this is not mid-term, it is very near the end of the term of
this Government. Then you begin to define the battleground for the next
election.
''You begin to see the Liberal Democrats have a very important role in
challenging the Tories where they must be beaten, and in becoming
increasingly, in the northern cities of Britain, the alternative to
Labour where they have governed badly.''
The results are devastating for the Tories as a party of local
government as well as the Conservative Party at Westminster.
Labour's record in any election was 49.4% of the national vote in 1951
under Clement Attlee, according to the BBC.

THE race to take over the commercial assets of Rosyth naval base saw a
new entrant last night, with Clydeport revealed as one of the potential
bidders.
With today the deadline, around 40 companies have expressed interest
for the 355-acre base which is expected to realise #15m when sold in
April next year.
Rumours of a pitch by Clydeport, the former Clyde Port Authority which
was privatised amidst much controversy, have been circulating for some
time. Officials have made a number of visits to the site.
Acquiring Rosyth would secure it a much-desired outlet on the east
coast, establishing a truly national hegemony in Scotland's port and
shipping industry.
The Clydeport managing director, Mr David Hunt, said last night:
''Opportunities in this sector are very limited and we are therefore
interested in any suitable opportunities which arise. We will obviously
be having further discussions with our advisers prior to the closing
date for final offers.''
The sale has also attracted foreign interest, from India, China, Saudi
Arabia, and two firms from the US.
Strong domestic bidding is likely to come from five UK construction
firms, including the Edinburgh-based Miller Group; Associated British
Ports; and Rosyth 2000, a consortium made up of the Bank of Scotland,
Forth Ports plc, Scottish Power, and Babcock International, operators of
the adjacent dockyard.
Babcock is also involved in separate negotiations for the dockyard but
the Rosyth 2000 proposal includes a plan to buy it and lease it back to
Babcock.
All noted interests now have until May 31 to make formal bids.
Property consultants Ryden, selling agents for the Ministry of Defence,
expect the 40-strong list to be whittled down to around half a dozen
consortia.
Mr Roy Durie, Ryden's managing partner in Edinburgh, said: ''We have
been pushing it around the world, but the level of interest has been
quite surprising.
''It is a very important site which is of international interest. It
has flat level access and more depth and frontage than, for example, the
shipyard at St Petersburg.''
Mr Durie said the site could still play an important part in the Fife
economy, depending on the ultimate purchaser. Used simply as a storage
facility, it would mean around 1000 jobs rising to 3000 or more if its
full potential was used.
As well as various berths, one million square feet of accommodation
and huge fuel tanks, the sale includes the base commander's mansion, two
historic buildings (Rosyth Castle and a dovecot), an internal railway
and a 76-acre marsh, due to be declared a site of special scientific
interest.
The Royal Navy will retain a presence at Rosyth at HMS Caledonian to
the north-west of the base as a support facility and a stores depot
within the site.

THE former chairman of a crime prevention panel had a blue-flashing
light, two-tone horns, and police-style baton in his car when challenged
by two officers, Kilmarnock Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
The court heard that James Brown had also fitted a siren to his car
and that when charged with a variety of offences relating to the
discovery replied: ''I am sorry, I didn't know it was illegal to have
them.''
The court heard that two traffic police officers were on patrol in the
centre of Kilmarnock when they noticed a blue lamp in the back of a
Daihatsu car parked in Grange Street.
Constable Ronald Hamilton, 35, said that he and his colleague decided
to stop and investigate further and as they looked in the car they were
approached by Brown who told them it was his car.
PC Hamilton told the depute procurator-fiscal, Mrs Norma Clarkson,
that on examining the car they found that a cable led from the blue lamp
between the front seats and into the front passenger footwell.
PC Hamilton added: ''I plugged the light in to the cigarette lighter
and nothing happened. Then I switched on the ignition and a siren began
to sound. Then the blue light did, in fact, begin to work.
''I took the man over to the police vehicle to caution him, then when
we returned to his car we found a wooden baton.''
Brown, 54, of Brown Avenue, Troon, faced one charge of possessing an
offensive weapon and two charges under vehicle lighting and construction
regulations. He admitted a third similar charge relating to the fitting
of two-tone horns.
PC Hamilton said that Brown told him that the baton, which bore a
picture and the word Mallorca on it, had been rolling around in the boot
and he had moved it.
The policeman said: ''He said that both the klaxons and the siren were
anti-theft devices.''
Brown told the court that he had gone to visit a public house that
evening and as far as he was aware the blue light had been on the floor
of the car. He said: ''One of the people in the car must have put it on
the back parcel shelf.''
He added that he had retired from his job as a motor mechanic and
auto-electrician through ill-health and that the blue lamp, which he
said was over 20 years old and to his knowledge did not work, was a
memento of his days as a retained firefighter.
Asked where he had got the baton, Brown said: ''I got it in Santa
Ponsa. It was a souvenir and I did not intend it to do any harm to
anyone. I was showing it to some people then planned to display it at
home . . . I fitted the siren and horns as anti-theft devices as there
had been a lot of thefts in the Troon area.''
Mrs Clarkson asked Brown if both the baton and lamp were souvenirs and
he said they were. She added: ''You had quite a treasure trove of
souvenirs in your car. Do you not think it a bit unusual to keep all
these souvenirs in your care?'' He replied: ''Not really.''
Sheriff Charles McFarlane fined Brown #75 for possessing an offensive
weapon and #50 on each of the three charges relating to the lamp, siren,
and two-tone horns.
As he left the court Brown said: ''I am angry and disappointed that a
system which I served loyally for 20 years should turn against me in
this way. I am a highly respected member of the community and served as
a fireman as well as helping the police in the recovery of damaged
vehicles.''
He said that he had resigned from his post as chairman of Kyle and
Carrick crime prevention panel because the charges were hanging over him
and he did not feel able to continue in the post.

SENIOR Scottish Tories were last night defiantly bullish about the
prospects for the nuclear industry north of the Border.
Party chairman Sir Michael Hirst claimed Mr Lang had shown he could
''pack a punch'' in Cabinet, and suggested that his ''victory'' could be
a significant industrial gain for Scotland.
Closer to the Tory grassroots, however, there were clear signs that
yesterday's decision was not universally popular among a party still
struggling to come to terms with last month's mauling in the council
elections.
A number of Conservatives pointed out that Mr Lang's victory could
become pyrrhic if, after privatisation, the merged company's
headquarters are moved out of Scotland.
Sir Michael said: ''I'm absolutely delighted to hear that Ian Lang has
succeeded in persuading his Cabinet colleagues that the merged company
should be headquartered in Scotland.
''It's a feather in his cap, and shows that he can pack a punch when
it is needed.
''I very much hope there will be appropriate guarantees given to
ensure the headquarters stay here. If so, it may be that Scotland has
won something very significant.
''I think this will be widely welcomed, not only in the Conservative
Party, but in Scotland as a whole.''
However, Mr Struan Stevenson, Conservative prospective parliamentary
candidate for Dumfries, said: ''If someone can persuade me that Scottish
Nuclear has taken over Nuclear Electric, then I would welcome it, but I
would require more convincing of that.
''I think Mr Lang has achieved an astonishing victory, but I trust it
is not a pyrrhic victory. I would want to see guarantees that are, in
nuclear jargon, lead-encased. . . we don't want to go down the Guinness
and Britoil road again.''
Mr Stevenson suggested that Scottish Nuclear chairman James Hann
should be appointed to head the merged company, but he accepted that
would not ensure a Scottish base once the company is privatised.
Even more sceptical was Dr Ian Birss, chairman of the Cunninghame
North constituency association, which takes in Hunterston, who is also
chairman of the West of Scotland branch of the party.
He said he found news of the merger ''very disappointing'', adding:
''Scottish Nuclear could have survived very well on its own, and would
have continued to be something to be proud of as a Scottish company. The
merger is quite unnecessary.
''There will have to be cast-iron guarantees to ensure the
headquarters is kept in Scotland: but quite how you do that to a private
company, I don't know.''
Mrs Esther Kay, chairman of the East Kilbride association, said: ''I
would have very much preferred that Scottish Nuclear was privatised in
its own right.
''However, I am delighted that the headquarters will be in Scotland,
and hopefully in East Kilbride, and that they will be the corporate
headquarters -- not just a branch office of the main company.''
Miss Kathryn Smith, Conservative constituency chairman in East
Lothian, which covers the Torness plant, said: ''I really couldn't
comment; I would have to read up about it. There has been so much
rumour-mongering, so I will wait until I read something official and
then make up my mind.''

JUST 22 words penned under the gaze of Sir Winston Churchill by
candidate John Godfrey in his office at Perth and Kinross Tory
headquarters -- an old military bunker in a forest clearing north-west
of the city -- wrecked the launch of his by-election campaign yesterday.
The Conservatives started the day by being plunged into accusations
that they had smeared the SNP as Nazis and of hijacking VE-Day to their
political cause, and ended it with Scottish Secretary Ian Lang rejecting
calls from rival politicians for an apology -- all because of a
reference in an election leaflet: ''Fifty years ago we fought
nationalism in Europe, and today in Bosnia it still destroys lives. We
don't need it here too.''
It produced the worst possible start to the Tory campaign, with
references to their bunker mentality no longer a joke.
SNP outrage at the slur was shared by other party leaders and
candidates.
But Mr Lang was dismissive of the suggestion that he should apologise.
He said: ''Clearly what John Godfrey was referring to was that
nationalism is a destructive force. The SNP's ambition is to break up
the United Kingdom, and we are quite right to oppose that. There is
nothing to apologise for.''
The most emotive reaction came from the SNP candidate, Roseanna
Cunningham, who said: ''My father, who died a little over a year ago,
spent six years fighting in the Second World War. He voted SNP before he
died.
''In the six years he spent in the war, as far as he was concerned, he
was fighting for democracy, he was fighting for liberty, and he was
fighting for the rights of small nations to self-determination. There
are thousands of people in Scotland today who vote SNP who fought in the
Second World War, or have subsequently been in the uniform of one of the
British forces.
''Not just me, but these people will be heartily offended by the
suggestion that somehow they have become -- well, what is he calling
them, Nazis? It is an insult to people's own freedom to choose in their
own political democracy what they wish to vote for and it is an insult
to people who fought in the war to use them in this way.''
Mr Godfrey, who wrote the leaflet himself, immediately rejected
criticism. ''No, I don't think it is remotely unfair,'' he told a
suddenly hostile press conference.
He was backed by Sir Michael Hirst, Scottish party chairman, who said
he was confident that the leaflet was correct and fair. His own speech,
prepared for this first press conference of the by-election, appeared to
harness current celebrations of the end of the war to the Tory cause and
hint at a linkage between Scottish nationalism and the German variety
under Hitler. He said: ''As we are approaching the historic fiftieth
anniversary of VE-Day, we should reflect on the importance of the United
Kingdom at that time in world history.
''Had the country been fragmented into its constituent parts, would we
have been able to make such an effective stance against the menace of
extreme German nationalism?''
But Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, said that if a politician with
Sir Michael's experience didn't see that it was wrong for a party to
hijack an event of national celebration as a vehicle for political
propaganda, it was a lesson they would teach him during the campaign.
The convener of the new Perth and Kinross single-tier authority,
ex-marine commando John Culliven, has written to Ian Lang in the wake of
the row over the leaflet.
A parade in Perth a week tomorrow will will be attended by people from
all walks of Scottish life and representatives of all political parties.
Councillor Culliven said: ''These commemorations should embrace
everyone in Scotland. They must not be debased by partisan politics, and
I am horrified that senior members of your party have chosen to take
that route. Everyone in Scotland now seeks an assurance from you that
Sir Michael Hirst and John Godfrey were speaking out of turn.''
Meanwhile, Labour was accused last night of using bogus statistics to
bolster its standing in the Perth and Kinross by-election.
SNP chief executive Michael Russell has written to Labour calling on
it to withdraw the figures it has been publicising about the results in
last month's unitary elections in the 20 wards that make up the
parliamentary constituency.
His concern is shared by the Scottish Liberal Democrats, whose
breakdown produces the same results as the SNP analysis.
Both parties believe that last month's result across the constituency
translates as SNP on 36.6%, Tories 22.6%, Labour 19.9%, LibDem 13.8%,
and others 7.1%. Labour, however, have been suggesting figures of SNP
32.9%, Tories 21.3%, Labour 20.6%, LibDem 14.1%, and others 11.2%.
The key effect has been to narrow the gap which Labour would have to
make up.
Mr McConnell hit back last night saying that this was not just simply
by-election knockabout but evidence of the SNP running scared.
''Our figures are an in-depth and weighted analysis,'' he said. ''We
stand by them solidly.''

<TEXT>
AN advocate yesterday told a court that Edinburgh District Council had
ignored evidence that a sauna would be used as a brothel.
Mr Andrew Hajducki, QC, represents Mrs Debra Scanlan, 29, who has
objected to the council's decision to grant the Gemini Sauna in Iona
Street, Edinburgh, an entertainments licence.
Mrs Scanlan, a mother-of-two, was one of a number of objectors when
the council's licensing committee approved the sauna, which is owned by
Mr Ian Haig, 52. The sauna is near her Buchanan Street home.
Mr Haig's application stated that the sauna would be used for
reflexology, massage, and aromatherapy and would have a TV lounge and
steam room.
Mr Hajducki asked Sheriff Nigel Thomson to overturn the council's
decision on the grounds that it had acted beyond its powers in granting
a licence to premises which, it could be inferred, would be used as a
brothel.
''There was evidence before the committee; the evidence suggested that
the premises would prospectively be used as a place of prostitution,''
said Mr Hajducki.
He pointed out that letters lodged in support of Mr Haig's application
to the council referred to such matters as lowering the risk of disease,
reducing kerb-crawling, and better discretion for clients.
''They don't seem to say that we need this sauna because we need more
aromatherapy,'' said Sheriff Thomson.
Mr Hajducki also referred to a newspaper article in which it was
claimed that a reporter was offered full sex for #35 by a woman at
another sauna previously run by Mr Haig.
Mr Gordon Steele, advocate for the council, said that although the
police had been consulted and a police representative was at the meeting
there was no objection from the chief constable to the proposed use of
the building.
He said that as far as the other sauna was concerned, it would have
been up to the police to investigate if there had been any criminal
activity going on.
Mr Steele said that committee members were ''undoubtedly correct and
reasonable in the way they approached this matter''.
Mr Haig's advocate, Mr John Baird, said that the licensing board had
not met to hold a public forum on prostitution.
''It was fulfilling its statutory duty to consider a number of
applications,'' he said.
Sheriff Thomson will give his decision in writing later.

<TEXT>
THE UK Atomic Energy Authority at Dounreay is investigating an
incident involving the release of plutonium dust, it was revealved
yesterday.
Two workers at Dounreay are being monitored to find out if they have
been contaminated following the leak last Friday.
A spokesman for the plant yesterday confirmed that the dust material
had escaped into the working area of a reprocessing building.
The leak comes 10 weeks after another building was shut down, when
three workers were contaminated, after a filter on a glove-box failed.
It prompted a leading anti-nuclear campaigner to call for an immediate
end to reprocessing. ''It is a dangerous, unnecessary trade which is
putting the lives of workers and the public at risk,'' said Mrs Lorraine
Mann, of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping.
On that occasion 20 million bequerels of plutonium dust leaked into
the atmosphere -- as much as is normally discharged from Dounreay in six
months.
Mr Ian Shepherd, a spokesman for Dounreay, said that the latest
incident occurred during a routine maintenance operation on a glove-box.
He said: ''In the course of this, as is the usual practice, the
operators were wearing the normal protective suits.
''There was a release of plutonium dust into the working area. It was
a very small quantity and it was contained within the building.''
It is understood that radiation alarms sounded as an operator was
changing a glove in a remote-control glove-box.
Mr Shepherd described the incident as minor and said an internal
investigation was under way to establish how it occurred.
However, it will be a number of weeks before the two workers find out
whether they have been contaminated.
The incident occurred just days after Mr John Baxter, the director of
the plant, assured the Dounreay Local Liaison Committee that the plant
had tightened up its handling of the material.
Mrs Mann said: ''They cannot be allowed to continue doing this. It's
obvious corners are being cut on safety.
''We've had assurance after assurance but these incidents keep
happening. It's totally unacceptable.''

FIFTEEN RUC officers were injured last night when violence broke out
following a VE Day commemoration parade by the loyalist Orange Order in
Belfast.
Crowds of march followers turned on the RUC as Orangemen paraded back
to east Belfast from a City Hall rally.
Bricks, bottles and builders' rubble were hurled at police guarding a
nationalist area, the Short Strand at the bottom of the Newtownards
Road.
The violence spread along the staunchly-loyalist Newtownards Road to
Dee Street where five petrol bombs were thrown, said an RUC spokesman.
At least eight people were arrested, one for looting. An off-licence
was believed to have been broken into.
A bus was hi-jacked and its driver ordered out.
The trouble, worse than that in Londonderry little more than 24 hours
earlier, was condemned by the Assistant Chief Constable for Belfast, Mr
Bill Stewart, who said it was ''regrettable that the dignity of the
occasion had been marred by trouble makers''.
Police said that at the height of the trouble 200 rioters were
involved.
The VE Day commemoration at City Hall in the centre of Belfast had
been attended by thousands of Orangemen and followers and passed off
without incident.
However, one group of 400 marchers was prevented from reaching the
rally by nationalists who blocked the Ormeau Road to them. With police
keeping the two sides apart the Orangemen held the religious service on
a bridge over the River Lagan and threw a wreath into the waters below
before marching away.
It was the third march in the area to have been halted in as many
weeks. Residents of the Lower Ormeau Road, where loyalist gunmen shot
dead five Roman Catholics in a bookmakers shop a number of years ago,
have demanded Orange parades be halted or re-routed away from them.
Leading republicans have been seen among their numbers in recent weeks
as they have stepped up their campaign.

SCOTTISH Nuclear has lost its fight to remain independent when the
industry is privatised next year.
At a meeting of the Cabinet yesterday, Ministers decided to proceed
with the sale but rejected arguments that the two companies should be
sold separately and opted instead for a merger of the East Kilbride
based operation with its English counterpart, Nuclear Electric.
The plan includes the formation of a holding company, based in
Scotland, allowing the two existing companies to continue to operate as
separate entities. Agreement to this would mean a small number of HQ
jobs, perhaps 20, moving from England to Scotland.
Although no firm details have emerged, Government sources
characterised the outcome as a victory for Scottish Secretary Ian Lang,
who was said to have argued in committee against a complete takeover by
the English company.
This view was disputed by members of all political parties in
Scotland, including his own. Dr Ian Birss, chairman of the Cunninghame
North Tory constituency association, which takes in Hunterston, who is
also chairman of the West of Scotland branch of the party, said it was
''very disappointing'', adding that ''the merger is quite unnecessary''.
The notion of a meaningful success was roundly rejected by the
business community. One leading industrialist, Sir Donald Miller, the
former chairman of ScottishPower, described the Scottish HQ as ''a
sop''.
The opinion of executives at Scottish Nuclear, including chief
executive Dr Robin Jeffrey, must remain a matter of conjecture. They
were instructed by the Government to make no comment, even to members of
their own staff, in advance of the publication of a White Paper,
expected next Tuesday.
It was evident last night that much attention will focus on the
quality of guarantees given by the Government to attempt to ensure the
HQ stays in Scotland. Most industry observers believe that, after
privatisation, the floated company would be able to rescind any such
Ministerial assurances.
The White Paper is expected to include terms of privatisation which
will prevent any private owner from quickly changing the structure of
the company so that the Scottish unit could be absorbed into a single
operation and its headquarters moved south of the Border.
Ministers, who spent 10 minutes discussing the subject in Cabinet
yesterday, are thought to have expressed doubts about the viability of
floating Scottish Nuclear on its own, despite a report from the
company's financial advisers, Lazards, arguing that it was perfectly
possible.
Although the company was acknowledged to have done well in achieving a
profitable performance this year, it was apparently felt that the
audited accounts might not be quite as favourable as those issued in
advance of audit by the company.
Some Ministers also felt that Scottish Nuclear, with only two plants,
one of which (Hunterston) might face decommissioning in around 20 years,
might be in a more fragile position than if it were part of a larger UK
company. Scottish Nuclear was also thought to be more susceptible to
predator bids as a small company on its own.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said assurances about
retaining Scottish Nuclear as a separate entity were ''simply a con
trick that will persuade no-one, as worthless as their promises on
everything else''.
He said the decision had shown Mr Lang once again ''to be the
Cabinet's man in Scotland rather than Scotland's man in the Cabinet.
''Privatisation will be a disaster for the Scottish nuclear industry
and Scottish jobs. This is the most illogical and ill-conceived
privatisation of all and will be opposed tooth and nail.
''It is a betrayal of a proud and successful Scottish company. It is
simply a desperate panic measure designed to raise a quick buck for
pre-election tax cuts.''
Opposition Trade and Industry spokesman Brian Wilson asked: ''What
conceivable right have the Tories to jeopardise the publicly owned
industry's 100% safety record for the crudest of short-term political
motives?
''As safety and environmental aspects of this privatisation are
discussed, and taxpayers become aware of another massive rip-off in the
making, this will be another electoral liability for the Tories.
''Nobody else believes that selling off the family plutonium is a
clever or safe idea.''
He said the best way to protect Scottish Nuclear was to prevent the
privatisation going ahead and urged the broadest possible campaign north
and south of the Border.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ''Despite the pseudo independence the
Cabinet have decided to grant Scottish Nuclear, the fact is that the
company is to be privatised as part of the same parent company as
Nuclear Electric.
''This nuclear fusion and privatisation being proposed by the Tories
is unwanted, unstable, and unsafe. They are merging Scottish assets with
English liabilities.''
He said the new company's centre of gravity would be south of the
Border. Any Government assurances would be as worthless as those given
when Guinness took over United Distillers, any Scottish identity as
token as the Scottish identity within British Gas.
It was a scandal that the Government should even consider the
privatisation to stoke up its treasure chest for tax bribes to Middle
England at the expense of the jobs and safety of the people of Scotland.
Mr Phil Gallie, Conservative MP for Ayr, said: ''If what I am led to
believe is right this gives Scottish Nuclear a lead role in a new all-UK
organisation with basically the management structure currently existing
at Scottish Nuclear taking overall control. I would take that as a
compliment to Scottish Nuclear.''
He said he could support the decision, provided the financial base
stayed in Scotland and engineering jobs in Scotland were increased
rather than cut.
Mr Bill Walker, Conservative MP for North Tayside, said: ''If the
reports are true then it is much better than I feared and goes some way
towards addressing what I have called the Scottish dimension.
''While waiting to see the detail, I give it a cautious welcome. If,
however, it can be demonstrated that once the company is in the private
sector the owners can make substantial changes then my qualified support
would disappear.''
The Government hopes to raise about #3000m from the sale, which is
expected to go through in the summer of 1996.

GLASGOW yesterday revealed two contrasting faces in the run-up to
VE-Day: they were separated by the twin peaks of age and experience, but
shared a plateau when it came to identifying what they saw as a common
current foe.
The voice of age and experience, the chairwoman of Strathclyde Elderly
Forum, fired the main salvo at the enemy -- identified as the Government
-- and called on it to remember today's pensioners in the countdown to
VE-Day.
Mrs Lily Kennedy, 72, whose husband fought with the Desert Rats, said:
''It is right and fitting that we remember those who lost their lives
during the Second World War.
''It is as important, however, that we also remember Britain's wartime
generation who are now today's pensioners. We are living in poverty,
ignored by the Government.
''A single person's pension is only #58.85 a week. Older people are
forced to scrimp and save, to turn down their heating, and go without
basic necessities. We are the generation who fought for our country when
it needed us. We feel angry and betrayed that, now we need help, the
Government has let us down.''
Mrs Kennedy was joined in her condemnation by Mr Eddie Traynor, 79,
and Mrs Marion Robertson, 81.
Mr Traynor served in France and Germany in the 10th Battalion of the
Highland Light Infantry after being called up on April 1, 1940. ''Any
fool could go,'' he said.
However, the plight of his ex-comrades was no laughing matter. They
had won the war, but were now having to fight poverty. Mr Traynor said
pensioners in the UK were among the poorest in Europe: in Strathclyde
some 42% of pensioners were living below the poverty line.
Mr Traynor said: ''They are living very frugally. It is either heat or
meat during the winter months. Our pension is continually being eroded.
It's all right remembering our glorious dead, but we want something
special for war pensioners.''
Mrs Robertson, who worked as an electrician in the shipyards on the
Clyde during the war, said: ''It is shocking the way the Government has
treated pensioners.''
It was a refrain which found an echo with a younger generation, the
pupils of St Mary's Primary School in Maryhill, Glasgow, who yesterday
staged their own VE-Day street party with local pensioners.
Patrick McConville, 11, said: ''The pensioners should get a lot of
money because they saved the country.''

THE conviction of battered wife Sara Thornton, serving life for the
murder of her violent, drunken husband, was referred back to the Court
of Appeal yesterday by Home Secretary Michael Howard.
Mr Howard, who had earlier vetoed a referral, said he had changed his
mind in the light of new representations by Thornton's solicitors.
Thornton, of Atherstone, Warwickshire, stabbed husband Malcolm to
death with a kitchen knife in June 1989 and was sentenced to life
imprisonment at Birmingham Crown Court in February 1990.

THE MAJOR meltdown in the south last night leaves the Tories virtually
wiped out in local government and at their lowest ebb in living memory.
Next week they'll be looking for a scapegoat and a complete fresh
start.
With the final results still being counted it looked as though Mr Tony
Blair will finish up with a massive 22% lead for Labour in the council
elections for 12,000 seats in England and Wales.
Early this morning, the results suggested the Conservatives could lose
more than 2500 while Labour was projected to win 48% of the share of the
national vote, a situation one Labour insider described as the Tories
having suffered ''electoral meltdown''.
The Liberal Democrats were predicted to win more council seats than
the Conservatives. Labour said it had won 39 councils.
The Tory humiliation follows their obliteration in Scotland last month
and the only sign of hope for Mr Major was that none of the councillors
he has sacrificed were calling for his resignation as party leader.
From Dover to York through Tunbridge Wells, South Bedfordshire and
Blaby in Leicestershire, Labour was driving ahead and the Liberal
Democrats were consolidating.
Environment Secretary John Gummer said: ''It's a bad night for us, a
good one for Labour and a mixed one for the Liberal Democrats. Very many
Tories stayed at home. A very large number of people are very unhappy.''
Mr Blair took his triumph modestly: ''We are not being complacent but
there is a bond of trust developing. People in this country have been
crying out for a sensible alternative to the Tory Party and now they
have got it.
''We are demonstrating that we have got support in all parts of our
nation.''
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the Government
must now go.
''The Conservatives deserve to be punished for their record since the
General Election and for the savage cuts in education which they are
responsible for this year. The whole Government is responsible and the
whole Government should go now,'' he declared.
Yesterday's elections south of the Border were devastating for the
Tories who have seen nothing like this before, while there is an
unprecedented consolidation of Labour strength.
This indicates that if Mr Major survives as Tory leader he is going to
have to come back from about 40% behind Mr Tony Blair if the Tories are
given another two years before the next General Election.
The ''Blair Effect'' is causing Tory voters to switch straight across
to Labour, even in the Tory heartlands of the South-east where the
recession hit hardest and recovery is taking longer to be felt. Result:
the voters are taking every opportunity to demonstrate their severe
displeasure and they're doing so consistently.
For 16 months now Mr Major has commanded less than 30% in opinion
polls. Margaret Thatcher, at her lowest ebb in 1981-82, matched this
figure for only nine months and before her Harold Wilson in 1968 was
turning things round in only six months.
By last night's calculations the national voting share is as follows:
Labour 47% (+12%); Liberal Democrats 24% (+6%) and the Tories were down
18% to 25%, their worst ever showing.
There wasn't a single result to indicate that things are not getting
worse for Mr Major. Party chairman Jeremy Hanley said that he is
prepared to have his own performance judged by these local election
results -- and he may turn out to be the scapegoat for the debacle.
His deputy, Mr John Maples, acknowledged the ''very disappointing''
result. Both he and Mr Gummer insisted that their only chance of
improvement is to demonstrate a united party. ''The recovery in the
economy is taking a long time to feed through and we just have to
persuade people that we are getting things right in the way that they
want.''
More trouble looms later today for the Government with the
widely-expected announcement of a further rise in interest rates.
If there were a General Election next week Mr Blair would be due for a
landslide victory, with the Tories struggling to hold on to about 100
seats in the Commons. The local election results went far beyond the
dismal outcome that the Tories had already discounted and when they
return from the VE-Day celebrations over the weekend they will be
demanding, if not new leadership, much more coherent policies which Tory
voters will find easier to identify and applaud.
* A surprise Labour victor in staunchly blue Hove borough council in
East Sussex was Ms Freida Brown, daughter of the party's one time deputy
leader, the late Lord George Brown. The Conservatives lost overall
control of the council, losing nine seats to Labour.
* Merseyside's former assistant chief constable Alison Halford became
a Labour councillor.
