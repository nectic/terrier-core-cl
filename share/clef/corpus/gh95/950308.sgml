THE biggest developer in the North-east of Scotland has opened a new
show home at Cove, just south of Aberdeen.
Charlestown View is one of Stewart Milne Homes's most popular
developments, attracting queues of house hunters when the first phase
was launched in 1993. There are 15 homes left in the current phase of
the development, offering a choice of two and three-bedroom villas and
bungalows.
The new show home is the three-bedroom Doirlinn. Its features include
fitted mirrored wardrobes, full double glazing, gas central heating,
smoke detectors, external lighting, and an integral garage with access
from the kitchen.
''These features and many more can be found in all the homes at
Charlestown View,'' says Stewart Milne Homes divisional director Donald
McInnes. ''With four styles to choose from, including the popular
Kinnaird bungalow with its 'room in the roof' option, and prices
starting at just #65,500, there is something to suit every lifestyle and
pocket.''

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown, who last night watched Brian McClair in
action for Manchester United against Wimbledon with a view to including
him in his squad for the European Championship match against Russia in
Moscow at the end of the month, is leaving nothing to chance as the
Scots aim to qualify for the finals in England next year.
The Russians had not scheduled any matches before the meeting with
Scotland, but Brown has discovered that they had hastily arranged to
travel for a friendly match against Croatia in Kosic tonight -- and one
of his assistants will be there.
''I discovered that Manchester United's Andrei Kanchelskis had been
called up by the Russians,'' said Brown. ''This international had been
given no publicity, but as soon as we knew where and when they would be
playing, we had to find out their form. To that end, Frank Coulston will
travel to Croatia and we will have a detailed report.''
Meantime, Brown will be travelling. This morning he is heading for
Athens to take in tonight's match between Greece and Switzerland. The
Greeks also pose a threat to Scotland in the European qualifying
section.
Brown would not be drawn on suggestions that Coventry City keeper
Jonathon Gould, son of former Arsenal striker Bobby, could solve a
goalkeeping problem for the match against Russia on March 29.
With Andy Goram and Bryan Gunn injured, Hibernian veteran Jim Leighton
will be the No.1 in Moscow, but there is competition for the deputy role
and Gould, who has played only three hours of first-team football this
season, qualifies to play for Scotland, because of a Scottish
grandmother.

KILMARNOCK chairman Bob Fleeting will don his blue-and-white scarf and
join the 4600 other Ayrshire fans who will queue up at Hampden on Friday
night for the Tennents Scottish Cup quarter-final with Celtic as he
maintains his stance that it would be inappropriate to accept
hospitality from the club with whom Killie have a long standing
compensation dispute, writes Ian Paul.
''I don't mean this as a protest or anything of that sort,'' he said.
''It is simply that I don't want to be a hypocrite.''
Although he has made an individual decision, it is certain that his
example will be followed by the other directors, which should leave some
room in the Hampden hospitality suite. However, Fleeting is anxious to
point out that his decision to follow this line, which he has already
done for the past two games against Celtic at Hampden this season, has
not been a major sacrifice.
''To be honest, it has brought back great memories of the days when my
pals and I who played football together used to go to see Scotland at
Hampden,'' he said.
''In the last two games I have met them again, had a pint before the
game, and gone to cheer on Killie with them. It will be the same this
week, although I would prefer the result to be different than last
time.''
Celtic won that league game 2-1, but by the time the teams meet again
in the league, at Rugby Park on March 21, the dispute about compensation
for the Ayrshire club as a result of Celtic acquiring manager Tommy
Burns and assistant Billy Stark will be settled by the appeals tribunal,
which meets the previous day. Celtic already have been fined #100,000
for breach of league rules and failed with two appeals against the
decision.

Scotland 1, Brazil 0
DUNDEE United S-form signing James Paterson steered Scotland to a
deserved win in this schoolboys international at Hampden Park.
To add to the Brazilian woes they had central defender Fabiano carried
off with a leg injury midway through the second period.
That was shortly after Scotland had got the important winner in 50
minutes, when keeper Julio Cesar could only push out a dangerous
right-wing cross from Andrew Porteous and the on-running Paterson shot
low into the net.
Scotland, urged on by their voluble young support in the crowd of
9778, almost added a second a minute later, when the Brazilian keeper
was again in action to hold a cross at the feet of the advancing Alex
Notman.

SACKED Arsenal manger George Graham will have to fight for the right
to stay in world football after being charged by the Football
Association over alleged transfer deal bungs.
The Scot was dismissed two weeks ago after a Premier League inquiry
concluded that he had received #425,000 from the signings of
Scandinavians Pal Lydersen and John Jensen.
Relevant documents were passed to the FA, and now chief executive
Graham Kelly has decided there is a case of misconduct against Graham,
who has 21 days to respond.
Meanwhile, the FA will conduct their own investigation into the
transfer deals, and then contact Arsenal.
''We will co-operate fully with the FA inquiry'', managing director
Ken Friar said yesterday.
Graham has said that he will vigorously contest his dismissal by the
Gunners, who alleged that he did not ''act in the best interests of the
club''.
The latest developments mean Graham faces an even bigger battle, as
UEFA president Lennart Johansson said: ''If it's proven that a manager
has taken money from a transfer, he must be banned for life worldwide.''
Graham, who won six major trophies in his eight years at Highbury, had
called on the FA to stage a full investigation.
Confirmation that he must appear in the dock at Lancaster Gate was
revealed in a statement which read: ''The FA has decided to charge Mr
George Graham, the former manager of Arsenal Football Club, with
misconduct in relation to payments allegedly received by him in
connection with transfers.
''On February 28, the FA received evidence from the FA Premier League
inquiry concerning the transfers of Pal Lydersen and John Jensen from
their Scandinavian clubs to Arsenal in November 1991 and July 1992
respectively.
''The FA is still considering the evidence and will be conducting its
own investigation. We will be in touch with Arsenal shortly in
connection with the facts surrounding these matters.
''Mr Graham has 21 days in which to respond to the charges against
him.''.
Graham claims the money he received from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge
was an unsolicited gift.
Once the payments had been exposed, Graham paid back the cash to
Arsenal, plus an additional #40,000 ''on account of profits''.
The Premier League are currently investigating all transfers involving
overseas players -- and former Liverpool boss Graeme Souness has issued
a writ for damages for libel against News (UK) Limited after a story on
Dane Torben Piechnik.
Piechnik's move to Anfield also involved Hauge, but Souness, who is
reported to be cutting short a six-week coaching and business tour of
Australia to return to Britain because of family illness, strongly
denies any impropriety.
Johansson, meanwhile, clearly has little sympathy for Graham, saying:
''Arsenal have already reacted, and I would think it would be very
difficult for the man (Graham) to get a new job.
''Our sanctions will follow once the English FA reports are on our
table, though I am certain the English FA will take the necessary
actions.''
* THE FA will take no immediate action against Manchester United
midfielder Paul Ince, despite a police decision to charge him with
common assault.
Ince's United team-mate, Eric Cantona, was involved in an alleged
assault on Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons as the Frenchman walked
from the field after being sent off at Selhurst Park on January 25.
Cantona has been banned from football worldwide until September 30
and, like Ince, faces a court appearance on March 23 following his
action during the game.
However, an FA spokesman stressed today that the police charge against
27-year-old Ince would not automatically mean the FA would take action
against him.
''If we had received a complaint about his behaviour at the time, we
might have considered charging Paul Ince, but we did not,'' the
spokesman said.
''We would only consider charging him now if he was found guilty of an
offence.''
United will not be disciplining Ince either, for the moment. Only if
the England star is found guilty on March 23 -- he will be pleading not
guilty at Croydon magistrates court -- will they consider punishing him.
Ince was in the United team for last night's match with Wimbledon at
Selhurst Park.

HISTORY does not tell us whether it was Edinburgh house prices that
made kings Malcolm III, David I, Edward I, Charles II and Robert the
Bruce decide to reign from Dunfermline but that is certainly why
accountant Robert Wilson is planning to move his family from their
gardenless flat in Scotland's new capital north over the Forth to a
four-bedroom detached house with garden.
The cost of housing in Dunfermline is much lower than in Perth,
Stirling or Edinburgh and yet the town has a wealth of amenities and
attractions, as well as a heritage second to none.
Culture was brought to the town by Malcolm Canmore's saintly wife
Margaret, who began building a Benedictine monastery in 1072. The
tradition was upheld by donations from Dunfermline-born Andrew Carnegie,
the philanthropist, who on his return sought to bring more 'sweetness
and light' into the 'monotonous lives of the toiling masses'.
In Dunfermline's hilly streets, Carnegie's munificence is evident in
libraries, sports centres, cultural halls and public parks not to
mention street names. The town as a whole is greatly enhanced by his
gift of Pittencrieff Park, an enchanting glen famous for its peacocks.
The town is dominated by the Palace facade ( the monastery guest
house), and the Dunfermline Abbey Church, built on the foundations of
the Norman Abbey.
In the nineteenth century the town was renowned for its linen
production. Dunfermline is once again on a high in spite of the troubles
at Rosyth three miles away. BSkyB, Dunfermline Building Society and the
electronics firm Solectron have boosted job prospects
There is much house building going on such as the joint venture by
Miller Partnerships and Scottish Homes at Carnegie Court in the town
centre. As Irene Glassey, sales manager at Miller Partnerships, says:
'We are delighted with the way Carnegie Court has turned out, achieving
50% sales in one month.
'The scheme of 22 flats gives priority to the first-time buyer,
existing council tenants and those on the waiting list. Prices are
competitive with one-bedroom flats from #34,000, two-bedroom from
#39,750 and three-bedroom maisonettes from #55,000.
There have been considerable developments by the council of leisure
centres, and Abbot House Heritage Centre is to open next month. A number
of new housing sites at South Bellyeoman are being made available.
Dunfermline is within easy reach of Perth, Stirling and Edinburgh,
with access to the M90 and a frequent rail link to to the new capital.
Gary Middlemass, property manager at the local firm, Morgans, says:
'Dunfermline, only 13 miles from Edinburgh, is well established with
commuters. The local market is also a hive of activity, with buyers for
flats from #25,000 and for ex-local authority properties in areas like
Touch and Abbey View.
'Even the best parts of town, at Garvock Hill to the east, and Park
Avenue near the centre, are attractive to those who cannot afford
Edinburgh prices.'
The only problem accountant Robert Wilson foresees is the lower
capital appreciation over the bridge.
Steven Allenby, valuer at Slater, Hogg &amp; Howison, says: 'Dunfermline
is proving to have inspired confidence with numerous developers such as
Wimpey, Walker, Beazer, Persimmon, Thomas Mitchell, Richmond and the
eagerly awaited east-side expansion by L&amp;C. There is even talk of growth
on the west side of town and interest shown by Muir Homes.
'Dunfermline has a good choice of properties at comparatively cheap
prices. There is an eager market in two-bedroom semis from #40,000 and
three-bedroom from #51,000, to three-bedroom detached from #59,000 and
three-bedroom bungalows between #70,000 and #80,000.'
Dunfermline's other amenities include good local high schools, a
buzzing High Street with a large Marks &amp; Spencer and Kingsgate indoor
mall, retail parks with B &amp; Q and Asda, golf courses at Canmore and
Pitreavie, and First Division football at Dunfermline Athletic FC.
Proposed new facilities include supermarkets, schools, golf courses and
parklands.
Jackie Bristow, property manageress at W.J. Reid, says: 'One small
gripe I have with Dunfermline is the lack of variety in the shops, and
there is a need for a new school in the north of the town. The major
plus point is the high quality of life, and no one can deny that it is
an attractive place to bring up a family.'
Despite the events of 1603, Dunfermline is still a capital place to
live in.

Partick Thistle 2, Dundee Utd 0
THISTLE came up with another of their workaholic displays last night
to take a three-point jump up the premier division table and set off
alarms in half a dozen grounds throughout the country.
In typically gritted-teeth fashion they were far too committed to
their task for a United team which is in danger of letting their
concentration on cup exploits cause them league palpitations.
In front of just 2627, a goal by substitute Tom Smith and a
last-minute score by Wayne Foster were enough to allow the
bottom-of-the-league club to reel in Aberdeen, whom they meet on
Saturday, to within two points and a handful of others to catching
distance.
The demons that have bedevilled this game -- it had been postponed
five times since its scheduled December 10 date -- were still working
right up to less an than an hour before kick-off, when it required an
inspection by referee Michael McCurry to give the all-clear.
Under the newly acquired protective covers, Firhill was soggy but
playable and the home team, as ever, were willing to fight for any
rewards available.
They might have had a bonus of a start when United's Brian Welsh lost
the ball inside his own penalty area, and his namesake, Steve Welsh,
shot for goal. However, United were saved by a deflection.
Thistle were hard done by a little later when a Colin McKee pass put
Derek McWilliams through the heart of the United defence and forced the
keeper to race out.
The Thistle man was knocked down by the goalie on the 18-yard line
but, inexplicably, the referee saw nothing wrong. As is so often the
case, Thistle immediately had a man of their own booked, Steve Pittman,
when he flattened Robbie Winters.
0 Thistle, who had done more than enough already to warrant a lead,
had a further two efforts at goal before the break, a McWilliams shot
which went over the bar, and a header by Albert Craig which was stopped
by O'Hanlon.
Thistle carried on where they left off at the beginning of the second
half, but United managed one intervention with a Brian Welsh shot which
was too high. Sergio then had their best effort to date, a drive that
forced Nicky Walker into a good save.
United replaced Craig Brewster with Sergio after 61 minutes and then a
few minutes later replace Winters with Crabbe. Thistle responded by
putting on Smith for Rod McDonald. And it was the home substitution that
did the trick when Smith crashed the ball high into the net after Craig
had made the running down the left.
Thistle held on after that and in the last minute, Ian Cameron sent
Foster through to ease the tension.
John Lambie, the Thistle manager, was pleased. ''This puts us in with
a real chance of staying up,'' he said. ''The game against Aberdeen will
be interesting now with the pressure on them.''
Partick Thistle -- Walker, McKee, Pittman, Watson, Welsh, Turner,
McDonald, Craig, Foster, Cameron, McWilliams. Substitutes -- Charnley,
Smith, Cairns.
Dundee United -- O'Hanlon, McInally, Malpas, Hannah, Petric, Welsh,
Bowman, Winters, Sergio, Nixon, Dailly. Substitutes -- Crabbe, Brewster,
Jorgensen.
Referee -- T McCurry (Glasgow).

IT WAS Bill Shankly who opined that football was more important than
life or death; his spirit lives on. Only someone with such a blinkered
view of the human condition could be pleased at the notion that the
Republic of Ireland v England ''friendly'' should be replayed in Dublin
as soon as possible.
You remember all the delights of the first match just three weeks ago.
A section of English supporters, not best pleased when the Irish had the
temerity to score a goal, tore up the seats in the Lansdowne Road stand
and hurled them down on spectators below.
They then gave Nazi-style salutes before engaging in a pitched battle
with the local riot police. No-one in the city could breathe easily
until the mob were herded aboard ferries to take them back home.
Other passengers were tactfully advised not to irritate them. Imagine
what a rewarding experience it would have been to have your family
returning from a holiday on the same night.
Yet the missiles had hardly ceased to rain down on the field than the
excuses were being offered. It was that ''tiny minority'' of supporters
again; the Irish police had ignored warnings; the stadium was not
suitable for such events.
Graham Kelly of the FA, a man whose television style owes much to the
Woodentops and forever seems to have sat on a cow-pat, was promising all
kinds of high-level inquiries into what had gone wrong. Heard any
findings, yet? No, neither have I.
What I have heard is the two team managers talking up the possibility
of a replay. Terry Venables and Jack Charlton are united in their
ambition to stage the Nightmare on Lansdowne Road 2.
''It has to be played again in Dublin,'' they chorus. ''The hooligans
cannot be allowed to win.''
Excuse me, lads, the hooligans are not in Dublin, they live on the
mainland of England, and most people, in the Irish Republic and the rest
of Europe, want them to stay there. The rioters won nothing; football
lost.
The English authorities seem eager to shut their eyes to the reality.
Despite the money they bring with them, their national team supporters
are simply not welcome. Nor are those from many of their clubs.
I am told by people who should know better that the Belgian police
were too hard on the Chelsea fans last week. What a joke.
Anybody who set out for Bruges without a ticket knew exactly the risk
they were running. The local police had spelled out the likely
consequences; the hard men still came. If innocents were hurt, I am
sorry; sadly, if you associate with trouble-makers that often happens.
It cost the city of Bruges almost half-a-million pounds for the
privilege of having Chelsea fans visit their historic city. They do not
wish to see them return.
I am not saying this is a problem unique to the English -- our own
''army'' is not without hooligans and the Dutch are no angels -- but the
disease is particularly virulent there. Nor is it helped by politicians
who pretend that all other countries are inferior to their own.
The English football authorities, instead of trying to pretend it is
business as usual, must find ways of cleaning up the act. At the moment,
the idea of staging the European Championships in England is manifestly
absurd.
Maybe they need Government help in the shape of removal of passports
of known trouble-makers. If so, it is up to them to ask.
Even that move, however, would not help to defuse the situation in
Ireland, where no documents are required for entry from the UK. There is
no excuse for subjecting the city of Dublin to another rammy.
A game of football, any game, is not worth the risk of serious
disorder, not worth the possibility of serious injuries, not worth a
single death in its name. Bill Shankly was wrong.
* I WAS absolutely delighted that Eric Peters was one of Scotland's
try-scorers in the victory over Wales on Saturday. There is no doubt
about his ancestry -- born in Glasgow, as he told me the first time I
met him.
After the memorable match in Paris, a couple approached me and asked
if Eric could be brought out from the dressing room to meet them. I said
this was impossible and ''in any case, he has no clothes on at the
moment.''
''We are his parents,'' said the lady, ''and we have seen him with no
clothes on.'' I fetched their boy.

THE row between the Scottish Amateur Rowing Association and the
Glasgow Green-based club, Clyde -- one of the association's founder
members in 1881 -- looks set to go all the way to next Sunday's general
meeting.
When the papers for this meeting were issued, they included a motion
from the SARA executive committee that Clyde should be expelled from
membership because of failure to pay debts incurred during last summer's
competitive season. Now in a move to bring themselves back into line,
the membership of Clyde have themselves called a special meeting to
address the problem of the club's funding and consider restructuring the
management of the club.
As part of this process, club member Michael Yeoman set up a meeting
last week with association president John MacDougall to explore the
possibility of negotiating a stay of execution.
According to Yeoman later, the meeting gave him cause for hope but
during last weekend's Scottish Schools race at Glasgow Green MacDougall
confirmed that the expulsion motion would go forward regardless, unless
a meeting of the executive committee decided to alter the stance taken.
This scenario still places Clyde in severe danger, as the only time
the executive will reassemble will be in the few minutes before the
scheduled start of the general meeting.
In his only concession, MacDougall did confirm that, should the motion
go forward, he would allow Clyde to state their case at the meeting. The
strict letter of the law is that clubs in debt to the association are
not permitted to take part in association business in any way.

THE BBC yesterday announced that it has secured exclusive rights to
televise the Martell Grand National until the year 2000.
The new agreement also includes continued coverage on BBC Radio.
The corporation has covered the National continuously since 1960 but
the present contract ends with this year's race on April 8.
The BBC last year lost its rights to cover Cheltenham to Channel 4,
which will next week be televising the Festival meeting for the first

GREEN Archer bridged a gap of more than four years since his last
victory under Rules when snatching a fortunate victory in Leicester's
Gary Wiltshire Leicestershire Hunters' Chase.
Gambled on from 8-1 down to 5s, the 12-year-old profited from the
last-fence fall of clear leader Ryde Again to come home 30 lengths clear
of Sparkling Flame.
In the saddle was 29-year-old ''Lawney'' Hill, the wife of the
distinguished rider Alan, who was the first to congratulate her.
''Lawney rode a great race. This is an amazing coincidence because I
had my very first racecourse success at this meeting 10 years ago on
Elmboy, and went on to win the Cheltenham Foxhunters Chase on him,'' he
said.
Mrs Hill added: ''Alan said I should go round the outside for the
fresh ground and I did exactly as I was told.''

SCOTLAND'S longest-established football agent, Bill McMurdo, has
become the first in Britain to lodge the new #100,000 FIFA bond.
Agents are now required to be licensed under the world's ruling body
and the SFA have seen five applicants in the last two weeks.
McMurdo, Fife lawyer Blair Morgan, former goalkeeper Jim McArthur,
Edinburgh-based Jake Duncan, and Raymond Sparkes all have been
interviewed.
But so far Glasgow-based McMurdo is the only one to put the bond in
place, which is a strict prerequisite of the new licence.
His application will now be forwarded to FIFA in Switzerland by the
SFA, but the others will stay at Park Gardens until the bonds are in
place.
However, McMurdo, who represents 50 players, 20 of whom are out of
contract at the end of this season, is still unhappy with the new
system.
''On principle, I object to lodging a sum like this simply to continue
doing what I already have been doing for close on 20 years,'' he said.
''However, I have always operated strictly within the rules so if this
is what it takes to continue in that manner, so be it.''
''I have to put the interests of the players to the forefront and give
them peace of mind and security for the future.''
SFA secretary Jim Farry confirmed that the bond is in place in a Swiss
bank and sees no problems for the other applicants.
''None of the people we have seen appears to be unsuitable but the
final licensing decision rests with FIFA,'' he confirmed.
However, the six-figure bond may be a stumbling block for some, and
the next few weeks will determine how many agents are operating in the
Scottish game.
* FOOTBALL was hit again last night with postponements due to snow.
But the recent bad spell means that the first division, which would have
been idle on Saturday, now has three games involving promotion and
relegation issues.
Clydebank and Ayr quickly agreed after last night's match was
cancelled that they would try again on Saturday, joining the games
between Dunfermline-St Johnstone and Stranraer-St Mirren from last
Saturday.
The second-division match between Morton and Clyde, knocked out last
night, has been rescheduled for next Tuesday, and the third division's
Forfar-Montrose derby has been redated for Tuesday, April 4.
The weather also caused the postponement of an international trial
match between a Scottish Junior FA select and Hamilton Accies, scheduled
for tonight at Linlithgow.

OKSANA Grischuk and Evgeny Platov, the couple who put an end to Jayne
Torvill and Christopher Dean's comeback dreams, dominated the World
Figure Skating Championships yesterday in Birmingham.
The Russians' rock-and-roll routine helped deny the English pair the
Olympic ice dance title last year -- and soon after Britain's golden duo
returned to the professional ranks.
They missed last month's European championships in Germany because of
a knee injury to Platov, allowing Finland's Susanna Rahkamo and Petri
Kokko to win their first major title.
But the title holders, who train in America, marked their comeback by
winning both compulsory dances on the opening day of the championships
-- returning to Britain for the first time since 1950 -- at the NEC.
British youngsters Michelle Fitzgerald and Vincent Kyle, given the
unenviable task of trying to emulate Torvill and Dean, finished the
first day in nineteenth place. They were eighteenth after the first
compulsory dance, the rhumba, but slipped one place down after the
Argentine Tango.
''We were eighteenth after the first dance at the Europeans, so this
was an improvement when you look at some of the couples we have
beaten,'' said Kyle. ''Obviously we would have liked to have been a
couple of places higher because every time we skate that's what we are
looking to do.
''It was a disability going on so early for the second dance. That did
us no favours, but that's the way it goes. At the end of the day it does
not make a lot of difference to the scores.''
Grischuk and Platov, whose relationship off the ice has been described
as stormy, will now be favourites to retain the title with the Finns
looking good for the silver.

COUNCIL tax charges in Scotland are to rise by more than 6% on
average, according to figures compiled yesterday by The Herald.
However, that figure covers a huge variation in the increases levied
by councils across the country, with residents of Strathkelvin district
facing a rise of almost 12%, while Edinburgh citizens will pay only 1.7%
more.
Only a handful of authorities have still to declare their levels for
next year, but it is already clear that the biggest impact will be made
by Strathclyde region's 13% hike in charges.
When that is added to the tax demands from the region's 19 district
councils, the average increase falls to about 9.5%. However, the
Scottish figure excluding Strathclyde is less than 4%.
Edinburgh remains the most expensive area for local government taxes,
with a Band D figure of #827, but is now being challenged for that title
by Strathkelvin (#778) and Monklands (#771). Glasgow's Band D level has
been set at #763, compared with #688 for Aberdeen.
The lowest bills look likely to be sent out in Kincardine and Deeside
(#562) and Stewartry (#567), although Shetland councillors, meeting on
Thursday, may better that figure.
Overall, the national average increase of more than 6% is lower than
the forecast of 10% issued by the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities late last year.
That prediction followed the Government's ''tight but realistic''
financial settlement for 1995-6, which left finance directors,
especially in the regions, facing their biggest collective headache for
20 years.
One of the worst aspects of the settlement for councils was the 0.4%
reduction in Government grant after provision for community care was
removed.
Cosla also condemned the Government's imposed capping limits as
unrealistic, since they put regional councils in the position of having
to make a 5% reduction in existing services to stay within the limits
and avoid Scottish Office intervention in their finances.
The search for these reductions has resulted in a number of councils
seeking voluntary redundancies, and offering early retirement for staff.
One of the other major problems facing council leaders and finance
officials was the Government's continuing refusal to build any provision
into the settlement for meeting pay rises for council staff.
This failure to recognise the cost of nationally-negotiated salary and
wage awards for 1994-95 and 1995-96 resulted, Cosla has claimed, in a
shortfall of #144m for councils.
Crucial influences on the various councils' tax levels have been
whether or not they chose to use up reserves, and whether they managed
to tuck away some funds to meet the pay rises.
Having significant balances left to feed into the system this year has
helped some councils to keep their council tax lower than would
otherwise have been the case.
The authorities have received little sympathy from the Scottish
Office, where Scottish Secretary Ian Lang insisted they would have to
meet wage rises from efficiency savings.
He pointed to what he claimed had been achieved in this field in the
private sector, and at the Scottish Office itself.
At a time of public spending constraints, he said, councils would have
to manage their finances more effectively and more economically.
Mr Lang also made the point that Scottish council spending is, on
average, 45% a head higher than in England, and he drew attention to the
fact that Scottish council staffing levels had risen by more than 2000
in the year to June 1994.
However, council leaders insist that the staff increases are the
direct result of having to cope with central Government-imposed
initiatives, such as care in the community.

Motherwell 2, Falkirk 2
STEVE Kirk, who scored many vital goals during his time at Fir Park,
was the hero for his new club last night, equalising after the home team
had twice taken the lead.
Football wanderer Mo Johnston was overshadowed in his debut for his
eighth senior club by new Motherwell star Eddie May.
Former Falkirk man May made a superb home debut as he set up the Fir
Parkers' opener and then slammed in their second.
'Well boss Alex McLeish gave Steve Kirk and Paul McGrillen, plus
#100,000, to Falkirk for the 27-year-old and is already reaping a return
for his money.
Motherwell had looked set to gain a victory that would have gone a
long way to securing second position in the premier division and the
UEFA Cup spot it guarantees.
But former hero Kirk came back to haunt them when he tucked away
Falkirk's equaliser in 75 minutes.
There was more drama just a minute later, when Falkirk were reduced to
10 men. Dougie Arnott went down clutching his jaw, and after consulting
his linesman, referee John Rowbotham sent off defender David Weir.
It was then backs to the wall for Falkirk, who somehow managed to hold
out as Motherwell went all-out for a winner.
May had his former side in trouble after just six minutes when he set
up the opening goal. He ran menacingly from inside his own half and
caught the visitors' defence cold as he slipped the ball through to Alex
Burns.
John Hughes attempted to clear, but the ball broke to Paul Lambert
and, with Tony Parks off his line, the midfielder easily side-footed
home his first goal of the season.
But it took Falkirk just five minutes to get back on level terms.
Keeper Steve Woods was given no chance when Joe McLaughlin met John
Clark's free kick and sent a glancing header flashing past him.
Arnott headed a Rab McKinnon corner behind the far post on the
half-hour mark, but it was Falkirk who finished the half strongly.
Their three new boys almost produced a goal when McGrillen found
Johnston who set up Kirk, but the former 'Well man's shot flew wide.
Motherwell stepped up a gear in the second half and deservedly
regained their lead in 54 minutes.
A strong run forward by McKinnon looked like bringing a penalty when
he was brought down by Hughes, but the ball ran to May and he shot home
from eight yards.
Apart from the red card there were four bookings -- Falkirk's Jamie
McGowan, Clark, and McGrillen, and Motherwell's John Philliben.
Motherwell -- Woods, Philliben, McKinnon, Krivokapic, Martin, McCart,
Lambert, Dolan, Burns, Arnott, May. Substitutes -- Shannon, Roddie,
Howie.
Falkirk -- Parks, Weir, McGowan, Hughes, McLaughlin, Clark, Kirk,
Fulton, McGrillen, Johnston, McKenzie. Substitutes -- Rice, Henderson,
Lamont.
Referee -- J Rowbotham (Kirkcaldy).

Stenhousemuir 2, Berwick 2
BERWICK had the better of the opening period but the home side went
ahead in 36 minutes.
Gareth Hutchison took a Tom Steel pass and ran from halfway to shoot
from 16 yards.
The home joy was shortlived, however, and two minutes later Martin
Neil cleverly went past three defenders before sidefooting in from close
range.
The pattern of play was reversed in the second period. The home side
took control but went behind in 73 minutes when Alistair Reid squeezed
the ball home at the back post following a corner on the left.
The Warriors got their due reward two minutes from time when Adrian
Sprott was brought down by Alan Banks as he burst through. Sprott
himself converted the penalty.

AILEEN Travers, who suddenly announced the end of her international
career last week, has explained why she has turned her back on her place
in the World Championship team.
The Perth dentist, who has won a total of 33 caps for Scotland, is no
longer prepared to give the time and commitment required to stay at the
top. ''At 28 years of age I'd like to do something else with my life
now,'' said Travers. ''I will miss the international scene, however.
I've had some good times.''
In particular she remembers her first trip ''many, many years ago''
away with the Under-14 Scotland squad to Holland, where she won a gold
medal in the girls' doubles, and her first Commonwealth Games in 1986,
where she remembers the ''tremendous experience of being involved with
all the different sports.''
Sadly the demise of Travers, who is married to badminton legend Dan
Travers, is a sign of what lies ahead for Scotland's team. Jenny Allen
plans to retire after the World Championships, and other stalwarts could
follow suit.
Meanwhile three Scottish singles players and one pair have been given
places in the main draw of the All-England Badminton Championships,
which begin on March 13. Scottish champions Bruce Flockhart and Anne
Gibson, as well as Gillian Martin, will not have to qualify, while
Flockhart and Craig Robertson have been given a place in the main draw
of the doubles.
Scotland's Under-23 team to play Ulster at Bruce Street Hall,
Dunfermline, on March 9:
B Kinnaird (Kinross), L Dewart (Dumfries), S Watt (Penicuik), N Brown
(Howwood), B Hogg (Dunfermline), C Johnston (Grangemouth), A Dillon
(Dumfries), G Brockie (Edinburgh), K McEwan (Bridge of Weir), P
Whiteford (Airdrie), A Blanchflower (Glasgow), C McArthur (Glasgow).

ASTON Villa, who have been keeping a close watch on the form of Dundee
United and Scotland midfield man Billy McKinlay, will make a final
assessment of the player this weekend and will almost certainly then
meet the asking price of #1.5m.
Villa manager Brian Little, the man who succeeded Ron Atkinson, will
travel to Tynecastle on Sunday to watch 25-year-old McKinlay against
Hearts in the televised Tennents Scottish Cup quarter-final tie. This
follows frequent checks by other members of the Villa staff, who have
gone back south with glowing reports.
The original intention was to have McKinlay checked out in last
night's premier division match against Partick Thistle at Firhill, but
that mission was aborted early in the day when Little was told McKinlay
had no chance of playing, because of a calf-muscle problem.
Now the Villa Park manager will make the final decision when United
bid to keep a grip on the Scottish Cup they won for the first time last
May.
McKinlay would not take much persuading to make the south to one of
England's major Premiership outfits.
He has made it clear he wants to be playing his football away from
Tannadice and is pursuing a court action against United over the option
clause on his contract.
Villa, of course, could have opposition in the chase for the Scotland
star. Leicester City, struggling to stay in the Premiership, were hugely
interested until learning the asking price, but Newcastle United have
sent assistant manager Terry McDermott north twice to watch McKinlay.
They certainly have the money, as do Kenny Dalglish's Blackburn
Rovers, who can never be ruled out of any chase for a quality player.
* TWO Barbadians fly in today to join Meadowbank. Keeper Horace Stout
and midfielder David Alleyne have now been granted work permits to join
the club after a trial period at the end of last year.
But manager Mike Lawson said last night: ''They were both over here in
December and showed that they can take the cold, but I had better give
them a chance to get used to it.''
They will watch tonight as Meadowbank meet Stirling Albion. Graham
Davidson will have a late fitness test for Meadowbank while Stirling
will be without suspended defender Ronnie McQuilter.

Wimbledon 0, Man United 1
MANCHESTER United manager Alex Ferguson admitted his side scored a
''lucky victory'' to go top of the Premiership last night, but claimed
that Steve Bruce's controversial late winner was fair.
Referee Robbie Hart, who had already sent off Wimbledon left back Alan
Kimble for a second booking, sent Dons' manager Joe Kinnear away from
the touchline and also argued with the club's owner, Sam Hammam, in the
mayhem that followed the goal when Bruce took advantage of the ball
sticking in the mud before keeper Hans Segers could grab it.
Ferguson said: ''I believe the goalkeeper dropped the ball and Brucie
had every right to go for it. Whether or not he fouled the keeper in
doing it, we will only know when we watch the video.
''I think Wimbledon were complaining about the sending-off rather than
the goal.
''The pitch was like porridge and did not suit the game we like to
play. Also Wimbledon made things very difficult for us. They are just
the team you don't want to play immediately after winning 9-0, like we
did on Saturday. They did very well, especially their three central
players at the back.
''It's a lucky victory for us because we did not play well but it's a
good result and I am happy to be back at the top again.
''Something always happens when we come to this ground. The place is
full of it, but at least it was a quieter night than when we were here
before.''
Ferguson was referring to the match against Crystal Palace at Selhurst
Park in January when United's Eric Cantona was sent off and was involved
in an incident with a fan, and has subsequently been banned until next
October.
Midfield player Paul Ince was charged earlier yesterday by police with
attacking a fan during that same match and Ferguson admitted: ''I had a
few reservations about playing Paul tonight but in the end we were down
to the bare bones and I had little choice but to pick him. But I don't
think Ince was particularly affected by the situation tonight.''
United are now 8-11 for the title with bookmakers William Hill, who
quote Blackburn at 11-10, with Liverpool 16-1 and Newcastle 25-1.
* MIKE Galloway has withdrawn from Leicester's side for tonight's trip
to Queen's Park Rangers after having refused to spend another month on
loan at Filbert Street.

PAKISTAN'S cricket authorities said yesterday they had sacked national
team captain Salim Malik, who has been accused of offering bribes to two
Australian players last year.
A statement by an ad hoc committee running the Board of Control for
Cricket in Pakistan (BCCP) said Malik had been asked to explain his
conduct within seven days, during which he would remain suspended from
first-class cricket.
The BCCP statement, issued after an eight-hour meeting of the ad hoc
committee in Lahore, said a new captain and a team manager would be
named later for the team to play in the Sharjah Cup next month.
Malik was later seen leaving the meeting with an envelope in his hand.
He declined to answer reporters' questions and said he was going to
consult his legal adviser.
* BATSMEN Gary Kirsten, Andrew Hudson, and Hansie Cronje worked South
Africa into a strong position against New Zealand on the fourth day of
their Test in Auckland yesterday.
At the close South Africa were 232 for four, an overall lead of 198,
with Cronje not out 58 and Jonty Rhodes on seven. Kirsten hit 76 and
Hudson 64.
* SPINNERS Jayantha Silva and Muthiah Muralidaran bowled Sri Lanka to
an emphatic 242-run victory against a New Zealand Academy XI yesterday
in Palmerston North, New Zealand. The Academy side were dismissed for
205 chasing 448 for victory.
Left-armer Silva finished with five for 77 and match figures of 10 for
106, while Muralidaran's second-innings share was five for 56.
The victory gave the Sri Lankans a timely boost before the first Test
against New Zealand, starting in Napier on Saturday.

AMERICAN Gerald McClellan was yesterday showing the first signs of
regaining consciousness, 10 days after having been critically injured
during a world title fight with Nigel Benn.
The fighter's medication had been ''altered'' and McClellan was
''showing signs of responding,'' according to John Pullin, duty manager
at the Royal London Hospital. ''In the next day or so, hopefully he will
begin regaining consciousness,'' he added.
McClellan collapsed in the ring after being stopped in the tenth round
of the contest for Benn's WBC super-middleweight title at the London
Arena. Neurosurgeon John Sutcliffe performed brain surgery to remove a
blood clot.

COLIN McRae starts round three of the World Rally Championship in
Portugal this morning knowing that anything less than outright victory
may jeopardise his bid to become world champion.
Before January's Monte Carlo Rally many tipped the 26-year-old Subaru
driver from Lanark to win this year's 10-round series, but he had an
accident in the French Alps and engine failure during last month's
Swedish rally.
''Obviously, from the championship point of view, I need to get some
points -- as many as I can. The competition will still be very tough and
two non-finishes has not been a good start,'' said McRae.
In Portugal, his chances of winning are good. The three-day,
1700-kilometres rally will be fought out over 33 fast-flowing,
dirt-track special stages, where the former British champion should be
in his element, and his British-engineered four-wheel-drive Impreza
should be capable of out-performing the ''supercars'' of Toyota and
Ford, a comment endorsed by McRae's team-mate and Monte Carlo winner,
Carlos Sainz.
''Since we competed here last year the Impreza has become even
quicker. I think we now have the best car for gravel stages,'' said
Sainz.
The third Impreza is crewed by Reading's Richard Burns and Robert
Reid, from Perth.

SUSAN Gilmour, Heriot Watt University's international striker, has
been cleared to play for her club this afternoon against Bristol in the
semi-finals of the British Universities' championship at Liverpool,
thanks to red tape.
Gilmour picked up a red card in the course of the 4-3 defeat of
Liverpool side John Moores last week, when she spoke out of turn once
too often to the umpire.
University officials, however, surprisingly handed the case over to
the Scottish Hockey Union to administer. Under their rules Gilmour will
receive a two-match ban, starting from Monday. This clears Gilmour to
play against Bristol, but as the final is scheduled for next Wednesday,
she would miss out should Heriot Watt get the better of Bristol, whom
they beat in extra time in last season's final, and one domestic game.
However, the good news for Heriot Watt yesterday was the announcement
that Deeside Studio Architects of Aboyne are to sponsor the club. This
will help the players quite considerably to defray the cause of
competing in the finals of the A Division of the European Cup-winners'
Cup in Holland at Easter.
* THE SHU yesterday confirmed a number of changes to this weekend's
domestic programme because of the coaching seminar for the under-21s at
Largs by Dutchman Cees Kopelar.
The league matches on Saturday between Touche Ross and MIM and
Western's game with Menzieshill have been rescheduled for April 8, while
Sunday's cup-ties between Stepps and Touche Ross and Western's match
with Greenock have now been penciled in for March 19.

Timing, in sport, is every
thing. So it was with wry amusement yesterday that the UK media
listened to Professor Peter Radford, the British Athletics Federation's
executive chairman, as he outlined the sport's strategic plan for the
21st century.
Just 24 hours earlier, Linford Christie had stunned BAF by withdrawing
from the world indoor championships which begin on Friday. Yesterday,
Commonwealth triple jump record holder Ashia Hansen joined the defectors
from Barcelona. Of Britain's 12 Olympic, world, European, and
Commonwealth champions, the only one left to fly out with the team today
is veteran shot putter Judy Oakes -- who has retired more often than
Frank Sinatra.
Radford conceded that contracts with leading athletes are essential --
a given number of appearances, including major championships, for a
given fee and medical back-up. Contract proposals will form part of
Athletics 21, the plan for the Millenium. ''Contracts are not the
panacea for all ills,'' warned Radford. ''But they will reward athletes
with funding for planning their programmes properly.
''I would like all our top athletes to compete in the top events as a
matter of routine,'' he added, insisting that the UK team for Barcelona
was not a one-man band. ''We'll get along without you,'' he said of
Christie.
''If a superstar does not go, it's not the end of the sport. It's
actually the beginning, because doors are opened for those who would not
have had the chance. The team we took to last year's European indoor
championships wasn't, on paper, a terribly strong one.
''But one of the names that appeared was Du'aine Ladejo, who won the
400 metres gold medal and has since gone on to bigger things.''
The politics of envy have many people in Britain's clubs raging. They
see Christie making millions, and others like Sally Gunnell and Colin
Jackson following close behind. They can't understand why, with that
money in the sport, some clubs are on the verge of bankruptcy.
''What we have failed to get over is that if there were no Christies
or Jacksons, Gunnells or Yvonne Murrays, who can earn a good living,
there would be no money at all from TV or sponsors, nothing at all to
filter down,'' said BAF spokesman Tony Ward.
Britain's development as an athletics nation is being seriously
hampered by lack of a major stadium, says Radford. He is pushing for a
60,000-capacity stadium and believes that if we build one, Britain will
host either the world or European outdoor event within five years.
Despite being the fourth best track and field nation in the world,
there is no arena capable of hosting either event. Radford's plan sounds
the death knell for Crystal Palace, UK home for the sport since 1964,
and which only six months ago hosted the World Cup final. Its road and
rail infrastructure are hopeless and defy a solution.
* ENTRIES for the Scottish six-stage road relay championship, to be
held at Kirkintilloch a week on Sunday, close on Saturday.

MARTIN Heath and Peter Nicol set up an intriguing all-Scottish
second-round clash today in the Andersen Portuguese Open after
contrasting victories in Lisbon yesterday.
Heath pulled off a major shock, beating English internationalist Tony
Hands, who is ranked 21 places higher at No.17 in the world, in a
five-game battle.
Hands had beaten the 21-year-old from Oban twice in the British League
this season and moved into a 2-1 game lead. However, Heath rallied to
take the fourth game 15-4, and, in a tense decider, he fought back from
8-10 and 12-13 to win 7-15, 15-5, 7-15, 15-4, 15-13.
Heath said: ''I'm really looking forward to playing Peter, because I
didn't feel I did myself justice when I lost to him in the Scottish
championship final in December.''
Nicol wasted little energy. In just 37 minutes he beat Finn Juha
Raumolin 15-9, 15-6, 15-3.

THE houses we are building now are a legacy for future generations --
and it is vital that this legacy is an asset rather than a burden,
according to the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations.
At the Chartered Institute of Housing's Scottish conference at
Aviemore last week, the SFHA unveiled its blueprint for improved
construction standards for the next century.
It demanded that minimum standards, covering all new housing, should
be introduced to ensure that:
* Houses are built to standards of construction which will ensure that
they last.
* Space standards reflect the needs and demands of modern living.
* Houses are built to barrier-free standards, ensuring flexibility to
occupants' changing needs.
* Higher minimum standards of thermal efficiency.
* The future costs of maintenance are recognised at the outset.
Launching the document Homes for the Twenty-First Century, David
Alexander of SFHA said: ''Our campaign is intended to put design and
construction standards on top of the agenda.
''Pressure on funding has had the effect of providers having to make
short-term economies. We are calling on the Government to recognise that
the drive to contain public expenditure should not compromise quality.''

THIS French cottage has a history that goes right to the core of
Normandy's ancient cider industry.
The timbered stone-built house goes back to around 1800 when it was
constructed in connection with the local crop of Calvados apples. It
comes with three bedrooms, a large integral barn, about 1.5 acres of
land - and a splendid red rose bush.
Domus Abroad, based in Hampstead, London, are selling the property at
a fixed price of #62,500.
Meanwhile, the Homebuyer Show at Glasgow's SECC from March 31 to April
2 will harvest thousands of properties at home and abroad.

A unique snapshot of Scotland's life at home provides powerful
illustrations of the good, the bad and the blighted in the nation's
housing stock. Everything from suburban semis to the solving of rural
homelessness feature in People and Housing in Scotland, a major
photography exhibition sponsored by Scottish Homes.
The exhibition at Edinburgh's Stills gallery shows photographs
commissioned by Scottish Homes from Hannah Starkey, a graduate of Napier
University who now studies at the Royal College of Art in London.
It shows her personal view of developments in Scotland's housing. It
focuses on people and their environment in the inner city and in rural
areas, from the Borders to the Highlands and Islands.
Amateur photographers can put housing in the frame by submitting their
own images of how and where we live.
The best picture, judged by Hannah Starkey, will win a Canon Sureshot
camera from Scottish Homes.
Entrants should submit their snap, with their name, address and
telephone number on the back, to: Stills, 23 Cockburn Street, Edinburgh,
by March 23. No photographs can be returned.

THE Government's drive to create a ''flexible'' workforce is damaging
the property sector. The growth of part-time working, short-term
contracts, early retirement, and self-employment is freeing employers
from the idea of a job for life, and this growing uncertainty strikes
right at the heart of the mortgage system.
The ideal mortgage borrower is someone with a steady job, decent
career prospects, and a reasonable chance that he or she will continue
working for the next 25 years (the traditional mortgage term). However,
banks and building societies are beginning to realise that a sea change
in society is well under way, and every borrower could find his or her
mortgage put under the lenders' microscope.
Some groups could find themselves excluded from future loans -- or
paying highly for insurance against job loss.
A leading mortgage broker says: ''As soon as rumours started spreading
about the closure of Rosyth, lenders and insurers immediately pulled
their horns in and refused to consider anyone who worked there.
''Yet many of the highly skilled staff can now expect short-term
contracts for the rest of their working lives, and if they are to move
home to follow the work they will need to have mortgages. The current
system simply does not fit with today's work patterns.''
Ken Gibb of Glasgow University's Centre for Housing Research and Urban
Studies is monitoring the growing mismatch between career patterns and
the mortgage lenders' expectations.
He says that as the lenders become more adept at assessing risk, they
will increasingly restrict the groups to whom they are prepared to lend.
Meanwhile changes in income support rules introduced in the last Budget
will make life even more difficult for borrowers who lose their job.
''The Government's aim is to encourage individuals to take out their
own insurance against job loss or mortgage default, but who will insure
the young, the unskilled, or the self-employed?'' he asks.
Faced with an insecure workforce and its attendant risk of mortgage
default, the banks and building societies have three main options:
* They could insist on a higher level of personal indemnity insurance.
Insurers will resist the idea that they should only cover high-risk
groups. Such a move would also increase the cost of entry to home
ownership for the groups most at risk.
* They could vary the interest rate to reflect the increased risk
faced by some people: a low rate if your job is thought safe, a higher
rate if you face self-employment or short-term contracts.
* They could screen out those who seem to be the highest risk, thus
excluding substantial numbers of people from home ownership.
''Difficult trade-offs appear to face lenders,'' says Ken Gibb.
0 ''They have far less scope for protecting themselves with households
already on their mortgage book and facing a flexible labour market. The
most they can hope to do is to protect themselves against risk on new
loans.''
John Malone of Slater Hogg Mortgages says: ''This is the biggest issue
facing the mortgage industry. It seems likely that borrowers will have
to take on extra insurance and that will only add to the cost of house
purchase.''
He is ''reasonably confident'' that people such as nurses, teachers,
and lecturers will still be able to find a mortgage, as will skilled
workers in engineering and assembly who are fairly sure of only short
breaks between contracts.
''But such contract workers will probably find that their lender
insists that they pay more when they are working and less when they are
laid off,'' he says.
Within the next few years lenders will be using technology to provide
a detailed credit rating for every individual who applies for a loan,
according to Mike Provan, Scottish manager of the Halifax Building
Society.
''We will have to take a more relaxed view -- and take more of a risk
with some people.
''Contract staff -- nurses, engineers, or professionals -- would still
be seen as a good risk, but if a brickie walks off a Wimpey site at the
end of a job and starts flitting from one site to another, he won't have
a chance in hell of a mortgage.''
Whether they like it or not, an expansion of the private rental sector
seems the likeliest means of housing those in the workforce whose risk
level excludes them from the mortgage market.
Meanwhile, Mike Provan predicts a shift in the mortgage system.
''You'll see some changes later this year as lenders introduce new
products to take account of the widespread reduction in job security.''
There is an alternative. A couple of decades ago lenders were notorious
for their practice of ''red-lining'' particular urban areas on which
they refused to offer loans. At the stroke of a pen whole streets, or
even districts, were rendered ineligible for mortgages.
The brave new world of flexible work patterns could see the return of
red-lining.
This time it could be whole categories of the workforce who find
themselves red-carded from the mortgage game -- or paying much higher
for the privilege of being allowed to play.

EN-SUITE Jacuzzis or whirlpool baths are fine in their way, but for
the ultimate in luxury, just picture relaxing in bed watching the
flickering flames of an open fire. Or at least, the cleaner gas version
of the dusty original.
Few bedrooms can compare with Janette Miller's. The plasterwork rose
and cornicing put up when the block at 34 Keir Street, Pollokshields,
was first built has stood the test of time and remains intact. A large
double-glazed window allows the morning sun to flood the room, while at
night the fire glows in its wooden surround.
The corner cupboard is probably better described as a dressing room,
thanks to its walk-in space. It could even be used as a small office.
Recently re-decorated in a pretty rose covered paper with a matching
plain fitted carpet, the proportions of the bedroom could accomodate a
whole collection of Victorian furniture or a huge double bed.
''The room was probably a second public room when it was built,'' says
Janette. ''We use it as a place to retreat to when the television is on
in the main room. My husband plays his musical instruments here, or I
come and read by the fire.''
The sitting room is just as imposing and has an original fireplace
with a brass hood above a second gas flame fire. The cornicing here is
also complete and the double-glazed bay window has been given smart
cream drapes trimmed with green to match the fitted green carpet. The
plain cream walls emphasise the elegant proportions of the room.
The hall is no less spacious, with a large coat cupboard by the front
door. It could easily be used as a dining room for more formal eating,
though the kitchen has room for its own table and chairs.
Janette has given her fitted units a coat of pretty pale blue green
paint. It is perfectly matched by her table cover teamed with a white
Venetian blind at the window. The effect is fresh and stylish, with the
paint also used on the louvred doors of the cupboard that houses the gas
central heating boiler.
There is a built-in oven and hob set into dark wood-finish worktops.
The cream flooring makes the room feel fresh and welcoming.
Two other bedrooms in the flat are equally well proportioned and could
easily accomodate double beds. They have both been recently decorated
with pretty but understated papers and plain fitted carpets. These as
well as the the blinds will be included.
The bathroom is full of surprise cupboards that have been cleverly
designed to give the room a practical and uncluttered look. Warm pine
panelling and Laura Ashley paper have been teamed with a plain green
carpet. But behind the white suite concealed cupboards allow the cistern
and cleaning bottles to be tucked neatly out of sight. Even the pulley
is hidden in a panel in the timbered ceiling. Light filters through a
screen so that the lowered ceiling doesn't spoil the design of the room.
Janette is hoping to move to a house nearby but admits she will miss
the space of her flat with its large cupboards to comfortably house the
family clutter. And it's hard to imagine life without a bedroom fire
flickering away. Surely every home should have one.

YOU can't just sit back and expect tenants to do all the work involved
in finding a house to rent, says Ronnie Carpenter of Slater Hogg.
''A lot of our people are younger executives,'' Ronnie adds. ''They
know what they want. They have decided not to go in for house purchase
right away, but they definitely want quality, and they want full details
of whatever property interests them.''
Maybe this clearly pro-active policy in marketing properties to let is
why Slater Hogg even include travel directions in their letting spec
sheets, plus a colour photograph.
Take a penthouse flat at Lancefield Quay in Glasgow, for example. It
comes in at #850 a month, with enclosed parking that gives everyone
''lock it and leave it'' peace of mind.
Residents have an entry system, private main door entrance leading to
a hall, sizeable lounge/dining room with views over the Clyde, fitted
kitchen, two double bedrooms and a main bathroom.
Accommodation is on two levels, with gas-fired central heating, and
double glazing. And it's past Kingston Bridge, towards the SECC, and at
the side of the Broomielaw, if you were wondering.
More toward the West End, in the heart of Hillhead to be specific,
there's a rather splendid renovated blonde sandstone property, off Byres
Road.
That makes it handy for shopping, commuting and local amenities, but
it's the interior that takes the eye in this case.
''Quite stunning,'' says Ronnie Carpenter. ''Completely refurbished
internally. Everything in very high quality throughout. A private house,
where the owners are at present abroad.''
For #950, there is on offer here a ground floor position, private door
entry system, hall, large lounge, three bedrooms, kitchen and bathroom
with shower.
Full central heating, of course, top drawer decor and furnishings. It
combines the traditional values of a sandstone property with modern
interior styling. Viewing, by appointment.
Just a bit down in the price range, but just as enticing in its own
way, is what is known as a garden conversion in Dowanhill. Around #620
gets a ground floor property, in a most attractive B-listed building.
Access to private garden at the rear and shared gardens across the
street. All looked after for you: no digging or weeding involved. Again,
it's handy for the Byres Road and Hillhead amenities.
A private main door gives access to an outer vestibule, a large
lounge/dining room, and a rear hall leading on to two double bedrooms,
kitchen and bathroom. Full gas-fired central heating throughout.
For an out-of-town alternative, by the seaside, there is always the
pleasant choice of Helensburgh, and #475 can provide an upper conversion
of a well-kept detached villa.
Lots of traditional features. Equally up to date with electric central
heating. Entrance vestibule, hall lounge, two bedrooms, large kitchen,
and bathroom. All the mod cons.
There is a private garden, and a garage. Or you could commute to the
big city: say, 40 minutes.

A SCOTTISH building firm claims to have found evidence of a growing
demand for new homes suited for retirement age in attractive rural
areas. Walker Homes says that its recent development in Comrie,
Perthshire, has generated a steady stream of enquiries and visitors.
''In the 1990 Census, Comrie showed the second highest population of
the over-sixties in Tayside region and it fits many people's bill as an
ideal spot for retirement,'' says Walker's site sales executive Eleanor
McCowan. ''Many callers tend to be drawn from older age groups, and this
fits the profile of the local community.''
Meanwhile a major round of showhouse openings elsewhere in Scotland in
the past month has paid off, with the company reporting record sales
since the start of February.
Over the last three weeks, Walker has recorded sales of more than 50
houses across its 16 active sites in the Lothians, Fife, and Perthshire,
and sees this as an important indicator of market confidence among new
house buyers.
Says Walker's sales and marketing director Roberta Stewart: ''Our
showhouse opening programme has seen us open more in the first few weeks
of 1995 than we did in the whole of last year. We took this decision
because we believe the Scottish market is strengthening, and that buyers
are aware of the quality and value to be found in new house purchases.''

IN just three days time on Saturday, March 11, Adam Homes officially
open the first showhome in its Henderland Gate development at Bearsden.
The five-bedroomed ''Carnoustie'' detached villa will be completely
fitted, decorated and furnished so that people can picture it more
easily as a home, and the gardens will be fully landscaped. It is a
typical example of other houses on the development.
Decorum in Sauchiehall Street has carried out the interior design,
which includes ornate cornicing with some very unusual borders, and
while the woodwork is generally finished in white, the staircase
ballustrade is in natural wood.
The rooms in this home are generally much larger than usual, and even
touches like the double doors into the lounge, the patio doors in the
dining room, the wide hallways on both ground and upper level, and the
large ensuites all serve to give a feeling of space and airiness.
The attached double garage, with its glass patio doors has huge
potential as a den.
Already, between 150 and 200 people have put their names on a list for
notification about the showhome opening.
''We have to tell them as soon as the showhouse opens,'' said David
Nelson, managing director of Adam (Scotland) Ltd. ''They have been
coming for the past six months -- ever since the site was opened. These
houses are #200,000 each and most people who are spending #200,000 would
like to see the house before they part with that kind of sum.''
The popularity of the #6.5m development at Henderland Gate is very
much to do with the location. Situated at the end of Henderland Road,
just off the Switchback, but set in eight acres of landscaped
surroundings, it is both peaceful and accessible.
It is close to shopping and transport facilities, as well as being
within reach of the city centre.
There will be 43 units in all, comprising 15 luxury detached four and
five-bedroomed villas and 28 two and three-bedroomed flats.
These homes have been designed so that space is maximised both inside
and out. There are two blocks of flats in the development and already
more than half of one block has sold, even before the roof is on. Two of
the houses released in the first phase have also been sold before the
showhouse has even opened.
Apart from the prime location, David Nelson feels that the advance
popularity of the new development is the result of people reading the
brochures and discovering how spacious the flats and houses are.
In the five-bedroomed houses, for example, even the smallest bedroom
can take a double bed, and all the kitchens -- even those in the flats
-- have ample room to accommodate a dining table. All of the flats have
balconies leading off the lounge, most with a view.
The high specifications in terms of size and finishes are standard in
this development and the prices include many extras as standard, such as
fully fitted kitchens with oven, hob and cooker hood, fridge/freezer,
washer/drier and dishwasher, as well as moulded skirtings, facings and
panelled doors.
Each home is supplied with cable television, and there is an aerial
point in every room. The villas have living flame fireplaces and patios
leading to the gardens.
While the homes are ready to walk into, the developers are also
prepared to make any individual changes that a client might want.
Prices at Henderland Gate range from #98,000 for a two-bedroomed flat
and from #198,000 for the Braemar four-bedroom detached villa.
The anticipated completion date is spring 1996.

A SPECIAL package of buyer incentives has been introduced for Hanirose
Homes's Sherlock Park development in Wattston village, near Airdrie.
Launched six weeks ago, the development has attracted more than 250
inquiries and 15 homes have already been reserved. The developer claims
that the design for the estate was inspired by the spacious homes built
in Scotland during the Thirties.
Hanirose Homes is now including carpets, oven hob, cooker hood,
alarms, and landscaped gardens in the purchase price. The company also
offers #300 towards legal fees for first-time buyers and has arranged
reduced selling fees with Airdrie Property Centre.
Sherlock Park is a development of two, three, four, and five-bedroom
detached and semi-detached villas and bungalows ranging in price from
less than #50,000 to more than #100,000.
The estate will also feature a nursery, adventure playground, social
centre, fountains, tree-lined avenues, and traffic calming.

A GAP site in Partick is to be plugged, with 18 new flats to be built
by Barratt Construction.
The flats, which are for the rental market, are being built in Burgh
Hall Street for Nordam Developments -- the second project in an on-going
relationship between Barratt Construction and Nordam.
Roy Whitson, managing director of Barratt Construction, said: 'We are
delighted to have won this #740,000 project. The elevation is designed
to allow the building to blend into the existing tenements.''
Work is due to commence this month and be completed in December.

A BUILDING that mixes the old with the new in Glasgow's West End has
almost sold out. Westpoint Homes has sold 35 of the 39 flats at
Westbourne Grange in Kelvinside, although building started only a few
months ago.
The development, which is surrounded by a high wall, wrought-iron
railings, and mature trees, is a mixture of old and new. The former
Westbourne School for Girls's nursery building, which dates from the
1850s, has been converted into seven flats which retain period Victorian
features like ceiling roses and cornices. Thirty-two new apartments have
been built in the grounds.
The new flats have been designed to complement the original Victorian
House, with slate roof tiling and long, Victorian-style windows. They
are finished on all four sides in traditional reconstructed stone,
similar to the type used for the original building.
''We've gone to a lot of trouble to create something which parallels
the existing house,'' says Stephen Cullis, managing director of
Westpoint Homes. ''People have been impressed by our determination to
make the buildings fit with the local area. The most important features
have been the location, the high specification, and the attention to
detail throughout.''
Prices of the four remaining two-bedroom flats (all of them in the new
buildings) start at #89,500.

FOOTBALL is a grand old game for the nostalgia. Clubs will celebrate
everything. In the case of Celtic, Rangers, and Aberdeen there will
always be a ''wee do'' when the umpteenth anniversary comes around of
the day they won a European trophy.
Arbroath have already celebrated the 100th anniversary of the day they
set up a record score by beating Bon Accord 36-0 in a Scottish Cup tie.
And, no doubt, every team in the country will have earmarked a special
day in its history.
On Friday, Celtic will have cause for a special look back on one of
their most important anniversaries.
For on March 10, it will be 30 years to the day since Jock Stein had
his first match as manager of the club which, at the time, was an ailing
giant.
The deal to bring Stein back to Parkhead was done on the last day of
January, but it was not until March, when Hibernian found a successor
for him, that he moved in to take charge at Parkhead.
The first match under the Stein influence produced a 6-0 win over
Airdrie at Broomfield, with Bertie Auld scoring five goals.
That was a major turning point in the fortunes of Celtic, as well as
being a significant date in the calendar of Scottish footballing
history.
Stein, who previously had been known only as a defender with Albion
Rovers, was plucked from the obscurity of Welsh League football in 1951
to shore up a creaking Celtic defence.
He went on to captain the club with great distinction and then served
his manager's apprenticeship.
He emerged with honours from spells at Dunfermline (whom he led to
their first ever Scottish Cup triumph) and Hibernian, and then returned
to Parkhead to fulfil his destiny.
But even Robert Kelly, the club chairman, could never have envisaged
the success story he was helping create when he made the decision to
bring back the Big Man.
Of course, Stein was already a respected figure at Parkhead, a legacy
of his playing days.
He had led the side to a League and Cup double in season 1953-54 and
to an unexpected Coronation Cup triumph in 1953, when Celtic were
victors in a one-off tournament involving Hearts, Hibernian, Rangers,
Arsenal Manchester United, Newcastle United, and Tottenham.
Bertie Peacock, the Northern Ireland international wing half who
played alongside Stein, maintained that it was Jock who introduced
tactics to Scottish football.
''They were unheard of before he came to Parkhead,'' he said.
On retiring from the playing side, Stein worked with the Parkhead
youngsters, but it was only when he had left then returned as manager
that the public became aware of a footballing great among them.
The rest, as they say, is a history of glorious success that only
faltered somewhat after a life-threatening car accident.
The Big Man was never quite the same after that but, among footballing
people throughout the world, he still commanded the greatest respect
until his death in Cardiff on September 10, 1985, when he was in charge
of Scotland's World Cup squad.
The passing of time often enourages exaggeration of the quality of
events and personalities.
So to gauge the true and accurate picture of Stein the manager you
have to listen to the men who played under him, in their various
biographies penned while Stein was still involved in the game, or still
fresh in the memories.
JIMMY JOHNSTONE
Among the Maleys, the Chapmans, the Struths, the Busbys, or the
Herreras of big-time football, surely no name will be more guaranteed a
place high up in the history of the game than that of Jock Stein.
Those of us who have come under his influence know better than most
the qualities of the Big Man.
He is a mixture of warm friendliness, dour determination and hardness,
and, above all, he has the most astonishing knowledge of football and
footballers.
Football to a man like Jock Stein is not just a case of 90 minutes on
a Saturday afternoon.
It is a twenty-four hour a day job -- a job where everything is
planned down to the last-minute detail, where every problem is tackled
and eliminated, where pre-planning is as important as performance. (Fire
In My Boots).
Incidentally, one of Jock's favourite quotes was: ''When I retire
maybe I should be remembered not for the honours won, but for keeping
the wee man (Johnstone) in the game half-a-dozen seasons longer than he
might have been.''
BILLY McNEILL
If Jock Stein hadn't returned to Celtic in March, 1965, I hate to
think what would have happened to the club. It could have taken a
nosedive.
He certainly, quite brilliantly, averted a severe decline when he took
over from Jimmy McGrory. The Big Man went on to take Celtic to heights
that even he could not have thought possible.
Under the Big Man's guidance Celtic won a remarkable 25 trophies. The
European Cup, the first British victory, took precedence. But he also
led us to 10 championship wins, eight Scottish Cup final triumphs, and
six League Cup victories.
Big Jock was never complicated about anything he asked you to do. I
remember players who had been with other clubs, maybe with more
sophisticated coaches, thinking it was all too simple.
It WAS simple -- the basics. He never asked people to do things they
weren't capable of doing. He also recognised when he came to Parkhead
that he had a very talented group of people with whom to work.
He merely influenced them and introduced confidence. Players were
required to do things they enjoyed and the whole scene just opened up
like a flower in bloom.
This was the manager who transformed a club with a proud tradition and
a proud background into a club with a proud present and future and gave
it a reputation it would never have approached without him. (Back To
Paradise).
ROY AITKEN
Jock Stein's record will be in football folklore for the rest of time,
so it was something of an honour for my career to be fashioned at the
start by such a man.
Other young players envied those of us who were lucky enough to be at
Parkhead then.
Bertie Auld told us that Jock had all kinds of ways of finding out
what players were doing. On a Monday morning he would walk into the
dressing room and ask:
''Wasn't Sinatra great on BBC last night?'' Sure as anything somebody
would agree and Jock would pounce. ''He wasn't on the telly . . . where
were you when you should have been in bed?''
BOBBY LENNOX
When it came to team selections, Jock Stein was the most ruthless man
in the world. Yet as far as Celtic were concerned the ends justified the
means, as his methods brought unparalleled success while at the same
time ensuring that the players had a real hunger for the jersey.
It's an understatement to say that he ruled with a fist of iron and
that we were all in awe of him.
We would report to Parkhead on match days and wait in the dressing
room till he appeared, and no matter who you happened to be, no matter
how well you had played in recent games, there was no guarantee you
would play that day.
It had such an effect that when you heard your name on the team sheet
you couldn't get the jersey over your head quick enough to get out there
and prove yourself all over again.
My biggest lesson in that department came just before we won the
European Cup in 1967, and at that time I had been a regular.
It's got to be every player's ambition to play at Wembley --
especially against England. At the start of the week I had been named in
the national squad.
As we prepared at Seamill to play Dukla Prague in the semi-finals of
the Champions' Cup it was Jock Stein who brought me the news I would
play at Wembley -- and then told me I was dropped for the Dukla game.
I was good enough to play against the world champions that week (and I
scored) yet not good enough for my club.
But you accepted these things from Jock, because there was always a
good reason. (A Million Miles For Celtic).
It was William Shakespeare, who wrote in All's Well that Ends Well.
''Praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear.''
Every man who has since sat in the managerial chair from which Stein
once ruled has been well aware of the greatness they have been asked to
follow.
There have been five of them: Billy McNeill (twice), Davie Hay, Liam
Brady, Lou Macari, and Tommy Burns. Both McNeill and Hay enjoyed
success, but they never came close to gaining the legendary status of
Stein.
Now Burns is in charge and, strangely enough, finds himself in a
similar position to Stein.
He took over a club that was ailing badly and, while he has not
achieved the instant success of the man he once played under as a young
midfielder, he has the same burning ambition to restore pride.
TOMMY BURNS
''Following in the footsteps of Jock Stein at this club has been a
great motivation for me.
''He was a very single-minded man, who knew what he wanted for Celtic.
''If I can achieve even a fraction of what he did, I will be well
pleased.''
The roll of honour.

GOLF'S capacity for attracting -- and, so far, thankfully absorbing --
a ''bad press'' has to be one of sport's continuing mysteries.
The private clubs seem to be particularly susceptible in a way that,
for instance, seldom if ever is the lot of the equivalent institutions
in tennis and bowling.
True, there are times when the dottier and more spiteful rules and
customs enforced by some clubs fairly take the breath away.
Whatever outsiders think of them, however, these establishments do,
first and last, exist for the benefit of like-minded individuals, not as
some sort of experiment in social engineering.
The club with the all-male membership is the vogueish object of
obloquy, although a strange silence falls whenever reference is made to
the all-female clubs -- fewer in number, certainly, but there all the
same.
Somehow or other these sinks of politically incorrect iniquity keep
filling up, and few clubs do not have substantial waiting lists.
Nor do the country's prisons, apparently, and the governor of one of
them recently had his knuckles well and truly rapped after he had
proposed to have built for those detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure a
six-hole golf course at a cost of some #40,000.
The reaction was as horrified, and predictable, as if he had suggested
a Happy Hour for the inmates.
Swatheside Prison, on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, houses long-term
prisoners, and the Governor, Ron Tasker, was said to have claimed that
introducing golf as a pastime would be ''a way of relieving stress.''
Whereupon the wrath of senior officials of the Prison Service fell upon
his naive and unsuspecting head.
Amid such well-worn expressions of bureaucratic outrage as ''totally
unacceptable'', the Governor was reprimanded and the project abandoned.
The innocent bystander observing all this fuss was left to wonder if
similar reservations would have been applied to the furnishing of
facilities perceived as being less elitist.
Certainly, as a means of taking a prisoner's mind off the length of
his sentence or the dubious pleasures of slopping out or the prospect of
winning an extra ration of cigarettes, few tasks in sport can be claimed
to measure up to the concentrative imperative of having to hole from
four feet for the match on the last green -- even if it is only the
sixth.
Besides which, throwing or kicking a ball, although it would occupy a
smaller and less expensive area of the prison's gounds, surely does not
nurture or advance the need for self-reliance in the same proven way as
golf has demonstrated through the ages. The greater the personal
challenge, the fewer the number of recidivists, OK?
Anyway, there is a precedent, well-documented, for a golf course to be
constructed within a prison fence -- not at the British taxpayers'
expense, to be sure, for this one was built in Stalag Luft III, the
Second World War camp in Germany that housed captured British, American,
and Commonwealth air force officers.
The late Pat Ward-Thomas, for many years golf correspondent of The
Guardian, was one of the prisoners, and in his autobiography, Not Only
Golf, he graphically described how a hickory-shafted woman's mashie
somehow materialised.
It was restricted in use to those who could manufacture their own golf
ball -- usually a wooden core wound around with strips of rubber and
cloth.
Eventually, from various sources, real balls and more clubs arrived
through the Red Cross and a nine-hole course measuring some 850 yards
was laid out on levelled ground covered with sand, with browns for
greens.
The longest of the holes laid out around and over the accommodation
huts was 140 yards, the par was 29, and 57 for two circuits stood as the
record at liberation.
Such ingenuity and perseverance represented a triumphant rebuttal of
TS Eliot's patronising statements that ''all golfers are beyond
redemption'' and that ''the only monument to the godless will be the
asphalt road and a thousand lost golf balls.''
Didn't poor old Tom realise that golfingness was next to godliness?

THE Women Professional Golfers' European Tour has completed a
staggering deal with America Express that will be worth #3m to the Tour
over the next three years.
At a meeting in Oxford yesterday, Terry Coates, chief executive,
explained that the future of the Tour, which will be known as the
American Express Tour, has been secured with the sponsorship.
''Only two years ago we were almost bankrupt before a #50,000 grant
from the Royal and Ancient kept us going,'' said Coates.
''Our aim for a #10m tour by the turn of the century is now very
achievable.''
When Coates took over the reins two years ago, the Tour had a schedule
of only 10 tournaments. In a remarkable turnaround there are 19
tournaments this season, with prize money topping the #2m mark.
John Petersen, vice president of public affairs at American Express,
said: ''We have had lots of propositions from the men's tour, but they
did not meet our criteria.
''The Tour will provide an excellent opportunity for us to support
some of our key business partners while entertaining our major
clients.''
In the overall package, American Express will also become the official
card, travellers' cheque, and travel agent for the Tour.

BEDROOMS provide scope for the most adventurous interior designs --
freed from the practical constraints which apply in the kitchen and
bathroom, and from the need to keep up appearances for visitors in the
sitting and dining rooms, you can create a uniquely personal room.
The biggest challenge when re-decorating the bedroom is to find a
design which suits your lifestyle and personality, and to choose
furnishings and finishes which will provide lasting pleasure.
Don't make any major decisions or purchases until you have found a
style you want to develop and adapt for your bedroom. Start by looking
at as many interiors and furnishings as possible -- in books and
magazines, in films and on television, in museums and stately homes, and
in furnishing shops and catalogues. Without trying to reach any
conclusions, begin to pick out the looks that most appeal to you.
After a time you'll find that many of these have common elements --
perhaps they're all cosy and cluttered, for example, or cool and stark.
It may be that one colour, or family of pastel or primary colours keeps
attracting you, or that you are drawn to the atmosphere of a particular
period or country. The more influences you explore, the more quickly you
will form a firm idea of what you like.
A look at how some of the most famous interior designers set about
developing a style might help provide some inspiration. Before she wrote
the novels The Age of Innocence and The Buccaneers which have been
filmed for the cinema and television, Edith Wharton wrote about interior
design. Her book with architect Ogden Codman, The Decoration of Houses,
published in 1897, set a precedent and defined ''good taste'' -- based
on the laws of classical architecture. Codman designed a parlour for
Wharton in New York's Park Avenue, which is still regarded as a model of
proportion and harmony, and still widely copied.
New York interior design pioneer Elsie de Wolfe made her earliest
foray into interior design when she redecorated the house she shared
with wealthy theatrical agent Elisabeth Marbury. She was inspired to
bring ''light, air and comfort'' to the dark, cramped interior by the
writing of Wharton and Codman.
During the last two decades of the nineteenth century there had been a
general move among the upper classes towards restraint in interior
decoration, as the trappings of the resplendent mid-nineteenth century
parlour became available to their social inferiors through mass
production and a higher standard of living.
De Wolfe revitalized the interior by removing the gasolier, decorative
plates, oil paintings, rococo mirrors and jumble of oriental carpets,
lighting the rooms with sconces mounted against simple white-framed
mirrors.
She put a plain mirror and classical French bust over the mantelpiece,
covered the floor in a single, unpatterned carpet and painted the
woodwork pale grey. Both high society and literary and artistic visitors
were so impressed by her transformation of what had been a mediocre
interior, that she became the first professional decorator to design a
public interior -- the New York City Colony Club.
De Wolfe's interior design inspiration came from elegant rooms she had
seen in English country houses in the 1880s, where the bedrooms, private
dining rooms and libraries all had the same refined looks. The walls
were painted in pale tones, the furniture was slender and light, and the
large prints of chintzes added a country atmosphere.
The hallmark of Scottish architect and designer Charles Rennie
Mackintosh interiors is the use of bold contrasts between light and
dark. The furniture is also very carefully placed, revealing
Mackintosh's debt to Japanese house-design. He created an intimate
atmosphere in a dining room with sombre brown walls, which were covered
with coarse wrapping paper. Mackintosh is acclaimed today first as an
architect and second as a furniture designer, but it was as a designer
of interiors that he was best known during his lifetime.
After studying at the Glasgow School of Art, he was apprenticed to an
architect, eventually obtaining commissions from Catherine Cranston who
developed the tea-room business in Glasgow for the city's burgeoning
nouveau-riche clientele.
The bedrooms he designed for this prosperous class featured the floral
inspiration for which he is famous, and the main bedroom at Hill House
has white painted furniture and highlights of rose-coloured glass. The
freshness and simplicity of this Rennie Mackintosh bedroom can be
recreated today with relative ease, whereas if Victorian opulence is
your fantasy, your bedroom may have to grow into its chosen look
gradually as you find the right furnishings and decorative details.
Colour is probably the single most important design element in your
bedroom, since it affects not only the visual appeal of the room, but
also its apparent size and brightness, and the way you feel. Colours
have such a huge influence that they should be selected with care,
bearing a number of factors in mind. The one factor you can ignore is
fashion -- it's personal preferences that count.
Apart from the very personal feelings that colours arouse in us, some
have specific qualities which have much the same effect on everyone. Red
and orange in all of their variations are stimulating, while green
usually makes people feel calm. Colour can even influence our perception
of temperature, so that a blue room will feel cooler than a yellow one,
even if the thermostats show identical temperatures.
To make these characteristics work for you, choose warm hues in cool,
north facing bedrooms, and avoid vibrant exciting shades like orange,
which could make relaxation difficult. If you like strong, bright
colours, use them for small accessories rather than on the walls, where
they can overpower the room and its occupants.

Ross Finlay takes his time with the Carina E.
MANY years ago, as a wet-behind-the-ears rally navigator, I had the
excruciating experience of telling my driver, whom I had coerced into
parking at the side of the road as competitor after competitor hurtled
past, that I had been wrong in telling him we had plenty of time to
spare. In fact, my arithmetic was so out of kilter that we were already
into exclusion time. It was not a particularly cheery drive home.
Ever since then I have been quite careful about time schedules, for
instance in the RAC-supervised economy competition held during the press
launch of the new 1.8-litre lean-burn Toyota Carina E. For passenger
space, luggage volume and fuel economy, the 1.6-litre version is
unbeatable in its class, and much the same can be said of the new 1.8,
which comes with a choice of body styles and equipment levels, at prices
from #13,684 to #15,970.
With an output of 103bhp the 1.8 has a power advantage, but more
significant is the enhanced torque, which should please owners who like
the economy of the 1.6 but do not think much of its low-speed response.
The new car will accelerate to 60mph in under 12 seconds, and its test
track maximum is around 118mph. The four-door saloon has better official
economy figures, with remarkable returns like 57mpg at 56mph and 43 at
75, compared with 34mpg around town. All these, remember, with probably
the roomiest car in the class.
Theoretical figures are all very well, but Toyota decided to ask us to
test them on the road. A route had been arranged which took in some
long, fuel-sapping climbs in the Peak District, as well as country
lanes, town traffic, ordinary main roads and a short burst of motorway.
I had not meant to take the competition very seriously, but you know
how it is. My driving partner had been swotting up on what engine speeds
and throttle openings to use, so that the Carina engine would not be
tempted out of lean-burn mode, which it abandons at high revs. We talked
about holding fifth gear down to tooth-loosening vibration levels, and
trying to anticipate traffic and traffic-light situations, to avoid
involuntary halts -- accelerating away from a standstill soaks up fuel.
And I found myself making up time and distance tables, for our four-hour
schedule to complete the route just in time. There were penalties for
taking longer.
Things went well on the first half. We lost several minutes tackling
the Peak District gradients quite gingerly in thick mist, but gradually
pulled them back as we headed onto lower ground. At the halfway coffee
stop we were just three minutes ahead of target, and were pretty pleased
with our performance.
Then I overheard an opposition crew discussing their three hours and
20 minutes schedule. Funny, I said, we are on a four-hour schedule. Oh,
they responded, that was changed last night, did nobody tell you? Panic!
Instead of being three minutes ahead, we were now 37 minutes behind. The
memory of that long-ago rally disaster stabbed back at me.
In the second half, I was doing 60mph instead of 35mph or so along the
back roads, and when it came to a dual carriageway I was wafting along
at that speed which those of us who believe in fairy tales hope is OK,
because the gendarmerie may accept the possibility of a ten per cent
speedometer error. We arrived at the finish with six minutes to spare.
However, mark the sequel. Out of more than 20 crews taking part, one
pair of sneaks used freakish ultra-economy techniques to return 81mpg.
The second placed crew managed 61mpg. We were third with 58mpg.
Considering the scutter of our second half, I thought the result showed
that the 1.8-litre lean-burn Carina really does its stuff. And I cherish
the thought that, under different circumstances, ''I coulda been a
contender.''

WHEN the Buchanan-Smiths arrived in 1973, their first task was to pick
up the legacy of over 40 years of neglect since the Blair/Clark
Hutchisons left in 1930. It was done, however, and the first guests were
welcomed just a year later. The transformation over the years has been
remarkable.
For the active guest, the variety of things to do -- even setting
aside the latest indoor/outdoor complex -- means that every day can be
as full as you want to make it.
Choose from croquet, tennis, putting, pony riding, clay pigeon
shooting, water skiing, windsurfing, golf and walking, the list just
goes on. Exploring the island by foot is in itself an experience. It
takes around two hours to circumnavigate, the recognised routes being
marked by white poles.
You may even spot seals, otters and perhaps a badger. Roe deer are
also in evidence, as are sea birds and heron. If you are very lucky,
there may be a glimpse of a golden eagle.
A fortified dwelling east of the bridge dates back to around 200BC,
the earliest indication of human occupation of the island, and there are
records of three small dwellings existing there in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. By the end of the eighteenth century, just a
single farm existed. Its foundations are still visible.
The Isle of Eriska is, as the Buchanan-Smiths have always maintained,
a very special place.

James Currie takes the road to an impressive Isle.
THIS winter most of us have been perfectly happy to hibernate, letting
the worst rains (and latterly snow) of the past few weeks buffet the
gables as we thankfully curl up by the fire.
Others have been more active. Especially on the family owned and
managed Isle of Eriska, an enchanted 300 acres tucked away from public
view at the mouth of Loch Ceran, 12 miles north of Oban.
Built in 1884 to a design by architect Hippolyte Blanc, the Isle of
Eriska Hotel is an impressive red and grey sandstone 16-bedroomed Scots
baronial house.
There, the traditional winter peace masked a hive of activity as
tradesmen toiled to create imposing new indoor and outdoor leisure
facilities designed to propel the Isle of Eriska into the forefront of
the luxury sector of the country house hotel market in Scotland.
These will open later this month, giving the establishment a range and
quality of leisure pursuits that will be difficult, if not impossible,
to find elsewhere.
More impressive yet, is the extension of facilities apply to an
establishment already holding the Scottish Tourist Board's coveted
classification and grading of five crown deluxe. It was also one of the
original AA three red star hotels and holds two rosettes for cuisine.
Add to this the fact that it has been named regional hotel of the year
in the 1995 Which? Hotel guide and most recently hotel of the year in
the Macallan Taste of Scotland awards.
If all this wasn't enough, within the past year it became the first
business in Argyll to receive the Investors in People status and is a
SCOTVEC training centre. Impressive achievements by any standard.
The original owners were a branch of the Stewarts of Appin, but it was
later occupied by the Blair/Clark Hutchisons, who still play a leading
role in Scottish national life. They constructed the access bridge that
replaced the old ford, usable only at low tide.
The Buchanan-Smith family, who have built up an international
reputation for the Isle of Eriska since acquiring it in 1973, have
demonstrated a relentless capacity to follow one important step forward
with another.
Why? Beppo Buchanan-Smith, one of the partners, is credited as being
the driving force behind the new indoor/outdoor complex.
''These are the standards and facilities guests should expect to find
in an establishment such as this,'' he commented.
''Tomorrow is a new ball game. Those in the industry who don't prepare
for it and don't offer guests what they want are unlikely to survive
into the next century.
''What the Isle of Eriska now has to offer in terms of the range of
things to do is second to none. This will enable us to be open all the
year round and to extend the possibility of corporate seminar and
incentive business.''
The new facilities are housed in an area which once encompassed the
stables and a walled garden. The centrepiece is a 17 metre swimming
pool, complete with spa. It has all the most modern equipment installed,
including level decking and ozone water treatment, with adjacent sauna
and steam rooms.
In the same building is a reception area, well-appointed gymnasium and
a relaxing lounge overlooking the pool itself.
Look outwards and there are splendid views over the golf course and
across Loch Linnhe to the point of Appin and the mountains of
Kingairloch.
The swimming pool was designed and built by Penguin Swimming Pools
Limited, one of the leading companies of its type in the UK.
Previous Penguin projects include the facility at the Belfry Hotel and
its ''jewel in the crown'', the pool and spa project in the West
Midlands which last year won three Spata gold awards, including the
sought-after ''Dick Millward Pool of the Year Award''.
Penguin director Geoff Davis declared himself delighted with what has
been achieved at the Isle of Eriska.
''This takes us right to the top of the market in Scotland and we have
been greatly impressed by the enthusiastic attitude of the
Buchanan-Smiths,'' he said.
Between the pool complex and the lochside lies the golf course. ''At
the moment it is a very challenging and picturesque nine hole par three
course,'' said Beppo Buchanan-Smith. ''Just two of the existing holes
are over two hundred yards and it will take up to five years to develop
the course to its full nine hole potential, but situated as it is,
hugging the northern and western shores of the island, it is difficult
to imagine a more compelling or delightful setting for any such links
course.''
Beppo Buchanan-Smith joined the management team of his parents, Robin
and Sheena Buchanan-Smith, three years ago as part of a plan to hand
over to the next generation of the family. The facilities opening this
month reflect his influence and the family is confident that what has
been achieved bodes well for the future of the Isle of Eriska.
The entire management team acknowledge the imaginative financial
support received from Argyll and the Islands Enterprise Company whose
active involvement and ''sympathetic pump priming'' of a major tourist
development in Argyll helped turn an imaginative plan into reality.

ONLY one group of people seemed happy yesterday at the near-trebling
in pre-tax profits to #1859m at Barclays -- that was the very senior
management.
Even shareholders, who are benefiting from a 39% leap in the dividend
total to 21p with a second interim of 13p, seemed unamused with the
shares dropping 23[1/2]p to 582[1/2]p, while the reaction to the staff
to a 7[1/2]% profit share and a small pay offer is well known.
Boardroom costs have dropped 18%, partly reflecting the slashing of
bonuses at BZW although the details are held in abeyance until the
annual report emerges on April 5.
The profits impetus came the #1267m reduction in bad-debt provisions
to #602m where Barclays is following the Bank of Scotland in making a
general provision against debts and at the beginning of each loan rather
than waiting to see what turns up during its life as is the traditional
banking practice.
That will smooth future provisioning and should avoid too may
unpleasant shocks and so there has been a #74m rise in the general
provisioning to #850m despite an overall contraction in the global loan
book.
To be fair, chief executive Martin Taylor is already well on his way
to achieving his objective of making much more efficient use of the
bank's capital -- some #6500m of shareholder funds. And if there is no
profitable use for it be repaid through dividend or else through share
buy-backs.
Some low-performing assets have been sold and risk exposure reduced as
was shown with the shrinking of the amount of capital allowed to BZW in
the second half of last year. That resulted in the securities house
seeing its contribution slumping from #532m to #242m of which just #48m
occurred in the second half of 1994.
However, BZW has had a much better quality of earnings over the years
than its parent and Mr Taylor was regretting yesterday that he had
clamped down too hard on its capital base.
Predictably, chairman Andrew Buxton, who was almost completely
overshadowed by Mr Taylor, emphasised that Barclays had started a
serious review of its controls in the wake of Barings.
While BZW is not yet a truly world-class player, it seems most
unlikely that it will make an American acquisition as there is an
obvious caution based on past history where many securities industry
mergers have imploded. The profits setback was caused by a slump in
dealing profits while equity business was barely profitable in the
closing months.
Barclays has still problems to resolve such as France where there is
the prospects of a hefty restructuring charge in 1995 and growing
Barclays Life where there has been a #27m charge in addition to the #31m
hit in 1993 on mis-selling of pensions.
Customer advances in the UK have been chopped by 8% where the only
buoyancy has been in mortgages where margins have widened. The only
other increase in lending has been to other banks -- the phenomenon
throughout the industry of taking in each other's washing.
Barclays now gives the impression of being the most brilliantly
financially engineered of the banks but it is difficult to see where
growth from banking, as opposed to BZW, will come from.
But by coming from outside the industry, Mr Taylor is able to adopt
business principles with a much more assured touch than an
internally-appointed chief executive with the question of the bank's
size an irrelevancy.
Current year profits should reach about #2100m, depending upon BZW and
the size of the French losses. That should allow a further increase in
the dividend to at least 25p for a 5.4% yield.

SHARES in banknote printer De La Rue plunged 143p to 889p yesterday
with the City unforgiving of what some analysts thought was merely a
prudent trading statement.
Announcing its intention to sell the non-security papermaking
operations of recent acquisition Portals, De La Rue said there had been
a further deterioration in the profitability of German-based Garny which
supplies banks with everything from machinery to desks.
Although the banknote order book remains strong, De La Rue stressed it
was not at the record levels achieved this time last year.
The market capitalisation of the FTSE-100 stock plunged through the
#2000m level, from #2311m to #1991m, after De La Rue forecast only
modest growth in headline earnings per share in the year to March 1996.
Portals is not expected to enhance overall earnings per share until
the following financial year.
De La Rue, which also specialises in cash-handling and transaction
systems, expects earnings per share in the second half of the current
financial year to be as high as in six months to March 1994. This would
produce a full-year increase of at least 14.3%.
The group said it had received many unsolicited approaches about the
Portals businesses which do not fit into its vertical integration plans.
De La Rue's #670m bid for the banknote paper manufacturer was declared
wholly unconditional early last month.
Tea-bag paper producer J R Crompton, which turns over #42m annually,
is the largest of the businesses up for sale. Next biggest are
environmental services and water treatment company Houseman, with an
annual turnover of #27m, and French-based Ermeto-Hydexco, which produces
tubes for the motor industry and turns over #20m.
Another five businesses, with sales of between #1m and #15m, are also
on the market.
One analyst expressed surprise at what he called a ''mammoth
overreaction'' by the market to yesterday's news.
However, another said: ''The company's on a very high rating -- a 30%
premium to the market -- so there's no margin for error.''
Some investors apparently decided to take profits, with the initial
excitement surrounding the Portals bid having subsided and with De La
Rue shares perhaps overpriced in the short-term.
Returning to Garny, De La Rue said its worsening profitability had
been offset by improvements elsewhere. A dilution of earnings as a
result of the acquisition of Portals, as well as the disposal of the bid
subject's non-core businesses, had been expected.
De La Rue chief executive Jeremy Marshall said: ''Now that we have
taken management control of Portals, we have initiated plans to realise
the opportunities for profit improvement which we had previously
identified. We are much encouraged by what we have seen thus far.''
During the six months to September, De La Rue's pre-tax profits before
exceptionals were 29% ahead at #72.8m. In its last financial year, the
company, which is part of the Camelot consortium which runs the National
Lottery, raised profits by 24% to #129.8m.

SCOTTISH meat wholesalers, fishmongers, bakers and ice-cream
manufacturers who hope to become suppliers to the Edinburgh
International Conference Centre got their chance to pitch for business
yesterday.
The catering franchise at the centre has been won by Leith's, the
London-based catering company headed by cook and writer Pru Leith. She
was at the Royal Highland Showground, Ingliston, near Edinburgh
yesterday to meet 30 potential suppliers who came along to display their
wares.
Ms Leith said she was very keen to use Scottish suppliers for the
exhibition centre contract. ''It's not just roast beef, bashed neeps and
haggis we are interested in,'' she said. ''We want to produce modern
British cuisine -- using Scottish commodities.'' She was supported
yesterday by Mr Nick Bryan who will be head chef at the conference
centre.
Most of the people who turned out yesterday would probably be given a
chance to supply the conference centre kitchens, provided they could
meet Leith's demands for quality and delivery, she said.
''We need flexibility. Our order could be 1000 bread rolls one day but
only six the next. We want to use fresh ingredients so we don't have big
freezers. Our suppliers have to be able to deliver to our
requirements.''
She was confident that her conditions would be met, however. ''When we
catered at Meadowbank for the European heads of state meeting in
Edinburgh we required deliveries three times a day and we got it. A
local fishmonger was delivering fish at 2am.
Since winning the conference centre contract Leith's have also become
caterers for Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise. They will also provide
the food for the Royal Scottish Academy dinner in May.

COMPANIES which sail close to the wind in making claims for forage
additive products, used in silage-making, could face disciplinary action
from their trade body.
Mr Jim Reed, director-general of the United Kingdom Agricultural
Supply Trades Association (Ukasta), said that his organisation was
determined to make a success of the forage additives assessment scheme
which was now ''up and running''.
''In Ukasta, we feel we have a wider responsibility to the farming
industry to get this right,'' he said. ''We are not going to be driven
off course.
''We will not hesitate to discipline companies who overstep the mark.
We are absolutely determined to make this scheme work if we possibly
can,'' he told a news conference in Renfrew.
The forage additive market is an important one in financial terms,
estimated to be worth up to #120m a year. The Ukasta scheme is aimed at
assessing the efficacy of products offered for sale to the farmer.
The choice is wide. So far 107 distinct products have been registered.
Out of that total, 50 have been approved and tested for efficacy and
have passed in at least one category of the scheme. Twelve have
submitted data but have not yet been approved and 45 have simply been
registered but have not yet submitted data.
By the end of this year the association hopes to be able to indicate
which products have passed laboratory tests and which have undergone
practical tests in silage-making and livestock feeding trials.
''The next few months will be crucial for the scheme. There is
increasingly fierce competition between manufacturers and distributors
in this field,'' said Mr Reed.
It was important, he said, not just to do a laboratory check to prove
that a product contained what it was said to contain. ''We have to
ensure it does the job on the farm. That is what product monitoring is
all about,'' he added.
''If we can publish our lists showing category approvals and product
monitoring results I believe Ukasta will have done a great service to
the industry. We will have shown that our industry can organise itself,
police itself and deliver the goods to the farmer.
Mr Reed said that so far there had not any cases of any manufacturer
seriously overstepping the mark. ''Some people have been spoken to and
have perhaps withdrawn advertising which was felt not to be in
accordance with the scheme,'' he said.
''Ultimately we could deny someone registration under the scheme but I
am hopeful it won't come to that.''

TI GROUP had a strong year in 1994, with profits up 18% at #148m
before exceptional items, and dividends are raised by 7% to 12p after a
final of 7.95p.
All divisions moved forward against a background of strengthening
demand. The trend is continuing and order books have been boosted across
the board. TI's financial position has also improved sharply, with
gearing an underlying 13%.
But chairman Sir Christopher Lewinton made it clear the group was not
about to embark on an acquisition spree. Rather it will continue with
its policy of recent years of making bolt-on acquisitions when the
opportunity arises.
TI also has some non-core activities which it will sell when it can
get a good price, but there is no hurry. These are mainly old TI
companies, some of which, like Apollo and Matrix, are well-known names
in the engineering industry.
John Crane and Bundy performed well, with profits up 17% to #72.2m and
27% to #58.4m respectively on the back of the upturn in the US
automotive market and recovery in Europe.
Dowty Aerospace improved 17% to #30.2m and its prospects are picking
up. The landing gear business has 37% of the world market and is seeing
an increase in orders. This year sees the start of the big contract for
the American F-18 fighter aircraft.
Though the results were at the top end of expectations, TI shares
slipped 6p to 344p.

RENTOKIL, whose businesses include pest control and tropical plants,
continues its impressive growth record with the prospect of more to
come, according to the company.
Last year taxable profits rose by 20.4% to #177m on 22% higher
turnover of #734.6m. Chief executive Clive Thompson is sticking to an
aim of 20% annual growth for the company.
The company has grown rapidly through a series of acquisitions around
the world in recent years. This looks set to continue with the
possibility of a major acquisition which will enable it to maintain its
impressive earnings growth.
''We are always looking for good buys, no matter what size,'' said Mr
Thompson. It is well placed financially to make a purchase given its
#67m cash pile and unused loan facilities.
Within the UK, turnover grew by 31% to #323.4m and profit by 28% to
#76.9m. There were particularly strong performances from the security,
cleaning services and communications businesses.
Recovery in Continental European economies and Australia, coupled with
continued strength in its UK and US markets, augurs well for Rentokil's
business in 1995. There is a final dividend of 2.44p, making 3.45p for
the full year, an increase of 21%.
Rentokil shares were 3p lower at 218p although they are viewed by many
City analysts as a quality long-term investment.

<TEXT>
GLASGOW-based assured tenancy company Westscot Homes raised the
prospect of an ultimate Stock Exchange listing through a low-cost
Introduction, as it urged shareholders to reject a takeover bid by Neill
Clerk Residential.
Chairman John Loughray said the company was actively considering
acquiring a portfolio of industrial and commercial property assets,
investments in the leisure sector and the acquisition of, or merger
with, other assured tenancy Business Expansion Scheme companies.
He claimed the Neill Clerk offer was misconceived and undervalued
Westscot's shares.
However, Mr Loughray added that it was the company's policy to give
those shareholders who wished to do so the chance to dispose of all or
part of their holdings at full value.
At an extraordinary general meeting early last month, dissident
shareholders seeking an exit route through the liquidation of Westscot
abandoned their motion, pending the outcome of the intervening offer.
The bid by Neill Clerk Residential, a unit trust vehicle managed by
Neill Clerk Capital, offers units worth 126p for every Westscot share.
However, shareholders disposing of their entire holdings within two
months of Neill Clerk gaining 100% control would receive only 96p a
share.

TROUBLED pharmaceuticals group Fisons is endeavouring, as so many
other companies have done, to divest itself of those operations which
are not pertinent to its core activity and, indeed, in some cases have
proved disastrous.
This was certainly true of its loss-making scientific instruments
business, the sale of which was announced last week to Thermo Instrument
Systems of the US for #202m to the market's relief.
The company yesterday announced a #463.7m loss before taxation for
1994 after exceptional items such as a write-off of #278.6m in goodwill,
mostly down to the sale of its scientific instruments business, and a
charge of #220.6m for restructuring the pharmaceutical division.
The group is also set to sell its laboratory supplies division, which
last year achieved an operating profit of #20.8m on sales of #511m.
Fisons said it not yet possible to indicate how these discussions may be
concluded.
Before exceptional items, operating profit increased 17% from a
restated #64.6m to #75.5m and at the pre-tax level, again before
exceptionals, profits amounted to #54.2m. The company is paying a final
dividend of 2.6p to give an unchanged total of 4.3p, payable out of
reserves.
Fisons intends in future to concentrate its resources on its
pharmaceuticals business which in 1994 achieved an operating profit
before exceptionals of #64.3m on sales of #475.5m.
It points to the company's leading position in the treatment of
respiratory diseases, in particular asthma, and its global sales network
specialising in respiratory diseases.
The company will also be looking to secure additional products by
licensing, by collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies and,
where appropriate, by acquisition in order to obtain greater efficiences
from its sales network.
But one key factor constraining profitability is the very high level
of expenditure on pharmaceutical and development in relation to Fisons'
''modest'' position within the industry.
At #79m last year, this represented almost 17% of sales. Negotiations
aimes at reducing the burden of this cost on Fisons' shareholders are in
hand. So it looks as if strategic alliances to spread costs will play a
key part here.
Stuart Wallis, who became Fisons' chief executive on September 1 last
year, said: ''The next stage of the group's development will aim to
capitalise on the significant strengths in sales and marketing and
research and development.
The changes taking place within the industry are undoutedly increasing
the number and scale of opportunities for positive collaboration,
whether this is in respect of markets, products, or therapeutic areas.''
Equally, of course, when Fisons has cleared the decks it might be
considered a more tasty morsel for one of the bigger drugs groups,
possibly Zeneca.
Zeneca is widely believed to have walked away from Wellcome which was
a much more expensive prospect than Fisons. The shares dipped 3p to
147p.

DIAMOND multinational De Beers yesterday revealed pre-tax profits down

Its Central Selling Organisation sales came under increasing pressure
during the year with an 8.4% setback in the second six months so that
the full-year total was 2.7% lower at $4250m. This has resulted in
diamond profit margins declining from the interim level of 15.2% to
13.8% because of the need to build up stocks to maintain a stable

PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, regulator of the electricity industry,
created havoc yesterday when he said that a further look at prices
charged by the English regional electricity distributors might be
necessary.
He considered that the strength of the distributors' shares suggested
that the pricing regime announced just seven months ago -- and which was
supposed to last five years -- was too lax.
Many shares in the sector slumped by at least 20%, with Northern
Electric falling 158p to 905p on fears that Trafalgar House might be
forced to withdraw its offer, which is due to close on Friday.
Faced with the collapse of its share price, Northern had little option
but to recommend the #11-a-share bid, which is now looking
over-generous. Trafalgar can withdraw right up to the close of the offer
but could then not bid again for a year.
Another bid prospect, Yorkshire, crashed 180p to 661p. Investors in
the part-paid shares in National Power and PowerGen saw their
opening-day premiums almost disappear as the shares fell 9p to 189[1/2]p
and 10p to 176[1/2]p respectively.
Professor Littlechild stressed that his comments did not apply to the
English generators (nor the Scottish companies) but it would be naive to
think that it would not have had a major impact on the Government share
sale had his announcement come two weeks ago. He has introduced
uncertainty to the whole industry.
How much the Government knew before hand is unclear but the timing of
Offer's statement begs many questions.
The random nature of Offer's pronouncements means that electricity
shares, far from being suitable for widows and orphans, for whom utility
shares delivering steady income growth related to the expansion in the
economy are ideal, are volatile and risky investments.
The shares of the English regional electricity companies have
ballooned skywards because the earlier regulatory regime was indeed too
lax from the consumer's viewpoint, enabling the companies to achieve
high profits growth and pay very large dividend increases, sometimes 10
times the rate of inflation.
Now Professor Littlechild appears to be trying to make up for past
errors by clobbering the companies with an out-of-the-blue statement
about possible changes in the pricing regime.
The new openly assertive approach by Offer was revealed when Professor
Littlechild forced a delay in the pathfinder prospectus for the National
Power and PowerGen when he said in late January that he was keeping an
eye on the two generators in view of the high prices in the pool or
wholesale market.
The Treasury and its advisers made little attempt to hide their
irritation at Professor Littlechild's timing and Offer itself gave the
impression the timing was no accident but was meant as a reminder of the
regulator's power.
Now he has done it again, indicating that he could impose one-off
changes to the price cap for individual companies. It must be doubtful
if he appreciated the impact of this on the electricity shares.
The stock market had not unnaturally assumed that the regulatory
review of last August had set the framework for the next five years. OK,
five years is a long time and it would have been sensible for the market
to build in the possibility of some sort of interim change after two or
three years, but to herald changes just seven months after the review
smacks as much of incompetence as macho regulation.
Professor Littlechild said yesterday that he wanted to understand why
the stock markets thought the regional electricity companies were worth
a lot more now than last August. Surely by now Offer should have a team
of analysts sufficently versed in the industry and how it is valued by
the stock market to provide more accurate information on which to base a
pricing regime. They have access to much more information than the City
of London's analysts have to go on so there simply is no excuse.
As soon as the August review was announced, the electricity sector
jumped with joy at the leniency of Offer's regime and has not looked
back -- until yesterday. It was obvious at the outset that the regime
could have been tougher. As soon as this was apparent Professor
Littlechild should have swallowed his pride and acted immediately.
Now the companies are back in a position where they cannot plan for
the future. They operate in an industry with long-time horizons and not
knowing what their regulator is going to say from one month to the next
puts them in an impossible position.
Arbitrary decisions by the regulator mean that the companies become
impossible to value which is unfair to shareholders and creates the
possibility of a false market in the shares.
It is right that any regulator should be somewhat of a thorn in the
side of the industry he or she regulates. But the industry has a right
to expect consistency and competence otherwise it cannot be as efficient
as it could be. There must be some element of respect on both sides.
Professor Littlechild has now forfeited almost everyone's respect and
should step down.

WELLCOME bowed to the inevitable yesterday and accepted Glaxo's
hostile #9400m bid which will make the combined company the largest
pharmaceutical group in the world.
Wellcome's defeat was inevitable given the initial acceptance of the
Glaxo offer by the Wellcome Trust which owns 40% of Wellcome. This
effectively left Wellcome to fight with one hand tied behind its back.
There were only a few companies who were of sufficient size to be able
to counterbid and in the end they decided not to. Wellcome said that one
potential bidder, widely thought to have been Zeneca, had been ready to
offer more than Glaxo, provided the Wellcome Trust took steps to assure
a good chance of success.
Wellcome requested the Trust to do so on the basis that it risked
breaching its agreement with Glaxo. Swiss group Roche declined to
comment on rumours that it had dropped out of the bidding on Sunday
night.
Sir Richard Sykes, deputy chairman and chief executive of Glaxo, said
he was ''very pleased'' by Wellcome's decision. ''The decision paves the
way for management and employees of both companies throughout the world
to begin working together in a spirit of co-operation to create Glaxo
Wellcome as a world-leading research-based pharmaceutical company,'' he
added.
Sir Richard remains confident that the final condition of its offer,
US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approval, would be met in the near
future. Talks between Glaxo and the FTC are said to be making
satisfactory progress.
Wellcome said that it had received assurances from Glaxo that it
intended to be ''fair and objective'' when integrating the two
businesses. As a result, Wellcome said it will co-operate fully with the
process.
John Robb, chairman and chief executive of Wellcome, said that ''it is
obviously disappointing that neither of the two remaining potential
counter-bidders decided to make an offer''. He added that he believed
Glaxo would be acquiring Wellcome ''at a very attractive price''.
The stock market agreed and in early heavy trading pushed up Glaxo
shares by 40p to 688p. Zeneca shares gained 20p to 864p. Glaxo's offer
for Wellcome expired today.
City analysts believe that Glaxo's shares could reach 800p within the
next 12 months on the back of the deal and were busy recommending the
shares. Steve Plag, pharmaceuticals analyst at NatWest Markets, said
that the combination of organic growth plus significant cost savings
should result in a group which shows earnings growth superior to that of
the index.
Rationalisation of research in the UK and US, manufacturing and sales
operations could save Glaxo as much as #1000m. A key year in the
fortunes of the enlarged group is thought to be the year to end-June
1988 when there could be cheaper generic competition to Wellcome's
herpes drug Zovirax and probable generic versions in the US of Glaxo's
anti-ulcer treatment Zantac.
Several Wellcome employees potentially stand to make serious money if
they exercise share options following the takeover. Wellcome's annual
report shows that there are 48 million share options outstanding for
Wellcome employees.

DUTCH banking and insurance giant Internationale Nederlanden Groep
(ING) yesterday suffered its first Barings defections following the
go-ahead on Monday for its takeover of the business when 11 Tokyo-based
research analysts were poached by securities house Smith New Court.
Smith New Court had been granted full membership of the Tokyo and
Osaka stock exchanges on Monday and its deal with the Barings 11 looks
to have been put on hold since Sunday ahead of the bid agreement with
ING.
Barings sought to play down the move, describing the bank as a pretty
tight ship since the collapse and stressing that it was just the usual
merry-go-round between securities houses. It is, of course, true that
securities houses do raid each other now and again to gather in instant
expertise.
Smith New Court has itself been the subject of bid rumours in recent
weeks, fuelled to some extent by speculation that N M Rothschild may be
ready to sell its 27.5% stake. However, Rothschild has denied that it is
to unload the shares.
Obviously Barings has been of keen interest to headhunters since the
bank's collapse with losses in the Far East of #860m. But on Monday ING
chairman Aad Jacobs was anxious to encourage the bulk of the staff to
stay -- the Bank of England investigation into the Leeson affair will
doubtless be instrumental in singling out some who may not. And ING has
agreed to honour some #90m of bonuses though payments will be made on a
deferred basis through the year.
The Barings team which has defected to Smith New Court includes
highly-rated analysts covering the chemicals, electronics, smaller
companies and market strategy sectors.

yesterday.
ICL, owned by Japan's Fujitsu and the Canadian firm Northern Telecom,
said it had nearly completed its restructuring programme and reduced

''We have grown the business and won a large number of major new
contracts in spite of strong competition and the expected pressure on

Robert Carlyle takes off on another beautiful tangent this month in
Hamish Macbeth, his latest television drama. Allan Laing talks to an
actor who relishes the challenge of new roles.
ROBERT Carlyle gives good mental bald headbanger. Before Woody
Harleson had even considered his trip to the ultimate barber, the Scots
actor had shaved his head and gone famously berserk with a blade in
Cracker.
Robert Carlyle gives good gay. In Antonia Bird's Priest, a devastating
movie soon to be unleashed upon Scotland, he is utterly convincing as a
young homosexual lover.
And Robert Carlyle gives good crucifiction. In the first episode of
ITV's 99-1, a gangster with a neat line in Gothic nailed him to a wall
and let him slowly bleed to death.
In short, Robert Carlyle gives good acting. No, not just good. Robert
Carlyle gives fine acting. He is a chameleon, all things to all roles.
Somewhere along the line he must have gone to business school because,
like some wised-up business corporation, his ethos is ''diversify to
accumulate''.
There are two chances of this actor ever being stereotyped -- slim and
none. His theory, which is to be applauded, is that being different at
every available twist and turn serves to lengthen an actor's shelf life.
There is every reason to believe that he'll still be going strong long
after many of his contemporaries have reached their sell-by date.
Later this month, Carlyle bounds off on yet another beautiful tangent
with Hamish Macbeth, BBC Scotland's major network drama in which he
plays an off-the-wall copper, a hippie with handcuffs, in a sleepy
Highland village. He sees the character, not so much as a policeman, but
more as the sheriff in a one-horse town. The series is good; very good,
in fact. But it does owe a debt of gratitude to both Whisky Galore and,
just perhaps, Local Hero.
''I'm really very pleased with the way it has worked out. It's
different; it's not like a conventional police show. Hamish Macbeth's
way of dealing with problems and crimes is to try and talk them out
rather than physically arrest people. He is not a hard man,'' he
explains.
There is, he thinks, only one car chase in the entire series. And it
involves a caravan travelling at 10mph along a country road. He admits
that there is an element of ''kilts and heather'' involved but it
doesn't celebrate the Highland myth. Instead, it attempts to look
underneath the kitsch image and explore the realities of a remote and
often savage community.
''On the one hand it is very lovely and picturesque living up there
but it is also very bleak after a long hard winter. How do these people
survive?'' he asks.
If only for its time slot (early Sunday evenings) there will be the
inevitable comparisons with Heartbeat. Though, to be fair, the
comparison really starts and ends with the fact that both serials
feature a young village policeman. Still, to be compared to one of the
most successful mainstream dramas of the 90s is not necessarily to be
sneezed at.
''I think it would be unreasonable to suggest that 14 or 15 million
Heartbeat fans will suddenly switch allegiance to Macbeth. But please
don't compare us to Heartbeat. It is well-established now but people
didn't know what to make of it when it started. I hope that the same
thing will happen with Macbeth, that people will get involved with it as
it goes along and that they'll stick with it,'' he adds.
Carlyle will know soon enough. The series starts transmission on March
26 and the BBC's network controllers will decide after three episodes
whether or not they'll make a second series. It is all down to audience
figures, of course. Anything between seven and 10 million should ensure
its future. Curiously, decision day should coincide with Carlyle's 34th
birthday on April 14.
Robert Carlyle came to acting by a circuitous route. He left school at
16 with nothing and worked with his old man, a painter and decorator for
five years. Then he went to night school at Cardonald College, Glasgow,
to pick up a few basic qualifications. With a book token he received for
his twenty-first birthday, he bought himself a copy of Arthur Miller's
The Crucible and discovered acting.
He went on to study drama at the Royal Scottish Academy and eventually
ended up learning his craft with the legendary theatrical company,
Raindog. He first came to popular prominence with his acclaimed
performance in Ken Loach's movie, Riff Raff.
What you find odd about Robert Carlyle when you meet him is just how
normal he really is. There is neither the air of conceit nor that
precious ''I'm-an-actor-so-don't-even-try-to-understand-me'' nonsense
about him. Jees, you could take him for a pint and no-one would ever
notice that he's a thespian. And yet, here you have one of the most
powerful young actors in Scotland.
He is a method actor. But he employs his own distinctive methods. For
the part of Albie, the psycho who had a post-Hillsborough grudge against
the tabloids in Cracker, he steeped himself in the Sun's scandalous
reports of the tragedy and wandered about with a Liverpool accent for
two months.
For Priest, Jimmy McGovern's controversial movie about a homosexual
Roman Catholic priest, Carlyle (it is worth pointing out that he is
hetrosexual) faced the dilemma of working out for himself how to portray
a homosexual.
''Being involved in this business you regularly come across the gay
community so I didn't have to do that much in terms of research. But I
had to decide how far I took the character. It would have been very,
very easy to make him a screaming gay. It would also have been very easy
to do nothing at all -- and make him a closeted 'hetrosexual' gay man.
But what I tried to do was to go for the middle ground, if you like, and
show the feminine side of myself without overplaying it too much,'' he
explains.
The depths to which Carlyle goes to introduce, if not truth then
certainly verisimilitude, to his characters takes its toll on him,
physically and mentally.
''You take a character like Albie. It is very difficult to live a
normal daily life when you're carrying that about with you. Even after
you've finished it still lives on with you. But I look on it this way. I
am being highly paid to do a job of work and it is only two or three
months out of my life. I owe the producers of whatever drama I am
working on everything I have for that period of time. And after it's
finished I will go away and get off the planet for a while,'' he adds.
''You just have to diversify with things. To me that's the only way
for an actor to secure a decent shelf life. I have no illusions about
acting. I've been down there chasing round the country with theatre
companies and I've also hit the heights of the Cannes Film Festival.
''All I can do is hope to hang on as long as I possibly can through
the standard of work I can produce. I am a very fortunate person and I
look at some of my fellow actors who came out of drama school at the
same time as me and they are struggling to get work and pay the
mortgage. I don't have anything to complain about,'' he says.
Now Robert Carlyle is off to give good severely disabled. He is about
to start work on Go Now, yet another Jimmy McGovern project. In this
film for the BBC he will play a promising amateur footballer, a young
man with everything going for him and a girlfriend to boot, who is
stricken by multiple sclerosis and who ends up in a wheelchair. Rest
assured his research will be painstaking and his performance brilliant.
* Hamish Macbeth starts on BBC1 on Sunday, March 26; Priest will be
showing at the Glasgow Film Theatre from March 17.

Michael Tumelty reports on a new composition born of a poet's love
''REMEMBER . . . today you met a fool.'' The parting words of the poet
Sorley Maclean still ring in the ears of Glasgow composer William
Sweeney.
Sweeney had gone to visit the grand old master of Gaelic verse at his
home on Skye to discuss with him a proposed musical setting of Maclean's
great poem, The Woods of Raasay, the 41-verse epic in which the poet's
observations of the woods -- which he can see on Raasay from his home at
Braes -- mingle with the echoes of some deeply personal experience.
It was a strange encounter, recalled Sweeney. ''He chooses his words
very carefully,'' said the composer. ''He sat there for a long time in
silence, and then suddenly it was as though 50-odd years disappeared and
he told me exactly what he was thinking and feeling at the time he wrote
the poem.''
It would, said Sweeney, be up to the poet to say publicly what it was.
''But a deep personal crisis was involved. It's all in the poem, which
was written before the war, while Maclean was waiting to be called up.
There's a kind of duality about it: on the one hand there are the woods
as a source of inspiration; but they are also the cause of psychological
unrest.''
Any speculation would suggest that some great love, long in the past,
was involved. ''Obviously it is somebody he had great misgivings
about,'' said Sweeney. ''A relationship that didn't work out.'' And
Maclean's final words to the composer perhaps imply that, as with many
before him, and since, nothing makes a man more foolish than love.
Sweeney's large-scale setting of The Woods of Raasay, in its original
Gaelic, receives its first performance tomorrow night. It was influenced
not only by the images and duality of Maclean's poem, but also by the
poet's own recitation. The composer's worknotes show a shorthand musical
annotation of Sorley Maclean's delivery, with its distinctive speech
rhythms.
''He uses a type of metre and a verse scheme that isn't a common
Gaelic form,'' said Sweeney. ''It's something he devised for the poem.
And his mastery of rhythm and metre -- especially his intensely rhythmic
delivery -- started to trigger things off musically.''
Sweeney has set the poem in four continuous sections for symphony
orchestra and two voices -- high soprano and bass. ''From years ago,
since I first thought of the possibility of setting The Woods of Raasay,
I've had the feeling that there would be two voices,'' he said. ''Not
because there are two people in the poem -- there aren't, it's very much
a meditation.
''In the first place I see the male voice in the main part, narrating
the thing, starting it and finishing. The woman's voice I bring in at a
point where the poem is almost addressing the wood, like a mother
addressing a child.''
The first section, influenced by the fast, repeated rhythms of
Maclean's own recitation, is, said Sweeney, almost pibroch-like. ''He
sets up these rhythms like streams of grace notes on the pipes.'' The
section also follows generally the accumulation and increasing
complexity familiar from pibroch development.
This dissolves into a slow section in which the soprano predominates.
The style changes and the music is in the woods themselves, looking
across to Skye and the great peaks of Sgurr nan Gillean, ''its four
rugged headlong pinnacles in a row'', an image appearing to the poet at
once ''warlike'' and the ''peak of my longing and full love''.
The musical style here is more static, with the orchestra supporting
the voice, and musical textures becoming very thin.
With the 21st verse, beginning: ''There came a startling in the wood''
the music boils with, said the composer, ''a sense of danger and
disturbance, the orchestra hammering in with fast tempestuous music, and
each phrase of the male voice answered by yelping woodwinds.''
In the final section, the composer takes a different course than that
suggested by Maclean's own reading. ''Sorley becomes more animated,
pressing on. I've pulled it back so that the phrasing becomes more like
a memory of the opening.'' The musical style here develops the feeling
of a full-blown Gaelic psalm -- a style employed to great effect in
Sweeney's earlier setting of poetry by Aonghas MacNeacail.
The ending of The Woods of Raasay Sweeney described as ''a bit like
looking into the abyss. It's not pessimism, perhaps a kind of acceptance
of the condition. The poet is fighting to make sense of the whole
situation in which he found himself at that time.''
So did Sorley Maclean, now nearing his mid-eighties, find release or
rationalisation in his creation of The Woods of Raasay? Only he knows
for certain. His parting shot to William Sweeney, half a century on from
the writing, and calling himself a fool, perhaps suggests that he did
not.
* The BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra performs The Woods of Raasay,
along with Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, tomorrow night at the City
Hall, Glasgow, 7.30pm

THE BBC yesterday announced the appointment of leading Chinese
composer Tan Dun as associate composer/conductor to the BBC Scottish
Symphony Orchestra. His contract will run for three years, with a
minimum commitment of four weeks with the SSO per year.
The BBC SSO thus becomes the only British orchestra with a foreign
resident composer attached to it. During the association, the BBC will
commission from Dun a wide range of projects, including a major
orchestral work, a number of smaller pieces, and will give the British
premieres of several of his other works.
Announcing the appointment, Hugh MacDonald, head of music at BBC
Scotland, said: ''We in the BBC orchestras stand or fall by our
commitment to new music. The SSO is 60 this year and the appointment of
Tan Dun is a marvellous way to celebrate years of adventure and
innovation; this heralds the most exciting period of all.''
Tan Dun himself described his relationship with the BBC SSO, which
extends back seven years to his virtual discovery in the West during a
festival of Chinese music in Glasgow, as ''a fatal hook-up; a fatal
attraction''.
He said that the SSO playing his music represented ''the very best
among all the collaborations I've had -- even more than with my Chinese
colleagues.''
The SSO has contracted the unorthodox (by Western terms) Chinese
composer just as his career is beginning to take flight internationally.
Dun arrived yesterday from New York, direct from the premiere of his
Ghost Opera, a large-scale multi-media work featuring the cult group,
the Kronos Quartet. He is en route to Helsinki for the premiere of his
Cello Concerto. And his opera Marco Polo is being promoted by a
multinational conglomerate of festivals.
His residency with the SSO begins at the London Proms this August.
Watch out for a fresh and charismatic voice on the Scottish music scene.

LEAVING a mark can take many forms. Tom Stoppard's Indian Ink suggests
that a smudge on a canvas can hold the key to a rich past. The secret is
in decoding it. For all that, his latest play is a strangely
old-fashioned piece, both lumbering and light, elegant and every so
slightly offensive.
The offence -- or maybe it's embarrassment -- is to see the British
Raj trundled out yet again. After E M Forster and Paul Scott's Jewel in
the Crown, subservient Indians, white flannels, and pukka thirties
accents do now seem somehow hackneyed even given Stoppard's subtly
ironic touch. Younger generations of British Indians like Hanif Kureishi
and Meera Syal too have opened our eyes to how things can be seen
differently. And even though Stoppard tells his story through the
sympathetic, pro-Indian eyes of a free-spirited young Londoner, Miss
Flora Crewe, poet and sometime artist's model (played with fluttering,
resilient beauty by Felicity Kendal), reactionary stereotypes are still
in the ascendancy.
There is a humane, interactive hugely enjoyable linguistic humour at
work as Flora and Indian painter, Nirad Das (Art Malik) jump their
various cultural and romantic hoops. Stoppard in full flow is still one
of the joys of the British stage and there is great fun and heart
stopping moments. Peter Wood's production is delicately tuned to these,
but for all that, the play splutters only fitfully into life.

''MUSICIANS Wrestle Everywhere'' is not the title of the latest
bonkbuster about behind-the-scenes orchestral life. It's a new concerto
for 10 instruments by Judith Weir, commissioned by the Birmingham
Contemporary Music Group, an offshoot of the City of Birmingham Symphony
Orchestra where Weir has recently become Composer in Association.
The title is from a poem by Emily Dickinson suggesting that music is
in the air, all around us, all the time. In opening her ears to the
street music of London SE17 where she now lives, Weir has temporarily
abandoned her interest in obscure world folk-music traditions (including
those of her native Scotland) that have inspired many of her previous
pieces. Instead she allowed herself to be buffeted by the world
turbulence from Elephant Castle Roundabout, blasted by Nigerian pop
music from a tower block, and bewitched by wind chimes tinkling
timelessly in the back garden of a crumbling squat.
The result is an exotic soundscape mixing snatches of half-remembered
tunes with jazzy rhythms that are near-minimalist in their energetic
repetition. A cello and double bass start the beat rolling, but the four
woodwind, two brass instruments, and piano soon add new colours,
interrupted by sudden whispered silences and emotionless tuned
percussion. Time seems to stand still, reminding us that the musicians
wrestling everywhere inhabit another world as well as this one.
Strangely seductive to listen to, Musicians Wrestle Everywhere was an
excellent if unassuming foil to a programme of austere sacred Stravinsky
and Geoffrey Poole's surging, swinging setting of the Magnificat.

FUNNY thing, pyrotechnics; they set an audience alight. It wasn't
until her operatic encores that diva Maria Ewing last night unleashed
the fireworks that animated her audience.
As she poured out the florid runs in Rossini, they stirred; as she
reached emotional meltdown in Tosca, they bawled for her -- the guy in
front of me just bawled. And as she finally opened her throat in
Gershwin, she touched something genuinely earthy.
Until then the great lady had been in curiously restrained mode
throughout her recital -- in which, it should be stated, pianist Roger
Vignoles confirmed his status as one of the greatest accompanists of his
time, all cool lyricism and control. La Ewing exercised the liberties of
the diva in her selections from Schubert and Strauss, swooping on a
phrase, sliding to a pitch, bouncing off a thickly uttered consonant.
Oh, there were supreme moments: the silvery thread of tone at the end
of Die Junge Nonne, and the seamless phrases in Nacht und Traume. But
throughout this, and the French second half -- with heaps of Debussy but
only one song from the wondrous Henri Duparc -- Ewing used two basic
dynamics: a very soft, almost languid, half-voiced tone (could they hear
at the back?) and something at the other extreme. Colour and
middle-range volume were in short supply.
It did seem as though, temperamentally, she was on hold until the
encores. The audience was, anyway. And -- curiously -- only about half
the seats for this concert were sold, despite the fact that this was
Ewing's first Scottish appearance, and her only British recital this
year. The other divas, Bartoli and Norman, due soon, are already heading
for sellouts.

BOTH of these solo shows depend on rich storytelling traditions and
impeccable performances and both deliver the goods in abundance, with a
rough-and-ready humour and vitality. From the moment Ann Louise Ross
sweeps into the Stalls Studio in her widow's weeds and performs her
silent, anguished, yet amusingly unconvincing pageant of grief, she has
the audience in thrall. When she swigs back some wine, removes her veil
and lets forth with a verbose stream of colourful anecdotes she has us
in stitches.
Nancy Sleekit, a tart-tongued lady of Auld Reekie with a penchant for
seeing her husbands to the grave, is the magnificent creation of
Victorian poet James Smith, rediscovered and revitalised by Duncan
Campbell for Fifth Estate. Campbell brings her to life and Ross breathes
fire in her belly, all sly insouciance and ribald sensuality. She hams
it up outragously but this simply adds a larger-than-life
appropriateness.
Similarly, Finlay Welsh obviously has great fun playing the Irish
actor-manager J B Howard, who founded the Royal Lyceum. Campbell's
dramatisation depicts him preparing for the role which made him famous
in Scotland, Rob Roy. Howard, tricked by promises of ''the lead in the
Scottish play'', pours scorns on the role of the Highland outlaw but
Welsh brings joy and energy to the role of Howard, ingeniously slipping
in satirical pastiches of contemporary actors like Gielguid, to create
an affectionate celebration of the thespian craft.

O J Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark is facing a legal battle that has
implications for parents all over America.
ONCE again the scrutiny surrounding America's most famous female
prosecutor is stirring debate -- this time on single working mothers.
Marcia Clark, the lead prosecutor in the trial of former sports star O J
Simpson, is fighting for custody of her two sons, aged three and five.
Her husband Gordon, whom she is divorcing, says she is so engrossed in
the double-murder trial, he should have temporary custody until the
trial ends, possibly in several months' time.
In papers filed in a Los Angeles divorce court, the computer
programmer says she is tyrannical and neglectful, depriving the boys of
affection by working long hours. The dispute was to have been settled on
Tuesday, but this has now been delayed until towards the end of this
month.
Clark's dilemma, as she juggles career and family, is one faced
increasingly by working parents. Child-care, especially in America, is
limited. Employers and colleagues are often not sympathetic to family
obligations.
Although the Clarks earn large salaries, most single parents spend a
fifth to a quarter of their income on nurseries, schools and
baby-sitting. With almost 60% of women working, the Clarks' dispute is
typical of many 90s-style fights nowadays.
Many working women and their advocates are also furious over the case,
as they see single mothers being forced to choose between family and
career. They say there is a disturbing bias against mothers, especially
if single, based on traditional views of gender.
Although the California Supreme Court has consistently rejected the
idea that working mothers are inherently bad parents, women fear they
are held to higher standards by judges, often male and middle-aged.
Family lawyers say that custody, usually an emotionally-charged issue,
is complex and cannot be based upon a temporary phase in a parent's
career, rather than the child's long and short-term needs. Still, some
groups that support fathers' rights say the Clarks' fight underscores
the discrimination men face in family law.
It is hardly the first time Marcia Clark, 41, has been controversial.
During jury selection, she was criticised for her short skirts, Lycra
and tough style. Then she was blasted for softening her image to appear
less threatening.
With the Simpson trial in its second month, many observers now believe
that Judge Lance Ito is steadily biased against Clark. He has a
reputation for treating female lawyers more harshly. And if that were
not enough, a photograph of Clark sunbathing topless on a European beach
has been circulated.
For the last six weeks, Clark has lead a team of attorneys in
California's highest-profile trial, clearly the professional challenge
of her life -- and the consensus is that the defence is in trouble. Yet
the 16-hour work days and glare of the TV cameras have been so
gruelling, prosecutor Bill Hodgman was hospitalised with exhaustion a
few weeks ago. Apparently hoping to avoid more casualties, Judge Ito cut
court hours by about a dozen a week.
Still, as Newsweek magazine noted in a recent cover story on
over-working, the toughest occupation remains that of working mother.
Even when unemployed, men do no more than 36% of the housework, says the
magazine. Single fathers or those who share custody must be more
involved with their children, but single mothers are more often the
primary parent in terms of decision- making and emotion.
Clark's tug between family and work first emerged publicly after a
court-room fight, when she apologised by explaining she was tired as one
of her children had been sick overnight. Then the issue came up again
just over a week ago, when Clark said she could not stay for a proposed
evening session because of her children.
The next day, Johnnie Cochran, the lead defence lawyer, accused her of
using her children to delay testimony of the key defence witness Rosa
Lopez as Clark was not fully prepared. Clark angrily responded she was
''offended as a woman, as a single parent, as a prosecutor''. Four days
later, her divorce papers were publicised, although she tried to keep
them sealed, reportedly after a defence tip to media.
After 13 years of marriage, she had filed for divorce on June 9, three
days before the murders of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ron
Goldman, crimes Simpson denies. In papers filed in December, Clark
demanded an increase in her $650 monthly child support, claiming she is
struggling with $945 in baby-sitting and $625 in nursery schools
monthly, $23,000 in credit card debt, a $14,000 dental bill and the need
for clothes for the trial. Clark earns $96,829 a year, almost twice the
$54,586 salary of her 36-year-old husband.
But when Gordon Clark responded by demanding custody, the issue
resonated with other working mothers. In sometimes bitter language, he
says she often does not get home until 10pm, whereas he returns at
6:15pm. He commends her career, but says the boys are suffering and
should be with him not a baby-sitter. He says he has been as much a
parent as she has.
''It's a double whammy -- women are in a lose-lose situation,'' says
Kathy Rogers, who heads the National Organisation for Women Legal
Defence and Education Fund. Clark was first criticised for spending time
with her children, then for not being at home enough.
There is growing evidence that a single mother's career will be held
against her in a custody fight, while a man's will not, says Bruce
Boyer, supervising attorney at the Child and Family Justice Centre at
Northwestern University. It would be unheard of for a former wife to
seek custody based on a temporary change in a man's working hours.
He says court fights are usually harmful for the child and are seldom
justified when demanding temporary custody. ''It's overkill. You don't
drag the kids through the courts for that.''
Fathers, even if awarded custody, tend to cut back the time they spend
with children after the first year while mothers do not, says Jane Zorza
of the National Centre for Women and Family Law.
The case also raises an assumption about child-care, which cannot be
assumed to be worse for a child, say many experts. ''The most loving
choice may be to leave the child with a care-taker,'' says Mary Mannix
Meister of the National Coalition of Working Parents, which represents
mothers and fathers. ''It's very unfortunate that her dedication to her
job is being used against her.''
Yet others advocate joint custody, an idea popular in the 1970s and
1980s but now less in favour; it can be tough for children. Derrick
Hicks, executive director of the Children's Rights Council, says both
parents should be fully involved and that in the past men have been
discriminated against. ''Why not let the parent have the child for two,
three or six months?''
In September, Capitol Hill was rocked when a judge ordered Sharon
Prost, counsel to Senator Orrin Hatch, to surrender her two sons to her
former husband. The judge portrayed her as a workaholic and her husband
as doting on the children. Fathers' groups hailed the decision, but
Nancy Polikoff, who teaches family law at American University in
Washington, says the husband was unemployed for a long time and still
sent the kids to full-time day-care. ''If a father does a little bit,
he's a super-dad. If a mother is not doing everything, she is failing.
We need to look at the issue in a gender neutral way.''

Sexual harrassment at work is an insidious wrecker of careers
companies often try to cover up. Jennifer Cunningham looks at the
reality behind the fiction of films such as Disclosure.
SEXUAL harassment is no longer about the boss goosing the secretary in
mid-dictation but about the sabotage of high-flying careers. Once upon a
time the battle of sexes was the headline writers' shorthand cliche for
differences of opinion between men and women which had become
antagonism. Now it is outright war and, as in love, all's fair.
Sexual blackmail, even bogus claims of sexual harassment are seen as
legitimate weapons in the workplace according to a solicitor
specialising in employment law.
''Employees are threatening to claim sexual harassment to avoid
dismissal or win promotion -- and many companies are choosing to pay up
rather than risk the damaging publicity,'' said Stephanie Klass.
''My most recent case involved a company chairman who was falsely
accused of serious sexual harassment by a junior employee he had just
dismissed. The allegations were completely untrue and the industrial
tribunal dismissed them -- but for the executive at the centre of it all
it was a nightmare,'' she said.
The Hollywood gloss on this very dirty power game bursts into the
British consciousness at the end of this week with the release of
Disclosure, in which sexual and corporate politics combine in a false
accusation of sexual harassment.
The twist is that it is the woman (Demi Moore) who is the predator and
the man (Michael Douglas) who is the victim. As the lawyer acting for
the Douglas character points out, sexual harassment is not about sex but
about power.
There lies the political intrigue. Who calls the shots when the
personal becomes political? As Moore puts it to Douglas: ''You have a
family, you have more to lose than I have.''
In the final run-up to a very profitable merger, there is enormous
tension at the computer company not least over the question of who will
be vice-president.
Tom Sanders (Douglas) is shocked to be passed over in favour of the
young, beautiful and ambitious Meredith Johnson (Moore). She is an old
flame, still single and intent on resuming the once-torrid affair. He is
now a family man with a wife and two children. Johnson sets up an
end-of-the-day meeting, attempts to seduce him and is furious at his
ultimate rejection. Next day, she claims Sanders sexually harassed her.
The fall-out faced by complainants in sexual harassment cases --
disbelief, strain on marriage and ostracism by colleagues -- is touched
on rather than explored in the film. What does emerge is the lonely and
precarious position of anyone making a complaint of sexual harassment,
however justified, and the need for an unwavering friend.
Very few complaints result in tribunal cases. The prospect of
publicity is a powerful deterrent. It is no small consideration that
what remains in the public memory is the association with sleaze rather
than the victory.
Sanders' discovery in Disclosure that the harassment was only part of
a bigger set-up to oust him from the company illustrates that beneath
the titillating label, the reality is that anyone who makes a complaint
risks retaliation and the loss of their job.
Many cases are settled out of court simply to avoid embarrassment and
damaging publicity, confirmed the Equal Opportunities Commission. Their
figures show, however, that it is still overwhelmingly women who are the
victims. Last year three complaints of sexual harassment were brought by
men compared with 665 from women.
There will be great pressure on complainants to settle out of court in
order to avoid besmirching the company name. Sanders is beseeched to
drop his case because it could scupper the merger.
Last year widely-reported evidence of extra-marital affairs among
staff of the Child Support Agency was seen as so damaging -- although
the complaint was not upheld -- that the agency issued a statement
dissociating itself from evidence suggesting that their staff behaved in
an unprofessional manner.
False accusations are few and far between, as Stephanie Klass admits,
despite her client's recent experience. ''I have been told I am letting
the side down, highlighting these cases, but I think it is the women who
make these false allegations who are letting the side down,'' she said.
Despite the difficulties, complaints have been rising steadily since
sexual harassment cases began to be heard by tribunals in 1986 -- with
an average success rate of 45%.
Since the compensation limit of #11,000 for sex-discrimination cases
was lifted in November 1993, employers have been keen to learn about
good practice and a number of management consultants have been running
equal-opportunities courses slanted towards avoiding sex-discrimination
and sexual-harassment cases.
Angela O'Hagan, development officer, at the EOC's Scottish office in
Glasgow, said: ''Steering people towards good practice is better than a
negative decision from an industrial tribunal which is costly,
time-consuming, and generates bad publicity for the company.''
Sometimes the difference between disgruntlement and discrimination is
not crystal-clear. When does falling out with a colleague -- or a boss
-- constitute harassment and when is it just unpleasant behaviour?
Lothian and Borders Police officers do not need to ponder whether they
are becoming paranoid -- they can put their worries before a network of
counsellors appointed by the force as part of their equal-opportunities
policy.
The Royal Mail has also pioneered a control system. Patrick Stacey,
equal-opportunities manager for Scotland and Northern Ireland, is
currently setting up a network of counsellors, who are trained
volunteers from different sections who can offer advice without
triggering the formal complaints procedure or, if appropriate, help the
victim through a formal complaint.
He said: ''I hope to do myself out of a job in two years but there are
new ideas and better practices emerging all the time and so we can all
learn an enormous amount just from talking to each other.''
The statistics show that it is mostly women who are harassed by men
except for isolated instances. That presumably makes it more difficult
for men to make complaints, but the turn-around in Disclosure
effectively brings home to men just how difficult it is for men and
women in such situations.
The first reaction among Sanders' colleagues is disbelief. He is not
entirely victim, however. During the hearing, his secretary describes
his own form of harassment -- a hand on her shoulder, a swipe on her
behind. ''I don't think he means it,'' she says. Now there's another
question. Explain the difference between an affectionate gesture and a
threatening one, innocent banter and lewd remarks.
According to the EOC's briefing: ''Sexual harassment can take many
forms all of which may be unacceptable to the person on the receiving
end. It may include comments about the way someone looks, lewd remarks
or glances, questions or comments about a woman's sex life, requests for
sexual favours or intimate physical contact.''
The debate will go on in every workplace, but the fun has to stop when
it becomes victimisation.

Memories of La Lollo and the glamour of past screen sirens are revived
at the Milan Italian Collections where Anne Simpson finds that fashion
is rooted in archive alley.
VOLUPTUOUS and sometimes pagan in its lust for richness, Italian
fashion often seems created more for grand opera than for life. But
these have been a tricky few seasons. Unnerved by the wild highs and
lows of international currencies, the Titans of style have found no
appetite anywhere for excess. Desperate for headlines, some among them
have sunk their reputations into clip-joint Lolita numbers which may
just about pass muster in the foolish spotlight of the catwalk, but who
out in the real world is wearing all that crushed latex and transparent
vinyl?
Elsewhere, other big names, believing that customers desire change but
nothing unfamiliar -- have retrenched into knitwear. Yet, no matter how
stylish Italian knits may be they hardly justify that old ballyhoo about
the personality of the designer, and his muse. And more serious problems
have bruised the once impeccable behaviour of Milan. There has, after
all, been scandal.
As Italy continues to tremble under bribery investigations so the
fashion industry, like many others, has found its dirty linen pulled
into the open, numerous designers being brought before magistrates for
allegedly paying backhanders to corrupt tax officials in return for
lenient treatment.
But in this week of Italian Collections for next winter, the free fall
of the lire is at least keeping exports buoyant. In fact, over the past
18 months 48% of Italy's fashion production has provided foreign
retailers with bargain pickings. And while Britain, along with other EU
countries, has been struggling to sustain Far Eastern sales, the
Italians have surged ahead, doubling their deliveries to the value of 17
million Ecus to Singapore alone.
All this is just as well, for the home market remains more dazed and
insecure than ever. ''Italy has always lacked a culture of money wisely
used,'' says a member of the Milano Collezioni, the governing body of
Italian ready-to-wear. ''But now the market is frightened and
disorderly, not knowing if, how, or when to buy.''
That said, not everyone is ruled by creative caution. In his Versus
and Isante collections Versace punks up Givenchy with little Audrey
Hepburn dresses -- sleeveless, body-skimming, and ending either
mid-thigh or on the knee -- whose Dolly Mixture colours are glazed in
slimy fabrics. And who better than Versace to knock the stuffiness out
of the old-fashioned twin-set by teaming it with a tiny kilt and
sporran, the pleats spinning out over the buttocks but little else?
Kirsten MacMenemy, as ever prowling up and down the catwalk like a
dyspeptic panther, appears in the kind of nurse's uniform only to be
found in very specialised private hospitals: since the chequer-board
micro skirt and cut-away white top expose more than they conceal, the
greater expanse of fabric used for this outfit seems to be contained in
Kirsten's First Aid cap.
In Milan Franco Moschino, who died last autumn, was the hobo of
Italian style. Now that he has gone, his studio are reluctant to let
that identity rest in peace, and have produced a kitsch memorial
collection full of shroud-like dresses printed with clouds and troubling
angels' wings. But over the past few years two other names have gained
similar attention for wit and wickedness. Enter Dolce and Gabbana, a
pair of inventive free-thinkers whose collections parody the shaky
wonder of fat-cat opulence, their work being a wilful contradiction to
bourgeois dressing.
Ignoring the lure of catwalk hoopla and hyped-up modelling babes, D &amp;
G usually present their idiosyncratic wear in their own plain showroom,
as if choosing commercial realism as a backdrop. When they do go for a
big name on which to hang their clothes it usually belongs to the
Isabella Rossellini, ungraciously ditched in recent months by Lancome as
their beauty icon, but a woman who, in her forties, has gloriously
transcended the shibboleths of age.
Domenico Dolce comes from Palermo; his partner, Stefano Gabbana is
Venetian, and their clothes often evoke the baroque drama of their
native cities. By Easter they will have opened their own shop in London,
following the example of Prada, that other rapidly directional Italian
label. In mood the D &amp; G collection may shift from tranquillity to
farce, from the sweep of an elegant dinner dress in slipper satin to the
march of the padrino suit, that stern ensemble of the Sicilian
godfather, made whimsical in rosy velvet or with perhaps a bustier in
black satin beneath the all-powerful jacket.
Today that line is sometimes extended to take in a three-piece suit in
Prince of Wales checks, or comes with a daft black nylon transparency
edged with mink -- which of course only adds to its problems. But D &amp; G
now also revive the bella figura with shapely suits in baby blue
featuring short skirts and hour-glass jackets with big buttons. A style
which recalls all those movies where Gina Lollobrigida teetered along
the Via Veneto to the comic, flirty staccato of her own stilettos.
It was Dolce and Gabbana who first shook the foundations of fashion
with the corset dress which has since inspired a whole movement for
putting lingerie way out on top, and that silhouette still appears in
some spirited variation every season, a symbolic homage to Jane
Russell's cleavage and a reminder that of all the arts fashion and the
cinema often appear to dress each other.
In fact such is Dolce &amp; Gabbana's personal interest in movies that the
two designers have just completed their first venture into acting. In
Giuseppe Tornatore's new film, L'uomo delle Stelle (The Man of the
Stars) Domenico plays a shepherd, Stefano a photographer. ''We wanted to
experience something different,'' says Domenico, ''and this was a great
pleasure as well as a fantastic challenge. You learn so much by watching
movies.''
Some, of course, might claim that you can learn too much, hence this
all-encompassing pastiche of the screen siren's glamour from the forties
and fifties which now holds fashion in thrall. Crawford, Davis,
Stanwyck, Dietrich, Hepburn, Lollobrigida, and Cardinale . . . the
shadows of each are stealing over Milan this week, confirming that
whatever the fluctuations in world economies, fashion in its headlong
rush into the future is still nowhere more rooted than down in archive
alley. These clothes reach us not second-hand exactly but certainly
having enjoyed a previous life.

IT will be odd if the Scottish comrades vote on Friday to follow their
leader and ditch Clause 4. This is because they have in another context
committed themselves to the concept of public ownership in Scotland,
presumably regardless of what champagne-socialists from Islington may
want or think, and entered into a compact to that end with other key
elements in the nation's life.
The terms are found in the Constitutional Convention's proposals for a
Scottish Parliament, which would be explicitly granted ''power to
initiate some form of public ownership or control in the public
interest''.
That may strike you as vague, but do not worry about it. Anything also
supported by the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Episcopal Church of
Scotland must not only be brilliant in itself, but also of indisputable
benefit to us and to the whole of mankind.
I wonder, though, if the Labour party can unilaterally wriggle out of
this solemn undertaking. One would hope not. It would make the Scottish
Liberal Democrats and the Episcopal Church of Scotland the only
socio-political forces in the Western world setting out public ownership
as a constitutional principle.
In any event, they would be the only socio-political forces of any
importance so doing, a category from which I must exclude the Democratic
Left, former members of the Communist International, though they were in
the convention too. It would be surely rather lacking in gallantry for
the Labour party to clamber out and leave these, possibly with
representatives of the Moslems as well, in bed together.
This is, however, not merely a matter of good manners, but also of
political principle. If Labour can ditch the policy of public ownership
on which it has laboriously reached agreement with its partners in the
convention, what is there that it may not ditch, just on its own say-so?
The taxing powers are already looking doubtful. The place of Scottish
Home Rule in some grand constitutional scheme changes from day to day.
Heavens above, could even gender equality be in danger? Is nothing
sacred?
Nothing, we may say, is sacred so long as it sounds nice. Clause 4 may
have sounded nice in 1918. In fact, if you read it, it sounds far from
horrific even today. But historically it has come to mean
nationalisation of the most bungling and bureaucratic sort. Regardless
of what it says, therefore, it has acquired associations too awful to
contemplate for any aspiring Prime Minister.
The main requisite for the replacement is not that it should tell us
what any future Labour Government wants to do, but simply that it should
sound nice. Tony Blair's wish for ''the distribution of power, wealth
and opportunity'' could have won enthusiastic applause from Mrs Margaret
Thatcher (who was indeed also able to do something about it).
The formula I favour is Brian Wilson's, not just because it mentions
everything nice, but because it does so in language that brings tears to
the eyes, and at the end has little children run off touchingly into the
sunset of the future.
Underneath this one day will lie, or may lie, the brute realities of
power. If I was still malevolent towards the comrades in Inverness, I
might hold up what they had written into the proposals for a Scottish
Parliament of the Constitutional Convention as what they really had in
store for us. I might make it sound not nice at all, and hint darkly
that it had only been allowed into print because nobody but devolution
freaks were likely to read the proposals of the Constitutional
Convention.
But when I look at the somewhat smaller print, it becomes rather hard
to make the proposals sound not nice. I dare say this has a lot to do
with the part that the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Episcopal
Church of Scotland, maybe even the Moslems, took in drawing them up.
These people are all genuinely nice, and would have stilled the
instincts of class war in the comrades' savage breasts.
So one would have expected the convention's mind to be concentrated on
what was feasible or sensible or possible. When it reveals, however,
what it means to control in the public interest, the shopping is a
trifle eccentric. At the very top of it is ''strategic economic planning
powers for industries like whisky'' -- now here are men who truly have
their priorities right, though I wonder how they got it past the
Moslems.
Then come similar powers for steel (an industry which we do not
actually possess any more), for offshore engineering and for fisheries
(patently not plannable, either of them), food processing, clothing and
textiles, agriculture and related land issues, some (why not all?)
engineering, and possibly (just to keep us on tenterhooks) electronics
and shipbuilding.
The point of reciting this threadbare catalogue is to show that even
when the comrades sat down and put their heads together to define the
commanding heights of the Scottish economy, a matter in which they had
little interest or experience, and even when they prayed in aid of the
Episcopal Church of Scotland's powers of divination, they were quite
unable to say anything coherent.
Odd though it may look, and open to the unfair nit-picking of hostile
commentators, there is no firm intellectual ground for them to stand by
refusing to renounce Clause 4.
When they had it, they did not know what to do with it. Yet we may ask
whether even hollow and futile commitments can be usefully replaced by
mere niceness. In the end, no Government is that nice, as the voters
know. They may be left wondering just what Labour stands for. It may
even be wondering that itself.

WHAT more could anyone want, living in cosmopolitan Fort William, than
their very own McDonald's? Don't all answer at once, but apply your
minds instead to the unrivalled civic honour involved in becoming quite
the smallest town in Scotland, if not the entire United Kingdom, to
possess its very own ''drive-thru'' (as opposed to drive past at high
speed, windows tight shut, don't stop for anything) restaurant.
That, at least, was the persuasive line taken recently by a Mr Stephen
McConnell, McDonald's development surveyor, in pursuit of his company's
ambition to feed Fort William folk as they have never been fed up
before. For good measure he added: ''We have been asked if we'll put up
Gaelic signs and we are willing to do this.''
This may stretch local linguists a bit. What, after all, is the Gaelic
for Wouldn't Feed It To The Cat? Our heart was warmed, nevertheless, by
the member of the local planning committee who welcomed McDonald's
scheme as filling a ''piecemeal development''.
If you go down to the Pit today . . .
THERE'S a moral in this tale somewhere, but it would probably be in
poor taste to bring it to your attention. Suffice it to say that a ''dry
bar'' established for teenagers in Galashiels has proved so stupendously
successful they've had to close it down.
High on fizzy drinks, crazed by mind-altering cheese-and-onion crisps,
and doubtless free-basing semi-skimmed milk, the boys and girls had
taken to wrecking fittings and thieving at the Snake Pit Monday Club.
Perhaps the misunderstood kiddies thought it was the Snakebite Club.
That's rich
CLASS WAR, that sober journal (''Relieve Executive Stress -- Hang the
Scumbags''), appears finally to have acquired a story. OK: we'll settle
for urban myth.
The paper that likes to refer to the leader of the Labour Party as
''chipmunk'' or ''posh bastard'' carries ideological conflict to its
ultimate conclusion with an approving report that six members of a South
Korean gang have been sentenced to death for, um, eating the rich.
It transpires that the gang had carried out a series of kidnappings
and murders and had, according to the always-reliable Class War, ''set
about the quite reasonable task of ridding South Korea of its obscene
rich, even at times eating them . . . When being questioned, members of
the gang said they were planning on killing as many rich people as
possible.''
Don't mock. This may be the answer to the problem of boardroom pay
we've all been looking for. At least the Koreans weren't charged with
eating at McDonald's.
A safer bet
THE new owners of Barings -- the bank that likes to say ''bonus!'' --
may meanwhile care to peruse the classified advertising columns of the
Nikkei Weekly before they sanction another go at Far Eastern bingo. The
Japanese English-language sheet is devoted, after all, to the lean, mean
market-place in which young Mr Leeson lost enough shirts to keep M&amp;S
going for a year.
A recent issue, for example, offers copies of Taking Charge in Japan,
described as ''a practical guidebook for expatriate executives on how to
recruit, manage, reward, rehabilitate, and'' (intriguing, this) ''reduce
Japanese staff''.
Quite what the connections are between being rewarded and
rehabilitated before being ''reduced'' are not immediately clear. Surely
a simpler way would be just to hire a 28-year-old Englishman and
encourage him to reduce the entire firm to ashes within weeks.
Net widens
WITH International Women's Day upon us, and not a moment's peace to
retitle the Diary, we can only report that a new Men's Issues Page has
appeared on the Internet's World Wide Web.
Apparently, cybermen will now be able to bond via modem, access their
feelings, care and share, whine about their lot, and hyperlink (don't
ask) to the timeless poetry of Robert Bly, the man who brought us Iron
John and running starkers through the woods, without having women tell
them what a sad, pathetic and highly suspect bunch they really are.
What isn't explained is how, given the anonymous nature of the Net,
anyone can prove that the participants are actually male. Feminist
satirists on stand-by?
Explosive stuff
WE understand the little ways of headline writers only too well, but
was it really necessary for the East Lothian News to report the
abandonment of plans for a radioactive waste store at Torness with the
tasteful line ''Nuclear Bombshell?''
Cheers for Napier
WITH ALL these shiny new universities springing up, it may not be
entirely surprising that some of the disciplines on offer can seem a
touch novel. Still, Edinburgh's Napier University has struck a blow for
all of us who believe education should be fun and nothing but. Napier
requires, states a cheering advertisement, a senior lecturer in
''Hospitality''.
As the ad has it, candidates ''will possess a degree and a higher
degree in Hospitality or a related discipline''. Jolly good. But what,
precisely, counts as a related discipline? A diploma in Advanced
Lounging? A doctorate in Theoretical Relaxing?
Nothing daunted, Napier is also advertising for a lecturer or reader
in biomedical sciences. This, alert readers may recall, was the post
held until recently by a certain Paul Agutter, now serving 12 years for
inflicting an excess of hospitality and dodgy diet tonic water on his
wife.
Napier, boasting of its ''close links with business and commerce'',
had links with a local branch of Safeway, where Agutter planted his
poisoned mixers, rather closer than it might have liked. Applications
for the post from anyone at present attending Saughton gaol are not, we
fear, being encouraged.
Ibrox seats on the move again
WICK Academy, doughtiest of distant football teams, are preparing to
transform their Harmsworth Park ground into the envy of the North with
the installation of new seating. Not just any old seats, you understand,
but 400 declared surplus to the posteriors of Ibrox Park, no less.
Contrary to some malicious reports, Wick have seen to the removal and
transportation of the seats themselves and have not called in a squad of
stray Celtic supporters to do the job for them.
Walk this way
IT'S not for us to say, but is the Scottish Borders Festival of
Walking, pacing itself for the second week in September, a step in the
right direction?

THERE are some brave souls among the Republicans in Congress. A few, a
very few, are ready to say that middle-class entitlements must be cut if
ever we are to balance the federal budget.
The boldest even floated the heresy that some limit should be put on
the mortgage interest rate deduction. Not only are American home-owners
allowed to knock their interest payments off their incomes, but they can
add to their mortgages, by ''home equity loans'', and deduct the new
interest, too, and even deduct interest for payments on holiday homes.
It's a scandal, of course. Why should the general taxpayer subsidise
those rich enough to buy a second house, or those who already own a
house but want to borrow against their accumulated capital for any
purpose at all?
Another sacred cow is the Medicare programme, which is socialised
medicine for retired and disabled people. Its costs are increasing at
10% to 12% a year, and there is no hope at all of bringing federal
spending under control unless Medicare expenditures are cut. Everyone
wants to stop the runaway expansion of Medicaid spending: that's health
care for the poor, and the new Republican Congress has no problem with
that.
But Medicare is another thing altogether. Medicare recipients, unlike
the poor, vote in large numbers. So, of course, do all those
middle-class folk who demand that the budget be balanced even as they
enjoy the benefits of the mortgage deduction.
But there's more: if we are going to balance the budget, and if we are
going to keep the Social Security pension system solvent into the next
century, the annual Cost of Living Adjustment, the sacred COLA, will
have to be adjusted downwards.
These days, it goes up according to a generous estimate of the
inflation rate. If we are to balance the budget, the COLA must be
allowed to rise at a slower rate. Eliminate the COLA for one year and
you get a cumulative saving of over $60 billion in five years.
IT'S easy to argue that that's not a cut, it's just a slower increase
-- but the howls from retired people will deafen anyone who suggests it,
and the Democrats will make even more noise, charging that they told us
so.
But it has to be done. The Congressional Budget Office, a bipartisan
body that studies these questions, produces a plan every year, showing
how the budget can be balanced.
Its latest effort, published this week, is enough to strike terror
into the heart of every Republican who swears that the budget must be
balanced.
There's no getting around it: taxes go up. That's what ending the
mortgage deduction means. What's more, the CBO suggests closing other
loopholes, which have the same effect.
It would eliminate $15 billion in annual agricultural subsidies.
Higher-income people would have to pay $45 billion extra in taxes over
the five years, and ending the charitable giving tax credit would save
$77 billion.
These are all huge sums, and legislation will be hugely painful to
enact. What is more, the CBO notes that the country cannot afford tax
cuts, which both Democrats and Republicans have promised, or present
levels of defence spending. It wields its axe against some of the
Pentagon's favourite programmes.
When you remember what happens to American politicians who put up
taxes or cut entitlements, your know why there are so few Republicans
ready to stand up and admit the need.
So you may expect to hear a lot more about the need to cut federal
spending on the arts, and foreign aid, and subsidies to welfare mothers.
None of that will have any perceptible effect on the deficit, but the
idea will be to persuade voters that those new Congressmen are
fulfilling their promises -- when they aren't.
Does this really matter? Possibly. The national debt is so huge, and
rising so rapidly because of continuing deficits and the miracle of
compound interest, that a crash is only too likely some time before the
end of the century.
The United States runs a high trade deficit as well as a budget
deficit, just like Mexico last year. If there is a moment of truth, it
will come when the US Treasury cannot borrow any more, because there is
not enough available capital on the world market.
When it can't borrow, the US will have to cut its clothes to suit its
cloth, impose all at once those draconian cuts that are now too
difficult to impose gradually.

DIAL M for multi-coloureds. Any chaps out there get the reference?
Take a bow boys, and feel free to celebrate International Women's Day
with a tidal wave of suds. You're part of the pathetically small number
of housebroken men who are au fait with the workings of a washing
machine.
Ironically, this group consists of an older generation who more
usually connected with chauvinism; by the time men reach their forties,
necessity -- the wife in hospital having a new sprog/tubes tied -- has
been the mother of invention and they've been forced to tackle the
family wash.
But while dads might know their Daz, their sons are more familiar with
the machinations of a Suzuki than a Zanussi. The cult of New Lad-dom
enabled men to cast off the uncomfortable skin of feminism and settle
comfortably into age-old male stereotypes. The guys know might have
honours degrees, professional jobs, and enough technical wizardry to set
the video to tape Top Gear in a fortnight's time, but it's hands up when
it comes to hands-on laundry management.
Their baffled, indeed panic-stricken, faces when confronted by a
washing machine are really a devious ploy. Men have perfected the act of
ducking out of domestic duties by affecting a learned helplessness in
the presence of any available female, rightly calculating that the
frustrated femme will decide it is easier and quicker to do the job
herself.
And so they impishly stuff Safeway carriers in the Hoover rather than
popping out and buying a new one, a temporary measure which inevitably
results in the hideous smell of burning plastic.
Worse, they stuff bright red boxers in a drum full of your dazzling
whites. ''Oh, sorry,'' they say, hiding a snigger as you wail over the
resulting untrendy pastel pinks, faking disappointment at being banned
from future wash days. ''Well,'' they sigh, unconvincingly, ''perhaps
it's for the best.''
Will Carling might effect a house-husband captaincy of the kitchen in
his Quorn television advertisements, but in real life the rugby player
isn't allowed near the washing machine after shrinking his wife's best
clothes. Huh, accident or design Will? Now we know what that smug smile
is all about.
Carling reveals his inadequacies in the recently published charity
booklet Celebrity Washday Secrets, which has been sponsored by washing
powder company ACDO in aid of the Save the Children Fund. The booklet's
pages are crammed with male celebs denying intimate knowledge of washing
machines and spin-dryers. By their confessions it would seem that things
haven't changed since the days of The Steamie.
''My girlfriend does the washing,'' grins Gary Glitter -- what, the
toupee too Gazza? -- while the spouses of Coronation Street star Bill
Tarmley (Jack Duckworth) and Henry Cooper are similarly inflicted,
'Enery's wife being entrusted to separately handwash his jock strap in
hot, soapy water. Greater lurve knows no woman. Even less charming was
tick-tack specialist John McCririck's response to who does the wash:
''It's the Booby's job and the Booby would never dare ruin any
clothing.''
Poor ''Booby'', but then this is an area where women are boobies of
the first degree, from Mary Magdalene washing Christ's feet to Madonna
caring for Sean Penn's Calvin Kleins, we, dumb beasts, have
enthusiastically taken on the responsibility for men's ablutions. And
they're more than happy to sit back and let us get into a lather about
it, soaking their shorts and rinsing their rugby tops.
I was never more distraught than when Madonna, that paragon of
harridans, confessed that her most blissful moment was when, married to
Sean Penn, she would scrape the lint from the dryer after spinning his
undies. Quel collusion in slobdom.
Worst still is the doting mama who continues to keep her boy spick and
span long after he has parted the coop. When it comes to wash day
secrets it's mum's the word for England's young cricket captain Mike
Atherton who bowls his washing home for his mother to sort out. He's not
unusual. I know half a dozen blokes whose mums still do their washing,
even though it often involves more time, trouble, and expense than a
trip to the local laundromat.
One colleague even recalls a flat mate in his thirties who would trek
home from Glasgow to Harthill each weekend with a sack of smelly socks
despite the fact that there was an automatic in his own kitchen.
No woman I can think of gets her mother to do her washing for her,
apart from Bianca in EastEnders but that's only because Carol works in
the Albert Square laundromat.
Chaps kid themselves on that their grubby offerings make their mothers
feel wanted. What rot. It makes the manboy feel loved and is a symbol of
a reluctance to cut the apron strings, a disturbing dependency which
bodes ill for future relationships. After all, how can he face up to the
big things in life, like love, children, and when to buy the camcorder,
when he can't even tackle his smalls?

TONY Blair is both an intelligent and engaging politician and handles
interviews with style and aplomb. Normally he appears like a political
general in full command of his forces.
His troops must be wondering, therefore, why the worst two interview
retreats their leader has faced have both been on the subject of
Scotland.
Last year he was heftily bombarded by BBC Scotland's Brian Taylor on
the West Lothian question. This is not, admittedly, the easiest subject
for any Labour politician unless you happen to lodge in an ancestral
home near Linlithgow and have a model of the Belgrano on your
mantelpiece.
However, Blair's difficulty with Taylor's skilful probing was not so
much that he didn't have the perfect answer. It became embarrassingly
clear that he didn't even understand the question.
Last Sunday Blair bungled once again on the Beeb. This time, pressed
by John Foster on the political magazine programme Scottish Lobby, Blair
wandered off again, right into no man's land.
At first all went well. Better briefed than last year, Blair advanced
confidently through the initial barrage until he ran into the question
which his revision had not anticipated. Did he agree, asked Foster, with
the Prime Minister's view that if Scots opt for independence then the
game's a bogey down at Westminster?
General Blair was suddenly transformed into a schoolboy trying
desperately to remember the right answer from his swotting. The bright
eyes started to glaze over, the crisp answers went soggy while his
argument degenerated into Hackeresque dissembling. The interview looked
bad. The transcript reads worse.
At one point Blair even managed to describe winning a majority of
Scottish parliamentary seats as a ''mere fact'' while at another he
offered the view that ''no serious person'' in Scotland favoured
independence.
After repeated questioning he finally conceded that if people in
Scotland ''were to seem clearly'' to want independence then this would
produce ''major constitutional questions''.
Yes indeed Prime Minister and the constitutional answer it would
produce would be called Scottish independence.
It is instructive to contrast Blair's blur on Scottish popular
sovereignty with the new-found clarity of the Prime Minister's position
as expressed 10 days ago in Glasgow. Major addressed the question simply
and directly, pointing out that the Union could continue only with
Scotland's ''consent''.
Now George Robertson's excuse for his leader's ramblings is that even
the SNP don't claim that if Scotland voted for independence on Thursday
then we will be a new state by Friday morning with an extra two taps for
whisky and oil installed in each household by the weekend.
Indeed we don't but what we do say is clear enough. A majority of
seats either in a Westminster election or in any future assembly
election must constitute a mandate to negotiate an independence
settlement to be placed before the Scottish people in a referendum. To
deny that is to deny democracy itself.
Independence for Scotland will be a process rather than an event but
it must have both a starting point and a finishing post.
I have no doubt that Tony will have his hands full enough this week
with Labour's constitution without worrying too much about Scotland's
constitution. But Scotland's cause is of greater significance than
Labour's clause.
And therefore for the benefit of the schoolboy Blair, rather than the
general, let me spell out what they seem to have left out of the Fettes
curriculum. Scotland is not a district or area or region or some
territory of England but a nation in our own right with national rights
we can choose to exercise.
Therefore the case for a Scottish parliament is not just an argument
for democracy and decentralisation but also a national case. It is for
the Scottish people to determine how much power we want not for the
Labour leader to decide how little power we can have.
All of this was, of course, well explained several weeks ago in the
''Claim of Right'' and subscribed to, at least nominally, by every
Labour MP in Scotland with the Linlithgow exception. If and when their
new leader gets round to reading it then he might be able to give
competent answers on the Scottish question.
I was surprised by the extent of the unionism that George Robertson
was prepared to betray to the watching public in the ''great debate'' of
a few weeks go. His confession that he would only campaign for
devolution as a means of saving the Union must have been deeply
demoralising to those many Labour supporters whose genuine and first
priority is to move Scotland forward.
However, if George is a conditional devolutionist Tony is a
conditional democrat. Just as no-one is able to set a boundary on a
nation's ambition for self government then no serious politician
describes a majority at the ballot box as a ''mere fact'' that can be
wished away.
Blair has made headway over the past couple of weeks by teasing the
Prime Minister on Europe while supporting him on Ireland.
As a debater Major is as leaden footed as Blair is silver tongued.
However, for all his dullness, at least Major has got hold of the first
democratic principle of national self determination.
It is both revealing and shameful that the Labour leader has not.

THERE is an obvious solution to the road congestion apparently caused
by teachers driving to and from school (March 3).
Roads are busiest around 8am and 5.30pm. Schools are open from 9am to
3.30pm. If teachers would merely work their contractual hours, instead
of doing unpaid overtime at each end of the day, then everyone,
including the real workers, would be happy.

CAROL Kirk muddied the waters when she wrote: ''Perpetrating the myth
that dyslexic teachers are the answer only serves to marginalise these
pupils and the very real difficulties they face'' (February 22).
I am a dyslexic teacher. But my interest is in the special needs of
the pupils I serve. Learning support teachers sometimes lean on a myth
of their own that if they show a generalised sympathy and activate
mechanical support strategies the very specific problems of dyslexia
will just go away.
As the mother of a dyslexic child I would be only too happy if that
had proved to be the case. Alas, the needs of dyslexics can only be
seriously addressed by highly specialist teaching, backed up by the
latest research in the field.
Giving specialist tuition to dyslexics is not to marginalise them but
to equip them realistically so that they can re-enter mainstream
education and life with enhanced chances of survival and success.

IN Northern Ireland the people know what they want. Do they in the
South?
It was they who broke away from the old United Kingdom that had joined
Ireland with England in 1541 and with Wales and Scotland. They cannot
now make out that everyone else is ''out of step''.
The Unionists of the North are merely the political heirs of the old
Irish kingdom, a tradition that goes back long before Henry VIII, and
who wish to remain part of the United Kingdom.
This Union of the Irish with the Welsh, Scottish, and English peoples
has produced the adjective ''British'' that became famously applied to
an Empire and their achievements in war, in inventiveness, in intellect,
letters and drama, and produced a unique civilised way of life that
remains the envy of the world.
This alliance of the four kingdoms of Western Europe has often been
found formidable, yet reasonable, in its practical solution of problems.
It acted as a more effective and economical United Nations than the
present better-known concept for several hundred years.
Yet in the absence of any of the four that conjoint achievement is
just so much more diminished. That symbiosis is not so effective, since
each is a catalyst and improves the other.
So it happened, during the First World War, when the finest and
fittest of our four countries had volunteered to serve that United
Kingdom, that a small group of Irish Nationalists, the ''Sinn Feiners'',
formed a pressure group with a policy to take their Kingdom of Ireland
out of the union. It succeeded. In 1922 the Irish Free State was born.
But there had been no referendum of the people of Ireland. It was
unknown how many would have chosen to stay in the old Kingdom. A
majority today might still prefer the former monarchy and is tired of
the continual warring and terrorism their Republic has brought upon
them.
This Sinn Fein minority is not even represented in the Irish
Parliament, except covertly, though elected by proportional
representation, yet proclaims to speak for the whole of Ireland and will
now debate with Ministers in London.
On what authority? Let there be debate, but let it be about the will
of the people concerned. Would not a carefully worded referendum of the
whole people of Ireland be an essential basis for this debate, so that
their desires and wishes might be better known? Their politicians
usually do not know.

YOUR cover of the Ayrshire child sex abuse case misses a salient
point.
Who stands to benefit from the disintegrating confusion which
undermines the legal process and divides child protection agencies?
Who evades attention when public and media attention re-focuses on the
imperfect processes employed by society's carers and law enforcers?
Who creates the conditions of bafflement and slips away in the
duststorm?
The answer? The kind of child sex abuse offender who will bend the
universe in order to escape detection and/or prosecution.
Social workers and the police have first-hand experience of this
phenomenon. Few of the rest of us can ever appreciate the fearful,
deluded lengths to which denial, rationalisation, manipulation,
scape-goating, and performing-as-a-victim can go.
From encountering criminal child sex offenders in prison chaplaincy
work and from harrowing pastoral experiences within the church, I am
convinced of one thing.
None of us should ever be in doubt about the existence of deeply evil
people whose aim is the cover-up of their own self-gratifying
wickedness.
None of this is a comment on the particulars of the Ayrshire case. My
concern is that in the present confused climate social workers and
police need to keep their nerve and stay focused on the invaluable,
incredibly frustrating, and costly business of putting the best
interests of vulnerable children first.
I have great sympathy for the genuinely innocent who suffer
miscarriages of justice. Mistaken and corrupt public servants are a
menace. In my judgment, however, the real public enemy is the
perpetrator who inflicts sexual abuse on children and evades justice by
encouraging the rest of us either to tie ourselves in knots or tear one
another apart.

IAIN HEGGIE makes some interesting points in his tirade against
Scottish theatre companies' treatment of writers and his condemnation of
working practices in general.
As a company which works closely with him, I am afraid he is guilty of
some very broad generalisations (March 3).
While there are many points that he makes that we agree with it is
also true that in a time of severe financial restraint a number of
companies are striving to achieve more satisfactory procedures with
regard to new writing and rehearsal.
At 7:48 alone, in the past two years, among other things, we have
introduced a workshop process for new work (Stephen Greenhorn's The Salt
Wound, which is to have a second production), an enhanced second
production of a new work (Jackie Kay's Twilight Shift), and for our
current production Born Guilty we are using a German Dramaturg and an
eight-week rehearsal process.
Iain Heggie has run a Writers Summer School at 7:84 for the past five
years, enhanced and supported by the company, and we also make our
facilities available for a workshop group run by him.
Other companies including The Tron, the Traverse, and Wiseguise are
also striving to improve conditions for writers and actors at a time
when the Scottish Arts Council seems to be pushing us toward rushed
productions and shorter rehearsal periods. Perhaps he should be setting
his sights elsewhere.
Finally, the next time he walks into our ''room full of administrators
of various sorts,'' he can make his own tea!

WHICH is more annoying; to be rejected because of what you are, or to
be smothered in tokenism because of what you are? If you are a man the
answer to that question is largely irrelevant. Men are rarely rejected
for being men and even more rarely are they the subject of tokenism. For
women, tokenism is becoming almost a way of life, and it is a rotten one
at that. Tokenism is everywhere; it lurks under numerous corporate
bushes, stares arrogantly from the so-called equal opportunities
programmes of political parties, and is even flourished on occasion by
women who should know better but who are demoralised by the glass or
concrete ceilings against which they bump their heads. The United
Nations in all its manifestations, from blue-helmeted to caring, is an
expert at tokenism. It is at it today with International Women's Day,
which is a concept quite as vacuous as its title is vague. Any
organisation, whether in New York or Edinburgh, which promotes the cause
(however defined) of women for one day in the year with a flourish of
cracked trumpets is either deeply cynical or feeble-minded.
Positive discrimination (or positive action, to give it its Sunday
name) is a fellow traveller of tokenism. It can sound wonderfully
attractive, as in the Labour Party's proposals to insist on 50%
candidates for parliamentary seats at General Elections, and the even
more extreme proposal to have only women on the short-leet for the
candidature in the Ayr constituency. This sort of policy succeeds in
placing women into positions which they may deserve, but at a cost which
tarnishes the achievement. Positive action generates resentment, even if
the female recipient makes a tremendous success of the job. If she
fails, perhaps through being rushed into a position for which she does
not yet have the experience, the resulting derision blots out the
original good intentions. Some governments indulge in tokenism to no
good effect. Our Government rarely even bothers, indeed relishes the
opposite. Proposals to change laws on housing in England and Wales will
lead to homeless, battered women being denied permanent housing, thereby
forcing them back to their partners. Somewhat similar proposals have
been floated in Scotland but we trust and believe that the Scottish
Office has more sense than to pursue the matter.
There is good news for women in the growing recognition that positive
action is not the answer to the problem, indeed may make matters worse.
Government has a role to play and the latest Labour Party proposals,
which call for a national childcare strategy to release women for work,
and employment policies which could reduce British working hours (the
longest in Europe) thus enhancing family life, show a more enlightened
approach. Elsewhere in this newspaper this morning we illustrate the
welcome fact that there are alternatives to both tokenism and positive
action.
The clue to success appears to lie in enhancing everyone's
opportunities in a sensitively positive way, thereby providing proper
frameworks for men and women, young and old, coloured and white,
disabled and able. This may sound an obvious approach, but the best
ideas are often uncomplicated. It would also require some deep and
long-term thinking and serious reorganisation of enterprises which have
become accustomed to employing the bolt-on approach to questions of
equality. This will no longer do. Equality is for everyone, and if that
is tautological, so be it.

MIGHT it not be wise for Mr Paul Prescott, Scottish director of
Railtrack, to take one of ScotRail's Sprinter trains to North
Queensferry and actually have a look for himself at the historic Forth
Rail Bridge for which he has been given responsibility? (March 1).
If he visits the vicinity of the north pier of the bridge,
thoughtfully developed as a visitor picnic area, he will see all too
clearly the hold that rust is taking at the base of the main structure
of the bridge, just where it is joined to the stone pier.
Few, if any, will believe his repeated assurances that somehow, unlike
steel in any other exposed marine environment, that used for the Forth
Rail Bridge does not need the protection of paint.
As for his calls for ''sponsorship'' to enable him to do the job
properly, does he really expect these to be taken seriously? Sponsors
have a habit of demanding the fullest facts from potential clients
before they part with a single penny of their money. Bland assurances of
the sort he has been bandying about will convince no-one.

YOUR article on tobacco made much play on the issue of cigarette
smoking by young girls, but contrary to public perception it is a fact
that smoking among 16 to 19-year-old girls has declined dramatically in
recent years, and there has been no increase among the under 16s (March
2).
The figures for those assertions are drawn from the Office of
Population and Censuses (OPCS).
As for the suggestion made that we spend #200m a year promoting our
products, this is wholly misleading because the sum is actually #60m --
within a market which is currently worth over #11billion (from which the
Government creams off over #9billion in tax).
It is perfectly reasonable that we should be free to spend in our
highly competitive market-place.
Our range of 300 brands are bought by 16,000,000 people, some 35% of
the adult population, many of whom resent National No Smoking Day and
the obsessive and intolerant big brother attitude of the single-issue
pressure groups behind it.

IF Paul Prescott sincerely believes that there is nothing other than
surface rust on the Forth Rail Bridge he should arrange to go to see the
bridge for himself (March 1). I will gladly show him parts of the bridge
which are so badly eaten through with rust that they resemble a piece of
gorgonzola cheese. I saw it for myself when I visited the bridge, at
Railtrack's invitation, less than two weeks ago.
The presence of such severe corrosion calls into question not only
Paul Prescott's bland assurances, but Railtrack's persistent denial that
the only evidence of corrosion is some surface rust and flaking paint.
Moreover, it is offensive to imply, as Paul Prescott does, that the
answer to this neglect is for those who have already contributed taxes
and paid fares sufficient properly to maintain the bridge, to get out
begging bowls and seek sponsorship in order to make up for the entirely
notional shortfall in Railtrack's maintenance budget.
The question must be asked as to whether it is right that a publicly
owned body, Railtrack, should be allowed to neglect a national monument
such as the rail bridge, not least given its status as a listed
building. I have marvelled at the Forth Rail Bridge since my childhood
in Edinburgh, just as many millions of people across the world have
wondered at this engineering triumph which remains not only a vital part
of Scotland's current transport infrastructure, but a worldwide symbol
of our national heritage.
The aesthetic and structural integrity of the Forth Rail Bridge must
not be sacrificed to the unworkable absurdities of this Government's
privatisation programme. Paul Prescott should take a leaf out of Chris
Green's book and represent the interests of the Scottish rail network
with the same vigour with which he currently defends this Government's
indefensible destruction of rail services.

<TEXT>
IF Mr Blair's difficulties with Europe and Scottish devolution have
been imposed on him, his struggle to amend the Labour Party's
constitution is self-imposed. It may look like a gamble, since many
Labour activists, certainly in Scotland, like the ideas the clause
encapsulates. True, it sounds old-fashioned, but it does sound -- it has
a resonance and eloquence almost non-existent in contemporary political
documents which are usually designed to offend no-one. The trouble with
Clause 4 is that its sentiments offend many, and, possibly, attract
fewer people than at any time in Labour's history. It is a prescription
the party has progressively abandoned since 1951, the last election in
which Labour promised significant extensions of nationalisation, almost
the sole vehicle proposed for public ownership (ironically enough it had
originally been a Tory structure, though the model Labour used was
derived from municipal experience in Herbert Morrison's London). Labour
failed to promote co-operation as an alternative to nationalisation,
though a separate but allied Co-operative Party often recommended the
extension of co-operation from retailing, where it had long been
successful. When workers' co-ops were eventually tried, it was too late:
and they were confined to businesses in trouble.
Hugh Gaitskell's attempt to jettison Clause 4 failed in the early
1960s but its survival left it drained of vitality, as the Wilson and
Callaghan administrations found its rhetoric irrelevant to their
purposes. Mr Blair's predecessor who had been nurtured by Gaitskell
thought the clause was withering on the vine and should be left to do
so. Mr Blair, who felt unable to reject John Smith's advice on
devolution (in spite of being unhappy with it), was able to press ahead
on this ideological front. And that is the whole point: the new Labour
Party is not to be ideological. It can be radical but the roots of its
radicalism are to be practical rather than visionary. Visionary elements
will survive -- some flourish in all parties -- but in Labour they will
not be elements of state socialism. Mr Blair is arriving where some
German theorists arrived before Clause 4 was drafted and where the
German SPD arrived in the 1950s, but he is travelling for purely
practical purposes. His success will bring a huge propaganda victory:
Labour's modernity will be beyond dispute.
Looking at his efforts in this fashion exposes his motives as more
presentational than profound. Turning the aspirations inherent in Clause
4 from the language of, say, the Authorised King James Version to that
of the New English Bible, is to tame them, so that they lose no votes.
The old British left was less interested in votes than it was in
principles, and that helped give Labour much of its moral purpose and
thrust. Four electoral defeats in a row (and no absolute certainties
about next time), as well as other changes, including the collapse of
socialism internationally, have reduced that conviction somewhat. The
party is now being forced to choose between a sectarian identity with
limited appeal, and a broader, blander, personality. The debate about
the choice may be intense but Mr Blair will win. Although much Labour
energy will be expended on internal strife there is little chance that
he can lose since, if he did, his authority would dissolve and with it
much of Labour's chance of winning next time.

WHILE agreeing with Kathleen Marshall's basic premise that it is
beyond human capability to turn back the clock in respect of the
Ayrshire children who were reunited with their parents after the Court
of Session's reversal, I feel that she has missed the real issue and the
bigger picture.
Mary Hartnoll, whose head has been undeservedly offered up as
sacrifice, is on record of not only raising causes for concern at the
time of the Orkney hearings with central government but, more
importantly, designed a mechanism that integrated police inquiry
training procedures for cases where ritual abuse is alleged.
The thought processes that created the proposal were concerned with
children's rights and ensuring that the voice of the child is heard in
all issues that effect him or her.
Those processes were dismissed by central government because of their
application of balance sheet policies towards social issues. If
Government had listened to Mary Hartnoll at the time of Orkney then
Ayrshire may never have happened and there would be no need to implement
the long process of family recovery the children and their parents are
now facing.
The bigger picture is one that concerns 20,000 children a year being
taken into care and denied access to one parent; they are taken into the
care of a sole parent through a court system that treats children as
property to be divided between couples when they separate or divorce.
This is the issue that the Ayrshire children case should be focusing
our attention on; the harm done to 20,000 children, each and every year,
and their prospective growth into adulthood.
Just as abuse breeds abusers so, on a much larger scale, does the
shift from shared parenting to single parenting breed parents who are
encouraged to walk away from their responsibilities to their children.
However, there is a perceptive wind of change as the UK moves to full
implementation of the United Nations Convention on Rights of the Child;
a change that is manifesting itself in the mediation service that Lord
MacKay has demanded as an alternative to litigation in cases of divorce,
custody, and access.
Kids Need Both Parents (KNBP) was hoping to work with Mary Hartnoll on
developing the first Scottish mediation model in Strathclyde; sadly,
that opportunity has to now be shelved as she is forced to deal with
issues that she highlighted at the time of the Orkney case, and
subsequently inherited from her predecessor; issues that should have
been averted if central government had listened to Mary Hartnoll.
Let us hope that she is allowed to be part of the solution we are
creating, sooner rather than later; a solution that is geared to keeping
families together rather than geared to separating them.
Let us hope that the Gulbenkian Foundation will widen its brief to
encompass the real child abuse issue, the issue of children, who, every
day in our courts, are being denied their rights -- their rights to two
parents.

Carol Craig explains why outdated thinking in equal opportunities
means that positive action exclusively for women and minority groups is
likely to create problems, not solve them.
OVER the past 20 years the philosophy and practice of equal
opportunities has been fairly resistant to change. The underlying ideas
have been around for a long time. They are accepted by managers as a
routine part of what their organisation is about. But now that approach
is being challenged.
The very fact that most of the thinking underlying equal opportunities
policy and practice is that old, should alert us to its inherent
dangers. It was trying to address the problems of a different era.
Think back to the late 70s. Mrs Thatcher had just moved into No 10.
Unemployment was rising, but was small in comparison with today's
levels. Most people still believed we could get back to full employment.
The economy may not have been booming but it was vibrant. Those in work
were not only confident their jobs were secure, they also believed their
standard of living would continue to rise.
Fifteen years on, two recessions later, more than two million people
are unemployed. Those in work have a different mindset. Almost everyone
still with a job is looking over his or her shoulder to see where the
next big change is coming from and how it may hit them this time round.
In their attempts to survive, organisations have restructured.
Restructuring takes many forms but in essence jobs are cut back to save
costs. On top of major redundancy programmes (downsizing), there's
delayering (removing tiers of management), outsourcing (use of
consultants and freelances), and casualisation (temporary contracts
instead of staff posts).
The impact of these changes is increasingly felt by managers
themselves. A job for life has virtually disappeared. And the removal of
so many management jobs means, as one consultant puts it, ''the career
path itself has gone -- in its place is crazy paving and you have to lay
it yourself''. Structural change is not the whole story. Many
organisations are opting for performance-related pay. So even what you
earn in any one year is uncertain.
Inject into this environment a conventional equal-opportunities
policy, with its emphasis on positive action to increase the numbers or
promotion prospects of women and minority groups, and watch an already
sour atmosphere curdle. Behind the scenes they'll mutter: ''You've got
to be a woman, a black or in a wheelchair to get on in here these
days.'' Women applicants are commonly told by male colleagues: ''You're
bound to get an interview,'' or ''You'll be all right. They want a
woman.''
This male resentment, though widespread, is rarely expressed in
public. Even disappointed men are smart enough to know it would do their
career prospects no good to talk down equal opportunities. So resentment
and hostility festers in private.
Recent newspaper reports of an employment agency rejecting male
applicants for shelf-packing jobs because it was ''women's work''
highlights another injustice of the conventional approach to equal
opportunities. Campaigners are vocal on women's right to enter
traditional male jobs and careers, yet say little about jobs still held
exclusively by women. When was the last time you came across a male
secretary or cleaner?
From my experience of equal opportunities work, I believe that in the
present climate, positive action exclusively for women is likely to
generate problems, not solve them.
Take the issue of confidence. Management development courses for women
are run because not enough women apply for promoted posts. Such courses
aim to increase women's confidence to go for management jobs. But if
that promotion results from positive action, a successful women's gender
will be seen as the main reason she got the job. It's not just
colleagues who may think that. The woman herself may begin to believe
that's why she's been promoted. Tokenism? Cynicism? No wonder the
promoted woman's confidence goes down as often as up.
Should that new woman manager then fail to perform to expectations,
her gender will be used to explain her failure. No-one will point to
countless men in promoted posts who are equally useless. Colleagues will
be in no doubt that gender, not individual failings, is the cause. ''I
always knew women weren't up to that job,'' they'll say. Black or
disabled people appointed to jobs in organisations striving to improve
minority representation face the same fate. The net result? Women and
minority groups will be discouraged from applying for promotion. They
know success will still leave them vulnerable.
It is not just men who oppose positive action. The mass of women are
neutral to hostile. Women content to stay in junior jobs are turned off
because women in management strategies do nothing for them.
Women who've already made it up the ladder are intent on distancing
themselves from such strategies for fear they'll be seen as token
beneficiaries.
Ethnic minority employees often react in the same way. In recent years
black people have become critical of positive action training
initiatives, fearing that such schemes marginalise them from the
mainstream. People with disabilities often take the same view.
Ironically, that leaves senior management as the prime exponents of
equal opportunities. Their job is making strategic decisions. Women are
already demonstrating they have the experience, the life skills and the
academic qualifications modern organisations need. Where prejudice
against women persists, eradicating discrimination is vital to
sustaining a highly skilled workforce.
Such senior managers can easily become obsessed with quick-fix
solutions. Progress is measured in crude numbers. For example, the chief
executive of a Local Enterprise Company recently lamented to me the
complete absence of women from his senior management team. His solution:
identify a number of women with the ability to become senior managers.
Then, through a series of quick promotions, pilot them into top jobs.
That constitutes positive discrimination and is illegal in the UK.
Besides, what woman in her right mind would agree to be ''fast-tracked''
in this way if she then arrives, without time to acquire the appropriate
skills, a target for everyone else who believes they could do the job
better?
There is an alternative approach. It involves fundamental change in
the culture of organisations. But such change held little immediate
appeal for my chief executive. It sounds long term. It sounds too
uncomfortable. Equal opportunities strategies conveniently define women
or minority groups as the problem. They offer them a leg-up. But the
assisted then have to adapt and fit into the existing culture.
Recent UK research suggests that equal opportunities strategies
delivering ''universal benefit'' -- eg flexible working schemes for
everyone -- are more successful than those designed to improve the lot
of one particular group. When everyone benefits, there is no divisive
impact. No unfairness. No special pleading. No emphasis on one gender.
This group or that.
Perversely traditional strategies magnify differences between groups
and suppress individuality. They contradict everyday reality. We have
management development and assertiveness courses run exclusively for
women. Since gender is the entry ticket, such courses can embrace Lady
Thatcher, but bar the most timorous man.
It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the US, which has been
pursuing equal opportunities longer than we have, is now moving in a
different direction. American organisations are replacing equal
opportunities strategies with ''diversity management''. Discrimination
in favour of this group or that is giving way to attempts to create
organisational cultures where everyone feels valued.
A recent book by Rajvinder Kandola and Johanna Fullerton, Managing the
Mosaic, examines the difference. The authors argue the essence of
diversity management is to eradicate work cultures where people must
conform and replace them with environments where individuals can work
flexibly and are allowed, within the confines of the organisation's
goals, to be themselves.
That may sound like pie in the sky, but it fits neatly with leading
management thinkers who argue that the world of work must be
revolutionised if organisations are to motivate and retain their best
employees and maximise their effectiveness.
Diversity management offers something to everyone. The tragedy of
equal opportunities is that, despite its rhetoric of valuing everyone,
its focus has been restricted to women and minority groups. It has not
only alienated many men, it has done nothing for those, men and women,
who feel alienated for other reasons -- wrong personality type, wrong
school, whatever. Managing diversity, in a positive way, offers the
chance to enlist all those lost souls in an inclusive movement for real
and lasting change.

The blame for the job losses at BBC Scotland must rest with John Birt
and his concept of Producer Choice.
YESTERDAY'S announcement of almost 100 key job losses at BBC Scotland
was a devastating blow for the nation and, particularly, for its
broadcasting industry. But it could be followed by even more worrying
changes as Queen Margaret Drive continues to suffer from the fallout
effect of John Birt's Producer Choice ethos.
It is understood that another internal department is under threat of
closure as a result of the Director-General's controversial internal
market scheme. The Outside Broadcast Unit, one of the key departments
within BBC Scotland and without which both the current affairs and
sports departments cannot function effectively, has been placed out to
tender as part of the London-inspired Producer Choice process.
The existing OB Unit in Scotland, with some help from its opposite
number in London, has submitted a tender and has a fighting chance of
success. However, four other tenders have also been submitted . . . and
they are all from English companies. It will be a scandal if Scotland
loses out.
There is no good time for a company to announce redundancies but, even
if it tried, the BBC could not have picked a worse time than yesterday.
First you had the welcome news that programme investment in Scotland was
set to reach record levels in the coming year with network finance up by
#10m. Maybe, one thought fleetingly, the Director-General in the Armani
suit was not such a bad chap after all.
But then, hot on its heels, came an announcement which reflected the
downside to Birtism -- the loss of at least 86 (and probably more)
creative posts and the closure of an entire department. No more costume,
no more make-up. Forget your scenic design. Roll the credits. Whatever
way you looked at it, a lot of very talented people were out the Beeb's
revolving door.
If any blame is to be attributed then it must be placed squarely at
the door of John Birt. It was he who, through the BBC's London-based
resources directorate, chose to introduce the concept of Producer
Choice. The idea was -- is -- to ensure that programme makers get
offered the full range of production facilities at rates which are
competitive in the market-place. And that is why BBC Scotland's Costume
Design, Make-Up, Scenic Design, and Scenic Servicing operations are
being axed.
''Despite continuing efforts, and an increase in programme making, the
(Scottish) units to be closed have failed to achieve the level of
utilisation necessary to achieve break-even,'' said a statement. In
other words, Rab C Nesbitt was going to have to look elsewhere for his
bandage and string vest.
In effect, the BBC hopes to cut its overheads by making these people
redundant. They will then re-employ them, as and when, on a freelance or
independent basis. Which is all fine and well so long as it suits the
individuals involved.
However, the uncertainty of a self-employed existence is not to
everyone's taste and the danger is that a lot of them could decide to
turn their back on Scotland and drift south to seek opportunities for
full-time jobs. If that happened then BBC Scotland could find itself
with a very obvious resources problem.
To be fair, it is not a problem which it expects to encounter. BBC
Scotland is enjoying a substantial increase in network commissions at
present and department heads are hopeful that that will continue and,
therefore, provide work for these former employees.
It also has to be said that the design department is a singular one.
STV and Grampian cope admirably without it. BBC Manchester doesn't have
one and much of the design work at the BBC in London is farmed out to
independents. However, its demise at BBC Scotland, coupled with this new
uncertainty about the future of the OB Unit, is symptomatic of a
creeping danger which threatens the service.
The problem is that Birt's Producer Choice does not respect national
boundaries. If BBC Scotland has a responsibility for the production of
programmes for the nation (and it clearly does) then it must have a
similar responsibility to provide the key skills required to make those
programmes.
BBC Scotland staff, particularly the producers, were said to be
devastated by yesterday's announcement. It is the end of an era in many
ways. The Glasgow-based costumes department, for instance, is to be
offered for sale as a working unit but if there are no takers then it
will all be auctioned off.
Many of the producers now feel it is their responsibility to keep the
creative base in Scotland. They plan to do so -- or at least try to do
so -- by pitching for more network programmes. In-house design costs at
present are said to be so financially crippling that producers find it
impossible to keep programmes within budget. Those are the harsh
realities of Producer Choice.
Yesterday's cuts were greeted with a mixture of outrage and deep
concern. In a statement, the Broadcasting Council for Scotland, the
organisation which represents the licence payer and controls the policy
and content of BBC Scotland's programmes, said: ''We have learned that
86 jobs are to be lost and with them an important part of the skills
base which is crucially important to the wellbeing of the broadcasting
industry in Scotland.
''The council believes that any further cuts could destroy the core of
radio and television broadcasting for Scotland and that strategic
investment in resources, represented by people, studios, and equipment
must be retained. The council will be urging the Board of Governors
accordingly.''
The SNP described the cuts as ''further proof of the need for greater
decentralisation of the BBC and of Scotland's need for an autonomous
broadcasting service''.
Mr Nigel Smith, chairman of the Broadcasting for Scotland Campaign,
called on the cuts to be withdrawn until the Broadcasting Council had
the opportunity to consider them.
The move was also condemned by the STUC. General secretary Campbell
Christie is seeking an urgent meeting with both the controller and the
national governor of BBC Scotland to voice his opposition to ''this
unnecessary, ill-conceived, and London-centric decision''.

Iain Wilson explains why power industry regulator Professor Stephen
Charles Littlechild was playing to form yesterday with his crackdown on
electricity prices.
NOBODY should have been surprised when Professor Stephen Charles
Littlechild yesterday put the boot in over electricity prices. The
51-year-old regulator adores football, and he has a penchant for calling
foul as and when necessary to achieve fair play.
But his timing leaves a lot to be desired, according to opponents --
because his cuts of between 11% and 17% came after sales of PowerGen and
National Power shares. They claim the sales would have flopped if
investors had got wind of the new price controls, and also dismiss the
cuts as derisory when compared to the electricity companies' profits and
executives' earnings.
But Mr Littlechild, the quiet-spoken economist from Birmingham
University, where he is on leave of absence, is well-known for playing
to win, and his record is long and illustrious.
He assumed full powers as Director General of Electricity Supply and
head of Offer, the Office of Electricity Regulation, in April, 1991 --
one week after vesting day.
Electricity may have followed telecommunications, gas, and water in
the privatisation timetable, but yesterday's crackdown now puts him at
the top of an already controversial league.
The football analogy is fair. On his appointment, he declared: ''The
fact that we have a large number of companies with different interests
means I will be acting more as a referee between them, rather than in a
David versus Goliath situation.
''My job will be to adjudicate between the parties, rather than to
take up the burden of overseeing one major licensee.''
Mr Littlechild believed then that the Government -- and the
electricity companies -- had already learned the lessons from other
regulators' battles with their industries over prices. Yesterday's
events suggest nothing has changed.
He has breathed the economics of regulation and the nationalised
industries throughout his working life. Indeed, he was party to British
Telecom's privatisation, the first, writing a Government report on
pricing.
His arrival at Offer, which oversees all electricity companies,
including those in Scotland -- and the nuclear industry -- was by a
tortuous route, but now appears inevitable.
Until his appointment, he had spent six years with the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. Work included reviewing the two Scottish electricity
boards.
An academic, he has produced more than 50 papers on economics and
related matters. Spells abroad included posts at Stanford and
Northwestern Universities, and the University of California in Los
Angeles. He has also been a visiting professor at New York and Chicago
universities, among others.
Mr Littlechild, who is married with three children, has insisted all
along that the electricity industry must accept competition will take
place and should react positively to the challenges.
He is also determined there should be no collusion between the firms.
Although accepting that electricity prices charged may be similar
because it is a commodity, he believes there is plenty of scope for
competition in other areas of the business.
His reputation in Scotland is not as well known as in England,
although he occasionally hit the headlines north of the Border.
Late last year, for example, Offer reported Hydro-Electric to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission for refusing to accept a review of its
charges.
Mr Littlechild had received the distribution and supply price controls
in Scotland and recommended both its electricity companies cut bills by
more than #300m over the next three years.
In a separate report to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, he also suggested
that projects for providing electricity from renewable sources -- such
as hydro, wind, and landfill gas -- could cost customers #44m above the
market price over 20 years.
And he was warned of concerns that Scottish Nuclear could have a very
significant market power if its output increases further.
Mr Littlechild has called for a scaling-down of the levy paid by all
electricity consumers to subsidise the nuclear part of the industry.
It would appear his main recreation, over and above football and
genealogy, is to ensure electricity customers' costs are kept down.
The repercussions of that drive yesterday will reverberate in the
corridors of power for a long time.

SENIOR members of the Ulster Unionist Party yesterday refused to name
the Scottish loyalists who are planning to field a candidate against the
Tories in the Perth and Kinross by-election.
Mr Jeffrey Donaldson, UUP honorary secretary, confirmed that his party
had taken part in talks over the issue and had agreed to support a
Scottish unionist candidate, but said his Scottish contacts did not wish
to be identified.
''I have spoken to them several times today and they have said that,
until they have made a final decision on the issue, they do not want to
go public,'' said Mr Donaldson.
A candidate, if any should arise, would come from a group of Scots
unhappy with John Major's framework document for Northern Ireland, he
said.
''They are a number of individuals who, because of their concern at
Conservative policy in relation to the Union, have come together. Some
of them are members of the Conservative Party.''
He said that his own party would provide only support. ''This is not
something we are doing. This is an initiative that has come from
unionists in Scotland. All we have done is respond to a request and say
we would be prepared to support them.''
The proposal came as a surprise to members of the Grand Order of
Orange Lodges yesterday. Senior members of the organisation had lunched
at the weekend with the UUP leader, Mr James Molyneaux, but the subject
had not been discussed.
Mr Jack Ramsay, grand secretary, said: ''If this had been a
development, and knowing Mr Molyneaux for a considerable number of
years, I know he would have mentioned it to our trustees. It was not
mentioned.
''Nothing on this matter has emanated from the Grand Orange Order in
Scotland.''
However, Mr Ramsay added: ''A unionist candidate, of whatever
political persuasion, would be supported by the Orange Order.
''If it directed the thoughts of the Conservative Party to a
consideration of the Union as it stands, then we would be supportive of
anything of that view.''

Rome, Tuesday
SICILY'S latest killing spree is a terror campaign by the Corleonesi
crime clan to discourage mobsters from turning state's evidence,
anti-Mafia experts suggested today.
After the murder last night of the nephew of Tommaso Buscetta, the
US-based ''star'' turncoat, authorities placed surviving family members
under police protection. His death was one of at least 10 attributed to
Mafia killers on the island in recent weeks.
Domenico Buscetta, 45, was shot in the head just after he closed up
his gift shop in Palermo. His father and brother were slain by the Mafia
in 1982. Domenico was at least the tenth relative of Tommaso Buscetta,
who began collaborating with the state in the early 1980s, to be killed.
Testimony from Tommaso Buscetta helped investigators understand the
inner workings of the Mafia and helped bring the convictions of hundreds
of mobsters in several trials in Italy and the United States.
''The death of my nephew is the response to whoever thinks that the
Mafia is finished,'' Buscetta told the Rome newspaper La Repubblica.
The first big Mafioso to turn state's evidence, Buscetta was gradually
joined by hundreds of pentiti, as the turncoats are called, underpinning
the state's uphill battle against organised crime.
However the programme to protect pentiti from mob vendettas has been
criticised as inadequate. There also are fears that some could be Mafia
plants to put investigators off track.
Prosecutors told reporters today that they were convinced the Corleone
crime family was waging a bloody campaign to intimidate potential
turncoats, also as a demonstration that they are in control.
The Mafia wants to ''discourage future defections'' and muzzle those
already cooperating, said Palermo police Chief Arnaldo La Barbera.
Turncoats are the ''gateway to new trials. If they change their minds
and won't talk in the courtroom, that will weaken the prosecution,'' the
police chief told RAI state TV.
Among the current cases based largely on turncoat testimony is the
upcoming trial of former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti. Buscetta is
one of several Mafia turncoats whose testimony led a Palermo judge last
week to indict the politician on charges of having Mafia ties.
Among those recently slain in Palermo was the nephew of Salvatore
Contorno, another important early turncoat.
Prosecutors say the Mafia often strikes when it suspects a breach in
the state's war on organised crime.
The role of pentiti is part of the drama in a television film that had
millions of Italians glued to their sets this week. The latest
installment of Piovra (Octopus, for the Mafia's tentacle-like grip on
Sicily) drew 10.6 million viewers.
In yesterday's La Repubblica, which came out hours before his nephew
was killed, Buscetta wrote an article criticising director Franco
Zeffirelli's move to have the film cancelled on the grounds that it
slandered the image of Sicily.
''I really can't believe that people still say such foolish things,''
Buscetta wrote. ''Fiction doesn't reach the reality of the Mafia and the
life of Mafiosi.''
* The Italian Senate today approved a tax package considered crucial
to the survival of Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's government.
The #7500m deficit-cutting package now faces a more uncertain future
in the Chamber of Deputies, where a 'no' vote by former Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance could scupper the budget and Dini's
government with it.
0  The Alliance earlier rejected a statement from Dini as good as
promising to resign at the end of next month once his limited programme
was completed, saying it did not go far enough to meet the bloc's demand
for a snap General Election by June.--AP/Reuter.

SCHOOL pupils who were told not to go within six inches of each other
to stop them kissing and cuddling in the street were staying defiantly
close yesterday.
The children at fee-paying Dollar Academy, Clackmannanshire, were told
to keep their distance by school rector John Robertson.
He announced the ruling at a school assembly last Friday because he
believed such behaviour was not in keeping with the school's image.
Pupils believe an incident at a school disco last Tuesday when two
pupils got a little too close for comfort had influenced his decision.
The six-inch rule found favour with the chairman of the parents'
association, Mr Donald Ross, who described it as sensible.
Mr Ross said the rule had existed for some time and the rector was
simply re-invoking it.
The school motto is Juventutis Veho Fortunas (I carry the fortunes of
youth).
As the majority of the 1100 pupils spilled out of the school gates at
lunchtime the boys and girls walked shoulder to shoulder, well within
six inches of each other.
As they got out of sight of the school, one couple held hands, while
another couple hugged.
Nobody actually kissed: according to older pupils, that is kept for
more private moments under a derelict railway bridge nearby.
Half-way through the lunch-break, prefects told pupils not to talk
about the rule. Until then it proved difficult to keep them quiet.
One 15-year-old boy said: ''The headmaster stood up and said spring
was in the air and he was going to put a bit of frost over it. We just
couldn't believe it. Some of the pupils here are 16 and 17 years old.
''How can you expect to tell someone that age they're not allowed to
hold hands with their partners in public. It's just really silly.''
Locals came to the defence of the pupils and criticised the rule.
Ms Maggie McCutcheon, who runs a shop in Dollar, described it as
ridiculous. A former pupil of the #8300 a year school, she said: ''These
pupils are a credit to the school. It's just unbelievably silly for the
headmaster to mention the six-inch rule.
''I went to Dollar Academy in the early 1970s and there was a similar
rule about keeping your distance then. This is the 1990s and you would
think they would be a bit more tolerant. The children come into my shop
most days and they are very polite and well-mannered.''
A child psychologist, Professor Rudolph Schaffer of the University of
Strathclyde, said the rule made the school a laughing stock.
''If there is a problem with pupils kissing in public why didn't he
just say that.
''He could have just warned them and left it at that. Bringing in a
six-inch rule makes no difference whatsoever.''
Mr Robertson, who is in his early 40s, and who took up his post last
year after being deputy rector for seven years, was unavailable for
comment.

HAVE you got spirit? Does the spectre of night work not bother you?
Then perhaps a spell with Witchery Tours, which runs evening
excursions that give an insight into past goings-on in and around
Edinburgh's Old Town, could be right up your dark alley.
The company, which began 10 years ago, is searching for ''ghostly
characters'' to add atmosphere to its guided walking tours.
Qualifications to become an all-year-round part-time ghost include a
decent level of fitness -- there are four changes of costume per tour --
and a healthy pair of lungs for the ''general terrifying'' of the
participants.
Successful applicants, who are likely to have an interest in history,
could at a later date be chosen to play the part of highwayman Adam
Lyal, executed in the Grassmarket in 1811, who leads the tour.
Meanwhile, they will be playing four sinister figures -- the Mad Monk
of the Cowgate, the skeleton of bodysnatcher William Burke, witch Agnes
Fynnie, strangled and burnt on Castle Hill in 1641, and the ghost of
sailor Angus Roy, who had a tragic accident at sea and returned to haunt
people who made fun of him.
About 15 applications have been received so far. A bank clerk, a
computer programmer, an ecologist and a kennel assistant are among the
hopefuls who believe this is no dead-end job.

AN ITALIAN immigrant feared every bone in his body was going to be
broken when three men arrived at his door to discuss a debt, the High
Court in Glasgow was told yesterday.
Saverio Giugliano said he got his shotgun and fired a warning. But he
had not noticed one of the men 30 yards away, and Trento Girasoli's
buttock and thigh were peppered with shot.
Giugliano, whose wife Anna Marie is a Glasgow Italian, faced
imprisonment and deportation over the incident. But after hearing of the
''exceptional circumstances'', Lord Mayfield decided not to grant the
deportation order requested by the Crown and placed Giugliano on
deferred sentence for a year.
Giugliano, 33, from Naples, had originally been charged with
assaulting Mr Girasoli and two other men, Pasqualle Verallo and Robert
McClelland, by firing a shotgun at them to the danger of their lives and
shooting Mr Girasoli on the body.
However, the Crown accepted that he had not meant to assault anyone
and Giugliano pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of culpably and
recklessly discharging the shotgun in the driveway of his house at
Maxwell Drive, Pollokshields, Glasgow, last April.
Mr Gerald Monaghan, defending, said that Giugliano, who emigrated from
Italy 19 months before the incident, had borrowed #1800 from Mr Verallo,
a fish and chip shop owner, so he could buy his own fish and chip shop.
When the deal fell through Mr Verallo demanded his money back.
Guigliano gave him #1000. He said he withheld the balance because Mr
Verallo had given him misleading information about the shop's turnover.
He said he kept #800 to cover extra expenses he had incurred.
Giugliano told the court that he had heard rumours of Mr Verallo
having two ''heavies'', and that a threat had been made that every bone
in his body would be broken if he did not pay up.
He said that when the men arrived at his house he fired the gun to
scare them off.
Lord Mayfield said that he had considered ''the exceptional
circumstances in this case''. He gave Giugliano the opportunity to repay
the outstanding sum of money, and deferred sentence for 12 months.

<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister yesterday poured scorn on Labour wrangling over
Clause 4 of the party's constitution, telling MPs that most sensible
people realised the ''dinosaur'' of public ownership had been dead for
years.
The only surprise was that a substantial number of Labour Party
members still did not understand that, Mr Major told the Commons.
His comments came a day after the Transport and General Workers Union
told the party that the 77-year-old clause committing Labour to the
principle of common ownership should remain -- a move seen as the
biggest setback so far to Opposition leader Tony Blair's attempt to
modernise his party's constitution.
Horsham Tory MP Sir Peter Hordern 0asked: ''Isn't it extraordinary
that a major political party should spend so much time on Clause 4?''
The Prime Minister said there were ''very few people who have sensibly
looked at the matter who do not believe that Mr Blair is right to seek
the abolition of a dinosaur that most sensible people realise has been
dead for the last 20 or 30 years.''
Last night, Labour trade and industry spokesman Brian Wilson
challenged claims Mr Major made on subsidies to public utilities.
He wrote to Mr Major: ''You asserted that before privatisation, 'the
taxpayer was paying #50m a week in order to subsidise these
utilities'.''
Mr Wilson, however, said that ''the total amount received by the
Treasury from the gas, water, and electricity industries, in the period
from 1979 until privatisation, was #10 billion in today's prices.''

A LABOUR MP last night threatened to report Scottish Homes to a
Government Ombudsman over the involvement of some of its staff in a bid
to become the new landlords for more than 2000 of its rented homes in
Glasgow.
Mr Michael Martin, MP for Glasgow Springburn, said that Gemini, an
embryonic housing association which includes several Scottish Homes
staff, was enjoying an unfair advantage over other potential landlords
in the contest, and that those employees were effectively trying to hang
on to their jobs.
His claims were immediately denied by Scottish Homes.
The national housing agency is gradually transferring all its rented
housing stock to other landlords. Gemini, described as a ''tenant-staff
partnership'', is competing against seven other housing groups to become
the landlords of 2300 homes in the north of Glasgow.
Mr Martin, who raised the subject of Gemini in a late-night Commons
debate last month, said yesterday: ''Scottish Homes is showing undue
favour to this organisation, to the detriment of other organisations
which want to take over the properties. I think that is extremely
unfair.''
Mr Martin said that Scottish Homes had the dual task of not only
unloading the rented property but also being adjudicator in cases where
there was more than one prospective new landlord, and asked how it could
be an impartial judge.
A spokesman for Scottish Homes confirmed that it had approved #35,000
of ''seed-corn'' funding for Gemini, the maximum available to such
start-up housing organisations.
He described Gemini as a combination of staff and tenants. In the
main, the work being done by those Scottish Homes staff involved in the
project to develop it was being carried out in their own time.
''Scottish Homes housing management staff have a code of conduct which
requires them to separate out work they do for Scottish Homes and any
time they spend developing initiatives. They can only do that with prior
approval from their managers.''
The spokesman denied that Scottish Homes staff involved in groups such
as Gemini had an unfair advantage. ''Scottish Homes has set up a
separate unit to handle the transfer of houses. Those housing managers
are not the people who handle the transfer.''
He stressed that any change had to be tenant-led and that a
prospective new landlord had to show Scottish Homes that it had the
clear support of tenants.
He also dismissed suggestions that such staff were effectively trying
to hang on to their jobs.
The spokesman added: ''We would expect a new landlord to take over the
existing housing management staff as part of the transfer of
undertakings.

FERRY company Caledonian MacBrayne is to receive a 24% increase in its
Scottish Office subsidy, partly to take account of the substantial loss
of revenue it will suffer when the Skye Bridge opens in September.
The subsidy allows the company to cover an operating loss without
passing it on in unacceptably high fares. It will stand at #8.3m in the
forthcoming financial year. It had begun 1994/95 at #5.7m, but was
increased by #1m.
Despite this rise, fares throughout the CalMac network will go up by
an average 3%, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said yesterday.
Mr Lang explained the amount of subsidy reflected an increased
requirement for grant compared with the 1994-95 level, and took into
account the effect of the proposed closure of the company's Kyle of
Lochalsh/Kyleakin service.
In addition it took account of ''the costs associated with the
introduction, also later in 1995, of a major new vessel on the Ullapool
to Stornoway service; and the costs of compliance with additional safety
requirements on the vessels''.
CalMac managing director Colin Paterson said last night that he
thought it a fair settlement. He would not say how much the Kyle of
Lochalsh ferry generated for the company.

SCOTLAND'S reigning pipe band champions are racing up the pop charts
-- in France.
The Shotts &amp; Dykehead Caledonian Pipe Band are featured on a compact
disc recording by French guitarist Dan Ar Bras.
The CD, on the Sony label, has already sold 200,000 copies since its
release just weeks ago, outstripping sales by all of the major rock
stars.
Now, French radio listeners are clamouring to get their hands on the
band's own big-selling CD, By The Water's Edge, making it the
fastest-selling pipe band record ever.
The pipers' own album features Suite Ecosse, written by the Frenchman.
He was so moved by their interpretation of his tune that he invited
them to join him for a guest spot on his album, Heritage Des Celtes.
Once released, his CD immediately picked up a lot of airplay on French
radio stations.
Record company bosses at Sony predict it is now poised to become an
international smash.
Meanwhile the Shotts &amp; Dykehead band is preparing for a series of
French concert dates later this year.
They will star at a big traditional music festival in Paris in May,
followed by a mini-tour of Brittany.

AN American-owned company, Procord Ltd, was yesterday named as the new
owner of a part of the Atomic Energy Authority.
An agreement has been struck in principle for the sale of the
Facilities Services Division (FSD) which currently employs 950 people at
six AEA sites in Scotland and England, with 140 at Dounreay.
Unions at the Caithness plant fear the sell-off will mean loss of jobs
and established terms and conditions.
Those workers involved provide a range of services ranging from
catering and vehicle maintenance to calibrating radiation monitors and
erecting and maintaining buildings. The bulk of FSD's #9m turnover,
however, comes from its engineering workshop.
AEA spokesman Nick Parsons yesterday stressed that responsibility for
the safety of all the AEA nuclear sites would still be with AEA
Government Division.
He said: ''Obviously the Government's Nuclear Inspectorate will need
to ratify the changes of arrangements with this sale.''
He was confident that the interests of the employees would be well
served by the deal with Procord, and said: ''They will transfer with
their existing terms and conditions. Procord has said it has no plans
for redundancies and the accent is on growth.''
Procord was set up in 1991. Three years later it became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Johnson Controls Inc of Milwaukee, which is one of the top
100 companies on the New York Stock Exchange, with an annual turnover of
#4000m.
* The leaking of plutonium dust into the atmosphere at Dounreay last
month did not exceed emission limits but urgent investigations are
continuing, according to Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro
yesterday.
A report on the incident would be published in the Health and Safety
Executive's quarterly statement of nuclear incidents, Sir Hector said in
a Parliamentary answer.

THE Prime Minister and Citizen's Charter Minister David Hunt yesterday
launched a twin assault on a Labour claim that the role of women in
society was being neglected.
On the eve of International Women's Day, the Prime Minister insisted
opportunities for women had been increased dramatically, and Mr Hunt
accused Labour of moving into ''an ideological cul-de-sac of trendy
posturing and political correctness.''
The exchanges took place against the background of a Labour-initiated
debate in which the Government was accused of failing to implement
undertakings it had given to promote the progress of women towards
equality by the year 2000.
Labour's motion attacking the Government's record on women's issues
was defeated by 294 votes to 267, a Government majority of 27.
The debate was opened for Labour by Front Bench spokeswoman Clare
Short who, within a few minutes, was challenged over Labour's plans for
a Scottish Parliament by Aberdeen South Tory MP Raymond Robertson.
He demanded to know Ms Short's view on the proposals which, he said,
would mean that half of the membership of a directly elected Scottish
Assembly would have to be women.
Ms Short told him: ''I applaud this commitment, and parliaments around
the world are moving towards having half women representation.''
The Labour spokeswoman also was interrupted during her remarks by Tory
MP Lady Olga Maitland (Sutton and Cheam) who said Labour's campaign to
bring more women into parliament was ''frankly patronising and insulting
to women because what you are trying to do is bring in positive
discrimination rather than allowing women to get to Westminster on
virtual merit, which is how I prefer to be here.''
Ms Short told her: ''The view of the people of Britain is that the
people who are in the House of Commons at the moment could not possibly
have been selected on merit.''
Mr Hunt took the line that over the last 10 years the number of women
in employment had increased by 1.369m, with a 14% rise in women working
full time and a 19% rise in those working part time.
The Minister said: ''There is no question that in the past women who
wanted to work often got a raw deal, but over the past 10 to 15 years
this Government has taken action on a very broad front.''
Ms Short argued that women often found themselves in part-time jobs
with low pay and poor pension rights. Women were used as cheap labour
while men were displaced in the labour market.
Winding up for the Opposition, Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet
Harman said the woman's role was now vital not only in the family but
also in the world of work.
''I don't believe the Tory Government are capable of a sensible public
policy response to this huge change.''
Replying, junior Agriculture Minister Angela Browning, who is also
co-chairman of the Women's National Commission, said that, however
difficult it was to get elected to the Commons, she would rather do so
under the existing arrangements than be the ''token woman''.

FIFTY jobs in Glasgow and 140 nationwide are to be lost because of a
huge slump in orders for signalling work, it was announced yesterday.
The anticipated income of Signalling Control UK, which was one of two
businesses set up less than a year ago as part of British Rail's
break-up for sale, has fallen from #190m to #105m, a drop of 45%.
The management last night confirmed that 50 of 123 jobs will go in
Glasgow, plus 50 in the West Midlands, 15 at Swanley in Kent, eight in
York, and 17 at its London headquarters.
A spokesman insisted that reductions in both major and minor
signalling schemes had made it necessary ''to match resources more
closely to current levels of work, and those predicted for the
forseeable future''.
However, the firm, which employs 800, refused to lay the blame on
Government cutbacks, and in particular its budget restrictions on
Railtrack, which is now responsible for infrastructure -- including
signals and lines.
It said only that its anticipated workload is falling, and that the
firm faces further pressure from competition.
Mr Richard Williams, managing director, declined to comment when asked
if signalling work is slowing down in a bid to keep costs low in the
run-up to privatisation.
He also refused to spell out the possible implications for rail,
including those of safety, of such a dramatic cut in his workforce. The
company specialises in supplying signalling services, including design
and consultancy.
Mr Williams argued that, as only a supplier, such questions --
including the prospects now for a West Coast main line refurbishment --
should be addressed to other parties.
He stressed Signalling Control UK, still formally part of British Rail
but due to be sold later this year, is ready and willing to tender for
any West Coast upgrading work.
The firm's main rival, Interlogic Control Engineering, has already
shed 180 jobs because of the downturn in business.
Last night, Labour's Scottish industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson,
said: ''Railway manufacturing is being slaughtered by the slump in
orders.
''It is perfectly clear you cannot have an industry without continuity
of orders, and that the privatisation process has caused a hiatus.
''Some 5000 jobs were lost last year in the railway manufacturing
industry, and the figure is increasing rapidly.''
Signalling Control, which last year completed #500,000 worth of
signalling work at Haymarket in Edinburgh, believes the job losses will
be achieved through voluntary redundancy.
The British Railways Board said the jobs will go in the next two
months.
Mr Dennis Cameron, assistant general secretary of the Transport
Salaried Staffs' Association, said the loss of so many jobs in railway
technology was of concern. He blamed the ''ill-conceived'' privatisation
of BR for the cuts.
Warning of safety risks, he added: ''The reduction in infrastructure
investment has caused these job losses, and will undoubtedly lead to
more speed restrictions and longer journey times for passengers and
freight. The consequences of more speed restrictions must create a
possible risk to safety on the line.''
Railtrack Scotland said only that any job losses were a matter of
regret.

SCOTLAND'S first centre for entrepreneurial studies was hailed
yesterday as a project that would boost the country's economy.
The centre will open in October, as part of the business faculty at
the Glasgow Caledonian University. The university's partners in the
venture, Scottish Enterprise and Dunbartonshire Enterprise, are
providing a grant of #200,000.
Students will be taught by established Scottish entrepreneurs as well
as the faculty's lecturers, and will be sent on placements with
fledgling companies.
Mr David Pearson, director of enterprise development at Dunbartonshire
Enterprise, said that part of the task was to change young people's
attitudes towards starting new businesses.
A recent survey in Dunbartonshire had shown that the young saw
entrepreneurs as greedy, selfish, mean and cocky. Few of those surveyed
aspired to be an entrepreneur, and few believed they had what it took to
be one.
The head of the centre will be Professor Richard Weaver, who said an
entrepreneurial culture could best be developed through the education
system.

JACQUELINE Bruce will spend today, International Women's Day, humphing
25kg bags of coal to top-flat customers in Edinburgh.
Mrs Bruce, 31, needs no assistance from women's rights campaigners to
help her achieve fulfilment. She has already got there. Pitching in with
her husband, John, 33, at the sharp end of the family business is what
she wants to be doing, even when it means hard labour and grime on her
face.
However, she spares a thought for women who feel that their gender
deprives them of a fair deal in a man's world. ''I think International
Women's Day is a great idea. It highlights the fact that so many women
don't get the opportunity to do the work they want to do,'' she said
after another day of toil.
Mrs Bruce, who has a seven-year-old daughter, Cheryl, worked in
bookbinding before she and her husband, whose father was a coal
merchant, married. She began working shoulder-to-shoulder with her
husband in Bruce &amp; Tait about four years ago.
The couple deliver for city company Bruce Lindsay Coal Ltd (the Bruce
in the firm's name is only a coincidence) when they are not replenishing
the cellars of their own business's customers.
Their work takes them all over Edinburgh, including some of the most
desirable residential areas, where the customers, at least one of whom
is a titled lady, have become used to seeing a woman carrying coal.
While Mr Bruce carries 50kg bags, his wife restricts herself to 25kg.
''But I do tend to do all the top flats, and I make up for carrying the
smaller bags by being quicker on my feet,'' she said.
The only concession she enjoys is that she is first into the bath at
night. ''After all, I've got the tea to make and then the housework to
do,'' she said.
The couple will leave daughter Cheryl to decide her own career pattern
when the time comes. They would not object if she chose to go into the
family business, and join them in the pale blue converted ambulance in
which they carry their wares. ''But at the moment she doesn't like the
idea at all,'' her father said.

Oslo, Tuesday
A BRITON accused of murder told a Norwegian court he could remember
little of what happened after he claimed he was attacked by the victim,
a homosexual former doctor.
Christopher Kirby, 32, of Stockton-on-Tees, pleaded not guilty in the
Oslo court to the murder of Tage Ansethmoen 34, who was stabbed at least
20 times in the chest and head, newspapers said.
He told the court he did not believe he had killed the Norwegian in
his bedroom after a night on the town.
''I have an image of a knife, but I can't put it in my hand,'' Mr
Kirby was reported to have said when the murder trial opened in Oslo's
Superior Court yesterday.
Mr Ansethmoen was found stabbed to death in his Oslo apartment on
November 23, 1991, shortly after he was paroled from prison. He had been
sentenced for the attempted murder of an 81-year-old woman.
An obscene phrase in English and misspelled Norwegian words were found
written on the wall of Mr Ansethmoen's flat.
''It was just some scribbling I did out of boredom,'' Mr Kirby told
the court.
At first, police concentrated their search in Oslo's gay community,
where Mr Ansethmoen was active. A later tip led them to suspect Mr
Kirby.
More than two years later, Mr Kirby was arrested in India, and turned
over to Norway on murder charges. If convicted, he could face 21 years
in prison, Norway's harshest punishment.
In a newspaper interview, Mr Kirby said he, a Norwegian woman, and a
British friend had gone to the cinema and then went out drinking.
After the woman went home, the two Britons met Mr Ansethmoen, who,
according to the autopsy report, was extremely drunk.
''We agreed to help him home. That's how we ended up in the
apartment,'' Mr Kirby claimed. He added that he and his friend were also
drunk.
In court, Mr Kirby claimed the doctor attacked him, grabbing his hair
and clothes, after he helped him into bed.
''I don't remember more. I was stunned by the unexpected attack,'' he
tol newspapers.
However he denied stabbing Mr Ansethmoen. ''I would have remembered it
if I had held a knife.''
The trial is scheduled to last four days but a verdict may take
longer.--AP.

<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979501276</RECORDNO>

THE bizarre case of a police inspector's friendship with a 78-year-old
widow has unfolded at a sheriff court.
It involves the senior policeman, the widow -- who insists on being
known as 'Madame' -- a motor-home and the disappearance of a cooker.
Their friendship turned sour after the inspector became woried about
the demeanour of Madame, who said she prayed to the Almighty to destroy
her enemies -- and at least two of them had died.
Police Inspector William Matheson, 50, and his wife, Rosemary, are
alleging defamation by Madame Anna Marsh and claiming a total of #50,000
compensation.
They also want a court order to prevent her from defaming or
slandering them.
The couple say the pensioner sent defamatory letters to Mr Matheson's
superiors, their next door neighbours and Mrs Matheson's bosses.
Madame Marsh, of Campbell House, Berryhill Road, Cumbernauld -- who
insisted in court on being called 'Madame' -- is defending herself in
the action.
Yesterday, it was claimed by Madame Marsh at Airdrie Sheriff Court
that the inspector contacted her after he had heard she was a rich widow
with an expensive car.
She claimed Mr Matheson conned her into taking him on a ''freebie
holiday'' to Belgium in her motor-home, which she planned to sell when
they arrived.
The officer, who is based at Lanark, said he went with her because he
was worried for her health.
The pair had become friendly through their shared interest in cats and
caravans, the court heard.
Madame Marsh even altered her will to leave the policeman her mobile
home, after he offered to look after her cats when she died.
However, she changed it back after the friendship ended.
Madame Marsh now claims the policeman only contacted her after hearing
''police gossip'' that she was a wealthy widow.
Mr Matheson, on the other hand, says they became friendly after Madame
Marsh came to him looking for advice about a motoring offence.
He tried to end their friendship after becoming concerned about her
demeanour.
Mr Matheson continued: ''She said that she needed to have a 10-minute
period of prayer so that she could ask for the Almighty to destroy her
enemies.
''She said that, as a result of that kind of action, at least two
people she knew about had passed away.
''She said she thought of that as a punishment for people who crossed
her.''
After Madame Marsh sent the letters, the officer was the subject of a
year-long investigation by police disciplinary officers.
They took no action against him. The procurator-fiscal also decided to
take no action.
On Monday, the court heard that the case centred on a trip to Belgium
to sell Madame Marsh's mobile home.
Inspector Matheson, of Brownlee Road, Law, Lanarkshire, says he acted
as a good Samaritan by accompanying Madame Marsh on the trip, but then
was landed with a #1,500 bill and a claim that he had stolen a cooker.
The court was told that, after he had accompanied her to Zeebrugge,
she reported him to the police for stealing a cooker from the vehicle.
Inspector Matheson then had his home and caravan in Argyll searched by
detectives, but nothing was found.
The cooker was later found in the block of flats in which Madame Marsh
lives.
Mr Matheson's solicitor, Mr Greig Sanders, said: ''It has been
suggested to you that you are a swindler, fraudster, conman and thief,
that you were defrauding her for money for a holiday in Scotland,
Eng-land and Belgium.''
Mr Matheson replied: ''It was totally and utterly false and malicious
for Madame Marsh to suggest that the journey was made for any other
reason than to get her van from A to B for the purpose of trading it
in.''
The case, before Sheriff Ian Simpson, continues.

Remagen, Tuesday
GERMAN and American veterans who fought each other here 50 years ago
gathered today to remember the Americans' capture of a bridge that was
not supposed to exist and their crossing of a river they had not
expected to see.
The river was the Rhine, and the battle the US troops began at the
Ludendorff Bridge hastened the demise of the Third Reich. About 600 US
and German veterans and their relatives attended a fiftieth anniversary
ceremony under stone towers that are all that remain of the bridge.
Retired US Army Lt Col George Ruhlen, 84, said the early capture of
the bridge hastened the end of the war. Yet the capture was unplanned.
The First Army Group had been ordered to reach the Rhine then proceed
south to join with the 3rd Army Group of General George Patton.
The Americans had been told that Hitler had destroyed all bridges over
the Rhine. As the 27th Armored Infantry Battalion prepared to cross,
German soldiers on the other side set off a dynamite charge that rocked
the bridge, but did not destroy it.
More than 100 US troops swarmed across and secured a foothold on the
other side. Within a week, Gen Dwight Eisenhower had poured 25,000 men
with tanks, artillery, and trucks across the bridge.
German veterans today thanked the Americans for having the courage to
take the bridge, and cursed the Wehrmacht officers who wanted them to
fight to the bloody end.
Hans Scheller, German commander of the bridge, was executed 50 years
ago along with three other officers for letting the span fall into the
Americans' hands. His son, Gerd, today said: ''In the name of two
post-war generations, I want to thank the Americans for acting as
resolutely as they did on March 7, 1945.''
Hitler threw everything at the bridge: 367 aircraft; V-2 rockets;
howitzers; and the ME-262, an experimental jet fighter. Hundreds of
Americans were killed.
The bridge collapsed March 17, taking 28 US Army engineers with it. By
then the Americans had built two pontoon bridges over the Rhine.--AP

Santiago, Tuesday
RESCUERS have abandoned their search for a 70-year-old British solo
yachtsman lost in seas off southern Chile. Fierce weather made it too
dangerous to continue, the Chilean navy said.
The navy sent a ship, en route from Japan to the southern Chilean port
Puna Arenas, to search for the yacht after distress signals were
received from sailor Harry Mitchell.
The navy said it would continue to alert ships in the area if any
fresh signals from Mitchell were received.
The navy had received five signals from the yacht's distress beacon.
The yacht had been taking part in the third leg of the BOC Challenge
round-the-world race from Sydney to Punta del Este, Uruguay.
Mitchell, the oldest competitor in the race, was sixth in his class
and 12th overall.--Reuter

Nancy, Tuesday
A FRENCH schoolgirl aged 14 was arrested today for strangling a
classmate in a school lavatory.
Friends of the victim said the killing followed a quarrel. The alleged
killer accused the victim of telling other students that she was a
thief.
Police believe it is the first murder of one schoolgirl by another in
France.
The dead girl, identified only as Sabrina, was found yesterday in a
bolted-shut toilet cubicle at the Jacques Callot school in Vandoeuvre, a
suburb of the eastern city of Nancy. Synthetic cords were tightly bound
around her throat, police said.
The suspect, identified only as Leila, was arrested as she tried to
return to her parents' flat in a poor housing scheme. It had been staked
out by police.
Authorities said Leila, from a family of Turkish immigrants, had been
expelled from another school for threatening to kill a teacher.--AP.

Paris, Tuesday
TWO new polls today confirmed that Paris mayor Jacques Chirac is
leading the race for the French presidency, only seven weeks ahead of
the first round of voting.
Chirac would defeat conservative rival Prime Minister Edouard Balladur
and Socialist contender Lionel Jospin in the initial voting round and go
on to defeat either man in a second run-off round, according to a poll
for Pris Match.
In the first round Chirac would win 24.5% to 20% for Jospin and 18%
for Balladur, while in the run-off he would defeat the premier by 59 to
41% and the Socialist by 57 to 43%, the institute said.
A poll for the weekly L'Express showed the three main contenders in
the April-May contest in a dead heat in a first round of voting but
Chirac defeating either man in a run-off.
This survey assumed that former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a
conservative, would enter the race. However he later said he had decided
against it.
Until last week, Balladur had long been favourite in the election
campaign, but he tumbled in the polls last week after a wiretapping
scandal and a Franco-American spy row.
French voters find Chirac more competent and more likeable than
Balladur or Jospin, according to a third poll for the weekly La Vie
magazine. It found that voters prefer to listen to Chirac on television
and feel he understands their concerns better.--Reuter.

Zagreb, Tuesday
CROATIA will risk diplomatic retaliation and stick by its decision to
kick out UN peacekeepers who have policed a ceasefire with rebel Serbs
since 1992, Foreign Minister Mate Granic said today.
''Croatia is now facing huge pressure from the international
community, even threats of freezing all relations with us,'' he told the
state news agency. ''But our decision on UN withdrawal is final.''
Croatia has ordered 12,000 UN troops to leave from April 1, arguing
that their presence helped cement territorial gains made by minority
Serbs in a 1991 rebellion against Croatia's secession from Serbian-led
Yugoslavia.
Zagreb's move stunned the United Nations and set diplomacy in frantic
motion to persuade Zagreb to allow the UN Protection Force to stay and
to refrain from military action that could ignite a wider Balkan war.
US Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke had talks with
senior Croatian ministers yesterday but Zagreb clung to its demand that
Unprofor leave.
''We are ready for certain international supervision and our basic aim
now is to find the model of such supervision that would be acceptable to
Croatia,'' Granic said. ''I believe there are good chances to achieve
it.''
Croatia has asked for an international task force under the aegis of
Nato powers to secure its borders with Serbia and Bosnia, cutting off
arms supplies for the rebel Krajina Serbs.
The idea has been rebuffed by Nato and the European Union who fear
being drawn into fighting with Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia.
International mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg hinted
today that the UN might change its mandate to accommodate ''legitimate
Croatia's demands'', avoid a wider war, and foster peace efforts.
Croatia heightened concern about a drift to war yesterday when it
formalised a military alliance with Bosnia's Muslim-led government
against the separatist Serbs who hold chunks of land in both countries.
At the weekend, the Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic warned
UN commander Lieutenant-General Rupert Smith that he would demand a UN
withdrawal from Sarajevo and government-held enclaves if Croatia stood
by its decision to eject UN peacekeepers.
The departure of peacekeepers from rebel Serb-held areas in Croatia
could provide a convenient excuse for the Bosnian Serbs to renege on the
Bosnian ceasefire, which runs out a month later, UN officials said.
The Serbs have threatened to block supplies of aid to Muslim enclaves
unless the UN gives them more aid. Officials say the Serbs may try to
stockpile fuel with the intention of fighting a spring war.--Reuter.

Los Angeles, Tuesday
THE defence team of O J Simpson today renewed its attack on one of the
key detectives in the case, asking Judge Lance Ito for records of police
investigations into Detective Mark Fuhrman's conduct.
Carl Douglas said Simpson's lawyers wanted to question Fuhrman about
police inquiries into his comments about Nicole Brown Simpson's anatomy,
a cartoon found on his desk containing Nazi insignia, and defence claims
that he planted a blood-stained glove on the defendant's estate.
The defence has tried to brand Fuhrman as a racist cop who planted the
glove behind Simpson's mansion the morning after his ex-wife and her
friend were murdered. The glove matched one found at the murder scene.
Fuhrman was expected to take the witness stand soon. The judge said he
would review the records in the recess.
Simpson, a former American football star who later found fame as an
actor and broadcaster, denies the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and
Ronald Goldman.
Douglas said the possession of a cartoon containing Nazi symbols or
insignia ''would be very relevant to our claim that Mr Fuhrman may well
harbour certain racial attitudes or thoughts or opinions''.
Simpson is black. Fuhrman is white, as were the victims.
Fuhrman's lawyer, Robert Tourtelot, said last week that the Nazi logo
was part of a cartoon by Pulitzer Prizewinner Paul Conrad, depicting an
ominous rise of fascism in Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
''Conrad's not a Nazi,'' Tourtelot said. ''Neither is Mark Fuhrman.''
Tourtelot said the detective collected Conrad cartoons.
* A judge today sealed the files and issued a gag order in a child
custody dispute between Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark and her
estranged husband.
Gordon Clark filed a court declaration late last month seeking custody
of the couple's two young sons, saying they were ''starved for
affection'' by the long hours Ms Clark devotes to the trial.
Ms Clark's lawyers went to court yesterday to request that the divorce
and custody files be sealed and to seek the gag order preventing lawyers
from discussing the case out of court.--Reuter/AP.

RESPONSIBILITY for helping some small and medium-sized Scottish
companies develop new projects is being moved from London to Scotland,
the Prime Minister announced yesterday.
He said the Scottish Office now would be in charge of a range of new
business schemes previously run by the Department of Trade and Industry.
They will include plans to help small and medium-sized companies
improve their business practices and produce new ideas.
However, the DTI will retain overall responsibility for certain
schemes it considers better run for administrative reasons from London.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said that, through time, about #7m a year
would be available to help the companies.
However, SNP leader Alex Salmond said that, despite the change-over,
the purse-strings still would be held in London.
Mr Salmond said: ''Whatever nominal responsibilities are held by the
Scottish Office,everyone knows the purse-strings are controlled by
London.
''Lang's authority is restricted to dividing up the limited slices of
cake, but it is still being baked in Whitehall.''
Among the projects transferred by the DTI to the Scottish Office is
one competition to financially support companies with innovative and
commercially viable projects.
There also will be special help for established independent firms and
groups with up to 250 employees who wish to start new research and
development projects.
Mr Lang said: ''I am very pleased that responsiblity now lies in
Scotland for all schemes and services to support innovation which are
delivered at the local level.
''Resources also will be used to provide additional services from
business shops and the Highlands and Islands Business Information
Source.''
The move follows a review announced in a Government White Paper
designed to transfer responsibility from Whitehall to Scotland.

<HEADLINE>Sheriff is urged to reject suicide theory</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979501293</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SHERIFF was yesterday urged to rule out the suggestion that a diver
took his own life during a bid to recover smuggled drugs off Scotland's
north-east coast.
Sheriff Frank Keane was also told it was impossible to determine
exactly what happened to Mr Stewart Locke in the moments before the
tragedy.
Mr Locke, 24, of Baird Road, Strichen, Aberdeenshire, drowned while
diving to recover #20m worth of cannabis resin from the seabed off
Scotstown Beach, Peterhead, in October 1993. He left a widow and two
young children.
The drugs, one of the biggest finds in Scotland, had come from the
wreck of the yacht Ambrosia, which broke up after beaching on a
sandbank.
The call to reject the suicide theory was made by Mr John MacRitchie,
solicitor for Mr Locke's widow Claire, in his submission on the sixth
and final day of a fatal accident inquiry at Peterhead Sheriff Court.
Mr MacRitchie said: ''It is a most unlikely way of committing suicide.
It would be impossible to determine precisely what happened.''
He went on to criticise Customs and Excise, which was in overall
control of the recovery operation, for not checking that the company
which employed Mr Locke was capable of carrying out a dive from the
beach, rather than from a boat.
Also admitting he found it highly unlikely that Mr Locke committed
suicide, procurator-fiscal Ray Craig said he agreed with the theory put
forward earlier in the inquiry by Mr Michael Sisley, a commercial diver
of 30 years' experience now working for the Health and Safety Executive.
Mr Sisley had suggested the diver had got into difficulties, possibly
because his air supply had run out, had tried to pull himself ashore,
but had become snagged, cut himself free and was washed away by strong
undertows.
Mr Gordon McGregor, solicitor for J Allan Diving Services, which hired
Mr Locke, said: ''I would invite you to find there is no evidence that
anything that was done, or was not done, by the diving firm on the beach
that day, caused, or in any material way contributed to, Stewart's
death.''
Sheriff Keane said: ''I will obviously require to take this away and
give my determination at a later stage. I will do this as soon as
possible.''

<HEADLINE>Court ruling follows 'unfortunate' dispute by daughters over bequest of home. Judge sets aside death-bed will</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>BRUCE MCKAIN, LAW CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979501294</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WOMAN who signed a will on her death-bed, bequeathing her home to
one of her daughters, was not in a fit state to understand what she was
doing, a judge has decided.
In a case brought by another of the woman's daughters, Lord Johnston
decided that the will signed by 75-year-old Mrs Sarah Mauchan was not
valid.
In a written judgment in the case, the judge said it was
''unfortunate'' that the two sisters had ended up in court disputing
their mother's will.
Lord Johnston was told at the Court of Session that Mrs Mauchan's only
major asset was her home, a former council flat in Arran Place,
Clydebank, now worth about #28,000.
Mrs Mauchan, who had six children, suffered a number of medical
problems over the years, including cancer and a stroke, and was admitted
to Gartnavel General Hospital in Glasgow with acute septicaemia in
January 1992.
On the evening of January 16, she had an operation to drain an abcess
on her kidney, but died the following morning.
On the morning of January 16, Mrs Mauchan had been visited by her
solicitor and signed a will which appointed her daughter, Mrs Margaret
Robertson, 45, of Janetta Street, Clydebank, as her executrix and,
effectively, sole beneficiary.
Another daughter, Mrs Barbara Graham, of Durban Avenue, Clydebank,
argued that, because of her condition, her mother had not been capable
of making a valid will.
Lord Johnston said he had to decide whether Mrs Mauchan had the mental
capacity to understand the nature and effect of what she was signing.
Mrs Mauchan's solicitor, Mr Alexander Gilmore, gave evidence that, in
his opinion, the old lady had been more than capable of expressing her
true wishes when she instructed the original drafting of the will
towards the end of December 1991.
At the hospital in January, he asked a staff nurse whether it was
appropriate to see Mrs Mauchan to have the will signed, and was told
that it was. He informed her of the contents and asked her to read it,
which she did. She then signed it.
The lawyer's secretary, who was also at the bedside, said that, while
reading the will, the old lad's eyes became moist. According to Mrs
Robertson, that showed that her mother was well aware of nature and
content of the will.
However, the consultant physician in charge of Mrs Mauchan told the
court that, in his opinion, it was most unlikely that she had been
capable of exercising any form of conscious decision about how her
affairs should be managed.
If he had been consulted by the solicitor, he would have informed him
that, because of Mrs Mauchan's state of mind, it was not appropriate to
ask her to execute a will.
Mrs Robertson told Lord Johnston that, on January 16, her mother had
informed her that the lawyer had been to see her and that she had signed
the will.
The judge said: ''It may well be that the old lady knew that the
lawyer had been, and even might have said that she signed her will.
However, the question is whether she knew what was in it and its effect
and I have come to the conclusion that, on a balance of probabilities,
she did not.''
He ruled that Mrs Graham had established that her mother did not have
the necessary capacity to make a will and that it must be set aside.
Mrs Graham said after the decision: ''I have no regrets about taking
the case to court. I would do the same again because my mother always
made me promise that after she died, everything would be split six ways.
''I feel a great relief that it is all over. I feel I have got what my
mother wanted.''

THE Government last night backed down on plans to allow tax-breaks on
share options to part-time directors.
It was to have introduced legislation allowing part-time directors and
part-time employees to take part in tax-relieved financial participation
schemes, such as executive share options. This followed a European Court
ruling that part-timers should have the same rights as full-timers.
Treasury Financial Secretary Sir George Young said in a Commons
written reply that the Government had decided that the schemes would
apply only to part-time employees.
A Treasury spokesman said: ''There were representations from the City
that it might effect the impartial advice part-time directors were
called upon to give if they were allowed to participate in financial
participation schemes, including executive share options.''
Last night, Shadow Treasury Chief Secretary Andrew Smith said: ''The
Government appear now to be caving in to pressure from Labour on the
case of part-time directors, but we need to see the amendments they
propose.''
The Treasury denied the announcement had anything to do with the
reappearance of British Gas chief executive Cedric Brown before the
Employment Select Committee.

''IT WAS a bitter, bitter irony to me,'' said Glenda, ''that the first
woman Prime Minister had to be Margaret Thatcher.'' It also was, it
turned out, a bitter blow to the MP for Hampstead and Highgate, that in
parties where women do much of the work these women do not, more often
than not, choose a sister to be a candidate. Further, that in a world
where Glenda has never, she said, known a woman to shirk her
responsibilities, women, who make up more than half the electorate, more
often than not vote for men.
The free market system having, as it were, thrown up Margaret Thatcher
and lots of men, the answer must be to control the market and ensure
that it comes up with the right answer which, in this case, is that a
nation with 51% of its population female should require at least 50% of
its MPs to be similarly female.
Earlier, the Opposition spokesperson, Clare Short, drew back when
invited by Mr Raymond Robertson (Aberdeen South -- Con.) to extend this
principle of proportionality more widely. To insist that the due
percentage of visually impaired persons must be recruited as bus drivers
or of the manually challenged as surgeons could have dramatic electoral
consequences.
Politically incorrect Tories absented themselves from this Commons
debate on equality for women, sponsored by the Opposition, -- apart from
Michael Portillo who, doubtless, has the same scepticism about
legislating for equality as he harbours about the single European
currency.
He was able to palm off the job of speaking in the debate on to his
predecessor, David Hunt, who presides over the Cabinet committee which
discusses these issues although open government could not stretch far
enough, he said, for him to tell us what exactly they discussed or when
or how often.
Politicians frequently contradict themselves. Ms Short, who started by
asserting that a huge influx of women MPs would enormously improve the
quality of debate, went on to prove that this was not necessarily so.
Most of Mr Hunt's speech had been prepared by civil servants and
consisted of statistics showing that women are inching their way towards
equality and power at a rate that should bring us an all-women Cabinet
around 2200. He revealed the reactionary concealed behind the ostensibly
progressive facade -- he referred to a colleague as the ''co chair'' of
a committee -- by reporting the fact that 10% of top civil servants are
now women as though he thought this was a real achievement. The sisters
opposite snorted in derision.
The debate started with 47 MPs present (26 women and 21 men). The
women included the Speaker, Miss Betty Boothroyd, who was obliged to be
there. By the time Ms Short and Mr Hunt had done their stuff the number
had shrunk to 18 (10 women, nine men) including the Deputy Speaker, Mr
Geoff Lofthouse, who was obliged to be there, and hovered around that
figure for most of the rest of the day until near the time to vote.
This was better than the Press Gallery which after an hour could
not boast even 18 occupants.   The sole survivors were Hansard and the
Press Association, who were obliged to be there, a correspondent of the
Scotswoman, who finally cracked at 4.40pm and the Herald Sketch who left
with her temporarily.
The Sketch  returned for Glenda and was not sorry. The script was
not as good as when she was Elizabeth R but it was deeply felt and
interestingly delivered. If there was a way of rigging things so that we
could have another couple of Glendas and a new Margaret Thatcher in the
House, the Sketch would vote for it although it would worry at having
possibly eliminated a Benjamin Disraeli or a William Ewart Gladstone.

PARLIAMENTARY questions have been tabled over a breast cancer error
involving a Dundee woman which has resulted in the re-checking of
300,000 Scottish records.
A middle-aged woman, who was mistakenly sent an all-clear letter after
a screening over two years ago, only discovered late last year that she
had developed breast cancer.The Dundee centre admitted the mistake was
due to procedural error.
Now Scottish Labour Health spokesman John McAllion has tabled a number
of parliamentary questions to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang on the issue.
The Dundee MP is calling on Mr Lang to disclose what action was taken
to ensure that a report on NHS information and computer systems was
acted upon by NHS managers.
Mr McAllion wants to know what steps have been taken to ensure that
the National Breast Screening Service in Scotland carries out a regular
audit of the systems it uses for patient recall.
Mr McAllion said: ''It is vital we get to the bottom of this problem
to ensure there is never a repeat of the errors made, and to ensure new
systems are introduced across Scotland to eliminate human error. Any
delay or mistake in a recall system within the NHS could have the most
fatal consequences.''

their final budget meeting won't smell as sweet when the bills thud
through the letterboxes of 960,000 taxpayers.
Following dire warnings that Government funding cuts could mean 25%
tax increases, modified in recent days to 15%, the Labour administration
produced the ''pleasant surprise'' of a 13% increase.
In addition, the council's position has been eased by using #34.1m of
accumulated surpluses.
However, council leaders denied it was a ''rabbit out of the hat''
situation, and insisted that this worst budget so far would result in
1000 job losses and significant cuts in services.
Council tax on a Band D house (valued at #45,000 to #58,000) is
increased by 13.9% from #396 to #451 and the domestic water charge by 9%
from #80 to #87. This produces a combined council and water tax total of
#538 -- up #62 (13%) on last year.
The district council element, which varies across the region, must
then be added to produce the total tax liability. In Glasgow, for
example, a Band D taxpayer will pay a combined regional and district
charge of #763.
The most expensive tax area in Strathclyde is Strathkelvin, where Band
D taxpayers will have to find a combined total of #778, while Eastwood
is the lowest with #637.
More than 60,000 businesses across the region will pay a 5% increase
in non-domestic water rate, up from 3.7p to 3.9p. However, there is a 4%
cut in non-domestic sewerage rate, down from 5p to 4.8p.
In order to meet the Government's capping limit, the council would
have had to make cuts of #107m and create 5000 compulsory redundancies.
Instead, it has effected cuts of #73m while maintaining front-line
services.
Cuts include #12.6m in education, #4.6m in social work, #3.5m in
police, #5.6m in roads, pavements and lighting, and #6.4m in building
maintenance and improvements.
A 7.5% rise in Strathclyde rail fares, 20% in underground fares and an
increase in concessionary fares from 25p to 30p, will bring in almost
#4m.
With the budget still #34m above the capping limit, the council has
dealt with the shortfall by using the accounting device of funding
revenue expenditure from capital.
This move has still to be approved by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang.
Should he block it, then the council has threatened to challenge him by
seeking a judicial review in the Court of Session.
Finance chairman Councillor John Mullin complained: ''The whole
scenario is totally distasteful to our Labour administration. I hope the
general public realise that when their travel costs more, when they see
more potholes in the roads, uneven pavements and broken street lights,
when they see the state of school buildings deteriorating further, and
when police take longer to attend their burglary, it is the Conservative
Government which has inflicted this upon them.''
Liberal Democrat leader, Dr Christopher Mason, moving a 10.7%
increase, complained that the budget produced only 11% of the council's
resources. He wanted a return to the days of proper local accountability
when a council could could budget for half of its expenditure.
His alternative budget, along those of the SNP and the Conservatives
-- all recommending lower tax figures -- were defeated by a large
majority.

THE first of a new breed of North Sea platforms which could provide a
viable solution to marginal gas fields will sail out of the Moray Firth
tomorrow night.
The two, almost identical, single leg installations for the Davy and
Bessemer Fields, 60 miles off the Norfolk coast, epitomise the
cost-saving initiatives which the industry is trying to achieve. They
even use wind-generated electricity.
The Davy Field was discovered 25 years ago, but was regarded as
insufficiently attractive to develop until it was re-evaluated using the
new Amoss design -- Amoco Minimum Offshore Supporting Structure. It is
an adaptation of an approach already applied in the Gulf of Mexico.
Now the twin Davy and Bessemer developments have attracted #84m of
investment from Amoco and its partners.
The design of the platforms has been crucial to the success of the
plan and has attracted interest from other operators.
The platforms will be able to be used at other locations after their
estimated seven or eight years in their first fields.
They were constructed at the Brown &amp; Root McDermott Fabricators yard
at Nigg. Amoco hopes to place orders for three new fields later this
year if it decides they are viable.
Amoco said its calculations show ''mass production'' of such platforms
would mean if it builds four, the last one would effectively be free.
Lightweight materials and simplified deck facilities mean the
platforms are assembled and ready to sail as fully integrated
structures.
The new platforms feature the first use of wind-driven turbines for
power generation in the UK North Sea and two 15ft diameter blades at the
northern corners of each platform will generate enough electricity to
operate the platforms, which are not normally manned.

A CALL for the retention of the not proven verdict will be made this
week to the Scottish Labour Party conference.
It comes from the Muir Society, an organisation of radical and Labour
lawyers in Scotland whose honorary president is Mr Andrew Hardie, Dean
of the Faculty of Advocates.
The society's resolution to the conference at Inverness maintains that
the case for the abolition of not proven has not been made out, and that
there is no evidence that juries do not understand its meaning and
effect.
It also says that the verdict makes logical and legal sense and its
continued use reflects public opinion.
A little more than a week ago the verdict prompted a clash between the
Scottish Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, and his Labour shadow, Mr George
Robertson, in a Commons debate on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.
Mr Lang said Scotland's three-verdict system had been reviewed very
thoroughly and there had been wide consultations.
He said the responses made it clear this system continued to be valued
in Scotland and, although there were strong views on both sides, there
was considerably more support for the retention of not proven than for
its abolition.
Mr Robertson, who has committed himself personally to the campaign for
abolition because of a constituency case, told the debate it was a ''bad
and unnecessary'' verdict which should be ''consigned to the dustbin of
history''.

LABOUR MP Tam Dalyell tabled more questions on the Lockerbie bombing
last night, as relatives of the 270 victims of the disaster condemned
the Government for ''stonewalling'' on the case.
Representatives of the families of those who died in the 1988
terrorist attack met Mr Dalyell at the Commons last night to discuss the
answers to more than 90 written questions tabled by the MP.
The questions, part of the Linlithgow MP's continuing campaign to
persuade the Government to reopen the case, dealt with what he calls
unanswered questions surrounding the events leading up to and following
the bombing in December 1988.
Ms Pamela Dix, whose brother died in the bombing, said: ''A lot of the
answers are dismissive, and claim everything is sub-judice. That's a
disappointment. It's an easy way out.''
As an example, she pointed to one of the answers in which Home
Secretary Michael Howard confirmed that he approved a speech by MI5
director general Stella Rimington in which she claimed MI5 had assisted
in tracking down the two Libyans wanted for the bombing.
''Is it acceptable that she should be authorised to make public
statements linking Libya to Lockerbie when at every turn we are told no
public statements that would prejudice the case in any way are
possible?'' she said.
Dr Jim Swire, spokesman for the British families, said: ''Up until now
we have been powerless to penetrate the armour which the establishment
in this country, in Germany and the United States have placed around
what happened before Lockerbie and particularly warnings they
received.''
The families claimed intelligence services in all three countries were
warned in advance by Israeli intelligence that an American airliner
would be bombed, and that the information should have been passed on to
those preparing to board the flight.

Trade union representatives yesterday presented a petition containing
more than 2000 council staff signatures to Lothian region convener Eric
Milligan at the start of the region's budget meeting.
Despite hearing deputations from the public services trade union
Unison and the Federation of Community Councils about cuts in jobs and
services, the council agreed Labour's proposals to freeze regional
council tax levels for 1995-96, but reduce direct spending on services
by #20m.
Regional water charges will rise by an average of #14.
Mr John Stevenson, secretary of Lothian Region's branch of Unison
claimed the Government was trying to hide the real cost of
reorganisation by forcing councils to cut jobs and service to the bone.
He said the union believed that up to 1000 council jobs could be at
risk, on top of those already lost through this budget,
The Labour budget includes a freeze on recruitment, a #7m package of
education cuts including a reduction of 120 teaching jobs and rise in
payments for school meals and evening classes.
The council's central support services will be cut by more than 7%.
Labour councillors placed the spending reductions firmly at the door
of Mr Lang, and poured scorn on the local Conservatives' plan to cut
council tax levels.
Convener Milligan claimed council spending levels were largely
controlled by Mr Lang, and Edinburgh was badly treated in relation to
other Scottish cities with regard to Government cash support per head.
Finance chairman Brian Weddell told the meeting that the budget set
was within Government capping levels. He said the Labour administration
had nevertheless retained their key policy objectives.
There would be no compulsory redundancies. The concessionary fares
scheme would continue along with nursery provision for every
four-year-old.
The Conservatives proposed a budget with an average council tax of #90
less than Labour. It included ending built-in increases for inflation
and cutting back on grants to voluntary organisations.
Conservative councillors said the huge spending by local government
could not be insulated from what was happening in the general economy,
and they claimed Labour's budget would have been very different if the
local elections had not been so close.
The Scottish Liberal Democrat and the SNP groups proposed the same
council tax level as Labour but with different savings and spending
priorities.
Meanwhile both East Lothian and Midlothian District Councils confirmed
a council tax freeze for next year.
* Central Region yesterday announced it would not be increasing its
council tax for 1995/96, and would be cutting water bills by #1.
Councillors approved cuts of #11.3m, which will affect schools and the
social work service, as well as reducing funding for Central Scotland
Police by nearly #500,000.
Council leader Corrie McChord said the cuts could not have been
avoided, even by raising the council tax, because of ''savage'' capping
limits imposed by the Scottish Secretary.
* The council tax for the Western Isles was yesterday fixed at #524,
an average increase of 8%, while the islands water rate was reduced by
#8. Council leaders said the combined figure would represent a rise of
less than #1 a week for more than 80% of households.

THE total legal aid bill in the Ayrshire child abuse case could be as
much as #2m, Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said
yesterday in a Commons written answer.
He said six legal aid certificates had been granted and payments to
date amounted to #538,000.
Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, criticised the payments of
large fees to top lawyers. He said: ''While I recognise the rights of
the parents in the case, and others, to be properly represented, the
estimated cost is a huge burden on the taxpayer which could and should
be avoided.
''The Secretary of State should urgently examine ways in which these
cases can be resolved without the open ended commitment of legal aid for
expensive advocates and over legalistic procedures which result.''
A BID to speed up the process under which a ''safeguarder'' is
appointed to look after the interests of a child in proceedings at a
hearing or before a sheriff was rejected by the Government yesterday.
The SNP's parliamentary leader, Mrs Margaret Ewing, with support from
several other Opposition MPs, argued that a child should be given a
safeguarder as a soon as a Child Protection Order was imposed.
Mrs Ewing told a Scottish committee considering the Children
(Scotland) Bill that there was deep concern over the delay in
appointment of safeguarders in a situation in which a child was likely
to be at his or her most confused and vulnerable.
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said a Children's
Hearing would consider the appointment of a safeguarder on the second
working day after the imposition of a CPO. There simply was not time to
do what Mrs Ewing and others were demanding in a situation where
emergency procedures were being used.

<HEADLINE>MPs told of backing for disclosures on executive pay. Gas chief says he didn't mean to mislead</HEADLINE>

THE chief executive of British Gas -- forced to to return before a
Commons committee yesterday -- denied that he had intentionally misled
MPs over a long-term bonus scheme under which he could receive a 125%
increase in his salary.
Mr Cedric Brown was asked to explain why he failed to tell MPs about
the bonus scheme and a secret share option package when he appeared
before the Employment Select Committee six weeks ago.
The committee, which is investigating pay deals for executives of
privatised utilities, issued a recall for Mr Brown after MPs expressed
concerns that they had not been given the full details of his salary and
other benefits.
Mr Brown -- with British Gas chairman Richard Giordano -- faced nearly
two hours of questioning. None of the MPs on the committee managed to
score points off the two, who insisted they supported ''full
transparency'' on directors' pay.
Mr Giordano told the committee he was prepared to support legislation
to force full disclosure of executive pay, but only if the information
could not be obtained through current stock exchange rules.
Agreeing there was a ''problem'' with disclosure in annual reports, he
added: ''I think it can be acconmplished through stock exchange rules.
If it can't be achieved through that, I support legislation.''
Last week, the Prime Minister agreed that the public found the pay
increases awarded to directors of privatised untilities on the back of
large profits ''distasteful''.
In his evidence to the committee in January, Mr Brown confirmed that
he receives a basic salary of #450,000, but failed to mention a new
long-term bonus scheme worth potentially an additional #500,000, and
268,211 share options.
Labour committee chairman Greville Janner said to Mr Brown: ''What you
told us was the truth, but not the whole truth. We would not have had to
have you back if you had told us everything.''
In his previous appearance before the committee, Mr Brown admitted
that the announcement of his pay increase last November, which took his
basic salary to #450,000 a year, could have been handled better.
Yesterday he conceded it had been ''the straw that broke the camel's
back'' and set off the debate over executive pay increases. ''We were
the catalyst that suddenly set the thing alight and the whole thing took
off from there. It has become focused since then very much on British
Gas and very much on myself,'' he said.
Mr Brown insisted that his written submission to the committee in
January had made clear his readiness to answer any other questions MPs
might have. ''I would like to make it absolutely clear that there was
never any intention to mislead the committee. I believe and I'm aware
that other people believe that all relevant information was contained in
that submission,'' he said.
Mr Ernie Ross (Dundee West -- Lab.) conceded that perhaps the
committee should have taken up details of documents Mr Brown had
supplied to it: ''But you didn't really bring to the attention of the
committee the long -term bonus scheme.
''Don't you think that was a little unfair to the committee?''
Mr Brown replied: ''No, I don't. The written evidence which I put
before the committee in mid-January was very clear about all the changes
that were being made in the package.''
Mr Giordano said that, although he considered himself too old to be
considered, he would expect to be paid two or three times his current
salary to become chairman of a comparable company in the United States.
Mr Giordano is American.
In addition to being chairman of British Gas -- to which he dedicates
three-quarters of his time -- he is also deputy chairman of Grand Met,
for which he receives about #85,000 a year, non-executive director of
RTZ mining group, worth about #30,000 a year, and chairman of BOC, at
#180,000 a year..
He told Tory MP Tim Yeo he was ''depressed'' that so much public and
political attention was being concentrated on executive pay.
''We are spending an enormous amount of energy fighting off confusion
and misinformation. Perhaps we started the ball rolling by not
adequately giving out information. We want to get back to running the
business.''

THE local enterprise company in Dunbartonshire is poised to buy out a
private housing-led development on the banks of Loch Lomond, at Balloch,
three months after the Scottish Secretary gave the controversial scheme
planning permission.
Mr Ian Lang's decision came after permission was twice refused by the
local council and after a public inquiry at which many local amenity
groups expressed outright opposition.
Mr Lang effectively ignored the advice of his own inquiry reporter in
giving the scheme approval with only minor conditions.
Now Dunbartonshire Enterprise is negotiating to buy the 76-acre site
from Drumkinnon Development Company before a brick has been laid.
Drumkinnon is a joint venture between Cala Homes and Dixon Commercial
Property, chaired by former Lord Provost of Glasgow Mr Michael Kelly.
The near #3m acquisition deal has been approved in principle by the
Scottish Enterprise main board and could be concluded within a week. DE
wants to combine the site with the 20-acre West Riverside site next
door, currently owned by Scottish Enterprise, for a tourism-led
development.
Last night local MP John McFall, a Labour front-bench spokesman,
welcomed the local enterprise company's intervention but said he would
be asking Mr Lang questions about the profit Drumkinnon stands to make
from selling land that now has planning permission for housing.
''We have a crazy situation where developers can submit elaborate
schemes, including plans for substantial housing development, then scrap
them once planning permission has been granted'' he said.
''They are then free to sell that land at a price which reflects that
planning permission. The fact that public money is now to be used to
rescue a potential disaster for Loch Lomond compels me to ask Mr Lang:
Why doesn't he require developers to produce business plans for projects
in sensitive areas, and what has he cost the public purse by his delays
in this case?''
Sources close to the negotiations insisted to The Herald that, even if
a near #3m price is paid by DE, Drumkinnon will be hard pushed to recoup
the costs of assembling the site -- much of it the site of a former dye
works -- and of a five-year fight for planning permission.
It does, however, seem possible that Cala will emerge from the
negotiations with an option to build some houses on part of the combined
site well away from the loch, to help finance the leisure-based
development on the rest of the land. The number of houses will be no
more than a quarter of the 287 originally planned by Drumkinnon.
Both sides were reluctant to talk publicly about the deal. For
Drumkinnon, Mr Kelly would only say: ''I can confirm that negotiations
are currently taking place and that one of the options is that
Dunbartonshire Enterprise purchase our scheme outright. The negotiations
have not been concluded.''
DE chief executive Donald MacInnes: ''We are in negotiations and if we
develop this site along with the adjacent site already in Scottish
Enterprise ownership on a tourism-led basis, it's a wonderful
opportunity to do something on Loch Lomond to be proud of, which will
last a generation.''

<HEADLINE>Doctors sound warning on split over GP fundholding</HEADLINE>

A MAJOR rift opened up yesterday between the Government and family
doctors in Scotland over the issue of GP fundholding.
Details of a three-year study of fundholding practices in the
North-east, commissioned by the Scottish Office, were revealed at a
conference in Edinburgh. The study advocated looking at the benefits of
giving the same managerial and computer resources to non-fundholders.
However, Mr Geoff Scaife, chief executive of the Scottish NHS, told
the conference that GP fundholding was the only way forward for
devolving real power to family doctors and their patients.
He was dismissive of alternatives, including locality purchasing
favoured by the BMA, in which all GPs in an area get together to buy
hospital and community services to serve the needs of the population as
a whole.
Mr Scaife said this might be useful as a planning model but not for
purchasing. ''I do worry when I see people pouring lots of cash into
locality planning and calling it locality purchasing. This is not an
alternative to GP purchasing,'' he said.
Dr John Garner, chairman of the BMA's Scottish general medical
services committee, said Mr Scaife's comments would cause deep
resentment.
''For the chief executive to rubbish locality purchasing is very
unhelpful indeed,'' he said.
''I think he is having to drive a hard political line, and many GPs
throughout Scotland will see that as a very negative attitude. This is
very damaging and it is going to cause problems.''
Earlier Dr Angela Coulter, director of the King's Fund research centre
in London, said it was too early to judge fundholding in England. It had
opened up many positive features but it also carried grave risks,
including development of a two-tier service.
''We have seen that fundholders have been able to get their patients
into hospital much more quickly than non-fundholders, particularly
towards the end of the financial year,'' she said.
Dr Coulter said fundholding had been popular in affluent middle-class
areas but not in deprived inner-city practices. ''The danger of this
scheme is that it will exacerbate existing inequalities,'' she said.
Fundholding has had only a limited impact in Scotland in the last four
years, despite repeated Government incentives, including reducing the
standard list size from 11,000 to 4000 and offering a bridging scheme.
At present about one million patients, 20% of the total, are with
fundholders. The Scottish Office expects the bridging scheme (PCPI),
offering limited fundholding powers, to increase this figure to 30 or
40% by April next year. Some 78 practices with 360,000 patients will be
able to claim up to #15,000 each for costs incurred during a pilot
programme to get it running.
In addition, six practices in Scotland are being selected to run a
third fundholding system, giving GPs total control over health budgets.
The North-east study, which examined six fundholding practices in
Grampian and Tayside, found reduced volume of drug prescribing but more
services provided in the practice rather than hospital. Investment had
produced improvements in practice management and efficiency, but there
was a general problem in the mechanism of allocating funds to different
practices.
''Sometime in the near future, it will have to be asked whether equal
infrastructure funding in non-fundholding practices might achieve
parallel benefits without some of the administrative disbenefits we have
suggested may exist in relation to fundholding,'' it said.
Banchory GP Dr Martin McCrone said the new system had brought
considerable benefits in focusing services on the needs of patients. It
had also proved a catalyst for improving hospital radiology and
laboratory services for everyone.

A RARE Scottish cheese was granted a reprieve yesterday when a Lanark
cheese-maker won a court order preventing health officers from
bulldozing #27,000 worth of his exclusive produce into the ground.
Mr Humphrey Errington's business, which employs seven in Carnwath, may
also have been rescued by the court order which leaves 528 kilos of
Lanark Blue free to ripen another day, or at least until further legal
proceedings.
The cheese had been set for burial today, but Lord Abernethy's
decision, in the Court of Session, to grant an interim interdict saving
the cheese, pending a judicial review, won a reprieve for the
financially hard-pressed farmer.
Mr Errington had applied for a judicial review following a decision by
Justice of the Peace Mrs Elizabeth Wilson, that the cheese was unfit for
human consumption.
In his petition to the court Mr Errington told the judge that on March
3 Mrs Wilson issued a decision under the Food Safety Act 1990 that 44
batches of Lanark Blue failed to comply with food safety requirements.
She ordered that the blue-veined semi-hard cheese be destroyed and
that Mr Errington should meet the destruction costs.
This followed the issue of ''detention notices'' by Clydesdale
District Council over 50 batches of Mr Errington's Lanark Blue, ordering
him not to use the cheese for human consumption or remove them.
Six of the cheeses were found to contain the listeria bacteria (which
can cause listeriosis) at levels of less than 1000 per gram and they
were cleared. But the district council asked the JP to condemn the rest
and order their destruction.
Mr Errington argued that 63,000 portions of Lanark Blue, which
contained listeria at the levels complained of by the district council,
had been sold without one case of listeriosis being reported.
He says that listeria is commonly present in blue-veined, semi-hard
cheese.
Lord Abernethy said he was satisfied that Mr Errington had made out an
arguable case and granted the interdict, pending the full hearing of his
application for a judicial review.
The cheese-maker, who started yesterday in despondency, found his
spirits lifted by the order and support from people in the soft cheese
industry, he said.
''I was at a really low ebb till I got up in the morning and saw the
messages, and offers of cash help, from people outraged at my
predicament.''
''It's made me all the more determined to fight on, even though the
kitty's empty because of the #27,000 I lost in sales and the
compensation paid to retailers.''
Mr Errington plans to launch a fighting fund to continue his legal
battle, which has cost him #8000 so far.
Mr John Curtis, chairman of the Specialist Cheesemakers' Association,
yesterday said they would be backing Mr Errington in his efforts to save
the cheese, which retails at between #5 and #6 a pound.
Mr Curtis said: ''Nobody has fallen ill as a result of eating his
cheese. The standards set are too stringent and need to be relaxed, and
this sort of confrontation has to be avoided in the future.''
Delicatessen owner Mr Donald McNeil, of Bearsden, said that a number
of customers had been angered by their inability to provide Lanark Blue,
which can take between four and five months to ripen according to taste.
Mr Duncan Reeves, who owns the Olive Tree delicatessen in Peebles,
added: ''In these soft cheeses, it's the cultures that make them taste
so good. If the micro-biologists get their way we'll end up with
hundreds of small food manufacturers out of business and boring bland
food.''
The cheese, which is sold at Harrods, is currently being stored under
lock and key at Mr Errington's Ogscastle farm. A quantity will have to

<HEADLINE>Bottom line at Barclays: profit of #1.86 billion; chief executive paid #1m; and staff get #6. Strike ballot over 'mean' pay offer</HEADLINE>

BARCLAYS' chairman Andrew Buxton yesterday defended his bank's profits
of #1.86 billion last year, which the unions expect will put the bank's
chief executive on more than #1m a year, and denounced bank staff for
threatening industrial action over a ''generous'' offer of #6.08 a week.
But his words were met with anger by thousands of bank employees who
are to be balloted over strike action after having a below inflation
increase imposed on them for the fourth year running.
Union leaders said the staff would feel ''devastated'' at the level of
profits -- announced days after Barclays imposed 2.75% wage rise on its
50,000 employees.
The Barclays Group Staff Union is to ballot its 32,000 members after
rejecting the pay offer. The union, which represents two-thirds of
Barclays' workforce, wants a 5% across-the-board pay increase.
Mr Buxton, pressed on why the union was balloting its staff about
strike action, said: ''Because the union doesn't consider that 2.75%
across the board, in addition to profit sharing, is enough. I think it
is.'' In addition to the 2.75%, staff were getting a 7.5% salary bonus
out of profit-sharing ''so they are sharing in the success''.
Barclays claimed that with performance-related increases the average
staff member would receive 5% -- ''well ahead of the current rate of
inflation''.
The unions dispute these figures and maintain that at least 13,000
staff will receive only the 2.75% plus the one-off average #860 profit
sharing bonus payment.
BGSU general secretary Paul Snowball commented: ''I am sure our
members will be delighted to see the bank doing so well. But what they
will be devastated about is how they are being rewarded for contributing
to that success. A pay rise of 2.75% now looks pretty mean compared to
today's profits.''
The Banking, Insurance, and Finance Union, which has 8000 members at
Barclays, also attacked the bank over pay. Assistant secretary Mr Rob
MacGregor said staff would be ''extremely annoyed'' at the level of
profits compared to the rise imposed on them which he estimated would be
worth #6.08 a week to the average cashier on #11,500 a year.
''The #1.86 billion is below expectations but is still three times
higher than the previous year and is a dramatic figure,'' he said. It
came ''on the back of 18,000 job losses over the past three years and
four years of below inflation pay rises''.
The unions were waiting with interest for details of any bonus
payments to Mr Buxton, whose salary is #465,000, and chief executive
Martin Taylor, who is paid #737,000 and whose total remuneration is
expected to top #1m.
Shadow employment minister Ian McCartney said the profits came against
a background of large-scale job losses and branch closures throughout
the banking industry.
''These results continue the trend of big profits and directors'
pay-outs being paid for by big staff lay-offs. It's jam, jam, and jam
all the way for the bank godfathers and dole, dole, dole every day for
more bank workers.''
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown called for new legislation to give bank
customers more rights. These would include the right to know in advance
what charges were being imposed by their bank, the right to a proper
breakdown of charges, and a greater right of redress through a statutory
ombudsman when things went wrong.
''The real concern about the profit level of Barclays is whether the
customer at Barclays and other banks is getting the best deal,'' he told
a news conference at Westminster.

DISABLED pupils suffer discrimination because schools are not meeting
their needs, the Educational Institute of Scotland says.
In a policy paper, the EIS says it is a fundamental principle that
disabled pupils should, as far as possible, attend the school they would
have gone to if they were not disabled.
The teachers' union has put forward proposals for ensuring that pupils
in wheelchairs, those with sensory impairments such as hearing and
seeing problems, and those with other physical conditions have equal
access to the curriculum.
The paper says there should be special arrangements for exam
candidates with physical problems, such as a heart condition, who may
need extra time to complete papers.
EIS deputy general secretary Mr Fred Forrester said all important
bodies in Scottish education were now committed to ending discrimination
from sex or ethnic origin.
However, he added: ''Discrimination against disabled children
continues, not from any consideration of principle but for reasons to do
with the design of school buildings or the absence in schools of readily
available new technologies.''
* Scottish businesses were told yesterday that they are leading the
way in providing employment opportunities for disabled people.
Mr Alan Malcolm, chairman of the Committee For The Employment of
People With Disabilities, told a reception in Glasgow, attended by 150
local employers, that about 20% of UK Positive About Disabled People
users are Scottish businesses.

AN off-duty policeman who punched a teenager who threatened to throw
his baby out of a train window was fined #150 by magistrates in
Southend, Essex, yesterday.
Constable Richard King, 30, a member of the City of London tactical
firearms unit, had told the court he was holding his nine-week-old
daughter Jessica when he heard another passenger on the train say he
would like to throw her out of the window.
The policeman, of Perry Road, South Benfleet, Essex, said: ''I
couldn't believe what I heard. I looked round at my son, six, who was
petrified, and my wife. I was not going to wait to see if he carried out
the threat.''
He had denied common assault on Mr David Hobbs in June last year, and
will now have to wait to see whether he will face a force disciplinary
hearing.
Constable King, who had been to the Southend Air Show with his family,
told the court he lunged forward with the baby in his arms to hit the
youth after the remark.
He then stood up, realised that he was one of a group of six, handed
the baby to his wife, arrested him and ordered him from the train, which
was stationary at Southend Central Station.
Mr Hobbs, of Glenriddings, South Benfleet, now 19, told the court that
a friend Emma Wells, 17, had remarked on the train that the Kings' baby
was lovely and she would like to hold it.
Mr Hobbs said he turned to another friend and said I'd like to throw
it out of the window: ''Suddenly the man was in front of me and hit me.
I didn't really know what was going on.''
He admitted he had received a letter from BT Police warning him about
using behaviour liable to cause a breach of the peace. The case was
referred by them to the Complaints and Discipline section of the City of
London Force and an investigation carried out before Constable King was
summoned for assault.

ABOUT 250 women and children took to the streets of one of Glasgow's
post-war housing schemes last night to highlight their fears about
safety. It was the first time for weeks that many had dared to cross
their doors after dark.
The ''Reclaim the Night'' candle and torchlit procession, organised by
a local women's forum in Drumchapel on the eve of International Women's
Day, took on a new meaning with fears heightened in recent weeks by four
night-time attacks on women in the area.
Many of the marchers carried placards and chanted ''What do we want?
Safe streets,'' during the two-mile walk which crossed the paths where
the attacks took place.
Strathclyde police have increased patrols in Drumchapel in the past
month after three women and a 13-year-old girl were attacked by two men
within a one square mile area in the Langfaulds district. No arrests
have been made.
The attacks followed persistent claims by women that paths throughout
the scheme are badly lit and not safe for women to walk along at night.
Ms Loraine Houston, a single mother, who helped to organise last
night's event, said it had been held to highlight the fears of women in
the area. The mother of four children, aged from five to 12, said:
''This is the first time for months that some women have left their
homes after dark.''
She said fears had been apparent long before the attacks started, and
added: ''They have only served to add to the problems.''
Mrs Maureen Guthrie, 71, of the Pinewood Residents' Association, said:
''I never go out at night unless I have transport.'' She added that some
of the access from houses was along pathways which had never been lit.
She also claimed that authorities were often slow to repair faulty
street lights.
Inspector Alex McSorley, of Strathclyde police, who is based at
Drumchapel, said he welcomed any move which would help increase the
awareness of personal safety.
He was hopeful that the procession might spur someone to telephone a
confidential police hotline which had been set up in an attempt to trap
the attackers. The number is 0141 951 2299.
Mr McSorley confirmed that police patrols in the area had been stepped
up since the attacks, which occurred during a 12-day period last month.
They all took place between 9.15pm and 1.30am.

A FORMER Scottish Episcopal Bishop said last night he was homosexual.
Mr Derek Rawcliffe, Bishop of Glasgow and Galloway from 1981 to 1991,
was said to be the highest member of his church to ''come out''.
He also told BBC 2's Newsnight programme that he was in favour of
blessings for the relationships of gay priests.
His disclosure comes a day after Cardinal Basil Hume, the leader of
Britain's Roman Catholics, affirmed the dignity of homosexuals and
condemned discrimination against them.
The bishop said he came to realise that it was all right to accept
one's gayness when he worked in the Pacific.
''It was when a young man there, I was over 50, approached me, and I
realised that I loved him very much, but I thought, this is wrong, and I
was in a real turmoil.
''So I went to see my confessor about it, told him what had happened,
and he said, 'Oh good, now you will have someone to love.' ''
Towards the end of his time in the Pacific he got married and thought
he was no longer gay. But he realised after his wife died, and about the
time when he retired, ''that in fact I was still gay, always had been''.

<HEADLINE>Wide support from male and female party members for move, says official. All-women Ayr shortleet 'not imposed'</HEADLINE>

LABOUR Party officials in Ayr strongly denied yesterday that Labour's
London headquarters had forced them into deciding that their candidate
at the next General Election would be a woman.
Ms Linda Aird, constituency secretary, said that their decision to
become the first constituency in Scotland to have an all-women shortleet
had substantial support from both male and female party members. It had
been openly discussed locally for the past two years to ensure that
there was widespread support.
It is known that Mr Jack McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish
Labour Party, had been coming under increasing pressure from London
headquarters to have enough constituencies in place in Scotland with
all-women shortleets.
However, Ms Aird said that Mr McConnell had discussed the subject with
her only once. There was no pressure, she said, nor was the party
locally being told who the woman candidate should be, which was one of
the fears of local members.
She would be chosen from a shortleet by all members of the party in
Ayr. There were no favourites and no one was being imposed upon them,
she insisted.
The all-woman shortleet in Ayr is due to Labour's decision that half
of all the winnable, vacant seats should have women candidates to help
boost the small number of women MPs so that the party is more
representative.
In Scotland, that will probably mean six seats, and therefore three
women candidates. That could mean the female representation in
Parliament for Labour in Scotland at best rising from four to seven --
hardly an earth-shattering increase, say supporters of the proposal.
Explaining the decision yesterday, Ms Aird, who works as a researcher
for Euro MP Alex Smith, said: ''We believe we can present this decision
in a positive manner. It is denigrating to women to say a man is always
better. Because we are among the first, we will attract a great deal of
interest and will be able to pick a first-rate candidate.''
Asked why they should deny the people of Ayr the chance to elect a
gifted and talented man, she said: ''There will be lots of gifted and
talented men standing for Parliament. It's just that this way, we will
have some gifted and talented women as well.''
She pointed out that the decision would excite a great deal of
interest from women throughout the party. Ayr should end up with a very
strong candidate as she will have fought through from a very strong
list.
But will a woman be a vote loser?
''Statistics show that women candidates achieve a marginally better
swing to Labour,'' said Ms Aird.
Male Labour supporters locally have expressed their support for the
decision, including constituency chairperson Douglas Campbell, who came
close to being Labour's candidate at the last election.
He said it was important that there were more women in Parliament. He
was convinced they would have a very strong candidate, and that he would
fulfil his own personal political ambitions by standing as a candidate
in next month's council elections.
Mr Ian Welsh, Labour leader on Kyle and Carrick District Council who
was strongly tipped to be the candidate, also praised the decision
yesterday, saying he was extremely glad to see the party addressing
under-representation of women. As to his own future, he said he would
like to put himself forward as a candidate for a future Scottish
Parliament.
The only person making waves publicly about the decision was the
sitting Tory MP, Mr Phil Gallie, who has to defend a very slim majority
at the next election. He described it as a huge insult not only to the
people of Ayr, but also to some ''excellent local Labour councillors''.
Ms Aird said: ''If it's irking Phil, it must be right.''
She also thanked him for pointing out that Labour had some excellent
candidates at the local council elections next month, and hoped that the
voters were taking note.
As for when the woman candidate will be chosen, that will be left
until after the council elections. Each of the five branches in the
constituency, as well as affiliated unions and organisations, will be
able to nominate a woman.
A shortleet will be drawn up from the nominations and the 300 or so
party members will then have a free vote.

FIVE climbers were missing last night, two of them almost certainly
dead, as Scotland's mountains continued to extract a tragic winter toll.
A search for two men missing since Saturday in the Cairngorms, in
blizzards so bad that a helicopter could not be used, will resume today
in scaled-down form.
Mr Graeme Holland and Mr Alan Mitchell, both 22, from Keswick,
Cumbria, disappeared on Saturday in part of the Cairngorms badly hit by
avalanches. They had not left details of their planned route.
As the hunt was called off last night, the policeman in charge,
Inspector Colin Mackintosh, based at Aviemore said: ''There is always
hope, but it is looking very grim. We have covered every possible area
where they could be and found absolutely nothing. We have drawn a
complete blank.''
He added: ''We are all pretty deflated. We thought we would find them
today. The rescuers are exhausted and have been exposed to considerable
danger themselves with the high avalanche risk.
''I just hope everyone learns a lesson from this that details of
routes should always be left. But if they are buried under an avalanche,
it is unlikely that would have helped.''
As the Cairngorm search was being scaled down, a fresh hunt was being
launched in blizzards blown by 50mph winds for three men missing on
Buachaille Etive Mhor, in Glencoe, where the bodies of three more
climbers killed last month have yet to be found.
Yesterday's search was mounted after workmates of three more men
reported they not returned to work after a weekend climbing in the area.
Police did not disclose their identities or home areas. The search will
resume today.
A mountain search which began yesterday for a solo climber who set out
to climb a peak near Bridge of Orchy on Saturday and left a note in his
car saying he intended remaining out for three days was later called off
when he returned to his car safe and well.
Rescue teams launched the search around Beinn Achalladar, but Mr James
Petrie, 32, of Eastwood, Shawlands, Glasgow, returned to his vehicle at
lunchtime.
A police spokesman said it appeared that Mr Petrie had been forced to
dig a shelter for himself until he was able to make his way down the
mountain.
The spokesman added that Mr Petrie was an experienced alpine climber
and appeared to be in good health after his ordeal.

THE Government's electricity sell-off was in turmoil last night as
outraged investors were warned there are to be tough new controls on
power prices.
The industry's regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, astonished
the markets by issuing this warning only a day after Treasury Ministers
had launched the latest disposal of shares in the privatised industry.
The Government was accused of incompetence or connivance by Opposition
parties as #3000m was wiped off the electricity industry shares.
Today, however, the shares may revive when the market discovers that a
#1200m bid for Northern Electric is set to go ahead, despite the
eleventh hour intervention of Professor Littlechild, the independent
regulator who is charged with the duty of looking after consumers.
Even Scotland, which does not fall under his regulation, felt the blow
yesterday as share prices tumbled.
Shadow Trade Minister Jack Cunningham said: ''The Government has
conned share buyers in PowerGen and National Power. They must have been
aware of what was going on in the Office of Electricity Regulation
(Offer), yet went ahead with their sale.''
The Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, Mr Nick Harvey,
suggested the timing of the regulator's announcement was more than a
little bizarre, and addded that ''If the Government knew of his
intentions, questions must be asked as to whether investors have been
seriously duped and sold shares on a false prospectus.''
Mr Tim Eggar, the Minister in charge, said the Government had no
knowledge of the regulator's decision to intervene on behalf of
consumers to force electricity prices down. And Professor Littlechild
said on BBC radio: ''My decision was not made until yesterday. The
Government could not have known what it was to be.''
Consumer groups were delighted when Offer told privatised power firms
to expect another price clamp next year. But there was outrage in the
City because it came only 24 hours after the latest sell-off of shares
in generators PowerGen and National Power.
The sale on Monday attracted two million applications and raised
around #4000m, but it would have been a flop if investors had got wind
of the planned new price controls.
The news sent share prices in the 12 English and Welsh regional
electricity companies tumbling by up to 183p a share, wiping millions of
pounds off the industry's value. The new partly-paid National Power and
PowerGen shares fell by 10p and 9p respectively.
Mr Major insisted that the possibility of new price controls showed
the Government's regulatory system was working effectively. He rejected
a call by Labour leader Tony Blair for an overhaul of the regulatory
price system for all the utilities, including gas and water.
The watchdog's move, was a direct response to ''widespread public
concern'' about existing controls.
Professor Littlechild also hinted that one of the companies, Northern
Electric, might have deliberately played down its financial strength
when he drew up price cuts already due this year.
Northern Electric recently offered shareholders a very generous deal
designed to thwart a buy out bid by construction giants Trafalgar House.
Professor Littlechild said yesterday: ''As to whether that was
concealed from me or whether that is something they have been forced to
explore further that they weren't then aware of, I don't know. I am not
in a position to say they misled me and I am not alleging that.''
With the latest developments, Northern Electric has ''reluctantly''
decided to recommend to its shareholders that they accept the offer from
Trafalgar House.
The company had been holding out against the #11 per share offer which
closes on Friday, but the sudden collapse in the shares of the
electricity distributors cut the ground from beneath the company's feet.
Northern shares plummeted 158p to 905p on the fear that Trafalgar
would withdraw its offer. However, the bid is set to go ahead.
Northern's radical defence was a plan to hand back #627m to
shareholders. Its ability to do this, and the price Trafalgar was
prepared to put on the company, triggered Professor Littlechild's
decision to review electricity prices as they suggested the present
pricing regime was too lax.
Professor Littlechild had already imposed price cuts of between 11%
and 17% from April this year. But these failed to impress consumer
groups and opposition MPs who pointed to soaring profits and executive
pay rises within the firms.
Consumer groups produced a report saying customers had paid #650m over
the odds since privatisation in 1990 and Opposition MPs claimed the
formula set by the Government at the time of privatisation enabled the
12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales to increase
prices when costs were falling.
They say that as a result profits have rocketed, dividends doubled and
chairmen's salaries trebled -- but consumers have failed to benefit.
Professor Littlechild said he was taking such concerns into account in
considering further price capping measures for next year, although he
denied he had come under Government pressure to act.

HIGHLAND Regional Council is preparing to call for the closure of
Scotland's only opted out school, Dornoch Academy, because senior
councillors believe 73,000 Highland council tax payers are forced to pay
an extra #3 to support the school.
The Scottish Office rejects Highland's calculations and last night
released the contents of two Ministerial letters sent to council
vice-convener Peter Peacock.
Mr Peacock raised the matter in a letter to the council's education
convener Mrs Val MacIver. He tells Mrs MacIver that, following Scottish
Office correspondence at the turn of the year, there had been further
invesitigations.
From these, ''it emerged that the Government gives us an allowance in
our grant-aided expenditure totals of some #200,000 in relation to
Dornoch, but actually deducts some #400,000.
''What this means is that, in order to meet the Government's capping
rules the regional council has to reduce its spending by the sum of some
#200,000 more than would otherwise be the case, and Highland council
taxpayers are being required to fund Dornoch Academy to the tune of #3
on their council tax to make up for the Government shortfalls in funds
to Dornoch.''
Mr Peacock said that he had made it clear to Education Minister Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton that it was completely unaccepable that Highland
council taxpayers had to face a reduction in services and make up the
Government's shortfall for Dornoch while being unable to exercise any
democratic control over the school.
In her reply, Mrs MacIver says that she is dismayed by the financing
arrangement for Dornoch which placed the Highland education service in a
position of substantial disadvantage.
''As you know only too well, the financing of the education service in
our region is now at a very criticial stage and we are requiring to face
some very difficult decisions.''
One was the number of empty school places, an emotive issue which the
education committee would have to address.
''If, as a local education authority, we have to take unpalatable
decisions in regard to the ongoing future of our own schools, it seems,
as you suggest, only proper that we take into account the fact that
Dornoch Academy is indeed a financial burden on the Highland region
service and that its continued existence is unjustified at a time when
the public purse is under extreme pressure.''
The Scottish Office said last night that it could best counter Mr
Peacock's charges by releasing two letters sent to him by Lord James on
January 16 and February 22.
In these Lord James stresses that the Government's policy is to ensure
that the funding of Dornoch reflects as closely as possible what it
would have cost its education authority to run had it not opted out. He
rejected the notion that capping levels necessitated significant cuts.

Washington,
THE Government last night appeared prepared to make it easier for Sinn
Fein to enter political negotiations by softening conditions for the
IRA's hand-over of weapons, a move which enraged Ulster Unionists.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, said in Washington
that Britain is seeking from Sinn Fein and the IRA ''a willingness in
principle to disarm progressively . . . in order to test the practical
arrangements and demonstrate good faith.''
He said he wants: ''The actual decommissioning of some arms as a
tangible confidence-building measure.'' In this way Sinn Fein can take
its place at a negotiating table for a lasting settlement.
With the mention of only ''some arms'' and ''willingness in
principle'', the reported remarks from Washington inflamed the Ulster
Unionists at the Commons. They are already threatening to back a
unionist candidate in the coming Perth and Kinross by-election to
replace the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn.
Their chief whip, Mr Willie Ross, said: ''He has let them completely
off the hook by saying that if there is a token surrender of arms the
Government will talk to them. We had them pinned to the wall. Sir
Patrick has shot the peace process in the foot.''
Unionist security spokesman Ken Maginnis was even more scathing. ''The
Secretary of State must have gone stark raving mad if he believes the
future peace of Northern Ireland can be based on token gestures by the
IRA. One hundred tonnes of sophisticated modern weapons and explosives
and we are being asked to think in terms of tokens.
''Northern Ireland requires better than this ridiculous Don Quixote
who it appears may be happy to tilt at windmills with a token .22 pistol
provided the gun comes complete with two full magazines. It's
pathetic.''
The Ulster Unionists sought immediate reassurance from Sir Patrick's
number two, Mr Michael Ancram, who is in charge of trying to woo all the
Northern Ireland political parties to serious negotiations on a
political settlement that will underpin the ceasefire.
Mr Ancram attempted to appease them. ''I have reassured the Unionists
that Sir Patrick's conditions are still the same: the paramilitaries
must produce a substantial decommissioning of weapons if they want to
come to the table or others to join them at the table.''
Sir Patrick underlined that in Washington where he was having talks
with US officials, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
Sir Patrick said: ''What we are saying is that substantive progress
has to be made in the decommissioning of arms before Sinn Fein could be
admitted to substantial talks about an overall political settlement.''
Mr Christopher also called on both the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries
to begin disposing of their weapons.
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams rejected Sir Patrick's assertion that
his party could not join round table talks unless the IRA moved on the
arms issue. He told a meeting in Limerick: ''This position is a
nonsense. It is British Government policy which excludes Sinn Fein and
labels our voters second class.''
He added: ''Sinn Fein is not the IRA. Patrick Mayhew knows this.''
On Sinn Fein's ''role'' in the US, Sir Patrick remained firm. He made
the most public possible demand that President Clinton refuse to see Mr
Adams when he comes to Washington later this week, and said it would be
a mistake to lift the ban on fund-raising in the US. He said: ''It would
be dismaying to 50 million people to see Mr Adams shaking hands with the
leader of the greatest democracy in the world.''
The Sinn Fein leader will be in America over the weekend, and will
attend the St Patrick's Day parade, which is held on the nearest Sunday.
He will not, however, attend a special Congress lunch. The Speaker of
the House of Representatives, Republican Newt Gingrich, said he had
discussed with Clinton administration officials inviting Mr Adams to the
annual St Patrick's lunch: he was discouraged from doing so.
Mr Clinton and Irish Premier John Bruton will attend, but New York
Republican Representative, Mr Peter King, said he would boycott it
because Mr Adams was not invited.

FIFE Regional Council's SNP group leader, Councillor Paul Gillon, has
resigned from the party amid claims of grass roots democracy being
suppressed.
This reduces Fife's Nationalist representation to three, councillors
Jimmy Cook and Peter and Fiona Grant.
Councillor Gillon, who lost the selection for the Kennoway seat for
election to the new Fife authority, has become increasingly at odds with
the way in which the SNP Central Fife constituency has been run, and is
leaving open the option of standing under other colours on polling day,
April 6.
In a letter to SNP headquarters, Councillor Gillon, a regional
councillor since 1987 -- taking the Kennoway Windygates seat from Labour
by five votes -- and a party member for 21 years, wrote: ''It is clear
from the manner in which the selection procedure was carried out, and
other factors over the past five years, that the constituency hierarchy
no longer wish me to represent the SNP in Kennoway.''
He went on to blame SNP headquarters for its failure to uphold local
democracy and local branch development. The latter is a reference to
attempts by 40 party members to form a Kennoway branch.

POLICE are to keep a round-the-clock guard on the home of Central Fife
MP Henry McLeish following alleged threats by the Graham family of
Glenrothes
Mr McLeish said last night that he was ''clearly alarmed'' by comments
made by Mr Gordon Graham after the family was refused the right to
appeal to the Court of Session against eviction from a home in the
town's Alexander Road.
Speaking on a Scottish Television programme, Mr Graham, 39, said he
would site a caravan outside Mr McLeish's Baird Drive home and stay for
a couple of weeks. ''We are not allowed to sleep in it,'' he added,
''but we can park it outside any place. I think I'll go to Baird Drive
for a start-off. I might take the kids up so they can have a game of
football and enjoy themselves.''
Mr McLeish said later: ''Obviously I am alarmed at the possibility of
any trouble. I have been in touch with the chief inspector and there
will be a round-the clock patrol of the area and policemen in the street
keeping a watchful eye on the house.''
Mr McLeish, whose wife Margaret died last month, said: ''This is a sad
situation indeed. My only regret is that, unfortunately, in public life
whatever I do inevitably affects my family.
''But I cannot and will not escape my responsibilities to the wider
community. I hope Mr Graham will now take a serious look at himself and
acknowledge that if he and his family wish to attain accommodation
somewhere in the future they will have to improve their behaviour rather
than indulging in threats to myself and others.''
Following a 17-day hearing, Sheriff Principal John Maguire yesterday
rejected applications by Gordon and Anne Graham for certificates stating
that their case is suitable for consideration by the Court of Session.
Glenrothes Development Corporation is now free to evict the family
from the house any time after March 29.
The Grahams, whose eldest son James, 16, is serving five years for
crippling Glenrothes woman Pauline McConnachie in a hit-and-run, are not
living in the house following a chip pan fire and flooding caused by
burst pipes.

A FLOOD prevention scheme costing #4m and designed to protect hundreds
of families living in Pollok, Glasgow, was officially opened yesterday.
It was due to be unveiled in December, but major floods hit areas of
Paisley and Pollok only two days before the ceremony was scheduled.
Although there was heavy flooding in Pollok, Strathclyde region said
yesterday it was caused by blocked drains and not a failure of the new
system.
''Had this scheme not been constructed there would have been greater
flooding,'' said regional councillor Bill Timoney.
The new scheme involved building walls and barriers along 2.5km of the
Brock Burn and Levern Water.
Meanwhile, council chiefs in Renfrewshire have lodged a fresh appeal
for cash assistance from the Scottish Office to help clear up the damage
caused by the floods which hit the area three months ago.
More than #2m is required to repair almost a hundred council houses
seriously damaged and still lying empty.
The majority are in Paisley's Stockholm Crescent and Barterholm areas.

SCOTS women meeting across the party divide have made a dramatic
breakthrough in agreeing mechanisms to produce a Scottish Parliament
based on the principle of gender equality.
While the Labour Party and Liberal Democrat partners on the Scottish
Constitutional Convention remain on the surface as far apart as ever on
legislating for equality of representation in their proposed new
Parliament, a group of women members from both parties and other
interested groups have come close to a solution.
Their negotiations are so promising that a last-minute Labour paper is
to be tabled before the party meets in Inverness over the weekend, and
The Herald has learned that the advances are sufficient for a joint
Labour-Liberal Democrat press conference to be held there on Friday.
''We have had a series of good discussions and have begun to reach a
consensus, which is after all what women are meant to be good at,'' said
Councillor Marilyne MacLaren, convener of the Scottish Liberal Democrats
and one of the driving forces between the cross-party discussions.
The day had opened on an unpromising note on the issue, as the
Scottish Labour Party produced what was seen as a lacklustre document on
plans for a Scottish Parliament.
In most respects it took the party's position no further forward, and
on the key outstanding question of equal representation of men and women
in the Parliament it seemed negative, pointing out that the proposals of
the constitutional commission set up by the convention did not go far
enough to meet Labour policy.
''We regret that the commission was not able to find a statutory
method to ensure that women will be equally represented,'' says the
document, which points out that the creation of a new institution was a
fresh start which should be seized to build in gender equality from the
outset.
The problem within the Scottish Constitutional Convention has been
that while both Labour and Liberal Democrat members support the
principle of gender equality, Labour women believe it should be
legislated for while the traditional Liberal stance has been that this
must be achieved by voluntary means.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson was put on the defensive at
a press conference yesterday but hinted that the cross-party grouping of
women was working towards a consensus.
''The progress has been largely at a woman-to-woman level,'' he said.
''Where there has been a breakthrough I think it has been down to the
determination of women to find an agreement within the constitutional
convention.
The leader of the Labour side in the discussions, Ms Rosina McCrae,
was not available last night, but one of the other leading Labour women
said: ''Things have gone reasonably well and at the very least the
inter-party talks appear to have provided us with a safety net.''
Councillor MacLaren for the Liberal Democrats said they had come up
with a scheme which would, if not resolve the difference of opinion,
then would at least take the issue forward. ''We have found a way to
meet in the middle,'' she said.
