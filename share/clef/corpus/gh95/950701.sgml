HI honey, you're home. This is the first line you have to learn: if
you're going for the authentic American accent in furnishings and decor,
you don't want to spoil the effect by displaying what the dreaded
Senator McCarthy used to call un-American activities.
Already, no doubt, you've got all of the necessary American lifestyle
and accessories. Your kids will wear baseball caps back to front and sit
with their sneakers on the coffee table. You will know what a popsicle
is, although you've never met one.
Biscuits have become cookies, your garden's now a yard, and you eat
with a fork in your right hand and your elbows on the table.
Fine so far. But you need some inside information to add the final
touches. There are two ways of gaining this: you can go to the States
and poke around in people's houses, or -- the cheaper option -- you can
read a few mags or books. For example, do you know what should be found
in the American-style fridge?
Truman Capote described a raid on a wealthy couple's food stocks in
Park Avenue, New York. ''The Berkowitz refrigerator'' was a glutton's
fantasy, a cornucopia of fattening goodies: coconut cupcakes, mocha
cake, pistachio ice cream. The raiders loaded soup-bowls with this
stuff, ''fell upon it like abused orphans'' and returned for more.
So obviously, to do the thing properly you're going to need an
entirely new wardrobe, in two sizes larger. But what about the rest of
this stylish apartment, furnished and decorated from an overstuffed
wallet?
Capote described a room which seemed to be made entirely of mahogany
-- parquet floors, wall panelling and ''costly reproductions of
grandiose period-piece furniture -- though God knows what period,
perhaps early Grand Concourse.''
Mulberry velvet swathed the windows, which were incongruously covered
with mustard-brown venetian blinds, and above the carved-mahogany
fireplace was a mahogany-framed portrait of jowly old Berkowitz himself,
depicted as a country squire dressed for fox hunting.
Hm, maybe that's not what you had in mind. Maybe something more
traditional? Here's an ad from an Oklahoma real estate magazine pleading
with you to visit just that: ''Elegant, tasteful and classic all
describe this authentic Georgian traditional. Four beds, 3.5 baths, two
living plus gameroom, two dining, wood floors, mud room, butler's
staircase, computer room.''
Any questions? For example: What do you wear in a mud room. What is
point-five of a bathroom, and is 3.5 really enough? Are two dining rooms
necessary if you're not considering divorce? Will your butler appreciate
his staircase? What did an authentic Georgian computer look like?
If we're going American-style, we've got a wee bit to learn.

HELSINKI: A growing number of bears in eastern Finland are disturbing
farmers, stealing beehives and potentially endangering motorists,
officials say. About 30 brown bears -- roughly twice the usual number --
have been spotted this year near the Russian border in Ruokolahti, a
county some 170 miles east of Helsinki. ''Bears stole dozens of beehives
before I put up electric fences,'' said Pekka Karoniemi, a bee farmer
near Ruokolahti. ''Now, I've got 100% protection. Bears don't like
electric shocks.''

* PUBLIC enthusiasm for the Santa Fe-style furniture which his
companydesigns, manufactures and retails has led to Mike Faulkener
expanding into a former cinema and dancehall adjoining his Pine Country
shop in Morningside, Edinburgh.
To be called The Great American Indoors, it opens at the end of this
month and will sell exclusive bedroom, living-room and kitchen pieces in
Santa Fe, Shaker, and Colorado-Log style, with 21 different paint
finishes available in addition to those which are weathered and stained.
A former cowboy, lawyer, self-taught designer and fan of Americana,
Mike Faulkener says: ''I was convinced that although Santa Fe style had
barely appeared this side of the Atlantic, there would be a market for
the strong, simple lines and some bleached patina of this most
deep-rooted design style, borrowing as it does from the cultural
trichotomy of the European settlers, Hispanic community and native
American tribes of America's desert south-west.
Thanks to exposure to Shaker-style furniture in shops such as Habitat,
Faulkener believes there's a natural crossover and sympathy between
Shaker and Santa Fe, ''although the use of colour, carving, and naive
Pueblo Indian motifs in the latter makes for a vigour and excitement
lacking in Shaker style.
''Add to this, the extraordinary number of features on American homes
in glossy interior magazines in recent years, the popularity of low-cost
fly-drive holidays to the US, and the resurgence of the biographic
cowboy, indeed native American movie genre, and it's easy to see how the
public has been stimulated into developing an interest in things
American.''
Pine Country could be fairly called unique, set as it is in an amazing
recreation of the Western townscape of ''El Paso'' -- which has even
incorporated the back of Morningside Library into its ''set''.

0* THREE years ago the United States Navy packed up its submarine base
in Holy Loch and pulled out of Dunoon after 30 years.
But one legacy has remained; the hundred or so homes on the outskirts
of Sandbank at the top of the Holy Loch, which were built to American
specifications 20 years ago to house servicemen and their families.
Now the Americans have gone home, buyers here are discovering the
advantages of living Stateside beneath the rolling Kilmun Hills.
Although the development was built as rented accommodation, American
servicemen demanded a ''home from home'' to exacting specifications;
open-plan living areas, extensive storage, and their own kitchen
appliances.
Anyone who has seen an American kitchen will know that their cookers,
freezers and fridges tend to make ours look like Dinky toys by
comparison. The American way is to store every edible item in the
fridge, and you need a huge oven to cook a twenty-pound turkey for
Thanksgiving. So kitchen appliances were shipped over and transformers
fitted to cater for the different voltage system.
Around 15 years ago Peter Blacker, of Sandhaven Property Trading
Limited, bought the entire development. With an eye to the future, he
continued to rent the homes to US servicemen. But when the last ship
pulled out of Holy Loch in March 1992, an extensive external
refurbishment programme swung into action and a few months later 44
homes in Sandhaven were put on the market.
Internally, the homes remained as they were, with the original
kitchens and in many instances the original all-American cookers.
''Inside, the houses were superb but externally the development looked
pretty drab and dull,'' says Lorna Stewart, sales manager for Sandhaven
Homes. ''Now it's much more colourful with red roofs instead of grey,
white-painted walls, gutters and downpipes, mono-block driveways and
landscaped, fenced-off gardens.
''The open-plan layouts were retained, and although some servicemen
took all their kitchen appliances back with them to America, for some
reason many left behind their cookers. We gave a few away to locals who
wanted them, but most were sold with the houses,'' she added.
Margaret and Donald Gillies were among the early buyers who inherited
an American cooker. Now retired, they moved from Lenzie to their
three-bedroom home in Dunoon as soon as they saw it.
''We have kept everything intact because it was the American style
that attracted us so much,'' says Margaret. ''Everything about this
house is bigger; the kitchen cupboards are more spacious, we have fitted
wardrobes in every bedroom with a walk-in dressing room off the main
bedroom, a separate utility room and a huge walk-in cupboard in the
hall.
''And although the kitchen, living room and dining room downstairs is
completely open plan, we have found it very economical to heat from the
original oil-fuelled central heating system.
''As for the cooker, I wouldn't be without it. It has the usual four
electric rings on top but the oven is enormous, and as I bake a lot, I
can now cook a whole batch of cakes at one go. I only wish I'd had this
cooker when the children were at home,'' she added.
However, Lorna Stewart says not all buyers greeted their
American-style homes with such enthusiasm. ''Some have since put up
internal walls and done away with the open-plan layout. And a few have
installed new kitchens -- with traditional British cookers,'' she said.
''But with buyers coming from as far as Canada, Germany, and South
Africa, you could say that this American legacy has turned Dunoon into
the cosmopolitan centre of the Clyde coast.''

Appliance Centre in London. Tel: 0181-506-2039.

* MOST gardeners accept that earthworms process organic matter and
improve soil fertility . . . provided they're not gobbled up by New
Zealand flat worms. These dark, sticky beasties -- whose ribbon-like
bodies grow up to seven inches long -- are apparently wriggling their
way across the country, according to Garden Answers magazine, which is
running a campaign to halt their progress. Indeed, they have been
spotted (usually under pots or stones) in Scotland, Northern Ireland,
Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Durham and Carlisle. As they eat our
local earthworms, the soil structure could be at risk. Gardeners are
asked to hunt out flat worms and send any they find to Garden Answers at
Apex House, Oundle Road, Peterborough PT2 9NP. Or telephone Adrian Wild
on 01733-898100.

ASK THE EXPERT: IAN WALLS
* WHEN I decided to try planting onions this year for the first time,
I bought them in a net bag and planted them 4in apart. You can imagine
my surprise when they started coming up in bunches. There are four to
six small things that look like syboes, all stuck together, and green
stalks that are withering. Something must have gone wrong.
* IT sounds as if you got shallots, or garlic, instead of the onions
you wanted. These will, as you say, form clusters of small bulbs instead
of making one large bulb, like an onion. Make the best of it. Use the
surprise crop in a salad!
* TWO months ago, I decided to plant a rowan and a Golden Delicious
apple tree. They both came into bud, but they now seem to be dying back.
I am wondering what the trouble is.
* THIS looks like the result of what is called delayed drought
reaction. What happens here is that the trees will start to grow, using
their reserves of sap, then they run out of moisture, perhaps because of
dry soil or badly damaged roots.
The thing to do is to leave well alone. You may find that they do
recover eventually. If there is some die-back in the branches, you will
need to do some pruning, preferably in the autumn.

A triumph of horticultural teamwork impresses Wendy Jack
* BY transforming the walled garden of the stately Hopetoun House at
South Queensferry into what is undoubtedly one of Scotland's most
delightful places, Dougal Philip has raised the garden centre to an art
form.
Covering six acres, it includes glorious semi-formal gardens which
extend to wide lawns with a lily pond, statuary, walls clustered with
great trusses of lavendar wisteria, roses and other delights, and a
woodland walk, which at this time is brilliant with rhododendron, azalea
and other botanical beauties offset to perfection amongst fine old
trees.
Originally Dougal Philip landscaped gardens for a living, always
painfully aware that a broken limb would render him unable to work and
earn. A chance remark of his at a party given by a former factor at
Hopetoun eventually led to a new career and business.
''I said I'd make the walled garden commercial by turning it into a
garden centre -- I knew nothing about retailing then,'' he says. ''The
factor picked me up on my remark later, and asked if I was serious.''
In partnership with his wife Sally, he has run Hopetoun garden centre
for 16 years, with a staff of eight. ''For the first ten years the
garden was a millstone because we were trying to develop it. The
investment in plants and materials was enormous. The past five years has
seen it all coming together. At last we've got on top of it; the plants
are coming to maturity and I've got such a good staff who've pulled me
out of my pioneer crisis, got involved, and taken responsibility.''
Each person has a different area of expertise. Lesley Watson, the
manager, was one of the panel of experts on BBC Radio Scotland's Down to
Earth programme a few years ago, and was a recent guest on The
Beechgrove Potting Shed, so there's a plethora of advice for those who
seek it, and chatty informative notes at many plant and shrub areas.
With around 10,000 plants carried, some 60% of these available at any
one time, Philip says: ''We find list selections available to the public
very dull and standard. There's nothing wrong with bog-standard things
because they are safe, reliable and perform well. I suppose 20% of our
plants are these, but to an extent, it's the way you use them in a
garden which makes them work or not.''
The other 80% of stock he describes as ''the exciting things, the
quite obscure plants that maybe only flower for a couple of weeks a year
but are stunning''.
The most exciting thing that has happened to gardening in recent
years, he believes, is that people have become more adventurous, no
longer recreating mirror images of what their parents had. Planters
filled with shrubs and flowers have become hugely popular: ''The advent
of relatively cheap containers from the Far East has given a wide
choice, and gardens getting smaller means people have to try harder to
make them work.''
In terms of theme gardens, there is a host of ideas at Hopetoun. Take
Oriental as an example: ''Our interpretation of it is very western,''
says Philip. ''We don't take on the id and all that, but we take on
board the serenity, the escape, things that suit our lifestyle.''
Positive poetry introduces the visitor to the two small gardens in the
Oriental-theme section at Hopetoun. One reads: ''An oasis for safe
retreat from the noise, bustle and aggravation of modern life. The sound
of running water and so many interesting plants -- mainly leaves with
flowers appearing here and there all year.''
With a gift shop selling unusual and tasteful items, the former
potting shed completely refurbished and turned into a coffee shop of
charm where home-made soups, snacks and home baking are available all
day, the Philips team has worked wonders at Hopetoun. Few can leave
without some new treasure -- and a feeling of having been uplifted.

IAN WALLS considers today's big gardening question
* THE philosophy of organic gardening is quite clear. Plants produced
without chemical fertilisers are recycled back to the land through
composting, and are a natural source of plant nutrients for the next
crop.
Enthusiasts claim that all the natural antigens and antibodies
contained in plants are recycled also. Introduce synthetic chemical
fertilisers, and you break this vital cycle of growth.
I am not a total organic devotee, although I use organically-based
fertilisers and am closely involved in the recycling of industrial
organic waste. However, research by the Soil Association and the Henry
Doubleday Association shows considerable support for organic methods.
Strictly organic practices mean reorganising your garden. You have to
compost every available bit of organic matter you can find, even if it
means going out collecting herbage from hedgerows. I suspect you would
have to do this to get enough compost.
You don't buy chemical fertilisers or weedkillers, but ones which have
natural origins instead, and you must adopt natural methods of pest and
disease control.
There is lots of good advice available, and it sounds nice and rosy,
but when you talk to soil chemists they tell you that a lot of organic
gardening is mumbo jumbo.
They point out that plants extract nutrients in the same form, whether
it is derived from organic materials or not.
Recent scares about nitrate uptake of plants, especially green crops
such as lettuce, with possible effects on human health, is as much
related to the uptake of organic nitrate as inorganic chemical nitrate,
they say.
All may not be known about plant nutrition, but there would appear to
be good grounds for reducing fertiliser applications across-the-board.
There is some concern about the widespread application of sewage to
the land, as an alternative to prohibited dumping at sea, not only from
a chemical stand-point but from the risk of spreading disease.
There is a long way to go before all the questions can be answered. In
the meantime, gardeners find themselves in a dilemma.
What best to do? The swing to organically-based fertilisers has been
considerable in recent years, in addition to increased interest in
composting household and garden waste. The uptake of organic principles
has not been dramatic.
Pesticides in all their forms enjoy healthy sales, and they go through
a stringent screening programme by the Government. However, loopholes do
exist.

* IT IS time for summer pruning of apples, pears and plums, especially
in a restricted form, writes IAN WALLS. The object is to divert the
vigour of the tree into forming new fruit buds instead of producing new
shoots.
All you do is reduce fresh young shoots growing from the main stem. In
wall-grown trees this growth would be outward, and you should restrict
them to four or five leaves. You can also do this with redcurrants or
gooseberries.
In the flower garden, consider giving roses a bit of a boost with a
complete fertiliser or one with a good ratio of potash.
It is becoming the fashion to mulch rose beds with forest bark to
conserve moisture and keep down weeds. You can do the same with old
mushroom compost and you will get a crop of mushrooms in time, as a
bonus.
With shrub borders generally, remember that forest bark does not
directly feed plants, although the reverse can be true if the bark uses
up nitrogen. Then you have to feed as well as mulch.
If you want to have a go at propagating, the ideal place is a shaded
cold frame with liberal quantities of sand to make it free-draining.
Many shrubs root easily, particularly if you remove small side shoots
3-4in long with a heel, which is a portion of the main stem. This
provides a lot of super-active cells which will greatly speed up the
rooting process.
It is a moot point whether to use hormone powder. Some research
indicates that it's of no great benefit, yet it is still widely used by
the professionals.
Another technique you can try is layering carnations. Make a cut on
the shoot, but don't let it break off. The shoot is layered to the
ground, which has some sand added, and secured with a hairpin or piece
of galvanised wire.
Sandy soil or potting compost goes on top to conserve moisture. Keep
the mound reasonably watered, but otherwise let the plant get on with
it. It's amazing how it can find moisture, drawing reserves from the
parent plant. You can use this system also with floppy shrubs.
There should be plenty available for harvesting in the vegetable
garden. Use early potatoes when young and fresh. The same goes for
shallots, broad beans and all the things you remembered to sow or plant
around April in the vegetable garden should be ready for harvesting.
Shallots can be forked out before being put into a cold frame to dry
off, along with any herbs. And remember not to let up on watering the
tomatoes.

* Good news for those who know the value of more power in the garden
shredding department. One of AL-KO's most popular shredders -- the
H1100s introductory model -- has been fitted with a larger 1300 watt
motor, but its price stays the same. Voted ''best buy'' by the
Consumers' Association, the machine will shred material up to 25mm in
diameter. General garden material is fed through the main hopper while a
separate feed shoot takes single branches. It is fitted with all the
latest safety mechanisms -- most notably an automatic cut-out to ensure
that it cannot operateman operate when blades are exposed -- and costs
just under #160. For more details, telephone 01869 590295.

Beverley Brown meets a Scots couple who, when bad weather strikes, are
off to . . .
* FOR about two-thirds of the year, Roderick and Elizabeth Dunlop
enjoy living in their four-bedroom detached home in Bearsden. But when
our Scottish winter bites, and for at least six weeks during the summer,
they abscond to their other four-bedroom detached home in Kissimmee,
Florida.
Roderick, an electrical retailer, also uses the house for business
entertaining throughout the year. By comparison, their Florida home was
the less expensive of the two and came with a few extras they don't have
in Bearsden, such as their own private swimming pool, and with
Disneyworld almost on their doorstep, Richard (15), Susan (14) and
Michael (11) don't need a second invitation to pack.
The Dunlops have taken to their dual lifestyle like ducks to water.
But their American home was an impromptu purchase. ''We had been to
Florida several times but on one holiday about three years ago, we went
to see a new showhouse nearby, just out of curiosity,'' says Elizabeth.
''On a sudden impulse, we found ourselves ordering one there and
then,'' she adds. ''Apart from the showhouse, nothing was built when we
bought the plot in July. The builder promised the house would be
finished and ready for occupation by November, which I didn't believe at
the time.
''Neither did I believe the hour we then spent with an interior
designer. That was all it took to ''furnish'' the entire house, from
carpet and fabric samples and furniture catalogues. I chose the fabric
for the settees, pelmets and bedspreads.
''The interior designer said she would chose the lamps and everything
else. She also said it would be completely finished for us coming over
in the November. We both left her thinking the same; ''No way''.
''I know that American service is good but I just couldn't imagine how
buying and furnishing a house on this basis could work,'' added
Elizabeth.
With trepidation, Roderick and Elizabeth flew into Orlando airport
that November and discovered that not only did the system work, it
worked perfectly. ''We couldn't believe it. The house was finished, the
pool was filled and inside was fully furnished right down to the colour
co-ordinated toilet rolls. The dining room table was beautifully set out
with cutlery and folded napkins, with fresh flowers in every room. I was
also amazed to find that the interior designer had positioned everything
exactly where I would have put it,'' says Elizabeth.
Hiring a management company was the next step. They routinely check
the chemicals in the pool, cut the grass to the regulated height,
prepare the house ahead of visitors or owners arriving and operate the
necessary pest control service.
''Ants can be a big problem and you very quickly become accustomed to
never leaving a scrap of food or rubbish lying around,'' says Elizabeth.
''This is one reason why American fridges are so big -- absolutely
everything is kept in it.''
Set within a quiet, private estate, the Dunlops' home is not unduly
large by American standards. But compared to their Bearsden home, it's
huge; on the ground floor they have an integral double garage, fully
screened and heated swimming pool to the rear with access via patio
doors into the open-plan leisure room, fully fitted kitchen and
lounge/dining room, which is over 27ft long.
Upstairs is a magnificent main bedroom which, taken with its adjacent
en-suite bathroom and shower room, spans the entire width of the house.
''This is my favourite room,'' says Elizabeth, ''it's larger than any
bedroom I have seen, and as we don't have an en-suite bathroom at home
in Bearsden, it's a joy.''
There are three more double bedrooms, a second bathroom and an
all-important air conditioning system.
''Everything is so clean, the shops are airy and fresh, the people are
friendly, and superb service is automatic. But it's their family
orientated culture that I most enjoy,'' added Elizabeth.
The Dunlops' impromptu purchase has resulted in an unexpected job
bonus for Elizabeth; ''The management company were looking for a
Scottish agent -- and it seemed like another good idea,'' she said. ''I
came home and bought a fax machine, and now I liase with holidaymakers
who want to rent private homes in Florida.''
The family are now in the throes of packing once again and will be
back at their Florida home in time for the 4 July celebrations. Which in
accordance with everything else, will be a touch louder and larger than
events in Bearsden.

* PRODUCT design can begin with some very circuitous thinking
processes. Take the proliferation of knife attacks which afflicted
Glasgow in the fairly recent past, as an example . . .
Gavin Davison, a final-year student on Glasgow School Of Art's (GSA)
Product Design course, had a professional interest in knives and
cutlery. He discovered that cooking knives are believed to be involved
in almost 50% of knife attacks.
This and other facts led Gavin to think deeply about domestic
utensils, and knives in particular, and led to his Flint project. Back
in the Stone Age, one of the earliest knives was the flint, which was
shaped to nestle in the palm with the fingers controlling its use, thus
making it an extension of the hand.
Today's cooking knife, with its longer handle, means it is used more
as an extension of the arm, making it swordlike, and easily misused in
aggression as a weapon.
Gavin Davison says: ''I wanted to design a knife that was more an
extension of the fingers than the arm. Rather than having a handle, I
wanted it to be held closer to the blade. When I use a Stanley knife for
example, I don't use the handle, only the blade.''
Gavin's prototype knives are made of ceramic ''because I was
completely changing the form of the blade away from metal, and the
association with cold steel. You can get a really sharp cutting edge
with ceramic and it needs sharpening less often than metal, but being
brutal, it is more difficult to sharpen.''
The standard of product design students' work this year has been very
high, says Bob Shaw of the GSA. ''We have two Firsts. There's been a
very good group dynamic, everybody 'feeds off' one another and there is
a very good strong corporate image being developed.
''Having our degree shows on the Internet -- a first for GSA -- has
created huge interest from around the world, it's been very exciting.''

THERE was no better front-runner than Peter Thomson, but Australian
Wendy Doolan gave a good impersonation when she completed a second round
of 68 to extend her overnight lead in the Hennessy Cup at Refrath,
Cologne, yesterday.
With an 11-under-par aggregate of 133, Doolan leads by three strokes
from Britain's Trish Johnson who had a 66 to share second place with
American Jane Geddes, a former US and British Open champion.
Gillian Stewart, despite dropping shots at the sixteenth and
seventeenth holes, shot a 70 which was matched by Julie Forbes leaving
them at two under with Dale Reid on 145 following a 74.
Doolan, who has never led after two rounds, admitted to being nervous
at the start of the day. ''I was shaky for the first four holes but kept
trying to hit my drives on to the fairway and let the rest take care of
itself,'' she said.
Back-to-back birdies at the fourth and fifth relieved the tension for
the Sydney golfer, who also birdied the long ninth and eighteenth.
Johnson, winner of the tournament in 1990, recaptured the putting
touch which has hampered her over the last three years. She gathered an
impressive haul of seven birdies, but with a 64 for the taking she drove
into trouble for a closing bogey 6.
World No.1 Laura Davies did trim eight strokes off her opening round
of 79, but trails 17 behind the Australian. Leading scores (British or
Irish unless stated):
133 -- W Doolan (Australia) 65, 68.
136 -- T Johnson 70, 66; J Geddes (USA) 67, 69.
137 -- K Orum (Denmark) 71, 66; C Dibnah (Australia) 70, 67.
138 -- H Wadsworth 72, 66; A Sorenstam (Sweden) 68, 70.
139 -- S Prosser 73, 66; L Neumann (Sweden) 71, 68; R Hetherington
(Australia) 70, 69; M-L de Lorenzi (France) 69, 70; A Nicholas 69, 73.
140 -- H Alfredsson (Sweden) 73, 67; J Morley 70, 70; E Orley
(Switzerland) 68, 72.
141 -- L Fairclough 73, 68; K Webb (Australia) 71, 70.
Other scores included: 142 -- G Stewart 72, 70; J Forbes 72, 70. 145
-- D Reid 71, 74.

SCOTLAND'S selectors meet on Tuesday to chose a squad for the Triple
Crown Tournament, held in Belfast in three weeks. However, in many
respects, those with the task of picking that party also will be
developing the make-up of future Scottish teams.
Next year, Scotland will compete in the ICC Trophy in Malaysia, the
game's mini World Cup. And on the evidence of this season there is work
to do.
Tuesday's NatWest defeat by Nottinghamshire only confirmed, yet again
following the Benson and Hedges failure, the huge gap between the
professionals and amateurs.
However, it also highlighted faults in the Scotland set-up that need
to be attended to sooner, rather than later -- and preferably in time to
be tried in the Triple Crown event.
Only domination, rather than occupation, works in limited-over
cricket. It is doubtful if anyone in Scotland can touch captain Alastair
Storie for technical ability, and no-one ever has.
What questions have been asked of Storie, concern his approach to the
limited-overs game, the format where Scotland hope to gain recognition
at world level.
Only last year he was lambasted for his slow innings against Ireland,
but answered that criticism with a century. However, against Notts, the
former county player again climbed into his defensive shell.
Storie's knock pulled Scotland out of a hole, but his inability to up
the pace, or attack, acted like a brake.
He only got back into the Scotland side after illness sidelined Jim
Love for the B&amp;H match at Worcester. Now, the time may have come to try
someone new.
George Salmond (Arbroath) is the natural choice, although a first-ball
duck against Notts was not the best way to stake a claim to the
captaincy.
The time has come for the selectors to be bold and select a captain
for the future, not the short term. The Triple Crown, followed by a
possible winter trip, and an eight-nation tournament next summer would
give Salmond time to settle in.
New faces have been tried and found lacking. Bruce Patterson, Iain
Philip, Mike Smith, and Gordon McGurk all can provide runs. But one name
the selectors must consider for the Triple Crown is Aberdeenshire's Neil
McRae -- currently at Essex. He, too, can occupy the crease, but unlike
others he does not settle for 30 when he knows he can score 80.
On the bowling front, Scotland would like to have the pace pairing of
Warwickshire's Dougie Brown and Gavin Hamilton, of Yorkshire, for the
ICC Trophy next year.
There is not that much wrong with the Scotland side that some hard
work, application, and direction would not put right. But now is the
time to consider making changes, not in 12 months.

GLASGOW'S Cotton Print Factory Shop believes it has the largest
selection of curtain fabrics in Scotland, with more than 5000 rolls of
material on display on its two floors.
Florals, plains, stripes, checks, marbled effects, ethnic and
abstract, children's patterns -- they're all there in glorious
abundance.
You'll find extraordinarily low prices starting from #1 per yard up to
a maximum of #5.95 a yard. Many of the fabrics can be seen in other
retail outlets, usually for much higher prices.
The Cotton Print Factory Shop carries special purchases of fabrics by
market leaders such as Sanderson, Crossan, Linda Baird, and John
Willman, which sell for a remarkable #5.95 per yard.
Muslins started at #1.95 per yard with a patterned 54in width #2.95 --
and there is a good selection of voiles, including patterned, priced at
#3.95 per yard. Newly arrived is some very attractive lace for windows,
in white or cream, at #5.95 a yard.
As for linings, you will find coloured 54in wide soilproof sateen for
#2.95 a yard with cream sateen available in either 48in or 54in widths,
at #1.50 and #2.25 a yard respectively.
There's a full range of accessories, from curtain poles in wood and
painted finishes to metals, through rufflette tapes from a remarkable
20p per yard, to threads and brass effect tie backs at very competitive
prices.
Today, two exciting demonstrations are taking place at the shop.
First, there's a revolutionary new rufflette tape being demonstrated
which makes curtain making a simple task even for those without a sewing
maching, or indeed who can't sew.
Magic? Not quite. It works by placing the tape, then pressing with a
hot iron.
The second demonstration is by suppliers of display curtains, pelmets
and the like to the Cotton Factory Shop, who will provide the know-how
needed to make swags and tails.
The shop has videos regularly on view, with ''how-to-do'' programmes
which cover pelmet making, curtain tie backs and cushion making.
Today and tomorrow at the shop, we will see one of its occasional
Loading Bay sales take place (in the loading bay) where rolls of fabric
are sold at still more remarkable prices, to clear the shelves for new
stock. Back indoors, customers will find a pleasant and helpful staff of
whom manager Lorraine Kelly says: ''Nothing is too much trouble.''
Letters on display prove this is no idle boast.
A welcome idea for parents of young children, is a play area set aside
in a quiet corner -- beside the children's fabrics, handily enough,
where youngsters can play safely while their parents browse in peace.
For those who are unsure of how much material they will require, of
what kind of style will suit their windows, the staff are happy to give
advice. And, if you should need someone to make your curtains, the shop
has a number of independent curtain makers with whom customers can make
contact and discuss what is required.
The Cotton Print Factory Shop is located in Admiral Street off Paisley
Road West and is open Monday-Saturday 9.30am-4.30pm and on Sunday
between 10am and 5pm.

EAST LEAGUE
* HERIOT'S have two advantages as the league programme goes into its
inward half, writes Frank Moran.
They have a 100% record, meaning that a number of potential
challengers already have little realistic chance, and all but two of
their matches from now on are due to be played at Goldenacre, and
although the benefits of playing at home maybe less obvious than in
other sports, there is a psychological dividend.
Tomorrow they must travel to play Edinburgh Academicals and given
Accies form, this is not a game likely to fill the Herioters with
apprehension.
Across the road at Grange are Carlton, who have won all but one of
their games. Carlton's match at Goldenacre was lost through rain and
they are the other away opposition Heriot's have to face.
Wins for Falkland and Corstorphine last week sent shivers down a few
spines and tomorrow's opponents are likely to face a more spirited
challenge than might have expected. Royal High at Freuchie will cross
each other's paths as they make their way north and south respectively.
Watsonians will no doubt be anxious to secure safety points from the
visit of Stenhousemuir.

SCOTTISH COUNTIES
* FOLLOWERS of Aberdeenshire are hopeful that the club's success last
week against Ayrshire could set them up nicely for the rest of the
season.
So far inconsistency has been the name of the game, but if a side can
start to put some results together, then their chance of success will be
greatly boosted.
Wicket-keeper Colin Smith returns from injury and Aberdeenshire will
be looking to Andy Bee and Mike Smith to provide inspiration.
Ayrshire captain Andy Tennant is hoping that wicket-keeper David Haggo
will be available as the former league leaders aim to bounce back from a
recent defeat with a victory at home to Stirling County.
Stirling hope that the bulk of their attack will be available after
having missed out last week, and that Alan Sievright will be on form.
New leaders Strathmore County should not have too much trouble hanging
on to the top spot. Mark Kelaher's side entertain Perthshire, with the
visitors isolated at the bottom of the table and unlikely to stop the
rot tomorrow.
Alex Comer keeps his place as Clackmannan wicket-keeper against
Arbroath after last week's debut against Stirling, while West Lothian
are at home to Fifeshire.

WESTERN UNION
* KELBURNE, away this afternoon to championship leaders Clydesdale,
are in fifth place in the table, a position that would give them access
to the Scottish Cup, if they can remain there for the remainder of the
season, writes Stewart Weir.
However, the Whitehaugh club received a blow with the news that
professional Roger Telemachus will leave with the South African under-24
team to tour Sri Lanka.
''We have a few irons in the fire as far as a replacement goes, but we
would have prefered Roger to stay,'' said Kelburne captain Roddy
Fergusson.
Titwood, the fatest strip in the league, should suit Telemachus, and
Kelburne as well, hopes Fergusson. ''Roger likes faster wickets and even
now he's still coming to grips with the softer pitches.''
Stewart Cruickshank will be absent from the Kelburne team, his
honeymoon being of more importance to him.
Greenock visit Ayr, while third-top West of Scotland will have home
advantage against Kilmarnock after the game was switched from Kirkstyle
yet again.
Uddingston and Ferguslie, with identical percentage points, meet at
Bothwell Castle, while Poloc play Drumpellier.

FAME started life as an Alan Parker film made in 1980, with an
Oscar-winning title song. Then came the long running television series.
Now here's the stage musical set at the School Of Performing Arts in
New York.
The names of the characters may have been changed but their attitudes
remain the same. There's Carmen, a talented singer who quits school
early to find fame in Los Angeles, but gets trapped in the drug scene.
Loraine Velez shows star quality in the part and also gets to sing the
title song, the one song retained from the film.
Tyrone (Scott Sherrin) is a young dancer of genius, likely to be
flunked for his poor showing in English class. Add Richard Dempsey as a
coltish, endearing drama student, Jonathan Aris, a fine violinist bound
for the Juillard School, and Sonia Swabey as a dancer with a weight
problem who switches to singing with great success.
These are just a few of the attractively and ferociously talented cast
which includes splendid dancers and singers who perform a feast of
lively and energetic numbers written for them by Jacques Levy and Steve
Margoshes.
Fame doesn't offer much of a plot but makes up for it with boundless
energy, a flexible and impressive set which is effectively lit.
The show's youthful vitality, attractive cast and fast-pacey
production makes Fame a pleasing addition to London's bumper crop of
musicals.

The eagle has landed, along with the Kentucky fried chicken. As
Independence Day approaches, Wendy Jack looks at how America is
furnishing us with its influence and its craftsmanship
IT WAS probably the food that began the trend, as we enthusiastically
embraced the exotic aromas and zappy graphics of McDonald's multi-choice
burgers and Kentucky's Fried Clones to make them part and parcel of our
own culture.
Now the chips are down and regular fries are up. Fast food eaten in,
taken away or picked up at a drive-through. Giant party packs for home
entertainment. It has all merged into eternal Hollywood-on-the-box,
Disney, denims, and baseball caps, as we have come to celebrate all
that's American.
Indeed, with Independence Day coming up on Tuesday, now is the perfect
moment to reflect on our ever-growing appetite for vibrant things from
across the Atlantic.
Within the last couple of years, hard on the heels of Edinburgh's
Disney shop, Warner Bros Studio Stores have hit our high streets, with a
total of 10 in the UK. Scotland has just one so far -- in Glasgow's
Buchanan Street, which is one of the company's European flagship stores.
Warner Bros sells adults' and children's clothing, fashion, home
accessories, gifts and toys, and what it calls ''contemporary
collectibles'' which feature classic and current Warner Bros stars.
These can range in price from #2 up to a whopping #1500 for an original
work of art.
You are likely to find Warner Bros Studio Stores a delight or a
nightmare, depending on your taste. Customer profiles are usually unique
in each city, although in London, the top-selling characters -- Taz and
Bugs Bunny -- also capture Glasgow's heart. Not to mention Batman.
But while a typical Glasgow customer is aged up to 40, is probably
female and is most likely to be shopping for a gift, in London the age
range averages 18-35, with most shoppers single, and as likely to be
male as female.
It's not only the young who like Warner Bros, says company spokeswoman
Anne Janas. ''One of our most memorable letters in Glasgow came from an
octogenarian who was an avid Warner Bros and animation buff, with an
interest which spanned half-a-century. This had resulted in a close
friendship with the late, great Bette Davis. The lady was eager to visit
the store, and we were thrilled to have her join us on preview night.''
American furniture is becoming increasingly popular, and not only in
the back-to-basics starkness of Shaker style. Well-made pieces in fine
woods from American manufacturers such as Lineage and Bob Timberlake are
on display in room sets at Sterling's warehouse in Tillicoultry.
Timberlake, a very successful artist-turned-furnituremaker, bases his
work --chests, desks, tables, beds, chairs and upholstery -- on the
American heritage of handwork traditions.
Using the hand tools and woodwork techniques of early American
cabinetmakers, each piece is made from solid cherry, and chests and
tables have solid oak drawers with cedar bases to absorb excess
moisture.
George Knowles Jnr, managing director of the Sterling Furniture Group,
says: ''People are looking for well designed and traditional crafted
solid furniture which is that little bit different, but will last a
lifetime.''
Sterling's displays have very pleasing antique knick-knacks which help
set the theme. There are some highly unusual pieces, such as a giant
dolls' house which opens up to reveal a cocktail cabinet . . .
What we need to adopt next is surely America's
nothing's-too-much-trouble attitude towards visitors. It's not only on
Independence Day that their universal message is ''Have a nice day''.

MY God did they go daft at the Royal SNO Prom last night. You'd have
thought Pavarotti and Caballe were up on the stage. And tenor Sidwill
Hartman's Nessun Dorma -- the last number in the show, need you ask --
opened the floodgates: stamping, roaring, shouting.
I need to acknowledge immediately that last night's Prom, another in
the endless Essential Opera series that are ubiquitous these days, and
played to a well-filled house, was a massive public success. I have to
say that, because what I say next will probably get me hanged.
Er . . . it was pretty run of the mill. I must set aside the euphoric
public reaction and say that, if you were there and bowled over by the
Royal SNO's performance, then please go and hear them on a good night.
Conductor Stephen Barlow managed to neutralise the sweep, zip, and flair
of Rossini's William Tell Overture; and in the Grand March from Aida he
produced playing that was wooden and ponderous, with no bite or thrust.
But it was in Barlow's accompaniments to operatic arias where the
giveaway really lay, especially in the music of Puccini. In a selection
from Tosca, it was like music by numbers: every ounce of the suppleness,
without which Puccinian phrases are meaningless, was ironed out. There
was neither beauty nor heat.
Soprano Susan McCulloch and tenor Sidwill Hartman did what they could.
Both are adequate singers. Oddly enough they were both weak in their
middle registers. Hartman has a stretched, hard sound that becomes
painful, while McCulloch was breathy and grainy. The programme and
performances -- pops from Verdi, Mascagni, Cilea and others -- were
consistently well-received.

* SUCCESS, whether it arrives as a number one record, film, play, or
book is a magnet for legal challenge. Usually the lawsuit charges the
melody or the plot or the idea was not the property of the credited
artist. It is so common in America that giant law practices exclusively
deal with such ''nuisance'' matters.
This week the legal brains at Warner Brothers Studios and the Los
Angeles based R &amp; T Development were working out how to handle a
complaint which is (so far) unique. Moviegoing millions were thrilled
and excited when Batman Forever opened in America but Andrew Leicester
had altogether different emotions. He was disgusted. He liked the film
but up there on the screen was his building. Rip-off, he thought. And
with the movie the first to break the $100m box-office barrier this
summer so did his lawyers.
Leicester has designed a public artwork which decorates a tower block
in downtown Los Angeles and, he says, here it was as the basis of a
studio set for the third Batman film. He filed a copyright infringement
suit against Warners saying that not only does the design with
futuristic pillars and bat-shaped gates ''star'' frequently in the movie
it is also heavily featured in promotional art and merchandising. How
has he been damaged?
''The work will never be the same. It's been distorted and changed and
corrupted,'' says the tortured 47-year-old artist, adding: ''The artwork
is portrayed as an integral part of an openly lurid, frenetic, and
violent Gotham City. The work was originally created as an oasis and
allegorical garden of calm and tranquillity.''
His lawyers say that something in the many millions of dollars will
most likely ease his emotional pain.
* THE Caped Crusader got another knock this week when Disney's
Pocahontas shoved it off the No 1 popularity slot. The latest animated
film from the Mouse people is not expected to do the business of last
year's Lion King, but is proving again there is a tremendous market for
family entertainment. Casper the friendly ghost saga will bridge the
magical $100m dollar box-office mark this weekend.
* SUPERSTAR-in-waiting Chris O'Donnell who plays Robin in Batman
Forever and for many steals the show in his gender-defining outfit is to
star in the film adapatation of author John Grisham's The Chamber.
It is his passport to the big time. Grisham's track record -- The
Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, and the present Rainmaker -- brings
a built-in audience to the box office.
And The Chamber is being scripted by William Goldman who has been
writing nothing but hits since Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The
credentials are impeccable.
For O'Donnell it has been a fast lane to fame. He made his mark
opposite Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman and followed up with The Three
Musketeers, Circle of Friends, Mad Love and this year's blockbuster,
Batman Forever.
With The Chamber he will be up there with Tom Cruise, Brad Pitty, and
Tom Hanks and his asking price -- probably around $8m a movie -- will
reflect that. In The Chamber he is a Southern attorney just out of law
school who attempts to save a Ku Klux Klansman from the gas chamber. The
kick is the Klansman is his grandfather.
* WINSTON Groom, the author of Forrest Gump, has withdrawn his threat
to sue Paramount Studios over the profits from the movie version. This
was after Paramount settled an undisclosed sum and signed him to write
the inevitable -- a Gump sequel . . .
* JOHNNY Depp asked producers to let him perform his own stunts for
Nick of Time and they told him to take a flying leap -- off the sixth
floor of the Weston Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles. Daredevil Depp
did. Into an air bag.

Alison Kerr previews the weekend's marathon of Jazz Festival music.
JAZZ Festival Mishap No 1 almost took place yesterday morning and
would have made interesting programme notes for the Europhonium event,
which takes place from Thursday.
Last week, Jazz Festival organisers were nagging the Edinburgh-based
drummer-cum-doctor (or vice versa) Tom Bancroft to send in some
biographical details for the programme, but the absent-minded
percussionist only remembered once the last post had left on Thursday
night.
So he set off yesterday morning into Edinburgh to make sure he caught
the earliest post possible, only to find when he got to the pillar box
that what he was about to post was a pair of trousers. Maybe he's
intending to model his natty notes on stage on Thursday.
Jazz fans seeking exercise can certainly find it in Glasgow this
weekend as a marathon of music takes place in and around the Merchant
City. Indeed it's possible to run the gamut of jazz from A to Z as
everyone from a veteran violinist to a disc-spinning DJ will be
performing. Even the Glasgow International Folk Festival appears to have
been bitten by the jazz bug. For do we not find in its programme a show
at the Tron, at 10pm tonight, by guitarist Fapy Laferton ''et le Jazz''.
Laferton, last heard in Edinburgh circa 1987, is a superb, Belgian
(not Dutch as the programme says), guitarist whose style -- although
unique and extremely versatile -- is comparable to that of the
legendary, Belgian guitarist Django Reinhardt.
The Grove Dictionary of Jazz goes as far as to describe him as the
foremost exponent of the Django tradition in Europe today. No small
recommendation. Coincidentally, Laferton's gig is preceded, at 7.30pm at
the Theatre Royal, by Reinhardt's most famous collaborator: his
co-leader of the Hot Club of France, the 87-year-old violin virtuoso,
Stephane Grappelli.
By no coincidence whatsoever, since he crops up in most Scottish jazz
festivals, Grappelli's one-time duetting partner -- guitarist Martin
Taylor -- will be playing at the McEwan's Old Fruitmarket tomorrow at
7.30pm. After his multi-guitar group Spirit of Django last year, he's
back on his own, with support from another guitar man -- Hong Kong's
Eugene Pao.
Other names to listen out for, or at least drop into a few
post-festival conversations, include Joe Locke. This is not the Irish
tenor whose story is told in the film Hear My Song. Rather, this is the
New York-based vibes player whose frenetic, and astonishing,
mallet-yielding made an impact on punters last year. This time he's
playing the McEwan's Old Fruitmarket, at 7.30pm tonight, with his
quartet which includes Scotland's own tenor star, Tommy Smith.
And if you still don't feel that you've done a hard weekend's jazz,
then there are plenty of alternatives to choose from. Like: Phil
Bancroft's Big Shebang (today, Ramshorn Theatre, from 1-3pm); the Robert
Henderson Quintet (today, Ramshorn Theatre, from 4-6pm); the Steve
Hamilton Trio (tonight, Ramshorn Theatre, 7-9pm); the Julian Arguelles
Quartet (tonight, City Cafe Bar at 10pm); Picante (tonight, Caffe Qui,
from 9.30pm -- and a freebie); Gilles Peterson's Strange Fruit (tonight,
McEwan's Old Fruitmarket at 10.30pm); the Mulgrew Miller Trio (tomorrow,
McEwan's Old Fruitmarket at 10.30pm) and the Anthony Kerr and Norma
Winstone Quintet (tomorrow, City Cafe Bar at 10pm).

RICHON is a Swiss born, London-based photographer with his vision
firmly rooted in the realms of classical still life and thought
provoking imitation. The Hunt is an almost comical image/text
photographic series with the precise colour control and balance of a car
advertising campaign, except in this instance the car is replaced by
vegetables, fish heads, grapes, pure velvet and so on.
The clever selling slogan has been dropped in preference of incomplete
segments from Plato's Sophist in which hunting is a repetitive metaphor.
Richon draws inspiration from eighteenth-century Spanish still life
painters such as Juan Sanchez Cotan, who approached painting with a
degree of craft that almost belies the predating of the photographic
medium. Images in which fruit shines forever, and where the severed
limbs of animals appear almost content, lead one to believe that the
image is acceptable destiny.
Richon does not glorify gore though the fashionable temptation is very
immediate. In many respects he views his social function in line with
the merchants who supply his raw material. Layered on to this
ordinariness Plato would disrupt our logical flow -- that's part of the
sheer visual enjoyment and realisation that the individual pictures are
the result of creative consideration.
The Hunt is a beautifully simplistic universal market place where the
feast is staged purely for consumption, firstly by the camera, and
finally by the captive audience. A single light source thrown against a
colourful smokey grey pulls reality firmly to the breast and reminds us
that even well-trapped squids on perfect velvet can have profound
purpose beyond the restriction of day-to-day rhythms.

JOHN Clifford has plumbed withering depths in his adaptation of Emily
Bronte's classic novel, performed here for the first time by Pitlochry
Festival Company. Dramatically it's effectively constructed; short
scenes melding seamlessly together and the action anchored by the
servant Nellie Dean, not as the narrator, but as a near-constant
presence, witnessing almost every scene and commenting on the various
turbulent relationships via wisecracking asides.
Clifford's caustic tone succeeds in ripping the romance out of the
story; his Cathy is a vain, hysterical creature and the ghostly calls
which open the play, presaging the tragedy to come, are more demonic
shrieks than plaintive wails, while Heathcliff is depicted as a brutal,
wife-beating tyrant. Appalling characters, it's impossible to believe in
any spiritual bond between them or care about their fate.
It is an interesting interpretation, eschewing wispy supernaturalism,
but any virtue it might have in being an appropriately blunt and earthy
portrait of the era (early industrial revolution), is diminished by the
heightened humour, a flippancy exacerbated by Clive Perry's direction.
The acting is ridiculously over-the-top and the wigs are simply
ridiculous. The worse the wig the more ridiculous the character. Alec
Heggie sported a ginger ponytail as Dr Kenneth and behaved like a
Dickensian character, reeling drunkenly across the stage, Becky Baxter
looked like Madame Pompadieu as Frances and it was impossible to take
Moray Treadwell as the gentrified Heathcliff seriously as a romantic
lead so preposterous was his sculpted mane.
Kathie Whiteley, as Nellie Dean kept her mop cap on throughout and,
the over abundance of wry gags aside, was the only credible character.

* THE Shaker look in furniture interpreted by many far beyond the US,
has become hugely popular. It epitomises perfectly one of the favourite
styles of the nineties: clean-cut lines, simplicity and practicality.
Widely acknowledged as an American concept, it was in fact in England
that Shaker style began. It looks almost monastic with its straight,
unadorned lines, which is no accident since its roots are strongly
religious.
Shaker was the name bestowed on a Christian group -- the United
Society Of Believers In Christ's Second Appearance -- which left middle
England for America in 1771, effectively hounded out by establishment
disapproval. Because dancing was an important part of their religious
ceremonies, they became known as Shakers.
The original furniture of that name was made by the group's carpenters
for use in their communities, the first of which was set up in the New
York area in 1774. Each piece had to work efficiently and be of
excellent quality.
The Shakers were keen to have a place to put everything, and to keep
everything in its place -- a pretty good philosophy. Along with their
farms, furniture-making and selling became the mainstay of their economy
until modern technology overtook their hand-crafting skills.

PARTICK Thistle manager John Lambie today will apply one of football's
oldest principles; don't pick your team until you see who turns up.
Unfortunately, in his case, this is not the old joke about Friday
night escapades having their effects on the squad, but rather the
realities of freedom of contract.
It is understood that 15 Firhill players went out of contract at
midnight last night, 10 of them first-team candidates and, if all of
them decide to have the day off, Thistle could be asking some of us in
the press-box to don the Adidas or, more accurately perhaps, the
Manfield Hotspurs, to fill the gaps for their Intertoto Cup game with
Keflavik, of Iceland, in Glasgow today.
As far as could be gathered, only one top-team player, Ian Cameron,
had declared his intention to stay at home rather than try to help build
on the club's 2-2 draw with Austrian side Linzer ASK in Linz last
weekend (Cameron was their best player) but Lambie admitted that he has
to wait and see before he can be sure of anything.
''None of them has re-signed at the moment,'' he said, ''and it
depends who turns up before I know what I'll do.
''These players think they are holding a gun to my head but in 31
days' time I will be the one holding the gun.
Lambie's reference to the 31-day period covers the time players
continue to be paid by the club, after which they need to find
employment.
It may not seem the best of ways to go into a European tie but Thistle
have never done things in what is regarded as normal fashion. The club
and the players had a disagreement last week about bonuses, or lack of
them, for this tournament but still managed to recover from a two-goal
deficit to earn a draw.
From all accounts, Keflavik, who were beaten 2-1 by French side Metz,
are no better than the Austrians and, if Thistle can win, they could put
themselves in with a real chance of reaching the last four and the
preliminary round of the UEFA Cup.
* NOTTINGHAM Forest manager Frank Clark yesterday signed Kevin
Campbell and Chris Bart-Williams but the fees for both players will have
to be fixed by an independent tribunal after Clark failed to meet the
asking prices of Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday respectively.
* ASTON Villa manager Brian Little will step up his rebuilding
programme after selling striker Dean Saunders to Turkish side
Galatasaray, who are managed by Graeme Souness, for #1.5m -- with
Leicester midfielder Mark Draper and Crystal Palace defender Chris
Coleman the expected targets.

The experiences of those who were teenagers during the Second World
War were brought to precise and often poetic life in Too Old to Rock and
Roll, Too Young to Die (R4).
Producer Sarah Conkey did a marvellous selection job in her choice of
people who reminisced without sentimentality but with great articulacy.
Being in your teens during that period was described as being in a kind
of limbo, when young people could see what was happening, but without
influence. No interviewer was heard to question: voice simply followed
voice.
The Hotspur world of war heroism led to boys bartering prized pieces
of German aircraft as if they were football cards or conkers. A
delightful story of remembered innocence was told in which a
misunderstood deal was attempted: the teller recounted how proud he was
of some shrapnel and a girl, leading him to the privacy of an air raid
shelter, offered a kiss and possibly more as a swap. The terms were not
realised till later, and the boy, his virginity intact, was still glad
he'd kept his shrapnel.
But the Hotspur view of the war dissolved of course, as it was brought
home to them, in different ways, the reality of what was going on. One
man remembered his total idolatry of a Polish soldier called Zigmund,
who symbolised for his youthful self everything brave and heroic and
manly.
He was appalled when the soldier, sitting in his parents' front room,
wept on hearing his country's national anthem on the radio. Grown men,
much less military men, did not cry, and the boy was shocked and felt
let down until his mother explained that Zigmund had not seen his wife
and sons for years.
Patriotism and jitterbug headlines, combined with that hormonal
bombing called puberty, made for riveting recollections. Without
bitterness but with a dreadful calm sadness, a woman recalled her
father's return. He had not seen her since she was 12 and now she was
17, wearing a trace of make-up, an unrecognisably pretty, strange girl.
On his first night home, after drinking too much, and mother in the
kitchen, he made a pass at her.
A picnic of Tizer and egg sandwiches: a first love making a buttercup
chain, and suddenly overhead, above the ordinary, wonderful idyll,
hundreds of aircraft -- an American bomber fleet -- changing the moment
irrevocably.
A 16-year-old pregnant girl being sent to a remand home for her sin:
an account of a blissful 72-hour honeymoon spent in the bedroom of an
auntie's house. Determined partying while the bombs were falling --
''the dances were wonderful -- suddenly there were uniforms all over the
place''.
Then another 16-year-old, on the day when war with Germany was
declared to be over, is brought ''a little buff envelope'' with news of
her brother's death miles away in the Pacific.
In his piece about Picasso's Guernica, Waldemar Januszczak, finishing
off his Gallery of Perfection series (R4), also dealt with the response
of the young to war. This time it was a group of children taken to see
young Picasso's famous anti-war painting -- and the aptness and
sincerity of their responses made for a fascinating parallel with Too
Young to Die.
The 26ft black and white monumental panorama of war, painted in April
1937, shows no bombs, but distils the terrible conflict. Januszczak,
describing the painting as portraying ''the ultimate bullfight''
observed that, given Picasso's messy domestic and sexual set-up at the
time, the vision was as much about civil war in the family as about
northern Spain.
The ludicrous civil war in the Tory Party family was the subject of
Thursday's The World Tonight (R4). With that terrible repetition of the
ludicrous that seems to be par for the moronic course in politics these
days, the conflict seemingly -- wait for it -- is between the
''sophisticates'' (casa Portillo, zenophobic Redwood et al) and the
''grannies'' (I think that's us). Presenter Robin Lustig was brilliant
talking to his trite commentators -- not least for hearing Sir Teddy
Taylor refer to Major as King Kong without guffawing. I would have
corpsed.

ROMANCE was the order of last night's opening jazz festival concert by
Carol Kidd; possibly the nearest the singer has come to perfection in a
live performance. Not only did she have the backing of her own superb
trio -- David Newton (piano), Dave Green (bass) and Jack Parnell (drums)
-- but her satin-smooth vocals were perfectly complemented by a 25-piece
string band, under the conductorship of Adrian Drover.
The difference the polished arrangements and sumptuous strings made to
Kidd's concert would have to be heard to be believed. For a start it
meant a much-appreciated reduction in the number of raucous,
crowd-pleasers (although she can't let a show go by without at least one
of Al Jolson's grating-est hits), and an even-more appreciated increase
in love songs. Plus a whole batch of new material in her repertoire.
When The World Was Young, a lush and poignant ballad from the pen of
Charles Trenet, benefited from the strings treatment, as did the sexy
Gershwin number which is often overlooked despite recordings by Marilyn
Monroe, Judy Garland and Kidd herself -- Do It Again. The Garland
influence was more explicit than usual, and resulted in a marvellous
medley comprising her two ''rainbow'' hits (I'm Always Chasing . . . and
Over the . . .) and an exhilarating The Trolley Song.
Accompanied by guitarists Nigel Clark and Dominic Ashworth, Kidd
introduced a song which proved to be another highlight of a revelatory
evening. Entitled Broadway Rose, it was an entrancing, folky ballad
written, she informed us after the event, by local singer Tam White. The
rest of the jazz festival has a hard act to follow.

THE Scottish Rugby Union was defeated last night as it attempted to
steer through its proposal for a three-month quarantine on overseas
players becoming eligible for championship games,
The setback came after an 178-11 defeat for the committee's proposal
that overseas players would only become eligible for league games three
months after their arrival in Scotland.
Andy Little, on the committee's banning motion, referred to such
players as ''hired assassins'' who would do nothing to aid home-bred
talent.
Opposition was led by Watsonians -- linked to the All Blacks captain
Sean Fitzpatrick -- with Ian Monteathclaiming that Southern Hemisphere
players who had been at his club had been beneficial to the club. There
was also an existing safeguard in the rule which allowed only two
overseas players per club.
Monteath told the annual meeting at Murrayfield that if he was a
member of a committee which was consistently defeated by its membership,
then he would be concerned that the committee was out of touch with the
membership.
A Cartha Queen's Park and Glasgow Southern motion seeking a 5%
commission on Murrayfield ticket sales by clubs was passed. The SRU had
opposed the motion with a warning that international ticket prices might
rise by #1-a-piece if it was passed.
The SRU also will consider regular cut-price Murrayfield tickets for
youngsters.
The meeting was given details of the distribution of cash to clubs
from the new sponsorship deal. All 102 sides in the premiership and
national league will receive #2000. No club in the cup competition will
be given less than #400, with subsequent increases depending on progress
through to #15,000 for the winners.
It was agreed to remove the discretionary ban on Sunday rugby and to
permit premier and national league sides to play ''friendlies'' in the
fortnight before the start of the official season.
The Union has welcomed a proposal for an International Board run
European league in season 1996/97, but envisages District sides making
up the Scottish representation.

BMW INTERNATIONAL OPEN
SANDY Lyle packed his bags and headed for home yesterday still
seething over his disqualification from the BMW International Open at St
Eurach, near Munich, yesterday.
Lyle's sudden departure from Germany was almost as stunning as the
arrival of Frenchman Marc Farry at the top of the leaderboard, after
having shot a second successive 67.
The big Scot bettered that score, coming in with a 64 -- including an
eagle and six birdies -- for his best round of the season and the best
score so far on the course.
But it all counted for nothing as Lyle was penalised after signing for
a 75 on Thursday when he in fact shot a 76. The mistake came at the
fourteenth when the 4 on his card should have read 5.
The issue was further complicated when tournament director Mike
Stewart revealed that Lyle's card originally showed the higher total,
but then the recorder altered it, as the figures did not add up.
Lyle agreed he was angry at the time and did not check the card
properly -- which had been marked by playing partner Anders Forsbrand --
knowing that ultimately it was his responsibility. He admitted: ''I'm in
the wrong.''
But privately he feels badly done to. Disqualification is a dirty
word, but never more so in Ryder Cup year when you are bidding for a
place in the September showdown with the Americans.
Stewart said: ''There is only so much we can do to check a card. Sandy
shoved it down and left without speaking. We corrected it from 76 to 75,
as that is how his scores added up.''
Lyle's mood was in stark contrast to Farry's. He was allocated a place
in the tournament only at the eleventh hour and is making the most of
this opportunity. A bad back hampered his progress last year and he lost
his card. Now he has slimmed down and the injury has all but
disappeared.
Bernhard Langer battled back to fire a 67 and is handily placed at
140, four under par.
Only two Scots made the halfway cut, rookie Dean Robertson shooting a
70 for 143, and Gary Orr repairing an opening 75 with a 69.
Aberdeen-based Englishman Craig Cassells was on the same score as
Robertson.

AS SPECULATION continued about their bids to bring new faces to
Parkhead, Celtic manager Tommy Burns admitted that the transfer market,
circa 1995, has gone 'crazy'.
Just back from his fortnight's holiday, Burns confessed that the
club's attempts to sign new names had proved frustrating. ''We agreed
two deals with players but both changed their minds at the last moment.
That meant we had to start all over again.''
The chances are he was referring to Ajax's Peter van Vossen, who
seemed likely to join Celtic until he opted for a bonanza deal with a
Turkish club, and Dimitri Radchenko, the Santander player who also
promised to come to Glasgow, but elected at a late stage to join John
Toshack's Deportiva de la Coruna.
The Celtic leader would say nothing about the latest reported target,
Frenchman David Ginola, although it was confirmed from the Continent
yesterday that the Paris St Germain player is almost certainly bound for
Barcelona where Johann Cruyff is poised to sign him as a replacement for
Bulgarian Hristo Stoichkov, who could be moving to Manchester United.
The French club would be happy to see him go to Celtic but the
financial ball nowadays is very much at the feet of the players who make
their own decisions.
At any rate, Burns prefers to stand by his official policy that no
statement will be made about new players until they are officially
signed.
Burns, talking at the launch of a new Celtic video celebrating the
winning of the Tennents Scottish Cup -- 'On the Road Again' -- also
accepts that it is the star turns who call the odds nowadays. ''The
big-time players are definitely the winners now. Quality is so scarce
that there are only a few clubs who can go and get them. Those clubs are
prepared to pay crazy money and the players can only be the winners in
that situation.''
One player who had seemed to have disappeared from Celtic's orbit,
Marc Degryse, has still not moved from Anderlecht, although it is likely
he will go to Paris St Germain.
There has been no movement in possible transfers from Parkhead,
either, although Arsenal are reported to be interested in joining the
race for John Collins, who is not due back from holiday until next
Thursday.

The 21-year-old sauntered out on to Court No.1 waving to the galleries
and wearing a Union Jack bandana. There was not even a hint of
embarrassment given that the ink is hardly dry on his British papers.
The show-court audience loved it when he flashed his wide smile, but
Chris Wilkinson, who lost his third-round match on an outside court, was
ignored. He made the mistake of taking a stand against Rusedski's
adoption, saying the five-week-old Englishman is Canadian and that's all
there is to it.
Wilkinson refuses to play Davis Cup for Britain because of Rusedski's
presence in the team, but support for the player from Southampton ebbed
when the new boy started to beat people up with his huge serve.
Rusedski was born in Quebec, and while Wilkinson has a point, the more
the new hero of British tennis plays, the more it becomes apparent he is
a man who was actually made in Hollywood. He knows how to win over an
audience, not that it is difficult to gain friends at Wimbledon, where
the Brits have been praying for decades for someone to appear and stand
up to the foreign hordes who come here every year and run away with the
goodies.
The bandana, given to him by one of the small-page papers, was hamming
it a bit much, but it turned out to be a winner. It even brought a smile
to the bachelor boy, Sir Cliff Richard, who had taken up his place well
in advance to see the new kid play.
As Rusedski and his opponent, France's Olivier Delaitre, were knocking
up, Rusedski's smile was almost as wide as the court, and even the grin
looks fabricated. It's one of those permanent beams -- the kind which
makes one wonder whether the wearer is laughing at the people, just like
the one Tony Blair has.
During the first change-over of the match a ballboy held a Wimbledon
brolly over Rusedski's head while he sipped his juice, but the ballboy
beside Delaitre couldn't quite get his brolly open. Finally, he mastered
the technique, but by then it was time to get up and play. The
28-year-old Frenchman may have felt then he was playing everyone in
Court No.1 as well as Rusedski, but he refused to show annoyance.
No emotion registered even after some half-hearted cheers had greeted
his double-fault at the start of his first service game, and Delaitre
merely played on, taking the set to the tie-break, which he won.
Rusedski played a decent match, however, and deserved his win, which
gives him a fourth-round match against Pete Sampras, who recovered from
a shaky start to beat Jared Palmer 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-2.
Not long after he had lost the tie-break Rusedski removed the bandana
and tugged on a sponsor's cap. It was time to get serious, time to go to
work, and he took the next two sets 6-4, 6-4.
Like the first, the fourth set went to a tie-break, which Rusedski,
who served 35 aces, won 7-3, and then he started throwing gifts -- wrist
bands -- to the crowd. He left the court waving his Union Jack bandana.
Sampras will have his work cut out to subdue the nation when they all
come together in the next round.
''The crowd reaction was phenomenal,'' said Rusedski. ''I've never had
such backing from fans. I didn't expect adulation like this from British
fans so quickly. I though it would take time for them to warm to me.''
Wilkinson was banished from the tournament by Michael Joyce, who
really was born and brought up in Hollywood and whose trainer, Steve
Bauer, refers to film characters to psyche up his man. Once, when the
match was in danger of running away from the American, he shouted: ''Go
on Balboa, fight.''
Joyce did and won the match 5-7, 6-4, 7-6, 6-4, then saying that a
woman in the Court No.2 crowd had helped him serve out to victory.
''When I was 5-6 and 30-0 in the fourth set, I was going for a lobbed
return and a woman called out: 'Miss it.'
''That made me angry and I channelled that anger. So she helped me
instead of hurting me. However, she is entitled to shout if she wants.''

FORGET fact, this is Frankenfiction. By converting Mary Shelley's
gothic sprawl into a disturbing one-man show, actor Rob Inglis shocks
the tiresomely familiar corpse and illuminates a whole new
interpretation.
The image of one man on a bare stage, screaming out a fantastical tale
of heinous experiments and repulsive results is joined by another. The
same man, faintly ridiculous, draped in a concoction of humps and rags,
begging pity yet cursing God and his maker. A third, a friend of the
first, reads letters and explains all the plot's points.
Why should it remain a fantastical yet true story? A warning to man
not to meddle with certain matters. Could it not be a schizophrenic
raging in a padded cell? The white-streaked backdrop with which a flick
of the lighting switch can form glacial walls, or a lightning-soaked
forest, can it not close as a form of clinical containment? Rob Inglis
does look quite mad, with a face contorted by the horror of his actions.
Or is it the slabs of exposition he has undertaken to animate?
But Inglis's adaptation is much more straightforward, though still
acts as a post-modern springboard. Briskly directed by Duncan Law, it
does however bend and sag under the weight of narrative.
Familiarity is said to breed contempt, yet it is Inglis's passion,
which at times reaches pantomime proportions, that carries this old plot
past weary eyes. At times Inglis is not an actor upon a stage but a man
possessed by the demon he himself has created. In truth, like so many
others.

STEVEN Young equalled the Ballybunion course record on his way to a
stunning victory in the Irish Youths' Open Strokeplay championship
yesterday.
The 18-year-old's four-under-par 67 came in the morning third round,
and when he added a 72 in the afternoon, it set a two-over-par target of
286.
The only player who looked capable of matching the mark set by the
three-times Scottish Boys' champion from Inverallochy was overnight
leader Peter Lawrie, of the Newlands club on the outskirts of Dublin.
The 21-year-old notched a birdie 3 at the seventeenth to need only a par
4 at the last to force a play-off, but he three-putted from 40 feet at
the last. Leading totals:
286 -- S Young (Inverallochy) 72, 75, 67, 72.
287 -- P Lawrie (Newlands) 72, 70, 73, 72.
292 -- B Omelia (Newlands) 75, 68; H Armstrong (Warrenpoint) 71, 68; G
Havret (France) 73, 72; D Coyle (Dundalk) 75, 73.
293 -- R Coughlan (Birr) 74, 73; R Beames (Wick) 74, 71; A Forsyth
(Ralston) 70, 75.
Other Scottish scores: 294 -- D Patrick (Mortonhall) 70, 75. 303 -- C
Heap (East Kilbride) 78, 78.

THE name may not exactly roll off the tongue, although the emcee had
it impressively off pat. But it is apt. Shorthand for ''we've taken in
loads of different musical styles from every country under the sun and
we're gonna play them all for you'', in fact.
From the rain-forest baroque that introduced Esmerelda With the Thin
Legs to the jumping electro-riffing of Too Close to the Flame via a
theme from a Buenos Aires bordello and a Spanish dance or two, this trio
created some magical stuff.
As Small Comotion, saxophonist Andy Sheppard and keyboards player
Steve Lodder formed a duo that was complete, perfect almost. Essentially
what they've done is let Brazilian percussionist Nana Vasconcelos come
between them, almost dominate their music, lead them even.
Few musicians could get away with that but Vasconcelos is the sort of
player who is worth following. He can create a rhythm by merely clearing
his throat into an echo chamber and when he picks up his berimbau -- a
one-stringed fishing pole which he beats with a stick -- he can evoke
anything from a mouse squeak to a small marching band snare-drum corps.
What really hit home here, though, were the dynamics and the way these
three played unselfishly for each other. Sheppard's simple tenor line
behind Lodder's piano really brought out the fire in that solo, an act
that was reciprocated umpteen times. They also did all this with a
smile, toying with the audience -- and each other -- on a series of
false endings that stopped once short of pushing their luck. In short,
serious music but a whole lot of fun.

THE Scottish Lawn Tennis Association has been overwhelmed by the
response to their Centenary Cup competition one-day mixed doubles
tournament to be held at the Craiglockhart Tennis Centre, Edinburgh,
tomorrow.
The event was introduced to help mark the association's 100th
anniversary. All affiliated clubs in Scotland were invited to send one
pair.
With more than 100 couples from as far afield as Aberdeen and Annan
taking part, additional venues at nearby clubs had to be secured to host
the early rounds.
A host of past and present internationalists and county caps are
competing, though the pairings and draw are being kept under wraps.
Tournament convener Sheena Sim said: ''We decided not to reveal any
names for the draw to add excitement on the day. We've been delighted
with the response and if the Centenary Cup is as successful as it
promises, it could become an annual fixture.''

BRENT Deans, Scotland's new director of hockey, must be wondering what
he has got himself into when he reflects on the apathy of clubs at last
Sunday's competitions seminar. Only a few of the 166 clubs affiliated to
the Scottish Hockey Union felt it worth turning up.
Sadly, none of those present included the clubs who should be setting
examples to their colleagues. All the major trophy winners like Grange,
Touche Ross Gordonians, and Menzieshill among the men and the top
women's side Western Klick Photopoint and Edinburgh Ladies were absent.
The fact that Scotland were competing on two fronts on the
international scene will explain the absence of the country's top
players, but that still doesn't excuse the high list of absentees or the
failure of some clubs who elected to send fringe members instead of the
decision making officials.
Deans has given up the good life in Australia as Canberra's executive
director of hockey, and the least the Scottish clubs could do is support
him.
Deans could have his encouragement revived this weekend when the
international committee hold their seminar at which they will be
plotting their programme for the next four years.
Apart from Deans, Billy McPherson, coach of Scottish men's national
side, is also looking for success. His side lost all their three matches
last weekend at Lisburn, Northern Ireland.
The players are back in the training arena this weekend. They now know
exactly the amount of work they have got to do before going to Dublin in
August for the European Nations Cup if they are to make any impression.
Unfortunately, not too many of the players will have to fight for
their places in the 16-strong squad. Again apathy has been such that the
training squad has been eroded to just 19.

Britain's fastest growing,
most competitive international One Design Keelboat class, the 22-foot
three-person Etchells, brings its British championship to the Clyde for
the first time as the Royal Gourock Yacht Club capitalises on their
success last year in running the national championships for the Sonata
Class to host the prestigious event.
Starting on Monday, a fleet of 38 boats are expected to contest the
six-race series, a qualifying event for next year's Etchells World
championships which are to be run off Cowes and should attract the
Etchells top skippers such as America's Cup veterans Denis Conner, John
Bertrand, Colin Beashel, and Britain's match race expert Chris Law.
Denmark's Burnham-based Olympic-medallist Pol Richard Hoj-Jensen will
be competing in these Etchells championships for the first time.
Hopes of a home win rest with Keith Lawrence of the host club.

DAMON Hill faces a serious threat from within his own ranks as he
attempts to get back into World Championship reckoning by winning the
French Grand Prix. Hill knows he will have to halt flying Scot David
Coulthard in his tracks if he is to hang on to the pole position he
provisionally claimed today for tomorrow's race.
The 34-year-old marked a welcome reversal of form for the Williams
team by clocking the fastest time in a closely-fought first qualifying
-- but was just three-hundredths of a second faster than Coulthard.
''Williams have had pole position at Magny Cours for the past four
years and they have all been English drivers -- Nigel Mansell and
myself,'' said Hill.
Coulthard, who had his tonsils removed a fortnight ago, was happy with
second place after failing to finish the last three races, but he
believes one error cost him provisional pole spot.
He said: ''I think I might have pipped Damon. I'm disappointed because
I made a mistake on the last corner on my last set of tyres.
''Perhaps I showed my hand too early,'' added Coulthard who was
holding the fastest time of 1:18.585. ''Damon had to dig deep to go
quicker than me and that's always a psychological advantage.''
Hill -- still concerned by the threat of unreliability from the car
after it failed during free practice -- that the battle has only been
half-won with less than a second separating the top eight drivers.
Times after opening qualifying session:
1, D Hill (Britain) Williams, 1min 18.556sec (average speed
121.728mph); 2, D Coulthard (Britain) Williams, 1-18.585; 3, M
Schumacher (Germany) Benetton, 1-18.893; 4, G Berger (Austria) Ferrari,
1-19.051; 5, J Alesi (France) Ferrari, 1-19.254; 6, M Brundle (Britain)
Ligier, 1-19.384; 7, O Panis (France) Ligier, 1-19.466; 8, J Herbert
(Britain) Benetton, 1-19.555; 9, R Barrichello (Brazil) Jordan,
1-19.763; 10, M Hakkinen (Finland) McLaren, 1-20.218; 11, E Irvine

ANNBANK'S Sarah Gourlay, the winner back in 1991, stayed on course to
recapture the Scottish Women's Singles Championship when she survived
two nail-biting finishes at Ayr Northfield yesterday to reach this
morning's semi-finals.
Gourlay's opponent yesterday morning in the second round was Christine
Perry from St Vincent, who was the beaten finalist two years ago, and
Gourlay scraped through with a 21-20 win.
That put her through to a quarter-final clash in the afternoon against
Leven's Lynn Stein, who had beaten the only other previous winner in the
line-up, Janice Maxwell from Castle Douglas, 21-19 in her second round.
Gourlay added another 21-20 win to set up a semi-final clash this
morning with Caledonian's Evelyn McGarvie, an indoor internationalist
who secured her semi-final spot with a 21-11 win over Sheil Stott from
Newhills.
In the other semi-final, internationalist Nan Stirling, from
Corstorphine, takes on Elgin's Lena McKenzie. Results:

CHRIS Reed, the managing director of Hind, yesterday withdrew his
swimwear company's sponsorship from all Scottish swimming events
following a row over lack of branding at the Scottish age-group
championships at the Scotstoun Pool in Glasgow.
In the first major event at the new 10-lane complex, Reed was furious
that banners were not visible within the pool area when he arrived at
the meet on Thursday.
''I gave the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association 24 hours to sort it
out. But nothing had changed this morning, so I'm pulling Hind out of
sponsorship of all Scottish events,'' he said yesterday. Winners:

THE greatest bike show in the world, the Tour de France, explodes into
action today in the Brittany town of Saint Brieuc, the heartland of
French racing. It makes a welcome return to the area for the first time
since 1988.
La Grand Boucle (the Big Buckle), as the race is adoringly known,
brings a whole nation and half a continent to a halt for three
colourful, dramatic weeks.
This year's Tour, at 3550 kilometres, is the shortest since 1990, but
it's still a marathon test of endurance, stamina, and true grit to
survive the punishing mixture of road racing, time trials, and tackling
the seven mountain stages in the Alps and the Pyrenees.
Twenty-one teams, each with nine riders, representing the best in the
world, will line up for the opening 7.4 kilometre prologue time-trial
stage at Saint Brieuc.
Backing up this huge corps of cyclists will be an army of team cars,
officials, and judges -- plus about 1500 press, radio, and television
journalists.
Favourite for the yellow jersey of race leader and overall winner is
the incredible Miguel Indurain, aged 31, from Spain, who has won the
supreme test of stage racing an unbelievable four times in succession,
equalling the feats of those legends of cycling, Frenchman Jacques
Anquetil and the great Belgian, Eddie Merkcx.
If ''Big Mig'' makes it five in a row he will have set an all-time
record for successive wins, although Anquetil, Merckx, and the Badger --
Frenchman Bernard Hinault -- have been on the winning podium five times
in total.
Indurain is a superb, all-round athlete with an amazing heart-beat and
powers of recovery.
His tactics in the Tour are to hold his own in the opening prologue,
not giving too much away to specialists like Englishman Chris Boardman
-- who sensationally beat the Spaniard by 15 seconds on the opening day
last year -- make headway in the team time trial on the fourth day, then
to take the yellow jersey in the individual time trial.
In this year's race, the individual time trial comes on the undulating
Stage Eight at Huy in Belgium, the day before the riders transfer by
plane from France to Geneva for a rest day before the start of the Alps
climbs. It is from here on in that the big Basque hopes to do the damage
and build up a vital lead, with three tough days in the Pyrenees to
follow. Next, after two fairly flat stages, comes the final time trial
at Lac de Vassiviere, near Limoges, where American Greg Lemond won his
first stage in 1985 and clinched his third Tour victory in 1990.
Indurain appears as cool and composed as ever. ''I'm quite happy to
start as favourite and really, this is just one more Tour for me,'' he
said. ''I've trained for it in the same way as always.''
But the Spaniard may not have it all his own way and anything can
happen in three weeks of racing in the torrid heat. Last year 190 riders
started and only 128 finished.
Swiss ace Tony Rominger ''took ill'' in the Pyrenees, and other top
riders who didn't finish were Frenchman Laurent Jalaberet, Italians
Claudio Chiappucci and Gianni Bugno, and the luckless Belgian Wilfried
Nelissen, who crashed into a gendarme who was trying to take a picture
of the stage finish at Armentieres!
Rominger, 34, who won the three-week Giro D'Italia this year and is
ranked No.1 in the world, is seen by the experts as the main challenger.
He certainly has the pedigree -- winner of the Giro this year, winner of
the Tour of Spain in 1992, 1993, and 1994, runner-up in the Tour de
France in 1993. He looks to have all the right qualities to win . . .
good time-trial rider, excellent climber, and good temperament, plus a
stronger-than-ever team in Mapeit-GB. But still there are doubts when it
comes to the crunch.
''I believe we are going to see a very open Tour de France, with a
tremendous battle for second place,'' he said. ''There's Indurain and
then there's me and the rest.''
Rominger said Indurain's overwhelming dominance in time trials gave
him a virtually impregnable advantage.
''How does he always manage to be on top form for the first Tour time
trial?'' he asked. ''He puts us all under terrible pressure. I am full
of admiration for him, really.
''As I see it, Indurain is riding as well before this Tour as he has
in previous years. He's not in decline, as some people have been saying.
''For me, Indurain remains the big favourite. Don't forget that the
Tour is his only goal. If I don't win, I would like him to. He deserves
to do what no-one has ever done before -- win five Tours in a row.''
Another strong challenger is the supremely-talented Russian, Evgeni
Berzin, whose biggest problem probably is himself. He's very confident,
aggressive, ranked No.4, won the Giro and the one-day classic,
Liege-Bastogne-Liege, last year. But he does not get on with some of the
riders in his team, Gewiss.
His team-mate, Latvian Piotr Ugrumov, who finished second to Indurain,
won two consecutive stages in the Alps and was second in a third, could
raise new peaks again in the mountains. Fellow Russian Pavel Tonkov,
riding for Italian team Lampria, is riding into form, winning the Midi
Libre last week.
Italy's best hope is Marco Plantani, who was second in the Giro and
third in the Tour last year. He is a plucky climber, guaranteed to give
100%.
Other main players are Frenchman Richard Virenque, who briefly raised
home hopes of a win last year with a fighting performance in the Alps,
Alex Zuille of Switzerland, who has yet to reach his potential, and of
course England's wonder time-trial rider, Boardman, who gave British
cycling the kiss of life last year with his first stage win and
performance in the early stages.
Boardman's big problem is climbing, but he has literally risen to the
occasion, finishing second to Indurain in the tough Dauphine Libere and
staying with him on many of the climbs. The question mark is his stamina
and ability to recovery after the daily onslaught. He is not saying much
but hopes to finish in the first five, which is being optimistic.

HENLEY ROYAL REGATTA
ALL four Scottish crews left in this year's regatta went down in
yesterday's racing.
The St Andrew eight were first into action in the Thames Cup and they
gave the seeded London lightweight crew a real run for their money.
After a good start, the Scots trailed by just a quarter-length at the
first signal, but London gradually moved further ahead to beat St
Andrew, who never let up on the pressure, by just under a length at the
line.
Fiona Freckleton, world and Commonwealth bronze medallist, was
outclassed by Sweden's Maria Branden in the women's single sculls. The
Swede holds the Henley course record and is second in this year's World
Cup rankings.
Later, the Castle Semple quad raced well and neatly but could not
match the power of their American national squad opponents from Augusta,
and lost by four lengths.
In the Goblets, Aberdeen's Richard Harris and Drew Hendry went down to
a Queen's Tower pair from Imperial College, who will become today's
sacrificial lambs for Olympic and world champions, Steve Redgrave and
Matthew Pinsent, who continued their untroubled progress. Results
included:
Thames Cup. Third round -- London A beat St Andrew BC 1 length, time
6-24; times of other winners -- Nottingham BC 6-42, Goldie BC 6-26,
Imperial College London 6-35, Univ of Washington (USA) 6-18, Harvard
Univ (USA) 6-31, Univ of London 6-36, A S R Nereus (Holland) 6-22.
Goblets. Second round -- D R Gillard and M J B Kettle (Queens Tower
BC) beat R Harris and D P Hendry (Aberdeen BC) 4[1/2] lengths 7-45;
other winners -- S G Redgrave and M C Pinsent (Leander) 7-46, S B Newton
and M P C Barnett (Cambridge Univ) 7-49, R D T Everington and M B
Partridge (London and Notts) 7-56.
Women's Sculls. First round -- M H Brandin (Sweden) beat F M E
Freckleton (Westminster School) easily, 8-29; other winners -- P J Reid
8-51, S S Laumann (Victoria City, Canada) 8-42, G Batten (Thames) 8-43,
S Springman (Thames Tradesmen) rowed over, J V Harkins (Univ of London
Phoenix Club) 9-05.
Queen Mother. Second round -- Augusta TC (USA) beat Castle Semple, 4
lengths, 6-39; other winners -- Kingston and Molesey BC 6-55, Tideway
Scullers' School B 6-38,  Dinamo Moscow (Russia) 6-45.

THE delight shown by Jonathan Edwards in Lille recently when he became
the first man to triple jump more than 60ft, will be nothing to the joy
he will experience if he can break the world record at the Gateshead
Games at his home track tomorrow.
Edwards was denied the world record by a puff of wind in France -- the
wind gauge reading +2.4 metres per second for his leap of 18.43 metres.
His approach speed is breathtaking, and if he can harness this and the
wind stays down, Willie Banks' 10-year-old world best of 17.97m could
go.
That would do much to make up for the absence of Linford Christie,
Colin Jackson, and John Regis, the three athletes who are holding out
for a better deal on their contracts.
Scottish interest focuses on the 800m, where Tom McKean, apparently
unscathed from his recent injury scare at Meadowbank takes on England's
Matthew Yates.
* TWENTY Scots bid for titles in the AAA Under-20 championships at
Bedford today and tomorrow. The strongest challenge will be in the men's
800m, where Alasdair Donaldson joins forces with Britain's top-ranked
junior Richard Girvan, former world schools champion Andrew Young, and
Des Roach.
* FORMER world 400m silver medallist Grit Breur, banned for failing a
drug test, will make her comeback in Berlin on September 1. Breur, out
of top-class athletics for more than three seasons because of two drugs
scandals, will be free to run again at the end of this month when a
two-year ban imposed by the IAAF ends.
* WORLD record-holder Noureddine Morceli last night ran the fastest
1500 metres in the world this year when he clocked 3min.32.45sec. at the
Goodwill Meeting in St Petersburg, Russia.Sergei Bubka won the pole
vault with, by his standards, a modest 5.70m.

Perseverance paid off when Universal Pulp Packaging went in search of
a mysterious new machine
ONE of the instantly appealing things about Duncan Stewart, who last
featured on this page in October 1993, is this Cambridge-educated
engineer's undisguised, bubbling enthusiasm for the product range his
company makes.
Universal Pulp Packaging at Milton of Campsie turns waste and
discarded newsprint into a green, but highly effective, form of
packaging for a wide range of consumer goods, from pieces of electronic
equipment to DIY tools. The material produced is similar to the
traditional egg carton, making up what it lacks in surface glamour with
highly functional performance.
This Monday the UPP works takes delivery of a new #300,000 machine
from Japan which, Stewart believes, will revolutionise his industry. The
presentation pulp packaging it will produce is still made from the same
raw ingredients. But it represents a quantum leap in the technology,
offering a previously unattainable precision and fit, a smoother surface
finish and unprecedented visual appeal. Green and glamorous, Stewart
thought it ''spectacular'' the first time he saw it.
The machine, which is now clearing customs at Inchinnan, will be in
test production by the middle of the month. Stewart hopes it will be
followed by several more. And, with the first production of its kind in
Europe in-house and an exclusivity agreement with the Japanese supplier
covering the entire UK, UPP is poised to capitalise on its potential and
give a further boost to sales which are already sprinting along, growing
at 25% a year. Stewart sees presentation pulp as the key to another
door, a possible listing by UPP on AIM, the new alternative market,
within three years.
The story of how this deal was done is testament to Stewart's
enthusiasm for his product range and his dogged determination to capture
the moment when it presents itself.
He first saw the new presentation form of pulp packaging in early
1993. Someone had told him about it. To find out for himself he bought a
Sony Walkman, when passing through Birmingham, the better to examine the
inner carton. ''I was absolutely astonished,'' he recalls.
Then began the painstaking process of tracking down the manufacturer.
As it happened, UPP does work for the Sony plant in South Wales. Stewart
tried his contacts there in a bid to identify the supplier, but to no
avail. He also scoured trade directories and other sources and
eventually, later in 1993, narrowed the suspects down to Nippon Hi-pak,
a listed Japanese company, on whom a leading London stockbroker had
written a report.
He decided to make his first trip to Japan and meet the company
face-to-face. It is characteristic of the thoroughness with which UPP's
managing director -- a Harvard MBA as well as a Cambridge engineer --
prepares for the task in hand that he spent six months studying Japanese
culture, including a meeting with former British Shipbuilders' chairman
Sir Graham Day for advice on the best books to read and the pitfalls to
avoid.
As further preparation, Stewart requested literature from Nippon. When
it came there was absolutely no reference to fine precision pulp
moulding. He began to suspect, two weeks before his planned visit, that
he had targeted the wrong company. He went back to his Sony contacts in
Wales and persuaded them to find out, from their sources in Japan, the
true identity of the presentation pulp supplier. The name came back:
Utsui, a family-owned business in Osaka.
Stewart called there and found only one middle-ranking executive who
could speak any English. Through him he got the name of the trading
house which distributed its new pulp packaging equipment. Its senior
executive Teruo Hattori, himself a machinery engineer, had excellent
English.
The trip went ahead. Stewart flew out on a Saturday in March last
year. By the Monday, accompanied by Hattori, he was in Utsui's Osaka
headquarters, talking to the company's chairman. ''I oohed and aahed all
the way through a video presentation,'' he recalls. ''I was just so
impressed by what I was seeing.'' He and Utsui's chairman, a man in his
seventies, simply hit it off. ''My mission in life is to make beautiful
pulp,'' the older man told him. Stewart couldn't have put it better
himself.
Utsui, with just 150 employees, had been a specialist in plastic
packaging but had been urged by Sony to explore greener alternatives. As
sometimes happens, the necomer to a field finds ways of improving
dramatically on existing technology. When the presentation was over,
Utsui's chairman asked: ''Well, Mr Stewart, what do you want?'' ''I
would like to be your partner in Europe,'' was his reply.
Stewart returned to Scotland, fired up by the technology's
possibilities. But the existing machine, at the then sterling-yen
exchange rate, would have cost UPP at least #500,000. In a traditionally
low margin business, that is a very chunky investment. He maintained his
contacts with the Japanese, while he explored ways of raising the
capital.
The UPP site at Milton of Campsie, which he bought into, with backing
from 3i, when it was in receivership in 1981, has considerable
development potential. There are some 20 acres of undeveloped land. He
thought he could raise some money by selling some of the site for
housing. But planning permission was refused and UPP appealed.
He was then advised to drop that appeal on the basis that a revised
development plan would get through. He did. And it didn't. ''I spent the
rest of the year hassling on property issues and keeping in touch with
Japan,'' he says. Stewart took Hattori and the Utsui chairman's senior
son to last year's Open at Muirfield. They saw the winning putt. But
finding the money to do real business was proving difficult.
Then, this February, he got a call from Hattori. One of the UK's
largest packaging companies -- one which had once tried to lure UPP into
a joint venture -- was hot on the trail of the Utsui technology. It was
coming out to Osaka to talk business. ''I've been summoned to Osaka on
Monday for an urgent meeting,'' said Hattori.
It was Thursday. Twenty-four hours later, Stewart returned the call.
''I'm coming out. I'll be with you on Monday.'' ''Excellent,'' said
Hattori.
On the Monday Stewart discovered that Utsui had now developed a
smaller version of its new machine, at half the price. He laid his cards
on the table. ''We are the real European experts in this kind of pulp
technology,'' he told the Utsui executives. ''Provided you give me
exclusivity, I will have a letter of credit for the new machine in your
hands within the month.''
The months of painstaking effort paid off. By the time UPP's much
bigger UK rival reached Osaka, it was to be told: ''Sorry, but we've
already made an agreement with Mr Stewart.'' Back in Scotland, UPP's MD
had one remaining problem, that promised letter of credit.
He went to the Bank of Scotland and pled his case. The deal's logic
was accepted and the letter of credit forthcoming. The machine was
shipped to Southampton and is now about to arrive in Milton of Campsie.
Stewart says that first machine can generate sales of at least
#250,000 a year. He plans to invest in the bigger version next year, and
to keep adding capacity as market demand grows. The first machine will
be financed by a mixture of leasing and debt until the property issue,
currently in abeyance, is resolved.
What of pulp supplies, I wondered. After all, with virgin pulp prices
rocketing worldwide, demand for used newsprint is back on a roll after
years in the doldrums. Stewart, who has a well-developed network of
suppliers from charities and schools to churches and other community
groups, always insisted on paying them a decent rate per tonne, even in
the times when you couldn't give the stuff away. ''We're okay there,''
he says, hinting at another UPP development, still under wraps.
He remains ecstatic about presentation pulp. ''Look at it, it's like
porcelain. It makes the stuff look just beautiful.'' Coming from a man
whom I once watched rooting around the antique shops of Leipzig for
Meissen plates, that is praise indeed.
Stewart, who is 55, readily admits he is not the easiest man in the
world to work for. Even when he is consumed with a big deal, like the
Utsui adventure, he finds it very hard to leave detailed operations at
UPP to others. But he is conscious of the succession and, apart from his
AIM ambitions, is looking to recruit the right production director to
share the load.
On Monday, there will doubtless be more oohs and aahs resounding round
the Campsies, as the wraps are taken off the Utsui kit and a new chapter
begins for UPP.

BRITAIN'S Jo Durie may have waved goodbye to the Wimbledon women's
singles for the last time on Thursday, but the defeat against Jana
Novotna certainly did not end the former British No.1's interest in the
Championships.
Playing alongside Jeremy Bates yesterday, the British pair beat
Russians Andrei Olhovsky and Eugenia Maniokova 6-3, 7-6 in a
mixed-doubles match, but there was not such good news for another
British partnership.
Danny Sapsford and Shirli-Ann Siddall had to bow out of the event
when, tied with Leonardo Lavalle and Dominique Monami at one set all,
the British players had to scratch when Siddall was stretchered off with
breathing problems.
Ambulance staff were summoned to the court and Siddall was stretchered
away with an oxygen bag over her face and taken to the on-site first aid
station, where she was examined by a doctor.
Heat exhaustion was diagnosed and Siddall was given fluids to drink
before being allowed home.
Martina Navratilova, also playing in the mixed doubles, with Jonathan
Stark, reached the next round when they defeated Matt Lucena and Tami
Whitlinger-Jones 6-4, 7-6.

IN common with most tennis players, Gabriela Sabatini harbours the
notion of being the world's No.1 player, but unfortunately for the
sultry Argentinian, ruling the world in sport requires more than a smile
or a pout. To become the best she would need the steely nerve and dogged
determination of Steffi Graf, and these qualities will never be part of
her arsenal.
Sabatini displayed why she has been seeded only eight at the
championships when she stepped out to play with Nancy Feber yesterday
and lost five successive games.
It is precisely this sort of poor concentration, not to mention a weak
serve which is prone to falling apart when she is under pressure, which
undermines her endeavours, and even though she won 13 of the next 14
games to win her match 7-5, 6-1, she is probably living on borrowed time
at Wimbledon.
Having dragged her career out of mediocrity by winning the Virginia
Slims championship in New York last November, she almost fell back down
the mine shaft to nowhere against Feber, who is ranked 101 in the world.
Rarely can Sabatini have played so badly as she did for those opening
five games.
Her service repeatedly misfired and her ground strokes were far too
erratic, but once she broke through to win her first game it was
possible to see the confidence flowing back into her by the way she
started to comport herself in a more dominant manner.
Sabatini, whose only Grand Slam title came at the 1990 US Open,
reached the last eight at the French Open last month but she was
ambushed there and beaten 6-1, 6-0 by Graf, who again showed her what it
takes to go all the way. Graf can drop service games like Pete Sampras
or anyone else, but true champions never allow opponents to open up too
much daylight.
''I just wanted to make the match more exciting,'' she said when she
was back looking her best for the cameras. ''Those five games were kind
of weird. She (Feber) played well and I didn't and then I started to get
out of the mess and she began to make a lot of errors.
''I had never seen her before and I got to know her game a little bit.
There were things I could take advantage of.''
Sabatini said her New York triumph had been vital for her state of
mind, pointing out: ''My results had not been very good and playing
through that tournament gave me a lot of confidence.''
She has been ranked as high as No.3 in the world but is now eighth.
''I'm not obsessed with being No.1 but I would like to be closer to the
top. I think, with my game, my ranking should be higher than it is.
No.1? I would love to be there.'' Ah well, we are all entitled to dream.
In the featured women's match on Centre Court, No.2 seed Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, playing the best grass-court tennis of her life, ended
Zina Garrison Jackson's hopes for another year with a 6-1, 6-2 win.
Regarded as an out-and-out baseliner, the Spaniard looked like a
different player, using an aggressive, all-court game to beat Garrison
Jackson with surprising ease in just more than an hour.
Sanchez Vicario attacked at every opportunity, coming to net whenever
she could and volleying with remarkable skill. Garrison Jackson, who
lost in the 1990 final to Martina Navratilova, was making her thirteenth
and final appearance at the championships.
''This will always be a very special place for me,'' she said. ''I've
always done well here.''
Defending champion Conchita Martinez continued her stroll through the
early rounds by beating Shaun Stafford, 6-1, 6-1, in 51 minutes.
Martinez has lost only 11 games in three matches.
In a later match, No.9 seed Anke Huber beat Chanda Rubin, 6-2, 6-4,
but there was a surprise when No.14 seed Naoko Sawamatsu, of Japan, was
beaten 6-1, 7-6 (7-5) by Holland's to Petra Kamstra.

A GUNMAN who killed a football star after his blunder helped eliminate
Colombia from last year's World Cup was sentenced yesterday to 43 years
in prison.
Humberto Munoz Castro, who was a driver for a businessman, shot
international defender Andres Escobar on July 2, 1994, outside a bar in
Medellin, 155 miles north-west of Bogota.
Days earlier, Escobar accidentally kicked the ball into his own team's
net in a first-round match against the United States, whose 2-1 win
eliminated Colombia from the World Cup.
Escobar was approached on the night of his death by several people who
berated him for his performance.

St Jude Classic
AMERICAN Ryder Cup player Jim Gallagher took advantage of another calm
morning to vault to the lead before play was halted for the day during
the second round at the $1.25m St Jude Memphis Classic here yesterday.
Gallagher started the day three strokes off the pace, but he quickly
overcame the gap with one eagle, seven birdies, and one bogey in 17
holes on the defenceless Southwind TPC course.
He was 14 under par and preparing for a birdie putt on the final green
when play was halted due to an approaching thunderstorm, which
subsequently flooded the course and left it unplayable.
Gallagher, 34, will resume this morning with a one-stroke lead over
fellow American Bob Tway, who also has one hole of his second round
left.
Only 27 players finished the second round before the suspension, and
half the field did not even tee off, including first-round leaders Glen
Day and Mike Standly.
Gallagher, who won his final day singles match against Seve
Ballesteros at the 1993 Ryder Cup, has won four times on the US Tour,
including the Greater Greensboro Open two months ago.
''I've putted really well and made 14 birdies and an eagle in two
days,'' he said.
He is among the large American contingent looking forward to the Open
at St Andrews starting July 20.
Compatriot John Daly, who lives here next to the sixteenth hole, is
not playing his home town tournament due to headaches, but he says he
will be at St Andrews.
''In going through sobriety, people have told me they've had headaches
for a two or three-year period,'' he said. ''They've also said it could
be stress-related or nutrition-related.''
* BRIAN Barnes, the Scottish former Ryder Cup player who turned 50
last month, is three shots off the pace after two rounds of the US
Senior Open at Bethesda, Maryland.
He followed his opening three-under-par 69 with a 72 over the
6945-yard Congressional Country Club course. Tom Weiskopf shot his
second straight 69 and shared the lead with Tommy Aaron on 138.
Bob Murphy, Dave Stockton, and Graham Marsh all shot 70s and were one
stroke back.
On 140 were Hale Irwin, after a 68, and Isao Aoki (70). Lee Trevino
(68) and J C Snead (73) were alongside Barnes, with Jack Nicklaus (71)
and Raymond Floyd (72) a stroke back at 142.

GLASGOW Junior Chamber of Commerce has taken care of the whisky for
the International World Congress, which is being held in the city, but
it still has the beer to worry about, not to mention the soft drinks.
Around 5000 delegates will attend the Junior Chamber International
World Congress in November and Whyte &amp; Mackay has agreed to supply the
chamber's whisky requirements as part of the #350,000 worth of
sponsorship which has already been arranged.
David MacLachlan, sponsorship director of Glasgow Junior Chamber, told
Business Diary that he was confident it would achieve its #500,000
sponsorship target.
''We have received tremendous support from companies such as the Royal
Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland, Scottish Amicable and Whyte &amp;
Mackay, but it is true to say that we are still looking for sponsorship
of beer, wine and soft drinks.''
Anyone who is interested in helping should contact David MacLachlan at
the Junior Chamber World Congress Office on 0141 249 1506.
Tall order will
be plain sailing
ON the other side of the country the Edinburgh Junior Chamber of
Commerce is also being kept busy helping to organise the Tall Ships Race
which visits Leith between July 15 and 18.
Brian Moran, a partner in accountancy firm Whitelaw Wells, is the
capital's junior chamber's director of projects. He has organised 150
volunteers from a variety of sources including yacht clubs, naval
organisations and some of Edinburgh's large employers to act as liaison
officers between the ships.
One of his colleagues in Whitelaw Wells, Sue Jarvie, is rather more
personally involved. She has participated in the Tall Ships Race every
year since 1989 as purser on either the Sir Winston Churchill or Malcolm
Miller which are owned by the Sail Training Association, organiser of
the race.
Burning desire
to cook better
WE hear that Ayrshire Enterprise and Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise
are hoping to launch a ''Taste of Burns'' course in conjunction with the
Scottish Chefs Association.
The idea behind the scheme is that some of Scotland's top chefs pass
on their skills to budding cooks in a bid to improve the culinary
delights of the South-west of Scotland, which is preparing itself for an
influx of visitors for the 200th anniversary of the death of Robert
Burns next year.
The Scottish Chefs Association has more than 200 top chefs among its
members, including such well-known names as Ronnie Clydesdale of
Glasgow's Ubiquitous Chip, David Wilson of the Peat Inn in Fife and Nick
Nairn of Braeval Old Mill near Aberfoyle.
Organiser Brian Hannan, who also runs the Scottish Food Proms event,
believes the association, which was formed only 21 months ago, will have
250 members by the end of the year.
Well qualified to
make small talk
JACK Perry, the new managing partner of Ernst &amp; Young in Glasgow, is a
man of many parts or should we say qualifications.
He first studied microbiology at Glasgow University but decided that
he wanted to go on to bigger things and went to do accountancy at
Strathclyde University.
Perry, who was born in the US, went to work in the Ernst &amp; Young
Dallas office a couple of years after qualifying only to discover that
the Americans were not quite sure about his Scottish qualifications.
Eventually, after he had made his case to an appeals committee, it was
agreed that he could sit the US certified public accountant's exam which
was only 10 days away. Undaunted, he took the exam and passed, and has
held on to dual British and American qualifications ever since.
His original degree in microbiology, he claims, still comes in handy
as Ernst &amp; Young has some biotech clients and he can indulge in
conversations about the latest advances in microbiology.
Sounds like a lot of small talk to me. Perhaps the clients should
focus their attention on bigger things and talk about their accountant's
fees!
Fancy playing
with Player?
FANCY a game of golf with Gary Player? Well for #1250 a team of four
can have at least one hole with him and a full round with other
celebrities such as Gavin Hastings, Stephen Hendry or Hazel Irvine.
The occasion is the Gary Player Charity Classic on the Monarch's
Course, Gleneagles on July 31, and the South African professional will
join each team at the 10th hole.
Proceeds from the day are being divided between the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund in Scotland and the Gary Player Educational Trust which
provides education for 400 underprivileged South African children.
Cancer Research is certainly having a busy summer. Yesterday in
conjunction with the Stagecoach Group it launched its Penny a Passenger
campaign.
For every passenger who travelled on a Stagecoach bus yesterday the
company will donate 1p, and with 6000 buses UK wide and an average of
1,000,000 passengers daily this is expected to mean a #10,000 boost for
the charity's funds.
During July Stagecoach will be involved in a number of other
initiatives aimed at raising more money.

YOU are a head honcho in the Scottish corporate elite. You enjoy the
power and the profile that comes from managing a business with hundreds
if not thousands of employees and a multi-million pound multi-national
turnover.
Naturally life is not relaxing. There's continual pressure from
competitors and demanding shareholders. Your life is not your own and
you have paid a fair price for the wealth and prestige that you have
accumulated in terms, perhaps, of damaged family relationships and
possibly even poorer health prospects.
But still there's that essential buzz, the exhilaration that comes
from doing the deals and taking big decisions, from the never-ending
race from hour to hour and day to day, sustained by such corporate
comforts as PAs and chauffeur driven cars.
Until one day that is. One day when it all goes horribly wrong. One
day when a grave-faced chairman calls you into his office and tells you
bluntly that you are out, fired, sacked, dismissed . . . or as cynical
convention has it, ''resigning to pursue other interests''.
After the lawyers have done their stuff, you have bleakly signed the
requisite papers and banked the cheque, you sit at home and mull
endlessly over what went wrong. Was it really you at fault, or are you
the luckless victim of unstoppable market trends or economic swings?
Indeed, are you carrying the can for the misdeeds of someone even more
powerful?
That's one part of the new equation that has fundamentally changed
your life. The other part involves the natural human instinct to ask:
''What the hell do I do next?''
The headhunters and outplacement specialists say you have no more than
a year, perhaps less, in which to find another top job. Within that time
frame your reputation should stay intact, if a little tarnished
depending on the perceived circumstances of your departure from the last
job. If nothing attractive and credible surfaces within that period then
you run the very real risk of becoming yesterday's man, still a name but
capable only of assembling a portfolio of non-executive directorships in
companies that are not quite top-drawer.
It is, of course, also possible that the terms of the sacking so
damaged your reputation that you will never again hold a senior
position. That realisation usually deals a shattering blow to your
confidence.
Accepting a few non-executive posts to keep your hand in and provide
some income could be a big mistake. Potential employers might take the
message that you do not believe you have what it takes to do it all over
again and pass you by in favour of the inevitably younger, more
thrusting candidates who have miraculously appeared on the scene.
Recently this precise situation has occurred for three top-level
Scottish managers: Sir Ronald Miller and Nick Kuenssberg of Dawson
International and last week Michael Lunn at Whyte &amp; Mackay. Each time
the sackings sent a small seismic wave through the business community,
because they are quite rare.
We do not as a rule hire and fire top managers with the ruthlessness
they do in the South or in the multi-nationals.
So, could there be more to come on the sackings front within our
corporate elite? I suspect this is unlikely. While pressures on top
management continue to grow, I do not believe the Dawson and Whyte &amp;
Mackay dismissals point to a new, more vicious age of boardroom turmoil
within our larger companies.
None of these men is incapable of ever achieving again. They have
invaluable experience of life in the fast lane of international
business, experience that is all too rare in corporate Scotland.
So they deserve another shot in different businesses in different
circumstances. Are we big enough to allow them that -- or do we just
apply the brush of failure and leave their talents to rot?
* Alastair Balfour is managing director of The Insider Group.

LATAHAAB looks set to start favourite for the Northumberland Plate --
the ''Pitman's Derby'' -- at Newcastle on the strength of his last run.
That was a fine performance, but it was in a small field and his
earlier runs were mediocre. Reg Akehurst's other runner, Shadirwan,
looks the better bet. He found a recent race at Ascot just too far a
trip, but turned in a cracking run to finish fourth in a large field
with Lalindi, who was second to Latahaab at Kempton, beaten out of
sight. He ran over today's trip in a race at Thirsk, and won
convincingly.
Those looking for each-way value could try the Flying Phantom, who is
at attractive odds after two runs in which he failed to make the grade
in Group races. Before that he finished third in the Chester Cup and
could run into a place.
Venture Capitalist ran well in the Wokingham Stakes to finish only a
length behind the winner -- with Branston Abby well beaten -- and can
land the Listed race. Six furlongs is his ideal trip and he won over
that distance on his two previous attempts.
Tomorrow, Celtic Swing can silence his critics by taking the Irish
Derby. It has been suggested that he cannot win on the likely fast
going, but since two of his five wins have been achieved on such ground,
this view cannot be sustained.

<HEADLINE>Farm gets all-clear after anthrax scare</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977617038</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SMALL Highland hill farm has been given the all-clear after an
anthrax scare.
Farmer Louis Rose had an anxious four-day wait before tests carried
out on a dead cow gave a negative result. In the meantime, the animal
was burned and the farm disinfected as a precaution, while officials put
a restriction order on the livestock.
Mr Rose called in a vet on Saturday after the adult cow died suddenly
at Ruthven Farm, Tomatin, near Inverness, where he keeps 30 cattle.
After carrying out tests the vet notified the Department of
Agriculture and Fisheries whose veterinary officer John Mackenzie was
unable to rule out the highly infectious disease.
However, the tests were confirmed as negative after they were
inspected by government laboratories in Surrey.
Mr Rose said yesterday: ''It was a great relief when we heard the
results. The officials were very compassionate and obviously took the
necessary precautions to prevent any risk.''
Mr Mackenzie said: ''Because it was an unexplained death it had to be
notified and the vet called me in for a second opinion. There are many
bugs which look similar to anthrax and initially I was unable to rule it
out and so we had to proceed as though it was anthrax.''
Mr Mackenzie said Highland Health Board's consultant in public health
medicine was informed, but said there was no risk to humans.
The scare was the first in the Highlands since an anthrax outbreak was
confirmed at a farm at Ardgay in Sutherland two years ago.
A Scottish Office Agriculture Department spokeswoman said anthrax is
rare in the UK with only around two or three cases reported a year.
* TRIALS by the Scottish Agricultural College have shown that low
dosages of herbicides or fungicides can be more cost-effective than the
full doses of poorer products.
More than 60 trials were carried out, funded by the Home-Grown Cereals
Authority, to define when northern cereal growers can successfully use
low doses of pesticides. Sequential low doses gave most reliable weed
control in winter cereals.

ANYONE crossing the Clyde bridges in the centre of Glasgow this
afternoon could be forgiven for thinking the river had been turned into
one giant duck pond. For riding along on the crest of the waves will be
2000 little ducks -- plastic ones that is.
They will be participating in The Great Duck Race in aid of the
Hospital Broadcasting Service from the Albert Bridge to the suspension
bridge at Carlton Place.
The race is being sponsored by Donprint International of East Kilbride
and Barr's Irn-Bru, which perhaps explains the third prize of a year's
supply of Scotland's other national drink.
The money raised will be used to buy new records and equipment for the
broadcasting service which entertains the patients of hospitals such as
the Western Infirmary in Glasgow and the Royal Alexandra Hospital in
Paisley.
Starting time for the race is 4.30pm when the ducks will be tipped
into the Clyde from the east side of the Albert Bridge.

<HEADLINE>MPs press Minister to act on OP sheep dips</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>

LIBERAL-DEMOCRAT agriculture spokesman Paul Tyler has claimed a major
breakthrough in raising Government awareness of the dangers of
organophosphate (OP) sheep dips.
Mr Tyler led an all-party group which met Agriculture Minister Angela
Browning to present new evidence showing that the protective clothing
recommended by the Government is ineffective and that long-term chronic
illness can result from repeated low-level exposure. They also argued
that the training and certification scheme for handlers of OPs has
proved a disastous failure.
Mr Tyler said the Minister had agreed to meet her opposite number at
the Department of Health to discuss the implications allied to the use
of OP dips and the increased average suicide rate among farmers in areas
which used the dips.
In particular, he said, the Minister would press for more effective
training for general medical practitioners so they could be more alert
to the symptoms of exposure to OP dips and the support which could be
given to farmers.
There were real doubts about the effectiveness of protective clothing,
highlighted by recent studies carried out at the Institute of
Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh, he added. It appears that protective
clothing is only of marginal benefit in reducing the impact -- at least
to some of those handling dips.
Many farmers still claim that the dips are the most economic and
effective way of protecting sheep against scab and parasites, but Mr
Tyler said the point was being reached where the economic argument was
no longer tenable.
There were alternative non-OP treatments, he said. They were not cheap
but he suggested the Government should cut its losses and invest money
in helping sheep farmers obtain reasonable quantities of the new
treatments at a reduced price until such time as economies of scale
resulted in lower unit costs.
John Scott, president of the Ayr area executive of the National
Farmers' Union of Scotland, has expressed concern at reports from
Caithness that scab may be developing resistance to one non-OP dip. ''It
is a very sobering thought,'' he said.
The latest figures suggested that about 8000 people had qualified for
the dipping certificate in the UK -- compared to 90,000 registered wool
producers. ''There are other ways of treating scab, or it could be that
contract dippers are doing the work, but that figure is not a huge
uptake.''
While the incidence of sheep scab detected at markets is said to be
dropping, the number of instances on farms has been increasing. Mr Scott
reminded farmers that prosecutions for not treating scab could lead to
penalties as high as #5000 per animal. It was not an offence to have
scab but it was one not to treat it.
* A NEW, strengthened, non-OP dip -- Robust Dip from Young's Animal
Health -- claims to control scab and blowfly strike as well as ticks and
lice, making it the first synthetic pyrethroid dip formulation to cover
all these parasites.

APART from the distant sounds of maintenance work being carried out
around the vast arena, Soldier Field is quiet this summer. Right now the
home of the Bears is not even the focal point of sport in Chicago, let
alone the rest of the world, and the story is the same in other American
cities, unlike 12 months ago, when the air was charged with excitement.
Remember those days? Remember the colour and emotion which brought
Giants Stadium to life when the Irish and Italian football fans flooded
in to spread the word of the one, truly universal game?
Giants Stadium in New Jersey's Meadowlands also is empty now and, at
the other end of America's vast expanse, the Rose Bowl in Pasadena isn't
shuddering to the football beat. Around Stanford Stadium there are no
Brazilians doing their rhythmic thing. The samba drums have gone.
One year after the most successful World Cup ever, the echoes of
something special are not even faint, they are non-existent; and so,
too, is the legacy which we were told would be left behind when the
world's best sides and their fans packed up and turned their travelling
circus towards France '98. Soccer again is a minor sport in Uncle Sam's
backyard.
''It seems like soccer has disappeared again,'' said Tab Ramos, who
played in the US national side last year. ''It's just like it was before
the World Cup and I think we have lost momentum. In fact, there's no
doubt about that.''
There was bold and ambitious talk of a professional league, which
would be sponsored and funded by big business as well as money from
World Cup USA profits, which hit record levels. Financially, the last
World Cup was an immense success, but it has to be said that the
organisers of this extravaganza have been found to be morally bankrupt.
They are nowhere close to meeting their much-publicised commitments to
the future of soccer in America. They have lost the supporters who
flocked to the grounds, and the goodwill generated by the appearance by
many of the world's best players has been allowed to ebb away.
First, there was talk of a major professional league within a year of
the finals and now the target is next year. The organisers continue to
talk and bristle with indignation when it is suggested they are full of
bull, but the reality is there is no league structure.
Also, few sponsors have been attracted to help finance the national
squad, which was lauded as heroic during the finals, and television
ratings -- the few times soccer is even on the screen -- are dismal. The
US Soccer Federation, with a budget of $12m this year, is expected to
lose nearly $2m.
Compare that with the financial impact the 1984 Olympics in Los
Angeles had on amateur sports in the States and you discover how much
the soccer authorities have failed to deliver. The windfall from the
Olympics -- and the manner in which it was dispersed -- helped dozens of
sports, whereas soccer continues to be a poor and minor activity.
Only at grass-roots level is soccer healthy, and the greatest crime of
all is that no-one seems able to build on what is still a solid
foundation. ''Soccer is there. You can feel it,'' says US and Derby
County midfield player John Harkes, who is one of the few Americans to
make a mark overseas.
''It's an untapped thing. There are so many kids who want to play. We
all just want to play.''
It was a plaintive cry and one which Harkes knows will be blown on the
wind. No-one will listen and the children will meet with frustration
when they try to take their careers a step forward. Without a home
league into which they might graduate, there is nothing for them, yet it
was supposed to be so very different.
The Americans can't even say nobody warned them because many people
warned that the finals seemed to be nothing more than a profit-making
exercise and not for the benefit of the game. There were Colgate smiles,
sharp dressers, and smooth talkers by the dozen, but there was a
shortage of genuine football people.
Major League Soccer, developed by Alan Rothenberg, the mastermind of
World Cup USA '94 and the United States Soccer Federation president, has
been plagued by start-up woes, but the delays have killed any carry-over
from the finals. ''It would have been a folly to rush in and try to
start up a new league,'' Rothenberg insists. ''It is important people
understand we are trying to build a league which would have permanence,
and the foundation is a vital part.''
You know, it beats me why anyone should still want to listen to the
Rothenbergs of American soccer. They didn't do badly out of the big
show, but the sport has not progressed as quickly as it should have.
Indeed, MLS already is having difficulty attracting the top US
players, who can earn more money and international acclaim in Europe.
The 10 teams -- Dallas; Denver; Kansas City; Los Angeles; San Jose;
Boston; Columbus; New York-New Jersey; Tampa Bay; and Washington -- have
only a limited amount of finance and not enough to keep the best players
happy.
Even if there were, it is unlikely that by the time MLS kicks off, if
ever, the American public will still remember Alexi Lalas -- who has had
a successful year in Italy with Genoa -- Cobi Jones, Tony Meola, and
Ramos.
''I am disappointed that after the World Cup, we didn't have a league
right away to continue this enthusiasm that was experienced after the
Cup,'' says Steve Sampson, who has taken over on an interim basis as
national coach from Bora Milutinovic. The Yugoslavian, who was given
hero status during the finals, says he was fired, but the USSF say he
resigned.
''If you're going to have a professional league in the United States,
like we had back with the NASL (North American Soccer League), you have
to do it right,'' Harkes says. ''But there is a time gap there to fill,
and it's very difficult.''
The USSF had anticipated a 50% decrease in interest right after the
finals, but the public have been turning off much quicker than anyone
had imagined. The problem was they were given nothing to keep their
interest levels high and in a society which reacts to hype and
competition, this inactivity -- the sound of silence from the soccer
fields -- was fatal.
Ridiculous as it may sound, there is talk of America bidding to host
the finals in the years 2010 and, while the mandarins of FIFA would
relish the opportunity to return and make more millions, the Americans
should be told now they have no chance of getting the finals of the
world's greatest sport. In plain language, they should be told they will
never host the finals until they can prove they mean what they say in
terms of a major league set-up.
The legacy these people promised the game is a hollow one and they
should not be rewarded for that. Football has already made some people
in America rich and it would be a crime if FIFA were to make the same
mistake twice.
In plain language, they should be told they will never host the finals
until they can prove they mean what they say in terms of a major league
set-up.

THE news that two of the major supermarket groups in the country --
Sainsbury and Safeway -- are going to sell only farm-assured beef and
lamb from the beginning of next year has introduced some urgency into
the re-vamped assurance scheme, members of Ayr area executive of the
National Farmers' Union of Scotland were told by Howard McIver. Mr
McIver, from Tarbolton, will be a local assessor for the scheme.
Some concern was expressed that stores might revert to sourcing
supplies from abroad if the price of home-produced meat went up but this
was discounted by Sandy Fergusson who said such a move would be more
than their reputation was worth.''
''Surely, after Brent Spar, public reaction cannot be taken for
granted,'' he said, referring to the recent controversy over disposal of
the oil platform.
He was supported by area president John Scott who said the Brent Spar
outcome was an indication of things to come. The power of single-issue
action groups was going to get stronger. ''If the housewife wants
farm-assured product it is up to us to provide it,'' he said.
Mr McIver assured farmers that there was nothing in the re-vamped
scheme -- now under the wing of the Scotch Quality Beef and Lamb
Association -- which should worry them, if they knew their job. His own
role as an assessor would be to ensure that farmers coming into the
scheme were able to look after stock in the appropriate way.
''Until now most of us have regarded the scheme as a necessary evil
but by this time next year I hope all livestock producers in this area
will be proud to be members,'' he said.
The NFUS livestock committee has set up a strategy group, under the
chairmanship of livestock convener Stewart Whiteford, to consider future
options for the beef and sheep sectors. Other members of the committee
include animal welfare convener, George Lyon and Ayr executive president
John Scott, the union's hill farming convener.
The group would act as a think-tank on future policy in the light of
the current review of the beef regime, said Mr Scott. It would bring in
outside specialists as necessary.

SCOTTISH banks appear to have been resting on their laurels recently,
while leading building societies and some of the English banks have been
increasing the competitiveness of their current accounts. Anxious to
increase its share of the market, Abbey National, for example, has
recently relaunched its low-cost account and increased the interest it
pays on credit balances. Barclays has cut its overdraft fee by half.
Some Scottish customers are sitting pretty, it is true. If you have a
Bank of Scotland ChequePlus account, don't keep a large balance in it
and never overdraw by more than #100, you could hardly do better. But if
you are a Clydesdale Flexicash account holder who sometimes goes
overdrawn by more than #100 or a TSB customer who slips into the red by
just a few pounds, you should seriously consider switching accounts. It
could save you a great deal in bank charges.
So what are Scottish customers being offered by their banks and how do
they shape up against the competition?
Bank of Scotland has two accounts, an old style current, which levies
transaction charges even if you are in credit, and its much more
attractive interest-bearing ChequePlus account. Besides providing a free
#100 overdraft facility, ChequePlus is currently paying 1.01% net on
balances below #500, one of the highest rates of interest for an account
of this type.
If you overdraw by more than #100, you are charged #8.50 per month on
top of interest charges of 18.75% for an authorised overdraft, or 26.75%
if it is not. If you didn't ask in advance you will also be charged #15
for a warning letter. In the last Which? survey of bank charges, Bank of
Scotland came out as the most expensive for unauthorised overdrafts.
Current account holders should consider switching to ChequePlus if
they never overdraw by more than #100 or, if they do, to Abbey National
or one of the building societies which charge low rates on overdrafts.
ChequePlus holders with large balances would be better off in a building
society current account, such as the Woolwich, which pays a higher rate
of interest.
Clydesdale has two current accounts but says most customers opt for
its interest-bearing Flexicash account which offers a free #100
overdraft buffer. Anyone who goes over that is clobbered for charges
even if the overdraft has been agreed in advance. In the Which? survey,
Clydesdale was found to be most expensive for agreed overdrafts. There
is a quarterly fee of #30 when authorised overdrafts occur, plus
interest of 22.7%. Unauthorised the fee rises to #40, while interest
increases to a massive 33.5% and you will also be charged #10 for a
warning letter.
Flexicash account holders who overdraw by more than #100 should
consider moving to Abbey National or one of the building societies which
charge low rates on overdrafts. If you keep a large balance in your
account, you will get more interest in a building society account such
as that offered by the Woolwich.
Royal Bank of Scotland has an ordinary current account and an interest
paying one. The latter has a free #100 overdraft buffer but the rates
are not very attractive. A basic 0.56% is paid on balances of up to
#1000, 0.75% on #1000 plus, rising to 0.94% on #5000 and over. A monthly
fee of #10 comes into effect for overdrafts of more than #100. If
authorised, interest of 19.5% is charged, while an unauthorised one
incurs interest at 29.8%. There is no charge for the first warning
letter if you overdraw without permission.
Customers who maintain a modest balance and never overdraw by more
than #100 would currently get a better deal from the Bank of Scotland's
ChequePlus account. Those with larger balances or higher overdraft
requirements should compare what Abbey National and the building
societies have to offer.
TSB offers an interest-bearing current account only. The rate is
modest, just 0.38% net on balances of up to #5000. There is no free
overdraft buffer. When any overdraft occurs, your account immediately
incurs a #6 monthly fee. If unauthorised there is an extra charge of #3
a day! The interest on authorised overdrafts is 18.8%, while on
unauthorised it is 29.8%. There is no charge for the warning letter.
Customers could do better elsewhere, either with a Bank of Scotland
ChequePlus or an Abbey National or building society current account.
The competition for traditional banks is coming mainly from Abbey
National, now also a bank, and the building societies which offer
current accounts. Abbey National is very attractive for customers who
want an agreed overdraft facility of more than #100 -- it charges no
monthly fee and interest is only 9.9%. Interest on credit balances
starts at 0.38% net, rising to 0.75% on #500 and more on larger amounts.
The Woolwich, though, is the most generous with the interest it pays
on credit balances. It is currently offering a basic 0.98% net rising to
2.78% on balances of #500 to #10,000 and more on larger amounts. It
charges 9.5% for authorised overdrafts, and there is no monthly fee.
Both the Abbey and the Woolwich levy 29.5% interest on unauthorised
overdrafts and the Abbey also has a #12 fee.
Other societies with current accounts include the Alliance &amp;
Leicester, Halifax, Nationwide and Northern Rock. Many offer information
packs to assist you if you want to switch your accounts.

IF anyone thought the UK stock market had adjusted to take account of
the various political uncertainties which have been clear to see for
months, they were sharply disabused the moment it opened on Monday, when
the extent of its reaction to Mr Major's bombshell became apparent.
A visitor from Mars might have thought the hundreds of millions of
pounds wiped off the valuation of British industry was a tribute to him.
Not so. It was simply the market displaying once again its distaste for
uncertainty.
Nothing goes down for ever but that sharp shock might have persuaded
investors who had not yet done so to contemplate putting some part of
their funds overseas. After all, we will have a general election and
another dose of uncertainty within a maximum of less than two years.
Mainland Europe has been attracting the attention of a growing number
of fund managers recently. France has been taking quite a jump up the
popularity polls with the two previous front runners Italy and Germany
falling behind.
Germany has managed to be both rewarding and disappointing in recent
years. Back in 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down and the country was
reunified it looked as though Europe's strongest economy was going to
get another boost. Optimistic assessments were made of the benefits
which access to the East German labourforce would bring to the much more
modern West German economy. For various reasons it did not work out like
that.
More recently hopes for Germany have again had to be cooled down. The
Bundesbank's June report warned that economic growth would slow this
year. Higher than expected pay increases and the strength of the mark
were blamed.
Nothing in particular says this is the time to buy Germany, but if you
are looking for a market which is pretty solid and dependable despite
not being greatly exciting just now, this could be it. And if you do
fancy putting a part of your portfolio into Germany, maybe to balance a
punt on emerging markets, you could do worse than tag along with Josef
Schop, the German shares expert at Foreign &amp; Colonial who picks
companies for the group's specialist German Investment Trust.
He says: ''1993 was the low point. Last year saw strong increases and
these continued into the first half of this year which was very strong.
Now, because of the currency and the wage settlements the situation is
difficult to assess. Three months ago we expected earnings growth of 20%
in 1996. Now there is a question mark. We still expect growth next year
but forecasts have been reduced to 10%.''
Mr Schop says he expects a gradual recovery for the dollar and a
weakening of the mark, in which case the outlook for German exporters
would be favourable. He adds: ''We also do not see the US going into
recession. This is a key feature when you look at the German market. The
economy is strongly dependent on world demand for capital goods. The US
in recession would be very negative for German exports.''
Two-thirds of the trust's investments are in large companies with the
rest in smaller to medium-sized ones. Where the large companies are
concerned, stock picking is relatively easy once you have decided which
sector of the economy you want to be in. Getting the small ones right is
more difficult but also likely to be more rewarding.
Mr Schop visits Germany on average once every three weeks. ''We do our
own research on smaller companies,'' he says. ''That is why I go so
often. I try to stay in touch with the companies and know the management
and the business.'' The larger companies he sees ''at least once a
year''.
Germany still has a high savings ratio even though not as high as it
has been, but traditionally the Germans have favoured bonds and similar
investments, not taking much risk with Ordinary shares. This is
gradually changing and he sees the German investor following the pattern
of the US and UK and getting more involved with the share market. The
banks, traditional main source of finance for German companies, are
reckoned to be reluctant shareholders nowadays although there could be
some very large capital gains tax bills if they got round to selling on
any scale.
The interest of private investors could get a useful boost next year
with the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, just as the privatisation of
British Telecom brought in a whole lot of investors new to the UK stock
market. One share Mr Schop likes is Mannesman which has an important
stake in the cellular telephone market in addition to engineering
interests.
He forsees a gradual long-term shift towards more private
shareholders, although he admits: ''In the past people have tended to
buy at the top and not see their money back for a couple of years. It
was not too encouraging.'' He does, however, expect companies to become
more shareholder friendly. ''More and more are seeing the need for this
in order to compete for capital.''
That scenario suggests dividends are likely to increase so long as the
profits are there. The currency position is important. ''If the mark
goes down it should be good for German company profits,'' he says. ''For
someone investing in sterling there will be a negative impact, but I am
pretty sure that will be over-compensated by movement in the stock
market. If the mark goes down the market should go up.''
In the meantime the trust's shares stand on a discount of around 15%.
An alternative route into the country might be the German Smaller
Companies Investment Trust, where the discount is broadly similar. This
trust is thought likely to make a free issue of warrants later this
year.

THE board of Scottish Pride, which has been the target of criticism
from a group of dissident shareholders, has won the backing of the
National Farmers' Union of Scotland, writes ROBERT ROSS.
After a specially convened meeting of their milk committee yesterday
the union issued a statement advising shareholders to vote against the
five critical resolutions submitted by the shareholders' group for
consideration at the company's annual general meeting on July 28.
Jim Hosea, chief executive of Scottish Pride, accepted an invitation
to attend yesterday's meeting but the shareholders' association
representatives declined.
The association's complaints have centred on fears for the future of
Scottish Pride's creamery businesses and difficulties in buying shares
on the matched bargain basis in which they are traded. Directors
admitted last week that on one occasion a prospective purchaser had been
refused when, in fact, shares were available.
Checks had shown that this was due to human error by a member of the
stockbrokers' staff. The prosepctive purchaser had since been allocated
shares at the price applying at the time of the request.
The company's critics also complained that some of the directors had
increased their shareholding at a time when farmer-shareholders
experienced difficulty in buying shares. Stockbroker Allied Provincial
Parsons Penney has since issued a statement that directors' orders were
only completed after all other buying instructions had been fulfilled.
John Ross, president of the NFUS, who attended yesterday's meeting,
said that the union had received a number of complaints about the
share-dealing system and had, on several occasions, told the company
that these failings must be put right.
Michael McCreath, secretary of the shareholders' association, said
that the union milk committee was not representative of of Scottish
Pride shareholders. A number of people on the committee did not own
shares.

Moving house can be an expensive business, particularly if you omit to
tell banks, building societies and other organisations your new address.
MOVING house can damage your wealth. Not just because of all the
expensive bills associated with it, but because you may forget to pass
on details of your new address to financial organisations that need to
know.
While we may be capable of telling our friends and relatives that
we've moved, many of us inexplicably forget about informing banks,
building societies, insurance companies, National Savings and even the
registrars of companies where we own shares.
It is easy for the first-time shareholder who has acquired shares
through privatisation issues to forget about passing on change of
address details, but they are not the only forgetful ones -- missing
shareholders account for millions of pounds of unclaimed dividends. The
TSB has nearly #3.5m worth of dividends waiting to be claimed, while the
figure at British Gas is thought to be nearer #6m.
The money doesn't disappear, of course. It is always there waiting to
be collected by its rightful owners and, in the case of savings
accounts, will continue to earn interest.
But failing to pass on your address does mean that as a saver or
investor you could miss out on important information about your
investments. For example, without an annual interest statement you
cannot reclaim tax you may have overpaid on your savings income. You
could also lose out on the cash windfalls or free shares that have
become part and parcel of privatisations and building society takeovers.
One elderly Herald reader has been told she will not qualify for her
share of the #1800m worth of bonus payments due to be paid to investors
with the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society when it is taken over
by Lloyds Bank. Then eligible C&amp;G savers can look forward to a flat
payment of #500 plus an expected 13% of the balance in their account at
certain dates. The average payout is expected to be around #2000.
She explains: ''I opened an account with C&amp;G in 1984. The money was my
nest egg and only to be used in dire circumstances, so I didn't touch it
at all. I have discovered though that my account was cancelled by C&amp;G on
December 22, 1992 because it had been inactive for several years. Now
they refuse to reinstate me and I won't qualify for the takeover bonus.
Can they do this?''
At the root of the problem is the fact that, by her own admission, she
did not tell C&amp;G that she had moved house even though, as she says, the
money was very important to her and is her nest egg.
''There's a limit to what we can do if people don't bother to inform
us when they move house,'' says a C&amp;G spokesperson. ''It gets to the
stage where we really cannot do more for these savers without incurring
extra expenses which affects our other members. We regularly send out
information to savers -- interest statements and mailings about the
annual general meeting are just two letters that have to go out each
year.
''If we have mail returned marked 'gone away' and an account with more
than #100 in it hasn't been used for five years then that account
becomes dormant. Interest is still payable and your reader can have her
money back at any time. But when her account became dormant she was no
longer classed as a member of the C&amp;G so won't now qualify for the bonus
payments.''
C&amp;G is due to make the payments to savers who have held a qualifying
account continuously since December 31, 1992. Although our reader opened
her account in 1984, it was made dormant just before Christmas in 1992.
She ceased to have any membership rights at that point so won't qualify
for the bonus.
While C&amp;G is sticking firmly to the rule book, other societies may be
more lenient when it comes to forgetful savers. ''If we cannot trace
savers and there are no movements in and out of an account, it's simply
shifted into a different section of our computer files,'' says a
spokesperson for the Halifax.
''Then, if there are any enquiries or transactions on the account, the
computer alerts us to ask for the saver's current address. Savers don't
lose their membership rights and they wouldn't miss the chance of the
free shares we expect to issue when we go public in two years time. But,
of course, it's vital that savers do keep us informed of any change of
address so that we can keep them up to date with our plans and give them
the chance to vote on the changes.''
The Halifax and the Leeds Permanent are due to merge in August and
then plan for a public flotation of their shares, probably during 1997.
Rumours are rife in the building society world of more takeovers and
mergers, so it is crucial that savers make sure they'll get news of any
developments. Past experience, though, does not augur well for the
future. When Abbey National converted to plc status in July 1989, a
staggering 29 million of the free shares it allocated to savers and
borrowers went unclaimed.
Those due for them were share account savers who had at least #100 in
their accounts on December 31, 1988 -- deposit account holders were not
eligible. Abbey National borrowers with outstanding mortgage balances
also qualified, making a double allocation for those who were both
savers and borrowers.
If you think you may be eligible contact a branch of Abbey National
and ask to complete a special claim form.

LONDON Electricity completed the regional electricity company's (REC)
reporting season with a 15.2% increase in pre-tax profit to #214.9m,
before exceptional charges.
After taking into account exceptional costs relating to the redemption
of government bonds which were due to be repaid in 1999, profits were
down 8% to #172.4m. The full-year payment to shareholders is 29p, an
increase of 29% after a final dividend of 19.5p.
Customers have benefited from a 16% reduction in prices in real terms
since 1991, worth #50 a year for the average residential customer.
The company said it welcomed the Government's intention to abolish the
fossil fuel levy in respect of nuclear power from 1996. This would mean
a saving of about #25 per annum for the average residential customer.
London has the best customer service records of all the RECs with no
residential disconnections since January 1994, the lowest level of
complaints to OFFER, the industry watchdog and the best performance
against guaranteed service levels for the third successive year.
Along with other RECs, at its annual general meeting on August 4,
London intends to ask its shareholders for authority to buy back up to
10% of its share capital. Last year it spent #150.4m buying back 10% of
its shares.
In addition, following the expiry of the Government's golden share in
March, the board will also be asking shareholders to approve the removal
of the 15% ceiling on individual shareholdings.
In the distribution business units were just 0.4% higher as a result
of the mild winter but profitability was helped by a 4.6% reduction in
operating costs.
The company has a three-year #52m electricity distribution project to
replace its network in South-west London. Last year, it spent #18m on
building a 10km cable tunnel, which runs under the Thames. Capital
expenditure is expected to be around #110m a year.
Elsewhere in the group, the joint venture with TOTAL Gas Marketing is
said to be maintaining a profitable position in a highly-competitive
marketplace. The electrical contracting business is showing the benefits
of its restructuring three years ago with an increased profit
contribution during the year.
London expects a growing contribution from its airports electricity
network, which it bought to years ago. A #20m, three-year investment
programme is under way, which includes #10m to enhance Heathrow
Airport's electricity network.
The results were in line with City expectations but the shares dropped
a penny to 642p where they yield 5.6%. London Electricity is among the
sector recommendations of broker Smith New Court. However, uncertainty
continues to surround the electricity sector ahead of publication later
this month of the latest regulatory review by the industry's regulator,
Professor Stephen Littlechild.
The new distribution price review is expected to reduce the likelihood
of mergers between RECs. Southern Electric is known to be interested in
merging with London Electricity but the company's fear is that any cost
savings arising from a merger would be clawed back by the regulator.

CONSTRUCTION company Mowlem Scotland yesterday announced the #2m
acquisition of Scottish Homes' building division -- a move which gives
it access to the #1300m repairs and maintenance market north of the
Border.
This market, split equally between the public and private sectors, is
the same size as the one for new construction work in which Mowlem
Scotland currently operates.
The takeover secures the jobs of the Livingston-based building
division's 500 employees and makes Mowlem Scotland one of the biggest
employers on the Scottish construction scene.
Until now, the building division, whose four-year order book is
included in the purchase price, has been restricted to the public
sector.
It has been in decline, with more and more of Scottish Homes' houses
sold to tenants or transferred to alternative landlords.
In 1989, when it passed from the Scottish Special Housing Association
to Scottish Homes, which was formed by the merger of SSHA and the
Housing Corporation in Scotland, the building division employed 1000
people.
Mowlem Scotland, which currently employs 140 management and technical
staff and between 50 and 60 operatives, described the acquisition as a
complementary development of its core contracting business which would
better enable it to offer a total service to clients.
Based in Kilsyth, near Glasgow, Mowlem Scotland has an annual turnover
of more than #50m, after about #9m of sales by its associated Northern
Regional Civil Engineering company are taken into account.
The annual turnover of Scottish Homes' building division, which
operates profitably within the quango, is about #20m.
Mowlem Scotland's business development manager, Brian Jukes, said:
''The business is restricted at the moment by only being able to work in
the public sector.
''We would want to be able to keep the public sector business going
and then expand into the private sector.''
Managing director Colin Sutherland believes the building division's
Central Scotland-wide repairs and maintenance service, with its reactive
nature, is unique. He sees no reason why it cannot be extended from the
housing to the retail and commercial sectors.
The building division operates 12 depots from Kilmarnock to Dundee,
carrying out repairs and maintenance for Scottish Homes, housing
associations, local authorities and other public sector bodies.

ALASTER Cunningham, who joined the board of Craig &amp; Rose in May, is
fully underwriting a proposed #500,000 rescue rights issue which will
increase the Ordinary share capital of the struggling Edinburgh-based
paint and wall-coverings company by 50%, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Mr Cunningham, who set up the multi-franchise Abercromby Motor Group
in Edinburgh nearly 10 years ago, has assumed responsibility for the
strategic direction of Craig &amp; Rose.
The net proceeds of the 250p, one-for-two rights issue, estimated at
#409,000, will fund the company's ongoing cost reduction and
modernisation programme, which the board believes is essential if Craig
&amp; Rose's future is to be secured. The issue price compares with a
closing price on Thursday of 300p.
With Mr Cunningham wishing to hold at least 15% of the enlarged
Ordinary capital after the rights issue, three other directors and one
director's relatives, together with certain family and employee trusts,
have undertaken to transfer their full entitlements to him.
He will take up all these shares, equivalent to 14.7% of the enlarged
capital, so long as, when added to any take-up in his capacity as
underwriter, they do not take his stake above 29%.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the rights issue at an
extraordinary general meeting on July 24.
Two weeks ago, the company announced a 1994 pre-tax loss of #841,000,
after a deficit of #518,000 the previous year.
Announcing the rights issue yesterday, Craig &amp; Rose said trading in
the first quarter of this year had been unsatisfactory. Turnover had
declined, particularly in wall-coverings.

THE British Association of Social Workers has been concerned for a
number of years about the limited availability of treatment for people
who have been sexually abused.
From the published Information it would appear Eric Cullen had been so
abused for a number of years by a confirmed paedophile.
The assocation has strongly advocated a positive programme of
treatment and education to help victims overcome the severe social and
emotional damage suffered by such experiences.
Is the answer to such charges really a sentence of imprisonment
particularly in view of the recent spate of suicides in prisons? Should
we not be thinking seriously about a more effective and positive
approach?
Our colleagues who are working within prisons with sexual abusers are
doing an excellent job. I am sure they would agree that a community
programme would be preferable to a prison sentence.

Scottish Secretary, BASW,

* To increase my net income it has been suggested that I take a loan
up to the #30,000 limit on my house which is currently mortgage free,
take advantage of the tax relief available on this and invest the cash
to produce a net increase in income. What are your views on this?
* To qualify for tax relief, mortgage interest must be paid on a loan
taken to purchase your only or main residence. What has been proposed is
that you re-mortgage your house rather than purchase it. Therefore, tax
relief would not be available on the interest. It would be necessary to
sell your existing property and buy another before tax relief would be
available.
Having said that, it might in any event not be a worthwhile exercise.
Although mortgage interest rates are relatively low, yields on many
investments are equally low and it will be difficult to increase your
net income in excess of the net interest costs. Although interest may
qualify for tax relief if you purchase a new house this will only be at
15%, whereas income received from the sum invested is taxable possibly
at the higher rate depending on your other income.

SAVE &amp; Invest of Glasgow is offering a with-profits bond through a
major UK insurer which will return 12.5% net of basic rate tax in the
first year for an investment of #100,000 and over. The rate is 12% for
amounts from #20,000 to #100,000 and 11% below #20,000.
The bonus rate on the with-profits fund from July 31 will be 8.5% net,
with a special enhancement in the first year. The bond is designed to be
held for five years as there are early withdrawal charges starting at 8%
in the first year, declining to 3% in the fifth.
BANK of Scotland is offering mortgages at 1% for the first six months,
a discount of 7.34% on its normal home loan rate.
ACCOUNTANT Stewart Mckie has published a guide to VAT -- 250 Practical
VAT Saving Hints. The book explains in plain language how VAT can be
reduced and is cross-referenced to the relevant authorities where
further information can be obtained. Priced at #9.99 including postage,
it is available from Stewart &amp; Co, 54 Pembroke Road, London W8 6NX.
CORNHILL Insurance is reducing the cost of its buildings insurance
premiums by up to 13.5% and its contents premiums by up to 8%.
ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester Building Society has cut its unsecured personal
loan rate to 13.4% for amounts exceeding #5000.
JOHNSON Fry is targeting a gross income of 9% from year two from an
investment plan which enables smaller investors to get into commercial
property with the prospect of capital growth. Minimum investment is
#3000.
WORLDCOVER Direct has introduced an annual travel insurance policy
costing #75, or #120 for a family, for an unlimited number of trips.
M&amp;G is to launch a corporate bond PEP on July 24. It will carry no
initial charge but will be subject to a withdrawal fee of 4.5% reducing
to nil after five years. The annual management fee is 1.25% taken from
income rather the capital. There will be a quarterly income option.
Minimum investment will be #1000 or #50 a month.

* I am having trouble with a small mail-order firm and I wonder if you
could clarify my rights. I ordered an item to be paid for on delivery. I
know you are supposed to examine goods before paying but the van arrived
when I was rushing out and there was too much packaging to inspect the
product.
I paid for the item and only later found there was a fault affecting
the look of it rather than its performance. The company is trying to fob
me off by saying that as I had paid for it I had indicated approval,
particularly as on my own admission the product does work, and that I
shall have to claim under the guarantee. This is not good enough and I
want a replacement or my money back. Can you help?
* Consumer rights have been strengthened in this area and the supplier
is incorrect. He might have got away with it under the old rules but not
now. Legislation now says the customer must have had a reasonable time
to inspect the goods. The short time available if you have to pay on
delivery cannot under any definition be called reasonable.
In addition, the goods must be of a satisfactory quality and not
merely fit for the purpose. So external damage is a sufficient reason to
reject them. You should point out the new rules to the supplier and
threaten legal action if he does not co-operate.
* From time to time I come across the term mezzanine finance, usually
in connection with a new company raising capital. Can you expain it?
* Mezzanine finance comes between ordinary loans and equity. It is
used where there is a shortfall in the capital required between the
amount that can be raised from bank loans and the equity backing
available.
From the provider's viewpoint it is riskier than bank loans but not as
risky as equity, which ranks last in the pecking order in the event of a
winding-up. As a result the interest rate charged is often 1% to 2%
higher than on bank loans, and frequently there is a sweetener in the
form of warrants on the equity.
If the company succeeds it can be a lucrative investment for the
provider as a result of this, though, of course, the investment can be
lost entirely if it fails. Mezzanine finance is often a feature of
management buy-outs where a lot of capital is usually required.
* Could you please advise me on buying #1000 worth of unit or
investment trusts for each of my six grandchildren. Their ages range
from three to 10. Is there an advantage in choosing 18 as opposed to 21
for them to mature? I wondered about Foreign &amp; Colonial or Murray
Johnstone, but have no idea which to select. I should be grateful for
your guidance.
* We think you should choose one of the large general investment
trusts with an internationally diversified portfolio of investments. You
can purchase the shares through the manager's investment scheme at a
lower cost than if you used a stockbroker.
You might like to pick from the following: Foreign &amp; Colonial
Investment Trust in London, Alliance Trust in Dundee, Baillie Gifford's
Scottish Mortgage Trust in Edinburgh, and Martin Currie's Scottish
Eastern Investment Trust in Edinburgh. This is by no means an exhaustive
list, but all of them are suitable for long-term investment, where the
main aim is capital growth.
The age at which you would like the investments to mature is not
primarily a financial matter. In fact, the shares can be sold at any
time. One advantage of allowing access to the funds at 18 is they could
help with the cost of higher education. It is for you to decide whether
this is what you want or whether you would rather they waited until 21.
Of course, the longer the investment term the greater the potential
for capital growth. Hence the gift could be worth more in the end to the
three-year-old than a 10-year-old.
* My husband and I will shortly be making cash gifts of around #20,000
to our son who is being married. The purpose is to help him with the
purchase of his first house. I broadly understand the inheritance tax
rules and that there is a specific exemption for marriage gifts, but how
does this work with the seven-year position of potentially exempt
transfers?
* Outright gifts to individuals in the first instance are potentially
exempt transfers which will only be taken into account in calculating
your inheritance tax position if you die within seven years from the
date of the gift. In this case the gifts become chargeable but the
exemptions available at the date they were made will be applied, and it
is possible in your case the full amount will be covered by these.
A gift of #5000 made in consideration of marriage by a parent of
either party is exempt. In addition, there is the annual exemption of
#3000. The previous year's annual exemption can also be carried forward
for one year only if it has not already been used. Each of these
exemptions is available to both husband and wife, so if you are able to
split the cash gift between you you could possibly each have exemptions
of #11,000 available -- #5000 marriage and #6000 annual -- to cover it
in the event of death within seven years.
* I have the following assets: house (free of mortgage) worth #75,000,
holdings in the usual privatisation shares worth #10,000, #500 in a high
interest savings account, #500 in a building society easy access
account, and #500 in Premium Bonds. I am 65 and my wife 62.
My income consists of state pension of #95 a week plus an annuity of
#44. With this I have just received a tax-free lump sum of #7500. The
insurance company is advising investment of this in its five-year income
and growth PEPs. Do you agree?
* As you are barely a taxpayer there is little point in investing in
PEPs, the advantage of which is that income and capital gains are tax
free. You might well be better off with a straight investment in unit
trusts which carry lower charges.
If you require more income you could consider the National Savings
Pensioners' Bond which pays 7.5% gross. Otherwise the income and growth
formula for long-term investment is not a bad idea, the object being
that there will be sufficient capital growth to maintain the value of
the investment in real terms while paying income which will gradually
increase as company dividends rise.
However, it would mean most of your capital being invested for the
long term in shares and it would be better to have at least some of the
#7500 in easily realisable form with no risk, such as National Savings.

RICHARD BRANSON is set to revolutionise cinema-going in Britain after
yesterday's agreement to buy 116 MGM cinemas for #200m.
He plans spending ''tens of millions'' to upgrade the existing chain
which includes 18 multi-plexes and hopes to build 10 more multi-plexes
throughout Britain over the next 2[1/2] years as premier cinema
attractions and entertainment centres
''What we want to do is to make the cinema chain the place to go for
an evening out.''
That would include putting in more comfortable seats and recruiting
the best-trained staff using the experience gained from training the
Virgin Atlantic airline employees.
The multi-plexes would carry the Virgin name but the conventional
cinemas would use another brand logo -- the MGM title has to be dropped
within 18 months.
Other ramifications could include cross-marketing with other Virgin
products such as the music stores, pop music radio stations, cola and
vodka as well as promoting the indepenedent airline which has taken on
British Airways and has won more than once.
MGM has about 25% of the UK cinema audience attracting 20 million
people annually.
They could be used as the vehicle to show Virgin produced films. The
last film that Branson produced was in 1984 with George Orwell's 1984.
That starred the late Richard Burton in his last film before his death.
Proposed changes in the tax law as well as assured distribution would
make UK film-making a much more economic proposition than hitherto.
In spite of early competition from potential bidders including Rank
Organisation, Carlton Communications and Prudential Venture Managers, a
Virgin-lead consortium has had sole negotiating rights recently with
Credit Lyonnais.
The French bank, which incurred a huge amount of bad debts in the
early 1990s and was bailed out by the French taxpayer, seized the MGM
assets in Britain and Europe from Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti
in 1992.
It asked S G Warburg in February to find a buyer with the end of June
as a target date.
The Virgin consortium includes two US cinema operators, Reasing Corp
and its Craig parent. It intends to undertake international expansion
but not in the United States, where the market is saturated.

ERIC CULLEN has enough to bear, suffering as he does from
achondroplasia. His success as Wee Burney is a small compensation, and
all credit to him for making the little beast so believable.
Even were he to be found, after appeal, to have behaved so
reprehensibly, there does seem to have been a campaign against him.
I suggest that it has been a campaign against Burney, whom we laugh
at, but would love to kick downstairs.
Give the man a break -- let Eric out of Burney.

THE suicide of two young girls who were on remand in a Scottish prison
was one of those poignant human tragedies which was everyone's and
no-one's fault and which must never be allowed to happen again.
Over the last five years or so the Howard League, working in double
harness with Save the Children's Care and Justice Unit, has been urging
the Government, as a matter of urgency, to bring young people of 17 and
18 within the scope of the Children's Hearing system (which is now
nationally based) and to resource that system accordingly.
No doubt because of the resource implications nothing has happened.
Now that this has, in the most literal and tragic sense, become a
life-and-death issue, it is surely time for a positive response. It is
surely time for Lord Fraser to put in hand the relatively modest
legislative change which would solve the problem at a stroke.

YOUR headline reads, ''Lawyer claims new evidence will clear Clegg''
(June 29). No evidence fresh or stale is required to clear Pte Clegg --
the victim at the hands of this Government of one of the grossest
miscarriages of justice since Alfred Dreyfus was wrongfully stigmatised
and transported to Devil's Island for a wrong alleged against him that
he'd never committed but which the authorities were determined would be
made to stick.
Pte Clegg was guilty of doing no more than the duty laid upon him that
has been every sentry's, every guard's, since Horatius and before. In
Pte Clegg's place I'd have done exactly as he did in the same
circumstances -- and with a clear conscience.
The role of scapegoat is not new, neither is that of murderer. Long
ago King David placed Uriah the Hittite in the forefront of the battle
in the hope and expectation that Uriah would be killed and he, King
David, would be quit of an awkward problem.
Today we have Pte Clegg made scapegoat for ineffectual governance
sheltering behind a legal concoction of weasel words made to spell
murder -- and this done in the name of the law.
To add injury to injustice I learn that the parents of the dead woman
and her companion in the affair they had deliberately provoked are to
receive from the Government an undisclosed sum in compensation.
The only troubles this Government has to seek are, sadly, of its own
making and I wish they were not.
Further words fail me.

I READ Mr Hepburn's letter about his return trip from Cumbrae Slip
with increasing amazement (June 29).
In Caledonian MacBrayne's timetable on view at both Cumbrae and Largs,
the late Sunday sailing from Cumbrae is scheduled for 8.30pm, some 15
minutes after Mr Hepburn and, apparently, 94 other drivers arrived. I
would have thought the fact that one ferry remained in service with its
tired crew until 11.45pm is something the writer ought to be grateful
for.
It would seem it was the passengers who were not showing
consideration, not Caledonian MacBrayne.
As far as the cost is concerned, the ''little change'' out of Mr
Hepburn's #30 is #5.40. Let him try going over the Skye Bridge next year
for the same amount.

THE Barings 9[1/4]% Perpetual Noteholders Action Group (BPNAG) has
increased pressure on the Bank of England and is demanding more openness
in the Bank's investigation of the spectacular collapse of Britain's
oldest merchant bank in February. That was after derivatives dealer Nick
Leeson, based in Singapore, bet the wrong way on the course of the Tokyo
market.
The creditors, who are owed #100m, said in a statement that the Bank
appeared reluctant to answer relevant questions about Barings.
In particular, BPNAG is concerned that ''the results of the BoE's
inquiry would not address these questions more than tangentially, if at
all, and that the results might be delayed into the holiday season.''
It has set up its own inquiry.
In May, it wrote to Governor Eddie George, asking what advice the Bank
had given the Treasury about Barings and also why it had allowed
Holland's second-largest bank, ING, to take it over.
A call for an independent public inquiry has already been spurned by
Mr George.
The Bank expects to hand over its report to the Chancellor of
Exchequer later this month and it will then be up to Kenneth Clarke to
decide on publishing the findings.

REGARDING the response by the Scottish Sports Council to the proposed
Loch Lomond by-laws, I am concerned that this public-funded body should
be speaking out for only one of the seven water sports which it
supports.
Obviously the requirements for angling, canoeing, rowing, sailing,
sub-aqua swimming, and water skiing are all different but water skiing
takes up more space than any of the other water sports and the high
minimum speed makes the area used by water skiers unavailable for all
other activities.
Without some form of control the opportunities to enjoy the other
aquatic sports will be much curtailed.
Nor is there any sense in proposing that the water skiing by-laws
should apply only at peak times on the loch since these are largely
determined by the unpredictable West of Scotland weather.
Perhaps it is regrettable that by-laws are now the only way by which
the widest possible range of activities can be enjoyed by all who visit
our most famous loch. Certainly there is no case for the Sports Council
advocating preferential treatment for one of their sports.

FOR 17 years out of 20 I have been directly involved in the stowage,
transfer, and tank preparation for crude oil and associated products.
For four of these years I was totally responsible for all aspects of
crude-oil transfer and stowage. This included inspection and cleaning of
crude-oil spaces, and at no time did I encounter radioactivity or any of
the other so-called nasties, other than oil-bearing sludge, that our
Labour and SNP MPs are now being strangely quiet about.
Perhaps they are beginning to realise that they will have to come up
with an alternative to the Shell option of deep-sea dumping, which may
be difficult.
Every country on the planet will be watching to see where Shell do
dispose of the Spar, and will form a queue to put their own redundant
floating storage units in the same place.
Having inspected ships' tanks that carried Brent crude loaded at the
Spar, I know there are crude-oil sludges that are far more toxic and a
hell of a lot more difficult to dipose of.

THIS uncharacteristic continental weather has set me thinking of
France. Have you noticed how pleased about being French the French are?
They revel in proclaiming their Frenchness. Their cooking, their cars,
even their old buildings. Old French towns with old French buildings.
Buildings which have been lovingly restored and renovated, then used by
modern active business.
Our fast-track European neighbours really should be more like us and
work harder at shedding their cultural baggage. The slightest crash of a
slate or two, the odd crack in a wall, and we opt for a policy of,
flatten it before fix it. In so doing we nicely chip away at the
Scottish character of our towns and environment.
Having recently moved back to Troon after a number of years away. I am
surprised to find that Troon appears to be making tentative steps to
follow this movement to remove any cultural associations from our towns.
St Patrick's primary school near the centre of town, a traditionally
styled grey sandstone structure, in need of repair and renovation, is
soon to be flattened rather then fixed.
It is to be replaced with a new, generic style building complete with
open plan teaching area. In one fell sweep we can arguably expect to
remove both the Scots character of the current building and, with the
open plan nature of the new building, what vestiges of traditional Scots
education might be found inside it.
Even those other fast-track Europeans, the Germans, whom one might
expect to keep the fast track on the straight and narrow, have adopted a
reactionary stance where buildings are concerned. They are off raising
millions of deutchmarks to rebuild the Round Church in Dresden. Why
don't they just build a nice new generic one instead? It would be much
easier.
Move over in the fast track. We peripheral Europeans will show you how
it should be done.

THE UK building industry is making only a slow recovery from the
recession which has gripped it for the past four years. This is
particularly the case for those builders exposed to the housing market
where demand is weak. Profit downgrades are expected to be regular
feature in the coming months.
Crest Nicholson, the property and construction group, yesterday
reported lower half-yearly profits but held its interim dividend at
0.6p. In the six months to April 30, profit before tax was just #129,000
compared with #3m previously. Turnover was up 19% to #116.9m.
Chairman John St Lawrence said the group was encouraged by the
performance of the property and construction divisions. However, this
was offset by poor trading in the residential division because of the
poor housing market and difficulties in the Midlands region where cost
increases on current contracts were underestimated.
Management in the Midlands region has since been reorganised. Crest
Homes sold fewer houses in the first half, 709 compared to 926 in the
first six months of last year. Sales to housing associations worth #7m
accounted for 109 units.
The property division is expected to continue its good performance in
the second half. A strong order book should enable the construction
division to make a profit by the year-end. However, the company said the
current political and economic uncertainty ''gives cause for concern''.
It added that the full-year outcome depended on there being no further
deterioration in the housing market which is currently showing no signs
of improvement. Crest shares slipped 4[1/2]p to 60[1/2]p.
There was gloomy news elsewhere in the sector. Rugby shares were 8p
cheaper at 107p as the company warned that subdued trading in the UK,
US, and Australia would depress its profits. The company said that since
the end of the first quarter, UK volumes, in some cases, are at lower
levels than last year.
In contrast, the Dutch business is said to be recovering from the
construction industry strike and the flooding which affected the early
part of the year. City analysts are expected to lower their profit
forecasts for the current year from around #95m.

ALL his life Samuel Johnston wanted to see a ghost. Unlike your
essayist, James Shaw Grant, this was denied him.
Think of it. One of the greatest intellects lurking in haunted
graveyards, his heart gaping through frightened eyes, as the screech owl
wakes the dead; seeking the symbol that would maybe calm his
ever-present fear of death.
Yet in James Shaw Grant we have a man who sees ghosts everywhere. Not
only that but he exorcises them at will. He has the sweet beguiling
voice of authority. And we listen enrapt, especially when he tells us
that the young generation have broken through what he calls ''the miasma
of memory''.
The miasma of memory? The pollution of memory.
Get rid of memory and the ghosts that haunt the Highlands and Islands
will vanish like morning mist. No more disgust at words like famine,
blood-dripping Clearances. No more the picture of those plunging knives
in hospitable Glencoe. No more the weeping as the land was enclosed and
the halter of law made legal the biggest land theft in Europe.
The pollution of memory. Let me tell James Shaw Grant that the man or
woman who can forget ever any of the above atrocities is fit only to
join Judas in the triple jaws of Satan.
He speaks of Culloden. And again it is to him fable and myth and a
smug play of words. Yet here Gaeldom was trailed in the mire; and here
Gaeldom lies dead and buried.
With shrapnel the Clans were broken
Rooted! they stood at bay;
Yet the Wastrel they died to throne
Fled over the hills away!
The ''Judas Goat'' of Gaeldom
That no-one would betray.

I THINK Lesley Duncan is a little premature in her relief that the
water tower and barbed wire have disappeared from the neo-medieval
cathedral precinct in Glasgow (June 24).
While the new St Nicholas Garden is to be welcomed and will
undoubtedly add to the increasing attractiveness of the Provand's
Lordship side of Cathedral Square, it is probably just as well that the
Princess Royal is due to open it before its proposed neighbouring
''carbuncle'' (to use an HRH-ism) is built.
This incongruous design is on display in the g9 shop in Princes Square
and scotches the myth that the Blue Peter school of architecture is gone
forever.
A hotchpotch of air-conditioning ducting, giant Lego, Corporation
green paint, and presumably some ''sticky-backed plastic'' -- this
strucuture is inconsistent within itself let alone with the surrounding
refurbished area.
If consultation with the people is the watchword of the 1999 City of
Architecture, let us see an artist's impression of the whole square with
its intended tourist centre while the carbuncle is still at the
corn-plaster stage.

GLASGOW is not simply relying on its past and present architecture in
winning the accolade as City of Architecture 1999. It leads the country
in teaching the architects of the future.
The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council has just announced the
results of the recently completed Quality Assessment of the six Scottish
schools of architecture.
The only schools to receive the highest possible grade, Excellent, are
the two based in Glasgow -- the Mackintosh School of Architecture at
Glasgow School of Art and the Strathclyde School of Architecture at the
University of Strathclyde.
By 1999 many of today's students training in these excellent Glasgow
institutions will be contributing to the continuing vibrant architecture
and constantly improving environment of this great city.
Glaswegians must be proud to have those two excellent Scottish schools
of architecture working so successfully within the city.

IT'S riveting, really. Just when our attention was in danger of
straying for an instant from the whereabouts of Hugh Grant -- cad,
beast, how could he? hiss boo -- he turns up, obligatory tyres
squealing, on the drive to the rose-trellised doorstep of his betrayed,
bewildered, sweet-faced lover. The rumpled penitent, home under a darkly
velvet sky to whisper sweet words of sorrow . . .
What a load of hokum. Outside the tryst, the world's media, 47 of them
as I write, lay siege to the country cottage, hiring hoists at #200 a
time, clambering up ladders, vying for a peep behind the drawn curtains.
They wait to bring us the first coy snap of the Most Glamorous Couple in
Showbiz: the first soft-focus glimpse of two begretten faces, fingers
entwined in forgiveness.
But wait, what's this? A new bed arrives, a white one, and it's big,
and what is the significance of this: it's base came in two halves. Is
this a metaphor for the healing, the resurrection of a lasting
relationship sanctified by image makers and torn assunder by a moment's
weakness that involved haggling over the price of a blow job with a
totsy in the backstreets of Tinsel Town?
Stop tittering. It's not funny, not at all a subject for humour. For a
start, uniform gorgeousness is an impediment to comedy. So let's not
call this catastrophic emotional crisis a laugh. It was, for instance,
no match for the hilarity of watching John Redwood struggling amid the
scrum of Euro-septics to persuade us that he alone can save the nation,
and the seats of the Tory Wobbly Tendency. Some performance, some actor.
Look, Liz Hurley is a latter-day saint. All the men of my acquaintance
insist it is so. Famous for activities which are only faintly concerned
with her principal profession which is, er, having Hugh Grant as a
boyfriend and being nifty with the safety pins.
An icon of loveliness, is she not? Dignified, wasn't she? In the face
of humiliation, betrayal, public shame, she is irritatingly resistant to
further emotional dismemberment, issuing that coolly detached statement
about her sad isolation and loneliness through a retinue of public
relations advisers.
Liz, the inspiration for countless masturbatory eulogies, who has a
#1m make-up contract and a reputation to protect. A girl has to make a
living: as Desire no doubt told Hugh, and will now have the opportunity
to tell the judge.
And there's poor, dear, devastated Hugh: alas, his charm is lost on
me. He looks, does he not, like he is descended from a long line of
maiden aunts? Albeit the furtive looking one whom we long suspected of
harbouring a dark secret. The very image of the fallen gentleman.
His action in hiring the services of a Hollywood hooker was not merely
inexpensive, it was cheap. Is Hollywood stardom so boring that adventure
must be sought in sexual risk taking, the commentators wonder? Does his
penitential statement sound suspiciously like a new lick of sophistry
for a worn-out defence, this one mulls?
Still, there's something touching about the intrusion of manky realism
into the artfully concocted fantasy -- the weird culture of celebrity.
As Hollywood budgets get bigger and its collective IQ smaller, it seems
we're all drawn in as bit-part players to join the cast.
The wisest words of the week surely came not from the columnists or
the commentators but from Max Clifford, PR guru, originator of various
startling newspaper headlines about Freddie Starr's culinary taste for
hamsters, and the man who brought you the memorable image of David
Mellor Doing It In a Chelsea Strip: ''Public relations,'' he assured us,
''is about creating the right sort of image -- even if it's totally
false.''
You don't know Hugh Grant. You don't know Elizabeth Hurley. You only
think you do. So the publicity machines will create the right narrative,
seep away the doubt and, like a priest, absolve Hugh of guilt -- no
matter what a judge decides -- because that's the way we like it: happy
endings.
This story is just too real; it goes beyond fallen heroes and betrayed
trust. It's about sustaining a myth through an exercise in
self-delusion, mass escapism through suspension of belief. It's about
the dark secrets people keep. Such as wondering what on earth is all the
fuss about? Does any of it matter? And do you care? To which the answer
is you must, or you wouldn't still be reading this.

I AM somewhat puzzled by Ian Bell's Diary item, Up and atom (June 28).
For years the nuclear industry in this country has been accused of
being secretive and dishonest. Which is why we at BNFL, along with
Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, have spent considerable time,
money, and effort in an open and honest approach through building
Visitors' Centres.
Then we get criticised. It appears to be a case of we are damned if we
do and damned if we don't.
Ian Bell criticises us for simplifying the case for nuclear power. All
our research shows that we in the nuclear industry have been dealing
with the subject in a factual and basically uninteresting way far too
long. What we are now doing is presenting information about nuclear
power and BNFL in an educational, interesting, and entertaining way.
Today the public expect visitors' centres to be entertaining and to
use state-of-the-art hands-on exhibits. That is precisely what we have
done at Sellafield.
I would like to take this opportunity, now that the holiday season is
upon us, to invite readers to come to the Sellafield Visitors' Centre
and to judge for themselves. I can assure them of a warm welcome and an
interesting and worthwhile experience. It is also free.

THE weather is a strange business. As Britain basked in the heatwave
this week no doubt there were some who saw it as the answer to prayers
for a proper summer. However, others would be praying for rain. If one
man's meat is another man's poison, then one man's heatwave is another
man's drought.
Who would have thought that Tarmac would be melting on roads in the
Highlands? Already some regions of England have brought in hosepipe
bans, and no doubt if present trends continue we will have water
shortages and farmers will be talking of a threat to their livelihood.
We never seem to be able to cope with sustained periods of good or bad
weather in Britain. Persistent days of rain lead to floods threatening
some areas and sub-zero temperatures and a snowfall send our transport
arteries into trauma.
There is a temptation to find a reason for it all. God is the easiest
explanation. Are not catastrophes such as earthquakes, tempests, and
floods described by some insurance documents as ''acts of God''? Nor
does God appear to make it easier on Himself to be exculpated from
responsibility for the weather when we open the Bible.
Right from the beginning He is seen to be flooding the world he has
created. And if that is not enough, he is at it again a few generations
later at the time of Noah. When Pharoah proves to be stoney-hearted in
response to Moses's pleas to ''let my people go'', an amazing display of
weather and catastrophe is apparently sanctioned by God until the
Egyptian ruler relents.
God apparently assists the prophet Elijah to provide rain in time of
drought and in general is seen in the Old Testament using natural
phenomena like rain, hail, and thunder to signify disapproval of
something. Only when we reach the New Testament does God appear to be
less concerned with the weather. ''God sends his rain and his sun on the
just and the unjust alike,'' declares Jesus in what I think is an
attempt to distance God from responsibility for the weather.
Indeed, I am rather glad of that text, because religion which views
natural phenomena such as ''earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or even
simple hail storms'' as indicating God's mood or reaction to human
events, seems to be a rather primitive one.
What about all those fire and brimstone wobblies with the weather in
the Old Testament, I hear you ask? My way of looking at these is that
they are parables of catastrophes which befell human society, used by
the writers of the Bible as pictorial events to portray what had
happened in moral terms. They make a symbolic connection, but not a
causal one -- rather in the way that drizzle on the day of a funeral has
not come because of the death of the person but can be seen as
reflecting tears and mourning.
Besides, a God who controls the weather in such a way would be the
kind of being who controls human life like a puppeteer. There would be
no free will. We would be led by the logic of positing such a God to
make Him responsible for children falling into canals or being run over
by lorries, and I cannot believe in such a being.
If there is a theology of weather, it is that some get it better than
others. (Surely this is none other than the parable of the unjust
steward told by Jesus, being translated into meteorological language).
Quite clearly there are some places which have better weather not
occasionally but continually. Shetland is almost always second bested by
Sussex, and Milnathort by Majorca.
The more subtle question is whether this has an affect on the people
who live in these places.
Are the ones who have more sun, sunnier in nature? The answer, alas,
seems to be that they are. In general people seem more relaxed,
moderate, and sane where the weather is temperate. Where it is grim and
hostile they seem more likely to look on the gloomy side of life. Where
it is frazzlingly hot, they are more likely to be intemperate in their
behaviour.
This is especially true when it comes to religion. The countries with
temperate weather seem most relaxed about religious things, while those
with a darker picture tend to a more strict view of life, and the
hot-bloods embrace fundamentalism more easily.
The advantage of this is that it gives us a better reason (perhaps
even an excuse) for behaving religiously as we do -- and hopefully stops
us blaming it all on God. But what if humans were able to take over the
role of weather providers which primitive societies assign to God?
What if giant solar cells could steam up a cloud of rain from the sea,
and with the aid of new technology, dump it on the areas of drought in
Africa? What if the technology could be used to disperse the weather
system over Scotland so that it not only had the best scenery per square
mile in Europe, but the best climate as well?
What a kingdom of heaven indeed. Not only peace and justice, but
decent weather as well. Alas, it will not happen. Even if the technology
could be developed, it would only lead to bitter disputes between
farmers and tourist providers over how much rain would be allowed and
when. It would lead to as many disputes as religion. Which for me
explains the reason God still gets the blame for our shortcomings in
religion as well as for the weather.

THE French have upset their partners in the Schengen Agreement,
designed to open European frontiers to the free movement of citizens of
the signatories across their national borders. Their reasons are similar
to those advanced by the British Government in refusing to agree to such
freedoms which are desirable in themselves but ''too risky'' (the French
phrase) in present circumstances. The other six Schengen partners are
upset, but the original accord, which was designed to become operative
tomorrow, left all signatories with the opt-out of which France has
availed itself. Though the Belgians deplored the move (which may be
reassessed in six months), their Interior Minister was more
understanding, saying, ''We have to leave a margin of manoeuvrability
for each country.'' This is the way the European Union is supposed to
work, with flexibility and understanding and without recrimination. In
fact the Schengen accord was signed with only seven of the EU member
states; the others were expected to accede as time and experience
demonstrated its practicality.
The French have found it not to be working in three areas -- illegal
immigration, drug trafficking, and the problems caused by other
signatories refusing to accept returned asylum seekers entering France
from their territories. The French are particularly worried about
illegal immigration, given the recent electoral success of the far-right
Nationalists in south-eastern France (Languedoc and Provence), where
illegal immigrants from North Africa (especially Algeria) first arrive,
and often remain. The National Front suspects that moves such as this
could achieve overwhelming proportions if not abruptly curtailed. Its
spokesmen prey on popular fears that this is all too likely to be true,
and that French vigilance is not enough since there are alternative
routes to France which open up immediately if the Schengen accord allows
automatic entry through other signatory states. Italy is not a signatory
state, but once in Italy too it is easier to move to another EU state,
and many North Africans take advantage of Italy's attitude to entry
(liberal or lax, depending on your point of view) to make it their first
landing place before moving on. Germany, which is a signatory, plays a
similar role in relation to Eastern Europe.
The hand of President Chirac is evident in these moves: it is his
voters who are most likely to be susceptible to fears of illegal
migrants and to desert to Mr Le Pen's National Front. The President is
also as hostile to drug trafficking as was Lady Thatcher. The Dutch, by
contrast, have a much more relaxed attitude to drug use, and it is from
the Netherlands that the French seem to have had most examples of
illegal imports. This is a problem which will not go away, given Dutch
attitudes, and it may even mean that the French refusal to swallow the
implications of the Schengen accord will not disappear after another six
months; official French attitudes to drugs are only a little less severe
than British. If anything, French responses to asylum seekers are even
less welcoming than our own. If that is not likely to be a major
sticking point it is only because nearly all EU members have tightened
up their regulations in this area, given the way that requests for
asylum have soared in the past decade because it often looks like a
convenient cover for straightforward migration.
The fundamental fact behind the migratory movement is that the EU is
the world's most attractive welfare society. It may have many drawbacks,
especially in the eyes of its own citizens, but for almost every other
part of the world it exerts a powerful magnetic pull. The French want to
switch that off -- if they can.

IF THERE'S one thing about kids I hate, sorry, I mean that I find very
rewarding, it's that they can't just enjoy life. To get the most from
things like good weather, they've got to do something in it. Kids force
you into activity at times when you least want it, ie, usually before
7am. Five years ago, if it were sunny, I was like any sane adult. I
would have said ''Good. It's sunny. I'll go back to sleep till about 12
then maybe get up so that I can mill aimlessly around until it's cool
enough to go out to do something sedentary.''
Not now. Not with three bundles of joy jumping around. It's now a case
of ''Daaaaaaaddy! It's sunny!'' as they bounce on your head, and no
matter how you try, it's difficult to sleep through that. Sunshine means
we have to do something more suited to the outdoor life than the usual
winter sports like trampling crisps and fluorescent fruit juice into the
living room carpet while the Dumbo video's on.
So, joy of joys, the sun was out, and we decided to go to the beach,
or rather I was told I was going to the beach. To my mind, the beach is
like primary school; there's no point in going once you're older than
12. Eleven years and under, the beach is a great thing. Kids know that
sand is just a clean form of dirt, and therefore when you're young sand
is the only kind of muck that adults actively encourage you to mess
around in.
Once the teenage years are reached, only women go to the beach out of
choice. Female attitudes to the beach have always been slightly
different: like shopping and swimming, going to the beach is something
they do in packs, intent on a ''good chat''. Their main reason for going
to the beach is to sunbathe furiously, the average teenage girl's idea
of sunblock being a half gallon of cooking oil, and while gossip oozes
out like sweat, they just lie there for hours on end.
The motivation for this endless sunbathing is unclear, but research
has shown that women believe that a tan makes them more attractive.
Lying about in the sun for hours might make them feel better, but for
some sunbathers, they would also need a spot of all-over liposuction or
some major facial reconstruction. I know that if I wanted to increase my
attractiveness to women, I'd need more than a few hours in the fresh
air, probably at least a new Porsche, or a sizable lottery win.
So we got to the beach at about 10, and we stayed there for hours. No
joking; hours it was. All the kids on the beach obviously had an immense
stamina for performing mindless repetitive tasks for hours on end. This
is an ability that they will lose with age, particularly if they grow up
to become junior doctors. Nowadays the average medical graduate can't
seem to manage watching a whole episode of Casualty without getting a
legally enforced eight-hour rest break and psychological counselling!
But it wasn't so much that we were there for so long that I objected to,
it was the fact that I was always on the lookout. I remember when the
beach was regarded as a safe, healthy place to be. The most dangerous
thing on the beach used to be the odd bit of broken glass, but now there
are dangers everywhere. The sea around Britain now has more bugs than an
old-style Russian hotel room, every stranger is a potential child
abducter, and leaving any kid without sun cream for more than 15 minutes
is tantamount to attempted murder.
Seriously, the past 10 years have seen a vast increase in the strength
of the sun; UV penetration is now such that Scottish ''Burn Times'' are
now measured in minutes rather than days. Thirty years ago, by the time
someone had been out long enough to get sunburned it was October and
they had more chance of getting a free Hoover flight than sunstroke.
When I was young, real men were too macho to have to try to get a tan,
and too hard to need protection from the sun. Now everyone knows to put
cream on any time you're exposing the flesh for more than two minutes.
Well, almost everyone. Like many people this week, when I read the
stories about the epidemic of sunburn among adults in this country, I
could barely speak for laughing.
If Darwin were around today, he'd recognise that sunburn is a
manifestation of his ''survival of the fittest'' theories. While the
sensible, Evolutionary Efficient Man takes precautions to avoid getting
frazzled, Mr Biologically Unfit is drinking beer and boasting about what
a great tan he's got, and how he never burns. At the end of the day,
who'll be down the disco at night, pulling the birds in a pale and
interesting manner? Not Mr Unfit: he'll be lying static on cotton sheets
that feel like sandpaper. When the sun comes out and the libido goes up,
sunburn is nature's way of saying ''Not tonight dear, I'm too tired.''
Another 90s beach hazard is the barbeque fallout. Why is there always
the obligatory bunch of nutters who insist on trying to cook outside, in
public? Why do they think the concept of kitchens has actually done so
well around the developed world? Not only is barbequeing a pain in the
neck for everyone caught downwind, but the food's rotten. Why not just
eat the briquettes and cut out the hassle? Scientists cannot work out
how it's possible to get a chicken breast charred on the outside while
it remains totally raw on the inside. Perhaps wih the knowledge of
chicken's insulating properties, NASA might allow future space shuttles
to re-enter with only a boxful of chicken McNuggets glued to the nose.
Having said which, individually designed space-age research Teflon tiles
are probably a cheaper option, pound for pound.
Having braved these seaside dangers it was time to round up the kids
and drive home, which judging by the TV this week may in itself be an
overtly hazardous process. These programmes told us all about ''Road
Rage'', a term used to describe what psychopaths do while driving.
Apparently Road Rage is closely allied to Post Office Queue Rage,
Hospital Casualty Rage, and That Bastard Next Door Has Taken My Parking
Space Rage.
The psychologists they interviewed told us in carefully measured tones
about how these ''Road Rage Sufferers'' get angry because every slight
on the road is taken personally as a symbol of the slights that they are
experiencing in their everyday lives. Amazingly, they manage to describe
''Road Rage Sufferers'' without once using the words ''bad mannered'',
''tosser'', or ''needs a good kick up the arse''.
So we got home safely, and that night as I sat in the shade after
having a few slow beers, I was smug in the knowledge that we had had
everyone on the beach during one of the year's hottest days, and no-one
had got sunburned. Well, the more irresponsible among us managed to burn
the top of their feet, an incredibly stupid and uncomfortable thing to
do. It only took me four days to recover.

The Conservative Party is currently embroiled in a messy and rancid
battle which may result in the country having a new Prime Minister.
Fifty years ago this month the country did have a new Prime Minister. He
was elected in very different circumstances, by a nation weary after a
long if necessary war, yet full of hope for the future. In this
magisterial reassessment, Kenneth Harris presents a rounded portrait of
the man who was not just the greatest leader of the Labour Party, but
also one of Britain's greatest Prime Ministers
ATTLEE was a great Prime Minister, a far-seeing statesman and an
outstanding party leader. He lacked the charisma of Gladstone, Disraeli
or Lloyd George, but like them he presided with authority over powerful
governments promoting profound and lasting social change.
The one-time Secretary to the Cabinet, the late Lord Helsby, who
served five Prime Ministers, said: ''The country was never so well
governed, in a technical sense, as it was under Attlee.'' As a statesman
his reputation could rest merely on his handling of India -- not only
did he, in contrast to Churchill, grasp the importance of independence
for India, but he was virtually his own Secretary of State for India and
dominated the process which brought this to fruition.
He nursed and exploited the vital post-war relationship with the
United States, and was among the first to detect the menace of Soviet
expansion. As a party leader he was second to none, his supreme
achievement being best described by himself: '' . . . to take a party
into a coalition, keep it intact for five years, bring it out intact and
win an election with it (1945) when most people expected defeat.''
Attlee was born into an upper-middle-class family of Christian
do-gooders, and while practising as a barrister worked in the evenings
at a boys' club in the East End of London. At that time he was a Tory
imperialist. The more he saw of poverty and injustice in Stepney, the
more convinced he became that only the socialists had a solution to
these problems. He gave up the bar and joined the Labour Party, serving
on the Stepney council for some years before he went off to fight (very
bravely: twice wounded) in the First World War.
The writings of Marx and other doctrinaire socialists did not appeal
to him; his socialism came from Carlyle, Ruskin, and William Morris,
and, though he was an agnostic, from the Christian Socialists of his
day. Aided by a small private income, he arrived in Parliament via youth
work, voluntary welfare, and local government -- he had a spell as Mayor
of Stepney. Political life as such did not attract him: he went into
politics motivated by the desire to ''get the rich off the poor people's
backs''. His objective was never a socialist state but a state based on
social justice.
Attlee has been called ''the accidental Prime Minister'', and up to a
point he was. He became deputy leader of the Labour Party in 1931 only
because his seniors in the party had lost their seats in the election of
that year, and he became leader in 1935 and again in 1945 because of the
rivalry between Stafford Cripps, Hugh Dalton, Herbert Morrison, and
Ernest Bevin.
Once he had become Prime Minister in 1945, his qualities of character,
skill as a politician, and strength as an administrator came into play,
owing much to the powerful support of Ernest Bevin, who dominated the
trade union movement, then the backbone of the Labour movement. For his
six years as Prime Minister, Attlee was consequently able to assemble
and manage one of the most powerful administrations in British history
-- enacting an unprecedentedly massive programme of legislation between
1945 and 1951, having great impact on the lives of the British people.
This alone would entitle him to be classed as a great Prime Minister.
Much of Attlee's authority as Premier came from his experience during
the war as Churchill's deputy. Churchill was interested only in running
the war. He was happy to leave everything else to Attlee. For most of
1940-1945, consequently, Attlee chaired the main Cabinet committees
concerned with domestic affairs -- particularly with post-war
reconstruction.
But he also chaired committees dealing with foreign affairs,
particularly the one which dealt with post-war Germany and Europe. At a
time when Bevin, Morrison, Dalton, and Cripps were working on the
domestic front, Attlee was developing a knowledge of foreign affairs
equalled only by Churchill's Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden.
Cabinet papers show how strong a Prime Minister Attlee was. He would
not tolerate late arrival at Cabinet meetings, reading out of briefs,
rhetoric or waffle. Apart from a few words to introduce the subject, and
a succinct summing up of the consensus, he spoke very little himself. He
spoke very little, in fact, on any occasion, and was laconic to the
point of being mute. ''Clem the clam'', King George VI called him,
though admiring him greatly.
Though patient and forebearing, he could act swiftly and surgically.
One junior minister, summoned to No 10, expecting to be congratulated,
seated himself opposite Attlee and asked: ''What can I do for you, Prime
Minister?'' Attlee said. ''I want your job.'' The minister was
staggered. ''But . . . why, Prime Minister?'' ''Afraid you're not up to
it.'' The interview was over.
In early 1947 Cripps, Morrison, and Dalton felt Attlee did not
understand the country's economic problems -- Morrison was economic
''overlord'' -- and should be replaced by Ernest Bevin. Stafford Cripps
went to Attlee and said so. After Cripps had finished speaking, Attlee
picked up the telephone and asked for Bevin. ''Stafford's here,'' he
said. ''He says you want to change your job.'' Bevin replied that he had
no intention of leaving the Foreign Office. ''Thought not,'' said
Attlee, and replaced the telephone. He then told Cripps that improvement
was indeed required on the economic front, and that he proposed
therefore to fire Morrison and to appoint Cripps economic overlord in
his place.
Cripps, with what Attlee later called ''the egotism of the altruist'',
accepted. He had gone to No 10 that night as leader of a rebellion and
came away 30 minutes later as his leader's right-hand man. Dalton
recorded in his diary: ''Attlee once more reigned without challenge . .
. ''
For many years after the war it was said of Attlee that as Prime
Minister he merely ''chaired'' his Cabinet but did not ''run'' his
Government; that he never argued with his colleagues and, in particular,
never questioned anything said or done by his Foreign Secretary, Ernest
Bevin. Such views have long since been demolished by the publication of
the Cabinet Papers for the period 1945-51.
It is evident that though Attlee did not interfere with his Ministers,
he scrutinised, advised, checked, and sometimes stopped everything they
proposed to do. One of the first of the documents to be made public,
dated September 1, 1945, ends the myth that he left foreign policy
entirely to Bevin. His memorandum begins: ''I am not satisfied with the
arguments and conclusions as to the future of the Italian colonies put
forward by the Foreign and Colonial Secretaries.'' It then proceeds to
rebut these arguments and reject the conclusions. As a result the policy
was changed. There are many similar examples.
To a great degree the reputation of a Prime Minister must depend on
what he did that lasted. The welfare state in general and the National
Health Service in particular have endured. The consensus politics which
emerged from the Attlee administrations lasted for nearly 40 years,
until Margaret Thatcher tried to replace consensus with ''conviction''
politics, and to dismantle much of what the Attlee governments had
constructed. In 1990 there was a revolt within her own party against Mrs
Thatcher, and she was removed from the leadership.
One of the complaints against her was her attempt to introduce the
free market mechanism into the NHS. Before Attlee could establish the
NHS in 1948 he had to fight off bitter opposition from the British
Medical Association. Forty years later the BMA was the NHS's strongest
defender.
One of the features of the Attlee governments was morality. Many
people, including Conservatives, have testified to the wholesomeness of
the atmosphere in and around Downing Street. Attlee was a very moral
man. Delinquency on the part of one of his Ministers, or of his staff,
was dealt with immediately.
There came a time when some leaks of information, obviously from
Downing Street, began to figure in reports published in a distinguished
American newspaper. One of Attlee's private secretaries discovered that
these leaks were passing from a Downing Street secretary to her
boyfriend, the London correspondent of the American newspaper concerned.
This discovery was reported at lunchtime to Attlee, who said at once:
''She'll have to go.'' His private secretary offered the view that this
was a delicate matter, and asked when should the young lady be asked to
leave. Attlee responded: ''By teatime.''
On another occasion, being told that one of his junior ministers had
made derogatory remarks in public about a senior member of the
Government, Attlee summoned the young man to No 10: ''I want your job.''
''May I ask why, Prime Minister?''
''Because you are not a gentleman.''
''Prime Minister, what exactly is a gentleman?''
''A gentleman wouldn't need to ask.''
Another interview was over. There was only one inquiry into ''sleaze''
in the six years of the post-war Labour Government, and the case was
trivial compared with what we have come to know today.
The main features of the unprecedentedly massive legislative programme
of the post-war Labour Government were the nationalisation of the basic
industries, the introduction of the National Health Service and the
foundation of the welfare state. The six-year regime of the Labour
Government also for the first time established the Labour Party as an
alternative party of government.
It is inconceivable that any of the Labour Party leaders of the time
could have sufficiently controlled the Cabinet, led the party, and
appealed to public opinion to have made these things possible. Had any
of the other possible leaders become Prime Minister, personal conflicts
and disagreements about policy would have hampered action, and perhaps
led to debacle.
Attlee's patience, self-discipline, sense of timing, self-effacement,
and unique knowledge of party and governmental techniques, gained in 40
years of public work, his combination of personal qualities and
professional expertise, enabled him to give the Government and the party
a quality and strength of leadership which none of his colleagues could
have provided.
As Prime Minister, statesman, and party leader, great as he was,
Attlee is to be criticised. As Prime Minister, he did not grasp the
economic problems with which Britain was faced after the war, and he
overestimated what the nationalisation of coal, rail, and steel would do
for the economy.
As a statesman he misjudged the situation in the Middle East, siding
with the Arabs and underestimating the strength of the Jews. He
neglected Africa -- he did not get to understand its problems until
after he had left office.
As party leader he failed to solve the long-term problem of harnessing
the two historically conflicting drives within the Labour Party -- the
idealistic search for a better society, and the need and urge to get
elected to power. However, none of his predecessors or successors was
successful in that. Perhaps Tony Blair may succeed where others failed
-- the way having been paved by the late John Smith.
History may well record that the Labour administrations of 1945-1951
were among the most influential, valuable and memorable in British
history. Their achievements owed more to Attlee than to any member of
his Government. His very lack of charisma had a message which reached
the people. He looked and sounded so respectable, solid, quiet, a happy
family man who wore a business suit, a homburg hat, smoked a pipe and
loved cricket.
When a controversial socialist programme was being enacted, the man in
charge seemed a symbol of middle-class moderation, decency, decorum, and
common sense. That people thought of him not as ''a great man'' but as
''the common man'' helped him to get his policies across.
His place in British history is secure.

THE political campaigning among Tory MPs will be at its most frenetic
this weekend. The electorate may be small and sophisticated, but the
idea that it is especially duplicitous, or more prone to mind-changing
than a mass electorate, is not convincing. Studies of political
behaviour have shown that most electorates have large numbers of voters
who are prone to doubt until the moment of truth when a mark must be
made. The stories of the last General Election, where many were said to
have changed their minds in the actual polling booth, have a ring of
truth about them, but it may hardly have been novel. Opinion is a
seething sea of currents, and cross currents, moving in contrary
directions, and rising and falling perpetually.
In the current case the calculations are likely to be unusually
complicated, except for Mr Major's supporters, who look like being the
majority. The question from the start has been how supporters of other
potential candidates should behave. Should they support the Prime
Minister, as Mr Heseltine and Mr Portillo proclaim is their own
intention? To the extent that they do so, they will ensure that their
own preferred candidate has no chance before the General Election, since
Mr Major's majority may be sufficient to make a second ballot
impossible. Should they vote for Mr Redwood to make a second ballot
inescapable? If they make him too credible, they may simply open the way
for Mr Heseltine, whose views are probably even less appealing to them
than Mr Major's. Or should they abstain? Those with long memories will
recall that it was not outright opponents but abstainers who did for
Neville Chamberlain in 1940. He still commanded a majority, but those
who had refused to endorse his Premiership were a minority which could
not be ignored.
In fact, Mr Major's campaign has picked up during the week, whereas Mr
Redwood's has not sustained its bravura beginning. The Prime Minister
did especially well in the House of Commons, and this is the real
battleground for the specialised electorate who will settle his fate.
His performance was so good that many observers will wonder why it has
so often before been lacklustre. Mr Redwood, by contrast, appeared to
flounder when confronted by questions of detail. Nothing Mr Redwood has
said alters the case for the Prime Minister to be confirmed in power in
the first instance -- or for Mr Heseltine to be the preferred choice
were things to go to a second ballot.
The disunity of the Tory party, which precipitated Mr Major's gamble
on this election, will not go away after it is over. Mr Major addressed
the problem directly yesterday when he insisted that all must abide by
the outcome. Political life is not quite like that. Only if he comes
home in splendid style will his authority have been confirmed,
especially because Mr Redwood, while not to be dismissed as a
lightweight, is not a heavyweight opponent either. If Mr Major is seen
to falter, he will have lost something of his gamble, and will be almost
back where he started. In that case the main beneficiaries of his move
may prove to have been the Opposition, which has been able to sit back
and enjoy events. Indeed the only caveat from the Opposition's
perspective should be the Prime Minister's improved rating (along with
his Government) in the opinion polls. Three times since 1945 the Tories
have come from the very low twenties in electoral percentages to win, or
very narrowly lose, General Elections. A revived Mr Major may still give
Mr Blair a much closer run than now seems likely; a damaged Mr Major
would be another matter.

Aileen Little visits a Fife museum whose curator is to be made an MBE
by the Queen for long years of dedication to the craft of needlework
NEXT week the Queen makes Mrs Mary Birrell a Member of the British
Empire. The Holyrood investiture will be Birrell's first brush with
royalty. But for 20 years, her voluntary service has steeped her in
textiles with regal connections. She is curator/manager of the
extraordinary Wemyss School of Needlework -- a little museum which
remains open largely due to Mrs Birrell's dedication. Her award is for
services to needlework.
The school sounds prestigious, and in its 19th century heyday,
prestigious it certainly was. Built on Wemyss Castle Estate and paid for
by Miss Dorothy Wemyss, it opened in 1880. The school's raison d'etre
was to teach needlework to the daughters of miners in Coaltown of
Wemyss.
Following a six-month apprenticeship, girls could either stay on for
wages or seek a post as a lady's maid. Some stayed for 12 years. An
unpretentious brick building with three rooms, the school is still under
the ownership of Wemyss Castle. It stands on the main road near the
entrance to the castle drive, looking more like a derelict hall than a
treasure trove described by an American journalist in 1899 as producing
''exquisite specimens of art needlework''.
Such was the standard of work turned out by the pupils (aged 14
upwards, and around 30 at a time) under the tutelage of Mrs Birrell's
great grandmother Mrs Jean Webster, that commissions flooded in from the
highest in the land.
The Princess of Wales ordered two sets of crewel-work curtains; a
similar pair was worked for Princess Louise for use on her yacht; Queen
Victoria bought children's dresses for the young Battenburgs; and the
present Queen Mother had a rug made with a centrepiece ''ER''. Up to the
Second World War the school continued to supply aristocrats and locals
alike, with restoration of antique needlework a well-known speciality.
Now reduced to worn floors and bare brick, the school stores hundreds
of samplers (some dating back to Jacobean times), tissue tracings, class
registers, order books and price lists: ladies' nightdresses cost from
eight old pennies; children's drawers ranged from four old pennies to
one shilling and ladies' striped petticoats started at nine old pennies.
Every weekday afternoon for 20 years, Mrs Birrell has come in to care
for the collection. She spent the first 12 years in the school office
(''it became very cold -- there was no heating'') until Lady Victoria
Wemyss, who died last year, aged 104, installed central heating and
moved her into the showroom next door. Sadly, the glass cases had
succumbed to woodworm.
Mrs Birrell shifts the textiles around to safeguard against damage
from damp.
Despite rather spartan conditions, she feels at home in the school,
immersed in her heritage and surrounded by friendly ghosts. Not only was
her great grandmother the first mistress (formerly employed as a plain
needlewoman at the castle where the fledgling school first opened as a
charity in 1877), her grandmother and mother were pupils too. Mrs
Birrell herself did not attend ''but I learned needlework at my mother's
knee''.
Her grandfather designed the village, and her father renovated the
rows of miners' cottages.
The collection includes artefacts which bring alive remembrance of
things past -- such as a white-scalloped apron and arm protectors like
those worn by Mrs Mary Birrell's distinguished ancestor at her high
desk. ''And here is the christening robe she made for her first
grandchild -- my mother. Unfortunately, my own children and
grandchildren were all too big for it.'' Draped in a corner, among other
beautiful coverlets, is a bedspread (red crewel work in a Jacobean
design) identical to one made by Mrs Webster for her own box bed.
But Mrs Birrell has little time for reflection. Most afternoons she is
booked up with visits from parties appreciative of this unique time
capsule -- Perth Decorative and Fine Arts Society, The Montrose branch
of the Embroiderers Guild, The Costume Society of Edinburgh . . . and so
on.
When not showing people round, the curator is preparing tapestries
based on the old designs, for clients all over the world. ''People
choose a design -- it could be Florentine, cross-stitch or tent-stitch
-- all mostly collected by Lady Victoria. Then they choose their wools.
I cut out and bind all the canvases and my husband does the tracing.''
For 10-hours' work, Mrs Birrell charges under #30 -- proceeds which
are ploughed back into the purchase of materials. She sends out the
tapestry kits with one sequence perfectly stitched -- she gains no money
personally from her efforts.
The clientele is large and varied. Sir David Erskine, for example, is
a regular -- Mrs Birrell recently sewed a waistcoat for his wife. Baron
Bonde from Colinsburgh loves dragon designs and turns them into wall
hangings.
Church women flock to choose patterns for kneelers. One popular choice
incorporates the French, English and Scottish emblems. ''It derives from
a canvas panel done by Mary Queen of Scots at Fotheringay. Did you know
she met Lord Darnley at Wemyss Castle?''
From intricate beadwork to carters' smocks (the school had made 2500
by the end of the nineteenth century), from baby layettes to lovely
quilts, the antique textiles inside Fife's best-kept secret (the
insignificant sign must ensure no-one but those in the know drops by),
the historic Wemyss collection is wearing well under Mrs Birrell's
stewardship.
The building, however, is not so lucky. It is crumbling before her
eyes. And, at 67, Mrs Birrell can see the day when she herself may no
longer be in good shape. ''Who's going to carry on when I'm no longer
here? I can't go on forever.'' The Herald contacted Michael Wemyss,
grandson of Lady Victoria, at the castle, and learned that following
''considerable thought'' as to the best course of action, a rescue plan
is at last to be put into operation.
Mrs Birrell was informed by a relative of the family the same morning.
She and the collection are to be moved temporarily to premises in West
Wemyss, presumably while restoration is carried out. The news is
welcomed by historical experts.
Mrs Webster once said: ''I like to see a piece of work finished as
neatly on the wrong side as the right,'' a comment which speaks volumes
about her philosophy. It's fitting that she and those like Mrs Birrell
who followed on to stitch their place in history, are to be accorded a
museum worthy of immaculate craftsmanship.

LLOYDS Bank has cleared the last hurdle in its #1800m takeover of the
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society when the Building Societies'
Commission nodded through the transfer of assets to Lloyds. The formal
completion date is July 31 and vesting day is August 1.
The society will be known as Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester plc.
Payment will be made around August 10 either by crediting accounts or
by cheque.
To qualify for the maximum payment, investment accounts have to be
topped up by July 31. As already known, those with a qualifying balance
of at least #100 will receive a flat payment of #500 and a percentage
payment of 13.2% for a total of #513.20 on #100 with the maximum payment
being restricted to #13,700 on accounts of over #100,000.
This draws to an end a bid which began in April 1994 and has set a
precedent for other building society takeovers with most interest now
concentrated on the identity of the suitor that the National &amp;
Provincial will eventually choose -- Abbey National is the only name
formally confirmed.

THE hardening Swiss franc has undone the best efforts of customers of
the Alfred Dunhill and Cartier luxury goods retailer Vendome so that
profits rose by just 12% to #237m which is about #10m below
expectations.
However in Swiss currency, the profits advance was just 3.9% and the
company said it is taking all appropriate steps to minimise the currency
impact.
Vendome was put together by its Richemont parent which consolidated
all the luxury goods activities into one company as part of the
reorganisation which resulted in the hiving off of the Rothmans tobacco
interests as a separate entity.
While jewellery and gold watches continued to do well, up 4.7% in
Swiss franc terms, other watches could show only a 3% rise.
Leather goods were also in demand, particularly in the first half in
the Far East. However, pens lost a little of their popularity with sales
falling marginally even in sterling terms and by nearly 8% in francs.
The shares fell 17p to 478p despite the dividend total being a little
better than expected at 9.37p, up 35%, with a 6.47p payment to
shareholders in Vendome Luxury Group which is the UK arm.
Richemont itself raised pre-tax profits by 12% to #740m and the
dividend by 14% to 7p.

Strictly speaking, The Specialist (rental, cert 18) is beneath
criticism; reviewing it is like shooting fish in a barrel. However,
Couch Potato is just such a guy as, when he hears the words fish in a
barrel, reaches for his pump-action shotgun -- especially when the
biggest fish are Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, and James Woods,
three of the most pretentious and phoney non-actors ever to swim across
the silver screen. There's just one problem: where do you shoot first?
Well, you could start with the bright idea of justifying a film full
of explosions (which, for Couch Potato's populist taste, requires no
justification at all) by making the hero, ex-CIA killer Sylvester
Stallone, an explosives expert -- but a nice one, who only kills really
bad people and doesn't approve of civilian collateral damage.
Then, to bring his talents into play, we have to have a revenge-bent
heroine (Sharon Stone -- her mum and dad got wasted by Miami drugs
lords) who eccentrically insists on hiring old Sly to zap the baddies
with small but perfectly formed bomblets.
''Hire a hit man'', Sly grunts.
''Bullets are imprecise'', Sharon breathes seductively. ''I hear you
shape your charges . . .''
Well, Shaz; we don't know about you, but the last time Couch Potato
had to kill someone, a .45 Magnum was plenty precise enough. Two in the
body, one in the brain: we always find the simple way is best.
And then there's chief baddie James Woods, shouting his way through a
performance strictly from a First Murderer role in a Naked Gun spoof;
Eric Roberts, whose idea of villainy consists of narrowing his eyes and
sneering a lot; Sharon Stone showing her shape in the most risible sex
scene since Madonna's last picture; and a plot shot full of more holes
than John Lennon said there were in Blackburn, Lancashire. Enjoy the
money, Shaz; after this and Sliver, it's back to straight-to-video hell
for you.

IT would be easy to call Stanley Donen a Hollywood legend. But legends
tend to be dead. Mr Donen is still with us, still working. It would also
be inaccurate. Not all of his films were made in Hollywood. Some were
shot in Britain during the Swinging Sixties, in which he was a leading
player.
Rather, Donen is a cinema icon, one of the great directors of the
Hollywood musical. But he is more, because his non-musical films include
one of the cinema's greatest romantic comedy thrillers, Charade. Nor is
he simply Gene Kelly's other half. With Kelly he made the greatest
Hollywood musical, Singing in the Rain, and the mould-breaking Wonderful
Town, but on his own he was responsible for Funny Face, one of Fred
Astaire's most accomplished films, and that sparkling hymn to dance and
the frontier life, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
He started on Broadway as a chorus boy in the original production of
Rodgers's and Hart's Pal Joey, in which Kelly played Joey. He was also
in a show called Best Foot Forward, which Kelly choreographed, and acted
as his assistant. ''That was back in 1941,'' Donen said. ''I
choreographed or acted in films until 1947, that is how I got started. I
grew up in South Carolina -- I was born in Columbia, the state capital
-- and I liked to go to the movies. In 1933 I saw Flying Down to Rio and
said to myself -- I would like to have some connection with that world.
I told my father and mother I wanted to study dancing and they did not
find that an extraordinary request. I studied dance until I finished
high school, then, aged 16, went to New York intending to go into the
theatre. I went there because it was nearer to South Carolina than Los
Angeles.''
I suggested it was brave, having established himself in New York, to
up sticks in 1942 and go to Hollywood. ''It did not seem brave and
adventurous at the time,'' he said. ''Nobody asked me to go, I just
went. I was 17 and as a young man you have nothing to lose.''
So he landed in Hollywood in the forties, a time when musicals were
spilling off the soundstages. How did he fare? ''There were a lot of
musical films being made -- it was World War Two at the time -- because
people needed cheering up, and I worked on a number of films, as a
dancer or assistant choreographer, until 1944, when Gene was employed to
be in Cover Girl by Columbia, and asked if I would like to help
choreograph the musical numbers. He said to Columbia -- Please get that
man. They did.''
He doubled for Kelly when they were preparing the complicated shoot
for the famous number in which he dances with his reflection in a shop
window. One of the things Kelly is required to do is slide down a
fireman's pole and Donen had to go first. Saul Chaplin, who scored the
film, recalls that Donen was a slower dancer than Kelly, prompting
shouts on set of -- ''Hey Stanley, move your fat ass.'' Donen is not
amused. ''It was said, if Solly says it was,'' he sighed. ''I suppose I
must have made an impression.''
He denied that they got up to anything unusual in the film. ''We were
just thinking of things to do, although I suppose they were different
from most musical numbers then. The result is not for us to judge. When
you are writing a piece you are not thinking of the result, you are
thinking of the next word.''
It is a modesty which is becoming, if slightly annoying, because it
denies the reality, there on film for all to see. It was new. It was
exciting. The Donen-Kelly partnership, which ended after It's Always
Fair Weather in 1955, broke conventions in every film it made.
''I think some of my films are good, some have good things in them,''
he said. ''Making films is a living. It is my interest, not that I am
only interested in musicals -- I like non-musicals equally as much.
Making films you put your head down, do the best you can, and see what
comes out. You never know how it is going to be received. Things also
change. My judgment changes. Films I thought were good in the forties, I
look at now and think they were not very good, but occasionally I find
something I did not particularly like then which I now like a lot. One's
outlook, one's values, one's understanding changes. I don't have a
favourite film and I am embarrassed by some of them.''
Frank Sinatra, a regular Donen star in Anchors Aweigh, On the Town,
and The Kissing Bandit, danced. How he had coped? ''Frank could move a
bit,'' he said. ''He was not a trained dancer in any sense, and I think
the only time he tried to dance was in those movies he made with Gene,
but he was a very tiny little fellow -- if you want to dance, small is a
big advantage. The only tall dancer I know of is Tommy Tune. The bigger,
the taller you are as a dancer, the more difficult it is. That is why
all those ballet dancers are like matchsticks. They can move. We
tailored the movements to the things Frank could do. He was also pretty
young and youth is a great advantage. We were all young then. We are
talking about 1947. I was 23 and he was probably 30. Young and light.
There is something winning about a young person, energetic, lively and
full of the joy of living that goes a long way.''
Audrey Hepburn, a regular Donen leading lady, a trained ballet dancer,
was terrified when asked to dance with Astaire in Funny Face, as anyone
would be, he said. ''I suppose Fred was a perfectionist, but then all of
us who choose a narrow field to spend our lives in are serious. We want
what we do to be the very best. That is where we put our gifts, our
intelligence, our love. He wanted what he did to be terrific. We also
have this terrible fear of failure. Fred had it. I have it. Gene has it.
We all have that fear of not being wonderful. It is quite a thing to put
yourself up in front of a lot of people and say -- Watch this, you will
have a good time.''
Why he had hung up his dancing shoes? ''I never really liked
performing,'' he confessed. ''I am not someone who likes to be in front
of an audience. I danced in a few movies and three shows on Broadway,
but it was not something I really loved. I was always worrying I was not
good enough. It was probably fear that stopped me from performing. It
was a pleasure not to have to do it. That was why I stopped.''
In the MGM days they had a routine. They would rehearse the big
numbers first, film them, and then turn to the numbers involving only
the stars and repeat the process, he said. ''Most of the people were on
contract to MGM so we could start and stop. Nowadays, that kind of
schedule is difficult because you are not allowed to drop the crew and
pick them up, you have to hang on to them. But even then money was the
king. You have to organise a movie depending on what it is going to cost
to do it. Economy is always the determinant.
''That is why they didn't want us to go on location for On The Town,
for any musical. To have to put everyone up in an hotel and then have
them stop while you move the truck from location A to location B. That
was why Seven Brides is not shot where it should be shot -- on location
-- but in the studio. It takes place over a number of seasons and to
have filmed in real locations would have meant shooting in snow and then
waiting for the spring, an impossible schedule to keep.
''In spite of that I tried my utmost to get it made on location, but
the studio did not think much of the film -- while we were making it.
They were more excited about Brigadoon which was meant to be that year's
big musical.''
He said the studios in general made money and were not as terrified of
making pictures as today's production companies. ''The same people owned
the studios, the actors and the theatres and there was no television. It
was a good business. There was only one picture held up as an example of
what could go wrong, a Clark Gable movie called Parnell which was a
disaster. Everything else was either OK or good. They used to be scared
they were going to have another Parnell on their hands.''
What went wrong with the musical? ''A lot of things, first television,
and then in terms of foreign revenues they made less because of the
problem of dubbing,'' he said. ''When you had Astaire or Garland singing
they could not be dubbed so the songs were in English and audiences did
not like that. Before television there was enough revenue from the
English-speaking world to make them viable. Then the studios lost the
theatres after they passed a law in America saying they could not own
them. So the spiral starts. You say there are not any people to make
musicals, nobody has any experience, there hasn't been an orchestra in
20 years -- a lot of things. Look at what has happened to Andrew Lloyd
Webber, only Jesus Christ Superstar got made, although I think Alan
Parker, a good director, is going to do Evita.
''Musicals take more than saying 'let's make one'. You have to have
the people who can do them. It is a very specialised field. They require
artists who have musical gifts. The Western has survived because they
are really just adventure stories. The studios made the musical stars,
which is why there are no musical stars today to speak of.''
Were there any musicals he would have liked to have done? ''I wanted
to do My Fair Lady very much. I asked to do it -- and I never got an
answer. Yes, there are musicals I wanted to make. I would still like to
do a musical, but it is more difficult now. We used to say -- Who will
be in it? Fred, Gene, Judy? There is nobody now. You wonder -- Will I
get the money? Will I waste two years trying? I don't have many
two-years left to waste.''
Donen's non-musical films include the romance, Indiscreet, with Cary
Grant and Ingrid Bergman, and the thrillers, Charade, with Hepburn and
Grant, and Arabesque with Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren. ''I liked
making films that are not musicals, and I think Charade a good movie. I
wanted to make a story about a woman in jeopardy and I was fortunate
enough to get Audrey, after which I had to get someone wonderful to be
the man. I did. Cary was terrific. We had a long time working together
and remained friends to the end of his life. Cary was a very gifted
actor, a good friend, a good collaborator and I am happy I was able to
work with him as often as I did.''
I wondered, dragging the subject back to musicals, how he found
working with dancers. ''They are a race apart,'' he said. ''They are
used to being told do this and they accept that. They look, they try,
they are like sponges. That is the nature of the dancer, male or female.
They want to put themselves into this movement and give themselves over
to much more than actors who have often to be convinced. Dancers just do
it. They try it. They throw themselves into it.''

THE Child Support Agency, which has gained a reputation for draconian
action against estranged husbands, is understaffed, according to Mr
Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty, and Skye.
Speaking of his frustration in making progress with constituents'
cases, Mr Kennedy said the agency's chronic inability to get maintenance
payments out of reluctant ex-husbands and partners could be solved only
by the Government agreeing to staff it properly.
''It is quite clear to me that in most cases the staff are being
worked into the ground and everybody is suffering,'' he said.
Mr Kennedy cited one case, which he had passed to the Parliamentary
Ombudsman to investigate for maladministration. It concerned a Ms
Margaret McGlennon, 34, who was trying to rebuild a life with her three
young daughters in Lochalsh.
Ms McGlennon approached the CSA in June 1993 for help in securing
maintenance payments from her husband, a self-employed tradesman from
whom she was officially separated.
Yesterday, exactly two years later, Ms McGlennon still had not
received a penny.
She told The Herald: ''I do a bit of supply teaching but that is very
erratic and so I have had to depend on monthly child benefit. It has
been a real struggle. I now have a partner but that is recent.''
Things seemed to be moving when a CSA official wrote to Ms McGlennon
on February 27 this year: ''I have checked your application and I would
like to apologise on behalf of the agency for the delay you have
experienced so far.
''Although there has been a significant delay in actioning your
application, your husband was issued with an inquiry form in October,
1993, so any assessment will be backdated to then.''
According to subsequent correspondence, the relevant information was
not forthcoming from her ex-husband and an interim maintenance
assessment was imposed upon him on March 20 for #121.65 a week. Still no
money appeared.
It later transpired that this assessment had been wrongly imposed, as
the required information had been supplied all along but had been
mislaid.
Ms McGlennon said yesterday: ''I really am desperate. I just seem to
be getting nowhere, going round in circles.''
Contacted yesterday, a CSA spokesman said: ''The agency very much
regrets any distress caused to Ms McGlennon. We are processing this case
as quickly as possible and we will be getting in touch with her. But I
have to leave it at that.''

A MAN who stabbed a convicted sex offender was yesterday found guilty
of culpable homicide.
Paul Strathearn, 33, was cleared at the High Court in Edinburgh of
murdering Lawrence Leydon, a 36-year-old joiner, on February 11.
Leydon was found dying in his ''pigsty'' flat at Southhouse Medway,
Edinburgh, where, earlier, health officials and police had removed 39
maggot-filled refuse bags.
Pathologists found eight stab wounds and said that a large knife had
been plunged repeatedly into Leydon's heart, lungs, and liver.
Strathearn, who was staying at the time in Balfour Street, Leith, said
in evidence that he had chased Leydon, who had shouted taunts and abuse
at him in the street.
Strathearn, a builder's labourer, said he kicked in the door of
Leydon's flat. ''Something snapped in my head. It was as if I was
watching someone else being very violent. I did not look at him
afterwards. I walked out of the house and down the stairs. I remember
stopping outside a cemetery thinking about what I had done.''
He claimed he did not realise he had killed Leydon until he heard a
radio news bulletin next morning.
The court heard evidence stating that, in April last year, Leydon had
been placed on probation for two years after admitting a sex offence.
Lord Prosser continued yesterday's case until July 21 for background
and medical reports.

Joe Donnelly looks at a new way of getting on your bike which is
tailor-made for the individual and at hi-tech advances which should make
being a car passenger a whole lot safer.
WHEN Norman Tebbit said ''On your bike'', we can be sure he envisaged
nothing like this. It's the Tectrix VR Bike which brings virtual reality
to the world of fitness. Developed by Forza Fitness Equipment, it lets
you get fit by going plenty of places without actually getting anywhere.
''It's cycle-logical,'' puns Forza M D David Giampaolo. He believes
that more people will spend time in the gym when they realise that
exercise is fun and healthy. Once they have taken the VR track they will
be more disposed towards training.
From the ergonomically designed seat in front of a 20-inch colour
monitor, the exercisee can choose to take four bike paths, or even leave
the path behind and head for the hills, mountain-bike style, riding
through valleys on dirt-tracks, grass, or asphalt.
All of the experience is from a compact disc which stores the virtual
sights and sounds. Changing workout worlds is as simple as changing the
CD. There are different levels of difficulty, uphill and downhill
variations, steering and gear-changing.
Not only is it visual, but a fan blows a light breeze across the face
(and maybe that's why the cyclist in the picture isn't lacquered in
perspiration) and gets stronger the faster one virtually travels. As
every cyclist knows, the wind is always in your face, so this is more
real; than virtual. Sound, played on a stereo track through speakers,
and movement complete the illusion.
One other innovation. The VR bike can network link to several other
machines at once so that riders can exercise in groups, or even race in
competition.
It beats being head-down and wheel-to-wheel in a sweating clot of
cyclists on a busy road, and we're told there is absolutely no chance of
a puncture.
Maybe that's why she looks to darned happy. She also looks as if she's
the last person to actually need an exercise bike. Technically speaking,
we're just jealous.
* RENAULT are bringing out a new safety-belt system which they believe
will; drastically cut belt-pressure injuries in road accidents.
The unique Renault Programmed Restraint System is a load limiter which
has been added to the already standard pre-tensioner and lock-on inertia
reel and will soon be fitted as standard on all models at no extra cost.
It limits the pressure on front-seat passengers in a frontal impact by
up to 50%.
In what seems a hi-tech altruistic move, Renault say they are not
applying for a patent to restrict their system to Renault cars. The
technology will be made available to other manufacturers for them to
improve levels of safety in their own cars.
The company also say that by making the limiter available across the
entire range they will provide all front-seat passengers with the best
possible protection in the case of a head-on crash, the most common of
all accidents.
The system works by tightening the inertia seat belt during the first
phase of the accident. Movement of the belt is limited to 20
millimetres. The strain on the belt is then transmitted to a load
limiter, a piece of steel made of strips which are designed to tear
apart down a series of seams. This progressive tearing makes the reel
blocker move vertically and the amount of travel reduces the belt
tension by exactly the right amount to relieve extreme pressure on the
head, neck, and throat.
Renault say their biomedical department's accident research has shown
that most frontal impacts result in chest injuries for front-seat
passengers. Their system was designed and developed in less than a year
using computer-simulation and mathematical models.
* SELF-SERVICE is taking on a new meaning at Safeway. They're piloting
an electronic system which allows customers to act as check-out
operators.
The serve-yourself price-checking involves an electronic scanner which
customers can unload using a smart card. The device is clipped on the
front of a trolley and as they wheel it up and down the aisles each
purchase is scanned and bar-coded.
The system even allows shoppers to change their minds if they want to
-- they simply scan the item and put it back on the shelf. The cost will
automatically be deducted from the total bill.
At the end of the shopping trip, the scanner is simply plugged in to a
receiving computer system which prints out a detailed receipt and total
bill which would then be handed to a cashier and settled, most probably
by plastic.
Safeway's M D Patrick Kieran tells us: ''This will make shopping
easier for our customers. It will eliminate the more time-consuming
processes like queuing at the checkout and unloading and reloading
trolleys.''
Trials of the system are set to take place in a Scottish store soon.
The supermarket chain naturally realise some absent-minded folk might
forget to log in a purchase or two as they browse the store, so random
checks will be carried out on shopping trolleys to make sure all goods
are being paid for, so the only swiping presumably will be the bar-code
past the scanner.
The system could put an end to those long and tedious queues at peak
times, which form even at the express checkouts. But can it ever replace
that friendly checkout smile?

* DON'T count your alligators before they've hatched. And your
chickens might opt for a sex-change inside the egg . . . Sounds
confusing, but all should be explained at tomorrow's Royal Highland
Show.
The Scottish Agricultural College will be at Stoneleigh's main ring
where their scientists will do their best to shed light on some of their
more arcane work. Part of that will be the research into alligator and
ostrich embryos, which is set to have a beneficial effect, believe it or
not, on the poultry business. Possibly there will be greater benefits
for mankind.
SAC's biochemical scientists under Ray Noble were first interested in
whether alligators and chickens had any common mechanisms, egg-wise.
Basically, research on alligator embryos inside the egg showed that
incubating at different temperatures changes the sex of the offspring.
Some basic research has now resulted in sex reversal in chickens,
which could offer considerable advantages to the meat and egg trades. If
you can ensure your chick will not crow the break of day, but hatch out
as a young broiler, there's surely an advantage.
You might say it's all a croc. We would say it's a 'gator. If the same
thing works with humans, then there's always the electric blanket.
Work on the big-toothed reptiles has also shown some promising and
fascinating results.  Professor Mark Ferguson, dean of biological
sciences in Manchester, and chairman of the technology foresight panel
on health and life sciences, has found that they could hold the key to a
major benefit for humans.
Professor Ferguson's work in understanding birth defects, especially
cleft palates, led him to look at an animal model and he discovered the
alligator which, no matter how improbable, has the same palate structure
as humans. This led to the egg and sex-change discovery.
The work on embryos has now discovered that alligator embryos heal
without scarring after surgery. Now the pharmaceutical industry has
taken up the results of the research and is working on new treatments to
prevent post-op scarring in humans.
Back to the Royal Highland Show,  visitors will hopefully have a
chance to test a new commercial extract which may keep the dread Scots
midge  at bay. Developed by Stan Deans of Auchincruive from an active
ingredient of myrtle oil, trials are now underway. Andy Evans of the SAC
in Edinburgh has also been working on ways to confuse insect pests  and
has devised ways of measuring the extent to which bugs are repelled by
particular scents.
Maybe the midge can really be scent off after all.

<TEXT>
MORE than 700 workers at Allied Distillers in Dumbarton have voted by
a ''massive majority'' against accepting a 4% wage rise, but they are
putting the offer on ice until after their annual Fair holidays.
The offer, which also involves a one-off #300 sum, enhanced paternity
and bereavement leave, and a #50,000 contribution towards creche
facilities, has been made to buy out old customs associated with the
whisky industry.
These include set teabreaks and #8 a week for the time workers take to
walk from the car park to their workplace.
Mr Willie Moffat, GMB Scotland shop steward, said: ''The management
want to introduce things which will see the whisky industry break away
from tradition and take on production practices used in Japan and
America. It is these things that the members find unacceptable and view
with suspicion.''
Allied Distillers recently announced 200 redundancies nationwide, as
part of a restructuring plan involving the changes in work practices.

Digging, building, restoring . . . not everyone's idea of a holiday
perhaps but conservation projects are becoming increasingly popular
choices, as Doreen Taylor-Wilkie discovers.
IF your heaviest normal exercise is tapping a keyboard or cutting the
grass, it can be a bit of a culture shock to pick up a spade or take a
turn at drystane-diking on a conservation project. Yet ever-growing
numbers of people are choosing to work hard on holiday. Certainly, the
sense of achievement is superb and the scenery almost always wild and
wonderful, with plants everywhere and birds soaring overhead.
Scottish Conservation Projects (SCP) has a full programme from July to
December, as well as earlier spring work. The seven-to-14-day breaks
range from upgrading footpaths, and building a footbridge on the
Glenlivet Estate, a high-level 50,000 acres -- very convenient for an
off-duty whisky trail -- to helping the restoration of the old
Caledonian Pine forest in Glen Orchy. Here ecologists and botanists are
particularly welcome, as is sheer muscle in gouging out Sitka spruce.
Closer to the Central Belt are restoration of the Old Pentland Cemetery
in Midlothian, work on the Southern Upland Way, and many more sites.
Accommodation ranges from outdoor centres to remote bothies without
running water. Food is plentiful, there is a day off a week and, where
applicable, the trust grades the projects as remote or strenuous. The
British Trust for Conservation Volunteers in Oxfordshire provides
similar work further south, and also arranges some conservation working
holidays overseas.
Scottish Conservation Projects works on some Historic Scotland sites,
such as Thirlestane Hill Fort in the Borders, a prehistoric fort of
earth and stone with ramparts round an inner area. It is being managed
to prevent further damage to the fort without spoiling its wildlife
value. Gradually, SCP is getting rid of the rosebay willowherb, elder
scrub, and bracken which have swarmed into the old fort, and the plan is
also to fence it against rabbits. This all gives a good chance to learn
the techniques of hand-felling and fencing.
The National Trust for Scotland runs Thistle Camps from April to
October, for work on NTS properties which otherwise could not be done.
There are camps in many parts of Scotland where volunteers work on
habitat management (in plain terms, clearing scrub and bracken),
cleaning out ponds and repairing dykes in NTS properties such as Threave
Castle, near Castle Douglas in Galloway. Volunteers could find
themselves opening up a new area of walled garden at Brodick on Arran,
or looking after and improving historic marble working machinery on
Iona, and repairing the jetty at the NTS's Balmacara property. The
National Trust has similar Acorn Camps in England, Wales, and Northern
Ireland.
The Waterway Recovery Group and the Inland Waterways Association has
been involved in restoring the once-great network of canals since 1970,
largely through week-long canal camps throughout the year. Complete with
hard hats, volunteers do everything from cleaning out years-old black
slime, to restoring industrial archaeology, or cooking for 20 ravenous
volunteers.
Most of these holidays ask for age ranges between 16 and 70.
Volunteers make a contribution to their keep -- up to #35 a week -- and
must get to the pick-up point under their own steam. For most projects,
you need to be fit rather than super-strong, though SCP's site on Rum
does call for long, high-level walks, and the NTS camp at West Affric
means a two-and-a-half-hour walk at each end of the week.

* COMBINING the lightest suitcase possible with a wish to appear
presentable is one of the great travel dilemmas, so the Penrith company
in Cumbria, which makes clothes that pack light and look good, is a rare
find. Its name is appropriately Travelling Light, and the summer
catalogue ranges wide. There are outfits that would do you proud at a
palace or party, with some beautiful new Indian dresses, beachwear, the
sort of comfortable shoes that could walk a desert, plus adaptors and
health aids, and emergency kits of every sort. All the clothes can be
mixed and matched.
This comprehensive catalogue favours women but includes men's clothes
too. Everything is designed for easy laundering, often without the need
of an iron. Best of all, this specialist company offers a
made-to-measure service for non-standard sizes. Details/catalogue:
01931-714488.
* FRANCE has moved with great expertise into that British speciality,
bed and breakfast, with a first comprehensive guide, Bed and Breakfast
(France), put out by l'Association BAB France. It lists and grades
accommodation from the simple family home (often with family rooms where
visitors stay for as little as 37.60 francs per person per night) to the
great chateaux, which open their elegant doors, for between 150 francs
to 1325 francs per person. Well-organised travellers who know where they
are going can book in advance. Wanderers can do it themselves, on the
spot. Details and bookings from BAB France's International Reservations
Centre: 01491 578 803, which supplies the guide at #3.50+p/p. Also sold
in bookshops.
* STILL in France, Rosetta Cantlie, who has lived in many different
countries, now runs Dinner Party Cookery Courses and Wine Safari Weeks
in the heart of the Dordogne. But there is nothing of ''back-to-school''
in Mrs Cantlie's weeks at Le Touron, her home in France. They are
designed as country house parties in this lovely old farmhouse. Bruce
and Rosetta Cantlie have restored all the original fireplaces, and
furnished their home with French and English antiques. The purpose in
both cookery and wine is to give their guests an enjoyable holiday, and
the cookery day finishes at 12.30, with plenty of time to explore, or
fish, or play golf. To make it a true house party, the Cantlies may well
invite their own local friends for lunch or dinner to meet the guests.

* RETURNING to an environmental theme, it is hard to imagine a taxi
that does not make a noise or a smell! But it is about to become a fact
in Graz in Austria. This autumn, the Radio Taxi Group 878 will be
testing a new Mercedes electric taxi. In the hope of getting over the
problem of the time it takes to charge an electric vehicle, the taxi
group is adapting its taxi ranks so that drivers can ''fill up''
whenever they are sitting waiting. What a relief in crowded city centres
if the idea caught on!

LABOUR deputy leader John Prescott said yesterday that his party
organisation was prepared for a snap election if the Tory leadership
crisis spun out of control.
Mr Prescott was speaking in Aberdeen as part of a membership drive
which had turned into a campaign to put his troops on a war footing.
''We don't care who leads this crowd of clowns,'' was his assessment of
the Conservative leadership competition.
He said his party had added 100,000 new members over the past year and
had boosted membership by 40% in Scotland. He added that the party would
have candidates in every constituency if the Conservatives called a snap
election.
''John Major has made a terrible blunder and far from creating a
healing process he has created a party in which members are tearing each
other apart.''
He said a million people had been involved in electing Mr Tony Blair
and himself to lead the Labour Party, adding: ''That contrasts with
300-odd voting for the Tory leadership now. Where does that leave their
arguments about democracy?''
He accused the Tories of pursuing narrow, party interests instead of
Britain's national interests in the course of their current leadership
campaign. Mr Prescott pledged that, whatever happened at Westminster,
Labour would keep the pressure up on policy areas such as rail
privatisation, the health service, and employment.

<HEADLINE>Scots reassured they are not at risk after blood scare</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977617088</RECORDNO>

SCOTTISH health officials moved yesterday to calm fears over blood
shortages caused by the withdrawal of faulty batches of blood in
England.
Yesterday, the English-based National Blood Authority recalled several
thousand pints of blood from hospitals -- 10-15% of national stock --
after faults were discovered in the heat seal of some batches.
The John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford had to cancel operations and
others may have to do the same, a spokeswoman for NBA admitted. She said
it was a ''significant proportion'' but ''not a major crisis''.
She added that up to 5000 extra donors would be needed over the next
three days to replenish stocks.
However, a spokeswoman for the Scottish National Blood Transfusion
Service said there was no problem with blood supplies in Scotland.
''Although we use the same bags, we have not identified the fault here
and not withdrawn any stocks,'' she told The Herald.
''We are fairly self sufficient with blood products but do share
resources in emergency situations.
''I imagine other English regions will help out with the problem down
south but we will obviously lend a hand if called upon to do so.
''But most importantly I must reassure any patient entering hospital
in Scotland that there is no shortage of blood products and no
operations are being postponed.''
Meanwhile, the NBA was accused of cost-cutting over the leaking blood
bags, imported from Australia.
Senior officials in blood transfusion centres said NBA management had
rushed through approval of the bags too quickly, in order to inject
competition and save money.
Shadow Health Minister Tessa Jowell said: ''Despite warnings from
technical staff, the NBA ploughed ahead because cost-cutting and
competition were deemed more important.''
Until the problem is resolved, the NBA will not use bags produced by
Tuta, which supplied the faulty batches.
''We are discussing the problem with the manufacturer,'' said an NBA
spokeswoman. ''It's the first time this sort of fault has been
discovered.''
Dr Angela Robinson, NBA medical director, said low storage temperature
meant contamination was ''highly unlikely''. No reports had been
received of any infection in patients who might have received blood from
faulty bags, she added.
The NBA, which took over the old National Blood Transfusion Service on
April 1, 1993, was also at the centre of a row earlier this year over
plans to close a third of Britain's blood banks.

BALTIMORE . . . Randy Newman wrote about it. Babe Ruth was born in it.
Billie Holiday lived in it. You could stretch a point and call it
America's Glasgow, a tough, blue-collar city whose economy relied in the
past upon heavy engineering; which once boasted a thriving shipbuilding
industry. But now they've gone, replaced by cafes and bars and fancy
restaurants. By yuppies in trendy apartments created from the concrete
skeletons of dockside warehouses. By shopping malls and shiny happy
people.
And yet, underneath the urban veneer, there remains a city with a
dangerous edge. And it is that edge which distinguished movie director
Barry Levinson targets in Homicide: Life On The Streets, his
virtual-reality cop show which returns for a second series on Channel
Four on Monday. It is the darkest, most downbeat, policier of them all.
Like NYPD Blue with even more attitude.
Levinson, who made Disclosure and Rainman, is no stranger to
Baltimore. He was born and brought up in its heart. And he made a loose
trilogy of movies (Diner, Tin Men, and Avalon) about the city. With
Homicide he explores its blackest, bleakest, corners.
Centred on a team of murder-squad detectives it takes a
fly-on-the-wall approach, making fiction as factual as possible, by
following each homicide case as it is reported, investigated, and
(occasionally) solved. The new series opens in customary stark mode with
a serial killer who leaves his victims naked except for white-cotton
gloves. Subsequent episodes feature a teenager who shoots his own
brother and the shocking apparent suicide of one of the detectives in
the squad.
The greatest strength of the first series was to remove unnecessary
emotion and sensation from the dramatic equation. Cinema verite
techniques and the sheer believability of the scripts served to
transform the ordinary into the extraordinary.
Ironically, this sombre, low-key, and essentially humourless,
approach, which was Homicide's hallmark not to mention its selling
point, was too much of a challenge for America's often shallow,
thrill-seeking, short-attention-span television audience. Though
acclaimed by the critics it was largely ignored by the viewers who found
its high intensity a turn-off. But Levinson's experience and talent, his
combination of style and substance, has assured its success and, in the
process, secured its future.
Nevertheless, concessions have obviously been made for the second
series. There is a perceptibly lighter touch this time round. While
previously it concentrated on the reality, even the mundanity, of
day-to-day police work, now it allows the personality of the characters
to develop. The result is a more conventional show.
When the forthcoming series was shown in America earlier this year the
ratings increased significantly. Critics put this down to two reasons.
The first was a shocking and explosive storyline, stretching over four
episodes which placed a question mark over the lives of three of the
detectives (I'll reveal no more for fear of spoiling the plot). The
second was a sub-plot, running through the whole series and centred on a
local bar which some of the characters bought and ran; a neat device to
inject some welcome comic relief.
Still, it remains an acquired taste. Partly because of the way it is
structured (it's as much a serial as a series and the danger is that, if
you miss a couple of episodes, then you begin to lose the thread),
Homicide is not an easy programme to get to know. There is a peculiar
depth and subtlety to it and it takes time to appreciate the characters
involved.
Its stars Yaphet Kotto as Lieutenant Giardello, the black-Italian
squad boss; Ned Beatty as Stanley Bollander, the overweight and
world-weary detective who's nearing retirement; and Daniel Baldwin
(brother of James and Alec) as streetwise Detective Beau Felton.
But the strongest character is Detective Frank Pembleton (a powerful
performance from black actor Andre Braugher), a flamboyant and
intelligent loner, distanced from his colleagues through his often cold,
over-sensitive, and aloof attitude. As the second series develops,
Pembleton and his wife are stalked by an ex-con who holds a grudge
against him.
In Monday's opening episode the squad is drafted in to back up a new
shift commander, Lt Megan Russert (Isabella Hofmann), in the search for
a brutal killer after the naked body of the woman, recent winner of the
city's ''Good Samaritan of the Year'' award, is found behind a church.
Levinson's involvement in Homicide -- not only did he create it but he
has directed some of the episodes and is an executive producer for the
series -- is part of a growing crossover trend between movies and
television in America. Michael Crichton, author of Jurassic Park and
Disclosure and a movie director in the dim and distant past, created the
top-rated ER while Pulp Fiction maestro Quentin Tarantino directed one
of its episodes. In addition, Steven Spielberg has also increased his
involvement in television work over recent years.
Homicide, which takes over Channel Four's Monday night drama slot from
NYPD Blue, adds to its enviable roster of American imports. New viewers
can play catch-up when the last episode (with a guest appearance from
Robin Williams) from the previous series is repeated tomorrow night.
SOME things are worthy of celebration. Co-inciding with the 150th
anniversary of the birth of Thomas Barnardo, the BBC presents a three
part documentary series on the organisation which he founded. Barnardo's
Children (BBC1, Tuesday) is an honest, emotionally-charged, but
nonetheless fitting tribute to the creator of one of Britain's
best-loved charities.
If nothing else, the series helps to explode the myths. Mention Dr
Barnardo and immediatly the images of orphans, children's homes, and
little cottage-shaped papier-mache collecting boxes spring to most
minds. But the truth is that only a few of the 300,000 children who have
been in Barnardo's care since it was set up in 1866 were orphans. The
last home closed in 1981.
By the time he died (in 1905) Barnardo's had become affectionately
known as the largest family in the world. He had by then helped more
than 60,000 destitute children. Many, if not most, of them had grown up
in the belief that their parents were dead; that they were orphans. But
the truth was that they had been taken into Barnardo's care because
their parents were unable -- or unwilling -- to look after them.
Sometimes the reason was poverty or ill health but often it was simply
because the child was illegitimate.
Thomas Barnardo was willing, even eager, to allow these children to
grow up as orphans. He believed that the best way to offer them a fresh
start in life was to draw a veil over their earliest memories. They were
encouraged to look forward, not back, and to see themselves as part of
Barnardo's family.
However, the policy left a disturbing legacy for many of the children
later in life. Even now, hundreds of them contact the charity's after
care department desperate to find out details of their early lives.
John Williams, a former Barnardo's boy interviewed in the series, was
placed in the home as a baby in 1948. He grew up believing that he was
completely alone in the world. ''You just took it for granted that you
didn't have a mother. You were aware that other children outside had
mothers and fathers but I never once questioned 'Why didn't I have a
mother?'''
The series reveals that John's mother wrote to the home in which he
stayed for the 18 years he was in care. He was never told. His story is
poignantly interwoven with a reunion of 12 former Barnardo's children 40
years after they grew up together.
In this week's programme, which combines archive film and personal
memories, a vivid and very moving picture is created of admission, of
life within the homes themselves, and of what it was like to eventually
leave for the world outside. It also shows how Barnardo's split brother
from sister because natural family ties were considered to be less
important than the physical well-being of the child.
It reveals how Barnardo, wary of the effects of institutionalisation,
began a scheme for fostering the children with working-class families.
It was also Barnardo's policy to send all children of school-leaving age
to a training home. This usually meant domestic service for girls and
simple trades, like carpentry or printing, for boys. Other children were
sent overseas. Between 1882 and 1967 almost 30,000 of them emigrated to
Canada and Australia.
The series also looks at the modern-day legacy of Thomas Barnardo. The
charity has changed beyond all recognition but its intentions remain the
same: to challenge disadvantage and create opportunity for young people.
Some things never change, of course. Poverty, neglect, and abuse existed
on the day Barnardo was born. Sadly, they still exist today.
The organisation is currently involved in more than 150 projects,
exemplified by its direct intervention team which helps the young
homeless in London. Project workers help young ''rent boys'' in the West
End, dispensing condoms and advice on protective sex. The wheel has
turned full circle because Dr Barnardo himself rescued prostitutes from
the streets of London.
FAMILIARITY with the phrase ''A consonant please, Carol,'' is
generally regarded as an early warning sign that you're watching far too
much television. It means that you are an avid fan of Channel Four's
weekday afternoon words and numbers game show, Countdown, which returns
for its 30th series on Monday with presenter Richard Whiteley and
celebrated washing-powder expert Carol Vorderman, the thinking man's
maths teacher.
And, while we're on the subject of quiz shows, a belated word of
welcome to Scottish Television's new and actually quite funny sports
quiz, A Game Of Two Halves (ITV, Thursday), which will leave you over
the moon/sick as a parrot (delete as necessary). Hosted by Scotsport
stalwart Jim White, it's like a cross between Sport In Question and Have
I Got News For You with a kilt on it. This week team captains Denis Law
and Tony Roper are joined by Tommy Burns and Andy Goram.
Brought up in
the heart of Baltimore, Levinson uses the show to explore its
blackest, bleakest, corners

It's a seething pot of smells, sounds, and sights all just waiting to
boil over. But, finds Cameron Simpson, once you've been smitten, the
dangers seem only to add to the attractions of Naples.
THE city comes gunning for you with magnum force as soon as you step
out of the Circumvesuviana railway station on to the raucous Corso
Garibaldi.
We are in Naples, the frontline city which is home to one million
volatile Neapolitans who live on the edge under the watchful eye of a
brooding big brother -- Mount Vesuvius.
Just like a volcano, the city explodes all around you with:
Its sights -- men in Armani armour, like bullet-proof vests against
poverty, strut their stuff with olive-skinned women with stungun looks,
while three streets away urchins from Dickens sit in Third World
poverty, heads bowed over begging bowls.
Its sounds -- Neapolitans chatter away like machine pistols set
permanently on automatic; police klaxons blare as if they think they are
in the Bronx and the traffic roars like a lion with a gigantic thorn
digging into its paw.
Its smells: ovens give birth by the minute to glorious bread,
wonderful baby pizzas; the tang of seafresh fish, squid and sardines
washes over you but cannot disguise the Mount Vesuviuses of rubbish that
in places threaten to erupt and engulf the city.
In short, Naples, if you haven't already guessed from the military
metaphors, is a town at war with itself.
With three out of every 10 men unemployed, petty crime is rampant. All
the guides tell you that when you come to this pressure-cooker city,
brought to the boil daily by the Mediterranean sun, that you should
leave your earrings and jewellery at home. The warning applies to women
too.
You are also advised to carry only as much money as you need for the
day. But don't worry: you don't need much and if you want to retreat
from the front line to the rear let me recommend the Hostaria Da
Raffaela on the Vico Quercia near the Via Toledo where a meal for two is
a modest #12.
It is, to parody a certain genre of guidebooks, ''an unprepossessing
little trattoria''. But what it has going for it is Raffael who has a
nice line is music-hall English and a collection of Sophia Loren's
greatest hits for background music.
But Raffael's biggest asset, apart from his burgeoning stomach, is his
cooking. We ate anchovies in olive-oil, so fresh that I swear they were
still squirming on the plate, spaghetti sorrentino (tomato and mozerella
sauce) mopped up by crusty bread and washed down by a bottle of the
local Lacryma Christi red wine, two beers, and a Coke. The bill came to
nearly #12 including tip.
But you would be advised to go sooner rather than later. With Vesuvius
ticking away like a time-bomb backstage the curtain could come down on
Naples any day. So look out your tin hat and go over the top. It would
be a great pity to miss it. It really is an experience of a lifetime.
The walk on the wild side of Naples is just one of many diamond
excursions to be made from the resort of Sorrento, the jewel in the
Neapolitan Riviera. It has a spectacular setting, perched high on a
cliff surrounded by citrus groves with dramatic views of the Bay of
Naples and the huge purple pyramid of Mount Vesuvius.
Capri is half an hour's boat ride away, while Pompeii is 20 kilometres
away, Positano 22, Amalfi 31, and Rome 240. It was one of the main
reasons we chose Sorrento. Unlike Odysseus who had himself lashed to the
mast of his ship to steel himself against the lure of the deadly
enchantresses, the Sirens, we just couldn't resist it.
By day you can wander the city's carefree streets and alleys which are
crammed with shops selling locally made leather, lace, and Capodimonte
porcelain then relax in the bustling pavement bars and cafes.
After dinner don't miss the free show on the main square, the Piazzo
Tasso, which is oh so Italian. It is in this square, with its decayed
nineteenth-century dignity, that the signors and signoras strut their
stuff. I don't know the exact rules of engagement but it seems the woman
with the biggest . . . shoulder pads is the winner.
Meanwhile, back in the men behaving badly competition hairy chests are
still in but the points go to the man who can make love most
convincingly . . . to his mobile telephone.
A few years ago it would have been a woman, but now in the Piazzo
Tasso with its high levels of testosterone and Testerossas, the men's
mouths spend their time nuzzling the necks of their cellular phones.
Remembering that in Italy bad driving is inculcated from birth, no-one
is quite sure what a red light is for, and car-body repair shops are big
business, I relay one conversation I overheard.
Bear in mind that my Italian is not so buono but it went something
like this: ''Si Luigi, I've just totalled the Testerossa. The fluffy
dice are OK though, so you can start rebuilding from there. Ciao.''
Finally, no holiday would be complete without a drive on the wild side
-- Sorrento to Amalfi along the cliff road by public bus. Try if you can
to get on the Sita bus with the driver who looks like Rasputin after a
hard night on the terracotta.
It is a stunning one-hour drive, along a road that clings for dear
life to the cliff by its fingertips. Forget the brake pedal and you
become an involuntary aeroplane with the Mediterranean 1500ft below a
deadly runway.
And forget the brake pedal was what our driver did as we raced round
corners and overtook other buses coming up to blind corners. In this
most Catholic of countries the bus began to sound like a moving
confessional box as passengers prepared to meet their maker. But the
view of Positano, where high-up whitewashed houses looked like banks of
clouds against the cliffside, and Amalfi, like a multi-layered,
multi-coloured wedding cake, made it all worthwhile.
As your hands are prised from your arm-rests and the heart stimulants
begin to kick in, there can be few finer places than Amalfi to spend the
day.
FACTFILE
* CAMERON Simpson travelled with Portland, the UK's leading direct
booking tour operator, and stayed at the Continental Hotel in Sorrento.
Portland reckons its prices are about 15 per cent cheaper because you
deal direct and avoid travel agents' commission.
One week's half-board at the Continental starts at #304 in May rising
to #383 in July and August. Portland claims the clifftop hotel is
four-star but really it seems far more like five. It has 80 bedrooms on
four floors and some of the best views of Sorrento. Dinner dances on
Thursday are a hoot and the highlight of the week. A lift allows access

It may seem like a sleepy little place, but Jim Hewitson has a few
revealing tales to tell about Brechin.
BRECHIN is a fine wee market town, inland from Montrose, with a
pleasant High Street, cheerful citizens, an impressive Cathedral,
historic round tower and a football team which will see better days
despite being overshadowed at the moment by their bridie-champing
neebors down the A90.
Quarter of a century ago I occasionally used the royal burgh as a pit
stop on the long drive north and came to regard this Angus community as
a model of Scottish rural tranquillity, the sort of place you could
happily settle when the creaky years overtook you.
But haud on a mo', there is another, less salubrious, distinctly
unsettling side to this most pleasant of locations. Before the present
population get ready with the writs, I should point out swiftly that the
bad burghers who have come to my attention have been occupants of the
kirkyard these several centuries past.
Information on the other face of Brechin was drawn from the journals
of Richard Bannatyne, secretary to John Knox who, in the 1570s (God
bless his sober, Presbyterian socks) was wont to note in his journal of
transactions all sorts of obscure bits of trivia as well as entries
outlining the momentous events in newly-Reformed Scotland.
Brechin was always an important watering hole, a stopping-off point on
the road between Aberdeen and the south and in medieval times the burgh
was able to boast a number of inns and lodging houses.
At one such establishment it was discovered in 1571 that dirty deeds
had been done. From Bannatyne we learn that just before Christmas of
that year ''one that keepit ane hostelry at Brechin'' had been taken
into custody for mass murder. His wife was apparently behind bars on the
same charge.
Over a long number of years the couple had been disposing of guests
who had come to lodge with them and pocketing their valuables.
After an evening of hospitality in front of the fire travellers would
retire to their rooms well-lubricated and lapse into an intoxicated
slumber. The innkeeper then arrived on the scene to batter them on the
head and remove their possessions. According to Bannatyne, the wife had
been ''as busy as the man with the mell (mallet)''. The number of
victims was never estimated but what is certain is that the affair did
nothing for the burgh's tourist image.
In 1600 Pitcairn's Criminal Trials record some equally bizarre, if
marginally less-sinister, goings-on in and around Brechin.
George Dempster, son of David Dempster, a citizen of the burgh, was
charged with striking an ox belonging to Thomas Collace while the beast
was standing in the ploughshare. The reason for this odd assault is not
given but after conviction Dempster was held in the Tolbooth in
Edinburgh before being banished for life and warned that returning
without permission would result in the death penalty.
Assuredly, the sort of sentence our animal rights lobby would heartily
approve of.
The following year Thomas Bellie, burgess of Brechin, and his son
James were summoned for ''bying, having and keeping of poysoune, mixing
it with dough and throwing it into Janet Clerk's yard in Brechin for the
destruction of fowlis''.
What had Janet, or her chickens, been up to in order to provoke this
vicious assault? We'll never know, but Thomas and his son were also
banished, again under pain of death.
And then again there's the ''Devil's Hollow'' and all its diabolic
possibilities. But that's a tale for another day. Brechin, sleepy hollow
by the Esk, don't you believe it.

Statistical quirks
present a bogus
picture of the best
places to live
in Britain, as
Stephen McGinty discovers
QUESTION: where is the best place to live in the United Kingdom in
relation to crime? Answer: Northern Ireland. Honest. Top Towns, the
newly published Guinness guide to finding the best places to live in
Britain, throws a whole new light on urban preconceptions, but none
quite as blinding as the Northern Ireland revelation.
The province's pole position in the crimeless league (up there with
the London borough of Havering and the Highlands) is based on 1993
figures. And the reason for its success is . . . The Troubles.
The winning formula was calculated from the population per police
officer, the number of recorded crimes per 1000 people, burglaries per
1000 people, and acts of violence per 1000 people. In Northern Ireland
the heavy police presence, matched with terrorist punishment squads,
resulted in few reported crimes.
It's a false picture, but just one of the many surprising outlooks
designed to offer people an objective guide to the towns, cities,
metropolitan boroughs, and counties of the United Kingdom.
Crime is just one of 10 subjects examined in the book which aims to
provide a guide for the 400,000 households which each year move more
than 80km to find work, a new start or a place to retire. The other
subjects include environment, local government, jobs and prices,
transport, health and fitness, arts and culture, education, housing, and
recreation and shopping. Britain is sub-divided into 128 towns,
boroughs, and counties, with Scotland tackled by its regions.
A final list, which takes into account all the information from each
chapter, names the best place to live in Britain. And the winner is . .
. Kingston upon Thames.
The London borough's fine housing in leafy streets backed by with
bustling shopping centres, good education, and low unemployment earned
it plenty of Brownie points.
The only Scottish city to penetrate the top 10 was Edinburgh. Lothian
was listed 10th, while Shetland was joint 13th and Strathclyde 49th. The
Western Isles was rated 51st. Barnsley, at 128th, was the booby town.
But Top Towns throws up some pleasant concepts. The best location for
education was Scotland's islands. In terms of school spending,
examination results, truancy rates, and the standard of education for
the adult population, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles beat every
other area of Britain. In fact Shetland spends #989 on education per
head of population, more than twice as much as Lothian.
Curiously all of the top 10 regions in relation to health and fitness
were Scottish. Shetland, Highland and Orkney were ranked first, second
and third on a list which had taken into account health spending, GP
lists, and chronic illness. Still, Glasgow's claim on the coronary
capital of Europe title remains unchallenged. Strathclyde came 48th.
Housing also threw up some surprises. In Scotland, Grampian had the
highest average house price with #70,602. Borders and Strathclyde had
the lowest average house price of #57,219. Shetland had an average price
of #53,023 and came second only to Northern Ireland for the most
affordable housing in Britain.
The curtain was also raised on Glasgow's success story. In terms of
arts and culture, Strathclyde was second only to Westminster in London's
West End for provision for the arts. Edinburgh was ranked 10th.
In the chapter on recreation and shopping, Strathclyde Country Park
was listed as the most popular country park in Britain. Its 4,000,000
visitors each year was double its nearest rival in Essex. Fife topped
the Scottish league coming fifth in Britain.
For jobs and prices, Strathclyde was the worst in Scotland ranking
103rd while Grampian was rated 10th. The average household income of a
house buyer in Strathclyde was #16,315 compared with #38,961 in
Westminster.
Authors Caralampo Focas, Paul Genty and Peter Murphy conclude that the
increasing polarisation of the rich and poor, with rising crime rate,
have left most cities almost uninhabitable. Today's cities, they say,
are: ''Dirty, noisy, overcrowded, inhabited by the poor and the criminal
classes; it makes you wonder why anyone would want to live in them at
all.''

IT felt as if it was over before it had even begun; as a lustful
encounter between audience and performers it was a severe case of
dramaticus interruptus. This debut performance by the new Scottish-based
company, Colour Clinic, confidently confirmed their claim of delivering
innovative, sensory theatre, but the meagre 45 minutes of Cuban American
Maria Irene Fornes's play felt like a tantalising taster of what they
could do.
Perhaps the sense of frustration, so palpable in the Traverse studio
theatre when the lights came up, was a measure of their success. The
cruel emotional lesson displayed within the text could be contextualised
out to our experience, ie, always leave the lover/audience begging for
more.
The play felt disappointingly short yet exemplified Fornes's talent
for encapsulating a far-reaching scope within the briefest of exchanges.
Fornes is a rigorous and devastatingly effective writer, conveying
multi-dimensional characterisations with the fewest of ''clues''.
Her abrupt, semi-surreal dialogue is always grounded in revelatory
statements. In an apparently mundane conversation between two women,
Helena (Martha Leishman) and Birdie (Mina Fabri-Tabrizi), about a
buttonhole, she drops in the phrase ''they won't let me have scissors''
and doesn't elaborate, yet instantly elucidates Helena's mind state.
Thus, from the briefest of exchanges between four people -- Joseph,
his daughter Helena, her husband Ray, and his lover Birdie, Fornes's
subtly suggests a veritable soap opera of passion, want, obsession, and
betrayal.
Director Morven McLean handles the material with assurance. The
acting, of the highest calibre -- in particular Owen Kavanagh as Joseph
and Mark McDonnell as Ray -- left you aching for more. Not a
satisfactory feeling but a refreshing one.

From dramatic landscapes to Glasgow tenements, Thomas Annan made his
own artistic mark upon them all. And Sara Stevenson is glad he did.
THOMAS Annan was one of the great Scottish photographers. He is known
throughout the world for his poignant series ''The Old Closes and
Streets of Glasgow'', taken between 1868 and 1871.
Thomas Annan was born in 1829 in Fife, where his family was acquainted
with Robert Adamson of the famous Hill and Adamson photographic
partnership. He trained as an engraver with the Fife Herald and then
moved to Glasgow to the celebrated lithographic works of Joseph Swan.
Despite a quarrel with the son of the family, he ''determined to stick
like a limpet'' and worked there until he branched into photography in
1855. By 1859, Thomas Annan was sufficiently successful to open his own
photographic printing works in Hamilton.
Annan specialised in the professional reproduction of paintings, and
sculpture, and this was the base of his contemporary reputation. But he
was a sophisticated photographic artist. As a landscape photographer, he
had a tender affection for his country -- seeing it in an emotional and
historical sense -- planning and waiting for the ideal moment to take
Dumbarton Castle or Melrose Abbey. His landscape pictures are either
straightforwardly beautiful or, most interestingly, observing the
pleasures of unconsidered landscape -- the last stooks in a hayfield,
felled trees or a rocky shore.
As a portrait photographer, Annan learnt from the example of David
Octavius Hill -- approaching his subjects in a broad and strong manner.
His photograph of David Livingstone (whose sisters lived next door to
the Annans in Hamilton) stands as the best portrait of the man, ''tired
of lionising'', in 1864.
Annan became involved in the desperate problem of Glasgow's slums when
he arrived in the 1850s. ''The Old Closes and Streets of Glasgow'' are
filled with his touching concern. It was not an obvious reaction. He was
commissioned by the city to take the photographs in the wake of a
historic decision. For the first time, one of the great industrial
cities had seized control and had pushed through an Act of Parliament
allowing the destruction of privately-owned slum property. This was the
first of the slum clearances. The heart of Glasgow was diseased and
distressed -- filled with poverty, cholera, and typhoid. People lived
too close for health and sense and too many were dying. The Act of
Parliament would release them.
Thomas Annan was described, after his death, as ''the personification
of truth and the soul of honour''. We can believe from this that his
photographs of the closes are true in a sense that is real and
heartfelt. They are unexpectedly lyrical -- containing a genuine sorrow
for the past and pointing to an optimistic future, with distant lights
and hanging washing flying like flags in celebration.
* Sara Stevenson is Curator of Photography at the Scottish National
Portrait Gallery.

IN MY teenage discovery of Lewis Grassic Gibbon, I remember being so
appalled to find that his work was more or less out of print that I
wrote to his publisher. I may still have the reply, which said they had
no plans to bring him back into circulation.
It was typical of the fate of writers who have been dead for less than
20 years. Such was my new-found enthusiasm for Gibbon's work, however,
that I waged my own minor campaign in the early years of journalism.
By the 1960s, the man who had gained most attention for Sunset Song,
the first of his famous trilogy, A Scots Quair, was regaining his proper
position at the top end of literature -- his name by then figuring in
school examinations, along with Scott and Stevenson.
But it was Pharic MacLaren's memorable televising of Grassic Gibbon,
from 1970 onwards, which brought him the wider recognition he so richly
deserved. Nowadays publishers are falling over themselves to reproduce
the powerful prose of the man from the Mearns, whose central figure,
Chris Guthrie, is surely the most convincing female character in
Scottish fiction.
Canongate of Edinburgh are the latest to focus on the Quair, bringing
it out in commendable form, edited and introduced in thoughtful fashion
by Tom Crawford, formerly of Aberdeen University.
One of the feats of this publication is that it brings Grassic
Gibbon's greatest work to the general public at a price of #4.99. The
author's genius, not least in moulding the English language quite
uniquely to the rhythms and cadences of Scots speech, becomes more and
more a matter of wonder as time goes by.
As early as 1933, a year after its publication, the New York Times was
saying of Sunset Song: ''This book may be read with delight the world
over.''
More than 60 years after Grassic Gibbon's tragically early death, that
sentiment is no less true.

THE BOX GARDEN
Carol Shields
Fourth Estate, #5.99 (pbk)
THIS is Carol Shields' second novel, published for the first time in
this country and a companion to her first, Small Ceremonies.
The stylistic components that propelled her on to the international
best-seller lists are already in place, not as tightly developed as in,
say, The Stone Diaries, but already obvious, especially in the way she
constructs her story around a single woman.
Charleen Forrest is the sister of Judith Gill, who featured in
Shields' first novel. She is a 38-year-old poet who works for the
National Botanical Journal and struggles to maintain herself and her son
on a tiny income. Recently separated, she reckons that her ex-husband,
Watson, is missing some of the vital components which happy and normal
people possess. They parted because he was afraid of growing old.
She lives with her charmingly uncomplicated son, Seth, and despite the
scorn of friends maintains a relationship with Eugene, an orthodontist,
a cosmetically orientated man who tinkers with the design of nature, a
provider of pearly teeth, ''a charlatan with carpeted waiting-room,
expensive machinery and golf-club manners''.
Her friends, with whom she works, and maybe Charleen herself, would
think more of Eugene if he were a real dentist who dealt with pain and
suffering. Instead, he is in one of the repair professions and, worse
still, is amply rewarded for what he does.
The style is both deceptive and disarming, Carol Shields seems to
celebrate the ordinary. She has a fondness for lists, which in other
hands can be slipshod and boring. Charleen tries to imagine what fills
her mother's life. ''Plants. Pots of tea. Her pension cheque . . . her
reading glasses, and toast cut into triangles. Her kitchen curtains, her
waxed linoleum. The decaffeinated coffee which she drinks from thick,
chipped cups . . . ''
The list includes a few more items, equally focused and seemingly
random. They appear after a description of her mother's mammograph wound
and the news that, aged 70, she is planning to re-marry.
These characters are ordinary in the way that E M Forster's characters
are ordinary. Lucy Honeychurch complains, ''Nothing ever happens to
me,'' just before she witnesses a murder in the Piazza Signoria.
Similarly, we find Charleen Forrest on the cusp of discovery.
Carol Shields finds a point of crisis and exploits the tension,
filling the surrounds with details which seem to mask her intentions. We
know what Charleen did, who she met, and what was said, so it is
possible to read pages and be unaware of absorbing more than what, at
first, appear as a random selection of observations. Those of more of an
adventurous disposition may find this rather static, as if nothing was
happening, or that what is happening is ordinary, even mundane, as if
literature was concerned with the extraordinary. But the immediacy,
tone, and style are obvious. They are conversational, personal, and
gossipy, focusing on the edge of personality to outline the character,
filling in with generalities, which disguise invention.
Yet we feel we know these women. Their dress and their habits, even
their thoughts and speech, are familiar. And though each character comes
with a list which distinguishes them from the others, the list is more
than a simple beginning -- a shorthand to take us into character. It is
the focus, the place where we find character. By listing others,
Charleen reveals herself.
Watson's monthly maintenance cheque arrives without a letter, though
he typed his farewell note. Charleen is a prolific correspondent,
writing regularly to Brother Adam, a monk whose love of grass gives the
book its title. He is the only correspondent who approaches Charleen in
scope and endurance and she writes to him when she feels alone. His
identity is the source of the book and Charleen's quest for freedom
questions how well she knows others, far less herself.

IT RISES from a craggy island like a monstrous doll's house, shrouded
in polythene sheeting and secrecy, a monumental turreted hideaway for
reclusive multi-millionaires.
Gulls wheeling and crying above the granite cliffs are the only
visitors not subjected to security checks, for this is a forbidden
island and the site of a confidential construction project known only by
its code-name, Project 95.
Tales of mystery and imagination began emanating from Brecqhou, a
rocky islet in the Channel Islands, after it was acquired 18 months ago
by David and Frederick Barclay, twin brothers and financiers from
London, reputed to be the 14th wealthiest people in Britain.
Within a few weeks, they submitted plans for a mock Gothic castle of
buff-coloured granite, featuring round and square towers, a baronial
hall with a window two storeys high, and an underground helicopter pad,
all enclosed by a high perimeter wall.
The plans were available for inspection on request at the development
committee offices on the neighbouring island of Sark for three weeks,
but curiously few of Sark's 550 residents bothered to look at them.
Since then they have been kept from public view, in keeping with the
secrecy surrounding the project.
When work began in February last year, everyone involved, from
architects to labourers, was sworn to silence. When a giant Boeing
Vertol helicopter began ferrying heavy construction equipment from
Guernsey, islanders were left to wonder at the shape of things to come
on tiny Brecqhou, seven miles away.
Reports filtering out of an underground bunker capable of withstanding
a nuclear blast, an elaborate casino, and a 200ft swimming-pool covered
by an enormous glass dome, sparked wild speculation about the castle's
purpose. It was variously depicted as a Doomsday fortress, the command
post of a new independent state, and a redoubt worthy of a villain in a
James Bond film.
The Barclay brothers added to the illusions of celluloid fantasy by
flying to Guernsey from their base in Monte Carlo simultaneously in
separate, identical, executive jets. But still nothing emerged publicly
about the biggest private residential development in the history of the
Channel Islands, and even less was known locally about the mysterious
tycoons.
As proprietors of The European newspaper, among many other business
interests, the Barclays might be expected to be staunch defenders of
press freedom. Such sentiments do not apply to reports about their
development on Brecqhou, however. When the Guernsey Evening Press
published an artist's impression of the architects' plans last November,
the brothers promptly sued the newspaper and its editor for #50,000 each
for alleged breach of copyright.
Two weeks later, persistent speculation prompted the architects,
Lovell, Ozanne &amp; Partners of Guernsey, to take the unusual step of
placing a full-page advertisement in the same newspaper. The company
stated categorically that there was no nuclear fall-out or atomic
shelter; there were no plans for a casino; and there was no security
service vetting for employees or contractors. It concluded sniffily that
the project had contributed significantly to the welfare, employment,
and economy of Guernsey. Other than attesting that it was a private
residential development, however, the architects went no further in
satisfying public curiosity.
Work is now well advanced on the structure, which is clearly visible
from ferries plying between Guernsey and Sark. Through binoculars, one
discerns a massive square building enveloped in grey polythene, rising
from green tableland above low cliffs. It dwarfs a palatial manor house
built in the 1930s, which is due for demolition, and is oddly out of
proportion with the islet on which it stands. It appears to be at least
60ft high, dominating the approaches to Sark as a landmark more imposing
than Brecqhou itself. Apart from construction huts, there are no other
residences on the island.
The attractions of such a retreat for reclusive tycoons are personal
and fiscal. It offers both seclusion and a refuge from three evils of
the twentieth century -- income tax, pollution, and the motor car. As
lords and masters of all they survey, the Barclays will be able to count
their millions in Gothic splendour and total privacy.
The residents of Sark, a feudal fiefdom presided over by a Seigneur
whose authority dates from the sixteenth century, are content to let
them get on with it. They prize their independence and tranquillity on
an island free of motor cars, and subscribe to an unwritten code that
residents may do as they please as long as they don't scare the horses.
Although Brecqhou lies only 80 yards off the west coast of Sark, the
horses that convey tourists around the island in traditional carts have
been oblivious to the construction work.
One of the few residents to have seen the castle plans is Jane Cox,
the local correspondent of the Guernsey Evening Press. ''It looks a bit
scary at the moment, covered with polythene, but I think when it's
finished it will look gorgeous,'' she says.
''People over here are happy to let people do their own thing. If
anybody has thought about it at all, they've probably thought it will be
better than the pebble-dash manor house it's replacing. The average
response is jolly good luck to them, we hope they enjoy it.''
Ms Cox adds that the Barclays have responded generously to local
charity appeals, notably contributing #25,000 towards an ambulance boat
in Guernsey.
Margaret Langley, the Sark tourism officer, is less sure about the
hermit kingdom taking shape on her doorstep. ''It seems strange anyone
would want to build such a big house on such a small island. They've
obviously got reasons, and we can only surmise what they are, can't we?
Personally I think it's spoiled the approaches to Sark and detracted
from the natural beauty around us. But when you've got that much money,
I suppose you can do pretty much what you like.''
Michael Beaumont, the present Seigneur of Sark, who inherited the
title from his grandmother, Dame Sybil Hathaway, in 1974, is reluctant
to discuss the project with the media. However he was quoted by the
local newspaper as saying he thought it was ''rather splendid''. He said
the development committee was satisfied that it would look fine, being
built of granite in keeping with its environment.
Vows of secrecy tend to be diluted by pints of English ale in the
Wellington Arms, a hostelry near the harbour of St Peter Port in
Guernsey. Thus The Herald learned from a labourer that about 100 men are
working shifts virtually round the clock towards a completion date next
May; the castle is likely to have about 40 rooms on three floors and an
underground level; the walls are of concrete and granite reinforced with
steel, and some of them are six feet thick. My informant reckoned it was
bigger than a football pitch, and asserted: ''Once it's up, there'll be
no shifting it.''
The Barclays purchased the tenancy of Brecqhou under Sark's feudal
system for #2.33m, but the cost of their fortified home has not been
disclosed. It has been variously estimated at between #25m and #40m, the
latter figure being about 160 times greater than Sark's total annual
income.
Their island retreat, once advertised in The Times as ''a unique
private Channel Island haven of exquisite beauty and romance'', is as
far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife as any millionaire could
wish for. On calm days, only the calls of birds and the sigh of clear
blue seas washing on its shores disturb its blissful quietness. Its 160
acres slope gently down for 1200 yards from a bulwark of cliffs 240ft
high, which in spring are carpeted with bluebells.
It has a pirates' cave with a lofty entrance opening from an inlet,
and local lore says it is honeycombed by caves inhabited by a colony of
rats descended from ancestors that deserted a sinking ship fleeing the
bubonic plague in London in 1665. The most prolific form of animal life
is the rabbit, but it has about 300 species of flowers, including some
found only on Brecqhou. Due to the absence of petrol exhaust fumes, its
air has only one part per million of carbon monoxide.
The Barclays were well advised to reinforce their castle walls,
however. Winter storms frequently lash the island, occasionally with
hurricane-force winds that atomise waves to clifftop height.
On such days, the brothers might wish to retire with a good book
recounting the colourful history of their fiefdom. Once ruled by William
Long-Sword, the son of a Norse chieftain, it has been a pirates' lair
and witnessed a succession of shipwrecks and bloody clashes between the
English and the French. A band of Scots, under one David Bruce, invaded
Sark in 1337 on behalf of the French, setting fire to buildings and
crops and murdering many of the inhabitants. Two centuries later
Rabelais, sailing near Sark, wrote: ''Let us never descend to the isles
of pirates, thieves, brigands, murderers, and assassins . . . they would
eat us all alive.''
Brecqhou has tended to attract more harmless eccentrics in recent
times. In 1932 it was acquired by Captain Tom Clarke, an Irishman whose
fortune came from tobacco. When he met the selling agent, Clarke was
wearing a filthy raincoat and proferred a cigarette case filled with
half-smoked stubs. Yet he bred pedigree horses, had a priceless
collection of oriental china, and owned a luxury yacht. It was Clarke
who built the present manor house, at a cost of #13,000, along with a
jetty and an aerial cableway for landing cattle, furniture, and
supplies.
The island was deserted for several years after Clarke died on Mull in
1944. A former army officer who tried to exercise squatters' rights was
evicted by Dame Sybil's bailiff in 1947, and later that year the tenancy
was bought by J Thomson Donaldson, a reclusive Scottish textile magnate
who rigorously excluded everyone except his staff. He stayed until 1965,
when he unexpectedly gave his workers a fortnight's notice and retired
to Zurich.
Leonard Matchan, a merchant banker, paid #46,000 for the tenancy in
1966 and spent his time raising ponies and cultivating vegetables until
his death in a Jersey nursing-home in 1987. After a legal wrangle over
ownership, the island was sold to the Barclays by Matchan's son.
Should the new owners tire of their rural idyll, they will be welcome
to take part in the social activities of Sark. The village hall is the
focus of island nightlife, with whist drives, dances, badminton, and a
weekly film show in summer, while the Mermaid Tavern is the scene of
keen rivalry in darts and shove-ha'penny tournaments.
Their tenancy of Brecqhou involves certain responsibilities as well as
privileges, however. In accordance with feudal law, they may be required
by the Seigneur to produce one or two men armed with muskets for the
defence of the realm. The Seigneur may also claim all debris washed up
on shore between the high-tide mark and as far as a man can ride a horse
into the sea, although this may not affect the Barclays as their island
has no beach.
Of more import, the brothers are entitled to a seat on the Chief
Pleas, the Sark parliament, which meets three times a year to regulate
day-to-day affairs. The normally sedate proceedings of this body,
devoted to such matters as clearing horse manure from village lanes,
have been ruffled recently by a flood of European Community legislation
from the Home Office.
Among other weighty issues, the farmers, fishermen, and gift-shop
owners of Sark have been invited to approve Greek membership of the EC,
allow lorries free passage to Bosnia, and recognise immunity for
diplomatic vehicles (on an island with neither cars nor diplomats).
Members of the Chief Pleas who came up with a mischievous suggestion to
veto Greece's application were informed by Mr Beaumont that it was not
funny.
The Barclays do not find such intrusions on their new-found haven
amusing either. It is understood they have written to the Chief Pleas,
urging their fellow members to have nothing to do with EU legislation.
Curiously, neither of the brothers is listed in Who's Who. However,
they have almost identical listings in the international edition, the
only difference being the information that David Barclay has three sons
from a marriage in 1955.
They were born in London in October, 1934, left school at the age of
16 and worked as painters and decorators, then entered the estate-agency
business and began converting boarding-houses into hotels in the 1960s.
A list of their past and present holdings includes shipping and brewery
companies, vineyards, and a string of prestigious hotels in London and
New York. Both list their leisure interests as running and skiing.
A call to their investment company in London elicited a predictable
response. ''They would have no comment to make regarding the Brecqhou
island development,'' a lady said. ''The policy is that no-one speaks to
anyone, so everyone is in the same boat.''
Thus the enigma of their fortified retreat remains. Those close to the
project say it is merely an elaborate hideaway for the Barclays to enjoy
family reunions in privacy and security. Others with more fanciful
imaginations, surveying the ghostly apparition beneath a lowering sky,
fully expect to see it being stormed one day by paratroops and strafed
by a helicopter gunship piloted by Commander Bond.
As long as they don't frighten the horses on Sark nobody will mind, of
course.

William Russell looks at the life of Lana Turner -- a screen goddess
who had a litany of lovers, one of whom, Johnny Stompanato, was killed
at her home
For Lana to be accused of murder would have cost the studio dear
THE secret that the blonde, svelte, sexy, Lana Turner, who has died in
Los Angeles from throat cancer, took with her to the grave is the answer
to who killed her lover, the gangster Johnny Stompanato. In 1958 her
teenage daughter, Cheryl Crane, was accused of stabbing him with a
kitchen knife to stop him beating up her mother. She was found guilty of
justifiable homicide, and sent to reform school.
Yet exactly what happened that spring night in the Turner mansion when
Cheryl, roused by the sounds of yet another violent row between Lana and
Stompanato, remains unclear. Years later mother and daughter would still
refer to it only as ''the happening'' and Cheryl's book about life as a
film star's daughter, Detour: A Hollywood Tragedy, does not provide much
light.
The studio may have stepped in. Those were the days when stars -- Lana
had just been Oscar nominated for her role in Peyton Place and was still
big box-office -- had to be protected.
There have been suggestions that it was not Cheryl who used the knife.
Stompanato, who had dreams of stardom which refused to come true, was a
strong and violent man. Cheryl was only a 14-year-old. Had she the
strength? Had she the reason? But for Lana to be accused of murder would
have cost the studio dear. All the grounds for a cover-up in the classic
Hollywood manner existed. Now we may never know.
Lana, according to the legend which she fostered, was discovered as a
teenager in classic fashion by a talent scout while she was sipping a
Coke in the Top Hat Cafe on Hollywood's Highland Avenue. She was aged
15, playing truant from school. He asked: ''Do you want to be in
pictures?'' She replied: ''I don't know. You'll have to ask my mother.''
Whatever the truth, it is a good story, which is sometimes set in
Scwab's drugstore. Lana, naturally auburn, duly became the leading
Hollywood blonde of her generation -- peroxide sometimes, platinum at
others. In her public life she was everything a film star should be --
glamorous, immaculately groomed, a divine creature from a world of
unimaginable sophistication which ordinary mortals could only dream of
inhabiting. She once said: ''When I leave home, I'm on.''
The remark sums up the way she was educated by MGM, because it is not
a practice today's casually-clad stars observe, although they too demand
the stretch limousines and the attention. They, however, travel wearing
trainers and faux-Oxfam grunge, while Lana was never seen unless
dripping in diamonds and swathed in furs.
Alas, her private life, which was, to say the least, colourful -- she
was married seven times -- contained some very ordinary mortals indeed.
Lana was a goddess with feet of clay.
The killing -- the Stompanato relationship reflected one of her early
successes, Johnny Eager, made in 1941, in which she had played a society
girl fallen for a gangster -- did Lana's career no harm. As a result of
the notoriety provided by the murder she gained a new lease of stardom
in a series of lush Ross Hunter melodramas -- Imitation of Life, By Love
Possessed, Portrait in Black and Madame X.
They were all tosh, but throughly enjoyable tosh, allowing audiences
to wallow in heightened emotion as Lana, dressed to the nines, suffered
as only a woman no better than she should be, must suffer. There were
always tears before bedtime for the heroine, but they never damaged
Lana's mascara, and nothing was allowed to upset her hairdo, smudge her
lipstick, or cause her to drop a spangle.
The film which probably best sums up Turner's star quality was The Bad
and the Beautiful, made in 1952, in which she played a Hollywood star
who owed her career to a thrusting, unscrupulous producer played by Kirk
Douglas. It was billed as ''The story of a blonde who wanted to go
places, and a brute who got her there -- the hard way.''
She gave one of her better performances, the sheer terror which must
infect a star, forever jealous of the need to protect her stardom,
coming across. Never much of an actress, she was always at her best when
the roles reflected the real Lana. Judging by the picture her daughter
gave, she was a vulnerable, fun-loving woman who was forever looking for
love, for whom life was a movie, who played hard, but also worked hard.
The role which encapsulates her celluloid sex-appeal to perfection was
in the 1945 film The Postman Always Rings Twice, based on the novel by
James M Cain, who wrote Double Indemnity. It is another story of a
designing woman who traps a gullible man, with Lana as a discontented
housewife who persuades the itinerant handyman, John Garfield, to murder
her husband. She reeks of sex, wears only white, and is both goddess and
whore combined.
Lana Turner was born Julia Jean Mildred Frances Turner in the mining
town of Wallace, Idaho, in 1920, although in her book, Lana -- The Lady,
the Legend, the Truth, she said it was in 1921. She moved with her
mother, Mildred, who remained a force in her life for many years, to
California after her father was murdered.
After that drugstore discovery, MGM put her under contract, and in
1937, when she was either 16 or 17, she made four films. She worked
steadily in small parts for MGM, including appearing in the Andy Hardy
series, and made her first really big impression in 1941 as one of the
showgirls in Ziegfeld Girl, a lavish musical.
She acquired the ''sweater girl'' tag during the war when the fashion
was to give actresses such labels for publicity purposes, and to cheer
up the boys at the front. It was justified.
Although Lana was never one of the ladies with a huge bust, she could
fill a sweater in memorable fashion. Her heydays proper, however,
started in 1946. She was an imperious Milady in the Gene Kelly Three
Musketeers (1948), a gorgeous Widow in The Merry Widow (1952), a
wonderful courtesan in Diane (1956) -- she played Diane de Poitiers --
and an unhappily married woman opposite Richard Burton in The Rains of
Ranchipur (1955), a disaster movie in which floods, epidemics and an
earthquake bring a tangle of plot lines to a climax.
Lana claimed that she always married the men she loved, although it
does beg the question of Stompanato, not to mention Tyrone Power and
Howard Hughes, with whom she also had affairs, the fact that she had two
abortions, and the home visits by ''Uncle'' Fernando Lamas.
Her husbands were: Artie Shaw, the bandleader, with whom she eloped
when she was 19; Stephen Crane, a Hollywood restaurateur, whom she
married in 1942, divorced and remarried, and by whom she had her only
child, Cheryl; the millionaire playboy, Bob Topping -- when that union
failed she tried to kill herself; the Tarzan star, Lex Barker, who,
according to Cheryl, sexually molested her as a child which led to Lana
throwing him out of the house; a rancher, Fred May; a producer, Robert
Easton; and finally a hypnotist and dietician, Ronald Dante. Power, with
whom she had had a very serious affair, proved a sad disappointment,
marrying Linda Christian instead when his divorce came through.
As her career went into a decline in the 1970s she turned to drink,
but in 1980 discovered God, pulled herself together, and appears to have
lived happily ever after doing the usual things retired film stars do --
writing her memoirs, attending retrospectives at film festivals and
appearing on TV chat shows. She also became reconciled with Cheryl, who
after reform school had embarked on a troubled adult life.
From 1982-83 Lana enjoyed success in the television soap  Falcon
Crest, and she also did dinner theatre. Her last big screen hit was
Madame X in 1966, after which she made only a handful of films. They
included Persecution, a thriller made in Britain in 1974 with a good
British supporting cast, of which the critic Michael Billington said it
gave off ''the unmistakable odour of damp mothballs''. Her final film,
Witches Brew, released in 1985, does not make the reference books.
She grew up at MGM with the likes of Garland, Lamarr, Rooney and
Darnell. Her career had its crises, as did her life. But she did not
self-destruct like Garland, or her successor as blonde of the day,
Monroe. Nor was she a mother from hell in the Joan Crawford mould.
Cheryl, although her adolescence was traumatic and certainly the
Stompanato period was horrendous, bore her mother no grudge at not being
the centre of her life. She was well cared for by the staff, and was
close to her grandmother, Mildred. In Detour she wrote that while she
grew up before her mother, she had ''caught up by leaps and bounds''.
Lana Turner remained a true Hollywood star to the end of her life,
even if she no longer made movies. The image survived. They don't make
them like her any more.

HAD SHE played her cards right (right?) Sue Barker could today have
been Lady Cliff of Richard, best beloved of the nation. Instead we find
her presiding over that extended metaphor for imperial decline, Today at
Wimbledon (BBC2, nightly), wherein uppity foreigners turn up to show us
how -- as with football, rugby and parliamentary democracy -- the game
we gave to the world ought to be played.
Barker brings to the job the matchless authority that comes from
having herself lost gracefully and often for Britain. This is a woman
who has smiled so much in defeat she no longer knows how to wipe the
grin off her face even as our brightest and best are ground into the
turf.
Mind you, given Agassi's decision to wear his underpants on his head,
and the Lawn Tennis Association's decision to elect a Canadian as our
great white hope (next year a lad from Ulan Bhator who once saw a photo
of the Queen), this is perhaps forgivable.
One uppity foreigner absent this year, of course, was Martina
Navratilova, or ''Martina'' as people who've never met the woman will
insist on calling her. Retired from combat, she was nevertheless obliged
to return a few of Rhona Cameron's wild lobs during Gaytime TV (BBC2,
Thursday).
This she did with grace, which is more than can be said for Cameron.
Or can we call her Rhona? Probably not. Cameron and her co-presenter
''Bert Tyler-Moore'' were the sore thumbs in what was otherwise an
elegantly-manicured handful of items aimed at gays, lesbians and
bisexuals. When she begged a bemused Navratilova to autograph her
underpants it was for all the world like a satire on liberation. Take
That are treated with more respect.
Yet the show in general had none of the hectoring tone and militant
drone of other such niche programmes. The links were witty and the tale
of the two young and gay Glaswegians travelling to the London Pride
rally a gem, not least when a compatriot of mature years who had come
south for a Townswomen's Guild conference almost died of shock, still
spluttering, as the drag queens danced by.
But Rhona and Bert (I'd lay off the Richard and Judy jokes, folks;
you're not in that chillingly professional league) seemed stiff, ill at
ease, and none too sure of the tone they were supposed to adopt. They
might as well have been presenting Blue Peter (''but don't try this at
home'') and it was left to Harvey Fierstein, he of Torch Song Trilogy,
to save the day.
Beyond saving, like much of Scottish football itself, was A Game of
Two Halves (Scottish, Thursday). The decision to play Jim White up front
from the kick-off was clearly a mistake. Given an open joke, the lad was
ballooning them over the bar from the six-yard line at every
opportunity. In the league of comedy quiz shows, this was Stenhousemuir.
Dennis Law and Tony Roper were lying deep, meanwhile, which was wise
of them, given that someone seemed to have decided rules and scoring, in
any sense of the word, needn't matter. Yet the whole point of this
format (no points for originality, by the way) is that you take the
rules just seriously enough to be able to bend them. This game of two
gags will never be half as funny as Sport in Question.
Who, come to that, will ever be as funny as Hancock? ''What do
baby-sitters look like? Did Rembrandt look like a musician? Of course
she didn't!'' (Hancock's World, BBC2, Tuesday).
The BBC never tires of claiming the sage of Railway Cuttings as its
own special achievement, as though one brief flare of genius all those
years ago somehow justifies something as wilfully dire, as
preternaturally otiose and insultingly dim, as Men Behaving Badly (BBC1,
Thursday). It doesn't, of course. Hancock wasn't just in a different
league from much of what passes for television comedy today, he was in a
different state of being.
His character was a fantasist, a man whose ability to deceive himself
had outstripped all the objections of reason and all the evidence of an
uncaring world. But the point of Hancock the actor was that he became
the fantasy. He did not just play a deluded man but seemed himself to
become deluded (his brief life may be taken as some sort of proof of
that).
Thus profound ignorance, boundless confidence and a talent for crazed
logic -- the character was in essence a little boy -- wove a kind of
spell over actor and audience alike.
Despite Galton and Simpson's scripts, it was all in the face. Those
mobile features, raising themselves from ineffable gloom to manic glee
while watching a shirt revolving in a spin dryer for the first time,
said everything. Pomposity and terror became pomposity and smug, idiotic
pride in the blink of an eye when, in The Blood Donor, he was told his
gore was rare.
This was comic acting without peer.
What, then, is the BBC playing at by fobbing us off with clips linked
by the blameless John Peel when they could re-run the shows themselves?
Being told that ''the best of Hancock'' is available on video is no
excuse but is, no doubt, the reason. The economic imperatives which
govern the modern BBC -- the same BBC that lauds Spike Milligan while
turning down his scripts -- allow us to hope for no better.
Still, there were a few other jokes in the course of the week. One was
TV's coverage of the Tory ''leadership'' election. Last week this column
suggested that the news and current affairs departments had gone so far
over the top in their reaction to this farce that they were in danger of
meeting themselves on the way back.
This they duly did. For three days the ''Redwood challenge'' was
inflated until, like all bubbles, it burst. The point is, however, that
it was boosted by television and, as Redwood may one day come to
realise, destroyed by television. If there is a Tory MP who has yet to
face the cameras to swear undying loyalty to his career, however, I'd
like to hear about it.
That said, it will be hard to forget the shots of Redwood struggling
to sing-a-long-a Welsh, for all the world like a goldfish who has just
realised there's a hole in his bowl. Was that, and the whole political
process it symbolised, real comedy? Cue Jim White: ''Correctamundo!''

Profile: THE SUN
IT HAS been around since the dawn of time, the source and the
indispensable sustenance of all life. It is the ultimate power in our
little corner of the universe, and without it we would cease to exist.
We depend on it for light, warmth, and the energy that drives winds
and ocean currents. We have worshipped it, cursed it, and sworn eternal
love by it; but too much of it could kill us, and Noel Coward observed
that mad dogs and Englishmen are particularly vulnerable. Scots may be
less at risk because we see less of it.
To astronomers, it is a fairly ordinary yellow dwarf main-sequence
star of the G1 type. To the rest of us, the unfamiliar golden orb
blazing across the heavens over the past week is, of course, the Sun.
We have learned quite a lot about the Sun since discovering that we
revolve around it, rather than the other way round. But there is a great
deal we still do not know. Like where it comes from, for example.
Modern theories suggest the solar system began as a primeval cloud of
cold gas, which condensed and became exceedingly hot as gravity caused
it to contract. Eventually, about 4600 million years ago, the cloud
became hot enough for the Sun to begin to shine through the energy
released by nuclear fusion at its core.
Well, maybe. With commendable candour, the Encylopaedia Britannica
admits: ''It should be emphasised that no theory of the origin of the
solar system has won general acceptance. All involve highly improbable
assumptions. The difficulty is in trying to find a theory with any
degree of probability at all.''
Anaxagoras, an Athenian philosopher in the fifth century BC, believed
he had made a breakthrough when a great meteorite slammed into southern
Greece in 467 BC. Concluding that it was a chunk of the Sun, he
announced that the Sun was a mass of red-hot iron a bit bigger than the
Peloponnese.
The invention of the telescope, and even more sophisticated
astronomical equipment, has brought it into sharper focus. We now know
that the Sun is a gigantic ball of gas, mostly hydrogen, held together
by its own gravity. It has traces of iron, chromium, titanium, and even
silver and gold, but essentially it is just a lot of hot air.
To put it in perspective, it comprises more than 99% of the mass of
the solar system. The rest consists of almost empty space traversed at
wide intervals by bodies or relatively insignificant mass, including the
little planet we call home.
The Sun is more than 100 times bigger than the Earth, with a diameter
of 835,000 miles, and it is 333,000 times as massive. In galactic terms
it is pretty close to us, being on average a mere 93 million miles or
eight light-minutes away. It is also quite hot.
Determining its temperature has been one of the most difficult
problems in solar astronomy, but scientists have calculated that its
core registers around 15 million Celsius. Near its visible surface,
known as the photosphere, it is a relatively cool 6000C.
The reason it generates so much heat and energy is that it is
essentially a very big nuclear reactor, transforming hydrogen into
helium for reasons best known to itself. Although it loses four million
tons of hydrogen per second in the process, it is expected to continue
radiating at essentially its present rate for a few hundreds of millions
of years.
The energy generated by this nuclear fusion passes slowly from the
core, through the photosphere, and then across space to the beaches of
Tahiti, and even Largs, sometimes.
It is not easy to describe the power of solar energy. One way of
looking at it is to imagine an ice bridge, two miles in diameter,
spanning the vast distance between the Sun and Earth. If all of the
Sun's radiation could be concentrated on the bridge, it would melt in
one second, and be vaporised in seven more. So the scientists reckon,
anyway.
Although we receive only a tiny fraction of the Sun's energy (one part
in 2.2 billion to be precise), it amounts to four million horsepower per
square mile. If ever we learn to harness it properly, shares in power
companies might be worth considering. It has been estimated that the
energy released by a single solar flare -- one of those gigantic
roman-candles that occasionally burst from the Sun -- would be enough to
provide electric power for the whole world for up to 100 million years.
Something else a lot of people do not know is that the Sun is
substantially closer to us in the middle of the Scottish winter than at
the height of summer. This is due to the elliptical orbit of Earth,
which places it 91.4 million miles from the Sun on January 3, and 94.5
million miles away on July 4.
The Sun has a lot more to do with our weather than simply determining
whether it is hot or cold. Earth has developed its own complex
meteorological systems, but they all depend on the Sun for power --
winds, tides, high and low pressure systems, all are driven by solar
energy. Like petrol which makes a car work, the Sun keeps the motor of
our atmosphere system going; if it stops, so do we.
Perceptions of this giant nuclear furnace in the sky have varied over
the years. A popular view is expressed in Ecclesiastes, 11:7: ''Truly
the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold
the Sun.'' This was in the days before harmful ultra-violet rays began
flowing through holes in the ozone layer, of course.
Philosophers have been debating our relationship with the Sun for
centuries. Sir Thomas Browne sought in the seventeenth century to place
us on a higher spiritual plane: ''There is surely a piece of divinity in
us, something that was before the elements, and owes no homage unto the
Sun.''
AJ Balfour, who was responsible for the Balfour Declaration on
Palestine, took a gloomier view of our ultimate fate: ''The energies of
our system will decay, the glory of the Sun will be dimmed, and the
Earth, tideless and inert, will no longer tolerate the race which has
for a moment disturbed its solitude. Man will go down into the pit, and
all his thoughts will perish.''
In the meantime, astronomers are happy to have a dwarf star close
enough to observe -- although it is far from being the most interesting
star in the galaxy.
David Morgan, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh,
says: ''It's quite a boring star, actually. It's neither extremely hot
nor cold, or big or small. It's just the right temperature for keeping
us alive, though.''
Mr Morgan points to Rigel, which shines brightly in the Orion
constellation, as an interesting star. It is more than twice as hot as
the Sun. There are others that are believed to be almost seven times
hotter.
And here is another curious fact: ''hot'' suns are blue, and ''cold''
suns are red. The yellow tone of ours indicates it is somewhere between
the two.
It will eventually change colour, unfortunately, signalling the
beginning of the end of life as we know it. When its hydrogen runs out
in about 10,000 million years or so, nuclear reactions involving helium
and heavier atoms will take over.
The Sun will swell, burn more brightly, and become a pulsating red
giant. When all its nuclear energy sources are exhausted, it will become
a white dwarf, shrinking to about 100-times smaller than it is now.
Finally burned out, it will cool and fade into a black dwarf, a very
dense, dark object of degenerate matter. By then, of course, the lights
will have been switched off on our planet. Life in Largs will have
ceased to exist.

IN the next few days the first broods of young house martins will be
leaving their inverted mud huts under the eaves of houses new and old
all over Scotland. Once they nested on cliffs -- and they still do in
some places like Tantallon -- but then we started making better cliffs.
Telling martins and swallows apart is hardest now, as young swallows
have short tails like martins. Swallows have less contrasting plumage --
blue and cream to the martin's black and white -- but the diagnostic
feature is the martin's white rump. You can know martins, too, by their
more flickering flight and their risping chatter.
Most pairs get on with a second brood at once, though their first
offspring return to roost. Thirteen were once counted cosily crammed in
a single nest. It is one of the safest. As a boy I remember watching
martins gathering mud by a burn bank, amazed at their glossy black backs
and their white feathered spats, like tiny grouse claws. They mix in
grass and then cement the little round bricks together with saliva to
make their ''pendant bed and procreant cradle''. Bad luck for Banquo and
Duncan, but then it was not their castle which the martins had adorned
with their ''loved mansionry''.
Martins are very faithful to a site, though their colonies rise and
fall like those of man. The Clean Air Act of 1956 has brought them back
to London. Nowhere in Britain can you see the great martin cities like
the church at El Rocio in Andalusia. Still, our Scots martins deserve
their affectionate diminutive name, for we love their houses as well as
they love ours.

Ian Hamilton relates the events of the day clocks went haywire in
'Jail Square'
I HAVE spent nearly a lifetime in the courts and it might be thought
that I would have witnessed many curious happenings. With one exception,
this is not so. I have seen tears and tragedy, and on occasion comedy,
but only once have I witnessesd the truly bizarre.
It happened to me a few months ago in the High Court in Glasgow, the
one at the foot of the Saltmarket, where so much of our legal and social
history has been made.
Along with my junior, John McLaughlin, advocate, I had been instructed
to conduct the defence of a man charged with murder. There was nothing
unusual in that. Over the years I have led for the defence in several
hundred murder cases. They do not stay long in the mind, and, so far as
I can recollect, there were no unusual features in this particular one.
I remember enough to say that, while trying for an acquittal, the only
real hope was to have the verdict reduced by the jury to one of culpable
homicide. Murder attracts the fixed penalty of life imprisonment, while
in culpable homicide the judge fixes the sentence, usually some years of
imprisonment.
The great value of the latter sentence is that it is subject both to
parole and remission. Neither of these is available to a lifer. People
are greatly afraid of the indeterminate sentence, but if you can win a
verdict of culpable homicide for your client the date of his earliest
release is worked out before you can get down to the cells to consult
when all is over.
In these wonderful big Georgian courts in the Saltmarket, or Jail
Square as it is known in the trade, we sit facing the judge. We were in
the South Court, so the jury was on my left. There is a clock behind us
which means that the judge sits facing it, which is very handy if he is
thinking of his lunch as we all sometimes are. Even when a fellow
citizen is on trial for murder, we want our lunch. It may be callous. I
merely relate human experience.
On the day in question I had just glanced at my watch which showed
between 12.30pm and 12.35pm, when, to my surprise, Lord Mayfield, the
trial judge, announced that as it was nearly one o'clock we would rise
for lunch.
Times are important in this narrative, and all of us, lawyers and
jurors alike, looked at our watches, and at the court clock. The latter
said three minutes to one. Our watches confirmed that the court clock
was fast. That fact I can swear to. In addition, I am almost certain
that when we started the day's work the clock had been at the right
time.
Every member of Western civilisation is a clock-watcher. We live and
die by the clock. If that clock had been fast at the start of the day's
proceedings we would all have noticed, and we didn't. That clock had
gained momentum during the course of the morning, and the eerie fact is
that at least three others in the building had done the same.
Lord Mayfield came back on the Bench, explained that he had been
misled, and the trial proceeded. When we rose at the wrist-watch time of
one o'clock I went to the robing room and as usual spoke a few words to
Charles Hendry our rober. I am being deliberately formal as these are
real names of real people. This is a factual account, not a short story.
Charlie pointed out that the robing room clock was half an hour fast.
''It's been gaining time all morning,'' he said.
These clocks were not synchronised. They have been changed since, for
what reason I know not.
I went out into the foyer of the courthouse where there is yet another
clock. It also had gained half an hour. I then looked at the North Court
clock. It was in the same condition.
I asked, although it was no concern of mine, if the man who looked
after them had been informed. In Civil Service buildings there is always
such a man.
''They tell me he was sent for,'' said Charlie Hendry, ''but they say
the poor fellow dropped dead this forenoon.''
I went on with my work and the clocks went on with theirs. They
stabilised themselves that afternoon. They were then about
three-quarters of an hour fast. They went on telling the time, but it
was not the correct time. All four clocks had rebelled against time
itself, maintained their rebellion for the same amount of time, and then
gone back to functioning as usual, albeit in each case three-quarters of
an hour fast.
Such was my preoccupation with my client's case that I neglected to
check the other clocks in the building. It should be noticed that it was
only the clocks that were serviced by the dead man that were affected,
not our watches.
The next day was the last day of the case and the advocate-depute, in
his speech to the jury, poured scorn on my client's defence, and held it
up as an example of unbelievable absurdity. I told the jury the story of
the clocks. They knew about the clock in the court they were sitting in,
and some of them may have noticed the one in the foyer.
As a parable I told them the true facts as I knew them. I told them
about the dead man. I argued that, however true such a story was, if it
had been part of my defence no-one would have believed it. They accepted
the defence view and brought back a verdict of culpable homicide. And,
yes, my client did know the date of his release when my instructing
solicitor went down to see him.
When the pressure of the case had gone I talked over the incident of
the clocks with John McLaughlin. He is a down-to-earth lawyer, earning a
crust in the least remunerative branch of the law, and helping half a
dozen Christian charities in his spare time, thinking nobody knows.
''Oh yes,'' he said matter of factly. ''There's a lot of energy
released when a person dies. When my granny died all the clocks in the
house stopped.''
These are the facts. I can offer neither explanation not conclusion. I
have never had anything to do with psychical research or the paranormal.
I dislike being mocked as much as the next person, but I will risk being
mocked to record what I have seen. As an agnostic I always hope that
there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in my
philosophy.
I like to think that the clocks were paying their last respects to the
man who had cared for them.

IT was with no great surprise that my wife and I recently realised the
magnitude of the fact that we were fast hurtling, without the aid of
safety belts, flotation collars, or global positioning devices, towards
our silver-wedding anniversary.
As is really not advisable, but seems to be customary in these
situations, we were drawn into looking back over the many threads that
have made up the warp and weft of our blanket relationship for this
imminent 25-year celebration. I say it is not advisable advisably, as I
know of one couple who, instead of just getting on with life, sat of an
evening dis-assembling their day, week, or month together and, surprise
surprise, found that they didn't really like each other.
Sheila and I have never had a great deal of time for soul-searching,
though when latterly we did sit down and talk, we found we both had
developed separate interests and were happy enough to let each other get
on with enjoying them, and therein perhaps lies the secret.
Mind you, it wasn't always so. At the outset, you want to impress your
putative partner, and being a pushy male, I suggested a day on the water
to impress her with my command of rod and line.
Sheila had never really evinced the least interest in fishing prior to
that day, when she gubbed the entire BBC Club Angling Section on a
fishing trip out from Fairlie Pier.
I had been an irregular regular with the club and was keen to
introduce my new girlfriend to sea-angling, and the mysteries of tide,
bait, and bite, and the biting baiting of as devious a group of cheerful
rogues as you could ever wish to meet. Out we went into the wild blue
yonder of the Firth of Clyde, and I showed Sheila how to bait a hook,
how to let the bait down to the bottom and how to distinguish between
the weight getting caught and a fish taking the bait. And how quickly
she picked up the nuances. Heaviest total catch as well as the single
heaviest fish of the day, not to mention the cash sweepstake.
The terrible thought loomed. Maybe this lady would take up the sport
and insist that she accompany me on all my angling peregrinations.
Fortunately, the question of sanitation intervened, and though I had
helped her, eyes averted of course, with the loo-bucket at strategic
moments, sea-angling was, like Norway or Turkey in the Eurovision Song
Contest, currently valued at ''Nul Points''.
So to fresh water. A loch in the hills above the Lake of Menteith.
Cloud cover perfect and fish rising. The two of us in the boat.
''Would you like to fish, love?''
''No, no, on you go Paul.''
''Well, OK, look, there's a fish rising . . . a wee pull on the left
oar, pet. No, the left oar, darling, just a wee pull. PULL THE LEFT
OAR!!''
A splash as the oar went into the water, the trout terrified and then
a silence. Not one of those communicative ones.
Back to shore for lunch and again ablutions hove into sight. A
two-doored wooden hut with gents to one side and ladies to the other. It
was the midges and bluebottles that did it. Sheila had recently
discovered an interest in genealogy and was of the opinion that casting
a net for ancestors in the comfort of Register House surely beat casting
a fly over fly-infested waters.
We drifted apart, happily only in our individual passions. I continued
to fish, even getting into the Scottish team, and Sheila discovered more
about her precursors. Our two daughters were born and gave more weight
to Sheila's genealogical excavations. And talking of weight, each child
weighed at birth an ounce or so more than my heaviest trout . . . six
pounds.
Then Hooked on Scotland came along. I would phone home from location
and Sheila would ask how many fish we'd caught.
''None,'' I would say.
''Nine,'' she'd reply, ''Excellent!''
Always supportive, if not always totally interested. And that's the
way it has worked for us. Twenty-five years of give and take. And I know
I've taken more than I've given. There has been the odd bonus of a trout
for tea, a nice bit of grilled cod, and a side of smoked salmon, but
without Sheila's good-natured support, the fishing would have been no
pleasure.
I don't know what bait I used, but Sheila is definitely the best catch
I ever made.

From Monday two of the main contenders in the long-running newspaper
war, the Times and Daily Telegraph, will put up their price by 5p -- a
reflection of the worldwide newsprint crisis. Margaret Vaughan
investigates
GONE are the days when you could buy a newspaper, wrap your fish and
chips in it, line the budgie's cage, and still have enough left over for
the Boy Scouts' paper-recycling collection. My, how times do change.
Nowadays the paper you hold in your hand has become a rare and
precious commodity. Grubby old newsprint is fetching prices so high it's
rumoured some newspaper owners are prepared to kill for it.
Tuppence on the price of the Sun was a signal that the soaraway costs
of the paper it's printed on was biting into the profit margins of the
UK's biggest buyer of newsprint, News International, which consumes
460,000 tonnes a year. Five pence has now been put on the Times, and
Telegraph. In January, the cost of newsprint went up 15%. A price
increase of about 30% will take effect in July. This will be followed by
a further rise of 20% in January next year.
In March, News International rationed supplies of its newspapers and
reduced the size of most of them. It is the most dramatic symptom yet of
the acute problem confronting the world newspaper industry -- a shortage
of newsprint.
Newsprint is one of the most volatile of commodities. Its producers
are subject to long cycles of loss following by short bursts of profit.
In the eighties, the industry suffered major losses with over-capacity
causing supply to outstrip demand. Now the reverse is the case.
Newspapers around the world have been left reeling from the soaring
price. Some smaller newspaper groups, lacking the negotiating clout of
global players, face an 80% increase in newsprint costs in one year.
Low newsprint prices may have helped many newspapers survive the
recession. They certainly allowed Rupert Murdoch to start a price war.
Consumption of newsprint was up by 11% in the UK last year to 2.2
million tonnes, from 1.9 million tonnes in 1993. European demand rose
over the same period by 5%.
Meanwhile, as proprietors scuttle round the globe, from Scandinavia to
North America, trying to find supplies at a price they can afford, the
producers are on a roll. Accusations that the suppliers are holding the
world's powerful press magnates to ransom, as they push up prices, led
the European Commission to set up an investigation into whether a cartel
was operating.
The commission's competition directorate staged a series of raids on
40 companies in April. It wanted to establish whether the newsprint
producers were acting together to distort competition -- either by
fixing prices or creating a newsprint shortage, or by agreeing to
''divvy up'' the market.
The seven countries believed to be involved are Sweden, Finland, and
Germany -- Europe's three largest newsprint producers -- plus the UK,
France, Austria and Italy. However, few observers believe that newsprint
prices rose because producers colluded to suppress output.
''If they had done their homework first, they would have found that
the suppliers lost money in container loads during the recession
years,'' says Stefan Kay, president of the Paper Federation of Great
Britain, and managing director of Inveresk Ltd. ''Some cartel, huh?'' he
declares.
''The paper industry is notoriously cyclical. And over the past 25
years it has become more global. What's behind the escalation in prices
is that world demand has picked up. What hasn't happened is new capacity
coming on stream to meet that demand.''
The two main raw materials of newsprint are woodpulp and wastepaper.
The cost of woodpulp has more than doubled in a year, and the same is
true of waste-paper prices.
Demand for newsprint over the past year has risen sharply, especially
in the US, where rapid economic growth fuelled demand for paper. The
market has been taken aback by strong demand from the Far East -- mainly
Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia.
And after the fall of the wall, in countries like Romania, previously
served by two state-run newspapers, there has emerged a burgeoning
newspaper industry. There are now about 28 new titles.
In 1990, newsprint prices had collapsed. Virtually all newsprint
manufacturers lost money reaching into millions. Finnish and Swedish
producers suffered huge losses.
Over two years, the Canadian industry lost #500m. Investment was
stifled. There was reluctance to build new plants and install new,
expensive machines, which cost around #300m each.
When demand rose to unprecedented levels a year ago, as the recession
eased, capacity worldwide was well down. Old mills had shut, inefficient
machinery had been scrapped. Some manufacturers had diversified into
other products.
It takes a long time for the industry to respond to rising demand.
Such paper machines take two years, often longer, to build.
When producers had to cope with a 35% decline in prices, it is not
surprising that they now revel in the chance of a return to profits.
''The cost of a pulp mill is like the national debt of a small
country,'' says Stefan Kay. ''You are talking about #1000m minimum to
produce 1500 tonnes a day of pulp. It may take three to five years to
get consents for building, and who, in their right mind, would put money
into a business where it is so cyclical?
''They may make money on the upswing like now and lose it when the
downturn comes. It is a risky business for them.''
Rising newsprint costs are important: they make up somewhere between
15% and 30% of a paper's costs. Industry analysts believe some smaller
titles, denied the cushion of corporate millions, may disappear if
prices continue to rise.
Mind you, analysts have been wrong before. What, for example, happened
to the electronic revolution's paperless office? The electronic
newspaper, the one that was forecast to make newsprint a mere grubby
memory? The analysts did not foresee the huge increase in information
flying around the globe that would result from the electronic
revolution. Much of it has ended up committed to paper. Maybe newspaper
proprietors would do as well to consult Mystic Meg for a forecast of
next year's newsprint prices.

BUNKER MAN. Duncan McLean
Cape, #9.99
THE new rural school of young Scottish fiction writers is very
different from that of the generation of George Mackay Brown and Iain
Crichton Smith. Brown draws much of his inspiration from the Viking past
of his native Orkney, and Smith, in his most enduring work, has an old
woman describe the Highland Clearances.
But the violence they both portray pales into insignificance with the
violence in the fiction of Alan Warner and Duncan McLean.
In his first novel, Morvern Callar, published earlier this year,
Warner's main character finds her lover with his throat cut on the
kitchen floor. She eventually dismembers his putrefying corpse for
disposal, burying the head and other parts on a mountain.
Duncan McLean doesn't go in for butchery on this scale in his latest
novel Bunker Man. But like Morvern Callar it isn't a book for the
squeamish.
Bunker Man is set on the north-east coast of Scotland (McLean comes
from Aberdeenshire, but now lives in Orkney). The quiet town is
disturbed by the arrival of a strange hooded man who lives rough in an
old concrete pillbox, and who hangs about a wood beside the school where
Rob, the central character, is a janitor.
Rob is newly married to Karen, and the novel opens with much sexual
activity, graphically described. This is neither offensive nor
contrived: it gives the story an impetus and realism that engages the
reader.
While Rob and Karen are dining in a party in an Indian restaurant,
their friend Susan is called out by the hooded man. Rob believes that he
has tried to expose himself to Susan. He also believes that his wife is
having an affair. From now on the novel acquires an atmosphere of
menace. The headmaster alerts Rob to be on the lookout for this hooded
figure, in case he molests one of the pupils, and Rob becomes obsessed
with catching him.
But it isn't the hooded man who is the danger. Having confiscated a
sexually explicit magazine from Sandra, a 14-year-old pupil, Rob has sex
with her. From then on this novel describes the intense physical
coupling of the janitor and the minor, culminating in him buggering her
and abusing her sexually with a torch.
Having chosen such a theme, McLean's task is to convince the reader
that the close-up descriptions of violent and deviant sex are necessary
in the delineation of his character Rob. But we don't get a convincing
insight into the development of Rob's personality from highly-sexed
husband to a madman who arranges for his wife to be raped by the bunker
man while he watches, then smashes the man over the head with a cleaver.
Is this a novel about male dominance and sexual aggression? Is the
hooded man Rob's alter ego? These questions go unanswered because the
brutal sexuality of the narrative, accompanied by the incessant use of
graphic swear words, block rather than reveal the pscyhology of the
perpetrator.
Many readers -- and I am among them -- will see Bunker Man as
pornography hooded as literary fiction, and not the ''powerful,
terrifying tale of obsesssion, perversion, and random horror by a master
of the language'' touted on the back cover.
This is sad, since McLean is clearly a gifted writer, a spokesperson
who can show us how rural society in many parts of Scotland is becoming
indistinguishable from urban society, with its dossers, porn videos,
disposable syringes, and strewn condoms.
We are in an age of realism in Scottish fiction, with the interior
lives of blind beggars and sexual deviants described -- an age that
takes no hostages to fortune. It's an age that seems to relegate the
writings of Mackay Brown to old history, but it's refreshing to return
to the old myths that still manage to encompass our violence and
desires, yet at the same time elevate life.

SPIN DOCTOR.
Michael Shea
HarperCollins, #14.99
IMUST have spent an innocent 30 years in the administrative side of
politics, because I had never heard of the expression ''spin doctor'',
as applied to a political manipulator, before. Over the past years, the
public view of politicans has been that they belong to one of two
classes, the bumbling and inept, or the devious and corrupt.In fact, the
vast majority of Members of Parliament, of both Houses and all parties,
are sincere and hard-working and are only let down by the questionable
activities of a very few -- and this applies to stars equally with bit
players.
This generally accepted view of the world of politics must be a
legitimate starting point for a writer of political thrillers, and as an
avid reader of that category of crime fiction myself, I like my villains
to be black and my heroes to be white.
Into which of these two categories Mark Ivor, the spin doctor of the
title, turns out to fall, I shall not spoil your enjoyment of the book
by revealing. He is an arch-fixer having no views of his own.
He starts the book with two main clients, the Ramsay Smythe
Consortium, for which he must facilitate the smooth takeover of Sigmont,
a huge Dutch/German building and engineering conglomerate, and Lord
Shand, an ultra-right-wing Tory peer who needs skilled help in
insinuating himself into the Prime Minister's trust and confidence. The
way in which these two major themes dovetail throughout the book is
handled with consummate skill, and the pace never lets up.
The suicide of a senior minister, the blackmailing of a junior one,
the framing of the girl responsible, the death by terrorism of a party
chairman -- all these impinge in some way on the spin doctor's
activities.
Lord Blakestone, the grand old man of the Conservative Party, is a
beautifully drawn minor character but, by the rules of the game, as a
former active politician himself, even he must be tainted. A pity . . .
I would have liked to see at least one of the politicians turn out to be
a nice chap too.

* SCIENTISTS in the Animal Physiology Research Unit in Athens, USA,
are testing a technique aimed at lowering fat content in pigs. The
research may have implications for understanding and treating severe
obesity in humans. The method is unique because it uses monoclonal
antibodies -- custom-designed probes -- that attach to and destroy
precursor fat cells in young animals. It has already been tested on
rats. They had as much as 30% less fat, and no ill effects from the
antibodies. A new test used piglets, all of which appeared healthy . . .
and thin.
* IN a development that has broad implications for the treatment of
severe bone and cartilage diseases, researchers in America have now
shown that they can ''transplant'' populations of precursor cells that
give rise to bone and cartilage from one animal to another.
Following the fate of these precursor cells in the recipient mice, the
researchers found that donor cells had replaced between 3% and 10% of
bone and cartilage cells in the mice one to five months after injection.
The results may open new avenues for gene therapy in the treatment of
human diseases such as ''brittle bone'' disease, dwarfism, osteoporosis,
and osteoarthritis.
Using a procedure that is similar to but more complex than a blood
transfusion, scientists soon may be able to correct or compensate for
the genetic flaws underlying such diseases.
* A drug that may stave off a form of diabetes and a simple urine test
to detect people at risk for developing the condition are the latest
fruits of long-term research by pharmacologists at the University of
Virginia School of Medicine.
They have isolated and identified two key second-messenger compounds,
both of which are reduced or absent in people with one form of diabetes.
They have now synthesised this molecule and injected it into diabetic
rats and monkeys. The result was a dramatic lowering of blood glucose to
near-normal levels.
The second compound being studied (single sugar) is known as DCI which
previously was believed to exist only in plants and insects. Currently,
DCI is purified from extracts of pine wood. It is also present in foods
such as beans, peas, and chickpeas. The researchers are attempting to
synthesise it from more easily available basic chemicals. Ultimately,
they believe, the compound could be given orally.
* MEDIA Vision UK has announced a new personal CD-ROM for Mac and IBM
compatibles. The multipurpose Reno player has a high-performance
double-speed external drive which enables users to run both CD-based
multimedia software programs and musical disks in the office, home, or
even on the move.
The Reno features an ultra-fast drive with transfer and access speeds
among the fastest in the field. Part of Media Vision's multimedia kit,
the Reno is selling at just under #300.
* HOLLYWOOD has linked with electronics giants in a bid to replace
video recorders with a new breed of CD player. Time Warner, MGM, and
United Artists are in league with Toshiba, Hitachi, and other top
manufacturers. The new system has just been unveiled in Paris.
Its discs apparently can hold a film with stereo soundtrack with a
quality finer than a 12-inch laser disc. With a double-sided twin-layer
format, they can hold two full features on each side.
The coalition, known as the Super-Density Digital Video Disc Group,
plans a launch next year, with 250 films available.

THE MASTERLESS MEN, J K Mayo. Macmillan, #14.99
Spy writers have a particular dilemma. What do you do when the cold
war is over? The Berlin Wall has been demolished. The secret agents are
no longer secret and their P45s are all that's left for them in the dead
letter box. Some authors move on. The same intrigue under a different
guise. Colombian drug cartels. Bosnia perhaps. Others studiously ignore
the fact that peace has broken out. They tell the same old stories,
choosing to call it history rather than currency.
The inventive J K Mayo stares the quandary in the face and, with
startling originality, makes a virtue of the fact that there is an army
of redundant spies out there looking for job opportunities in a
shrinking market-place. So what do they do? They engage themselves in
the darkest of private enterprises. They become a mercenary agency of
secret operatives, their despicable and (by their very nature) hidden
talents available to the highest bidder. This is what happens when
dangerous men are left masterless.
John Hynd, a professional killer and former MI5 operative, is happy to
be out of it. He lives in a remote cottage on the west coast of
Scotland. Hunting, fishing, and carrying on an intimate relationship
with Caroline Swift, a mysterious middle-aged American who has moved in
nearby. Then he discovers that the woman is herself an ex-CIA agent who
once specialised in honeytraps.
She has been forced from her self-imposed retirement to first seduce
Hynd and then persuade him to sign up for a sinister group of former
spooks, led by a renegade Englishman named Casson.
These dispossessed experts in stealth and purveyors of international
havoc have gone into business for themselves. Hynd, forewarned by a
visit from his former employers, who have already asked him to
infiltrate the group, reluctantly agrees to the mission. It is, he
reasons, the only way he can come close to -- and kill -- Casson and
thus ensure Caroline's safety.
Hynd, backed by the author's durable Military Intelligence hero Harry
Seddall, insinuates himself into the group and uncovers a plan to carry
out an audacious rescue.
The Mafia, it seems, have employed the shadowy cabal to launch a
seaborne operation to free 200 of their henchmen, imprisoned on an
island fortress off the Sicilian coast. Treachery is Hynd's companion as
he embarks upon a journey through Europe towards a bloody climax in a
Mafia-controlled village in Southern Italy.
This is the fifth outing for Mayo's cyncical, sardonic, hero Seddall.
The books, and the character, have improved immeasurably with age. The
Masterless Men is a beautifully paced novel which puts the author firmly
in the top drawer of thriller writers. The violence is savage, the plot
wonderfully mesmerising.
Indeed, there is but one problem with the book. And it is that Mayo
tries far too hard to impress the reader with his vocabulary. The result
is that the novel slips, often clumsily, into verbosity.
It is, of course, one of the great pleasures of literature to find the
occasional unfamiliar word in a book. However, when such curious bons
mots appear with monotonous regularity, it becomes both irritating and
tiresome. There is surely no place in the popular novel for words like
''empyrean'' and ''tussore'' (at least not without subtle explanation).
And the sentence ''Our lucubrations seem to have reached a natural
lacuna'' -- even when spoken by a French security chief at the United
Nations -- has the distinctive ring of unreality to it. Mayo, fine
writer though he is, is clearly a man who was given a thesaurus for his
Christmas.
* The Masterless Men is the fifth J K Mayo novel. The fourth, A Shred
of Honour, is published in paperback this week by Pan at #4.99.

THE Princess Royal yesterday urged health service managers to create a
new climate where staff would be actively encouraged to work in a Third
World country for some time.
Addressing the conference of the National Association of Health
Authorities and Trusts, in Glasgow, in her role as patron of the charity
International Health Exchange, she said a period of work with
development agencies overseas gave employees a new perspective and new
ideas.
At present, said the princess, such staff found on their return to the
UK that the skills they had acquired were overlooked.
''Too few NHS employers have recognised the value of this experience
for what it is worth. You are losing expensively trained and talented
people with a huge amount to offer.''
Earlier, Health Minister Lord Fraser announced an additional #100,000
for Scotland's breast-screening programme -- intended to help early
cancer detection by the provision of extra X-rays on each woman scanned.

<HEADLINE>Tourette's Syndrome victim fails to win court support for rehousing claim. Family 'moved five times due to threats'</HEADLINE>

A FATHER of five claims that he and his family have been subjected to
abuse and threats of violence by neighbours because he suffers from the
rare condition, Tourette's Syndrome.
Because of the condition, which makes Desmond McAulay swear
uncontrollably, the family have had to move home five times. His wife
Elizabeth has kept a diary of the incidents, which the family alleges
include a shotgun being fired at their house.
However, a Court of Session judge ruled yesterday that Dumbarton
District Council did not act unreasonably when it refused to treat the
family as homeless and rehouse them.
Lord Coulsfield said that, in October last year, the McAulays applied
to the district council for housing as homeless persons under the
Housing (Scotland) Act 1987.
The council refused the application, pointing out that the family
already had a house at Redburn, Dumbarton, the sixth house they had
occupied in the district, and which they could continue to occupy. The
McAulays took the case to the Court of Session.
Lord Coulsfield said that there was a ''long and unfortunate history''
of efforts to provide the McAulays with accommodation.
Mr McAulay had been diagnosed at the age of seven as suffering from a
condition known as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. The features of the
condition include uncontrollable vocalisations, commonly taking the form
of swear words.
A consultant neurologist told the court that it was easy to envisage a
situation in which someone suffering from the condition would become an
object of suspicion, hostility, and ridicule.
At each of six of the properties the McAulays had occupied in
Dumbarton, the same history had been repeated. They had complained about
the neighbours and the neighbours complained about them.
The family complained about verbal threats, threatening behaviour and,
on one occasion, the discharge of a shotgun at their house, and Mrs
McAulay kept a notebook of the incidents.
Lord Coulsfield said the major issue in the case was whether the
council's decision not to treat the McAulays as homeless was
unreasonable.
The council said it had provided the family with a three-bedroom
end-terraced house with a garden. There was open ground around the house
and the council took the view there was no other property in Dumbarton
District more suitable for the family.
The McAulays argued that the council had power not only to look at its
own housing stock but could seek co-operation from other local
authorities.
The council said these powers could be used only when a family was
homeless, which the McAulays were not, and would involve ''trawling
round'' neighbouring authorities detailing the family's history.
If the family really did feel threatened, they could identify who was
making the threats and apply for an interdict or inform the police.
Lord Coulsfield said the house at Redburn appeared to be perfectly
suitable for the family and the description of the property suggested
that it would be difficult to find anywhere in an urban area more
suitable for the family's particular needs.
The difficulty arose from the harassment from which they were exposed
without, it must be assumed, any fault on their part.
It was clear, however, that the council had considered that issue and
had considered it fairly.
The judge took the view that the McAulays had failed to establish that
Dumbarton had acted unreasonably.

INCIDENTS IN THE RUE LAUGIER
Anita Brookner
Jonathan Cape, #14.99
ASHUTTERED room, a book of Proust. Perhaps some cake later. The
Rubaiyat of Anita Brookner. The sun is too strong, the world too raw,
response too enervating to be a major player. Better by far to cultivate
the chaise-longue and the inward life.
So slight a trace does Brookner's latest French heroine leave on the
world that her story must be spun out of ectoplasm by her daughter. For
evidence she calls upon her mother's notebook which, besides a recipe
for Sauce Mousseline and some book titles, contains only this entry:
''Dames Blanches. La Gaillarderie. Place des Ternes. Sang. Edward'' and
Proust's opening line, ''Longtemps, je me suis couche de bonne heure.''
Maud Gonthier, a closed marigold of a girl, spends her summer holiday
with her widowed mother at her aunt's modest country estate La
Gaillarderie, where her cousin Xavier is visited by two English friends,
quiet Edward, and glamorous, sexually charged, amoral Tyler, whose aura
dominates the company. The neighbour's daughters, raucous and flighty,
come disguised in tennis clothes to play with Tyler, while Maud and
Edward, both attracted to and diminished by him, withdraw into
themselves.
But it is for Tyler that Maud blooms into dark golden beauty and casts
off reticence and common sense when she, he and Edward move on to a
borrowed flat in Paris. Bliss has but a butterfly's span. Tyler takes
wing, leaving Maud pregnant. Edward, more or less as a reflex, proposes,
thus effectively erasing the future in which he hoped to travel and
become a more interesting person. One last irony -- the sang of the
notebook -- Maud loses the baby.
The rest is anticlimax. Edward takes on the secondhand bookshop in
London left to him by a friend of his parents, and Maud lies on the
chaise-longue reading and remembering her life away.
The central choking question, is . . . would Tyler have married her
after all? But this lingering doubt that should hang like a
thunder-cloud over her story is too tentative to be given more than
passing expression. Too tentative, at times, for the reader to catch,
for the reader has no doubts at all.
Of the pair, Edward is the more interesting, but he is sidelined by
his self-knowledge and his decency. As early as the Rue Laugier he
decided his personality was not open to expansion. He was then in his
twenties. As the unhappy Maud fitfully ranged cafes where the air was
''thick with smells of sugar'' Edward was allowed to find Paris
''restful''. Brookner too often foists the attitudes, defeatism, and
vocabulary of female late middle age on her young characters.
The stifling heat and languor of the fateful summer is captured with
wonderful economy -- ''Nobody wanted cheese. Only Harrison and Maud ate
a peach'' -- and the rural middle-class France that formed Maud's
attitudes is summoned superbly. This section of the book is Brookner at
her best. But the long stuffy London indoors calls out for more sensory
accompaniment to the interior monologue -- traffic noises, trapped
flies, above all a contemporary context.
Maud is resting in a shaded room before she is out of her twenties.
When she goes to a wedding in Paris, dressed in a dark red silk
dressmaker suit and hat, Edward wonders if he should buy her a fur-coat.
This elderly young woman, now deceased, is younger than many of her
readers, and the scent of mothballs which haunts the piece often seems
to owe more to eccentricity than to art.
This is not nostalgia. Nostalgia has sharp hunger pangs, whereas this
stifled sorrow for an unsatisfactory past is wilfully negative. And yet
the very waywardness of the Brookner world, where people do things
without compelling motives, is strangely attractive.There is an
unsatisfying strain to this book, as if Brookner herself has failed to
understand Maud. It is a book about reading. The days of Maud Harrison
would be far less dull if the reader were able to join here in the books
which she devours. Ultimately, it is a book in which the characters
themselves seem fashioned out of reading rather than observation from
the life.

A GERMAN court yesterday sentenced three IRA members to jail for a
1989 bomb attack on a British army barracks but released them pending
appeal because they had already served a large part of their sentence in
remand prisons.
A spokesman for the court in Celle said Pauline and Donagh O'Kane and
Patrick Murray had been convicted, like Donna Maguire earlier this week,
of attempted murder, explosives offences, and conspiracy to sabotage.
Pauline O'Kane, 28, was sentenced to nine years in prison. Her
husband, Donagh, 34, and Murray, 51, received sentences of 10 years and
three months.
The group are the first IRA activists to be convicted for terrorist
attacks in Germany.
The court said they had served nearly seven years in remand prisons in

legally binding after a possible appeal.
The four were accused of planting a 330-pound Semtex bomb next to the
dormitory block in Quebec Barracks, Osnabruck.

IT happened last week behind closed doors and drawn curtains in a
motel at Marne la Vallee, a lollipop's throw from Disneyland. While the
British Tories were parading their divisions in public, the French
Socialists were very discreetly talking themselves back into shape as a
left-wing opposition force to be reckoned with.
Previous French Socialist Party Congresses have been self-conscious
stage-managed affairs whose declarations and resolutions have been
intended to make a mark on political history. Last week's meeting, no
less dramatic in its peculiar soft-pedalled way, showed how anxious the
Socialists were to keep possible divisions out of public view. It also
mirrored the shyness of a party which can barely believe it has not only
survived the trauma of recent defeats, but could be on the verge of a
resurrection.
Two years ago the party came close to implosion after an embarrassing
hammering in the General Election which left it with a tiny minority of
seats in the National Assembly. It went on to even worse, polling a
disastrous 14% in the 1994 European election.
Promises made by party first secretary Michel Rocard of a ''big bang''
on the left to assemble allies within and outwith the party turned out
to be no more than what one of his critics had predicted -- ''a fart on
a tin roof''. Mr Rocard was ousted, Jacques Delors, the party's great
hope refused to stand as a presidential candidate and many Socialists
seemed resigned to disappearing altogether.
The quiet revolution that took place last week near Disneyland was the
decision to appoint Lionel Jospin as leader -- the man whose energetic
and authoritative presidential election campaign this year took him from
a desperate position almost into the Elysee.
Mr Jospin, who had not made any public statement since the second
round of the presidential poll on May 7 in which he scored a remarkable
47.5% appeared at the meeting with a firm offer: to take over the party
in the autumn if members agreed, and to remodel it into a credible
political force.
''I'm not talking in the name of a particular axis or in the name of a
camp. I'm ready, nevertheless, to assume responsibility in opening up
and renovating the Socialist Party,'' he said.
At the same time, the small but highly-influential Parti Republicain
which is part of the UDF group of right-wing parties was electing itself
a leader in more embarrassing circumstances. The outgoing chairman, Mr
Gerard Longuet, minister of industry in the Government of former Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur, is currently in between prison sentences for
various corruption affairs.
Mr Longuet was democratically replaced by Francois Leotard, former
defence minister, now setting out into the political desert for having
backed the wrong man, Mr Balladur, in the presidential campaign. After
the party vote, Mr Longuet and Mr Leotard embraced each other in public,
effusively even by French standards. Less than 48 hours later the
unfortunate Mr Leotard suffered a minor heart attack.

Washington, Friday
AMERICA'S best-known secret terrorist now wants to be an author. The
Unabomber, who specialises in sending mail bombs to scientists and
businessmen, has sent a 35,000-word manuscript to the newspapers and
demanded that they publish it.
If they do, he will end his campaign, that has killed three people and
wounded 23 in 16 attacks in 17 years. If they don't, he will strike
again.
Earlier this week he threatened to blow up an airliner flying out of
Los Angeles. Although he claimed the next day that the threat was a
prank, extreme security measures remain in place.
Millions of parcels and letters have been delayed and passengers have
to go through elaborate security controls before flying.
Unabomber is a Luddite and anarchist. In the message, sent to the New
York Times, the Washington Post, Scientific American, and Penthouse, he
says: ''The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a
disaster for the human race'' because organised modern society ''has to
force people to behave in ways that are increasingly remote from the
natural pattern of human behaviour.''
He says: ''The industrial-technological system has got to be
eliminated, and to us almost any means that may be necessary for that
purpose are justified.''
The system has robbed contemporary people of their ''autonomy'' and
their rapport with nature, meaning ''wild nature: those aspects of the
functioning of the Earth and its living things that are independent of
human management and free of human interference and control.''
The manuscript, which would fill seven pages of a newspaper like this,
defends terrorism. ''Since revolutionaries work to overthrow the society
in which they live, they have no reason to abide by its moral code.''
He attacks what he calls ''leftism'' for de-humanising people, and
conservatives for their selfishness. He shows considerable historical
and political knowledge, and discusses nuclear physics in a letter to
the Scientific American.
He sent his article to Penthouse because its publisher offered to
print it, but noted that if the serious papers did not publish it, while
Penthouse did, he would reserve the right to make one last lethal
attack.
He will stop sending bombs to kill people if the Times or the Post
publish the article, but they must also publish up to three follow-up
articles he will send in future years, and he reserves the right to
sabotage industrial targets, without killing anyone.
He denounces the FBI, which he calls incompetent, and denies that he
has a fixation with wood or that he is motivated by jealousy for the
success of the Oklahoma City bombers.
Specialists believe that he is a solitary man aged about 40, living in
or near Sacramento, California, who has a pathological hatred for
computers, airlines, and modern technology. It is thought he might have
been sacked as a computer worker by an airline.

In the latest in his occasional series on great European opera houses,
Conrad Wilson sounds out Flemish Opera's homes.
THE Flemish Opera is what Scottish Opera once hoped to be: a full-time
company based on two neighbouring cities, with performances divided
equally between each of them. For Scottish Opera it proved a pipe dream.
The regular shuttling of productions between Glasgow and Edinburgh was
never a feasibility and Edinburgh was the loser.
In Belgium, however, the scheme has worked brilliantly. Antwerp and
Ghent -- about 40 miles apart -- enjoy alternating slices of the
operatic cake, and alternating opening nights for every production,
presented in a pair of nicely scaled, attractively traditional theatres.
The season, loosely spread, lasts from September until July, with each
work having a run of performances in each city. Scots who fancy an
operatic change of scene, and a dip into an enticingly different
repertoire, are recommended to sample it and compare.
Belgium's immediate attraction is accessibility -- it's easier to
reach than Germany or Italy, and cheaper than Paris. Motorists, emerging
after breakfast from the North Sea ferry, may customarily think of it as
no more than a lunch-stop on route to elsewhere, but Antwerp and Ghent,
with their grand churches and good food, are worth lingering in.
Especially if an opera is scheduled.
My advice would be to stay in whichever city happens to have a
performance -- it was in Ghent that I saw Verdi's Don Carlo recently --
but to visit the other place, too.
There was a time when opera in Flanders seemed like the kiss of death.
In the 1980s things changed. First, the Ghent-born Gerard Mortier -- who
now runs the Salzburg Festival -- became boss of the Monnaie Theatre in
Brussels, and won instant acclaim by attracting the world's most
progressive directors to work with him.
In response, Ghent and Antwerp merged their separate (and at that time
fairly feeble) companies to form the Flemish Opera. Initial setbacks
appear to have been sorted out thanks to an inspirational young
administrator, the Antwerp-born Marc Clemeur, who is already showing
much of Mortier's flair. Next season's offerings include Handel's Serse,
Tippett's King Priam, Peter Maxwell Davies's Cinderella, Puccini's The
Girl of the Golden West, and Korngold's study of death and decay in
nineteenth-century Bruges, Die Tote Stadt.
Clemeur favours boldly thematic programme planning. The Tippett, in
May 1996, follows the company's recent success with Britten's Billy
Budd. The Puccini, a year from now, forms the latest instalment of a
cycle of all his operas in which the new-wave director, Robert Carsen,
is looking at each piece afresh. A Handel and Monteverdi cycle has been
inspired by the presence in Belgium of such eminent baroque specialists
as Rene Jacobs, Philippe Herreweghe, and Sigiswald Kuijken.
There are also lunchtime recitals in the foyers, cleverly linked with
current productions -- Madama Butterfly has provided an excuse to
perform Japanese chamber music. And the chorus and orchestra have
regular non-operatic assignments, such as Beethoven's Missa Solemnis in
Ghent Cathedral in September.
Though the Ghent and Antwerp theatres have points in common -- each
holds about 1000 people, each is called the Royal Flemish Opera House,
each is city-owned, and each is occupied rent-free by the opera company
-- they are pleasingly different in style.
Ghent's theatre, which backs on to a canal, is neo-classical, dating
from 1838, with a covered, curving entrance designed originally for
horses and carriages. The interior is ornate, with a couple of
flamboyant but now somewhat dilapidated ballrooms.
The performance of Don Carlo had plenty of punch. Under Stefan
Soltesz, the company's volatile musical director, the brass snarled and
the strings phrased passionately.
The company democratically splits its resources -- orchestra, chorus,
offices, rehearsal rooms, wardrobe department -- between the two
theatres. Antwerp's auditorium, in contrast with Ghent's, is pure art
deco, dating from 1920 and lovingly preserved.
In Ghent, the burning of the Flemish heretics in the stark auto-da-fe
scene sent perceptible frissons through the packed house. Ezio
Frigerio's shiny black decor, claustrophobically exploited by Gilbert
Deflo's production, had the mobility most performances of Don Carlo
seriously lack. Performed at speed in the four-act Italian version, it
left time afterwards for a midnight supper in the Restaurant Flor at
Grote Huidevetterstraat 10, a short walk along the canal.
Eating in Belgium is not cheap. But standards, especially in Antwerp,
are conspiciously high, and good restaurants are tantalisingly
plentiful. A two-night stay would let you try four of them.
The Flor's lobster supper consisted of a whole fresh crustacean per
person, served in its shell on a bed of asparagus, boiled potatoes, and
hot hollandaise sauce. The restaurant, a lofty room in what looked like
former industrial premises, had its own fish tank and a small stream
flowing through the stone floor from kitchen to rear courtyard. The
lavish wine list had Alsace (whose vineyards lie within easy reach of
Belgium) as its principal focus.
In both cities, seafood predominates. One smart Antwerp restaurant, at
the mouth of the long pedestrian tunnel beneath the River Scheldt, is
called Het Niewe Palinghuis -- the New Eel House. Though it serves
luscious white asparagus in season, eels are what count, cooked in a
green sauce and a variety of other ways.
Nearer the opera house, Fouquets at De Keyserlei 17 is a colourful art
nouveau extravaganza that seems determined to outdo its famous Parisian
counterpart. Its seafood and steak are excellent, but more authentically
Belgian art nouveau is to be found on the city's south side in the
residential Berchem district (reachable by one of Antwerp's superb fast
trams) where a cluster of streets, all dating from the early years of
the century, celebrate the style with the curious fantasy.
While in this part of Antwerp, eat at the Euterpia, a residence that
has been discreetly transformed into a restaurant (dinner only, no
credit cards). The address is Generaal Capiaumontstraat 2, and you
almost expect to see Rennie Mackintosh sitting there. The owner, when
not behind the bar, lives upstairs. The decor is more fascinating than
the food, but the food is pretty good.
In all these places you must expect to pay at least #60 for two. But
there are cheaper treats to be had in Antwerp: mussels and chips with
mayonnaise are an old-fashioned form of Belgian gluttony, elevated to
something infinitely better than it sounds. You can eat them at the Cafe
des Arts, another nice slice of period architecture, now hemmed in by a
McDonald's on the corner of Teniersplaats near the opera house.
* Seats for the opera, costing from about #40 downwards, can be booked
by phone or fax and paid by credit card. For details of next season's
repertoire apply to De Vlaamse Opera, Dienst Communicatie, Van
Ertbornstraat 8, 2018 Antwerp (Tel 03 231 0784, Fax 03 231 0785). The
box-office in each city is open from Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to
5.45pm, with a summer closure between July 12 and August 15. English is
spoken.
* Belgian hotels are no bargain, but the Columbus, opposite the
Antwerp theatre, is pleasant, convenient, and not over-priced at #75 for
a double room. In Ghent, the smart Novotel Centrum at #93 is well placed
for the cathedral and within walking distance of the theatre.
* Sabena has direct flights from Scotland to Brussels, with train
connections to Antwerp and Ghent (Antwerp's Central Station, a vast
temple mixing neo-classicism with art nouveau, is one of life's
experiences). British Midland and British Airways fly via Heathrow but,
if you have time to spare, the pleasantest way to reach Belgium is the
overnight crossing from Hull to Zeebrugge.
* The much-vaunted free supper offered by North Sea Ferries is nothing
special, but the prawns are limitless and the Chablis cheap. On the
other hand, Brussels must be the only airport in Europe with a seafood
bar where you can feast (not inexpensively) on lobster while awaiting
your flight. Gatwick please note.

Differing expectations and opportunities in the East and West mould
the way women manage motherhood and paid work, as JUDY MACKIE discovers
TAKE four women, from China, Scotland, the US, and Japan, and ask them
how they manage to combine motherhood with paid employment.
The answers -- explored at a Sociology conference at the University of
Aberdeen this week, and the theme of a new book launched by conference
organisers Norman Stockman, Norman Bonney and Sheng Xuewen -- reveal an
intriguingly diverse range of life experiences, shaped by the politics,
economies and culture of each society.
The Chinese woman has a full-time job, which demands at least 40 hours
of her time each week. She has two childcare options -- a subsidised
workplace or neighbourhood creche, or her husband's mother, who lives
nearby. She and her husband earn relatively equal salaries, and divide
the household chores between them.
The Scottish woman would like to work full-time to continue her
career, but childcare facilities are too expensive. Instead, she opts
for lower status part-time work, which enables her to spend more time
with her toddler, who goes to a childminder while she is working. She
also does most of the housework, cooking and shopping.
The American woman would like to spend more time with her
four-month-old baby, but works full-time in order to receive full health
insurance benefits. Childcare is expensive, but available. She and her
partner, who also works full-time are often at loggerheads over
housework.
The Japanese woman does not go out to work. Instead, she is
responsible for looking after her two young children and her home, and
she also controls the family finances. Her husband is rarely at home
during the week, as he works long hours. In Japan, many women believe a
good husband is healthy and absent.
These women are typical of hundreds surveyed in the four societies by
Stockman, Bonney, Sheng et al between 1987 and the present day.
The differences they found between East and West are striking, but
there are also universal similarities. In each case, the women are not
necessarily happy with their circumstances and -- even in the Chinese
example -- believe their partners should share more domestic
responsibility.
Dr Stockman, a lecturer at the University of Aberdeen specialising in
Chinese Sociology, explains the Chinese woman's plight:''Research is
showing that many Chinese women are unhappy that they don't have enough
time for their children or themselves.
''They have a high-pressure life -- it is a poor country, transport is
difficult and they may have to travel some distance to work. They are
beginning to think things would possibly be better if they didn't have
full-time jobs.''
This apparent female backlash against post-revolution communist
ideology, which sees men and women as equally necessary employment
resources to an efficient industrial society, is rendered more
threatening by pressure from burgeoning new business.
According to Stockman, as communism breaks down throughout China,
pockets of private enterprise are resisting the idea of employing women
with young children, in order to avoid the expense of creche subsidies
and paid maternity leave. It appears the idea of equality, introduced to
China only in the late 1950s, is already being eroded by capitalist
economic pressures.
In addition, he suspects that Chinese men do not pull their weight
when it comes to housework and childcare.
''In China there is an enormous degree of shared domestic
responsibilities, but one has to say, just like anywhere else, women
still do most and children are still seen as their primary
responsibility.''
Dr Bonney, a senior lecturer at the University of Aberdeen with an
interest in Japanese sociology, describes the dichotomy of feelings
experienced in Japan by women with young children, where tradition plays
an important part in shaping gender roles:
''Some Japanese women are influenced by Western ideas and want the
freedom to enter paid employment, while others value their domestic
role, because it gives them a lot of autonomy in the home, including
control fo the purse-strings.''
In the US, there is evidence that many women would prefer not to work
full-time, but do so out of necessity, and that the idea of mothers in
full-time employment is not greeted with much enthusiasm by their
partners or the State.
''The State provides little in the way of childcare, and men, despite
all the talk about New Men, are not necessarily doing all that much more
than they would if the women were at home all day,'' says Stockman.
In Scotland, as in the rest of Britain, where childcare is also mostly
private and expensive, part-time work is seen by many as the ideal
solution, enabling women to enter the workplace and still have time to
spend with their children.
Stockman and Bonney say there is a lot of evidence that despite the
relatively low rates of pay, women with part-time jobs do not want to
work full-time.
However, women hoping to build up a career have little opportunity
while working part-time.
''The downside is that part-time work doesn't have a future. It may be
convenient and comfortable and fit in with domestic life, but it also
fits into a scenario where men get more promotion opportunities and
better jobs, while women's careers come to a standstill,'' says
Stockman.

Moscow, Friday
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin sacked three top security ministers today on
the eve of a crucial no-confidence vote in parliament, shaking up his
Cabinet in a bid to defuse Russia's worst political crisis in two years.
The three men dismissed were Interior Minister Viktor Yerin, Federal
Security Service chief Sergei Stepashin and Deputy Prime Minister
Nikolai Yegorov who had offered under pressure to quit the previous day
over the Chechen siege at Budyonnovsk.
Mr Pavel Grachev, Mr Yeltsin's embattled defence minister, survived
the high-level purge.
The moves all but guaranteed the failure of of tomorrow's
no-confidence vote in the State Duma or lower house of parliament -- a
vote that already had been expected to fizzle out.
Mr Yeltsin's press secretary, Mr Sergei Medvedev, had said earlier
that several personnel changes were planned as Mr Yeltsin tries to end
the political uproar that resulted from the recent hostage crisis in
southern Russia.
The Duma had demanded the sacking of the so-called ''power ministers''
or top security officials for their handling of the hostage-taking, in
which scores of people were killed.
The men were also prime figures in the so-called ''party of war,'' who
took a lead in planning Russia's widely criticised six-month-old war
against the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
Mr Grachev, Mr Yeltsin's long-standing ally, was conspicuously absent
from the list of sacked officials, even though the Duma had also called
for his dismissal.
The sackings had been ''a hard decision'' for the president but took
into account the men's ''miscalculations and shortcomings,'' Mr Medvedev
said.
Mr Yevgeny Kuznetsov, the governor of the Stavropol territory, site of
the hostage-taking, was also sacked.
The political crisis, the worst in Russia since the storming of
parliament in October 1993, was touched off by a the Budyonnovsk
tragedy. On June 14, Chechen rebels seeking to end the war seized
hundreds of civilians and killed scores in a raid on that city.
* The United States and Russia reached agreements at a session of the
joint commission on economic and technological co-operation today that
will help control the spread of conventional weapons and speed up the
dismantling of former Soviet nuclear warheads.-- AP/Reuter.

The Herald's regular reviewers tune in to the best sounds around.
Mutineer, Warren Zevon (Giant)
* The quirkily-mutinous Mr Zeev continues on his singular way, singing
his rococo songs in which humble pianists garner the acclaim more
usually accorded Western gunslingers; runaway junk-bond kings abandon
complex Wall Street finagling for the simple lure of bingo, and circus
clowns meet unfunny ends. Highlights? More than several. The
Indifference Of Heaven, a ramshackle epic about resignation and defeat;
a touchingly querulous version of Judee Sill's Jesus Was A Crossmaker;
Poisonous Lookalike, which addresses the problem of the attitudinal
changes which can affect personal relationships; Monkey Wash Donkey
Rinse, a hellish hoedown. But despite all these pluses, it's hard to
come away with anything other than a nagging sense of under-achievement
. . . as though Warren finds the songwriting process too easy.
Fabulous Flips Volume 2, various artists (Ace)
* A COLLECTION of echoing guitars, rude bass bouncefulness, greasy
hiccups, and wanton teenage yodellings recorded in the original
rock'n'roll years 1955-59. All the tunes presented here were the B-sides
to hit singles, but all are of A-1 quality. Among the better-known names
you'll find Slim Harpo, Big Jay McNeely and Chuck Berry, the latter
singing Little Queenie. Flipping fabulous, grand-daddio.
HIStory, Michael Jackson (Epic)
* HIStory? HISSboo would be more like it. For #25 you get one CD
containing the slinky old eighties hits, plus another CD featuring the
new whiny, ugly, self-justifying stuff wherein His Wacko-ness moans
about how cruelly his blameless life has been blighted by unwarranted
scandal. Sample these MJ lyrics and then tell me I'm wrong. ''No-one
understands me/ They view it as such strange eccentricities/ 'Cos I keep
kidding around/ Like a child, but pardon me'' (from Childhood). The
self-proclaimed King of Pop is dead; long live the kings of pop who have
freshly arrived to bury him. HISSoff, Freako.
DAVID BELCHER
Beethoven, Missa Solemnis (Decca)
* THE starry line-up for this performance will almost certainly
guarantee the sales. Sir Georg Solti conducts the Berlin Philharmonic,
and the soloists are big names all: Julia Varady, Iris Vermillion,
Vinson Cole, and Rene Pape. But check it out first; it is taken from a
live performance, and, is not one of Decca's finest recordings. The
sound is often vague, boxed-in, and oocasionally smudged. And some of
it, under Sir Georg's businesslike conducting, is unlovingly played.
Brahms, A German Requiem (Decca)
* NOTHING unloving about the playing here, from Herbert Blomstedt with
his San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, chorus, and soloists Elizabeth
Norberg-Schulz and the great baritone Wolfgang Holzmair. Quite an
idiosyncratic interpretation, at times massively slow, this is a German
Requiem full of restraint, great dignity, and with a rich, sonorous
quality.
MICHAEL TUMELTY
Standards in Norway, Keith Jarrett Trio (ECM)
* JARRETT'S potential adventures into the vast American song
repertoire seem limited only by the available material (ie: not at all)
and here's further evidence of an utterly simpatico piano trio at work.
Porch Songs, Cathryn Craig (Goldrush)
* RECORDED on, yes, her Nashville porch, complete with constant
cricket chorus, Craig launches the Perth-based Goldrush label with an
affectingly sung collection of songs about life, love, guitars and dogs.
The arrangements are kept simple and the end result is suitably intimate
if a little heavy on the heartbreaks.

<HEADLINE>French U-turn on Schengen. Europe border pact in shambles</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977617141</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE DRIVE towards a more united Europe suffered a setback yesterday
when France did a U-turn on the Schengen Accord and restored border
controls.
The decision, which was being seen as supporting Britain's tough stand
against a borders-free Europe, was taken to keep out drug traffickers,
illegal immigrants, and criminals.
It throws the Schengen Accord into a shambles. The agreement between
seven EU countries, including France, had been intended to let them
press on ahead of the rest and implement the European single market
requirement to scrap police and Customs checks at land borders and air
and sea ports.
Under the accord it had been agreed to strengthen Europe's external
borders with increased controls to enable the dream of completely free
movement within the 15 member states to be achieved.
But France acknowledged yesterday what Britain and Ireland have said
all along -- that remote border controls cannot replace systematic
checking at national frontiers.
The accord between France, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Portugal, the
Netherlands and Spain has been in trouble for months and fell apart
yesterday when the other six refused to allow France another six-month
delay before fully signing on.
French prime minister Alain Juppe wanted more time to confirm that the
system was up and running, with effective measures against illegal
immigration.
Schengen arrangements have already been abandoned by the Dutch at
Schiphol airport, Amsterdam, where ''smart'' cards to distinguish
between privileged travellers from the seven member states and the rest
had caused confusion -- and, ironically, opened the door for illegal
immigrants and drug trafficking through forgery.
Even on the Eurostar train link from Waterloo to Brussels there had
been recrimination and confusion.
British travellers from London should be screened at Brussels as
travellers from a non-Schengen country, but those joining at Lille, the
only stop on the way, should not be checked because they boarded within
a Schengen state.
Britain has always argued that it would preserve its border controls
because its national frontiers are not simply internal borders within
the EU, but also its own external borders.
British Ministers have insisted for years they would never leave
responsibility for Customs and police checks to anonymous officials
hundreds of miles away on the EU's external frontier.
But British officials resisted a ''told you so'' riposte as Schengen
collapsed yesterday.
''This underlines the political sensitivities and practical
difficulties of what the Schengen countries have been trying to do,''
said a spokesman in Brussels.
There is also relief that the setback postpones the day when Britain
and Ireland face European court proceedings for not joining in and fully
opening their frontiers.
The French pull-out has thrown the whole agreement into confusion,
raising new doubts as to whether the system can work at all.
Officially the other countries involved are keeping up the pretence of
a border-free Europe -- but it cannot become a reality until more
governments are prepared to cede national control of their frontiers.
* The EU, which has been angered by Washington's pullout from talks on
a global pact to free up trade in financial services, won tentative
backing yesterday from key countries for a deal without the United
States.
The idea was put by EU officials to envoys to the World Trade
Organisation just hours before a deadline for the original accord was
due to run out and EU ministers gathered in Geneva to try to rescue it
in some form.
''The reaction was totally positive,'' said a trade official present
at the informal closed-door meeting of the WTO's financial services
committee.
''There was a general feeling of relief in the room that somebody had
found a way out of this problem, which was this clock ticking away,'' a
senior EU official said.
The EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said it was ''vital that
the American move does not lead to the unravelling of the potential
deal.''

THE Labour-controlled Dumbarton and Clydebank Council has been cleared
of ''jobs for the boys'' allegations over the appointment of its deputy
chief executive and solicitor.
The council's SNP group had accused it of malpractice over the
appointment of former Labour councillor Ian Leitch to the #60,000-a-year
post, after being narrowly beaten for the top #73,000 post by his new
boss, Mr Michael Watters.
Mr Watters recommended Mr Leitch for the job, which was not
advertised, and it was this that upset the SNP and members of Unison,
the local government workers' union.
But the Scottish Local Government Staff Commission said there had been
no breach of guidelines because none were drafted when Mr Leitch was
appointed.
The solicitor to Clydebank District Council gave up the leadership of
Dumbarton District Council when ''twin tracking'' was banned by new
legislation following the Widdicombe Inquiry report.
Staff Commission secretary Ted Davison said it was now the case that
jobs had to be advertised.
He added: ''If the question were to arise now, we would be quite clear
on this, but at the time we were still mulling it over as a principle.''
However, SNP councillor John Wailes said Labour had got off the hook
on a technicality, and that Mr Leitch should not have been appointed on
the basis of ''a nod and a wink''.
SNP group leader Councillor Bill Mackechnie said the procedure adopted
by the Labour group had been ''outrageous''.
Labour leader Mary Campbell said the Staff Commission statement proved
the procedural correctness of Mr Leitch's appointment.
She said combining the post of deputy chief executive and solicitor to
the council would save #70,000 a year.
She added: ''I would like to stress that the council has an
independent personnel adviser who was satisfied the procedure was
correct.''
She added: ''The combined local knowledge and experience of Mr Watters
and Mr Leitch is considered to be of immense value to the council.''

Ken Gallacher notes that, by any one of many definitions, Tony Bennett
is a true jazz singer.
IF ANY subject is guaranteed to cause argument among jazz aficionados
then it is surely that of singers. Or, to be more precise, what exactly
makes a jazz singer. The New Yorker critic Whitney Balliett once
declared: ''The most popular definition of a jazz singer is that there
is no definition.''
Then he added his own, suggesting that any artiste who makes his
material swing qualifies for the title ''jazz singer''.
It is easy to see what Balliett meant even though he over-simplifies
the whole thorny question. More than simply swinging is necessary.
A singer must also approach the melody the way an instrumentalist
might, he or she must be ready to bend notes the way a jazz musician
would, and, always, there must be an inherent respect for the best
tunes.
All of which brings me to the point and that is that Tony Bennett, who
appears in Glasgow tomorrow week, is, in my book, a jazz singer.
He qualifies for that on Balliett's definition and also on those I
have added myself. Then, there's another thing about Bennett which
carries him into the jazz pantheon, and that is the has respect and love
for the musicians he works with.
When Bennett talks about his art it is inevitable that the
conversation will be littered with references to some of the giants of
jazz. He will tell you of advice he received from the one-time Ellington
saxophone giant Ben Webster.
He'll enthuse over the music of Ellington and Basie and Woody Herman,
all bands he worked with over the years. And he can point to the albums
he has made in that kind of company.
If anyone doubts his credentials after that then they can look at the
musicians who have worked with him on a regular basis, pianists Ralph
Sharon, who will again be at the helm in the Concert Hall, Bernie
Leighton and John Bunch who were both with him on previous Glasgow
visits and cornet players Bobby Hackett and Ruby Braff who were used
intermittently by the singer on club and concert gigs.
It's an impressive roster and underlines Bennett's background in jazz
music. For any of those who harbour doubts then there are albums around
which will prove the point and none are better than those he made with
the Ruby Braff/George Barnes Quartet some 20 years ago.
The ingredients are the finest . . .
Braff and Barnes were a flawless combination, Bennett is a stylist who
meshed brilliantly with the drummerless quartet and the songs were by
the incomparable team of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart.
Bennett and his co-stars produced two memorable albums which may still
be around -- certainly they should be available!
The art of the music and of jazz singing is distilled in these
versions. For example there is a dramatic ballad interpretation of Lover
as well as definitive readings of Small Hotel and I Wish I Were In Love
Again which linger in the memory forever . . .
Interestingly enough the collaboration broke up because both
cornettist Braff and his guitarist partner Barnes felt there was little
room for them to solo when Bennett was there virtually as another horn.
That is basically what he did and still does -- his vocal instincts
follow the lines that a trumpet or a saxophone might take. That's what
makes him a jazz singer.
Oh, and there is another thing which allows him into that
less-than-crowded hall of fame, and that's the love I mentioned earlier.
The last time Bennett was here, two years ago, my daughter met him and
told him how Bobby Hackett had once stayed at our home on his one and
only British tour.
Bennett's eyes, she told me, filled with tears and he told her:
''Bobby played like an angel, no-one ever played like he did. You know,
I still miss him . . .''
If you listen again to Bennett's version of The Very Thought of You
and the blissful obbligato by Hackett you can understand that.
And you may also come to realise that Tony Bennett is a jazz singer
and that when he headlines the Glasgow Festival he has paid his dues.

A CYPRIOT criminal court yesterday ordered another postponement to a
manslaughter case involving three British soldiers which has been tied
up in legal wrangles for months.
Soldiers Alan Ford, 26, from Birmingham, Jeff Pernell, 23, from
Oldbury in the West Midlands, and Justin Fowler, 27, from Falmouth,
Cornwall, face charges of manslaughter, abduction and conspiracy to rape
Danish tour guide Louise Jensen, 23. They have not yet entered a plea.
The court in Larnaca chaired by Judge Takis Eliades adjourned the
hearing until July 17, pending a ruling from the island's Supreme Court
on the procedure which should be followed to investigate complaints by
Ford and Pernell.
They claim they have been deprived of their right to a fair trial
because prison guards seized letters they had adressed to their lawyers
with instructions on their legal defence last November. -- Reuter.

THE Glasgow Development Agency yesterday confirmed the appointment of
Mr Michael Lunn, ousted as chairman and chief executive of Whyte &amp;
Mackay, as its new chairman.
There had been speculation that, for technical reasons, Mr Lunn might
not be eligible to take over the GDA chairmanship following his
departure from the whisky company.
However, Mr Lunn, who is deputy chairman at present, will take over
from Mr Forbes Macpherson at the GDA's annual public meeting on
Thursday.
Mr Macpherson said: ''There was never the slightest doubt that Michael
Lunn would become chairman of GDA. Recent press comment surrounding the
issue was completely speculative and without foundation.
''Michael's resignation as chairman and chief executive of Whyte &amp;
Mackay was obviously reported to the board. However, the issue of
whether or not he should become chairman was never in doubt. Under
current regulations, Michael is eligible to remain on the board and
therefore take up his position as chairman, for at least a year.
''Michael Lunn is a highly successful and experienced businessman
whose considerable talents will undoubtedly be in demand in Glasgow. The
board agreed that there was not the slightest reason why the
arrangements which have been put in place should be altered.''

John Fowler and illustrator Mark McLellan find themselves in
uncomfortably hot water as they investigate one of Neptune's moons.
WARM springs sound nice, but not this one. Hot baths are out. We are
looking -- courtesy of Mark McLellan's starbrush -- at one of the
geysers which spew from the icy surface of Triton, one of Neptune's
moons.
This geyser is far different from any to be found spouting steam on
earth. Iceland, New Zealand -- forget it. Triton's geysers whoosh up
extremely unpleasant jets of nitrogen gas to a great height, somewhere
around 8000 metres, which is about summit level with Everest or K2 in
the Himalayas.
Then something strange happens. Up to this point the gas columns rise
vertically, like smoke from the chimney of a country cottage on a still
day. But once they reach this altitude it's thought that fierce cosmic
gales hit them. Suddenly the gas columns execute a 90-degree bend in
space as they are whirled downwind. Not quite a U-turn but pretty
dramatic.
What isn't ice on the surface of Triton is rock. On the other hand
this moon has an atmosphere, which makes it sound a little more
hospitable. Far from it. Triton's atmosphere is made up of the nitrogen
it expels from its innards.
An atmosphere is a gas envelope surrounding any celestial body, held
in place by such factors as the body's mass, the force of gravity and
the rate of spin. For a moon to have an atmosphere is a rare
distinction. Apart from our own moon, whose atmosphere is so thin that
it's barely detectable, only three moons in the whole solar system are
known to possess atmospheres.
Neptune, eighth planet from the earth and invisible to the naked eye,
has at least seven other moons. It is a bluish world constantly swept by
turbulence. One mighty storm centre is marked by the Great Dark Spot,
very similar to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, a feature as large as the
earth and discovered by the space craft Voyager 2 when it passed Neptune
in August 1989.
The planet has very faint rings whose spotty character is caused by
the uneven distribution or clumping of matter within them.
This month's constellation is Aquila, the eagle. It can be seen in the
south-eastern sky about midnight. Most prominent in the group is Altair,
one of the brightest stars in the sky (shining at a magnitude of 0.77).
In fact Altair is 10 times more luminous than the sun, but its light
wanes over the vast distances it has to travel to reach us -- it lies
nearly 17 light years away.
Aquila sits on the Milky Way, that vast spiral galaxy visible on clear
nights to sailors and country folk whose eyes are not dimmed by the
glare of city lights. Theoretically if you could tilt the Milky Way so
that it was end on you'd see Aquila nicely in perspective.
Exit Mars this month. It will be lost to view by the end of July as it
sinks below the western horizon. Jupiter, however, is a brilliant object
in southern skies between dusk and midnight.
* Research by Mark McLellan.

The women were squeaky clean but shared a passion for a bigamous
charmer who killed them for cash. Eighty years on, Hamish Richardson
finds there are still questions to be answered in the case of the
bathtub murders.
EXACTLY 80 years ago, on July 1, 1915, one of the most evil of British
murderers was condemned to death. Exactly how many young ladies George
Joseph Smith killed is not known as in each of three known cases he
succeeded in fooling both a coroner and a jury. Married legally once and
bigamously at least seven times Smith provided a fatal allure to women,
many of whom fell under his hypnotic spell.
His methods were simple. He sought out lonely but respectable
spinsters in English seaside resorts, he thereafter conducted a
whirlwind romance, went through a marriage ceremony, and then having
exchanged wills (he had nothing to leave and was in any event using a
false name) he drowned his bride in a bath. He then collected his
windfall, whether it was savings or insurance proceeds, and promptly
disappeared. A few months later a similar tragedy occurred elsewhere but
until December 1914 nobody connected them.
The cause of Smith's downfall was a lack of sensational news during
the weekend of December 20. Because there was nothing better to report,
the News of the World carried the story of the inquest into the death of
Margaret Lofty (or Mrs Lloyd as she so recently became) under the
heading ''Bride's tragic fate on day after wedding''.
The brother of one of Smith's earlier victims who had never been
satisfied by the circumstances of his sister's death wrote to Scotland
Yard and drew their attention to a series of remarkable coincidences.
Alice Burnham had died in her bath a year previously having just gone
through a marriage ceremony and having, like Miss Lofty, just insured
her life. In each case the deaths had occurred on a Friday night
(convenient for ensuring a quick coroner's verdict on a Saturday) and
the ''husband'' had popped out to the shops when the tragedy had
happened.
Police quickly discovered that John Lloyd was the same person as the
Mr Smith who had married Alice and that both were in fact George Joseph
Smith whom they knew well as a fraudster who had already duped a number
of women out of their savings. They immediately reopened both files.
More coincidences then came to light. Somehow in each case Smith had
persuaded his bride shortly before her death to tell a doctor that she
was subject to fits, a medical history which was then repeated in a
letter to her relatives. In each case nobody had ever heard of the
illness before. It was thus not surprising that the doctor chosen (who
had never seen the patient before) could find no symptoms to support the
story but having no reason to dispute it he recorded it in his notes. He
thus provided Smith with an explanation for the tragedy which followed
in each case within 24 hours.
Smith was arrested on a charge of using a false name when he married
Margaret Lofty while further investigations took place. These revealed
that in January 1915 he had at least five ''wives'' living, only one of
which could claim to be his legal spouse.
Of far more significance to the authorities was the tragic discovery
of another case of a death in a bath. Nobody can have had worse luck
than Bessie Mundy, a lady who lived on the income from #2500 left in
trust by her bank-manager father. In 1910 while in Weymouth she met a Mr
Williams who swept her off her feet and married her a week later. Too
late he discovered that her money was tied up in trust, so having stolen
all her savings he disappeared. A sadder but alas no wiser Miss Munday
returned to her boarding-house existence.
Eighteen months later fate took a cruel twist. While out walking in
Weston-Super-Mare Bessie saw her husband strolling along the seafront. A
reconciliation was effected and despite the advice of all her relatives
Bessie believed her Prince Charming had returned. He, for his part,
appeared more interested in what was the position of the trust money.
A solicitor was consulted and he recommended that the opinion of
counsel be obtained. That opinion was that the trustees had absolute
control over the capital of the fund ''during Mrs Williams's lifetime'';
those final four words sealed Bessie's fate. Within a week she had made
a will in favour of her husband, told the doctor about ''fits'', written
to her relatives reporting on her problem and drowned in a bath at Herne
Bay while her husband was out buying tomatoes. Reluctantly the trustees
handed over the #2500 to Williams.
It did not take Inspector Neil of Scotland Yard long to find out that
Williams, Lloyd, and Smith were the same person and on August 13, while
thousands were dying in the Dardanelles, George Joseph Smith had to be
supported to the scaffold at Maidstone prison.
What has continued to puzzle doctors, lawyers, and anybody who read
about the case was how he managed to do it. How 80 years ago did he
succeed in persuading three middle-class modest women who barely knew
him to leave their bathroom doors unlocked so early in their
acquaintance. How did he succeed in persuading them to tell lies to a
doctor and in each case write a false story to their relatives? Nobody
will ever know the true answer although some who attended his trial
claimed to see hypnotic powers within his eyes.
The mechanics of the murder were not fully resolved either, although
one experiment carried out at the time gave a possible solution. A nurse
in a bathing costume volunteered to get into the bath in which Margaret
Lofty had died. Watched by doctors and lawyers, a policeman without
warning pulled her feet up causing her to slide under water. It was only
with considerable difficulty that she was revived. For Bessie Mundy,
Alice Burnham, Margaret Lofty, and possibly others no such attempt to
revive was made.

Seoul, Friday
TRAPPED in rubble, convinced he was going to die in the darkness, Hong
Sung-tae pleaded with a stranger to fulfill his last wish.
''He told me that he wasn't likely to make it, and asked me to deliver
his will to his family,'' said Kwon Eun-jong, who was trapped nearer the
top of the wreckage of the shopping mall that collapsed yesterday
killing at least 113 people and injuring 910 others.
Heavy concrete slabs and steel rods surrounded Mr Hong, and his ankle
was pinned. The heavy smell of alcohol from broken bottles in the
basement supermarket where Ms Kwon worked helped keep her awake.
''He asked me to find two bank books in his school desk and hand them
to his wife and son,'' recalled Ms Kwon, a 22-year-old former aerobics
instructor.
As she was carried out 15 hours after the collapse, she said goodbye
to Mr Hong. She could faintly see him waving back in the light of the
rescuer's flashlights.
The poignant tale captured South Korea's attention and galvanised
efforts to make sure that Mr Hong, a 40-year-old teacher at the Foreign
Language High School, would not need the will.
Fireman Chi Jong-won said his rescue team used a car jack to help lift
the final cement block off Mr Hong.
''He was conscious, he answered our questions. But he was clearly near
exhaustion,'' Mr Chi said. ''Getting his leg out was the tricky part, we
weren't sure whether we would be able to do that.''
At 9pm, 27 hours after the tragedy began, Mr Hong was carried out on a
stretcher. He was rushed to a hospital, his eyes open and an oxygen mask
on his face. His condition was not immediately known.
Television showed his family hugging, smiling, laughing and crying.
His wife tightly held her youngest child, a 5-year-old son.
Mr Hong's was one of about 40 dramatic rescues of bloodied and
battered victims today. Work continued into a second night under a warm
summer rain as high-tech sound equipment brought in by the US military
tried to locate other survivors in the tangled debris.
Three women in their 20s were pulled out alive, including one who had
been trapped 36 hours. Several other survivors were believed still
trapped in the debris. One is a child.
There has already been too much death and heartbreak here, but with
246 people reported missing, there will be more to come.
Rescuers expect to know the grim toll from the disaster tomorrow when
they dredge through the rubble that crashed without warning on hundreds
of shoppers.
They said that scores of bodies they have already seen will push up
the toll dramatically.
Nine huge cranes lifted blocks of concrete covering the basement of
the store where many bodies are believed buried.
A rescuer said: ''The most heartbreaking moment was when we had to
withdraw because of another possible collapse, although we could hear
some survivors shouting 'help' over and over.
''When we went back later and there were no sounds.''
Seoul's Mayor Choi Byung-yul, who retired today at the end of his
term, said a police investigation so far pointed to shoddy construction
work and poor safety control as causes of the tragedy.
Rescuers said government safety teams had visited the store after a
supervisor found large cracks in pillars and buckling ceilings on the
top floor. Gas had been switched off hours before the collapse after
problems were detected.
A store worker told South Korean television an emergency meeting of
the store management was called but no action was taken to close the
building. Police said they were questioning the store chief and two of
his executives. -- AP/Reuter.

Ann Shaw reports on the kind of courage it is well worth raising funds
to support
SURGEON David Smith broke the news gently to Margaret Allan that she
had breast cancer and then asked her: ''How do you feel?''
''Shattered,'' she replied, ''but cancer is a word, not a sentence.''
With that 38-year-old Margaret, a nurse at Mearnskirk Hospital,
Glasgow, set about her fight against the disease. ''I was determined
from the start not to let it beat me.''
That was a year ago. She had an lumpectomy operation followed by
chemotherapy and radium. Twelve weeks after the operation she was back
at work and she never lost a day's work throughout the latter.
''I work part-time and the hospital were very good. They put me on
night shifts so that I could have my treatment during the day.''
Tomorrow she will be among more than 600 women taking part in the Race
for Life, a sponsored walk/run at Glasgow Green organised by the
Imperial Cancer Research Fund.
''It's my way of saying thank-you for all the help and treatment I
have received. I want to put a little back and help others, too,'' said
Margaret.
She found herself emotionally overwhelmed by the response from friends
and acquaintances last year after cancer was diagnosed: ''I received 146
cards, some from people I hardly knew. It helped enormously to know that
people cared.''
As a nurse Margaret suddenly found herself cast in the role of
patient: ''I can only speak highly of the wonderful treatment I received
in all three hospitals, the Victoria Infirmary for the operation under
David Smith, the Western Infirmary for chemotherapy and Belvedere for
radium.''
So far she has raised more than #400 in sponsorship for cancer
research, a figure which she hopes will be substantially higher because
her husband Stuart's golf club, Whitecraigs, along with Celtic FC and a
Glasgow business, Calder Millerfield, have all got sponsorship forms.
She has enormous determination. The other day she met a friend whom
she hadn't seen for a while who inquired about her health. She replied
nonchalantly: ''Fine, apart from having had a wee bit of cancer, some
chemo and radium treatment.'' It's that spunky determination that keeps
her going and will do so when she joins over 600 women for the Race for
Life through Glasgow Green.
* Entries can be accepted as late as an hour before the race. It
starts at 2pm.

It is not only a national symbol, but an important ingredient of
Scotland's wild lands. Yet, as Peter Evans reports, the heatther is
being over-enthusiastically burned, overgrazed and afforested. Is it too
late to save the purple.
BONNIE blooming heather, carpeting the hillside, stretching as far as
the eye can see. Celebrated in song and verse, it's a sight to gladden
the heart of the tourist and native Scot alike: as essential a part of
Scotland's image as the deer and the golden eagle -- both creatures that
depend on it for their survival.
Trouble is, the carpet is getting a little ragged round the edges
these days, and in some places it's worn so thin it's disappeared
altogether. The problem here is not the constant trampling of feet,
whose effect is relatively minor. Overgrazing and blanket afforestation
are the major culprits, together with too-rigorous burning and insect
infestation.
Although not as acute as in England and Wales, where it is much worse,
the vanishing heather syndrome does afflict Scotland. It is at its worst
south of the Highland fault line, which roughly divides the mountainous
north from the lower ground of the Central Belt, Fife, and the Borders,
but there is also evidence of it in the north and islands.
Dr Des Thompson and his colleague Angus MacDonald, of the Research and
Advisory Services Directorate of Scottish Natural Heritage, are well
acquainted with parts of Scotland where the purple carpet has gone,
leaving bare ground on which it can never regenerate.
The effects can be dramatic, and obvious once you start to look for
them. Along fence lines, for instance, the heather can be vigorous on
one side and completely absent on the other, because different land
management practices have been employed; and in some of Scotland's vast
glens, their shape scoured by the action of glacial ice, heather can
clearly be seen to have retreated up the hillsides.
''There are areas where heather loss is quite horrific,'' says
Thompson. A study he and MacDonald conducted, together with other
specialists in England, reveals that Scotland lost 18% of its
heather-dominated moorland between the 1940s and 1970s, with losses as
high as 67% in some regions.
So what? the cynics might say. Does it really matter? The answer, not
only from an environmental and conservation point of view, but also from
a cultural perspective, has to be a resounding ''Yes!''
To start with, Britain's upland heather moorland is internationally
significant, and Scotland, points out Thompson, is ''one of its last
bastions''. It supports unique plant communities and invertebrates.
Forty species of birds depend on it -- like the ubiquitous red grouse,
with its familiar ''go back, go back'' call; raptors such as the merlin,
hen harrier, and golden eagle and others such as the golden plover and
the lapwing -- better known to Scots as the peewit, or peesie in the
north-east.
There's its importance to the maintenance of sporting estates, with
grouse and deer feeding off it. From an agricultural point of view, ling
heather -- Calluna vulgaris to the experts -- is the principal winter
food for sheep and is a source of trace elements such as cobalt and
copper, necessary in their diet. Without heather, farmers have to buy in
winter fodder. As Angus MacDonald puts it: ''Heather is not brilliant
forage, but it's free.'' Ironically, however, sheep are also great
destroyers of heather if their numbers are concentrated enough.
Last but not least is the perception people have of rolling heather
moorland in full bloom -- especially those who live in rural areas. It's
part of their heritage; as integral to their lives as the first
snowdrops of spring, waving fields of wheat, the changing colours of
autumn or the garden winter robin. ''It contributes to our sense of
place,'' is how Angus MacDonald neatly encapsulates it.
The thing about its disappearance from the landscape is that it does
not go alone. With it goes an entire ecosystem. All the insects go;
animals such as mountain hare go; the red grouse, which is totally
dependent on heather, goes; the raptors and other birds go. Where do
they go? They don't just move on somewhere else; they die off, research
reveals.
''What you are left with is a bare, barren landscape with very little
cover,'' says MacDonald.
Fortunately, the picture is not all doom and gloom. Thompson and
MacDonald's work at Scottish Natural Heritage is a key element in
getting across the message that heather moorland is worth saving.
They want sheep grazing to be controlled so that numbers are not
highly concentrated, allowing the heather to regenerate naturally. It
can withstand some of its annual growth being removed, but as more and
more of that is taken away, the plants die.
Heather has been traditionally burnt to promote regeneration, but if
it has already been weakened by overgrazing, burning causes further
destruction. ''Just because a little of something is good, it doesn't
mean that a lot of it is going to be even better,'' says MacDonald,
while Thompson believes that burning may not be needed at all in some
parts of the Western Isles.
If the heather has been weakened, excessive burning delivers the coup
de grace. In a weakened state, it's also prone to damage by insect
infestation -- the heather beetle and moths such as the winter moth
being the culprits. Fungal attack, severe frosts, and strong winds also
take their toll.
On the protection front, a number of Special Areas of Conservation
have recently been identified under the European Commission's Habitats
Directive. There are more than 100 in Scotland, at least 15 of them
moorland areas. ''It's adding weight, as far as SNH is concerned, to the
importance of heather moorland, to do something to protect these areas
and try and reduce losses,'' says Thompson.
It is within designated areas of conservation, where farmers and
landowners are paid to operate favourable management practices, that the
best chances of successful regeneration and maintenance of existing
heather cover are likely.
Environmentally Sensitive Areas are one example, with the Southern
Uplands a principal target area for heather moorland restoration. In
addition, the Department of Agriculture at the Scottish Office has
announced a new Moorlands Scheme, applying to moorlands outside ESAs,
offering farmers who participate a payment for each sheep removed in
order to reduce grazing levels.
Scottish Natural Heritage also enters into management agreements to
try to encourage environmentally sensitive farming. ''The uptake seems
to be good for these schemes, but it's early days yet before we can say
there's better heather protection,'' says Thompson.
''We are looking for a broader recognition of the problem that we are
losing heather moorland. We in SNH, in conjunction with the Scottish
Office, have a lot of work to do here.''
Asked for his vision of the ideal way foward, MacDonald said: ''I
would like to see no more loss of heather moorland, so that we at least
maintain the status quo.'' Beyond that, both he and Thompson would like
to see a more mixed type of moorland habitat developed, with some areas
of shrub and native tree growth, sustaining a variety of wildlife.
Their enthusiasm for the ideal, and their energy in promoting it is
boundless. The crunch comes in persuading those who make a living off
the land that it is the right way forward -- not only for sustaining the
ecology of our uplands, but also to maintain Scotland's distinctive
cultural heritage.

Sarajevo, Friday
RELATIONS between Bosnia and the United Nations sank to a nadir today
when the government said it wanted to have nothing more to do with the
chief UN Balkan envoy.
The UN also said that the aid airlift to Sarajevo may have to stop
permanently because of intensified Serb gunfire. Loss of the air bridge
would be a body blow to the Bosnian capital's besieged population of
380,000 who rely on the UN relief mission for survival.
''If this stalemate continues we feel we will not see another airlift
plane going into the city for a long time, if ever,'' a spokesman for
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said in Geneva.
The Bosnian government's anger with the UN and its special envoy, Mr
Yasushi Akashi, because of what it sees as appeasement of the Serbs,
peaked as continued shelling of the city killed four people.
Mr Hasan Muratovic, Bosnia's minister responsible for relations with
the UN, announced a break with the envoy and told a local news agency:
''We do not speak to Akashi any more. Akashi is dead for us . . . we
won't have anything more to do with him.''
Mr Akashi's headquarters in Zagreb played down the onslaught and said
he would keep lines open to all sides in the conflict.
''All sides criticise Mr Akashi for one thing or another, and that
perhaps suggests the true fact of his neutrality,'' a spokesman said.
The barely suppressed tension between the government and the UN flared
as France claimed publicly that America was escalating the war.
A senior French officer who refused to be identified complained that
Bosnian forces were receiving US weapons and training from American
reserve officers.
The official added that the US and its European allies were heading
for a serious confrontation over Bosnia because of this support.
However, the US State Department dismissed the claims as ''nonsense''.
Spokesman Nicholas Burns said: ''The allegation is nonsense. I'm not
aware of any information that would lead anybody to that particular
conclusion.''
Mr Burns told a news briefing: ''The French government has not told us
officially in public or in private anything along the lines of this
individual.'' -- Reuter.

Fashion has helped shape an image for many musical greats. Alison Kerr
reports on style and indulgence
JAZZ is a many splendoured thing. Since its first taste of widespread
popularity, its influence has filtered into every other art form. From
literature to cinema; from art to dance, what they have all sought to
capture is the oft-elusive stylishness of the music. Fashion has been no
exception.
Jazz, from its earliest years as a distinct genre, has prompted trends
in fashion, occasionally as revolutionary and influential as the changes
in the nature of the ever-evolving music itself. To say, however, that
jazz musicians appear to have an innate sense of style would not only be
a sweeping generalisation, in many instances it would also be a
downright lie. Only colour blindness would excuse the musically
hyper-smart Humphrey Lyttelton for dressing like an old Glasgow
corporation bus.
A browse through any of the vast numbers of jazz picture books,
however, reveals that many of the most significant, individual and
copied players in the jazz world double among the most signficant, most
individual and most copied dressers of their eras.
In some cases, the look was artificial and cultivated. Pianist and
bandleader Ferdinand La Menthe ''Jelly Roll'' Morton was one of the
first truly great jazz musicians. An educated and culturally literate
New Orleans creole, he had aspirations to be taken seriously beyond the
boundaries of the barrelhouse.
He effectively wrote his own legend, nicknaming himself -- not
inaccurately -- the ''Father of Jazz''. The visual image he tried to
cultivate was no more modest. His accessories, from his tie pin to his
sock supporters, were of solid gold and studded with diamonds. He even
wore a huge half-carat diamond in one of his front teeth.
Morton was interviewed extensively about his early, itinerant, years
in jazz (the 1910s) for the Library of Congress archives in 1938, and
the importance of his wardrobe was clearly something he wanted to
stress.
He said: ''I would land in some little town, get a room, slick up and
walk down the street in my conservative stripe. The gals would all
notice a new sport was in town, but I wouldn't so much as nod at
anybody. Two hours later I'd stroll back to my place, change into a nice
tweed and stroll down the same way.
''The gals would begin to talk. About four in the afternoon, I'd come
by the same way in an altogether different outfit and some babe would
say: 'Lawd mister, how many suits you got anyway?'. I'd tell her:
'several, darlin', several'. 'Well, do you change like that every day?'.
'Listen baby, I can change like this every day for a month and never get
my regular wardrobe half used up. I'm the suit man from suit land.'''
Another suit lover, but one who wore his with considerably more style,
was jazz's greatest-ever ambassador, Louis Armstrong. He clearly
influenced his colleagues beyond the musical. By the early 1930s, the
Satchmo look (as described by Albert Murray in his book, Stomping the
Blues) -- ''a crisply ironed shirt with low-riding widespread collar
worn with a smartly tailored three piece suit and tie with a large
Windsor-type knot'' -- was all the rage on the jazz band stand.
Two decades later, Miles Davis -- the most original trumpeter of his
day -- was as much of a musical and fashion pace-setter as Armstrong had
been. In 1959, the year in which Davis was voted one of the best dressed
men in America, a press statement for the Randall Island Jazz Festival
announced: ''Miles Davis, the world's most famous trumpet virtuoso, will
be a resplendent sight at the Brooklyn Paramount. He will wear an
especially designed jazz suit made in Italy of special light weight
material, as soft as cashmere, but as strong as some of the notes Miles
plays. He will display a cutaway jacket, with new 6in-wide trousers''.
Another naturally natty dresser was the legendary tenor saxophonist
Lester Young. Young was a unique figure in jazz: his haunted, wounded
sound graced recordings from the 1930s until his death in 1959, and his
elegant playing earned him the nickname ''President'' or ''Prez''.
His appearance was no less sophisticated. What distinguished Young in
terms of attire from the rest of the jazz crowd was his choice of
headgear: he always wore a black, very low, flat-topped porkpie hat. And
that hat came to stand for the man himself: photographer Herman
Leonard's best-selling poster -- an evocative, black and white study
comprising Young's iconic hat hanging on his open saxophone case; a Coke
bottle on which is balanced his smouldering cigarette and his sheet
music (for All of Me) -- is effectively a portrait from which everything
has been removed except the essence of the subject.
Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie favoured the beret, and introduced it into
the bebop fashion repertoire. Gillespie extolled the practicalities of
his trademark cap thus: ''I could stuff it into my pocket and keep
moving. I used to lose my hat a lot. I liked to wear a hat like most
guys then, and the hats I kept losing cost $5 apiece. At a few recording
sessions when I couldn't lay my hands on a mute, I covered the bell of
the trumpet with the beret. Since I'd been designated their leader, cats
just picked up on the style.''
By the mid-1950s, hats were no longer obligatory. With the development
of the West Coast jazz sound, young white jazz musicians were coming to
the fore; rivalling their New York counterparts in the hipness stakes.
Head of the cool school was the much-photographed duo of trumpeter Chet
Baker (known as the ''James Dean of jazz'') and baritone saxophonist
Gerry Mulligan. Mulligan not only revolutionised the traditional format
of chamber jazz (by introducing the pianoless quartet), he also had an
impact on men's hair styles.
The impact would appear to have been an inadvertant one. In
retrospect, Mulligan said of his famous crop: ''It didn't start out as a
crew-cut. I often had bad luck with barbers. I used to cut my hair
myself, and it lay forward. My reason for doing that was that by the
time I was eighteen, my hairline was receding. I realised that the act
of training my hair back, which my mother had done when I was a kid, was
breaking the hairs off. I thought, to hell with it, cut all my hair off
and brushed it forward.''
With its relegation into the minority interest league, jazz these days
has less of an influence on fashion. Jazz men, with only a few possible
exceptions, aren't the big stars they once used to be. There is hope,
however, in the shape of trendy young jazz things like our model, tenor
saxophonist Tommy Smith, whose main priority in the suit search is that
the outfit is lightweight -- as cool as his music, in fact.
But for the bulk of jobbing jazzers, the main requirement of a suit is
that it won't get too crushed in its bag between one-nighters as the
jazz musician of today has -- like Jelly Roll Morton at the beginning of
the century -- to travel from town to town, and from country to country
in order to work. Maybe jazz, like fashion, is starting to operate in
cycles.
* Tommy Smith is playing as part of the Joe Locke Quartet at the
McEwan's Old Fruitmarket at 7.30pm tonight as part of the Glasgow
International Jazz Festival.

A UNION leader in the defence industry yesterday called for more
action by the Government in Scotland and attacked GEC-Marconi over job
cuts.
Mr Andy Matson, regional officer of the Manufacturing, Science, and
Finance union, which has 50,000 members in Scotland, said urgent talks
were needed with Industry Minister George Kynoch.
His comments came as defence contractors GEC-Marconi said more than
500 jobs would be secured or created in Scotland if it won a #2000m
contract to supply 91 Army helicopters. The announcement was made the
day after the Edinburgh-based company revealed details of 120 job losses
at its Silverknowes plant in the capital.
Mr Matson accused the company of timing the announcement of its bid
for the helicopter contract to ''take the sting'' out of the job
redundancies. He described it as an attempted ''semi-sweetener'' for the
workforce.
The job cuts at Silverknowes had, according to Mr Matson, surprised
both management and staff.
Mr Matson said the redundancies and defence procurement restraints
were two of the reasons Mr Kynoch had to do more to help the ailing
industry.
Mr Matson said: ''It seems to me that the job cuts at Silverknowes
were not even expected by local management.
''When we met management they could not tell us what staff at what
level would be laid off. They seemed very much in the dark and it's
unlikely we'll get many more details until next week.
''This sort of thing shows that the defence industry is in a very
precarious position at present. I will be writing to Mr Kynoch, asking
for a meeting on the current position.
''The situation at GEC Marconi in particular has to be looked at
closely. Since they took over the Ferranti plants five years ago, there
have been eight different redundancy announcements.
''At its peak, Ferranti's employed around 6500 people but now, under
GEC-Marconi, only around 3500 workers are there.''
He said it was vital that the defence industry diversified in the
light of falling orders. ''There has been a downturn in defence orders
but the Government has been putting its head in the sand on the issue
and think the market will take care of itself.
''It requires more positive action by the Government to assist the
defence companies and secure jobs. There are many areas within the
defence industry where the technology could be applied into non-military
areas.''
He added: ''There must be action taken and help is needed sooner
rather than later.''
A spokesman for GEC-Marconi denied the announcement of details of the
helicopter bid was timed to take the sting out of the redundancies.
On whether a successful bid could curb the planned redundancies, the
spokesman pointed out those workers were in a different division with
different skills.

Liz Taylor previews a sale which captures the days when men braved the
oceans and scoffed at danger.
SCOTTISH people have a strong bond with the sea and they always
respond well when objects of maritime interest turn up in auction sales.
This is probably because you do not have to research very far back into
most Scottish families to find a link with the ocean and the romantic
pull of sea-going can still stir the most urban-based blood.
This year, and this month, Leith plays host to the Tall Ships race and
to coincide with the event Phillips, the Edinburgh auction house, are
holding a special maritime sale on July 19. They have been collecting
items for this for some time and are also bringing things in from their
salerooms all over the country to make it very special.
Two lots that combine amatory romance with love of the sea are
sailors' Valentines made of seashells. Men on long voyages used to
collect interesting tropical shells, some of which they dyed and grouped
together in pretty patterns before encasing them in wooden frames to
give to sweethearts at home as love tokens. The two in Phillips' sale
are expected to sell for between #500 and #700 each.
One of the Valentines was made by the vendor's great-grandfather who
served as a carpenter aboard a four-masted sailing ship called the
Marion Woodside in the 1890s. He married the girl for whom he made his
pretty love token.
Another interesting item which must have been made as a gift because
it is too sophisticated, and too small at only two foot wide, to be used
on board ship, is a small sailor's box beautifully inlaid with exotic
woods, many of them from South America. Its estimated price is around
#400.
Sailors also made their own sea chests and painted them with flower
patterns or portraits of the ship on which they were sailing. One
example in the sale carries a portrait of a ship called the Hagar which
sailed out of Swansea in the 1880s. It should fetch around #200.
Other items in the sale include sextants, chronometers and ships'
compasses of brass and mahogany; ship models in glass cases; an
Edwardian pond yacht (which are being keenly collected at the moment),
and a steam-operated model of a tug boat which should sell for between
#1000 and #1200. There are also examples of scrimshaw, carvings on bone,
another way of sailors passing their time when at sea. One of the
scrimshaws shows views of Edinburgh, including Surgeons' Hall.
Though not strictly maritime, except in its subject, the sale also
includes a model of a sailing ship made of bone. These models are
usually referred to as ''prisoner-of-war'' ships because they were
manufactured in large numbers by French prisoners of war imprisoned in
this country during the Napoleonic Wars. They sold all sorts of
handicrafts to raise money with which to buy extra food because the
British authorities often kept them on very short commons. Because they
could not afford to buy materials, the ships were made of bones left
over from their food. Similar models were made by men at sea as well,
however, and the one in Phillips' sale is not expected to fetch such a
large sum as finer examples do because it is fairly crude.
The sale also includes a large selection of maritime pictures, several
of them ships' portraits, often done by men who sailed in them and, as a
result, often attractively naive in execution.
One such was sent for sale from the Orkneys and it is a picture of a
four-masted sailing ship, done in the 1870s by a Chinese artist called
Lai Fong, who worked in Calcutta. The portrait was taken back to the
Orkneys by the captain of the ship and retained by his family till now.
Nick Curnow, of Phillips, thinks it should sell for around #2000.
Another proud ship's master is recorded not only by a portrait of his
ship, the Samuel, but also by a selection of documents tucked into the
back of the picture. These give details of the ship's captain Richard
Wigzell, who took over the Samuel in 1861. His son, also called Richard,
served on the ship as well, starting his career as its cabin boy. Among
the documents is a reference for the elder Richard saying that the
owners had trusted him with the ship for 19 years. This little cache of
a family's history should sell for around #800.
A more exalted seafarer who also figures in the sale is a Scot from
Langholm, Admiral Sir Poulteney Malcolm, GCB, who served with Nelson in
the West Indies. Phillips are selling a half-length portrait of this
gentleman, a miniature portrait of his son, a list of his ceremonial
robes and the awards made to him, a brief manuscript account of his
service with Nelson, and a pair of vases, one of which is painted with a
view of his family holme, Burnfoot at Langholm. Phillips are selling
everything relating to Malcolm in one lot because it is a historical
archive and they expect it to fetch around #5000.
* POSTSCRIPT . . . Anyone who responds romantically to the call of the
sea should take a trip to the Scottish Maritime Museum at Irvine. There
are retained ships ranging from an old puffer, like the one sailed by
Para Handy, to a huge four-masted sailing ship called Carrick which is
currently undergoing restoration. The Carrick was a bigger ship than the
Cutty Sark, Greenwich's pride and joy, and is expected to be as big a
tourist attraction when the restoration is finished.
In the indoor museum is an exhibition given over to cruise ships in
the years before the last war and what a nostalgic display it is! It
makes you wish you could turn back time and cruise in an old-time Cunard
vessel. There could not have been a more sybaritic experience.

<HEADLINE>Hurd rounds on the dissidents</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977617159</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday attacked Tory dissidents who
had indulged in ''sniping and petty disloyalty'' against the Prime
Minister.
He warned that disunity was damaging the party's popularity and said
Labour appeared to be more disciplined than the Tories.
In a passionately loyal speech, he said that no one could better unite
and lead the party than John Major.
''He is the man who can pull this party together, rather than
preparing the conditions for it to fragment,'' he said in a speech to
Northumberland Conservatives.
''We would be doing something shabby and destructive if we failed to
give him the clear-cut support he deserves,'' added Mr Hurd, who has
announced that he is stepping down as Foreign Secretary in the next
reshuffle.
''John Major has proved himself a successful Prime Minister in the
most difficult circumstances. He has faced unprecedented sniping and
petty disloyalty from his own party.
''He has withstood a media chorus of sneering and condescension from
sour right and sour left alike. But the press millionaires do not
dictate British opinion.
''The Prime Minister's record of real achievement in the economy, in
the public services and in Europe, is solid,'' he said.
Urging the party to back Mr Major in the leadership ballot on Tuesday,
Mr Hurd said the party had ''yielded to self-indulgence'' and must now
restore its coherence.
Mr Hurd -- who has said he is stepping down as an MP at the next
General Election -- also declared that the overwhelming majority of Tory
MPs could agree with Mr Major's approach to Europe.
There was ''no tidal wave of hostility to Europe'' in the country, he
insisted.
Former Premier Sir Edward Heath predicted a ''substantial'' victory
for Mr Major and advised him to use the strength that would give him to
take action against Cabinet Ministers who were not fully behind him on
Europe.
''He must get a Cabinet which can pull together,'' he said.
Asked if Mr Major should remove any Cabinet member who was against a
single currency in principle, Sir Edward said: ''I would myself, have no
doubt about it.''
Lord Howe, the former deputy Prime Minister who played a key role in
Margaret Thatcher's downfall because he objected to her Euro-sceptic
views, yesterday echoed Sir Edward's advice to Mr Major.
He urged the Premier to take advantage of victory next Tuesday to make
sure Britain was at the heart of developments in Europe.
He said Mr Major's decision to bring forward the leadership race would
prove to be ''very sensible'' and predicted he would win decisively.
Former Chancellor Norman Lamont, a supporter of Mr Redwood, later
branded Mr Major ''Tony Blair's candidate'' and appealed to wavering
voters not to abstain.
In a sharp attack on the Prime Minister's style of government, Mr
Lamont said on BBC Radio 4: ''We need an end to drift and dithering. We
do need leadership.
''There is no doubt that John Major is Tony Blair's candidate for the
leadership of the Conservative Party because they know an alternative
would increase the chances of the Conservative Party winning the
election.''
Mr Lamont denied that Mr Redwood's campaign had ground to a halt but
admitted he still needed more votes to win.
''We are still very strongly positioned. A lot of people are making up
their minds. We need every vote we can get. We don't need abstentions.''
Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley said yesterday that she would be
prepared to serve in a Redwood Cabinet.
Her surprising admission came as she was interviewed by Meridian
Television's 7 Days programme, due to be broadcast on Sunday.
Interviewer John Stapleton asked: ''Would you work under John
Redwood?''
She replied: ''My view is the Prime Minister's view, public service is
a duty and I would work. If I was asked to serve I would do.''

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang was accused yesterday of colluding in an
orchestrated campaign to discredit the late Labour leader John Smith
over the Monklands District Council affair.
Mrs Helen Liddell, who took over from Mr Smith as the MP for Monklands
East after his death, claimed she had evidence, in the form of faxes, of
such a campaign.
Her fresh allegations against Mr Lang, who earlier this week announced
a full-scale, statutory inquiry into the Monklands issue, came during an
ill-tempered Commons debate on the conduct of local government in
Britain, which was dominated by developments in Monklands.
Angry MPs frequently tried to intervene in speeches across the chamber
as the Tories sought to brand Labour and Liberal Democrat councils as
corrupt, while the opposition MPs defended their record and made clear
that where there was corruption they were determined to root it out.
In another development last night, Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson wrote to the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, calling
for the swift processing of the allegations of criminal behaviour passed
by Professor Robert Black to the Crown Office after his Monklands
inquiry.
Mr Robertson said: ''The people of Monklands have been waiting too
long for the proper authorities to get the finger out on the serious
public concerns at allegations about their council. They have had to
wait two years to get the statutory inquiry which the Secretary of State
has deliberately gone slow on.
''If they are now to expect months of further delay before the most
serious allegations are dealt with they will be rightly angry at the way
they have been treated.''
Mrs Liddell, in her first full Commons contribution on Monklands since
Mr Lang's announcement, cited faxes she said came from Mr John Love,
whom she described as ''a failed Conservative councillor in Monklands''.
She said one was to Miss Eileen McAuley of the Airdrie and Coatbridge
Advertiser, dated February 4, 1994, and Mrs Liddell argued that it was
clear from its terms that there was an orchestrated campaign against Mr
Smith.
It stated: ''Do you know if Smith has a surgery this weekend? I intend
lobbying him on Sunday as he attends the Labour meeting in the Concert
Hall, Glasgow, but I would also have liked to attend his surgery for
confrontation.''
A second fax was sent to Jacqui Lowe, a member of staff in Scottish
Conservative Central office, seeking a copy of the relevant section of
the Local Government and Housing Act, 1989, and stating: ''Also advise
on line to be pursued. I have no wish to be sidetracked into legal
arguments.''
Mrs Liddell said: ''That suggests to me that the Secretary of State
for Scotland, who maintains a close link with the Scottish Conservative
and Unionist office, was aware of all those activities and colluded with
them.''
The source of both faxes, according to Mrs Liddell, was William Reid
and Sons, Wireworkers Ltd, Glenpark Street, Glasgow.
Mrs Liddell insisted that it was inquiries by her, other Labour MPs
and Monklands District Council itself that had prompted the Black
Report, and she furiously rejected claims of religious discrimination in
the area which, she said, had besmirched her constituents.
It had been claimed that Catholic Coatbridge had been favoured over
Protestant Airdrie, but that was an appalling charge and was totally
untrue.
A lot of work had been done to get rid of the charges of bigotry in
the area, but she felt much of that had been set aside by all the
charges levelled, unjustly, against the people of the community. ''We
are seeing a community of decent people being used as a political
football,'' she said.
''I have a suspicion that a Government as panicked as this one will
seek to continue to try to use Monklands as a means of trying to smear a
Labour Party that has been determined to act, is now acting, and will
act with all haste.''
During the debate, Mr Robertson was involved in a heated exchange with
Mr Bill Walker (Tayside North -- Con) over the delay in Mr Lang making
the announcement of the statutory inquiry.
Mr Walker's point was that Ministers believed Labour had not handed
over all the evidence they had in their possession and that Mr Lang had
acted entirely properly by waiting for the Black Report.
Mr Robertson countered that Labour had neither withheld nor suppressed
any information and that it had been within Mr Lang's power for two
years to order the form of full inquiry Labour had been calling for.
The debate was opened by Conservative Party chairman Jeremy Hanley who
combined a broad attack on the way Labour and the Liberal Democrats run
local government up and down the country with a specific attack on
Monklands.
He said Labour had had two, or perhaps even three years in which to
explain the position in Monklands, but it had failed to act.
However, closing the debate for Labour, Mr Robertson made clear Labour
had taken action, both in Monklands and elsewhere. He insisted: ''Where
there is wrong-doing we condemn it, where there is suspicion we demand
investigation. We are the ones who have taken action,'' he added.
The debate ended without a vote.
Meanwhile, the Scottish legal adviser to the Order of the Knights of
St Columba (KSC), Mr Peter McCann, said last night that his clients
would be happy to give the Scottish Secretary any information he wished
about the order in pursuit of his inquiry into allegations of corruption
and nepotism by members of Monklands District Council.

THE United Nations is considering setting up its own compensation
scheme for peacekeeping troops killed or injured in the line of duty
worldwide because major insurance firms refuse to give them cover.
By last month, outstanding claims by wounded ''Blue Helmets'' or their
dependants totalled more than #10m. More than 170 peacekeepers have died
in Bosnia and Croatia alone since 1992.
UN secretary general Boutros Boutros-Ghali has now submitted a
recommendation to the organisation's General Assembly, urging it to
provide a standard life insurance of around #35,000 for every soldier
serving under UN command. The General Assembly is expected to give its
verdict in the next month.
Until now, any compensation paid has varied widely. Payments wrung
from insurance companies, which now reject all claims because UN
missions have become too risky to be a sound proposition, were formerly
based on the national standards of each individual country contributing
forces to UN command.
The dependants of a Bangladeshi soldier killed in action might receive
as little as #13,000, while the widow and children of a US peacekeeper
could expect up to #55,000.
Under the new proposals, the loss of an arm would entitle the victim
to 60% of the going rate, the loss of a hand 54%, the loss of an eye
24%, and the loss of hearing 35% on a sliding scale.
Mr Boutros-Ghali's scheme would initially cover only military
personnel serving in the direct peacekeeping role but he is understood
to have requested that it be extended to include police and
international observers.

CARDS on the table. Like everyone else who eats out, restaurant
reviewers have their hopes and idiosyncrasies and what are mine may not
be yours. They also have their obsessions, which may be anything from
wine waiters who keep your bottle out of reach to the wretched cup of
coffee that ruins a meal. Here -- to launch the latest authorship of
this Herald column -- are a few of mine:
ACOUSTICS. Restaurant noise is exhausting, and diminishes the quality
of a meal. A busy Pierre Victoire, with bare floors and loud laughter,
may be a symbol of good food at knock-down prices, but don't imagine you
can sustain a serious conversation.
BRASSERIE. A type of French restaurant the British now try to copy and
usually get wrong. Brasseries are where you should expect to be served
oysters and offal, with Alsace wine or beer, at times when other
restaurants are often shut. British brasseries seldom fulfil these
expectations.
BREAD. British restaurants tend to remove this from your table at the
end of the first course. Insist on retaining it and, indeed, ask for
more. Bread is as essential to a main course as it is to a starter.
BUTTER. On the whole, not necessary, especially if it is salted
British. If served at all, it should be unsalted and preferably Dutch.
CHICKEN. If pink send back.
COFFEE. The disgraceful finale to a British meal. In most restaurants,
it is an undrinkable waste of money. Even restaurants that install
Gaggia machines seem incapable of using them to produce a semblance of
what you are served in Italy or France.
CREDIT CARDS. Watch out for restaurants -- and there are many of them
in Scotland -- that expect you to add a percentage to your credit card
slip when service has already been charged.
FRENCH. Along with Italian one of the two cuisines that really matter.
FRESHLY SQUEEZED. Term often applied to bottled orange juice. Freshly
squeezed should mean freshly squeezed -- that is squeezed in front of
your eyes on the premises. Best drunk in an Italian caffe-bar in Italy,
where this actually does happen.
GARNISH. Euphemism for rubbish.
HOUSE WINE. A restaurant is only as serious as its house wine. Italian
restaurants in Italy understand this, and some French restaurants in
France also do, but Italian and French restaurants in Britain often
don't. Nor do the many British restaurants that habitually serve wines
with names like Boulevardier, Moulon Rouge, or Reve de Montmartre. Wise
proprietors seek wines they can be proud of and share their enthusiasm
with their customers.
LABEL. Wine should be poured with the label uncovered and facing
upwards. Few waiters in Britain seem to be taught this. Instead they are
taught to pour it with one hand behind their back, which is a
ridiculously pointless piece of regimentation.
MUSIC. In a restaurant context, something to be shunned. If it is good
music, it is distracting. If it is bad music, it is infuriating.
MUSSELS. In an Antwerp restaurant last month, I was advised by the
waiter not to order mussels because (though they were listed on the
menu) they were ''out of season''. Would a British restaurant with
mussels as a mainstay offer the same advice?
MSG. If this is no more than a Chinese flavour enhancer, why does it
make your heart pound and your eyes lose focus? What seems to be its
increasing use in Scotland has placed (for me at any rate) several
favourite Chinese restaurants off limits.
OLIVE-OIL. Italy's leading restaurant guide tells its readers the
brands of virgin olive-oil that each restaurant serves with its salads.
How many British restaurants could survive this sort of scrutiny?
PALATE CLEANSER. A pointless interlude in dinner at a country house
hotel. Leaves overwhelming taste of sorbet in your mouth for the rest of
the meal.
PARMESAN. Served in chunks, it is an excellent accompaniment to the
evening's first glass of wine. When pre-grated and served from a large
bowl, it's unlikely to be Parmesan at all -- and is death to many a
pasta. When thinly shaved and served with air-dried meat and good
olive-oil, it's a definite treat.
PEPPER GRINDER. One of the things which -- the bigger the better --
purport to make Britain's Italian restaurants seem Italian. How curious,
then, that you seldom see pepper grinders in Italy.
RESERVING A TABLE. British restaurants increasingly offer two or more
sittings, usually at 7pm and 9pm, as if they were cinemas. People should
rebel against this rigidity -- convenient for the restaurant but not for
customers -- especially when they find themselves facing a hefty bill
for a rushed meal. 8pm remains one of the best times to eat, because a
good meal, like an opera, should be an evening's entertainment.
RISOTTO. This should have the consistency of a thick soup. Scotland's
Italian restaurants seldom get it right.
SMOKED CHEESE. A contradiction in terms.
SMOKED HADDOCK MOUSSE. Grossly overrated Scottish starter.
SMOKING. Something no serious restaurant can tolerate.
STARTERS. Often better than, and more inviting than, main dishes.
Thoughtful restaurants allow you to feast on starters. This, if you play
fair and order two or three, is an excellent idea.
TASTE OF SCOTLAND. A piece of culinary bragging that should arouse the
suspicion of any serious eater. Good Scottish ingredients, properly
treated, should speak for themselves.
VEAL. Essential feature of French and Italian cuisine, and inspiration
of numerous great dishes. Unlikely to be ousted by British interference.
VEGETABLES. Side dishes of as many as half a dozen drearily
incompatible vegetables have become a British disease. Different
vegetables suit different dishes, and should be served singly. A good
restaurant serves just one vegetable per person, in high profile,
depending on your choice of main course.
EXPRESSO. If thus misspelt on the menu, you can be sure it will be
particularly nasty. If you are asked if you would like a large or
''double'' espresso -- an entirely British phenomenon, by the way -- the
chances are it will be even worse. Italians in Italy don't speak of
espresso, any more than they write expresso. They call it, simply,
caffe, and it will be less than half the size of the smallest British
espresso you have ever seen. You drink it in one gulp, or a few quick
sips, and that is the idyllic point of its existence.

A MAN left his hospital bed yesterday to attend the funeral service of
his young wife who died in a coach crash in Turkey two weeks ago.
Mrs Mhairi Telford, 23, was killed while she was travelling with her
husband Shaun, 24, at the start of their holiday. A lorry ploughed into
their bus as it was taking them from Dalman Airport.
Mr Telford suffered two broken legs and a broken collar bone in the
crash and was trapped in the wreckage beside his wife's body for over
two hours.
Two other Scots were killed in the crash which injured 39 passengers.
Mr Telford flew back to Scotland a few days after the tragedy.
Yesterday Mr Telford, a bank teller, left hospital in a wheelchair to
attend the funeral service for his wife at the church in which they were
married just over a year ago.
More than 250 mourners packed into Broughty Ferry East Church, Dundee,
to hear Mrs Telford, manageress of her family's wallpaper shop,
described as the ''sunshine girl''.
The Rev Alan MacKay, who officiated at the couple's wedding in May
last year, said: ''It is fitting that at the end Shaun and Mhairi were
together, because they were always a close couple and devoted to one
another.''
He added: ''Their love was a strong love, and a love which they always
shared with their family and their friends. Our lives were touched by
their love for one another and we thank them for that.''
Mrs Telford was the youngest of six daughters of James and Jane
Strachan of Broughty Ferry.
Mr MacKay read mourners a passage from a letter her family had written
shortly after her death.
It said: ''Your death has left a void in our hearts and lives that
no-one else will be able to fill.''
Unchained Melody was played on the church organ as mourners left for a
burial service at nearby Barnhill Cemetery.

<HEADLINE>Weapons issue delaying talks. Mayhew calls on Sinn Fein to scrap arms</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977617164</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MOVES to include Sinn Fein in talks on the future of Ulster cannot
begin unless there is progress on decommissioning terrorist weapons,
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said yesterday.
At the end of a joint UK-Irish meeting in London, he said that his
meeting with the Irish Republic's Deputy Premier Dick Spring had been
''very workmanlike, comprehensive, and friendly''.
However, on the future of the peace process, Sir Patrick warned:
''Sinn Fein do have a democratic mandate but there does have to be a
start made on decommissioning of arms and that is very well understood
by the Irish Government.''
Officials from both sides will begin exploratory talks next week on
decommissioning -- a move announced on Tuesday by Mr Major and his Irish
counterpart John Bruton during the EU Summit in Cannes.
Sir Patrick said: ''Unless we do resolve this problem in the light of
the British Government's concerns, through the group of officials, then
inclusive talks we all seek won't take place . . . ''
He said that if there was a means ''by which very powerful
decommissioning could be achieved -- that is likely to be acceptable to
the British Government''.
Mr Spring earlier denied the talks had ''slowed to a snail's pace''.
He said: ''We have to recognise the progress that we have made.
''The security chiefs this morning said the peace process is secure on
the ground and we have to build on that.
''We have peace on the ground but we don't have a settlement to
underpin it.'' Such a settlement would ensure that violence would never
return, he added.
The Prime Minister, meanwhile, warned the IRA that a return to
violence would see them left isolated in the Northern Ireland community.
He also rejected Unionist suggestions that the republican terrorists
were poised to take up arms again out of frustration at the lack of
progress in the peace process.
Mr Major insisted that progress was being made towards peace. Every
day without violence carried it one step further.
''I never underestimated the difficulties but I think we have made a
seminal change and I think we will carry it forward,'' he said.
The two Governments would continue working on joint proposals to
decommission paramilitary arms on both sides of the divide. Mr Major was
clear that any return to violence would be futile.
''If the IRA ever chose to go back to violence they would find that
circumstances have changed dramatically,'' he said.
''They're not going to have the same financial backing they had from
abroad, they are not going to have the same backing as they had in the
past. They are not going to have the same backing from the people on the
streets and the Irish Government and the churches and elsewhere that
they once claimed they had. That has changed.
''What we want to do is to bring Sinn Fein into the political talks.
There should be no doubt about that, that has been our objective.
''I want to create circumstances in which all the political parties .
. . can actually be brought in to full-scale political talks to
determine for themselves how Northern Ireland will go forward.
''It was always going to be a bumpy road but I think we are making
progress down it and we will get there.''

THE very word salad these days means a wide variety of dishes either
as an accompaniment to something else, or as a dish in itself. Changed
days indeed from the salads of my youth, when salad meant just one thing
-- limp lettuce leaves, tomatoes, cucumber if you were lucky, and very
hard boiled eggs. Main-course salads are so convenient in that they
constitute an entire meal in one bowl -- or arranged on an ashet an
arranged salad can look very attractive as well as taste good.
What you put into a main-course salad depends so much on your personal
taste. Chicken salad, for example, is a dish I always associate with the
southern states of America, but there the ingredients don't vary much --
white chicken meat, chopped hard-boiled eggs, mayonnaise, and sliced
celery.
I think chicken salad can be more interesting, by adding crisply
cooked bacon, broken into bits, very fine chopped red onion if you like
(much as I dislike the taste of white onions raw, I do like small
amounts of raw red onions, with their much milder flavour), halved
half-boiled quails' eggs -- these are now more readily available and I
like to use them for their appearance as well as their creamier texture.
I also like to add tiny new potatoes to a chicken salad. This makes it
altogether more robust, and the colour can be perked up by adding finely
chopped parsley and snipped chives to the mayonnaise.
One of the best chicken salads I ever ate was in Killearn, and it was
chicken in a dressing made with olive-oil, lemon, and thyme. The chicken
in its fragrant dressing was surrounded by lightly steamed sugarsnap
peas and those long thin beans. I've often tried to make the same salad
myself and although it's been appreciated by the family, I never feel
it's quite as good as it tasted to me in its original version.
You can put so many complementary foods together in a main-course
salad -- croutons, which can be plain tiny cubes of bread fried until
golden brown, or they can be flavoured with freshly grated parmesan
cheese, or with garlic chopped finely and fried with the bread. You can
add pine kernels, which I dry-fry first to a lightly toasted colour --
it improves their taste greatly because pine kernels are no different
from other types of nuts, and they tend to go stale very quickly; by
dry-frying them you can refresh the flavour. Shavings of parmesan
cheese, or cubes of other types of cheese (feta cheese is very good in
salads) can be very useful salad items.
The classic American Chef's salad can be delicious as it can be
indifferent if the three main ingredients are of the best -- a good
roast or boiled ham sliced into strips, good quality roast or poached
chicken breast cut like the ham, and cheese.
The actual salad, the green part of the dish, is so varied these days
thanks to the wide variety of salad greenery we can buy with ease. Limp
lettuces have given way to the crisp but tasteless iceberg, which gave
way to the burst of variety that I so appreciate because of the flavour
contrasts just with the salad leaves. Kos lettuce, curly endive, my
favourite rocket (arugula), and the decorative but tougher textured red
radicchio leaves -- incidentally, radicchio is particularly good with
blue cheese of any type -- and an excellent salad can be made using
mainly radicchio with cubed or crumbled blue cheese and croutons. This
is very filling, as are all types of main course salads containing the
ingredients I've mentioned. Just because a dish is named salad doesn't
mean that it is necessarily a light meal -- they are very filling and
sustaining.
Lastly, I mention the word that tends to put off so many of us,
health. Salads are, of course, so very good for us. There are people
who, on reading those words rush for the tins of spaghetti, the toaster,
the sliced Mother's Pride, and the butter! We are divided in two groups
-- those who instantly rebel at the words ''good for us'' and the others
who never eat anything that smacks of wicked indulgence and who assume a
sort of nutritional moral high ground!
There are a few of us who fall somewhere in between the two camps. But
like it or not, most of us realise that it is indisputable that we can
dictate our state of health to a certain degree by what we eat. Eating
salads in the summer months is doing just that, and there is no need for
anyone (like Godfrey, I have to admit) assuming an air of martyrdom when
they hear that salad is for lunch or supper, because these salads are
utterly delicious, and the only danger about them is the cook actually
making enough to satisfy the demands of those eating them!
HAM, APPLE AND PECAN NUT SALAD
Serves 6
1lb roast smoked ham, trimmed of fat and sliced into strips.
1lb new potatoes, Jerseys if at all possible, steamed till just tender
then cut in half.
3oz pecan nuts, dry fried fof several minutes, then chopped; you can
substitute walnuts, but pecans are easy to buy these days and they have
a less harsh flavour than walnuts.
3 good eating apaples -- at this time of year Granny Smiths; peel the
apples and grate them, tossing the grated apples in 3-4 tablespoons
lemon juice, to help prevent discolouration.
Dressing:
[1/4] pint extra virgin olive oil shaken or blended with 2 teaspoons
grainy mustard (Isabella's grain mustard, from Aberdeenshire, is way and
above the best commercial mustard of this type).
1 teaspoon honey, [1/2] teaspoon salt, and  1 tablespoon wine vinegar.
Mix all the ingredients with the dressing. Pile in the centre of an
ashet and surround with assorted salad leaves. If you like you ca n toss
the salad leaves in olive oil,  which gives them a gloss as the flavour
of the oil, but I tend to think that there is sufficient flavour with
the dressed main part of this msalad, whose dressing is fairly sharp
because of the lemon juice in the grated apples as well as the vinegar
content.

MORE than 30 members of the newly-elected Glasgow City Council last
night gathered at the central Mosque to dedicate the unitary authority,
in the first ceremony of its kind in Scotland.
The event, which has been described as the mosquing of the council and
could become an annual fixture, follows the traditional kirking of the
council and the recently-introduced civic mass.
It was organised after a suggestion by Councillor Bashir Maan, one of
four Muslim members of the new authority, to reflect the importance of
the 25,000-strong Muslim community in Glasgow and provide non-Muslim
councillors with a better understanding of Islam.
The ceremony in the mosque's community hall began with selected
recitations from the Koran and sayings of the Holy Prophet by Qazi
Manzoor Hussain, which were translated by Councillor Maan.
This was followed by a prayer by Imam Syed Tufail H Shah and thanks to
councillors for attending from the president of the Islamic Centre,
Mohammad Tufail Shaheen.
Councillors were later able to tour the building, which was built 11
years ago and is the spiritual centre of the Muslim community in
Scotland.
The event had attracted some criticism when suggested last month,
particularly from the Rev Dr William Morris, minister of Glasgow
Cathedral, who said councillors would be very busy if every religion
represented in the city wanted to have such a service.
However, Councillor Maan said after the ceremony that he believed it
was relevant because the Muslim community was the third largest
religious group in Glasgow, and he hailed the event as a victory for
race relations.
He dismissed those who had attacked the idea and said: ''Everybody has
got his own opinion, but the criticism came only from people who do not
understand Islam. They are still living in the Middle Ages, with their
blinkered eyes, and believing all the myths and misconceptions about
Islam.''
Labour Councillor Mrs Irene Graham, who will represent Oatlands on the
new authority, said the event was an important symbol of the recognition
of the ''value and the equality'' of the Muslim community in Glasgow.
Mrs Graham hoped the event would become an annual fixture, ''to mark a
new era in local government and in race relations.''

* Caroline Hall, freelance director and artistic director of DIVA
theatre company, tells ANN DONALD what she's reading.
MOST of my reading is connected with research purposes for plays that
I'm working on so I do most of my personal reading on train journeys to
London and binge reading on holiday.
I've been reading three books all connected with a play that I'm
directing in the autumn at The Royal Lyceum Company in Edinburgh. It's
called Our Country's Good by Timberlake Wertenbaker. The first book is
by Robert Hughes and called The Fatal Shore which is really all about
the beginnings of Australia. It charts the story of all the convict
fleets who were transported from Britain to Australia in 1787 right
through to the last one in 1868. It's also incredible in the way it
describes how this terrible hell-hole of a place became a new country
and society.
The other book that I'm reading is The Playmaker by Thomas Keneally
which is based upon Wertenbaker's play. Again this is about the very
first convict fleet in 1787 to Botany Bay and focuses upon one character
in particular, a real-life character called Ralph Clark. Keneally has
fictionalised and dramatised Clark's vivid journals.
When you interweave the play, the history book and the novel then it
creates a completely fascinating network of fact and fictions which is
even more extraordinary when you consider that all these characters were
real people.
I'm a real fan of magic realist authors like Garcia Marquez and Mario
Vargas Llosa, Isabelle Allende and Angela Carter. I love the South
American writers for the sheer poetry, imagination and scale of their
novels: the epic nature and the way they chart through the generations
making extraordinary links and connections with their characters' lives.

TEACHERS must be careful how they handle children in the classroom, a
sheriff warned yesterday.
Physical contact -- especially between male teachers and girl pupils
-- could be misconstrued as sexual touching.
The warning came from Sheriff Albert Sheehan at Falkirk Sheriff Court
as he cleared a teacher of allegations involving five teenage girls in
his classroom.
The girls, aged 13 and 14, claimed that technical drawing master Mr
Joe Hamilton, 56, touched them as he marked their work.
Two said he used his hand to touch their legs. Another claimed he
moved his hands from her waist up to her chest.
The other two girls said he held their waists and shoulders.
Mr Hamilton, a teacher at the school for 15 years, denied lewd,
libidinous and indecent behaviour against the girls in December 1994 and
January 1995.
The court heard that he had an excellent, unblemished record.
After a day-long trial, Sheriff Sheehan cleared Mr Hamilton.
He said one girl admitted the touching ''could have been an
accident''. Another said: ''I didn't think he was being nasty''. A third
accuser said: ''I just thought he was being friendly.''
Sheriff Sheehan added: ''I'm satisfied there has been some degree of
physical contact. But I'm not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it
was his intention to use lewd, libidinous and indecent behaviour.''
He warned: ''Teachers should take the greatest care to avoid physical
contact -- especially between male and female -- so that there is no
room for misunderstanding.''

THE owners of a West Lothian food plant destroyed in an early morning
fire yesterday were involved in talks to protect the jobs of its 280
workers and rebuild the #15m business.
They were also discussing with other bakery and food outlets the
possibility of continuing production of their product, which is supplied
to stores throughout the UK.
Abel Eastern Foods, the country's biggest supplier of nan breads,
based at Houston Industrial Estate in Livingston, was virtually burned
to the ground.
About 60 people were evacuated when the fire broke out in an oven,
spreading rapidly up a chimney and into polystyrene insulation in the
plant walls.
The immediate difficulty facing the firm is that it has no other
premises.
Until the blaze, it had supplied most supermarket chains for the past
eight years, after being set up on 40,000 sq ft premises by Mr Wazir
Gallam and his wife Shasia.
A spokeswoman for the company said yesterday: ''The situation facing
our workforce is of immediate concern to us. It is too early to say what
will happen but they will be kept informed.''
Meanwhile, she said, the food suppliers also have been informed of the
difficulties in arranging new supplies.
Discussions also were taking place with Livingston Development
Corporation and Edinburgh Enterprise Company Ltd in the hope that new
premises may be made available.

ANGUS WILSON: A BIOGRAPHY
Margaret Drabble, Secker and Warburg, #20.
MAY in 1956 was a good month for the Wilsons of the literary world.
Colin Wilson brought out The Outsider, an existential study of eccentric
men of genius and dedicated it to Angus Wilson (no relation) who, that
month, published Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, a complex comic novel about the
nature of self-deception.
When Colin Wilson was a struggling writer spending his nights in a
sleeping-bag on Hampstead Heath, Angus Wilson was deputy superintendent
of the Reading Room at the British Museum where Colin Wilson worked
during the day. The then-unknown Wilson was greatly encouraged by the
Wilson well-known as author of The Wrong Set (1949), Such Darling Dodos
(1950), and Hemlock and After (1952).
On the basis of The Outsider and Anglo-Saxon Attitudes the two Wilsons
were oddly assessed by the literary press. Colin Wilson (born 1913),
usually photographed in a polo-neck sweater, was stuck with the label of
Angry Young Man though he was gently philosophical rather than frenzied.
Angus Wilson (1913-91), well advanced in anger, was seen as an
establishment man and, according to Nancy Spain, a ''bit of a bore''.
As Margaret Drabble discusses ''this Wilson era'' in some detail in
this Wilson biography, I would like to comment on the contrast between
the two Wilsons. I met Colin Wilson many moons ago in his Cornwall home
and he never said a bad word about Angus Wilson. I met Angus Wilson at
the Writers' Conference at the Edinburgh Festival in 1962 and he never
said a good word about anyone except Ivy Compton-Burnett. He was bitchy
in public and bitter in private -- a literary king ''playing the
outrageous queen'', to cite Drabble's description of his behaviour at a
house-warming held by Colin Wilson.
Wilson (meaning Angus only from now on) had a bit of Scottish spite in
him. His father William was a Scottish landowner and lad about town in
London before he sailed for South Africa where he married Maud Ellen
Caney in 1890 and carried on as a bit of a bounder. Wilson was born in a
house, in Bexhill-on-Sea, named Dunscore after the family estate in
Dumfriesshire and was told tales of the country of strange creatures he
saw for himself in 1929. Wilson, who became a Vice-President of the Gay
Humanists, had grim thoughts about his Scottish ancestors and when he
wrote his family saga he called the novel No Laughing Matter (1967).
The gay humanist with a marvellous sense of humour in his fiction had
to face some sad facts about his origins (his father referred to him as
a little mistake) and his identity. As a public schoolboy he was
name-called ''Nancy'' in the streets of London. As what Drabble calls a
''squeaky-voiced youth'' he was blackmailed by a butcher's boy. As an
adult he had to pay for dangerously illegal liaisons. However, he found
happiness with Tony Garrett with whom he lived and loved for almost 50
years. Wilson first met Garrett in 1945 in the British Museum, where the
novelist enjoyed so many great expectations as he dreamed of literary
fame and fortune.
Was Wilson, often compared to Dickens, a great novelist? Drabble
thinks so: ''I have long considered him one of the major novelists of
the post-war world, indeed of the century . . . He demonstrated that it
was still possible to write a great novel.'' She thinks him ''far more
worldly than Dickens'' which is difficult to believe when you compare,
say, Bleak House with No Laughing Matter. She thinks him as subtle a
stylist as Virginia Woolf which is fair comment given the persuasive
cunning of his prose on any subject.
On the subject of Wilson, Drabble's own prose is persuasive. She knew
him well enough to introduce herself as a character in the biography.
She writes that in 1976 ''Angus and Tony came to London . . . to dine
with Margaret Drabble''. One of the guests, yet another novelist,
irritated Wilson who reacted by rushing into Drabble's kitchenette and
banging his head on the refrigerator before being comforted by his
hostess. Wilson was hypersensitive to criticism and easily upset as he
explained when he apologised to ''My dear Maggie'' by blaming his
head-banging on his ''spoilt childhood''.
When Wilson, mentally confused, was installed in a nursing home in
1989 he had many visitors including one ''Maggie Drabble'' and ''Drabble
called again on another visit almost exactly a year later, on 22
November, the day of Mrs Thatcher's resignation; Drabble had not heard
the news . . . Angus had outlived the Thatcher era, which he and Tony
believed had caused so much harm''. At the memorial service for Wilson,
''Drabble gave the address''. Drabble appears in the third person to
allow the reader to concentrate on Wilson and the man in his life.
Drabble considers the relationship of Wilson with Tony Garrett a
''happy marriage'' and approvingly quotes Wilson's opinion on the need
for the world to ''accept homosexual union as on a par, socially, with
heterosexual union''. Always open about his homosexuality, Wilson was
publicly committed to a cause that seemed simply queer to many admirers
of his novels. Asked to express his views to the Scottish Homosexual
Rights Group in 1981 he declined only because he had more pressing
things to do at the time than return to his homophobic fatherland, but
he continued to campaign. After the Gay's the Word bookshop in London
was raided by Customs and Excise in 1984 he issued a strong statement on
the shameful persecution of homosexuals.
As Drabble acknowledges, her biography is ''in part a history of what
we now call gay liberation''. She demands respect for Wilson's work and
deplores the way he came to be ridiculed as a Grand Old Gay. Knighted in
1980 he was dubbed ''our latest nancy knight'' by the Daily Express,
dismissed as ''a twittering old woman'' in the Sunday Express. Drabble
impressively honours him for what he really was. A gay man who was good
enough to write some of the finest and funniest English fiction of his
century.

MOUNTED police patrolled outside a court yesterday as 34-year-old
Gavin Toye was jailed for life for what was described as a vendetta
murder.
Extra police were also drafted to Glasgow High Court after fights
broke out in the streets between rival groups the previous day.
The court heard that 27-year-old John McRae was hacked to death with a
mountaineering axe and a knife as he left the Cat and Barrel bar in
Clydebank last February 24.
Mr McRae was the latest victim in a feud between rival factions in the
area which has claimed other lives.
Charged with Toye, of Windsor Crescent, Clydebank, was James
Cunningham, 34, of Pattison Street, Dalmuir.
The jury unanimously found Toye guilty of murdering Mr McRae, of
Alexander Street, Clydebank, but found the charge against Cunningham not
proven by a majority and he was freed.
Toye was also found guilty of stabbing Mr Stuart Anderson to his
severe injury at the public house that night.
The dead man's mother, Mrs Elizabeth McRae, 48, of Jean Armour Drive,
Clydebank, told Mrs Fiona Reith, prosecuting, that there was a feud
between Toye and his friends, and two local brothers, Michael and Alan
Cochrane, who were friends of her son.
Mrs McRae, a taxi driver, claimed her son got ''locked into'' the
vendetta which started when Andrew Cochrane was murdered three or four
years ago. She also said that, a year ago, Michael Cochrane hanged
himself.

By Our Political Staff
JOHN REDWOOD yesterday told nervous Tory back benchers that they could
save their seats at the next General Election by voting for him.
As the gloves came off in the battle for the Conservative leadership,
he told MPs in marginal seats that he offered them the best chance of
staying in Parliament and said he would lift the ''electoral curse''
bedevilling Tory fortunes.
In an indirect attack on John Major, he promised to ''bring some
colour back to British Conservatism''.
However, he angered some back benchers by sending a strongly-worded
leaflet to waverers warning: ''No Change, No Chance. The Choice is
Stark. To Save Your Seat, Your Party and Your Country, Vote for John
Redwood.''
Sir Patrick Cormack, Tory MP for Staffordshire South, was furious at
the wording on the leaflet, which was sent to him at the Commons from Mr
Redwood's Westminster campaign headquarters.
''It is the most crude, simplistic, insulting and intrusive document
that a colleague could circulate to another and I believe it will be
totally counter-productive,'' Sir Patrick said.
Mr Redwood's supporters rejected Sir Patrick's claims.
One said: ''The leaflet has not gone to all Tory MPs, mostly those who
have stayed quiet about their voting intentions. We haven't sent one to
Douglas Hurd.
''But for Sir Patrick to call the leaflet 'crude and simplistic' is a
bit rich. The time has gone for pussy-footing around.''
One insider in Mr Redwood's camp said: ''The waverers ought to be
reminded there is not another chance between now and the General
Election to vote on this. So I think everything in the leaflet was
perfectly reasonable.''
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister was visiting the Medway towns in Kent --
a sign, according to his supporters, that he is confident enough of his
backing to leave the centre of action at Westminster. He told reporters:
''I think we are going to have a very handsome victory.''
Mr Major launched an attack on his critics with a blunt warning that
Tory infighting could cost the party the next General Election. He said
that he was no longer prepared to tolerate dissent.
During a break in his Kent visit, he insisted that he would fight ''on
my soapbox if I have to'' for the Tory message to be heard across the
country.
''People have been asking for a lead -- they are going to get one,''
he said.
He robustly defended Government policy on Europe and brushed aside the
continued threat from rebel back benchers if he won re-election.
''I said it quite clearly -- put up or shut up. I don't think they
will have the same resonance once they are beaten,'' he said.
''There will be no tolerance for this nonsense any longer. There is no
tolerance in my mind for this nonsense now and there will be no
tolerance in anyone's mind once this election is decided.''
He added: ''I am not prepared to sit in Downing Street, have all the
things I care about, all the things I have sought, squeezed out of the
news by the sort of arrant nonsense that has been squeezing the news out
for the last four or five years.''
Asked about his critics, he said: ''They know very well where I am
going and I invite them to follow. I think they will.
''The alternative to following, to actually going in the direction we
are going, when we have now got the best economic prospects for quarter
of a century, is to have this nonsense continue and hand over these
economic prospects to another government to wreck.''
At his news conference yesterday, Mr Redwood raised the tempo in the
battle.
He said the question which every Tory MP and constituency activist
should ask was: ''How can our party lift the electoral curse that has
descended upon us?
''Each MP will ask himself 'Who gives me the best chance of keeping my
job?' Each party worker will ask 'Do we need something new to offer on
the doorsteps?'
''My leadership will represent a change of style as well as of
substance. I am out to bring some colour back to British Conservatism --
a new dash, an excitement, a passion for what we are doing.''
He added: ''The question this weekend is simple. Do you really believe
we can win again if nothing changes?''
Mr Redwood said last night -- on the BBC2 Newsnight programme -- that
he agreed that Mr Major had made ''an enormous contribution'' to winning
the last election, but a lot of voters had turned away from the Tories
and it was desperately important to win them back.
''That's what I'm offering, a new style of politics which will bring
back waverers and doubters and get us on course for election victory,''
he said.

A GOVERNMENT Minister yesterday demanded a full inquiry into a
computer bungle which has left thousands of civil servants throughout
Scotland without their monthly salaries.
A spokesman for the Cabinet Office in London said: ''The Civil Service
Minister, Mr David Hunt, has asked for a full investigation into this
incident.''
The processing ''glitch'' at the payments section in Chessington,
Surrey, which organises the payroll of 150 Government departments, has
left staff fuming at the beginning of the annual Edinburgh trades'
holidays.
Workers due to be paid yesterday will now not be paid until Monday,
although the Government has pledged to compensate employees for bank
charges and loss of interest.
The delay, blamed on a problem with the banks' clearing system, is
estimated to have affected some 220,000 civil servants throughout
Britain.
A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ''In almost 40 years of running
payrolls, this is the first time this kind of problem has occurred.
Nevertheless, Chessington is undertaking an urgent review of procedures
to make sure it doesn't happen again.''
Emergency arrangements were made with banks across the country to
ensure cash was available for staff in need.
Mr Pat Connor, Scottish officer of the National Union of Civil and
Public Servants, said workers had been hit at a number of Government
departments, including the Forestry Commission, the Department of
National Savings, the Registers of Scotland, and a small number of
Scottish Office staff.
''Obviously, it is very much to be regretted that this type of
incident can happen. We have been trying our best to alleviate some of
the hardship which has inevitably been caused, especially at the start
of this holiday period,'' he said.
Calling for a full and detailed inquiry into the error, Mr Connor said
there had been problems with payments previously, but not on the same
scale.
For the Civil and Public Servants' Association, Mr Mike McCann claimed
Department of Employment staff had not been paid on two separate
occasions in the last 18 months because of payroll computer problems.

SCOTTISH Enterprise is bracing itself for another major organisational
shake-up, including unspecified redundancies among its 1200 staff and
pressure on the network's growing army of self-employed contractors to
join the regular payroll.
The latest fundamental review, now renamed the resources review,
started last year and is designed to achieve better value for money from
the #450m Scottish Enterprise and its 13 local enterprise companies
spend each year.
There are now 265 self-employed contractors working on programmes
throughout the SE network, in addition to the 1200 permanent and 100
temporary staff. These contractors are paid a daily rate that can be
#300 or more a day. Many work for SE or its LECs for a minimum 100 days
a year.
At #300 a day for an average 100 days a year, 265 contractors could be
earning an average #30,000 a year from their part-time contracts and
costing the network's programme budgets nearly #8m a year.
The Scottish Enterprise hierarchy appears anxious not to lose that
pool of expertise but is increasingly concerned that the growth of
contractors is regarded by the Treasury as boosting the payroll, in
costly fashion, by the back door. However, the price of putting
contractors on the payroll is likely to be significant redundancies
among existing staff.
With the Government's own five-yearly review of the enterprise system
looming next year, talks have started with the Scottish Office for
permission to move some of the money earmarked for programmes like
inward investment, technology, and business growth into funding that
covers staff costs and administration.
That would open the way to persuading some of the 265 contractors to
join the network's regular payroll.
Scottish Office permission for the switch cannot be taken for granted.
The entire Civil Service is attempting to reduce administrative costs
and Ministers may not look kindly on spending an additional #8m, say, on
SE's staffing bill.
The other major thrust of the resources review, being conducted by
SE's director of organisation development, Mr Alistair Proctor, is to
reduce spending on network administration.
The review is again examining duplication in service functions right
across the network. There now seems to be a determination to centralise
some administrative functions and loosen the staffing structure so that
more people can be flexibly deployed on programme activities.
That, a spokesman confirmed, will mean some administrative
redundancies, although he denied rumours that the job losses could reach
350. There is, he added, no firm timetable for the conclusion of the
review. Scottish Enterprise releases its annual report for 1994/95 on
Tuesday.

HIGHLAND Regional Council encountered a legal setback yesterday in its
latest attempt to safeguard the long-term future of the Fort William
sleeper service after privatisation of the railways.
Lord MacLean rejected the region's claim that consultation currently
being conducted by Mr Roger Salmon, the director of passenger rail
franchising, was a meaningless exercise.
Mr Salmon will decide on the minimum level of train services for a
particular area. Companies which win franchises must run at least those
services but are also free to run additonal services which they think
are commercially worthwhile.
He has set out draft passenger service requirement (PSR) for the
ScotRail franchise, which does not include the Fort William to London
Euston sleeper.
However, at the Court of Session yesterday, Lord MacLean said Mr
Salmon had accepted the need to safeguard socially important services
and did not seem to have closed his mind to the future of the sleeper.
In a written judgment issued yesterday, the judge said Highland's
immediate and continuing concern was the proposal to discontinue the
sleeper service.
Following a court victory by the region against British Rail, the
service has been guaranteed at least until the end of the summer
timetable on September 22.
Lord MacLean said the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) had
published figures, provided by BR, showing the financial performance of
sleeper services.
On the basis of these figures, Opraf was not proposing to include the
Fort William sleeper in its passenger service requirement for ScotRail.
It did not consider that the ''under-used'' services provided value for
money and that a continuing subsidy would not be justified.
Highland claimed the franchising director should not have published
his draft proposals for services in the region without explaining the
yardstick on which he was basing his decisions.
It argued that the lack of published criteria made it impossible to
know on what basis the region could make meaningful proposals, in an
attempt to change Mr Salmon's mind.
Lord MacLean said, however, that Mr Salmon had followed the
instructions of the Transport Secretary, by basing his initial proposals
for a minimum service level on the existing BR timetable.
It was also clear that the franchising director ''has accepted the
need to safeguard socially important services, particularly those which
could not stand alone in a commercial sense.
''He has acknowledged that every service would need to be considered
on an individual basis and in a flexible way according to the particular
circumstances of the case.
''All that indicates to me that he had not adopted a closed mind with
regard to the passenger service requirement for ScotRail in Highland
Regional Council's area.
''I do not accept that the director of passenger rail franchising has
acted irrationally by publishing the consultation document in the terms
he has.
''Nor do I accept that the consultation process upon which Highland
region are engaged is an empty exercise, because they do not know how
best to influence the franchising director's mind with regard to
passenger service requirements in their local government area.''
A disappointed Highland Regional Council convener, Mr Duncan
McPherson, said there had been widespread support and interest in the
court action. ''In many ways, we were carrying the flag for Scotland.''
He added: ''We will now be concentrating on finalising our response to
the draft PSR for the ScotRail franchise. This must be in the hands of
Opraf by July 12.
''We will be highlighting our concerns about the lack of criteria
governing the inclusion/exclusion of loss-making services in the PSR.
''We will also be arguing strongly for the West Highland sleeper to be
included, as we believe that, with proper marketing, it will not be a
burden to the company which wins the ScotRail franchise.''

A GREAT TASK OF HAPPINESS: The Life of Kathleen Scott. Louisa Young
Macmillian, #20.
KATHLEEN was born nothing special, we are told, ''one of thousands of
Victorian girls from large middle-class families. But she took hold of
her life with rare glee, and raced through it without fear and with
scarcely a backward look.''
So says Louisa Young, author of an enthralling biography based on her
grandmother's diaries which provided a rich source of ready-made
material. Kathleen Scott: sculptor, confidante of Asquith, George
Bernard Shaw, Lawrence of Arabia, Isadora Duncan, and many others,
writes so fluently that one relishes her long diary excerpts that push
this biography along at a spanking pace. Scott kept a diary for 36
years, right from 1910 when her husband, Scott of the Antarctic, left on
his fatal expedition.
I found the book a terrific read. Kathleen Scott was extraordinary,
eccentric, and energetic. She knew everyone, went everywhere, and her
lively narrative overflows with atmosphere, anecdotes, historical
detail, and gossip about a wide sweep of personalities from Picasso to
Baldwin. She loved ''vagabonding'', and travelled at the drop of a hat,
setting off for Peru on a whim with barely two hours' notice. In later
life, through her second husband, she became involved in politics in her
own inimitable way. When she wanted to influence things she simply
talked to the Prime Minister.
All Kathleen Scott's geese were swans. She determined to be happy --
and she succeeded. Her exploits, adventures, and resolve leave one
admiring and envious. Despite being orphaned young and losing her
beloved Scott soon after they married, ''suffering was never her idea of
a good time''.
In fact Kathleen's family were not as ordinary as Young makes out. One
of 11 children of a dynamic, well-connected family descended from Robert
the Bruce's brother and the grand Postelniks of Wallachia, from day one
she moved in elevated circles. Not many Victorian girls remember eating
chicken sandwiches out of their coronet at the coronation of George VI!
But mainly, perhaps due to her upbringing where there was no-one to look
after her -- but no-one to tell her what to do -- she became a
thoroughly independent woman ahead of her time.
Much of her mischievous youth was spent with her siblings in Edinburgh
at Inverleith Row with her great uncle William Skene, Historiographer
Royal for Scotland. An ''indomitable little figure with an attractive
exuberant temperament'', she attended St George's. When Skene died the
proceeds were divided between his 54 nephews and nieces. Kathleen's
allowance was #72 a year.
With this she set off for London, then Paris. By 1900 she was at the
Slade studying under Tonks, but on a visit to the Royal Academy she
found a quote from Walt Whitman. ''It is not enough to have this globe
or a certain time. I will have thousands of globes and all time.'' This
became her credo. The immediate globes she pursued were art, music,
theatre, philosophy, and people; later the war in Macedonia, flying, and
politics.
In 1901 she visited the Glasgow Exhibition which included Rodin's
''marvellous'' Burghers of Calais; then on to Paris sculpting at the
Academie Colarossi, a girl in a man's world. ''It was all so exciting,
so stimulating and so sunshiny.'' There she made friends with Rodin.
''He drew, never taking his eyes off the model, never looking at his
paper.'' He also introduced her to Isadora Duncan.
Rodin called her his ''little Greek fragment of a masterpiece''. In
fact she was attractive rather than pretty: ''Athletic, not tall, with
strong shoulders, large hands and strong features, a poor dress sense
but overflowing with joie de vivre.'' Isadora described her as ''a
magnetic person, filled with life, health, and courage''. As she could
stand on her own feet many interpreted her strong spirit as masculine --
but she loved men and her most powerful instinct was maternal.
Her search for an ideal father for a child took until she was 30. Her
admirers were legion (and included photographer Edward Steichen, Max
Beerbohm, and Nansen the explorer), ''an enchanting crowd, but I kept my
goal, my star, firmly fixed. None of these were the perfect father for
my son.'' Then she met Scott, a ''healthy, decent, honest, rock-like
naval officer''. Their son, Peter Scott, the wildfowl conservationalist,
was her pride and joy. She waited years before re-marrying: a Tory MP,
later cabinet minister Lord Kennet, who ''gave Peter a father and a good
one''. At 44 she had her second son, all the while enjoying a hectic
social whirl of dining, dancing, theatre, and entertaining.
Kathleen Scott was a traditional sculptor who excelled in war
memorials, mothers and children, naked youths, and commissioned
portraits of people she knew: Lord Delamere, Lawrence of Arabia, Shaw,
Lloyd George, (now in the Imperial War Museum), the King, Queen Mary,
Bishop of Liverpool, Lord Reith. Her bronze of Jimmy Maxton, now in
Glasgow Museums, featured on her first TV programme in 1937. She sold
her first sculpture for #18 in 1909. Lavery admired her work; so too
Scott. ''Such truth and vigour; you must go on,'' he wrote.
She did -- but modernism, abstraction, cubism passed her by. She
remained steadfastly traditional. ''I work like a fury till dark. God
how I love big work. I push the great eight foot thing into the garden
and back like a juggernaut. The weather is glorious and I am so happy. I
shall have a turnover of #2700 this year (1926).'' Between 1920-49 she
showed every year at the Royal Academy; sometimes also at the Paris
Salon.
Wife, mother, genius? Perhaps not. Remember this is her grandaughter's
version and Kathleen's sharp tongue, impatience, and snobbery are passed
over. In the end one also becomes a bit impatient with Kathleen, Lady
Kennet, the first superwoman, determined to be ''the happiest woman who
ever lived''. This is not a profound book -- but then that's the last
thing Kathleen Scott would have wanted.

A number of Scottish and
English companies are showing an interest in carrying out the onshore
disposal of Shell's Brent Spar installation.
Although it will be several months before the oil company makes a
final decision on where and how the work will be carried out, the
companies realise that if they are to succeed in what is likely to be an
internationally competitive market, preliminary work must start now.
''With abandonment of offshore installations becoming a growing market
in both the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea in the coming
years, getting in on the ground floor will be important for the
companies concerned,'' said an oil industry analyst yesterday.
''There is no reason why the work could not be carried out in Scotland
and the fabrication yards, which built these structures, are not the
only companies that could be in the running.
''Most of the platforms in the UK sector are built of steel and should
not pose any particular problems when they come to be abandoned but the
small number of concrete structures, which, like Brent Spar, have been
used to store oil, will be more difficult to deal with. Experience with
Brent Spar would stand companies in good stead for winning future
contracts.''
One Scottish company known to be taking an interest in the project is
Integrated Facilities Disposal Services, part of RM Supplies,
Inverkeithing, which has extensive experience of ship-breaking and
associated work.
It believes that if one of the major problems -- toppling the Brent
Spar on to its side on a barge -- can be overcome, then its facilities
would be ideal.
''The installation would have to be cleaned out first before we began
dismantling it but there are companies, which could be called in, which
have experience of this kind of work,'' said a company spokesman.
Another British company, Erith Contractors, of Kent, involved in
decommissioning the drilling rig West Venture in the sheltered waters of
the Cromarty Firth, is also keen to get involved in the work.
The company says it has been approached by an American firm, which
wants it to co-operate in preparing a multi-million pound joint bid.
Mr Neil Holdsworth, the company's contracts director, said: ''I see no
reason why the installation cannot be safely decommissioned. From the
quantity of contaminants I have heard quoted, I do not see any
insurmountable problems in its disposal.''
He admitted that the Brent Spar would present some challenges that
their work with the West Venture did not. The rig had been built to find
oil and had been reasonably clean.

JOHN Redwood apparently has played into Labour hands with his pledge
to cut the powers of quangos in Scotland and deliver up their
responsibilities to local authorities.
Labour politicians across Scotland -- with 21 out of 29 of the new
authorities controlled by the party -- were gleeful at the prospect of
who they see as Tory placemen being ousted in favour of local
councillors.
Mr Redwood's apparent vote of confidence in Labour's recently
tarnished local government record came in an interview.
His pledge of local power was made in a strong statement apparently
designed to scuttle any hopes of a Scottish parliament along the lines
proposed by Labour.
He warned that a Scottish parliament would mean more politicians and
more bureaucracy: an ''expensive nuisance''.
Instead, John Major's rival repeatedly emphasised his belief in local
government. He said the Government was setting up a good new system of
elected local authorities throughout Scotland.
''We want them to be more powerful and give them a role in some of the
areas quangos are currently doing.
''When it comes to the decisions that matter most to Scottish people
-- the choice of schools, style of housing, economic development issues
-- these are the areas where the democracy should be supplied at local
level through the new unitary authorities.
''I think there is a bigger role for the elected national Government
and the elected local government to play.''
For Labour, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson described Mr
Redwood's statement as inconsistent and astonishing.
''I find it astonishing on a day when Jeremy Hanley in London was
making a concerted effort to rubbish the record of Labour in local
government across the UK that John Redwood should want to devolve more
power to Labour local authorities.
''The inconsistency here is stark and glaring.''
A spokesman for Mr Redwood said that the leadership challenger would
be aware of Labour's local government dominance in Scotland.
Meanwhile, Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Conservative Party in
Scotland, warned that the party was staring into the abyss -- and he
delivered a stinging rebuke to those who sought to oust the Prime
Minister.
Speaking to Conservatives in Ayr, he warned that the dissidents were
sitting in the ''Last Chance Saloon'' and it was time to repay the debts
owed to the man who had delivered power in 1992.
''A small but undisciplined section of the parliamentary party has led
the Conservative Party to the edge of the precipice,'' he said.
''John Major steered us to a famous victory in the 1992 General
Election. Others had written us off and given him up for dead, but not
him.
''The people of the UK recognise the strengths of the Prime Minister,
his humanity, decency, integrity and his overwhelming desire to do what
is right for this country.
''He is the people's choice and must also be the parliamentary choice.
''But for his perseverance and courage in 1992, those sitting on the
Government benches today might have been sitting on the Opposition
benches, if at all.
''Some of those elected on John Major's coat-tails seem to have
forgotten this vital lesson.
''Today, they are drinking in the Last Chance Saloon. Now is the time
for them to repay the huge debt owed to him. Neither they nor us must
let him down,'' he said.

<TEXT>
A WIDOW watched yesterday as her husband's ''cruel and heartless''
killers were jailed for life.
Matthew Pearce, 22, and Darren Jones, 21, were convicted of kidnapping
accountant Grant Price and then murdering him in an execution-style
killing on a desolate spit of seaside shingle.
The accountant's widow, Mrs Isobel Price, who attended each day of the
trial at Winchester Crown Court, heard Mr Justice Ian Kennedy tell them
as he passed sentence: ''The very concept of this murder horrifies all
decent people . . . How anyone could be so cruel and heartless as you,
it is impossible to understand.''
Pearce, of Chichester Road, Portsmouth, and Jones, of Grayshott Road,
Southsea, Hampshire, snatched Mr Price, 43, in his own car from a
Gosport car park while he was on a trip with his nine-year-old son
David.
After using his cashcard to get money from cash machines, they drove
him to the spit at Keyhaven.
There, bound and gagged, he was made to walk one-and-a-half miles
along the spit before, the court heard, he was told to get on his knees.
Then he was stabbed in the neck.
The accountant took 24 hours to die from a combination of hypothermia
and shock. His body was found six days later.
After seeing the killers jailed, Mrs Price said she had felt she must
attend the trial. ''I just thought I had to be there, to go through it
all. I could not cope with the idea of it going on without me being
there.''
Each of the accused blamed each other for the murder and Mrs Price
said that, although she was satisfied with the sentence, there were
still unanswered questions about what happened on the spit, to which she
would probably never know the answers.
She said her feelings towards the killers were mixed. ''At times I
hated them, at times I pitied them. To be honest, it is indifference.''
Mrs Price said David, who saw his father being driven away in the car,
was now 10 and was happy and well adjusted.
''My children seem to have accepted it, although the whole family
doesn't actually believe what happened, even now. That is one reason I
went to the trial, to make it a bit more real.''
The crime, she said, had been an appalling one which she hoped no-one
would ever copy. She regularly uses the car park from where her husband
was snatched and she said: ''It never leaves your mind it could happen
to you.''
The head of Hampshire CID, Detective Chief Superintendent Roger
Hoddinott, said: ''We run out of adjectives in describing crimes like
this. It is probably beyond anybody's comprehension.''
From the start, he said, it had been a problem to accept that anyone
could be taken at random from a car park while shopping with his son.
However, it seemed clear, he said, that both men had wanted money and
that they were obsessed by some sort of power in taking a person
prisoner.
Jones and Pearce also received consecutive sentences of 10 years for
kidnapping the accountant and five years for unlawfully wounding a
20-year-old student who was stabbed earlier in the day at a car park
five miles away.
Jones was also sentenced to five years for an armed robbery on a
building society.

PUNTERS yesterday were keen to place their money on John Major winning
the leadership election, while support for John Redwood had virtually
dried up, bookmakers said.
By lunchtime, William Hill had taken #5000 for Mr Major to lead the
Tory party into the next election at odds of 11-10 and then cut the odds
to evens.
A spokesman said one punter placed a bet of #1000 on the Prime
Minister, while others put down bets of #600, #500 and #300.
Ladbrokes had not taken any bets for leadership contender John
Redwood, but had taken #10,000 in 24 hours for Mr Major, out of a total
of #15,000 for him since his campaign began.
Graham Sharpe, of William Hill, said: ''At long last, the Major
backers have 'put up' on behalf of their leader, but they haven't 'shut
up' his opponents, who are still heavily backing other apparent
non-starters.''
Latest odds for who will lead the Conservatives into the next General
Election:
William Hill: John Major evens; Michael Heseltine 2-1; Michael
Portillo 4-1; John Redwood 8-1; Gillian Shephard 10-1; Kenneth Clarke
14-1.
Ladbrokes: Major evens; Heseltine 2-1; Portillo 4-1; Redwood 6-1;
Shephard and Clarke 16-1.
* On Thursday, it was reported that not one bet for Mr Major had been
placed at William Hill's nearest outlet to the Houses of Parliament.
However, yesterday he broke his duck at the Horseferry Road branch when
two bets totalling #15 were placed.

Geoffrey Parkhouse, Political Editor, describes moves for party
activists to help save the Premier
THE Prime Minister and Sir Marcus Fox, the Tory back benchers'
chairman, move into the final phase of their campaign this weekend to
get him overwhelmingly re-elected with a new authority over his arty. To
the dismay of the Redwood camp, Sir Marcus is involving the party
activists throughout Britain.
By Monday, Mr Major will have the result of a trawl of opinion of the
regional and constituency party organisations as to whether Mr Redwood
should replace him as party leader and Prime Minister. The result is a
foregone conclusion.
For years, the party officials and the thousands who do the
door-stepping have been demanding loyalty to Mr Major and an end to
sniping from his own back benches.
These people are angered when the parliamentary party takes it on
itself to dump a leader (like Margaret Thatcher) who has never lost an
election.
They feel the same way about Mr Major, who won the highest-ever
recorded vote for the Tories in 1992 when the pundits said he was a
goner. They will be flattered that Sir Marcus and his 1922 executive
have undertaken to canvass their opinion this weekend. At last, they are
to have a recorded say, if not an actual vote.
There is smaller chance now of individual MPs claiming that they have
consulted their constituency parties and acted accordingly (or
otherwise) in the secret ballot on Tuesday.
As the Prime Minister meets the 92 Group -- which has 100 MPs -- on
the eve of poll on Monday night, the results of the party consultation
will become known.
Mr Redwood, the former Welsh Secretary, is none too popular with
constituency chairmen and women since he ducked out of a special BBC
Panorama programme at the last minute last Monday, which 100 of them had
been taken to London from all over the country to attend to debate with
him.
He was unpopular with them to start with because he broke Cabinet
ranks to oppose Mr Major.
Mr Major and the 1922 executive -- which also has banned another
leadership contest before the next General Election and, with the
exception of Mr David Evans, has nominated Mr Major unanimously -- are
to exploit this anti-Redwood mood.
They want it reported to every Tory MP before the vote takes place on
Tuesday.
This is unprecedented, but then the whole situation is unprecedented.
As reported in The Herald yesterday, Mr Major intends to take a
victory, of whatever size, on Tuesday and use it to re-launch himself
and his party on the nation.
This is what the party activists, who have taken so many election
humiliations -- local government, European, and by-elections -- have
longed for.If he succeeds in this, his political skills will be taken
seriously again.
On the campaign trail yesterday, Mr Major was putting the finishing
touches to his message. He pledged firm leadership, but the ''arrant
nonsense'' of party in-fighting had to stop. He will claim a majority
for this view not only in the party in the country, but also the party
at the Commons.
Mr Redwood's folk were desperately trying to indicate that they have
serious support, and it is just a matter of that support not wishing to
indentify itself.
However, Mr Redwood's game is up and the giveaway is when his
henchman, Norman Lamont, declares that abstentions will not be enough to
force a second ballot in which Mr Heseltine or Mr Portillo might have
intervened. They want outright votes for Mr Redwood on Tuesday to save
him from humiliation and prevent an outright Major triumph.
When Mr Redwood said yesterday that he is offering a new ''style'' of
leadership, Mr Major countered that he is sticking with ''substance''.
When Mr Redwood boxes himself further into an anti-Europe corner, Mr
Major's quiet explanations of his policy to the Commons win accolades.
However, the key factor over the weekend will be: who is best placed
to give the Tories a chance at the next General Election? Mr Major or Mr
Redwood?
The Tory Party as a whole will stick with Mr Major and its MPs will be
found out if they deny this desire.
The chatter about second ballots is diminishing because both Mr
Heseltine and Mr Portillo are taking a longer view, beyond next week.
Mr Major asked his parliamentary party to ''put up or shut up''. Well,
Mr Redwood has put up. By Wednesday morning, Mr Major will have changed
his request to ''shut up -- or shut up''. By this he means -- to his
critics -- shut up shop altogether or you will become the dogs who lost
us the next General Election.

MIDWIVES could be paid by the number of babies they deliver, according
to a report.
As their union leaders were agreeing a deal which will mean salary
increases of around #2000, a document obtained by PA News disclosed
hospital chiefs will be told next week to consider the radical
''productivity deal''.
Health Department officials say it could replace current pay scales.
The document recommends a major overhaul in the pattern of maternity
care and pay. Among the most radical suggestions is the proposal for the
pay-as-you-deliver scheme.
The key paragraph says: ''There is also scope for developing new ways
of paying midwives through the use of per capita payments. These might
supplement or replace basic rates of pay in whole or in part over time
if found to be a viable alternative offering advantages to midwives and
their employers.''
Meanwhile, yesterday's deal removed midwives from the long-running NHS
pay dispute, and angered health unions fighting for a national 3% rise.
The decision by the Royal College of Midwives, which involves a
comprehensive regrading exercise in return for members conceding the
principle of local pay bargaining, makes it the first union to withdraw
from the dispute.
On Monday, leaders of the other health unions are due to meet NHS
managers and could order strike ballots two days later.
The RCM's 30,000 members had earlier voted to abolish their no-strike
rule but yesterday's settlement made any industrial action unnecessary,
said general secretary Julia Allison.
She described the deal as ''a victory for midwife power'' and said
midwives would happily pay the price of locally negotiated pay for the
concession agreed.
Midwives have been campaigning for recognition of extra duties imposed
on them by Government plans to give women more say in childbirth.
Ms Allison said: ''This settlement represents a long overdue
recognition of the value and commitment of midwives to modern health. We
have won our claims in the Midwives' Charter for Change, including an
end to downgrading and a commitment to strengthen midwifery management
structures.
''In the light of these concessions, I believe the move to locally
negotiated pay is a price well worth paying.''
Junior Health Minister Baroness Cumberlege welcomed the RCM's decision
and said: ''The opportunity is now there for midwives to negotiate local
pay deals with their employers which accurately reflect their local
circumstances.''
A Department of Health spokesman played down the document on new
patterns of pay: ''This is simply a suggestion, not a prescription.
''There is no pressure on employers even to consider it with their
staff.''

CLAIMS of a cash bonanza for councillors on unitary authorities have
''appalled'' Mrs Rosemary McKenna, president of the Convention of
Scottish Local Authorities.
Local government was being subjected to ''a continual barrage of
assault'' by sections of the media and by the Government in some cases,
she said.
Mrs McKenna defended the system of allowances, which will see some
senior councillors collect #24,000 a year and many more members
receiving responsibility payments in addition to basic allowances.
She told a meeting of Cosla in Glasgow that councillors worked hard
and should be properly paid for the responsibilities they had taken on
under the new system.
The sums paid after next April range from around #17,000 a year for
the leaders of smaller councils to the #24,000 a year to the leader and
the convener of the new City of Glasgow Council.
Mrs McKenna said this was hardly a cash bonanza when compared to
Ministers who had privatised industries and then joined their boards.
A Scottish Office survey about perceptions of local government carried
out last summer and published yesterday found that 80% of those
questioned expressed satisfaction with regional and district council
services. However, there was wide variation in satisfaction for
individual services.
Two thirds of respondents could name either their regional or district
councillor correctly and 57% could name both.

BLENHEIM Travel, the Glenrothes-based independent travel agency, has
gone into liquidation.
However, 14 of its 18 branches have been bought by another travel
company, Bell Travel Ltd, which is based in Bridge of Allan.
Mr Graham Ritchie of Ernst &amp; Young was appointed provisional
liquidator at a court hearing yesterday called at the request of the
shareholders of International Travel Company (Scotland) Ltd, which
traded as Blenheim Travel.
A spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) said
that Blenheim Travel was ABTA-bonded and that anyone who had booked
travel or holiday arrangements through the company would be protected.
In the case of people who had booked package holidays, their contract
would be with the tour operator, and provided it was a member of ABTA,
that holiday would also be protected.
Blenheim Travel had been operating for six years and had 75 employees.
Its four branches which have not been acquired by Bell Travel are in
Aberdeen, Auchterarder, Dundee, and Glasgow. All the employees of the 14
branches which are part of the Bell Travel deal will be kept on.
Bell Travel concluded its deal to buy the majority of Blenheim
Travel's branches on Wednesday. The acquisition makes it one of the
largest independent travel agents operating in Scotland.
With its existing nine branches -- three in the North of England, at
Kendal, Lancaster, and Darlington, and the rest in Scotland at Aberdeen,
Stonehaven, Bridge of Allan, Alloa, Dunfermline, and Stirling -- and the
addition of Blenheim Travel's branches, it now has a total of 23 in
Scotland and the north of England.
A spokeswoman for Ernst &amp; Young said that anyone concerned about
holiday arrangements made with Blenheim Travel should contact their
local Bell Travel agent or telephone ABTA on 0171-307-1952/1955/1956.
Meanwhile, the director of a tour operator company was arrested
yesterday on suspicion of fraud.
Travel administrators had to cope with hundreds of holidaymakers who
were due to fly to destinations including Rhodes, Kos, Crete, and Corfu
with a company trading under the names of Leisure Villas and Sunsplash
but had received no holiday information before handing over their money.
ABTA said it terminated the membership of the company yesterday after
being deluged with complaints.
Mr Alex Woolfall of ABTA said that all customers would be refunded
because, as members of ABTA, the tour operator was required to pay a
bond to the Civil Aviation Authority as insurance against customers not
receiving the goods they paid for.
Many of the holidays were in less well-known destinations and were
aimed at the quality market, he added.
A CAA spokesman said it would be inspecting papers and accounts on the
company's premises in Wimbledon as soon as possible.

The Bonn parliament agreed yesterday to send soldiers and fighter
planes to support UN peacekeepers in Bosnia, in what could be Germany's
first foreign combat mission since the Second World War.
The vote was a victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in his campaign to
make the reunited Germany take more responsibility in world affairs and
shed some of the embarrassed restraint that has characterised post-war
foreign policy.
Dozens of members from the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and
Greens, both of which have strong pacifist traditions, voted with the
government, which has only a 10-seat majority. In the event, 386
deputies were in favour, 258 against, and 11 abstained.
Foreign minister Klaus Kinkel told members that Germany's allies would
not understand if it continued to fight shy of sending troops. ''At
stake is the establishment of a common European foreign and security
policy, at stake is Germany's standing and credibility in the world,''
he said.
The vote was needed to ratify a cabinet decision to send 1500
soldiers, Tornado fighters, transport planes and a field hospital to
back the new UN rapid reaction force.
The Anglo-Dutch-French force, intended to defend UN troops against the
Bosnian Serbs, is keen to have the Tornados for their power to knock out
Serb anti-aircraft radar.
Germany, mindful that memories of atrocities committed by Hitler's
Nazis during their wartime occupation of Yugoslavia are still vivid, has
made it clear it will not send ground troops. However, by sending the
Tornados, Kohl could still be putting German fingers on triggers for the
first time in 50 years.
In a bitter debate, SPD leader Rudolf Scharping said his party
supported the establishment of the rapid reaction force and favoured
sending logistics and medical help. He said sending the Tornados into
battle in a country the Nazis brutalised ''can only lead to escalation
and irresponsibly endanger German soldiers''.
SPD party manager Guenter Verheugen even came close to linking Kohl's
Bavarian CSU allies with the Nazis. He caused uproar on the coalition
benches by saying the CSU were heirs to the conservative militarism of
the early part of this century.
The go-ahead for a new role in world affairs came last year when the
supreme court said the post-war constitution, drawn up in reaction to
Hitler's militarism, did not bar Bonn from joining its allies in
missions outside NATO territory.
In Belgrade, the decision was criticised as ''neither wise nor
appropriate'' by deputy Yugoslav foreign minister Zivorad Jovanovic, who
said it was tantamount to ''opening old wounds''.
The move is bound to incense Bosnian Serbs, whose leader, Radovan
Karadzic, has repeatedly warned that his forces would regard German
presence as a provocation. -- Reuter

A SPECIAL bench of five judges is to consider whether an alleged drugs
dealer can be convicted of attempting the impossible.
The Crown claims that Mr James Docherty thought he was in possession
of 20 ecstasy tablets in Ayr's notorious Hanger 13 but the tablets
turned out not to be a controlled drug at all.
Mr Docherty, 24, of Queen Mary Street, Bridgeton, Glasgow, is claiming
that he did not commit any crime known to the law of Scotland.
The charge is that on November 5, 1994, at Hanger 13 in Pavilion Road,
Ayr, he took possession of 20 tablets that he believed to contain, but
which did not in fact contain, ecstasy.
It is alleged that he intended to supply the drug to others and
attempted to have it in his possession with intent to supply.
Sheriff Charles McFarlane, QC, rejected a plea in Ayr that the charge
was irrelevant and Mr Docherty appealed.
Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General who presided at the Justiciary
Appeal Court, said yesterday: ''The ground on which the charge is said
to be irrelevant is that the offence would have been impossible to
commit in this case as the tablets did not in fact contain the
controlled drug.''
Lord Hope said that Scottish case precedents, on whether an attempt to
commit a crime that was impossible was in fact a crime, appeared to be
contradictory.
Two cases, in 1928 and 1937, concerned with attempts to procure an
abortion when the women were not said to be pregnant, suggested that
charges of attempting the impossible were irrelevant.
But in another case in 1933 it was decided that an accused was guilty
of attempting to steal when he put his hand in another man's pocket
although there was no proof there was anything in the pocket to steal.
Lord Hope noted that under the Criminal Attempts Act 1981, the English
law in a case such as Mr Docherty's would rule that an offence had been
committed even although the substance in his possession was not a
controlled drug.
He added, however: ''It seems to us that the present state of the law
of Scotland on this issue is uncertain and that it is now in need of
review by a larger court.''

As Hong Kong prepares to take its leave of Britain's dominion, George
Hume looks at how the colony came to international prominence - and the
ruthless Scots drug traders who would stop at nothing in their lust for
wealth.
TWO years on from today, bar the firecrackers, it will be over -- Hong
Kong's New Territories reclaimed by the Chinese at the end of Britain's
99-year lease, communism triumphant over capitalism, the outer
barbarians at the gate at last sent packing. Or so goes the theory,
enshrined in treaty.
The plight of economic refugees from Hong Kong notwithstanding, the
stark fact of the matter is that the clock has been ticking on Hong Kong
since Scots' ruthless pursuit of the drugs trade first forced the
Chinese to lose their hold on the treeless granite rock which they made
the pivot of vast personal wealth and untold riches for the British
Exchequer.
At the very heart of the Crown Colony's hard-driving approach to
profit and commercial flexibility is the pre-eminent Hong Kong house of
Jardine Matheson, Scottish-built 172 years ago for stop-at-nothing drug
pushing. Now a modern conglomerate, Jardine's respectability is today as
copper-bottomed as its wealth.
In the past, but well-documented, are Jardine's origins: drug
trafficking on a scale unsurpassed by today's Colombian cartels, the
fomenting of opium wars, and the creation of a virtual Scottish colony
based on defiance of Imperial Chinese opposition to the opiate trade.
Jardine Matheson's founding fathers were Scots, merchant venturers Dr
William Jardine, the dogged half of the enterprise, and James Matheson
the debonair -- Jardine from Lochmaben in Dumfriesshire, Matheson's
roots in Lairg, Sutherland -- who put their heads and their names
together in Canton in 1832 to found a company that now employs more than
220,000 people in 30 countries. Profit last year amounted to $453m, an
increase of 16% over the previous year; a growth described by chairman
Henry Keswick, descendant of an early pillar of Jardine's establishment,
as ''satisfactory''.
Canton, when Dr William Jardine arrived there in 1819 at the age of
35, was the one port in China maintaining links with the outside world,
the only Chinese city where foreigners were allowed to live. Held in
contempt by the Dragon Emperor they were described as Foreign Devils,
Outer Barbarians. Coincidentally, that very year the first receiving
ship for drugs, the British-owned brig Mentor, dropped anchor in Whampoa
and went into business.
James Matheson got to China three years ahead of his partner-to-be,
and was aged just 20 when he first set foot in the Celestial Empire. By
the time he was 40 he was a millionaire. Leaving China in 1842 he
settled in the Highlands, sat in Parliament, and was created a baronet
in 1850 . . . presumably by amassing a huge personal fortune in large
part by the illegal sale of opium, possibly because the government of
Hong Kong was already, and was to remain so until the Japanese army
invaded almost a century later, little more than a branch office of
Jardine Matheson.
Today Jardine Matheson remains omnipresent in Asia-Pacific -- source
of more than 87% of its profit -- with activity world-wide embracing
trading, banking and financial services, hotels, property, airlines,
steel, security companies, the sale of Mercedes Benz cars -- one in nine
cars in Hong Kong is a Mercedes -- optics, elevators -- they installed
the first in China -- a supermarket chain, convenience stores, and even
the ubiquitous pizza . . . a far cry from ''godowns'' stuffed with
opium, the sticky dark substance the Chinese called ''foreign mud'', 133
pounds of the drug to a chest with tens of thousands of chests smuggled
annually in armed clipper ships and sold to a growing multitude of
addicts.
Nothwithstanding that the importation and taking of opium had been
banned by the Chinese authorities as far back as 1729, Jardine Matheson,
foremost of the 30 British firms trading in and out of Canton, developed
the opium traffic with ruthless energy, their fast clippers -- ''devil
ships'', the Chinese called them -- running their cargoes up the Pearl
River to feed addiction and profits.
In the beginning the traders were able to act merely as agents in the
drug trade -- often cloaking their activities under the flag of some
other nationality for whom they would act as consul. James Matheson, for
example, became Denmark's representative in Canton. But when the
Honourable East India Company was compelled in 1834 to surrender its
monopoly on opium the really big money came within the private traders'
grasp and they went for it with ruthless determination -- moral scruple
a very poor second to profit.
The most numerous and uncompromisingly hard-edged of the drug traders
were British -- the most energetic and successful of them the Scots. The
sale of wooden goods, cottons, furs, and some manufactured items to the
Chinese and the buying from them of silks, works of art, and, above all,
tea, fell by the way and rapidly opium amounted to double the value in
trade of all legal commodities put together. A speculative, illegal
business with widely fluctuating prices became the dynamic of trade for
the British in China.
Opium had become the largest export of the Indian Empire, the biggest
single item of international commerce -- bar none. The British
Exchequer, mindful of a penny to be turned -- even out of drug
trafficking -- levied Customs duty on all opium exported from India, and
in this laissez-faire climate ship-loads of addiction were smuggled into
China, fortunes made, and the exchequer given its due.
But there were doubts . . . of a kind. Warren Hastings, first
Governor-General of India, said of opium: ''It is a pernicious article
of luxury which ought not to be permitted . . . but for the purpose of
foreign commerce only.'' Candid -- and vigorous. Under his
administration opium production was increased, exports were boosted, and
the Customs levy was imposed -- amounting at the peak of trade, thanks
in no small part to the vigour of Jardine Matheson, to not less than
one-sixth of the total annual revenue of Britain and India combined.
By 1839 China had had enough of this gangland attitude to the drug
destruction of its people and sent mandarin Lin Tse-hsu to Canton as
Imperial High Commissioner of the Court of Heaven -- his task to stamp
out the opium trade. ''Tremble and obey'' was an old Chinese dictum but
the Scots opium traders paid no attention even although they faced the
death penalty if caught.
Lin Tse-hsu wrote to the young Queen Victoria in imperious terms,
ticked her off for allowing the opium trade to flourish, and warned:
''On receipt of this letter let your reply be speedy, advising us of the
measures you propose to adopt. Do not by false embellishments evade or
procrastinate.''
In another, eloquent letter to Queen Victoria he wrote: ''Suppose
there were people from another country who carried opium for sale to
England and seduced your people in buying and smoking it; certainly you
would deeply hate it and be bitterly aroused.'' Strangely, neither
letter was delivered.
The casus belli came when Lin Tse-hsu demanded the surrender at Canton
of 20,291 chests of opium held by the merchants. The total value was set
at #2m -- then a vast sum -- and 7000 of the chests were the property of
Jardine Matheson. The merchants refused and were confined in their
quarters. There they stayed for six weeks, deprived of servants, until
they surrendered their opium stocks which were publicly destroyed.
Tipped into large trenches 150 feet long, 75 feet wide, and seven feet
deep, the ''foreign mud'' was pulverised and soaked in water, the
decomposed slurry flushed away into a stream. Five hundred workmen and
80 inspectors were required for the three-week task -- and Lin Tse-hsu
kept a very close eye on the proceedings. It was to prove a pyrrhic
victory.
The traders retreated to their heavily-armed receiving ships, quite
simply floating warehouses, to consider their response. As they
deliberated the mandarin turned the screw -- forbidding anyone to supply
the floating foreigners with either food or water.
The British Empire was outraged. Dr Jardine, having returned home a
year earlier with a reported personal fortune in excess of a million
pounds and elected to Parliament, found it a task close to his heart to
press on Prime Minister Palmerston a master-plan to humiliate the cocky
mandarin of the Celestial Empire. China was to be brought to heel.
Gun-boat diplomacy was invoked, British naval squadrons were dispatched,
forts and strongpoints reduced all along the coast from Canton to
Shanghai, islands seized, and the Chinese were forced to negotiate.
The hilly, largely uninhabited, island of Hong Kong, approximately 26
square miles in size and almost 100 miles away from prying Chinese
Imperial eyes at Canton, would serve the drug traders well. The
mile-wide strait between the island and maintland Kowloon is one of the
world's best deep-water harbours -- a perfect haven for clipper ships
and floating warehouses stuffed with the sticky brown stuff of wealth.
Thus was Hong Kong demanded and surrendered to the British on June 26,
1843. In addition trading rights and privileges for British merchants in
five ports were extracted, as was compensation for the destroyed opium.
Nothing at all was said about future opium trading and the drug business
continued to forge ahead -- British gunboats to back up the ''devil
ships'' at an approximate ratio of one to three.
Not everyone applauded the drug-barons' success over the Chinese nor
approved of the war waged by Britain against the will of the Chinese to
keep their people free from the scourge of opium. Gladstone, in
opposition, said in the House of Commons: ''A war more unjust in its
origin, a war more calculated in its progress to cover this country with
permanent disgrace I do not know and I have not read of.''
Macaulay complained that the British flag had become ''a pirate flag
to protect an infamous traffic'', while in the House of Lords Lord
Ashley called the opium trade ''utterly inconsistent with the honour of
a Christian kingdom''.
Such outrage was swept aside and opium continued to be grown in India,
to have duty levied on its export, and to be sold, against the law, to
the Chinese who continued, officially at any rate, to protest. By the
mid 1850s the opium trade into China was twice the volume of 20 years
before. A second British-Chinese war ended in 1860 with the Convention
of Peking which brought the British the southern tip of the Kowloon
peninsula, at first on a perpetual lease, later absolutely ceded.
Legalised and taxed under the treaty settlement of 1860, opium imports
reached a peak of 87,000 chests in 1879 but thereafter declined because
production of opium within China -- several times the quantity imported
-- increasingly supplied the still growing home market. By the mid 1850s
in any case tea had taken up an equal part, with opium, of the big
shippers' trade -- the opium side hidden, the tea side heavily
advertised. Clipper ships that had once run opium from India to the
Pearl River now ran tea from China to the Thames.
Growing general trade was expanding Hong Kong itself and the
eventually critical extension came in 1898 when the British extracted
two new concessions from the Chinese -- the rest of Kowloon Peninsula
and the considerable hinterland, and all the islands and rocks in the
archipelago around Hong Kong, these extensions known as the New
Territories. Hong Kong and its essential mainland toehold now amounted
to 390 square miles -- the new lands not ceded but leased, 99 years
until July 1, 1997.
Only as the 1900s ran their course and the date for quitting came into
closer focus was it widely appreciated that Hong Kong without its New
Territories, would be a non-runner. When the New Territories go, Hong
Kong of necessity goes too -- plumed hats replaced by Mao caps.
But when the deal was struck and the lease signed today's diplomatic
contortions were unimagined. Besides, a further green light had just
been given to the opium traders in a report by a Royal Commission set up
to determine if there could possibly be any substance in missionaries'
claims that the health of the Chinese was being damaged by the drug.
Could opium, after all, be pernicious?
Delivering its distilled wisdom the Royal Commission, to the surprise
of few, held that opium was harmless. It stated that: ''Looking to broad
results we are satisfied that the general use of opium, which may
properly be described as moderate, is not attended by injurious
consequences. We have no hesitation in saying that no extended physical
and moral degradation is caused by the habit.''
Carry on trading. Five years after the Royal Commission delivered its
wisdom in 1895 the Chinese marked their appreciation of trade with the
West with the Boxer Rebellion, murdering every foreigner they could
find.
By 1907, with pressure growing, it was time for a U-turn. The Royal
Commission, said Westminster, had been hopelessly wrong. Opium was
harmful after all and the trade should be stopped. Over a period of
years it was. Which left Jardine Mathesons doing other things -- and
very successfully. In the opium years -- the trade that founded the
fortune -- Jardines's had become fabulously wealthy.
The company built the first railway in China, loaned money to the
Imperial Household -- millions of silver taels diverted for the
construction of a Summer Palace instead of the purchase of a navy --
traded in guns and cotton, got into textile weaving and sugar refining,
became a magnet for all eager to get rich quick and played a big hand in
opening up Japan. A measure of the company's cutting edge is that when
its shares were first offered to the public in 1961 the issue was
over-subscribed 56 times.
Jardine's -- since 1984 -- has been incorporated in Bermuda but stays
in Hong Kong, an international power factor. But come July 1, 1997, what
then? In both Bermuda and Hong Kong the Outer Barbarians say merely
''wait and see''.

THE actor Eric Cullen, jailed for nine months for indecency involving
boys, is said to have spent a nightmare first 24 hours in Barlinnie
Prison, Glasgow.
The Scottish Prison Service is taking seriously rumours sweeping the
prison system that a ''contract'' was immediately put out by Glasgow
thugs inside the prison who want to mete out their own punishment on
Cullen.
Sources at the jail confirmed yesterday that Cullen had already run an
unrelenting gauntlet of abuse from other prisoners and that he was
distraught and terrified.
Cullen, Wee Burney in the original Rab C Nesbitt television comedy
series, is only 4ft 4in tall and obviously unable to defend himself. The
SPS confirmed that he had spent his first night in Barlinnie in one of
the suicide observation cells, where officers kept a 15-minute check on
him.
Yesterday, he was transferred to a room in the prison hospital, where
prison staff can keep an eye on him and control who comes and goes.
Cullen suffered the worst abuse when he had to walk through part of
Barlinnie to a visiting room to meet his lawyer, Mr Maurice Smyth, who
yesterday said that the earliest interim liberation hearing that could
be arranged was on Tuesday. Because Cullen's case was taken on solemn as
opposed to summary procedure, the appeal process will be at the High
Court in Edinburgh.
If his appeal against sentence fails or his sentence is reduced, his
presence inside the prison system will pose a major management headache
for the SPS. Already under scrutiny because of high suicide rates, the
SPS would be under great pressure to keep the actor safe. Since his
sentence is short -- in the event of an appeal failing he would serve 18
weeks -- it is unlikely that he would be transferred to Peterhead
Prison.
Although that jail now specialises in housing 200 sex offenders, the
purpose is so that these men can be placed on intervention programmes in
an attempt to break into their cycle of sex offending.
It may also be considered vital to Cullen's mental well-being that he
should remain in as close contact as possible with his family and
friends.

HEALTH Secretary Virginia Bottomley last night staged a damage
limitation exercise after she was reported as saying she would be happy
to serve in a Redwood Cabinet.
She issued a statement saying: ''I was making the point that I saw my
public service duty as being to serve the Prime Minister.
''I have already repeatedly made it clear that I support John Major
and I am confident that he will win.''
Earlier, Meridian TV released her comments from its 7 Days programme,
due to be broadcast on Sunday, in which interviewer John Stapleton
asked: ''Would you work under John Redwood?''
Mrs Bottomley replied: ''My view is the Prime Minister's view, public
service is a duty and I would work. If I was asked to serve, I would
do.''
Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday attacked Tory
dissidents who had indulged in ''sniping and petty disloyalty'' against
the Prime Minister.
He warned that disunity was damaging the party's popularity and said
Labour appeared to be more disciplined than the Tories.
In a passionately loyal speech, he said that no-one could better unite
and lead the party than John Major.
''He is the man who can pull this party together, rather than
preparing the conditions for it to fragment,'' he said in a speech to
Northumberland Conservatives.
''We would be doing something shabby and destructive if we failed to
give him the clear-cut support he deserves,'' added Mr Hurd, who has
announced that he is stepping down as Foreign Secretary in the next
reshuffle.
''John Major has proved himself a successful Prime Minister in the
most difficult circumstances. He has faced unprecedented sniping and
petty disloyalty from his own party.
''He has withstood a media chorus of sneering and condescension from
sour right and sour left alike. But the press millionaires do not
dictate British opinion.
''The Prime Minister's record of real achievement in the economy, in
the public services and in Europe, is solid,'' he said.
Former Premier Sir Edward Heath predicted a ''substantial'' victory
for Mr Major and advised him to use the strength that would give him to
take action against Cabinet Ministers who were not fully behind him on
Europe.
''He must get a Cabinet which can pull together,'' he said.
Asked if Mr Major should remove any Cabinet member who was against a
single currency in principle, Sir Edward said: ''I would myself, have no
doubt about it.''
Lord Howe, the former deputy Prime Minister who played a key role in
Margaret Thatcher's downfall because he objected to her Euro-sceptic
views, yesterday echoed Sir Edward's advice to Mr Major.
He urged the Premier to take advantage of victory next Tuesday to make
sure Britain was at the heart of developments in Europe.
He said Mr Major's decision to bring forward the leadership race would
prove to be ''very sensible'' and predicted he would win decisively.
Former Chancellor Norman Lamont, a supporter of Mr Redwood, later
branded Mr Major ''Tony Blair's candidate'' and appealed to wavering
voters not to abstain.
In a sharp attack on the Prime Minister's style of government, Mr
Lamont said on BBC Radio 4: ''We need an end to drift and dithering. We
do need leadership.
''There is no doubt that John Major is Tony Blair's candidate for the
leadership of the Conservative Party because they know an alternative
would increase the chances of the Conservative Party winning the
election.''
Mr Lamont denied that Mr Redwood's campaign had ground to a halt but
admitted he still needed more votes to win.
''We are still very strongly positioned. A lot of people are making up
their minds. We need every vote we can get. We don't need abstentions.''

MORE embarrassment looms this weekend for disgraced film star Hugh
Grant as he attempts a reconciliation with girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley.
The couple met yesterday for the first time since the actor was
arrested for an alleged sex offence in Los Angeles, and had an al fresco
lunch at their country home.
However, as they tried to save their nine-year relationship, a black
cloud loomed with the announcement last night by the News of the World
that it had bought the prostitute's story.
Whatever Grant, 34, tells Miss Hurley, 29, further ''revelations''
from Divine Brown -- also known as Stella Marie Thompson -- will
certainly raise further doubts in her mind.
She has already said she is ''bewildered and saddened'' and feels
''very much alone'' since vice police said Grant had been charged with
committing a sex act in public.
The couple have been besieged by photographers and reporters at their
#900,000 rented farmhouse in Littleton House, West Littleton, near Bath.
They were seen in the garden in the afternoon, sitting opposite each
other at a picnic table for about 10 minutes, before moving back inside.
One observer said: ''They looked pretty glum and didn't look at each
other much. They picked at their food and didn't stay out long.''
Early yesterday, they sent the housekeeper to buy newspapers. She
returned with all the English press -- as well as US journals.
Perhaps ominously for Grant, a new double bed was delivered to the
house yesterday. A spokesman from Bensons Bed Centre, Bristol, said Ms
Hurley ordered it within hours of hearing of Grant's arrest.
According to the spokesman, Ms Hurley said: ''I want a kingsize bed
for the spare room.''
A bouquet of flowers addressed to the Estee Lauder model was also
delivered to the house. It bore the message: ''Don't be sad. You'll
never be alone'', and was unsigned apart from a single kiss.
The News of the World declined to discuss details of its financial
settlement with the prostitute, but it is thought to have paid her
#100,000.
That was the amount on offer in ''wanted'' posters around the red
light area, as journalists searched for her.
A spokesman for the newspaper claimed Miss Brown had provided ''a full
and detailed account'' of the alleged incident.
''To save our rival newspapers further unnecessary expense in their
fruitless and frustrating search for Miss Brown, we can confirm that she
has been with journalists from the News of the World since Tuesday
morning, at a secret location.''
Meanwhile, in an interview before his arrest, Grant reveals his life
feels empty despite all its glamour.
The interview, to be published on July 18 in the August issue of a US
magazine, paints the actor as a genial person openly aware of his dark
side.
He described himself as part drifter and increasingly neurotic and
manic. He said: ''I have days . . . when you sit there and everything is
beautiful. Every paper clip is in place. But it's not very good for you
in some ways. It's a bit empty,'' he said.

STEPHEN Hendry, five times world snooker champion, displayed not an
ounce of nerves yesterday as he approached the pulpit and the state of
matrimony.
Muthill, a village near Crieff in Perthshire, is a sleepy place but
the world and its whippet had gathered in the hazy summer sun to witness
Hendry marry his long-time sweetheart, Miss Mandy Tart, in its red
sandstone parish church.
The famous mixed with unsung locals under hundreds of feet of coloured
bunting.
It was a day of summer frocks, large fruit bowl hats, Armani suits,
sneakers, and Bermuda shorts as the private family wedding became a very
public affair.
Like all good bridegrooms, Hendry arrived for the service in plenty of
time, and like any good bride, Mandy kept her man waiting 20 minutes
past the allotted time.
Hendry, dressed in a black morning coat, light grey pinstripe
trousers, cream waistcoat, and gold tie, beamed at the flashing cameras
before posing for more shots with his school friend and best man, Mr
Scott Howie, and his ushers, his brother Keith and the world No 8
snooker player and close friend, Darren Morgan.
As Hendry disappeared into the church, the attention centred
momentarily on the bride's two-and-a-half-year old niece and flower
girl, Maria, before world snooker finalist Nigel Bond signalled the
arrival of the rest of the VIPs.
A blue Mercedes with an oddly familiar KMD number plate stole into the
church grounds. A murmur went up from the gathering as the boyish grin
of the emerging driver betrayed the attendance of Scottish football star
Kenny Dalglish.
On his tail trooped Hendry's Sweater Shop team-mates of Mark Williams,
Martin Clark, Ken Doherty and co, before a gold and black Bentley
signalled that time had almost caught up.
Five bridesmaids: nieces Sarah and Amanda Lane, Mandy's sister Lisa,
schoolfriend Jane Holt and cousin Laura McAlpine, resplendent in
off-the-shoulder full length ivory silk gowns, posed for the cameras in
a brief moment of scorching sunshine.
It was 3.20pm when a silver and grey Rolls-Royce rumbled across the
dust to the church door. Mandy, wearing a midi-length silk ivory bridal
dress with half train and full veil, posed briefly with her father
before also disappearing inside to her waiting husband-to-be.
The service was brief, private, and cheery. The couple waltzed back
into the sunshine, where Mandy was greeted with a kiss from a suitably
blackened chimney sweep.
Hendry brushed away a broad smile as Mandy brushed away any remnants
of coal dust. The cameras whirred.
Dalglish was cornered by the press pack and was asked for his comment
on the groom: ''I don't think he's ever looked nervous, has he? But the
reception speeches are still to come . . ''
The puns did not bear thinking about.
The Lancashire-born bride continued smiling for the cameras. Hendry
was asked, inevitably: ''How do you feel?'' His reply was courteous and
good humoured: ''Excellent.''
Asked if he would carry the bride, he came back: ''I would if I
could.''
Another hack asked for any hints about the honeymoon. There was a
momentary pause. Hendry turned his head and stonewalled: ''We're having
one.''
The couple were ushered into another Rolls-Royce as the entourage left
for a reception at Gleneagles Hotel and that honeymoon.
It was typical Hendry, decisive, winning, smiling, but this was one
match where he had to share the honours with the other player: his new
wife.
The marriage service was conducted by the Rev Elinor Gordon. The order
of service included Wagner and Mendelssohn, and the hymns Praise My Soul
the King of Heaven, All Things Bright and Beautiful, and Love Divine.

A CONFIDENT Mr John Major hardened up his attitude yesterday to those
in the Tory Party who have given him ''a bad two or three years''.
He warned his party that if the sniping does not end, all his
achievements will be handed over to Mr Tony Blair and the Labour Party.
Last night, he looked like an outright winner but his campaign team
are anxiously awaiting opinion polls in the media over the weekend to
see if Mr Michael Heseltine, a non-runner so far, is the best Tory to
lead them into the next General Election.
This is now a key point in the leadership campaign, because Mr Major
is asserting that he is the best man to do it providing the Tories
''clear the air'' with Tuesday night's decision.
Last night, however, Lord Tebbit, the former Tory Party chairman,
claimed Mr Redwood was the best man.
''He has clear policies, not least on Europe, and his other policies
are not so different to Mr Major's that he can be called an extremist.
So I believe Conservative MPs should vote for John Redwood,'' he
reportedly tells the Sun.
Lord Tebbit also disclosed he had been ready to challenge Mr Major for
the leadership in 1990. ''If I had stood it would have split the
right-wing vote and he would not have got in. But Mr Major persuaded me
he was a Euro-sceptic and I stood aside. Now I know he isn't.''
This boost for the Redwood campaign was last night balanced by a blow
to its image when Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind faced ferocious
heckling from the former Welsh Secretary's supporters during filming of
the BBC2's Newsnight.
As Mr Rifkind defended Mr Major's record on Europe, the economy and
Northern Ireland, Tory activists from the studio audience shouted
''rubbish'' and ''nonsense'', and called for the Prime Minister to quit.
Amid rowdy scenes, some Redwood supporters demanded scrapping the
universal state pension and child benefit and demanded tougher curbs on
immigrants.
Mr Redwood, who was taking part in the debate via a satellite link-up,
shook his head as his supporters made these demands.
Earlier Mr Norman Lamont was forced to demand definite support for his
candidate Redwood: abstentions will not be enough, he said.
In their constituencies this weekend, the Tory MPs will be assessing
with their local parties a situation next week in which there may be
little point in forcing a second ballot, by abstentions or otherwise. Mr
Heseltine and the other possible contender in a second ballot, Mr
Michael Portillo, seem unswerving in their support for Mr Major.
The Prime Minister was in Kent yesterday, where at least 11 of the 16
Tory MPs are supporting him. He used this engagement to launch the final
touches of his campaign.
His key message: ''If anybody thinks the Conservative Party is going
to stand idly by while a small handful of people distract us after this
leadership election from carrying our message to the people as a whole
and winning the next General Election, they are making a very bad
misjudgment indeed.''
He said the Government had gone through ''hell on earth'' in taking
common-sense long- term decisions for the benefit of Britain. ''We have
had the smart snipers on the side, all seeking the short-term easy
solution that will produce nice, easy, comfortable banner headlines the
next day.''
He lambasted media editors and proprietors along with his critics on
Europe, about whom he appears sufficiently confident not to give them a
further inch. Britain stays at the heart of Europe in its own best
interests and he will say ''no'' to anything against those interests.
However, if he wins outright on Tuesday night, he will be the one who
decides when to say ''no'' to Europe and not them.
The other factor that the Prime Minister is calculating is mammoth
support from the Tory regional and constituency parties, whose opinion
is being trawled by Sir Marcus Fox and his 1922 executive committee this
weekend.
Scottish Tory chairman Sir Michael Hirst last night indicated what
this opinion will be with a stinging attack on the anti-Major rebels.
''A small but undisciplined section of the parliamentary party has led
the Conservative Party to the edge of the precipice,'' he said. He
reminded Tories in Ayr that it was Mr Major who had steered the party to
''a famous victory'' at the last General Election.
He went on: ''But for his perseverance and courage in 1992, those
sitting on Government benches today might have been sitting on the
Opposition bench, if at all. Some of those elected on John Major's
coat-tails seem to have forgotten this vital lesson. Today, they are
drinking at the Last Chance Saloon. Now is the time for them to repay
the huge debt owed to him.''
Mr Major's hint of urgency in the parliamentary party's decision on
Tuesday was reflected by Labour deputy leader John Prescott. ''We are
certainly getting the party prepared for an early election, no matter
who the Prime Minister is,'' he said in Aberdeen. He dismissed Mr
Heseltine's popularity: ''He's had it. I don't care who steps into the
breach.''
The Tory majority is falling to seven next month and Conservative back
benchers are beginning to realise that Mr Blair might be able to force a
General Election within the next nine or 10 months. Hence Mr Major's
tone in his campaigning in demanding that the Tuesday leadership
election not only clears the air but ends the disunity.
He and his team, anticipating victory, are already preparing for the
presentation to the nation of a New Look Prime Minister and a New Look
Tory Party.
* Support for Mr Redwood had virtually dried up, bookmakers reported,
while you can only get the Prime Minister at even money, Mr Heseltine at
2-1 against, and Mr Portillo 4-1 against.

ANOTHER art school Principal has joined battle against the Government
over higher education funding cuts.
Two weeks ago Professor Alistair Rowan, principal of Edinburgh College
of Art, reluctantly raised the possibility of charging students a top-up
fee to stave off a looming financial crisis.
His counterpart at Glasgow School of Art, Professor Dugald Cameron,
yesterday described top-up fees as abominable, particularly because they
would deny access to higher education to people like him who came from
working class backgrounds.
He was speaking after delivering a graduation address in which he
called on Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to provide additional funding of
about #250 for each student, which would meet the school's projected
deficiency of about #160,000.
Professor Cameron pointed out that this was less than the recent rise
awarded in salary increase and share options to a private sector chief
executive.
Based on Government grant for teaching and income from fees, the
school receives about #4800 for each student, but Professor Cameron said
more than #5000 was a truer reflection of its financial needs.
The school has plans to make four or five staff redundant as it seeks
to lessen the impact of cuts in funding.
Professor Cameron said higher education faced coping with the
consequences of cuts of 10% over the next three years, on top of
reductions of up to 30% in the amounts provided for teaching over the
last six years.
These cuts put a disproportionate burden on specialist institutions
such as art schools because their teaching was based on studios and
workshops, which meant that they could not make better use of space or
of computerised teaching.
Education had a key role to play as a bulwark for civilised society
but the country risked falling into a ''new barabarism'' if it was
viewed as simply meeting the needs of industry, commerce, and the
professions, Professor Cameron said.
Glasgow School of Art last week received an excellent rating for the
way it taught architecture but Professor Cameron wondered how it could
be expected to maintain such standards when resources were being reduced
year on year.
