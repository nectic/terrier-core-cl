IN May last year the Government announced its intentions to combat
discriminations against disabled people. And in July its document
Disability on the Agenda -- a consultation on Government measures to
tackle discrimination against disabled people was launched.
Positive steps to end once and for all the discrimination faced daily
by disabled people. But not without the earlier determined campaigning
by disabled people and their organisations to have a form of legislation
in place that would permit disabled people to participate fully in the
life of the community.
The document set out five areas of policy: employment, access to
services, financial services, building regulations, and the creation of
a new advisory body on disability.
Campaigning bodies such as the Leonard Cheshire Foundation were keen
to play a role in the consultation process and were eager to have
constructive dialogue with the Government.
Statistics highlighted the presence of discrimination against
Britain's 6.2 million disabled people. Findings showed earnings to be
substantially below the average and that the majority of disabled people
had no access to earned income. Indeed, 75% of disabled people relied on
State benefits as their source of income.
The Cheshire Foundation, in an effort to assist the Government in its
task, embarked on a survey in the form of a questionnaire among
residents and users of its 127 homes and services in the UK.
The findings of the survey were published three months ago and reveal
many abuses that disabled people have to endure in their daily lives.
''Disabled people should have the right to employment and should be
free from direct or indirect discrimination. Access to buildings is
governed by Part M of the building regulations, however, these
regulations are guidelines and are not enshrined in law. We support the
strengthening of the status of Part M.
''Disabled people should have an equal opportunity to exercise choice
within the market place -- whether in the sphere of leisure, recreation
or in the purchase of consumer goods. Many residents and users have
experience of unfair discrimination against them when attempting to
purchase financial services.''
The Cheshire Foundation was created in 1948 and has grown from being a
single home in England to one with more than 320 homes in 52 countries.
The Foundation employs more than 4000 care staff to look after 1800
residents and 2200 Care at Home Service clients.
One area in which progress has been made is in the field of tourism.
The Scottish Tourist Board has published an information booklet for
those disabled visitors to Scotland. The booklet also provides practical
information on facilities and the difficulties disabled people may find
while using the country's airports.
The board has a quality assurance scheme with information on
facilities provided by B&amp;B establishments, caravan holiday homes, and
large hotels. A scoring system using crowns indicates rank.
Melfort Pier and Harbour has been given deluxe status by the tourist
board. Self-contained houses finished to a high standard on the shores
of Loch Melfort make a comfortable base for the family holiday. They
vary in size to sleep up to six persons in three bedrooms.
All ''harbour houses'' have balconies from which guests can enjoy the
views over the bay and to the hills beyond. Three of the houses are
specially adapted for disabled people and have ample room for wheelchair
users. They are on one level with ensuite shower and bath. For the
family they represent an ideal holiday venue where everyone is
encouraged to take part in activities.
The Scottish Naidex '95 exhibition takes place at the SECC, Glasgow on
March 29 and 30. There is no admission charge. It returns after a
two-year break and will give disabled people and their carers as well as
the professional services a chance to see the latest developments in
equipment and services that have been designed to ease rehabilitation.
Displayed at the ScottishPower stand will be a range of controls and
adaptors for electrical appliances and small-scale kitchen appliances
specially designed for the elderly and disabled people.
NT Access will be exhibiting a selection of door activation equipment
as well as security video and telephone entry systems which are
compatible with automatic or manual doors.
More than 150 exhibitors will highlight the latest developments and
advances in a variety of products and services from furnishings and
household equipment to mobility aids and speech therapy.

Christopher Portway finds peace in a land where unrest was routine
THE Scottish Borders fall between two stools. Lacking the drama of the
Highlands, north and southbound before their existence is barely
realised. Thus the Borders are shamefully neglected.
I entered the Borders by following, on foot, a Roman road -- Dere
Street -- that runs there straight than any parallel modern highway from
York. North of Hadrian's Wall was where my footsteps lightened on this
splendid land.
On the southern side of the Cheviots is a territory of stirring
legends, battles of long ago and cattle-rustling reivers; a landscape of
far horizons and meandering rivers, a history of enduring rivalry with
England and of heroes whose names are remembered to this day.
The lush, well-tended and richly timbered Borders are loosely stitched
with small, fiercely independent towns, many containing the substantial
ruins of a great abbey or adjacent to the occupied castle-like mansions
of famed landowners. In the east is a ragged coast still endowed with
fishing fleets and possessing the highly dramatic nature reserve of St
Abbs Head, a blizzard of kittiwakes with rock shelves stacked with
raucous guillemots and razorbills.
For walkers, backpackers and cyclists this magical countryside might
have been crafted with them in mind. Lanes and footpaths vein the grassy
hillslopes and follow the tree-lined rivers connecting towns and
villages. The small, uncluttered roads are a bane to motorists choosing
to tour by car.
The Tweed Bridge on the south side of Coldstream marks the border with
England to offer first-timers a gentle introduction to Scotland.
Coldstream is one of a number of royal burghs with market place, town
cross and severe dark-grey stone houses brightened by an abundance of
cultivated flowers. The textile industry continues to flourish here and
visitors are encouraged to follow the various craft trails and tour
mills.
It is in the heart of the region where most of the towns and the famed
abbey ruins are to be found. At the confluence of the Tweed and the
Teviot stands Kelso displaying a flower-strewn market square, cobbled
streets and distinguished-looking houses as well as its Romanesque
abbey. Its Tweed Bridge was the forerunner of London Bridge and up-river
is Floors Castle, residence of the Duke of Roxburgh.
Further along the Tweed is Melrose which grew up around its twelfth
century abbey, the extensive and splendid ruin set beside an orchard
garden in the shadow of the abruptly rising Eildon Hills, once the
northern limit of the Roman Empire in Britain.
Nearby is the village of Newstead, the site of Trimontium -- the fort
of the three hills -- where Dere Street has its northern terminus. At
Jedburgh there is a picturesque High Street, market square and the abbey
church, almost entire but roofless. And Selkirk, a delightful county
town not taking itself too seriously being known not for a prestigious
abbey but for its tasty buns.
More abbeys and a host of historic castles litter the countryside.
Dryburgh is the most secluded of the abbeys, rising from inside a loop
of the Tweed and housing the graves of Field Marshall Earl Haig and Sir
Walter Scott. Mellerstain, Manderston and Paxton are lived-in classical
mansions containing a truly fascinating collection of historic
furniture, paintings and memorabilia as well as lush woodland gardens to
match.
At Jedburgh again is the house of Mary Queen of Scots, a fortified
town-house laden with evocative mementoes of the queen (including her
death-mask), and at Kelso is Floors Castle.
To the coast and at Eyemouth is a museum of fishermen and fisherwomen
with particular emphasis on the Great East Coast Fishing Disaster of
1881 which claimed 189 lives. Craft centres are legion, some very much
better than others.
Accommodation in the Borders ranges from simple bed and breakfasts to
a suite in the west turret of a mighty castle. At the higher end of the
scale is Duns Castle, a magnificent pile built around an original 1320
Pele Tower once owned by Robert the Bruce.
The old antagonism between the two countries has now matured to a
good-hearted rivalry but violent history will forever be stamped upon
the fair face of the Borders.

COMPERE Ms Janice Forsyth rather hit the tack on the bonce towards the
end of last night's charity tribute, when she observed that it said a
lot for Alasdair Cameron that the evening's entertainment encompassed
both comedian and broadcaster Andy Cameron and the Lyric Hammersmith's
artistic director Neil Bartlett. Who you thought was funnier was
entirely a matter of personel taste.
Cameron, who died last year, was a much-loved and highly influential
figure in the development of Scottish theatre in this writer's time, and
you would have picked that up from last night's show. But more than
that, you would have acquired a real sense of the man himself -- and
that says rather more for the director Kim Dambaek, the organising
comittee and the very varied bill of performers. As Pene Herman-Smith
(in Jean Brodie guise) told us early on, Cameron was liable to quote
Proust, Avro Part and the Pet Shop Boys in the one sentence.
Tartan Trifles, consequently, was a variety show in the traditional
sense, but with a modern sensibility.
It was not just Cameron's vast knowledge of Scottish theatre history
that made Jimmy Logan's rendition of Keep Right On To The End Of The
Road seem entirely appropriate -- it was also the fact that it was
bloody good and, well, deeply moving.
From Charlie McKerron's specially composed fiddle tune to Bartlett's
camp theatre barman, the evening was a delight -- but special plaudits
should go the Clyde Unity team of John and Mari Binnie and Stephen
Docherty for their hilarious contributions. The funds raised from the
performance will help establish a director's scholarship that will bear
Alasdair Cameron's name -- the audience last night will have high
expectations of the recipients.

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown will today name his squad for the crunch
game against Russia in Moscow next week, and last night he was pondering
the inevitable problems which surround his selection.
He knows he will upset in-form striker John McGinlay if he insists on
the Bolton man missing his club's game against Portsmouth on Saturday.
He knows he will be under fire if he selects off-form Aberdeen star
Eoin Jess who has managed less than 30 minutes play in the last two
games.
He recognises the need for the experience and the revived form of
Manchester United's Brian McClair in the toughest qualifying game of the
European Championship group. But he also has to accept that McClair will
only accept the Moscow invitation if he is guaranteed a starting place.
The former Celtic player made that a condition when he quit the
international scene after the last European Championship Finals. He has
not been back since.
To make way for him Brown must ditch players who have been willing to
accept a squad place and make no further demands on the manager.
He will also risk a backlash of criticism for picking Paul McStay
whose form has been questioned by his own club manager.
Nothing is easy for the Scotland manager.
Even the obvious need to stick by Everton's Duncan Ferguson will be
criticised by some because the striker is under suspension.
Personally, I see no problem there. Brown has already picked Hearts'
defender Craig Levein while he was suspended and, in any case, the
championships carry their own punishments. Why should anyone suffer
twice?
The bulk of the squad will remain largely as before. Jim Leighton will
be first choice goalkeeper in the absence of Andy Goram and Nicky Walker
will be his number two.
There will be no great shocks. Brown will go to Moscow with what he
has available.
McGinlay did not make it any easier for him yesterday when he scored a
spectacular goal to beat Millwall at The Den.
The player said afterwards: ''It was the best goal of my career. It
was also my 100th League goal. I know I have to keep on getting goals to
stay in the Scotland squad.''
Today, he will almost certainly ask Brown for permission to play next
Saturday instead of spending an hour or so training at Fir Park. In my
view, he should be allowed to play.
After all, Colin Hendry played on a Sunday this season -- something
the manager said he would never allow. A happy McGinlay might be
important in Moscow. An unhappy McGinlay might not be in the mood he has
shown so often this season for his club.
I don't know if that is a risk Craig Brown should take.

NEW Zealand battled towards respectability by reaching 95 for two at
close of a rain-hit second day of the second Test against Sri Lanka in
Dunedin.
About two-and-a-half hours' play was lost because of rain. At close,
opener Bryan Young was 44 not out, with Stephen Fleming on 39.
New Zealand lost two early wickets. Darrin Murray toiled for 57
minutes without scoring before being caught behind off Chaminda Vaas
and, three balls later, Mark Greatbatch played back to a Vaas delivery
and was out lbw for a duck.
Vaas has been Sri Lanka's star of the tour, claiming 10 wickets in the
crushing first Test victory in Napier and scoring 51 in their first
innings of 233 in this match.
The unbroken stand between Young and Fleming was all the more vital
because of doubts over whether captain Ken Rutherford would be able to
bat. He split the webbing between the fourth and fifth fingers on his
left hand while fielding on the first day, with the injury requiring
three stitches. His hand was still swollen and sore, and coach John Reid
said he was unsure if Rutherford would be able to bat if required on
today's third day.
* LOCAL hero Carl Hooper capped a wonderful one-day series, picking up
three for 36 with his off-spinners and hitting his fourth half-century
of the series, to be man of the match as the West Indies won the final
match against Australia by five wickets in Georgetown, Guyana, and the
series by 4-1. Scores:
Australia (50 overs) 286-9 (M Waugh 71, M Taylor 66); West Indies
(47.2 overs) 287 for five (P Simmons 70, J Adams 60 n.o., C Hooper 50).

EXCUSE me, but did I miss something?
This was the it. The Big One, a contest of strategies, wills, and
power at the end of which the survivors would get to claim all the
prizes both real and mythical, but when the dust settled on Saturday
afternoon, some of us were left asking: ''You mean that's it. It's
over?''
The 112th meeting between England and Scotland was over before
anything much happened. Of course Rob Andrew's display of kicking was
remarkable and there were a few charges towards the line, but there were
no exhilarating tries which would have had Twickenham swinging.
A posse of English fans ran on to the pitch at the end, but even the
invasion was insignificant and half-hearted. Most of the people seemed
unsure of what they were supposed to do once on the turf.
Some of the younger supporters cavorted on the grass pretending to be
real rugby players, like one or two of the adults who had performed
earlier, in fact, and the rest just sort of hung around trying to get a
chorus of that dreadful song ''Swing low'' going. Their attempts died of
apathy, thankfully.
The English just don't know how to celebrate and some of them have no
idea how to behave in victory either. That foolish little hooker Brian
Moore belittled his country's triumph by accusing Scotland of having
killed the game when it might be closer to the truth to suggest England,
who fancy themselves strongly for the World Cup, displayed little of the
ingenuity they will require in South Africa.
When Will Carling heard questions about England's ability he rolled
his eyes towards the ceiling like another spoiled child. You know, the
more we see of rugby players and the greater the profile the media give
them, the more they remind you of footballers. Sooner or later rugby
players will be salaried and that's when they will adopt all of the
classic traits of the modern professional footballer.
Money currupts some and distorts the values of many in sport, as in
every other walk of life, and it will be inevitable when the game
becomes open that rugby players will sport more petted lips, requests
for interviews will be dismissed, and criticism, even though it may be
constructive, will no longer be tolerated. Petulance will become the new
mood of the day.
It is because of what probably lies ahead for rugby that Twickenham
should have been a demonstration of everything that is good and noble in
the sport, but it didn't work out that way. It never came close to
living up to the hype, yet the weekend started in promising fashion on
Friday morning with a survivor from the White Heather Club standing in
Paddington with bagpipe music wailing from a speaker at his feet.
Red Nose Jock he called himself as he invited commuters to toss coins
into his Comic Relief box, but a pin-striped gent hurrying by refused to
enter into the spirit. ''I'll give you #20 if you stop the music,'' he
said.
''You'll get yours tomorrow at Twickers, Henry,'' I thought to myself,
but, of course, the English never did.
Nevertheless, being there as Scots trickled in off trains and planes
made it all come flooding back, memories of bitter sweet invasions into
England's capital. Friendly invasions they were in the main and back in
London for a major sporting event against the auld enemy made the sense
of loss for the real thing, Wembley, all the more acute and painful.
Those were the days, or at least they were before a small number
started to travel just to cause skirmishes and fall drunk into the water
at Trafalgar Square. Of course, before a malevolence tainted the Wembley
Weekend, there had always been alcoholic casualties and many fell by the
wayside in sight of the Twin Towers.
The evening before the 1983 Wembley match, a travelling companion --
he must remain nameless because his wife thought he was away working in
Aberdeen over the weekend -- fell out of a window one floor up in a
crowded Chelsea pub. The guy who was working in Aberdeen sat on the
sill, but not for long.
Someone bumped him and he somersaulted out. He also did a double pike
before landing on the pavement below with his pint glass still in his
hand and still intact. He was given full tens by every street-side judge
and suffered no more than severe bruising to his buttocks, which somehow
he managed to keep hidden for weeks on returning home.
There was none of that in London last weekend, but then Twickenham
attracts a different kind of creature altogether. Shame, that. It's just
not the same.

CHRIS Eubank's philosophical view of defeat was not shared by his
trainer, Ronnie Davies, in the peaceful Irish setting of Millstreet on
Saturday night.
An angry Davies insisted that Eubank had thrown away his World Boxing
Organisation super-middleweight title by holding back against Steve
Collins in an explosive tenth round.
The Irishman escaped to win and make the first entry in the loss
column of Eubank's record.
In that round, Collins was on the floor from a big right, but Eubank
made the crucial mistake of not following up his advantage. And, for
once, his annoying tendency of posing -- instead of punching -- cost him
dear.
Davies said: ''Eubank threw it away, he had him out. Collins was gone
and Chris walked away from it. I told him coming out for the tenth that
he was two rounds behind and had to stop him. He had to throw the right,
which he did, and Collins was finished. One more clean punch and it was
over.
''But Chris stood off and showboated. He should have taken the
opportunity and not backed off. He has always sailed close to the wind,
but this time he went too close. He'll regret this for the rest of his
life.''
And the rest of Eubank's life? He would not commit himself following
the unanimous points defeat in an absorbing, although often untidy,
battle fought out in front of a partisan 7000 crowd.
But it will be a major suprise if Eubank walks away from the sport he
openly dislikes. There will be good money available for a second fight
with Collins, and he recently revealed that he faces a tax debt of
around #2m.
After his eight-fight Sky World Tour had been derailed at station
No.5, Eubank, promoter Barry Hearn, and the television chiefs will have
to restudy a clause in the original contract.
It caters for a 10-round warm-up fight, then a rematch with the first
man to beat him, and Hearn wants that to be staged at Lansdowne Road
later this year. But all decisions on the future are in Eubank's hands.
''I've had a good run, no complaints about the result,'' said Eubank.
''I got drawn into a fight. Steve Collins' fortitude was very strong.
The outcome is the outcome.
''I can say now that I regret not finishing it in the tenth round, but
did I have the strength? I actually thought it was the eleventh. I
thought I could have danced away the round and probably win the twelfth
and the fight.''
Collins contemplated his elevation into the big-money league after the
victory.
When Eubank threatened to pull out after Collins' claim that he had
been under hypnotherapy, the new champion knew he come out on top in the
pre-fight mental sparring.
After taking the verdict, Collins revealed that it was all a trick.
''I wasn't hypnotised. We played a trick and fooled them all,'' said
Collins.
The new champion wants a midsummer first defence at Dublin's Croke
Park, where he would be confident of drawing a 50,000-crowd. Then could
come a rematch with Eubank.
Naturally, Collins also spoke of major-profile fights with World
Boxing Council champion Nigel Benn and International Boxing Federation
king Roy Jones, reckoned by many as the world's best pound-for pound
exponent.
But Collins-Eubank Mark II could be easier to put together -- and be
worth a fortune to the Dubliner.
While Collins paraded his new WBO belt, he was preparing to relinquish
the WBO middleweight title he won last May.

By RAYMOND JACOBS in Portugal
AFTER 10 barren years on the European Tour, 31-year-old Adam Hunter of
Glasgow yesterday gained his first victory by winning the Portuguese
Open championship at Penha Longa. In bright sunshine, he defeated
Dungannon's Darren Clarke with a birdie 4 at the 545-yard eighteenth,
the first hole of their sudden-death play-off for the title.
Clarke, 26, who also was runner-up eight days bfore on the other side
of the world, in the Malaysian Open, pulled wide of the green and
chipped very short from a bad lie. Hunter, bunkered in two, assured
himself of the #50,000 first prize by recovering to five feet and holing
after Clarke's birdie putt pulled up inches short.
Afterwards Hunter, a Rangers season ticket-holder, expressed his
emotions: ''I'm thrilled. I've been so long just making up the numbers
that actually to have gone out and won is something else. I've committed
myself to improvement, with coaching to alter my swing and advice on
increasing my fitness.''
Equal seventh place in Morocco the previous week was a favourable
straw in the wind. Hunter, who represents the Strathclyde Park golf
centre, added: ''I wouldn't have been disappointed if I hadn't won this
season, but now I'm delighted to have earned some serious money and
justified the support I've had from my wife, family, and friends.''
In fact, Hunter and Clarke had chances of outright victory playing the
last as the seventy-second hole. From the fairway Hunter struck a superb
driver shot 270-yards through the breeze, eight feet behind the hole,
only to misread the eagle putt. Clarke's drive behind a tree forced him
out to the far side of the adjoining first fairway, from where par was
his only realistic ambition.
Thus Hunter with a final round of 68 -- matched by only three others
and none in contention -- set the target of 277, 11 under par, some 40
minutes before Clarke finished. He was round in 70, partnering his Irish
World and Dunhill Cup teams' colleague, Paul McGinley, who had himself
led by a stroke on 12 under with six to play.
But McGinley, three times runner-up in tour events, dropped four
strokes in the last five holes for a 73 for a share of third place with
Jon Robson and Zimbabwe's Tony Johnstone on 280, two strokes behind the
Argentinian, Jose Coceres, who resolutely closed with two birdies after
having shanked to a double bogey 6 at the sixteenth.
Hunter, whose only previous 72-hole success was in the 1987 Northern
Open, joined a distinguished list of Scottish winners of this title --
Eric Brown, Brian Barnes, Sam Torrance, and Colin Montgomerie having
preceded him. Victory, the sixth by a newcomer in the first eight
tournaments of 1995, was all the sweeter for having been so hard earned.
For seven successive years from 1984, Hunter had to endure the
qualifying school and he believed his chances of progress so slight that
a year past January he applied for the post of Scottish Golf Union
coach. He reached the short list and acknowledged yesterday: ''If I'd
got the job, I wouldn't have been here.
''Anyway, my wife Caroline told me I would have missed tournament life
and she was right,'' Hunter added. ''I think I should thank Billy
Lockie, who was given that appointment in the end.'' With that,
clutching a large bottle of champagne and with every intention of a
celebration, Hunter made for Lisbon Airport.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
277 -- A Hunter 73, 65, 71, 68; D Clarke 72, 69, 66, 70. (Hunter won
at first play-off hole, Hunter wins #50,000, Clarke #33,330).
278 -- J Coceres (Argentina) 69, 72, 68, 69 (#18,780).
280 -- T Johnstone (Zimbabwe) 71, 68, 71, 70; J Robson 70, 71, 68, 71;
P McGinley 74, 65, 68, 73 (#12,733 each).
281 -- F Lindgren (Sweden) 71, 73, 69, 68; P Curry 68, 70, 73, 70; M A
Jimenez (Spain) 68, 66, 75, 72.
282 -- C Mason 72, 71, 71, 68; R Claydon 70, 74, 69, 69; R McFarlane
70, 71, 70, 71; M Davis 71, 67, 72, 72; P Lawrie 75, 67, 68, 72; J
Spence 74, 67, 69, 72; C Rocca (Italy) 68, 69, 70, 75.

LAURA Davies outlasted Beth Daniel in a head-to-head pairing yesterday
to win her second straight US LPGA Standard Register-Ping championship
with a total of 12-under-par 280.
Davies, who had a two-shot lead over Daniel and four shots on amateur
Wendy Ward in the final threesome, bogeyed the last two holes for a par
73, but she had a big enough lead to beat Daniel by one stroke and win
her ninth US title and thirty-fourth worldwide.
She won $105,000 and moved from tenth to second in earnings with
$156,932 in four tournaments. Final scores (Americans unless stated):
280 -- Laura Davies (Britain) 69, 68, 70, 73.

* GEORGE Archer's 25ft birdie putt at the seventeenth hole proved to
be the winner yesterday as he shot a six-under-par 64 in the final round
of the Toshiba Senior Classic at Costa Mesa, California.
Archer, who earned $120,000, finished at 11-under-par 199 to beat Dave
Stockton and Tom Wargo by one stroke. Stockton matched Archer with a
final 64. Wargo, the leader after two rounds, had a closing 68. Other

By ROBINSON HOLLOWAY in Orlando
GREAT putting can make up for a number of long-game problems and win
golf tournaments, so it was not surprising that the best putter on the
US PGA Tour, Loren Roberts, should have defended his Nestle Invitational
title successfully at Bay Hill yesterday. What was remarkable was that
his second Nestle was also just his second career title.
Even though he bogeyed the last two holes, Roberts had built up enough
of a cushion that he was able to win by two shots at 16 under par. Brad
Faxon, who is almost as good a putter, was second after having sunk a
40-foot putt for a birdie at the last.
Peter Jacobsen, the current US money-leader with some $700,000 in
seven tournaments, was third after he bogeyed the last. Jacobsen has in
his past five starts accumulated two wins, a second, and a third.
Roberts, 39, has made a career out of being really close to winning,
never more so than last year at Oakmont, where he nearly won the US
Open, earning a spot in the three-way play-off that also included Colin
Montgomerie and eventual champion Ernie Els.
Roberts led at Bay Hill from Friday morning, when he shot a
second-round 65, though the margin shifted from six strokes to a tie
with Faxon.
By the time he made the turn yesterday, Roberts had a three-stroke
lead, and this time the margin just kept widening until with just two to
play he could afford to bogey in.
Nick Faldo tied for fifth after having played the last two rounds in
10 under par. Final scores (Americans unless stated):
272 -- L Roberts 68, 65, 68, 71.
274 -- B Faxon 69, 70, 64, 71.
275 -- P Jacobsen 70, 68, 68, 69.
277 -- S Stricker 67, 72, 69, 69.
278 -- N Faldo (England) 71, 73, 66, 68; J Haas 72, 69, 69, 68; D
Waldorf 71, 72, 70, 65; M McCumber 69, 70, 69, 70; J Parnevik (Sweden)
67, 72, 67, 72; B Lohr 69, 70, 67, 72.
279 -- G Norman (Australia) 71, 69, 70, 69; S Simpson 70, 71, 70, 68;
M McNulty (Zimbabwe) 68, 72, 67, 72.
280 -- P Burke 71, 73, 70, 66; N Price (Zimbabwe) 71, 70, 68, 71.
Other scores included: 284 -- B Langer (Germany) 71, 69, 75, 69. 286

EGLINTON, from the second division of the Torrie Stockbrokers National
League, yesterday produced their finest cup result by knocking out first
division opponents Grange, after a penalty shoot-out following a 1-1
draw at Kilwinning, writes Joseph Dillon.
Their triumph is all the more surprising for they were beaten 2-0 by
Edinburgh University in the league on Saturday. A second defeat looked
on the cards at half-time when they trailed by a Jenny Bryce goal. Then
15 minutes from time former Scottish internationalist Judith Martin put
Eglinton level.
In the resulting penalty shoot-out, Eglinton failed with their first
two efforts but got back on level terms at 2-2. Marjory Steele was on
final strike but she made the conversion to ensure the club of their
first appearance in the last four.
Edinburgh Ladies coasted through to the semis, beating Heriot Watt 4-0
through Fiona MacInnes, Alli Grant, Elaine Cooper and Rhona Simpson, to
join Eglinton and Western Klick Photopoint. The final place will be
decided after Bonagrass Grove play Royal High Gymnasts on Tuesday.
In the league, Western regained the leadership on goal difference by
beating Heriot Watt 2-0 through scores by Sheena McKelvie and Jackie
Lothian. They now head Grove who were 7-0 victors at home to Grange.
Nikki Kleppang scored three of their goals.
Edinburgh Ladies are also on the 22-point mark and they, like Western,
have a game in hand on Grove. Results:
Saturday: Torrie Stockbrokers National League Division 1 -- Bonagrass
Grove 7, Grange 0; Western Klick Photopoint 2, Heriot Watt University 0.
Division 2 -- Eglinton 0, Edinburgh University 2; Hyndland A 1,
Hutchesons' FP 0; Melrose 1, Aberdeen Bon Accord 0. Division 3 --
Central Wanderers 0, Hillhead 3; Kirkcaldy 1, Selkirk 1; Perthshire 3,
Dumfries 0; Trinity 1, Carmuirs 0. Division 4 -- Greenock 0, Grove A 5,
Hillhead A 3, Dalziel 0; Hutchesons' A 0, Dundee HSFP 2; Gymnasts A 9,
Stepps A 0; Vale of Leven 2, Ardrossan 0.
Sunday: League Cup quarter-finals -- Edinburgh Ladies 4, Heriot Watt
University 0; Eglinton 1, Grange 1 (Eglinton won 3-2 on penalties).
Torrie Stockbrokers National League Division 2 -- Hyndland A 1, Aberdeen

NEW Zealand battled towards respectability by reaching 95 for two at
close of a rain-hit second day of the second Test against Sri Lanka in
Dunedin.
About two-and-a-half hours' play was lost because of rain. At close,
opener Bryan Young was 44 not out, with Stephen Fleming on 39.
New Zealand lost two early wickets. Darrin Murray toiled for 57
minutes without scoring before being caught behind off Chaminda Vaas
and, three balls later, Mark Greatbatch played back to a Vaas delivery
and was out lbw for a duck.
Vaas has been Sri Lanka's star of the tour, claiming 10 wickets in the
crushing first Test victory in Napier and scoring 51 in their first
innings of 233 in this match.
The unbroken stand between Young and Fleming was all the more vital
because of doubts over whether captain Ken Rutherford would be able to
bat. He split the webbing between the fourth and fifth fingers on his
left hand while fielding on the first day, with the injury requiring
three stitches. His hand was still swollen and sore, and coach John Reid
said he was unsure if Rutherford would be able to bat if required on
today's third day.
* LOCAL hero Carl Hooper capped a wonderful one-day series, picking up
three for 36 with his off-spinners and hitting his fourth half-century
of the series, to be man of the match as the West Indies won the final
match against Australia by five wickets in Georgetown, Guyana, and the
series by 4-1. Scores:
Australia (50 overs) 286-9 (M Waugh 71, M Taylor 66); West Indies
(47.2 overs) 287 for five (P Simmons 70, J Adams 60 n.o., C Hooper 50).

THE semi-final line-up in the Scottish Cup next Sunday at Peffermill
was completed yesterday when Grange and Menzieshill were joined by
Western and Touche Ross, who made short work of their second division
opponents, Devol Greenock and Stepps, writes Joseph Dillon.
It was all one-way traffic towards George McKenzie in the Greenock
goal at Auchinhowie where Western's overwhelming pressure should have
produced a greater victory than 5-0. Graham Joyce and Steven Menzies
shared four of their goals. Niall Sturrock hit the fifth.
Touche Ross beat Stepps 6-3, but on their journey back to Aberdeen
they will have had plenty of time to reflect on their defensive penalty
corners after Stepps hit the target with three of their six awards.
This was an amazing game for corners. Fifteen in total were awarded,
producing eight goals, five of them in an eight minute spell before
half-time.
Scottish internationals Andrew Milne scored three and Phil Webster was
responsible for two with Richard Freeland hitting the northerners' other
goal. Breckenridge (2) and Coffey replied for Stepps.
McMahon Kelburne have now almost certainly parted company with the
Torrie Stockbrokers League title after having been held to a goalless
draw yesterday by Edinburgh University.
The title is now a two-horse race between Grange and MIM. Results:
Saturday: Torrie Stockbrokers League Division 1 -- Edinburgh
University 1, Western 1; Grange 5, Torbrex Wanderers 0; Menzieshill 1,
Touche Ross 1; McMahon Kelburne 8, Watsonians 1: MIM 4, Insights

SCOTLAND'S women, winners last year, are favourites to retain the
title at the British championship and home international series which
starts today in Ballymoney, writes Gordon Dunwoodie.
The Scots launch their defence tomorrow when they take on Wales, then
it's England on Wednesday, with the programme being completed by the
following day against Ireland.
Today the individual British championships hold centre stage, and
Stonehaven's Catherine McIntosh will be chasing the crown. World indoor
champion Jan Woodley, named only as reserve in the Scottish
international side, lines up in the pairs with West of Scotland
club-mate Angie Baird, while in the fours, Galleon defend the title.
Scotland have made seven changes from last year's side for the
international series, with six new caps and one recall.
The new caps are Anne Bisset (Garioch), Marian Boyle (Fintry), Mae
Donaldson (Nithsdale), Roberta Hutchieson (Falkirk), Jackie Macfarlane
(Edinburgh), and Tweedbank's Christine Miller, while Bainfield's Anne
Watson is recalled to the side.
* PERTH, having beaten Ayr in a semi-final, won the final of the
Scottish Civil Service indoor championship at Livingston. Perth now will
represent Scotland in the British championships at York next month.
Results:
Final -- Perth (H Donaldson, R Wood, P Doherty, J Thomson) 20,
Cumbernauld 3. Semi-finals -- Cumbernauld 12, Glasgow 8; Perth 15, Ayr

ALISTAIR McRae gave the new-look Mobil 1/Top Gear British Rally
Championship the best possible start by winning the opening round in
Wales on Saturday.
Driving a two-litre, two-wheel Nissan Sunny, 24-year-old McRae
withstood relentless pressure from a field of international drivers to
win the Chester-based Vauxhall Rally of Wales by 55 seconds after two
days and 130 miles of competitive driving.
McRae's success -- his first international rally victory -- created
what must be a unique treble: he is the third member of the Lanark
family to win this event after his father, Jimmy, in 1979 and his older
brother, Colin, in 1992.
Finland's Olli Harkki, driving a Mitsubishi Lancer, was second and
fellow Finn Jarmo Kytolehto, in an Astra, was third. Welshmen Gwyndaf
Evans in a Ford Escort was fourth and David Llewellin, the defending
British Formula 2 champion, was fifth.
Ayrshire's Robbie Head, making his debut with France's Renault team,
returned with a holed sump on his Clio while eighth overall.
Jock Armstrong from Castle Douglas finished fifteenth overall on his
first outing in the Shell Scholarship Nissan Sunny. Ayr's Tom Coughtrie
was twenty-third in the Paramins Subaru Legacy.
Richard Moore from Forfar was thirty-fifth in his newly-built Astra
and Redmond Barry, from Auchterarder, was forty-first in his Suzuki
Swift. Provisional results:
1, A McRae/D Senior (Nissan Sunny) 2hr 43min 35sec; 2, O Harkki/A
Virjula (Mitsubishi Lancer) 2-44-30; 3, J Kytolehto/A Kapanen (Vauxhal
Astra) 2-44-39; 4, G Evans/H Davies (Ford Escort) 2-44-49; 5, D
Llewellin/I Grindrod (Vauxhall Astra) 2-45-06; 6, C Mellors/B Goff (Ford
Escort) 2-46-07.
* MICHAEL Schumacher will be staring down the barrel of a British
six-shooter when he begins the defence of his world championship crown
in Brazil on Sunday.
The home threat to the German's Grand Prix hopes has, of course, been
diluted by former champion Nigel Mansell being squeezed out of at least
the first two races because of cockpit problems.
But with Mark Blundell given a Formula One reprieve by taking
Mansell's place at McLaren, the six-strong British challenge is still a
formidable one.
Leading the threat will be the Williams Renault duo of Damon Hill and
flying Scotsman David Coulthard.
Schumacher will also have to be wary of his Benetton team-mate Johnny
Herbert.
Martin Brundle will have a point to prove following his move to Ligier
from McLaren, even though he will sit out the season's opener in
deference to the team's Japanese sponsors.
Ulsterman Eddie Irvine has given notice during testing in Estoril that
he could help Jordan break into the big time.

MARTIN Heath stayed on course yesterday to join fellow Scot Peter

championships in Cardiff, writes Elspeth Burnside.
The Oban player was in top form in scoring a straight games win over
Finland's Juha Raumolin in the second qualifying round.
The world No.38 who defeated England's Lee Drew 15-7, 15-10, 15-12 in
Saturday's first round, was even more impressive in defeating the former
British Junior Open champion 15-8, 15-2, 15-7.
Today, he meets the former Scottish Open under 19 title-holder, Stefan
Castelyn, from Belgium, for a place in tomorrow's first round proper.
Anglo-Scot Stuart Cowie went out in the first qualifying round to
Australian Byron Davies.
Edinburgh's Lisa McKenna also failed to get past the first hurdle
against Stephanie Brind in the women's event.
Qualifying results included:
Men: first round -- M Heath (Scotland) beat L Drew (England) 15-7,
15-10, 15-12; B Davies (Australia) beat S Cowie (Scotland) 15-11, 15-5,

RONNIE O'Sullivan will return today from a 12-day jaunt to the Far
East determined to complete a Masters double at Goffs, Co Kildare, this
week.
O'Sullivan, winner of the Benson and Hedges Masters at Wembley last
month, makes only his second appearance at the Irish Masters, in which
he plays John Parrott tomorrow for a place in the quarter-finals.
The 19-year-old was runner-up to James Wattana in the Kloster Thailand
Open in Bangkok at the weekend and although he hates losing he remains
optimistic that the rest of the season will be more rewarding.
He said: ''I've set my stall out, and, while James played better than
me to retain his title, I still reckon I'm in with a big shout for the
last three events of the season -- the Irish Masters, British Open, and
Embassy World championship.''
O'Sullivan never recovered from losing the first four frames as
Wattana moved relentlessly towards his first major title of the season.
The Chigwell youngster got to within one frame of the Thaiphoon at
6-5, but his confidence evaporated after missing a pink to leave Wattana
a 50 clearance to lead 7-5. Half an hour later, it was all over as the
world No.3 completed a 9-6 victory.

STEPHEN Gallacher led Scotland's amateur team to a 16-8 victory over
France yesterday at the Moliets Golf Club, Bordeaux, writes Matthew
Lindsay.
The former Scottish amateur champion was the only member of the
eight-man team to complete the two-day event with four points, beating
Francois Illouz by two holes in the afternoon after having disposed of
the same player and Jerome Chevalier in the morning foursomes alongside
Gordon Sherry.
Reigning Scottish Amateur champion Hugh McKibbin also played well. His
Ayrshire playing-partner Alan Reid helped him chalk up a win in the
morning, while in the afternoon, the Troon Welbeck youngster birdied the
final two holes to edge out Diego Dupin.
Although conceding that the young French side were not demanding
opposition, non-playing captain Colin Dalgleish was pleased with the
progression of his side since last season's disappointing home
internationals.
He said: ''I was most pleased with six points from the foursomes which
hasn't been a strong area.'' Result:
France 8, Scotland 16. Foursomes -- G Sherry (Kilmarnock Barassie) and
S Gallacher (Bathgate) beat F Illouz and J Chevalier 2 and 1; A Reid
(Kilmarnock Barassie) and H McKibbin beat M Diew and L Paragade 3 and 2;
G Rankin (Palacerigg) and B Howard (Cochrane Castle) beat O Dupas and J
Wolff 3 and 2; D Downie (Ladybank) and A Turnbull (Peebles) lost to D
Dupin and I Goronskoul one hole.
Singles -- S Gallacher beat F Illouz by two holes; G Sherry lost to M
Diew 2 and 1; B Howard beat L Paragade 5 and 4; D Downie beat J Wolff 4
and 3; A Reid lost to J Chevalier 4 and 3; A Turnbull lost to I
Goronskoul 2 and 1; G Rankin halved with O Dupas. H McKibbin beat D
Dupin by two holes.

STEPHEN Wilson of Wallyford, tops the bill at the St Andrew's Sporting
Club in Glasgow tonight. The 23-year-old faces his biggest test yet when
he meets Bury's Glenn Campbell in a final eliminator for the British
super-middleweight title.
Both men have lost only once in the paid ranks and both fancy
themselves to win inside the distance.
Wilson, who boxed at the 1992 Olympics, has been sidelined since
October because of injury. Previously, he had to fight
light-heavyweights beause most in the super-middle division avoided him.
He said: ''I am really strong at 12 stone. I don't see this fight going
too far.''
Campbell, however, packs a good punch. Twelve of his 13 wins have come
inside the distance.

EDINBURGH Racers dented Nottingham Panthers' premier division title
hopes with a surprise 8-5 victory in the capital last night, writes
Nigel Duncan.
The sides were locked at 2-2 after the opening period but Racers
forged ahead in the second, winning it 4-2, and they confirmed the
points with a 2-1 scoreline in the third.
Canadian Chris Palmer hit top form, scoring five goals, and his
linemate Ivan Matulik counted two.
Racers' captain Tony Hand set up five strikes and the win was a big
confidence booster for the home side with the British championship
play-offs looming.
Fife Flyers made it a weekend win double when they beat Milton Keynes
Kings 12-5 in England last night, and Dumfries Vikings notched their
fifth win in 43 games when they edged Lee Valley 6-3 with Vas Vasilenko
hitting a hat trick.
Paisley Pirates went down to a surprise 6-5 defeat by Lee Valley Lions
on Saturday.
Coach Martin Shields, who has guided Pirates into the promotion
play-offs, warned his side of the dangers of complacency against the
first division strugglers, but Pirates paid the price. Results:
SATURDAY. Premier division -- Basingstoke 6, Fife 8; Bracknell 6,
Whitley 8; Nottingham 4, Cardiff 8; Peterborough 6, Durham 5; Sheffield
13, Edinburgh 5.
Division 1 -- Medway 11, Blackburn 5; Paisley 5, Lee Valley 6; Swindon
10, Slough 11; Telford 13, Dumfries 3; Trafford 13, Solihull 12.

Whitley 5; Edinburgh 8, Nottingham 5; Humberside 6, Cardiff 8; Milton
Keynes 5, Fife 12; Sheffield 7, Basingstoke 5.
Division 1 -- Dumfries 6, Lee Valley 3; Guildford 5, Medway 7; Telford

OBAN'S controversial Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup-tie against Skye was
finally played before a handful of fans at Perth on Saturday morning.
The game was switched there after the original venue, Spean Bridge, and
the stand-by, Kingussie, both failed pitch inspections.
That left Skye, who earlier in the week had claimed the tie, facing a
marathon four-hour journey to the only playable venue at Perth.
Ironically, Oban's home pitch, Mossfield park, was playable, but the
tie had to be played at a neutral venue, as Oban were stripped of home
advantage following a row with Association officials.
Oban had been found guilty of misleading Camanachd Association
president Duncan Cameron about a previous postponement of the tie.
Oban proved to be by far the sharper outfit and it didn't help Skye
when Ally MacDonald was ordered off in the thirtieth minute and keeper
Calum Nicolson was injured and had to leave the field.
Oban raced to a 4-0 lead at half-time which they never looked like
losing and their reward is a home tie against Beauly on April Fools'
Day.
0 In the north, MacAulay Cup-holders Kingussie crashed to defeat at
the Bught Park against a competent Fort William side who gave their
Badenoch opponents a lesson in finishing.
Fort led by a Victor Smith goal at half-time and added three more in
the second period. Kingussie had David Borthwick sent off for a rash
challenge on Smith.
The Camanachd Association have appointed 24-year-old Niall MacLennan,
a fourth-year student of sport at the University of Strathclyde, as
their first full-time development officer in the north. A former
Lochbroom player, MacLennan takes up his post next month.
Keyline Macaulay Cup. Semi-final -- Fort William 4, Kingussie 0.
Glenmorange Camanachd Cup. Fourth round -- Oban Camanachd 4, Skye 0.
Keyline Macaulay Cup. Second round -- Inveraray 2, Glasgow Mid Argyll
2; Inveraray won 3-2 on penalty play-off.

GRAND prix racing, bull fighting, mountaineering: all are high-risk
sports. Competitors accept they dice with death when they participate.
But athletics?
Less than a year ago, as Peter Cartwright made his bid for victory in
the veterans' 1500 metres championship at the Kelvin Hall, he collapsed,
victim of his second heart attack.
On Saturday, the 52-year-old Falkirk Victoria Harrier was playing
Russian roulette, cross-country style, in the British veterans'
championship on Irvine's Beach Park.
This is the athletics arena in which pacemakers are battery-operated,
as opposed to highly-paid runners who lead the field before dropping
out.
For veterans, life begins at 40 (35 for women -- so much for
equality), and continues with rejuvenation every five years, as they
compete in five-year age bands. Age may load the legs with lead, but
competitive juices flow unabated.
Cartwright spent three days on a cardiac monitor, and two months later
was told to take a treadmill test. In the interim he defied medical
advice, training in secret.
''The test found nothing untoward,'' he said. ''Just as well, I flew
out to the World Veteran championships in Canada the next day, and won
the 10,000m gold medal in my age group.''
On Saturday he finished a modest ninth in the 50-plus age group,
undaunted by the risks. ''No more running -- take up bowls. That was the
medical advice I was given. But what's the point in stopping? It's my
life.''
He competed in the Isle of Man TT, was British sidecar champion, won
seven national go-kart titles and was a former professional footballer
with Crewe Alexandra.
There was committment to a less outrageous degree wherever one looked.
Faced with the prospect of his club being unable to field a team,
Bellahouston's Steve McLean completed the 10,000m course on just 13
days' training after an operation for varicose veins.
Of the 15 UK titles at stake, seven were won by Scots, including the
80-plus crown taken by former world champion Gordon Porteous, of
Maryhill. It was the first time a man of this age had completed the
event, and one 55-year-old and four 70-year-olds finished behind him.
Londoner Barry Atwell (40), won the men's overall crown by two
seconds. Just seven days earlier he completed the English national (for
all ages), seventy-fifth of 1790 finishers, having run the last mile and
a half without shoes.
Teressa Dyer (35) was a predictable winner of her age group. Last
August she was one of Britain's marathon trio at the European
championships in Helsinki. Sshe also holds UK titles at 800m and 3000m.
Inverurie Academy English teacher Colin Youngson, of Metro Aberdeen,
wrote his name into the history books by collecting his third UK 45   title,
having already won marathon and track gold. Winners and leading
Scottish placings:
Men (10,000m). 40+: 1, B Attwell (South London Harriers) 36min 03sec;
2, M Hager 36-04; 3, J Parker (both Tipton) 36-24; 13, A Jenkins

Team: 1, Houghton 24; 2, Irvine 40.
* BOB Greenoak, the SAF secretary, was elected vice chairman of the
British Athletic Federation council at the annual meeting in Birmingham.
His appointment should ensure that Scottish interests, seriously
neglected during the past year, receive higher priority. A scurrilous
letter attacking the BAF treasurer, John Lister, rebounded on the
sender, Martin Evanson. Lister, who bailed the sport out of a crisis,
was re-elected.

LESLIE Deans Racing Club survived a late call-off from John Robson
yesterday at Kirkintilloch, edging out Cambuslang and Shettleston to win
the Scottish six-stage relay title for the fourth time in five years,
writes Doug Gillon.
They emphasised their superiority over alternate stages of three and
six miles, with their B team, containing former London Marathon winner
Allister Hutton, in fourth place.
Falkirk Victoria had Commonwealth 1500m finalist Gary Brown back after
injury, and led on the opening stage, just ahead of Racing Club, but
they faded to finish fourteenth. Defending champions Dundee Hawkhill
were sixth.
Robson, the 1978 Commonwealth 1500m bronze medallist, and still
national record holder, reported a badly stubbed a toe -- he fell over
his young daughter. Ian Brown, called up for first-team duty for the
first time in 16 months, responded by keeping them within five seconds
of Falkirk on the opening stage.
Cambuslang, 22 seconds in arrears, in fourth, then swept to the front,
with Graeme Croll in inspired form. Normally a steeplechaser, but
preparing for his marathon debut in London, he had the fastest time for
the long leg, establishing a 41-second lead. But it was nowhere near
enough.
Scottish 1500m champion Glen Stewart, making his debut team appearance
for Racing, halved the deficit, and when Scott Cohen gave them a lead of
58 seconds, the outcome was a formality.
Kilbarchan's Robert Quinn, who on Saturday makes his UK World
Cross-country debut at Durham, ran effortlessly to record the fastest
time of the day, 15-57, on the short stage. Details:
1, Leslie Deans Racing Club (I Brown 16-32, B Kirkwood 28-10, G
Stewart 16-11, S Cohen 27-36, F McGowan 16-37, D Ross 27-58) 2hr 13min

AN injury which threatens the career of Buckie Thistle defender Mark
Girling overshadowed the latest instalment of Huntly's relentless march
towards the Highland League championship.
Girling suffered a broken leg in Buckie's 2-0 defeat and has already
been told he could be facing 18 weeks in plaster. The injury is in
exactly the same place as one he suffered as a Huntly player two years
ago.
Buckie manager Bob Summers would not comment after the game on the
tackle by Huntly striker Gary Whyte, but Thistle are unhappy that the
player was not red-carded by Aberdeen referee Mike Pocock.
Meanwhile, Leeds United have joined the chase for Huntly striker
Martin Stewart. Manager Howard Wilkinson's chief scout has twice
contacted Huntly and United could be set to make a fresh approach this
week to beat the English signing deadline.
Dunfermline manager Bert Paton was also at Christie Park as Stewart
netted his twenty-fifth goal of the season in the 2-0 victory.
Kenny Taylor, the Cove Rangers manager, gave his side a tongue-lashing
after they struggled to beat lowly Nairn County 1-0. County went down to
Mike Beattie's eighteenth goal of the season.
Lossiemouth prepared for this week's McEwan's North Cup final with a
4-1 win at Clach. Ian Stewart hit a double while Gary Clark and a Gavin
Dearie own goal completed the Lossie scoring before Alan Richardson
netted a consolation.
Fraserburgh recorded their first win at Elgin City in 15 years thanks
to Marino Keith (2) and Keith McRedie in a 3-1 canter after Craig
Stewart had opened for City.
Alan Murray and Cullen Burns netted Wick Academy's first goals in five
games, but they still went down 3-2 at home to Peterhead after goals
from Stuart Mackintosh (2) and Scott Brown.

IN ENGLAND: By STEVE TONGUE
KENNY Dalglish is the last man to pick out individuals for praise, but
if Blackburn do go on to win the Premiership he will know better than
anyone the contribition made by Alan Shearer.
How laughable it seems, in this age of the #7m footballer, that
eyebrows and questions were raised when Dalglish paid Southampton #3.3m
for the Geordie striker in 1992. Saturday's performance in the 2-1 home
victory over Chelsea -- a ridiculously narrow margin in view of
Blackburn's superiority -- emphasised again what a bargain Dalglish
secured, as well as taking Shearer to two more goal-scoring milestones.
Shearer scored his 100th goal in league football and it made him the
first player since Jimmy Greaves more than 30 years ago to reach 30
goals in successive seasons. He hit a ferocious shot into the roof of
the net as Chelsea's goalkeeper Kevin Hitchcock bravely tried to tempt
him into shooting to the right. Just as impressive, however, was the
pass laid first time into the path of Tim Sherwood for Blackburn's
second.
Dalglish had made quiet but decisive use of Jack Walker's cheque book
again in midweek, taking Shearer's former Southampton team-mate Jeff
Kenna for #1.5m. Kenna played at left back against Chelsea, allowing
Graeme Le Saux to push into midfield, where he was a constant threat
against his old club.
Having taken the lead through Mark Stein, Chelsea later looked weary
from the exertions of their European Cup-winners' Cup quarter-final
victory over Brugge. The defeat leaves them only six points above the
relegation places.

Liverpool 2, Manchester United 0
LIVERPOOL dealt a potentially fatal blow to Manchester United's
championship hopes yesterday with a deserved and exultantly-received
Anfield triumph which will have left Blackburn smiles as wide as the
Mersey.
United manager Alex Ferguson's gamble on leaving out #7m man Andy Cole
failed as the defeat left the holders six points behind Blackburn with
just eight games to go.
Jamie Redknapp's first-half opener was no more than Liverpool were
worth after Ferguson's men were clearly second best.
Although United looked more threatening after Cole's half-time
introduction, Steve McManaman finished them off with a shot which
deflected in off Steve Bruce five minutes from time.
Bruce's woes were made even worse with a booking for baulking Redknapp
that means an FA hearing after accumulating 41 points and a likely
four-match ban.
Cole's absence was attributed to a thigh strain picked up in training
-- although not too serious to prevent Ferguson having him on the bench
-- while Mark Wright lined up in Liverpool's defence for the first time
in 12 months.
The game was frenetic as any between these fierce rivals, tackles
flying in and barely a fraction of time allowed on the ball.
''You lost the League on Merseyside,'' chanted the Liverpool fans.
Ferguson's face told how apposite that may be.
''There's no question that this was a disappointing result,'' said
Ferguson. ''It leaves us in a tremendously difficult position, but we
didn't deserve anything more than that.
''Before this week we'd won all the big games. We beat Newcastle at
home, beat Blackburn twice and also had wins over Liverpool and
Tottenham and they had kept us in contention.
''But in the last four days we've drawn with Tottenham and lost today
-- and we needed to win this one.''
Blackburn are now 4-11 favourites to win the Premiership title with
bookmakers William Hill, who have lengthened Manchester United's odds
from 11-10 to 2-1. Newcastle are 25-1, and Liverpool are down to 33-1
from 40-1.
* PETER Beardsley was the Newcastle hero against Arsenal with a
last-minute strike from 25 yards that left keeper Vince Bartram stranded
and gave United a 1-0 victory.
Manager Kevin Keegan said: ''I think that must be the best goal Peter
Beardsley has scored for Newcastle.
''The fact that he works so hard for the team makes him such a great
player.''
''I think we deserved to win as we created enough chances.''

Dundee 3, Clydebank 2
AS is the case in most of the tight finishes in horse racing, first
hand knowledge of the finishing straight can play a major role in
fashioning out the final placings in the frame.
In football, first divison promotion chasers Dundee are looking to
utilise a comparitive scenario in the now five-club race to a winning
post which will signal an assured return to the premier division big
time for one of the quintet.
The Dens Parkers reckon that in vastly-experienced midfielder Ray
Farningham they could hold the key which tips the balance in their
favour, with the 33-year-old something of a course specialist in the
promotion stakes.
Farningham netted his third goal of the season to help ease his Dark
Blues back on top of the table via a narrow 3-2 win over Clydebank on
Saturday.
After it was all over, he confirmed: ''Having been the promotion
course before with Partick, I have first hand knowledge of what the lads
will face to the end of the season. Hopefully some of the younger ones
will get the message on how to avoid some of the pressures.
''I have to say that when I was involved in Thistle's run to promotion
there wasn't the same competition for the prize as there is this time.
There is only one place available this season -- and five of us want it.
''Now that we have regained the top spot in the table we can only lose
it ourselves. We are not planning to do so, and if we can get through
our next two fixtures against Airdrie then Dunfermline unbeaten, then I
will really fancy our chances.''
Saturday's scoreline did little to harm that aim, but the manner by
which it was achieved must have had player-manager Jim Duffy reaching
for the tranquilisers.
The first of George Shaw's vital scoring double early on, ought to
have settled the hosts sufficiently to go on from there and assume
control. They didn't, due mainly to a Bankies attitude which augurs well
for the future at New Kilbowie.
Jim Grady nodded in an equaliser around the half hour mark and, had
the visitors matched their leading up work until the halfway stage with
similar finishing, then a form book upset may have occurred.
However, as those chances were allowed to slip away, Dundee took full
advantage to issue their opponents with scoring lessons from first
Farningham then Shaw as the hosts looked to have wrapped things up
midway through the second period.
But Clydebank refused to lie down and, after Ken Eadie rammed home his
side's second goal in 81 minutes, Dundee's nerve-ends were plugged in
yet again.
In fact the Den Parkers were fortunate not to lose a part of their
points-take during the dying minutes, when a neat three-man move carved
its way through the home defence, only for Grady to ruin things with a
slack finish.
Also blotting his copy book was Eadie, who looks certain to sit out
Clydebank's late drive away from the relegation zone due to suspension.

JUNIORS
ONLY two of the OVD Cup quarter-final ties beat the weather at the
weekend.
There was mixed fortunes on Tayside with the much- fancied Tayport
going out to goals by Whitburn's Keith Jardine and Paul Taylor. The
second goal following shortly after the dismissal of Tayport centre-half
Sommerville for a double booking.
Surprise result was Lochee United's 1-0 victory over 1990 winners Hill
O'Beath.
The young Lochee team -- seven players under 23 -- went ahead in the
thirty-fifth minute with a headed goal by Mitchell and deservedly
progressed to the semis.
Glenafton's tie with Arthurlie was called off and Camelon's game
against Kilwinning fell victim of the worsening conditions just 30
minutes before kick-off. Glenafton, hoping to reach their fourth
successive semi-final, will try again next week as will Kilwinning,
whose manager, Jim McSherry, was not too disappointed with the
postponement. The extra week will give his players Sloan and Wilson a
chance to shake off their injuries.
The semi-finals will be played on April 27 and 28 at venues to be
arranged, but with Lochee already through, a Tayside venue could well be
an option.
The final will be played on May 21 at Fir Park, Motherwell.
In the east section of the Whyte &amp; MacKay Cup, Bo'ness and St Andrews
reached the semis where they will be joined by the winners of next
week's Linlithgow v Hill o' Beath tie and the winners of Arniston v
Camelon.
Hat tricks were the order of the day in the North region. Barry Grant
of Sunnybank, scored all three goals in the 3-1 victory over Turriff in
the GNT Cup. Willie McFarlane, a second half substitute for Banks o'
Dee, scored three goals in six minutes against Hermes.
Sunnybank will now meet Banks o' Dee in the semi- final. The other tie
will be between Stoneywood and Buckie or Forres. Games are due to be
played on April 14.
In Tayside, St Joseph's reached the final of the PA Advertiser Cup
with a 3-1 away victory over Elmwood. The other semi between Jeanfield
and Forfar West End will be played next Saturday and the final at
McDiarmid Park on April 11.
Scone Thistle's 2-1 victory over Bankfoot leaves them needing three
points from their last four games to win the AT &amp; T Division Two title.
Dalry Thistle have until next week to decide if they will appeal
against their ban from next season's OVD Cup.
The Thorniewood United v Forth Wanderers MBM Cup tie was stopped from
going ahead on Saturday after Shotts Bon Accord served an interim
interdict on the Central Region. The legal action could put Shotts in
further trouble.
Benburb have reinstated ex-player Paul Diamond from Partick Thistle.
Junior Scotland manager Denis Gray will this week announce his pool of

Raith Rovers 1, Stranraer 1
THEY say that God works in mysterious ways, his wonders to perform. If
that is the case, then be prepared for even more miraculous happenings
at Stark's Park this season following the acquisition by Raith Rovers of
Trinidad and Tobago internationalist Tony Rougier, who clearly feels he
has arrived at Kirkcaldy as part of some divine mission.
''God has sent me here,'' said Rougier, at the end of his Scottish
footballing debut for the Kirkcaldy side against Stranraer on Saturday.
''Tony Rougier and Raith Rovers will succeed.''
It was a highly impressive introduction to the Scottish game for the
talented Rougier, with the only flaw in the script being the
intransigence shown by his defensive team-mates in allowing Stranraer
striker Steve Cody through eight minutes from time to record an unlikely
equaliser which cancelled out Gordon Dalziel's first half strike.
The resultant draw has knocked a severe dent in Rovers' promotion
hopes, but the introduction of Rougier has indicated that a strong
finish to the season appears likely.
''The gaffer has shown great faith in me,'' continued Rougier,
displaying a remarkable grasp of Scottish vernacular. ''I was happy with
my performance, but it would have been better had we picked up three
points.
''I'll just take things one day at a time, but I'm sure I can do well
in Scottish football.''
Rougier, capped 40 times for Trinidad and Tobago, also referred to the
pace of the game in this country, not to mention the climate, both of
which are factors which contrast with the different environment in his
Caribbean homeland but, like his countryman Jerren Nixon of Dundee
United, he looks to possess sufficient natural ability to overcome such
obstacles.
As well as providing a constant threat to the Stranraer defence
throughout the game, Rogier set up the opening goal for Dalziel in 17
minutes, the veteran striker heading home the West Indian's precise
cross to record his eighteenth goal of the season.
But the Raith forwards were unable to add to their lead, despite
intense territorial supremacy and the price of their ineptitude was paid
in the closing stages when Cody fired his shot past Scott Thomson for
the equaliser.
Six Stranraer players were yellow-carded during an untidy 90 minutes,
mostly as a result of crude efforts to harness the skills of Rougier,
while their captain, Jim Hughes, was ordered off near the end for a
second bookable offence.
Raith, who have now gone 11 league games without defeat, move into
second place in the first division, two points behind leaders Dundee and
one point ahead of Fife neighbours, Dunfermline.
Stranraer, meanwhile, remain anchored at the foot of the table and a
swift return to the second division now appears inevitable for Alex
McAnespie's men.

ALEX MacDonald seems to have the Midas touch when it comes to making
substitutions, and the men coming off the bench don't do too badly,
either.
Airdrie's recognised super-sub this season has been Andy Smith, and
his 20 goals so far are testimony to that. But one man who most
certainly does not want to inherit that title is Alan Lawrence.
Occasionally during this campaign, it has been Lawrence who has been
asked to make way for Smith -- either from the start or during the game.
On Saturday, against Ayr United at Somerset Park, Smith was on from
the start with Lawrence sitting it out. But he replaced John Davies
after 58 minutes of a dreadful match, almost scored right away and then
hit both his side's goals, in the last minute and in injury time.
Lawrence said afterwards: ''Maybe I'll be labelled as a super-sub --
that's the last thing you want.''
But he still praised manager MacDonald, saying: ''The manager tells
the players they are being brought on to benefit the team, and so far he
has been proved right.''
As for the goals, if they had not been so vital for Airdrie's
promotion push and so devastating for an Ayr side fighting for first
division survival, they would have been committed to a joke book as far
as Ayr's defence was concerned.
When McKilligan completely fluffed an attempted pass-back to keeper
Cammy Duncan in the last minute, Lawrence lived up to his nickname of
''Nipper.'' He sped through to stab the ball past Duncan before the
keeper knew what had hit him. The second goal was an absolute dream, if
you were an Airdrie supporter, but a nightmare for those sporting
black-and-white favours.
For reasons best known to himself, Duncan -- despite carrying a knee
injury -- ran almost 40 yards to try to clear an Airdrie surge. He was
outflanked by two Airdrie players, robbed of the ball, and as the Ayr
defence tried to protect an empty goalmouth, Lawrence chipped the ball
all the way into the back of his net for his thirteenth strike of the
season.
Lawrence joked: ''That was with my left peg. When we are practising at
training, I call it the pitching wedge -- I can only do it in heavy
going. ''
MacDonald admitted later: ''That was an awful game. We did not play
well, the Ayr lads put in a lot of effort, yet we came away with the
points.
''There is no question that there was a reaction from last week's cup
victory at Kirkcaldy, but I don't think that's good professionalism. It
does not matter to me where I'm playing, I play to win.
''However, I'm not going over the top at them. We came down here and
got the points. We meet Dundee next week and there will be a good
atmosphere.'' As an afterthought, he added: ''Taking the points with a
performance like that -- tell you what -- I'm going to put money on us
winning the league.''

Ayr United 0, Airdrie 2
SIMON Stainrod was hurting around 4.45 on Saturday evening -- and it
had nothing to do with a strained hamstring that forced him to come off
20 minutes from the end of this defeat by Airdrie at Somerset Park.
It was just as well that the normally suave Ayr United manager was not
wearing his trademark fedora as he blew his top after the final whistle.
He admitted quite openly that, after having watched his team lose both
goals in the last minute and then injury time, he ended up ''smashing
lights in the dressing room and kicking drinks all over the floor. That
defeat was totally unnecessary, just amateurism. Do these players want
to be professional footballers?''
Stainrod's frustration, and that of some of his team -- many of whom
just slumped in sheer dejection on to the turf after a defensive howler
by Neil McKilligan had let Airdrie substitute Alan Lawrence through to
score the first goal -- was totally justifed.
As well as restructuring the dressing room ceiling and floor, Stainrod
did not swing at his two front men, Brian Bilsland and Justin Jackson,
and hit the wall.
''The front two let us down badly. They didn't hold the ball up, and
never took responsibility to go and try to score a goal. With all the
pressure we had, you'd think it would be great to play up front.
Instead, you just did not notice them. They never had a shot at goal.
''In the first 45 minutes I had to go back into my own half only
twice. After the interval, we still played quite well, but to give away
two goals like that is ridiculous. The second goal does not really
matter too much, but the first one was incredible.''
Stainrod went on to point out that because keeper Cammy Duncan had a
knee problem, instructions were given at half time not to pass the ball
back to him -- which is precisely what McKilligan tried in the last
minute, and made a hash of it, allowing Lawrence the chance.
''At that stage of a game, the ball should just be cleared anywhere.
Neil will feel terrible tonight, and rightly so. It was a ridiculous
mistake. But by that time, after the way we had played, we should have
been far enough ahead for it not to matter.
''A point would have been fine. All right, we may not have scored, but
we'd not have given any goals away either. We could have built on
that.''
That first goal was costly in more ways than one. For, as the Ayr
defence vainly tried to make up for McKilligan's slip and catch
Lawrence, classy midfielder Frank Rolling went tumbling and eventually
had to be stretchered off in agony with a dislocated shoulder which will
keep him out for four weeks at least.
In Ayr's perilous position in second bottom spot in the table, they
can hardly afford that either, especially since Stainrod -- who had been
the midfield maestro, regularly frustrating his Airdrie counterparts, as
well as proving deadly accurate with service from set-pieces -- also
will be missing for at least three weeks.
''I was enjoying the game, and now all this. It's going to take a bit
of sorting out,'' he added. One piece of good news, though, is that it
is certain the ''injured'' dressing room will be fit and available for
selection at Ayr's next home match. That will be against Raith Rovers
on, wait for it, April Fools' Day.

Hearts 2, Rangers 1
RANGERS are into one of their end-of-the-season nail-biting acts once
again. It's only a couple of weeks since skipper Richard Gough insisted
that the players wanted to clinch their seventh successive title in
style . . . but the script is not working out that way.
Hearts, who knocked the Ibrox men out of the Scottish Cup last month,
followed up with a victory in the league on Saturday. Now Rangers are
just 12 points clear of Motherwell -- and even that lead could be
whittled down a little more in midweek when the Fir Park men go to
Easter Road to face Hibs.
It does not take a genius to work out some of what has gone wrong with
the champions. You look at the injury list -- there was Trevor Steven
taking that familiar limp to the touchline once more at Tynecasle -- and
you recognise where manager Walter Smith's problems lie.
There is, however, a rather more worrying aspect to the dangerous form
slump than the bare statistics of a lengthy and damaging injury list.
Every top manager I have known over the years has insisted on having
the spine of the team right. From Stein and Shankly and Revie, through
Jim McLean and Alex Ferguson.
When Graeme Souness and Walter Smith arrived at Ibrox their first
transfer moves re-affirmed that belief.
Rangers are now playing without that vital component.
The importance of Andy Goram, Smith's first signing as manager, has
never been more apparent. His deputy, Ally Maxwell, is suffering a
kamikaze run which has seen him gifting goals to the opposition in match
after match.
His form has been so bad that at Tynecastle -- where he blundered
again to compound his mistakes in the cup clash -- he was booed by his
own supporters.
The uncertainty has spread from Maxwell to the men in front of him.
The defence, so sure of Goram's ability, are now riven by doubts. It is
quite clear they have no faith in their stand-in keeper.
Up front, Gordon Durie, never an orthodox out-and-out striker, is on
his own because of the injuries and suspensions which have limited
Smith's choice throughout the season.
Those who say Smith should simply go out and buy another keeper are
taking a simplistic view of the Ibrox scenario, which still says Goram
will be back fully fit by the start of the new season. Who is going to
go to Ibrox to be second pick to the best keeper in Britain?
The only way out of the impasse is for Smith to try to persuade a
class keeper to come with the promise that he will be allowed to move on
if Goram reclaims his place.
These, though, are Rangers' problems. The worries facing Hearts
manager Tommy McLean are considerably fewer. His team is in the Scotish
Cup semi-final and, while caution dictates that McLean will still be
concerned over the thought of relegation, the reality is that they sit
now just one point behind Celtic.
After the game, McLean admitted: ''I am absolutely delighted with this
win and the way it was achieved.
''There is still work to be done, but we are making real progress. We
have brought in new players and they are settling, but we still
recognise that if we are to mount a real challenge we will have to add
quality players to the staff.
''But today I was very happy with the way John Robertson played before
he was injured. He made a tremendous contribution, particularly in the
first half.''
The little striker scored the first goal and John Millar added the
second before Brian Laudrup's spectacular strike hauled one back for
Rangers just before half-time.
It was Laudrup's goal which brought praise from the Hearts players
afterwards. Robertson, his knee heavily bandaged, was fulsome in his
praise for the Danish internationalist.
The Hearts striker said: ''Laudrup is the finest player I have ever
seen in Scottish football. He is a genius and is just on a different
planet from the rest of us.''
On his injury Robertson added: ''I don't blame Alex Cleland for the
injury at all. It was just one of those tackles and it was not his
fault. At the moment the knee is heavily bruised, but I don't think
there is any ligament damage I should be playing in the semi-final
against Airdrie OK.''
Robertson could also find himself playing in the Hampden final. This
Hearts' team has a resilience and a degree of skill from players such as
Stephen Frail and Jim Bett which suggests that McLean could find himself
back at Hampden this season.

DIVISION TWO
STENHOUSEMUIR'S season is turning a bit sour. With their cup run
ended, the 3-1 defeat at Stirling means they have conceded 12 goals in
three games and dropped to fourth place, writes Bill Sutherland.
But the Warriors need not press the panic button just yet as they have
home games this week against Queen of the South tomorrow and Brechin on
Saturday.
Willie Watters inspired Stirling's victory, scoring twice after having
set up Joe McLeod to open. Adrian Sprott scored for 'Muir just before
Stirling's third.
Morton salvaged a point at Brechin when Marko Rajamaki's last-minute
volley equalised Ralph Brand's goal. John Cusick gave East Fife a brief
lead at Broadwood but Ian Nisbet hooked in Clyde's equaliser.
Stewart Williamson's late goal at Dumfries gave Meadowbank a 3-2 win
and some hope that they might yet overhaul their hosts, Queen of the
South.

DIVISION THREE
ARBROATH'S fine run since John Brogan became manager continued at the
weekend with a 2-1 victory over promotion-chasing Alloa, writes Bill
Sutherland.
That victory means they have followed an initial draw with six
straight wins. Iain Porteous and Steve Tosh were their marksmen, with
Danny Diver scoring late on for Alloa.
Hugh McCann enjoyed his second straight win since he took charge of
Queen's Park. Brian McPhee and Steve McCormack, with a double, were the
scorers in the 3-1 victory over Cowdenbeath, for whom Armando de Mello
replied. Queen's host Arbroath next Saturday.
David Bingham took his goals tally for the season to 17, hitting a hat
trick for leaders Forfar in the 4-1 defeat of Caley Thistle. Bobby Mann
headed their first goal and John Scott converted a late penalty for the
Highlanders.

JOHAN Cruyff, faced with the possibility of failing to win a trophy
for the first season ever as a player or coach with Barcelona, said
yesterday he was considering his future at the Nou Camp.
His disclosure came at the end of a turbulent week in which Barcelona
were defeated by Paris St Germain in the quarter-finals of the
Champions' Cup and their Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov suspended
for criticising Cruyff's regime.
In the bitter recriminations which followed the loss in Paris,
Stoichkov hit out at the inclusion of Cruyff's son Jordi in the team.
''He has no right at all to be in the team,'' he insisted. ''The only
reason for being there is because of who he is, not what he is. He could
not live in my shadow.
''I am being made the scapegoat to divert attention from this defeat.
It was always my intention to renew my contract and end my career with
Barcelona. I still want to stay, but it seems that Cruyff and some of
the players don't want me any longer. If that is the case, I will
consider other options.''
Cruyff, who imposed a two-week ban on his wayward star, said:
''Whether he ever comes back to play again depends on his attitude.
Frankly, his behaviour sickens me.
''I thought I had changed the atmosphere at this club in the past
seven years but, sadly, this does not seem to be the case.
''I will examine the entire situation on June 30. If there is no
improvement, I will leave.''
Cruyff was supported in his punishment of Stoichkov by his countryman
Ronald Koeman, who added: ''All the players are sick and tired of his
antics. He has no respect for his colleagues. His only concerns are
himself and money.''
* TROUBLED times, too, for controversial South American stars, Romario
and Maradona.
The Brazilian's wife, Monica, is claiming #2.8m in her divorce action,
along with maintenance of #30,000 per month. But this is just the start
of problems. Spanish ballerina Sonia Monroig has raised a paternity suit
against him, while Brazilian model Andrea de Oliveira is suing for
defamation of character.
Maradona, coach at first division Racing, has been fined #2000 and
suspended for 16 matches for throwing water at a linesman.
* BAYERN Munich president Franz Beckenbauer has suffered rare public
criticism for withdrawing players' bonuses following last week's 1-1
draw against MSV Duisburg.
Beckenbauer, who said it was the worst performance he had ever seen
from a Bayern team, was sharply reminded by international defender
Thomas Helmer of the day he captained the club in a 7-0 defeat by
Schalke 04.
''Our president has a short memory,'' said Helmer. ''Bonuses are part
of our salaries. His actions are those of a dictator.''
* GIANLUCA Vialli's spectacular overhead kick gave Juventus a 1-0 win
over Cremonese on Sunday as the Italian league leaders took advantage of
second-place Parma's 2-2 draw at Reggiana to open a six-point gap at the
top.
Vialli's twelfth goal of the season followed a pinpoint Roberto Baggio
cross in the seventy-second minute and broke stubborn resistance.
Revitalised champions AC Milan lie a distant third after a 3-0 victory
at Sampdoria. Marco Simone set Milan on the way, before Demetrio
Albertini clinched victory with a seventy-first minute free kick and a
last-minute penalty.

As the spectre of relegation hangs over Pittodrie, SARAH NELSON
describes a Dons fan's feeling of helplessness
SO, what does it feel like to be a loyal Aberdeen fan?
It feels appalling, obviously. Worst of all, my fickle child is
swopping her allegiance. I scream with demented exaggeration: ''Our
family's supported them for 300 years!''
''All the boys laugh,'' she sighs. ''Aberdeen, Aberdeen, cannae kick a
jelly bean.''
But it's a serious question, the real looming possibility of
relegation, with several serious answers. Aberdeen fans feel a total,
bewildered unpreparedness, not so much for venturing into Kilbowie but
for accepting psychologically what that means; because it's a proud and
unusual history for the team you support to have never experienced the
drop in 92 years.
We feel unsupported, I suspect, because many other football followers
dislike Aberdeen and wish them less than well, not least from jealousy
at their recent monopoly-breaking record, and from central belt
self-obsession and bruised vanities.
Gleeful malice seems strange and alien to most north-easterners, who
only feel that way about the Old Firm through decades of put-downs. They
can't understand the single-minded ill-will between, for instance, many
followers of Hearts and Hibs. John Colquhoun once recalled how
astonished visiting teams felt when Dons fans politely clapped their
good moves.
It hardly seems good for the game when any proud well-supported side
which has contributed much in Scotland and internationally -- whether
that side is Aberdeen or any other -- falls into decline; and many
Scottish fans (not least those of Celtic) should have plenty of
fellow-feeling.
At the same time, the idea that the league set-up should be changed
like lightning to spare big clubs embarrassment seems quite wrong, a
further humiliation and another sharp reflection on the values of the
modern football business.
Many Aberdeen fans -- who can at least take pride in their remarkable
loyalty this season -- still feel highly confused about what has gone
wrong with the club. Pained and bewildered at the ignominy of their
greatest hero, they have flailed angrily about with more emotion than
rational thought.
After all, it seems unreal. The city is still booming; go past
Pittodrie and everything looks great, the massive, rearing Dick Donald
Stand like a culmination of recent glorious effort at home and abroad.
Yet there is nothing in it but demoralisation and the ghosts of
Strachan, Black, McMaster, McGhee, even the erstwhile Jess and Booth.
It felt unbelievable to visit the Dons Shop last week and find the
sycophantic Pittodrie Profile magazine still prattling on as if nothing
was wrong, and a new, cheery Aberdeen Angus bull logo blazing
pugnaciously from the merchandise. A symbol that means nothing -- unlike
the highly popular sheep? -- to any Dons fan from eight to 80. Who, one
wonders, consulted them?
These are merely further signs of a gradual, deep-seated malaise which
needs root and branch confrontation, not the odd change of face or
purchase of a few new players. When this is coupled with important
failures of judgment the major source of the malaise seems hard to
avoid. To dismiss a manager too late and then to carry on with the same
regime instead of begging or borrowing the cash for radical change
betrayed basic misjudgment; Jimmy Nicholl, for instance, may well sail
upwards with Raith as the Dons dip downwards. How tempting would a
belated offer seem to him then?
Every Dons fan still hopes the team will find the strength and will to
avoid the drop.
If we want our club back with the kind of soul it had before, and
people of vision and judgment to lead it, this will not happen without a
clear-minded campaign untramelled by wishful thinking about our heroes,
or short-sighted blaming of players who are themselves only cogs in the
machine.
The supporters and campaigners of Hibernian may have important lessons
to teach at the moment. Most people have forgotten how recently this
historic club faced extinction. We should not be too proud to consult
those wiser ones among them who are not still childishly cat-calling
''Stenhousemuir'' each time we totter woefully across their path.

Aberdeen 0, Hibernian 0
JIM Leighton, an Aberdeen hero in the finest period of the club's
history, turned villain with an outstanding performance for Hibs to deny
the Dons three points during the worst period in their history.
Aberdeen showed the kind of commitment and determination which could
keep them in the premier division next season but were still unable to
beat the visitors to Pittodrie who turned in a lacklustre display.
The Aberdeen players gave the impression that they now realise the
gravity of their position and battled for everything, totally dominating
the play. In 34 minutes substitute Dons' keeper Michael Watt had to come
on for Theo Snelders who was taken to hospital for a foot X-ray after a
clash with Willie Miller but Watt was seldom tested by Hibs. The X-ray
revealed that Snelders' foot was only badly bruised.
At the other end, Leighton's acrobatics, reflexes, and the woodwork
saved Hibs repeatedly.
Peter Hetherston was included in the starting line-up for the first
time this year and was influential, and back in the Aberdeen side after
injury were Paul Kane, and John Inglis. Duncan Shearer also returned to
the team as Ray McKinnon, Brian Irvine, Scott Thomson, and Stephen Glass
were left out as Aitken searches for a combination which will hoist
Aberdeen clear of the relegation zone.
In the Hibs midfield, Pat McGinlay returned after a two-match
suspension in favour of David Farrell who was on the bench.
Hibs had a clear opportunity to take the lead in just 90 seconds when
Joe Tortolano sent Keith Wright clear on the left.
Snelders was the only man in his way but he managed to get a touch to
Wright's lob to steer it out for a corner. From then on Aberdeen took
control and in spite of numerous shots, and occasional good passing
movements, couldn't find a way past Leighton.
The addition of Hetherston made a significant difference to the
recently lethargic and ineffective midfield. He was unlucky not to score
twice in the first half with long-range shots.
The most remarkable save by Leighton came after 71 minutes just after
Eoin Jess had replaced Billy Dodds in attack. Jess crossed to Shearer,
who laid the ball back to Kane. He mis-kicked and the ball hit defender
Steven Tweed, changed direction, and looked certain to curl over
Leighton into the net. However, the keeper managed to get a touch to
give away a corner.
''I think Jim showed his class today and he had two saves which defied
logic,'' said his manager, Alex Miller, who had little praise for the
performance of the rest of the team.
''I'm disappointed. Our performance was poor. We had a good chance in
the first minute and, if we had scored then, it might have been
different but I felt Aberdeen were the better team.''
He admitted he was bitterly disappointed with his club's away form.
They have lost only one league game at Easter Road but won only once
away from home scoring just six goals, less than a fifth of their home
total.
Miller confirmed that he hopes to strengthen his squad to insure
against injuries or suspensions as his side looks forward to a Scottish
Cup semi-final and a fight for a place in Europe by signing Andy Millen
today in a swop deal that will take Billy Findlay to Kilmarnock.
Aberdeen caretaker manager Roy Aitken was in buoyant mood after the
best display by the team since he took over.
''I was delighted with the performance. We totally dominated the match
but not to get the three points was frustrating,'' he said.
He hopes the players will now achieve the consistency they showed
throughout the match from game to game.
''If we perform like that on a regular basis we will get out of the
position we are in. Leighton was probably the difference between the
teams today. He had some outstanding saves.''

Motherwell 2, Dundee United 1
MOTHERWELL manager Alex McLeish is about to come under severe pressure
-- from one of his own players. As the Fir Park side bid to keep some
life in the race for the premier division championship, striker Alex
Burns is determined to force McLeish into extending his run in the first
team.
The youngster, whose contract is up at the end of the season, thought
he was on his way out of Fir Park just a few weeks ago after having
managed just 10 first-team appearances in almost two seasons, but when
top-scorer Tommy Coyne was injured and Paul McGrillen and Steve Kirk
were sold to Falkirk, Burns found himself back in favour.
He played his sixth successive match at Fir Park on Saturday and
brought his goal tally for the season to six when he opened the scoring
against Dundee United after 54 minutes with an intelligent back-header.
Striking partner Dougie Arnott added the second two minutes later, and
although a Maurice Malpas goal set up a nervous final 20 minutes for
Motherwell, the Burns-Arnott combination proved a winner.
Now, however, Coyne is almost ready to return and McLeish has made no
secret of the fact that he hopes to sign a striker from the Continent
before the transfer deadline at the end of the month, and that will only
provide a further spur for Burns.
The striker said: ''There was a time when I thought I might have to
leave Fir Park when my contract was up, but I would be delighted to stay
at Motherwell. I couldn't be at a bigger club, apart from Rangers, and
that's because of their spending power.
''It's now up to me to put pressure on Alex to keep me in the team and
I can do that by continuing to score. We all want to be in the side and
we want that second place in the league -- maybe even first place, if
Rangers continue to drop points. Motherwell always seem to play well in
the last quarter of the season, so if we keep going it will keep Rangers
on their toes.''
McLeish was, quite rightly, ''delighted by the overall performance,''
but none too happy with the way his players responded after having gone
ahead. He said: ''I thought we totally dominated the match until we went
2-0 up -- their goalkeeper, Kelham O'Hanlon, had to make some tremendous
saves to keep them in it. But my players then tried to sit on the lead
and we had to suffer a nervous finish after they scored.''
United, fighting a battle against relegation, took a long time to get
their act together and it looked as if they were suffering a hangover
from a rather traumatic week in which they lost their hold on the
Scottish Cup and their manager, Ivan Golac, was shown the Tannadice
door.
''It's been a week of turmoil at the club,'' said Malpas. ''Losing in
the cup to Hearts was the bigger downer, but losing the manager didn't
help matters. However, this is not the time to panic. It's a case of
battling out of it and all we need is a couple of good results.
''It's up to the senior professionals at the club. Players like
myself, Jim McInally, and Dave Bowman have to help the younger lads
through this.''
Gordon Wallace, one of the men left in charge after Golac's departure,
said: ''Two minutes of madness cost us the match. We were holding it
well -- you could tell that when the Motherwell fans booed their side of
the park at half time. What we needed was another 15 minutes like that
at the start of the second half, but we lost two bad goals.''
Indeed, something in the air seems to be upsetting United these days.
They lost two goals against Hearts to headers, and it was the same at
Fir Park. First, Burns showed great awareness when a Brian Martin cross
came over. The youngster spotted O'Hanlon off his line and sent a
looping back header over the keeper. Two minutes later, Arnott sprinted
through the defence to head home a Paul Lambert free kick.
It was all uphill for United after that, although Malpas did give them
some hope when he notched his third goal of the season after 65 minutes.
Motherwell, however, held on and deserved the three points.
The Motherwell midfield, with Jamie Dolan and Lambert dominating, were
much more positive, and the fact that O'Hanlon was probably United's
best player, while his opposite number, Stevie Woods, had a
comparatively quite afternoon, is an accurate guide as to how the game
unfolded.
Another pleasing aspect for the Fir Park fans and their manager must
have been the performance of Stephen McMillan, who was drafted into the
side after left back Rob McKinnon had failed a fitness test.
The youngster, who had made only two substitute appearances this
season -- against Havnar, of the Faroe Islands, and Celtic -- slotted
into the defence as if he had been a regular. He certainly didn't look
out of place and looks to be yet another product from Fir Park who is
set for a bright future.

WHAT an excellent picture in The Herald's sports section of Scotland's
try scorers in the rugby international against Wales. Although based in
the South, they looked just grand in their kilts.
However, it was spoiled for me by the fact that they were holding two
tankards of beer. Not that I grudge them this way of celebrating if that
is how they want to do it. I just wonder if the idea came from the
photographer? I have always understood that alcohol and physical fitness
don't mix, and I hazard that it did not figure in the team's preparation
for the game at Twickenham.
My main objection is that it sets a bad example to the many boys and
young people who make heroes of the top players. One of the problems
frequently reported in the media these days is the great increase in
under-age drinking.
One report last week gave evidence of schoolchildren as young as eight
years old having a can of beer every day, and it being quite common for
older children to become drunk on occasions.
With alcoholism being recognised as a serious matter in our society,
we should not be encouraging the drinking habit. For the same reason I
deprecate the use of brewers as team sponsors, and it is irresponsible,
in my view, to see youngsters providing advertisements for the drink
trade by wearing their team outfits. Do I have any support for this view
or am I a voice in the wilderness?
Rev J Murdoch,

Second-rate
commentator
WHAT a relief and delight it was to have a decent commentator for the
match between Chelsea and Brugge the other night. Barry Davies must
surely be the best in his profession. He is certainly superior to what
we have to endure in Scotland.
The contrast between his commentary and that from Tynecastle last
Sunday is extremely marked. One wonders whether Jock Brown is paid by
the word or if he just likes the sound of his own voice.
His excessive chatter is extremely irritating and invariably results
in a dash for the volume control to turn it off. Unfortunately, it was
left on for the Scottish Cup game.
Does Jock Brown think that the viewing public is obtuse and blind? Are
we incapable of making simple observations? If he feels the need to
describe every action in graphic detail then the BBC should transfer him
to the radio where his undoubted verbal talents would be better
utilised.

Keeping the
dream alive
WHAT a sensible decision of The Herald and the Scottish School's
Football Association to, as Barclay McBain put it, 'keep the Hampden
dream' for all the semi-finalists in the Herald-sponsored seven-a-side
competition due to take place last week before the Scotland-Brazil game
at the national stadium.
It is one, I am sure the rest of the zealous young footballers of the
nation would support.
Feelings are important, and it would appear that those of the
participants, their schools, and their parents have been recognised.
Atrocious pre-match weather conditions, causing the unavoidable
postponement, could not have been controlled by any party involved.
The thinking behind 'coming to Hampden on another day' -- or the like
if this is totally impossible, is one that keeps alive that once in a
lifetime dream when the children from Hamilton, East Kilbride, Peebles,
and Dumbarton can truly say in later life to their grandchildren -- ''We
were there.''
Mr J Walker,

Ban young
hecklers
DURING the recent Scotland international rugby match at Murrayfield,
we were subjected to the usual cacophony as the Welsh fly-half was
preparing to kick at goal.
This was in complete contrast to the silence during Gavin Hastings'
attempts.
What has happened to Scottish sportsmanship at rugby matches?
Most of the noise seems to emanate from the seats occupied by
youngsters of school age.
In my opinion, therefore, the answer lies with the SRU. Tickets should
be issued to schools and clubs with a warning that there should be
silence during all kicks at goal and any offenders need not apply for
tickets in the future.
A neutral spectator at Murrayfield would be forgiven for thinking he
had strayed into Parc des Princes by mistake.
R T Glendinning,
3 Bourtree Park,

Sporting
also-rans
THE dramatic reduction of participants and spectators is the most
obvious indicator of the demise of sport in Scotland.
The factors contributing to this malaise are widely recognised and
while those such as other attractions, increasing admission costs, and
poorer standards are the most significant, there is one which receives
little recognition or attention.
Over the years teachers of physical education, and many other
teachers, have contributed immeasurable amounts of time to organising
and coaching endless numbers of teams as well as individuals in a
variety of activities.
The fact that this priceless input has been severely diminished is
nothing short of scandalous.
Despite attempts to improve the situation, most notably in rugby where
the Scottish Rugby Union has promoted the sport among youngsters,
equality of opportunity has been sadly diminished.
PE teachers and teachers in general have had to suffer criticism from
various quarters, including the media and certain politicians dating
back to and beyond George Younger's time as Scottish Education Minister,
for eventually opting out of extra-curricular activities.
Low pay awards, increased administrative tasks, and, perhaps in recent
years, a less practical oriented training have contributed to less input
from specialist staff.
Unfortunately, until this situation is rectified to create a more
realistic balance, Scotland will continue to be a nation of also-rans in
the sporting arena.

30 Athlestane Drive,
Cumbernauld.
Ahead of
the rest
SOME time ago, I wrote to chastise you for your presentation of the
sports columns. Now, I am very happy to give you my congratulations.
Those little headings at the top of each column -- so simple -- yet so
effective, make all the difference. I now know which sport I'm reading.

IN 1956 an enthusiastic Irishman made the journey to Cheltenham for
the ''World Cup'' of National Hunt racing with six friends. He's been
back every year since but last week he took over a hotel -- with 500
rooms. Such is the popularity of the week of legendary revelry.
Cheltenham, a genteel spa town nestling beneath Cleeve Hill in the
Cotswolds, has rarely featured in the news, apart from its proximity to
GCHQ and the controversy over the selection of a Tory candidate some
years ago. But once a year it takes on a whole new personality, as
thousands converge from all over the world.
The bulk of them are Irish, although many Scots make the pilgrimage
south. Racing may be the main event, but sideshows include nights of
drinking and poker and, of course, unsurpassed banter.
Whole villages across the Irish Sea virtually close down for the week,
even exam timetables are changed to allow children to see their fathers'
horses compete. Punters save up from one year to the next to invest in
their favourites. Win or lose, the Irish enjoy themselves. The roar as
an Irish horse stays on up the infamous finishing hill to beat an
English rival could probably be heard in Dublin.
However, there is some kind of masochism involved here. For, although
there may be kudos in boasting of the number of winners you have at the
Festival, it's about as easy to come out of it ahead as it is to beat
Damon Hill in a Lada. The best horses are all there and so the choice is
infinitely more difficult than at a small meeting in Ayr or Naas.
As ever, there are hard luck stories and tales of unbelievable luck.
The amounts bet at the meeting are of staggering proportions. Last
Wednesday, one of the Irish ''bankers'' of the festival, Harcon, ran in
the Sun Alliance Chase. Two bets of #40,000 to win #70,000 were laid as
well as many only slightly less, but the dream faded on the way to the
line and the horse ended up second.
Not a night for celebration you might think, but as one Irish trainer
said: ''If my horse wins, I'll be drinking champagne, and if it loses,
I'll be drinking more champagne.''
The main event of the meeting, the Gold Cup, was won by Master Oats,
ridden by yet another Irish jockey, Norman Williamson, or Stormin' as
he's known, who also rode the most winners. But Master Oats' owner is no
traditional camel-coated purist. Indeed, he says he wouldn't know a good
horse from an elephant and instead of agonising over his racing colours
for months, chose them from a beer pump in front of him on the spur of
the moment.
Traditionally, the festival lasts for three days, but this year there
was also racing on Friday to coincide with St Patrick's Day and Comic
Relief's Red Nose Day. There were many there who wouldn't have needed a
plastic replica for their nose to be red. Hangovers at Cheltenham are
nearly as legendary as the horses and many of the visitors have only a
passing acquaintance with their hotel rooms. The Queen's, in the centre
of the town, is the hub of much of the jollity, yet for 51 weeks of the
year it doesn't stock Guinness. Mind you, in one week it probably sells
more than most other hotels sell in a year.
It's not just those who make the journey to Gloucestershire who have a
part to play. Punters invent all kinds of ploys to watch the Gold Cup,
the Arkle, and the Triumph Hurdle. One intrepid punter, claiming brownie
points on the domestic front, took his toddler out, supposedly for a
walk in her pushchair. He then headed for a tolerant bookmaker who shut
his eyes to the presence of young children. A pleasant afternoon was
spent backing the occasional winner and frequent losers. All was well
until the child told her mother that she'd spent her time in a cafe with
no juice. Not so many brownie points then, I fear.
Amid the celebrations this year, the festival was tinged with sadness
when Irish jockey Adrian Maguire decided to withdraw following the death
of his mother. Last Wednesday three of the horses he was due to ride
were winners and trainer David Nicholson was close to tears as he said:
''I feel so sorry for Adrian. He has done all the hard work and then
wasn't able to gain the glory.''
After the excesses of last week, many have gone home with empty
pockets but plenty of tales to recount. They'll save up and be back
again next year, probably with as much chance of success.

THE scene is Cheltenham last Monday night where punters have gathered
from far and wide for the Gold Cup race meeting. As part of their
preview of the week's racing, a Channel 4 camera crew visited the
Queen's Hotel, a centre of the various social festivities which adorn
the racing.
They interview the inevitable squad of Irish and then find a bunch of
punters from Edinburgh. The cameras move on to another chap sitting on
his own. And where are you from, they ask. Edinburgh, he replies, not
looking at the camera and trying to hide under the baseball cap he is
wearing.
A voice off from one of the Edinburgh contingent is heard: "Dae ye no'
ken who he is? That's Craig Levein o' the Hearts.''
The Hearts defender, who spends much of his time these days suspended
and thus able to pursue his love of the gee-gees, admitted his identity
and added: "But I'm not supposed to be here."
His next encounter with cheery manager Tommy McLean should have been
interesting.
* ALLY McCoist continues to suffer ill fortune on the injury front. It
is not news of another fracture of the foot of the Greatest Living
Ranger Until Brian Laudrup Turned Up.
It's Ally's racehorse. Sar matian in which he has a share is suffering
from toothache and has had to be pulled from sundry races.
* A PIRATE video is in circulation among afficionados of great moments
in TV sports reporting. It is an interview between Chick Young of the
BBC and Walter Smith of Rangers.
The encounter took place the morning after the night before when
Rangers made an early exit from the European Cup at the hands -- or feet
-- of AEK Athens.
Chick ventured the thought that Rangers had paid #5m for players
(Laudrup and Boli) who were not European class. Walter replied that this
was patent nonsense. Except his language was slightly stronger than
that.
In the course of a three-minute interview, in which relations between
reporter and manager became increasingly strained, the normally affable
Walter Smith used the F-word 21 times. Walter also pointed out that
anybody can have an off-day, just like Chick Young was himself
experiencing. "And your questions to the chairman last week were shite
as well,'' he added.
At one point Walter invited his assistant, Archie Knox, to come and
listen to the interview but Mr Knox merely strode briskly in and out of
vision and we heard him advise Wee Chick of an interesting place in
which to locate his microphone.
For some reason this classic of its genre was never broadcast.
* AC Milan is owned by TV magnate Silvio Berlusconi. Tottenham Hotspur
has computer tycoon Alan Sugar. Rangers is in the financial fiefdom of
David Murray's conglomerate.
This connection between footie and big business spreads through the
entire sport. We were hearing some details of the behind-the-scenes
commerce at Glenafton, the Ayrshire junior team.
Their cash appears to stem from dealing in the pigs' trotters future
market. Club secretary John Tympany is a butcher who recently made quite
a killing by purchasing 50,000 pairs of pigs' trotters when the price
was low and selling when the market picked up.
The New Cumnock club's finances appear to be in a healthier state than
many of their senior rivals. They were recently able to outbid Ayr
United for a player.
* WE pondered last week what might be the collective noun for a group
of Scottish football writers. David Sneddon of Paisley was quick to
respond with a list including: A bevvy, a grouse, a handshake, a lodge,
an apron, and a degree.
* YES, we can all have an off-day, even on the sports pages. We
carried an article the other week about ice-skaters Tonya Harding and
Nancy Kerrigan and illustrated it with a nice snap of the two ladies.
Except, as eagle-eyed Stephen Mulrine of King's Park, Glasgow, pointed
out, it was in fact a still photograph of the actresses Alexandra Powers
and Heather Largenkamp who played the skaters in a TV movie.
This is a concept in which the Herald sports pages leads the way.
Coming your way soon maybe, John Gordon Sinclair as gangly wayward
striker Duncan Ferguson, Sean Connery as Fergus McCann, and Arnold
Schwarzenneger as Jim Farry.

THERE has been a deal of myth-making taking place in Scottish football
circles over the past week or so.
We are being asked to believe that Ivan Golac, given his head, could
have been the saviour of our national game. The man who left Dundee
United last week, after almost two seasons as the manager at Tannadice,
might have shown us the way to play football in the Continental style.
With flair.
With superb attacking play.
With personality players being allowed to express themselves.
In short, Ivan Golac, would have provided Scotland with a club team
whose reputation would spread beyond our own gloomy and predictable
premier division.
That is what the myth-makers would have us believe. Unfortunately, it
is all so much nonsense. Indeed, it all amounts to as much gobbledygook
as Golac himself spouted in his time on Tayside.
The facts are there for anyone to see. Ivan Golac won the Scottish Cup
-- to do so he beat Arbroath by 3-2; Motherwell by the only goal of a
replay after a 2-2 draw at Tannadice; Airdrie by 2-0 after another
replay; Aberdeen by 1-0 in the semi-final after yet another replay; and
then Rangers in the final by just one goal again.
Flair? Attacking play? Look elsewhere . . . but don't, if you want to
believe the Golac publicity machine, look at the premier division.
There the statistics are very much worse. In 71 league games -- in a
competition he derides for lack of quality -- Golac won just 19 times.
In doing so his team scored only 79 goals, scarcely better than a goal a
game. Oh, and they lost 89 goals.
Is that really the stuff of legend?
Not in my book.
Golac's reputation, such as it is, has been made by a cup win and a
series of ridiculous claims made on his own and his team's behalf.
Now, Bill Shankly was a man who frequently used hyperbole. I can
remember seeing him after his beloved Liverpool were thrashed 5-0 by the
emerging Ajax in a European tie in Amsterdam. ''Five breakaways,''
snorted Shanks, refusing to give Cruyff and company the credit they
deserved.
But when Shankly did go over the top -- and he did that frequently --
he could still point to the huge list of achievements he had to his
credit.
Dundee United chairman Jim McLean can do the same, though it is not
his way to boast about anything he has done in the game. Now, of course,
McLean has been getting the blame for Golac's failures.
There is no doubt that the man who has ruled at Tannadice for so long
is a difficult person to get along with. I worked with him on his
autobiography some years ago but have still managed to fall out with him
as often as any other Scottish sports journalist. It is the way the man
is. Nothing now will change him.
But when he tells you he did not interfere with the running of the
club when Golac was manager, he is telling the truth. If anything,
McLean possibly did not do enough to help the new man on the block.
However, the chairman was in a Catch-22 situation. If he volunteered
his advice then it would have looked as if he was still trying to hold
on to the reins of team management.
If he didn't then he was sabotaging Golac's efforts. McLean decided
that he would wait to be asked and when few requests came from Golac, he
had to watch as the discipline and dignity he had always demanded at the
club was eroded in a torrent of outrageous claims by a man who should
have known better.
Golac seemed to go out of control as he became a media monster. If you
wanted a crazy quote then phone Tannadice. After all, the man had won
the Scottish Cup, did't that entitle him to say what he wanted?
The trouble, though, was that, while he was becoming more and more
ridiculous in his attitudes, he was losing the respect of his players.
Earlier this season, when he forecast that United would beat Rangers
4-0, one of his players said to me ruefully: ''I wish he would shut up.
All he is doing is making out job harder. Walter Smith won't need to
wind Rangers up, our gaffer has done it for him!''
The player was right. Rangers won 3-0 and Golac suffered from the
taunts of the Ibrox support throughout the game.
Just a few weeks ago he predicted that his team would finish second in
the League and warned that Rangers could still be relegated. How serious
was that meant to be?
Oh, and don't forget, he claimed that he would take the Tannadice side
into the quarter-finals of the Cup-winners' Cup. They flopped against
the poverty-stricken Tatran Presov from Slovakia -- yet, once, not so
very long ago, United were feared and respected all across Europe!
All of these must have hurt McLean, but he kept his own counsel until
last week, and even then only acted within the terms of the contract
Golac had with the club.
The last thing McLean wants is to go back into management. He won't do
it. Whoever comes in has nothing to fear on that score. What McLean will
demand is dedication and discipline and professionalism -- exactly what
he asked from his players when he was team manager.
He will also want consistency and an element of dignity, qualities
which have been lacking at the club.
He will also look for hard work. One insider told me after the Golac
departure: ''The red coats will be hung away now -- this place has been
like Butlin's for the past two seasons.''
Still, McLean won't demand miracles. He won't, for instance, look for
the new man selling Jerren Nixon for #15m, especially as Golac kept his
Trinidadian asset on the bench in so many games.

IN May last year the Government announced its intentions to combat
discriminations against disabled people. And in July its document
Disability on the Agenda -- a consultation on Government measures to
tackle discrimination against disabled people was launched.
Positive steps to end once and for all the discrimination faced daily
by disabled people. But not without the earlier determined campaigning
by disabled people and their organisations to have a form of legislation
in place that would permit disabled people to participate fully in the
life of the community.
The document set out five areas of policy: employment, access to
services, financial services, building regulations, and the creation of
a new advisory body on disability.
Campaigning bodies such as the Leonard Cheshire Foundation were keen
to play a role in the consultation process and were eager to have
constructive dialogue with the Government.
Statistics highlighted the presence of discrimination against
Britain's 6.2 million disabled people. Findings showed earnings to be
substantially below the average and that the majority of disabled people
had no access to earned income. Indeed, 75% of disabled people relied on
State benefits as their source of income.
The Cheshire Foundation, in an effort to assist the Government in its
task, embarked on a survey in the form of a questionnaire among
residents and users of its 127 homes and services in the UK.
The findings of the survey were published three months ago and reveal
many abuses that disabled people have to endure in their daily lives.
''Disabled people should have the right to employment and should be
free from direct or indirect discrimination. Access to buildings is
governed by Part M of the building regulations, however, these
regulations are guidelines and are not enshrined in law. We support the
strengthening of the status of Part M.
''Disabled people should have an equal opportunity to exercise choice
within the market place -- whether in the sphere of leisure, recreation
or in the purchase of consumer goods. Many residents and users have
experience of unfair discrimination against them when attempting to
purchase financial services.''
The Cheshire Foundation was created in 1948 and has grown from being a
single home in England to one with more than 320 homes in 52 countries.
The Foundation employs more than 4000 care staff to look after 1800
residents and 2200 Care at Home Service clients.
One area in which progress has been made is in the field of tourism.
The Scottish Tourist Board has published an information booklet for
those disabled visitors to Scotland. The booklet also provides practical
information on facilities and the difficulties disabled people may find
while using the country's airports.
The board has a quality assurance scheme with information on
facilities provided by B&amp;B establishments, caravan holiday homes, and
large hotels. A scoring system using crowns indicates rank.
Melfort Pier and Harbour has been given deluxe status by the tourist
board. Self-contained houses finished to a high standard on the shores
of Loch Melfort make a comfortable base for the family holiday. They
vary in size to sleep up to six persons in three bedrooms.
All ''harbour houses'' have balconies from which guests can enjoy the
views over the bay and to the hills beyond. Three of the houses are
specially adapted for disabled people and have ample room for wheelchair
users. They are on one level with ensuite shower and bath. For the
family they represent an ideal holiday venue where everyone is
encouraged to take part in activities.
The Scottish Naidex '95 exhibition takes place at the SECC, Glasgow on
March 29 and 30. There is no admission charge. It returns after a
two-year break and will give disabled people and their carers as well as
the professional services a chance to see the latest developments in
equipment and services that have been designed to ease rehabilitation.
Displayed at the ScottishPower stand will be a range of controls and
adaptors for electrical appliances and small-scale kitchen appliances
specially designed for the elderly and disabled people.
NT Access will be exhibiting a selection of door activation equipment
as well as security video and telephone entry systems which are
compatible with automatic or manual doors.
More than 150 exhibitors will highlight the latest developments and
advances in a variety of products and services from furnishings and
household equipment to mobility aids and speech therapy.

THERE is probably only one thing worse in sport than a sore loser and
that is a sour winner. Step forward Brian Moore, the unacceptable and
battered face of English rugby.
In the immediate aftermath of England's 24-12 Grand Slam win at
Twickenham on Saturday, the Harlequins hooker appeared on nationwide TV
to declare that Scotland had spoiled the party, literally.
''I'm feeling sorry for the spectators, because today was set up for
such a good game. We tried to play rugby but we were constantly stopped
by bodies come over the ball the whole time. Scotland did what they came
to do which, quite frankly, was not very much.''
While Moore's comments were the down side, the happy face of the game
was provided by the losing side at Twickenham. For, in a reflection of
the family values projected by the SRU, team manager Duncan Paterson
revealed that wives and girlfriends would accompany the squad to South
Africa for the summer's World Cup.
At their after-match press conference, the gloss was taken off
England's Grand Slam when Moore's comments were relayed to captain Will
Carling and manager Jack Rowell.
Carling, who appeared morose and monosyllalbic, and the more so when
English scribes cast doubt on his side's ability to perform
satisfactorily in the forthcoming World Cup, commented wanly: ''There
was some frustration today, but we are all enjoying the Grand Slam. I
have nothing to say in relation to what Brian has apparently said. He
plays in a different position to me and maybe he sees things
differently.''
Rowell insisted that he was taking nothing away from the Scots by
declaring: ''Scotland came with the intention of not letting us play,
but we manufactured a win and we are looking to 'dog' things out when
some parts of our game aren't functioning. We were nervy and jittery,
but we have a further foundation stone in our progressive plan.
''I think everyone has underestimated the nature of the Scottish
opposition and their incredible will to win. The Scots certainly weren't
short of pace and skill today and we are just delighted to have earned
the Grand Slam.''
All of which was in direct contrast to the mood struck by the Scots.
Dejected and disappointed as they were to have come off second best,
they won the public relations battle hands down.
Asked for his immediate reaction to the game, Gavin Hastings surveyed
the cramped media centre -- a Black Hole of a Calcautta Cup press room
-- and observed: ''I'd have thought that, with all the money they've
spent on the new Twickenham, they could have got us a bigger room.''
With that upbeat opener Hastings the diplomat showed why he and not
Carling had been chosen to lead the British Lions in 1993. He was asked
for a response to Moore's diatribe.
''I wasn't aware that Brian Moore was captain of the English side and
I don't think that what he has said is true.''
Craig Chalmers was even more direct: ''Brian Moore is always shouting
his mouth off about something and everybody knows that. He is not a
spokesman for the RFU. He is Brian Moore the England hooker and that's
all,'' he said.
Gregor Townsend, too, sprung to the defence of his team-mates. ''I
thought England slowed the game down as much, if not more, than we did
at times. A couple of decisions could have gone our way and I thought
the game was a lot closer than the final scoreline suggests.''
The game was certainly no spectacle but, as England won their third
Grand Slam in five years, it deserved a more benign epitaph than that
chiselled out by the surly Moore.
All of which, in any case, was in direct contrast to the post-match
mood within the Scottish camp. Yesterday, the Scotland captain was once
again underlining the family atmosphere which prevails among the players
and management. And it is this ''all for one, one for all'' mentality
which has seen the Scots turn the tide in almost biblical fashion since
the January win against Canada halted the run of nine games without a
win.
That family atmosphere had its own reward yesterday when team manager
Paterson revealed that, uniquely, wives and girlfriends will be included
in the official Scottish Rugby Union party for the World Cup campaign in
South Africa.
Paterson said: ''We want to say thank-you to the wives and girlfriends
who have brought such tremendous credit to Scottish rugby and to the
Scottish nation this season.''
The bearing of the Scots in defeat earned them the admiration of the
English scribes at the post-match press conference. So much so that one
was moved to observe: ''You Scotsmen look cheerier in defeat than
England did in victory.''
To which Paterson responded in the Gala vernacular, and with couthy
good humour: ''Oo'll swop them!''

ANONYMOUS vans have been travelling across the rural landscapes of
Banff and Buchan in recent days. Nothing sinister is afoot. Their cargo
is not nuclear waste, or anything such. Inside is furniture, tapestries,
and pictures.
The destination is Duff House, where a co-operative effort of heroic
scale, involving local authorities, Historic Scotland, and the National
Galleries of Scotland, is bringing new life to a building of European
significance.
Duff House is an extraordinary edifice by any standard. The more so
for its setting, a few hundred yards from the rolling breakers of the
Moray Firth and the little fishing ports of Banff and neighbouring
Macduff. Seagulls cry and wheel over a building of baroque splendour
which would look more at home in the southern landscapes of France or
Italy. It is a masterwork by William Adam.
The house was commissioned in 1735 by the newly created Lord Braco and
later Earl of Fife. No doubt it was intended to reflect his enhanced
status. Unfortunately his financial resources proved inadequate to his
aspirations. The mansion as originally conceived by Adam pere was not
completed with the intended, balancing, side wings in Hopetoun House
style. As finished, the building sits -- magnificent and a little
monstrous -- in its parkland site, backed by beech and chestnut trees
still skeletal at the tail-end of winter.
Four floors of soaring stone are fronted by a curved double staircase.
Symmetry rules. The giant pediment is ornately carved. The central
windows of the main floors are curved in Romanesque fashion. Inset
pillars decorate the sides of the frontage. Classical statues pose high
on the facade. The roof is festooned with large decorative urns, giving
it a startling silhouette against the March sky. The house looks almost
due south, its windows offering glimpses of the greens and fairways of
Duff House Royal golf course.
The mansion's survival into the late twentieth century is in itself
something of a wonder. It was given to Banff and Macduff in 1906 by the
sixth Earl and first Duke of Fife, who presumably had other ducal
billets. It served as hotel, sanitorium, and, during the Second World
War, home for German prisoners of war (some of whom were ironically
killed by a stray Luftwaffe bomb which hit an 1870 extension).
Polish and Norwegian troops used it and left graffiti. In 1956 it came
into the care of the Ministry of Works. More than #2.5m, mostly from
Historic Scotland, has been spent on its restoration. Its day-to-day
running costs will be met by Banff and Buchan district and Grampian
regional councils and their successor authority.
Access when the building is opened to the public on April 26 will be
on both ground and first-floor levels. Meanwhile, this early visitor had
to dodge mounds of builder's detritus to gain the side door.
To cross the threshold is to enter a time-warped world of
eighteenth-century space and grace -- a world, however, beset by mops
and brushes, vacuuming machines, scaffolding, and all the
twentieth-century paraphernalia of workmen and specialists beavering to
bring the great house to life again.
Over all this, the manager, Bet McLeod, presides unflustered, while
Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, darts
about enthusiastically, supervising the placing of pictures and
furnishings.
He emphasises that Duff House is being treated as a country house
rather than as an art gallery. ''The whole idea is to make Duff House
have some of the atmosphere of a great ducal house again.'' The public
may be amused, or wince, to hear that Mr Clifford hopes to put the staff
in ''Duke of Fife tartan trews with ducal coronets on the epaulets.''
Some 200 works -- most from the national collection's reserves but a
few that have been recently hanging in Edinburgh -- will grace the
pastel-painted, gilded salons of Duff House as part of a strategy of
spreading the national art collection to other parts of Scotland.
Already Paxton House in Berwickshire has become an ''out-station'' of
the national galleries. Mr Clifford points out that Duff House's similar
role in no way cuts across plans for the proposed national gallery of
Scottish art in Glasgow, which will concentrate on the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries.
''Trying to put back the spirit and vitality of the house'' is, he
says -- appearing not a whit daunted -- ''a big job.'' As part of this
strategy, #100,000 has already been spent on appropriate furnishings,
with another #100,000 earmarked for this year; the refurbishment will
continue.
There will be Chippendale furniture, designed by Adam. A major loan of
furniture is being negotiated. In the second-floor salon, tapestries
lent by the Marquis of Zetland are already hanging. This room has a
floor of contrasting inlaid woods and a classical ceiling picked out in
crimson and gold leaf. The single light bulb hanging incongruously from
the central plasterwork will be replaced by a chandelier.
An enormous mirror, topped by gilded cherubs, is lying flat in the
north- facing drawing-room, reflecting another elaborate ceiling with
corner ornamentation of Wedgwood blue. The fireplace with its marble and
gold-leaf and blue-and-white scene of a boar hunt is much too grand for
any utilitarian purpose. Between the two rooms is a hallway painted to
look like Siena marble. It will soon be ''groaning'' with sculture,
promises the national galleries' boss.
In contrast to Duff House's external symmetry, its main staircase is
on the west side of the building -- a grand affair, but with an example
of authentically awful eighteenth-century painting at its foot. This
unconvincing urn would definitely have earned its perpetrator a fail
mark in Standard-grade art.
The two central public rooms on the first floor have delicate
traceries of ceilings. The main south-facing room is the ''vestibule''.
Some vestibule. Timothy Clifford explains that what was a very formal
area in great English houses was used much more informally in Ireland
and Scotland -- here perhaps as an overspill drawing-room where the
company could sit or dance.
An enormous equestrian portrait by Raeburn, temporarily berthed here,
will have pride of place on the stairway, leaving William Etty's The
Combat to strike a martial note. The north-facing dining-room will be
hung with Ramsays, the prize one being the full-length portrait of Mrs
Cunyngham. The day I visited, the lady lay propped against a wall,
mysterious behind her plastic wrappings.
Duff House had several heydays under the Fifes. The difficulty,
explains Timothy Clifford, is knowing when to ''freeze'' it. Late
nineteenth-century photographs help with some rooms. Hence, next to the
vestibule is the Prince of Wales's bedroom. This particular P of W was
the one who had Queen Victoria for a mum. In course of time a big
crimson bed will be installed.
On the other side of the vestibule Countess Agnes's boudoir is much
less flamboyant. El Greco's St Jerome was hung here under my eyes, not
too self-mortified a saint on this showing. A Murillo occupied the same
spot in the nineteenth century. Other rooms are earmarked for special
themes such as the Grand Tour.
Bet McLeod, who will manage the running of Duff House, has Scottish
family connections and was educated at St Leonard's School, St Andrews.
Her training in art and architecture includes a Master's degree in
Decorative Arts acquired in New York. Though her previous jobs included
the fascinating task of cataloguing the private collection of the Duke
and Duchess of Windsor, she is ''thrilled'' at the opportunity this
latest post presents.
An education suite runs the breadth of the top floor. Bet McLeod hopes
that not only local children but all sorts of local and specialist
groups will join in talks and tours and workshop sessions. There is also
the exciting prospect that the Royal Academy (the London one) will be
holding a class in life drawing in Duff House in May or June.
The aim of engaging the local and wider public is also pursued on the
ground level where a shop, handsomely appointed in dark wood, and a cafe
will be accessible without entrance charge.
Bet McLeod does not intend the shop to be the kind of place that
stocks ''melamine table mats or tea cosies in the shape of kittens''.
Instead it will have publications on art and design, ''nice jewellery'',
candles and honey from a local monastery, and Portsoy marble. She will
try to use local craftsmen and also to have seasonal themes, though ''no
fluffy Easter bunnies''.
An audio display room will run a 12-minute history of the house, its
refurbishment, and pictures, with Kirsty Wark narrating. A giant key
gives access to the control room -- like a nuclear submarine's -- for
the most modern of electric wiring and burglar and fire alarm systems.
On a normal working day there will be 17 to 20 people on duty, including
nine warding staff on the floor.
This ''nice house filled with goodies'' (as Timothy Clifford puts it)
should draw people from far afield -- and help, incidentally, to boost
the local economy.

DIVERSIFICATION is the name of the game for Fergus Wood, who could be
described as a farmer -- if only because he lives on a farm and raises
sheep.
He also appears four times daily (five times at the height of the
season) in ''The Story of Scottish Wool'' at Aberfoyle. As if that were
not enough, he is the driving force -- from behind a drum kit -- of the
Kinlochard Ceilidh Band and has business partners in the Ukraine and New
Zealand.
Just a gleam in his eye at this stage is the thought of opening a
tourist centre in California similar to the Aberfoyle-based Scottish
Wool Centre. That, itself, may be replicated soon at United Auctions'
Perth Agricultural Centre.
It would be a brave man who would try to venture an opinion on what is
his major interest. When we spoke this week he had just finished taking
two unexpected busloads of tourists through the story of the shepherd's
year complete with live sheep and dogs.
That was followed by a working lunch of tea and a slice of cake while
he approved the design of a promotional leaflet for the Scottish Fine
Wool Producers' organisation. This was briefly interrupted by the local
constabulary with a citation to appear as a witness in the trial of a
youngster accused of trying to walk out of the wool centre with a pile
of sweaters which had not been paid for. There was also a reported
sighting of a Puma in the hills -- bad news for a sheep farmer.
Then followed a whistle-stop tour of the farm-base, Ledard Farm at
Kinlochard, which also acts as the centre for what was the Scottish Fine
Wool Project and is about to be reconstituted as a farmers' co-operative
-- Scottish Fine Wool Producers.
The name change marks the transformation from a research and
development operation into a hard-nosed commercial venture whose aim is
to promote a breed of sheep which will thrive in Scotland and will give
the farmer two bites at the cherry -- wool which will attract a premium
price and lamb for the traditional meat market.
The fine wool project has, to date, involved Merino sires crossed on
to Shetland or North Country Cheviot Ewes. This resulted in the
development of a Scottish Merino ram combining the fine wool bloodlines
of the Australasian Merino with the confirmation and the prolific
breeding qualities of the North European Merino.
Using Shetland or North Country Cheviot ewes they have now produced
their own halfbred ewe -- named Lomond after the Ben. Crossed with a
suitable terminal sire these ewes should produce lambs which offer a
valuable wool income before they are slaughtered for the meat trade.
The Lomond will be formally launched at this year's Royal Highland
Show where Fergus Wood and his partners will be out to recruit new
members for the co-operative which already involves 24 farmers
throughout Scotland. The first commercial clip is with the textile
manufacturers. Rennie's of Mintlaw, near Peterhead, is doing the dyeing
and spinning. Mackinnon of Scotland, at Coatbridge, will produce the
first range of exclusive knitted garments.
To bring the project thus far has cost about #1m, with finance coming
from, among others, Scottish Enterprise, local enterprise companies,
textile manufacturers and J Bibby Agriculture, the agricultural supplies
company. The Scottish Wool Centre also has a substantial share of the
action.
''When our first clip goes into garments it will be the first serious
fine wool range produced entirely in Scotland,'' said Fergus Wood. ''At
present we import thousands and thousands of tonnes of fine wool.
Lambswool sweaters with world-famous brand names may well be knitted
here but not with Scottish wool.''
He is out to change all that. When they produce their first garments
later this year he believes that they will have crossed the quality
hurdle. ''After that we want to go for volume,'' he said.
''It's a long time since the days when the wool cheque would pay the
farm rent. In fact, some Scottish sheep farmers would be quite happy if
their sheep didn't grow wool. It would save them the hassle of taking it
off their backs. We want to inspire a change of direction which would
again see wool as an added value.'' He reckons that ewe lambs could be
winter-shorn and shorn again as hoggs, giving a wool income of #12.50
before they produce lambs.
As he looks across to Ben Lomond this morning Fergus Wood may reflect
that not everything can come right all of the time. His ceilidh band has
just launched an excellent new cassette and CD. They have just had to
turn down the offer of a 10-day stint in Monte Carlo, which is bad.
Sadly the Monte Carlo dates coincided with the lambing season. Perhaps
from that we can divine where his priorities lie.

Christopher Portway finds peace in a land where unrest was routine
THE Scottish Borders fall between two stools. Lacking the drama of the
Highlands, north and southbound before their existence is barely
realised. Thus the Borders are shamefully neglected.
I entered the Borders by following, on foot, a Roman road -- Dere
Street -- that runs there straight than any parallel modern highway from
York. North of Hadrian's Wall was where my footsteps lightened on this
splendid land.
On the southern side of the Cheviots is a territory of stirring
legends, battles of long ago and cattle-rustling reivers; a landscape of
far horizons and meandering rivers, a history of enduring rivalry with
England and of heroes whose names are remembered to this day.
The lush, well-tended and richly timbered Borders are loosely stitched
with small, fiercely independent towns, many containing the substantial
ruins of a great abbey or adjacent to the occupied castle-like mansions
of famed landowners. In the east is a ragged coast still endowed with
fishing fleets and possessing the highly dramatic nature reserve of St
Abbs Head, a blizzard of kittiwakes with rock shelves stacked with
raucous guillemots and razorbills.
For walkers, backpackers and cyclists this magical countryside might
have been crafted with them in mind. Lanes and footpaths vein the grassy
hillslopes and follow the tree-lined rivers connecting towns and
villages. The small, uncluttered roads are a bane to motorists choosing
to tour by car.
The Tweed Bridge on the south side of Coldstream marks the border with
England to offer first-timers a gentle introduction to Scotland.
Coldstream is one of a number of royal burghs with market place, town
cross and severe dark-grey stone houses brightened by an abundance of
cultivated flowers. The textile industry continues to flourish here and
visitors are encouraged to follow the various craft trails and tour
mills.
It is in the heart of the region where most of the towns and the famed
abbey ruins are to be found. At the confluence of the Tweed and the
Teviot stands Kelso displaying a flower-strewn market square, cobbled
streets and distinguished-looking houses as well as its Romanesque
abbey. Its Tweed Bridge was the forerunner of London Bridge and up-river
is Floors Castle, residence of the Duke of Roxburgh.
Further along the Tweed is Melrose which grew up around its twelfth
century abbey, the extensive and splendid ruin set beside an orchard
garden in the shadow of the abruptly rising Eildon Hills, once the
northern limit of the Roman Empire in Britain.
Nearby is the village of Newstead, the site of Trimontium -- the fort
of the three hills -- where Dere Street has its northern terminus. At
Jedburgh there is a picturesque High Street, market square and the abbey
church, almost entire but roofless. And Selkirk, a delightful county
town not taking itself too seriously being known not for a prestigious
abbey but for its tasty buns.
More abbeys and a host of historic castles litter the countryside.
Dryburgh is the most secluded of the abbeys, rising from inside a loop
of the Tweed and housing the graves of Field Marshall Earl Haig and Sir
Walter Scott. Mellerstain, Manderston and Paxton are lived-in classical
mansions containing a truly fascinating collection of historic
furniture, paintings and memorabilia as well as lush woodland gardens to
match.
At Jedburgh again is the house of Mary Queen of Scots, a fortified
town-house laden with evocative mementoes of the queen (including her
death-mask), and at Kelso is Floors Castle.
To the coast and at Eyemouth is a museum of fishermen and fisherwomen
with particular emphasis on the Great East Coast Fishing Disaster of
1881 which claimed 189 lives. Craft centres are legion, some very much
better than others.
Accommodation in the Borders ranges from simple bed and breakfasts to
a suite in the west turret of a mighty castle. At the higher end of the
scale is Duns Castle, a magnificent pile built around an original 1320
Pele Tower once owned by Robert the Bruce.
The old antagonism between the two countries has now matured to a
good-hearted rivalry but violent history will forever be stamped upon
the fair face of the Borders.

Ian White takes a wander through the city determined to revel in
self-preservation
IN 1896 Arnold Bennett declared: ''The difference between Bruges and
other cities is that in the latter you look about for the picturesque,
while in Bruges, assailed on every side by the picturesque, you look
curiously for the unpicturesque, and don't find it easily.''
Almost 100 years later the same is true, for this beautiful gem of
Flanders still remains unblemished with its winding streets, narrow
canals and delightful ancient buildings. This remarkable medieval sprawl
can live up to even the most inflated tourist hype as one attraction
seems only to be bettered by the next.
Graham Greene likened it to ''a notorious jewel, too be stared at,
talked of and trafficked over'', yet it has miraculously survived wars
and the ravages of time to reach a stage where ironically its main
threat may come from its own popularity. It is arguably the most
perfectly preserved medieval city in Europe and originated from a
ninth-century fortress built to defend the Flemish coast from Norman
attack. It grew into a port of enormous power and wealth controlling the
lucrative wool and cloth trade which passed through its harbours and
docks.
Today, however, you will search in vain for any such waterfront
activity. The city began its economic decline in the fifteenth century,
partly because of a general recession in the cloth trade, but
principally because of the silting of the River Zwin, the city's trading
lifeline. By the 1530s its sea trade collapsed totally as the river
became unnavigable to all but the smallest of ships. The result of this
dramatic change can be seen further down the coast at Zeebrugge
(Bruges-on-Sea), the huge container and passenger port which was created
in 1907 to become the modern gateway to Belgium.
As the wealth shifted north with the merchants, the city was left
deserted, its canals were empty and its ageing quiet charms would have
simply withered away had its popularity not been awakened by wealthy
nineteenth-century visitors. Nowadays it is a living city of human
proportions and has rightly been described as the cradle of Flemish art.
You can visit the Groeninge Museum to discover the works of Jan Van
Eyck, Hans Memling and Pieter Breugel. Moving on further down the Djiver
is the Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk whose massive spire is the tallest in
Holland and Belgium. Among the many treasures inside is a delicate
marble Madonna and Child by Michelangelo which was the only work to
leave Italy during the artist's lifetime and was a major influence on
sixteenth-century painters in the city.
It is easy to let yourself travel back in time as you wander among the
high-gabled houses and imagine an age when these narrow cobbled streets
were home to princes and wealthy merchants. Often described as the
Venice of the North, the city is more reminiscent of Amsterdam with its
many cobbled lanes woven around a pattern of peaceful canals and
bordered by lawns, trees and graceful arched stone bridges.
To enjoy a panoramic view of this beautifully proportioned city it is
worth a climb to the top of the thirteenth-century Belfry which houses a
remarkable 47 bells. This tower has an octagonal lantern which is
visible for miles around and the sheer grandeur of this municipal
extravagance symbolises the economic power of a city whose confidence,
as a leading member of the Hanseatic League, was never in any doubt.
Below the tower spreads out the enormous Grote Markt edged on three
sides by rows of beautiful gabled buildings.
Heading off in all directions are a warren of streets and lanes
containing a myriad of cafes, bars, restaurants and shops. For those
intent on guarding the calorie intake this is dangerous ground. Every
second shop contains wonderfully tempting Belgian chocolates and the
aroma of freshly made waffles (served with cream) hangs languorously
around every street corner. If your thirst needs quenching then a
refreshing beer may be the answer but remember, local ales can be as
high as 9% in volume and they slip down with frightening ease. Some
bars, thankfully, restrict the consumption of such fearsome liquids to
three bottles per customer.
The city is ideal for the visitor to walk around, with most of the
traffic kept out of the narrow cobbled streets around the centre. An
enjoyable alternative, however, is to take a horse-drawn coach or a
leisurely boat trip down the canals, allowing the knowledgeable local
experts to guide you through the fascinating Flemish folklore of the
town. Bruges with its history, art and culture is the jewel in the crown
of Belgian tourism. It is a city best visited out of season if you want
to savour, at your own pace, the experience of its many traditions.
The city has spent time and money to preserve its image and while
occasionally it can almost resemble a medieval theme park, there is very
little illusion here, this open-air museum is the real thing. Bruges,
seemingly untouched by war and time, is the perfect tourist attraction,
a city frozen in time.

A CALL for the Government to ensure that continuing reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy includes the support of rural society in
''less-favoured areas'', such as exist in Scotland, is made by the
Church of Scotland's Church and Nation Committee in their report to this
year's General Assembly.
In response to requests from presbyteries the committee has devoted a
section of their report to the future of Scottish agriculture.
The CAP, in its present form, is widely, but not unanimously regarded
as being beneficial, said the report. ''The alternative scenario of
allowing free rein to market forces would result in disastrously falling
prices and many farmers going out of business.''
While recognising that there will always be a need for a minimum level
of bureaucracy to support a scheme like the CAP the committee suggests
that every opportunity should be sought to simplify that aspect of the
farmers' work -- ''so that they may concentrate their efforts on the
primary task of earning their living through land husbandry''.
The report suggests that it is no longer realistic to expect social
and environmental benefits to be delivered as a byproduct of
agricultural output.
The environmental content of the CAP is not adequate, it stated. ''The
money allocated to it is tiny compared with that provided for
agricultural support. There needs to be developed a coherent and wider
rural policy with environmental care as one of its cornerstones.''
On animal welfare the committee argues that there is still much to be
done to remove practices which degrade the lives of farm animals. Some
practices have reduced livestock to mere production commodities and the
Church should continue to press for change, it said. ''Intensive animal
production raises major questions of what constitutes unjustifiable
treatment of fellow beings of God's creation.''
Farming is described as an industry whose business depends essentially
on the interaction of climate and the top few inches of the earth's land
areas. Given the harshness of the Scottish climate and the poor
character of most of its soil, Scottish agriculture clearly has
disadvantages and has the right to support from Europe's funds -- in
view of the EU's commitment to sustaining and improving rural society in
less-favoured areas, said the report.
The committee will ask the General Assembly to urge the Government, in
implementing set-aside, to maintain flexibility in the use of fertile
land, in order to provide for possible changes on policy or
circumstances.

THE Scottish explorer who gave his name to Thomson's falls here in
Kenya was responsible for at least one stroke of genius. When passing
through Masailand he was challenged by some of those wild tribesmen and
in extreme peril for his life.
When nothing but prayer seemed left for him, Thomson saved himself by
taking out his false teeth. So impressed were the Masai with his control
of mind over matter that they not only spared his life but invited him
to stay on in Masailand where he attained something of a cult status.
However, the Masai soon tired of this trick and when they asked him if
he could not take out an eye for a change, Thomson decided it was time
to be moving on.
That was in the nineteenth century. But now another Scottish explorer
was following in the footsteps of Thomson, Livingstone and Stanley. It
was The Farmer, who despite being handicapped by the injury which had
slowed The Breadwinner to a snail's pace, was off to fulfil his boyhood
dreams of taking sundowners on Lake Victoria.
We had crossed the border at night and awoke in Uganda. No wonder they
used to call it the Pearl of Africa. What fertility -- and I don't just
mean the soil. Don't believe everything you read in the papers about the
ravages of Aids. I can tell you that there are fat babies everywhere.
Throughout the six hours in which we chugged slowly towards Kampala
the route was lined with cheering and waving totos while other little
black heads could be seen tearing through the banana groves lest they
miss the fun.
The staple food in Uganda is not rice like in China, or maize like in
Kenya, or salt and vinegar chips like in the UK. Here is it is bananas.
And they grow everywhere. There are neat commercial plantations, of
course, but this must be the only country where the staple food is also
the commonest weed.
And whenever the train slows sufficiently the local produce is offered
up. One of our carriage-mates got a wonderful smelling plateful of fish
curry and mashed banana and another bought 25 huge bananas for 40p. I
used the negotiating skills honed at Maud Market to acquire half as many
for roughly twice as much but they were still cheap. A 12-year-old boy
got no sale though for a fruit which must have weighed about 20lb,
looked like a plucked green porcupine and we later discovered was called
a Jack fruit.
We took at least half-an-hour to pass what must be one of the world's
biggest sugar plantations. We were told that it is owned by the Mudavadi
family who were kicked out by Amin because they are Asians and made new
fortunes in the UK before returning to produce enough sugar for the
whole country and a lot more for export.
And suddenly there she was; Lake Victoria, the source of the Nile with
the great river cascading out. It looked bigger than any Scottish river
and that was just the source. When I thought of the source of our own
river Ythan, where a hard drinker could keep up just watering his
whisky, it made me wonder how all those early explorers could have
missed it.
And soon the slow-moving objects were on the streets of Kampala. It
was hard to believe that as little as a couple of years ago it was hard
to sleep at night for the crackle of small arms fire there. The
atmosphere was good on the street and we never felt threatened in any
way. We had delicious chicken curry, vegetable curry and mashed bananas
and toured the tomb of the traditional King of the Buganda where we met
some of his widows who take it in turns to live in the circle of widows'
huts there.
After the enterprise of the railway halts the shops were a
disappointment. In the home of the banana and the Tilapia fish there was
tinned tuna on offer and cornflakes at #5 a packet. That nonsense is
because most of the money around is your's and mine being spent by
United Nations and other aid workers. Though what good people like that
with their spanking new four-wheel driven vehicles are to Africa I
cannot imagine.
And so to the steamer for Tanzania. It wasn't quite as I had imagined
sundowners on Lake Victoria. There was no use for the white dinner
jacket and there were no pink gins whether shaken or stirred. Still, as
the sun went down, we shared a bottle of excellent Tanzanian beer,
before going below for a delicious plateful of chicken and chips costing
only a big pound.
Of course I didn't really expect the trip to be like the great days of
the Raj, but at the same time, we travelled in comfort compared with the
real explorers. Having said all that, I cannot imagine that Dr
Livingstone had to brave anything more intimidating than the combined
lady's and gent's lavatories on our boat.
An old college friend once said to me: ''When you have slept in the
bosom of Mother Africa, my friend, you can never sleep soundly anywhere
else.'' That may or may not be true but having slept through the border
controls to Uganda and the heart of the continent, we were soon fast
asleep as our tub rolled gently southwards.
But Africa always bites back. We had determined to finish our safari
by flying across the Serengetti in a light aircraft on our way back to
Nairobi. We fancied a bird's eye view of 300 miles of one of the world's
last wildernesses. In the event the plane turned out to be an airliner
which whisked us eastwards in 50 minutes at 27,000ft. All we saw were
clouds.

GAVIN BELL suffers the slings and arrows of outrageous misfortune as a
disappointed Scottish rugby fan marooned in a Twickenham hostelry during
Saturday's Grand Slam defeat
FORGET Rob Andrew, the hammer of the Scots. Arguably the star English
performer on Saturday was the tipsy gent who emerged from a loose maul
in the Turks Head pub to pin his boxer shorts to the ceiling.
As a gesture of national pride, it left something to be desired, but
as an image of the English rugger class celebrating another harvesting
of the Flower of Scotland, it was wondrous to behold.
It was no mean feat, since the ceiling of the Twickenham pub is at
least 15 feet from the floor. The act required acrobatic skill in
clambering upon the shoulders of an unsteady supporting cast, and an
ability to defy gravity including the specific kind in large quantities
of London Pride bitter.
As a climax to the triumphal proceedings, it was relatively
restrained. History will record that the performer had modestly put his
trousers back on before rising to the challenge. But it was hardly
calculated to soothe the pangs of defeat among the few Scots in the
crowd who clearly wished to kick him into touch.
The Turks Head is accustomed to such boisterous behaviour, being a
favourite watering hole of the Middlesex rugby fraternity.
Harlequins, whose captain is one Will Carling, play up the road in one
direction, London Scottish and London Welsh are camped in nearby
Richmond, and the English national stadium is within easy lurching
distance.
Chris Brazier, the affable landlord, used to play for the local Old
Hamptonians, and on match days he displays his old fly-half skills in
passing pints of bitter through unruly scrums in the public bar.
At midday on Saturday, however, the mood was curiously subdued. My
friend Pete, who lives around the corner from the pub, explained that
England expected Carling's men to do their duty, but they also expected
a tough match. ''There's a bit of apprehension,'' he said. ''There are
memories of 1990.''
No such dissidence was apparent at a table of southern counties
gentlemen tucking into a three-course meal and copious quantities of red
wine in a marquee in the pub garden. There was much braying of how the
impertinent Scots were about to get their come-uppance, and the manner
in which England would march on to assume its rightful place in the
pantheon of world rugby in the summer.
There is an insufferable arrogance about the county set, in their
ubiquitous green waxed jackets, that defies the passage of time; it is
as if English riding boots are still firmly on colonial necks and the
destiny of the world is still being decided on the playing fields of
Eton.
It was a relief when the waxed jacket brigade waddled off to the
stadium and were replaced by a more proletarian crowd of locals,
clutching pints of beer and bags of crisps to watch the match on a giant
television screen.
A member of the Old Millhillians Rugby Club, wearing a jester's hat,
complete with bells, set the tone of gruff good humour by mimicking Bill
McLaren's commentary as the camera focused on the Scots players warming
up.
''He's a perambulating lighthouse of a man,'' our guest comedian
intoned in a passable Scottish burr. ''Seventeen stone of prime Scots
beef on the hoof,'' he cried when Doddie Weir hove into view.
There was a bit of confusing cross-dressing among the spectators, with
a few ticketless Scots turning up in kilts and English bobby helmets,
and two Londoners in Scottish shirts proclaiming their kinship, on the
grounds that their parents came from Glasgow. A dishevelled Australian
added an Antipodean flavour by invoking Gavin Hastings to ''stuff the
Poms''.
Early choruses of ''Swing Low, Sweet Chariot'' faltered when Craig
Chalmers opened the scoring, but when Andrew began putting the boot in,
the chariot picked up speed and soon the band of angels were in full
cry. By the end, they had switched to a lovely chorus in which the
visiting supporters were advised where they could stick their Flower of
Scotland.
The real festivities began later in the pub with a rendition of
''Jerusalem,'' that rousing Biblical anthen to England's green and
pleasant land, led by a remarkably fine tenor who surprised me and
mollified other Scots present by following up with an equally stirring
performance of ''Flower of Scotland''.
His egalitarian repertoire extended to ''Sweet Molly Malone'' and
''Bread of Heaven'', in which everyone joined.
''The point is not the words,'' Pete explained. ''The point is to
sing.'' It was when ''Sweet Chariot'' soared to the rafters, accompanied
by the boxer shorts, that I decided it was time to leave.
It is quite likely that in two years' time, when Scotland next play at
Twickenham, the shorts will still be hanging limply from the ceiling of
the Turks Head. In the event that we win next time, it would be an
appropriate gesture for a Scot to remove them.

WELSH rugby was plunged into fresh crisis yesterday within hours of
crashing to defeat in the Five Nations wooden-spoon decider with
Ireland.
Rugby great J P R Williams is reported to have quit as a selectors'
adviser, and fellow British Lion Geoff Evans to have stood down as a
selector following a row over the side picked for the game in Cardiff.
If confirmed, the double body blow will throw Wales' World Cup plans
into confusion with the squad for South Africa scheduled to be chosen on
Wednesday.
The duo are said to have quit last week, but post-dated their letters
of resignation to avoid affecting Welsh preparation for Saturday's
match, which Ireland won 16-12.
Wales' World Cup plans are already in disarray because of the pressure
on Alan Davies -- facing the sack after collecting the unwanted
distinction of becoming the first Welsh coach to suffer five successive
defeats.
The WRU are not scheduled to meet until April 6, but could be forced
to act immediately because of the impending squad selection.
Wales once again had to rely on the boot of Neil Jenkins who kicked
all their points. They scored just one try in the championship and have
managed only three in their last nine games.
With both sides committing unforced errors, Ireland's defence and the
introduction of replacement Paul Burke for the injured Eric Elwood
proved decisive.
Burke, dropped for the last game, kicked 11 points including a
conversion of a try from Brendan Mullin on his fiftieth appearance, to
give Ireland the psychological boost before their next meeting -- in the
World Cup.

WHEN that fat-necked hooker of the English Rose, Brian Moore, made his
criticism of the Scottish Rugby team -- ''Scotland ruined the game. They
did what they came to do -- which wasn't very much'' -- England showed
once again that the Corinthian spirit which once fuelled English notions
of sportsmanship was no longer extant.
Of all sports the one which prided itself in honest endeavor and
amateurism was rugby. Horribly distorted as the idea of playing not for
the ribboned coat but for the sake of the game has become throughout the
world, dreadful as it is that in the last few years, Scottish rugby
players now seem to have splendid salaries from PR companies, a bit like
Soviet athletes all being colonels in the armed forces, and 11-year-old
Romanian girls being graduands of Yoonis, Scottish rugby union still is
played essentially for the love of the game -- and certainly for
sportsmanship.
Fat-necked yahoos now infest almost every aspect of any English
sporting organisation. And damn me, didn't it show on Saturday.
Scotland didn't expect to win -- and didn't. But we came off that park
with dignity, and as with my colleague down South, in the hurly-burly of
the Turks Head pub, (I knew it well 25 years ago and more when I
laboured in the capital of Britain, a haven for upper-class London
Scottish, ex-Fettes, and Watsonian types), so did the Scottish fans.
We expected a defeat and we accepted it. If you ask me the wee Irish
referee, Brian Stirling, an old chum of mine from University College,
Dublin, played a good enough game, but were not the Scots unlucky to
have the man seeing the knock-on which cost us a try and conversion when
we were a mere 15-9 down, and even unluckier for him to fail to witness
the constant English tactic of offside on his own blind one?
Did a single Scot complain? Or anyway that much. Yet another example
of English obdurance to sporting fellowship when committed by the Celtic
nations.
Mind you it has to be said that the Celts seem to possess a sense of
cultural pride, allied to a sense of nationhood which is international
rather than insular, and they tend to celebrate this.
All St Patrick's Day, I was to encounter a wheen of pals from Galway
and the like who stayed over for the Saturday to see Scotland maybe
manage the Grand Slam. And as if there was a dreadful serendipity about
the Celtic nations, did I not combine it with not only St Paddy's Day
but also with The Herald's ain Tom Shields having his daughter's wedding
the day and night of the game? And in between -- Gavin Bell in London
got it easy -- I was watching the game in Allan Glen's Rugby Football
Club premises.
Allan Glen's is much changed. Once a school, for heaven's sake, and my
own alma mater, it also once possessed the oldest-fashioned clubhouse in
the UK but is now much altered. Well, it would be.
You have to be a bit elderly to be a former pupil of AGS and they know
it. In fact the club is doing very well. President, Ian Callan, an old
boy himself, told me that the Old Boys Club has given them a lot of
poppy over the years, and they have.
Not only is the clubhouse much extended and the pitch better than
Hampden, (at least you get to play every week at the Bishopbriggs Glen's
ground, which is more than can be said for Hampden), but the gymnasium,
which has a large and enthusiastic female support, is up-to-date and
frighteningly modern. And a large membership with lots of younger
members and coaches who work away at kids, mini, juniors rugby.
Frightening was the support of all of the various groups at Glen's on
Saturday, too. There are 400 members, (whose first team are now in
Division 3, having come from seventh position, a rather unique
achievement). Part of the reason for that must be the level of
solidarity and comradeship I saw at Glen's at the weekend.
Of course they came for the Scotland game. Maurice, our photographer,
saw the good cheer and had ample opportunity to snap it. I saw a bit
myself from the young lads and their old lags too, and the girlfriends
and even hooker Tommy Lowrie's wee four-year-old, Jennifer.
When you see and hear all of them giving Flower of Scotland laldy and
the wee lassie joining in, there is a lump in the throat which hardened
hacks can hardly ignore. We might not have won but in a strange way I
didn't mind. I'm not sure the old heart could bear it. But what a way to
go.
But back to Allan Glen's. Life has been hard for many a club. The
Hutchesons and St Aloysius merger seems not to have worked, and the
shameful exodus of their best players to Clarkston RFC did not help.
Many other famous clubs are having a hard time which one can
understand given the demise of school sport. But Glen's, with little
chance of FP players -- a lot of us are a little old and frail -- has
breathed new life into itself.
To be honest we did not play well and it wasn't a great game. That was
on the telly. It was a smashing event in the clubs. We sang Flower of
Scotland after it as well. And celebrated for taking part to boot. Sod
English hookers. No more of Moore. Anyway, I was back hame.

THE Scot with most reason to smile was John Manson. After four minutes
of the second half the Dundee High School FP prop was hauled from the
bench to replace the injured David Hilton and win his first cap.
It has been quite a season for the electrician at Rosyth Dockyard. At
the beginning of the year he was dropped by his club and has only
recently regained his first-team place. But the Scottish selectors kept
faith in him -- he was in the A team which beat Ireland 24-18 at
Myreside.
''Obviously, it was a bit of a blow to be left out by the club but it
probably made me more determined to prove them wrong. I was grateful
when Scotland made it clear that they still wanted me.''
Manson's good fortune began when he was named as a late replacement
for Paul Burnell on Scotland's trip to Paris.
He said of his Twickenham debut: ''For the first few minutes the pace
of the game took my breath away. After that I settled down and really
quite enjoyed it.
''I thought we scrummaged pretty well -- we were only shoved off our
heel once and they were penalised for handling the ball. Hopefully, this
is the first of many caps.''
John is to be married to his fiancee, Helen, in July and is likely to
be seen in new club colours next season. The change has not been
definitely settled but where would a lad from Bridge of Allan want to
play his rugby? The unlucky Hilton has sprung a rib cartilage and is
likely to be out for eight weeks.
He did not allow the pain to spoil his Saturday evening, however, nor
will the injury keep him out of the World Cup.
There was a bit of unspotted drama in the Scottish ranks. The other
prop, Peter Wright, damaged his shoulder and will not play for at least
a month. He bravely soldiered on partly because he knew there was no
other replacement.
Wright set up the rucks for both Craig Chalmers' dropped goals yet
also incurred the wrath of referee Brian Stirling, of Ireland, who
showed him a yellow card.
The Boroughmuir man was quite unrepentant. ''He said that I had
stamped on Will Carling who, the ref maintained, was trying to get away
from the ball. In fact, I rucked him out, which is quite legal, because
he was preventing release.''
Then there was England hooker Brian Moore's comments which could be
taped and played at the end of every international against the Scots.
''They ruined the game,'' he moaned. ''We tried to play good rugby but
we were constantly stopped by bodies coming over the ball.''
The Scots hooted in derision at this claim and skipper Gavin Hastings
reacted wisely. ''He is not the spokesman. If that is his opinion, let
him have it.''
Chalmers, who took his international drop-goal tally to eight,
laughed: ''With all the ball England had what was stopping them moving
it wide? I am disappointed -- they were there for the beating but we
failed to clinch our chances.''
Young Craig Joiner had his best game so far. There were times when the
selectors must have thought hard about the Melrose winger but they
persevered with him.
He was sound in defence and very nearly grabbed a second-half try.
Fellow winger Kenny Logan mourned the shortage of ball. ''I got seven
passes and six of them were from the ball boy.''
Yet, the mood in the Scottish camp was upbeat; in an odd way they
would rather not go to the World Cup in South Africa with high
expectations.
The feet are on the ground and the Grand Slam hype would have made
that difficult.
By contrast, England seemed morose. Will Carling sat staring into
space during the post-match press conference, answering in
monosyllables.
Why, posed an English scribe, are the Scots happier in defeat than
England are in victory?
Scotland team manager Duncan Paterson gave him a smile in reply.

''BAD luck. Rubbish eh?'' I said to Craig Chalmers in the tunnel after
the game. By this time the Brian Moore quote was widely know. ''Yes,''
said Chalmers, ''and the gouging was unbelievable too.''
''Gouging?'' I asked. ''Trust Moore and Johnston to do that kind of
thing.''
''No,'' said Chalmers, ''I was gouged by Rob Andrew!'' Well, you could
have knocked me down with a feather, but I would never have expected
''Squeaky'' Andrew to do some gouging, but there you have it.
As for Moore, what a pathetic little figure he is. What a disgrace to
the game, what an idiot. How dare he demean the game of rugby by
whingeing in victory. The English, who I like actually, do seem to think
that, because they're the master race, the rest of us have a duty to lie
down as they advance and let them score tries. Piffle.
It is the object of the defending side to stop the opposition.
England, bless them, were far worse in coming offside when Scotland
had the ball than Scotland when England were attacking. That little nerd
Brian Moore especially.
When England attack they have a man go beyond and turn his back to the
opposition to block the ball off -- when they defend they kill the ball.
England are the common factor in all the world's boring games. They kill
games. Look at flaming Will Carling when poor old Peter Wright got the
yellow card.
I have it on the good authority of one who should know that Pierre
Berbezier, the French coach, has a whole video on Brian Moore. What
dreadful watching it must make, full as it will be with cheap shots,
offside, and inane comments.
Moore, by the way, was, I am told, the only player to walk off the
pitch at the end without shaking hands. For a clever bloke he is some
idiot. He should be shot at dawn.
On the wider picture, something is going to have to be done with the
maul law. We cannot, in rugby, have a set of rules that allow one team
of big sods to walk up the pitch with the ball at the back of them, and
the defending team unable to stop it in any legal way. ''I am doing my
best to get that law changed,'' said Jim Telfer yesterday. ''The maul is
killing the game.'' Telfer is on a Five Nations think tank regarding the
laws, Syd Millar from Ireland is also aboard, and let's hope he has some
success.
I don't condone slagging off referees, but let's just say that the
players took fright when they saw him in the tunnel, because Mr Stirling
from Ireland was shaking with fear at the thought of being on the big
stage. Shame really. The man should have been blooded somewhere else if
need be.
Mind you, if you'd heard the ref's mike, you'd know that the poor man
was assailed at all times by players trying to tell him what to do.
And another thing, it was bad news that two players on the field, one
from Scotland and the other from England, tried to attract the referee's
attention for penalty claims from fairly innocuous obstructions.
''Squeaky'' Andrew, particularly, looked as though he was diving in the
penalty box. That's got to be stopped.
But, to sum up this Five Nations logically and without rancour, it
must be fair to say that Scotland have made huge advances since the
South African game, have a game plan that will suit the harder turfs of
South Africa, have discovered some useful youngsters, and play with
well-directed fire. Morgan and Dixon, after all we chucked at them
during the year, have done well.
For once, after all of the signs to the contrary, the Scottish team
appears to have some strength in depth, and when an injury list that
includes Peter Walton, Gary Armstrong, Ian Jardine, and Damian Cronin is
ripped up, there will be many an incentive to get into the Scotland
side.
But, and I say this hand on heart, we are not at the level of the
major nations. We do not have the bulk that the great countries possess,
especially in our front five, and we will never get it.
Instead we have to adapt our style of play to graft for success, and
that is what is happening.
Scotland have played well, we can all be proud of the team, and Gavin
Hastings is still a thing of wonder. Frankly, I fancy him.
But, and I mean this, England deserved to win on Saturday. They didn't
steal it, they were a better side. That is the sobering thought that we
have to live with on this Monday morning. That, and that fact that Brian
Moore is a rugby player.

VIRGIN, the music, retailing and leisure group of British entrepreneur
Richard Branson, yesterday said it had made a bid for the MGM chain of
cinemas in Britain being sold off by loss-making French bank Credit
Lyonnais.
''We have put an offer in for the MGM cinemas in Britain,'' Virgin
spokesman Will Whitehorn said.
''The offer includes the multiplexes, but it doesn't include the head
office or anything overseas,'' he added.
MGM also has cinemas in the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, and
Denmark.
Mr Whitehorn said Virgin was approached with an idea for the bid by
British entrepreneurs Luke Johnson and Hugh Osmond, but he declined
comment on a newspaper report that it had offered #150m for the chain.
The report said S G Warburg, financial advisers to the sale, were due
to announce a shortlist of bidders today.
''They (Johnson and Osmond) approached us,'' Mr Whitehorn said. ''We
thought it looked like a very, very interesting project.''
He said a major attraction was a new chance to exploit the Virgin
brand. The group has just launched personal equity plans -- financial
investment instruments for individuals -- and a cola brand and is on the
lookout for new ideas.
''The Virgin brand name went down very well in research we've done,''
he said. A cinema chain would give Virgin potential to expand its
retailing operations, especially in multiplexes, and as an outlet for
its Virgin Cola, Whitehorn said.
The sale has attracted many bidders and industry sources reckon the
chain will fetch around #200m.
Short-listed bidders will be invited to a second stage, during which
they will be given more information about MGM's operations. They can
raise their bids at this stage. A final decision is hoped for by June.
AMSTRAD, the computers to consumer electronics group headed by Alan
Sugar, is aiming to become a major supplier of mobile phones.
''My personal goal is to become a very, very big player
quantity-wise,'' Mr Sugar told BBC TV's The Money Programme last night.
He plans to use Dancall, a Danish company bought by Amstrad 18 months
ago, to launch his assault on the rapidly growing mobile phones market.
It is geared up to produce 100,000 phones a month and claims to have
full order books. Chief executive Bob Watkins said it was aiming to take
a 15% share of the world market, producing annual business of #200m.

THAT cheery, extrovert son of the soil, George Wilson Weir, has
created something of a problem for Scotland selectors by the quality of
his recent cap performances, climaxed by a display of some majesty at
Twickenham.
The question they have to ask themselves is whether Scotland's lineout
play can function effectively without Weir even when Damian Cronin and,
hopefully, Andrew Reed once more take their places at the starting gate.
Against the strongest lineout in the world, Weir gave Scotland an
invaluable dimension which, when set alongside a magnificent performance
by Rob Wainwright, provided a lineout lifeline that enabled Scotland to
stay in contention until the more punitive area of the referee's
decision-making took England out of sight.
Weir has admitted that his omission from the national side for the
Canada, Ireland, and France games hurt and acted like a kick on the
rump. It certainly was testimony to his bottle and dogged determination
that, when he replaced the injured Cronin at half-time in Paris, he gave
a performance at once vibrant and productive.
The most searching examination, however, lay in wait at Twickenham and
Weir passed with flying colours.
Sure, Martin Bayfield won some choice ball in the middle for England.
He is a world class specialist with all the physical advantages at 6
feet 10 and 18 stone 2 lbs as well as having a big, heavy minder behind
him in Tim Rodber.
Bayfield also had help from Jason Leonard in front of him. Leonard,
now a crafty campaigner, is clever at easing the opposing jumper out of
his alignment even under the law requiring support players to wait one
metre apart until the ball is played. It requires only the slightest
nudge to eliminate jump competition. No sooner had Graham Rowantree
lumbered on for his first cap as replacement for Leonard than, at the
very first lineout, he took out Weir so that Bayfield had an uncontested
jump.
Even so, Weir had some great moments, with clever timely switches of
position and positive technique, never more so than in that splendid
take and drive when Scotland faced an early panic lineout within a few
metres of their goal line.
That Weir was able to take the ball two handed was a relief. That he
actually should drive through the lineout then excel in ball retention
and supply was a mighty bonus as clearance was effected.
There was also that clean Weir catch and drive from a four-man line
that set up the admirable Peter Wright for a secondary, detached dent as
prelude to that handsome first drop goal by Craig Chalmers.
Once Bayfield thwarted Weir by standing behind him and knocking the
ball away. Later Weir did exactly the same to Bayfield. One recalls only
one embarrassing deflection by Weir but others that did earn profit and
one in particular near the English line that should have been more
productive just on half-time. Indeed there was one Weir deflection that
went straight to Craig Chalmers, showing that the tall one from
Carlsberg Tetley in Alloa has come of age as a lineout purveyor with
craft and skill and also with athletic ability in getting to places
which locks even in modern times are not supposed to reach.
Of course it was a blow when Gavin Hastings elected to run out of the
twenty-two and gave it to Weir as he had done for the Eric Peters try
against Wales. When Weir was sunk he was then penalised for not
releasing and Rob Andrew's sixth penalty goal made it 18-9 with 20
minutes left. Although that turned out badly for Scotland, the fact is
that Weir's instinct took him back there in position to provide
Scotland's captain with an option. It worked like a charm against Wales,
not quite so well against England.
There is still much water to flow before the start of the World Cup
and whilst Weir's lack of ballast -- he and Stewart Campbell aggregate
32st 4lb, Bayfield and Martin Johnson, 36st 1lb -- and the absence of a
rock solid, hard scrummaging loose head, could place Scotland's
scrummage at some disadvantage against the really heavy packs of the
World Cup, Weir's return to commanding lineout form and his mobility and
anticipatory powers in open play, surely have shot him upwards in
Scotland's back five ratings so that in the key games of the World Cup
he is more likely to be on the pitch than on the bench.

England 24, Scotland 12
ENGLAND bludgeoned their way to a third Grand Slam in five years but
Scotland the brave made them fight every inch of the way.
There were no tries and as a spectacle it fell short of the glittering
Grand Slam finale that, perhaps unrealistically, we had all hoped it
would be.
But the young Scottish side, still building towards the World Cup in
two months' time, take immense credit from a gritty display in the face
of the almost overwhelming physical presence which is the bedrock of the
English game.
The Scottish defence was immense. In the back row and in the midfield,
time and again, English attackers were chopped down with chilling
finality.
It has become a convention that the referee -- the Lonely Man as the
French term him -- should be immune to criticism. However, and not just
from a Scottish viewpoint, some of Irishman Brian Stirling's decisions
were unfathomable.
The penalty count of 19-9 in England's favour was ultimately
Scotland's undoing, Rob Andrew punishing the Scots with seven successful
penalty kicks to add to his drop-goal, but the seemingly random nature
of Stirling's decisions had both sides scratching their heads in bemused
bewilderment.
The yellow card -- Scotland's first -- which came Peter Wright's way
just after the half-hour mark was a case in point. The Scottish prop,
who played much of the game with a sprung collar bone and whose World
Cup slot must now be in some doubt, was penalised for stamping on
Carling.
Wright maintains that he was rucking, not stamping, and there are few
-- barring Mr Stirling -- who would gainsay that.
The injury to Wright, and the much more serious rib damage to
loose-head prop David Hilton, will be a legacy from the game that the
Scottish management could have done without.
Doddie Weir was Scotland's man of the match. The lanky Melrose man was
as prickly as a Scottish thistle. Against England's overwhelming lineout
superiority, he was Scotland's main provider of touchline ball but his
contribution elsewhere was out of the top drawer.
Weir was caught in no-man's land in a virtual repeat of the move which
led to Eric Peters try against Wales. On the hour-mark Gavin Hastings,
just as he had done against Wales, fielded a high ball and threw out a
pass to Weir. This time, though, there was to be no happy ending.
Weir was trapped and the penalty was conceded. Andrew goaled and a
six-point deficit suddenly became 18-9 in England's favour.
The Scottish back row, although conceding over a stone a man to their
English counterparts, did what was expected of them in keeping Rodber,
Clarke, Richards (and later Ojomoh) on a tight rein.
Gavin Hastings, with his two penalty goals, created a new Scottish
record of 56 points in a championship season, but the bare statistics
pale into insignificance when compared to the charismatic lead which he
has provided throughout this rags to riches season. He almost had a try,
too, Mike Catt spoiling a reprise of the Parc des Princes stormer.
Craig Chalmers, the other Scottish points scorer, has had a
renaissance season. He is now back to his commanding best and his two
drop-goals on Saturday were a personal reward of sorts for a season-long
gutsy performance.
Kenny Logan had a quiet game by his standards. The ball did not run
for him and he still awaits his first Five Nations' try. On the other
wing, Craig Joiner had his best game yet in a Scotland shirt, once
skinning Rory Underwood on the outside in a fair imitation of a blue
streak missile.
Scotland could count themselves desperately unlucky that they did not
reach the interval with more to show for their efforts. England led 12-6
at the turn but on the stroke of half-time the Scots had forced a
lineout just five metres from the English line.
It was a splendid platform for the try which was by no means unlikely
but the Scots were thwarted by the blast from Mr Stirling's whistle
which signalled the half-time break.
From the kick-off Rob Andrew showed England's hand with a series of
diagonal kicks for position. Tellingly, the first of those was intended
to test young Joiner on the right wing. With the Twickenham hordes
booming ''Jerusalem'' in the background, England had the Scots under
intense pressure but, always, there lingered the likelihood that
Scotland would break out.
The intensity of the Scottish game was highlighted by the number of
Englishmen who went down hurt in the opening quarter of an hour.
Assistant coach Richie Dixon had promised that Scotland would rattle
England's teeth. No surprise, then, when Kyran Bracken retired
temporarily with a bloodied mouth.
Scotland took the lead after 18 tense minutes with a Chalmers
drop-goal. Weir had taken two-handed at the tail of a lineout, Wright
charged on and the ball popped back for the Scotland fly-half to spear
the ball between the uprights.
England equalised after 22 minutes, Andrew kicking the first of his
penalties as Scotland were troubled by the juggernaut English maul. Four
minutes later England were mauling again and, again, the Scots conceded
a penalty for Andrew to slot the ball home.
The charging Wright was involved again as Scotland equalised from
Chalmers' second drop goal in 32 minutes but three minutes later Andrew
kicked England back in front as Weir was adjudged to be offside going
for a ruck ball which seemed to be fair game.
Rob Andrew made it 12-6 with a penalty goal in the thirty-eighth
minute and Scotland had played with fierce determination to be only six
points adrift at the turn. Eight minutes into the second half, as that
old warhorse Dean Richards lay injured with rib damage, Andrew made it
15-6 with yet another penalty goal and it seemed, then, as if the game
was drifting away from Scotland.
The Scots fought back, though, and a Hastings penalty goal was scant
reward for a blatant professional foul under the posts by Jason Leonard
as he dived offside on a loose ball, choosing to concede the three
points rather than the potential seven which would have accrued from the
Scotland try that was in the offing.
Andrew eased England further ahead in the fifty-seventh minute with
the penalty goal that followed the Hastings pass to Weir deep inside
Scottish territory but once again Scotland retaliated when the captain
kicked Scotland back to within six points as Rodber was caught offside
at a ruck.
Just after the hour-mark Andrew made it 21-12 with a drop-goal from a
scrummage inside the Scottish 22 but the Scots refused to lie down and
nine minutes from the end Wainwright set off on an arcing run and, aided
by Joiner, Townsend came within a few metres of the line before chipping
dangerously and Brian Moore was forced to touch down.
Andrew's seventh penalty goal came in injury time. Scotland had
suffered fom the sheer poundage which England were able to bring to bear
in the close-quarter exchanges but they, nevertheless, finished much the
fresher, English fitness seemingly being called into question. To
England, then, went the spoils of victory but, in defeat, Scotland
served notice that this young side will travel to South Africa with
heads held high and honour intact.

MOTHERWELL manager Alex McLeish is all set to break the club's
transfer record by going Dutch before the signing deadline at the end of
the month. The man he is after is 23-year-old defender Mitchel Van Der
Gaag, of PSV Eindhoven.
After seeing his side breath some life into the race for the Premier
Division championship by beating Dundee United 2-1 at Fir Park on
Saturday, McLeish revealed that he plans going back to the Continent
this week.
He has watched Van Der Gaag twice and although the defender cannot
command a regular place in one of Europe's top sides, I understand the
asking price is #500,000 and that doesn't scare off McLeish.
He said: '' It will probably be at the end of the week when I go and,
hopefully, some business can be done.''
In the meantime, striker Tommy Coyne, sidelined for the last six
matches, is approaching fitness and could be included in the squad for
Wednesday's game against Hibs.

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown will today name his squad for the crunch
game against Russia in Moscow next week, and last night he was pondering
the inevitable problems which surround his selection.
He knows he will upset in-form striker John McGinlay if he insists on
the Bolton man missing his club's game against Portsmouth on Saturday.
He knows he will be under fire if he selects off-form Aberdeen star
Eoin Jess who has managed less than 30 minutes play in the last two
games.
He recognises the need for the experience and the revived form of
Manchester United's Brian McClair in the toughest qualifying game of the
European Championship group. But he also has to accept that McClair will
only accept the Moscow invitation if he is guaranteed a starting place.
The former Celtic player made that a condition when he quit the
international scene after the last European Championship Finals. He has
not been back since.
To make way for him Brown must ditch players who have been willing to
accept a squad place and make no further demands on the manager.
He will also risk a backlash of criticism for picking Paul McStay
whose form has been questioned by his own club manager.
Nothing is easy for the Scotland manager.
Even the obvious need to stick by Everton's Duncan Ferguson will be
criticised by some because the striker is under suspension.
Personally, I see no problem there. Brown has already picked Hearts'
defender Craig Levein while he was suspended and, in any case, the
championships carry their own punishments. Why should anyone suffer
twice?
The bulk of the squad will remain largely as before. Jim Leighton will
be first choice goalkeeper in the absence of Andy Goram and Nicky Walker
will be his number two.
There will be no great shocks. Brown will go to Moscow with what he
has available.
McGinlay did not make it any easier for him yesterday when he scored a
spectacular goal to beat Millwall at The Den.
The player said afterwards: ''It was the best goal of my career. It
was also my 100th League goal. I know I have to keep on getting goals to
stay in the Scotland squad.''
Today, he will almost certainly ask Brown for permission to play next
Saturday instead of spending an hour or so training at Fir Park. In my
view, he should be allowed to play.
After all, Colin Hendry played on a Sunday this season -- something
the manager said he would never allow. A happy McGinlay might be
important in Moscow. An unhappy McGinlay might not be in the mood he has
shown so often this season for his club.
I don't know if that is a risk Craig Brown should take.

ALICE was having another go at trying to understand economics. Her
tutor, the Virtual Reality Turtle, taking time off from his job as
confidential economic adviser to the Government, was endeavouring to
explain that this time everything was under control and no matter how
everybody felt about it they really were better off.
''What is the economic situation now then,'' asked Alice, wanting to
know because for the life of her she could not make up her mind.
''Oh come off it,'' snapped the turtle. ''Haven't you been listening
to anything I've said. How could I or anyone else for that matter tell
you that. We won't know what the economic situation really is today for
at least another 18 months, probably two years, and even then there will
be room for argument.''
Alice scratched her head in puzzlement. ''Don't do that.'' said the
turtle sharply. ''Psychologists say that makes you look uncertain. You
will make people think I am not explaining things clearly.''
Tapping a few keys on her lap-top notebook in an attempt to appear
intelligent Alice asked: ''But if you do not know what the economic
situation really is how can you decide what is the correct economic
policy?''
The turtle smiled a sly smile. ''That's the whole beauty of it,'' he
said patting his wallet smugly. ''There is no such thing. But it's fun
trying things out.
''We haven't the faintest idea what the correct policy would be -- but
neither have the politicians. They take all the credit if one happens to
work -- and they are desperate to have one which will win them the next
election.
''They want the best policies, we sell them. At very nice fees and
salaries. That is the first immutable law of economics -- policies cost
money. The second law, of course, is that all policies ultimately turn
out to be wrong and have to be replaced with new ones. It's all very
satisfactory.''
Alice looked bothered. ''But don't the politicians realise you do not
know what is going on. Why do they let you mislead them?'' she
protested.
''Oh dear,'' sighed the turtle. ''You have to understand that
politicians are simple people who are very much impressed and influenced
by our degrees.''
Putting on his mortar board and looking very superior he added:
''Sometimes we mislead them by small degrees and sometimes by large
degrees and sometimes by the square on the hypothenuse.
''Then they have to devalue the currency or treble interest rates or
both and a new Finance Minister comes in -- and he always wants a new
economic policy. Of course, we don't mean to mislead them but that's the
way the cookies crumble. Statistics prove it.''
The turtle burst into song -- ''Interest rates up, interest rates
down; About turn; tighten belts; spend, spend, spend. You take the high
road and then you take the low road and I will meet you at the U-turn.''
Alice nodded. ''Thank you,'' she said. ''Now I understand at last why
you persuaded my mother that I should study Higher economics and
book-cooking rather than domestic economics and needlework.''
At this point the White Rabbit who had been sitting very quietly
suddenly spoke.
''Excuse me Mr Turtle sir, but could you please explain the economics
of privatisation and regulation.
''I can see it is pretty smart for a government to sell off
state-owned businesses for a whole lot of money but go on collecting
from them by taxing profits and dividends and the huge new salaries paid
to chairmen. But I do not understand the regulation and price control
system.
''We seem to have regulators with Draconian powers over prices and
profits -- and the value of my shares -- but who were not elected and do
not seem responsible to anyone in particular.
''They have complicated formulae which look like K minus two or eight
or something else which I cannot find in my maths book to keep prices
down and make the companies more efficient.
''But the companies seem to become more efficient by sacking thousands
of workers. And a minus on the company payroll seems to equal a plus on
the unemployment total.
The more efficient the companies get the more people they put on the
dole. And the more the unemployment total rises the more the Government
panics about finding the cash to pay unemployment and housing benefits
and the more they increase the taxes on almost everything you can think
of.
''I understand that the prices of most of the regulated things have
gone down or not increased by as much as inflation. But why does nobody
believe it? And why is there no regulator to bring down the price of
carrots?
''Does the economy really benefit by exchanging lower prices for a few
things for higher unemployment and higher taxes on a lot of things?''
But the turtle had pulled his head back into his shell and did not
seem to have heard the question.

Carcassonne, (France), Sunday -- European Commission President Jacques
Santer today called for the Group of Seven industrial powers to take
joint action to stabilise world currencies.
Mr Santer said recent monetary turbulence was largely due to the
effects of ''benign neglect'' of the dollar, and urged the G7 to
co-ordinate policy as they had done in the 1980s with the so-called
Plaza and Louvre accords to counter currency swings.
''We must act on the causes of monetary turbulence, which are not so
much fundamentals as the effects of benign neglect vis-a-vis the
dollar,'' Santer told a news conference after an EU foreign ministers'
meeting in this South-western French town.
''I think the G7 has to be involved much more than it has been in the
last months,'' he said.
The recent turbulence, which has also upset the European Monetary
System, has been largely caused by the dollar's drop to post-war lows as
investors seek safety in the mark and yen.
But the United States, while saying it did not encourage the dollar's
slide, has so far resisted mainly French calls for concerted action.
Some EU Government leaders say privately the turbulence has been
fuelled by a market perception that President Bill Clinton was not
particularly committed to controlling the US federal budget deficit.
Mr Santer said EU economy and finance ministers would discuss currency
turbulence at a meeting in Brussels today.
It will be the first such session since the Spanish peseta and
Portuguese escudo were forced to devalue within Europe's semi-fixed
exchange rate mechanism -- the Union's vehicle to a single currency --
two weeks ago.
Both those currencies were hit by a new wave of selling last Friday,
prompting speculation that they may be forced to devalue yet again or
even quit the ERM.
The Irish, French and Belgian currencies also suffered, as did former
ERM members the British pound and the Italian lira.
Mr Santer said Europe's monetary system had resisted the recent crisis
well and had overcome a more serious threat to its survival in August
1993, when the ERM currencies' fluctuation bands were prised wide open
by forces of market speculation.
The only conclusion, he said, was that the faster the EU moved towards
a single currency the better, while still respecting the timetable and
economic convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty on closer union.
* Berlin, Sunday -- Senior German currency traders predicted this
weekend that the flagging US dollar would soon plunge to new record lows
and that fresh mark strength would trigger more turmoil in Europe's
currency system.
Chief traders from five major banks in Germany said the dollar could
fall to DM1.30 or below and also post a new record low against the yen.
The dollar hit a record low of DM1.3450 as well as a post-Second World
War low of 88.75 yen earlier this month.
Dieter Pfundt, chief forex trader at Citibank in Germany, said
fundamental problems, such as the big US trade deficit and budget
shortfall were behind the losses.
''Most people presently regard the movement of the dollar as
irrational, however if you look at the fundamentals it looks to me as if
it is not yet done,'' he said, predicting a further fall to as low as
DM1.25 marks.
''It is not technical trading and some crazy traders but fundamentals
which are pushing the dollar down,'' he said. -- Reuter

THIS week sees a continuation of the reporting season with plenty of
company majors set to produce their figures, writes CHRIS STONE.
There is also a smattering of Scottish orientated companies in the
line-up, first and foremost being Guinness with its United Distillers
spirits operation.
Guinness's full-year results are due on Thursday and are expected to
approach the #1000m mark, though with still some way to go.
NatWest's analyst has pencilled in #911m against #702m in 1993 with
the dividend up to 13.8p from 12.8p. Spirits, the biggest earnings
generator, is thought likely to show flat profits of about #704m with a
light improvement in sales of Scotch but a modest decrease in other
spirits. The beer side could have profits ahead by around 8%.
On Wednesday, Weir, the Glasgow-based engineering group, will be
announcing full-year results. Weir has been going through a tough time
and in January the shares slumped further after a downbeat trading
statement and news of a #7m shake-up of pump operations accompanied by
420 redundancies.
However, Analysts at Bell Lawrie White consider the share price
weakness has been overdone and recently issued a buy recommendation.
They are looking for pre-tax profits of #33m against #37.5m last time
and a dividend of 7p against an adjusted 6.3p.
Also reporting annual profits on Wednesday is sausage skin
manufacturer Devro International, which is based in Moodiesburn. It has
developed new products for its wide-ranging markets. Half-year profits
were up 17% on a pro-forma basis and analysts are looking for profits
approaching #30m over the full year.

WHATEVER else happens in what promises to be another eventful week,
not least in currency markets, there is one jamboree that the media will
not want to miss -- Lonrho's AGM which takes place on Friday at London's
Barbican Centre.
Founder and former chief executive Tiny Rowland, who was sacked from
the board earlier this month, has asked shareholders, to support
resolutions which would give him the title of president of the company,
something that could have been just a formality before the final bust-up
with his successor Dieter Bock only a few weeks ago when he finally left
the group.
Mr Rowland, 77, has shown that he has lost none of his legendary
resolve, suggesting over the weekend that he intended to remove Mr Bock
as chief executive and that he would not be in the job in six months'
time.
Whether or not Mr Bock is there in six months, it is likely that Mr
Rowland won't be. The position of president is, in any case, honorary
and does not carry a seat on the board.
But the Bock camp is believed to be confident that enough votes have
already been lodged to prevent Mr Rowland from achieving his aim though
doubtless he will still pick up votes from his once adoring army of
small shareholders. They are, though, not so large nor so adoring as
they used to be.
Mr Rowland will be opposed by Lonrho's chairman, Sir John Leahy, a
former Foreign Office mandarin. One of the more intriguing aspects of
the clash is that for the first time, Mr Rowland may speak at the AGM.
In all the years that Lonrho has been a major public company, Mr
Rowland has never addressed shareholders. This was always left to the
chairman of the day. He will, of course, be among the shareholders not
on the platform, but it seems almost inconceivable that the chairman
will try to gag him, should he decide to speak.
Ironically, Mr Bock himself will be voting his 18.7% stake in Lonrho
in favour of the resolutions because of an earlier legally binding
agreement. Mr Rowland still controls around 6% or Lonrho but has
threatened to try and call an EGM later in the year which would
necessitate him lifting his holding to 10%.
In a 15-page letter to 57,000 Lonrho shareholders, Mr Rowland said Mr
Bock had ''displayed very poor management skills in the last 18
months.''
Mr Bock is currently suing the German magazine Focus and the Mail on
Sunday newspaper over allegations concerning the sale of 4300 German
flats by Lonrho in 1993.
For his part, Mr Rowland has started legal action against Lonrho for
wrongful dismissal.
It is likely to be standing room only at the Barbican come Friday.

THERE is a fresh element to the retail price index on Thursday when a
third measure of inflation, RPIY, which excludes indirect taxes and the
council tax as well as mortgage interest payments, will be published.
This additional index will result in the figures being published on a
Thursday instead of Wednesday.
The Bank of England has made no secret of its distrust of RPIX
inflation which excludes only mortgage interest payments. Changes in
excise duties can distort inflation in the short-run and obscure trends
just as much as mortgage variations.
There has been speculation that when the Treasury comes to restate its
inflation target for the next Parliament it will be done in terms of the
new RPIY rate instead of the underlying rate (RPIX).
Capel economists are forecasting that RPIY inflation will have edged
down from 1.7% in January to 1.5% in February.
The retail price index is projected to have risen by 0.5% in February,
leaving the annual headline rate of inflation unchanged at 3.3%. The
underlying rate is likely to retreat from 2.8% to 2.6%, still above the
middle point of its 1% to 4% target range.
With sterling in the doghouse and the markets transfixed by the
interest rate outlook the inflation data are the most important in a
busy week for statistics.
On Friday, the fourth quarter national accounts and balance of
payments figures are published. Gross domestic product has already been
estimated to have grown by 0.8% in the quarter and 3.9% in the year. No
change is expected in these figures.
The visible trade deficit in the fourth quarter rose to #3100m.
Assuming invisibles contribute a net #1500m, a current account deficit
of #1600m is on the cards against a freak surplus of #500m in the third
quarter.
Some deterioration in the non-EU trade deficit last month, due to be
reported tomorrow, is projected taking the shortfall up to about #400m
from #300m in January.
Today's money supply figures are expected to show a rise in broad M4
of 0.5% taking the annual rate up from 4.3% in January to 4.4%. M4
lending is forecast to retreat from #4600m to #3500m, still a strong
figure.

AFTER a sell-out season at the tiny Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn, a
revival of the Fats Waller music review, Ain't Misbehavin', has now
transferred to Shaftesbury Avenue. The production may seem a bit more
elaborate (you'd expect that in a larger theatre), but the splendid
singers/dancers have lost none of their zest. Their show seems faster
and more pointed than ever.
As its title implies, the show is an irresistible celebration of the
songs written and made famous by Thomas ''Fats'' Waller, one of the most
charismatic and enjoyable personalities in the history of jazz. Unlike
many recent shows, this is no biographical concert, but a musical review
principally made up of songs written by Waller, plus a few others of
which he made memorable recordings.
The splendid cast is led by Ray Shell (the original Rusty of Starlight
Express) who has a debonaire charm and authority in all he does,
contrasting nicely with the peppy song and dance routines of Sean
Palmer, who is particularly good in the sinuously seductive Viper's
Drag.
Both of these performers are American, while the three excellent women
who complete the cast are British, but don't sound it. Debbie Bishop,
Melanie Marshall and Dawn Hope are highly successful in single numbers
which establish their own distinct personalities and the entire cast
also combine their talents when required to do so.
Every song is a hit and the variety and scope makes the evening whizz
past in a twinkling of an eye. Ain't Misbehavin' plays like a hit in
Gillian Gregory and Nicolas Kent's constantly inventive production.

THERE'S a wonderful moment in Alan Rickman's haunting,
beautifully-paced production of Sharman Macdonald's The Winter Guest,
when pubescent Tom leans across to touch the spikey hair of Sian
Thomas's melancholic single-parent photographer, Frances. ''It
tickles,'' he says, in one of those theatrical moments of stillness when
something special, almost subliminal, is being transmitted: a moment of
wonder, curiousity, communication between generations and terrifyingly
fleeting.
But then, Macdonald was ever the recorder of the transitory. In an age
of crudity, her delicacy of touch is still very special, though her
writing has grown and now has a new maturity about it. She is still the
sharpest of observers of the growing pains and rights of passage of
adolescence and, like a latterday Muriel Spark, of gossip.
In The Winter Guest -- set on a snowy, bleak stretch of west coast
Scotland, where Robin Don's brilliantly angled perspective of rocks and
pier makes you wince with cold just to look at it -- her cruellest,
wittiest lines are saved for the two provincial ladies of Sheila Reid
and Sandra Voe, connoisseurs alike of high teas and funerals. Nothing
like a nice funeral to go to -- except when the shadow starts to fall
your own way.
Macdonald's winter guest is exactly that -- the awareness of death in
life even as the long cold winter's thaw seems about to herald rebirth.
Endearing and, at moments, hysterically funny on boys and their physical
development, The Winter Guest is also equally atuned to the fraught
relationships between mothers and daughters. With another play opening
next week, Macdonald is gloriously on form.

FOR the second time this spring, a play concerned with Bosnia has
broken out in the Royal Court Upstairs, written by a young woman. But
Judith Johnson's Uganda could hardly be more different from Sarah Kane's
controversial Blasted.
Where Kane resorted to dramatic overkill, Johnson's family drama is
far more modest and conventional. Yet what a dramatic sleeper it turns
out to be, not only knocking over racial and homophobic prejudices with
the lightest of touches, but doing so with cumulative emotional force.
Like Sharman Macdonald's The Winter Guest, Uganda is inspired by the
death of a parent. For Macdonald's, the motivation was second-hand --
actress Lindsay Duncan's loss of her mother. Johnson's is far more
personal -- her own father, around whom she weaves a tale of emotional
blight with immense compassion. For, against the odds, it is the visit
of an ''alien'' -- a Ugandan Indian -- into Billy Ellis's Scouse home
that becomes the catalyst for change.
At the heart of the play is David Fielder's heartbreaking performance
as Billy, the grumpy widower whose apparent selfishness hides a pitiful
childhood of emotional deprivation. Locked into his own grief, he is the
despair of his grown-up children, huddled in front of his television,
almost oblivious to their existence.
Yet Johnson rehabilitates this apparently unsympathetic figure with
remarkable skill, whilst also weaving a magical tapestry of family
relationships and frustrations around caring for ageing parents. Jim
Simmons's exquisite lighting and Polly Tealed's careful direction make
this, in the end, a glowing, heart-warming experience with delightful
performances all round.

When Janine Atoni sculptures she gives the work big licks. Clare Henry
describes the indomitable style of an artist who carves sweet dreams
from chocolate
FINGER-lickin' good is not normally associated with art but one
teenage viewer found Janine Antoni's chocolate self-portrait sculptures
so irresistible that she ate the noses from four of them. ''The incident
was in Venice and this poor Czech girl was caught and deported. I felt
terrible about it. And as she was deported I still don't know if she did
it through hunger, hate or sheer self-indulgence!''
Now restored to their former glory, the sculptures form part of
31-year-old New Yorker Antoni's first retrospective exhibition which
opened this weekend at Glasgow's CCA before touring to Dublin's Irish
Museum of Modern Art.
Antoni also used huge cubes of lard (500lb) and soap as well as
chocolate (600lb before chewing) as raw materials for sculptures like
Gnaw. Of 14 busts which form a memorably elegant circle of classical
heads on pedestals, half are cast in chocolate, half in soap.
This piece is not called Lick and Lather for nothing, Antoni's
innovation is to use her body as a tool to make art, chiselling with
teeth, mopping with hair, eroding with the tongue. True, to start with
she manipulates the material with hi-tech casting plastics and dental
instruments but she finishes off with more intimate manoeuvres.
More and more of today's artists eschew traditional indestructible
marble and bronze for short-term consumer goods. The throwaway, ''chew
it up and spit it out'' ethos is overtaking art. No longer do sculptors
chip or hammer at stone, or pour molten metal. Women especially favour
domestic, user-friendly ingredients culled from kitchen, bathroom or
garden.
Early on Helen Chadwick used organic materials like compost and offal.
Last year her large cauldron of bubbling chocolate perfumed London's
Serpentine Gallery with a lingering sweet, sticky smell. Elsewhere Anya
Gallaccio coated walls -- not with brown paint but with chocolate.
All are following in the steps of that seminal figure, Joseph Beuys
whose obsessive interest in slabs of fat and lard dates from 1943 when
his Luftwaffe plane crashed and he was saved by Tartar tribesmen who
wrapped his body in fat and felt. Ironically Beuys's work is virtually
devoid of ideology but by the 1970s he was hero-worshipped as a shaman
and others invested his work with spiritual magic.
Antoni's Beuysian gesture is Eureka, where she submerged her body in a
bath of lard, then made a huge bar of soap from the displaced lard. From
what I could see at the CCA last week, it's hard work slicing up that
much lard.
So what does it all mean? Is it a feminist statement about women's
work, women's bodies, women's eating disorders, women's status in
society and as artists? ''I am interested in the bite because it's both
intimate and destructive. It sums up my relationship with art history,
history which defines me as an artist and excludes me as a woman. I want
to destroy it.''
Antoni is pretty, charming, intelligent and highly fluent with her
explanations, but she rattles them off far too pat, assuming -- or
hoping -- everyone will accept her motives and faithfully regurgitate
her interpretations. Yet not everyone will see anything more than a lump
of lard -- and few will invest it with significance or with Antoni's
ideology.
The show begins with a piece called Wean made when a post-graduate in
1989 and which she believes is seminal to her work. ''It consists of a
cast of my breast, my nipple and three teats plus the packaging. It's
about separation and absence. These objects mediate our intimate
interaction with our bodies. They define and locate the body within a
culture.''
The show ends with gold brooches; multiple casts of her nipples. ''You
wear them, one each side.'' How much? ''We made 40 pairs for my show in
Sweden. They all sold.''
A new piece, a bell cast in bronze in the form of a veil thrown over a
female head, harks back almost a century to Medardo Rosso. It's an
unusually academic exercise for one so avant-garde, but perhaps
predictable. With success, ephemeral utilitarian cheap lard and soap are
quickly superseded by expensive collectable gold and bronze. It was ever
thus.
More revealing are the colour photos of her parents made up to look
like each other, using latex and mortician's wax. She spent a year
learning from a professional film make-up artist. Like everything she
does, it is thorough and impeccable.
Her best concept is her spectacular performance, Loving Care,
performed at CCA last Thursday, where she becomes a live and lissom
living mop and washes that crowd right out of the room with her long
hair, its thick tresses leaving lovely long looping brush marks across
the floor.
''I use up 35 bottles of Loving Care dye. It's amazing how much power
you can have on your hands and knees. It's a vulnerable position -- but
I clear the room, no problem!''
Her balletic performance challenges the idea of mopping as a female
task as well as the notion of abstract expressionism as a male preserve.
(In the 1950s Yves Klein even painted with women, using their bodies to
smear his canvases.) Antoni's is such a simple brilliant tongue-in-cheek
attack. I can't believe it's not been done before.
Antoni's talent is to confront, to jolt our preconceptions as to
disgusting materials and actions by intellectualising them and making
them elegant. See the lard lipstick display; watch the video; see the
hair-dye painted floor -- but don't on any account miss Butterfly
Kisses, a brainwave picture. It's a small, unostentatious diptych of
little strokes created by her eyelashes.
''I used up lots of Cover Girl Thick Lash mascara to make 1000 strokes
on each page. The left-hand painting is done with my left eyelashes, the
other with my right. It's absurd but fun!'' Simple, logical too. And
perhaps Antoni isn't as heavy about her work after all.

IT was one of those nights characterised by a niggle. In and around
all the explosive energy and voluptuous orchestral textures that filled
the Royal Concert Hall for Saturday night's dazzling programme in which
the Royal SNO was directed by its former principal guest conductor Gary
Bertini, something -- consistently -- was missing.
By and large it was a knock-'em-dead programme; couldn't fail. The
opening of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring was deceptive -- it sounded as
though bassoonist Julian Roberts was going to hold that high opening
note all night, and that we were in for a mega-flexible version. But
when it got going, it went like a bullet.
Bertini's speeds weren't just fast. There was a wildness to them, an
insistent, piledriver quality. And thus a wee touch, eventually, of
diminishing returns. With relative coolness in the slow sections, and
battering relentlessness everywhere else, a certain objectivity began to
build up. For all the brilliant playing, there was a black-and-white
quality to the juggernaut.
That may be okay in the Rite of Spring. It's certainly not okay in
Ravel's Daphnis and Chloe, where much the same approach seemed to apply.
Despite some brilliant playing (though some of the SNO soloists were
not always on form) again a monochrome quality began to creep in.
Partly, at least, it must be connected to the driving approach that
Bertini adopted. He didn't let the music relax and flower.
Those drop-dead gorgeous moments when Ravel dramatically changes the
colour of the entire palette should take the breath away. They just went
by. Very exciting, but all a bit soulless. Ah well.

GLASGOW Museums have been rummaging through the city's treasure trove.
With, sadly, no permanent textile museum, we have to be content with
occasional glimpses of what lies secreted in the museums' locked
cupboards.
The Needle's Prayse, currently at the Burrell, unfolds the hidden
delights of its embroideries of the seventeenth century. Glasgow has a
fine collection, based on Burrell's own.
Burrell had a fine eye for a bargain but little thought as to social
value. Liz Arthur, the creator of this exhibition, has a more modern
sensibility and attempts to tinge our easy enjoyment of pretty things
with a nudge towards a better understanding of their context.
It was a century of extraordinary upheaval. The stitchers embroidered
through two civil wars, the gunpowder plot, a couple of dissolutions of
Parliament, the execution of Charles I, the Great Plague and the Fire of
London.
With this in mind, the array of pretty, pointy-toe shoes, flowered
sweetie bags and hangings gilded with rustic scenes seems alarmingly
serene. Until, that is, the accompanying text allows us to read more
into it all.
Embroidered motifs were rarely innocuous concoctions of pretty
flowers, but symbols chosen with a thorough knowledge of their meanings:
acorns and caterpillars, for example, were Royalist symbols. While the
country struggled against war and disease, these women, and some
professional men, sewed security ''blankets'' which we might easily
mistake for fripperies.
The wide range of work displayed is created with meticulous care.
Baskets are edged with riotous hedgerows of beaded flowers, and caskets
are covered with padded and wired insects and angels, all jostling for
room in a crowd of stitches.
Among real treasures, such as a beautifully-crafted hawking set said
to have belonged to James VI and I, are others made unique by the
quality of the embroidery.
The Needle's Prayse is an exhibition to take your spectacles to, the
better to examine the detail of imagery of 300 years ago, and to leave
grateful that we live after the invention of the sewing machine.
* The Needle's Prayse is at the Burrell Collection, Glasgow to May 14.

IMAGINE that you find yourself living in the middle of a Del Amitri
song: it's one am, your love done has left for ever on the last bus.
Now, with the rain slanting down the back of your neck, you need the
Dels to lead you in a spot of restorative can-kicking. Wipe away a tear
and carry on. Instead, they whoop ''Let's paaarty'', and drag you into a
lunatic conga.
To surround the Dels with a little dry ice (representing the
smoke-filled back room of ennui) is one thing. Great billowing clouds,
punched with shafts of light sufficient to mask the advance of Genghis
and his hordes, are something else.
Socking great bass drums in your head. Guitars churning. This is Rock,
the like of which a metal band would be proud of.
It is a show all right, but it doesn't bring you any closer to a band
whose anthems of dumped-on youth will always make an emotional
connection.
Speaking of which, the macho-swaggering guitar that accompanies Just
Like a Man is too heavy for irony, and the segue from Stuck With Me
(heralded by J as ''politically incorrect'') into Lust For Life is
downright wierd. These, after all, are the Dels, not rabid rockers. And
they needn't think that slinging in Oh You Pretty Things can throw
anyone off the scent.
This show is a blatantly successful, if irritating, attempt at
crowd-pleasing, album-shifting rockarama. Why can't they dwell in sorrow
and obscurity like the rest of us?

AFTER more than a decade of writing about it on this page, I would
hope by now that my prejudices towards modern music are quite clear.
Love the stuff.
Its composers should be profiled and kept firmly in the public eye.
The music itself should be played, listened to, discussed, and written
about. Its consistent performers -- like the Paragon Ensemble -- deserve
acclaim as pioneers.
Having established the framework, then, let me say that what the
Paragon Ensemble played last night, in accompaniment to the screening of
three Charlie Chaplin movies, was just about the biggest heap of junk
I've heard in a long, long time.
If this is the front line, then lead me to the derriere-garde.
Composer Benedict Mason's thesis makes good reading, offering his
music as antidote to mawkishness or sentimentality, or as a revolt
against the ''insipid pastiche'' of Hollywood music.
He refers to his score as containing a ''good-humoured anarchic
rumpus''. Er . . . sorry, it's just a bloody din. Paragon joined two
vocal soloists in shouting, singing, whistling, and banging away on
anything that didn't move.
There are some clever-clever quotes -- from Debussy's La Mer when the
sea is required to be evoked, for example. But for the main part it's
just meaningless noise alongside three films, Easy Street, The
Immigrant, and The Adventurer. Even if the racket provided some sort of
surrealistic counterpoint there would be a point.
The gales of laughter were, I trust, at the films. For me the music
neutralised any humorous effect Chaplin might have had.
Hellish noise.

THOUSANDS of jobs worldwide are expected to be lost in the wake of UK
pharmaceutical giant Glaxo's #9400m takeover of Wellcome.
The largest union at Glaxo has requested a meeting with the company's
chairman, Sir Richard Sykes, to discuss possible job losses.
Analyst reports have set the figure at between 5000 and 15,000,
although a Glaxo spokesman said no decisions had yet been taken.
One report, by Peter Lang of the Salomon Brothers, set job losses at
10,000 -- with heaviest cuts falling on sales departments.
The merged company has an international workforce of 60,000, with
16,500 based in Britain.
The Glaxo spokesman said: ''The aim of the takeover is to create a
world leading British pharmaceutical group, and in the process of
building that company there will inevitably be job losses.
''But it is impossible for us to specific because our offer for
Wellcome only went unconditional last Thursday.''
Paul Talbot, national pharmaceuticals officer for MSF, the largest
staff union at Glaxo and Wellcome, said: ''Staff are paying the price of
the takeover and in some cases local communities will be devastated.
''Worst case scenarios estimate that #200m could be lost from the
local economy around Beckenham if the research and development site
based there closes.
''It is now imperative that the Glaxo chairman, Sir Richard Sykes,
responds to our repeated requests for a meeting. It is intolerable that
at this crucial time for the employees he should continue to ignore
their representatives.''
A newspaper report yesterday suggested #500m would be saved by the
closure of several offices, factories and research centres.
The Wellcome research centre in Beckenham, Kent, may be one of those
to be hit, because Glaxo will open a new #650m centre in Stevenage next
month.

THE Canadians, in their rush to judgment last week in the fish 'n'
ships war, have done us all a favour. Forget the fact, for the moment,
that the legality of their high seas high jinks was dubious when they
seized a Spanish fishing boat in international waters.
All of that can be settled in time. The real lesson from this affair
is the compelling fact that the world is now almost out of fish. A stop
has to be called to the destruction of stocks which survive. Politics
are only a part of this crisis. Biology is the imperative and no-one can
ignore it.
For years now the European Union, in its clumsy but well-meaning way,
has tried to be fair about fishing. It has paid fishermen to go out of
business, reduced allowable catches, talked about the need for
conservation, done its best with aid packages for our fishing
communities.
But it took the political daring of the Canadians to touch a raw nerve
in the EU by hauling in the Estai from international waters and telling
the world of the ship's -- and Spain's -- guilt. That extravagant act
immediately confirmed the reality that, in the EU, fishing is as
politically explosive as it is prosaic.
Fishing, ridiculously, could yet undermine European integration with
greater force than the more fashionable mutterings about a single
currency or the national veto or federalism.
In Strasbourg last week, there was a widespread but unspoken
assumption that the travails of the Estai would turn out to be much more
than just another routine fisheries dispute. Normally voluble Euro-MPs
were suddenly reticent, nervous at the Spanish practices which many of
them suspected the Estai had been up to. True enough, it turned out that
the Estai had stuffed its hold with undersized fish, too young to
reproduce, and was thus engaged in wiping out a species.
The rush to support Spain in the European Parliament was predictable
because the Spanish have sewn up the fisheries committee as might be
expected of a nation which accounts for half of the entire EU fishing
fleet.
Let me try to set the importance of Spanish fishing in context:
Fishing pays the wages of tens of thousands of Spaniards. Spain is the
world's third largest consumer of fish after Japan and Korea. Spain's
fleet is the EU's largest and the fifth biggest in the world.
Spain's 85,000 fishermen trawl the globe, hauling in #1.4b worth of
fish annually. Their efforts keep another 425,000 people in work ashore.
The armada comprises almost 19,000 boats, of which 1140 ply
international waters. Of that total, 1000 fish EU waters. A few of them
will arrive soon in British fisheries from they were previously
excluded. Greenpeace reported recently that, increasingly, the Spanish
boats are using flags of convenience to fish areas denied to the EU.
All in all, the Spaniards are a world power in this failing industry
and you know what they say: the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
The bitter truth for Spain is that the day is now approaching when their
past will catch them up.
All the cheating with nets, all the chasing of wrong species, the
fiddling of catch reports, the hiding of illegal catches, will rebound
on them as the authorities finally wake up to the fact that this planet
is all but fished out.
For the Spanish fishing industry, this is a catastrophe. Spain already
has the worst unemployment in the EU. An enforced scaling down of its
global fishing effort could be enough to finish off the troubled
government of Felipe Gonzalez and ruin Spain's already struggling
currency.
What makes this dispute hot news is that the Canadians have become the
first world fishing power to change sides. With a combination of legal
daring and deft negotiation, they have challenged the reckless
exploitation of fish in the name of conservation and, it must be
admitted, some self-interest. Their methods might yet be held to be
illegal but there is little question that world opinion is behind them
on the conservation issue.
True, the Spanish can dispatch their own gunboats but they will not be
able to withstand the firepower of official inspectors in the days
ahead. As this row simmers and there is talk of talks, the EU is at long
last coming to recognise that control of fisheries, and not just sharing
catches, must be top of the agenda. Fishermen face a future of satellite
surveillance, gunboats, random inspections and all the rest of the
measures required to make sure that fishing nations obey the rules. At
the same time, permitted catches will continue to be reduced.
There is only one conclusion to this process: Spain must face the fact
that it has helped to ruin world fishing stocks and must pay the price
in reducing its fishing effort. The days are passing when Scots and
Bretons and others are paid to leave the sea, only to make way for the
Spanish, who continue to build more boats.
In other words, this is no longer a political problem: biology
dictates that fishing has become a debate about environmental protection
and conservation -- a curious combination whose potency last week
managed to unite such contrasting political forces as the Rev Ian
Paisley and Patricia McKenna, an eloquent Green MEP from the Irish
Republic.
The Estai and her problems could not have come at a worse time for the
EU. In July, by coincidence, the Spanish, the EU's fifth biggest member
state, will take over the running of the community for six months.
Compromise seems unlikely. Stormy weather is forecast.

There have been other efforts but this time the director's gone by the
book, as William Russell discovers
THERE is nothing like starting off on the wrong foot. ''Your first
remake?'' I foolishly said to Gillian Armstrong, director of the latest
Hollywood film based on Louisa May Alcott's Little Women. Nobody would
dream of saying Ralph Fiennes was appearing in the remake of Hamlet.
Armstrong -- My Brilliant Career, The Last Days of Chez Nous -- was
forgiving, although adamant: ''I would never do a remake,'' she said.
''I have turned down a number of scripts which have been made before,
but I felt a personal relationship to Little Women. I also felt here was
a book so important for women which had never been directed by a
woman.''
Armstrong saw the George Cukor film with Katharine Hepburn as Jo as a
child, but had largely forgotten it and has not seen the 1949 version
directed by Melvyn Leroy which had June Allyson as Jo. ''I blocked them
out because if they had been present in my mind I could not have done
this film,'' she said. ''I decided to take it on like a fresh project,
to go back to the book and bring it to life for the nineties.''
Her version is markedly different from its predecessors -- some of the
changes appear to have been inspired by the politically correct demands
of the feminist lobby -- and could be considered Little Wimmin.
Armstrong insisted it was nothing of the kind. ''I do not want people to
think it is some horrible feminist tract,'' she added. ''It is a
wonderful family saga. Half way through the book I thought -- this is
really Louisa's life.''
Women in the cinema were always categorised -- wife, mother, lover,
sex object, she said. Jo's story had given her a chance to make the
character more complicated. ''Jo does not have to be extremely tomboyish
and plain. She can be a very bright young person reaching out and
questioning, wondering where she is going to fit in in the world. She
realises, as an adolescent, that life is not meant to be like that for a
girl. Meg is romantic, has motherly instincts and you feel she is going
to be very happy in her situation, while Amy is vain but ultimately very
practical. She sees the only way to have a good life is to find a rich
man. Beth is special. She was certainly agoraphobic.''
But Jo marries Professor Bhaer and has a family, how did that fit in
with her view of this little career woman? ''I have never felt women
should not be married or not have children,'' she said. ''I have never
been a separatist. All I have ever believed in is equality for women. I
think the feminist movement has always been about opening doors and
choices for both sexes, opening doors about what our roles are.
''Louisa did not want to marry Jo off, but her readers wanted it, and
in the second book, Good Wives, she created this man, Professor Bhaer,
who is in love with Jo. He loves her for what she is, respects her
talent and encourages it. You feel it is going to be a partnership. She
is going to be allowed to continue her work and they are going to run a
business together as partners. He is gentle, humourous and good with
children.''
Some licence had been taken, she admitted. Bhaer, played by the
handsome Irish actor, Gabriel Byrne, is nothing like Alcott's Professor.
The reason is simple. He is required to mate with the exceedingly
beautiful Winona Ryder and has to have some sex appeal. What then about
Winona Ryder's Jo? She hardly meets Alcott's description of her as
homely with one crowning beauty -- her hair. Armstrong said the
actresses surrounding Ryder had ''a traditional Victorian beauty'' and
this made her look ''a bit scrawny''.
She also believed the way they had treated their romance was in
keeping with the book. Alcott had not known how to deal with the
sexuality of their relationship and wrote Bhaer as a bit of a buffoon,
she said. She decided to show Jo was in love and for that there had to
be some sexual attraction. So Bhaer was allowed to be a bit more
sexual.''

THE psychology was a good laugh. Even if most of the class latterly
concluded that the lecturer was probably wired to a different planet
from the rest of us mere student mortals. The art appreciation relied
heavily, of necessity, on slide presentations. We figured that was why
Jackson Pollock was indecipherable. How could you be expected to discern
genius via an elderly projector? So I later went to the Museum of Modern
Art in New York to gaze in wonderment at the originals. Indecipherable,
if you ask me. More recently, there was a brief fling at the
conversational Italian, the better to enjoy the gastronomic delights of
the next holiday. See these evening classes . . . see variety?
And now it seems that the ''adult and continuing education'' market in
Scotland has been so successful that it has to be sabotaged. The
universities running the courses have been asked to go down the same
route as their English counterparts and find ways that these classes can
carry formal accreditation. And they have little choice but to comply,
since the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, which has asked for
the review, is one of their major funders.
For universities like Glasgow, which offers some 750 different
options, that money is crucial, as is the input from Strathclyde Region,
which allows the courses to give fee concessions and do Outreach work in
some of the more deprived areas. Income from fees alone pay for only 35
to 40% of the bill, and bumping up the cost would effectively price the
courses out of the market for the thousands of adults who currently take
advantage of them.
But outside of the financial equation, the attempt to change the whole
ethos of these evening courses is a classic case of fixing something
which ain't broke. Part of the problem is a, doubtless well-intentioned,
but futile, attempt to try to rationalise the kind of courses offered by
the older universities and those who have just acquired that status.
Many of the newer yoonis offered part-time degree courses and they are a
valid and valuable part of the educational menu on offer. But they serve
a completely different purpose and client base. People taking part-time
degree courses are doing so, in the main, to enhance career prospects.
People taking what used to be known as extra-mural classes are doing it
largely for fun and to help stave off winter brain death.
They don't go to language classes to get their Highers, because that
instantly turns a voluntary leisure pursuit into a chore. Neither do
they want to be put into a competitive situation where they have to fret
about the standard of their work.
One of my friends teaches art at these courses. The joy of it for her
-- and there's rather more job satisfaction than fiscal reward for the
lecturers -- is the number of people who are coming along with no prior
knowledge of their own skills; they just want to explore their potential
in an entirely new field. Were these classes accompanied by a formal
review of their progress towards some assumed standard of competence,
most of them would give up. The atmosphere would change, and the core
attraction would essentially be lost.
None of the people involved in the courses has suggested they are
hostile to having some sort of quality control introduced. But they
argue, not illogically, that the worth and success of what they offer
can be judged by the numbers they attract. Around 14,500 take advantage
of the courses at Glasgow, for instance. Many of these are people who
dip into the wonderfully eclectic list of offerings for a new challenge
each winter. Others take advantage of the fact that some courses
continue at ever more advanced levels, and study the one subject more
intensively.
But how many of these courses, outside of the more formally academic
subjects, could reasonably be tied to accreditation? How could you begin
to conclude whether there is more benefit to customer A, who is thrilled
to produce her first painting at the age of 50, or customer B, whose
natural gift for languages would make Higher French a skoosh if she was
obliged to take an exam at the end? Whose mind has been most stretched?
Whose leisure has been most enhanced? Whose delight in personal
development has given the lecturer the most unalloyed pleasure?
Part of the thinking behind the demand from the Scottish Higher
Education Funding Council is apparently that the introduction of
''credit-bearing'' in this sector would be part of the overall strategy
to allow people to gain qualifications which could be largely
interchangeable between educational establishments. The credits would
also form a sort of points system adding up to Highers or ultimately
degrees. Which is perfectly fine if qualifications are what you're
after, but utterly irrelevant to many groups, like senior citizens, who
sign up with entirely different motives.
Neither are many people involved comforted by the SHFC's intimation
that they accept that ''it would be inappropriate'' to try to convert
all the courses in this way.
Doubtless, much the same soothing noises were made in England, and now
some 97% of their extra mural classes are accredited. Yet English
research demonstrated general agreement that one of the priceless assets
of these classes was that the environment was neither stressful nor
threatening. And it is this crucial element which is now being put at
risk in Scotland.
The departments of adult and continuing education now seem to be stuck
between a rock and a very hard place. If they try to protect some of
their courses from unwanted accreditation, will these courses still
attract funding? At a time when Strathclyde Region is about to disappear
and the budgetary priorities of the single tier replacements is unknown,
do they have any choice but to play whatever tune the SHFC, as chief
paymaster of the piper, decides to call?
What they do have in their corner are many thousands of well-satisfied
customers. And it's time for them to stand up and say so.

BOOK OF THE WEEK
THE ORCHESTRA -- THE LIVES BEHIND THE MUSIC
By Danny Danziger
HarperCollins: #16.99
SELDOM has a music book arrived on such a sea of hype. ''The first
book of its kind,'' trumpets the back cover. ''The lives behind the
music,'' roars the subtitle. ''Danny Danziger takes us inside the
intense and fascinating world of the professional musician as no one has
before,'' proclaims the flyleaf.
And so you would think, too, from the coverage already generated by
Danziger's ''survey'' of members of the London Philharmonic. Lurid tales
of bonking, backstabbing and bitching have been hinted at. Musicians
laying everything bare: each other (on tour), their souls, their true
feelings about conductors. Oh yes, a big seller coming up, a book of
exposes with a top-shelf currency.
Right. Well, let's get a few things straight about this farrago of
nonsense. If it's said in no other paper in the land, then let it be
said here. I will tell you exactly what Danziger has done. I will tell
you what he has not done.  We might just tell HarperCollins what they
should have done. (Sent it winging straight back to Danziger on its
submission, for starters.)
Let's kick off by stating, before we get sued, that none of the above
is a reflection on Danny Danziger's capabilities as a writer. And,
m'lud, the clear evidence for that is enshrined in the book itself, of
which the plaintiff -- or author, as he has been referred to in another
place -- has written, outside a short preface, a grand total of 11
words.
Yup, 11 words. And they come at the end of one chapterette where the
musician who has featured therein referred to a recent audition.
Danziger tells us that he passed it.
That apart, what has Danziger done? He has, in a context that remains
undefined, over a period of time interviewed a large number of players
and management personnel in the London Phil. He has also interviewed its
conductor, Franz Welser-Most.
Danziger has obviously stuck his tape recorder in their faces and
asked them a number of questions of the ''How did you get into music;
What's it like playing in the London Phil; What do you think of your
colleagues, conductors, touring etc'' variety. He has then transcribed
the answers, possibly sub-edited them, and regurgitated them one by one.
Er . . .that's it.
And what comes out is, for the most part, deeply uninteresting.
Monumentally boring, even. The musicians remain faceless and
characterless.  No picture of the orchestra as a unit emerges. It is
said in the profession that the London Phil is madder than hell about
this book. No wonder.  You have to hear them. Here's the opening of the
book, punctuation and all.
''We had a piano which my grandma gave us, it was in the front room
for ages, and I never used to touch it. One day, my dad asked, 'Are you
going to play this piano or not?' and I said 'Probably not.' So we
smashed it up, and took it down to the tip -- which is amazing, isn't
it?'' (Er . . . nope.)
And it's downhill from then on. ''I've always been interested in
hitting things,'' says the percussionist. (Oh Gawd.) ''Apparently I
could hum tunes before I could speak -- the Beethoven violin concerto
was a particular favourite.'' (What? Before you could speak?) ''When I
was little, I was fascinated by the egg-slicer in the kitchen. It had
ten wires on it . . .'' (You've guessed it; the harp player.)
''I must tell you about my dog . . . I wanted a dog so much when I was
a child, I used to have a plastic poodle which I would take to Hampstead
Heath, and make it stop to pee at trees.'' (Aye, and woof woof to you,
hen.)
There can't be a musician who talked to Danziger who hasn't cringed at
his or her own deathless monologue, now enshrined in print, poor sods.
And how about this priceless piece of puerile nonsense?
''There's something coming up which is going to be great,'' says
Robert. ''It's Katherine Loynes' thirtieth birthday, and we've got a
photograph of her naked in the Jacuzzi -- with strategic bubbles . . .
We're going to send it round the whole orchestra, and everyone will sign
it, and when it gets passed back to her . . . I can't wait.'' (Pass the
sick bag, Danny.)
En passant, a few conductors get stuffed. And the London Phil --
except by a couple of its players, who reckon the orchestra is in a bad
way and that morale is low -- is praised to the heavens and beyond,
while its musicians ''put more of themselves into the music than any
other band.'' (Yuk.)
So there's not a single editorial comment, not a single attempt to
organise all of this material (most of which -- see above -- is
cobblers) into any coherent form, with any sort of context. It's a
straight transcription job.
Danny boy's book doesn't even get that right.  Emil Gilels becomes
Emil Gill, Wolfgang Sawallisch becomes Cervalisch, Vienna's Musikverein
becomes the Musickwerein, tremelando becomes tremelendo; and so on.
The irritating thing is: there is a book in here somewhere. If Danny
had used his rough notes as such, instead of spewing them on to the
page, he could have organised his raw material. We might have had some
interesting chapters, thematically organised: players on conductors; on
playing with the London Phil; on stage fright; on touring; whatever.
So are we still waiting for the first real ''expose'' of orchestral
life? Dunno. Maybe it will be enshrined in Jilly Cooper's next novel.
Tell you what, though; when that one comes out, watch me and the Royal
SNO dive for cover. We were the research material on a tour of Spain.
Er, Jilly; about that black underwear you bought for the tour . . .

Germaine Greer loves it. Novelist Sally Brampton finds it irritating.
And BBC radio's Liz Forgan thinks it is ''dangerous stuff''. Carol
Clewlow considers the lasting appeal of Little Women
NO-ONE has said it yet, but probably they will, that the new Little
Women is, or at least should be, a Little Women for our times. The first
version to be directed by a woman, it also boasts both female producer
and screenwriter, a fitting tribute to a novel which, in the space of
some 40 years, has gone from being Sunday School prize fodder to classic
feminist text.
The female screenwriter is, of course, nothing new. RKO's first, and
still best-known, 1933 version was written by Sarah Y Mason, who, with
co-writer Victor Heerman, carried off an Academy Award for her work. The
film also had the definitive Jo, in Katharine Hepburn's memorable
performance, and George Cukor, a literate and sophisticated director, a
man blessed with that particular lightness of touch that so
distinguished the great Hollywood directors of the time. The re-make 16
years later, directed by Mervyn Le Roy, was the opposite of everything
which had gone before; syrupy, leaden and hopelessly miscast (Elizabeth
Taylor, Peter Lawford).
It's perhaps as well, then, that Little Women's latest director,
Gillian Armstrong has no memory of the re-make, and indeed, very little
of the original, both of which she saw as a child. Armstrong, whose
version has grossed more than $48 million since its Christmas opening,
told one interviewer: ''I felt that it's such an important book for
women . . . It has become a story that's been passed down from
generation to generation of women.''
It's certainly true that the novel has a female rites of passage feel
about it, one of those respectable books, handbooks of life, almost,
handed down by the hopeful to daughters and nieces, and read by most
women, certainly of my fortysome-thing generation, at one time or
another.
The affection in which it is held by so many, and of such disparate
taste, still astonishes. What astonishes more, though, is that, looked
at today, particularly in the light of what is now known about the
author's life, Little Women can be seen to possess, beneath its surface
of homily and proper and pious living, a distinctly subversive quality;
the same quality, undoubtedly, that has kept it selling, in the face of
all the odds, for more than a century, and which has now elevated it to
the dizzy heights of feminist classic.
Louisa May Alcott was born in 1832, into the same sort of family of
sisters that she so faithfully portrayed in Little Women. Her father was
the eminent Transcendentalist thinker and social reformer, Bronson
Alcott.
Transcendentalism, in essence a philosophy which emphasised intuition
in the search for knowledge and stressed the importance of the search
for the divine, brought Bronson the acclaim of other distinguished
thinkers of the time, such as Emerson and Thoreau. It failed though,
manifestly, to pay the bills.
Earning the money to keep the family fed fell first of all to Louisa's
mother, Abba May, the model for the Marmee so beloved of the Marches,
who worked in a variety of occupations despite her eight pregnancies in
10 years.
Thus Louisa was brought up in the twin notions, not just of the
naturalness and necessity of female work, but also of its essential
dignity, its rightful place at the very core of the life of any woman of
spirit. ''. . . I'm not going to sit and wait for any man to give me
independence, if I can earn it for myself,'' her heroine Christie says
in the little-known adult novel, Work, published four years after Little
Women.
A few pages later, as if writing about herself, Alcott says of
Christie that she was ''one of that large class of women who, moderately
endowed with talents, earnest and true-hearted, are driven by necessity,
temperament or principle, out into the world to find support, happiness
and homes for themselves''.
In Jo's determination to find a publisher for her stories to help with
the family finances in Little Women, we can see the author herself.
Indeed the feverish rush in which she wrote the novel -- it was
completed in a matter of weeks -- was precipitated by pressing family
debts, all of which she managed to pay off with the proceeds.
Armstrong has stressed the importance for her of the male characters
in Little Women, regretting that, for so long, it has frightened off
male readers because of its reputation as a woman's book. She calls it:
''A wonderfully epic tale about family where the men's roles are just as
important and as deeply involved in the story.'' It's something with
which I have to disagree.
For it does not take any heady dive into psychotherapy to make the
connection between Mr March, a preacher and teacher in the tradition of
Bronson and away doing his duty in the war, and the man himself, locked
away meditating in his study, or off on one of his frequent lecture
tours. Certainly, rather like Mr Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, Bronson
is celebrated more by his absence than his actual presence in the bosom
of his family.
''I'm the father of the family now papa is away,'' Jo says, echoing
her creator, who often spoke of herself in the same vein. And while the
pages of Little Women are full of hero-worship for the ''quiet studious
man, rich in wisdom that is better than learning'', the ''paternal
priest'', teaching ''his flock the hard lessons all must learn'', the
preacher of ''simple sermons that went straight to the heart of those
who listened'', still it is the unwritten tension between the public
face of the guru, and the private reality of his continued absence from
home that lies at the heart of the novel.
''The family is the sensitive plant of civility, the measure of
culture,'' wrote Bronson, who had a deep reverence for the institution.
And, as if dutifully parroting his opinion, the March girls, under
Louisa's pen, marry suitably and sensibly, in a way of which even Jane
Austen would have approved.
Still it is true that among the most passionate lines penned by Alcott
in Little Women is a ringing defence of spinsterhood, coupled with the
request that they receive the respect to which they are due. ''. . .
Recollect the good aunts,'' instructs the narrator, ''who have not only
lectured and fussed, but nursed and petted, too, often without thanks .
. . ''
''An old maid -- that's what I am to be,'' she has Jo cry. ''A
literary spinster, with a pen for a spouse.'' Which is what Louisa
became. She never married, dying at 56, literally worn out from
providing for her family. She claimed never to have understood the
success of Little Women, always maintaining that she wrote it ''to prove
that I could not write books for girls. The publisher thought it flat
and so did I . . . ''
In the same way, she steadfastly refused to regard her own craft as
anything more than a money-making exercise. ''. . . Though I do not
enjoy writing 'moral tales' for the young, I do it because it pays well
. . . '' she wrote in a letter. And yet that craft is apparent on every
page, never more so than in the person of Professor Bhaer whose
intervention prevents Jo from lapsing into literary spinsterhood.
Alcott complained afterwards that she had never wanted Jo to marry,
and later publicly castigated all such publishers as her own for their
refusal to ''let authors finish up as they like but insist on having
people married off in a wholesale manner which much afflicts me''.
Still, in that rain-drenched scene between Jo and Bhaer, in another of
those ambiguities that lie at the heart of her work, she created one of
the most touching and tender moments to have graced a novel, not to
mention one of the world's great romantic lines. ''Heart's dearest,''
cries Bhaer at exactly the right moment, ''why do you cry?''
It's hard to escape the conclusion, which others have come to, that
the older, unconventional hero was one who suited Louisa as well as her
heroine.
* Little Women, starring Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, and Gabriel
Byrne, opens in Scotland on Friday. Work is published in the Penguin
classics series, Little Women by Oxford in its World's Classics.
Carol Clewlow is a novelist. The latest of her four books is One For
The Money (Michael Joseph).

IRISH and Jewish voters in America are a formidable force, as John
Major did not need reminding when he finally called back President
Clinton on the phone yesterday. But the President may well have pointed
out that he has just got Israeli-Syrian talks re-started; and he thinks
he has given a powerful nudge to the other peace process, for Northern
Ireland.
Not a bad week's work, they believe in the White House. They have just
given Gerry Adams what he has craved, the same sort of world status for
Sinn Fein as PLO chairman Yasser Arafat has been accorded by the United
States. Too bad if it meant wrong-footing Major, who happened to be
visiting Arafat at the time.
No matter that Arafat has started negotiations with Israel, having
renounced violence. No matter that Adams is a long way off conceding IRA
arms before he can negotiate with Britain. No matter that the clear
message from Gaza, where Arafat has his headquarters, is that armed
terrorists can still screw up negotiations and further impoverish the
population.
President Clinton seized on Adams' first use of the word
''decommissioning'' in regard to IRA weapons as sufficient reason for a
St Patrick's Day beano which has set the dollars rolling again legally
into Sinn Fein's coffers. Poor Major; the Clinton propaganda exercise
almost wrecked his own propaganda venture in the Middle East.
It was only when Sinn Fein chairman Michael McLoughlin came out and
said he didn't know what all the fuss was about -- that Adams was saying
nothing new when he spoke of decommissioning -- that the President
suspected that he might be taken for a ride again. So some good may now
come out of it.
The upshot was that Clinton, and those of his advisers who took him
down this road in the first place, were obliged to go further than they
originally intended in pressurising Adams into serious talks about a
weapons hand-over. Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein negotiator, said
yesterday that such talks will come within a fortnight.
One more meeting with Northern Ireland officials is scheduled -- to
talk about prisoners -- before Sinn Fein answers the agenda that our
negotiator, Michael Ancram, has prepared for them for ''exploratory''
and ''non-negotiating'' talks. The ball, as they say, is now firmly in
the court of the political wing of the IRA. They must commit themselves
to not just a hand-over, but how they propose to do it.
Nothing less will do for the British Government, particularly after
the latest display of Clinton-style diplomacy. But will it do for the
Ulster Unionist leader Jim Molyneaux, who was forced to endure a
challenge to his leadership on Saturday? A stalking horse student
candidate massed 14% of the vote, enough to make it more difficult for
him to acquiesce in eventual talks with Sinn Fein.
Perhaps sensing this, the Irish premier, John Bruton, who had his own
talks with the President, declared yesterday that it is essential for
the republican movement to make a ''clear and definite offer'' on their
weapons.
''It is politically essential if there are to be talks opened up
between all of the communities,'' he added. ''It must be done and
soon.'' This would certainly strengthen the hand of Molyneaux, who is
not by any means ready to help bring down the Major Government on an
agenda, or at a time, that suits the Labour Party.
It is beginning to look as though the only votes that Major will get
in the May and April local elections are sympathy votes. There he is,
trying to do what he thinks is right on Northern Ireland and all the
issues that confront him, but with each week that goes by, he finds that
events are dictating his ability to manoeuvre.
He wants to boast about the consistently good economic figures, but
his Chancellor lets slip a truism -- that ordinary ''Middle England''
folk will not feel the benefits until after the next General Election.
He wants to demonstrate that he has set a political course that will
unite his party and attract the voters, but Lord McAlpine, the
Thatcherite former party Deputy Chairman, undermines him.
Major, he says, has ''stuffed'' the party and, unless he changes
course, he will find himself in Opposition. Mind you, he adds helpfully,
it is the electorate who should dump a Prime Minister, not the Tory
Party. The ironies pile up on the political scene.
An inadvertent President Clinton may have shoved Adams into faster
co-operation on decommissioning. Lord McAlpine, for a day or two,
appeared to unite the Tories, at least in public, in defence of Major
against his attack. Well they would, wouldn't they? Even his old chum
and fellow Thatcherite, Lord Parkinson, distanced himself from
McAlpine's trenchant line.
The unity was short-lived. The Euro-sceptics were at it again, working
out their bile against the Chancellor, Ken Clarke, for his speech the
other day. He dared to suggest that the European Union can have monetary
union without rushing headlong into federalism.
The right-wing Conservative Way Forward, published yesterday, states:
''By pushing his own agenda in favour of a single currency, Clarke is
not only preventing the party from voicing its true instincts but also
undermining the authority of the Prime Minister. If he cannot toe the
line, he should resign.'' They want to undermine Clarke in order that he
should not be in a position to challenge their man, Michael Portillo,
for the leadership if the moment comes.
Portillo, young enough to bide his time, was po-faced about it all
yesterday. The single currency debate is history, he said, since the
Prime Minister had laid down a line for Cabinet. ''The time for factions
is now passed,'' he added. ''We are getting too close to the election
for factional struggle. What we need to do is to turn our guns on the
enemy, the Labour Party.''
About a hundred Tory MPs of the '92 Group, not all of them
right-wingers, are supposedly meeting tonight to determine a strategy
for the local elections. Tomorrow, the Labour Party seeks to aggravate
Tory troubles in a Commons debate on the Common Agricultural Policy of
the EU.
The Government is not doing enough to reform this hugely costly
arrangement, Labour claims, in the sure knowledge that this is the view
of the majority of Tories. We shall see how driven the Tories are, on or
off the whip, by a desire for unity and survival.
In his way, Tony Blair, who supports Major on Northern Ireland, is
trying to do a Clinton on him on all other issues.

WE do not know if the right-wing Conservative Way Forward MPs frighten
the Labour enemy, but how they must frighten their colleagues. It is not
so much the opinions which they hold; anyone is entitled, after all, to
hold and express any opinions which are not against the law of the land.
The problem with Conservative Way Forward, whose president is Lady
Thatcher and whose leaders include Lords Tebbit and Parkinson, is the
distastefully personal nature of its manner of attacking those with whom
it disagrees. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, is the
latest target for intemperate abuse. An editorial in the organisation's
newsletter accuses the Chancellor of undermining the Prime Minister, of
pushing his own agenda, and of insulting the intelligence of party
members. Implicit in every venomous word is the demand that the
Chancellor should resign, and willing, indeed anxious, to accept
responsibility for the editorial is Sir George Gardiner, the notably
acidic MP for Reigate. The attack on the Chancellor has nothing to do
with his newly developed talent for making silly mistakes over the
non-existence of steel and nappy production in Consett. It is only
partly to do with his views on a single currency or the timing of tax
cuts. Rather it is a recognition that as an able and experienced
politician at the centre of the party he represents a considerable
bulwark against the sort of policies espoused by Conservative Way
Forward and the equally extreme 92 Group of Tory MPs.
The policies in question can be symbolised by the continuing tussles
within the Conservative Party over Europe and the conduct of the
economy. Yet even defining the areas of disagreement in this way
contrives to miss the real point of much of the Conservative disunity in
recent months. While there is undoubtedly disagreement on several
issues, the core of the argument (which is largely unspoken, at least in
public) rests on the question as to what sort of political party the
Conservative Party should be. To describe the division as being between
the one-nation conservatism of the sixties and seventies and the
Thatcherite and post-Thatcherite eighties and nineties is wide of the
mark, but it represents a starting point of sorts. One-nation
conservatism, although a handy and sometimes comforting phrase, does not
really represent the views of the Chancellor as many of the arguments
have moved on. Nevertheless, in its essence it sets forth the ideas of
society and community, with all that implies in mutual obligation and
service, which are largely acceptable to Mr Clarke, Mr Michael
Hesletine, and younger, talented Ministers like Mr Tim Eggar and Mr
Stephen Dorrell.
It is perfectly proper for politicians to argue and debate over what
they see as the future of their party. There is though, as we have seen
in recent months, an unfortunate tendency for the dispute to spill over
into the governance of the country with highly detrimental results.
The conduct of the debate on Europe alone has diminished the status of
Britain within the European Union and abroad and has led the
increasingly powerful money markets to take actions which have affected
sterling. The process will continue this week, as the 92 Group meets
today to discuss the state of the party, and tomorrow when the
Government faces a difficult vote on the Common Agricultural Policy.
There is merit in diversity but it is increasingly important, for both
the Conservative Party and the nation, that this struggle over the
future identity of the party be, first of all, acknowledged, then
resolved.

Bruce McKain, Law Correspondent, examines the growing disquiet over
Scotland's appeal court system as critics claim it is hidebound by legal
technicalities
IN A PERFECT legal system the innocent would never be convicted and
the guilty would never escape their just desserts. Since our legal
system is some way short of that standard, the Court of Criminal Appeal
is entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that justice does not
miscarry.
If the critics, many within the legal profession, are to be believed,
their lordships are falling down on the job.
While in Scotland we have not suffered the spectacular Birmingham
Six-type miscarriages which have embarrassed the English system, there
are numerous cases where injustice is alleged.
The recent appeals of George Beattie and Alan Church have focused
critical attention on the appeal court, but the case of John McLay,
convicted of murder in 1992, caused equal disquiet, although it got
nothing like as much publicity.
They all raise the critical issue of whether the appeal court is
allowing the law to get in the way of justice by taking too narrow and
legalistic a view of its function. Following his conviction, McLay, a
19-year-old Glasgow man, produced sworn statements from six witnesses
who claimed that another man, former co-accused Stephen Harkins, had
confessed to the killing.
By a majority of 4-1 the Court of Criminal Appeal refused to let McLay
lead this new evidence because it was hearsay and inadmissible under
present rules.
The majority of the judges, led by Lord Justice-Clerk Ross, decided
that if the hearsay rule meant that evidence of genuine confessions were
excluded from a jury's consideration, that could be justified on grounds
of public policy.
The judges were concerned about the danger of an accomplice trying to
get an accused off by giving concocted evidence of false or non-existent
confessions.
The strongly dissenting opinion came from Lord McCluskey, who accused
his fellow judges of failing to attach enough importance to the most
important public-policy point of all -- that the court should do all it
could to avoid convicting the innocent.
Last month the Scottish Law Commission supported Lord McCluskey's view
and recommended legislation to relax the hearsay rule, but whether that
can alleviate McLay's plight remains to be seen.
Long before the case of George Beattie got to the appeal court there
had been a sustained and highly public campaign to establish his
innocence. The expectation which had built up outside the court that
Beattie would win his appeal made the shock of his losing all the
greater and the criticism of the appeal court all the more bitter.
Looking at the case dispassionately, there is an argument for saying
that the appeal court was right to uphold Beattie's conviction.
One of the problems with the case was that allegations of dishonesty,
incompetence, or suppression of evidence at the time of Margaret
McLaughlin's murder in 1973 not only were not put to the appeal court
but were expressly disowned by Mr Donald Findlay, QC, Beattie's counsel.
That left the appeal court to deal with what was presented to it,
which is all it can do. The evidence was thin, but arguably, enough to
convict.
Beattie's solicitors, Joe Beltrami and Murray Macara, are now
assiduously gathering fresh evidence in the case.
Following the appeal, Mr Paul McBride, Beattie's junior counsel, made
an interesting point about the appeal court.
''The English system makes it easier to investigate miscarriages of
justice than the very technical approach adopted in Scotland,'' argued
Mr McBride.
''The time has now come to consider whether the function of the appeal
court in Scotland ought to be dramatically changed to apply the English
test of whether a conviction is unsafe and unsatisfactory.''
The English approach is broadly to ask whether a jury ought to have
convicted, while the Scottish court asks whether the jury was entitled
to convict. The Scottish test makes it more difficult to go behind a
verdict, even though there is a general feeling that the jury got it
wrong.
Perhaps the constant carping about the system nettled Lord
Justice-General Hope, our senior judge, and persuaded him to do
something about it. It would certainly be one explanation of the rather
odd way in which he and Lord Ross came to be at odds over the crucial
issue of fresh evidence.
How does the appeal court deal with cases where someone comes along
after his conviction claiming to have discovered new evidence which
casts serious doubt on his guilt? Lord Ross outlined what everyone
thought was the law in 1987 when he said: ''To be the basis of an
alleged miscarriage of justice it must be shown that the additional
evidence which was not heard at the trial was not available, and could
not reasonably have been made available.'' This approach was followed in
a number of cases (including some in which Lord Hope sat).
But last month in the case of Alan Church, jailed for eight years for
a building-society robbery, Lord Hope stunned everyone, including the
Crown Office, by deciding that Church could appeal on the basis of
''new'' video-enhancement evidence even though it could have been used
at the trial.
He decided that Church had a ''reasonable excuse'' for not producing
the ''new'' evidence earlier. This echoed the words used in the
equivalent English legislation, arguably making it significantly easier
to get fresh-evidence appeals off the ground south of the Border.
A week later, Lord Ross, in another fresh-evidence case, stated: ''I
have to say that some members of this court have some doubts about the
case of Church.'' The upshot was that five judges (strangely enough, not
including Lord Hope) sat last week to decide whether the law is what
everyone thought it for the past 15 years.
The impression has certainly been given that Lord Hope has gone out on
a limb which his five colleagues may be about to saw off.
Lord Hope's colleagues may take the view that if there is something
wrong with the Scottish system it is up to Parliament to put things
right.
The ultimate answer may be an independent body to which alleged
miscarriages of justice can be referred and this has already been
recognised by Lord Ross in a highly significant speech he made four
years ago. ''In my view the stage has been reached when consideration
should be given to the establishment of an independent body which could
be invited by the Court of Appeal or the Secretary of State to carry out
independent investigations into the circumstances of the conviction.
''For example, if an allegation is made that police witnesses have
given false evidence, the Court of Appeal should be empowered to call on
some independent body other than the police force concerned to inquire
into the matter.
''I have to recognise that in recent years, particularly south of the
Border, but also in Scotland, grounds have existed for calling justice
into question. It is imperative that adequate steps should be taken as
soon as possible to ensure that grounds no longer exist for questioning
any of the systems of justice which apply within the United Kingdom.''
Given these sentiments, it is entirely appropriate that Lord Ross is
currently a member of the Sutherland Committee set up by the Government
to examine the criteria applied by the Court of Criminal Appeal and
procedures for handling alleged miscarriages of justice.
The committee's report, due by July 1996, will be awaited with great
interest by the Bench as well as those sitting in the dock or
languishing in a prison cell.

Nicholas Powell reports how Jacques Chirac, prematurely dismissed as a
gallant loser in the French presidential elections, has, through his
legendary capacity for hard work, risen to favourite in the Elysee race
TIPPED by the polls as the man most likely to be elected President in
May, Jacques Chirac has been variously compared, on account of his
resilience and capacity for hard work, to a robot, a computer, and a
bulldozer. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, his right-wing rival for the
Elysee, impressed by so much single-mindedness and ambition, once
described him as ''a man programmed for power''.
Others have noticed the same qualities. Thirty years ago, when Chirac
was a surprisingly young adviser at the Elysee, President Georges
Pompidou joked that if he asked him to dig a tunnel from the Elysee
under the Seine, it would get done overnight.
Since then, Chirac's career has been brilliant. He became MP for his
home region of Correze, in the centre of France, in 1967, aged 35. He
founded the RPR Gaullist party in 1976 as a vehicle to take him to the
Elysee and was elected to the recently created post of Mayor of Paris in
1977 -- a convenient position from which to entertain high-status guests
under two successive Presidents. This is his third attempt for the
presidency, and, given his age, doubtless the last.
After several months of campaigning, during which the polls cast him
as loser, public opinion has swung strongly in his favour -- the pay-off
for his busy campaign strategy of meetings and walkabouts throughout the
country. Chirac has forged himself an image beside which Balladur
appears elitist and bland.
Those close to him, beginning with his daughter Claude who handles his
press relations, say Chirac is a bundle of contradictions who has found
himself over the past couple of years hurt by private tragedy -- his
elder daughter Laurence, suffering from anorexia, committed suicide --
and professional betrayal. Last year, Balladur's own ambitions for the
Elysee became evident. He broke a pact, according to Chirac's followers,
not to stand as presidential candidate, leaving Chirac, for years the
RPR's official choice, to watch many of his oldest political allies
desert him for the more promising Balladurian camp.
Convinced that central government has become remote from people's real
preoccupations, Chirac has given his campaign a distinctly populist
tone. It is based to a large extent on concern for social problems such
as unemployment and poverty and the premise that the notions of left
wing and right wing are obsolete. It has proved an ingenious political
stance which both cuts the feet from under the socialists and communists
and is critical of Balladur's government record.
Chirac's background has helped him enormously in his campaign. Born in
a comfortably upper-middle-class family, he has always felt at ease with
the man in the street. He adores walkabouts and can happily and
unaffectedly chat to voters in cafes over a drink. He is, on the other
hand, nervous and aggressive on television and uncomfortable in
middle-class salons: once, at a bridge party given by former President
Giscard d'Estaing, he got his table to play mere whist through sheer
provocation.
Chirac's tastes also have a popular touch. While living in a huge
sixteenth-century chateau in Correze, he has a predilection for solid
country cuisine, washed down not with wine but beer. Tripe, calf's head,
and pigeon are said to be among his favourite dishes. He also enjoys
Westerns, detective novels and is versed in Japanese art, especially
Sumo wrestling. He has, nevertheless, an inferiority complex about not
being a deeply cultivated man and is capable of swotting up on subjects
overnight to appear well-informed for official exhibitions, a habit he
picked up under the highly cultivated Georges Pompidou, whom he revered.
Acknowledged by the Gaullist establishment as a true embodiment of
their ideals (the general's closest former colleagues keep him informed
when they feel he has deviated from their expectations), and despite his
recent conversion to social concern, Chirac remains a man of the right.
His career has been shaped not only by an uncommon degree of ambition
but also a fundamental hostility to socialism and communism. He is also
deeply allergic to the extreme right and has repeatedly refused in
recent years to have the slightest contact with National Front leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen.
Prime Minister to President Giscard d'Estaing from 1974 to 1976 (when,
sensing a better opportunity, he resigned to create the RPR), he was
again Premier at the head of a conservative Government under President
Mitterrand between 1986 to 1988. His Government embarked on an ambitious
programme of privatisation under Finance Minister Balladur -- a man
appointed by Chirac and whom he naively hoped would serve his ambitions
for the Elysee.
A man of personal loyalty, Chirac, who now feels betrayed by Balladur,
has himself committed some very calculated acts of political treachery.
In 1974 he caused the Gaullist candidate Jacques Chaban-Delmas to lose
the presidential election by withdrawing his support. His mitigated
support of President Giscard d'Estaing after the first round of voting
in the presidential poll of 1981 was also partly responsible for the
victory of Francois Mitterrand. Chirac subsequently emerged as the
leading personality of right-wing opposition to the socialist regime.
After his own defeat in the 1988 election, Chirac slowed down his
frenetic schedule of political meetings and adopted a better-paced
approach to his work. One of his closest colleagues said: ''Despite
appearances, he is not a happy man. He is always anxious, and to
maintain his equilibrium he uses the bicycle technique: he can only find
his balance when he is on the move.''

elitist and bland'

Kirsty Scott examines how the seal of confession can create for
priests a conflict of duties between confidentiality and social
responsibility
HEAD bowed, hesitant with shame, a young girl tells a priest in the
confines of the confessional box that her father is abusing her. The
priest does nothing, and watches, wracked with guilt, until her mother
discovers the truth.
It's part of the plot from a controversial new film, Priest, which was
released on Friday, but it's also a very real dilemma for the priesthood
and for a culture which tends to place responsibility to society above
personal or religious codes.
The official line from the Catholic Church is that the seal of the
confessional is, has to be, sacrosanct, but there are some within the
church who would like to see it have a broader interpretation, depending
on the circumstances of the confession.
In the film, the priest, Father Greg, tries unsuccessfully to persuade
the girl, Lisa, to let him deal with the matter. He seeks help from a
colleague who suggests he drop a vague hint to the girl's mother and
teacher. It fails. He tries to tackle the father but is told to mind his
own business. He makes a call to social services but replaces the
receiver when they answer.
In one scene he falls to his knees and screams at a crucifix: ''The
secrecy of confession! How can that be good when it allows evil to
thrive?''
Sister Mary Ross, of the Notre Dame centre in Glasgow, has experience
of dealing with young victims of abuse. She watched a preview of the
film with other church officials last week.
''It was at its most powerful when it raised the big issue about the
confessional,'' she said afterwards. ''It is often within that kind of
setting, not just the confessional, but the church setting, that someone
will begin to say what's happening to them, particularly young people.
''I think it's what happens to an awful lot of people. They are aware
something dreadful is going on and they are not allowed by that person
to speak.''
Sister Mary believes the church will never shift its position on the
seal but would like to see a broader interpretation of it in certain
circumstances.
''I'm sure there's a lot of answers to the dilemma. Churchwise they're
all illegal. Of course, the church will always uphold the seal of
confession. I think it's the last bastion.
''I would like priests and the church to be able to look at the
original meaning of the seal of confession to protect the sinner. The
girl in the film was not confessing a sin. I think priests have to be
helped to look at it differently.''
The church's Scottish spokesman, Father Tom Connelly, said many have
adopted Sister Mary's position, but the seal was not open to
interpretation.
''The seal of confession is so precious. There is no answer to that as
long as you want the extraordinary power that is the confessional. It
has to be absolutely safeguarded.''
Father Tom said many priests will face similar dilemmas but the church
was very clear about what they could and could not do. The options
include trying to persuade the person to talk outside the confessional
and seeking help from colleagues.
''I think there are very few priests who would not at some time in the
ministry face a wretched dilemma; what's important is that a priest in a
situation like that, where he is faced with a crucifying torture for
himself knows he can go to a fellow priest and get strength and support
without discussing the problem.''
According to Dr Geoff Scobie, an expert in psychology and religion at
Glasgow University, Father Greg's crisis is similar to dilemmas faced by
doctors and lawyers.
''This is the dilemma all the time with any sort of confidence. At
what point does your responsiblity to the person confiding cease and
when does your responsibility to the wider community take precedence? It
leaves the confessor in a very difficult situation, especially if the
consequences of him doing nothing is that something dire comes about. I
don't think there's an easy solution to it.''
The man who wrote Priest, Jimmy McGovern, of Cracker fame, said he had
been fascinated by the idea of the confessional dilemma for some time.
Personally, he saw no way out for Father Greg, no avenue for him except
dropping a hint and praying it did the trick.
''My kind of argument is: supposing priests in the past had spoken
out,'' he said. ''Lisa would never have gone to him.''
Reaction to the theme has been mixed, with many women questioning
McGovern on why Father Greg refused to do more for Lisa. The issue is
complicated by the fact that the film also portrays Father Greg
struggling with his own homosexuality and eventually breaking the vow of
celibacy.
''Of the women that I have spoken to, quite a few of them have said
that Greg should have done something more. Quite what he could have done
I don't know; I'm at a total loss.''
At Strathclyde Regional Council's Social Work Department an official
pondered the dilemma and suggested it would be helpful if priests were
given similar training to counsellors for Childline, who often have to
advise children who are calling anonymously what they can do to get
help.
Simon Hughes has no illusions about the dilemmas which may face him
when he is ordained as a priest in Glasgow in three months time, but he
believes the confessional seal will not stop him from helping people the
best he can.
His six years of training have included counselling techniques and
role-playing in a variety of difficult situations.
''When it comes to the confessional situation then, yes, I am bound by
the confidentiality of the situation. As part of the process I would
recommend, or advise, or strongly suggest that the person get
appropriate help. I would consider it my duty to do that.
''What I understand is that whatever the person says to you in the
confessional situation, whether it is a sin or not, it's within the
confessional situation, therefore you are bound to confidentiality about
it. The fact the person came into that situation means they are looking
for some kind of confidentiality to be respected but they are looking
for help as well.
''Whereas I do appreciate the complexity and the pain of a situation
like that, I think it's the only situation where confidence is
completely to be respected.

THE Queen is on a week-long visit to South Africa, her first in almost
half a century. The first visit was on the eve of the country's lurch
into apartheid, a formal system of laws and regulations separating
racial groups, many of which had operated in effect before but with far
less rigour. This visit is after apartheid has been abolished. In
between, South Africa left the Commonwealth in anticipation of its
expulsion. It is now on the way back in, a development bound to delight
Her Majesty, as it will many people here and in South Africa itself. The
British connection is not the oldest European one in South Africa's
history for the Dutch East India Company planted a colony at what is now
Capetown in 1652. Most of its settlers actually were of German origin
(from the Rhineland) but the Dutch imposed their own culture on them and
absorbed an important French contingent in the 1680s. The British did
not take over until the era of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars and
did not send colonists until five years after Waterloo. Less than a
century later the country's boundaries were what they are today and it
was independent of British rule.
South Africa has been run since 1910 by residents but their rule was
racially restricted. The opportunity to build upon the colour-blind
franchise which operated in Cape Colony itself was rejected (even before
formal apartheid) but is operating now. The Queen will be visiting a
democratic state, one of the few in the continent: though most African
states would lay claim to that status almost none deserve it. The
paradoxical fact is that the white minority and its collaboration with a
liberal black elite has given the country a unique opportunity to build
a modern multi-racial society. The economic base is extractive and
industrial: the first element provided an initial flow of locally
generated capital which funded the second (often originally to ensure
jobs for poor whites). No other economy south of the Sahara has such a
structure as well as a highly developed agrarian regime. South Africa
needs foreign capital -- it remains a developing economy -- but Mr Pik
Botha's speech at the Copenhagen summit on poverty was accurate enough
in identifying its potential role in generating development beyond its
own frontiers.
If the Queen arrives at a time of possible economic expansion, in
spite of huge problems, she will also encounter a political experiment
which remains coloured by optimism. South Africa proved to be no
exception to the continental rule when it came to its first free
elections -- most voters followed tribal lines, though the Cape Coloured
vote went firmly to the National Party. The African National Congress
managed to win some support in every racial group. Its co-operation with
the National Party has carried that aspect of its identity forward and
is the bedrock of the country's stability. The Queen will meet again the
two men mainly responsible for this achievement, President Mandela and
Vice-President de Klerk. The first has made an astonishing impact on
world and domestic opinion; the second remains vital to his success in
carrying the white community into what has been no less than a
revolution without shedding blood. Can it all last? The foundation for
optimism certainly exists; and the Queen will see it first-hand.

AS that talented Scottish actor Bill Riddoch made his debut as an
after-dinner speaker the other evening, I was struck once again by his
uncanny resemblance, in style and demeanour, to my own father.
In one respect, of course, he was my father -- the part he played in
the BBC's 1987 drama-documentary As Time Goes By, which portrayed scenes
from my Aberdeenshire childhood of the thirties and forties.
Though I wrote the film, I left casting to the experts. But I did put
in a special request for two of the characters -- Eileen McCallum to
play the indomitable Lizzie Allan and fellow-Aberdonian Bill Riddoch to
play my father.
What I didn't know at the time was that his father, Willie Riddoch,
was the same Aberdeen cattle dealer who used to buy his animals at the
ringside of Maud Mart where my father was the auctioneer.
In reality, young Bill had never seen John Webster but from the
quality of his performance he might have been studying him all his life.
Whether he was ploughing the field with a horse, pausing for a word with
his son coming home from school or verbally jousting with Lizzie Allan
in her village sweetie-shop, the television performance was fine
testimony to his instinct as an actor. It could not have come closer to
the true nature of my father.
Speaking of whom, it was hard to take in that he would have been 90 on
Saturday. At my earliest memory he had not yet reached 30, a bustling
personality, the very sight of whose restless activity tended further to
drain the more listless disposition of his pallid son, who was often
bewildered by the mixture of fiery temper and glorious good humour.
I was less than popular, that day in 1938, when he contracted my dose
of measles at the age of 33 and the pair of us lay isolated in one bed.
As a restless, impossible patient he received a letter from a kindly old
lady who sympathised with the fact that he was suffering from ''a
measle''.
''A measle?'' he exploded, his red-spotted face turning purple.
''Ah've thoosans o' the buggers!''
On that stage of the Aberdeenshire cattle country he was a central
character, powerful performer in the auctioneer's rostrum, unsurpassed
as an agricultural authority.
He was in demand as guide and philosopher to many a crofter and small
farmer seeking to establish himself with a home and a way of life for
his wife and family. He believed in the right of the diligent farm
worker to acquire his own bit land and savour independence, however hard
that road might be.
He himself had come from a small tenancy at New Deer, his
self-reliance put to the test at the age of eight when he took on the
responsibility of his widowed mother, his small brother, and their few
cattle in the byre.
It forged a man of such judgment and determination that he was well
equipped to help others by the time he was into his twenties, scouring
the countryside on his motor-bike, as the young auctioneer seeking
cattle for his particular mart at Maud, just one of three in the village
at that time.
It prepared him for that day, in his forties, when he would feel
confident enough to borrow every penny required to buy the farm of his
dreams. Honeyneuk became his pride and joy for the rest of his life,
though he also continued in the role of Buchan auctioneer until
retirement age, exactly 25 years ago this week.
Rural life could instil in human beings a peculiar sense of the
immortal, a kind of unspoken spirituality in which the dividing line
between life and death was not the matter of obsessive concern which
creates so much neurosis today.
Indeed, it took the premature passing of my mother and a few warning
shots to himself before he ever acknowledged, even then in the most
oblique fashion, that he might, just possibly, not live for ever.
It was revealed to me in an instruction of what I was to do ''if
onything ever happens tae me''. Once more, his instincts were
immaculate. That day came 18 years ago when, with an eeriness of timing,
the black crow of death came settling on his window-sill and a silence
fell upon the front room.
Dad's immortality had truly ended and we took him to the Hill of Culsh
at New Deer, beside so many of his friends and neighbours.
By coincidence, I was back at that same resting place on Wednesday,
when we buried my uncle Arthur, and there was time to cast around from
that high point of Buchan and remember that my parents had lived their
entire lives within a three-mile radius of where they now lay.
Down one side of the brae you could see Backhill of Allathan, where my
father grew up, and down another was Mains of Whitehill, the
smallholding which was home to my mother. They settled over there in
Maud, which became the centre of my universe. And what a tapestry of
life we knew.
But all was quiet now on the bare landscape of Buchan except that, in
the glory of a fine spring day, you could almost hear the first
stirrings of new life.

SCOTTISH Nuclear, which is waging an intense private fight to avoid a
takeover by Nuclear Electric, today switches its attention to the wider
public stage to defend its record.
Mr James Hann, SN chairman, is due to tell the British Nuclear Energy
Society conference in Edinburgh that the industry has a strong message
to get across as the Government nears the completion of its review of
nuclear power.
If SN is taken over by Nuclear Electric, the jobs of 350 staff at SN's
headquarters in East Kilbride would immediately come under threat.
However, Mr Hann will today concentrate on how his industry is now
delivering solutions for customers, Government, and the environment.
Mr Hann will say: ''Five years ago, the UK nuclear industry had
developed a habit -- which had almost become a way of life -- of going
to the Government with a list of problems.
''Now we are in a position to report back on solutions -- on
decommissioning, on getting our costs down while the nuclear industry is
part of the solution in protecting the environment from the harmful
effects of acid rain and greenhouse gasses.
''Therefore the industry has a strong message to get across as the
Government nears completion of its reviews of nuclear power -- that's
why we are coming out of our defensive shell and are putting across
these messages loud and clear today.''
Mr Hann will also stress the real benefits of a stretegic role for
nuclear power as part of a balanced energy policy for the UK.
''Nuclear is a long-term investment at a predictable stable cost and
it's a cost that is becoming more and more competitive with other forms
of generation.''
Mr Hann will also touch on nuclear's role in delivering a better
environment, particularly in limiting the risks of global warming.
''People are genuinely worried about what is happening in Antarctica
where recently a huge iceberg -- the size of a small country -- broke
away. People also have fears that changes are taking place in our
weather patterns which cannot be explained, such as the recent floods
that engulfed a third of Holland.
''I am more optimistic than I have ever been about public opinion. The
message from the polls is unambiguous -- there is a growing acceptance
of nuclear's place in a balanced energy future.''
Mr Hann's words, however, will hold a hollow ring for Friends of the
Earth Scotland. The environmental pressure group said yesterday it was
compiling evidence of ''false and misleading claims being made by SN and
will be submitting evidence to the Scottish Secretary''.
The move follows a decision by the Advertising Standards Authority,
which only partially upheld a complaint made by FOE over SN advertising.

DAVID CLAPHAM'S letter in stressing the ostensible protection
available to the clients of dishonest or negligent solicitors takes no
account of the reality of the experience of those clients who have
suffered (March 14).
In cases of negligence my profession hands the client over to the
tender care of the insurance companies under the master policy which
covers the whole profession.
When it really matters to the insurers (ie large claims) past
experience suggests that they have used every trick in the book to
reduce the claim. Cases are dragged out over the years, negligence is
denied far beyond the time when it should be admitted, and the legal
process, in terms of stress and financial pressure, is used to defeat
and not serve justice.
These are standard tactics of insurance companies the world over.
Should it surprise solicitors of all people that these tactics are used
in defending professional negligence claims against them?
It would assist those of us trying to change the system if clients who
have suffered wrote to verify which of the following tactics have been
used against them:
Denial of negligence where there is absolutely no defence; the
(unjustified) claim that you yourself were at fault; the claim that you
have not mitigated (minimised) your loss, possibly despite doing
everything your new solicitor or other advisers told you to do; the
claim that your losses do not approach what your true losses were; legal
delays or ''smart moves'' by insurers' solicitors, and enormous
last-minute pressure almost literally on the steps of the court to
settle for a considerably reduced sum.
Rights without remedies are meaningless. Where access to the courts is
being priced out of reach, what chance does the ordinary client have of
taking on the insurers and the legal profession?
In the past 18 months I have seen many lives seriously blighted and
some practically ruined by our marvellous system of protection.

DAVID CLAPHAM, secretary of the Scottish Law Agents' Society states
that in the year 1993/94 from a total of 7807 practising solicitors,
there were only five struck off. How many of these 7807 solicitors were
reported to the Law Society?
If an independent body were to be set up to regulate them there would
be a considerable increase in those struck off rather than the slapped
wrists handed out by the Law Society.
The Law Society does not exist to protect the client, rather the
opposite.
Unfortunately, until there is independent policing, the situation can
only worsen.

<TEXT>
IT has been confirmed that a planning application for a second
multi-million pound coastal superquarry in Harris will be submitted to
the Western Isles Council within the next two months -- just as the
public inquiry into Redland Aggregates' #70m Lingerbay coastal
superquarry draws to a close.
The application was confirmed in Tarbert at the weekend by Scottish
Aggregates -- a member of the Ready Mix Concrete Group -- when they put
on an exhibition in the community hall to show their proposals for a
superquarry on the western shore of Loch Seaforth in North Harris, which
is in the same national scenic area as the Lingerbay quarry.
At the public inquiry last December a representative said it was the
view of RMC that ''there is no commercial reason why the sites should
not both be developed''.
Mr John Leeson, development manager with RMC, declined to put a figure
on the Loch Seaforth development other than to say that it would be less
than Redland's figure but would be ''several tens of millions of
pounds''. It would provide 30 jobs for locals.
He said they initally planned to extract one million tonnes per annum
of Lewisian Gneiss and, subject to demand, the quarry would be capable
of producing five million tonnes per annum. It would yield up to 150,000
million tonnes.
He said: ''The existing activities such as fish farming and tourism
would not be compromised by the proposals. The importance of observing
the Sabbath is understood and accepted.''
He added that they would be prepared to take their exhibition to
Stornoway to show it to councillors and officials. This includes a
computer model of the site and the surrounding area and how it would
look from different viewpoints. The information panels are in Gaelic and
English.
Mr Colin D'Oyley, head of planning with RMC, said that it had been
closely monitoring the evidence at the Lingerbay inquiry.
The major attraction of Loch Seaforth was the sheltered approach and
berthing conditions, together with water depths greater than 12 metres
close to the shoreline. Trilleachan Mor had been selected as the most
suitable site for the berthing structures.
0 RMC says the excavation would be restored to a landform ''compatible
with, and modelled on, natural features in the surrounding landscape.
Two freshwater lochs would be created in the main quarry area

I ENJOYED reading Patrick Brogan's entertaining piece about St
Patrick's Day in America (March 15).
He told readers that St Patrick's Day is a particularly American
celebration, marked more exuberantly than another other secular event
except July 4. And, of course, he was right.
However, like a lot more Brits, he seems to forget why this is so. My
dearly beloved, and much missed, American grandmother told me time and
time again, why March 17 is such an important day in America.
She said that less than a month afer the Battle of Bunker Hill,
General George Washington arrived in Cambridge, Mass, and took command
of the colonial forces.
Boston was under siege by the British Army all through the terrible
winter of 1775-76 until General Washington forced the evacuation of the
British with a clandestine placement of artillery on Dorchester Heights,
overlooking the British flotilla in Boston Harbour.
On the morning of March 17, 1776, almost 9000 British Army Red Coats
and 1000 Tories boarded 78 vessels and sailed away from America -- never
to return.
That, according to my American granny, is why Americans love to
''parade'n'party'' on March 17.
And what about St Patrick's Day? I was told that that is just a bit of
Irish-American Boston blarney to baffle the Brits.

AGEISM is alive and well in Scotland. Recently there was an ad in The
Herald requiring an author for the writing of a few quality procedures
on a short-term basis. Between the placing of the ad and receiving
replies the firm had changed the job specification.
The new rule? Applicants had to be under the age of 45 years.
Isn't it nice to know that not only does the Government believe that
you are useless when you reach the age of discernment but business has
also fallen into the same trap?
The dirty deed was done through an employment agency. I feel sorry for
them, the fall guys.
It is postulated that executives are worth their salary because that
is the market price. No executive can support this argument as the
current business belief would seem to be that over 45 is unemployable.
Mr Brown, of British Gas, is quite correct to take the shareholders
for all he can get for he is quite unemployable outside his current
company. He and his board are all unemployable on the basis of age, all
quite useless.

I HOPE that there will never be an end to the advances in health care
in Scotland but does the internal market help or hinder such advances?
Reliable research findings being unavailable, Mr McNeill (March 10)
has to be content with argument by assertion; but it would be unsafe to
accept at face value the glossy annual reports of hospital trusts.
Equally suspect are the Government's statistics, which look upon me as
two persons, if, when I am in hospital, both my legs are treated, or if
I am readmitted to hospital after being prematurely discharged.
The NHS can usefully be analysed in terms of strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats.
Accordingly, it's a question of scrupulously assessing the
contribution made in each of these areas by the ''reforms.'' This task
has still to be carried out.
As for the elderly, they have never been, and certainly are not now, a
health priority.
They were proclaimed as such in the 80s by two reports of the Scottish
Health Service Planning Council; but the position on the ground did not
change, and almost immediately council was abolished without going back
to Parliament by Michael Forsyth.
Mr McNeill omits to point out that the new ''comprehensive'' approach
to the care of the elderly is forcing many old people to sell their
homes in order to pay all over again for care which they have spent
their whole adult lives paying for through taxation.

YOUR publication of a series of articles on breast cancer was very
important and will no doubt contribute to the much needed build up of
awareness on this subject (March 13 and 14).
One treatment option, especially for women with early breast cancer,
may not have been clear to readers of the series.
Fear of mastectomy (surgical removal of the breast) maybe a
disincentive for some women in participating in screening examinations
or in seeking medical advice for a lump discovered through breast
self-examination.
Women should be aware of the possibility of treatment for early breast
cancer with limited surgery (lumpectomy) followed by radiation therapy
to the breast.
This breast-conserving approach, tested in many studies reported in
medical literature, produces survival rates identical to those with
modified radical mastectomy.
Lumpectomies and radiation therapy are available to women through the
NHS but also through many typical private health insurance schemes in
the UK. It may be of interest to your readers to know that HCI is the
only private hospital providing radiotherapy facilities in Scotland.

A LABOUR MP has called for an urgent investigation to determine why a
Scottish defence worker has been suspended for using a small batch of
MoD envelopes to send copies of his dog club's yearly accounts to
members.
Mr Neil Roberts, 49, who has 26 years' unblemished service with the
MoD, has been suspended on full pay from his #19,000-a-year post as an
electronics training officer at the Royal Naval Armaments Depot in
Beith, Ayrshire, pending an inquiry.
An MoD investigation was launched earlier this year after a complaint
was made to the Audit Commission by retired QC and dog club member Mr
David Kemp, who claimed Mr Roberts had used Government stationery to
correspond with dog club members.
Mr Roberts, the club treasurer, has rejected the allegations. He
claims he stamped all envelopes used and and later replaced about #4
worth of new ones used with plain brown A4-size envelopes.
Mr Brian Wilson, MP for Cunninghame North, in Ayrshire, claims the
suspension is ''petty in the extreme'' and amounts to nothing more than
an ''internal feud'' within the dog club.
Mr Roberts was arrested by MoD police at work and questioned for 20
minutes before being escorted to his Largs home by two MoD detectives,
who searched his home for Government property.
The matter was reported to the procurator-fiscal last month, but not
acted on.
Mr Roberts says that he often carried out dog club business during his
lunch-hour at the RNAD.
Mr Roberts concedes that he used about 50 OHMS envolopes last March --
more than half of which he claims would otherwise have been binned --
when he ran out of stationery, to avoid delaying sending copies of the
yearly accounts to colleagues in the Bouvier de Flandres Club of Great
Britain.
But he claims he put stamps on all of the envelopes, and later
replaced about two dozen new ones that he used.
Speaking at his home yesterday, he said: ''This matter boils down to a
political struggle within the dog club that has been going on for a
number of years.
''My job is under threat because of something that happened last
March. Yet the complaint was only lodged just before Christmas when
literature on re-elections for the club committee was due to be
despatched.''
Mr Wilson has demanded an explanation from Junior Defence Minister
Nicholas Soames.
The MP said yesterday: ''This suspension is absolutely ridiculous. Mr
Roberts wasn't taking whole bundles of franked envelopes. He was merely
recycling those that came in and restamping them.
''If this complaint had come from anyone other than a retired QC, it
would have been completely ignored.''
Mr Kemp was not available for comment yesterday. An MoD spokeswoman in
London said: ''There is an internal inquiry going on.'' She declined
further comment.

A BRIEF response is necessary to the misinformation contained in a
letter from Marc Jeffery, (Children taken into care, March 8).
The letter made a surprisingly large jump from issues to do with child
abuse to the need to develop ''the first Scottish model in Strathclyde''
(ie family mediation, dealing with separated or divorced parents and
their children).
This develpment did in fact start as far back as 1983 in Strathclyde,
and has continued to develop in a very rapid and healthy manner since
then.
We do have great concerns over the need for increased resources to
respond to demand for family mediation, and we are a little concerned
about the challenges presented by re-organisation of local government,
but, yes, we are alive and well.

I was sorry to read that one of our
customers had a visit to the UCI Cinema at Clydebank spoilt by our
Comic Relief activities (March 16).
As one of the major corporate sponsors of Comic Relief this year, UCI
Cinemas' staff all over the country are, under their own initiatives,
getting up to all sort of crazy antics and stunts and have committed to
raising a minimum of #100,000 for projects in the UK and Africa. Thanks
to their efforts, and the generosity of our customers, we have already
smashed this target and are hoping to raise #250,000.
The 10p added to Mr Dale's ticket price was a voluntary donation to
Comic Relief. In return Mr Dale and his family were treated to a Comic
Relief short feature, played before the film.
The nature of our multiplex cinemas is that we have very different
films showing at the same time, each attracting their own particular
audience. Some of our Natural Born Killers customers wanted to buy
T-shirts and had made the suggestion that we sell them. This we did with
just six T-shirts, all sold in a couple of days for #12 each, with all
the proceeds going to Comic Relief.
I can only apologise for the offence this activity caused, however
unintentional.

THE van company born out of the collapse of Leyland Daf secured a

Birmingham-based LDV will supply 250 vans and minibuses from next
month to the United Kenning Rental Group, whose fleet director, Mr Terry

asked for when they rented a van.

''This is especially important now that legislation is being
introduced to ensure that all schoolchildren are carried in minibuses
with seat belts,'' he said.
Mr Jim Parks, LDV's sales and marketing director, said: ''Securing
this order is a significant breakthrough for us.''

I REGRET having to take issue with much of what Stuart McHardy,
director of the Scots Language Resource Centre, has to say about
teaching dialect as opposed to something approaching standard Scots
(Education Herald, March 7).
When he quotes the view of Liz Niven, of Dumfries and Galloway
Education Department, that the vast majority of bairns already speak
Scots, both would seem to have their head in the clouds.
I suspect that outwith the Gaidhealtacdh the current linguistic
practice of most school children veers more towards that identified by
the late A D Mackie when introducing Poems in the Two Tongues: ''Scots,
as you have it here, was not his mother tongue, but neither for the
matter of that was English. What he spoke from earliest infancy was a
bastard lingo compounded of rudimentary Scots on the one hand and
mispronounced English on the other.''
The Scots element will have been diluted over the passing years.
Although it may be fashionable to give primacy to dialects over a
standard or literary Scots, how on earth will these be taught? There is
hardly any significant body of published literary work in specific Scots
dialects, with the rather special case of Shetlandic and to a lesser
extent that of Buchan or North-east Scots.
While I am no educationist, I would suggest you cannot teach a
language without adequate texts.
Such material does exist within the canon of Scots literature over the
past three centuries and despite all the pressures brought to bear
against it this literary language remains remarkably consistent.
When posing the question about how modern must we be, Stuart McHardy
claims Irvine Welsh and James Kelman as writers in the Scots language. I
too want Scots work to deal with contemporary concerns yet would never
suggest that those two operate in that medium.
Only someone with little or no appreciation of the distinctive lexis
and syntax pertaining to the Scots language could make such an
inaccurate claim.

THE company which harvests cockles on the strand at Seilibost in
Harris has hit back at claims the work could destroy the beach.
It says the harvesting is sensible and sensitive and that it is
working within agreed guidelines.
A local councillor, Mr Donald Macdonald, expressed his concern to
Scottish Natural Heritage last week and also contacted the MP for the
Western Isles, urging him to intervene. He said that SNH did not have a
policing role and appeared to be powerless.
SNH said it was a fishing matter and control lay with the Scottish
Office Agricultural and Fisheries Department.
Mr Jim McKerracher, who is employed by Cree Mackenzie of Hebridean
Seafoods which has a staff of 50, said: ''We are not using a dredger, it
is a special harvesting machine for cockles and only probes about one
and a half to two inches deep. We have been harvesting at Tong beach in
Lewis for the past three years.
''We are not working at Luskentyre, it is off Seilibost, and we are
well away from the cemetery retention wall. When we intially started on
cockles, we approached Scottish Natural Heritage and the environmental
services department of the Western Isles Council.
''Our machine is not like the tractors and dredgers which are being
used on the Cockle Strand at the Traigh Mhor on Barra. After two tides
any marks have almost entirely disappeared and by the third tide you
would not know the machine had been there at all.
''We have avoided certain areas at Seilibost which are used by birds.
We are adhering to a code of conduct which has been agreed and are
operating within guidelines suggested by SNH. We are also providing work
for three people. We only work on dry sand, never when the tide is in.
At Tong you would not know we had been there and the cockles there are
now larger and cleaner.''
He added: ''This is sensible, sensitive harvesting of cockles. Our
harvester is designed to ensure undersized cockles are returned and
covered with sand. We want our harvesting to be a model operation.''
He said about six or seven tons were harvested every week and fetched
between #400 and #500 per ton.

WE wish to express our concern at the detention of poet and writer Ken
Saro-Wiwa in Nigeria. He is an Amnesty International prisoner of
conscience.
We concur with the view that the true reason for his detention and
trial is because of his campaign against the environmental damage caused
by the oil industry in Ogoniland.
We believe that his arrest and trial are part of the continuing
suppression by the authorities of the Ogoni people's campaign against
the oil companies. He has been imprisoned solely for the peaceful
expression of his views.
We therefore appeal to the Nigerian Government for the immediate and
unconditional release of Ken Saro-Wiwa.

AND so the legal debacle with Promenade Productions seems to be
drawing to a close with the company offering creditors like myself 50p
in the #1 as a total and final payment. After legal expenses this will
mean that I will receive at best about #600 of the #1600 owed.
So Mischief La-Bas contributes #1000 towards the #440,000 that The Big
Picnic managed to lose.
Do the producers and directors contribute their fees, I wonder? As you
might imagine, I am none too happy at rewarding them with five mortgage
payments on my flat.
With the money they managed to lose last year, a large-scale outdoor
public performance event of international significance could have been
staged every month of the year.
Still, no use crying over spilt milk, it's just a pity that the basket
into which so many eggs were placed had such a large hole in it.
Thank goodnes they will have more opportunities to hone their
effective management and public relations skills next year.
Part of their letter pleading creditors not to take further action
contains the promise of future work. I and many others would not touch
this company even if they paid me.
I hold a decree against the company, which I could put into service as
a step towards their liquidation.
No doubt if I took this course of action it would seem churlish.
Funding bodies must obviously have heard pretty sound arguments for
continued support.
One of my main reasons for holding back is consideration for other
creditors who might then receive nothing at all. The whole affair has
just been incredibly frustrating.
I can only hope that I do not look back in a year's time and wish,
surrounding by a wailing chorus of plaintiffs, that I had done the right
thing.

<HEADLINE>Fears voiced over island's 'mystic' buyer</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979304668</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
RESIDENTS of Eigg yesterday appealed to the likely new owner of the
Hebridean island -- a German who lists spiritualism, Eastern mystical
writings and fire worship as his influences -- to consult them over its
future.
The 75-strong community is bracing itself for confirmation that the
island is in the final stages of being sold to the 41-year-old artist.
After several years of conflict with the present owner, Mr Keith
Schellenberg, they fear they could be ''leaping from the frying pan into
the fire.''
It is understood the artist, who calls himself Maruma, has agreed to
pay #1.5m for the island, with the deal due for completion this week.
Dr Christopher Tiarks, the GP for Eigg, Rum, Muck and Canna and
secretary of the Eigg Trust, said last night when told the identity of
the prospective buyer: ''Oh God! I'll have to think about this one. One
shouldn't comment until one has met the person.
''But it would be wise for any prospective purchaser to meet the
people and see what he is taking on.
''When Schellenberg rebought the island a couple of years ago, the
general feeling was better the devil one knows but this feeling
disappeared very quickly because of various problems.
''Of course, there is always the danger of out of the frying pan into
the fire and I would rather see some corporate ownership of the island
where there was a body with strong conservation interest holding the
freehold.''
Maruma, a protege of billionaire Gunther Sachs, visited the island
last year.
Catalogues of his works describe him as Picasso's successor and he
boasts that his ''new philosophy of modern art'' has been collected by
Jean-Paul Sartre, Marlon Brando, Romy Schneider, Helmut Schmidt and
Indira Gandhi.
However, despite this and a major city tour of the United States eight
years ago, no galleries of modern art, including the National Galleries
of Scotland, knew of -- or could trace -- the artist this week.
Even the main gallery in Stuttgart, his home town, had never heard of
him.
Mr Schellenberg, 66, and many of the locals have had a long-running
feud over the future of the island, clashing over their wish for
development and tourism.
The former Olympic bobsleigh competitor has called some of them
''rotten, dangerous and totally barmy revolutionaries''.
They, in turn, are glad at getting rid of him.
Last week, Mr Schellenberg, a Yorkshire businessman who made his money
running garages, struck a chill into their hearts when he announced he
was returning to the 7000-acre island even though he admitted it was ''a
bit like being on the North-West Frontier''.
He also admitted that he had been a Lloyds name with the subsequent
losses that went with it.
Mr Schellenberg bought the island 21 years ago for #270,000 but the
growing feud culminated with some islanders forming the Eigg Trust to
fight for a change of ownership and a plan for the islanders to ''take
charge of their own destinies''.
Uncertainty over the future of Eigg grew after years of litigation
between Mr Schellenberg and his second wife resulted in the island being
resold by a court order -- the laird bought it back for nearly #1m. His
third wife, Sukki, has now raised divorce proceedings.
Last October, a judge granted an order on her behalf to stop him
disposing of a number of valuable assets.
The main house on Mr Schellenberg's other land -- the 300-acre estate
of Mayen in Rothiemay, Banffshire -- was recently sold and he now lives
and works from a cottage in the grounds, dividing his time between his
other homes in London and Yorkshire.
Last night, Mrs Sukki Schellenberg, who lives in a seventeenth-century
farmhouse on the Banffshire estate despite attempts at eviction by her
husband, said: ''I don't know anything about this. I've heard all the
rumours but frankly I'll be the last one to know.''
Mr Schellenburg refused to comment on the sale to Maruma.

Giorgio Armani has no truck with the false gods of glam. Any excessive
look is a travesty of grace and he prefers understated elegance to
screaming sexuality. Yet, as Anne Simpson explains, he can still bewitch
with sensual simplicity
PARTY ON IN TOP GEAR
* ON April 20 come boogie with the hip crowd when fashion takes over
The Tramway in Glasgow for a journey into suave style and funky fun.
Next Stop . . . Emporio Armani will be more than a fashion show of
structured strides, for when the models have completed their twirls and
the clothes are back on the hangers, the live music and dancing will
begin.
Held in association with The Herald, the event will feature Emporio
Armani's spring and summer collection for women and men, cut with
youthful sassiness and lots of international attitude. The evening,
accompanied by spritzy refreshments in Tramway settings of panache, will
begin at 7.30pm, and tickets are #12 each. The proceeds will go to
Scottish European Aid for its work in Bosnia, Romania and Rwanda, and to
The Herald Foundation for Women's Health which is engaged in raising
funds for the establishment of a special one-stop gynaecological clinic
at the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow. Admittance will be by numbered ticket
only, and those wishing to attend are urged to apply promptly as demand
will be heavy. A coupon appears on Page 17.
IN Milan they talk about the Church of Armani, an intimation of the
reverence swirling like incense around the maestro's shows. Yet such
words are too loaded with obligation to sit well on the blithe shoulders
of fashion. Better to talk of Armani's magic, something so light and
felicitous that, at times, its very simplicity defies any wrapping up in
language.
What is it about this man that has placed him so centrally in Italy's
pantheon of near-immortals? He is, after all, unshowy, a deeply private
individual scornful of the noisy flounce of many of his colleagues, a
person first and foremost committed to restraint.
Repelled by fashion's present stripperie -- that ungainly cheek of
naked buttocks and breasts -- Giorgio Armani should be the one out in
the cold. The one whose subtlety has lost the place. But the fact is,
subtlety remains his most dominant attribute, a natural gift which has
ensured his company is now worth in excess of #400m and allows him a
perfectionist's total control, his supervision extending to every
detail, from the choice and position of flowers on the tables of his
working palazzo to the vetting of press photographers for his
collections.
That palazzo, stripped of its seventeenth-century adornments on the
Via Borgonuovo, is as much a symbol of Armani's genius as his seminal
slouch jackets. A gauzy stillness enfolds the place, the dove-grey
corridors leading to dove-grey rooms and down into the dove-grey theatre
where, four times a year, the designer presents his latest silhouette to
journalists and retailers and a shining coterie of friends. Sunlit
corners of the courtyard are dressed with shrubs in blossom, but
otherwise everything is rinsed of colour to create a limpid serenity, a
salving calm drawn from another age.
And this, of course, is why the churchy analogies creep in, but it is
wrong to think that Armani's philosophy contains no sensual life. There
is a seductive mystery to his designs and often the bewitching
simplicity isn't simple at all, but something so perfectly and finely
layered -- one article of clothing placed on top of another, on top of
another -- that the whole effect appears to have been achieved by
sleight of hand.
It is Armani's legendary skill with fabric, his ability to make it
flow like cream, which turns his shows into visions rather than merely
parades of gorgeous clothes.
In his empire, Emporio Armani is the great colonising label known
around the world for youthful brio, diversity and informality and, not
least, its more accessible price compared to the signature collection.
But in either collection, the art of Armani's seduction lies in creating
a look for women which is pure without being prim, sometimes mannish
without being masculine.
With the current Emporio line he seeks to evoke ''happiness'' by using
a softer, gentler silhouette; a line where the short, filmy skirt and
tender slip dress become emblems for renewed femininity, and provide
Armani with his own special salute to spring.
During the seventies, when women had to dress like men in order to be
taken seriously, Armani began his design career by giving them
unstructured trouser suits with over-large jackets, which nonetheless
conveyed both sexiness and grace. But there was also a satirical
stylishness about these languid clothes which knocked the pompous
stuffing out of authority dressing, and meant that women would never
clothe themselves in the same rigid way again.
''I like to think that today a woman knows how to assimilate a number
of different styles,'' he muses, adding that the age of precise designer
dictums is dead. A woman now can mix a range of ideas in her own mind
and then pull forth an individual style. That said, Armani abhors the
spettacolo condition of many competing collections; the contrived and
aggressive silhouettes which, he claims, are more about magazine covers
than clothes.
And for him, the present retreat into the crimped but vampy glamour of
the forties is equally depressing and offensive, an anachronism
revealing only the sloth of designers who, instead of pushing themselves
to be original, merely plagiarise the past.
But the criticism against Armani himself is that he is too controlled,
too disciplined, that his work, although always beautiful, presents no
revolutionary change. He acknowledges some truth in the first two
claims, but on the third he feels his challengers miss the point:
subtlety has no kinship with shock tactics, and it is in the intricacy
of detail that his work progresses from one season to the next.
But yes, it is correct that he has not given himself enough time to
travel or to be with friends, to reflect or even really enjoy his
success. And, now aged 60, with the muscular athleticism of someone 20
years younger, he considers that this is the right age for significant
change, to re-do what he calls the ''psychological maquillage''.
Even so, there are problems: he may have no wish to lock himself on to
a conservative track, but equally there is nothing worse than a mature
person suddenly altering identity and charging off the rails.
For Armani, the challenge is how to exploit the creative freedoms of
the moment without betraying those who are most at ease with his
established style. But there are times when he sounds as if he wants to
wean women away from fashion altogether: ''Women can follow fashion too
closely. For some it is camouflage, for others it is everything so that
there is no personality beneath.
''But I find pleasure in designing for capable people who are
interested in life beyond themselves. Women who don't want to pose as
princesses or ball-breakers, but are assured in any company.''
Ten years ago, Armani's close friend and business partner, Sergio
Galeotti, died, driving the designer more deeply into introspection, and
prompting fears that he would not be able to continue without Galeotti's
financial verve. But, in the intervening decade, Armani has confounded
market sceptics by becoming one of the few designers to master the
commercial pressures of his craft.
He had something to prove, but, at the time, not even he knew if he
really possessed the ability to push the company forward. Last year's
sales removed any lingering doubt: while the recession was gnawing away
at the rag trade throughout Europe and America, Armani's takings were up
by 23%.
But last year was memorable for more sombre reasons, also. Armani was
among Italy's fashion stars summoned before Antonio Di Pietro, Milan's
renowned bribery investigator, the interrogations apparently focusing on
1990, when the designers were allegedly obliged to pay kickbacks to
corrupt tax officials in return for favourable audits.
Armani's lawyers conceded that he had given in to demands for a payoff
amounting to #41,000, and privately he told friends that the summons was
both a ''liberation'' of guilt's burden, and the worst day he had
endured since Galeotti's death. He was mortified, he told his closest
circle, that his mother should have seen him called to court.
Fashion is often a war. There are skirmishes between hairdressers,
between models and their former agents, between photographers and, of
course, between designers themselves. In the case of Armani and Versace,
for instance, the feuds have been going on for years, the problem being
that the two are polar opposites in temperament and style, yet each sees
himself as the emperor of Italian fashion.
But, for Armani, any excessive look is a travesty of grace, and when,
in the past, he has railed against those who turn fashion into ''a porno
show of bondage'', no one has been confused about his target. However,
for Gianni Versace, the fiery Calabrian, sensuality is often a matter of
brilliant lust, and he scorns Armani's beigeness as something spiritless
and sad.
But in eight days' time, when Hollywood assembles for the Oscars
ceremony, designers will once again quiver with agitation over who among
them clothes the most Academy Awards. In previous years, Armani has
notched up the highest ''outfit'' count, and this occasion is not likely
to be different.
As it is, his daily clientele reads like a movie studio register:
Michelle Pfeiffer, Isabella Rossellini, Annette Bening, Tina Turner,
Cher, Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg, Michael Douglas, Eric Clapton,
Mickey Rourke . . . all people who, off camera and when it really
matters, forego lascivious hype to take their ease in a masterly glamour
which seems conjured from nothing at all.

A CHURCH of Scotland minister was in his pulpit yesterday, despite a
suspension imposed on him by Dumbarton Presbytery.
The Rev Tom Logan told The Herald he would continue taking services at
Abbotsford Parish Church, Clydebank, until he was instructed otherwise.
He declined to make any further comment.
Mr Logan had obtained an interim interdict in the Court of Session on
Friday afternoon setting aside his suspension. However, the moderator of
Dumbarton Presbytery, the Rev John Harris, made it clear last night that
Mr Logan was made aware, before taking the service, that the presbytery
did not accept that the Court of Session had jurisdiction and that, as
far as it was concerned, his suspension still stood.
When it became clear that Mr Logan intended to take the service, the
moderator then instructed the Rev Fergus Buchanan, of Milngavie, who had
been designated to replace Mr Logan yesterday, to attend, but only as an
observer.
The rejection of the court ruling was further underlined by the
convener of the Kirk's judicial commission, the Rev John Cairns of
Dumbarton, who is the presbytery's prosecutor in the proceedings being
brought against Mr Logan. ''Every legal point that was raised in the
Court of Session is answerable by the presbytery,'' Mr Cairns said.
''But I believe the Court of Session has no jurisdiction in this
matter.''
Mr Logan's defiance followed the decision of the presbytery to suspend
him following a meeting last Wednesday. It alleged breaches of
undertakings in respect of work as an agent for Amway, a networking
sales organisation which specialises in soap products and in recruiting
sales agents.
But the presbytery decided to hold a trial on April 19, and Mr Logan
was suspended on full pay.
Mr Logan made no reference to the controversy during his sermon, but
afterwards the congregation were supportive.
One, who asked not to be named but said she had been going to the
church for 50 years, said: ''We are all with him. I told him myself that
we want to see him stay at the church. It's a lot of nonsense -- the
Church of Scotland is getting far too political. He has not hurt his
ministry in any way.''
In granting the interdict against the presbytery last week, Mr Logan's
advocate criticised procedures and said an accused person should be
given a full opportunity of defending himself.
The decision has rocked the Church, which had seen the right to hire
and fire without resort to the civil courts as a cornerstone of its
independence.
The Kirk's principal clerk, the Very Rev James Weatherhead, said an
approach would be made this week for a further court hearing.
Kirk legal figures were yesterday preparing to defend the independence
of the Church from civil courts. Should last Friday's interdict be
allowed to stand, it would inevitably lead to a bitter and contentious
feud.

A SCOTSWOMAN who represents a native American tribe flew from
Banffshire yesterday to take its fight against plans to site a chemical
factory on sacred land to the European Parliament in Brussels.
Ms Elaine Bishop, 46, originally from Cullen, will lobby MEPs to
promote opposition to a proposed ''sour-gas'' processing plant on land
sacred to the Lubicon Lake Cree Nation in Northern Alberta, Canada.
The community worker, who had to cut short a holiday with her mother
in the North-east fishing village to fly to Brussels, now lives in
Little Buffalo, the capital of the 500-strong tribe's 4000-square-mile
territory and was selected by the tribe to represent it.
The Cree people fear that the factory will jeopardise their health by
causing serious environmental pollution.
More than 500 oil and gas wells have been drilled in the area since
the early 1980s against their wishes, generating revenues of #4000m,
whilst the impoverished natives have received nothing from the
petrochemical companies, Ms Bishop claimed.
In 1989, the UN's human rights committee found the Canadian Government
to be in breach of their Convention on Political and Human Rights over
the Lubicon issue, but the tribe, which suffers 90% unemployment, has
not yet received any form of settlement.
Ms Bishop said: ''These Crees were once self-sufficient, semi-nomadic
hunters, and when the oil business took off there in the early 1980s it
destroyed that lifestyle, eroded their culture and damaged the
environment.
''They feel their homeland has been raped and murdered by these
companies. They're not looking for mega-bucks but just enough to develop
ranching and care for the sick and the elderly.''

Chi An worked to preserve China's one-child policy, then she and her
second unborn child almost became victims of it. For the harrowing story
reiterates the complexity of the abortion debate
Picture: MIKE WILKINSON
A wanted baby: Rebecca Leigh Watkin of South Gyle, Edinburgh, is one
of The Herald's Five for '95 babies born at the New Year. We report on
their progress early next month. Rebecca will be christened at the
weekend .
IN THE summer of 1974 I took a summer job, after graduating, in the
Social Work department of a deprived area of the city. One of my duties
was to interview people who arrived with their problems, mostly a
dovetailed mixture of the financial and the personal, and take down
basic information before they were seen by a qualified social worker.
During this three-month period a worrying pattern began to emerge. A
number of young women, most of them in their mid teens, had come to the
Department, finally admitting to me, after distraughtly skirting round
their central worry, that they were pregnant.
They were scared of parental reaction and frightened of being ''thrown
out the house''. Many described how they visited their GP, were informed
how many months gone they were and told to return at a later date.
This ''later date'' often meant that they were too far advanced in
their pregnancies for a safe, early abortion to be a viable option. Of
course, many of them were confused about what action, if any, to take,
but they seemed intimidated by their doctors and the daunting decision
to terminate or not was rarely discussed.
It occurred to me -- although I resisted the idea -- that doctors with
anti-abortion views were not being honest with their patients.
While I utterly respected their right to their opinion, I believed
that it was unfair of them not to declare their position to the women
involved, in an open way, thus giving them the option of alternative
advice. A frantic 16-year-old was going to find it difficult enough to
take stock of her situation and work out what she herself wanted
without, as I suspected was happening, being purposely misled.
But it was quite an accusation for me, as an unqualified person, to
make: though it was becoming obvious that many were being misinformed
about how far on in their pregnancy they really were so as to rule out
the possibility of a termination.
I was shocked by this enforced powerlessness and believed in a woman's
right to control her fertility, but I did feel out of my depth. I
therefore decided to take the straightforward step of phoning one of the
doctors who seemed to be implementing a strategy which I found
reprehensible.
I was nervous, and chose my words carefully -- I suppose I was
expecting a telling off, an indignant denial, and, on being reported,
the sack.
Indignation I certainly got, but the GP I spoke to readily admitted
that she did indeed lie about how advanced a given pregnancy was in
order to save an unborn child: she went on to ask if I had ever
witnessed an abortion and seen the tiny, perfectly-formed hands and
limbs of a destroyed foetus.
I replied that I had not, but since abortion was not illegal, I felt
that the decision should rest, not with her, but with the pregnant
woman.
Nothing happened, I was not sacked (I assume the practice continued),
then I left. I was involved in the women's movement, and I believed, as
I still do, what we shouted on our seventies pro-choice marches: that
our goal was ''every child a wanted child, every mother a willing
mother''.
Reading the harrowing account of China's One-Child policy in Stephen
W. Mosher's remarkable book reminded me yet again of the complexity of
these issues of fertility and choice. His story of Chi An (not her real
name) details the terrifying results in terms of human suffering of a
barbaric regime.
A policy aimed at population control became a nightmare of enforced
late abortions, infanticide, and authoritarian pressures which led to
the murder of little girls by families who wanted a son.
Brought up to chant at school that ''Father is dear, mother is dear,
but neither is as dear as Chairman Mao'', Chi An joined the Red Guard,
after much difficulty, since her background defined her as a ''grey'',
that is, politically suspect because of ''landlordism'' in her
background.
She trained as a nurse and was involved in the very enforcement
tactics which she herself suffered from as she submitted to an unwanted
abortion.
Her own moral confusion, as she justified the need for some population
restrictions, given the size of China, increased: she performed late,
unwanted abortions, she pressurised and cajoled women, women with
''illegal'' pregnancies into accepting their fates, as they huddled
together in prison-like conditions.
She watched as a woman gave birth to a baby which was immediately
given a fatal injection to the head; in the fontanelle -- that
vulnerable soft area which mothers take such care to protect. Refusal to
comply would have led to imprisonment.
When her husband is allowed a study permit to work in America, Chi An
is finally able to join him with their son. When she becomes pregnant in
the States, she is harangued by the Chinese authorities who insist on
her compliance with the one-child policy and virtually command her to
abort.
She is unable to go through with this course of action but remains
terrified for the safety of her mother and family: she is guilt-ridden
about her past collusion with such state intrusion, and fearful of
severe persecution for herself and her husband as
counter-revolutionaries on their return to China, were the United States
not willing to grant them asylum.
The Immigration and Naturalisation Service did indeed turn down their
application, arguing that she did not have grounds for political asylum:
however, when, with the help of Mosher, they ''went public'', they won
their case.
Chi An gave birth to the daughter she had desperately wanted, aware of
coming from a country where the arrival of a daughter is often not a
cause for celebration, to say the least. She has converted to
Catholicism, an act which she describes as having relieved somewhat her
dreadful remorse for her activities as a ''population control
enforcer''.
''What good is your regret?'' I sneered at my reawakened conscience.
''How does it help the troubled and despairing women, now forever
barren, whom you tortured, aborted and sterilised?''
The abattoir-like hell of murdered babies and enforced late abortion
makes grim reading, and, of course, some pro-lifers would argue that any
termination is murderous. (I remember the posters used by the Society
for the Protection of the Unborn Child, using children's paintings of
babies with daggers stuck into them).
The Catholic Church remains anti-contraception and, at the recent
worldwide conference on population control, took a rigid, fundamentalist
attitude, although there exists a large number of pro-choice, practising
Catholics.
In the States, doctors who perform abortions have been shot and
murdered outside their clinics. Politicians have to be very careful
about their stance, in an increasingly rightist atmosphere. There is
still no 100% safe contraception, so that however responsible a woman
might be, an unwanted pregnancy can happen. I am deeply grateful that I
have never been in that position.
I cannot say how I would have decided, in hindsight. And certainly the
experience of having two children heightens one's awareness of the
seriousness, the true implications of the decision. It is no longer
''theoretical'', the knowledge that the missed period will lead to a
unique, irreplaceable life. (Or lives, in my case).
But while single women are blamed for having babies to secure them a
council house and accused of sinful murder for not having them; while
women's health is abysmally low on the social agenda and years of
child-bearing can take a dreadful toll, I continue to believe we are in
danger if we ditch our liberalism, and forget that mothers should be
willing mothers, in China and elsewhere, and that babies should be
wanted, and wanted regardless of their sex.

I AM writing this letter in memory of my wife Marie, who died last
year of breast cancer, and in the hope that those reading -- especially
men -- will add their voice to the Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign's
call for more funding into research and treatment of breast cancer.
Forcing myself to read your coverage of this disease over the last few
days brought back all the pain, the heartache, the frustration and the
horror from the first days we discovered the lump.
I relived the first visit to the hospital where Marie went to have a
lump diagnosed. The doctor was sympathetic, but why was I left sitting
in the waiting room? Didn't 27 years together count for anything? Then
the wait -- more terror, living in hope -- back to the hospital for the
results, again left in the waiting room.
But they wanted me to come in this time. ''Sit down Mr Wallace, I've
just been telling your wife that the tests were positive and we think
she should come in to the hospital as soon as possible.'' Bang! Is this
a nightmare? God, Marie, I'm feeling faint . . .
On reflection how pathetic I must have been, here was the wonderful
woman who had just been given a potential death sentence comforting me
and saying everything would be all right. She knew what was in front of
her.
After a mastectomy and two years of regular checks, she was given the
all clear. Yes, it was just enough time to get through college and start
work as a community worker, and then it came back. Back with a
vengeance. It was just a sore back at first, pain killers, more pain
killers. No, doctor, there must be something else. Then the specialist.
Back to the waiting room.
''Can you come in Mr Wallace . . . I'm sorry, Mr Wallace.'' He doesn't
need to tell me -- over the previous two years I have read all the books
-- but Marie's face says it all. How long Doctor? Two months, two years,
if we started the treatment right away. It all depends; I know a
specialist.
Drive home on automatic pilot, just sit and hug each other. The
following months brought us closer together. The regular trips to the
Beatson in Glasgow, the radiotherapy, the pills, more pills, until Marie
eventually died at home in my arms.
The few months did give us a chance to talk about the future, but what
future for my eight-year-old daughter? Must we live in fear that this
silent killer will take her?
On a less emotional and more practical note, how do you survive when
you are left on your own with three children eight, 13 and 19? It
reminded me of another campaign, highlighted in The Herald on Tuesday,
February 21, where Russell Ecob put the case for equal rights for
bereaved fathers.
Your readers can help defeat this ''silent killer'' by writing to
their MPs demanding support for more support and finance for the
treatment of breast cancer.
Speak out now for your wife's, your daughter's, your mother's, and
other women's sake and perhaps you won't have to go through this
nightmare.

Since the Tory Party withdrew the Whip from Teresa Gorman the
vociferous MP for Billericay has been in her element, urging the
Conservatives to move to the Right, quit the European Union, and pick a
new leader who could inspire both the party and the country -- and she
tells William Russell that this formula is winning support inside
Westminster and among disaffected Tory voters who admire her rebellious
stand
THE Conservative Party has had more than one woman of strong character
on its back benches over the years, but Teresa Gorman stands out as
unusual. Teresa is not just an eccentric old dame; Teresa is a people's
champion, a woman with a popular cause who also has the popular touch.
When she entered Parliament for Billericay in 1987 she was just
another woman MP with an interesting business background and experience
in local government as a Westminster city councillor. She became a
figure of fun for the sketch writers because of her advocacy of hormone
replacement therapy, to the value of which, at 63, she is eloquent
testimony. The woman fizzes with the energy of someone half her age. She
could talk the hind leg off a donkey. She is a figure of fun no longer.
It was her opposition to the European Union which transformed her from
oddball female back bencher to a political force to be reckoned with.
That, and the disastrous decision by the Prime Minister to withdraw the
party Whip from the rebel MPs. Her opinion of the Prime Minister is
forthright. The party needs somebody new at its head; it needs a new
direction.
She refused to be drawn into suggesting a successor, although she did
admire Kenneth Clarke, liking his style if not his pro-Europe stance.
But when it came to that new direction reticence is abandoned.
''The Tory Party has nowhere to go but to the Right, because the Left
is occupied by Labour,'' she said. ''Mr Blair has taken all the
soft-Left policies on board. We should be grateful for that. Our dilemma
is that he seems nice and fairly innocuous to the average Tory. They are
not frightened of him. Someone spitting fire and flames like the old
Welsh dragon, Kinnock, scared the Tories. I think they thought John
Smith a good, solid, middle-class person. Blair has all the attributes
of a young Tory hopeful. He is the kind of person Margaret Thatcher
adored and promoted.''
Mrs Gorman said she was by nature ruthless and would behave like a
Lord Hanson in trying to deal with the problem of the party. ''If you
take over a corporation, a demoralised company, which is what the Tory
Party is at the moment, down on its luck and fortunes, down in its
public support, then you have to get in there and give it a belt around
the ear,'' she said. ''John Major is too Mr Nice Guy for that job. He is
a very nice person. Everyone says that, but it has almost become a term
of abuse. You want someone with guts and balls -- like me.'' She laughs
uproariously at the very idea.
''He is not the man we thought he was when we voted for him to be
leader,'' she said. ''We thought he was Margaret's successor.''
Major had risen first through the Whips' office (and once a Whip
always a Whip), then through the Treasury and, briefly, the Foreign
Office, she said. He had learned his economics in the Treasury, and the
fact he was wedded to a single currency was because he learned his sums
in that school. She had learned her sums in the business world, and that
background coloured the way one handled a job. ''If you want to
understand why he thinks the way he does, it is because he does not have
any alternative vision or experience of life.''
As to who could take over, she said that everyone knew the answers.
Two men had the personality and the panache: Kenneth Clarke and Michael
Heseltine. There had been a time when she thought Clarke worth
supporting as she liked his style. That left a selection of younger
people who were either ''unknown or vain''.
The Government had failed to deliver what the Tories promised the
voters at the last election, and John Major seemed to them to be
indecisive whatever he did, she said. He was doing some good and useful
things, like keeping down inflation, but the punters liked a bit of
inflation. It gave them the feeling their house value was rising. ''He
should do what we did. Tell the bureaucrats in Brussels 'not another
penny until you sort out fraud'.''
She is convinced that opposition to membership of the European Union
as at present constituted is the way ahead for the Tories. It is the
message contained in the letters of support the rebel MPs have received,
which she said were of amazing quality. ''They are almost like the
letters people write to a lover who has returned to the scene,'' she
added. ''They say 'you embody the principles we have always believed in.
You show courage. You have integrity. You stick to your principles'.
Then they excoriate the present Cabinet and the Prime Minister. The
contempt they express for what has happened to the Tory Party is
palpable. The letters are not from nutters. These are erudite,
well-constructed letters. They express enormous gratitude and relief
that the nine rebels represent values they thought the Tory Party had
lost. They feel cheated.
''You would think they were lining up in a soup queue in Surrey, but
they are living extremely comfortably -- yet none of that matters.
Politics is not about an objective assessment of your circumstances. It
is entirely subjective, a bit like romance. The way they express their
feelings about their country, their patriotism, that they don't want to
be ruled by a bunch of foreigners. 'We did not vote Tory for this to
happen' is the message. It does not seem to me to matter why they are
moaning. What matters is the way they feel about our party, their
feeling towards the leadership. It is a bit like sex. You cannot explain
it, but you know when it hits you.''
A lot of letters came from Labour voters who said they admire what the
rebels were doing, she added. They contained real, hard jingoism and
showed people cared about the way they were governed. They were angry
about foreigners overriding our courts, giving taxpayers' money to the
IRA. Their view was that Britain was being bossed about by foreigners
and they did not like that. It was easy to become blase about the system
we had in this country, but what we had managed to achieve was something
quite remarkable. We had something unique and worth preserving. Most of
the time people took it for granted.
''That is the way they feel,'' she said. ''They are feeling bad. What
do you do? You shift the party's policies over to the Right. It is what
people are telling you to do.''
She felt that the Prime Minister's television image helped neither him
nor the party. The medium was so intimate, it allowed people to watch
one's body language, listen to the way one spoke in a way never before
possible, she said. They could ''eyeball'' someone. ''When they look at
you on the box they stare at you,'' she said. ''They are deciding
whether they like or trust you. They are evaluating in a special way.
Somehow John Major seems not to come across to them. He seems remote.
His language is stilted. His body language is more reserved. Apparently
they get a different feeling from Mr Blair.''
The party must accept the feedback from the public. When she was
trying to sell a product to her customers it did not matter how good it
was, if they did not like it, forget it. The voters did not perceive the
Tory Party at the moment to be on their side. ''If they think you are
shifty and are not driving the country in the way they want to go they
will not vote for you. We rebels have become a kind of channel for this
sentiment. If the Tory Party felt strongly against us they would write
and tell us that we had got it wrong. The party is not being damaged by
us. They want a PM going on the box and saying 'I am not having this'.
They want a champion. Margaret was a champion.''
She felt she was serving as a kind of lightning conductor. ''I am not
saying the party hierarchy are inviting us in to talk, but they are
aware of the kind of response we have evoked,'' she said. ''Michael
Forsyth said to me in the tearoom the other day: 'Wherever I go they are
saying Teresa Gorman should be Prime Minister and we would vote Tory
again.' That is the feedback.''
She does not expect great political office. She did not fit into the
political bureaucracy, she said. The party wanted people who were team
players and women did not fit into that category very well. Margaret
Thatcher was not a team player and the establishment lot would have got
rid of her after the first election if it had not been for the
Falklands.
''There are many aspects to how you reform the fortunes of the
party,'' she said. ''You cannot do it by saying Europe is our future and
unless you get into bed with them we cannot survive. We will not go down
at the next election -- if we do go down -- because the nine of us upset
the apple-cart. We will go down at that election because the leadership
of the party appears to its natural supporters to be no longer
reflecting their standards, views, and principles. I think that is
something we can still rescue. In theory, we have a couple of years.
''I see a future role for the Tory Party in continuing the Thatcher
revolution and turning it into the Gorman revolution based on liberating
people from the regulatory structures, operating a civilised society
requiring people to be responsible for themselves and their kids, and
stopping the country being swamped by people coming here for a cheap
lifestyle from abroad. Mostly people are not hostile to immigrants but
they are to people coming to live off the welfare state. They want to
see people coming to work, not living off the state and pretending they
cannot find jobs. We need to liberate the economy. We have to find a way
out of the European Union. We have to bring our own regulatory bodies
under control, abolish 90% of the quangos.''
It could be done. A referendum giving the choice of staying in the EU
as it is or coming out and simply trading with Europe was one option. Or
we could elect a Government which said that from this time on Britain
was going to plough its own furrow again. The idea that we would be cast
off into the Atlantic and allowed to float away was ridiculous. We had
to stop believing we could only survive in Europe.
''We can withdraw, we can repatriate our powers, we can come out of
the CAP, out of the European Court -- we just give due notice,'' she
said. ''A country can do what it wants to do. To pretend we would
somehow be damaged or fall to pieces by coming out of Europe is
ludicrous.''
She reckoned what the rebels had demonstrated was that there was still
a very strong interest in the Conservative Party among the voters,
provided it was seen to be offering policies considered to be patriotic
and sympathetic to the interests of the British people. It was quite
clear the Government's priorities were wrong, in their view. They wanted
the Government to stand up to Europe.
''When Mr Major chucked us out he did not think there would be nine of
us,'' she said. ''He thought it would be two or three and they could
sacrifice that number and nobody would mind. Pushing out eight of us
(the ninth rebel, Sir Richard Body resigned the Whip of his own accord)
made us into martyrs. People like rebels. By withdrawing the Whip they
made us victims. Our status in the country is quite incredible. We are
striking all the right chords with the Tory Party faithful. We did not
ask to get into this position. Without wanting to, we have enunciated
the formula that can bring the native Tory vote back on side.''

Kabul
AFGHAN Government troops ousted opposition Taleban militia from a
strategic base near Kabul in an early-morning blitz today, inflicting
the second serious defeat in a week on the Islamic force.
Troops loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani captured the Charasyab
base, 15 miles south of the capital, after a three-pronged offensive at
dawn.
By noon they had pushed the Taleban back southwards another 16 miles
into Logar province, said the Defence Ministry.
The second government victory against Taleban in a week appeared to
give government forces control over Kabul and its environs for the first
time since Islamic mujahideen factions took power from a collapsed
communist government in 1992.
At least 50 Taleban fighters were killed and 250 wounded in the
operation, a Ministry spokesman said.
Government forces captured 15 tanks, several rocket launchers, and two
helicopters and took 200 prisoners in the past two days. Gul Haider,
commander of the government forces, said he had given chase to the
Taleban and encountered only weak resistance.
Government troops also attacked Taleban positions around the Wardak
provincial capital, Maidan Shahr.
Yesterday a Rabbani spokesman in Pakistan, where the president was
attending a regional summit, said government forces aimed to oust
Taleban from Charasyab, captured last month from the main opposition
Hezb-i-Islami party of former Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
The loss of Charasyab was Taleban's second defeat in a week after a
string of easy victories had given it control over at least nine
southern and eastern provinces.
A week ago government forces ousted Taleban from Kabul's south-western
district of Karte Seh, taken earlier from the opposition Shi'ite
Hezb-i-Wahdat faction, whose leader Abdul Ali Mazari was later reported
killed while in Taleban captivity.
Today's victory comes two days before the Afghan New Year, the UN
deadline for Rabbani to hand over power to an interim council as part of
peace plan for his war-shattered country.
A Rabbani spokesman said he would not move aside yet because no
mechanism existed for a transfer of power.
Taleban emerged as a movement of Islamic religious students in
southern Kandahar province seven months ago. Few believed then it had
the muscle seriously to challenge the main factions hardened by years of
fighting against Soviet occupation forces.
However, it gained popular support from many Afghans disgusted with
the bloody squabbles of mujahideen factions. Many former mujahideen
commanders switched sides to join it, bringing weapons including tanks
and helicopters.--Reuter.

Valenciennes, Sunday
THE match-rigging trial of former Marseille football boss Bernard
Tapie touched off a political furore in France after a former Cabinet
Minister admitted lying under oath to help Tapie cover up.
Jacques Mellick, a French MP, was ordered to stand trial later this
month after he abandoned sworn testimony about meeting Tapie in June
1993. The meeting had been a key alibi for Tapie, a self-made
millionaire businessman turned politician.
MP Adrien Zeller called for an urgent meeting of leaders of the
National Assembly to examine possible sanctions against Mellick, saying
his U-turn could tarnish the credibility of all politicians.
''I'm shocked because I think it's the first time we've seen an MP
lying under oath,'' he said.
Mellick, the mayor of the northern town of Bethune, was ordered by a
prosecutor yesterday to stand trial on March 31, charged with trying to
influence a witness at Tapie's trial.
Mellick's son said his father had offered to help Tapie, a member of
both the French and European Parliaments, because he feared his downfall
would cost 300 jobs at a weighing-machine factory in Bethune owned by
Tapie.
Tapie, also a left-wing National Assembly member and former Minister,
went on trial with five others last week charged with involvement in
bribery of the Valenciennes team to lose a league match in 1993.
Prosecutors allege the bribes were to avoid straining Marseille
players who faced a European Cup final against AC MIlan six days later.
Marseille won both matches.
Mellick's alibi had helped to shield Tapie against allegations by the
former coach of the Valenciennes team, Boro Primorac, who says Tapie was
trying to bribe him in his office.
Primorac accuses Tapie, who faces several other legal actions over his
collapsing business empire, of offering him cash and a new job to change
his testimony about the match-rigging scandal. Tapie, however, denies
meeting Primorac.
After the scandal broke, Marseille were stripped of their French
league title and demoted to the second division. Tapie was banned from
running the club.
Tapie says he is the victim of a political plot. He and his fellow
defendants face up to three years in jail if convicted.--Reuter.

HELSINKI: Finland's opposition Social Democratic Party yesterday won
its greatest election victory since the Second World War to become the
biggest party in Parliament. The SDP won 15 extra seats to give it 63 in
the 200-member chamber.
However SDP leader Paavo Lipponen, widely tipped to be the next
premier, said that the party would need a coalition with either Prime
Minister Esko Aho's Centre Party or the Conservatives to form the next

SANTIAGO: A Chilean navy plane and ecologists were last night tracking
the Pacific Pintail, a British freighter loaded with radioactive
plutonium which set off for Japan last month from France. Chile has
banned the ship from its waters out of health and environmental
concerns. Earlier, environment campaigners in New Zealand said the ship
had chosen a route around the tip of South America because of strong
South African opposition to an alternative route round the Cape of Good
Hope. They warned that the new route, 200 miles south of Cape Horn, was
dangerous because of stormy seas and icebergs.

Manila, Sunday
WIDESPREAD outrage in the Philippines over the hanging of a Filipina
maid today forced Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong to postpone a
visit to Manila next month.
Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo said the visit had been ''postponed
to a more propitious time'' and he had recommended to President Fidel
Ramos that a presidential commission be set up to investigate the case.
A senior official said that Filipinos' indignation over the hanging of
Flor Contemplacion in Singapore on Friday impelled the move: ''We felt
that the height of emotions are such that we should find a more
opportune time for the visit.''
Contemplacion, 42, was hanged for the 1991 murder of another Filipina
maid and a three-year-old Singaporean boy.
The hanging for a crime that many Filipinos believe she did not commit
brought threats of reprisals from a communist guerrilla death squad,
street protests, and calls for a boycott of Singaporean products and
businesses in the Philippines.
Militant groups have also threatened to hound Goh with demonstrations
if he visits.
In Singapore today, police patrolled the grounds of a Roman Catholic
church, and were seen at several places where Filipina maids gather on
their weekly day off.
Romulo said the Manila government was also recalling its envoys to
seven countries with the biggest number of overseas Filipino workers to
review policies and seek to prevent a repetitition of the Contemplacion
affair.
Those to be recalled are the ambassadors to Singapore, Malaysia, Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Ermirates, and South Korea, and the
consular chief in Hong Kong.
The Philippines' estimated two million overseas workers remit #6000m
to the country annually and have been cited by Ramos as ''national
heroes'' for helping to prop up the economy.

Nairobi, Sunday
HOTELIER John Ward returned to Kenya today to search again for the
killer of his 28-year-old daughter Julie, whose remains were found in a
game park in 1988.
Mr Ward, from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, has made more than 40 trips to
Kenya since receiving the news of his daughter's disappearance while on
holiday in Kenya.
At first it was thought that Miss Ward had been killed by wild animals
in the Masai Mara reserve. Later two Kenyan game rangers were acquitted
of murder after a long trial.
Attorney-General Amos Wako said last year a new inquiry was being
opened.
Mr Ward said today that he had spent at least #400,000 in his search
for the truth of his daughter's death.
''I am trying to claim back my expenses from the Kenyan authorities,
and am considering a civil action in the Kenyan courts,'' he said.
He hoped to meet Kenyan police commissioner Shadrack Kiruki in
connection with information Mr Ward passed to the Kenyan police last
October.
''I gave him a statement from someone who claimed to be a witness to
the murder. I would like to know what further progress has been made in
the police investigation,'' he said.
He has recently obtained formerly secret American and Russian
satellite pictures of the game reserve which, he believes, will
facilitate the investigation.
Mr Ward said the British Government had been in contact with Kenya
over the matter, and he himself had met President Daniel arap Moi on an
earlier visit.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Sunday
BOSNIAN Serbs fired a mortar at a French cargo plane at Sarajevo
airport today, prompting a show of strength by Nato warplanes over the
capital, UN officials said.
Shooting and shelling then erupted between Muslim-led Bosnian
government troops and separatist Serb forces in the airport area, an
exchange which was continuing at dusk.
The French C-130 Hercules, the fifth aircraft to come under Serb fire
in Sarajevo in the past 10 days, was not hit. A Red Cross plane and
three UN aircraft were hit earlier by heavy machine-gun fire.
French UN troops responded to the mortar bomb by returning 10 rounds
of 20mm canon fire at the mortar position, said UN spokesman Alexander
Ivanko. ''It is not known whether they hit the position, but it is no
longer there,'' he said.
Nato war planes could be heard and seen high over the city in the
aftermath of the bombing. It was the first robust UN military response
to a string of Serb attacks on planes at the airport.
Humanitarian flights carrying food and medicine into the Bosnian
capital were halted nine days ago after the Red Cross transport plane
was hit.
UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and his top two military commanders in
former Yugoslavia narrowly escaped injury the following day when a Serb
heavy machine-gun round pierced their plane's passenger compartment.
Sarajevo's airport lies between government and Serb lines in a
populated area west of the city. UN officials say the Serbs often screen
their snipers and mortar positions by locating them in civilian areas to
make return fire risky.
The airport mortar bombing was followed by exchanges of fire between
government forces in the suburb of Hrasnica and Serb troops in Ilidza
and Vojkovici.
Serb forces in Ilidza also fired on a key government supply route
snaking down the face of Mount Igman into Hrasnica.
UN sources said seven rounds of heavy machine-gun fire raked the road,
where a truck driver was killed on Saturday after his vehicle ran off
the road while under Serb cannon fire.
A series of detonations followed shortly afterwards in Hrasnica. Local
hospital workers reached by telephone confirmed mortar bombs or
artillery shells were falling in the area.
The shooting coincided with a rise in sniping and shelling around the
city that have put the current ceasefire under severe strain.
The fragile ceasefire which took effect on New Year's Day has failed
to halt fighting in the northwest enclave of Bihac, and UN officials
fear the country is gearing up for more war when the truce expires on
May 1.
Serb snipers killed one civilian and wounded two in the Bosnian
capital today but UN workers helped to avoid further casualties by using
their vehicles to screen the wounded and four others pinned down by the
marksmen.
Serbs had opened fire on the group of seven people as they were
walking and gardening an open area near their homes.
PARIS: European nations will tomorrow seal a ''stability pact'' aimed
at defusing disputes before they turn into Yugoslav-style wars.
Foreign Ministers from the EU, Eastern Europe, the Baltic states, and
Russia will meet in Paris to celebrate agreements that deal with the
rights of ethnic minorities and sensitive questions of national borders.
The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe will take
over formal responsibility for the pact after the Paris meeting, which
at least 50 countries will attend.--Reuter.

Chris Holme examines the disturbing lack of intensive-care beds which
can mean patients who are fighting for their lives could find the odds
are suddenly stacked against them
INTENSIVE-CARE units represent the sharp end both of high-technology
medicine and the public's perception of the NHS.
They are intensive in every aspect: demanding the highest nursing and
anaesthetic skills and expensive monitoring equipment.
Each bed costs about #1200 a day to staff and run, five times that of
a bed in an ordinary ward and three times that of the intermediate
high-dependency ward. They are staffed 24 hours a day, every day of the
year, dealing constantly with the frontiers of life and death.
Intensive care is the area of the health service which promises
patients the most, a chance to fight for life -- but when patients have
to fight for a bed it reveals the NHS at its most wretched.
Retired miner James McGowan would have known something about this: two
of his daughters are nurses. But he never had his 30% chance of survival
because there was no bed for him at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
Sheriff John McGowan's call for a full investigation into
intensive-care bed provision throughout Scotland has been welcomed by
medical and nursing leaders.
The Scottish Office said it would study the sheriff's findings closely
and take appropriate action. In the meantime, it could start with its
own information systems.
According to Scottish Office figures, everything should be relatively
hunky-dory with the 250 staffed intensive-care beds in the country. This
is misleading, since it also includes coronary care units. Paediatric
and neurosurgical provision add further confusion.
There are no centrally collated figures of general intensive-care
beds. Such information is with health boards, trusts, or individual
clinicians. The best estimate would indicate about 100 general ICU beds
distributed throughout the country.
Various studies have been carried out on intensive-care provision,
including a UK survey by the Royal College of Anaesthetists two years
ago.
It found a worryingly high number of patients who had to be turned
away because hospitals were so busy, and some inappropriate usage of IC
beds by patients who would do just as well in a high-dependency ward.
College chief executive Sir Geoffrey de Deney said: ''It is a fairly
well-established fact that there are deficiencies in existing provision.
We are concerned that the situation should be improved and are taking
steps to that end, but the question of provision is really a matter for
the Government.''
Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley has called for a meeting of royal
colleges following the death of Malcolm Murray from Kent, who was flown
by helicopter to Leeds after no intensive-care bed could be found for
him near his home.
The willingness of the Government to tackle the problem was undermined
by the Prime Minister's initial gaffe that the 200-mile transfer may
have been due to superior clinical expertise in Leeds rather than plain
lack of beds in the London area.
Dr Peter Wallace, director of the intensive-care unit at Glasgow's
Western Infirmary, said: ''The London scene is really terrible as far as
beds go. I think we are a bit better than down south but we do have
similar problems to those faced in Birmingham and Manchester.''
''I welcome the sheriff's call for a review in Scotland. I just regret
that it has taken a patient's death and the press attention to come up
with it. This is a harsh thing to say, but I do not know if the problem
would have been addressed without the FAI and the publicity.''
Dr Wallace said there had been pressures on intensive care over the
past 20 years. While there had been very few cases of not being able to
find a bed, the workload on the service had been increasing.
He said actual provision at hospitals in Glasgow was lower than bed
complement: ''There may not be enough physical beds, but there certainly
have not been enough full-time staffed beds as far as nurses are
concerned.''
Every ICU team has to cope with peaks and troughs of demand. More than
half their patients arrive after complications following surgery, and
the remainder are medical or trauma cases.
Managers have to balance the running of the service to cope with the
unpredictable but not waste resources which could be employed elsewhere.
Each bed requires six nurses on the staff to run it during a year. The
day Mr McGowan died, four ICU nurses were off sick, the family's counsel
said.
The Royal College of Nursing said there was a national shortage of ICU
clinical specialists. These nurses, because of their skills and
training, are also at the higher G and H grades.
An RCN spokeswoman said: ''There is general pressure to downgrade
nurses to save costs, but clinical specialist nurses won't stay if they
are being downgraded. They may look as if they are more expensive, but
in fact they provide much better value for money and better patient
care.''
Ironically, a study of intensive-care beds and how they are used is
already under way by the Scottish Intensive Care Society. The secretary,
Dr Ian Armstrong, said the two-year project would look at 26 ICUs
throughout Scotland.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Office's response to Sheriff McGowan is still
awaited. Ironically, it has already sunk #35m into hospital and
intensive-care beds, but that was at the ill-fated HCI private venture
in Clydebank. It has provision for 64 ICU beds, of which only eight are
up and running.

Hebron, West Bank, Sunday
PALESTINIAN gunmen ambushed an Israeli bus in the West Bank city of
Hebron today, killing two Jewish settlers and wounding several others.
The guerrillas fired on the bus on its way from Jerusalem to Hebron,
scene of a mosque massacre of Palestinians by a Jewish settler in
February last year.
It was the most serious attack since 21 Israelis were killed in a
suicide bombing by Muslim militants north of Tel Aviv in January.
A spokesman for settlers in the area said at least six people were
wounded, one ''very critically''. Israel Television, quoting police
sources, said two people were killed.
Hospital sources in Jerusalem said the wounded included a 12-year-old.
Security sources said both of the dead were settlers and that one of
the men worked for Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a militant settler leader.
The shooting drew an immediate backlash from settlers in Hebron, scene
of a massacre of 29 Muslim worshippers in a mosque by US-born physician
Baruch Goldstein in February last year.
Witnesses said that after the shooting, settlers rampaged through
several Palestinian shops in Hebron before soldiers intervened and a
military curfew was imposed.
Settlers also shouted insults at an Israeli general who visited
Nebron's ''Glass Junction'' where the shooting occurred.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the ambush of the
civilian bus travelling from Jerusalem to Hebron, in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
However Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, one of the negotiators,
vowed that Israel-PLO talks on Palestinian self-rule would continue.
''The terrorists who carried out the attack want to delay and disrupt.
This is what they want to achieve, but they won't,'' he said.
Israel has demanded that PLO chairman Yasser Arafat prevent attacks
against Israelis, but Hebron is outside the areas he directly controls.
The incident was the first of its kind since Israel and the PLO
recently set July 1 as a target date for reaching an agreement on
expanding autonomy.
Gaza and the West Bank are still largely under an Israeli closure
imposed after the Beit Lid suicide bombing on January 22.
Hours before the shooting, Israel announced it was easing the edict
and raising to 24,150 the number of Palestinian workers allowed into the
Jewish state. Before the entry ban, some 60,000 Palestinians worked in
Israel.
Palestinians have accused Israel of using security concerns as an
excuse for delaying an expansion of self-rule, already postponed by a
year.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE MP who represents seven of the social workers and care assistants
in the case alleging child abuse in Ayrshire has written to Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang on behalf of his constituents expressing concern over
the proof hearing by Sheriff Colin Miller.
Scotland's leading judge, Lord Hope, later described the way in which
the children involved had been taken into care for five years as ''a
tragedy of immense proportions''.
In his letter, Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and
Doon Valley, criticises:
* The nature and conduct of the proof hearing by Sheriff Miller.
* The sheriff's report.
* The cost of legal aid and the number of lawyers involved in the
hearing.
* The use made of ''expert'' witnesses at the hearing.
* The implications for the children's hearing system.
* The current position of the children.
* Media coverage of the case.
Mr Foulkes, writing after a meeting with five of the seven
constituents involved, also appealed to Mr Lang to consider appointing
someone other than a lawyer and who has experience of child care to
interview everyone concerned in the case and to report back to him.
The MP suggested that these interviews should take place in private
and in non-confrontational settings and that the report to Mr Lang
should cover:
* The position of the children and whether any action needs to be
taken to protect them.
* The long-term implications of the Ayrshire case for the system of
child care, with particular respect to child abuse cases.
Mr Foulkes also expressed ''deep anxiety, concern and disquiet'' at
different aspects of the case as well as his concern for the interests
of both the children and of his constituents.
Writing of the conduct of the hearing, he told Mr Lang that lawyers,
guided by the sheriff, adopted ''highly adversarial procedures''.
He said that the social workers were at a severe disadvantage because
they were only legally represented in an indirect way by counsel for the
Reporter to the Children's Panel, while the families of the eight
children were represented by a total of 15 legal representatives who put
the social workers through ''long and arduous grillings''.
He also claimed that while great emphasis was placed on alleged
changes or inaccuracies in written accounts by social workers, there was
no criticism of the fact that police notebooks were not even available.
A copy of the MP's letter to Mr Lang was sent yesterday to the Rev
David Laing, chairman of Strathclyde region's social work committee,
which is due to meet on Wednesday to consider a report on the case by
the region's social work director.

A MORE powerful Accounts Commission to protect services threatened by
local government reorganisation has been promised by Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson, campaigning in Perth at the weekend.
With one eye on next month's local elections and the other fixed
firmly on the forthcoming parliamentary by-election, he said key
services such as education, concessionary fares, transport, and law and
order were under threat from the dismantling of regional councils and
Labour authorities would work together to protect and improve these.
''In the long term, Labour will put quality and reliability of
services on a firm basis to be supervised by a beefed-up Accounts
Commission,'' pledged Mr Robertson.
''We believe that the commission must have more power to test quality
as well as value for money in front-line services.
''Councils should be expected to submit their targets to the
commission on a regular basis. The present system has been a dismal
failure and has often created contracted-out and privatised, low
quality, low grade services.''
Mr Robertson said the reorganisation was a gerrymandered exercise to
push through privatisation based on the ''Tory obsession with selling
off the family silver'' and he predicted this would boomerang against
them.
''The Tory councils will not be helped by this political chicanery as
it rebounds on their campaign,'' he predicted, claiming that it was a
''scandalous'' stain on them that the cost of this most expensive
reorganisation of all would divert already scarce resources away from
education.
''Arrogance combined with electoral trickery are the Tory faces of
local government,'' he said. ''Labour has fought this carve-up and we
are still the only party which has the strength across Scotland to
cushion its effects.''
Giving an indication of the kind of issues and tactics we can expect
in the Perth and Kinross by-election campaign, Mr Robertson attacked the
Conservatives for reneging on promises of tax cuts at the last General
Election, and the SNP for failing to deliver the #10 cold weather
payment for the elderly promised at last year's regional poll.
Referring to the latter as a ''cynical betrayal'', he said: ''They
reneged on their promises as quickly as the Tories ditched their pledges
on tax. No matter how they try to dress up their failure, no-one can
every trust the SNP again.''
Mr Robertson promised that Labour would set targets covering planning,
housing, and education which would have to be met, and would adopt an
open-door policy giving the public maximum say in the running of the new
authorities.
He added: ''Trust has to be earned through sheer hard work. Unlike
other parties, we only promise what we know we can deliver. Let other
parties offer their gimmicks and their slick slogans. Honesty, hard
work, and professionalism will be the hallmark of the new Labour
councils.''

SCOTLAND'S midwives feel they must have the option of taking
industrial action as they grow increasingly angry about the Government's
1% pay offer, it was claimed last night.
Throughout Britain, members of the Royal College of Midwives have
voted to end the professional body's 115-year rule against industrial
action. They will now be balloted on what form of action to take.
Mrs Patricia Purton, the RCM's director in Scotland where it has 3800
members, said last night: ''Certainly, from talking to members, they
feel that they need that option now -- they need to be able to take
industrial action should they consider it necessary.
''They really feel that much of their activity is concerned with
keeping the system running. There is a sense of devaluation, a feeling
that they are being used to maintain the service which perhaps needs
more financing and certainly more personnel.''
Few members she had spoken to would be prepared to go on strike, she
added, but there was support for some other forms of industrial action.
Details of the vote to scrap the rule will be announced to the RCM's
governing body today. The council will then begin drafting a new
constitution and work out the next step in the pay campaign.
Members have been asked to say whether they would support seven
possible courses of action. These include:
* A total withdrawal of labour, with midwives refusing to attend
mothers in delivery rooms.
* Partial withdrawal of labour, involving a refusal to attend
ante-natal or post-natal clinics and an overtime ban.
Other possible action includes carrying out only graded duties;
refusal to carry out administrative duties; working to rule; or a
withdrawal of goodwill.
It is understood there has been ''considerable support'' for most
options.
Opposition to the national pay offer, which includes up to 2% to be
negotiated locally, has already been voiced by nurses who are
campaigning for the Government to scrap the deal.
However, the midwives' mood has been worsened by regrading and
down-grading, which has led to many taking pay cuts.

AUTHOR Alistair Campsie has appealed to all libraries who hold his
book debunking a piping legend to insert corrections to mysteriously
placed inaccuracies.
He wrote The MacCrimmon Legend, or The Madness of Angus MacKay, in
1976. The work resulted for him in almost two decades of recrimination
and insult.
He had retrieved MacKay's diagnosis from the archives of the Royal
Bethlehem and Maudsley Hospital at Beckenham, Kent, popularly known as
Bedlam.
Before the book was published, he says, someone tampered with the
manuscript.
He claims that the object was to bring the work into disrepute. To
some extent it did, and this resulted in a fierce attack on him in an
issue of the Piping Times, a publication that has always supported the
MacCrimmon Legend and which holds Angus MacKay to be one of the greatest
pipers ever.
Mr Campsie said: ''When I was recently in the National Library of
Scotland, the music librarian mentioned the book and I told him about
the errors written into it.'' He arranged for an erratum slip to be
inserted.
Mr Campsie's research found MacKay, Queen Victoria's first official
piper, to be anything but a great musician. ''MacKay was dragged off to
Bedlam after an indiscretion at Windsor Castle personally involving the
queen when he was raging drunk with 'ardent spirits' at Christmas,
1853,'' said Mr Campsie yesterday.
''He was firmly under the illusion that he was married to the Queen,
the royal children were his, and Prince Albert was depriving him of his
marital rights.
''What exactly the indiscretion was makes the mind boggle,
particularly as he was later diagnosed as 'the most dangerous (mental)
patient in England'.''
The book showed that because MacKay suffered from advanced cerebral
syphilis, he was mentally disturbed years before being certified.
In the manuscript names were apparently altered. So was MacKay's
diagnosis.
''This made nonsense of the scientific diagnosis at the time saying
that he had been mentally afflicted long before most of his work was
written,'' said Mr Campsie. He added that MacKay was probably clinically
insane from the age of 20.
He argues that MacKay's deranged musical settings were then foisted on
to pipers for years. MacKay himself claimed they were penned originally
by the MacCrimmons of Skye, who taught the greatest pipers for
generations.
Mr Campsie admits that the MacCrimmons existed, but says that they in
no way did what their legend proclaimed. His assertion caused shrieks of
rage in piping and academic circles.
He said yesterday: ''After the conversation in the National Library I
decided to make sure that all these books should have the correction
slip inserted, if only for future generations.
''Besides, it is time the entire matter was publicly discussed in an
adult manner and not with the vituperation which has so far accompanied
it.''

SCOTTISH fishermen are being ask to help save a monster of the deep
from being hunted to extinction. Basking sharks -- the second largest
fish in the world -- are thought to be in serious decline.
Once they were harpooned in their hundreds as they came to feed on the
rich plankton off the west coast of Scotland. Now an appeal is being
made to the present generation of fishermen to come to the rescue of
these gentle giants.
Conservationists are hoping to secure protection for basking sharks,
which can grow to more than 35ft and weigh four tons.
''We need a lot more information on basking sharks before we can put a
case for protection to the Government,'' said marine biologist Ken
Watterson.
''We want Scottish fishermen to report sightings so we can build up a
better picture of their current status.''
Basking sharks are thought to spend the winter in deep water and then
come to the surface in the summer months to feed.
Although their nearest relative is the predatory great white shark,
the diet of basking sharks is plankton, which they strain through gill
rakers.
Information from fishermen will be collated by the Basking Shark
Project which Mr Watterson runs on the Isle of Man, where basking sharks
are already protected.

<HEADLINE>Woman loses job after her criminal record is revealed</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE woman at the centre of an attempted #23m oil company fraud seven
years ago has been sacked from her job with an Aberdeen charity.
Mrs Alison Allen, 36, from Maud, Aberdeenshire, was dismissed last
Thursday from her #12,000-a-year job as a new technology tutor with
Rehab Scotland following newspaper reports that she had a criminal
record.
Rehab, which trains the victims of brain injury for work in local
business said publicly it would stand by Mrs Allen following the
reports. It had been unaware of her record when it employed her. But now
she has been dismissed.
The charity, which had come under pressure from the local business
community to get rid of her, has since claimed she gave misleading
information about her previous employment.
Rehab says that Mrs Allen, whose job included placing brain injury
victims in jobs after training, could no longer effectively work with
local businesses. She was sentenced to five years in prison, later
reduced on appeal to four, and served 20 months, for her part in what
was then the largest attempted fraud in Scotland.
Yesterday Mrs Allen said: ''I cannot say I blame Rehab. They have to
think about the charity. But I loved that job. It gave me a real buzz
and I felt I was contributing something.''
She is now taking legal advice over newspaper articles which brought
up her past and which she claims were misleading. .
''Under the Rehabiliation of Offenders Act I am not required to reveal
my previous conviction to an employer unless specifically asked. I was
not asked,'' said Mrs Allen.
Mrs Allen, whose maiden name was Anders, married her co-accused,
businessman Roy Allen, 42, in 1993 a year after they were released from
prison. They have restored a run-down croft and Mr Allen is a first year
mature student at Aberdeen University.
Mr Peter Davies, director of development for Rehab Scotland, said in a
statement: ''Our initial impression was that Mrs Allen had simply failed
to reveal her previous conviction. It now emerges that other aspects of
her application were grossly misleading.''
Mr Davies declined to say what those aspects were.
The loss of the job has come as a blow to the Allens who fear they
might have to sell their house.
''We do not deny we did what we did. And we have not asked for
sympathy. But it is in the past. How long do we have to go on paying?''
asked Mr Allen.
''If society is sending a message to all ex-cons that there is no way
back then it is making a rod to beat its own back.''
The Allens claim they never made a penny from their crime and never
sold their story. The couple became lovers in Aberdeen when they were
both working in the offices of oil company Britoil. He was married with
two children.
Alison Anders arranged the transfer of a #23m payment through her job
in Britoil. Their cut was to be #5m. But the deal went wrong. She fled
to the US on a false passport but returned 11 months later when police
arrested Mr Allen.

TWO crewmen died yesterday after being rescued from the freezing
waters of the North Sea when a cargo ship capsized in 25ft waves.
All five on board the 160ft Norwegian coaster Unlis were winched
aboard Norwegian rescue helicopters after their vessel overturned 150
miles east of Fraserburgh, said Aberdeen Coastguard.
But a coastguard spokesman confirmed later that two of the crew, who
had been flown to hospital in Stavanger, had died.
The Unlis sent out a distress signal shortly before 5am yesterday
saying she was listing in bad weather. A number of ships in the area
went to her aid, but she apparently capsized very quickly and the crew
took to the freezing water.

<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday warned his party not to be lulled
into a false sense of security by the ''virus of self-destruction''
infecting the Tories.
He signalled that the drive for party modernisation would continue in
the wake of his crucial National Executive Committee victory to scrap
the party's historic ties to public ownership.
Mr Blair risked upsetting union leaders by refusing to commit the
party to fixing a level for a minimum wage before the General Election.
He also appeared to push the prospect of regional assemblies in
England further into the future -- insisting they were a ''long way down
the road'' and possibly outside the lifetime of a new Labour government.
He told LWT's Jonathan Dimbleby programme that Labour must continue to
work on the ''bond of trust'' it had established with ordinary voters.
''There is a virus of self-destruction in the Conservative Party, but
it should not in any way make the Labour Party complacent,'' he said.
''The process of modernising the Labour Party, bringing it up to date,
making sure the bond of trust it has forged with the British people
continues, is an absolutely essential element of my leadership and of
the new Labour Party.''
He outlined plans for:
* Internal reforms to increase the power and number of members.
* New policies to help the ''underclass'' of long-term unemployed.
* A skills and training revolution to allow Britain to compete in the
twenty-first century.
Mr Blair said Labour remained committed to introducing a minimum wage
''as soon as we can'' but warned the necessary legislation would not be
in place the day after the General Election.
''I don't believe you can set a minimum wage in the abstract from the
economic circumstances. It is something that has to be discussed very
carefully with employers and those representing the workforce,'' he
said.
* The new Clause 4 passed its first test at the West Midlands regional
conference in Malvern. A motion that a Labour government should be
committed to renationalising gas, water and electricity was defeated by
312,000 votes to 67,000. An amendment calling for the party to stick to
the old Clause 4 was defeated by 271,000 to 34,000.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang, visiting the European Commission today,
should ''come clean'' and admit that his Government is preparing to
withdraw support from important rail services to the Highlands while the
Commission is pumping millions of pounds into its infrastructure.
This was the challenge issued yesterday by the MP for Ross, Cromarty
and Skye, Mr Charles Kennedy. Mr Lang is due to participate in a series
of ''familiarisation'' meetings at the EC and its new Commissioners
today.
Mr Kennedy asked him to brief both the transport commissioner, Mr Neil
Kinnock, and the regional policy commissioner, Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies,
over the proposed withdrawal of the Motorail and Fort William sleeper
services.
''Familiarisation has to be a two-way process. While it makes sense
for the Scottish Secretary to learn more about the new commissioners and
their policy ideas, he would be as well to come clean from the outset
over the fundamental downgrading which he is presiding over in the
Scottish transport infrastructure.''
Mr Kennedy argues that the Government had sought additional EC funds
to improve infrastructure in the Highlands, but has abused that
concession by undermining important transport services in the area.
He warned: ''The recent track record of the European Commission over
the use to which the UK Government puts additional structural funding is
a robust one. They dislike intentionally the abuse of the additionality
principle.''
Mr Kennedy said the European Commission was likely to look all the
more askance at this absurd situation when it considered that plans were
underway for Scottish rail links to the Continent via the Channel
Tunnel.
A Scottish Office spokesman said he did not know whether or not Mr
Lang would raise the subject of rail services while in Brussels.
Meanwhile, Mr Kennedy is to write to the chairman of the Commons
Select Committee on Transport requesting that it investigate press
reports of difficulties in securing London/Fort William sleeper
bookings.
''Sir Russell Johnston and myself have been receiving a steady stream
of reports over what appear to be calculated obstacles being placed in
the path of potential passengers wishing to book this service.
''If you look at the catalogue of events it is impossible now to
resist the conclusion that there has been carefully orchestrated
collusion among those seeking to axe this service,'' he claimed.
Mr Kennedy is pressing for a judicial review of the decision to cut
the services.

THE Scottish National Party in Clackmannan was celebrating last night
getting one up on its local Labour counterparts.
Last week at its local election launch the Labour Party claimed it had
the highest proportion of women candidates in any local authority area
in Scotland.
It said it was confident no other party in any unitary election area
in the country would proportionately beat its five women out of 12
candidates.
Unfortunately for Labour there was one other party, and that was one
on its own doorstep.
When polls closed last Tuesday, six out of 12 of the SNP-nominated
candidates for Clackmannan -- the smallest mainland unitary authority in
Scotland -- were women.
One interesting fight will be for the Alva ward where sitting
councillor Eva Comrie takes on two other women candidates. They are
Linda Greig of the Scottish Liberal Democrats and Esther Knox of Labour.
Mrs Comrie said last night that the local Labour Party had been
''embarrassed at being caught out'' about its claims on women
candidates.
''We had no idea the number of women they had planned to put up. We
also had no idea they were going to make such a claim. We have six good
women candidates in our ranks.''
Labour official Jim Thomson, who made the claim at the local election
launch, said last night he had laughed when he heard the SNP had beaten
the figure.
Mr Thomson, the party's local treasurer, said the SNP had got wind of
the number of women candidates Labour had.
''They had an idea we were fielding a number of good women candidates
and tried to get more,'' he said.
''Many of them are just nominal candidates. You will find they will
not put up much of a campaign.''
Mrs Comrie dismissed Mr Thomson's claims as ''nonsense'' and said
Labour was being petty to try and cover up its embarrassment.
* SNP leader Alex Salmond's grip on the key posts within the party was
tightened yesterday when Mr John Swinney was appointed as the party's
treasury spokesman in place of Mr Alex Neil.
Mr Neil, who is on the left of the party and a close friend of former
MP Jim Sillars, was never regarded as a natural ally of Mr Salmond. He
said yesterday that he was stepping down from the post because of
pressure of work.
''While my private business workload makes it no longer possible for
me to carry forward the vitally important task of convincing Scots of
the economic case for independence, I remain responsible for developing
SNP policy -- including economic policy -- as the party's policy
vice-convener,'' he added.
Mr Swinney, who is more in tune with Mr Salmond's views, also is the
SNP's vice-convener for publicity.
The position of Treasury spokesman will take on growing importance in
the months ahead as the Nationalists work out their policies on a
separate currency for Scotland and economic integration within the
European Union.

<TEXT>
AN emergency fund of #30,000, set up to help penniless students
continue their studies, has run out of money.
The Renfrew District Student Support Trust, which gained charitable
status 12 months ago, was established by the local authority to mark the
inauguration of the University of Paisley.
The provost, council leader, and two university representatives have
met regularly to consider applications and hand over payments to the
most needy cases.
But the local authority has now been told that demand is outstripping
resources, because so many of the students qualify for assistance in
line with the strict criteria specified by the trust.
In the past few weeks alone, #2800 has been awarded to 18 struggling
students to help them pay debts owed for accommodation, child care, and
even food.
The district council's managing director, Mr Andrew Cowe, is now
urging councillors to consider making a further donation to the fund
because of the pressing need.
The situation is to be discussed by the council's policy and resources
committee tomorrow.
Mr Cowe said: ''All of the recipients have received funds to meet a
variety of debts. In all of the cases they were ineligible for other
kinds of help, and struggling to continue on their courses in the face
of constant financial difficulties.
''Some were single parents, some were married to unemployed partners,
and some had health and disability problems.
''In the main, they did not qualify for help from other sources
available to the majority of students -- exactly the range specified by
the trust.''
He is recommending that councillors agree to contribute a further
#21,000 to the fund, and says he will accommodate the donation from his
own department's budget.

A KIRK committee has called on the Government to eliminate what it
calls the ''poverty trap'' by reforming personal taxation.
The Church and Nation Committee, which addresses economic and
industrial interests, made its call in a report published today and
which will come before the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in
May.
In the report, church members are also invited to examine their
attitude towards paying tax, regarding it as a responsible means of
sharing equitably the cost of public and community services.
The report points out that taxation is the mirror image of public
expenditure, while accepting it is unpopular among those who have to pay
it.
''Unpopular or not, the committee believes that a fair and equitable
system of personal taxation which allows each citizen to contribute to
the common good is the fairest means of paying for public expenditure,''
it adds.
Nevertheless, it says an anomaly remains in that more people pay
income tax and are still poor enough to qualify for income related
social security benefits and rebates.
In trying to move from depending on social security to regular earned
income, far too many people are still being caught in the poverty trap.
* The report also asks the assembly to encourage the Government to
co-operate with the European Union on improvement of the common
agricultural policy, ensuring support of rural society in Scotland.

<TEXT>
A DISPUTE has broken out between Fife Regional Council's former SNP
group leader and local party officials.
Councillor Paul Gillon has resigned from the party and is standing as
an independent in the unitary elections on April 6, after failing to win
selection for one of the Levenmouth seats.
In his resignation letter to SNP headquarters, Councillor Gillon, a
party member for 21 years and a regional councillor since 1987, claims
that he and his supporters have been subjected to ''many years of
vilification and abuse'' by SNP Central Fife constituency officials.
The former group leader claimed that local activists had been
prevented from forming their own branch, and although continuing to work
and raise funds for the party, ''were ostracised and ignored by the
constituency, in a personal, petty, vindictive, ill-mannered, and at
times vicious way''.
The letter continues: ''This culminated in an appalling manner when in
1994 a campaign contribution of #100 to the Dick Douglas Europe campaign
was returned because it did not come through the hands of the
constituency chairperson.''
Councillor Gillon also alleged that party members who did not follow
the party line were ''driven out by a group who considered themselves as
a political and campaigning elite''.
While refusing to comment on his resignation letter, Councillor Gillon
said that he had received many offers of support.
However Tricia Marwick, the SNP's Central Fife convener, said: ''Paul
is acting like a spoilt child blaming everybody but himself when the
local branch overwhelmingly voted for Councillor Bryan Thacker to stand
for election.
''The fact that he only makes claims of undemocratic practice when the
democratic decision is against him speaks for itself.''

<RECORDNO>979304705</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND has fared relatively well in two new surveys of pay and
employment opportunities -- but critics have warned there are still
serious economic problems.
Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman claims that research has
shown that of 11 regions surveyed, eight have a worse record for low pay
than Scotland, where around one in 20 workers earn less than #2.50 an
hour. Around a quarter of those get less than #1.50.
The area with the worst record of low pay -- according to the figures
from the Labour Force Survey -- was Yorkshire and Humberside, where
around 10% of the workforce earned less than #2.50 an hour.
Even regions such as the South-east of England and East Anglia had a
worse record of low pay than Scotland according to the survey, while
only Wales and Greater London fared better.
Director of the Low Pay Unit Chris Pond said that though a high number
of Scots were paid more than #2.50 an hour, many earned well below the
European Union decency threshold of #5.88 an hour.
Mr Pond said: ''There's a major problem of poverty pay in Scotland.
You would probably find that the percentage difference between low pay
in the regions is relatively small.''
He added that a recent study had found that Scotland had one of the
lowest weekly full-time earnings' levels in the country, with pay rises
half the British average.
Scottish Shadow Employment spokesman, Mr John McFall, said the level
of low pay was ''scandalous''. The Labour MP for Dumbarton, said: ''Low
pay is a national scandal and it could get worse if the Tories continue
with the privatisation of local services.
''Labour in Scotland will implement a minimum wage to end this
scandal. By cutting wages and scrapping the Wage Councils, which
protected pay for 220,000 Scots, the Conservatives are increasing
insecurity for working people.''
Ms Harman said: ''These figures are an indictment of the widening gap
between rich and poor. While directors of privatised utilities award
each other massive pay awards and share options, people on low wages are
becoming more and more insecure.''
Meanwhile, a survey by the employment services agency, Manpower,
showed that job prospects in Scotland for the second quarter of 1995 are
the best in the country.
The survey, which was conducted among more than 2000 firms, found that
employers in Scotland said they were more likely to take on new staff
than those in any other area.
Overall, 20% of the Scots questioned said they were likely to increase
the size of their workforce -- well above the national average of 12%.
Mr McFall said he welcomed any job creation but added that the
underlying economy was still weakening. A seasonal rise in employment
was expected at this time of year, he said.

HISTORIC links between Scotland and the Imperial Court of Catherine

For the past six years Father Zverev has led a group of Russian
Christians which has been rebuilding the cathedral of St Sofia Sobor,
near St Petersburg, as the focus of a religious community.
More than 200 years ago Catherine the Great recruited Scots architect
Charles Cameron to build the cathedral. Cameron, in turn, hired Scots
craftsmen.
An association of Scottish charities, the Cameron Foundation, has been
established to provide humanitarian aid for the poverty-stricken
Orthodox community.
A spokesman said: ''The congregation of St Sofia are asking for
prayers of support from their new friends in the West. They need
clothing and footwear for the tired old, and ragged young, many of whom
face -40 degrees of frost with only broken shoes.
''They need cement and cable and building materials of every kind.
They need instruction from skilled tradesmen who can teach them how to
rebuild their church and their community.
''They need guidance on land reclamation and husbandry. They need
expert advice on treating alcoholism and converting the most hopeless
convicts into contributing members of society.''
The foundation, based in Westbourne Gardens, Glasgow, invited Father
Zverev to visit Scotland.

BUSINESSMAN Hugh Crout keeps a tight hold on Shona, a black cross
labrador/collie, after she went missing from the family home on
Lochardil Estate, Inverness, in a bid to track down her mistress who
went into hospital nearly two weeks ago.
Mrs Christine Crout, 58, who suffers from Hodgkin's disease, had been
admitted for a fortnight's respite care to Craig Phadraig Hospital,
Inverness.
The dog, which had twice been in the car with Mr Crout, 64, when he
went to visit his wife at the hospital, went missing last Tuesday. Mr
Crout and his son Hugh jnr, 36, had searched in vain for the dog.
Yesterday, however, after Mr Crout had arranged for an appeal for
information about the lost animal to be broadcast by Moray Firth Radio,
the missing eight-year-old bitch was finally tracked down -- in the
hospital grounds, two miles from the family home.

<TEXT>
FUTURE Royal Navy warships could be designed as trimarans following a
series of studies by naval experts, it was revealed yesterday
The revolutionary concept is being taken seriously by Royal Navy
chiefs, who are looking for new frigate designs to go into service
beyond the year 2010.
Encouraging work has been carried out by London University and the
Defence Research Agency's hydrodynamic test centre, officials said.
Model testing of a frigate design with a 150-metre trimaran hull is
already under way.
And trials indicate trimaran hulls have significant advantages over
traditional single-hulled vessels in rough seas.
The greater stability and the opportunity to site the flight deck at
the centre of the ship will allow helicopters to operate in rougher
weather.
The trimaran hull, the oldest form of sea-going ship, has much lower
resistance to the water so a ship is able to move much more quickly
while using the same amount of power as a single hull.
A presentation on the possible use of a trimaran design for future
warships will be given by the Navy's future projects department at the
International Maritime Defence Exhibition at Greenwich later this month,
but sources stressed that the use of trimarans was still at the concept
stage.

THE last shift on Britain's most northerly lighthouse today will
clamber aboard a helicopter and leave the famous tower to the ravages of
the wind, the waves and a computer.
There will be no departing ceremony on Muckle Flugga, only sad moments
of private reflection for the last keepers, Mr John Stevenson, Mr Andy
Wilson and Mr Allan Chamberlain.
''We will be glad to leave in a way,'' said Mr Stevenson, an Orcadian
who is moving from one end of Shetland to the other to work on the Fair
Isle lighthouse.
''Yet we will be sorry. This place has been our second home for the
past three and a half years.
''It is a miserable place in the winter during the storms but it has a
kind of magnetism, a special drawing power.''
Muckle Flugga stands 200ft high on a clump of rock one mile north of
the island of Unst.
The lighthouse has been manned continuously since it was established
during the Crimean War of 1854-56.
Robert Louis Stevenson's father, Thomas, and his uncle, David, built
the 54ft tower and a permanent light appeared in January 1858 at a cost
of #32,000.
Stevenson himself was taken by his father to Muckle Flugga -- a visit
which, according to local legend, influenced the writing of Treasure
Island.
Now only a computer will be left in charge of the light.
As Muckle Flugga goes automatic, keepers on the Northern Lighthouse
Board's most southerly light also will be packing their bags.
The Calf of Man, at the south end of the Isle of Man, is to join the
growing ranks of unmanned lighthouses on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
THE Roman Catholic Church in Scotland is to be urged to consider
setting up an independent team of experts to deal with any future sex
abuse allegations within the Church.
This is understood to be the main recommendation which will be made
next week to a 10-strong working party set up by bishops in response to
scandals which threatened the Church.
It is envisaged that the unit would consist of one permanent member
who would be able to call on other experts as required.
The adoption of such a group would take the heat off the Church, which
stood accused of putting its credibility ahead of the law following
allegations of sexual abuse last year.
Cardinal Thomas Winning, the Archbishop of Glasgow, said then that it
was not the Church's responsibility to go to the police with allegations
of child sex abuse.
The working party was set up following revelations that a 34-year-old
Strathclyde man was allegedly abused by two priests when he was a
14-year-old trainee priest at Blairs College near Aberdeen. He was paid
#42,000 in compensation.
More recently, claims that a priest in a Dunbartonshire parish had
been abusing boys without being brought to justice caused concern among
Scotland's 750,000 Roman Catholics.
Four members of the working party finalised a draft consultation
document in Motherwell at the weekend.
Mr Alan Draper, the working party chairman, said yesterday that he was
hopeful that a prepared interim report would point the way forward for
bishops to adopt a policy for handling allegations of sexual abuse in
future.

THE Labour Party has welcomed the privatisation of the Ministry of
Defence's Benbecula rocket range. It claimed the move will save more
than 300 jobs.
Mr Calum MacDonald, Labour MP for the Western Isles, last night
applauded the Government plans to put 150 military and 143 civilian
posts out to private contract, just one year after the Royal Artillery
Range Hebrides faced possible closure.
He said: ''This marks the successful outcome of a magnificent
community effort last year to stop the closure of the base. I hope the
base's future is now secure for the foreseeable future.
''But there is still the potential of redundancies, and we have to
guard against the impact on various individuals.''
Under new proposals, announced by Mr Nicholas Soames, Minister of
State for the Armed Forces, the Government will extend the scope for
private contracting for the operation and maintenance of tracking and
surveillance radar, telemetry equipment, and other services at
Benbecula.
In a letter to Mr MacDonald, the Minister says the proposals will
affect the executive control and military activities at the base in two
stages.
An initial contract extension will offer the employment of 150
military posts and 92 civilian jobs -- involved in the day-to-day
running of the range -- to private commercial contract.
A further 50 civilian jobs will be put out to contract by January 1,
1997, with the possibility of further expansion of private employment
after that date.
Mr Soames said: ''The risk of redundancies is considered to be low.
The Transfer Undertaking Protection of Employment (TUPE) will apply, and
surplus mobile civilians could be found posts elsewhere.''
The Minister added that full consultation over the proposals would
take place locally and with national trade unions.
A year ago, the Benbecula range was earmarked for closure as part of
the Government's Front Line First review aimed at cutting #750m from its
defence budget.
However, on July 14, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind announced that
plans to move missile work from Benbecula to the MoD range at Aberforth
in Wales had been ruled out due to ''the substantial costs involved''.
He said that technical problems, including the ''uniquely large danger
area'' to the west of Benbecula, had also ruled against the transfer of
facilities to Aberforth, and that the Hebrides base would be saved.
Sources within the MoD said Benbecula had been saved at the expense of
the firing ranges at Dundrennan near Kirkcudbright, Lavington, and
Pendine in Wales.
However, the proposed restructuring of the Western Isles base after a
planned transfer of control from the Director Royal of Artillery last
April had been delayed until yesterday's option was announced.
Mr MacDonald said last night that, despite the privatisation nature of
the new deal for Benbecula, it meant more local employment through the
conversion of military posts to civilian jobs.
''It is to be welcomed that most military jobs are likely to go to
qualified locals who make their permanent home on the islands,'' he
said.
He added that many of these would probably be employed by Serco, the
existing contractor at the base.
''This has all come about against the background of closure last year.
But we must also consider the conditions of the existing local work
force as well and I hope that these can be protected,'' he added.

THE deadline to subscribe to a share of the Scottish coal industry is
11 days away, and it appears that miners have so far shown a lukewarm
response.
A statement is expected today giving the latest position on an offer
to the 1000 employees of the newly formed Scottish Coal Company, whose
parent body is Mining (Scotland) Ltd.
Miners and managers alike have been given the opportunity to buy
between 1000 and 20,000 shares valued at #1 each. However, a source
close to the negotiations has indicated that, while around 20% of the
workforce has shown an interest in the issue, management make up the
overwhelming number of subscribers.
Dr Ian Preston, new chairman of Mining (Scotland), recently revealed
that a first group of 40 miners at Longannet had had the proposal
outlined to them at a meeting at the complex. A series of similar
meetings have been staged there and at opencast sites throughout
Scotland.
The new coal company has reached agreement with the Clydesdale Bank to
offer employees personal loans over periods of between one and five
years and at substantially reduced rates.
Mining (Scotland) has stated that it wants to bring its entire
workforce into the share subscription and at present a significant
tranche of shares, representing 15% of the company, is on the table.
The new company is a partnership between public companies and trade
unions -- with Mr Campbell Christie, STUC general secretary, already a
board member. It bought over the assets of British Coal north of the
Border in a #45m deal at the end of last year.
Dr Preston said the share offer represented a tremendous opportunity
for employees and that he was delighted to have been able to negotiate
favourable terms on their behalf with the bank.
Yesterday Mr George Bolton, Scottish president of the National Union
of Mineworkers, said he was personally unaware of how the take-up of the
share option was proceeding.
''It is unfortunate for the new company that we have experienced fault
problems at Longannet, but I am sure they will be overcome. Faulting is
a problem with its seams.''
Castlebridge, the only remaining deep mine in Scotland, is being
worked on.
''So far as the share deal goes, I have heard stories of miners
prepared to take shares worth several thousand pounds, but we must wait
and see.''
Pitmen have until March 31 to make up their minds about committing
themselves financially to the future of their industry.

A SCHEME aimed at attracting back those who have left the area to find
jobs elsewhere in the UK, has been launched by the Western Isles
Education Business Partnership.
The Western Isles Opportunity Project will publish a newsletter of job
openings and information on social and economic development.
The business partnership is a joint body comprising Western Isles
Enterprise, the local council, and members of the business community.
The newsletter follows a survey of 3390 former school pupils who left
secondary education between 1960 and the early 1990s. It asked their
opinions on why they had left and if they would consider returning.
Partnership secretary Ellis Campbell said: ''One of the most important
survey findings was that a majority of exiles said they would return to
the Western Isles if they could find suitable exployment.''

<TEXT>
A NEW childbirth unit, to be managed and staffed by midwives, is to
open at Ayrshire Central Hospital in Irvine on Friday.
The unit will relieve congestion in the hospital's obstetric maternity
unit -- one of the largest in Scotland -- and offer women the chance to
give birth as naturally as possible.
The midwife unit has been designed along the lines of a hotel. It will
have four delivery rooms, half as many as the main obstetric unit. Two
of the rooms are existing ones which have been enlarged and refurbished,
and the other two are new build.
Ms Kate Docherty, clinical services manager, said: ''It is markedly
different from the obstetric unit. Many women are fearful of coming into
a hospital environment. They like to have their babies in somewhere
similar to home. We want to provide them with that so they will relax
during childbirth.''
There will be no epidural pain relief -- only warm baths, massage, and
TENS (Transcultaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation). Pain relief
injections and gas and air are available but only on request.
Monitoring of the baby in the womb will be done by mechanical
hand-held instruments and not by electronic monitoring which can
distress the foetus.
The main criterion for eligibility to the unit is the wish for a
natural childbirth. Ms Docherty said: ''Women will be allowed to
progress naturally through their labour. Unlike doctors we look on women
and childbirth as a whole -- and not as an event through-time.''
The women must also, however, be of relatively low risk, without
previous obstetric or medical problems.
Dr Drew Walker, Ayrshire and Arran Health Board's public health
director, has warned that women expecting to deliver their babies in the
midwife unit could be disappointed.
Referring to a study published last November of a similar unit in
Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, he said: ''There is some evidence that
where a midwife unit is based alongside an obstetric unit there is a
higher transfer rate to the obstetric unit than is necessary.''
Earlier this year a proposal by Ayrshire and Arran Health Board to
extend maternity facilities by basing a midwife unit at the District
General Hospital, Ayr, which has no obstetric unit, was turned down,
although Ayr and its surrounding areas has a population of 70,000.
Ms Docherty said: ''Midwives had mixed feelings on this. Why should we
have to go on our own to provide that service? Why can't we work with
our (obstetrics) colleagues to provide women with the best of both
worlds?''
Dr Walker commented: ''I would hope that in time, by working at the
Ayrshire Central Unit, midwives will grow in confidence and therefore
feel happier about a stand-alone unit in Ayr. That would offer pregnant
women a real choice.''

CONSPIRACY theories are easy to wrap around any secret Government
activity, and easier for those adversely affected to accept.
But for a Government to conspire knowingly to cause physical harm to
22,000 of its own citizens in the name of science is a more difficult
scenario to believe.
The extent of a 40-year cover-up of the radiation exposure suffered by
22,000 servicemen who witnessed Britain's atom bomb tests between 1952
and 1958, is now being revealed.
A file of secret and declassified official documents has been passed
to The Herald just two days after an English nuclear test victim won a
25-year pension battle with defence chiefs, and two months since three
Scottish victims won a legal breakthrough in the European courts.
Mr Ken McGinley, the chairman of Johnstone-based British Nuclear Tests
Veterans' Association is damning: ''There has been a cover-up on a
massive scale -- it is more to do with personal sensitivity than
anything else, as many of the Government scientists involved in the
tests are still alive, while many of our members who served their
country loyally have died or are dying from incurable cancers and other
life-threatening diseases.''
The documents speak for themselves:
''We think it likely that the Australians will ask us for filters
which have been flown at Mosaic and Buffalo,'' said British Government
scientist Sir William Penney in a secret memo to Sir Frederick Brundrett
at the MoD on December 22, 1955 -- five months before the first of the
code-named A-Bomb tests took place in the Monte Bello Islands and
Maralinga Desert.
''While I am not very keen on giving them samples, I do not see how we
can refuse,'' continued Sir William. ''I am recommending that, if they
ask us, we give them a little piece of the filters, but we wait a few
days so that some of the short-lived isotopes have decayed a good
deal.''
The extent of the cover-up becomes more apparent in a wired memo from
Admiral Brooking at the British Atomic Weapons Establishment at
Aldermaston to the Australian Government in May 1957.
''May we please have your authority to include the following sentence
about Buffalo in the openly published report 1956/57 of the UKAEA: The
Australian Safety Committee made a careful check of conditions before
and after the firing of every round, and was satisfied that no hazard to
the people or stock of Australia was caused by any of the explosions at
Monte Bello or Maralinga.''
In 1993, the British Government finally agreed to pay the Australian
Government #20m as the first instalment to clean up the radioactive
pollution at Maralinga.
A letter from Sir William Penney to Sir Edwin Plowden, of October 1,
1955, refers to the planned tests at Monte Bello the following summer,
and says health and safety precautions were fixed for a 25 kiloton blast
for ''the first shot'' and 80 kilotons at the second.
He adds: ''We do not know exactly what the yield is going to be
because the assembly is very different from anything we have tried
before.''
As it turned out, the ''first shot'' on May 16, 1956, gave a yield of
just 15 kilotons, but the second a massive 98 kilotons and, with the
winds drifting the fall-out cloud, it was virtually uncontrolled.
Another top-secret memo to the Chiefs of Staff Committee, dated May 20
-- seven months after the first atom bomb test at Monte Bello and five
months before the second at Emu Field, South Australia -- gives evidence
of the official intention.
It says: ''The Army must discover the detailed effects of the various
types of explosion on equipment, stores, and men with and without
various types of protection.''
The complicity is pivotal in one memo dated November 16, 1955, from
British Prime Minister Anthony Eden.
Asked to consider the genetic effects of nuclear radiation, Mr Eden
says: ''A pity, but we cannot help it.''
Yet the risks to health from radiation exposure were known at the
highest level.
In minutes from the Government's Advisory Council in 1947 on
Scientific Policy, Sir Ernest Rock Carling said that resulting injuries
from exposure to radiation ''were frequently not traced to radiation
since there might be a lag of months or years before the effects were
manifest.
''Carelessness might also have serious genetic effects on the
population, resulting in sterility or mutations.''
In 1951, the Government warned that: ''Casualties may not become
apparent at once. There are at present only two forms of protection
against radiation, viz distance and/or some form of shielding.''
The first British nuclear test at Monte Bello took place a year later.
For that and 20 further tests, British service personnel stood
part-naked or wearing flimsy cotton overalls on beaches and ship decks
between five and 11 miles from each blast.

THE deputy governor of the Bank of England, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, has
been given the backing of his chief, Mr Eddie George, following
newspaper disclosures about his love life, he said.
According to the Sunday Mirror, three-times married Mr Pennant-Rea
began a relationship with freelance journalist Mary Ellen Synon, 44,
four years ago.
The couple made love on the carpet in the governor's private dressing
room at the bank, the paper said.
It said they knew each other from student days at Trinity College,
Dublin, but the affair began while Mr Pennant-Rea was editor of the
Economist.
The relationship continued after he took up the number two position at
the Bank of England in 1993.
Mr Pennant-Rea, 47, said he had spoken to his chief and had received
Mr George's backing to remain in his job.
In a statement, Mr Pennant-Rea said: ''I regret the decision by a
newspaper to publicise such personal matters.
''I have discussed the position with the governor and we are both
entirely satisfied that I remain able to function effectively as deputy
governor.
''The facts of the relationship are entirely private to the other
party and to my wife and our family. I do not intend to comment
further.''
Mr Pennant-Rea was at home yesterday as his 10-year-old daughter,
Emily, welcomed guests to her birthday party.
Birthday balloons festooned the front gates of the house at
Milton-under-Wychwood, Oxfordshire.
Mr Pennant-Rea told callers that he had no further comment about the
publicity over his private life.

HE man in charge of the M77 extension last night dismissed claims that
the company was preparing to evict protesters from their Pollok Estate
camp in Glasgow's South Side.
Mr Dan Pollard, roads director for Wimpey, said he had visited the
camp on Friday to inform them of the company's intention to fell a small
number of nearby trees in the next two weeks.
Protesters yesterday released a statement to the media claiming Mr
Pollard had warned them they would be evicted in this period, and ''that
it would be sooner rather than later.''
Last night Mr Pollard insisted: ''We did not tell them we would evict
them. We visited to tell them, as we have done all along, of our plans
for work close to the camp.
''We are well aware there are women and children in the camp, and we
do not want to cause any undue alarm or distress.''
Publically the company are continuing their attempts to co-operate
with the protesters but privately the value of such efforts is
increasingly being questioned.

THE DEATH toll on Scottish mountains will come under the spotlight
this week as the Crown takes the unusual step of holding a fatal
accident inquiry into one of the tragedies.
The inquiry, viewed by many as a test case, will focus attention on
the dangers facing climbers and their rescuers, and could have
far-reaching implications for safety on the hills.
It starts today at Dingwall Sheriff Court. It will investigate the
death of Dr Katharine Herd, 28, who was killed in an avalanche in
January last year. She was swept 400ft down a gully on the 3456ft
Liathach in Wester Ross, and died later from her injuries.
Accident inquiries are normally held into deaths during a person's
work, and not routinely called for in the case of mountain deaths.
However, in this case the Crown has used discretionary powers to call an
inquiry as it feels the circumstances and possible implications are in
the public interest.
The inquiry, which is expected to last up to a week, will hear from
nearly 30 witnesses and is likely to cover topics such as access to the
mountains, avalanche warnings, and the role of mountain rescue teams.
It is believed this is the first inquiry in Scotland to discuss such a
range of evidence.
Procurator-fiscal Ray Craig, from Aberdeen, an expert mountaineer, is
being drafted in for the inquiry. The procurator-fiscal at Dingwall, Mr
David Hingston, who has done much of the groundwork, said: ''In view of
the technicalities involved in the case, it was decided that a fiscal
with climbing experience should handle it.''
The investigation is being held at a time when there is growing
concern over the number of deaths on Scottish mountains. Already this
year, 16 people have died in accidents on the hills, and there are six
more missing presumed dead.
Dr Herd lived in Cruden Bay and was a GP in Peterhead. Her death in
January 1994 came days before she was due to start a new job in
Inverness. She was one of three climbers under instruction by mountain
guide Kevin O'Neill when a snow slab came loose and tons of debris
carried them down the mountain.
Despite suffering serious head injures in the fall, Mr O'Neill, 40,
from Lochcarron, who was climbing alongside the trio, staggered for
miles to raise the alarm. He reached his car and was driving to get help
when he was stopped by rescuers, who were already out looking for him.
One of his students, Marcus Cross, 17, also from Lochcarron, had also
made his way off the mountain to alert rescuers after making comfortable
Dr Herd and the fourth climber, Robin Dawson, 26, from Dumfries.
Dr Herd, an experienced climber and skier, was flown by helicopter to
Skye and then Glasgow's Southern General Hospital, but died from her
injuries.
Originally from Cumbria, the GP had been at the practice in Peterhead
for only 18 months after completing her training. She was taking a
holiday before starting as a senior house officer in obstetrics at
Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.
Her father, Mr Brian Herd, stood down as the Liberal Democrat
prospective candidate for Cumbria-North Lancaster in the Euro-elections
after the accident.
The inquiry has been welcomed by Mr Seamus McNally, leader of the
Torridon Mountain Rescue Team, which was involved a search for Dr Herd's
party.
Mr McNally, who will not give evidence himself, said: ''I believe this
is the first one of its kind and is going to be a test case.
''It could be a good thing to have matters discussed so long as its
does not apportion blame. It could have the effect of getting home the
safety message to people and that, even if they are experienced and well
equipped, things can go wrong. Some people tend to rely on rescue teams
coming along to take them off.
''I don't think anyone has anything to hide, although the system is
never 100%. It is fallible in some ways and they may look at ways of
tightening things up.''
* Police last night appealed for help in identifying a climber found
dead on 3210ft Scafell Pike, Cumbria. The man's body was yesterday
recovered from near the summit by Wasdale mountain rescue team.
The 5ft 11in, 11st man was wearing a blue jacket and black tracksuit
bottoms, both made by Gortex, and black leather walking boots. He was
carrying a Swiss-made Recta compass.

SENIOR Tories yesterday rallied around embattled Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke and issued a strong plea for party unity after he had come under
furious assault from the right.
An editorial in the Conservative Way Forward magazine -- which is
edited by senior right-winger Sir George Gardiner -- accused the
Chancellor, a leading pro-European, of ''pushing his own agenda'' to the
detriment of Mr Major.
It said Mr Clarke was preventing the party from voicing its true
instincts, and stated: ''It is essential that in the next election, the
Prime Minister must be seen to speak for the British people. Mr Clarke
must not allow himself to get in the way.''
The Chancellor's assertion that monetary union without political union
was possible was dismissed as an ''insult to the intelligence of party
members''. The editorial said: ''If control of the country's monetary
policy, currency, and interest rates is handed over to European bankers,
then they have control too over how much our Government can borrow and
spend, and its entire taxation policy.
''If this is not a gigantic step towards political union, then we
would like to know what is. Mr Clarke must stop trying to pull the wool
over the eyes of the British people. If he wishes to promote such
federalism in disguise, he should join the rump of the party represented
by Sir Edward Heath and Lord Howe.''
Yesterday, however, Ministers and others rallied round and there were
pleas for unity in the build-up to the forthcoming local elections.
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo, frequently touted by the right
as a leadership rival to Mr Clarke, said such personalised attacks would
not help the party.
He told BBC Radio's World This Weekend programme: ''I have not read
this thing but I thought it was mainly to do with the question of views
on a single currency and I regard that now as a matter of history. The
time for factions is now past. We are getting too close to the election
for factional struggle. What we need to do is turn our guns on the enemy
-- the Labour Party.''
Mr David Hunt, the man charged with co-ordinating presentation of
Government policy, expressed full confidence in Mr Clarke. The
Government was winning the battle over the economy but losing the battle
for presentation of its achievements.
Mr David Mellor, the Putney MP, told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost: ''He
(Mr Clarke) is an able man, and God knows the Government has few enough
of them.''
Sir George, MP for Reigate, is also chairman of the 92 Group of Tory
MPs -- the largest Conservative back-bench grouping in the Commons,
which is due to meet at Westminster today to discuss the state of the
party in the run-up to the local elections.
Yesterday, he was unrepentant. He said Mr Clarke's style led him to
include passages in speeches or make references in interviews without
thinking through properly what the effects on other people would be.
Mr Clarke, he told the BBC, ''clearly wants to support the Cabinet
line -- it's just that occasionally he strikes out on his own, and
sometimes with rather embarrassing results''.
The right-wing attack comes as Mr Major looks set to suffer a setback
tomorrow in a Commons vote on the Common Agricultural Policy.
While the Government appears not to be in danger of losing the vote
unless the Liberal Democrats and Ulster Unionists back Labour, most of
the nine whipless Tory rebels are likely to abstain.
One rebel, Sir Richard Body, MP for Holland-with-Boston, said he could
not vote for the Common Agricultural Policy -- ''stuff Europe, I say''
-- but declined to say whether he would vote against or abstain in the
Commons vote.

EXCLUSIVE
THE extent of a 40-year cover-up of the radiation exposure suffered by
22,000 servicemen who witnessed Britain's atom bomb tests in the 1950s
has been revealed in a file of de-classified and secret Government
documents.
They demonstrate a willingness to ignore or conceal the impact of 21
British nuclear tests between 1952 and 1958 on the part of then Prime
Minister Anthony Eden.
When asked to consider the genetic effects of nuclear radiation, Mr
Eden says, in a memo dated November 16, 1955: ''A pity, but we cannot
help it.''
The documents were passed to The Herald just two days after an English
nuclear test victim won his 25-year battle with defence chiefs for a
pension following intervention by the High Court, two months after three
Scottish victims won a legal breakthrough in the European courts.
Last Friday, the Rev Laurence Deverall, 60 -- who was exposed to
radiation in the 1956 Maralinga tests in South Australia -- won his case
for a disability war pension.
Mr Deverall developed cancer in his right leg as a result of the
radiation exposure. His leg was amputated in 1970.
Mr Ken McGinley, chairman of the Johnstone-based British Nuclear Test
Veterans' Association, said the case was the first major breakthrough on
Government liability.
On January 27, Scots-born US advocate, Mr Ian Anderson, won the first
stage regarding admissibility of evidence in a test case before the
European Court of Human Rights on behalf of two nuclear test veterans
and the 27-year-old daughter of a third Glaswegian victim -- all members
of the veterans' association.
Now the file of more than 40 secret and de-classified memorandums
passed to The Herald could add weight to hundreds of compensation cases
being fought by the veterans' association on behalf of its 3500 members.

THE Queen arrived in South Africa yesterday for the country's first
state visit by a British monarch in 48 years.
It was a historic moment. The Queen had returned to the new South
Africa, welcoming the country back into the fold of Commonwealth nations
after the isolation of apartheid.
Her British Airways Boeing 767 jet, named City of Cork and flying the
Royal Standard, touched down at Cape Town's D F Malan airport -- named
after the former National Party leader -- at 11.25am local time.
At the airport to greet her was deputy president Thabo Mbeki.
Three-year-old Zanele Ngakane, the daughter of Mr Mbeki's personal
assistant, presented a bouquet of roses.
The Queen walked the short distance across the airport tarmac to a
waiting South African Air Force Puma Oryx helicopter which took her to
nearby Simontown naval base to board the Royal yacht Britannia.
In the background, Cape Town's famous Table Mountain rose into a blue
sky splashed wih white clouds.
There was little ceremony. Instead, the official welcome by President
Nelson Mandela, complete with 21-gun salute, national anthems, and Guard
of Honour, was to take place this morning when Britannia sails into Cape
Town harbour.
The Duke of Edinburgh arrived later from Madagascar, where he has been
on business for the Worldwide Fund for Nature. He was joining the Queen
on Britannia yesterday afternoon.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who is on Government business in the
south of France, arrives today to accompany the Queen and the Duke
during their seven-day visit.
It was felt appropriate the royal party should have the night on board
Britannia to recover from the 11-hour flight from Britain.
The Queen will tour six townships, address the new multi-racial
parliament, and travel throughout South Africa, visiting Cape Town,
Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, and Port Elizabeth. The Duke will also
visit Kimberley and the north-west of the country.
There will be visits to the townships of Khayelitsha, Langa, New
Brighton, Missionvale, Soweto, and Umlazi.
The Queen and the Duke will meet a broad cross-section of the
political leadership in South Africa, including former president F W de
Klerk, but are not expected to see President Mandela's estranged wife
Winnie Mandela.
The Queen last visited South Africa in 1947 when, as Princess
Elizabeth, she and Princess Margaret accompanied the King and Queen on a
65-day tour.
In a 21st-birthday broadcast from Cape Town, she pledged a lifetime's
service to Britain and the Commonwealth.
She said: ''I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be
long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our
Great Imperial Family to which we all belong, but I shall not have the
strength to carry out this resolution alone unless you join in it with
me, as I now invite you to do.''
The Duke of Edinburgh visited the new South Africa last May when he
attended President Mandela's inauguration.
The Princess Royal also paid an official visit last November.
* The development of Cape Town's historic waterfront comes full circle
today when the Duke of Edinburgh sets off a series of explosions to
flood a new marina.
Queen Victoria's 17-year-old second son Prince Alfred inaugurated the
start of the harbour development when he pulled a silver handle to tip
the first load of rock for a breakwater in 1860.
Virtually the entire population of the city turned out for the event.
Ten years later, the prince -- by then Duke of Edinburgh -- returned
to name and open the newly constructed Alfred Basin. The Victoria Basin
was completed 35 years later.
The present Duke will push a plunger to set off a series of explosions
that will lead to the flooding of the yacht marina in September, the
final phase in the renovation.
The development of the waterfront started 140 years ago when a harbour
plan was drawn up to make it the Gateway to Southern Africa and 500
acres of land was reclaimed from the sea.

SINN Fein was under pressure from all sides last night to force the
IRA to scrap its arsenal.
Prime Minister John Major said republicans had not done enough to
justify a meeting with Ministers, but Sinn Fein claimed that talks could
start within ''10 to 14 days''.
US President Bill Clinton called for an end to the stockpiling of
weapons, and Irish Premier John Bruton said it was time for the
republican movement to make a ''definite offer'' on arms.
Mr Major and Mr Clinton spent 25 minutes on a ''business-like and
thorough'' telephone conversation delayed for more than a week by an
angry Mr Major.
Britain remains furious that Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was
invited to a St Patrick's Day reception at the White House and was given
permission to raise funds in the US.
Mr Major spelled out the central importance of a commitment by Sinn
Fein to serious and constructive discussion designed to lead to concrete
steps in decommissioning the IRA arsenal.
There would have to be ''substantial progress'' in decommissioning
weapons before Sinn Fein could join all-party talks on the same basis as
the constitutional parties.
Mr Major's relatively hard line appeared, however, to contrast with
the expectations of Sinn Fein, one of whose senior spokesmen, Mr Martin
McGuinness, said he was ''quite hopeful'' face to face talks could take
place in the next 10 to 14 days.
The telephone call was delayed for more than a week by the Prime
Minister in what was taken as a show of anger at the US decision to give
Mr Adams ''red carpet'' treatment at the White House.
Yesterday's conversation was seen as an attempt to heal the rift,
although Mr Major still found time to make clear to Mr Clinton British
concern over the type of US visa granted to Mr Adams, which for the
first time allowed him to raise funds for political purposes.
Mr Major confirmed that Sinn Fein had been sent an agenda setting out
the possible direction of talks, and Ministers were now awaiting its
response. But it is clear that caution is the watchword and that nothing
definite is on the table.
A Downing Street statement said: ''President Clinton acknowledged the
importance of decommissioning of weapons. The US Government had made
clear to Sinn Fein that serious discussion of decommissioning should
begin and begin soon.
''The Prime Minister expressed concern about fund-raising by Sinn Fein
and the purposes to which those funds might be put. He said there was a
long history of funds raised in the United States being used to support
the IRA's activities and that it was vital money should not be used to
restock the IRA's arsenal.
''The President said the US wanted to see strict accounting for funds
raised by Sinn Fein in the United States. The Prime Minister urged that
this should be put in place without delay.''
Downing Street said Mr Major had given a full account to Mr Clinton of
the political situation in Northern Ireland, the complexities of the
negotiations, and the state of the peace process.
In Washington, a White House official said the two men had had a
''positive and friendly'' exchange. On his way into church, Mr Clinton
gave a thumbs up sign in response to a reporter's question on how the
call had gone.
The official said Mr Clinton ''reiterated his support for Mr Major's
determination to push forward the peace process in Northern Ireland and
reaffirmed his desire to continue to play a positive role in support of
the joint efforts of the British and Irish governments.''
Mr Major is scheduled to visit the US at the beginning of next month,
when developments in Ireland are expected to form a key part of their
discussions.
Mr Bruton emphasised the neccessity of IRA and other terrorist arms
being put out of commission ahead of all-party talks on the future of
Northern Ireland.
He said everything possible should be done to help Mr Adams ''bring
his movement with him on this issue''. Mr Bruton highlighted the need
for the republican movement to ''make a clear and definite offer'' on
their weapons.
On Irish radio, Mr Bruton, who ends a week-long visit to the US
tomorrow, said: ''It is not simply from the point of view of the
military threat, but because of the feelings of the victims of the
violence of all sides, who can never rest easy, never feel that their
suffering has been recognised until the guns are put in a dump from
which they can never be retrieved.''
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein vice-president Martin McGuinness said he was
''quite hopeful'' of talks with Ministers -- a key Sinn Fein demand --
within 10 to 14 days.
''The decommissioning of all weapons is on our agenda and I think
there is considerable common ground between us on the issue,'' he said.
''Over the last few days I have been in contact with representatives
of the British Government. They have sent to us an agenda. We will be
considering that, and issuing our own agenda which we will submit to the
British Government.
''But I think we are quite close to now agreeing . . . the Sinn Fein
meeting between British Government Ministers and representatives of Sinn
Fein.''
Ulster Unionist security spokesman Ken Maginnis said: ''I do believe
that the weapons issue is on the agenda, but in such a form as to make a
mockery out of the political process. They are bringing their arms and
explosives to the conference table.
''What they are basically saying is that all arms are on a par, both
the legal weapons carried by the security forces and the illegal guns
used by the paramilitaries.''
That, he said, was unacceptable.
