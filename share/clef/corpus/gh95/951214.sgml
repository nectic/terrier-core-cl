EDINBURGH Airport has been given the go-ahead for a #4m expansion which is
expected to be completed before its busy summer season takes off.
Scottish Airports yesterday announced that domestic and international
facilities at the terminal are set to be expanded during the winter and a new
centralised security area created.
Departure lounges will be enlarged and the international duty-free shop is to
be extended, along with plans for a new bookstall and bureau-de-change.
A spokeswoman for Scottish Airports said: ``This is the first stage of the #20m
development of Edinburgh Airport's terminal facilities over the next decade.''
More than #14m has already been spent in the last four years at the airport,
which is thought to be the fastest growing within the company's group - with an
annual average passenger growth of 10%.
The increase is part of a continuing trend which saw the airport handle more
than three million passengers for the first time in 1994, and which is set to
continue in 1996, with Direct Holidays announcing it is to fly passengers from
Edinburgh to 11 new holiday destinations from next summer.

PATIENTS in Scotland are being put at risk because of delays in modernising
radio equipment in ambulances, it was claimed yesterday.
A new microwave communications system has been operating in the North of
Scotland for the past year but has not been extended to southern areas where
most of the vehicles are based.
Mr Alan Devereux, chairman of the Scottish Ambulance NHS Trust, said the old
system was no better than that used by most taxi firms.
``It is about 20 years old and would do credit to a museum,'' he said. ``It is
archaic, inadequate, and potentially very dangerous.
``We are constantly having to patch it up. If you speak to any ambulance crew
in the South of Scotland, this is far more important to them than anything
else. They are often cut off from communication with their base and each other.
``We have had some close-run things. There is no doubt about that. Lives have
not been lost, simply because we have been quick-witted enough to find ways
around problems, but it is really risky.''
Mr Andrew Freemantle, SAS chief executive, has told his staff that the old
system is in a deplorable state. ``We have been continually thwarted by an
apparent lack of understanding elsewhere of the extent of our problem,'' he
said.
Mr Devereux said a decision in principle to cover the entire country by the
same same system had been taken two years ago but this had not been implemented.
A project board on which the SAS was represented had been considering
alternative proposals.
``They have been taking a long time to convince themselves that what we
proposed two years ago is the best possible option. Finding the finance has
also held it up,'' Mr Devereux said.
He said the SAS was now awaiting tenders under a Private Finance Initiative
next month to fund the #10m scheme. Even then, however, it would still take up
to 18 months to implement.
``I am not blaming the Scottish NHS management executive but this is an example
of how slow it is in this country to get things done. It has just gone on and
on and on,'' he said.
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ``We agree that a better radio service is one
of a number of priority measures which could improve the effectiveness of the
ambulance service.
``The Northern region was identified as the priority within Scotland and this
area has been addressed. We are actively engaged in a major procurement
exercise to improve on the radio service throughout Scotland.''

THE Army is almost halving the number of serving personnel it intends to make
redundant this year.
In January, it was envisaged that 500 people at various ranks would have to be
made redundant but this has been now reduced to 280, said Armed Forces Minister
Nicholas Soames in a written reply.
He said information on the number of applications for redundancy in the Army
was not available.
A Defence Ministry spokesman said last night that the reduction had nothing to
do with the increased number of troops being sent to Bosnia.
``Compared with the 110,000 Service personnel in the Army the change is very
small fry.''
Applications for redundancy from the RAF and Royal Navy this year out-stripped
Service requirements, Mr Soames disclosed.
A total of 11,540 applied to leave the RAF in 1995 and 3800 the Royal Navy and
Royal Marines. This exceeded requirements by 2940 and 1400 respectively. There
are approximately 75,000 personnel currently serving in the RAF and 50,000 in
the Royal Navy.
During debate on the Armed Forces Bill last night, Labour spokesman Dr John
Reid said he was perturbed by reports of large-scale misuse of drugs in the
armed forces.
``I am even more perturbed by reports that the Government intends to adopt a
softer line on recruitment policy when it comes to those with previous drug
convictions.''
He said: ``Whatever the pressures created by the shortfall of personnel, we
should send no signals to indicate that drug misuse is an acceptable background
to enlistment in the armed forces.

THE Catholic Church last night praised a move by Labour to back off in the row
over anti-abortion campaigners being allowed to make their case at the party's
Scottish conference, which had soured relations with Cardinal Thomas Winning.
Relations between the party and the church hierarchy reached an all-time low
when a fringe group, Labour For Life, was denied the right to operate a stall
at conference. This provoked a breakaway move, led by Monklands East MP Helen
Liddell, by which individual MPs paid for a stall and allowed the group to
distribute their literature.
Nevertheless, the principle of the formal ban caused a rift between the party
and Cardinal Thomas Winning, who twice wrote letters of protest to Labour
leader Tony Blair. Observers read into the cardinal's pronouncements on other
issues - such as Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw on beggars - signs of his
dissatisfaction over the ban.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, who is understood to have moved the
successful motion ending the ban at the Scottish executive committee last
weekend, said yesterday: ``I am glad that the executive changed its position
and it is right that, where there is a legitimate debate going on in the party
and in Parliament, all sides should have a fair chance to express a view.''
At next year's Scottish conference, to be held in the new Edinburgh
International Conference Centre in March, Labour for Life will be allowed a
stall to put over its views. All stallholders, however, are being asked to
submit to checks in advance on their intended promotional materials to ensure
that shock tactics do not breach taste or decency.
Last night, Catholic Church spokesman Father Tom Connolly said: ``I am
absolutely delighted. For a party that has insisted for a long time that people
should have the freedom to choose, it was dreadful for them to ban debate, a
total contradiction.
``I think Cardinal Winning will be delighted, as will all freedom-loving
people.''
He cautioned against suggestions, however, that interpreted the cardinal's
subsequent speeches on social issues as being part of any split generally with
the Labour Party. ``We always speak on specific issues without aligning
ourselves with specific parties,'' he said.
The Herald understands that the decision to allow a stall - which does not
alter Labour's pro-choice policy on the abortion issue - was taken on a narrow
three-vote margin at last weekend's executive.
One senior party source called the row caused by the previous ban ``mayhem and
a serious embarrassment to the party''.

Paris
FRANCE announced today that it hoped to crown tomorrow's signing of a Bosnian
peace deal in Paris with an agreement between the main Yugoslav republics to
live together in peace, seen as the key to stability in the Balkans.
Seeking to reassure Bosnia's Muslim-led government that it had done no deals to
win the release of two captured French pilots yesterday, Paris also said
Bosnian Serb leaders wanted by a UN crimes war tribunal must face justice.
Foreign ministers from former Yugoslav republics met today to negotiate a
possible deal on mutual recognition, which could be announced in time for the
ceremonial signing of a Bosnian peace deal tomorrow.
Such a deal, long sought by European mediators, would lower tensions and help
stop the Balkans sliding back into war. It would also represent a diplomatic
coup for Paris, which has taken a back seat to the United States in peace
negotiations.
``We are working on this subject, which is very difficult, but I think that
between the main countries of the former Yugoslavia, the recognitions will be
obtained today, tomorrow, or in the future days,'' de Charette told reporters.
The talks between Yugoslav ministers also concerned possible practical measures
to reassure Serbs in Sarajevo, who fear the deal may force them from their
homes and voted overwhelmingly against it in a referendum yesterday.
European peace co-ordinator Carl Bildt told a meeting of ministers from Europe,
North America, and the Islamic world that he would send a mission to Sarajevo
in the next few days to see how Serbs can be reassured.
However a blunt response came from Richard Holbrooke, the bullish chief US
negotiator who brokered the Bosnian deal at marathon talks in Dayton, Ohio,
last month.
``The so-called referendum has no standing, no consequence, no significance.
Dayton will go ahead unchanged,'' Holbrooke told reporters in Paris after
hosting a lunch with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic.
Major powers and Islamic nations gave their backing to the peace process at
another meeting, calling on the international community to help rebuild
war-shattered Bosnia and for all parties to co-operate with the UN war crimes
tribunal.
Yesterday's release of the two French air force pilots, held by the Bosnian
Serbs since their plane was shot down three months ago, cleared the final
hurdle to the Bosnian peace deal.
Defence Minister Charles Millon said no concessions had been made for their
freedom. France had simply threatened Serbia with the reimposition of UN trade
sanctions.
Nevertheless, Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey expressed concern that
Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic might now escape indictments
from the UN tribunal.
De Charette said this should not happen.
``Should those who are to be put before the tribunal . . . appear there? My
reply is yes. It is the duty of everyone to contribute to that end,'' he told
reporters.
The peace deal will split Bosnia almost equally between Serbs and a
Muslim-Croat alliance under a loose central government. The signing will open
the way for the main body of a 60,000-strong Nato-led implementation force to
move in.
French President Jacques Chirac will host tomorrow's full-pomp signing ceremony
with 50 states and international organisations at his Elysee Palace.
Later today, 30 states, including the former Yugoslav republics and their
Balkan neighbours, discussed how to foster long-term stability in the region.
De Charette said membership of the European Union (EU) would be open to all
former Yugoslav republics over time.
Signing tomorrow's peace deal will be Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic,
Croatia's Franjo Tudjman, and Milosevic, the Serbian strongman turned
peacemaker. Prime Minister John Major, US President Bill Clinton, and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl will also attend.-Reuter.

SHARON, aged 15, is a fourth-year pupil who spoiled her attendance record with
a period of regular truancy earlier this session. She is extremely quiet and
reticent and has difficulty in rationalising her motives.
I missed the odd day in Primary 7 but there was really nothing else until well
into first year. Even then it was only a few times, and half-days at that. I
couldn't be bothered coming into school. I came in for the mornings, then just
walked about the town in the afternoon or looked in on friends. In the second
year I just took one day off, and three or four days in third year.
My big sister did a bit of dogging as well. It wasn't difficult. The teacher
didn't bother about absence notes at that time. It really got bad this year. I
must have taken 20 or 30 days off between August and October. The house was
empty, everybody was out at work.
I can't really explain it. Maybe it was because my sister left school and got a
job. That made me want to leave as well. I'll leave as soon as possible. I
would like to be a nursery nurse, but I don't think I'll do well enough for
that.
The school didn't chase me up for notes, because they knew I was dogging it
anyway. The attendance officer talked to my sister and gave her a monitoring
slip which was supposed to be filled up. Then they gave me into trouble. I was
sent to the Children's Panel and that was why I stopped dogging it. They
shouted at me.

A PLAN to strengthen the two towers of the Forth road bridge will cost more
than #5m.
A report which will be presented to the Forth Road Bridge Joint Board, meeting
in Glenrothes, Fife, next week, will recommend that the work go out to tender
at an estimated cost of #300,000.
Mr Bruce Grewar, the bridgemaster, will ask councillors to release the cash for
the project which will safeguard the bridge against a collision by a tanker.
The Babtie Group, which was appointed to consider the implications of the work,
has recommended a defensive structure for the piers.

AN event which appeared to be threatened by problems besetting the Burns
International Festival will go ahead, its organisers said last night.
International Burns Suppers, which has organised celebrations for the bard's
birthday for the last two years, will stage a third on January 25 in Glasgow.
The event has attracted major performers.
The company had hoped to team up with the festival company in the year of
commemoration of the bicentenary of Burns's death to organise the world's
biggest Burns Supper, using satellite links with countries throughout the world.
That association has not come to pass, however, and the organisers are going
ahead with a terrestrial version of the event at the Moat House Hotel which is
expected to attract more than 400 people. The Burns International Festival has
forged links instead with the event staged earlier in the month by Ayr-based
WestSound Radio which is attended by around 1000 people.
Miss Alison Thistle, a director of International Burns Suppers, said: ``We are
disappointed that the event will not be staged at the level which had been
originally planned.''
The performers next month will include actor Tony Roper and musical artists
Mary Sandeman and Capercaillie.
Meanwhile, an appeal has been launched by a local arts trust, which was refused
backing for two events in the festival year, for funds to stage a musical
version of Tam O'Shanter, written by Michael Norris.
The Strathclyde Opera Theatre Trust planned a production of Verdi's Macbeth,
which has been cancelled, but they still plan to go ahead with the musical
version of the Burns' poem.

THE Cabinet yesterday withheld support for a Tory back benchers' Bill seeking
to give Britain an extra hour of useable afternoon daylight but making dark
winter mornings longer. There will be a free Commons vote next month on the
issue.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth led the opposition to the proposal in
Cabinet. The majority of 72 Scottish MPs are against the Bill which was
presented in the Commons yesterday.
``The Government has agreed not to provide any time or assistance to this Bill
whatsoever and I will continue to use every effort I can to persuade colleagues
to have nothing to do with this legislation which I think is misguided,
unnecessary, and would be deeply damaging to Scotland,'' Mr Forsyth said.
Mr John Butterfill (Tory - Bournemouth West) has collected 11 other sponsors,
including Mr John Maxton (Labour - Glasgow Cathcart). Three other English
Tories support Mr Butterfill as do two English Liberal Democrats.
Mr Butterfill claims that the extra hour of daylight in the afternoon would
benefit the whole of the UK and that it is backed by several organisations
including the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, Age Concern, the
Police Federation, and the Suzy Lamplugh Trust.
Last night, Mr Butterfill's optimism seemed unfounded despite the fact that he
has some personal Ministerial support. The Bill may get second reading approval
but seems certain to founder in its later stages.
Mr Butterfill has offered a possible compromise - that Scotland should retain
Greenwich Mean Time while the rest of the country changes. But this is thought
unlikely to succeed.
An extra hour of daylight in the afternoon would be welcome but on previous
occasions when the proposal has been put to the test in the Commons MPs were
more concerned about schoolchildren facing an extra hour of darkness in the
mornings.
The Cabinet also agreed yesterday that the Government would support a Private
Bill by Lady Olga Maitland (Tory - Sutton and Cheam) which seeks to increase
penalties for carrying dangerous knives in public without just cause.
Home Secretary Michael Howard said yesterday that the greatest memorial that
could be provided for Mr Philip Lawrence, the London headmaster who was stabbed
to death outside his own school gates, would be to reinforce discipline and
respect for authority.
``It is only by emphasising and reinforcing those values that we can create a
climate in which crimes of this kind become much less frequent.''
The Bill would permit police to arrest anyone carrying a knife without good
reason. It would increase the maximum penalty from a #1000 fine to a six-month
jail sentence.

NEW Scottish Office research has shown that closed circuit television cameras
in town and city centres deter crime, and there is no evidence that crime is
merely displaced to areas outside the camera zones.
The research finding - based on the two years before cameras in Airdrie town
centre and the two years since - was released yesterday to coincide with the
opening of Scotland's latest CCTV scheme, in Paisley town centre.
Ironically, although the system, monitored by Strathclyde Police's Paisley
headquarters, was switched on, an armed robbery in Well Street, which took
place four hours ahead of the official opening, happened in an area not covered
by the cameras.
Scottish Home Affairs Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton yesterday gave
details of the Government's three-year challenge funding of #4m for new schemes.
A competition for the funding will be open to local partnerships which
demonstrate need and the ability to guarantee future running costs. Bids will
require to have police support and, Lord James confirmed, schemes such as those
in Paisley and Glasgow, which have received no direct government cash, will be
eligible to bid for funds to update or expand their systems.
Early research into the Glasgow city centre scheme is also understood to be
favourable. Discussions are, however, underway between the new Glasgow Council,
which will inherit the #250,000 annual running costs, and the various
participants - including major city centre traders and the Glasgow Development
Agency - about future funding.
It was confirmed to The Herald yesterday that a minority of traders have
refused to contribute although they are reaping the benefits from the increased
feeling of safety in the city centre, leading to increased sales. Other
beneficiaries of the cameras, including the new police authority and the
procurator-fiscal service, may be asked to contribute.
The main findings of the Airdrie research, carried out by Dr Jason Ditton and
Ms Emma Short, of the Scottish Centre for Criminology in Glasgow, confirm an
overall crime fall since the installation of the cameras of 21% in the town
centre, compared to the 24 months prior to their introduction.
Within that figure, crimes of dishonesty fell 48%. This included housebreaking,
shoplifting, and theft of and from vehicles, while vandalism and fire-raising
fell 19%.
The police clear-up rate improved by 16% in the 24 months after CCTV and, the
researchers found, there was no evidence to suggest that crimes were simply
displaced either to the immediately surrounding areas or to the rest of the
police sub-division.
In the rest of the police division, the researchers' control area, offences and
crimes fell by only 12%, while those in the CCTV area, in raw data terms, fell
by 35%. The fall in recorded crime throughout Strathclyde in the same period
was 7% while in Scotland as a whole crimes and offences rose 2% in the same
period.
The researchers said they had attempted to find the ``missing'' crimes and
offences by analysing crime figures and patterns in adjacent areas not covered
by CCTV.
Both of the chosen areas showed slight increases over the two years, almost
entirely accounted for by a rise in crimes of possession or supply of drugs,
and to offences committed while on bail.
These crimes respond directly to the level of police activity. Displacement
would have been suggested if there had been a corresponding decline in the CCTV
area, but this was not the case.
In accepting the #220,000 Paisley system from the town's centre management
trust, Chief Constable Sharp said the town's reputation for drugs and violence
was unjustified. Crime generally in Paisley was coming down. ``We should be
moving towards a genuine feel-good factor, so why do we need CCTV on the
streets?'' Dr Sharp asked, adding: ``Simply because crime is still too high. It
is now down to pre-1984 levels, but we can get it down even further.''
Similar drops in crime and increases in detection to those in Airdrie had been
experienced in Glasgow city centre, he said.

THE case of murdered Glasgow teenager Christina Menzies was raised in the
Commons yesterday as Labour Defence spokesman Dr John Reid claimed there were
inadequacies in the existing court-martial system in delivering justice in
homicide cases.
Speaking in the second reading debate on the Armed Forces Bill, Dr Reid said
that the 16-year-old girl - the daughter of an Army sergeant - was murdered in
Germany in 1993.
It was decided that, although the victim was a civilian, the accused person,
Lance-Corporal Darren Fisher, 23, of Reading, Berkshire, should be tried by
court-martial rather than by a German civilian court. Corporal Fisher was
acquitted.
Dr Reid said: ``There are many, including Christina's parents, the local MP (Mr
George Galloway - Hillhead) and the German authorities who feel strongly that
justice was not served by the acquittal.''
He said there were grave doubts about whether the prosecuting officer had the
necessary experience, especially since the defendant was able to hire a
specialist barrister through legal aid.
There were equally serious doubts about the handling of the forensic evidence.
He said: ``We need to seriously review the issue of courts-martial in these
circumstances and ensure that a case like that of Christina Menzies never
happens again.
``If we can achieve that, then perhaps the experience of this tragic and brutal
murder can be put to some good purpose.''
Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames, in reply, insisted that the case had
been very thoroughly investigated.
The prosecution was properly conducted, as was the trial, he said.

A CHEMICAL found in washing-up liquid has helped save a baby's life.
Laura Halpin suffered from a lung problem after she was born 12 weeks
prematurely and weighing 4lb 13oz.
Without the moisturising effect of surfactant, a chemical found in most
washing-up liquids, she would almost certainly have died.
Research by doctors, partly funded by the Glasgow branch of the charity
WellBeing, first discovered the curative effect of the chemical which is now
widely used throughout the UK and the world.
``But had Laura been born even just a few years ago, she would almost certainly
have died,'' said her mother Marion Halpin, a theatre nurse at Canniesburn
Hospital in Glasgow.
Mrs Halpin's medical history exacerbated the trauma of the emergency caesarean
operation. She had lost a child, Gary, two years ago after a premature birth.
Mrs Halpin, 26, and her husband John, 35, a dental technician, feared the worst
after Laura was born 10 months ago.
Mrs Halpin said: ``We thought the same thing would happen all over again. Laura
was on life-support machines almost from the minute she was born and it seemed
as though the day would never come when she would be able to breathe for
herself.
``Miraculously, the benefits of surfactant had just been discovered and she was
able to profit from it.''
After five weeks, the Halpins were allowed to take Laura home to Lenzie, near
Glasgow, from the Royal Maternity Hospital, Glasgow.
However, the baby was still on oxygen and needed constant care and attention.
Nevertheless, the long-term prognosis is excellent. ``She is as fit and healthy
as any other child now,'' said Mrs Halpin, `though it is a bit weird to think
of her survival being dependent on something you use to wash up dishes.
``We are just delighted that she is here with us - and are aiming to give her
the best possible Christmas she could have.''
Surfactants have been used for some time as a lubricant in commercial
washing-up liquids.
Their medical use was established around three years ago when their
moisturising effects were found beneficial, particularly on premature babies
who had not yet started to produce their own lubricants in the womb.
A spokesman for the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill said that even
three years ago the use of such chemicals was rare.
The surfactants are applied through an aerosol spray through the mouth and into
the lungs, similar to the inhalers used by asthmatics.

KNIFEMAN Stephen Wilkinson was a near-genius who set out to kill children in a
``very dramatic and notable way'', a court was told yesterday.
A jury at Leeds Crown Court heard that loner Mr Wilkinson was driven by
paranoid schizophrenia when he burst into a classroom and repeatedly plunged a
knife into three schoolgirls, killing Nikki Conroy, 12, and wounding two of her
friends.
The court heard that Mr Wilkinson, 31, who was judged by Mensa to have a
near-genius IQ of 149, could not have stopped himself and there would have been
more killings had he not been overpowered.
Psychiatrist Peter Watson-Wood said: ``He set out to kill several people in a
very dramatic and notable way, probably children.'' He said Mr Wilkinson had
developed a severe mental illness which had had a dramatic effect on his life
since his late teens, adding: ``His responsibility was impaired very
substantially. He couldn't have done anything to stop himself.''
Mr Wilkinson, of Caversham Road, Middlesbrough, took knives, a replica gun, and
a hatchet to the town's Hall Garth School on March 28 last year. After charging
masked into the classroom and ordering the teacher out at gunpoint, he made the
children kneel in a line before stabbing Nikki, Emma Winter, 12, and Michelle
Reeve, 13.
Dr Watson-Wood de-scribed Mr Wilkinson as normally a ``placid, shy, and
retiring individual'' who believed he was ``God-like'' and persecuted.
Mr Wilkinson denies murder but admits manslaughter on the grounds of diminished
responsibility. He also admits the attempted murder of the other two girls.

q MEDICAL experts say the daily dose of transport chaos and labour unrest
brought by the French public sector strikes is driving thousands
to despair.
``The images of social paralysis on the television or in the newspapers is
really distressing people,'' said Henri Grivois, head of the psychiatric unit
at the Paris Hotel-Dieu hospital. ``I tell them to listen to music instead.''
A private psychiatrist said: ``People are getting an overdose of stress. I
have
seen a rise in the number of calls from people I don't know who want to be
treated urgently for anxiety.''
The three-week action is taking its toll on health. One frustrated commuter
told the paper Le Parisien: ``Last week I just cracked - I stayed in bed for
two days, aching all over.''
Paris drugstore owners said they had seen a marked increase in the number of
people asking for sleeping tablets. One GP predicted a rush for tranquillisers
as the added pressures of Christmas shopping and festivities kick in.--Reuter.
PRESIDENT Jacques Chirac said today that there was no turning back on bitterly
disputed welfare reforms while Prime Minister Alain Juppe offered striking
unions new concessions in a bid to lure them back to work.
Ceding more ground to railwaymen and civil servants, Juppe said he could see
no
reason why the public service stoppage, already in its 20th day, should go on.
However the main unions called for a new day of action on Saturday and decided
to extend transport strikes for another 24 hours though some smaller groups
voted to return to their jobs.
``We were not elected to bring about France's decline . . . There is no
alternative,'' Chirac told the Cabinet.
``I have confidence in the government's pursuit of this policy, quite simply
because there is no other,'' he said, urging Juppe to stand firm without
shunning ``dialogue and negotiation''.
Chirac also dismissed criticism of European monetary union, saying: ``This not
a debate over Europe versus jobs. The choice is between deficits and jobs.''
The government says new taxes and health cost controls are vital to wipe out
the social security deficit and thus help France qualify for European monetary
union. Unions want the welfare proposals scuttled.
Extending a new olive branch to striking railway workers, Juppe said talks on
reform of the debt-ridden SNCF state railways could start from scratch, as the
rail unions have demanded.
Juppe also told Parliament he would personally chair a December 21 conference
with unions and employers on jobs, a task he had previously assigned to Labour
Minister Jacques Barrot.
In a bow to civil servants, the deputy head of Juppe's office, Pierre-Mathieu
Duhamel, gave unions a written pledge that there would be no change in state
employees' retirement age or in the way their pensions are calculated - a
pledge that Juppe had granted earlier to train and Paris Metro drivers.
It effectively retracted Juppe's statement to Parliament last month that he
wanted civil servants to work 40 years instead of 37!s for a full pension,
bringing them in line with the private sector.
``There is no longer any reason for the strike,'' Juppe told a Cabinet
meeting,
adding that the situation was being politicised.
However a key union chief denied the strikes were meant to topple Juppe.
``I have not heard a single union leader demand the Prime Minister's head,''
said Louis Viannet, head of the giant Communist CGT union, told France Inter
radio. ``The problem is his policies.''-Reuter.

A MAN serving life for raping a student was yesterday acquitted of a similar
charge.
The jurors were unware that William Stevenson, 28, had previous convictions.
He was on bail accused of attempting to rape a 23-year-old woman in Airdrie
when he attacked the student, aged 22, in Eastbourne, Sussex.
He claimed the student had been a willing partner and he made the same claim
this week when he denied attacking the woman in Airdrie.
Yesterday, a jury at the High Court in Glasgow found a charge against Stevenson
of attempting to rape the woman in Airdrie not proven by a majority after a
three-day trial.
The woman claimed Stevenson attacked her in her bedroom in 1993 after her
father invited him to spend the night on a couch.
Stevenson, originally from Possilpark, Glasgow, claimed the woman invited him
into her bedroom after her father left for work in the morning.
Stevenson was jailed for life at Lewes Crown Court in September for raping the
student after the court heard he had convictions for indecency, theft, and
fraud.

producers of trying to block a report on global warming, which warns of
disastrous consequences if greenhouse gases are not cut. Delegates to a
UN-sponsored panel on climate change say Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are using
delaying tactics because their oil interests would be hit if the use of fossil

SCOTS holidaymakers will lose out on Christmas breaks after a travel company
ceased trading last night.
Bradley and Vaughan of Turnpike Parade, London, who traded as B and V Travel
and B and V Travel and Holidays, specialised in travel to the Canary Islands.
The company had arranged a Christmas programme flying from Glasgow to Las
Palmas and from Manchester and Gatwick to Tenerife.
The Civil Aviation Authority said passengers holding scheduled flight-only
tickets would still be able to travel. Others on fly-drive options or packages
would not.
The CAA is arranging for refunds for all those unable to travel, including
those booked on Oasis International and Air 2000 to the Canaries.
A CAA spokeswoman said: ``Passengers should contact us or their local travel
agent in Glasgow.''
The company, which was not a member of the Association of British Travel
Agents, has had its air travel organiser's licence bond of #63,510 called in.
The bond enables compensation to be paid or to pay for return flights for
stranded passengers.
Up until March this year, 125,000 people received refunds from the CAA after
travel company failures and a further 11,500 were brought home at a cost of
#16m.

THE jury who will today decide the fate of a police officer were told yesterday
they might be tempted to think the facts they had heard outlined were from the
realms of fantasy.
Advocate-depute Alan Turnbull told the jury at the High Court in Aberdeen that
it was the type of thing one read about in books, or saw in the cinema or on
television.
It was a temptation to turn a blind eye to the indictment against Grampian
constable Neil Cooper, in the hope it could not be right, but he asked them to
convict him.
He said Mr Cooper, who faces two charges of attempting to defeat the ends of
justice and one of corruptly accepting #6000 and other payments in return for
providing confidential information to a man now serving 15 years for drugs
offences, had betrayed the trust of his colleagues.
``The allegations in this trial are of such a serious nature, such a disturbing
nature, that it is tempting to draw a veil over it,'' he told the jury.
``The relationship between police officers and the rest of society is one that
is at the very heart of the way we conduct our lives. The relationship between
the police and society is what distinguishes our society from a totalitarian
one.''
The two main Crown witnesses have been Ronald Cormack, the drugs dealer, and
his associate, Ian ``Fat Billy'' Smith, who, it has been heard, was a police
informant and friend of both Cormack and Mr Cooper.
Mr Turnbull said Mr Cooper had become ``infected'' by Smith and had been
prepared to take advantage of the trust which existed between him and his
colleagues for the benefit of Smith and Cormack.
He said that if Mr Cooper had acted properly when investigating an offence in
which a firearm was carried involving Smith and Cormack in 1991, Cormack's
drugs career would have been prevented because he would have been in jail.
``By 1993, Cooper is totally corrupted by Smith,'' he said. ``I don't know how
he gets that power but it is obvious he has got influence over Cooper.''
He said that if Mr Cooper was guilty he had always hoped no-one would believe
what Cormack and Smith said and that no-one would take their word against his.
``If he is guilty, he always intended to cynically take advantage of the trust
and confidence which existed in his office,'' Mr Turnbull said.
Mr Kevin Drummond QC, defending, told the jury that Cormack and Smith had lied
in the witness box.
He accused Cormack of being an evil liar whose evidence could not be
corroborated.
``This is a big game for Ronald Cormack,'' he said. ``He is living in a Walter
Mitty fantasy world in which he thinks he can say anything about anyone.
``Ronald Cormack is a paranoid liar. His allegations, under careful scrutiny,
do not stand up.''
He told the jury they were about to make the biggest decision in Mr Cooper's
life and that they had been given a glimpse into the murky world of organised
crime and drug dealing.
``This is a criminal trial in which there is a person on the most grave
charges,'' he said.
He called on the jury to find Mr Cooper not guilty, saying there was not a
shred of evidence to link him with Cormack.
Lord Macfadyen will address the jury this morning.

A SALES drive for Porsche high-performance cars, which ended when three people
died, was criticised by a coroner yesterday after an inquest jury returned
verdicts of unlawful killing on two of the victims.
Renault 5 driver Karen Dalley, 22, and Devon businessman Derek Redfern, 57, who
was a passenger in a Porsche 911, died when the cars collided near the village
of Llyswen, Powys. A verdict of accidental death was returned on the Porsche
driver, car salesman Gavin Shaw, 30, of Cardiff.
The cars collided near the Llangoed Hall Hotel, which was being used by Cardiff
car dealers Merlin (Cambria) Ltd as a base for a sales promotion on June 11
this year.
The cars disintegrated and burst into flames after colliding at a closing speed
estimated by police at 150mph.
Deputy Powys coroner Geraint Williams said after the verdicts had been read at
the Brecon inquest: ``I have no comment about Mr Shaw's driving that day. It is
clear to me from evidence that, in the Llyswen area, Porsches were being driven
at astronomically high speeds.
``A number of people were driving recklessly or dangerously. I am exceedingly
surprised that there were not more accidents and I'm relieved that only three
people died.''
Ms Hilary Sykes, company secretary of Merlin (Cambria), said after the hearing
that the company found ``some difficulty with some of the comments''.
Dyfed-Powys police said later traffic patrols were unaware of the Porsche
demonstration in the area.

BRAIDHURST High, which serves the North Motherwell area, is one of only seven
Strathclyde secondary schools to which the region has awarded a Band 1 rating
this year for attendance, writes DICK LOUDEN.
Strathclyde operates a system of seven bands under which it predicts the
absence rate for each school. Band 1, which indicates a ``commendably low
absence figure'', seems an unlikely achievement for Braidhurst High, whose
catchment area encompasses a great deal of deprivation.
Its absence rate of 13.1% may not seem minuscule but, when compared to a
predicted rate of 18.9%, it clearly stands out. And it is only one area in
which the school has succeeded against the odds.
Head teacher Derrick Hannan attributes much of the improvement to management
style.  He adopts a high personal profile and encourages an entrepreneurial
approach which has led to the setting up of a partnership base where there is
an emphasis on working with parents - and getting them involved in their
children's education.
He speaks of the ``astonishingly high work rate of staff at all levels,
including non-teaching staff''. For example, last year Braidhurst won an award
for the cleanest of 600 schools inspected and since then it has continued to
look extremely well-kept.
The senior management team promote a participative style, with teachers serving
on a range of staff committees and feeling they can make suggestions which will
be acted upon.
Hannan describes his school as ``in some ways traditional and old-fashioned''.
Exams for all year groups have been reintroduced, uniform is encouraged, there
are regular assemblies and two prize-giving ceremonies per year, recognising
not only acacademic achievement - but also regular attendance.
These are all factors which can influence and encourage attendance, but what
specific system does is operated to reduce absence? Extra time is provided for
guidance staff and Braidhurst's principal teacher of guidance, John Campbell,
uses print-outs of attendance to discuss individual cases with the four
assistant principal teachers.
The action to be taken is then identified - this can be a letter to parents,
counselling for the pupil, the issue of a monitoring card, or bringing in a
parent. Alternatively, it can involve a role for either the school's attendance
officer, Bill Shaw, or the partnership officer, Janine Barbour.
Shaw reports to the school on a daily basis for cases to pursue, while Barbour
sometimes works with chronic truants, for whom the solution may be a partial
subject timetable supplemented by group activities, leading to phased
resumption of a full timetable. Hannan sees a ``definite correlation'' between
regularity of attendance and results in the SCE examinations. The tone is set
in first year, when parents are informed of targets (academic and otherwise)
which are set for all pupils.
``We have very few youngsters who are not presented for everything,'' says
Hannan. ``An enormously high percentage of candidates actually turn up and,
when they don't, we have been known to knock on their doors and get them out of
their beds.''

AN eight-year-old Paisley boy has died from flu in what has been described as a
``tragic but rare'' case, it was confirmed last night.
The death of Stephen McKenzie, of Broomlands Street, has mystified doctors
because he had been in good health. Flu deaths usually occur among elderly
people with medical complications.
Stephen contracted flu along with his five-year-old sister Lyndsay last week.
His condition did not appear serious when he went to bed on Friday evening but
his parents found him slumped at the top of the stairs on Saturday morning. He
was confirmed dead on arrival at Royal Alexandra Hospital.
A post-mortem examination on Tuesday confirmed that the cause of death was flu.
Argyll and Clyde Health Board released news of the tragedy last night, urging
parents not to panic.
Three children have died from flu since 1990, two aged under five and one aged
between five and 10. A total of 321 deaths were registered during that period,
mostly elderly people with medical complications.
The boy's parents, Thomas, a production worker, and Jacqueline, a domestic at
the Royal Alexandra, said he had been ill for a couple of days before he died.
They suspected he was suffering from flu. They were said to be stunned by their
son's death.
The couple's daughter has now recovered and is said to be back at St Mary's
Primary School, Maxwellton Road. Both children are reported to have been
prescribed penicillin.
Dr David Sloan, consultant in public health medicine, stressed that fellow
pupils and other children were not at risk from any virulent strain of flu.
He said: ``This exceptional and tragic case could give the public the wrong
idea about the current upsurge in flu.
``The annual influenza epidemic has been of moderate severity and next week
should
Continued on Page 2
Continued from Page 1
see us over the worst of it. The severity of illnesses it causes are no worse
than usual for influenza A.''
He said one of the tragedy's surrounding Stephen's death was that he had
appeared to be healthy. He added: ``We are not sure why it was so severe in
this young boy. Certain individuals are struck down like this and it is
difficult to say why they are susceptible.''
Dr Sloan said high-risk categories included children suffering from conditions
such as chronic lung, heart, and kidney disease, diabetes, and those with
depresed immune systems caused by diseases such as leukaemia or treatments such
as radiotherapy.
Dr Sloan said children in those categories should be immunised every year but
routine jabs for fit children and adults were not recommended.
He said there should not be any rush to immunise children.
He added: ``There is very little risk to ordinary children of serious illness
from influenza and we will soon be past the worst of this year's outbreak.
``Parents should also remember that it takes at least two weeks for the vaccine
to give protection. It is not recommended for children under six months or
older children who have not had the vaccine before. A second dose is needed
four to six weeks later to give adequate protection.
``Most children bounce back from flu but if they are severely affected, parents
should seek medical advice.''
A report will be sent to the procurator-fiscal who may decide to hold a fatal
accident inquiry. There are no suspicious circumstances. It is understood the
funeral will be held tomorrow.

Darwin
A COURT in Australia ruled today that it was unable to determine officially the
cause of death of baby Azaria Chamberlain, who disappeared 15 years ago in one
of the country's most baffling mysteries.
Coroner John Lowndes ruled there was not enough evidence to say either a dingo
took the baby, as claimed by the parents, or that her mother, Lindy
Chamberlain, was involved.
``The only finding I can record is an open one,'' Lowndes told an inquest in
Darwin.
Lindy Chamberlain was convicted of Azaria's murder in 1982 but later acquitted.
Her husband Michael was found guilty of being an accessory and was also
acquitted.
Today's finding, ending a series of inquests, trials, appeals, and special
inquiries, means the case remains unsolved.
The court had been asked to find that a dingo, Australia's native wild dog,
snatched the nine-week-old baby from their tent at Ayers Rock, now known by its
Aboriginal name, Uluru, in 1980.
The parents had also asked to be officially cleared of any involvement in
Azaria's disappearance.
Azaria's body has never been found. Only her bloodstained baby jacket was
recovered.-Reuter.

A POLICE officer was in intensive care last night after being stabbed as he
attended a domestic dispute which ended in a knife-point siege.
Constable Peter Walsh, 35, needed surgery and a 10-pint blood transfusion after
the stabbing at the home of a warring couple in Ousten, near Chester-le-Street,
County Durham, a police spokesman said.
Another officer was slashed across the face with a long-bladed Bowie knife by
the man, in his 20s, who later held his common-law wife and two-year-old
daughter at knife-point for three hours.
After the stabbing at 2am, armed police surrounded the couple's council home
until the man, who had threatened to kill any officer who came near him, was
finally arrested in his back garden. The second officer, who has not been
named, was taken with Mr Walsh to Dryburn hospital, Durham, but was allowed
home after treatment.
Mr Walsh, who is married with two children and has twice been commended for
bravery in his nine-year career with Durham police, was ``stable and
comfortable'', a hospital spokesman said.
q Doctors yesterday called for talks with the Government and police officers in
the light of the stabbing of London GP Anthony Inwald.
GP leaders have told the Department of Health that special secure surgery
premises may be needed for persistently violent patients.
Dr Judy Gilley, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs'
Committee, said: ``We have been very worried about the increasing incidence of
abuse and violence against GPs for some time and wrote to the Department of
Health only last week seeking discussions on this issue.''
She said a national survey last year revealed that one in four inner-city GPs
had been physically assaulted in their surgery. A total of 83% said they had
been verbally abused.
A 29-year-old woman was remanded in custody for a week when she appeared in
court charged over the stabbing of Dr Inwald. Ms Maria Caseiro, of Kystalls
Hotel, Holloway, north London, was charged with causing grievous bodily harm
following the stabbing at St John's Way medical centre.
q A 44-year-old soldier was fighting for his life after being stabbed in a
frenzied knife attack as he walked through a seaside resort with his wife.
The couple had just left a function in a hotel at Portrush on Northern
Ireland's County Antrim coast in the early hours when the knifeman struck.
He plunged a knife repeatedly into the soldier's chest and stomach before
running off.
The victim, a member of the Royal Irish Regiment, is understood to live in the
town and was named locally as David Reid. He was taken to Coleraine Hospital a
few miles away for emergency overnight surgery.
q A 15-year-old boy yesterday was sentenced to four years' detention for
stabbing a man to death with a penknife. The youngster - who cannot be named
for legal reasons - wept throughout the hearing at Liverpool Crown Court.
The court was told the youngster got into a fight with 25-year-old Paul Jeory
near his home in Blackburn, Lancashire, on March 10, 1995, three days after his
15th birthday.
Witnesses told police that Mr Jeory had accused the defendant's brother of
being a police informer and had then head-butted the boy in the fracas in
Mosley Street, Blackburn.
The boy then stabbed Mr Jeory in the chest with a small pocket knife.

MENTION the word Christmas and you think parties, presents, and putting ``Must
Lose Weight'' at the end of it all. It is a time of celebration in the midst of
winter, but the laws of physics still apply, writes Dr Christine Fenn.
Calories IN must balance Calories OUT, otherwise the surplus is stored in the
fat cells around your thighs and hips ......just in case you ever go short of
food in the future.
Not surprisingly, many of us tip the balance and increase our fat stores. This
is because, although our stress levels go through the roof, our calorie needs
go down.
Unfortunately, writing Christmas cards, licking the stamps, making paper
chains, agonising over what size tree to buy and cringing at the thought of
coping with relatives, do not use many calories.
No wonder that we turn to food for comfort - and there is plenty of temptation.
The endless number of office parties, Christmas lunches, and selection boxes
can mean a serious increase in eating. At the end of it all, you have literally
had enough.
You never want to see another mince pie or lump of cheese on a cocktail stick;
yet again the words ``Go On A Diet'' appear at the top of your list of New Year
resolutions. Never fear: help is at hand, and prevention is better than cure.
Most of the calories come from the fat in foods. The trick is to avoid the fat
before it ever gets near your plate, let alone your hips. Turkey is an
excellent low fat meat, and by knowing where the fat is lurking, it is possible
to eat fabulous festive meals which add to the enjoyment, not the calories.
The average man on Christmas day (who spends the day eating and drinking,
opening presents, and boiling over with stress while coping with the family),
needs 2550 calories, with only 100 grams of fat.
The average woman (who buys the presents, cooks the meal and mends the fairy
lights), will need 1900 calories and 74 grams of fat.

AN eminent Scottish theologian will try next month to have sex-related assault
charges against him thrown out of court.
A hearing will be held to establish whether or not Professor Donald Macleod,
55, of Craiglea Drive, Edinburgh, can have a fair trial.
Professor Macleod, who holds the chair of systematic theology at the Free
Church of Scotland College in Edinburgh, faces six charges alleging sexual
assault involving five women. The charges date from July 1985 to June 1992.
His lawyer will argue next month that none of the six charges should go to
trial.
Professor Macleod is alleged to have assaulted four of the women by putting his
arms around them and kissing them or attempting to kiss them. Two charges
relate to one woman during 1986 in which he is alleged to have interfered with
her clothing and handled her breasts and private parts.
Four of the assaults are alleged to have taken place at the Free Church college

THE 7.5% cut in the budget of Scottish Enterprise was a deal done over dinner
in a London hotel, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth disclosed yesterday.
He told the Commons Select Committee on Scottish Affairs that he met Scottish
Enterprise chairman Donald MacKay and chief executive Crawford Beveridge for
dinner ``and in the course of that dinner the question of the budget did
arise.''
The dinner took place at the Royal Horseguards Hotel, just off Whitehall, on
November 15, and Mr Forsyth yesterday gave some details of the conversation
which led to a reduction of #33m in the Scottish Enterprise budget.
Referring to Mr MacKay, the Secretary of State told the committee: ``He
indicated that if the reduction was more than 7.5% he could not maintain all
the outputs we place importance on. I had in mind to cut by 10%, but I was
persuaded because he was prepared to take a sensible approach and maintain all
the services. That was the right decision to take on behalf of Scottish
Enterprise.''
The SNP's Andrew Welsh demanded to know whether Mr MacKay had volunteered the
cuts.
Mr Forsyth said: ``He recognised that this was a tight public spending round
and he knew there would have to be reductions in his budget. He looked at ways
of meeting the obligations of Scottish Enterprise and decided he could meet all
of these with a reduction of 7.5%.
``Those people who have criticised him are deeply misguided. We should have
people running these bodies who are looking for the best value for money. The
way he (Mr MacKay) went into this is an example for others to follow.''
Mr Forsyth produced an aggressive performance at his annual grilling by the
committee, at which he is challenged by MPs on his public expenditure plans.
He clashed with a number of committee members on the constitutional issue after
pointing out that he had secured a deal giving Scotland 35% per head more money
than England and Wales.
The Secretary of State told the committee he had had a difficult time
justifying his budget, and warned what the difference would be under a devolved
Scottish parliament.
He said there were people in the Treasury who wanted Scotland's funding to be
calculated on a ``needs based'' evaluation, and once again warned about the
tartan tax, stating that ``the present arrangements serve us rather well, and
we would be getting into dangerous waters indeed if we opened that up to
scrutiny.''
In direct clashes with the committee chairman, Kilmarnock and Loudoun Labour MP
Willie McKelvey, Mr Foryth took a robust line.
Mr McKelvey: ``I don't want to get bogged down on this issue.''
Mr Forsyth: ``I think you are pretty well bogged down on it, Mr Chairman.''

SERIOUS doubts have been raised about the true levels of unauthorised, or
unexplained, absence in Scottish secondary schools.
Attendance and absence tables published yesterday by the Scottish Office showed
that schools with the highest unauthorised absence rates, most commonly
truancy, in 1993-94 had dramatically reduced their figures this year.
But their authorised absence rates, which are explained and do not attract the
same adverse publicity, had increased by almost the same amount.
The one school which most vigorously recorded unauthorised absence paid the
price by having the highest rate.
It rose from 0% to 16% at Linlathen High, Dundee. The school's deputy rector,
Mr Iain Duncan, said: ``We have played it by the book and perhaps we have
suffered because of that. We are in the limelight for the worst possible
reason.''
Scottish Office officials said they had no evidence that the figures were being
juggled. Mr Archie McGlynn, director of inspectors of schools' audit unit, said
such action would not be sensible.
``Schools have produced the figures. They have to believe in them and defend
them,'' he said. There is growing disquiet, however, that schools are
interpreting Scottish Office guidelines on authorised and unauthorised absence
to put the best gloss on their non-attendance figures.
Scottish Office Minister for Education Raymond Robertson said he wanted to know
why there were big discrepancies in attendance and absence rates across
Scotland.
According to the figures, absence in the primary sector was an average of 5% -
equivalent to each pupil being absent for ten and a half days in the school
year - while in secondaries it was 12%, equivalent to 22 days.
Unauthorised attendance in the secondary sector averaged 1%.
The report gives for the first time information about the number of pupils
excluded from school. The authorities which educate the majority of Scottish
pupils do not have a policy of permanent exclusions but of those which do,
Lothian had the highest number, 83 from its secondary schools.
Pupils in Glasgow secondaries lost the most half days because of temporary
exclusions, nearly 35,000 between January and June.

MARTIN, aged 14, is a third-year pupil who can be classed as a ``casual
truant''. He is a pleasant, soft-spoken boy who does not regard school as a
hostile environment.
I always attended well when I was at primary school. I started dogging it
halfway through first year. It wasn't something I planned - it was just that
some of my pals were doing it and they asked me to join in. One of them did it
nearly every day.
There were other times when I didn't go in because I had forgotten to do my
homework or a punishment exercise. I knew the punishment would be doubled if I
showed up. Once this year, I dogged it three times in a row. It was just that
sometimes, when I got up, I didn't feel like going in.
A few times my big sister wrote a note for me. I got found out because my wee
brother started dogging it too. The school got on to my mum. She was supposed
to see the attendance officer but she made a mistake about the day and she got
a letter instead. She blamed me for getting my brother into trouble, though he
wasn't dogging with me.
I stopped it a couple of weeks ago and I won't go back to it. I want to be a
joiner or engineer - that's why I'm taking craft and design and graphics - and
I'm doing all right, pretty average. I know I've got to attend to get a good
job. It was Wednesdays that I used to dog most. That was the worst day - RE and
modern studies and maths and all that stuff.

<HEADLINE>Threat to EU funding from `real' cuts Fishermen fear result of new budget</HEADLINE>

FEARS that this week's public spending announcement masked deep cuts in support
for the fishing industry will be raised at a meeting today between
representatives of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and the Government.
While the Minister involved, Mr Raymond Robertson, is being questioned about an
apparent lack of support leading to the loss of European aid to which the
industry is entitled, the SNP will be tabling a series of questions in the
House of Commons aimed at prising out information which was lacking during the
announcements of the Scottish Office spending round on Monday.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth made virtually no mention of agriculture and
fisheries spending during his budget announcement to the Scottish Grand
Committee on Monday. The only reference was to spending on agriculture,
fisheries, and food being part of the UK announcement issue on Budget day on
November 28.
That intimation, which even leaders of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation did
not receive at the time, concentrated heavily on increases in UK spending on
the Common Agriculture Policy and domestic spending on farming. It did say that
#12m per year had been earmarked for the decommissioning of vessels over the
next two years.
But it added that: ``It has been decided that the EU grant schemes for
fisheries processing and marketing, port facilities, and aquaculture production
under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance will not be launched in
England.''
It added that the national harbour grant scheme was ending immediately and said
that next year only #500,000 of grants would be available under the European
PESCA scheme, which aids hard-hit fishing communities.
Mr Bob Allan, chief executive of the SFF, had to ask the Government yesterday
for a copy of the November statement, and he said it was unclear just how it
related to spending north of the Border - something he would be pressing Mr
Robertson on today.
SNP leader Alex Salmond, whose Banff and Buchan constituency is the heartland
of the fishing industry, sensed earlier this week that the trend of public
spending was away from fishing in the direction of support for spending on the
Common Agricultural Policy, and he has tabled a series of Commons questions
about the level of structural support for fisheries past and present.
He said last night: ``With 14% of the European fishing fleet, the UK receives
only 2% of EU funding. Something is afoot here. It is just a question of how
far it affects Scotland.
``Obviously, given the rumours that are spreading about further cutbacks in
structural assistance, there is the danger that Scotland's fishing industry
will yet again be blocked from financial assistance from Europe as a result of
Westminster's intransigent policy.''
He said this had already happened with aid for fleet decommissioning and
upgrading, and there was now a serious problem with participating in the PESCA
scheme because the Government was insisting that cash-strapped local
authorities, rather than the Scottish Office, provided the matching funding
without which European money is frozen.
``I want clear answers to the questions I have tabled so that we can assess
whether, yet again, Whitehall will be setting an empty place for Scotland at
the European table,'' he said.
Mr Allan said it was far from clear what the current spending round implied for
the fishing industry, and he would be putting some hard questions to the
Minister today.
``Until we hear what they have to say I am keeping my powder dry,'' he said.
``I would be very, very concerned if an already bad situation was made any
worse.''
q Tory Euro-rebels are planning to mount a challenge to the Government in the
Commons next week over the ``appalling deal'' struck over the Common Fisheries
Policy.
This could mean another cliffhanger for the Government, with the Conservative
majority now reduced to five.
Mr Tony Marlow, MP for Northampton North, said that he and others who lost the
Tory whip and then regained it, would be tabling an amendment for a debate,
probably to be held on Tuesday.
This will call for the ``re-establishing of control over our own waters'' to be
a manifesto commitment at the next General Election.
Labour said last night that it would be tabling its own amendment in a bid to
inflict another embarrassing defeat on the Government over Europe.

Q. I try to keep myself fit, so I go out and do a spot of jogging several times
a week. But I have noticed that on longer runs a very odd thing happens. The
skin of my chest begins to get very sore as it rubs against my rugby shirt, and
then my nipples become awfully sensitive and eventually start to bleed. I'm not
turning into a woman or something, am I?
A. Definitely not! You're simply suffering from the famous condition of
``jogger's nipple''. This is caused by constant friction on the areola, which
is the disc around the nipple. In the days when I used to run half-marathons, I
often finished up with two rather embarrassing red circles on my singlet - due
to bleeding.
The remedy is to put lashings of Vaseline on the nipple area before you go out
jogging. Alternatively, use two strategically positioned pieces of sticking
plaster.
Q. To settle an argument with my wife, is alcohol good for a man's heart, or
not?
A. Recent research suggests one or two glasses of red wine per day may (and I
stress the word ``may'') help protect both men and women against heart
diseases. Despite what the Government claims, the case is very much ``not
proven'' at the moment. But it could be one reason why the French are much less
likely to get coronaries than the British is the fact so many of them like a
couple of glasses of vin rouge on a daily basis.
However, it's important to realise there's no convincing evidence as yet that
the findings about red wine can be extrapolated to cover other kinds of
alcohol, like whisky or pints of heavy! Furthermore, please bear in mind
there's no doubt regular high levels of alcohol intake (as opposed to a couple
of glasses a day) are strongly associated with chronic illness and a short
life.
Q. A man who had had an affair with a highland woman wrote to you a couple of
weeks ago, and you advised him he stood very little chance of catching HIV from
her. I think this is most irresponsible advice! We should all be aware of the
fact heterosexual fornication can and does lead to Aids.
A. It can indeed, sir, but let's look at the statistics. In all the years since
Aids began, how many Scottish males do you think have contracted HIV through
``straight'' (ie heterosexual) intercourse? The answer is just 163. That's
right: 163. While these are tragic occurrences, they are mercifully rare ones.
Furthermore, over half of those exposures (86) took place abroad - the great
majority of them being in Africa.
So while we all need to be vigilant about Aids, the truth is that the risk from
``straight'' sex in rural Scotland is still pretty low. The highest HIV rate is
in the Lothian Health Board area, where there are 102 known cases per hundred
thousand people.
Tayside comes second with 59 per 100,000, while Greater Glasgow is a long way
back at 34/100,000 and Grampian far behind that at 13/100,000. In the rest of
the country, the incidence is still minute, at about nine per 100,000.
Q. I passed black motions this morning and it gave me quite a scare. But I've
heard this can just be due to drinking wine. Is that so?
A. All adults should be on the look-out for black motions, because the symptom
often indicates internal bleeding. However, black stools can also be caused by
drinking red wine (not any other kind of plonk) and by taking iron tablets. So
if you had some claret or red Burgundy or whatever the night before this
episode, you have nothing to worry about. If you didn't, consult your doctor
immediately.

<HEADLINE>Plea to end armed forces ban on homosexuals</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974897184</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Commons last night heard a plea for a lifting of the ban on homosexuals
serving in the armed forces.
Mr Alan Howarth (Stratford-on-Avon), who caused political controversy when he
defected from Tory to Labour on the eve of the Conservative conference in
October, insisted that sexuality should have no bearing on people's eligibility
to serve their country - a view which has been contested by Service chiefs.
His plea came as Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames opened the second
reading debate on the Armed Forces Bill, which is introduced every five years
to renew the forces' discipline Acts.
Mr Howarth challenged the Minister: ``Will you accept that homosexuals are just
as likely as anybody else to be highly competent and professional members of
the armed services and that their sexuality should have no bearing on their
eligibility to serve their country, and will you legislate to that effect?''
Labour's Harry Cohen (Leyton) attacked the ban and told the House that the MoD
review on homosexuality in the forces ``has already been seriously compromised
and has already come dangerously close to being an exercise to encourage
hostility toward existing serving homosexuals''.
Mr Soames insisted that the views of the MoD and senior military officers ``are
not in any sense homophobic or judgmental.
``They are to do with military discipline and good order and the immensely
strong and truly genuinely-held feelings of thousands of people in the armed
forces.''
On measures contained in the Bill, Mr Soames told the House it would:
q.Introduce reforms to the procedures of courts-martial.
q. Extend the time limit allowed to service personnel to take cases to
industrial tribunals.
q.Allow flexibility in dealing with ``those whom it would be preferable to
retain'' but who refused to take part in drugs tests.
THE Army is almost halving the number of serving personnel it intends to make
redundant this year.
In January, it was envisaged that 500 people at various ranks would have to be
made redundant but this has been now reduced to 280, Mr Soames said.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday told Lothian Regional Council
there must be a tightening of policies to safeguard the green belt from
unnecessary development.
He was commenting on changes he was proposing to the region's Structure Plan,
intended to guide development in the area to the year 2005.
Mr Forsyth said his proposed modifications did not alter the main thrust of the
plan, which had been submitted to him earlier this year.
A Scottish Office report recommended an Edinburgh green belt study was required
to confirm boundary lines.
The report added that where land was required to implement any changes, there
had to be obligations placed on potential developers.

<HEADLINE>Grandparents say gypsy child is not missing Ben</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>974897186</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE grandparents of missing Ben Needham last night told officials that a child
found with gypsies in Greece was definitely not their grandson.
Chris and Eddie Needham watched video footage of the six-year-old boy, taken
into custody by police from a gypsy camp, in the hope of recognising Ben who
vanished four-and-a-half years ago.
However, they were in no doubt their search was not yet over. ``It obviously
wasn't him,'' said Mr Needham. ``He was dark skinned and dark eyed and so
obviously not English.''
Greek police last night issued a statement saying they were now sure the child,
who was first discovered by a private detective in the northern town of Veroia,
was not ``Baby Ben'' who, at two years old, went missing while playing on a
beach a few yards from his grandparents' holiday house on the island of Kos.
The boy, who had been the focus of enormous media attention since he apparently
told investigator Stratos Bakirtziz that he had been given to the gypsies
because his parents did not want him, would now be released to return home, a
spokesman said.
Mr Needham, 47, who has never given up hope that blond, blue-eyed Ben will be
found, said: ``I never felt that this kid was him. But you never know what
might happen.''
The couple, who are staying on the holiday island of Kos, were about to speak
to Ben's mother, Kerry, who was waiting for news at her home in Foxhill,
Sheffield.
``I hope she will be OK,'' said Mr Needham. ``She's never come to terms with
it. That's why she could not come out to Greece.''
The family would go on searching until Ben was found, he said. ``You never get
used to it but after four-and-a-half years the disappointments get easier.''
There have been numerous false sightings of Ben, including other reports that
he has been seen with gypsies in northern Greece. Two months ago, the Needhams
travelled to Salonika when a headmaster thought a boy in his school answered
Ben's description.
Mr Stratos Vakirtziz, who had said he was 100% sure he had got the right boy
and was claiming the #30,000 reward for finding Ben, told reporters the police
had the wrong one.
``This child is not the one I saw. The gypsies must have hidden him and brought
this boy forward,'' he said.
Police chief Ioannis Panousis dismissed the claims. A birth certificate
provided by the boy's family was authentic and the child's father, now in a
Greek prison, confirmed he had left his son with them.
Greek police were always sceptical that the child, who did not have Ben's blue
eyes or distinctive birth mark, could be the one they sought. ``We went by the
book on this one because it attracted so much international attention.
Otherwise, we would have closed the case much earlier,'' a spokesman said.

A MAN is to sue police after claiming that he was injured by a new style of
handcuff.
Paul Thomson, 25, of Dougrie Drive, Castle-milk, Glasgow, claims that as a
result of being clamped in the new rigid quick cuffs he was treated in hospital
for damage to a nerve and muscle in an arm and bone damage to an elbow.
His solicitor, Mr Alan Miller, told Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday that
Thomson was taken to Aitkenhead Road police station in agony because of the
cuffs. He said that when Thomson complained his fingers were turning blue, an
arm was forced behind his back, resulting in his having to go to hospital next
day.
Thomson admitted being in possession of a pepper spray which he had bought in
America.
Sheriff J M Smith admonished Thomson and ordered forfeiture of the spray.
q A prisoner, who tried to bite off a pair of uncomfortable handcuffs, appeared
in court in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, yesterday, accused of damaging them
with his teeth. Michael Lippet, 18, was conditionally discharged for a year and
ordered to pay #16 compensation for the damaged cuffs.

HEALTH Boards were told yesterday how much they would get from the #2800m being
made available for next year's hospital and community health services budget.
Although Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said this was a
record level of funding - it represents an increase on paper of 3.11% - it will
leave hospitals with less to spend in real terms.
Official sources have acknowledged that the overall NHS budget for Scotland,
#4200m, represents an increase in real terms of 0.2%.
However, this growth is taken up largely by the primary care budget - the other
main arm of the service.
This leaves the hospital and community health services to find their required
efficiency savings target of 3%, or #83m.
The overall cash increase, 6.11%, would enable health boards and NHS trusts to
meet the costs of pay and price increases, demography, and medical advance.
All efficiency savings - including #18m expected to result from management
costs - were to be reinvested in the service for the benefit of patient care.
Lord James said: ``The additional funds will enable an increase in acute
inpatient and day case activity of around 5%, which equates to about 53,000
cases. It will also enable the service to meet Patient Charter commitments,
reduce waiting times and make progress on our three health priorities of mental
health, cancer, and cardio and cerebro-vascular disease.
``NHS trusts' capital expenditure will, with private finance initiative
projects, represent a record level of capital investment in the NHS in
1996-97.''

COTTISH Natural Heritage is to be given a revised remit to reflect changes in
its priorities and the level of Government funding allocated to it.
Set up only three-and-a-half years ago following a merger between the Nature
Conservation Council for Scotland and the Countryside Commission for Scotland,
it suffered a 10% cut in its budget this week of almost #5m in the public
expenditure spending round. Concerns were already being expressed last night
that SNH's recreation, access, environmental education, and reserve management
functions might fall victim to the reorganisation.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth told the House of Commons yesterday, in
response to a parliamentary question, that he had accepted the main proposal of
the report of the study group that a revised policy document, The Way Ahead,
should be prepared by the first half of next year.
Mr Dave Morris, Scottish officer of the Ramblers' Association, said last night
that he was ``very alarmed'' by the announcement.
He added: ``Ian Lang, when he was Scottish Secretary last year, promised SNH
#120m over the next three years. That has already been reneged on by Michael
Forsyth.''
Mr Steve Sankey, head of policy at the RSPB, said he supported the emphasis
placed by the review on European directives, Natura 2000 and the Bio-diversity
Action Plan.
However, he expressed concern about the potential loss of national duties, such
as the designation of Sites of Special SScientific Interest.
The study group on SNH, comprising senior officials of the then Scottish Office
Environment Department and SNH, was set up last May. Its findings include the
following recommendations:
q SNH should be more selective in choosing issues on which it spends its
advisory effort.
q Ministers should have the option to review spending on environmental
education.
q None of SNH's activities identified in the report is considered to be wholly
unnecessary or inappropriate but some may be deemed to be of insufficient
priority at a time of constrained resources.

ONE of Scotland's top archeological scientists warned yesterday that a proposed
``green'' #12m wind farm could spell disaster for a historic site that has
aroused interest from experts all over the world.
Dr Brian Moffat has spent the past 10 years excavating a medieval hospital at
Soutra Aisle in the Borders and has guided more than 100,000 visitors round the
site. He says the tours, which help cover half his #250,000 a year costs, are
in danger of being drowned out by the noise from 30 huge propeller-driven
turbines on nearby Dun Law hill.
Tonight, Dr Moffat will be one of the speakers at a meeting in the village hall
of nearby Oxton, to debate the wind-farm project. Representatives of the
community council, the Hertfordshire-based wind-farm company Renewable Energy
Systems, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and the Society for the
Preservation of Rural Scotland, are also expected to attend.
Opinions at the meeting are expected to be divided but community councillor
David Murray, 74, who is fiercely opposed to the project, said yesterday: ``The
wind farm will be on one of the most visible spots in southern Scotland. The 30
towers will straddle the main A68 road and be clearly seen from the Cheviots,
Edinburgh Castle, the Pentlands, and the Fife hills. It is a dreadful prospect.
``Our village is about three kilometres from the wind farm site and all the
feedback I am getting from people who live near these things is that you don't
discover the drawbacks until they are up and then it is too late.''
Renewable Energy Systems, a subsidiary of the giant Sir Robert McAlpine group,
has already put up six wind farms in England and Northern Ireland.
Dr Moffat says: ``Similar developments in northern England show that people
within five kilometres are subjected to a continual whirring noise. The
propeller blades alone are 44 metres in diameter.
``I am deeply worried that the noise would make it impossible for me to conduct
my tours properly and my project depends on the revenue.
``Soutra Aisle was a hospital between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries,
originally run by Augustinian monks for the sick and travellers up the main
east coast route. What we have discovered on the site has produced information
about the diseases and treatments of the past that is relevant to medicine
today. It has resulted in ground-breaking research in DNA profiling and
analytical chemistry and fourteenth century human DNA from Soutra is currently
being analysed by microbiologists at Portsmouth University.''
Work at Soutra is opening a wealth of information about long-forgotten cures.
One programme of waste analysis from the drains indicated that the monks were
using opium for treatments and it was presumed they were importing the drug.
Later, traces of a special strain of poppy - never previously thought to have
been grown so far north - were discovered in a nearby field and it was realised
that the opium had been produced at the hospital.
A spokesman for Renewable Energy Systems said yesterday: ``You obviously can't
hide the wind farm but it won't dominate the landscape. Power stations can be
just as obvious. We do not believe that the noise at Dr Moffat's site will be
significant. Visitors will be able to hear it but it will not drown his talks.
``We will be putting a case to the local community in the village hall on
Thursday night and hope to secure their support. We expect to submit a formal
planning application to Borders Regional Council early next month.''

THE Government was accused yesterday of being driven by ideology when it
announced its intention of privatising Her Majesty's Stationery Office,
established 200 years ago to print parliamentary and Government papers.
Public Services Minister Roger Freeman said if both Houses of Parliament
approved he hoped the sale could be completed by next summer, lifting the
inevitable uncertainty which had affected the staff.
He said the market for HMSO's work was shrinking. Job losses were likely unless
new sales opportunities could be taken. A small residual body would stay in the
public sector and keep the HMSO title with responsibility for administering
Crown and possibly parliamentary copyright.
Mr Freeman promised Mr Martin O'Neill (Clackmannan - Lab.) that he would look
at ways of protecting employees' pension rights.
Mr Tam Dalyell (Linlithgow - Lab.) warned that under a privatised company there
was a danger of leaks of important documents like the Budget.

EXCLUSIVE
TALKS between two hospital trusts about cost-sharing have caused speculation
about a merger. It could be the first large one of its type in Scotland.
Managements of Victoria Infirmary and Hairmyres Hospital, near East Kilbribe,
which is about to embark on a #50m rebuild paid for through the Private Finance
Initiative, have been discussing joint arrangements to make economies.
One union leader warned last night that the courtship could set the trend for
centralised hyper-hospitals driven by the commercial sector's drive to get the
maximum profit from Private Finance Initiatives.
Lothian Health is already under pressure to increase the capacity of the
PFI-backed replacement for Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, probably at the expense
of St John's Hospital in Livingston.
Mr Alistair Mack, director of medical services at the Victoria, yesterday
denied rumours, noted by a doctor in a letter to The Herald, that the staff
from the infirmary's accident and emergency department were to be moved to
Glasgow Royal Infirmary. He said the Victoria's department was now the busiest
in Glasgow and the most efficient in Scotland.
Mr Mack admitted that the trust had been in talks with the Hairmyres management
but insisted that the talks were at a basic level and that there were no
proposals.
On the possibility of a new joint hospital replacing both existing ones, he
said: ``It is difficult to say. Lanarkshire's hospital rebuilding plans are not
very clear. They still have a long way to go.''
Mr Jim Devine, senior organiser with Unison, expressed concern at the
possibility of a finance-driven restructuring being forced on the NHS so soon
after an organisation that had established the existing 47 trusts.
``My understanding is that, while they have not yet reached the stage of
marriage, the Victoria and Hairmyres are very much in courtship. How far behind
will the engagement be?
``The obvious avenue for this is the PFI initiative - a commercial backer might
see it as more attractive to replace the two with a new hospital somewhere
between the two existing sites.
``This goes beyond any expectation of hospital mergers within health board
areas. Here we have two trusts on either side of a health board boundary which
could become one. If you take the wider picture, you can see a line of five
hospitals - the Southern General, the Victoria, Hairmyres, Stonehouse, and Law
- which private operators might see commercial advantage in replacing with
two.''
``We would be very concerned if this were to become a model for the health
service of the future, driven by the profit motive.''

<HEADLINE>SNP attacks increases in road fuel price</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974897194</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SNP leader Alex Salmond has attacked the Government's increase in road fuel
duties over the past three years, describing it as a ``London levy'' on
motorists and the economy north of the Border.
His attack comes as two of Scotland's main bus operators confirm that fares are
being increased to help offset the increase in the price of diesel fuel
announced in the Budget.
Addressing a news conference in Aberdeen yesterday, Mr Salmond said Scotland's
sparse population and large number of rural communities - where petrol prices
were among the highest in the UK - had been hit hardest by Government increases
in road fuel taxes.
Mr Salmond said a Government decision to increase road fuel taxes in successive
Budgets by 3% and 5% in real terms since 1993 amounted to increases above the
rate of inflation on five separate occasions since.
He claimed the measure had cost drivers covering a Scottish average of 10,000
miles ayear an extra #150.
Mr Salmond said a lack of public transport meant drivers in rural areas of
Scotland covered 70% more miles than drivers in urban communities.
He added: ``What is needed to protect the Scottish environment is better public
transport - in both urban and rural areas - not the London levy, the only
purpose of which is to squeeze yet more Government revenue out of Scotland.''
Clydeside Buses, one of Scotland's biggest local bus operators, announced that
its fares would increase by an average of 4.5% from January 7 to help offset a
22% rise in its fuel bill.
Stagecoach, another of Scotland's main local bus operators, said fare rises of
2.1% announced earlier this week on services in the Highlands, Grampian, and
Tayside areas were also down to the Budget increases in diesel.
Lothian Region Transport, Strathclyde Buses, and Scottish CityLink, said they
shared the concern and disappointment of other bus operators at the increases.

THE lottery regulator launched an inquiry yesterday into allegations by Richard
Branson that he was offered a bribe to drop his bid for the franchise.
Mr Peter Davis, director general of Oflot, said the inquiry would centre on Mr
Branson's comments on a Panorama programme on BBC1 that Mr Guy Snowden, an
executive with GTech, one of the shareholders of Camelot, the successful
bidder, had tried to offer the bribe.
Mr Davis said: ``I am appointing a senior and independent figure to conduct an
investigation into these allegations and report to me. It is my duty to ensure
that those involved in the operation of the national lottery are fit and proper
to do so.''
Mr Branson said: ``We would welcome a genuinely independent investigation into
the events that occurred and the allegations on the Panorama programme, as long
as we could be assured it was genuinely independent.''
A spokesman for GTech said: ``Mr Snowden and GTech welcome Peter Davis's call
for an independent inquiry. On Monday, Mr Snowden wrote to Mr Davis and
Virginia Bottomley requesting an urgent investigation of the matter and he has
promised his full co-operation.''
Mr Tim Holley, chief executive of Camelot Group plc, said: ``We welcome the
announcement by the Director-General of the Office of the National Lottery that
he is to launch an inquiry. We look forward to fully co-operating in the
investigation.''
Meanwhile, a poll has shown that three-quarters of those questioned want a
windfall tax on Camelot and the same number would like to see a non
profit-making organisation taking over.
A majority also want the money raised through the lottery to be handed out in a
different way, with a larger share for good causes such as education and the
NHS.
The confidential poll was carried out by Mori but leaked to the Daily Express.
The survey of 1800 people is part of the polling company's regular research,
which is then sold to commercial clients.

<HEADLINE>Directors `knew arms were being sent to Iran'</HEADLINE>

DIRECTORS of the company at the heart of the arms-to-Iran affair were well
aware of the true destination of the weapons they were shipping, a committee of
MPs was told yesterday.
The former chairman of BMARC's parent company, Mr Gerald James, said it was
``common knowledge'' among the directors, who included former Cabinet Minister
Jonathan Aitken, that they were supplying components for naval guns to the
Tehran regime.
Mr James was giving evidence to the Trade and Industry Select Committee which
is investigating how the firm sold components to Singapore, with Government
approval, when they were apparently destined for Iran - a breach of Government
guidelines.
Mr James told the committee he had learned of the true destination of the
weapons only after his firm Astra Holdings acquired BMARC from the Swiss arms
company Oerlikon in 1988.
He said he had been told at a board meeting by Major General Donald Isles, who
had stayed on the BMARC board after the takeover and who was in charge of the
Project Lisi contract to supply Singapore.
However, he said he had been assured by General Isles, a former weapons
director at the Ministry of Defence, that the contract had the approval of the
Ministry of Defence.
Mr James said Project Lisi was discussed at every BMARC board meeting, some of
which were attended by Mr Aitken, and that Mr Aitken should have known where
the components were really going.
``If he was sitting listening, he would know,'' he said.
He admitted there was no reference to Iran in the minutes of the meetings which
had been written in a ``circumspect'' manner.
Mr William McNaught, BMARC's former managing director, dismissed Mr James's
claims as ``a pack of lies''.
He told the committee he had never been informed that the weapons components
were for Iran - although he said the size of the contract made it clear that
they were for onward sale from Singapore.
Mr James, however, told the committee he had discovered ``covert operations''
were being run by people within BMARC and that the firm had a ``secret order
book''.
He claimed other firms had used BMARC premises to store equipment while
companies such as British Aerospace, Marconi, and Royal Ordnance had been using
BMARC headed notepaper.
``We had a range of people working within the company who were clearly working
with the intelligence and security services,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Seasonally adjusted figures a grim Christmas present for unemployed, claims TUC Mixed reaction to fall in jobless</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>974897197</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland fell again last month, but yesterday political
reaction was sharply divided as it became clear that the month-by-month
reduction had slowed considerably.
The fall in the seasonally adjusted figure was 700, putting the number claiming
unemployment benefit in Scotland at 195,000, or 7.8% of the workforce. The UK
as a whole fared better, with the claimants' total dropping by 20,400 to
2,244,500 - the lowest figure since May 1991.
Although the Scottish total has recorded yet another fall, there was a rise in
the unadjusted figure - the actual number signing on with no weighting for
seasonal variations.
This prompted Mr Bill Speirs, deputy general secretary of the Scottish TUC, to
claim that the figures were a grim Christmas present to Scotland from the
Government.
``The marginal drop in the seasonally adjusted figures conceals the growing
problem of rising unemployment in those parts of the country where it is
already a major crisis,'' he said.
The union organisation argued that it showed the Secretary of State's decision
this week to cut the budget for job creation at Scottish Enterprise and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise was a disgrace.
Scottish National Party employment spokeswoman Anne McNair said it gave no
Christmas cheer to Scots, particularly the hundreds of workers at Yarrow's and
Motorola who are being made redundant this month.
Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch stressed that unemployment had been on
a downward trend for almost three years, falling by 55,500 since December 1992,
and now below 200,000 for six consecutive months.
He drew attention to an export survey published last week which showed Scottish
exports at record levels, and added: ``This confirms, once again, that the
Government's economic policies are enabling Scottish business to achieve
significant success in world markets.''
However, Labour's Scottish employment spokesman, Mr John McFall, said it was
scandalous for the Government to try to present a rosy picture on employment
when the number of unemployed young people aged 16 and 17 had risen.
The employers' organisation, the CBI, was positive, with its assistant director
in Scotland, Mr Alan Mitchell, welcoming the fall and noting that Scotland's
unemployment level remained below the national average.
He added that the cut in interest rates, also announced yesterday, could only
represent good news for business and employment prospects in 1996.
Although any drop must be welcome, the drop for the last six months was under
1% for the first time in years. During the first four months of the year, the
six-monthly figure never fell less than 3%.
The overall figures mask large regional variations. The travel to work areas of
Aberdeen, Galashiels, and Skye and Wester Ross, all have unemployment rates of
under 4%.
However, Cumnock and Sanquhar - which comes - remains the highest at 15.7%,
followed by Sutherland at 13.8%.
Only South Tyneside fares worse in the men's job stakes with 22.9% unemployed.
In all, Scotland has 10 of the 40 worst blackspots, including Forres, Wick,
Sutherland, Alloa, Invergordan and Dingwall, Girvan, the Western Isles, Irvine,
and Dunoon nd Bute.
The disparity in Scotland between men and women continues to be marked, with
male unemployment 10.8%, and female unemployment 4.1%, giving an average of
7.8%.
Employment Minister Eric Forth said the drop was further evidence that
Britain's flexible and deregulated labour market, tight control on public
spending, and low taxes were delivering economic growth and jobs.
Meanwhile, the increase in average earnings in the year to October was 3.25%,
unchanged since July.

Or not? Education correspondent Barclay McBain studies the new school
attendance figures
JOHN STREET Secondary, a Glasgow inner-city school serving areas of
deprivation, had the second highest rate of unauthorised absence - commonly
called truancy - when the 1993-4 attendance and absence figures were published
nearly a year ago.
When asked about the figures, headteacher Stewart McLachlan confidently
predicted that the school would make a massive improvement when the 1994-5
statistics were published.
This happened yesterday, and he was right. John Street's unauthorised rate has
fallen to 6%. Its authorised - or explained - absence increased from 15% to
20%. A similar thing has happened at Castlebrae Community High in Lothian,
whose catchment area is one of the most deprived in the region and which had
the highest unauthorised absence, 17%. That has fallen to 3%, while the
authorised proportion has risen from 12% to 21%.
What does it all mean, particularly for parents and school board members, at
whom the latest report is mainly aimed?
To begin with, there was no Scottish Office guidance about what constituted
authorised or unauthorised absence for 1993-4. According to headteacher Willaim
Crosbie, Castlebrae's exceptionally high unauthorised rate for that year was
partly due to the way in which it had dealt with unexplained absence.
It had treated any case on which it did not have documented evidence as
unauthorised absence, and this distinguished it from other schools.
But the explanation goes deeper. Mr Crosbie said yesterday: ``The most
important statistic of all is that our overall attendance has gone up by 5%.
This is a product of our school development plan, which sets out to create a
more positive ethos in the school.
``The children are gaining a greater belief in themselves and in what we can do
for them. I have always believed that turning attitudes round would take years
but now that it has taken hold it will continue.''
And at John Street yesterday Mr McLachlan told a similar story: ``We realised
that we had been playing a harder game. If there was no note from the parent we
automatically marked the pupil absent without permission. We did the same if we
had any doubts about the validity of an absence note.
``Now we have relaxed the system. Any contact from a parent is taken by us as
authorising the absence. Our actual attendance rate is only up by 1% but the
balance between authorised and unauthorised absence has clearly shifted.''
In January the Scottish Office issued guidelines for authorised and
unauthorised absence for the figures published yesterday. This year Linlathen
High, which serves deprived areas on the outskirts of Dundee, has paid the
price of applying rigorously high standards to what constitutes unexplained
absence by stacking up the highest unauthorised rate, 16% - compared with 0%
last year.
By strictly following up on unexplained absence, headteacher Paul Taylor - said
to be a caring and punctilious rector - appears to have bucked the general
trend in authorities of classifying as authorised as much absence as possible.
According to yesterday's figures, unauthorised absence across Scotland is 1%
and authorised 10% in the secondary sector.
Mr Taylor is off with flu and in his absence Neil Logue, a Tayside region
assistant director of education responsible for Dundee, said: ``We have to
treat statistics cautiously but in no sense would we be complacent about
absence. An overall absence rate of 21% is not something we can sit back and
say we are happy about.
``It will give us pause for thought. We must ensure that any injury that occurs
to a school that is already working hard against all forms of social
disadvantage is not left unsupported.''

Nairobi
THE brutal killers of British housewife Caron Winter were today sentenced to
death by Kenya's High Court.
The two Ugandans raped and stabbed the 31-year-old woman in her Nairobi home in
July 1994.
Caron Winter's husband, Adam, a pilot, was beaten unconscious when he arrived
home for lunch, suprising the gang. The couple's 11-month-old baby girl, Ruby,
survived unharmed.
Judge Samuel Bosire told the killers: ``I have no doubt in my mind that you
participated in the brutal murder of Mrs Caron Winter.
``It is imperative that those who caused her death should be punished
accordingly. You will therefore suffer death by hanging.''
Yusuf Rashid Wanasoro, 22, known as ``Toto'', and James Washikomba, 26, both
from Uganda, have 14 days to appeal against the sentence.
Last week three assessors found them and Kenyan Alexander Eshikavale, 37,
guilty of the rape and murder of Mrs Winter in Nairobi's affluent Karen
district.
Today the judge said he was satisfied that Wanasaro was a member of the gang
which broke into her plush suburban home to carry out a robbery in the course
of which they raped and stabbed her to death.
He said evidence against Washikomba showed ``full complicity''. However
Eshikavale was acquitted on the grounds that the case against him was provided
by a police informer who failed to give evidence in the month-long trial.
The judge said that although all the accused complained they had been tortured
and beaten up by police to force confessions, none was found to have any
injuries.
He said Wanasoro sold a video and iron box belonging to the Winters only a day
after Mrs Winter was killed.
Adam Winter and baby Ruby now live in Antigua.-Reuter.

DISAPPOINTMENT has hit Edinburgh's huge five-day Hogmanay celebrations - the
largest festival of its kind in the world - as headliners the Kinks yesterday
withdrew from the event.
The pull-out came as it was revealed that a last-minute deal has had to be
struck to secure the event in its present form. The problems occurred because
the sponsorship target from big business for the capital's celebrations had
fallen #99,000 below the level expected.
Last night, Lothian Regional Council officials were putting a brave face on the
short-fall and agreed to chip in another #33,000 to the event's budget.
A similar sum is to be put in by Edinburgh District Council and by Lothian and
Edinburgh Enterprise Limited. The whole five-day event is expected to cost
around #590,000.
Meanwhile, Unique Events, organisers of the Hogmanay concert in Princes Street
Gardens, said the Kinks, whose hits have included Lola and Waterloo Sunset,
cancelled because their lead singer, Ray Davies, was stranded in Australia with
a perforated ear drum.
However, Ms Faith Liddell, of the company, said she was confident another big
name band would be lined up to take over from the Kinks.
Four thousand tickets for the event, which also includes Big Country, Edwyn
Collins, and the Scottish Fiddle Orchestra, have been sold.

SCOTLAND'S tough laws on carrying knives are leading to more prosecutions,
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said last night.
The Carrying of Knives (Scotland) Act, introduced as a Private Member's Bill by
Ayr Tory MP Phil Gallie, resulted in 561 successful prosecutions in 1993-94.
With very few exceptions, the Bill made it an offence to carry a knife or
sharply-pointed object in a public place and placed on the carrier of the knife
the burden of establishing that he had good reason for carrying it.
The issue has been highlighted by the fatal stabbing in London of headmaster
Philip Lawrence.
Of the 561 prosecutions in Scotland, 207 - or 37% - resulted in a custodial
sentence, of which 84 were between three and six months, and eight were in
excess of six months.
Mr Forsyth said he thought this suggested that the range of penalties the Act
made available to the courts to deal with ``this insidious crime'' was pitched
at the right level.
He added: ``The Bill became law at the end of May, 1993, towards the end of
Strathclyde Police's Operation Blade. These two intitatives together had a
considerable effect on reducing the levels of knife-related crime in the areas
where it was most prevalent at the time, namely Strathclyde and Glasgow.''
THE Commons was warned yesterday against a ``knee-jerk reaction'' to the fatal
stabbing of the London headmaster.
The caution came before a Tory backbench Bill for action in England and Wales
to crack down on knives, backed by the Government, was presented formally in
the Commons.
Liberal Democrat Paul Tyler said: ``We have got to be very careful that we
don't adopt a policy of reacting at such speed that we then do so in a way that
is defective.''
The Offensive Weapons Bill, sponsored by Lady Olga Maitland (Sutton and Cheam -
Con.) later gained its unopposed formal first reading among a range of other
backbench measures to be debated this session.

LABOUR officials on Lothian Regional Council yesterday admitted to being more
than a little embarrassed over a late demand from agents acting for former
Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev for a #50,000 lecture fee.
Mr Gorbachev delivered the lecture in Edinburgh two years ago as one of a
series organised by the council. It has not been the council's policy to pay
any of the speakers.
A full council meeting in Edinburgh yesterday agreed to opt for an out-of-court
settlement likely to cost the council #26,000 rather than to continue disputing
the claim for payment by First Artist Corporation which arranged Mr Gorbachev's
UK tour.
During the meeting, Conservative councillors claimed there had been
incompetence by officials over the arrangements as there was no documentation
on the question of fees. However, they did not blame the current chief
executive, Mr Tom Aitchison, who was not in charge at the time.
Lothian convener Eric Milligan said the settlement recommended by regional
solicitor Gerry Welsh was the best course of action, although the matter left
``a sour taste'' in his mouth. He stressed that the Gorbachev lecture had been
different from the others in the series as it had involved dealing with an
intermediary over the arrangements.
In his report, Mr Welsh said the council's position had been weakened because
no communication had been sent to First Artist Corporation expressly denying
legal liability.
The region's Labour leader, Councillor Keith Geddes, said this was ``a moment
of some embarrassment for the council''. Lothian officials had acted in good
faith but had perhaps shown a touch of naivety.

THE problems of the Glasgow-based Student Loans Company have been resolved, MPs
heard yesterday, following a disastrous start which saw thousands of students
unable to receive their loans and the sacking of its chief executive.
The Public Accounts Committee was told by Sir Tim Lankester, permanent
secretary at the Department of Education and Employment, that the company was
achieving its targets for cost reductions, and had overcome its initial
problems.
``I think the problems are largely behind it. There certainly were some
weaknesses in internal systems in the company in the early years. But I believe
that they have now been rectified,'' he said.
``No doubt that this project was poorly planned and poorly implemented. But it
was an operational matter for the company. When the company became aware of the
problem I believe they did take urgent action.
``But by that time in a way it was too late. The system had exploded and
required a tremendous effort to get it back on track.''
The committee was told how in 1994 the company had struggled to cope with
thousands of telephone calls as students applying for loans tried to obtain
information to help them complete their application forms. Earlier this year,
the company's chief executive, Mr Ron Harrison, was sacked.
The number of students receiving their loans on time was now running at 93%,
with only 7% of applicants experiencing difficulties.
Sir Tim told the committee the idea of student loans had become accepted. ``My
impression is that it has become acceptable. Students no longer regard it as an
evil that has been imposed upon them,'' he said.
He also disclosed that although the company was cutting back on issuing company
cars to new employees, a third of the 300 people who work for the company were
eligible for private health insurance.
q The maximum for student loans is to rise by 2.6% for students in Scotland,
the Scottish Education Minister, Mr Raymond Robertson, said last night.
The move is in line with the rates announced for students in England and Wales
last month.
Full-year students studying away from home will be allowed a maximum loan of
#1645 for 1996-97, compared with #1385 in 1995-96.
However, the main rate of grant for students living at home and away from home
is reduced accordingly, as grants are replaced by loans in line with Government
policy.

THE miners of Monktonhall colliery in Midlothian who bought their own pit will
decide today whether or not to accept a buy-out.
Their annual general meeting will discuss a proposal from Waverley Mining
Finance, the company which wants to take over with a share offer to 200 men who
invested #10,000 of their own money in the future of the colliery. It recently
offered 10,000 ordinary shares in exchange for the miners' 51% holding.

Briton suspected
of suicide mission
CAIRO: A Briton is among 56 suspected Muslim militants arrested in raids by
security forces across Egypt over the past week.
Akram Abdelaziz Mahmoud al-Sharif, described as a naturalised Briton who works
as a driver and is married to a British woman, is said to have been one of the
leaders of a suicide unit which had planned blasts in Egypt. Large quantities
of weapons and money, some transferred from London, were said to have been
seized.
BBC man killed
DUSHANBE: A BBC journalist has been shot dead in the former Soviet republic of
Tajikistan. The body of Mohydin Alempour, 50, who had worked for the BBC's
Persian language service for five years, was found on a university campus in
the capital Dushanbe with several bullet wounds in the chest.
Reeve goes home
NEW YORK: Superman actor Christopher Reeve went home with his wife and children
after six months' treatment at a rehabilitation centre. Reeve has been
paralysed since he was thrown by a horse in May.
Sex case raised
PARIS: The European Court of Human Rights is to review a case brought by three
British homosexuals given prison sentences for causing one another bodily harm
during sado-masochistic orgies. The European Commission of Human Rights has
found that their right to privacy had not been interfered with and referred the
case to the court, which generally follows the Commission's rulings.
Kabul in crisis
KABUL: More than 500,000 people in the war-ravaged Afghan capital Kabul face
disaster this winter unless a blockade denying vital fuel and food is lifted,
the UN has warned. Its co-ordinator for humanitarian affairs, Alex Thier, said
most Afghans could not afford the supplies they need to survive.
New life found
COPENHAGEN: Danish scientists claim to have found an entirely new life form
living on the lips of a Norwegian lobster. Symbion pandora, which looks like an
animated cold sore on the mouth of its host, is composed mostly of a funnel
with a round mouth. However it is not only a species but forms an entirely new
phylum, or level of biological classification.
Four get life
GREEN BAY: Four Wisconsin men have been sentenced to life in prison for
throwing a fellow worker to his death in the pulp pit of a paper mill because
he told police one of them planned to steal a #1.50 extension cord. Two others
have yet to be sentenced.
Police chief jailed
RIGA: The 87-year-old former head of the security police in Latvia, Alfons
Noviks, will spend the rest of his life in jail after being convicted of
genocide. Noviks led the NKVD security police in 1940-53, when thousands of
people were jailed, deported, and killed in Stalinist purges.
Code for Santa
TORONTO: Canada has given Santa Claus his own postcode for Christmas. More than
one million letters sent each year to Santa at the North Pole, Canada, will be
sped on their way if they carry the code H0H 0H0.

<HEADLINE>Labour leaders postpone decision over councillors facing accusations of nepotism Judgment on Monklands delayed</HEADLINE>

LABOUR has postponed until the new year the day of reckoning for Monklands
councillors facing accusations that nepotism brought the party into disrepute.
It had been expected that the results of an internal party investigation into
the saga would be placed before the National Executive Committee in London
yesterday.
Instead, the committee was told that the investigators, headed by party
chairwoman Diana Jeuda, still had been in Lanarkshire right up until Tuesday
and the report had not been yet been written.
A statement issued by both the London and Scottish headquarters of the Labour
Party said simply: ``The chair of the party reported that the inquiry into
Monklands was only completed last night.
``It is a serious situation and the report will require careful and detailed
consideration. As a written report is not yet ready it was not possible to
consider the result of the inquiry in any detail or for today's NEC to reach
any conclusions or recommendations. A full report will, therefore, come before
January's NEC, where decisions will be made.''
However, Labour sources confirmed yesterday that the final report will include
recommendations of disciplinary action against some of those involved. ``It is
inevitable that the report will recommend disciplinary action in some cases.
The case was complicated, it was serious and it requires, where appropriate,
some tough action,'' a source said.
Although the report will be an internal Labour document, party officials say it
is unavoidable that it will be made public. ``It will remain a confidential
document until the NEC considers it. After that, it will be impossible to keep
such a thing confidential.''
The delay pushes the internal party report back nearer to the expected
publication of an official Scottish Office inquiry into the affair, conducted
by Mr William Nimmo-Smith, QC.
This led to accusations by political opponents yesterday that Labour was
putting off the inevitable row. ``The continuing uncertainty will be unwelcome
not only to Labour Party activists, but also to the wider electorate in the
Monklands area,'' said Scottish Tory deputy chairwoman Annabel Goldie.
``There will be surprise that after all this time the Labour Party has not been
able to deal definitively with the situation.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ``It looks to me as if Labour are simply
postponing the evil day when they have to face the fall-out from what their
councillors have been doing over a prolonged period. Sooner or later, they are
going to have to come clean.''
However, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said there was nothing
sinister about the fact that the written report had not yet been concluded, and
he said their own inquiry and the official investigation by Mr Nimmo-Smith
meant the matter was effectively sub judice.
He added: ``Opponents will make accusations against us whether we say anything
or not, but the truth is there are occasions when even politicans should remain
silent.''
SCOTTISH local authority leaders look set to back proposals to give the Local
Government Ombudsman sweeping new powers to investigate the conduct of
councillors which were put forward in a report last week, (writes Frances
Horsburgh).
A full meeting of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in Edinburgh
tomorrow will finalise its response to the options put forward by the joint
Scottish Office/Cosla task force of officials.
It supports the Ombudsman being allowed to pursue complaints involving the
actions of individual councillors and being able to investigate
maladministration relating to the appointment of officials.
Cosla also favours an extension of the Ombudsman's powers to cover personnel
and contractual matters.
The task force was set up at the suggestion of the Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth following the allegations over Monklands and ``jobs for the boys''
claims over the the new North Lanarkshire Council.

ITV is to screen Formula 1 motor races from 1997 in a deal which has stunned
the BBC.
The agreement, reported to have cost the independent companies up to #70m, is
for five years beginning from the Brazilian Grand Prix in March 1997.
ITV says it also includes screening the FIA International Touring Car
Championship and the Formula 3000 International Championship.
The BBC admitted the news was a surprise. Commentator Murray Walker heard the
announcement on his car radio as he drove home from a lunchtime speaking
engagement.
Having lost the FA Cup Final to ITV from May 1998, the BBC has now had to
concede another prime sporting spot.
In a five-year deal, ITV each season will broadcast all 16 Grand Prix races
live on Sundays together with a highlights programme.
A spokeswoman for BBC Sport said: ``We are extremely shocked. We had no notice
of a deal and were not given an opportunity to put in a bid.
``Our distress is further deepened by the fact that Grand Prix motor racing was
nurtured and developed by BBC TV.''
The news could spell the end of the line for the voice of motorsport, Murray
Walker, who has commentated distinctively on the sport since 1949.
The 72-year-old former advertising executive has been the TV frontman since
Grand Prix became a regular feature in 1977.
He said last night: ``The news was a shock not only to me but to everybody on
the BBC Grand Prix team. I knew nothing about it although I knew the contract
would be coming up for renewal.''
An ITV spokeswoman said: ``We have not even decided who will prepare the
programmes for us, let alone who will present them. The contract has only just
been signed.''
The ITV deal was negotiated with Mr Bernie Ecclestone, president of the Formula
One Constructors' Association. The former boss at Brabham is one of the most
important men in motor racing and negotiates deals around  the world.

A MUSICIAN yesterday confirmed that her 62-year-old lover told her their sex
session in the back of his car on the night he died was to be their last,
because he was leaving her.
But Mrs Pollyanna Peate denied having a row with Mr Brian Phillips or attacking
him, insisting: ``He died having sex. I'm sorry, but that's how it happened.
I've got nothing to admit.''
Chester Crown Court has heard that, over a period of 10 years, the couple had
regularly had sex in a lovers' lane after rehearsals with Frodsham Silver Band
in an affair they hid from their marital partners but which was ``an open
secret'' among their fellow musicians.
Mrs Peate, 34, of Runcorn, Cheshire, a euphonium player, denies the
manslaughter of Mr Phillips, a bass trombonist, on the night of November 15,
1994.
The prosecution says she attacked him, striking him at least four times after
he tried to end their affair, and that Mr Phillips, who had suffered a coronary
in 1972, died of a heart attack as a result.
Mrs Peate, a mother-of-two, confirmed yesterday that Mr Phillips had told her
in the car that it was to be the last time they would have sex together.
But, under cross-examination from Mr Mervyn Hughes, QC, prosecuting, she added:
``He was always saying silly little things. It came to the point where I didn't
take much notice.''
Mr Hughes: It was an important announcement that you became very upset about.
Mrs Peate: No.
You sat up and asked him what he meant. After 10 years he was bringing the
relationship to an end. - No.
He was throwing you over. - Nothing like that happened at all.
You lost control and became hysterical. - No.
You began to hit him around the head. - Nothing like that happened. He died
having sex with me. I wouldn't hit him.
She agreed that when Mr Phillips died she went home and pretended nothing had
happened, chatting with her 12-year-old daughter.
Mr Hughes: During the course of the night you gave not one moment's thought to
Brian Phillips or indeed to Mrs Phillips?
Mrs Peate: I was thinking of him. I was a bit upset and trying to keep myself
calm.
She said she had been frightened and was trying to cover her tracks.
Earlier, Mrs Peate told the court of her attempts to revive Mr Phillips in the
tight confines of the car.
``We were making love,'' she said. ``He collapsed. He just fell on top of me. I
said something like `Brian, what's the matter?' ''
She said he did not respond and she hit his back while she was underneath him.
She eventually managed to struggle from under him and turned his head sideways,
still calling his name.
``I was patting his face with my fingers but I got no response. I pressed twice
on his back and the second time he took one deep breath and he seemed to be
breathing again.''
She said she managed after several attempts to turn him on to his back, but
when she put an ear to his chest could not hear any breathing.
``I pressed on his chest to see if I could get any response but I couldn't get
any. I breathed into his mouth. His chest rose but I couldn't get anything. I
had no first aid training.
``I was a bit upset by then. I was cradling him, holding his hand and crying.''
She continued: ``I couldn't leave him without his trousers on. I had to make
him respectable. I found his trousers and got them on him eventually, with
difficulty.
``I made sure he was decent, and made sure I was thinking straight and my
emotions were intact. I made sure I was decent, put my dress on, made sure all
the car windows were wound up, got my instrument, and went.''
The jury is expected to retire today.

IT is easy to reduce the calories and fat from the Christmas Blowout and still
enjoy the meal.
n Choose a fruit starter, eg melon, or have the fish without the mayonnaise.
n Use half the amount of butter on bread, or use a low fat spread instead.
n Stick to white meat turkey, and do not eat the skin. Most of the fat is found
just under the skin. Avoid duck which is a high fat meat (50% of the calories
come from fat, compared with 8% in turkey).
n Make gravy from a stock cube rather than the meat juices.
n Make bread sauce from semi-skimmed milk rather than full fat milk.
n Have two roast potato pieces instead of four.
n Do not add extra butter to vegetables, eg buttered carrots.
n Have two glasses of wine instead of three.
n Serve Greek yoghurt on Christmas pud or mince pies. You can even mix in some
brandy and make a low fat version of brandy butter - two teaspoons of Greek
yoghurt has 85 calories, one teaspoon of regular brandy butter has 235 calories.
n Enjoy a drink but go easy - alcoholic drinks are a surprisingly high source
of calories.

Palme clue
STOCKHOLM: A man dying of cancer has given a possible new clue in the unsolved
1986 murder of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme. Former nightclub owner Sigge
Cedergren says he gave a Smith &amp; Wesson .357 to small-time criminal Christer
Pettersson shortly before the shooting. Palme's widow picked out Pettersson as
the man who shot her husband, but he was cleared of the murder in a 1989 trial.

THE loss of 550 jobs at Motorola's mobile-phone plant in West Lothian has come
as no surprise to those connected to the electronics industry.
The industry is notorious for hiring temporary staff - on contracts as short as
one week. Its use of employment agencies to find such recruits, and even pay
their wages, is also rife.
Motorola was adamant yesterday that the axe was not wielded at Easter Inch,
near Bathgate, because of a slump.
Alarm bells still sounded because the axe's fall coincided with a quarterly
survey by employers' federation Scottish Engineering which, for the first time
in five years, showed a fall in orders in the electronic sector.
It found 36% of electronics firms had registered a fall in orders, and recorded
a 16% dip in confidence.
The results were contradicted by numerous parties, including the Scottish
Electronics' Forum, which represents major firms, and Scottish Industry
Minister George Kynoch.
Mr Stewart Dunlop, a research fellow at Strathclyde University's influential
Fraser of Allander Institute, put the job losses and survey in perspective.
He saw no reason for Motorola's cuts other than the seasonal nature of its
business, with production concentrated in the lead-up to Christmas. He was
adamant the electronics' sector was continuing to grow.
Scottish Electronics' Forum spokesman Sam McEwan said Motorola's losses were
not a shock and added that the survey contradicted what the industry was saying
- that ``they have never been busier''.
Scottish Engineering chief executive Howard Jordan said seasonal trends
appeared to be dictating the fall in orders for the electronics sector,
traditionally the strongest and most consistent in the engineering industry
since 1990.
Ironically, Motorola, a member of the federation, did not return the
questionnaire for the quarter to December.
A spokesman said yesterday that a large number of weekly-contracted staff had
been taken on to deal with Christmas demand, with cellular phones one of this
year's top-selling gifts.
He added: ``Now we have built up stock, we are stopping the contractors' staff.
They knew they were on a short-term contract up to Christmas and none of our
staff of over 2000 is concerned.''
Melville Craig Selection, involved in temporary staff recruiting, declined to
comment.
Industry Minister George Kynoch said: ``The survey is at odds with our own
close contact with firms in the sector.''
Jobs continued to be created ``at a very high rate'' and he pointed out to
three inward investment announcements in the last month alone which will create
4000 jobs.
A Scottish Enterprise spokesman said Motorola had more than 2000 permanent
employees and was ``well positioned'' to meet expansion forecasts over the next
five years.
q.THE battle for the title of Scotland's other national drink was effectively
settled yesterday when the maker of the main rival to Irn-Bru went into
receivership.
The efforts of Rivets Iron Brew, made in Dundee by Meri-mate, to win business
from A.G Barr, the Glasgow-based soft drinks company which makes Irn-Bru, ended
abruptly yesterday, putting 80 jobs in jeopardy.
q.ONE hundred people at Polaroid UK's camera production plant at Vale of Leven
Industrial estate in Dumbarton are to lose their jobs before Christmas.

THIS little pig went to market, this little pig stayed at home, this little pig
- well he was an orphan called Babe who believed his role in life was to be a
sheepdog, or more accurately a sheep pig, and he is my tip for the winner in
the Christmas movie box office stakes.
Based on Dick King-Smith's The Sheep Pig, Babe is an enchanting tale about an
orphaned talking piglet who thinks he is a sheepdog. When Babe's collie foster
mother, Fly, who has taught him the ways of the dog, is incapacitated on the
day of the big sheepdog trials guess who comes to the rescue of kindly Farmer
Hoggett? Babe, of course.
Having gone expecting little, because talking animals can be dire, as anybody
who remembers Francis the talking mule knows, it proved a case of leaving the
cinema crying ``Oui, oui oui'' all the way home. Adults will get as much
pleasure as children from this funny, stylish, inventive film written and
produced by George Miller, who gave the world the Mad Max movies, which just
goes to show how infinite is the variety of man.
Made in Australia, and directed by Chris Noonan, the film mixes real animals -
some 22 piglets were needed to play Babe because piglets grow up so quickly -
with animatronic birds and beasts created by Jim Henson's Creature Workshop. If
anybody can tell when the fake takes over from the real thing they are a better
man than I, Gunga Din. The only thing that jars is the animals' voices, which
tend to be an awkward mid-Atlantic mix designed, I suspect, for that vital
American market made up of people who cannot understand plain English. Babe,
for instance, spoken by Christine Cavanagh, is pure American bratpacker,
whereas Miriam Margolyes's Fly is more Mummerset. This bizarre linguistic mix
could have been a serious flaw, but, as one gets used to it, a never-never land
in which the fantasy thrives is created and in the end it is only slightly
irritating.
Not that Babe lives in dreamland. His world is a harsh one in which little pigs
lose their mothers in the natural course of events when they are turned into
sausages or a nice pot roast. It is a fate the spunky Babe, who is forever
getting into scrapes, will face in time, except he is lucky and escapes the
abattoir.
The animals, ranging from a headstrong gander called Ferdinand to a motherly
sheep called Maa, who teaches Babe manners - if you want to get a sheep to do
something, ask politely - and a jealous collie called Rex who objects to Babe
upsetting the natural order of things are nicely characterised. Most delightful
of all, is the trio of singing field mice, who perform in the margins of the
movie, warbling away like bucolic Andrews Sisters.
Kenneth Branagh's In the Bleak Midwinter is a diverting story of actors at work
and play which he has both written and directed. Maybe the characters are
two-dimensional, maybe they are cliches, but then actors are not as other folk
- without a role to play, somebody else's words to speak, they are often
insubstantial creatures - and Branagh has assembled his mixture of dreadful old
theatrical jokes and biting insights into what it is like to put on a show with
great skill.
Shot in black and white, and packed with some ripe pieces of character acting,
it is a blatant homage to the world of Ealing, but why not? There are worse
things to do than that.
Michael Moloney, in sparkling manic form, is an out-of-work actor whose sister
wants him to help save a local church in a village called Hope from developers
by staging a Christmas show in it to raise funds. With a little help from his
agent (Joan Collins), he assembles a cast of assorted thespians who agree, on a
profit-sharing, if there are any, basis to do Hamlet. We see the auditions, the
rehearsals and the performance when that magic moment occurs and these oddballs
become the characters in the play.
Richard Briers, as an elderly repertory actor, whose life has been one long
round of Agatha Christie and French Window plays, is hilarious as he seizes his
first chance to do a Shakespeare. He gets to play Claudius opposite - this
being an ``experimental production'' - a Gertrude played to the hilt by John
Sessions, a camp pantomime dame, ``Own tits, will travel''. The rest of the
performances are admirable, except for Jennifer Saunders whose Hollywood
producer is so dreadful she should be tarred, feathered and ridden out of town
on a rail. In the Christmas stakes this is a good one for grown-ups.
There is no denying that Three Wishes, directed by Martha Coolidge, has its
heart in the right place and is a seasonable offering. Set in a small American
town in 1955, it tells how Korean war widow Jeanne (Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio) is having problems rearing her two small sons, Tom (Joseph
Mazzello) 11 years old, lousy at baseball and discontented, and Gunny (Seth
Mumy), five years old, cute and suffering from cancer. One day out in the car,
avoiding a straying dog, she knocks down a vagrant (Patrick Swayze) and, full
of remorse, invites him to stay until his injured leg gets better.
We are in the feel-good world of Frank Capra, although Capra would have got
things moving a little faster than Ms Coolidge, whose touch is distinctly
leaden. Since it is Capraland, when Swayze turns out to be far from what he
seems, it is no surprise - angels come in many guises. The moral is be happy
with what you have. Mastrantonio is charming, the boys are believable, and
Swayze is watchable as the man from yonder, but one does wish occasionally one
were somewhere else.
Not, however, at The Tie that Binds, in which childless Moira Kelly and Vincent
Spano adopt mysterious, maladjusted, abandoned six-year-old Janie whose real
parents, Daryl Hannah and Keith Carradine are homicidal hippy maniacs. Having

dismal directorial debut for screenwriter Wesley (Wolf, Arachnaphobia and Cape

It would not be Christmas without a cartoon fairy story, and there being no

variation on Swan Lake, will have to do.
But the dreadful, overly familiar songs by David Zippel and Lex de Azevedo made
me think there might be something to be said for Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Seekers after fairy tale magic, although not the variety for children, will
find it in abundance in Jean Cocteau's 50-year-old La Belle et La Bete. The
newly-restored negative, despite a couple of worrying jump cuts where
presumably deterioration had gone too far, presents his spellbinding tale about
the beast in man in as perfect a state as it is ever going to be. A masterpiece.

Verona
UP TO 49 people on board a Romanian aircraft were killed tonight when an engine
caught fire shortly after take-off from Verona in northern Italy.
``One engine caught fire. It was seen from the tower,'' said marketing director
Dorin Dainu of the Romanian company Banat Air in Bucharest.
The number of people on board was in doubt as Banat officials gave crew numbers
varying from five to eight.
A local government official in Verona told Italian television: ``It doesn't
seem there are any survivors. It's a case now of identifying the remains.''
Police and fire brigade officials said the plane, a Russian-built Antonov 24,
had been on a regular thrice-weekly charter run to Bucharest from Verona's
Villafranca airport.
A fire brigade spokesman said the plane plunged to the ground about 900yd
beyond the airport and crashed in a vineyard near the village of Caluri.
He added that at least 31 of the passengers were believed to have been Italian
and the rest from former Yugoslavia and the Netherlands. The crew was Romanian,
said a regional official.
A fierce blaze, fuelled by the plane's full tanks, reduced it to blackened
wreckage spread across several hundreds of yards of snow-covered fields. The
largest piece that could be seen was the tail.
A row of coffins covered by plastic sheeting was laid out nearby. Hundreds of
onlookers crowded the narrow, muddy roads near the site and police struggled to
keep them back.-Reuter/AP.

attention from the good news of a quarter point cut in the base rate to 6.5%.
Mr Clarke's move, backed by Bank of England Governor Eddie George at their
monthly meeting, had been widely expected after his cautious Budget failed to
deliver the stimulus which City analysts said was needed to boost slowing
economic growth.
The size of the cut disappointed business leaders and left them asking for more
but it prompted a reduction in home loan rates, which came down by the same
amount.
They had already been trimmed two weeks ago in anticipation of the base rate
cut and no further decrease was expected by industry experts.
The Halifax, Britain's biggest lender, set the ball rolling by announcing that
its basic home loan rate was being cut to 7.49% from 7.74% - its lowest level
since 1966.
Abbey National, the second biggest lender, and Nationwide, the second biggest
society, were among those that followed suit.
Presenting a united front at a news conference at the Treasury, Mr Clarke said
both he and the Governor, who were at odds over rates during the summer when Mr
George unsuccessfully argued for them to be raised, had both gone into the
meeting with a 0.25% cut in mind.
They said it was a genuine move towards a more gradualist approach to interest
rate changes in a new low inflation environment rather than the sort of messy
compromise that was behind the last 0.25% move in February 1994.
At that time, Mr Clarke had wanted to cut rates by 0.5% and Mr George wanted
them left on hold.
Mr George said: ``I am very happy that we were in a situation to advise that we
thought a quarter point was a sensible, prudent move.
``I am delighted.......that we have been able to move to a situation where we
will, I hope, be able to move in smaller steps in the future because I think
that's a very big further phase in the stabilisation of the economy.''
Opposition politicians attacked Mr Clarke's base rate move as an admission of
failure.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said rates were being cut because the economy
was weak not strong.
``With business investment stagnant after three years of recovery, this cut can
only strengthen the economy if it is combined with the measures Labour has
proposed to increase long-term investment in industry, skills, and
infrastructure,'' said Mr Brown.
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce said: ``The cut in interest
rates is an acknowledgement of how slowly the economy is now growing - probably
a mere 1% annually at present, hardly a tribute to Government economic policy.''
CARELESS remarks by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to a Commons committee yesterday
wrecked the Government's ``triple whammy'' of good news, lower interest rates,
falling unemployment, and rising High Street sales.
He claimed the poorest 10% of the nation have ``very good accountants.''
Mr Clarke later tried to rescue this situation on BBC TV claiming that his
remarks to the Treasury Select Committee on the effects of his Budget had been
taken out of context and the statistics did not validate the concept that the
poorest 10% are less well off.
But today the Chancellor's colleagues are left with another political mess when
they might have hoped that the economic figures yesterday indicated that people
are going to feel better off next year.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown was quick to exploit the situation. ``Only the
top 10% of earners in this country have very good accountants. All the Tory tax
changes have benefited those at the top while the middle and lower income
Britain has suffered.''
The Chancellor told the committee that the statistics about the bottom 10% of
the nation ``drive me up the wall. They are rather an unrealistic guide. The
statistics don't work for this bottom 10%.
``If you look at their purchasing, their purchasing has soared. Some of these
people you get in the bottom 10% are people who declare they have no income,
but they actually people with very good accountants.''
He went on to point out that the less well off drink more and smoke more than
the average of the population. ``Tobacco tax features higher in the budgets of
the poorest 10%,'' he said, ``they just smoke a lot.''
The Chancellor's remarks to the Treasury Select Committee caused anguish among
the beleaguered Tory back benchers who, some of whom said last night that the
quarter per cent cut in the basic cost of borrowing is too timid.
Later on in BBC Newsnight, Mr Clarke insisted that he has produced all the
economic indicators to provide for a stable steady recovery which will feed
through to voters' spending power in the new year. ``I have reduced tax and
spending and set Government borrowing on a downward course. We are producing a
stable economic recovery.''
He insisted that his growth forecast for next year will be about 2#f%. ``It is
miles above 2% already. British unemployment is now down to 8% and interest
rates are falling to the lowest level for several years.''
The controversy will irk Mr Clarke because it will deflect

ITV is to screen Formula 1 motor races from 1997 in a deal which has stunned
the BBC.
The agreement, reported to have cost the independent companies up to #70m, is
for five years beginning from the Brazilian Grand Prix in March 1997.
ITV says it also includes screening the FIA International Touring Car
Championship and the Formula 3000 International Championship.
The BBC admitted the news was a surprise. Commentator Murray Walker heard the
announcement on his car radio as he drove home from a lunchtime speaking
engagement.
Having lost the FA Cup Final to ITV from May 1998, the BBC has now had to
concede another prime sporting spot.
In a five-year deal, ITV each season will broadcast all 16 Grand Prix races
live on Sundays together with a highlights programme.
A spokeswoman for BBC Sport said: ``We are extremely shocked. We had no notice
of a deal and were not given an opportunity to put in a bid.
``Our distress is further deepened by the fact that Grand Prix motor racing was
nurtured and developed by BBC TV.''
The news could spell the end of the line for the voice of motorsport, Murray
Walker, who has commentated distinctively on the sport since 1949. The
72-year-old former advertising executive has been the TV frontman since Grand
Prix became a regular feature in 1977.
He said last night: ``The news was a shock not only to me but to everybody on
the BBC Grand Prix team. I knew nothing about it although I knew the contract
would be coming up for renewal.
``I don't know what will happen. I stopped doing my day job as I wanted to do
more on motorsport and I have adored every second of it. I suppose I will have
to stop some time but it is the furthest thing from my mind. If someone asked
me to go on, I would be interested.''
An ITV spokeswoman said: ``We have not even decided who will prepare the
programmes for us, let alone who will present them. The contract has only just
been signed.''
She added that the veteran broadcaster could be considered but it could be some
time before the final format is decided.
The ITV deal was negotiated with Mr Bernie Ecclestone, president of the Formula
One Constructors' Association. The former boss at Brabham is one of the most
important men in motor racing and negotiates deals around the world.
He said: ``The agreement reached with ITV assures more Formula 1 and motorsport
coverage in the UK.''

THE rocketing publicity budget at the Scottish Office since Mr Michael Forsyth
took over as Secretary of State is to be questioned in the Commons. Opponents
claim civil servants have been forced into political roles.
The Scottish Office last night denied that media monitoring activities,
previously carried out by Conservative Central Office, had been off-loaded on
to the taxpayer, but it accepted that a swifter and more extensive service in
this area was being market-tested using a private sector company.
Mr Forsyth has taken on two full-time political advisers, journalist Gerald
Warner and the former media head of the Scottish Conservatives, Ms Jacqui Low,
on full salaries. Both are experienced professionals.
This contrasts, say critics, with the previous practice of appointing younger
staff prepared to take the job on as a foot on the ladder of political
ambition. Mr Forsyth has cranked up the level of activity since taking office
to the point where an outside company is now carrying out media monitoring on
behalf of the Scottish Office.
The SNP leader, Mr Alex Salmond, is tabling a series of Commons questions
about
what he sees as ``propaganda at the taxpayers' expense'', raising the whole
issue of the way in which Mr Forsyth has created a ``Ministry of Propaganda''
at St Andrew's House.
However, Ms Liz Drummond, head of the information directorate at St Andrew's
House, said last night: ``When people criticise the alleged politicisation of
the information directorate of the
Continued on Page 2Continued from Page 1
Scottish Office, they are not in fact criticising Ministers.
``They are criticising the integrity and professionalism of the civil servants
involved. I have been a government information officer for over 25 years and I
have served both Tory and Labour Ministers - the last Labour Minister being
the
late John Smith at the Department of Trade. I have tried to serve them all
while maintaining true political neutrality.''
Mr Salmond is tabling questions in the House asking about Scottish Office
media
monitoring and how long these arrangements have been in place. He is also
asking about the awarding of any outside contracts, their duration, and their
value.
Mr Michael Russell, SNP chief executive, said last night: ``The issue is one
of
Government interference. It is quite clear that every statement from the
Scottish Office has to be stamped with a health and credibility warning
because
civil servants are now being subjected to political interference. Michael
Forsyth is politicising government in Scotland in an unprecedented way and
further endangering Scottish democracy.''
The issue has already been raised by the Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George
Robertson, who questioned the outlay on political advisers but was told this
brought the staffing ``up to complement''.
At Monday's meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee, Mr Forsyth then rebuffed
critics by pointing out the staffing of the leader of the Opposition's office
from public funds.

strong enough to kill 250 people, can make bad whisky taste good.
Perhaps envious of the quality of Scotland's Water of Life, Japanese scientists
have been conducting research to make cheap whisky and bad wine taste better.
Not content with a drop of water, they turned to gamma rays.
Mr Hiroshi Watanabe, joint head of research at the Japan Atomic Power Company's

<HEADLINE>Angry mob torches shops and cars after protest over death of man in police custody Looting as riot erupts in Brixton</HEADLINE>

A RAMPAGING mob looted shops and started a number of fires last night after a
protest about the death of a black man escalated into a riot on the streets of
Brixton, south London.
Shops and cars were torched as a gang of about 100 black and white youths
stormed along Brixton Road, pulling clothes and electrical goods from the
shattered windows of shops.
About 50 police officers in riot gear formed a line across the road to stifle
pockets of trouble and prevent anyone entering the area - the scene of massive
rioting in 1981.
One report said two shots were fired as the centre of the demonstration moved
into the area of the Ritzy cinema and a police motor cyclist was said to have
been pulled from his machine by a crowd of at least 10 rioters.
As a police helicopter hovered amid a pall of black smoke that hung over the
streets, other officers sealed off a two-mile area around the centre of Brixton
and both Brixton and Stockwell tube stations were closed.
At one point, police charged a group of around 10 people who were throwing
missiles through the window of the Body Shop. One youth was pulled to the
ground and another was led away with his hands in the air.
On the other side of the street, a group of black youths shouted ``Killers,
killers'' at the police.
The man whose death sparked the riot was Wayne Douglas, 26, who was arrested
last week, suspected of aggravated burglary.
He was said to have broken into a flat in Brixton, threatened the family inside
with a knife, stolen bread and then made off. He was chased into a nearby
children's playground where, after a struggle, he was arrested, sources said.
The Police Complaints Authority said Douglas was taken to Brixton police
station where he suffered a fatal collapse. A post-mortem examination revealed
he had been suffering from heart disease.
A spokesman for the authority said: ``Tests are still continuing.
``The police contacted the PCC immediately and an investigation was launched
under the control of Edward Wignall, a member of the authority. Inquiries are
being conducted by Detective Superintendent Paul O'Nion and an appeal for
witnesses has been launched.''
As the rioting took place, a group of around 50 youths armed with baseball bats
arrived in Ferndale Road, where no police were present, and smashed the windows
of an Adidas sports shop.
They ripped metal barriers from the windows and smashed their way into the
store, grabbing armloads of expensive trainers, sweatshirts and sports gear.
The looting went on for around 15 minutes as frenzied youths made repeated
raids on the shop, running off with goods to a house nearby.
Two women passers-by were mugged and one was wrestled to the ground in the
frenzy which lasted about 15 minutes.
A squad of riot police arrived just as the last looters left the scene and
grabbed one white youth.
Police grabbed the youth as he left the shop with a box of trainers under his
arm.
Five officers pulled him to the ground and beat him with batons. He was
handcuffed and led away.
A police spokeswoman later said three police officers had been injured during
the scuffles and taken to hospital.
One, understood to be the motor cycle rider, has a broken shoulder, she said.
She said seven civilian casualties had been reported so far, and police were
still dealing with sporadic pockets of trouble in the area around Brixton town
centre.
She said there had been unconfirmed reports of petrol bombs being thrown and
gunshots being fired.
Asked about the presence of police in riot gear from the beginning of the
demonstration, she said: ``Officers were wearing protective clothing because we
had reports of missiles being thrown.''
She could not say how exactly the trouble flared, but added: ``We gave them
every opportunity to move off peacefully but they hadn't done so.''
One eye witness said he saw the officer pulled from his motor cycle after
hearing a group of youths saying ``let's get him''.
``There were about 10 or 15 of them and he was stranded on his own after the
units pulled out,'' said the witness, who asked not to be named.
The blackened motor cycle was later towed away by an armoured police vehicle.
By midnight, with dozens of cars ablaze and several hundred riot police
flooding into the area, the violence had spread from the initial flashpoint on
Brixton Road.
Pockets of trouble flared in numerous different streets with youths attempting
to smash shop windows and set fire to more cars and business premises.
The Scotland Yard spokesman said: ``It does not seem to be worsening at the
moment although there are still a lot of people on the streets.''

THE former wife of the fourth Lord Rowallan has been granted interim interdict
preventing her former husband from molesting her. The civil case follows an
incident at an equestrian centre in November after which Lord Rowallan was
charged with assault and a report submitted to the procurator-fiscal.
Legal advisers for Lord Rowallan are preparing to defend the action and Glasgow
solicitor Paul Burns said: ``My client denies all the allegations made in the
initial writ and we will be defending the action with all vigour.''
He added: ``It is quite normal procedure for a sheriff to grant interim
interdict in cases like this without hearing all the evidence and submissions
and I would stress that no inference should be drawn from it.''
The alleged assault took place at Muirmill Equestrian Centre, where Lord
Rowallan and his present wife were watching her 19-year-old daughter Sophie
participate in a showjumping event. His former wife Sandrew Philomena Corbett,
who lives in the village, also was at the event.
Sophie was badly injured when she was thrown from a horse which subsequently
fell back and crushed her. She sustained fractures to her hips and legs.
In the initial writ lodged at Ayr Sheriff Court, it is alleged that Lord
Rowallan struck Mrs Corbett on the head and knocked her unconscious.
The writ states: ``At 5.30pm on November 12, the pursuer (Mrs Corbett) was
standing outside the arena area speaking to some friends.
``The defender (Lord Rowallan) walked to the pursuer and struck the pursuer on
the back of the head. The pursuer was knocked unconscious and fell to the
ground.''

TRAVELLERS on the sleeper from the Highlands to London were treated to a bite
to eat yesterday by millionaire Peter de Savary.
The flamboyant owner of the Carnegie Club in Sutherland boarded the train and
produced a banquet on fine china from an elegant Edwardian wicker    hamper.
Mr de Savary, his personal assistant, Ms Alyson Thompson, and several other
hungry passengers on the 8.30pm overnight train from Inverness to Euston were
served with Scottish smoked salmon, pate, dips, cheese, and biscuits, all
washed down with champagne.
It was the second time the former America's Cup yachtsman had found himself in
charge of the catering on the sleeper.
Last month, British Rail staff refused to serve food on the #95 service because
the head porter had taken ill. Mr de Savary sneaked into the closed buffet car
and dished out snacks and drinks, leaving cash in the till to meet the bill.
At that time, ScotRail described him as ``impatient'' and said he was ``out of
order''.
Yesterday, he said: ``After all the trouble on the last occasion I decided to
be safe and bring along a little snack for myself and anyone else who wanted to
join me.
``Generally speaking, the sleeper service is wonderful but, occasionally,
things do go wrong, so it is important to take precautions.''
Normally, the official menu during the 12-hour journey includes soup, melon,
beef stew, Thai-style vegetables, and cheesecake.
A ScotRail spokesman said: ``Mr de Savary is a valued customer who was entitled
to feel upset at the unfortunate mix-up on his last trip.
``He was making a point, and we can see the funny side of that, but I do not
think he would be very pleased if one of his guests turned up at Skibo Castle
with a carry-out.''
Mr de Savary's Carnegie Club, at Skibo Castle, is set in 7500 acres on the
shores of the Dornoch Firth.
It opened in April after a #17m refurbishment and already more than 200 of the
world's rich and famous have paid the #2000 a year fees.
The castle was rebuilt early this century by the Fife-born American steel
magnate, Andrew Carnegie, who called it his ``heaven on earth''.

LABOUR yesterday demanded a Government inquiry into the case of a 10-year-old
boy who died after he was moved between four hospitals after collapsing at home.
Nicholas Geldard was moved between three hospitals in Greater Manchester before
being driven 45 miles through a snowstorm to a fourth hospital in Leeds.
By the time a scan confirmed he had a brain haemorrhage, doctors were unable to
save him.
Nicholas, from Offerton, Stockport, collapsed at his home last Thursday and was
taken by ambulance to Stockport Infirmary.
His mother, Mrs Cath Geldard, said it took 20 minutes for an ambulance to
arrive. At the hospital, Nicholas was seen by a nurse, but not a doctor, she
claimed.
Mrs Geldard said a decision was taken to give Nicholas a scan at another local
hospital, Stepping Hill.
However, the ambulance transfer took an hour - making Nicholas too late for the
scan. The scanner at Stepping Hill operates only between 9am and 5pm and by the
time he got there the unit was closed.
Doctors decided to carry out the scan next day but when the boy's condition
deteriorated it became clear they could not wait.
Eventually, he was given a scan at Hope Hospital which confirmed that a slow
bleed was putting pressure on his brain.
An operation was vital but there were no paediatric intensive care beds
available.
The only bed that could be found was at Leeds General, 45 miles away. By the
time Nicholas reached the hospital, after an ambulance drive through a
snowstorm, he was dead.
Mrs Geldard said: ``We are very, very angry. You put your life in the hands of
the health service yet Nicholas was fatally let down.
``This shouldn't happen ever again. It was a nightmare.''
Nicholas's funeral will take place in Offerton tomorrow.
Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Harriet Harman said yesterday: ``This is an
absolutely ghastly case. It's clear that the resources Nicholas needed to give
him a fighting chance of living were not there for him.
``By the time he got to Leeds, it was too late. I will be asking the Secretary
of State to set up a full Department of Health inquiry, because you can't look
at something like this involving four hospitals on a local basis.''
Her remarks were echoed by Stockport MP Ann Coffey, who took up the case after
speaking to the family.
``There are two serious issues here. One is why a very expensive scanner paid
for by public subscription is not available after 5pm, and the second is the
unavailability of intensive care beds.
``In the north-west, we have some very fine hospitals, very fine doctors, and
very good facilities. But if because of the way the internal market operates
you can't use these facilities, it raises questions about planning and the use
of resources.
``I want this to be investigated at a very high level. It's not enough just to
look at each part of the jigsaw.''
Stockport Healthcare NHS Trust and Stockport Acute Services NHS Trust said in a
joint statement: ``This is a distressing set of circumstances in which every
effort was made by both trusts to avoid the ultimately tragic outcome. We offer
our deepest sympathy to the family of Nicholas Geldard.''
The trusts said a ``full inquiry'' would be held. Preliminary inquiries had
indicated that ``good clinical practice was observed at all times''.
The statement said it had to be remembered the boy's condition was not static
and for some time he appeared to be improving.
Shortly before midnight, his condition deteriorated suddenly and calls were
made to a number of hospitals in an effort to find an intensive care bed. The
first to become available was at Leeds General.
``By 12.40, a bed was secured at Leeds, conditional on a scan being carried out
before he could be admitted,'' said the statement.
The scan at Hope Hospital confirmed he had suffered a brain haemorrhage.
The statement went on: ``At all times Nicholas was under the care of Stockport
Healthcare NHS Trust, he was continually looked after by senior staff members
and indeed during his transfer to Hope Hospital, Manchester, and to Leeds
General, Nicholas was accompanied by a consultant anaesthetist, a paediatric
registrar, and a senior nurse from Stepping Hill.''

DOUNREAY's main reprocessing plant was closed down after an unplanned release
of radioactivity into the air on November 22, the same day as the ballot papers
in the referendum on reprocessing foreign reactor fuel were sent out to the
20,000 voters in Caithness.
The results of that referendum are expected today but yesterday management was
stressing that while the emission breached Dounreay's own self-imposed limits,
it was well with-in the legal limits laid down by the regulatory authorities.
No radioactivity had escaped into the workplace and the release from the
chimney had posed no risk.
A meeting of the Dounreay local liaison committee on November 28 was not told
of the the release and the subsequent shutdown. The first indication came in a
letter to last week's edition of the Orcadian newspaper from the Orkney-based
Campaign Against Dounreay Expansion. On Monday, Dounreay's director, Mr John
Baxter, sent an internal message to the workforce explaining the situation.
He wrote: ``There has been some media interest in the temporary shutdown of
D1208 waste plant and D1206 reprocessing plant. I therefore wanted you to be
aware of the facts, which are: the on-line monitoring system in the ventilation
stack activated on November 22. This was due to discharge levels being above
our self-imposed, and very conservative, daily limit.
``Our discharges usually average about 10% of the authorisation which we are
fully entitled to utilise. The discharge involved an insignificant release of
radioactivity which was well within our discharge authorisation. There was
therefore no increased hazard to either site personnel or the public. In order
to investigate the circumstances, D1208 was shut down and D1206 operations were
stopped as a consequence of this.''
Remedial work was proceeding and although the incident was not one which
Dounreay had been required to report to its regulatory bodies, they had been
kept informed of the situation, Mr Baxter said.
Dounreay spokesman Ian Shepherd told The Herald yesterday that the incident had
not been reported to the local liaison committee because it had been very
minor. There had been no intention to conceal anything.
The reprocessing plant involved in the incident is currently in the middle of a
three-year programme reprocessing fuel from the Prototype Fast Reactor as part
of decommissioning work. It would not be involved in the controversial
contracts to reprocess spent fuel of American origin from 33 research reactors
across Europe. If the US Government approves the proposal and if the HM
Industrial Pollution Inspectorate approves the plant's proposed discharge
levels in the new year, the work would take place in the Materials Testing
Reactor D1204.
Anti-nuclear activists yesterday, however, were anxious to link this incident
to the foreign reprocessing contracts and the referendum. Mr Kevin Dunion,
director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: ``It is true this incident
took place in the PFR reprocessing plant but it should be remembered the MTR is
considerably older.
``It would appear that Dounreay did not want information about this incident to
be published during the referendum. But it is of concern that Dounreay can pick
and choose which incidents it publishes. This may be consistent with the
absence of any proper public consultation on the plant's activities but it
undermines the Scottish people's democratic right to know what is happening
there.''

``WILL it be the Mace next and the despatch boxes?'' enquired Mr Dennis Skinner
(Bolsover - Lab). There was not, as he also remarked, a lot of the family
silver left.
The remarkably smooth Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr Roger Freeman,
who resembles one of those chaps who used to appear in Brylcream hair-oil
adverts, had just announced another privatisation. Her Majesty's Stationery
Office was to go under the hammer, and Mr Freeman was encountering some
difficulties because this excellent organisation prints parliamentay and
Government publications with great efficiency.
``I want a guarantee,'' demanded Mr Skinner, ``that the contract will not go to
Haymarket Press, your gaffer's firm.''
Mr Freeman, though he has a splendid title himself, is merely deputy to the
imperial Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Michael Heseltine, whose wealth was founded
on publishing ventures.
Mr Skinner also wanted a guarantee against Mr Rupert Murdoch and, had time
permitted, probably could have added extensively to the list of media barons of
whom he disapproves.
There was, though, a faintly elegiac note in his denunciation. We seemed to be
nearly at the end of a long road. The Government had privatised almost
everything and Mr Skinner had denounced each step along the route. He has to
hold something in reserve in case it managed to privatise the NHS before
demitting office. It had sold off #80bn worth of public assets, Dennis mused,
and much good it was doing it.
Mr Derek Foster, emerging from years of Trappist silence as Opposition Chief
Whip, eloquently described Mr Freemam as ``an honest man fallen among thieves.''
This was a remark difficult to reply to either as a compliment or a criticism,
and Mr Freeman did not try.
A reasonable number of Tory MPs sang the praises of the private sector, but Mr
Patrick Cormack (Stafford South - Con.), a Westminster buff who has written
books about the place, said that he and others on the Government back benches
were ``not necessarily excited'' about this development.
With a majority of five and falling, even mild criticism must set ministerial
alarm bells ringing. Labour MPs, viewing the Government's activities with the
habitual suspicion of Oppositions, expressed their own alarm at Mr Freeman's
unwillingness to say that the Commons would have a free vote on the proposal -
this being not just any old privatisation but one that could affect the speed
with which they are served up the multitude of papers that facilitate, or at
any rate record, their work.
As a House of Commons matter, this privatisation would seem to be suitable for
a free vote but ``that is not a matter for me,'' said Mr Freeman. Technically,
he was right but, if the Governmment had decided to give democracy its head,
the Chief Whip would doubtless not have minded him passing on the good news.
Although a capable performer, the Minister was unable to dismiss the charge
that ideology was behind the move. A Labour MP suggested that the HMSO should
be allowed to borrow on the market and widen its commercial activities while
remaining in the public sector.
Mr Freeman replied that this Govermment could not and would not countenance a
public body subsidised by taxpayers' money competing with the private sector.
MPs will be given a chance to debate the matter at more length next week. The
Government has settled on Wednesday, the last sitting day before Christmas when
many Members may feel more inclined to head for the Yuletide fireplaces of home
than stay and try to dishevel the immaculate Mr Freeman.

Student wins
court victory
STUDENT Ade Onibiyo yesterday won permission to bring an urgent challenge at
the High Court in London against the Home Secretary's decision to deport him
to
Nigeria.
Lawyers for the 19-year-old said, as a member of a family of prominent
pro-democracy activists opposed to the Nigerian regime, he would be in
imminent
danger if he was sent back. His father, Abdul, 53, was deported seven weeks
ago and has not been seen or heard of since.
Dentists' protest
THE protest by senior dentists at Glasgow Dental Hospital was discussed
officially by the hospital trust board yesterday for the first time. They were
shown a letter from the Dental Division, representing about 50 consultant
dentists and other senior staff, intimating that they had passed a vote of no
confidence in the trust's chief executive, Dr Doreen Steele, because of what
they describe as a confrontational management style.
Pupil fined
A 16-YEAR-OLD who is studying for four Highers at Larbert High School in
Stirlingshire was fined #200 yesterday for having a flick-knife with a 5in
blade. Falkirk Sheriff Court heard that police were called to a petrol station
by staff, searched Stephen Connacher, of Larbert, and found the weapon.
Bridge plunge
AN outside pursuits instructor is recovering in Stirling Royal Infirmary after
breaking his legs in a fall from Dochart Bridge, Killin, Perthshire. Mr Ian
Mackinnon, 23, of Ardtullaich, Ardeonaig, near Loch Tay, is described as
``comfortable'' after the accident on Friday. He is the son of singer Mary
Sandeman.
College fire
A FIRE caused #500,000 damage at Kilmarnock College yesterday. Fourteen
classrooms were destroyed. Principal James Flynn said: ``We do not know what
caused the blaze but there is nothing to suggest that it was started
deliberately. About 1500 pupils were evacuated safely.'' Police inquiries are
continuing.
Pringle vote
PRINGLE of Scotland knitwear workers yesterday rejected overwhelmingly the
firm's refusal to concede any part of a pay and conditions package submitted
last week. The GMB union announced that a ballot of employees in Hawick,
Galashiels, and Berwick produced 710 against the firm's stance, and 352
accepting a pay freeze. The union has sought a 5% pay rise, a minimum #4 an
hour for lower paid workers, and an extra day's holiday.
Green for gone
TWO sets of temporary traffic lights worth more than #3000 have been stolen
from road works on the A68 at Drygrange and Earlston in the Borders.
Jobs cut
NINETEEN of the 32 employees at Gleneagles Spring Water Company Limited, near
Blackford, Perthshire, will be made redundant next month.
Hospital plan
A #30m expansion at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, has been given the go-ahead by
the Scottish Office.

UNISON yesterday launched a campaign against Pall Mall, an NHS contractor with
which it is in dispute at hospitals in East Kilbride, Middlesex, and Essex.
Advertisements will be placed in the national and trade press drawing attention
to the company's alleged record of refusing to abide by the TUPE transfer of
undertaking regulations, especially at Hillingdon Hospital in Middlesex, where
56 staff have been sacked for refusing to accept pay cuts averaging between #25
and #35 a week.
Many of those sacked were Asian women. Some had worked at the hospital for
nearly 30 years.
Porters at Hairmyres Hospital, East Kilbride, are holding a strike ballot, the
result of which should be known a week today, over non-payment of back pay and
a refusal to recognise the union.
The union has also published a report called Pall Mall: The Unacceptable Face
of Contracting, detailing the company's alleged record in the NHS. This will be
used to brief MPs, the NHS executive, the Commission for Racial Equality, and
the Private Contractors Association.
Unison's head of health, Mr Bob Abberley, said Hillingdon and Hairmyres were
just two of the places where Pall Mall had attempted to impose pay cuts soon
after winning contracts, hitting some of the lowest paid workers in Britain.
``We want the NHS itself and other contractors to say publicly that such
treatment of staff is unacceptable - and for Pall Mall to realise that their
commercial future will be affected if they refuse to change their ways,'' he
said.
Pall Mall's managing director, Mr Robin Oakley Smith, maintained that his
company was recognised throughout the NHS as an excellent employer. He denied
that there was a dispute at Hillingdon, where everything was operating
``absolutely normally''.
The vast majority of staff had signed new contracts ``at a very competitive
local rate of pay of #3.58 an hour''.
Unison said the 56 dismissed staff were taking their cases to an industrial
tribunal.

Tartan brain
drain warning
A TAX-RAISING Scottish Parliament with no firm commitment to business and
industry could produce a tartan brain drain and drive away foreign investors, a
senior Scottish industrialist warned yesterday.
Increasing taxes by even 3p in the pound would lead to increased wage demands
and higher costs, forcing the high fliers in the engineering and electronics
fields to move abroad, according to Mr Howard Jordan, chief executive of
Scottish Engineering.
Nolan hearings
THE committee on standards in public life, the Nolan Committee, is to hold
public hearings in Edinburgh next month as part of the its study into local
public spending bodies.
Economic key
CRIEFF'S local economy would be boosted by more than #9m a year if 500 houses
were built, Perth and Kinross District Council was told. A report by
Scott-Moncrieff Ltd identifies lack of housing as a key factor in stopping the
town's growth.
Assault on baby
A FATHER who wrenched his four-and-a-half-month old son's arm so badly that it
broke was sentenced to three years' probation at Edinburgh Sheriff Court
yesterday. The 21-year-old chef had earlier admitted assaulting the boy in a
house in Dalkeith, Midlothian.
Armed robbery
POLICE are hunting two masked men who held up a finance office in Dumbarton
High Street at knifepoint on Tuesday.
Theft charge
A MAN has appeared in court charged with a robbery at a nursing home. Mr Owen
McGreevy, 30, of Wauchope Square, Edinburgh, appeared in private at Edinburgh
Sheriff Court yesterday.
Fire inquiry
POLICE were yesterday investigating a blaze in Rosie O'Grady's bar in Princes
Street, Falkirk. Part of the town was sealed off after residents reported an
explosion.
Turkey warning
TRADING standards officers are worried that new metric food weight labels may
lead to undercooked turkeys being served up, increasing the risk of food
poisoning. Turkey should be cooked for 44 minutes per kilo.
Road death
A 60-YEAR-OLD man has died after being knocked down in Crookston Road, Glasgow
yesterday. Mr Hugh Connaghan, of Cairnhill Circus, Crookston, died at Southern
General Hospital.

Beijing
WEI JINGSHENG, China's boldest advocate of democracy and human rights, was
convicted today of trying to overthrow the government and sentenced to 14 more
years in prison.
The Beijing Intermediate Court found the Nobel Peace Prize nominee guilty of
sedition for organising art exhibitions and writing articles criticising the
communist government.
Wei, 45, was first sent to jail in 1979 for his writing. He was released in
1993 and immediately resumed working to draw international attention to China's
human rights record.
He disappeared into police custody in April last year and was held for 20
months without charges. Today's trial and sentencing took less than five hours.
The sentence is the harshest blow yet to China's tiny dissident community, and
brought immediate condemnation by Western governments and Wei's relatives.
``This is an outrage,'' said his sister, Shanshan. ``There is no factual basis
for such a verdict.
``The Chinese Government is shameless. They operate like an organised crime
group that pays no attention to the law.''
She was speaking in Washington, where she is lobbying the US Government to
increase its human rights pressure on China.
At a news conference with several members of Congress, Shanshan said her
brother was not the only one affected.
``It is also a question of defending thousands of dissidents in China, and
fundamental rights of freedom of expression of over one billion Chinese
people,'' she said.
Although human rights groups have championed Wei's cause and called for his
release, not one Western government has threatened China with economic
reprisals to gain fair treatment for him since he was detained 20 months ago.
The Foreign Office expressed ``dismay and concern'' at the sentence, saying Wei
had been harshly treated and that it would make its views known to the Chinese
authorities.
The human rights group Amnesty International called Wei's trial ``a mockery of
justice''. France, Germany, and the US joined in condemning the sentence.
In Hong Kong, pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong waved large pictures of Wei
outside China's representative office in the British colony.
Some residents said Wei's fate added to worries about their future after Hong
Kong is handed back to China in 1997.
Wei's brother, Xiaotao, said he believed Wei would appeal, but most appeals in
China are rejected.
Foreign reporters and diplomats were barred from the court building today by
scores of police who patrolled the perimeter in heavy fog and snow.
Wei Xiaotao and another sister were the only family members allowed into the
courtroom. It was the first time Wei's family has seen him since he was
detained.
Their concern about his health was heightened when Wei told the judge he felt
ill and the court took a 30-minute recess.
Shansan said she feared Wei might not survive his sentence because he has
serious heart problems and high blood pressure.
It will be Wei's second stint in jail. He was sentenced to a 15-year term in
1979 after writing powerful essays warning that China's attempts at economic
development would be meaningless without democracy and human rights.
Wei is not the first of the activists from the 1978-                79
Democracy Wall movement to be given a second jail       term.
His associate, Ren Wanding, is serving a seven-year term for making
pro-democracy speeches during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.-AP/Reuter.

Brussels
EURO-MPs yesterday voted to approve a money-spinning Customs union between the
European Union and Turkey, but only on condition that Ankara improves its
record on human rights.
After years of negotiations, the EU breathed a sigh of relief after the
Strasbourg legislature gave reluctant consent to a deal dogged by complaints
that the Turks are too undemocratic and intolerant of dissent, especially with
the Kurds.
MEPs of both main groupings, the Socialists and centre-right Christian
Democrats, insisted on strings to ensure that the pact was accompanied by
Turkish efforts to respect individual and minority rights.
Socialists' leader Mrs Pauline Green said they would vote in favour, but
without enthusiasm.
``Those of us who vote in favour do so not because we believe that present
conditions in Turkey make her an appropriate partner whose democracy has stood
the test of time,'' she said, arguing that a No vote would have harmed people
in Turkey who were fighting the cause of democracy.
Mrs Green urged Ankara to co-operate on Cyprus now that the island is in line
for EU membership, and to resolve the Kurdish problem by means of a settlement
recognising the rights of minorities to their own language, culture, and
traditions.
British Tory MEPs voted with the Christian Democrat-led European People's Party
in favour of the deal, but joined the Socialists in demanding safeguards for
human rights.
The vote was 343 in favour to 149, with 36 abstentions.
EU External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek said the deal would
benefit both the EU and Turkey economically. ``It's quite easy to see that if
you remove all the tariff and non-tariff barriers to exports, that will lead to
a great increase of trade in Turkey,'' he said.

ANOTHER teachers' union has expressed doubts about whether the 1998 target for
implementing the Higher Still reform of upper secondary schooling can be met.
The Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association has agreed to co-operate with the
development programme, but now says its members' involvement will depend on
their continued concerns being answered.
These include resources for staff, how courses are to be assessed, and worries
about taking classes with pupils at different levels. The union also wanted
clarification about the production of course and shorter unit materials.
The Educational Institute of Scotland will continue its boycott of Higher Still
after concluding that the timescale for implementation was unrealistic because
of unsufficient resources.

THERE are no educational or financial grounds for Dornoch Academy - Scotland's
first opted out school - being allowed to upgrade from its present two years to
full six year secondary status, Highland Regional Council's education committee
resolved unanimously yesterday.
The committee had been asked to comment on the current application by Dornoch
to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth for permission to begin progressive
upgrading by adding a third year in May. It backed a report from director of
education Mr Allan Gilchrist opposing the application.
Highland Regional Council is billed monthly for the money the Scottish Office
pays to Dornoch Academy in annual recurrent grant. In the financial year to
March 1995, the grant totalled #387,367. Mr Gilchrist's report concluded that
if the 49 pupils currently attending Dornoch Academy were sent to the council
run Golpsie High School or Tain Royal Academy, it would save the council over
#310,000.
Mr Gilchrist recalled Mr Forsyth's own comments during the debate on the Self
Governing Schools Bill when, as Education Minister, he talked of how the
Secretary of State would consider an application to change a school's
characteristics.
Mr Forsyth had said: ``If one factor is that the school has only been
self-governing for, say, two years, that will certainly weigh with him. Indeed,
he will generally regard that as a very strong argument against making any
further substantial change in the school for the time being.''
Meanwhile, Highland Council is facing the prospect of having to close 28
schools as financial shortages and the demands of a Government finance watchdog
start to take effect.

DOCTOR Cherie Martin has helped thousands of women confront their own fatness,
and stop dieting. For this South African born doctor, now based in Glasgow,
launched Weigh Ahead, a revoluntionary new concept in weight control, writes
Ann Shaw.
Her message is simple: Forget diets - they don't work. Listen to your body.
Find out why you over-eat.
Now she has just written a book, Naturally Slim (Transworld Publishers, #6.99).
Dr Martin tells how she went on her first diet as a 12-year-old when she
weighed 11 stones; she knows from bitter experience that dieting doesn't work.
A victim of the diet/binge cycle, she was in her final year in medical school
and browsing through her local bookshop one afternoon when she came across a
book that was to transform her life. It was called Diets Don't Work by Bob
Schwartz.
``I got outraged as I read about the multi-million-dollar diet industry that
would like to keep us dieting. I was amazed to read that only two out of every
hundred people are successful at dieting.''
She read that 13 years after she began her first diet.
``I wept as I realised it was not my fault. The years of eating misery had
started because when I went on that first diet, I had started down a road which
would lead me further and further away from what I really wanted. While
searching for freedom from my food and weight obsession, I was constantly on a
diet and this only caused an increase in my food and weight obsession. A sense
of relief poured over me, as I read the book. Suddenly, I saw that there was a
way out at last.''
She believes you've got to confront the reasons why you over-eat: is it
loneliness, boredom, stress, or fatigue? Only when you've uncovered the key
factors to your own unhealthy eating patterns and confronted them will you
begin to change your lifestyle. You've got to learn to eat like a naturally
slim person, and that's to eat when you are hungry.
In Naturally Slim, Dr Martin reveals how she stopped dieting, lost 70 pounds,
and, more importantly, her obession with dieting.
A trained therapist, she helps you to discover the links between your eating
and your emotions. For those who are serious about their excess flab this book
makes an excellent start to the New Year.
AND here's more good news for those who were worried about the need to diet for
Christmas. It really is a waste of time. Heresy? No, says Dr Richard Cottrell,
editor of Weight Control, a collection of papers on obesity written by leading
medical experts.
``It's impossible to overeat in two or three days and put on weight. Say you
normally eat 2000 calories and you double it over Christmas. The amount of
weight gain would be too small for you to notice.''
But what if you over-indulge for two or three weeks? He admits then you will
put on a few pounds, but emphasises that's not the real problem.
``It's steadily over-eating, day after day. That's what puts on all those extra
pounds which turn into stones over the years.''

<HEADLINE>Jury to hear fresh evidence of personality disorder and battered woman syndrome Wife who killed wins retrial</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

A WOMAN, who became the focus of a campaign demanding justice for battered
women driven to kill, yesterday won the right to a retrial after her original
conviction of murdering her violent, drunken husband was quashed.
Mrs Sara Thornton, who served six years of a life sentence before being
released on bail last July, will remain free pending the retrial at Birmingham
in the new year.
The Court of Appeal held fresh medical evidence, showing Mrs Thornton had a
personality disorder and suffered from battered woman syndrome, should be
considered by a jury to determine whether she suddenly lost her self-control at
the time of the killing.
Her lawyers had asked the appeal judges not to order a retrial but to reduce
her murder conviction to manslaughter through provocation. They argued the
evidence showed she was an abused woman at the end of her tether when she
suddenly snapped, plunging a kitchen knife into ex-policeman Mr Malcolm
Thornton as he lay drunk on a sofa.
But Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, sitting with Mr Justice Hidden and Mrs
Justice Ebsworth, said: ``We are firmly of the view that the question of
whether the appellant did lose or may have lost her self-control at the time of
this killing is essentially a matter for a jury to decide. It is not for us.''
He said that, despite lawyers' objections that the ordeal of a retrial would
not be fair and would be impracticable because of press coverage, the public
interest required the issue to be determined. The court was confident that a
fresh jury ``will be able fairly to try the case solely on the evidence they
hear''.
Mrs Thornton, 38, of Atherstone, Warks, was jailed for life at Birmingham Crown
Court in February 1990. Her original appeal was rejected in 1991. It was that
appeal which led to changes in the way courts apply the law on provocation and
several other women convicted of domestic murder have since been freed as a
result.
Mrs Thornton was bailed in July following Home Secretary Michael Howard's
decision to refer her case back to the Court of Appeal.
Mrs Thornton had denied threatening to kill her husband on occasions before the
fatal day - June 13, 1989. She told police she only intended to frighten her
husband with the knife. At her trial, she said the stabbing was an accident.
Mrs Thornton's trial defence was diminished responsibility, not provocation,
although that issue was left to the jury.
At Mrs Thornton's first appeal, the court rejected argument that the law was
too rigid in insisting that, for the defence of provocation to succeed, it had
to be shown that the provocative words or conduct caused ``a sudden and
temporary loss of self control''.
Lord Taylor reaffirmed the principle and said even someone suffering from
battered woman syndrome could not rely on provocation unless there was sudden
loss of self-control at the time of the killing.
``We conclude that the fresh evidence and the clarification of the law cast
doubt upon the basis of the jury's verdict in this case. We cannot therefore be
sure the verdict is safe and satisfactory,'' said Lord Taylor.
The judges quashed the conviction, ordered Mrs Thornton to be recharged within
two months, and said the retrial should take place as early in the new year as
possible.
After being released on bail, Mrs Thornton left the Law Courts in central
London without making any comment.

PLANS to protect 116 of the UK's most threatened and declining species were
welcomed by Green campaigners yesterday.
Conservationists, however, warned the Scottish Office that it would have to
give the report its full support, especially in the light of its cut of #5m
this week to the budget of Scottish Natural Heritage.
A spokeswoman at St Andrew's House pointed out that, while SNH had suffered a
10% cut in its budget, the Scottish Office itself had had its budget cut by 12%.
The Joint Study Report on SNH, announced yesterday, had found that the agency
was able to make ``substantial efficiency savings without in any way affecting
its work'', she added. The proposals by the UK Steering Group Report on
Bio-diversity would cost more than #9m to protect species, along with a further
#73m spent on their habitats by 2010.
Some of the indigenous Scottish species targeted by the report include the
corncrake and capercailzie. The report is also concerned about the song thrush
and the skylark which, while not in danger of extinction, have had their
populations cut by 50% in the last 25 years, largely because of the change in
land use.
The group's report also identifies 14 key habitats which now require action to
protect them, from native pinewoods and hedgerows to limestone pavements and
coastal lagoons.
One aim is to ensure the return of the otter to almost every county in Britain
by 2010.

A WOMAN feared she would lose her job after her affair with her married boss
ended.
An industrial tribunal heard that Mrs Jennifer McMillan had an affair with boss
Mike Dale and a colleague had been axed a year earlier when her affair with the
same man ended.
Mrs McMillan, 25, claimed she was forced to quit her #17,000-a-year job as
senior supervisor as she was effectively demoted when she went back to work at
Saztec Europe Ltd's Ardrossan plant after her affair with Mr Dale ended, the
Glasgow tribunal heard.
Mrs McMillan met former colleague Ruth Donnachie and discovered Mr Dale had
been trying to win her back. She said that explained events at work.
The tribunal heard that Mrs McMillan had been given a company car, the one
formerly used by Ms Ruth Donnachie, but she lost the use of it when she was off
sick.
She also claimed she was threatened with a pay cut and given a menial task to
do when she started back with no responsibility for any staff. She had
previously been supervising almost 50.
The company said she was given a highly technical job to do on her return, her
pay wasn't cut, and she still had the title of senior supervisor. It was Mrs
McMillan who offered to return her car while off sick, which was for pool use
during office hours.
Mrs McMillan's father, Mr Peter Monaghan, who represented her at the tribunal,
said Mr Dale's relationship with Ms Donnachie ended in bitterness when he
discovered she was seeing a younger man, her sister was sacked shortly
afterwards, and she was made redundant on May 13 last year.
Mr Monaghan said Mr Dale had told the tribunal the two affairs were ``howling
mistakes''. Mr Monaghan said: ``It raises questions of his abuse of power
within the company. Certainly it appears that the careers of three females were
ruined because of his behaviour.
``Mr Dale abused his power and used general manager Mrs Ann Barlow to squeeze
Jenny out of Saztec as excess baggage. As a result, she resigned from her job.''
Solicitor Martin Stephen, for the company, said Mrs McMillan was a willing
participant in the affair.
Mr Dale had admitted he still had feelings for Ms Donnachie but said she was
made redundant for genuine reasons and he played no part in the dismissal of
her sister. He denied any involvement in the alleged change in Mrs Barlow's
attitude to Mrs McMillan.
The tribunal will issue its written decision later.

MR IAN Campbell, the former convener of Highland Regional Council, died at his
home on Skye last week at the age of 75. He had suffered from motor neurone
disease.
Mr Campbell had represented Skye in local government for more than 25 years,
first on Inverness County Council and then on Highland Regional Council. He was
elected to represent North and West Skye on the regional council at
reorganisation in 1974 and quickly became chairman of its roads and transport
committee.
He was elected convener at the beginning of the second council in 1978 and
again in 1982. He held the position until 1986 and was subsequently awarded the
OBE for his services to local government. He bowed out of the council in 1990.
Mr Campbell received part of his education at Inverness Royal Academy and went
on to graduate from Edinburgh University. During the war he served as a captain
in the Royal Army Service Corps before going home to run the family hotel at
Sligachan, its land, and other business interests.
On hearing of Mr Campbell's death, Duncan McPherson, the present convener of
Highland Regional Council said: ``Ian was a good friend and colleague for more
than 20 years. He was a real statesman and was so well thought of that he was
elected to serve for two terms as convener of the regional council. During his
time, he offered clear leadership and sound guidance to the authority. He was a
great ambassador for the Highlands.''
Mr Campbell is survived by his wife Fiona, two sons, Alan and Ian, and his
daughter Catriona.

Dr Hector MacLean MC; born September 30, 1912, died December 6, 1995
THE people of the Small Isles of Eigg, Muck, Rum and Canna buried Dr Hector
MacLean last week at the age of 83. A loved and respected figure, he had served
as their general practitioner for 39 years but had spent the last five and a
half years in retirement on Eigg, the island whose embrace he never sought to
leave.
Dr MacLean had come to the practice in 1952 and did not retire until April 1,
1990 when he had reached the age of 77. He had postponed his retiral in an
attempt to secure a guarantee that his successor would also be based in the
islands rather than on the mainland working out of a health centre in Mallaig
as had been suggested by Highland Health Board. One scheme had been for a
doctor from the mainland health centre to visit once a month by helicopter.
A test of wills ensued after the health board made clear they would not take
steps to replace him until he announced his retirement. These were the rules.
It was a Catch 22 situation but Hector MacLean was not to give up easily,
despite coming under enormous pressure from the authorities. His determination
was fuelled by a deep concern for the island families he had served for nearly
four decades in what remains one of the most isolated and difficult of
practices. ``Better an old doctor, than no doctor,'' he believed.
At the end of December 1988 he explained at greater length: ``I just cannot see
how adequate primary care can be delivered to these islands from the mainland.
The islanders can be singularly uncommunicative by telephone, and although I
have spent 37 years trying to educate them to use the doctor based here on the
Small Isles, I have failed. If they are not going to trouble me, they are not
going to trouble a doctor on the mainland. One old lady recently dislocated her
shoulder, but it was two days before she decided to call.''
Although the board agreed after he had announced his retirement that a
replacement did not have to be based in the islands, failure to establish the
health centre meant that Dr MacLean got his way. After an interim period with a
locum, the present GP Dr Chris Tiarks arrived on Eigg to take over the Small
Isles practice 1991.
The MacLean side of Hector MacLean's family had Hebridean connections, but
Hector MacLean was raised    in Hamilton. He studied medicine at Glasgow
University, graduating in 1935. During the war he served in the North African
campaign where he was decorated for bravery, being awarded the Miltary Cross.
On ``demob'' he secured a hospital appointment in Dumfries but in 1952 he
headed to the islands for his last professional posting. He married and had
three sons.
Comprising four islands separated by open water, the practice carried enormous
physical difficulties. Even today the Small Isles is not served by a car ferry
and the doctor then as now could not rely on public transport. Lawrence
MacEwen, who along with his brother owns and farms the island of Muck,
remembers Dr Maclean's visits to the island:
``I would be 12 when he first came to Muck. He used to come by canoe and you
would see him walking up the shore with the canoe on his head, always carrying
a brown rucksack on his back and always wearing a kilt. It was quite a sight.
He would come about a dozen times a year and visit everybody on the island
whether they were sick or not. He was always talking about the weather. I think
that was his real interest. When we went over to Eigg he always seemed to be on
the pier either with his fishing rod or playing the pipes, welcoming people to
the island.''
Dr MacLean was also to become an outspoken critic of the controversial ``Laird
of Eigg'', Keith Schellenberg who took over ownership in the 1970s and only
sold out to the German artist Maruma this summer. Dr MacLean's departure at
least is lamented, as Angus MacKinnon, a native of Eigg made clear yesterday.
``I was away when he arrived first but I got to know him when I was at home on
holiday and he was tending my mother and my father. I came home in 1965 and he
was always about, often with his pipes, just part of the place. He was a sound
man, a man of great integrity; the wee man in the kilt.''

Yet another false sighting in Greece of abducted Ben Needham means one more
bitter disappointment for his family, but they will never give up the search,
reports Kirsty Scott
AT TIMES it must have seemed as if the torment could get no worse. Then there
would be another telephone call, another vague sighting of a small blond-haired
boy, and the trail would be picked up and followed before it ran cold, like all
the others before it.
When British toddler Ben Needham disappeared on the Greek island of Kos in July
1991, his family could never in their worst nightmares have thought they might
still be searching for him 4!s years on.
Yet, this week, they were involved in a fresh investigation after news that a
private investigator had found a boy he claimed to be Ben living with a group
of gipsies in northern Greece.
The blond-haired youngster apparently told the investigator that he was given
to the gipsies because his parents didn't want him. Police released the boy
yesterday after complaints by the gipsy family, and later establishing that he
was not Ben.
It had sounded promising, but so had many of the 180-odd other sightings and
reports which the Needhams have dealt with over the years and which have all
but destroyed this working-class Yorkshire family.
Ben was just 21 months old when he vanished from a remote farmhouse at
Herakles. He had been out of sight and out of earshot for only a few minutes
when the family realised something was wrong. A car had been seen on the
isolated track to the house and a group of gipsies were camping nearby.
Ben will now be six, and in the years since his disappearance, his
grandparents, Eddie and Christine Needham, have split up three times, and his
young mum, Kerry, has reportedly attempted suicide three times.
Speaking from Sheffield yesterday before the establishment of the gipsy boy's
identity, Kerry Needham had said she was keeping an open mind about the latest
sighting. In Kos, where Eddie Needham is ironically following up another
sighting of a similar youngster, he had told reporters: ``It would be the end
to everyone's nightmare if it was Ben.''
Yet while the discovery of Ben would end the agony of not knowing,
psychologists say the family would face a new series of problems.
Dr Malcolm Hill, director of Glasgow University's Centre for the Study of the
Child and Society, said Ben will almost certainly not recall his original
family.
``There would be major difficulties in adjustment. He would have identified
with his original family at 21 months, but the following years would have given
him a stronger identification with the new family. He might just have a very
hazy recollection of a previous life, but it is likely to be extremely hazy. He
will be identifying more than 95% with the new family.
``Presumably he will be speaking a different language. It's not likely to be a
very straightforward situation. It may well be the people he knows as his
parents would try to hang on to him and as far as he is concerned the original
family would be complete strangers trying to take him away. It's likely to be
very distressing and confusing.''
Dr Hill said the Needhams would need to reconcile the Ben they remember with a
different child. ``The family's problem would be their need to understand
what's happened to him. They will have retained this image of the child they
lost and they will be expecting a bigger version of that. He has been immersed
in a different family and a different culture and for the Needhams it would be
hard. How do they adjust their expectations?''
Dr David Warden, a senior lecturer in psychology at Strathclyde University,
believes any reunion would be harder for the parents than the child. Children,
he said, can often adjust to a new situation quickly and smoothly.
``The parents have gone through a continuing trauma for all these years and
they would bring a great deal of emotional baggage to any new situation, which
would convey itself to the child. They would just have to be very patient.''
Dr Hill believes that if Ben is ever returned the Needhams face a long, slow
process of healing before they become a complete family again.
``I think it would take a long time. He is going to have a lot of anger about
it. In a sense, he would have had two traumatic experiences. When he was
abducted he would have been very angry and upset about it; that's worked
through now in some way, but it will be buried within him. Being reunited with
his real family would be a double trauma.''
The Needhams insist that they prepared themselves for the fact that if they
ever find Ben he will be a different boy from the one they knew. They had also
prepared themselves to accept that this latest child was not Ben and that their
search would have to go on.
``You don't say hard luck, we can't find you,'' Christine Needham said
recently. ``You never give up, never - because he's our kiddy.''

Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk, LG, CBE, Lord Lieutenant of West Sussex; born
March 22, 1916, died December 10, 1995
THE Hon Lavinia Mary Strutt was born at Kingston Hall, Nottingham, the only
daughter of the 3rd Baron Belper. Her mother, the Hon Eva Bruce, was a daughter
of the 2nd Lord Aberdare, and six years after Lavinia's birth, having divorced
Lavinia's father, she married Lord Dalmeny, heir to the 5th Earl of Rosebery.
The duchess was therefore a half-sister of the 7th Earl of Rosebery, whose
Scottish home is Dalmeny House at South Queensferry, West Lothian.
The Strutt family had made their fortune in the Derby spinning business, and
the family title was earned through business acumen and political patronage.
Lavinia was educated at Abbotts Hill, Hertfordshire, where she developed a love
of sports, playing tennis at Wimbledon in later years, and rapidly becoming a
first-class horsewoman, winning point-to-points on her stepfather's horses.
In 1937, she married the 16th Duke of Norfolk, KG, GCVO, GBE, TD, PC, who was
responsible for the ceremonial arrangements for both the coronations of 1937
and 1953. At the first ceremony, prior to their marriage, the duchess was
recruited to hold the canopy over the Queen's head. For the rehearsals of 1953,
the duchess stood in for the young Queen Elizabeth.
The Duke and Duchess of Norfolk were married at Brompton Oratory, Knightsbridge
in 1937, shortly after the coronation. At the time, their union caused much
comment since she was Protestant and the Fitzalan-Howards of Norfolk ranked as
one of England's oldest Roman Catholic dynasties.
Throughout their marriage, however, they shared a common obsession with
breeding horses. In 1974, Ragstone won the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot, Moon
Madness won the St Leger at Doncaster in 1986, and Sheriff's Star won the
Coronation Cup at Epsom in 1989. Celtic Swing, not owned, but bred by the
duchess and trained by her daughter, Lady Herries, was unbeaten in top races
throughout the 1994 season, and earlier this year won the French Derby.
Following the birth of four daughters, it became apparent that there would be
no son to inherit Arundel Castle, the family's home near Chichester in Sussex.
Since the castle and dukedom would pass to another branch of the family on his
death, the 16th Duke decided to build a second home nearby. This Georgian-style
new house was named Arundel Park, and being much easier to live in that the
hill-top castle with its dark corridors and 150 rooms, was soon after occupied
by the family.
From 1959 until 1990, the duchess served as Lord Lieutenant of West Sussex, the
first woman to be appointed to such a post. In this role, she willingly
undertook up to 600 public engagements every year, at the same time becoming
actively supporting over 100 charitable organisations.
After the duke's death in 1975, she secured the survival of the family's
private cricket ground, modelled on the Oval, as a memorial to her husband. The
Arundel Castle Cricket Foundation has so far enabled more than 80,000 young
cricket enthusiasts with no home grounds to play the game. Indoor practice
sheds costing #500,000 have recently been donated by the philanthropist John
Paul Getty.
Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk was a formidable organiser with an ability to
charm. In 1990 the Queen created her a Lady Companion of the Garter, the first
non-royal woman to be thus honoured.
She is survived by her daughters. On the duke's death, Lady Anne
Fitzalan-Howard, in the Celtic tradition, inherited the fifteenth-century
Scottish Lordship of Herries of Terregles in her own right. In 1985 she married
Sir Colin Cowdrey CBE, the cricketer.
Lady Mary Mumford is a lady-in-waiting to HRH Princess Alexandra, Lady Ogilvy,
and Lady Sarah Clutton lives in Sussex. Lady Jane is married to Michael Ancram,
MP, Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, and heir to the 12th Marquis of
Lothian.

Arthur Mullard, comedian; born November 10, 1910, died December 11, 1995
THE Cockney comedy actor Arthur Mullard, who has died at 85, got a taste of the
big time in his sixties with the 1970s ITV sitcom Yus My Dear, in which he
starred with Queenie Watts. He loved the experience and rumbled: ``What d'you
fink of that then? After 30 years a bleedin' star is born. I always knew I'd
make it to the top one day and now it happens when I've reached the age of
retiring.''
In the course of his career he had been a ``feed'' for some of the great comic
talents - Eric Sykes, Tony hancock, Bennie Hill, Frankie Howerd, and Spike
Milligan - hosted the Midweek Show on BBC Radio 4, and growled his way through
50 years of showbusiness life. This year he was still working for radio
commercials advertising everything from TCP to beer. Typically he commented:
``My voice is aht on it's own.''
The former boxer with a face like a bashed turnip worked with the most talented
and proved he could star on his own too. Born on the Essex Road in north London
and brought up in Peabody Buildings, Islington, Mullard had been a soldier, a
boxer, and then returned to the army for the Second World War before he
discovered a talent for comedy.
In 1978 Arthur and comedienne Hylda Baker were in the pop charts with You're
the One that I Want, the craziest-ever cover version of the song made famous by
John Travolta and Olivia Newton John in the film Grease. The unlikely duo even
appeared on Top of the Pops.
Despite fame Arthur never left his council flat in Islington where he and his
wife Flo had brought up three children. She died from a drugs overdose in 1961
after suffering several serious illnesses including polio, meningitis, and
ulcers.
During his career Mullard appeared in more than 400 films. He was the voice of
Butch the dog in Walt Disney's remake of 101 Dalmatians. His last film
appearance was in Confessions of a Plumber's Mate with Robin Askwith. He was
also a regular on Celebrity Squares.
Around his home patch he was known as the ``Dook of Islington'' where his 6ft
2in bulk and that distinctive bruiser's face brought him respect. He was a
working man through and through. ``I took up boxing professionally. Makes you
something of a philosopher. You bash them and they bash you and what's it all
for?''

Patrick Brogan underlines the difficulty the US Army faces in rooting out
racists
ON Thursday, December 7, three white soldiers stationed at Fort Bragg, in
Fayetteville, North Carolina, spent an evening drinking together and then drove
to a black part of town looking for black people to harass. They met a young
couple walking home and shot them both dead.
The three are in the 82nd Airborne Division, one of the most famous units in
the American army, and their horrified commanders have discovered that they
were notorious Nazis and white supremacists, who loathed blacks and Jews and
never made any secret of their racist notions.
Last April, two recently retired soldiers blew up a federal office building in
Oklahoma City, killing 169 people. They were allegedly motivated chiefly by
detestation of the Government rather than by outright racism, but the two
strains in the American far-right movement are close enough together. The worry
is that racism and Nazism are much more common in the armed forces than anyone
suspected.
Just after the Second World War, President Harry Truman desegregated the US
armed forces. It was one of the key moments in the slow, agonising and still
incomplete integration of black Americans into the mainstream. There had been
black soldiers before then, but only in separate, all-black units, with white
officers. It was all rather like the old Indian Army. Black troops had done
well in combat in all the wars since the Civil War, but they were not allowed
to fight with, let alone live alongside, white Americans.
Since then, the armed forces have become the most thoroughly integrated sector
in the United States. There are many more blacks, proportionately, in the
services than in the general population, including many of the most ambitious
and better educated of them: the Army has long been a way for black boys from
the ghettoes to escape from poverty.
The most celebrated example is General Colin Powell, who was born in the Bronx
and joined the Army as a teenager. He rose through the ranks to be chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff and for a while was spoken of as the first black man
who might be elected President.
In fact, integration of the races was taken so much for granted that the main
effort for the past decade has been devoted to integrating women. All the
public difficulties the armed forces faced in coming to terms with late
twentieth-century standards concerned sexual harassment of women or women's
struggles to meet standards set for pilots or soldiers.
Now the Army, in particular, has to face the fact that despite all its apparent
racial harmony, it has Nazis, skinheads, and white supremacists in its midst.
Two of the soldiers arrested for shooting the black couple last week lived off
the base, in a rented trailer which police found to be decorated with a Nazi
flag and large numbers of racist pamphlets.
Reporters interviewing other soldiers at the base easily discovered that the
suspects were known for their racist views, and now the Army is launching a
general investigation into the prevalence of racism in the ranks. The likely
answer, perhaps inevitably, is that the Army reflects the general society.
There has been an increase of extreme racism in American society, and it has
been reflected in the armed forces.
It's not all white racism, either. A particularly nasty case of black racism
has just exploded in Harlem, where black demonstrators, including some very
prominent demagogues, inciting violence against a Jewish shopkeeper, so
inflamed one man that he attacked the place and burnt it to the ground,
shooting four people (including himself) and burning four others to death.
There does not seem to be any organised Nazi infiltration of the services, any
more than there was an anti-Government organisation behind the Oklahoma City
bombing, and that makes it all the more difficult to deal with. Racism can pop
up anywhere.
So far, investigators have discovered about a dozen men at Fort Bragg who are
racist extremists. That is not very many, but there may well be more - and it
needs very few to cause trouble.
It is not clear at all what the Army could do about soldiers it determines to
be racists, if they do not undermine good order and military discipline by
their actions or words. This is a problem facing all free societies: what to do
with people who reject the bases of that freedom before they take up arms
against it.

William Russell reports that Kenneth Clarke's small interest rate cut may not
change life as we know it, but it does seem to reflect the mood of the moment
INTEREST rates are down at last after two years, to their lowest level in
nearly 30 years. Can happy days be here again? The cut of 0.25% down to 6.5% is
the first since February 1994, and means the Chancellor is suddenly gambling
after a notably cautious Budget. Life is going to be wonderful again, we are
assured, though not like it was back then.
In 1966 a cheap car cost #500, a Rolls-Royce about #10,000, beer was under two
shillings a pint, a loaf of bread a shilling, and a packet of 20 cigarettes
about four shillings, while #8000 a year was a princely salary. Such happy days
will not be back.
But home loans will be cheaper, business confidence should soar, unemployment
may continue to fall, now the Chancellor has done the right thing at last. Or
has he?
He has not done exactly what Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England
wanted, but he seldom, if ever, does. Mr Clarke, who exudes boldness as much as
he does bonhomie, tends towards caution, although he is said in this instance
to have preferred a cut of 0.5%. Defending his Budget, Mr Clarke said the
forecast for economic growth next year was not contingent on an early cut in
interest rates.
``The one thing I am not going to do is start playing fast and loose with
interest rates in response to political pressures,'' he declared, hand on heart
and, no doubt, with the fingers crossed on the other one concealed behind his
back. Politicians saying they will not do something are always planning to do
it, as the financial markets believed at the time.
Given the disappointing size of the Budget tax cuts, the forecast glad morning
did not dawn, leaving Tory MPs despondent, clearly something else was needed
from Mr Clarke. Now that something has happened.
Interest rates have become something of a political football - the Opposition
can always call for action because they do not have to implement it, but by
doing so are seen to be suggesting something positive.
The important thing about being in Opposition is to say the Government is not
doing enough or doing too much, even when you know what you are suggesting is
wrong. This does not matter because it is not going to happen so nobody will
find your error out, and, while the Chancellor may mock, since he is not going
to do it either, he is not going to show your error up for what it is.
As for his mockery, it will be treated by the electorate as what they would
expect him to do, such is the combative nature of our politics.
But will the cut make any real difference to you, me and the man in the
Hillhead tram? Will we start spending again, boosting those sluggish high
street sales, up only 0.6% last month over the previous one?
Mind you, that 0.6% can be presented as good news. Our savings will certainly
earn less, but our mortgages will also cost less, although will it be enough
less to be noticed?
The housing market, artificially stimulated by the Government a decade ago, has
been stagnant for years and nothing that has been done, although not much has
been attempted, has rescued it from the doldrums.
This cut - the new rates will take effect from February 1 - probably too little
too late, should mean on a repayment mortgage the monthly repayment on a
#30,000 loan comes down by #4.01, and on a #60,000 loan by #8.93. Add the
Budget tax changes and there will be more money in people's pockets.
The building societies were not slow to react to the cut. A welcome Christmas
present for new and existing mortgage customers and good news for the housing
market, was how Abbey National described the news.
Then came the inevitable cacophony of agreement and dissent. The Building
Employers Confederation, while welcoming the cut, said it would have ``little
impact on the construction industry'' now back in serious recession.
The Institute of Directors said there was room for further reductions. This was
what was needed to help the economy, but business looked forward to further
reductions.
The British Chambers of Commerce, which welcomed the cut, said there had been
scope for a 0.5% reduction, while the Royal Bank of Scotland, which cut its
base rate by 0.25%, looked forward to a further reduction in the first quarter
of next year.
If ever a politician was deaved with advice, solicited and unsolicited, it is
the Chancellor. ``If I listened to all the short-term advice I get day by day,
I would have blown this recovery off course a long time ago,'' he said
yesterday.
Top of the advisory heap are the so-called Wise Men, originally seven, who were
set up in the autumn of 1992 by Mr Clarke's predecessor, Mr Norman Lamont,
following the ERM debacle. It seemed a good idea for views other than those of
the Treasury's legendarily inaccurate forecasters to be available to the
Chancellor and their appointment was also a way of opening up Whitehall, part
of the Government's commitment to less secrecy.
For various reasons - people have moved to new jobs - their numbers have been
cut to three, and although Mr Clarke, the Treasury insists, will be announcing
three additional names soon to bring them up to six, he seems in no great
hurry. Being more of a pragmatist than an economist himself, he may feel he has
little need of wise men to blind him with science.
In a letter to The Times yesterday the three called for a change in interest
rates on the grounds that, if unchanged, the output in growth in 1996 was
unlikely to reach the forecast 3%. The prudent course, they said, was to move
rates downwards to ensure a revival in demand.
Was the cut part, as Downing Street's resident spin doctor was boasting
yesterday, of a ``triple whammy'' for the Government? The other two parts are
the fall of 20,400 in unemployment last month, bringing it to a
four-and-a-half-year low of 2,244,500, and that 0.6% rise in high street sales.
Or was the cut, as the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce said,
to be welcomed in the same manner as the arrival of an ambulance at an accident
- one was grateful to see it, but it would be preferable if it wasn't necessary?
Was the cut, as the Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said, being made not because
the economy was strong but because it was weak?
Initially the City was lukewarm. The 0.5% cut was too small to be greeted with
a cheer, but as the realisation dawned that what the Chancellor had been
signalling at his news conference was that he now favours a little-by-little
approach, and there will be more little cuts to come, the mood improved.
Using interest rates as a tool of economic management is currently the
fashionable thing to do, and what Mr Clarke has revealed is (ignore those Hush
Puppies) he is not totally blind to fashion.

Alexander C D Small, school master and climber; born September 6, 1909, died
December 9, 1995
AT a glance, the frail, balding figure with that distinctive, awkward gait
might have passed, especially in later years, as one of life's victims. Alex
Small, however, was diminished only in name.
His eye was a hawk's, his intellect bright and far-reaching, and, though
stricken by poliomyelitis in his Springburn, Glasgow, childhood, the slight
physique had known exertions and triumphs not experienced by the less tenacious.
The aquiline look of Alexander Cunninghame Douglas Small, a former president of
the Scottish Mountaineering Club who died aged 86 in Crieff, Perthshire, on
Saturday after a lengthy illness, was all flannel.
It would have rattled a few miscreants at Tarbet or Kirkintilloch's Oxgang
primary schools where he was successively head teacher, but to friends the
glint in his eyes was a gleam.
An inveterate raconteur, Alex liked a dram and a laugh and many he inspired
among a wide hill fraternity with his inimitable, conspirational wit. He had
the warmest (most enduring) handshake I knew and a supernatural recall of
personal fact or foible you had so casually and long-since disclosed.
Quality memory, love of language, and a meticulous style made Alex Small the
right stuff for his term (1976-87) as general editor of what many still feel
were the SMC's best district climbing guides.
Despite a partly wasted thigh, Alex was no climbing slouch himself and like Tom
Weir (coincidentally reared in the same Adamswell Street tenements) heralded
the postwar working-class assault on the traditionally middle-class SMC. Sadly,
the club remainded misogynist.
Weir recalls his first meeting with Small near the Slack Dhu crag in the
Campsies. Climbs then for the impecunious had to be within city walking
distance: ``There a group of Creag Dhu climbers sitting around a fair. I
spotted a slim stranger. He had a sketching pad with him even then in 1932.''
Small sketched and painted in water colours all his adult life and after
retiral to Hollybush Road, Crieff, in 1974 often sold his works.
He climbed with the best of his era, including the similarly slight and balding
J H B Bell, whom W H Murray famously recalled making breakfast for his party in
the CIC hut on Ben Nevis: ``Porridge, sausage and kippers were all stirred into
one pot. As a practical chemist, he was imbued with the truth that a meal was a
fuel-intake, therefore, its separation into courses was an auld wife's nicety,
and not for climbers.''
Small's most memorable rock climb, of course, was as one of the redoubtable
trio (the others, salesman Hamish Hamilton and engineer Alex Anderson) who in
1936 made the first ascent of Agag's Groove on Buachaille Etive Mor in Glencoe.
It is reputedly Scotland's most popular rock climb. Alex once told me his
abiding memory of the 300ft route is that he set foot on it, ``resolutely
feart''.
Despite his physical handicap and background, Small gained a scholarship to
Allan Glen's School and largely self-financed his way through Glasgow
University, working with GEC installing the first sound systems in city cinemas.
His later ice and rock climbs were achieved after a long regime of self-imposed
prolonged walks aimed at overcoming his disability. Alex's wife Celia died in
1984. He leaves two sons, Hamish, a landscape gardener and wood carver in
Kinlochleven, and Drummond, a business consultant in Kilmaurs. The funeral is
to Perth Crematorium at 2.30pm tomorrow.

JACK the lad's reign looks over and done. The Irish Geordie's glorious decade
ended in defeat and failure to qualify for the European Championship finals at
Anfield last night, but his ageing side gave him their best shot in a finale to
an era that was memorable in its own right.
Paddy's Army didn't quite do enough to take the fairytale into extra-time but,
when Charlton sits down and decides his future, he won't have any trouble
recalling a marvellous past.
Nor could he complain about the way his men tried to give him another chance to
terrorise the elite in England next year with the up-and-at-'em football that
may not be the choice of the purists but does provide a bit of contrast at this
level.
The chances of it succeeding against the precocious young stars of Holland in
this play-off were always slim but the Dutch lived a little dangerously in the
second-half when they were only one goal to the good and the old Irish danders
were up.
They were never seriously in danger of losing but it was only in the last
minute that they scored the second goal which finally dumped their opponents.
Their lithe, brilliant young striker, Patrick Kluivert, did the damage on both
occasions.
In the end, they were the team that went through to the finals but, if the
Irish team will be missed a little, their fans will be missed a lot.
They were still singing in grand style as their weary players tropped off stage.
Charlton, exasperated at being asked the inevitable question, replied: ``For
the millionth time, I am going to speak to people after the New Year and then
see what to do.
``Holland are a great team and deserved to win. We have no complaints.
``I was disappointed with the result and our performance, but Holland could
even go on to win the championship.
``We have a lot of problems and a lot of work to do.''
Dutch coach Gws Hiddink said: ``The two goals came as the result of the way we
tried to play.
``I would like to praise the Irish for their high performance of
sportsmanship.''
Dennis Bergkamp said: ``It was a good game, people enjoyed it, and the Irish
and Dutch fans are all singing - that's what it's all about.
``In the end we made it look easy, but we had to work hard for it.''
There was a fantastic atmosphere inside the ground long before the teams
appeared, with the orange favours of the Dutch presenting a splendid contrast
to the green of the Irish.
The din was such that the singing drowned out the pre-match music, although the
Irish fans, in particular, were in such good voice that they were worth
listening to themselves.
The Irish contingent did not take kindly to a blatant dive inside their team's
area but they were hushed when a pass from Bergkamp found Davids and his shot
was parried by Alan Kelly.
They were alarmed further when Bergkamp hit a tremendous effort from the edge
of the box that struck a post with the keeper beaten.
The Irish hit back with a fine move involving McGrath, Townsend, and Phelan
before the cross came over which Aldridge could not get any power behind.
The Republic were going through a good spell and Sheridan might have done
better than shoot wide, admittedly from a distance. The need to take these
chances was hammered home painfully a minute later when the Dutch took the lead
with a brilliant piece of football.
Seedorf started it with a magnificent pass to Davids, whose quick touch inside
found Kluivert, and he sent a left-foot shot out of Kelly's reach.
The Irish went after an equaliser with a will in the minutes before half-time
but Townsend was hurt in a clash with Seedorf and looked in serious bother.
Townsend, somewhat surprisingly, was in place for the second half but did not
look at all comfortable. Indeed, five minutes into the period, he had to give
up the struggle and was replaced by Jason McAteer.
Nine minutes later, the Dutch replaced Bergkamp, who was limping slightly, with
Johan de Kock and continued to stand firm as the Republic forced the pace.
There was a real escape for the Republic, however, when Kluivert rose to head a
cross from Helder and saw it crash off the bar to Davids, whose fierce shot hit
McGrath and then was cleared.
When Sheridan gave the ball away to Kluivert, the Dutch seemed sure to go two
up. The striker laid the ball in front of Seedorf but his shot hit a defender's
foot and went over the bar.
With 16 minutes left Charlton tried another ploy, pushing on Alan Kernaghan for
Aldridge.
Then, Dutch captain Danny Blind was booked and, as a result, misses the first
game in the finals. His team-mates missed two good chances to finish the Irish
off. First, when Kelly did well to save from Overmars, and then when he did a
good job again to block a Davids effort close in.
The closing minutes were all about Irish desperation as they tried to grab the
goal that would have kept the show on the road but, inevitably, it was Holland
who landed the killer blow, through Kluivert with just seconds remaining. This
time the curtain really did come down.
HOLLAND - Van der Sar, Reiziger, Blind, Seedorf, Bogarde, De Boer, Overmars,
Davids, Kluivert, Bergkamp, Helder. Substitutes - Winter, De Kock, Mulder,
Numan, De Goey.
REPUBLIC OF IRELAND - A Kelly, G Kelly, Irwin, Babb, McGrath, Kenna, Townsend,
Aldridge, Cascarino, Sheridan, Phelan. Substitutes - Houghton, McLoughlin,
McAteer, Kernaghan, Bonner.
Referee - V Zhuk (Belarus).

Aberdeen 4, Kilmarnock 1
ABERDEEN fans proved during last season's relegation struggle that they will
turn out in large numbers in the face of adversity. Last night they proved
also
that they will turn out in numbers if the tickets are free.
They were rewarded with a resounding victory for the Dons as a result of Joe
Miller's first hat trick for the club and the first goal for Aberdeen for
#700,000 signing, Dean Windass.
Seven days earlier, with the sides level at a goal apiece, the match had to be
abandoned due to a power failure and the Dons' board decided that fans would
not have to pay for the replay, and the result was the second-biggest crowd of
the season.
Even heavy rain did not deter the support who snapped up every available
ticket
leaving the only gaps in the ground in the visitors' area.
Aberdeen dominated but when Kilmarnock pushed forward in the first half the
defence looked shaky. However, in the second half their defence was hardly
tested and they cruised to victory and three important points.
Captain Stewart McKimmie returned to the side after suspension, with Brian
Grant dropping to the bench. Also back on the bench was Theo Snelders just 24
hours after having played his first reserve match after injury.
Derek Anderson lined up for Kilmarnock in place of Tom Black who was suffering
from tonsillitis.
In four minutes, Bernard crossed a great ball to Billy Dodds as he advanced on
the goal, but the striker failed to control it and the danger was cleared.
Eight minutes later, Jess took a swift free kick which Shearer headed to
Bernard but his shot was pushed wide. From the corner by Miller, the ball was
nodded down by Irvine and keeper Lekovic only just managed to scramble clear.
However, a minute later Miller picked up a Windass pass, and after having
passed Mark Reilly unleashed a right-foot shoot from the edge of the box to
the
top left-hand corner of the net to give Aberdeen the lead.
Former Pittodrie player Bobby Connor tried a shot from outside the box after
15
minutes but it went harmlessly past, then in 18 minutes Jess back heeled to
Miller whose shot gave the keeper difficulty, and Shearer raced in to try to
score off the rebound, but Lekovic dived to force the shot wide.
Kilmarnock equalised after 21 minutes when the Aberdeen defence fell into
complete disarray. Twice the ball crossed the six-yard line untouched by any
home defender.
The first time McKimmie cleared it off the line but the ball fell to Reilly
who
sent it back in. Hendry missed completely but Wright was on hand to push it
across the line unchallenged.
Kilmarnock's joy was short-lived for in 28 minutes, Glass turned MacPherson
and
sent the ball across the Kilmarnock six-yard line from the left. The
visitor's
defence followed Aberdeen's example and it rolled through to Miller, who
blasted in his second goal to restore Aberdeen's lead.
Seven minutes into the second half, Jess fired a powerful drive from outside
the box as Aberdeen looked to extend their lead, and it deflected off a
defender but neither the protestations of the players nor a linesman's flag
could persuade referee McGilvray to award a corner.
In 57 minutes, Kilmarnock came close when Neil Whitworth headed down a
MacPherson free kick and Tom Brown, shot just over.
On the hour Aberdeen got a free kick when MacPherson fouled Glass and Shearer
got his head to the Jess cross but it skimmed over.
Two minutes later Wright was booked for a foul on Glass.
In 65 minutes Jess laid on Miller's hat trick by weaving his way past three
defenders and leaving the shot for him to drive low past Lekovic.
The keeper almost gave Aberdeen their fourth when he punched a Glass corner
towards his own goal, but Anderson cleared.
Grant replaced Dodds in 73 minutes, and with five minutes to go Miller was
replaced by Hugh Robertson. Many had left the ground content with three
Aberdeen goals but Windass made it worthwhile for those who stayed with just a
minute to go.
ABERDEEN - Watt, McKimmie, Glass, Bernard, Irvine, Smith, Miller, Shearer,
Windass, Dodds, Jess. Substitutes - Grant, Snelders, Robertson.
KILMARNOCK - Lekovic, MacPherson, Reilly, Hendry, Whitworth, Anderson,
Mitchell, Connor, Wright, Brown, Holt. Substitutes - Laughlan, Maskrey, Geddes.
Referee - J McGilvray, Edinburgh.

WORLD CUP EXTRA
SCOTT Booth shuddered yesterday as he recalled two words which should strike
realism into Scotland's approach to the 1998 World Cup qualifying programme -
Skonto Riga.
The Latvian club side embarrassed Aberdeen in last season's UEFA Cup and now
their national team are rivals in the race to France.
But Booth, established as Scotland's No.1 striker, believes that for Craig
Brown's men being forewarned is forearmed.
Scotland have been given a 10-match qualifying programme for the 1998 finals
with Sweden, Austria, Latvia, Estonia, and Belarus barring their path.
Booth argues the hurdles drawn in Paris on Tuesday night are not unsurmountable
and the desire to prove themselves at the summit of world football will drive
on an ``unfashionable'' Scotland team.
``We qualified for five World Cup finals in a row from 1974 onwards and I
believe we became a bit blase about it,'' said Booth.
``We were taking it for granted but we missed out on America and we don't want
to do that again.
``We have made it to Euro '96, which for many of us is a career highlight so
far, but as a player you want to test yourself on a global stage and that is
the World Cup finals.''
q CHAMPIONS Brazil and host nation France have emerged among the early
favourites for the 1998 World Cup even though neither featured in Tuesday's
draw for the preliminary rounds.
Bookmakers William Hill installed Brazil as favourites at odds of 5-1, ahead of
Germany at 7-1, France at 8-1, and Italy and Spain both at 10-1.
The champions and hosts automatically qualify for the finals without playing in
the preliminaries.
q CROATIA has offered Bosnia the use of its stadiums after the two former
Yugoslav republics were grouped together alongside Slovenia in the qualifying
draw.
q TERRY Venables looks ready to accept the challenge of leading England's
daunting 1998 World Cup mission. The extension to the national coach's current
contract could be in place by the time he heads the New Year delegation to Rome
to map out the qualifying programme.

HOWARD Kendall will meet his Sheffield United players for the first time today.
The man who was instrumental in Everton's success during the 1980s took over as
Bramall Lane manager yesterday, 24 hours after the departure of Dave Bassett.
Kendall's immediate brief is to prepare United for the match at Ipswich on
Saturday, with the team second from bottom of the Endsleigh League's first
division. He has been out of the game for eight months after having left Notts
County.
``I didn't want to come back into the game with a club that was just happy to
survive. Sheffield United are an ambitious club and have an ambitious chairman,
who will allow me to manage.''
Kendall has installed a new management team with former Burnley player-coach
Adrian Heath his assistant, and Viv Busby the coach.
q CELTIC have handed their supporters a Christmas bonus by dropping prices for
Saturday's Scottish premier division clash with Falkirk to #10. Accompanied
children will pay only #4 to enter the family section at Parkhead. Managing
director Fergus McCann said: ``We want to encourage a family day at Celtic
Park.''
q EXPERIENCED striker Ken Eadie goes into hospital next week for an ankle
operation. It means the Clydebank striker will be on the sidelines over the
busy holiday programme, and not back until the end of January.
Among the games Eadie will miss is the first-division clash with Airdrie which
was postponed on Tuesday for the second time, and has been re-scheduled for
Saturday, December 23.
q ALBION Rovers striker Gordon Young has been caught in the fall-out of the
resignation of Dave Bassett as manager of Sheffield United. Young headed south
on Sunday for a week's training with the English club, but was back home by
Monday evening. Meanwhile, Albion have signed former East Stirling left-back,
Paul Friar.
q SECOND-DIVISION Bologna beat a nine-man AC Milan side 7-6 on penalties
yesterday to shock the Serie A leaders in front of their home fans and reach
the semi-finals of the Italian Cup.
Bologna, who had given away an injury-time penalty, then outgunned Milan in a
tense shoot-out - after missing their first spot-kick of the night. Regular
time had ended at 1-1 with the aggregate 2-2.
Milan played the last few minutes of extra time with just nine men after
striker Dejan Savicevic, in 91 minutes, and veteran captain Franco Baresi (116)
were both sent off.
Savicevic earlier had scored the last-minute penalty - with at least three
minutes of injury time already on the clock - after Bologna had taken the lead
in 76 minutes when a shot deflected off a Milan defender.
Milan and Bologna stayed level on penalties up to 6-6 but then defender
Francesco Coco, who scored in the first leg, hit wide and Bologna converted to
seal the victory.Bologna now play serie A sides Atalanta or Cagliari, who meet
today.
Fiorentina beat Palermo 2-1 and 3-1 on aggregate to set up a semi-final with
Inter. Serie B side Palermo had beaten holders Parma 3-0 in the first round.

WHILE the SFA delegation should have been quietly congratulating themselves in
Paris following a World Cup draw which favoured the country's side, they found
themselves instead dealing with unfounded rumours surrounding the future of
manager, Craig Brown.
Immediately following the draw came suggestions that Brown would not be in
charge when the qualifying games commence in the autumn. But Jim Farry, SFA
chief executive, dismissed the rumours.
``Craig Brown is here,'' he said. ``He is preparing for the qualifying games
and he is happy following this draw. That should answer any questions about his
position.''
Brown, of course, wears two hats at the SFA, just as his close friend, Andy
Roxburgh, did before him. He is technical director as well as international
team manager, and Brown, with his strong coaching background, sees the less
glamourous, much less publicised role as of huge importance.
The SFA think likewise but the position of international manager is the one
seen by the footballing public as the No.1 job in the country.
Brown's position there will be re-confirmed by the SFA's international
committee when it is due for review in July.
``Craig Brown has taken the country to the finals of the European
Championship,'' said Farry. ``We could not ask for anything more from him. That
was his first mandate and he has been successful.''
Brown said: ``I have been employed by the SFA for nine years. I could not ask
for better people to work for. I am very happy and content in my job, both
jobs, in fact.''
Brown has earned the SFA around #2m by guiding his unfancied, often underrated
squad to the finals in England in the summer.
Now he has seen a draw for World Cup qualifying hand the Scots one of the
easier seeds in Sweden when England, for example, must face Italy and Northern
Ireland have Germany and Portugal in their section.
Naturally, Brown is cautious when he talks of Group 4. He is quick to stress
that Sweden finished third in the last World Cup finals, and points out that
Belarus were difficult opponents for Holland during the just completed European
Championship qualifying games.
``We lost to Sweden in Stockholm just last month,'' said Brown. ``But there is
no doubt that this is the kind of group we can be happy with. The major problem
will be arranging the fixtures because so many of our opponents have shutdowns
in the winter months, and they will not want to play us then.''
Brown will travel with Farry to Vienna next month and work out the dates for
the qualifying games.
He will take the team to play Denmark in March, will oversee the under-21
side's campaign in Europe, he will take the full squad to the USA for warm-up
games in May, and he will take them to the finals in England in June.
Brown is in charge. That is official. He will remain in charge for the World
Cup matches which now loom.
q.SWEDISH manager Tommy Svensson has labelled Scotland captain Gary McAllister
as the man who can upset his side's World Cup dream.
Scotland have been paired in a six-nation section in the qualifying process for
the 1998 finals in France, alongside Sweden, Austria, Latvia, Estonia, and
Belarus.
Now Elland Road, Leeds, will become a Group 4 spying location for managers
Svensson and Brown in the phoney-war before the campaign begins next autumn.
``I don't like picking out players from the opposition but Gary McAllister is a
play-maker of top international class,'' said Svensson of the Leeds midfielder.
``If I need a form check on him I can have a word with his new team-mate, Tomas
Brolin. Scotland look the biggest danger to us on paper but we will see what
happens.''
Only the winners of the nine European groups will automatically qualify for
France, with the best-placed runner-up.
The other eight second-placed sides face a home-and-away play-off, so Scotland
might have to cram 12 matches in between the end of the European Championships,
when the campaigns begin, and November 1997.
Scotland could do worse than face Sweden away in the first game - they went to
Stockholm in 1980, when a Gordon Strachan goal gave them victory en route to
the 1982 finals.
``I'd say we have a chance of winning the group - but Sweden are the main
dangers,'' added Brown.
``They finished third in the last World Cup after all and they will be hurting
after failing to make it to the European Championships next summer.''
Jim Farry admitted the pairings were not the most glamourous but expects full
houses at Hampden, where capacity will be cut to around 33,000 because of
building work on a new South Stand.
``It would be very nice to make it to the finals after missing out on America,
but this is quite a tough section,'' said Farry. ``All we will say is the
players and backroom staff will give it their best shot, and we hope the
Scottish nation will rally round.''
l.Latvia and Belarus have never played Scotland.
l.Latvia are ranked fifty-fourth in the world. Their club side, Skonto Riga,
beat Aberdeen in the UEFA Cup last season.
l.Belarus are ranked eighty-eighth and enter their first World Cup. ``They beat
Holland in the last Euro '96 qualifier so we under-estimate them at our
peril,'' said Brown. Belarus has a population of more than 10m.
l.Estonia, ranked 126th, were beaten home and away by Scotland in the
unsuccessful bid to reach America in 1994.
l.Austria, who faced both Irelands in the European Championship groups, lost
2-1 to Scotland in a friendly in Vienna last year.
l.Sweden beat Scotland 2-0 in a friendly in October but lost twice in the 1982
qualifying programme and a match in the 1990 finals in Italy.

THE World Cup qualifying draw was within minutes of not taking place on Tuesday
in Paris because of a diplomatic row.
It took a major gamble by FIFA's autocratic president, Joao Havelange, to face
down the French Government - and the 79-year-old Brazilian won.
If Havelange had lost, the draw - being beamed world-wide - would have been
postponed, until early next year, and would have taken place outside France.
The problem arose when visas for Nigerian delegates bound for Paris were
refused following the row over the execution of nine civil-rights activists in
that country. Part of the sanctions agreed by the EU, said the French.
Havelange - who has ruled FIFA for 21 years - demanded that the government
respect the accord it signed in 1991, when France made its successful bid to
stage the 1998 finals, guaranteeing visas to all delegations for functions
connected with the World Cup.
All night negotiations failed to find a solution, until Havelange was given
backing from his FIFA executive to tell the French Foreign Ministry that unless
written permission for the visas was guaranteed in writing by 1600 GMT on
Tuesday - only 80 minutes before the live broadcast was due to begin - the draw
would be cancelled.
The French, already embarrassed in Europe by disruption caused by strikes -
were cornered, and they conceded only minutes before the deadline was due to
expire.
Havelange's victory also is a blow to his critics, including UEFA leader
Lennart Johansson, who is a declared candidate for the presidency in 1998, when
the Brazilian's sixth, four-year term is due to end.
However, he recently hinted that he may carry on.

MARK McGhee was yesterday appointed manager of Wolves on a
three-and-a-half-year contract.
The 38-year-old Glaswegian brings with him Colin Lee as assistant manager and
Mike Hickman as coach - his old backroom team at Leicester.
Wolves moved in quickly after thrashing out a compensation package, believed to
be worth around #750,000, after the trio walked out on the Filbert Street club
six days ago.
Promotion-chasing Leicester had ``reluctantly'' granted permission to their
Endsleigh League first-division rivals - who lie fourth-bottom - to make an
approach, and Molineux chairman Jonathan Hayward entered into immediate talks
to appoint the club's twenty-second manager in time for Saturday's Midlands
derby at home to Port Vale.
McGhee admitted he was embarrassed by the furore surrounding his departure from
Leicester after just one year there but said: ``The size of this club and the
potential are irresistible, and would be to anyone with real ambition in the
game.
``I think it's understandable there is resentment that I left at the stage I
did. It was a very difficult decision for me and, in many ways, I am a bit
embarrassed by it all because I don't think it reflects the type of person I
am.''
With a wry smile McGhee added: ``I hope to be here for more than a year! We
need two points a game to see us into the play-offs and that is championship
form for the rest of the season.
``There has got to be a bit of a turn-around for that to happen but the squad
have been under-achieving and, in recent weeks, there has been an improvement.''
The Scot made it clear he would be picking the team for Saturday's home game
with Port Vale, albeit with the advice of Bobby Downes, who was praised by the
Molineux board for his work as caretaker-manager since the resignation of
former England manager Graham Taylor 30 days ago.
McGhee said he thought Wolves lacked quality in depth and in certain areas and
said he thought their professional squad was too big. But he added: ``Like
everyone else, I am surprised they are not up at the top of the table.''
First-team coach Steve Harrison resigned yesterday but the remainder of the
Wolves backroom staff will stay on to work with the new manager.

BRITAIN'S biggest cider maker, HP Bulmer, is brimful of confidence after
half-time earnings up 12% to #16m helped by the excellent summer and a rising
market share.
The profits figure is struck before a #2.1m exceptional charge for efficiency
measures which should soon begin to pay off.
Year-on-year UK cider consumption rose 15% to 109.5 million gallons, of which
Bulmer produced about 46% - just ahead of the enlarged Matthew Clark after its
acquisition of Taunton Cider.
The consolidation of the industry into two major players and three smaller
operators with around 5% each should reduce the pressure on pricing if all are
sensible, although the supermarkets still allow only wafer-thin margins for
their suppliers.
However, the company has a higher exposure to the pub trade where margins tend
to be better, and even in the off-trade it has a substantial proportion of the
branded business with Strongbow and Scrumpy Jack gaining volume. New products
such as Strongbow Ice were launched just in time to benefit from both good
weather and some pick-up in consumer spending.
Although margins did improve from 12.1% to 12.7%, they were depressed by rising
costs of both apple juice, where European concentrate rose by half, and paper
and board for packaging.
There was also pressure from the continuing development costs of the Stassen
business in Belgium. It and the Australian operations now account for a fifth
of profits.
The interim dividend has been raised 7% to 4.55p. Bulmer shares rose 3p to 498p.

SWIMMING
GRAEME Smith should have little difficulty defending the 1500 metres free-style
title and staying on course for Atlanta, but fellow Scots Fraser Walker, Kerry
Martin, and Kirsty Hope face more testing examinations of their Olympic
credentials in the Uncle Ben's Winter Challenge starting in Sheffield today.
Walker is confident he can make the British team in the 200m medley, but the
Commonwealth Games bronze medallist faces stiff opposition from English pair
James Hickman, who beat him at Cumbernauld last time, and David Warren, the
defending winter champion, as well as Canadian Russell Patrick.
Success in the butterfly sprint would be an ideal confidence-booster for
Martin, a Stirling University student, in the build-up to the Olympic trials
back in Sheffield in March. She begins defence of the 50m butterfly today, but
her main objective will be the 100m.
For Hope, the Olympics may be a year too soon, but the 17-year-old former
British youth cap is one of Scotland's genuine rising talents who could make
her mark in either sprint free-style or back-stroke.
The young Scot is fortunate that the Olympic season has coincided with a
relatively easy sixth year at Dundee High School, and she will be keen to prove
her form against established internationalists Susan Rolph and Kathy Osher.

CRICKET: THIRD TEST
JOHN Crawley today faces his toughest challenge yet after forcing himself back
into England's Test team.
The Lancashire batsman is fitter than ever, having lost around a stone in
weight since last winter's Ashes tour of Australia. He is quicker and more
agile in the field after a rigorous training routine.
His technique at the crease also has improved, with a heavy emphasis on playing
straight, thereby eliminating as many risks as possible.
But now he is about to be given his sternest examination so far over the five
days at Kingsmead as England and South Africa meet in the third Test. After the
rain of Centurion Park and the Mike Atherton-inspired fightback at Wanderers,
it remains 0-0 with three to play.
The 24-year-old Crawley is likely to bat at No.3 - a position again made
available by Mark Ramprakash's failure to come good when the heat is on.
After nine Test appearances, Crawley averages only 22 but he did make a
half-century at No.3 in his last Test - against West Indies less than four
months ago.
``John has worked very hard on his fitness and his fielding since last
winter,'' said manager Ray Illingworth. ``It has been a tremendous effort. And,
as a batsman, when he gets in, he's got great concentration.''
Crawley knows this is his big opportunity. ``I've got to take it,'' he said.
``There will be younger players than me coming along over the next couple of
years and I must make my mark before then.''
England cannot afford a repeat of their first-innings collapse during the
second Test when they were dismissed for a paltry 200. For it is unlikely they
can dig themselves out of that much trouble again, no matter how well Atherton
and Jack Russell are batting.
In some ways, Russell's superb form in front of the stumps - he possesses a
first-class average of 94 on the trip to date - has added to the management's
dilemma. England would love to play five bowlers - but are nervous about going
in with only five front-line batsmen.
Just a few months ago, the solution would have been to drop Russell and give
Alec Stewart the gloves. There would seem little chance of that now after
Russell's heroics alongside Atherton in Johannesburg and his subsequent
career-best 129 not out against Boland.
England were so undecided about their final XI last night that they excluded
only Ramprakash and injured fast bowler Darren Gough from a list of possible
starters and were even toying with the idea of using Mike Watkinson in his
dual-purpose role of medium-pacer and off-spinner.
The pitch, green and damp only 24 hours earlier, has now turned into a much
friendlier looking strip.
South Africa, with 13 players in Durban, also were keeping their options open
last night. A scan on fast bowler Shaun Pollock's left foot revealed no
fracture but he still faced a lengthy pre-match fitness check after complaining
of soreness during yesterday's practice. Teams:
England (from): M A Atherton, captain, A J Stewart, J P Crawley, G P Thorpe, G
A Hick, R A Smith, R C Russell, D G Cork, R K Illingworth, A R C Fraser, D E
Malcolm, M C Ilott, P J Martin, M Watkinson.
South Africa (from): A C Hudson, G Kirsten, W J Cronje, captain, D J Cullinan,
J N Rhodes, J H Kallis, B M McMillan, D J Richardson, S M Pollock, C R
Matthews, A A Donald, M W Pringle, C E Eksteen.
q ENGLAND'S women have clinched the series by desperately hanging on for a draw
in the third and final Test against India in Hyderabad. After having drawn the
first Test and winning the second by two runs, England went into the final day
chasing an unlikely target of 302. They finished on 182 for nine.

LANARKSHIRE-based meat wholesalers PR Duff has announced a #500,000 increase in
turnover at the end of their first year in new premises in Wishaw.
Duff moved to Wishaw after 70 years in the old Glasgow Meat Market and has
expanded into new products and services.
Rory Duff, managing director, and grandson of the company's founder said: ``The
move to Lanarkshire has been very good for us.
"Our new state-of-the art premises were built by a local company and a cost of
nearly #750,000 and will allow us to grow the business in Europe.
``I am delighted to say we achieved all our goals for 1995 and we have been
able to employ additional staff.''
The company also attended the Anuega Food Fair in Germany for the first time
this year, resulting in two major new European orders valued at more than #2m.
The company's main exports are Scotch beef destined for Italy, Belgium and
Luxembourg.

SCOTTISH Exiles set themselves up for a win in the Under-21 Championship after
defeating Glasgow 20-17 at Murrayfield last night. The Exiles, having already
beaten South and Edinburgh, have now won all three of their matches and only
North and Midlands stand in the way of a clean sweep.
Exiles must now feel that they will contribute players to the national under-21
side. One obvious candidate might be their captain and stand-off Jamie McKee
who was in top form last night. McKee, with a penalty, a conversion and a
brilliant solo try, amassed half his side's points.
Exiles other top man  behind the scrum was centre Jonathan Stuart, who scored a
try, with flanker James McIntosh getting a third, converted by McKee.
Glasgow hit back from 20-3 down with a try by flanker Rob Wylie converted by
full-back Tony Greenshields who had earlier kicked a penalty, and a penalty try
award after West of Scotland's James Craig had been held back. Greenshields
converted.
Earlier in the evening at the same venue, North and Midlands scored their first
win in this season's championship when they defeated South 19-17 thanks to a
try right on full-time by right wing Jon Goldie of Glenrothes. And a deserved
win it was for North and Midlands who showed character in coming back after
trailing 17-7.
South, despite the individual contribution of stand-off Gavin Dalgleish, who
scored all his side's points with four first half penalties and a fine second
half try, rarely looked like penetrating the North defence.
North pulled back from an initial 12-0 deficit with a try by their captain and
scrum half Philip Simpson, converted by Gerry Tosh. Then No.8 Gregor Hayter
scored a try from a charged-down kick, which Tosh also converted, to set up
Goldie's big finish.

Leaders favour
single currency
UK business leaders are strongly in favour of a single European currency, a
survey published yesterday showed.
Nearly two-thirds (62%) thought it would be beneficial and just 11% were
against the idea, according to the survey by Andersen Consulting.
Across Europe as a whole, the proportion in favour of a single currency rose to
70%.
Among specific industries, the most enthusiastic was the banking sector, where
79% of major European businesses thought it would be beneficial.
Tomkins boost
THE stock market welcomed overnight news from Tomkins that it is to buy Gates
Corporation, a privately owned US manufacturer of power transmission belting
and hose products mainly for the motor industry. Tomkins' shares rose 7p to
269p, with analysts generally giving the deal the thumbs-up. Details are still
awaited but a price tag of just over $1000m is expected plus the assumption of
$240m of debt.
Crime pays
CHUBB Security reported higher first-half profits despite lower demand from the
financial and construction sectors, particularly in the UK. Pre-tax profits
rose 13% to #44.4m in the six months to mid-October and the interim dividend
goes up 12% to 2.6p. There was strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region and in
Australia which offset duller conditions at home. Underlying sales were up 5%.
Deputy chairman
DANIEL Melin, chairman and chief executive of Arjo Wiggins Appleton's main
shareholder, St Louis, has joined the board as a director and deputy chairman.

PRINTER Bemrose Corporation has agreed to buy Wisconsin-based Nelson Marketing

IT seems unlikely that the Inland Revenue will reward employers with gifts this
yuletide season for their efforts in operating the PAYE system. It is more
likely that the Inland Revenue will be asking employers if they have correctly
reported gifts provided to their employees on their P11D forms.
Unfortunately the season of goodwill does not extend to the Inland Revenue's
treatment of gifts provided to employees. A taxable benefit arises on the cost
to the employer of providing the gift, regardless of whether the gift is a
luxury Christmas hamper or a miniature Christmas pudding.
The idea of a taxable benefit arising on Christmas gifts does not appeal to the
imagination of many employers as they do not want their employees to be
burdened with an additional tax liability. Consequently many employers agree to
meet the tax liabilities on behalf of their employees by way of an annual
settlement with the Inland Revenue.
It is important that employers do consider the tax implications of Christmas
gifts as PAYE Audit would seek to charge the employer with any amounts of tax
outstanding for the last six tax years.
With self-assessment approaching and the threat of penalties for incorrect P11D
returns looming, it is now essential that employers review this area and act
accordingly.
You might agree that the Revenue stance in respect of the benefit-in-kind
implications on Christmas gifts for employees mirrors that of a certain
Christmas character whose favourite phrase was ``Bah humbug''.
The corporation tax on Christmas gifts is not so gloomy as gifts for employees
would come under the heading of staff entertaining and would not be added back
in the corporation tax computation.
For Vat purposes the employer has a requirement to account for output tax where
the gift is standard-rated and exceeds #15 (excluding Vat).
The rules relating to staff Christmas parties are more favourable than that of
Christmas gifts. The Inland Revenue has bestowed concessionary treatment on
Christmas parties.
Before November 1 this year the concession exempted from tax one Christmas
party or similar function in the year which was open to staff generally and
where the cost did not exceed #50 a head.
The result was that where an employer held two parties a year, the cost of the
second was always held to be taxable even when the total cost of both functions
did not exceed #50 a head.
As with gifts, employers often choose to settle any costs on an annual basis
with the Revenue so as to remove any tax liability from their employees.
However, on November 1, the Revenue revised its concessionary treatment from
the tax year 1995-96 on-wards and has increased the concessionary cost of the
function to #75 a head.
Another change which will be welcomed by employers is that the total cost
figure may now be divided between more than one annual event, such as a
Christmas dinner and a summer outing, provided the total cost is no more than
#75 a head.
The revised concession also clarifies the Inland Revenue's practice on the
meaning of cost per head as the total Vat-inclusive price of the function,
including any associated benefits such as accommodation or transport, divided
by the number of people attending.
The cost per head does not refer to the cost per employee but to the cost per
individual attending the function.
Therefore the moral of the story could be not to provide gifts to employees but
to have a wonderful Christmas dinner instead. Is this food for thought?
Bah humbug might describe the taxman's attitude to Christmas gifts for staff so
Patricia Goldie, tax manager at KPMG in Glasgow, has come up with some food for
thought which might restore some festive cheer

WHEN Olympic TV rights first went on the market, for the London Games of 1948,
the BBC signed a cheque for $3000. Contemporary reports suggest the host
broadcasters pleaded poverty, and the organising committee never cashed the
cheque.
Now the Olympics command the world's biggest TV audience, and the largest fees,
explaining why the British Olympic Association yesterday was celebrating.
The biggest international sporting television agreement in history - #1500m -
has brought long-term security and a guarantee that UK sportsmen and women will
be better prepared.
NBC has agreed to buy from the International Olympic Committee the exclusive US
broadcast and cable TV rights for the 2004 (#529m), 2006 (#409m), and 2008
(#596m) Olympics - two Summer and one Winter Games. It is the first time a deal
has been struck without the venues being known.
US income represents roughly half of what the IOC can expect in global TV fees,
laying down a marker for those bidding for rights elsewhere.
The BOA receives a share of all these funds, each country negotiating
individually with the IOC. Paul Pruszynski, the BOA treasurer, said last night:
``This means we will have a guarantee of steady income. There will now be
increased pressure, not just from us, but from other national Olympic
committees, on how the IOC divides this money and from the Olympic programme
sponsorship. (TOPS)''
Pruszynski declined to say how much the BOA receives from the IOC. ``Each
country negotiates separately, exploiting its own opportunities, so that is
commercially sensitive information,'' he insisted.
However, the BOA budget in the current four-year Olympiad is some #12m. The two
sources for that are the UK appeal, and commercial sponsorship (TV and TOPS) of
which the latter is the greater.
``This will make some of our decision-making easier, reducing uncertainty,''
add Pruszynski. ``We will receive a larger share, guaranteeing a better service
for competitors. We are already the biggest single source of funds for sports
science and sports medicine in the UK - bigger than the Sports Council.''
The new deal means NBC will screen six of the next seven Olympics. Earlier this
year they paid #470m for the Sydney Olympics, and #365m for the 2002 Winter
Games in Salt Lake City. Coverage of the 1998 Winter Games, in Japan, went to
CBS for #250m.
NBC's pre-emptive strike shuts the US door, meantime, on satellite TV. It is
likely that UK rights, negotiated as part of a European Broadcasting Union
package, will go to terrestrial channels.
Michael Payne, the IOC's director of marketing, said their primary aim is the
widest public access, rather than income. In the past they have turned down
higher offers from other broadcasters.
The first televised Olympics, Berlin in 1936, reached just 162,000 viewers.
That, and the experience of the Beeb's cheque, perhaps, explains why Avery
Brundage, octogenarian former president of the IOC, could dismiss TV's
influence at the 1956 Winter Games in Cortina, Italy: ``We in the IOC have done
well without TV for 60 years and will do so certainly for the next 60.''
When the torch-bearer at Cortina's opening ceremony tripped over a television
cable, Brundage appeared to have got it right. Even the arrival of the global
Olympics - from Tokyo in 1964, with the first satellite relay - did not bring
security, and it was still a liability as recently as 1976, when the rights
fees of $32m for Montreal did not cover broadcast costs.
Just 15 years ago the Olympic movement was on the brink of bankruptcy. When Los
Angeles staged the Games in 1984, they were the sole bidders. Since then,
however, TV, and advertising has been the Games' saviour, and 10 cities are
bidding for the 2004 Summer Olympics.

NORTH and Midlands scored their first win in this season's Under-21
championship with a performance that produced a try advantage over South at
Murrayfield last night of three to one.
The combined districts, however, left it late and achieved their win with a
dramatic try right on full-time by their right wing Jon Goldie. The Glenrothes
wing, one of North's successes last night, took his scoring pass from full-back
Steve Newlands before diving over in the corner for the match winner.
And a deserved win it was for North and Midlands who showed character in coming
back after trailing 17-7 to a South side that definitely had its tail up.
South, despite the individual contribution of stand-off Gavin Dalgleish, who
scored all his side's points with four first half penalties and a fine second
half try, never looked like penetrating the North defence.
North pulled back from an initial 12-0 deficit with a try by their captain and
scrum half Philip Simpson, converted by stand off Gerry Tosh. But it was No.8
Gregor Hayter who turned in another impressive performance for his side and
pulled North back into the game.
The former Elgin player was finally rewarded for his efforts with a try from a

AS the date of another new year comes into view, leading professional golfers
become inclined to reflect philosophically and project optimistically. That was
certainly the way with three players yesterday on the eve of the fifth - and
last, according to their agreement - $2.3m Johnnie Walker World Championship at
the Tryall Club, Jamaica.
For Colin Montgomerie, a further year of progress inspires hopes of even better
times. However, Ernie Els, the holder, and Nick Faldo have more mixed feelings
about 1995, principally because neither was able to live up to his own
expectations, let alone those of the game at large, notably in the four major
championships.
Having won the European order of merit for a third successive year, Montgomerie
could legitimately claim it as ``the best of eight seasons which have all been
better than the previous one and I hope a major victory will make next year the
best again'' - a void in his record he is anxious, though not desperate, to
fill.
``For some time now I've been the player highest in the world rankings not to
have won a major,'' said Montgomerie, currently fifth before he set out in
sweltering sunshine for a practice round during which he intended to try out
two new putters and two No.3 woods which he arrived with from the Callaway
factory in California.
``I've been close three times,'' Montgomerie recalled of two US Opens and this
year's USPGA, ``but I must be patient and maybe in time someone will make a
mistake or I'll make something happen at the finish for a change.''
Then he went on to try to put his ambition in perspective in an increasingly
competitive environment.
He said: ``If you are playing almost 30 tournaments a year, as I intend to do
between the European and US Tours again in 1996, it won't work to concentrate
all your thoughts and energies on just four weeks out of 52, for the pressures
are high enough as it is.''
At least Montgomerie's left wrist injury seems to be on the mend. ``Hard
massage'' and regularly squeezing an over-size squash ball are helping to
restore the strength of the ligaments between the thumb and forefinger he tore
in Hong Kong four years ago and which began the problem. He may well maintain
his record of never having finished outside the first 12 here in four outings.
Although Faldo won at Doral, that was in the first week of March and the
achievement has been all but lost sight of by, as he put it, ``nothing clicking
in the majors'' and, more recently, by the break-up of his second marriage and
his highly publicised liaison with Brenna Cepelak, a student 18 years his
junior.
Although Faldo declined all comment on his private life he did say: ``The
off-course attention has been ridiculous, but I'm not in control of that. I
just have to live my own life.''
Little wonder that Europe's Ryder Cup victory over the United States, and his
own crucial part in it, represent his fondest memories of this year.
``I know Curtis Strange bogeyed the last two holes, but I had to make the 4s
when the pressure valve was turned right up and that 93-yard wedge shot to four
feet at the last was certainly the best I've played in the circumstances. It
was an unbelievably special moment,'' Faldo remarked.
Faldo also has substantially re-armed. He has a new ball, a new driver, and new
irons adjusted for the US Tour, where the tight pin positions determine clubs
with a little more loft.
A new sense of priorities, however, is the force behind Els' thoughts on the
upcoming season, although their opinion converges in one aspect.
John Daly, the Open champion, is the only reigning major title-holder in the
field of 20 vying for the $550,000 first prize and, in obvious reference to the
absence also of Greg Norman and Nick Price, first and second in the world
rankings, Faldo remarked: ``It's a shame they are all not here, but everyone
has the right to their own schedule.''
Having 12 months ago begun with two 64s, seven under the par of the 6767-yard
course, Els went on to complete his fifth victory of 1995, the US Open
included, and two more in European tournaments and one in America this year
must have seemed like short rations by comparison. But Els believes that in
1996 the pressure of expectation on him will be considerably less.
Moreover, Els intends to compete in the tournament immediately ahead of all
four majors, which will include the Scottish Open at Carnoustie - always
assuming, of course, that a sponsor or sponsors can be found before next July,
a New Year's resolution which should commend itself somewhere.

<TEXT>
WEST Indies captain Richie Richardson yesterday played down reports of a rift
between himself and Brian Lara.
Richardson was responding to a report in Tuesday's edition of the Trinidad
Guardian, in which team manager Wes Hall was quoted as saying Lara had
complained that cricket was ruining his life and that he had threatened to
retire.
Hall's comments had been made in his report to the West Indies Cricket Board of
Control and referred to incidents which occurred during this summer's tour of
England.
Hall's report reveals that Lara was upset with the lack of discipline on the
team, which he blamed on Richardson.
But Richardson said yesterday: ``I know, and you know, that a lot of what you
read in the papers is not really true.
``I have not got a problem with Brian. People have their opinions on different
things and if Brian gives his opinion about something, that does not mean
there's something between us.''
q CRICKET chiefs are to recommend that the Test and County Cricket Board extend
the powers of England chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth at their winter
meeting today.
In line with the South African system, there is a proposal to give Illingworth
the power to over-rule a county's selection of an England player if he feels
the player needs a break.
Meanwhile, moves to launch the English Cricket Board as a replacement for the
TCCB has been put back a few months after the TCCB had set an initial deadline
of January 1, 1996 for its inception.
However, the meeting is likely to introduce some changes to the domestic game
and the county championship could see some fine tuning.
The championship is almost certain to remain an 18-team structure, as opposed
to a two-division competition many had called for.
Other items under consideration:
l Benson and Hedges Cup: recommendation to reduce from 55 to 50 overs with just
one interval between innings.
l Heavy rollers to be used during matches.
l Possibility of county championship losing its `Sunday sandwich' from 1997 by
starting on Wednesdays and ending on Saturdays.

HOW about this for the impact professionalism is having on players' lives. John
Manson, newly married, had arranged with his employers not to work any overtime.
He was banking on the money he would receive as a member of the international
squad. Having been sent off, he has lost that now. Overtime is back on the
agenda. Makes you think, doesn't it? Ain't funny.
q THE Diary understands that Scotland is on the verge of a registration scheme
for rugby players. The Scottish Rugby Clubs' Association was asked in by the
SRU recently, and had a ``very sympathetic hearing and a constructive
discussion,'' according to Alan Irons, of Cartha Queen's Park, whose original
idea sparked the formation of the association. Representatives of the 46 clubs
met again last night.
The Association's members believe that provinces should play in Europe, and
that clubs who nurture young talent should register young players and be paid
when those players leave them to join bigger clubs. And so say all of us. The
SRU, apparently, aren't against the idea either.
q KENNY Logan, our very own columnist and friend of Kirsty Young, had a hard
time at the West of Scotland dinner where he was a speaker on Saturday night.
Introduced by Sean Lineen as a man ``with a finger in many parts of the
media,'' he had to suffer one of those balloons in the audience who knew all of
the punch lines, and wished to demonstrate that knowledge to the assembled
masses.
To his eternal credit Logan ploughed on until the end. Jokes that were ruined
were ``David Sole can't be here tonight because . . .'' to be interrupted by
``he's babysitting . . . ,'' and the famous one about the bloke going hunting
and having a hard time from a great big grizzly bear. Which is, by the way, a
belter. Logan alluded to having had some help in writing his speech, possibly
from Kirsty herself. ``That's my script writer sacked.'' said Logan.
The hassle, I'm afraid, is the price of being famous, Kenny, and you'll just
have to find a way to live with it. This is Scotland, whose people, for some
reason, don't like superstars.
q GHK will not take action, but one of the first blows suffered by wing forward
Andy Ness at Glasgow Southern on Saturday was, allege some of the GHK players,
a head butt from tough New Zealand wing forward Glen Remnant. The two players
were having a bit of a ding dong game.
During the second half, Ness left the field on a stretcher and later spent time
in hospital resulting from a Remnant tackle which damaged his neck.
I understand that Ness is now to meet with GHK director of rugby Andy Little.
``I am thinking of retiring now,'' said Ness, who has had a career littered
with injuries.
``There is more to life than rugby and that game put me off. I have to think of
my job, which I like, and I don't think you can have a job and play top level
rugby any more.'' Ness refused to confirm that he was butted, saying it was a
misunderstanding.
Little regrets that Ness is contemplating retirement. ``He's an excellent bloke
and it would be sad if that is what he is going to do.'' he said. ``I really
hope to talk him out of it.''
Ness was told he would require more x-rays after his first batch at the
hospital. The player took it he was a goner, a fair thought given the lack of
movement in his arm. What was meant was that the pictures hadn't come out and
needed retaken. He should be fine.
q SCOTTISH Rugby Magazine has an article this month all about what it calls the
``Natural Ball Killers,'' in other words Messrs Turnbull of Hawick, Ireland of
Stirling County, and McIvor of Edinburgh Accies. The three are depicted in '60s
style suits, just like the film. Veritas is the only possible defence.
q AND finally, congratulations to all at Stirling County, who are in receipt of
the Sports Diary's newly constituted No Foreigners award. The NF award is given
to teams that haven't fielded foreigners to get success in the Premier Leagues.
Stirling are the only team in the first division who can accept this award by
fielding no imports. And there they are going for the title, too.

CURLING
IT TOOK a measure after an extra end, but eventually Scotland's women's team
kept their unbeaten record yesterday at the European Curling Championships in
Grindelwald, Switzerland, beating Norway by 8-7.
Kirsty Hay's team finished on top of their round-robin section with five
victories, and will face either Denmark or Russia in the quarter-finals.
Earlier, Hammy McMillan concluded his round-robin programme with an 8-2 win
over a three-man Finnish team for a 4-1 record and second place in their
section behind Norway. It pits the Scots against the England team of Alistair
Burns in today's quarters.
Against Norway, Hay began with two singles. Dordi Nordby brought Norway back
with a 2 at the third, but Hay drew with her last stone at the fourth for 3
only for Norway to score a 3 at the fifth to level it up again.
When Norway stole a single at the eighth, they led for the first time at 8-7
and, although trailing, Scotland blanked the ninth end to retain last-stone
advantage. They could not score the two shots needed for outright victory and
the teams went into an extra end. Edith Loudon was able to hide her second
stone behind guards to put Scotland in a strong position, although eventually a
measure was required.
With two players injured, Finland could field only three men to face Hammy
McMillan, who made short work of this game, scoring 2 at the first with a good
draw. He followed this up with a single at the fourth end and a 3 at the sixth
when he followed a clearing hit with a well-judged draw.
Scotland stole a 2 in the seventh and, after blanking the eighth end, Finland
conceded. Fifth-round results:
Men. Group A1 - Finland 2, Scotland 8; Netherlands 5, Austria 6; Germany 4,
Norway 9. Final rankings - Norway won 5, lost 0; Scotland 4-1; Germany 3-2;
Austria 2-3; Finland 1-4; Netherlands 0-5.
Group A2 - Denmark 6, Switzerland 7; Wales 1, Italy 6; Sweden 4, England 5.
Final rankings - Italy 4-1; Switzerland 4-1 (game result decides ranking);
England 3-2; Sweden, Denmark 2-3 (play-off to decide ranking); Wales 0-5.
Scotland game end scores:
Finland  0 0 1  0 1 0  0 0 X  X  -  2
Scotland  2 0 0  1 0 3  2 0 X  X  -  8
Women. Group A1 - Austria 7, Denmark 5; Luxembourg 3, Czech Republic 12; Sweden

Denmark 2-3; Czech Republic 1-4; Luxembourg 0-5.
Group A2 - Finland 3, Germany 10; France 7, England 9; Scotland 8, Norway 7
(after extra end). Final standings - Scotland 5-0; Germany 4-1; Norway 3-2;
Finland 2-3; England 1-4; France 0-5.

SHINTY
THE last day of action before the fortnight-long festive break is marked with
derby matches in the premier league.
At Newtonmore, the home side will try to halt Kingussie's seemingly inevitable
charge towards the national league title.
Newtonmore have had a string of high-scoring wins against first-division sides
in cup competition, a draw with Fort William, and then a win against
Glenurquhart last weekend. They fancy their chances, for all that they lost 7-3
when the clubs first met in mid-October.
The Oban sides, unusually, are fighting out the bottom two places. Camanachd
have had a dismal first half of the season. They play Celtic, having captured
three of their players recently and secured Dougie MacIntyre's future with the
club. Celtic have by far the poorest strike rate in the league, with just five
goals in seven matches.
Glasgow Mid Argyll go to Inveraray, with whom they are contesting third place.
Inveraray will have Garry MacPherson back after suspension.
Fort William, chasing Kingussie, visit Glenurquhart, for whom striker Jamie
Bell could return after a broken arm.
Unbeaten at halfway, Kyles should continue towards the play-off for a place in
the league next season. They lead south division one by six points.

SOARING numbers at Oban Livestock Centre have sparked expansion plans at the
#1m facility, opened just over a year ago by the Princess Royal.
There are also proposals to establish a visitor centre at the mart during the
quieter months, telling the story of West Highland agriculture to the hundreds
of thousands of tourists attracted to the area each year.
The plans have been prompted by a series of massive sales in the autumn when
numbers could not be accommodated within the complex itself.
``We are very, very happy with what's happening,'' said centre chairman Mull
farmer Donald MacGillivray.
Costings are now being taken for a covered extension accommodating an extra
3000 sheep along with penning elsewhere for a further 2000.
Mr MacGillivray said he was optimistic the mart would have the increased
capacity in place by next autumn's sales.
Stephen Aitken, managing director of operator Argyll Auction Company, said last
year's record of 6000 sheep on one sale day had been almost doubled to 11,000
this year, leading to temporary gates having to be erected and penning in the
market yard itself.
``So far, the market has gone beyond anyone's expectations,'' he said.

THE likelihood of a challenge to the SRU's plan for districts, and not clubs,
to represent Scotland in next season's European competition appeared to move a
step closer last night after a meeting of the country's top 10 clubs.
The meeting, at Meggetland, agreed to seek further details from the Union on
the cash implications of European competition and, according to the clubs'
spokesman, Boroughmuir vice-president Ronnie Smith, there was general unease
about what he claimed had been the lack of consultation before the Union had
sent out its proposals at the weekend.
``They say they have consulted widely but club representatives here tonight are
very disturbed about what they see as lack of consultation.
``There is little doubt that we have the necessary six clubs in favour of club
participation that would mean an extraordinary meeting of the Union, but we
would prefer to take the issue forward, not by confrontation, but by means of a
forum for all clubs at which the arguments in favour of clubs participating
could be properly aired.
``For instance, we are not saying that all the money from the European Cup
should go just to the participating clubs,'' Smith said.
It seems that last night's meeting was split along 6-4 lines, with Hawick,
Gala, Jed-Forest and, perhaps, Heriot's FP, backing the SRU plan.
Against a backdrop of a threatened referees' boycott of Edinburgh Academicals
following assistant coach David Sole's ``tantamount to cheating'' comments
about referee Colin Henderson, the Edinburgh Referees' Society last night
agreed to take no action until the outcome of today's SRU disciplinary hearing
is known.
Internationl referee Ray Megson has said that he will not referee Academicals
until the matter is resolved.

BRITAIN'S countryside needs more police informers to stem the rising tide of
rural crime, a national farming conference in London heard yesterday.
Intelligence gathering and communications were two of the major weapons that
the police had against crime but this was more difficult to achieve in rural
areas, according to Superintendant Keith Akerman of Hampshire Constabulary.
He said the police were actively looking to recruit informants on rural crime.
This system had worked particularly well in urban burglary and drugs related
cases.
``Unless the public at large are prepared to become involved in this we might
as well pack up and go home,'' he told delegates to the conference on the
prevention and cure of rural crime staged by the English National Farmers Union.
Continuing the self help theme, he said that there was also an acute shortage
of special constables in rural areas. Many of those who did volunteer were not
the right people for the job and of those who were appointed few wanted to
police their own areas for fear of reprisals.
Few stayed very long either as patrolling a rural beat was not attractive to
them. They preferred an urban environment and the excitement of answering 999
emergency calls.
But the real bugbear of rural crime was the demand for scarce police facilities
in urban areas where most crimes were carried out.
Allied to this were the Home Office objectives which demanded a certain crime
clear-up rate.
``We have got to put police officers where the demand is. The public demands
that we do,'' said Superintendant Akerman.
In terms of sheer cost effectiveness, many rural police forces might be
eliminated but chief constables realised they had a duty to cover these areas.
This meant some police houses were being sold to realise assets and redirect
them. Some beats were also being cut or amalgamated.
Volunteers were being used to man some police stations. This was a
revolutionary concept but it was catching on, he said.
Outlining future strategy, he said the police were using a focused approach to
target crime and criminals and adopting more technology to help. More emphasis
was being put on police visibility but this needed the back-up of more
information to be effective.
Co-operation with local councils was being increased but the general public
also had to become more involved. Finally, he urged the media to help reduce
the fear of crime in their reporting. Tony Pexton, deputy president of the NFU
said he hoped the union would give a push to Farm Watch scheme.
``It's making people aware that they can be part of the solution. If we can get
that as part and parcel of some of the action as far as rural crime is
concerned, I think we will have made some progress.''

Volleyball
MIZUNO Malory Lewisham, the English men's champions, have established a new
unbeaten record in British volleyball.
A victory over second-division Birmingham in the English Cup gave them their
seventy-ninth successive league and cup win - beating the previous record set
by Speedway Rucanor 10 years ago. Malory's last defeat was away to Liverpool
two-and-a-half years ago.
Showjumping
THREE of Britain's top showjumpers are looking for an early Christmas present
as they go into the Olympia international championships, starting in London
today.
Michael and John Whitaker, and national team-mate Nick Skelton, will not be
having their sponsorship contracts with Everest renewed when their current
deals expire at the end of the month. And although the company's decision to
end all links with a sport they have supported for 28 years has been known
since the start of the year, no new sponsors have come forward.
That means a trio of riders - who among them have picked up around #1m in
winnings this year and occupy the top positions in the domestic rankings - face
an uncertain Olympic year.
Tennis
SCOTLAND'S Alan Mackin continued his preparation for next week's Orange Bowl
world junior championship, when he reached the quarter-finals of the Sunshine
Cup in Florida.
The 14-year-old from Paisley received a walk-over from Russian Igor Lysoew then
beat Clint Skelwood (USA) 6-1, 6-1, Markus Polessnig (Austria) 7-6, 3-6, 7-6,
and Diego De Cecchis (Italy) 6-2, 6-3, before going down 6-4, 6-1 to Latvia's
Raimond Sproga in the last eight.
In the doubles event, Mackin and Cheshire's Mark Hilton lost 6-0, 5-7, 7-5 to
Canadian pair Paul Esmail and Darren Shaw in the first round.
Scottish No.1 Michele Mair beat Sarah Stanley 6-2, 6-4 before going down 6-2,
2-6, 6-4 to Nicole Oomens in the second qualifying round for the $25,000
Women's Challenger event in Nuriootpa, South Australia.
SPANISH officials are investigating whether Arantxa Sanchez Vicario has been
violating the country's tax laws by declaring herself a resident of the fiscal
paradise state of Andorra.
Tax officials were looking into Sanchez Vicario's case on the basis that she
appeared to violate two requirements of people declaring themselves
non-residents, namely that they must spend 183 days each year in another
country and that their native country should not be the centre for their
business operations.
Sanchez Vicario claimed her situation was perfectly legal. She said that like
other sporting figures, she paid taxes in every country where she takes part in
a tournament.
FORMER world No.1 Stefan Edberg has decided against playing in next year's
Olympics in Atlanta.
``Stefan told me he wants to give the younger Swedish players a chance to
qualify for Atlanta,'' said Davis Cup captain Carl-Axel Hageskog.
Edberg won the singles' title at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics when tennis was
an unofficial sport.

JIMMY Hume, more than 40 years a professional and Alliance member, 31 years as
full pro or assistant at Gullane, and long-time club partner Eddie Wilkinson
regained the Richardson and Brownlee Salvers for the East of Scotland Golfers'
Alliance handicap foursomes at Turnhouse yesterday (Wednesday).
Hume and Wilkinson, who also won the inaugural competition in 1976 and just two

ROUGH diamond sales by De Beers' Central Selling Organisation rose 6.6% to
$4530m in 1995 from $4250m the previous year, De Beers said yesterday.
The group, which handles about threequarters of world rough diamond sales, said
figures reflected increased confidence and demand from retail markets.
Retail demand remained encouraging and current world trends indicated the
diamond jewellery market is up compared with 1994, the South African-based De
Beers said in a statement.
De Beers said its Central Selling Organisation (CSO) and its Russian partners
are still negotiating a vital marketing deal on Russian gems, with meetings
scheduled in Moscow next week. Both parties had agreed not to comment on the
talks.
The current deal, by which Russia sells 95% of its rough gems through the
London-based CSO, expires on December 31.
De Beers wanted to renegotiate the deal to keep a handle on Russian output,
which accounts for a quarter of the world total, and prevent the leakage on to
the market of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of small stockpiled Russian
stones.
Second-half sales by the CSO were a record $1990m against $1670m in the second
half of 1994. The CSO said the second-half performance was better than
expected, particularly in diamonds over two carats.
The statement said expectations for the Christmas sales season were good and,
if economic conditions remained as currently forecast, prospects for continued
growth in the retail sector were favourable.
Reports from cutting centres indicated a recent average price increase of 5%
for gem diamonds of two carats and larger had been ``well accepted and polished
prices in these catgories are firm''.

Darren Rodger asks why homeowners should place their trust in professional
salesmen
IT'S the era of the specialist when it comes to selling houses, and in a
difficult market-place for estate agents it's quality that is the key, as the
Robb Agency can attest.
``We set our stall out on the basis of quality: gimmicks and freebies are
interesting but there's no substitute for quality these days,'' said managing
director Iain Robb.
``If you look at it in terms of the retail trade, we are the M&amp;S of estate
agents. We want to provide volume with quality because I believe that is what
they do.
``That's our company challenge to all personnel: our brief is to try to make
every single person we come into contact with believe that they are the only
person we are dealing with that day, whether buying, selling, or arranging
their mortgage. That's the challenge.''
The Robb Agency believes that in the current climate, unless an estate agency
can bring a property to the market quickly and efficiently, and promote it in
its target market - which these days is UK-wide - then it will not do well.
Consequently the Robb Agency combines traditional skills with the latest in new
technology.
``We believe in a people system rather than a purely computer system - which I
think is different. Basically we have people selling to people, and it works.
But we have complemented them with an ability to promote houses nationally via
a large number of blue-chip companies and their personnel and relocation
departments.
``We are, for example, a member of the Glasgow Association of Estate Agents;
sole agents for Glasgow for PHH Relocation, which is the world's largest
relocation organisation; and we are also appointed by Black Horse relocation
which is one of the UK market leaders.
``So it's really about promoting a house locally and nationally.
``We know where the target market is and instead of waiting for potential
buyers to come to us, we take the stock to them.''
It's known in the trade as proactive selling and that, as far as Iain Robb is
concerned, is the crux. He dismisses the efforts of the legal fraternity to
break into the house-sale sector as ``the supermaket approach''.
``I think a lot of house sellers are wrongly advised. The nineties, without
question, is the era of the specialist and we see ourselves as specialist house
sellers. We are not involved in conveyancing or criminal or legal defence work,
or whatever, we are house sales people.''
Iain Robb likened the situation to the sale of an expensive yacht or car - a
Daimler or Porsche. Anyone serious about selling one would go to a proper
broker or salesman; they wouldn't ask their lawyer.
``The supermarket approach is reactive selling. The buyer has got to go in and
discover it and pick it off the shelf. Nobody tells you about it. That's the
difference between reactive and proactive selling.''
As for anyone tempted to sell for themselves, Iain Robb concedes that if he
weren't    an estate agent he would    probably try to sell his house himself,
but adds: ``Being an estate agent gives me an insight into how haphazard
selling for yourself can be. It really is a shot in the dark and you are
relying on a tremendous amount of luck that the right person is out there at
the right time.''
An estate agent, on the other hand, has specialist knowledge, computer records
built up over many years, with people on the mailing   list waiting for a
particular property.
``It has taken us a long time to develop these systems and there's no way we
can rely on luck in professional selling.''
Iain Robb said he was proud of the sales culture within his company.
``Our organisation focuses on selling the customer's property at the best
possible price and we have a sales culture which says that we are hungrier than
our rivals.''

BEFORE the estate agent came on the scene the public had no-one to turn to but
their family solicitor who would do little more than place an advertisement in
the press and await any calls, according to Mark Adams of G&amp;S Properties.
``There was no follow through, no detailed schedules, no valuation advice, no
local office, no tele-sales, no mailing systems, no separate negotiators, no
window displays, no feature advertising, no competition, and no late or weekend
opening - and little has changed in 30 years. In general, solicitors' offices
do not have professional sales people.''
Property however, like all commodities, needs to be professionally marketed,
and in the mid sixties the West of Scotland saw the birth of estate agents who
introduced some of the above services in response to demands from vendors who
increasingly wanted their properties sold into a competitive market, not lifted
off the shelf at fixed prices.
G&amp;S Properties, a member of the Glasgow Association of Estate Agents, offers a
sales-orientated, family-run business with over 25 years' experience.
One of the most important tasks of any good agent is to operate an effective
telephone sales system where tele-sales staff, every night of the week and on
weekends, glean information about the market by speaking with buyers, updating
their requirements into the system and letting them know of the latest
properties on their company's register that week, thus moving the property
though the market.
Mark Adams believes presentation is important to bring out       the best
features of the property, and agents have a high standard    of presentation,
often competing with each other with original, informative, high-quality
material all set up by the valuer and staff    in the local office handling the
sale.
``The purchaser also needs advice on their own property. For example, how
marketable is it; how fast will it sell; what price is it likely to bring; does
the agent have anyone on their books who may be suitable?
``We have a fully computerised data information system and we are open the
longest hours: from 9am to 9pm Monday to Friday, from 10am to 4pm Saturday and
Sunday, and a 24-hour answering serice.
``Our directors are also happy to provide personal advice seven days a week
from 7am to 10pm.''
The agency G&amp;S provides a full-colour schedule presentation, including internal
photographs, maps, and floor plans; free accompanied viewings; no sale no fee;
full mortgage advice; and a full property management service.

n THE mind-boggling multitude of parties competing for seats in the parliament
aside, the Russian election campaign is becoming increasingly sophisticated:
candidates are mastering the art of mudslinging.
``We will tell scum that they are scum, liars that they are liars and fools
that they are fools,'' Boris Fyodorov, former Finance Minister, now leader of
the Forward Russia movement, declares in a television campaign slot, echoing
many of the political themes associated with Berlusconi's Forza Italia.
Not surprisingly, the list of bad guys compiled by Forward Russia includes most
of its rivals in the campaign.
``If you cannot get things done, get away,'' thunders Fyodorov at a cardboard
cutout of a smiling Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of Our House is
Russia. Chernomyrdin has himself jumped on the mudslinging bandwagon: at a
meeting with Russia's media chiefs he urged them to keep unsavoury candidates
off the air. ``We should not be under the thumbs of fools,'' he said, adding
that many seeking office were ``odious'' or ``simply insane''.
Yuri Vedeneyev, a leading lawyer and member of the election watchdog committee,
assessed Chernomyrdin's remarks as ``impermissible'' for a participant in the
election process, especially for one holding such a high position.
``Politicians of his stature should not stoop to making indecent remarks about
fellow candidates. It shows that our electoral process is far from perfect
yet.''
Many campaign tactics are aimed at discrediting opponents, not promoting a
party's own cause. Forward Russia has erected a large billboard on a major
Moscow highway which reads: ``Fifty million victims of the civil war,
collectivisation and repression would not vote for Zyuganov,'' in a reference
to Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, one of the campaign
front-runners.
The perpetual troublemaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky, head of the Liberal Democratic
Party, confident that his party will grab one third of the seats in the Duma,
is looking further ahead - he wants the presidency for himself.
What about the presidential prospects of General Alexander Lebed, widely
considered a serious threat to Zhirinovsky's hold on the nationalist vote? ``He
would be better entrusted with running a large prison than a super-power,''
snaps Zhirinovsky.
He is by no means alone in his derogatory attitude to rivals. Konstantin
Borovoy, head of the Party of Economic Freedom, took the liveliest approach of
all the candidates participating in a televised campaign. Borovoy is filmed in
front of major Moscow landmarks, pointing out the cultural benefits which come
from private enterprise. He expresses hope, in a dig at Prime Minister
Chernomyrdin, that Moscow's White House, seat of the federal government, will
not become someone's private property. In the background, viewers can hear
voice-overs of ordinary Russian people singing politically suggestive
``chastushki'', or limericks, composed by Borovoy's campaigners.
These rhyming folk songs, often quite earthy, were collected from all over the
country and contained unflattering references to Borovoy's competitors.
``It was almost a bit too lively, bordering on indecent,'' commented Alexei
Pushkov, a TV company public relations director. Court chairman Anatoly
Vengerov was more rigorous, saying that ``Borovoy's chastushki'' violated the
civil code, which prohibits the distortion or use of a person's name in a form
that injures his honour, dignity or professional reputation.
Legal action, however, did not ensue: with hardly a candidate not guilty of the
offence, setting a precedent for further cases could have ground the election
to a halt.
Meanwhile, the print media has picked up the negative tone of much of the
campaigning. On its front page, a popular weekly featured a family sitting
around a TV set wearing gas masks. ``Danger: party political broadcast,'' the
caption reads.

As Russians prepare to go to the polls in the parliamentary elections, John
Miller and Tom Zaitsev look at the issues and campaign tactics
LANGUISHING in a sanatorium outside Moscow where he is recovering from his
heart attack, President Boris Yeltsin cannot be the happiest of men. For this
weekend Russia holds its first routine elections, putting the country's
fledgling democracy to the test and dictating the pattern of Russian politics
for the next six months.
And all the signs indicate that the once-reviled communists and their allies
will emerge as the strongest political group in the State Duma, the lower
house, bent on doing their best to put the brake on Yeltsin's reforms if not on
turning back the clock to the bad old days of the USSR.
President Yeltsin has only himself to blame for the expected strong vote for
his opposition - communists as well as the nationalist right - who have made it
clear they will try to make life difficult for him if and when he gets back to
serious work in the Kremlin.
In the first post-communist parliamentary elections in 1993 the Kremlin, the
country's liberal intelligentsia, and the West were shaken by the success of
Vladimir Zhirinovsky's misleadingly named ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic
Party, which promised to resolve the country's problems painlessly.
The big vote for Zhirinovsky was a protest against Yeltsin's economic policies
which had given rise to rapid inflation and unemployment. More than that, it
was a vote against the political establishment as a whole, against all the
``respectable'' political parties. But another reason was the absence of a
coherent political centre which would have also embraced a moderate and
organised opposition.
Two years on, Russia's disenchanted electorate is having to choose from a
bewildering array of 43 parties and blocs. For the 450 seats - half filled by
proportional representation from national party lists, half contested as
Westminster-style single-member constituencies - there are about 2700
candidates, on average 20 in each constituency.
Seven, perhaps eight, groups have emerged as the main contenders competing for
the votes of a population struggling to come to terms with the loss of both a
political and an economic system, as well as the end of an empire, and now
gripped by gloom and, especially in the case of the elderly, weary of declining
living standards.
Russia's opinion surveys are not especially reliable but they are all insisting
that Russia's Communist Party has made a comeback and that by promising to
restore much if not all of the old Soviet Union it may secure significant
support.
But just how communist is its leader, portly 51-year-old Gennady Zyuganov, a
fairly minor figure in the old Soviet Communist Party, remains to be seen. The
backbone of Zyuganov's support is the elderly, who long for an end to economic
chaos - although Russia's economy is now showing distinct signs of recovery -
and as a start have been promised their pensions on time and in full. They also
warm to his talk of generous universal welfare, especially cheap sausage, and
they share his nostalgia for the days of Russia's superpower status.
At the same time Zyuganov goes out of his way to hobnob with Western
businessmen and politicans espousing a new-style communism which would continue
with privatisation albeit at a slower pace, positively encourage foreign
investment, and unequivocally believes in a free press and freedom of worship.
There are no doubts that Russian politics are a shambles - typified by the
occasional fist fights in the Duma and frequent threats to impeach the
President - but the Communist Party is comparatively well organised with half a
million members and a network of voluntary party workers, and it says it will
be represented at each of the 95,000 polling stations.
Even if the communists do win most seats in the election they will want to
build a coalition with the Agrarian Party, the voice of the agro-industrial
lobby.
They may also try to form an alliance with the Congress of Russian Communities,
the nationalist-leaning militarist party whose main asset is Alexander Lebed, a
maverick paratroop general.
The party's leader is Yuri Skokov, once tipped to become Yeltsin's Prime
Minister, but Lebed's gruff patriotism and anti-Western stance has made him
arguably the most popular politician in the country.
Certainly Lebed seems now to have upstaged Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the flamboyant
mischief-maker whose nationalist rhetoric has since been widely copied and
whose ratings have plummeted since his stunning success two years ago when he
promised voters free vodka.
Zhirinovsky is by no means done for. He is a masterful campaigner - although
his recent vicious personal attack on the ailing Yeltsin could easily backfire
- and he has spent huge amounts on television advertising but he looks like
being eclipsed by a new generation of hardliners, and Lebed for one is sounding
and looking more convincing on the law-and-order issue.
Because the elections are also effectively the equivalent of a primary for the
presidential contest next June, Zyuganov, Zhirinovsky, and Lebed are
desperately hoping for their parties to do well to give momentum to their
campaigns.
Boris Yeltsin, meanwhile, would apparently still like to be thought of as a key
player and while he has not campaigned for anyone he has tried to boost support
for the Government-backed party, Our Home is Russia, headed by Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The Government, in fact, has promised to pay
several months back pay owed to servicemen, pensions on time, and a fund has
been set up to compensate millions of Russian investors who have been victims
of financial swindles.
It may be too late for Chernomyrdin. His party is still marginally behind the
leading pro-Western reform party known as Yabloko and led by the
Harvard-educated economist Grigory Yavlinsky. A bad showing could well lead to
Yeltsin deciding to get rid of his Prime Minister but whether he is in a
position to do it is another thing.
On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out that if Yeltsin's health does not
significantly improve he may decide to stand down himself.
Yavlinsky does look as if he is one of the few politicans worth a vote by those
who fear a communist landslide or the rise of more ugly nationalists. The
Kremlin elite will be seriously embarrassed if Our Home is Russia flops in the
elections, but despite his bizarre behaviour, Yeltsin's tenacity and political
acumen should not be underestimated. He knows well enough that even if the
communists do come out on top in the election and manage to establish a
hard-left controlling coalition in the Duma - which is by no means a certainty
- he is still in a powerful position.
It is worth recalling that Zhirinovsky's party won the biggest share of the
vote last time, some 23%, but no real power, and for Zyuganov and his friends
to control Russia their coalition would have to hold a two-thirds majority in
parliament. Only then could they block Yeltsin's decrees and vetoes.
This is not out of the question but voting for the 225 first-past-the-post
constituency seats may well produce a very large number of independents. So
Yeltsin, even if he is in and out of hospital, will be able to tough it out for
a time with the Kremlin running on auto pilot, ironically just as it did during
the years of Leonid Brezhnev and the Soviet Communist Party. Sunday's election,
however, will establish the front-runners for his job.

<HEADLINE>Further small cuts expected next year as Chancellor and Governor work hand in hand Base rates fall a quarter point</HEADLINE>

A SERIES of quarter-point reductions in interest rates are expected in the
first half of next year after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke,
ordered a cut in Minimum Lending Rate from 6.75% to 6.5% on the advice of the
Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George.
The banks immediately followed the signal to the money markets and cut their
base rates by 0.25% to 6.5%, and the Halifax Building Society led the way to
lower mortgage rates with its second quarter-point reduction since the Budget
at the end of November. The Halifax's new variable rate of 7.49% is the lowest
for nearly 30 years.
It was the first cut in base rates since February 8 last year. Since then the
cost of borrowing has increased three times - on each occasion by 0.5% - to
contain inflationary pressures. Mr Clarke indicated that future changes in
rates would be in quarter-point steps in line with the practice of the German
Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve Board.
The City had expected rates to be reduced by 0.5% either at the meeting between
the Chancellor and the Governor yesterday or early in the new year to boost the
economy which has slowed down sharply this year.
The big surprise was the Governor's decision to go along with the cut. The Bank
of England now believes the Government will meet its target of reducing
underlying inflation to 2.5% or less by the start of 1997. Adam Cole, UK
economist at City stockbroker James Capel, said he now expected good inflation
news when the figures were published this morning.
Sterling took the rate cut in its stride, and its trade weighted index edged up
from 82.8 to 83.0. A cut in German rates is still considered a possibility
after this morning's meeting of the Bundesbank Council. There are also hopes of
lower rates in the US after the Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday.
Gilts took heart from the indication that the Chancellor and the Governor were
now working hand in hand after being at odds in the summer over the need for
higher rates. The response in the stock market was more muted with the FTSE-100
share index gaining 7.5 points to 3662.4.
The cut in UK rates followed encouraging economic news showing a stronger than
expected increase of 0.6% in retail sales last month and a fall of 20,400 in
seasonally adjusted unemployment.
Mr Clarke told a news conference that he and Mr George had agreed the quarter
point reduction in rates was a ``sensible and prudent move''.
He said that in the new low inflation environment, future changes in rates were
likely to be made in ``small steps''.
He said the only issue to be decided at yesterday's meeting was whether to go
for a quarter or half-point reduction in base rates.
They had agreed on a quarter because there were several factors giving rise to
caution on the inflation outlook, including the strength of the money supply,
the weakness of the pound and the strength of the figures yesterday morning
showing a 20,000 drop in unemployment, record job vacancies, and strong retail
sales in November.
``I was satisfied that 0.25% was right in all the circumstances. The thing that
finally decided me was particularly the fall in unemployment and the fact that
retail sales had picked up so sharply in November,'' Mr Clarke said.
``We are now becoming a low inflation economy. We must get used to the
behaviour that comes with that and it is sensible to move by quarter points at
this stage.''
Mr George said he was ``very happy'' to be in a situation to advise a cut of
0.25%.
``I am delighted we have been able to move to a situation where we will, I
hope, be able to move in smaller steps in the future. It puts us in the same
league as other countries which have had stable economies for much longer.''
Unlike at the time of its last inflation report in November, the Bank now
believes the odds have moved in favour of the Government achieving its
inflation target.
``It's on that basis that we have proposed the reduction in interest rates,''
he said.
The Chancellor later conceded to the House of Commons Treasury committee that
he no longer expected his Budget forecast of 2.75% growth to be achieved this
year. City analysts believe lower rates are needed to validate his forecast of
3% growth for next year.
Mr Cole said that, with rates likely to move in quarter-point steps from now
on, ``we expect three further reductions by the summer of next year, taking
base rates to a low of 5.75%''.
The Chancellor and the Governor next meet to discuss rates on January 17. Mr
Cole said: ``If, as we expect, both the Fed and the Bundesbank have cut rates
by then, there is little reason to think that UK rates cannot fall by another
0.25% then.''
He added that yesterday's quarter-point reduction ``seemed to mark a genuine
move to a more gradualist monetary policy, rather than the compromise that was
behind the last 0.25% move in February 1994''.

LIFE is a series of crushing blows. Just when you thought it was safe to relax
into sloth, because 'tis the season to be jolly, and not bother for at least a
fortnight to feel guilty about failing to join up for an exercise class, the
phone rings.
It was one of those perky voices. Would I like a free three-month subscription
to a health club? Frankly, dear, I'd rather eat my toenails. But you let her
twinkle on because she's probably trying to make money for Christmas, and what
a way to earn your corn, cold-calling people who are only de-fleaing the cat so
don't bother to hang up.
It might have been kinder to save her breathy breath, admit she has sadly,
randomly, called a woman whose aversion to exercise and sport is so deeply
rooted in early trauma she gags at the first whiff of Body Shop Coconut Sports
Shower Scrub; a woman who has a fantasy of a wedding service interrupted as a
bare, bandy-legged, horribly familiar, comes round a pew crying: ``There is one
just impediment. This woman cannot do a handstand.''
The gym stood apart from the rest of the school. It was here the gym master
came into his kingdom, a cold kingdom smelling of coconut matting and sweat. He
was a balding, wiry man with the strutting composure of a gang leader. He
directed the pack's attention to the clumsy and the weak, but most especially
to those girls and boys who, in their stupidity, had been assigned to the Latin
class. He only got them once a week, whereas he was allowed to be a vicious
berk three times a week or more to those who did not suffer from Mensa
pretensions.
This was his domain. It was as though he were exacting revenge on us for a
future in which handstands would no longer matter. But God they mattered then.
Those who failed were kept behind, trying and still failing, and nobody
questioned the lunacy of something which would have us there now, still,
flailing legs akimbo, crashing into the parallel bars whilst pursuing
professional lives in spare moments.
Public humiliation was too good for us, although it was his speciality. Pale
quivering figures stumbled at the horse, hung miserably entangled in wallbars
and Tarzan ropes. His gym lessons were an exercise in terror. You were unsure
who, the sports idols apart, would be picked on next.
Sometimes parents could be prevailed upon to write sick notes. He would read
them through, slowly, very slowly, like Stalin considering a stay of execution.
He would them crumple the letter, even more slowly, lift his square gaze to
stare, as if in one wall-eyed glare to impart to us that he knew, he was a man
but he knew, it was impossible to have five periods in one month......
Where were we again? Oh yes, the temptation to a free three-month spell of
torture, sorry, exercise in a sports club. She must have sensed my thoughts had
strayed to long ago and far away and feeding the goldfish in the here-and-now
because she saved her best offer for last. Her persuasive voice threw in the
clincher - a free health magazine.
Only the madly deluded could dream it up. Entire shelves in newsagents have
been taken over by fitness magazines flicking towels at What Next On The
Internet. They range from glossies for the cosmetically clued-up jogger to
hardcore muscle mags. At the soft end of the range is such as Healthy
Lifestyle, which despite its bungee jumping, blow-hole diving, heroic image is
actually more concerned with eyebrow plucking and following the country code
while hiking in brogues from Next. It's for men and women who talk big but want
to have nice hair.
Some are tougher, featuring men who spend all their spare time running,
jumping, shaving their bodies for major swimming contests, and wondering
whether you can pick up skin diseases in the scrum, and women whose figures
look less like humans and more like horses, albeit horses wearing tiny dayglo
microkinis.
It is a world where people are turned inside out with exertion, so that all
their veins appear on the outside, like the lifts on the outside of those big
American department stores.
What happens to all these people when they give up competing in grunting
contests? Do they grow wrinkly and shrink, like your gran, trailing skeins of
excess veins which snag in the exercise machines?
For those of us for whom running around a gym went out with scabby knees there
are many other ways to keep fit. And as soon as the season of sloth is over we
are going to investigate them.

THERE is a growing demand for people to be able to get copies of reference work
off the Internet in hard-copy format, once they have identified what they want.
DocuWeb, from Rank Xerox, is designed for library applications and offers users
global access to collections of important documents on the WWW.
It differs from current systems in that it creates digitised libraries of
formatted documents which are not only faithful to the text but also to the
layout and graphical elements of the material.
User are able to browse the electronic copy, which appears as screen-rendered
images. They then fill in a request sheet, with payment if applicable, and a
copy is dispatched from the WWW DocuWebhost organisation.
Requested print copies can be produced by any of the RX range of Docuprint
series Postscript printers and dispatched by mail.
Another system developed by Rank Xerox for Internet users is InterDoc. This is
designed to allow commercial printers or quick-print establishments to to set
up an electronic storefront on the Internet in the form of a home page, and
receive and produce electronic documents.
Subsequent forms allow customers to give approvals. The forms are displayed
using a standard WWW browser such as Mosaic or NetScape.
Rank Xerox believes this product will not only help commercial printers, but
also assist customers who transfer electronic copy between locations for
printing at point of need. This is particularly useful for manuals and
handbooks that accompany products.

ALTHOUGH global car production in 1995 is likely to have proved flat, the
outlook for 1996 is much more positive with expectations of a 7% advance in
Europe, a recovery in Japan and a slight improvement in the US.
But for First Technology the critical factor should be its increasing success
in introducing crash fuel cut-off sensors and selling its crash test dummies.
It has found a new market for these in a somewhat unexpected area. US
regulations now demand carrycots are tested with dummies with 60 individual
information points, which can mean an individual sale equivalent to about
#50,000.
US safety requirements tend to be the world pace-setters except in cars, where
European tests are more realistic in that they are designed for the much more
frequent glancing crash than the head-on collision.
First's sensors are now being introduced into the Renault, Peugot and Citroen
ranges with likely additional sales in 1996 of about 4.8 million units at
perhaps #2.50 each.
Chairman Dr Fred Westlake is increasingly targeting the Far East too, with
contracts in Malaysia, Korea and further penetration of the Japanese market in
addition to Honda likely.
The advantage is that the UK is a cheap manufacturing base for First, making it
unlikely to want to build a plant in Asia.
In the six months to September, pre-tax profits rose 16.3% to #3.28m on
turnover 10.2% greater at #18.1m.
The current half will benefit from the start-up of the French factory -
although the full benefits will not come through until late next year - and new
contracts with Volkswagen Audi and for new US Ford models.
Full-year profits seem set to increase from #6.27m to about #7.5m to leave the
shares at 440p, down 18p because a broker confused the interim with full-year
figures, trading at 14 times likely earnings, which seems a little cheap.
The interim dividend has been raised 0.4p to 3.2p with an 8p total probable for
a 2.3% yield.

THERE is an argument for the rest of the world dumping its nuclear waste in
Britain; an argument for France testing its nuclear devices somewhere in Kent;
an argument for the fates to plot Britain's economic downfall, though why
bother when the Government is already doing so. There is even an argument for
the rest of the world denying Brits asylum or short-stay visas.
The argument is that top of the pops in Britain today is a song of wretched
yuckiness called ``I Believe''. Bad enough if sung by boy sopranos with
`orrible piping penetrating voices which would have justified Herod's
infanticide if only he had confined it to young boys with high pitched voices,
musical pretensions and over indulgent mothers.
However, the perpetrators of this crime aren't trilling and insufferable boy
sopranos but trilling and insufferable case-hardened actors trying to earn a
few extra bob over the festive period. In the name of Equity, why couldn't they
have done something with a bit more dignity, like picking pockets in the
Cristmas crush?
Any country which wallows in such bad taste deserves all that's coming to it,
forfeits any right to a place among civilised nations, and should be expelled
henceforth from the United Nations Security Council. Who would you rather your
daughter brought home for dinner: General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb army
commander, or Robson and Jerome? Hard one, intit?
But think of the case against Robson and Jerome. ``I believe for every drop of
rain that falls,'' they gush, ``a flower grows.'' For starters that is
debatable. The rain can fall to earth, filter through the soil, gathering
poisonous residues of chemical fertilisers, and by the time it gets to the
burns and rivers be a toxic serial killer of flowers and other flora, not to
speak of fish and their fauna friends.
``Everytime I hear a new born baby cry,'' intone the dynamic duo, invoking
pictures of plump wee babies you see in television adverts, snug in their cots
in centrally heated suburbia - whereas the real cry babies in today's world
come from places like Rwanda, children with the distended stomachs of the
starving, and the glazed bewildered eyes of the very young, not long for this
world.
But shhh, don't spoil the party! Jesus wants them for a sunbeam. Come to church
and see wee Jesus in his crib, and, bayjasus, it looks and smells like a
Beverly Hills nursery. Not a whiff of dung or other odours of where animals
dwell. There must have been hot and cold running water in that stable for the
wee fella is spotless. Not a louse in sight. If you didn't know better, you
would think he was little Lord Fauntleroy.
It's amazing - the homeless in those days lived better than the homeless of
today. See those cardboard cities, they're pigstys.
Now there's nothing wrong with a festive season which allows us to forget, for
a moment, the tribulations of life. There's everything right with sentiments
such as peace on earth and goodwill to all men. The swapping of a few drinks, a
few stories, a few songs, a few tears for departed freens. Even the commercial
exploitation of Xmas doesn't bother me. It's part and parcel of festivals in a
market economy, so we may as well enjoy it.
Celebrations are good for the soul and we should enjoy each other's good times.
But for me the scandal of Christmas is the hypocrisy of the candy floss,
sanitised, thoroughly respectable and conformist image of Christ that is
projected and makes him out to be a Galilean Norman St John Stevas or Lord
Fawsley, as he is known to his friends.
Christ was nothing like this. In life he railed against man's inhumanity to
man, and still had a drink with publicans, which in a social sense is as low as
you can get. So let the baby Christ in his crib be black, for he was black, or
more black than white. Show the squalor of his birthplace to remind ourselves,
and our children, that this was, and is, the lot of the homeless, even unto
this day.
We can celebrate his birthday with a few haufs, even if it's not his actual
birthday. The Queen has an official birthday, so why not Him? But we have to
draw a line somewhere, and that line is Robson and Jerome singing ``I Believe''.
A song is a piece of music with a verbal text. Take the words away and a song
has no meaning, no raison d'etre. A singer is a storyteller. The music helps
set the mood, but can't be more precise. The words do the rest. The music of a
song is crafted to give the words a setting. Without words properly delivered
and understood, there is no song.
Louis Armstrong chewed over a lyric like a child savouring a toffee. His world
was woild, and you can't argue with that. Ella Fitzgerald had perfect diction,
each word had vowels and consonants evenly pronounced, but she really didn't
have a feel for words. She was into the melodic line, and phrased round it,
like a jazz instrumentalist. This is why her singing lacks verbal drama.
The singer supreme who instinctively understood the primacy of the lyric in
song and projected a lyric better than anyone I've ever heard, was Frank
Sinatra. He has had a life-long love affair with lyrics, and that ain't over
yet.
He savoured the flavour of a good lyric, probed the metre, searched for a new
accented placement that might add a new dimension or give a new insight to the
story. Sinatra had a great, expressive voice. Good pitch, never hit a bum note
in his life, and could swing like the great jazz musicians he revered. He had
also that most under-rated quality of all, good taste. I think he's a genius.
Whether the Scottish nation should be autonomously self-governing within the
United Kingdom or independently self-governing outwith the United Kingdom, is
an issue whose day is coming. It's a complex matter involving rights of self
determination and the relationship between large and small nations, within a
single unitary state.
History, culture, the principles of nationhood, differing philosophical and
moral values, should, you would think, come into play. It therefore takes some
doing to drag such a debate down to a squalid hypothetical squabble about three
pence more or less on tax. But somehow our politicians have managed.

EAST Midlands Electricity, one of only three electricity companies not to have
been subject of a bid, aims to keep both its shareholders and customers happy.
The interim results for the six months to September 30 go some way towards this
although the shares fell 36p to 703p, partly on profit taking and also
reflecting market caution about some aspects of the package. This includes a
special dividend of 120p a share (worth #238m) as well as a 7% increase in the
normal interim payout to 9.2p.
As a result of the special payout, gearing, which had been eliminated, will
rise to 80%. Domestic customers are to receive a one-off #54.60 discount,
including VAT.
Pre-tax profits rose 12.4% from #86m to #96.7m which took in #8m gain arising
from the sale of non-core operation Ambassador Security but excluding the
interim dividend from the National Grid which contributed #5.7m last time.
The company has now completed the disposal of its non core activities and its
electricity business restructuring continues.
Underlying earnings per share was up 18.9% from 28.1p to 33.4p.
Chairman Nigel Rudd says that the ``excellent results'' demonstrate continuing
success founded on the company's strategy of of focusing on its core
electricity business.
The next phase, announced last month, provides the opportunity for ongoing cost
reductions and a focus for future investment in East Midlands Electricity's
network. This in turn is expected to enable the group to maintain downward
pressure on electricity prices, improve customer service and continue to
release value as reflected in the special payout (the second following 85p in
November 1994) and distribution to shareholders of the company's National Grid
shares.
The chairman also points out that with a further reduction of electricity
prices of 1.4% in April 1995, the company's domestic customers are now paying
12% less in real terms than three years ago.
In July, the director-general of Electricity Supply announced new proposals
which, combined with the results of the earlier distribution review announced
in August 1994, will reduce revenue from this business by 29% by the year 2000.
This reinforces the need to continue to invest if the group is to be able to
achieve sustained reductions in operating costs.
Group employee numbers have also fallen 8500 to 4680 since September 1992 and
in the core electricity business from just under 5000 to 3885 over the period,
a process which is likely to continue.
As for the prospect of a takeover, shareholders have certainly been sweetened.
But in any event, chief executive Norman Askew takes a robust view, stating
that a takeover either happens or it doesn't and it is no good sitting there
sucking ones thumbs and wondering what is going to happen. ``We have to get on
with running the business and that is what we are doing,'' he says.
A buying spree of the RECs has seen eight of them taken over or under offer.

NEWS of the quarter-point reduction in base rates sparked a mortgage war
yesterday, after Halifax Building Society cut its home loan rate for the second
time in only two weeks.
The decision to ease UK monetary policy was generally viewed as positive for
the housing market and retailers, although the response from the construction
industry was mixed.
Nationwide, the second-largest building society behind Halifax, looked to have
been caught on the hop by its arch-rival.
Immediately after the base rate cut, Nationwide said it did not expect to
reduce its rate again in the wake of it, having taken 0.3% off at the end of
November.
A spokesman said: ``It was the cut we had been anticipating. It is the sort of
cut we would have expected from a prudent Chancellor.''
However, after Halifax announced it was shaving another quarter-point off its
variable mortgage rate, Nationwide said it would cut again to keep its lending
rate below that of Britain's biggest building society.
Later in the day, it announced a 0.21% cut in its standard variable mortgage
rate to 7.44%, matching Northern Rock.
Halifax's quarter-point reduction to 7.49% was followed by Abbey National,
which charges the same interest rate on loans of between #60,000 and #99,999,
Woolwich, Bradford &amp; Bingley, and Britannia. National &amp; Provincial cut its rate
by a quarter-point to 7.54%.
New Halifax customers will benefit immediately from the rate reduction, which
comes into effect for existing borrowers on February 1. Monthly repayments on a
standard #50,000 mortgage will be #14.65 lower as a result of the two
quarter-point cuts, which will produce Halifax's lowest basic home loan rate
since 1966.
Of the major players, Alliance &amp; Leicester was the only one not to announce a
cut in its 7.74% mortgage rate yesterday but it is expected to make a statement
today.
Northern Rock, which cut its standard variable mortgage rate by 0.4% last
month, reduced it by another 0.15% to 7.44%.
Royal Bank of Scotland chief economist Jeremy Peat believes UK interest rates
could be cut by as much as another half-point in the first quarter of next
year, if economic data continues to disappoint.
Geoff Ball, executive chairman of Edinburgh-based housebuilder Cala, welcomed
the quarter-point cut in base rates.
He said: ``In terms of the housing market, I think it is good news and it can
only help.''
CALA is hoping the fall in interest rates will boost business in the south of
England, where it has been selling only about half the number of houses it
would like to during the last couple of months.
Wimpey Homes, Britain's largest housebuilder, also welcomed the cut.
Douglas Symington, who heads up the West of Scotland operations of Wimpey
Homes, said: ``The combination of lower interest rates plus the prospect of a
real increase in disposable income for the first time in four years should add
a little Christmas cheer to the housing market.''
The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents about 90% of UK
retailers, welcomed both the base rate cut and further reductions in the cost
of mortgages.
Although he would have liked to have seen a half-point cut, Tom Muir, BRC's
director for professional services, said: ``It is a useful first step in
bringing interest rates down and we will be looking for more in the New Year.''
Mr Muir hoped the rate cut would have a positive impact on High Street sales in
the run-up to Christmas.
But Balfour Beatty, Scotland's leading contractor with a 7% market share,
believed the rate cut would have little, if any, impact.
Mike Peasland, an Edinburgh-based director of Balfour Beatty Construction,
said: ``I can't see, for the construction industry or Balfour Beatty, that it
is going to make any significant difference at all.
``Perhaps half-a-percent would have given a better signal to the industry -
that might have helped fuel things.''
Mr Peasland's views were echoed by Ian Deslandes, director-general of the
Building Employers Confederation.
Although thankful for ``small mercies'', Bill Anderson, Scottish secretary of
the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ``This is a bit like a nod to a blind
man. We'll wait for the full one per cent before we put out the flags.''
The base rate cut, however, was welcomed wholeheartedly by the Scottish CBI.
Assistant director Alan Mitchell said: ``We are pleased that a prudent Budget
has been followed by this quarter-point cut.''
n THE UK's largest credit card company, Barclaycard, cut its annual rate of
interest by 0.3% to 22.6%.

Andrew Douglas discovers a visible path to a secure future for a shopping area
THERE was a time when Paisley was seen as a handy place to live, only 10
minutes by train to Glasgow's Central Station; but today Paisley is quickly
re-establishing its identity as one of the best places to shop in the West of
Scotland. The one-way traffic that flowed from the country's biggest town had
to be halted otherwise the town centre, the heart of the community, would go
into rapid decline.
But change does not come without the careful preparation of a plan of action
and it has been largely due to the efforts of the Paisley Town Centre
Management Trust, established one year ago, that plans were put into operation
to make Paisley one of the best and safest places to shop in Scotland.
Forerunner to the Trust was the town centre steering group who appointed a town
centre manager in John McLaren. That was in 1990 and McLaren, whose previous
occupation had seen him in the role of Divisional Police Chief, was given the
task of assessing the town's commercial heart and in partnership with
Strathclyde region, Renfrew district, Renfrewshire Enterprise and Scottish
Homes jointly produced a plan that would see the regeneration of the town
centre.
Throughout Britain there were moves for safer cities and towns and one strategy
that had proved successful was the installation of CCTV (closed circuit
television). When Airdrie installed CCTV its crime figures immediately dropped
and a huge reduction in senseless vandalism created a fresh perspective in its
town centre. And when CCTV became operational in King's Lynn, in Norfolk, there
was an astonishing 97% reduction in thefts from cars.
However, such schemes cost money and John McLaren found himself requiring to
raise around #300,000 to purchase and install the 12 cameras needed to cover
the town centre. Months of discussion followed, with a satisfactory conclusion
realising the funding required.
Finance for the project was raised through contributions from Renfrew District
Council, #45,000; Strathclyde Regional Council, #45,000; Renfrewshire
Enterprise, #45,000; Strathclyde Passenger Transport, #25,000 with the rest of
the money being raised among local traders. The local telephone company
CableTel has supplied the cable infrastructure within Paisley, which
represented a considerable contribution to the private sector share of the
funding.
The Trust's main objective is to create a safer town and not to provide the
Police with a tool in CCTV. And although one bonus for the Trust has been that
the Police have agreed to manage the cameras, a first in Scotland, it has been
the case that they have remained very much in the background.
There is little doubt that shoppers will have a greater feel for safety once
the cameras are installed. John McLaren, said: ``In the long-run businesses
will be helped during the day and then in the evening the pubs, clubs and
restaurants - once people are aware that security has their safety in mind.''
John McLachlan owns two shops in the town and he is convinced that the
installation of the cameras will not only be of great benefit to the trader but
also to the general public: ``The installation of the cameras is a first-class
move. It can only be good for the general public, in particular senior
citizens. They can shop in the knowledge that they have nothing to fear and
that those people who are up to no good are being watched.
``The raising of the money by the town centre management group has been a
tremendous achievement. Not only will the public and traders benefit but the
cameras will allow policemen on the beat to operate more effectively.''
Another benefit to traders in town centres where CCTV has been installed is the
reduction in insurance premiums which follows, making the economic atmosphere
more beneficial for shops to trade in.
A major strategy in place over the next two to three years will improve the
overall quality of the town centre. Plans for extensive pedestrianisation will
take in the High Street and Gilmour Street, and areas such as Abbey Close and
Forbes Place will be returned to a quality status to enhance the whole retail
market master plan.
Further to these developments, the building of a multi-storey car park with 500
spaces in the town's centrally located Storie Street will commence in January
and should be completed by Christmas 1996.
But perhaps Sheila Laidlaw, chairman of the Trust, who has a shop in the town's
New Street which has had its windows broken six times summarises the picture
best: ``Being part of the business community, I am looking forward to the
installation of the CCTV. It is important to me that the public feels safe and
secure when they come into town and if troublemakers are identified on camera
there is a very good chance that vandalism will cease. I would like to see
Paisley become the town it once was, a good place to shop and where we can all
get on like Buddies, which we are.''
PLACED in strategic positions, the 12 cameras that make up Paisley's CCTV
system will operate within the town's heart. From the Sneddon, south to almost
Canal Street, and from Lawn Street in the east to the museum in the High
Street, they will pan over an area that is almost one square mile.
Within the control room at Mill Street Police Station the video images are
displayed on 12 dedicated monitors allowing all cameras to be viewed
simultaneously. In addition to these monitors, larger spot monitors are
provided to display the video signal of the camera under control and to allow
playback of any incident.

Whatever happened to technology's promise of the paperless office? Bill
Sinclair looks at the increasing use of printers
REMEMBER all that talk back in the early eighties about the imminent onset of
the paperless office? Well, now.......how many people do you know whose desks
are a paper-free zone, never mind their filing cabinet? Your own, perhaps? I
thought not. In fact, it is likely that if you are a typical white-collar
worker - or, to be politically correct, a knowledge worker - you may be
handling more paper than ever before.
Not convinced? Well, here`s what George Peacock, integrated document specialist
with Rank Xerox in Edinburgh, has to report.
``It is true that in some areas paper is decreasing. Printout from UK computer
datacentres is expected to drop from almost 24 billion prints in 1991 to 17.3
billion prints in 1997. However, output from office laser printers is on an
upward path, from 17.5 billion in 1991 to a projected 36.5 billion next year.''
It seems there is more print being produced in the average office than ever
before.
If you are still not convinced, I suggest a trip to your nearest computer store
may help. Look how much shelf space is devoted to printers of all sorts of
types - dot matrix, inkjet, bubblejet, printjet, laser, LED, thermal,
dye-sublimation, et al.
The clue to understanding why the paperless office has not become a reality
lies in what we use paper for. The vast majority of print in the office
consists of documents: the memos, letters, reports, invoices, schedules,
training materials, manuals and a hundred and one other pieces of paper-based
communication that we come into contact with each working day.
``Documents are pervasive throughout any organisation,'' is how George Peacock
puts it. ``They carry instructions, decisions and information between
individuals, functions and departments. Crucially they act as both inputs to,
and outputs from, almost all work processes.
``Documents, often thought of as existing only in paper form, often exist in
electronic form as well. In fact, the information they contain can flow back
and forth between paper and electronic media as it moves between people,
processes and technology.
``For example, information that was created in a word-processor may be printed
for sending to a recipient. He or she incorporates some of it in a report
prepared on a PC to E-mail to a line manager, who circulates it on the network
to a working group. Then they all print it and bring it to the next meeting.''
Sound familiar? This example of information being transferred between different
documents is typical. What is also typical is that the documents either exist
in paper form in the first place, or will at times be printed to paper.
Why, with all the electronic tools at our disposal, do we still print
information? There are two answers to this, says the man from Rank Xerox, one
practical the other emotional.
``In practical terms, how do you fancy reading even a 10-page document entirely
from a screen? ``For a start, on today`s systems the quality of screen
resolution simply is not up to that of most print on paper. Reading from a
screen is also more stressful in that you are looking at transmitted light from
a light source at close range, and even with today's screens that can cause eye
strain.
Screens also suffer from glare created by overhead lights which adds to the
problem.
``Paper, on the other hand, doesn't itself radiate light. In reading from paper
you are looking at light that is reflected off the surface, which is easier on
the eye.''
``As well as the practicalities, emotions also play a role. Information needs
to be understood. People seem to find it easier to take in and absorb the
printed word when it is held in their hands.'' My own experience of creating
documents on screen, which goes back to the late seventies, bears out what
George Peacock says. Printing out a hard copy to proof-read, rather than
reading a document directly from the screen, is not only the norm in the
newspaper industry but a widespread practice in all offices.
Print has the additional advantage that comprehension is increased through
activities that directly interact with the copy itself; such as highlighting,
and appending notes. These acts increase concentration and focus the mind on
what is being communicated.
So what of the future? Is the concept of the paperless office a fantasy? Not
quite, says the integrated document specialist.
``Although in some areas paper documents are increasing, electronic documents
are increasing currently at a much faster rate.
``Electronic documents can contain voice and video, as on multimedia systems,
and in the future these will become far more common. It is hard to see how such
documents can be fully represented on paper.
``Similarly, hypertext documents, like those on the World Wide Web, do not lend
themselves to print. With their numerous possible connections between items,
either in the same document or in others stored elsewhere, they are not meant
to be read line-by-line, as with the traditional page layout. ``Their value
lies in being able to jump between related items of text with a click of a
mouse. In such areas the electronic media has a significant edge over paper.''
However, to most of us, and for most uses, paper is a comfortable medium.
It is simple, it is versatile. It can be easily copied and sent either by mail
or fax. It can also be used by anyone who can read the language of the
originator, without requiring additional technology.
It is interesting to note the current interest by suppliers of print, such as
publishers and libraries, in selling printed copy via the Web. New products
like Xerox Interdoc and Docuweb enable such organisations to market and
interface their print facilities with the Internet community.
All of which goes to show that it's horses for courses.
You are already able to browse an abbreviated electronic copy of The Herald and
other newspapers on the Web, if you want to.
However, George Peacock suspects that most people will prefer flicking through
the printed pages of their Herald till the electronic world offers a comparable
alternative - a full breadth of editorial, news and adverts in an easy-to-use,
portable and accessible format with a familiar look and feel, and all for 45p.

IT WAS Christmas Eve in the off-licence and the doorbell tinkle harmonised well
with the Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer tape which had been playing
continuously since October. Sammy, the red-nosed server, was puzzled as he
could see no customer across the counter.
Suddenly, a little, sweet voice piped up: ``Two bottles of Buckie, please, a
dozen cans of Carlsberg Special Brew, a bottle of Thunderbird Red, three spiked
lemonades and a slimline tonic for maself.''
Sammy leaned over and was astonished to see Tim, the lad from No 34, who, it
had to be said, was tiny, proferring a #50 note. ``Hurry the XXXX up,''
demanded the young un, ``ma mammy's dyin' for a wet and the bidie-in has just
arrived''.
``But Tim,'' chided the server, ``I cannot serve you with strong drink; why you
are but four-years-old. And anyway, how are you going to carry all this booze?''
``We'll stick it in my pram, dummy!'' And Sammy's old heart melted; it was,
after all, Christmas, the season of good cheer and the kid was hardly likely to
be driving. He reached up for the Buckie when......
There was a flash of blinding light, and a middle-aged man in a red cape and
tights, with the blackest hair since Ronald Reagan left the set, leapt from
behind a mountain of Jacob's Creek and a couple of Blue Nuns, shouting: ``Hold
it right there, kid-corrupter.
``My name is Griffiths, Nigel Griffiths, and I am Labour's consumer affairs
spokesman. This child is a ``sting'', sent to expose evil wrongdoers like
yourself. You will be sentenced to write ten new poems extolling the virtues of
John Prescott.
``Well done, young Tim, here is the lap-top Tony promised you. Now off you go
and kick a Conservative for Christmas.''
Daft? Far-fetched? Couldn't possibly happen in our country? I am not so sure.
In the last few weeks, led, I am sad to say, by HM Government, the nanny
industry has been working overtime. It started with the Mad Cow hysteria -
after all those pies I have scoffed at rugby matches I should be a basket case
by now - but it has moved into overdrive at the mention of the demon drink.
For reasons which I fail to fathom, the Government has sought to establish
``safe'' drinking levels. It has just announced - very smart politics this I
must say - the original levels announced were wrong; we can all scoff more and
be the better for it. Which, of course, is errant nonsense.
There are people for whom one drink would be damned near fatal. I remember
seeing Tony Hancock near the end of his career, indeed his life, and being told
by his manager: ``If you interview him, don't offer him alcohol of any kind.
One beer is enough to set him off - once he starts he simply will not stop.''
And there are others, and let us be brutally honest about this, who can operate
successfully, indeed brilliantly, on vast quantities of booze.
Almost all our great actors were topers. Larry, Ralphie, Johnny, Michael, Sir
Robert Stephens of recent memory, had bouts with the bottle that are the stuff
of legend. Read Stephens' wonderfully bitchy autobiography if you doubt me.
The actor Simon Cadell was talking of Richardson on radio recently. ``At the
end of the play I went back to see him and his dresser poured two tumblerfuls
of gin over which a tonic might just have been waved. Ralph sank his in one and
I felt obliged to do the same.
``Another two drinks of the same measurement were poured. Ralph sipped his
demurely. `And now,' he said, `to enjoy!'.''
If I am speaking at a dinner, any more than a single glass of wine will ruin
any timing I ever had; yet I sat next to dear Chic Murray who downed everything
in sight, slept through the sweet, coffee, and interval and awoke to send the
audience into tears of mirth.
To be sure, Dylan Thomas and Brendan Behan might have lived considerably longer
if they had stayed off the sauce. Would the quality of their work been any
better?
There are no safe limits and the Government should not pretend there are. But,
frankly, what we do with our lives, provided it does not harm others, is for
ourselves to decide. Personal responsibility rules, OK? Life is not safe.
Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the British Medical Association rather pompously
exclaimed the other day: ``Whatever the intention of the Government, relaxing
the sensible drinking limits the week after the launch of the Christmas
drink-driving campaign is both irresponsible and badly timed. The confusing
message about daily, rather than weekly, limits is unhelpful and will be
misunderstood and misintepreted by the public.''
Oh yes, the daft old public again, wouldn't know their apple juice from their
Eldorado. Sorry, Doc, I know you are a very learned fellow and we are just
plebs, but most folk realise only too well when they are hitting it too hard.
In all my life I have never heard anyone exclaim: ``Not for me, I am trying to
keep within the Government's sensible limits this week.''
Any time would have been bad for this absurd sort of announcement. I am
unconvinced, by the way, that there is more drink-driving over the Festive
period; there is just more attention paid to it. Perhaps some smartie-pants
could exlain to me the morality of that position.
We are no doubt just around the corner from health warnings on whisky bottles,
breathalisers for pedestrians, blowing into bags when we arrive at work in the
morning.
We may live longer. It will certainly feel like it.

SIGNS emerged yesterday that the robust consumer spending of recent months was
at last beginning to benefit the retail sector as well as leisure and other
services, writes R E DUNDAS.
The volume of retail sales increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.6% last month
to a record level, well ahead of the consensus in the City. There were
significant revisions to the historic data.
In particular the October figures were revised from a decline of 0.1% to an
increase of 0.1%.
The year-on-year rate picked up from 0.3% in October to 1.1%, but in the latest
three months sales were just 0.1% higher than in the previous three, and 0.4%
above the level of the same three months last year.
In November sales of textiles, clothing, and footwear rose by 2.7% as the
Indian summer came to an abrupt end. This added 0.4% to total sales.
Household goods sales increased by 1.2%, helped by sharp reductions in prices.
The pick-up in sales was foreshadowed by the CBI distributive trades survey,
the British Retail Consortium's retail sales monitor, and strong growth in the
notes and coins component of the money supply.
James Capel's Adam Cole said: ``Undoubtedly the impact of the cold weather on
clothing and footwear sales helped to push up volumes in November.
``But firm monthly increases in most other sectors suggest that this is not a
full explanation.''
In the latest three months household goods sales were 3.8% higher than in the
previous three and 4.9% above the level of the same period last year.
Clothing sales fell 0.6%, but were 0.6% higher than in the same three months a
year ago.
The food sector suffered from the impact of price increases blamed on the
drought. Sales declined by 0.9% in the latest three months, but were 0.7%
higher than in the same three months last year.
The 20,400 drop in seasonally adjusted unemployment last month taking the rate
down from 8.1% to 8% was also above expectations, but the figures were marred
by a 22,000 decline in the workforce in third quarter.
October's figures were revised from a rise of 200 to a fall of 400.
Average earnings growth held steady at 3.25% in October, the same as in the
previous three months.
This is an historic low and is a major factor in the improved inflation profile
perceived by the Bank of England.

AN indication of the rate of growth of the information technology industry in
Scotland comes from two leading companies who see opportunities here for
expansion.
Simmons Magee, a provider of open IT solutions and technical services, launched
its Scottish office in Glasgow in June last year and is already looking to
increase its office capacity in the city. And Brunel IT Services, a Dutch-based
specialist recruitment agency, is planning a presence in Edinburgh and Glasgow,
kicking off with open evenings in both cities in January.
Simmons Magee is one of the UK's top ten resellers specialising in providing a
range of desktop IT services to large organisations. Since it began 15 years
ago it has grown steadily year by year, offering a portfolio of services
ranging from hardware and software supply through strategic consultancy,
cabling design, installation and maintenance.
It has a particular appeal to companies looking for someone to take the
technology, put it together and make it work for them. It believes it also has
a great deal to offer companies looking to downsize their IT operation through
out-sourcing or what Simmons Magee prefer to call co-sourcing.
Simmons Magee now has more than 160 staff spread over sites in London,
Basingstoke and Scotland, with a Manchester office opening in the near future.
The company has always had a strong presence in Scotland, and the Scottish
office has grown month by month since its opening last year to become one of
its most successful and profitable divisions. With a permanent staff of 18, and
a technical to sales ratio of 4:1, it is able to provide heavyweight technical
muscle for any IT project. Expansion is expected to continue through 1996, says
Scottish regional manager Richard Kenny.
Simmons Magee says its success in Scotland is due in part to the recognition by
its staff that customers north of the Border have slightly different
requirements than their English counterparts, demanding a higher level of
technical ability twinned with an understanding of their particular problem -
two abilities which Simmons Magee prides itself on having.
Another factor has been the company's innovative supply chain management
system. This enables customers to pick and choose from the Simmons Magee core
services on offer, ranging from consultancy through to actual installation,
building a solution dependent on the customer needs.
Within these core services Simmons Magee is able to offer unbiased advice
regarding software and hardware selection through its partnership agreements
with over 16 major hardware and software manufacturers, including Bay Networks,
Cisco, Compaq, Digital, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Lotus, Microsoft, Novell, Oracle,
Sun and Toshiba.
The growth of IT in Scotland has persuaded Brunel, which has been operating for
20 years in Holland, and four years in the UK with offices in London,
Birmingham and Bristol, that there is room for another specialist recruitment
agency.
Trish Gittins, newly appointed Scottish regional manager, says: ``When I came
up and talked to people in the industry I found that contracting is really
growing in Scotland, and at the moment there are more opportunities than
staff.''
It is particularly suited to smaller companies, as a cost-effective way to
organise staffing levels to meet peaks and troughs. From the staff's point of
view, contracting provides an interesting and well-paid way of earning a
living.
Brunel says that all of its staff are ex-IT workers, and 90% of them have
personal experience of contracting. And Trish Gittins points out that with
offices in Houston, Holland and Belgium, Brunel has scope to offer positions to
Scots looking to work outside the United Kingdom.

THE roar of acceleration, the smell of burning rubber as tyres squeal out of a
bend and the screech of breaks locking at speeds of up to 40mph as machine and
driver lurch forward into another savage turn, it's all music to the ears of
SuperKart owner James Campbell.
Boasting the largest track in Scotland with over 60,000 square feet of indoor,
heated space to career about in, SuperKart opened its doors in Cameron Street,
Coatbridge, last week to the ever growing hordes of go-karting enthusiasts.
Equipped with 14 Kawasaki Scorpion 170cc karts, this is indoor racing at its
best, and not for the faint-hearted.
Torque and acceleration are impressive (try putting the foot down and holding
the kart on a straight line), ably assisted by the fact that the driver is less
than a couple of inches off the ground. For the average citizen, this is as
close as you would want to get to being David Coulthard.
For #10, a beginner gets 15 minutes practice. For #30 a head, a full Grand Prix
race session is organised, (for as many as half-a-dozen at a time) including
instruction, heats, semis, grand final, winners' podium and the obligatory
bubbly (non alcoholic, of course) thrown in.
Tiny transponders fitted under the karts ensure there's no dubiety about the
winner, even in the tightest photo finish.
All races are marshalled, and two black flags in a row signal the end of a race
for anyone stupid enough to attempt to bully their way round the course.
That said, the pit engineers are kept busy repairing bent axles and bumpers -
though the majority of accidents are the result of over ambitious, rather than
malicious, drivers.
With first-class dining facilities planned and a large conference hall, owner
James Campbell is confident businessmen will jump at the chance of letting off
steam on the track against any captain of industry who overstayed his welcome
at the lectern.
The public, however, will always be welcome. And judging by last week's
turnout, it is off to a flying start.
Open seven days a week, SuperKart supplies driving suit, crash helmet and
racing gloves for all-comers wanting to burn off that road rage in a pleasant
and, more importantly, tightly-controlled environment.
So if you fancy taking the winner's rostrum get the foot down for SuperKart and
really go for it on that first bend.
It's a great way to spin out of the pressures of the working day.

Banking on success: Broadcaster Bill Torrance, vice-president of the Scottish
Wildlife Trust, and Iain Fiddes, the Bank of Scotland's director of marketing
services and public relations, on the banks of the Clyde yesterday to announce
plans for the UK's first National Rivers Centre. The Scottish Wildlife Trust
intends to build the #2.5m centre on the banks of the river at Dalserf, near

YOU know how it is with children and computer games. What better excuse is
there for duffing up the old man (metaphorically speaking), exposing the frayed
condition of his reflexes, and demonstrating his absolute lack of mental
agility in a domestic setting?
There are those who allege, of course, that some games are little better than
vicious fantasies whose effect on the development of children is deeply
pernicious. Here at the Diary we know this to be a calumny.
True, we are not quite certain what to make of Primal Rage (``Freeze Breath,
Snout Gouge, and Power Puke your way to the ultimate Battle Royale in this
smash-hit fighting game.......'') or Syndicate Wars (``Control cyborgs, biker
gangs or groups of religious fanatics in an ultra violent rampage around the
urban wasteland''). Nevertheless, we won't hear a word against the
heart-warming Theme Hospital.
``The sequel to Bullfrog's `smash hit' Theme Park,'' says the brochure. ``As a
hospital manager every decision affects the profitability of your hospital.
Design and run your own hospital through different eras - from the Middle Ages
to Victorian times and the modern day.''
Just the thing, don't you think, for preparing the health trust managers of the
future?
Design your own plague victims; run a state-of-the-art Victorian slum; take the
entire NHS back to the Middle Ages. But, above all, make a profit.
Back to basics
ON the Shetland Islands, meanwhile, they are leaving nothing to chance when it
comes to rearing the money-makers of the next century.
For reasons best known to itself, Shetland Islands Council's education
department has agreed to second a teacher for the equivalent of one day per
week to ``co-ordinate the teaching of entrepreneurship to primary and secondary
pupils''.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise is funding this worthy project to the tune of
#8000 in its first year, but not everyone is enthusiastic.
Councillor Maisie Colligan has observed laconically that ``a primary two
entrepreneur needs to be taught to read first''. Or perhaps they only have to
learn how to count.
Food for thought
THOSE in need of something new for the Christmas table need look no further
than the cookery page of the Highland News. Tired of turkey? Browned off with
goose? Why not try Honey and Lemon Rollocked Gobbleduck?
And what is a gobbleduck? The Diary isn't entirely sure, not least when the
chef writing for the News points out that ``there are some very important
points concerning Gobbleduck and the proper treatment of the bandit'' and
instructs readers to ``turn the bandit pointy end skyward before dribbling
honey over its breasts and laying doobri lemon on top of it''. But of course.
A rollocked gobbleduck, as best as our dictionary knows, would be a gobbleduck
that has been severely scolded. Gobble might be a golfing term, a description
of eating habits, or (it says here) the practice of fellatio. Pretty hard to
swallow either way, we can't help but feel.
Sympathy vote
POLITICS now. Aside from the question of what, precisely, the tartan is that
adorns a leaflet called the ``Tartan Tax Guide'' issued by the Tories (three
fetching shades of blue with red and yellow threads - Clan McMarginal?) you
can't help but wonder if the folk at Edinburgh's Links Place have got the hang
of this propaganda business.
After all, on the reverse of the sheet there is a table purporting to show how
much extra tax various folk would pay under the tyranny of a devolved assembly.
Shop assistant, policeman, school teacher: fair enough. But how many tears will
be shed - or votes lost - over the claim that a humble council chief executive
would be two grand a year worse off?
Family business
AND the latest news from Japan, Land of Innovation, where a ``convenience
agency'' now exists to supply guests for weddings and funerals so that families
will not lose face if attendance is sparse.
Just imagine: hire your very own uncle who no-one remembers apart from the fact
he picked a fight with the groom's father the last time he was invited. Then
again, perhaps not.
Match of the day
A MISPRINT, perchance, in a notice in the Edinburgh Evening News announcing the
engagement of Mark and ``Wenday''. Wenday my prince will come?
Yes, it figures
IT is not for us to say if the National Lottery is addictive (don't bet against
it though), but we do notice the splendid journal Competitors World is offering
the chance for six lucky readers to win something called a Lottery Selector.
``Having trouble deciding which numbers to choose for your lottery card,
finding that the birthdays and anniversary dates are not just bringing any
rewards.....?'' it asks.
Well, the Selector ``solves the problem of choosing those elusive numbers'' -
presumably for the real dummies who can't even think of six numbers.
It may say something about the state of the nation, however, that we are
invited to enter a competition simply to help us enter another competition. For
our part we intend to despatch a valuable Lottery Selector to Edinburgh
District Council, which has just     established something called   a ``Lottery
Task Force''.
Brilliant ..... council tax money spent in pursuit of a slice of all that
``free money''.
Hip socialism
Class War, that balanced and responsible journal, would have no part in such
nonsense, of course.
Dedicated to hunting down scroungers, it has a large photograph of a dear old
lady on the front page of its latest issue and the words: ``Queen Mum: 95 years
of `actively avoiding work'.''
Knighthoods are out of the question, one presumes.
Early first-footer
SCOTRAIL staff in Inverness are stumped, so to speak, according to reports from
their lost property people that have just reached us.
A glass eye left in the sleeping compartment of the London-Inverness train was
not overlooked, happily, but a wooden leg left in the station concourse is
still unclaimed. Staff are keen for the owner to step forward.

THE battle for control of Amec took several new twists yesterday with Kvaerner
chairman Erik Tonseth threatening legal action if the 100p a share bid failed.
In a formal statement before returning to Oslo for a board meeting, he said
Kvaerner's solicitors had been asked to make it clear to the Amec board that
the company reserved its rights. He added that he believed the Takeover Panel
statement on Tuesday might be ``the first chapter in a grim saga''.
The panel criticised Amec's financial adviser Financial Dynamics (FD) for
making unauthorised comments relating to Amec's profits for the calendar year
1996, which found their way into press reports on December 2 and 3. FD was
subsequently sacked and replaced by Dewe Rogerson. The former refused to
comment last night.
Kvaerner, which owns the Govan shipbuilder, is demanding to know whether an
attempt was made to create a false market in Amec shares and if certain
investors were encouraged to buy in advance of the formal defence document
being issued.
Brian Keelan at advisor SBC Warburg observed that people were under very
serious pressure to perform in a bid situation. ``It is unusual for a highly
experienced guy like Tony Knox (head of FD) to dream up a tax charge of 21% for
the financial year to December 1996,'' he said.
In fact, Amec has forecast profits for 1995 and only turnover for next year.
A spokesman for Amec replied that the panel had instituted an inquiry in which
parties were required to give written assurances and were then confronted with
tape recordings of conversations.
Kvaerner has bought a further chunk of Amec shares to push its holding up 0.9%
to 23.49%.
Amec has sent another letter to shareholders asking them to reject ``Kvaerner's
cheap offer'', which closes on Monday.
One suggestion is that, as the outcome may be very close, some shareholders
could be tempted to stay with Amec for a year. Kvaerner will, in any event, end
up with a substantial stake which has been underwritten at 100p and will be
able to resume hostilities after a year has elapsed.
That will give enough time to see whether Amec can deliver what it has promised.

BERTRAND Russell believed: ``There is an artist imprisoned within each of us.
Let him loose to spread joy everywhere.'' That thought has been an inspiration
to people who maintain that access to the tools of creativity should be
available to the whole community rather than the exclusive property of a
cultural elite.
We are addressing the challenge of cultural apartheid. So rather than talking
about theatre in the community, perhaps the emphasis could be changed and the
problem described as a movement towards an integrated theatre. This is a
theatrical dream which has been around for some time.
Things have changed through the splendid work of 7.84, Clyde Unity, and
Wildcat. But admirable though that work has been, it is still usually theatre
for the people and not theatre by the people.
Integrated theatre should be both by and for the people. Artistic excellence
need not be sacrificed. The cross-fertilisation which is the result of having
writers, musicians, and actors from the community as an integral part of a
professional theatre company is energising and enriching. Borderline was on the
verge of achieving such a synthesis and it is a source of regret that the
experiment was never completed.
At Craigmillar Festival Society in Edinburgh I saw scores of people have their
lives transformed through the arts. Superficially, this was a community locked
in a cycle of cultural and economic deprivation, yet I watched young people
turn from a variety of substance abuses to find self esteem through music and
the theatre. Older people who felt alienated and redundant were also able to
find a sense of purpose and meaning through artistic expression.
I am not saying then that arts practitioners should become social workers, or
that standards be reduced to fit whatever is available. The Arts Council was
founded to enfranchise the culturally disenfranchised and if we desert the
people who need the joy of the arts almost as much as they need a job, then it
is we who are the poorer.
THERE is a popular misconception that community theatre is well-meaning
individuals who meet in draughty halls and fit a show around issues of
parish-pump significance. This has never been my experience, but community
theatre will always have different standards from the centres of excellence so
long as they are denied access to the best directors, actors, writers, and
technicians.
And it is easy to assume that socially deprived areas are the only places which
are culturally deprived. When theatre reaches out to the middle class it does
so in a way other groups would find wholly condescending: we seek to placate
rather than challenge and all too often suggest social ills are happening
elsewhere.
When I joined Borderline, the company did three productions a year. I leave
them with a community group of around 40 actors, 16 writers, two youth theatre
groups, an enviable reputation for special needs work, and a single-mothers'
group. So part of the dream has been achieved, and this is in no small measure
due to the support of drama workers and progressive board members.
To them and the companies I offer my heartfelt thanks for what they have
gained. We have squared our consciences with our intellects and done the right
things for the right reason.
n-The discussion, What are the possibilities of Community Theatre? is at
Glasgow's Tramway at 6pm tonight. It precedes 7:84's production of The War in
Heaven.
Tonight the possibilities of community theatre will be the topic of a
Herald/Tramway discussion. Here JOHN MURTAGH, ex-director of Borderline Theatre
Company, puts his view

W.C FIELDS insisted we should never trust a bank manager who kept his hat on,
presumably on the grounds he was thereby perpetually ready to disappear with
the cash. Similarly, a doleful Chancellor of the Exchequer is not a good sign.
Mr Lawson smiled rarely and when Mr Lamont smiled his mirthless smile we wished
he had not.
Chancellor Clarke appeared in excellent humour yesterday as he announced a cut
in interest rates which brought them, and mortgage rates, to their lowest point
for nearly thirty years. The argument over whether interest rates should be cut
or not has swayed back and forth for months. It was always finely balanced, but
Mr Clarke probably has made the correct decision for the moment, especially in
the light of the slowdown in the economy. There is a danger this slowdown could
persist well into next year and, while it is unlikely to become a recession
once more, there is no doubt some sectors of British industry are suffering
heavily and that the building industry in particular is undoubtedly in the grip
of recession.
Other worrying signs include the reports of many companies holding stocks of
products which are well above normal. In order that these may be moved, it
seems certain cuts in production must take place in several sectors. Industrial
investment, that bugbear of the British economy, is far from satisfactory and
the evidence of short-term weakness is worrying, particularly when it is
combined with adverse trends in the economies of our trading partners in
Europe.
In these circumstances a modest cut in interest rates can be expected to be
mildly beneficial. Mr Clarke was wise not to go too far, and equally wise not
to appear to publicly rebuff the Governor of the Bank of England yet again. The
clear signs he gave that further small interest rate reductions will follow are
also welcome, particularly as they appear to signal a new and suitably cautious
way of manipulating this particular element in the economic equation.
The Government also enjoyed good unemployment figures yesterday, which is good
news, and healthier signs within the retail trade, which may be good news but
is just as likely to be misleading. Retail sales are notoriously difficult to
judge, particularly as it is difficult to disentangle the huge swings in
spending, be they seasonal or affected by other factors, from more sober
assessments of the underlying trends. High Street spending is up a little and
we are now in the middle of the Christmas spending swing, but it will be well
into the new year before that statistic, and the effect of the interest rate
cuts, is clear.

MICHAEL Frayn has rewritten Offenbach's story of Helen of Troy and recast it as
a Second Empire folly, an opera within an opera in which bankers and
impresarios struggle to make the most of Vivette, the greatest soprano Paris
has ever seen in silk knickers. The result is operetta, not opera, but it's
Christmas, so who cares.
Ian Judge's production is a laugh. He uses the stage revolve with verve,
whizzing sets, singers and props past us with gay abandon. The proscenium arch
on stage turns to reveal backstage, or foyer, or Vivette's luxurious apartment.
The gags are frequent, some clever. The running send-up of Wagner as Vivette's
company prepare to stage ``the horn of the norns'' is perfect, while the
classical statues that come to life when someone inadvertently strokes their
bums are just plain daft.
Lesley Garett - Miss ENO - as Vivette has the cleavage and flash of thigh for
the role, a personality as dangerous as Joan Collins, and a supremely confident
voice. This woman was born to trill. Neill Archer as the bumpkin composer who
pursues her through an improbable series of disguises is easy listening. And,
in a packed cast, gold stars to Andrew Shore as the calculating M Calcul and
Fiona Kimm as a fiery Froufrou.
Problems? A few. Offenbach is a bit too syrupy for my taste, like eating a
whole bar of Toblerone. The music is bitty, if excellently directed by James
Holmes, and the story line completely silly. But with a bit of editing and an
undemanding audience, it should run and run.

Mark Fisher talks to the man behind a quiet revolution aimed at enhancing
Glasgow's cultural life
LIFE after 1990 was never going to be as glamorous for Glaswegians as it had
been in their Year of Culture. The city had invested so much in its European
accolade, so big were its ambitions, so great its achievements, that a thumping
cultural hangover was pretty much inevitable.
Glasgow since 1991 has crept softly and tried not to make too much noise. There
were of course hairs of the dog. Tramway in particular kept on programming the
Peter Brooks and the Dogtroeps and all those other grand international seasons
in its big industrial spaces. And for all the disillusionment among the
artistic community, there was a perception that the political establishment had
taken to heart the message about the arts being good for the city.
But it only took the departure of Tramway programmer Neil Wallace in 1994 (when
he moved to Amsterdam and set up his own company, Offshore Cultural Projects)
for the whole masterplan to appear, at least from the outside, to be more
insecure than ever.
It's not that Tramway was Glasgow's only arts venue, nor even that it was its
most popular, but it achieved a prestige, a cultural cachet, that made it the
envy of Europe and the symbol of everything the city had achieved in 1990.
As deputy director of the Cultural Capital dream since 1987, Wallace had put
his stamp so firmly on the South Side's former Museum of Transport that it was
impossible to imagine anyone else running the place with such commitment, such
vision, and such passion. A lull in activity after his departure only seemed to
confirm this. But another part of the equation was being overlooked.
Bob Palmer, the soft-spoken, ex-pat Canadian, Wallace's immediate superior and
his partner in the cultural double-act that swept the city off its feet in
1990, was still on the scene and had been quietly revolutionising the way the
arts were organised in the city. As director of the department of performing
arts and venues, a body responsible for every council-owned property from the
King's Theatre down to the smallest community hall, Palmer had been steadily
putting together the pieces of a long-term plan that was as radical as it was
unique.
Even before Palmer's rethink, the department of performing arts was a one-off
in Britain. Of all local authorities, Glasgow City Council is the only one with
a department specifically dedicated to the arts - the others tuck them away
under the blanket headings of education or recreation. It's a mark of the
department's success that the unitary authority which takes power in April is
already committed to keeping it on.
From this unique position, Palmer has rethought the city's arts system from top
to bottom, as arts leaders throughout Britain and across the Continent watch to
see just how well his experiment will work. Rather than having a large number
of council-owned venues, each with its own management, each with its own
artistic or cultural remit, Palmer's plan is that Glasgow will now put those
same venues under the jurisdiction of a centralised team responsible for
programming across the city.
No longer competing with each other, the venues have become part of a single
unit able to develop in the same direction at the same speed.
What this means in practice is that any available piece of art - be that an
exhibition, a play, or a piece of music - should be able to find the home most
appropriate to it. Recent research suggests that audiences are already becoming
less fixed in their ways, more prepared to seek out the things they like rather
than what their local venue chooses to give them, and Palmer believes his
policy will extend that flexibility even further. One dance production might
suit the classical elegance of the King's Theatre, another might be ideal for
the rough-and-ready ambience of the Old Fruitmarket, another still might need
the intimacy of one of the Tramway studios.
With its new structure, the department of performing arts and venues can ensure
that each production gets the performance conditions it requires, while
audiences can start acting on instinct, not out of habit.
``When I came into this job, the department wasn't particularly interested in
the arts or arts development,'' says Palmer. ``Even the King's Theatre was more
of a commercial operation, working on a self-financing basis. The first change
was to create a new set of objectives for the department which centred on
enhancing Glasgow's cultural life.''
To do this, Palmer set up an arts development team which began to talk to
artists across the city - whether council-funded or not - to organise
discussions and initiate debate. He set up the Arts Development Fund to support
innovative, high-risk ventures, international work, and new community projects
that would improve accessibility to the arts. He began, in other words, to
extend the department's remit from a manager of venues to a catalyst for
creativity.
``I began to recognise how cohesive the arts community was in Glasgow,'' he
says. ``There was a sense of co-operation and collaboration that I have never
experienced anywhere else. For that reason the department began to prod and
push in an attempt to influence the direction of the performing arts in the
city.''
That was the fun bit. Palmer was still responsible for three theatres and 13
halls, all of which were acting efficiently enough in their own way, but all
acting autonomously. ``Each one was functioning on a self-standing basis with
an enormous amount of duplication,'' he says. Frustrated by the inability to
take the creative skills of one venue and transplant them in another, and keen
to free artistic directors from their day-to-day management tasks, he began a
process that initially sounds like old-style Soviet centralisation, but that is
better described, he argues, as a shift from a building-based structure to a
function-based one.
First he brought the city's various technical crews together, creating a single
team able to move to whichever site - established or new - that it was needed.
Instantly, it was possible to make a performance space out of the Old
Fruitmarket, then in use as a council car park, simply by redeploying the
central reserve of technicians. Once you would have had to turn the building
into a permanently staffed arts centre, or at least issue a small rain-forest
of short-term job contracts, now it was possible to use it as and when the need
arose. A similar process followed for the front-of-house, property management
and finance staff - no jobs were lost, as is council policy, but considerable
effort was saved now that resources were no longer being duplicated.
The final piece of the jigsaw was the establishment of a centralised
programming team - around six people with a mixed bag of interests but with no
fixed allegiance to any one venue.
``In the traditional model when an artistic director departs, it leaves that
structure exceedingly vulnerable,'' says Palmer. ``I thought it would be far
stronger to look at it as a team whose collective energies would enable them to
do what they're good at, but would prevent the high level of burn-out.''
Having installed the core of the programming team as recently as July, the
process of change within the department is still taking place. This autumn's
Dark Lights series of new Scottish work at Tramway was just the first early
fruit of its labour, and it will be well into the new year before things really
get into gear.
ONE of the advantages of a single authority running several venues is that it
can present a clear and coherent profile - not to say near comprehensive
information - to the public. As far as the Internet is concerned, it's meant
that the department of performing arts and venues has been able to leap
straight ahead with a Worldwide Web site that not only draws together the
city's five main council venues, but also provides citywide listings
information and a detailed database of every arts organisation in town.
Located at http:www.glasgow.gv.uk/dpav.htm and administered by Keith Moore,
editor of the City Live! monthly listings guide, the Web site is nearing the
end of the first stage of its development. Featuring a database search engine,
the pages enable you to request a listing of all events happening on a
particular day within the current two months or to specify your preferred
artform - theatre, music, visual art - and sift through the information
accordingly. The system stops short of selling you tickets on-line - you have
to make do with an old-fashioned TicketLink phone number for that - but the
technology is surely not far away for that to happen soon.
Currently in progress is a site for the city's Hogmanay events, a Tramway
gallery site, listings for January's Celtic Connections and Tramway's spring
season, and an advanced system of links that will move you swiftly between
listings and venue information.

CRIME fighting is a field which has always been susceptible to fashion. When
closed circuit television cameras first made an appearance on city centre
streets a few years ago there was a feeling that here was yet another Home
Office-backed ``magic bullet'' solution which would die a death.
That has not happened. CCTV has proved to be not only acceptable to a very high
percentage of the population but is now, thanks to Scottish Office-sponsored
research, being shown to work. In the past, there was a dearth of reliable
research to back up what most people instinctively felt - that the presence of
cameras was bound to deter the thugs and thieves and, where deterrence failed,
to assist in catching and convicting them. There have already been spectacular
successes in this field in Glasgow where the CCTV scheme is still young.
Early evaluations suggest it is working, that city centre crime is declining,
that people are regaining the confidence to use the city centre even at night
and the feelgood factor is leading to increased sales and profits. In the
Paisley context, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton mentioned some insurance companies
are already offering businesses discounts if their premises are within range of
the cameras.
It is all the more reprehensible that there are still some traders in Glasgow
city centre who are not contributing. They appear to be taking the benefits
while dodging the costs.
The research by the Scottish Centre for Criminology for the Scottish Office
covers a sufficiently lengthy period to give it credibility, so their finding
of real benefits and no displacement should be taken to heart by the
recalcitrant minority. The initial misgivings about invasion of privacy, about
the undermining of civil liberties through the advent of Big Brother, have
proved to be illusory. The liberty of the majority to go about their business
unmolested by criminal thugs appears to be a more persuasive force.
CCTV is not in itself the whole answer to crime but is one more useful tool in
what will be a long, uphill fight. The good thing about it, which Dr Leslie
Sharp, Strathclyde`s chief constable, keeps emphasising, is that the impetus
for camera schemes comes from communities themselves. More used as they are to
kicks, the Scottish Office should take a bow for putting up #4m of new money to
stimulate participation.

WHILE some retailers, notably Marks &amp; Spencer, will be enjoying strong trading
in the run-up to Christmas, it is traditionally a quiet period for MFI.
For it, the post-Christmas sale is the most important time. The financial
performance during it will be closely analysed both by the company and external
observers to assess how successfully the 27 new format Homeworks stores have
traded. If the current 10% improvement over existing MFIs is continued, further
branches will be rolled out from April.
The Homeworks outlets are smaller than traditional MFIs but the selling space
is the same. Improvements in warehousing have reduced the need for such large
retail sites, thereby saving on rent. Maximising returns from existing floor
space is a priority for all successful retailers faced as they are,
irrespective of sector, with continued consumer caution.
MFI's board is not expecting the quarter-point cut in interest rates to have
much impact on the housing market. In any case, as it points out, it has done
well during the past five years when the housing market has been in the
doldrums.
Rather than waiting for the external environment to improve, MFI is busy trying
to improve its own operations. It is confident the investments it is making in
the more attractive Homeworks stores, product development and increased
capability to manufacture products in-house will drive future growth.
Any decrease in own-manufacture sales was a significant factor in the decline
in gross margin. Own manufactured goods are thought to earn 70% gross against
40% on externally manufactured lines.
MFI's short-term future looks decidedly difficult against a background of weak
sales and rising costs. There is better value to be had elsewhere in the retail
sector and so the shares should be sold.
Great strides
PEARSON has made great strides this year with its strategy of becoming a purely
international media group, and it was inevitable there would be costs involved
before the pay-off came through.
The reorganisation has been extensive, replacing the decentralised structure of
a conglomerate with a more tightly controlled and focused company exploiting
synergies between the media interests and gaining from economies of scale.
Reorganisation costs jumped almost fourfold to #45m this year. More will come
in 1996, though not on the same scale.
There is also a shake-up in top management in progress with John Makinson,
managing director of the Financial Times, becoming finance director, in
succession to another one-time FT journalist, James Joll, at the end of 1996.
Group managing director Frank Barlow is fast approaching the age of 65, though
does not look it, and will stay on until May 1997. There must be a chance that
television expert Greg Dyke will be groomed for the post. He is to join the
main board, along with David Bell, currently chief executive of the Financial
Times Group, which includes business information as well as the newspaper.
The bald but bearded Mr Dyke came in with the takeover of LWT and has a
formidable reputation in commercial television. His elevation would mark the
transition of the group into a fully-fledged media empire.
Pearson has a good spread of media interests taking in newspapers, television
production and broadcasting, book and electronic publishing, and computer
software, and it will have the resources for more acquisitions next year. But
it is not all going swimmingly.
There have been disappointments as well as successes and Pearson still has to
prove it can pull it all together and deliver superior earnings growth. For the
time being the shares are high enough.
Getting fitter
EAST Midlands Electricity has yet to spot any potential predator on the
horizon, which makes it one of a small number of regional electricity companies
which have not attracted a bidder of one kind or another.
It is, though, making sure it keeps its shareholders happy and under chairman
Nigel Rudd is becoming fitter and leaner all the time.
True, the 120p special bonus to shareholders costing #238m will put gearing up
to 80%, which is high for the sector. But it should be borne in mind that last
year, after payment of a special dividend of 85p costing some #186m, gearing
stood at 30%. Since then the company has generated #192m, eliminating
borrowings.
There is no reason to believe that the board under its present strategy will
not be able to continue to generate cash and cut gearing in the coming year.
Of course, cost reductions will continue to play an important part in the
group's progress, and it will have to face the impact of July's new
distribution price review which, as has been admitted, will make the going
tougher.
However, East Midlands Electricity is full of confidence and, on its record so
far, this should not be misplaced, though given the happenings among RECs this
year, a certain amount of market caution is understandable.

IT was not their intention, but by their unforgiveable mistreatment of the
dissident Wei Jingsheng the closed minds who run the Chinese regime have shown
the depths of their fears. Wei Jingsheng's alleged crime was to campaign for
democracy. Now democracy is a dangerous thing, especially when it is applied to
the actions of despots. It has a way of illuminating their dingy corners and
laying bare the operation of force which masquerades as legitimate order.
Despots do not like this and that is why Wei Jingsheng, despite the manifest
non-violence of his campaigning, has to suffer a sentence of 14 years in jail.
The actions of this mild if persistent man are hardly recognisable in the
propaganda of the Chinese authorities. He was drafting an action plan, whatever
that might mean, with the express purpose of stirring up a storm sufficient to
shake the current political power. That was the allegation. Having testified to
the impact which democracy can have, we can hardly deny the ultimate
possibilities of Wei's lonely stand for freedom, but the absurdity of the
charges against him are a negation of justice.
The Chinese authorities are clearly in a state of nervous tension, otherwise
they would have treated Wei in a more sane manner. Their tensions are caused by
the contest which is clearly under way within the regime to succeed to the
leadership of Mr Deng. As he is obviously in a state of advanced ill-health the
question is acute, and in circumstances like these the behaviour of the
claimants tends towards the extreme.
The perception within the leadership will be that the strongest man will win;
therefore a dissident, any dissident, must be treated with manifest brutality.
It will, of course, be counter-productive. China's reputation, rarely a pretty
thing, has been damaged yet again by extremism born of fear. China has changed
and will change a good deal more. But if the change is to mean anything it must
be accompanied by humanity and justice for all, including Wei Jingsheng.

HILLSDOWN, the UK food group is expanding its base with an agreed bid for the
Hobson food company worth #121m. The offer values each Hobson share at 31p.
The acquisition is not expected to be completed during 1995. Hobson is the
largest supplier of own-label packaged groceries and drinks products to the
Co-op, its major customer, and also supplies own-label products to other UK
multiple retailers.
The major product categories supplied by Hobson include tea, coffee, biscuits,
cereals, wines, soft drinks and sauces. Hobson's sales to the Co-op are
supplied under an agreement with the Co-operative Wholesale Society which
confers certain exclusive rights until November 1999 to supply products under
the Co-op label and other Co-op brands. The Co-operative Wholesale Society has
agreed to enter into a contract on the same terms with Hillsdown upon the offer
becoming wholly unconditional.
Hobson's sales to other major UK multiple retailers grew by some 20% in the six
months to 30 June 1995 compared with the same period in 1994 and represented
around 42% of Hobson's turnover before excise duty in that period.
In the six months to 30 June 1995, Hobson reported pre-tax profits of #7.1m on
sales of #112.8m. Earnings per share were 1.22p.
Hillsdown believes that there are considerable savings to be made in merging
the two businesses in areas such as packaging, raw materials and head office
costs.
Hillsdown's directors believe that the acquisition will, before taking account
of reorganisation costs, be positive for earnings per share. This acquisition
has not dampened Hillsdown's enthusiasm for other potential purchases.
Sir John Nott, chairman of Hillsdown, said the acquisition was in line with the
strategy of consolidating its existing product areas in European foods and
provided an excellent opportunity to expand its UK food and beverages
businesses.
News of the acquisition saw Hillsdown shares up 8p at 160p.

REACHING the end of an exhaustive three-month tour has double-edged
implications for this production of Harold Pinter's most celebrated play by
Compass Theatre Company. On the one hand the bonds between the already
close-knit cast are intensified, giving an added frisson to Pinter's edgy work;
on the other hand a slight fatigue can be discerned in the performances and
there is an occasional tardiness with the lighting cues.
However, the pluses definitely outweigh the minuses, with the respected
company, who visited the Tron earlier this year with repertory performances of
A Midsummer Night's Dream and Woyzeck, presenting an evening of thrilling drama.
The tale of Davies, the shifty, jibbering vagrant taken in and offered the job
of caretaker in a ramshackle house by Aston, a mentally retarded oddbod and
Mick, his psychotic brother, ripples with ambiguity and charactertistic
non-sequiturs but that very inarticulateness clearly delineates an arena of
fractured relationships, of a longing for companionship which is continually
confounded.
Nick Chadwick's Davies is a study in grotesquerie which fully exploits the
nasty humour of the character, if occasionally overplaying the picaresque
elements. Richard Heap's Mick, revelling in deliberate misunderstanding in
order to further intimidate the tramp, is convincingly intimidating, emanating
tangible menace. However, it is David Westbrook's tour-de-force performance as
Aston which fully realises the nascent horror of the play. His monotone
monologue, when he describes the harrowing effects of compulsory ECT in the
asylum to which he was he was confined as a young man is both chilling and
redolent with eerie pathos.
The production values are excellent with Katie Wilson's design reinforcing the
omnipresent precariousness, with teetering mountains of junk hanging over the
characters.

I AM writing to express my concern about the many unsubstantiated observations
currently being made about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and about the
possibility of its being transmitted to humans as Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease
(CJD).
I am particularly distressed about the remarks made by my erstwhile colleagues,
Sir Bernard Tomlinson and Dr Wendy Grant, because there is no definite evidence
that such transmission can take place.
I shall continue to eat beef, sausages, and occasional ``burgers'' and I shall
not even attempt to persuade my family, including my delightful grandchildren,
to reduce their intake of such foods.
There was a particularly informative series of seven short articles published
in the British Medical Journal on November 25, 1995, the gist of which will be
readily understood by lay people.
The first case of BSE in Britain was confirmed in 1986, four years after a
change in the processing of offal for cattle food. It is accepted that this
offal contained the infectious agent that causes a disease in sheep very
similar to BSE in cattle and that transmission of this agent to cattle was the
cause of BSE.
It was not until 1988 that controls (legislation followed in 1989) were
introduced and this means that beef containing the BSE agent must have been in
the food chain for probably at least seven years before these controls came
into operation.
To get things into perspective, it has to be stressed that CJD is a rare
disease - there were around 30 confirmed cases per year in Britain in the
1980s. In 1994 there were 54 cases.
Thus their number is increasing but during this period, because of the
increasing awareness of and research on these interesting transmissible
diseases in man, doctors have become more aware of the condition and are more
likely to consider the diagnosis.
This, I believe, is sufficient to account for the increasing incidence of CJD -
there is certainly no evidence of a vast number of new cases that might be
expected if a large proportion of the population had been exposed to an
infectious agent that might cause CJD. And, for the reasons I have given, there
must have been widespread exposure to the BSE agent in the 1980s.
A personal experience may be of some interest. I encountered my first case of
CJD in the 1960s when I undertook a post-mortem examination on a patient who
had died as a result of a puzzling neurological disease.
Subsequent microscopical examination of the brain established that the patient
had died of advanced CJD yet the diagnosis had never been considered during
life. I am convinced that the diagnosis would have been made today.
Other relevant factors appear to have been underplayed by those who believe
that there is a high risk of BSE being transmitted to humans.
First, in cattle known to have BSE, the infectious agent is not found in
muscle, fat, or body fluids such as milk. Infectivity is concentrated in the
brain, spinal cord, and eye, and I understand that there are now strict
controls in abattoirs in dealing with such tissues.
Secondly, it takes a considerable amount of infectious brain tissue to transmit
BSE even to another cow by the oral route.
I therefore find it very difficult to believe that contamination of meat by a
small misplaced fragment of spinal cord could be a major hazard.
I am aware of the recent reports of CJD in four farmers and in two teenagers in
Britain but this does not mean that they have contracted the BSE agent.
I would be the last person to suggest that there should be any relaxation of
the stringent controls currently being implemented and I strongly support
further experimental work in appropriate veterinary establishments because
no-one can state with certainty that BSE cannot be transmitted to humans.
On the basis of all of the relevant information currently available, however, I
am of the opinion that there is no justification for the near hysteria being
displayed by some people who believe that there is a serious risk of BSE being
transmitted to man in the form of CJD by contaminated beef.

SHARES in the near 1000-strong Kwik Save discount stores chain tumbled 39p to
519p and just 1p above the year's low after a warning trading statement.
Chairman Simon Keswick told the annual meeting that sales had risen 10% in the
first 15 weeks of the current financial year but growth has slowed in recent
weeks as a result of the intensification of the supermarket war.
This, combined with the short-term costs associated with small store
conversions and last year's major investment programme, has put further
pressure on margins.
He added that 1996 would be a year of consolidation.

<HEADLINE>RETAILING Weak demand  and rising costs push MFI profits down by 31%</HEADLINE>

MFI had warned the City that its sales were weak so analysts were not surprised
when the flat-pack furniture group reported a 31% drop in interim pre-tax
profit to #20.1m, writes NICOLA REEVES. MFI shares dipped a ha'penny to 153.5p.
Weak consumer confidence coupled with the prolonged hot summer weather reduced
demand for its products. This coincided with a sharp rise in costs, notably for
raw materials such as chipboard which rose by 30%. There are signs though that
raw material price increases may have peaked, with it securing its latest
supplies for 5% less than previous contracts.
Chairman Derek Hunt said that while short-term factors had affected profits, he
was confident investments in the business would contribute to future growth.
Operating margins dropped from 8.4% to 5.7% and retail sales per square foot
were flat. However, MFI managed to increase its market share in kitchens and
bedroom furniture.
Gross margins declined from 52.9% to 51.2%. Higher costs including an 8%
payroll increase were offset by more products being manufactured in-house -
these attract higher margins.
MFI remains committed to giving customers value for money and continues to
offer its 20% price advantage guarantee on kitchens and bedrooms. Managing
director John Randall said the group was ``determined to grow market share by
offering unbeatable value for money''.
MFI's 27 Homeworks stores out-performed the existing outlets. The board hopes
eventually to convert all its stores to the new format, although this is
expected to take around three years. Space released from the conversion
programme may be sub-let to other out-of-town retailers. MFI already earns
around #12m a year in rental income.
Four new branches were opened in the period and one relocated, taking the total
to 184. A new venture for the group are its Howden Joinery stores which sell
kitchen and joinery products primarily to small builders. There are just 14 of
these, 10 in London, and initial customer reaction is said to be encouraging.
The French kitchens business continues to expand although trading has been
affected by domestic economic problems. A total of 15 new French stores were
opened bringing the chain to 76. MFI remains determined to increase is share of
the French kitchens market.
Capital expenditure in the first-half totalled #20.4m compared with #15.1m in
the corresponding period last year. By the year-end this is expected to have
grown to around #50m. Despite all the investment, MFI's balance sheet remains
strong with gearing rising from 4.4% to 15.5%. Mr Randall said there was a lot
of headroom in the gearing and borrowing capability ``to allow us to do the
things we want to do''.
Sales have continued to be flat in the first four weeks of the second half. The
winter sale begins on Boxing Day and the group is to make a further trading
statement in early March.

WHEN I wrote of Astronomical Time I really meant Sun Time, that is to say, the
time indicated by a sundial, which shows midday when the sun is due south at
its highest in the sky. This is what many old-fashioned people, working out of
doors, might call nature's time.
Mr Parton's description of the various time sytems (December 5) reinforces my
simple point that on the one hand social co-operation over long east-to-west
distances requires a broad convention of timekeeping while, more to the point
for purely local co-operation, the number of strokes Big Ben puts out from
London in the morning is of less importance in the Highlands than is the
convenience to the workforce there of having daylight on the job.
But I wonder if a new convention of time with an extra hour here or there were
introduced, would the employers or the unions try to gain some advantage by
spurious uses of innumerate arguments fit only for the astrologers and the
writers who go on about an extra hour of daylight?

WHILE I welcome the proposed issue of a #2 coin it is regrettable that we have
to wait for it until 1997.
We were treated to the predictable announcement by the Royal Bank of Scotland
that this would not lead to a change in their policy for continuing with the
issue of #1 notes.
This is a mere marketing ploy which does the public no favours. Admission that
their notes get into a very bad condition when they rub up against change is
criticism enough.
I simply do not believe their claim that ``there is still a significant desire
for the #1 note in Scotland''. An independent poll would show otherwise.

FEWER women in Glasgow run their own businesses than anywhere else in the UK
because of cultural attitudes and difficulties in getting finance, umbrella
organisation the Glasgow Women's Network has revealed, writes ALISON DANIELS.
Yesterday women from a number of business and training organisations met in the
city to launch a year-long programme of initiatives designed to offer women
advice on setting up their own businesses and overcoming some of the obstacles
most commonly encountered.
The network, which includes women from local government and enterprise
organisations, said only 2.5% of working women in Glasgow were self-employed
compared with the Scottish average of 5% and the male average of 7%. The
network's Fiona Forsyth pointed out that this contrasted sharply with
continental European countries such as Germany where 40% of new firms were set
up by women.
The #139,000 initiative, funded by Strathclyde Regional Council, Glasgow City
Council, the Glasgow Development Agency and the European Regional Development
Fund, will include a series of roadshows providing information about
self-employment, the formation of nine projects across the city offering
detailed advice on business development and a schools education programme.
Ms Forsyth said the projects involved a number of key business agencies in the
city which had never targeted women before. ``These projects are ambitious and
innovative solutions to problems which prevent women from setting up successful
businesses,'' she said.
According to Elaine Rodger, assistant director of Glasgow Opportunities
Enterprise Trust, one of the biggest problems women face is overcoming the
macho culture of the West of Scotland. She said they also had to view
self-employment as a positive option rather than a last resort in the face of
unemployment.
Speaking at the launch, Councillor Susan Baird added that it was important to
encourage women because research had shown small businesses run by them had a
better chance of survival than those run by men.
``Women are an untapped resource. With encouragement women can add a great deal
to Glasgow's economy by the creation of successful businesses which in turn
create jobs.''

WE wish to respond to the article by James Freeman (Evil method behind gun
madness, December 7). he refers to the Unity Orange Hall. This is wrong. The
name  is Redding and Westquarter Social Club. It is not owned by either of the
Orange Lodges in the area nor is it registered with the Grand Orange Lodge of
Scotland as an Orange hall.
The social club serves a need in the community and is used by several
organisations.
The Orange Lodges in Redding and Westquarter are part of that community and
have been established there for many years. It is the case in many areas
throughout Scotland, where no Orange halls exist, that lodges negotiate with
the owners of premises within their community, concerning availability and
rental charges, to allow them to hold their regular monthly meetings.
James Freeman then makes reference to ``other venues, including the Orange
Lodge in Slamannan''. We assume the use of the word ``Lodge'', in the context
he has presented this part of his article, is to be taken to mean premises
belonging to the Orange Order in the village.
There are no premises in Slamannan which belong to the Orange Order. The Male
Orange Lodge in the village have met in the church hall since 1986 and the
Ladies Lodge meet in Slamannan Primary School.

THE Herald's recent interview with Labour leader Tony Blair revealed signs of
new thinking on the party's position on constitutional change. The headline of
December 8 about New Labour and the New Union may only have been a soundbite,
but it won't be long before the Labour leadership attempts to replace the
rhetoric with substance and produce the grounds for Labour's ``thinking
Unionism'' to compete with the Conservatives' ``unthinking Unionism''.
To a certain extent, George Robertson has already pointed the way towards the
New Union. In a recent interview on BBC's On The Record, he adopted language
and concepts more often associated with the European Union to describe the
British constitution. What Robertson sought to do was place Labour's devolution
reforms within the context of a British constitution that was anything but tidy
and characterised by variable geometry - with diverse government structures
across the UK rather than constitutional uniformity.
Such arguments pick up the point made by academics such as Richard Rose and
James Mitchell that Britain is not a unitary state but a ``Union state'' which
already accommodates diverse governmental structures and can, through
devolution, accommodate more.
For many years Labour has been discontented with appearing as the party of
Scotland, Wales, and the North of England. In the 1990s, the party's
territorial strategy is very much focused on winning support in middle England.
However, competition with the Conservatives in middle England is likely to be
intense, especially as a consequence of the Tories' decision to place
constitutional change and the Union at the forefront of its attacks on New
Labour.
In the area of constitutional politics Labour faces a difficult time. Due to a
variety of pressures and political motives, Labour has four different
devolution policies for different parts of the UK. It proposes Scottish
devolution within the first year of its government, the creation of a Welsh
assembly, a mechanism for regional assemblies to develop in some parts of
England, and also supports the Government's position on Northern Ireland which
involves the creation of a Northern Irish assembly.
With the exception of Northern Ireland, these are all concessions to areas of
traditional support and they do not address the need to gain votes in middle
England. Indeed, such proposals may cause problems in middle England if the
Conservatives manage to whip up English hostility to devolution.
Talk of the New Union is a direct response to Conservative efforts to
monopolise the Union and British nationalism and present Labour's proposals for
constitutional change in the worst possible light. Devolution has allowed
Labour to play the Scottish card against the SNP. The New Union provides an
opportunity for Labour to play the British card against the Tories or at least
challenge the Conservatives over the issue of constitutional change. By
stressing its Britishness and commitment to a New Union, Labour has the
potential to present a new vision which will promote constitutional change as
the best means of defeating separatism and democratising British government
through reversing the centralising policies of the 1980s.
The New Union isn't merely a theme to allow Labour to play the British card as
effectively as it has played the Scottish card - it is also envisaged as a
mechanism to address the role of Scotland within the UK. Labour will make its
case for a new, diverse Union as an answer to the West Lothian question and the
level of Scottish representation at Westminster. However, it is doubtful
whether the concept can be stretched far enough to get Labour out of the West
Lothian conundrum, particularly because Labour has come up with ``solutions''
to the problem before which were less than convincing.
More optimistically, casting Scottish devolution within a new and diverse Union
may offer some response to the ``slippery slope'' argument put forward by
opponents of a Scottish parliament and is certainly a good way of demonstrating
devolution is not about breaking up the United Kingdom.
How will the other parties respond to the idea of the New Union? The
Nationalists will no doubt scorn Labour's support for the Union and point out
that it proves it really is a Unionist party North and South of the Border.
However, Labour shouldn't worry about such attacks too much. Most voters in
Scotland hold a dual identity as Scottish and British and Labour's New Union
will prove attractive to them even if it is too Unionist for some of the
party's more nationalist supporters.
The Conservatives face a real challenge. They may have lost out in Scotland
because of Labour's ability to play the Scottish card, but Labour is now moving
quickly to embrace a new conception of the Union that will enable it to cast
itself as the defenders of the British and Scottish nations from within and
without - the big idea that undermines current Conservative strategy on the
Union and could place Labour in a winning position in both middle England and
mainstream Scotland on constitutional issues.

ALF Young and Benedict Brogan's exclusive interview with Tony Blair; Douglas
Thompson's homage to Sinatra: James McKillop reminding us of the missing jigsaw
piece in the Oxford murder of Michael Meenaghan; David Belcher's telephone
conversation with Marianne Faithfull; Julie Davidson taking a swipe at our
inability to recognise commonsense when it comes to eating cows; and Jim
Traynor sighing deeply, attempting for the umpteenth time to analyse the
unfathomable Paul Gascoigne.
All made Friday's Herald (December 8) an excellent read, and underlined the
feeling that Friday was indeed Friday, and not a Monday.
And then there was Jack McLean, with his wee gem of an article still trying
valiantly to come to terms with modern technology, using I assume, Humphy
Gogart black'n'white movie typewriter, and a ``bad word'' to get across the
point that there's no such thing as technological progress.
Unfortunately for Jack that same Herald proved to be a virtual nightmare for
his future. For it revealed that at midnight on Thursday last a probe from the
spacecraft Galileo entered the atmosphere of Jupiter after a journey of 2.3
billion miles and at times reached speeds of more than 100,000 miles an hour.
This man-made cone-shaped probe had to hit the outer layer of Jupiter at the
absolutely correct angle, otherwise to be destroyed or lost in space forever.
After a six-year journey, and with the help of computers and other
technological bric--brac, they got it right.
I don't know about Jack McLean but it impresses me.
No more can he skite with the back of his hand anything that smacks of progress
beyond the ballpoint pen. no more can he boast to his friends of his admiration
of William Tell and his gifted eye for hitting targets at a distance.
I have a feeling Jack McLean thinks the last great technological innovation was
the bow.'n'.arra.'

If he wishes to pontificate about the abandonment of principles, I suggest
Jimmy Reid sets his sights much closer to home. In other words this

INSTITUTIONAL investors are now exercising significant behind-the-scenes
influence on the corporate governance of the companies in which they invest,
according to research by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants
(CACA).
The findings precede the launch next month of the Hampel Committee, successor
to the Cadbury Committee on Corporate Governance.
Research author John Holland, Professor of International Banking and Finance at
the University of Glasgow, said such influence often went beyond the approach
recommended by the Cadbury Committee by pursuing shareholder accountability
issues through direct dialogue with managers and the board.
The Cadbury Report called on institutional investors to play a more important
role in securing better corporate governance; to take a positive interest in
the composition of the board; to make positive use of their voting rights and
to disclose their policies on the use of voting rights.
Professor Holland's research, based on in-depth interviews with 27 fund
directors/managers chosen from the top 35 UK equity investing financial
institutions, shows institutional investors regularly intervene and influence
governance issues, usually with the aim of improving corporate financial
performance, rather than ensuring compliance with corporate governance
principles as such. The approach goes beyond shareholder vote wielding.
According to Professor Holland, financial institutions consider a close working
relationship based on honesty, integrity, stable stakeholding and regular
contact to be one of the most effective means by which their influence can be
exercised. Indeed, they make extensive use of these links to influence a
company before it makes decisions on issues such as remuneration, perks, length
of contracts, succession and separation of the roles of chairman and chief
executive.
``Financial institutions often use new proposals by a company, for example a
new executive pay scheme, as an opportunity to raise corporate governance
compliance issues. However, they also use the opportunity to probe whether the
proposals are going to improve the financial performance of the company,'' said
Professor Holland.
Much of this influence and intervention is conducted away from the public gaze.
Fund directors identified the reasons for this as being the libel and slander
laws in the UK, a culture of secrecy and politeness, the speed and efficiency
of the process, the ``clubby'' nature of the City and a preference on all sides
for a private process rather than public disputes.
Professor Holland's research concludes: ``The overall effectiveness of the
monitoring process adopted by financial institutions should not be ignored,
when future corporate governance regulation is being considered.''

REORGANISATION costs will lead to Pearson's results for 1995 coming in below
market estimates, the media group said yesterday and promptly saw its shares
slide 49p to 618p, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Earnings per share are expected to be ``modestly below'' analysts' estimates of
between 29.3p and 34.1p, according to director of public affairs Duncan
Campbell-Smith. Pearson's reshaping exercise will result in reorganisation
expenses of #45m and will also affect operating profits. Changes have been made
at the Financial Times and Westminster Press which should benefit margins;
educational publishers Addison Wesley and Longman have been merged; and savings
have been identified in back-office functions and distribution. Pearson is
confident it will achieve a good return on its cost-cutting expenditure.
Chairman Lord Blakenham said it has made excellent headway with its plans to
build a global television business. Results from the programme maker Grundy
Worldwide, acquired in May, will exceed expectations.
The Financial Times marked time as a result of higher newsprint prices and a
difficult advertising climate, while Westminster Press benefited from doubled
margins. Recoletos, the Spanish newspaper acquired in 1994, is trading strongly.
FT Information is seeing results ahead of expectations from the merger of
Interactive Data Corporation and Extel, which is ahead of schedule.

WELL, this is an odd dish to set before the king for Christmas. The Simpleton,
one of the last plays Shaw wrote satirising the uselessness of human utopias
certainly shows Shaw's intellectual energy remarkably undiminished at 70-odd.
Despite this and Walter's clever, in-the-round production, the play itself,
with its gunboats, descending angels, and reports of uproar on the streets of
London devices feels dramatically inert. Maybe that's because though the ideas
themselves still bubble with life, the plot is, to say the least, limp.
Set on a mythical island, somewhere in the Indian empire, its central theme -
one of renewal, eugenics and the mixing of races - is topical not to say
thought-provoking about how to create better, more morally responsible people.
But it lapses into preposterousness as Shaw shows a quartet of Brits and an
Indian god and goddess polygamously experimenting with love and upbringing, and
scandalising a young Church of England clergyman - the simpleton of the title.
In reality, it becomes no more than an excuse for Shaw to blast off against
Western, particularly English, assumed superiority and complacency.
``Let life come to you,'' declares Constance Barrie's brisk young northerner at
the beginning - a sentiment repeated like a refrain throughout. Life, Shaw
suggests, is full of the unexpected. We should welcome it. Paradoxically, the
play also suggests the impossibility of human perfectness. After all the
experiments, what's left, as in the Garden of Eden, is man and woman, to work
out their salvations - together - a somewhat overworked and familiar Shavian
conclusion. A bauble with teeth you might say, but neither sparkling nor sharp
enough.

WE on Skye are observing the antics of Mr Michael Forsyth with some incredulity
as he runs around warning us about the ``Tartan Tax'' and tries to manipulate
the Scottish CBI into joining him.
The right for some future Scottish Parliament to raise taxes, or for that
matter a Westminster Parliament to do so, does not constitute a tax, as any
schoolchild would tell him.
If Mr Forsyth is really telling us that he doesn't trust the Scots with
tax-raising powers why does he not say so?
This Government is in fact introducing a new major tax, and as usual is
experimenting with it on the Scots by introducing a toll on the new Skye Bridge
which far exceeds any such toll in Britain or in Europe.
I wonder if Mr Forsyth would like to venture an opinion on what effect this
massive Government tariff will have on the fragile rural economy of our island.
Were Mr Forsyth to come up and meet the people who are trying to run businesses
on Skye he would find we are more concerned with real tariffs currently
affecting us than any imagined tartan tax.

I HAVE no sympathy for either the Doughertys or the Hendersons (December 9).
Having the same first names in a family should be illegal. Never mind the minor
problems it causes within the family; you should see the misinformation turmoil
it creates in officialdom, particularly in medical records.
But there is a far more serious problem with surnames on the horizon. It is
becoming increasingly popular for partners to bestow both surnames on their
children. At first this seems a very sensible idea - why should only the male
surname be passed on?
But what happens when one double-barrelled name marries another? Where will it
all end?
Most record systems would explode when fed quadrupalised surnames, and just
think of the size and complexity of the resulting telephone directory.
Could I therefore propose a random allocation of either partner's surname to
the first child with the next child switching, and so on? Another idea would be
the composition of a sort of computer-generated anagram based on a selection of
some letters from both surnames. Any other ideas?
Or is all of this just our society in the throes of a transition where the
female partner's name will inevitably prevail? Would it just be better for us
men to give way gracefully?

ENING the New York Times Magazine one sees a beautiful colour photograph of a
rustic whisky distillery. In elegant type style it carries the headings,
Trekking Scotland's Whisky Trails, and Memorable Excursions in Scotch Whisky
Country. Very attractive.
Under it are seven column-inches of text on Scotch and how well it is doing in
the US. Then it says: Step one - crossing the pond: ``Getting to Scotland and
England from metropolitan New York is simple''. It lists the main airlines that
fly to London, Birmingham, and Manchester.
I had never heard of Scotch distilleries in England.d
Undaunted, the text goes on, ``Spend a few days enjoying London's seemingly
infinite roster of activities''.
The usual sights and attractions are mentioned, and, after pointing out that
British Airways tours are the best in the business, readers are told to contact
our old friends the British Tourist Authority at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York:
``Ask specifically for the London Planner, the London Guide, and the London
White Card Pass to selected museums and galleries''.
The glories of England took up 12!s  column-inches.
My mouth was a bit dry by this time. At last, the text informs that British
Airways flies direct to Glasgow, and that Northwest Airlines flies direct from
Boston to Glasgow.
Many of the best known distilleries are mentioned. The text ends with a panel
explaining, ``What is Scotch whisky?'' I was glad that they remembered to
include it before the space ran out.
The British Tourist Authority is always ready to promote London and England. I
do not recall ever seeing an exhortation to visit beautiful and cultural
Scotland and drop in on us in London if you still have the time and inclination.
This goes on year after year. No-one in Scotland ever does anything about it.

MR BLAIR is quoted as saying ``The Conservatives had retreated from the
business of Government into a dirty campaign of lies and propaganda which
showed they were now training for opposition'' (December 9).
Does this description apply to all parties in opposition?

IN his interview with Anne Simpson on the Royal Opera House funding from the
Lottery, did Jeremy Isaacs really say, ``One swan's tutu alone will cost #300''
(December 11)?
Hundreds of thousands of our people are living in damp, unhealthy conditions
and until that is righted, not one penny of lottery money should be spent
elsewhere.
Jeremy Isaacs quoted from Humperdinck's opera Hansel and Gretel:
``Oh touch me too
That I may see the world anew.''
Right.

CONSTRUCTION has started on the third phase of a light industrial development
in Lanarkshire. Motherwell District Council is building four units totalling
some 24,000 sq.ft at its Birchwood Courtyards development on Strathclyde
Business Park. The move follows the success of the first two phases which saw
all 26 units, totalling some 75,000 sq.ft, occupied within 18 months of
completion. The latest phase marks the district council's final industrial
development before its amalgamation into North Lanarkshire Council.
Gordon Smith, head of estates at Motherwell District Council, said: ``There is
alrady tentative interest in the development from national companies looking to
increase their representation in Lanarkshire.''
The #2m development has secured #772,500 from the European Regional Development
Fund. Strathclyde Business Park is continuing to attract office space users.
Pitney Bowes and Mitel have both taken space within a recently-completed #10m
development which consists of office pavilions ranging in size from 6500 sq.ft
to 9500 sq.ft, and a 36,500 sq.ft headquarters building. The letting agent at
Strathclyde Business Park is Montagu Evans.

Tomorrow is the closing date for appeals against business rates. An extension
to the normal appeals period was announced by the Secretary of State in
September. Many Scottish firms have used the extra time to lodge appeals
against their valuation, but surveyors DM Hall estimate that there are still a
considerable number which have not yet taken action.
``Give your rating surveyor a chance to see what he can achieve on your
behalf,'' said Bob Mowat of DM Hall.

SCOTLAND'S most successful retail park is facing some intense competition.
Recently opened on a prominent site on the city bypass, Edinburgh's 151,000 sq
ft Hermiston Gait retail park has achieved rentals of #22 per sq ft - a
Scottish record. But that record is already under threat from a #25m rival
which has not yet been built.
Construction is poised to begin at Craigleith in Edinburgh's north western
suburbs where a new scheme has just gained an `open use' consent for 107,270
sq.ft of non-food shopping. The development is adjacent to the existing
Sainsbury supermarket on Craigleith Road.
The Craigleith scheme will be carried out by Retail Parks (Scotland) Ltd, a
joint venture between Miller Developments and Stannifer Ltd. The new scheme
will be anchored by UK retailer Homebase, which will operate from a 38,480
sq.ft unit with a garden centre of 11,500 sq.ft. Open consents are a common
feature of retail parks in the East of Scotland, but are almost unknown in the
West. Such consents allow traditional high street retailers to locate on the
parks instead of the DIY, carpet, and furnishing specialists to which retail
parks in the West of Scotland are largely restricted.
As a result, Hermiston Gait has attracted high street chains such as Olympus,
Shoe City, Children's World, and Byte Computers. Craigleith will be aiming to
attract the same type of retailer, a factor which could push rentals to new
records. Market rumour has it that would-be tenants at Craigleith are having to
start negotiations at over #20 per sq ft. But joint letting agents, Peter
Campbell &amp; Co and Jones Lang Wootton, are coy about admitting the level of
rentals being demanded.
``We have only just started our marketing campaign and at this stage we're not
prepared to announce the kind of rentals we are after,'' says Peter Campbell.
But he was quick to point out that Craigleith's catchment area is more
prosperous than Hermiston Gait's, another factor which could boost rents at
Craigleith. Since the Scottish Office announced earlier this year that the
development of out-of-town shopping centres is likely to be restricted in
future, retailers have been scrambling to gain access to schemes which still
have unoccupied units, adding further upward impetus to rentals. Meanwhile, the
traditional DIY and flatpack operators who occupy the sheds on retail parks
have got used to paying rentals of around #10 per sq ft.
It remains to be seen whether they are prepared to compete with high street
retailers at #20 per sq ft or more for access to the more prestigious schemes.
The ultimate winner of Edinburgh's out-of-town store wars will be the Miller
Group. The company is a joint venture partner at both Hermiston Gait and
Craigleith.
