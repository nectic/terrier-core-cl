Medical Correspondent Alan MacDermid reports on the prognosis as
science takes the battle against cancer through the year 2000
MEDICAL science and common sense could combine to save the lives of
70,000 cancer victims every year over the next 25 years. A golden age of
new developments in prevention, screening, and treatment predicted
yesterday could cut the disease's death toll by a third and banish the
grip of fear that almost inevitably follows a diagnosis.
Huge advances in understanding the basic mechanisms of the disease are
soon expected to produce a new arsenal of weapons against it, backed up
by sophisticated screening methods and a network of specialist cancer
centres, according to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund.
Their report, Vision for Cancer 1995-2020, submitted to the chief
medical officer at the Department of Health, Dr Kenneth Calman, sets out
two alternative scenarios for the disease.
In one, the incidence and death-rate rises inexorably, if for no other
reason that more of us will survive other hazards and live long enough
to contract it. The current toll of 166,500 deaths a year will be
222,000 by the year 2020.
In the other scenario, deaths from the commonest cancers will be less
than they are now; a woman with breast cancer will go into hospital,
look at her tumour through virtual reality while her doctor plans her
treatment, have it zapped, and be home for tea.
Some of the changes the ICRF outlines are fairly basic -- for example
the projected drop in tobacco consumption is expected to reduce lung
cancer deaths by 30% from their projected 2020 level.
Other reductions will require more active intervention; breast
screening and combinations of treatment -- surgery or radiotherapy
backed up by drugs -- could cut the 2020 breast cancer toll by a third,
and a reduction of 25%-50% is expected from preventive use of drugs like
tamoxifen. Genetic screening will help to target this to the women most
likely to benefit.
Bowel cancer deaths, predicted to rise from 20,000 a year to 27,000,
could be brought down to 16,000 with the use of endoscope screening of
the bowel.
These are startling reductions within the lifetime of most people in
this country, but they are not reductions from today's figures. They
represent the difference that can be made to the incidence and mortality
if the developments in the pipeline -- not only from the IRCF but from
the other research charities and institutions throughout the country --
come to fruition.
It is a potent message for Dr Calman, a leading Scots cancer
specialist before becoming chief medical officer, first for Scotland and
then the UK. He requested the report to help the Government's Expert
Advisory Group on Cancer plan future cancer services.
The report is also a timely pitch on behalf of the medical community
at a time when the National Lottery has opened the door for research
charities to get a share of the proceeds.
Professor Karl Sikora, the fund's deputy director of clinical
research, said: ''Some new treatment ideas are still in the laboratory
and others are in very early trials with patients. Drug development is a
long, slow process with safety a vital factor.
''Some prospects may come through more quickly than we expect and
others may take longer. Some may not live up to their initial promise
while new ideas, as yet unimagined, will emerge from laboratory
discoveries.''
The organisation of cancer treatment will itself play a part.
Professor Sikora said that if, as planned, all patients were being
treated in specialist cancer centres and units by the turn of the
century this alone might prevent 10% of deaths.
''We know, though, that gradually between now and 2020, a great
variety of new, highly effective treatments will change our whole
attitude to cancer. Today, a cancer diagnosis causes distress because
far too many people cannot be cured. As a halfway house, we shall see
many more people with incurable cancer leading longer, more active
lives, with their disease being managed. But in the future much more
cancer will be regarded as curable.''
This means that psychological support for cancer patients will have an
increasingly important role -- but the report paints a bleak picture of
the breakdown of traditional sources -- organised religion, cohesive
families, and the social services -- at a time of increasinly hi-tech
treatments.
It points out that the quality of cancer care in this respect is
patchy, with patients often not involved in decisions about their
treatment when they wish to be.
Quality-of-life issues are not always discussed, specialist nurses are
available to some breast-cancer patients but not the majority and only
rarely to those with other types of cancer.
Psychological support is generally lacking, and counselling,
complementary therapies, and genuine dialogue between patient and
healthcare professionals are still relatively rarely found in the NHS.
This is likely to change with a rise in patient power and demands to
share in information about their treatments and their impact on their
quality of life.
''By the end of the century it is likely that a complete support
package will be provided for people with cancer,'' Professor Sikora
predicted. ''Specially trained and highly-skilled nurse specialists will
be assigned to each patient to guide them through the complex web of
available services and help to co-ordinate their care.''
Genetics have played a major part in bringing scientists to this point
-- they have found genes that tell cells to multiply and others that
fail so that cells are not programmed to die when they should. The
discovery by Dundee University's professor of biochemistry, David Lane,
of the p53 gene has been a major milestone -- it is responsible for
ensuring that cells die off when their time is up, and half of all human
cancers lack this gene.
Clinical trials are now under way in the US on gene replacement
therapy to introduce the function of p53 into cancerous cells.
Other therapies that are on the drawing board, aimed not only at
killing the cancer but reducing the unpleasant side-effects of many
existing treatments, include:
* A harmless chemical that travels round the bloodstream, turning into
a lethal anti-cancer drug only when it finds cancer cells.
* Antibodies designed in a laboratory and loaded with poisons that can
target and destroy a tumour's blood supply.
* Blocker drugs that stop chemical messages reaching DNA at the centre
of a cancer cell and ''switching on'' the instruction to multiply.
* Robotic surgery to treat organs inaccessible by conventional means.
* Radiation tailored and aimed to fit the tumour and leave the
surrounding tissues unharmed.
By the year 2020, a cancer patient will be able to sit with a
specialist and look at a virtual reality reconstruction of his or her
tumour, the report says. Together they will check its physical and
biological characteristics and agree on a tailor-made treatment.
Professor Sikora said: ''These drugs will not just be the result of
sifting through many compounds, as in the past, in the hope of finding
something that works; they will be based on logical drug design using
molecular graphics to produce novel structures.
''They will be designed to interfere with specific biological
processes involved in the imbalance of cell multiplication and death
that is cancer.''

As others see us: Mary Brennan glimpses a fascinating insight of
Glasgow and its people.
THE woman fiddling in her purse for the elusive ten pence piece. The
commuter balancing briefcase, brolly, newspaper, and take-away coffee as
as she hunts for the phonecard. The fidgets and the facial expressions
that show it's not always good to talk -- Clanjamfrie have recently been
watching it all, and more, through the lens of a video camera.
Filming people using the phone boxes at Central Station is one element
of a research process that will be given an in-progress airing at
Glasgow's Tramway tonight. 7 Minutes is like a trailer for the main
event -- an outdoor procession that will spread over a week in December
and travel around Glasgow, projecting images of the people back to the
people.
''It's about making the private public,'' says Emma Davies, one of
Clanjamfrie's founders. ''We've gone out into the streets and filmed
people doing everyday things: standing at bus stops, shopping, using the
phone. We're looking at the gestures they use, their expressions, the
rituals they use to go about their lives. Glimpses of things. And at the
same time, we've been gathering images of the city. Objects, plaques,
emotions. The whole process is about trying to get a handle on this
thing we call a city.''
7 Minutes is itself, a series of glimpses. It's being set up as a
free, in-foyer event prior to tomorrow night's performance of Theatre
Babel's Romeo and Juliet, then continues during the interval and after
the show. The audience can wander past or stand and watch as the
performers -- drawing on research material -- relate threads of a
storyline that shifts with each repetition, each new perspective. Like
everyday life it is powered by small details, by the interactions
between people that inevitably colour daily routine with change.
Video isn't a main focus of this installation, but it is an integral
part of December's event when some vehicle will carry huge projected
images of people through the streets.
''We wanted people who would never come to our shows to see a piece
which is, really, about them and about the city. So we're taking it to
the streets, making it an outdoor event. And we wanted people to be able
to contribute to it -- so we're going to have these mobile video boxes
in Govan, Castlemilk, Bearsden and the city centre where they can talk
about themselves, what Glasgow means to them, that kind of thing.''
The footage -- shot courtesy of new equipment purchased with cash from
the Lottery Fund -- will be integrated into the final work which is
called Satellite because of the all-seeing nature of the eye-in-the-sky.
Satellites, however, feel nothing. The Clanjamfrie team -- which
includes video-maker Daniel Reeves -- have been at times emotionally
overwhelmed by what they are documenting.
Davies agrees that familiarity with a place can stop you seeing it for
what it is. The camera has caused them all to look closely at the
crumbling structures -- social as well as architectural -- that most of
us bustle past. ''We've been holding on to this quote -- 'a city is a
ruin in waiting' -- because it seems so appropriate. And yes, things are
crumbling, but life with all its faults and frailties still goes on.
We're seeing the loneliness of the city but we're also seeing the joy.
You could say we're celebrating the vulnerability of it all.''
The Lottery award -- just over #48,000 -- has connected the
Glasgow-based performance company to sophisticated technology, but the
heart of their work is still people, and questions of what motivates
them, what gives them identity, what keeps them alive.
The hope is to take Satellite, and its process of research and
documentation, to other European cities either as a performance or as a
blueprint for individual city portraits. ''Maybe it's the millennium,''
says Davies. ''But suddenly it seems important to be out there, almost
scientifically, gathering this information, these glimpses of people and
cities. It's even got a medieval feel to it, recording things as they
were for posterity maybe.''
William the Conquerer ordered a Domesday Book -- Clanjamfrie would
settle for space in a time-capsule for all the Glasgow glimpses they are
currently collecting for Satellite.
* 7 Minutes can be witnessed at Glasgow's Tramway tonight from 7pm --
one night only, free.

Paris
MERCENARY Bob Denard, a veteran of Africa's wars and coups, came out
of retirement dramatically today to take the president hostage in the
Indian Ocean archipelago he once regarded as his fiefdom.
Six years ago, French troops forced the burly 66-year-old former
French Marine Commando to flee to South Africa after he seized control
of the main island of Gran Comoro after the killing of President Ahmed
Abdallah.
He is wanted in the Comoros for Abdallah's murder.
It was the fourth time Denard and his ''dogs of war'' had disturbed
the life of Comoros. In 1975, after the islands became independent from
France, he helped overthrow Abdallah.
History turned full circle three years later when Denard restored
Abdallah to power in a mercenary invasion.
Denard, who has a Comorian wife, took the Muslim name Said Moustapha
M'adhjou and became the powerful head of a 500-strong presidential guard
led by 30 white mercenaries, most of them French.
Abdallah was killed in 1989 by an anti-tank missile fired through his
bedroom window. Diplomats blamed members of the South African-financed
presidential guard.
Denard took control of the island but was forced to escape to South
Africa three weeks later as French forces approached.
He chose to return to France and face justice in 1993 and was given a
five-year suspended sentence in connection with an abortive mercenary
invasion of then Marxist-ruled Benin in 1977.
He appeared to have put a life of fighting behind him for peaceful
retirement in his home village of Grayan-et-l'Hopital, in the Bordeaux
wine-growing region of south-western France.
He starred in a television film of his life, published his memoirs
under the title King of Fortune and was planning to open a museum on
decolonisation and a fitness centre.
Denard once said he made up his mind early in life to see the world
and make a fortune. He has been to every continent as a mercenary,
married six times across the world, and fathered seven
children.--Reuter.

THOUSANDS of Jewish settlers thronged Hebron to protest against the
West Bank self-rule accord as it was being sealed in Washington.
The settlers, 400 of whom live in Hebron among 100,000 Palestinians,
assailed their government for giving up on their dream of a ''Greater
Israel'', the Biblical homeland of the Jews that they say covers the
whole West Bank.
''It's a day of disaster for Israel,'' said Itzik Weinberg, 17.
''They're leaving us at the mercy of the Arabs.'' Palestinians said
settlers smashed at least four of their cars and stoned windows of nine
houses.
Many Palestinians were also unhappy with the self-rule deal.
''The PLO has given away everything to the Israelis,'' said Taher
Dweik, who was released today after 12 years in an Israeli jail. He was
imprisoned at 18 for working for Fatah, the secular wing of the PLO.

WITH the opening of Vroni's in West Nile Street, Glasgow city centre
at last has a wine bar worthy of the name, taking itself seriously. A
sensibly priced list of over 100 skillfully chosen wines from around the
world -- 10 always available by the glass -- has to be good news for
wine lovers with a thirst for knowledge.
Situated next door to an international hair stylist and round the
corner from a well-known bookseller with an above average selection of
vinous volumes, it makes the perfect embarkation point for a voyage of
discovery on the red and white seas seven days a week.
Alan Tomkins, who opened the popular Scottish cuisine specialist
restaurant Papingo in a Bath Street basement seven years ago, is no
stranger to the serious wine bar trade. He was one of the original
owners of Lautrec's in the Park area of town in its heyday and now feels
that the time is right for a further venture along the pleasant
non-plonk path. Relying on the expertise of Glasgow wine merchant Fraser
Alexander he has built up his list of value for money bottles to
educated the palate and cater for the demand engendered by Oz, Jilly and
the colour supplements.
Vroni's has an international ring to it and so it should. The ski
family Tomkins was on a winter break in Austria earlier in the year when
word was received that the bid for the West Nile Street business had
been successful. They had enjoyed the ambience of a bar called Vroni's
during their stay so the name stuck, especially after a bumper
celebration.
Open from 9am until midnight form Monday to Saturday and from 6pm on
Sundays, food plays an important part in the proceedings. Coffee and
croissants start the day in continental style with home cooking
available until 8pm and puddings right through to closing time. Cheese
has become an accepted accompaniment to wine and vice versa and the
cheese platter large or small with oatcakes is already a much requested
snack.
Coffee is served in four different ways from espresso to machiato with
frothing milk and top of the draught beers is Budweiser Budvar at #2 the
pint, #1 the half-pint until the end of October.
Only upmarket spirits grace the gantry to be served by the obligatory
EC metric measure. They include Johnnie Walker Black Label, Bombay
Sapphire Gin, Wodka Wybarowa from Poland and The Macallan 10 year-old
from Craigellachie in Morayshire. There is always a wine of the week at
a special price and lots of imported beers by the bottle. For thirst
they're fast. . .
Vroni's has to be one of the few establishments in town to have an
enlightened policy where champagne is concerned. It is offering
Laurent-Perrier Brut as the house bubbly at the bargain price of #19.95
a bottle.
This is not a battery acid tasting BOB or ''buyer's own brand'' but a
renowned label which is fifth best seller in the champagne markets of
the world. If you want a glass of the fizz that refreshes you will be
sold a quarter-bottle at #6.25 which gives you the equivalent of two.
You can't do better than that. Other champagnes at very agreeable prices
are Laurnet-Perrier 1988 Vintage at #27.50 and Bollinger Special Cuvee
Brut at #28.95.
There is a small carte of half-bottles for those who like to get back
to work after lunch or who are eating on their own. Remember, a
half-bottle should yield three glasses, enough for an abstemious
twosome.
On the food front there are lots of relatively inexpensive items on
the menu. Before noon, for example, a croissant with butter and jam plus
coffee is #1.95. At lunchtime soup and crusty bread and butter is #1.75
and chilli con carne with either pitta bread or rice is a filling #3.95.
There is a choice of crepes throughout the day, a satay with peanut
sauce and wild rice for #3.50 until 9pm and even bratwurst or bierwurst
with sauerkraut when special orders are being prepared. Plates of
antipasti, game pie and luxury canapes are also available at affordable
prices.
Light wood flooring, green leather buttoned seating with back mirror
panels, Viennese bentwood chairs, a whirling ceiling fan and a modernist
brass chandelier lend a European cum New York air. The long dark wood
bar with comfortable tall stools and a pyramid wine rack top plus an
intimate mezzanine with wrought iron based tables make central Glasgow
seem miles away.
The house wines available by the bottle or the glass are priced
reasonably and served generously. Australia, France, Hungary and Spain
are the current countries and English winemaker Hugh Ryman is a worthy
contributor to the list.
The main list features wines from France, Germany, Italy and Spain and
New World countries like Argentina, Australia, North America, Chile, New
Zealand and South Africa.

THE Kelvin Park Lorne Hotel in Sauchiehall Street has recently
undergone extensive refurbishment, making it the ideal venue for
conferences or banqueting events.
The first phase involved Newbery's Bar, where Glasgow-based designers
Thomson McLeod were careful to retain the Rennie Mackintosh
Glasgow-style decor.
The refurbishment programme then moved on to a second phase, taking in
the public areas on the ground floor including the reception and the
foyer, as well as the five ground floor conference rooms The first-floor
banqueting suite, which contains three rooms -- the King's, the Queen's
and the Braemar suite -- was also redecorated.
The third stage comprised the upgrading and refurbishment of
two-thirds of the Lorne wing of the hotel -- a total of 55 bedrooms.
Early next year the remainder of the bedrooms in both the Lorne and
the Apsley wings will be upgraded and general manager Kevin McAlpine
hopes the operation complete by March. ''We are also awaiting planning
consent for the painting of the exterior of the entire building. In
particular the repainting of the exterior of the Apsley building will
enhance the high quality of the interior of this A-listed building,'' he
said.
The hotel has 99 bedrooms, 19 of them superior rooms with period
cornicing in the Apsley wing. Several rooms also have marble fireplaces
and four-poster beds. The rooms, which are all en suite, are slightly
larger than those in the Lorne wing. ''We have a special autumn
promotion which will allow people to enjoy the Victorian splendour of
these rooms for #65 including breakfast for single occupancy and #75 for
double occupancy,'' said Kevin McAlpine.
The Lorne wing offers 80 comfortable double and twin en suite rooms.
These are also available under the autumn promotion at #53.50 for single
occupancy including breakfast and #63.50 for double occupancy.
The hotel restaurant, Seasons Brasserie, is on the ground floor.
General manager Kevin McAlpine described this as ''an unconventional
hotel restaurant, because the overall decor and ambiance is different
from the normal hotel dining room.'' he said.
Conferences are a major feature of the hotel's business. ''We can
accommodate conferences ranging from 10 to 200 people, from individual
training seminars to major product launches,'' said Kevin McAlpine.
The Apsley wing has five conference rooms: the Earl, the Prince, the
Princess, the Viscount and the Duke. Three of these rooms can be used
individually for around a dozen people, or they can be used jointly to
accommodate up to 60.
In the Lorne wing there are three conference rooms, the Braemar, the
King's and the Queen's. These can also be used separately or jointly to
accommodate 200. These suites are currently very popular for larger
weddings and conferences and promotional business launches, while over
the festive season they are ideal for parties both large and small.
On Sunday, October 8, the hotel is hosting a wedding fayre, with all
proceeds going to charity.
Event co-ordinator Colette McCloskey said: ''The hotel will be
transformed both inside and out. At the front there will be three
vintage cars: a limousine, a Daimler and a Rolls Royce, plus a couple of
coaches to create a wedding atmosphere.''
Exhibitors include the House of Fraser's wedding list service, Norma
Ann Photography, the Rainbow Room, the Mad Hatter, kilt hirers McDonald
and McKay, Aisle Wedding Cars and Silver Choice. A designer of hand-made
stationery, a calligrapher, Lillian's Flower Shop, The Ringmaker of
Princes Square and a host of other specialists will also be there.
There will be two fashion shows by Roberta Buchan -- one at 2pm and
the other at 3.15pm -- which will provide brides-to-be with an excellent
opportunity to view her collection. There will be a prize draw offering
vouchers from Roberta Buchan -- #300 for a dress and #100 for bridal
accessories -- and a host of other prizes.
Entry to the wedding fayre, which starts at 1pm and ends at 5pm is
free. Staff from Marie Curie Cancer Care, who will be receiving all
proceeds, will be on hand to provide information.

NEW ENTRANT
SCOTTISH Pride, the dairy products company owned by 3000 Scottish
farmers, joins the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on the stock
exchange today with a warning that trading conditions remain tough,
writes ROBERT POWELL.
Scottish Pride said milk prices had risen as a result of the summer
drought and packaging prices had also increased, but the company had
been unable to pass on these additional costs to the consumer.
''With trading in the markets for our products continuing to be
difficult, and fierce competition for supermarket business showing
little sign of abatement, there is little scope for recovering the
increasing costs that are flowing through from our suppliers,'' it said.
''These uncertainties . . . make it difficult to predict the outcome
of the current financial year,'' the company added.
Scottish Pride made a pre-tax profit of #730,000 on turnover of
#164.1m in the 12 months to April 1.
The company was created on November 1 last year when the Scottish Milk
Marketing Board was broken up with the deregulation of the milk
industry.
Since then Scottish Pride shares have traded irregularly on the
unlisted securities market which is being wound up at the end of this
month. They changed hands at 58p yesterday.
Scottish Pride's move to the AIM should improve liquidity in the
company's shares and make their trading more transparent. Greig
Middleton has been appointed as the firm's nominated broker.

I AM shocked that The Herald would publish an article by Alex Salmond
(September 27) which contains such a blatant untruth as the claim that
reporters were unaware of the suspect package at Labour's Scottish HQ
last Saturday before the Bomb Disposal Unit were called in by
Strathclyde Police.
This has now been repeated by Alex Salmond on at least two occasions,
therefore I am writing to spell out the facts.
Immediately I arrived at our office on Saturday afternoon --
approximately 1.30pm -- I discovered in our mail the suspect package and
telephoned Strathclyde Police. Approximately one hour later they called
in the Navy Bomb Disposal Unit from Faslane after conducting an X-ray of
the package and deciding it was suspicious.
Shortly before 6pm, one or more reporters started to appear outside
our headquarters, probably because one of the newspapers has an office
with large windows directly opposite our building and could see what was
happening.
At no time were they invited either by the police or the Scottish
Labour Party to come along and in fact they were only given a statement
after a further period of time and some serious consideration of the
likely impact of any publicity.
If I had really wanted to publicise this event and the crazy stunts of
the extreme nationalists who claimed responsibility, I would have
telephoned the television cameras on Saturday afternoon to provide them
with excellent footage of bomb disposal officers in army uniforms
entering and leaving our building.
That did not happen and the allegation that this was in some way
contrived should be withdrawn.
It is a pity that Alex Salmond cannot express some sympathy or
consideration for those whose family members and receptionists are
unfortunate enough to deal with the mail of Labour MPs in Scotland at
the moment, rather than trying to make cheap political points against
his opponents who are the target of this crazy campaign.

IN my recent letter I asserted that nationalism is a thoroughly
unpleasant and dangerous development in Scottish life. The response of
nationalists in the columns of your newspaper has been an outpouring of
personal abuse.
I did not make any personal attack on Mr Salmond but rather said that
I thought he sincerely believed there would be no cricket tests in a
separate Scotland.
I, in common with other Labour MPs and councillors, have a long
experience of nationalist abuse but on this occasion they make George
Robertson's point about the darker side of nationalism far more
eloquently than I could ever hope to achieve.

CONTRARY to John MacLeod's article (September 26), my judgment did not
desert me. I went to the SNP conference in Perth intending to say
exactly what I said. I was more than willing to pay the price, whatever
that may have been.
I have, contrary to his view, never looked on myself as a prima donna,
and never will. My sole motivation was principle and not position.
The SNP is now back on the straight and narrow road to freedom,
leaving the unionists to their ploys and deceptions. I am deeply
satisfied with that.
National liberation brought me into the SNP, not devolution -- which
is a compromise between liberty and subjugation.

I READ the letter from the depute chief executive of the Scottish
Sports Council, Jim Breen, with some surprise and disappointment as it
contained errors and comments which I would not have expected (September
23).
The Loch Lomond Park Authority has taken a lead in promoting the
by-laws and I would like to address some of the issues raised.
The Sports Council claims that it does not object to the by-laws in
principle. Yet it has formally objected to them on grounds that, if
approved for Loch Lomond, the precedent will make it more difficult to
resist similar initiatives on other lochs. To me, that reads like an
objection in principle.
The council also claims that it has not been invited to be part of
two-way discussions during preparation of by-laws. Yet, at the statutory
consultation stage, some 18 months ago, in a response to an invitation
to comment on the proposals, the Sports Council submitted a five-page
letter setting out its considered views.
At that time, it came to no firm conclusion, either in favour of or
against the by-laws. Certainly there was no hint that a formal objection
would follow.
The consultation exercise prompted changes in the draft proposals but
all of them led to relaxations in the proposed by-law provisions. It was
these proposals which were forwarded to the Scottish Office for
confirmation and whch are now objected to by the Sports Council.
The by-laws would not have the claimed effect of banning use by
fishermen of their traditional low-powered outboard engines. The strong
support for the by-laws package by the Angling Improvement Association
and others representing fishing interests would hardly have been likely
if this were the case.
When it was learned that a particular type of windsurfing board (a
sinking board) could not operate within the proposed speed limits close
inshore, it was acknowledged by the Park Authority that an exception
should be made to cover this situation. This has been known to the
Sports Council for some months.
It is disingenuous of the council, too, to argue that it would have
liked to have seen additional by-law provisions to cover such matters as
competence to use a boat. It knows that the law, as it stands, will not
permit these and related matters (eg, requiring insurance and buoyancy
aids) to be introduced through these by-laws, however desirable the
objectives may be.
Contrary to the impression given by the Sports Council, I believe that
the Park Authority has responded entirely responsibly to legitimate
concerns, which have been expressed by many people over many years,
about matters of public safety on the loch, about disturbance to local
residents and visitors and about disturbance to wildlife in particularly
vulnerable areas.
The Park Authority has carried out a difficult task thoroughly and its
proposals represent a fair and workable compromise. I look forward to
their early confirmation by the Secretary of State in the interest of
Loch Lomond and all those who enjoy this very special place.

Chairman, Loch Lomond Park Authority,

YOUR editorial of September 26, with regard to Brian MacKinnon, aka
Brandon Lee, ends with readers being reminded that MacKinnon/Lee has
turned down #25,000 for his story, and then the question is posed: ''How
many of us could honestly say we would do the same in the same
circumstances?''
This would appear very noble were it not for the fact that this
persistent student must, in 17 years, have gobbled up more than that
amount in student grants, and many putative students must have been
denied places at Glasgow and Dundee universities because of this
con-man.
This man makes much of the fact that he was ill during his first foray
into the Glasgow medical faculty; why then did he fail to present them
with a medical certificate?
I, for one, would be extremely uneasy to find myself, medically, in
the care of a medical practitioner who can lie with such ease, and who
is extremely inventive in finding excuses for himself.
I would suggest, with all due respect to this latter-day Walter Mitty,
that he gives up all thought of medicine; perhaps fiction writing is his
true forte, but please, please, spare us the possibility of such a
doctor!

HAVING read Brandon Lee's/Brian MacKinnon's own account of his life
experiences, it is clear that he is an extremely literate young/old man.
Indeed, his prose is reminiscent of Mary Shelley's in her classic novel
Frankenstein.
Perhaps he should be devoting more time to becoming a
nineteenth-century novelist than a qualified doctor.

''I'M no Peter Pan,'' states Brian MacKinnon in The Herald (September
25), yet Scotland's Independent Newspaper seems to have been covered in
magic dust and lost all sense of reality.
Surely maturity also comes from having to accept the unacceptable.
Many young people, my daughter included, who desperately tried to get
into medical school, must have been surprised to read the over-exposure
and undue attention you gave Mr MacKinnon.
With hopes dashed at an early age, they were able to find the
resilience and fortitude to choose another career, with no accolades,
press coverage, or the opportunity to turn down huge cash rewards.

NORMALITY was returning slowly to Ibrox yesterday after the Champions'
League people had packed up their gaudy caravan and headed off to where
ever it is these blazored nomads hide out between matches. But the
tranquility won't last long, because Rangers have another major contest
to deal with tomorrow when they travel to Celtic Park for the second
time inside a fortnight.
They played there and won a Coca-Cola Cup quarter-final tie thanks to
an Ally McCoist goal, but this time, Rangers will be without Brian
Laudrup who was ordered to hospital yesterday for X-rays on a damaged
ankle.
When the Dane, whose form, especially in Europe, has been criticised
this season, left the pitch at half time against Borussia Dortmund on
Wednesday night, he was limping slightly and he did not re-appear after
the break, his place being taken by Ian Ferguson.
Laudrup, it was pointed out yesterday by manager Walter Smith, has
been carrying the injury since last month when he was hurt during a
training session with the Danish international squad.
''However, because of the importance of the matches we were facing,
Brian wanted to play, but it has reached the stage now where he has to
stop and get something done.
''There is no doubt, though, the injury is beginning to inhibit his
performances,'' Smith said.
Although the full extent of the damage will not be known until the
X-rays have been studied Smith expects he will have to do without
Laudrup for a few matches pointing out the Rangers' own doctor feels
rest and treatment will cure the problem. Obviously it is a setback
losing the Dane for the Old Firm league match, but yesterday's news at
least throws some light on the player's lacklustre displays.
Even he had taken to defending himself in the club's newspaper this
week, but his critics, myself included, who were wondering if Laudrup
would produce his full array of skills in the European arena must be
willing now to allow him the benefit of the doubt. He can be judged when
fully fit and also when he is allowed a free role to perform wherever he
wishes on the pitch rather than being asked to play up front with Ally
McCoist.
Rangers will also have to tackle Celtic without David Robertson, whose
hamstring problem denied him the opportunity to take part in the
Champions' League match against Dortmund.
''Of all the injury problems we had, his was always the most
troublesome,'' Smith said. ''He wasn't really close to playing against
the Germans and he will not play against Celtic either.''
However, while Rangers are down two key players, they have the
consolation of knowing Richard Gough, who played an oustanding part
against Dortmund, came through unscathed when he, too, had been a
doubtful starter because of a leg injury. Also, Ferguson and Stuart
McCall both returned to active duty in midweek, and Oleg Salenko is
eligible again. All are anxious to play against Celtic.
Of course, perhaps the most pleasing aspect of all so far as Smith and
Rangers' fans were concerned was the performance given by Paul
Gascoigne, who finally looked like the top-class player the Ibrox side
believed all along that they had bought. Smith has maintained the
English internationalist required time to regain full effectiveness
after his much-publicised injury problems.
''It always seems Paul is having to prove himself to people, but
everyone could see the other night that he is making good progress,''
said Smith. ''It hasn't been easy so far this season because of the
number of matches teams have had to play, but he is coming back.''
Smith was was unwilling to look too far ahead in his side's Champions'
League section or speculate on the outcome, although it is obvious the
Italian champions, Juventus, who are scoring freely, will win Group C.
Rangers, Dortmund, and Steaua Bucharest are scrambling for the second
qualifying place.
''There's a lot of football to be played before the end of the
section, we have four games left and it is too difficult to imagine what
might happen. The fact that we now play Juventus, who were always
favourites to win the group, back to back starting next month doesn't
make it any tougher, or easier, for us.''

EVERTON last night launched a search for Daniel Amokachi's wife after
the Nigerian striker was whisked to hospital for brain scans following a
horrific clash of heads in the Cup-winners' Cup 3-1 victory over KR
Reykjavik.
The Nigerian was carried off on a stretcher unconscious after
colliding with Reykjavik's Pormodur Egilsson.
He was originally taken to Fazakerley Hospital but was immediately
transferred tothe neurological unit of Walton Hospital for further
examination.
Everton manager Joe Royle said: ''The game just does not matter any
more. The whole thing has been overshadowed by Daniel's accident. He was
caught on the side of the temple and never regained full
consciousness.''
The player's wife is modelling somewhere on the Continent.
Amokachi was given oxygen before being taken to hospital, but it
failed to revive him.

RANGERS may not look like winning their Champions' League section, but
they are poised to triumph over England's representatives Blackburn
Rovers in the contest for live television coverage.
So far, the Ibrox club's first two matches, against Steaua Bucharest
and Borussia Dortmund, have been shown live on Scottish Television, and
because of the immense appeal of the premier-division champion's next
couple of games, both against Italian champions Juventus, it seems
likely ITV will network the ties.
Blackburn are struggling badly in Group B, having lost their first two
games and their attractiveness is fading fast. Also, their next two
outings are against Polish and Russian opposition which does little for
the television people who are already looking at the possibility of
showing Rangers, who have the added appeal of Paul Gascoigne, throughout
Britain.
Before the Champions' League started, both Scottish Television and ITV
always suspected the time would come when Rangers might be the better of
the two British propositions, and that time appears to have arrived. If
Rangers' game is networked then their argument, which they are already
putting to UEFA, that they should have a greater share of the TV money
which UEFA distribute among Champions' League clubs according to their
potential viewing figures will be strengthened considerably.
However, if Rangers earn more from television fees, then their ticket
prices for Champions' League matches would look even more excessive than
they do at the moment. While Blackburn Rovers pegged their admission
prices at #14 and #17.50, the same as fans pay to watch Premiership
games, Rangers increased their dmeands considerably.
A ticket for the Broomloan Stand, for example, to watch Rangers' 2-2
draw with Borussia Dortmund cost #27 as opposed to #12 on a Saturday.
Last season Rangers played 20 matches at home in front of crowds in
excess of 40,000, but their first Champions' League match at Ibrox
attracted 33,209.
That can be partly explained by the fact that Dortmund asked for 3000
tickets, but in fact brought only 1300 fans and gave tickets back in two
lots which meant Rangers were left with no time to make arrangements to
fill up the seats. However, there is no doubt the supporters, even
though season-ticket holders were offered a reduced price for a
three-match package, felt the price was too high.
Champions' League attendances throughout Europe were not particularly
impressive, and it may also be the case that the relationship between
television and football is now exacting a price. TV's millions are
difficult to resist, but the atmosphere within grounds might suffer as
fans take the easy option and watch at home or in their locals.
However, Rangers chairman David Murray refuses to accept his prices
were too severe, even though the crowd was 11,000 down on the Ibrox
average, and he pointed out: ''I thought it was a reasonable attendance
given the circumstances.
''People will point to the prices but I honestly don't think a fiver
less would have made much difference, and for some seats, it was #21 per
match if you bought the three-game package. There are other factors like
live television coverage, the defeat in Bucharest, and the number of
games fans pay to see in a short space of time.
''There are still five weeks to go until we play Juventus at Ibrox yet
we have sold 31,000 to 32,000 for that game.''
Juventus, of course, are one of world football's glamour sides and
fans will pay to see genuine quality, but perhaps it would have been
better had Rangers offered tickets for the Dortmund and Steaua matches
at a lower price. By way of contrast, Celtic's dearest ticket for their
European tie last night was #14.
Rangers may have felt they needed to gather in as much as possible
from their Champions' League adventure because while they are regarded
as major spenders in British football, they find it difficult to compete
financially with the top sides in Europe.
While UEFA regulate much of the cash flow in Champions' League
football, clubs are allowed to fix their own prices.

THE main Western tool for measuring a society's economic success, the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), may no longer be functioning adequately.
The instrument was an American invention of the early 1940s designed to
focus data to help the US Government plan war production. It became
useful for many other purposes and has been widely adopted
internationally by civil servants, planners, and economists so that it
may everywhere be said to represent conventional wisdom. One reason
doubts about its efficacy are spreading on both sides of the Atlantic is
the way in which GDP figures should make us ''feel good'' -- since they
both indicate modest but real growth even after, in our own case,
increased taxation. Are those who continue to ''feel bad'' being
irrational? Many American economists think not, and are pressing for a
new index, the Genuine Progress Index (GPI), which would measure a far
wider range of vital data and which would show some deterioration in
conditions where the more narrow GDP identifies improvement. Their plea
comes at a time when the World Bank has been experimenting with new
measurements which have different criteria from the GDP and which give
markedly different assessments of some economies, hitherto thought to be
poverty stricken according to conventional wisdom.
The GDP ignores important environmental and social developments which
are now recognised as involving a society's standard of living and
economic health as much as data concerning earnings, output, and
employment. Measurements of real prosperity have to take account of the
crime rate and its costs, the costs of marital breakdown (measurable in
relation to divorce), the costs of drug abuse, and of environmental
pollution. It should, more positively, try to measure the worth of
voluntary endeavour (very significant in both the US and UK) and put
some value on household work, ignored everywhere by estimates of GDP.
Some sponsors of the change believe it should also take account of the
distribution of income, believing that a greater measure of equality in
this area is an index of progress. Not everyone will accept that last
item, which is highly debatable, and some of the other data would
involve ''guesstimates'' rather than hard fact, but then the apparent
precision of much conventional data, unemployment statistics, for
example, is doubtful, hence the scepticism with which they are greeted.
Provided the basis of the ''guesstimates'' remains the same for each
period of calculation, any drawbacks may prove to be marginal.
A society which is highly individualistic and driven by awareness of
self- interest may prefer to stick to GDP to measure its progress, but
one which places more reliance on collective effort should prefer
something akin to the GPI. Perhaps all should make the change to some
extent since all must recognise that some vital developments transcend
any individual capacity to influence significantly -- the recent rise in
numbers of youthful asthma sufferers is a ready example. Widely ascribed
to the enormous expansion of car usage and consequent fume emissions, it
can only be controlled by legislation for the common good. (Though the
form of that legislation may not be easily, or immediately,
established.)
Any new system would ascribe values to activities taken for granted
but not at the moment measured. The World Bank's system is, for example,
''greener'' than any GDP by itself would allow. The GPI lays greater
stress on community than the GDP, a stress which mirrors greater
contemporary concern for that phenomenon in the US than was common in
the Reagan era. A similar preoccupation may be emerging here and could
be, in part, reflected in support for the Labour Party and the rise in
''green'' awareness everywhere.

MOTORSPORT
MARTIN Brundle is Ferrari-bound Eddie Irvine's replacement in the
Jordan Peugeot team next season. Brundle, who was strongly tipped to
join Michael Schumacher at Ferrari before the Italians' unexpected move
for Irvine, is leaving French team Ligier to renew his association with
Jordan.
''I was obviously not close enough to the Ferrari job,'' said the
36-year-old English driver. ''But I am delighted to be rejoining
Jordan.''
Brundle scored the Silverstone-based team's first win when he drove
for them in the British Formula 3 Championship in 1983.
''Martin was the first Jordan driver to go on and race in Formula One
and I have been trying to do a deal with him on and off for about five
years now,'' said team manager Eddie Jordan.
Only last Thursday the Jordan team announced that Irvine and Brazilian
Rubens Barrichello would be their drivers in 1996, but were forced into
a rapid search for a replacement when the Ulsterman left for Ferrari on
Tuesday.
''We were absolutely certain about our drivers, which just shows how
quickly this has moved,'' added Jordan. ''But Martin was there, he was
willing and the deal was done in a short space of time.''
This weekend's European Grand Prix in Germany will be Brundle's 141st
Formula One race.

CYCLING:
GRAEME Obree did not sound like Superman on the morning after his
world cycling title success. Still wheezing chestily 20 hours after his
4000 metres individual pursuit victory in the rarefied air of Columbia,
the Scot could barely speak.
''I'm sorry,'' he said. ''I am still gasping. For the last three laps
I could not breath at full capacity. I felt asphyxiated in that thin
air. But when the world title is at stake, you just push through it.''
If the 30-year-old Obree was gasping, that was nothing to the beaten
Italian, Andrea Collinelli, whom the Scot headed by a second and a half
for the sweetest of victories after the lead had changed hands five
times.
It also left the bureaucrats of this Italian-dominated sport
breathless, for they thought they had seen the last of Obree when they
outlawed his home-made bike and controversial riding style at last
year's championships.
But neither his discomfort, nor theirs, will stop the Ayrshireman from
attempting to regain the world one-hour record (55.291km) from Tony
Rominger. He will make his bid in Manchester on October 14, again
employing his ''Superman'' position, arms extended full out.
Obree has twice held the hour mark, initially in Norway, in 1993, and
then re-capturing it from Olympic champion Chris Boardman in Bordeaux a
year past April. To regain the record, Obree must ride 3.69 kilometres
(2.3 miles) further than on the last occasion he held it.
''It was good to come back after being written off,'' croaked Obree
yesterday. ''In January and February there were few people who thought I
could come back and win this. The International Cyclists Union said:
'That's Obree finished' -- certainly I was the rider whom they least
wanted to win.
''Put it this way, mine was the only bike checked on the day of
competition. 20 minutes before the final they were still measuring it.
But I knew it conformed. It was the same bike I had used when I took the
record off Boardman last year. The only change was the handlebars.
''The misconception is that I won the title before because of the
aerodynamic advantage I gained. That's not true -- it was because I
devised a position that was most comfortable for me. They outlawed that,
but the new superman position has been equally as comfortable.
''Before I was only rated a good mechanic, but not a good athlete.
Does winning back the title prove I am a good athlete? Well if that is
what is taken out of it, I won't complain.''

EUROPEAN OPEN:
THE weary warriors of the Ryder Cup were notably absent from the head
of the leaderboard when the #650,000 Smurfit European Open began in
crisp, clear conditions at the K Club, near Dublin, yesterday. Unlikely
leaders were Englishmen Carl Mason and Barry Lane on 67 with rookie
Frenchman Fabrice Tarnaud and New Zealand's Michael Campbell a shot
back.
Costantino Rocca, with a 69, was the best of the team Europe squad,
but local hero Philip Walton slumped to a 78.
It was first blood to Colin Montgomerie in his order-of-merit battle
with fellow-Scot Sam Torrance, who leads him by only #29,000. Monty came
in with a solid 71 while Sam took two shots more, having three-putted
three times.
Both Scots had harsh words for the spiky greens, though not quite
bitter as Australian Wayne Riley who is on 70. ''Did they,'' he enquired
acidly, ''run the Irish Grand National over them last week?''
The Scot with most to smile about was Aberdeen's Paul Lawrie. He was
out in the first group and slotted putts of 30, 25 and 20 feet in his 69
before the greens started to become rough.
Lawrie, currently 118th on the money list, frankly admitted he has had
a shocker of a season. ''My wife had our first child, a son Craig, five
months ago, and I really didn't want to leave home for a while. My
enthusiasm for the game has come back now and I need something from this
week to make sure I keep my tour card.''
Mason rattled in six birdies for an early lead on 67. At 42 he has
only two tour victories to his credit, but he puts his current good form
down to three factors -- he changed his putter, his driver, and his
caddie this month.
''I was sorry to part with my previous caddie Martin Rowley, but he
was frightened to speak to me in case I chopped his head off.
''My old putter had been with me 10 years but it, and the driver, just
had to go.'' If he slumps this week he will probably change his name.
Lane, a former Ryder Cup representative, did not look to be doing
anything special when he reached the turn in 37. He then blazed back in
30 with birdies at each of the last four holes. ''I couldn't miss,'' he
confessed.
Tarnaud is a 26-year-old who turned pro only three years ago. The
highlight of his round was a 45-foot putt for an eagle on the
eighteenth.
Also just behind the leaders is the highly promising Kiwi Campbell,
runner-up to Torrance in the British Masters earlier this month. He
missed only two fairways as he compiled his 68 and boldly predicted: ''I
believe I have the edge over the Ryder Cup guys because they are tired
mentally and physically.'' We'll see on Sunday.
Montgomerie began his challenge with a one-under par 71. He was
driving particularly well but found the greens almost impossible.
The 6-1 favourites at the bookies, Monty admitted there was only one
reason he was in the tournament at all. ''I am just not ready to
surrender the No.1 spot -- to Sam or anyone else.
''That is why I will be playing in Germany next week as well. This has
been a long, hard year but I am taking the month of January off. My wife
Eimear is expecting our second child then.''
Torrance admitted he found it difficult to concentrate after last
weekend but played well enough tee to green. He was asked what he would
say if he received a late invitation to play in the matchplay at
Wentworth. ''I would say 'thank you' ''
Sandy Lyle, threatening a comeback to the big time for some months,
was happy with his 70. ''I had one stupid three-putt but otherwise I was
happy with my game. This is a round I can build on.''
He was playing with American Ryder Cup man Tom Lehman who finished on
the same mark thanks to a holed chip from 110 yards on his last hole.

RAITH Rovers were last night counting a sudden bonus when defender
Stephen McAnespie moved to Bolton for #900,000. The 23-year-old
travelled to Lancashire last night, after having starred in Iceland on
Tuesday, as the Kirkcaldy club reached this morning's UEFA Cup draw.
It's the end of a determined hunt by Bolton manager Roy McFarland, who
has been a frequent visitor to the Kirkcaldy ground this season.
It's a huge pay-off for manager Jimmy Nicholl, who can now move into
the transfer market as he chases premier division safety. McAnespie has
been at Raith only for the past 18 months, but has managed to cram a
lifetime of experience into his short stay.
Just 10 months after joining the Fifers, he captured a Coca-Cola Cup
winners' medal after the dramatic penalty shoot-out victory over Celtic
at Hampden Park. That was swiftly followed by a first division
championship triumph in May and a run in the UEFA Cup.
''I'm sorry to be leaving Raith, but Bolton represents a marvellous
opportunity for me with the chance to compete at the very highest
level,'' said McAnespie.
It was only a matter of time before some club north or south of the
Border produced a cheque book to break up the squad that Nicholl has put
together with such detail.

BRIAN Barnes limps back into Seniors Tour action today as favourite to
win the first London Masters event at the new London Club in Kent.
Barnes, who has spent the last month in hospital trying to cure
blood-clotting in his right leg, has been advised that exercise will
help but must rest the leg horizontally on a shooting stick between
shots.
The big Scot, the British Seniors Open champion, has not played since
being taken to hospital on the eve of the Scottish Seniors Open at
Aberdeen early this month. But now he is ''raring to go''.

LORA Fairclough was on target for a third win of the season when she
fired an opening 68, five-under-par, to lead the field in the Italian
Open at Il Picciolo in Sicily yesterday. Fairclough, winner of the Ford
Classic and European Masters titles already this year, leads by two
strokes from Barcelona-based French golfer Marie-Laure de Lorenzi and
Australian Denise Booker.
The Lancashire player erupted with a birdie blast on the course which
lies under the shadow of Mount Etna. She was six under before dropping a
late shot then said: ''This is a really tough course and trying to find
the fairways in that wind is like trying to thread a needle.''
Fairclough finished eight ahead of Dale Reid who helped the Lancashire
player accumulate two points on her Solheim Cup debut last year leaving
Julie Forbes the best of the Scots on 72. Leading scores (British or
Irish unless stated):
70 -- M-L de Lorenzi (France), D Booker (Australia).
71 -- A Arruti (Spain), L Brooky (New Zealand).
72 -- J Soulsby, H Hopkins (Australia), C Louw (S Africa), S Waugh

SAILING
SCOTTISH sailing's newest class of international race boats, the
Melges 24, have their first ever Scottish championship hosted by Kip
Marina, off Inverkip, this weekend.
The attraction of a new national title and the prize of One Thousand
Guineas, provided by sponsors Tunnocks, has ensured that virtually all
of the existing Melges boats in Britain will be racing on the Clyde this
weekend, more than two thirds travelling from the south of England.
The electrifying performance of the Melges, which is powered by a big
asymmetrical spinnaker, is design to be sailed by a small crew (four or
five to a maximum crew weight of 345kg), and is aimed to exploit the
relaxation of rules limiting advertising on boats and sails, means the
class is attracting top sailors and commercial sponsors from outwith the
sport.
Among the leading contenders this weekend will be 1968 Olympic silver
medallist Keith Musto in Hooked on Speed and former 505 dinghy world
champion Ian Barker in Pinnel and Bax.
Chris Owen, who won West Highland Yachting Week will be steering
Tunnock's Teacake, and former Scottish coach Jim Donaldson will be
steering one of the Glenfiddich boats.
The fleet will race six short races.

ON the morning after having turned in his best performance yet for
Rangers, Paul Gascoigne flew to London to sign a five-year deal to wear
the boots that he believes are helping his game.
The Rangers' idol could net a cool #20,000 for scoring a hat trick,
thanks to the unique pay-as-you-score deal. The Geordie also scored a
massive #2.5m signing-on fee
Gascoigne maintains that the special rubber ridge on the instep of the
Adidas Predator boot imparts extra spin and swerve. The most obvious
benefit, he says, is at free kicks, like the one he landed on Richard
Gough's head for the first goal against Borussia Dortmund.
''I'm known for my passing and free kicks, and it definitely does put
more swerve on the ball,'' he said yesterday at a rooftop venue in
Kensington.
The 60-page agreement uses a sliding scale to decide the size of the
bonus Gazza will be paid after each game. And according to Adidas, he is
the only player in Britain to have been offered the fantasy football
style contract.
A spokesman said: ''The bigger the game, the bigger the stage, and the
better the goal, the more money we will have to pay out.
Told that the Rangers manager, Walter Smith, had complimented his
performance against the Germans, he responded: ''I'll have to go in and
ask for a rise. I was pleased with my performance, very much so, but it
was nice of Walter to say so and I hope I can continue like that week in
and week out.
''I never felt I'd lost my ability but don't forget it's the first
time for a long while that I've had a run of games like I'm having now.
Another five matches and I'll have played as many games for Rangers as I
did in three years with Lazio.
''From a personal point of view, I just hope to keep on progressing
and to keep free of injuries.''
There were signs, though, that he may still not fully have
comprehended the immense weight of expectation at Ibrox.
''We've only lost two games out of 16, what more do you want?'' he
demanded.
The answer from any true blue is, of course, to be top of the table,
not second, and to have taken rather more than one point from two
matches in the Champions' League. That is where Glasgow differs from
Rome or the north of London.

FOR someone with a background in shipbuilding Jimmy Reid is all at sea
in the history of technology. The sage of Clydeside tells us (September
21) that his mother was born at the turn of the century ''into a world
without electricity, cars, lorries, aeroplanes, telephones, radio,
films, television . . . '' and, among other things, ''submarines''.
My own mother was born around the same time into a much more modern
age. Messrs Ohm and Faraday knew quite a lot about electricity early in
the nineteenth century. By 1837 telegraphy had been invented. A cable
was laid between Dover and Calais in 1850 and transatlantic cables
followed in 1858 and 1866.
Alexander Graham Bell invented the electro-magnetic telephone in 1876.
Marconi transmitted wireless telegraphy messages across the English
Channel in 1899 and across the Atlantic in 1901. (A Canadian, Reginald
Fissenden, demonstrated voice transmission by radio in 1904.)
Electric light was pioneered in 1879. The cinematograph dates from
1890. The first electrically powered streetcar operated in Berlin in
1881. Electric cars began running on Glasgow tramways in 1898. The first
cathode ray tube was developed in 1897 and television was theoretically
anticipated as early as 1884.
In 1900 heavier-than-air flight (1903) was just around the corner. (A
powered, but uncontrolled flight of 200 feet by a manned craft had been
achieved as early as 1890.) Submarines date from the American Civil War.
Considering that Jimmy Reid once memorably credited James Watt with
inventing the ''internal combustion engine'', it is surprising that he
lists motor vehicles among the marvels yet to be discovered as the
twentieth century began.
The first internal combustion engine was developed by Daimler in 1883.
The first automobile was built in 1885 by Karl Benz who later built the
first gasoline-powered bus in 1895. Henry Ford produced his first
automobile in 1896.
The most depressing part of Jimmy's Reid's philosophising is his
concern with ''Britain's role in a changed and changing world'' rather
than the need to extricate his native land from Britannia's grasp.
Grown-up countries like Canada, the US, Australia, and Ireland seem to
have managed quite well since they took full control of their destinies.
Maybe Jimmy should go back to night school before next setting the
world to rights.

* A FORMER steelman who bought over a small sandwich company four
years ago is now keen to expand into Europe. Alan Greenshields's Green
Meadow Foods will join a Scottish Trade International mission to
Brussels and the Hague next month.
He was an engineer with British Steel when he was made redundant 15
years ago. He went to work in a Chunky Chicken factory but in 1991 he
bought a recently-established firm which was making only 500 sandwiches
a week.
Within three years he had a #1m turnover and a full-time workforce of
17. Then he won a contract with a Littlewoods to supply around 38,000
sandwiches a week to its 13 Scottish stores.
It meant buying a #200,000 sandwich conveyor belt which automatically
butters the bread, but it doubled his turnover and his workforce. He was
still only 38.
Last year the company was voted British Sandwich Manufacturer of the
Year and this year achieved the quality assurance standard, ISO9002.
Green Meadow Foods, based at the Motherwell Food Park, is now looking
for links with other manufacturers, distributors and agents in similar
market sectors.
It has added a microwaveable sandwich, called The Hotwich to its
range. The first two versions both use Ciabatta bread: the Milano has
smoked ham, cheese and spice filling, while the Sorrento contains
cheddar and mozzarella cheeses, red onions, sun-dried tomato pate and
herbs.
The sandwich market has actually been helped by the recession,
increasing Littlewoods' sandwich business by 50% a year in three recent
years. There has also been evidence of a growth in the market in
European countries.
Green Meadow's sandwiches could give a new meaning to the phrase
''piece in Europe''.

EVERTON striker Daniel Amokachi was described as ''comfortable'' in
hospital last night after having been stretchered unconscious from the
field during his side's 3-1 victory over KR Reykjavik in the European
Cup-winners' Cup.
A spokesman at Fazakerley Hospital in Liverpool said the Nigerian
international had woken up and was ''being kept in overnight for
observation''.
Initial reports suggested that Amokachi had been transferred to a
neurological unit at Walton Hospital for treatment after he had fallen
awkwardly in the thirty-sixth minute of the match at Goodison Park.
This proved not to be the case and he will be staying at Fazakerley at
least until this morning. Everton manager Joe Royle said his side's
victory had been overshadowed by the plight of Amokachi.
The club was last night trying to make contact with the player's wife
who is modelling on the Continent.

THE STATE OF SCOTTISH TRAINING PART TWO: SOLUTIONS
Scottish Enterprise wants to bring all the college representative
organisations under one banner to create a more cohesive attitude to
training, reports Joan Grady
BOB DOWNES, director of industry and skills at Scottish Enterprise,
has the task of increasing Scotland's business competitiveness and
improving the skills base through appropriate training.
''We are led by business competitiveness requirements -- that is our
rationale,'' he says. ''However we recognise the deeply important role
of skills development in competitiveness.
''Fundamentally we would like to action new initiatives which will
improve the operating relationship between business and the training
industry in Scotland. A new relationship would deliver sustainable
competitive advantage for us all.
''In Scotland, interfaces between industry, education and training
have been established, but we still need to get closer to employers'
skill needs.''
To this end, Scottish Enterprise is working with industry training
organisations to develop the Modern Apprenticeship. This is a scheme
designed for 16 and 17-year-olds in the Skillseekers programme.
Modern Apprenticeships are an extension of this programme, offering
more advanced qualifications and a more tailored approach to training.
The Skillseekers programme allows young people to pay for their training
through a ''credit card'' provided by Scottish Enterprise.
Training plans are worked out between the Skillseeker and the
employer, and young people can be taken on as trainees for a limited
period, or as trainees with employed status, with a job waiting when
training is completed.
It gives them the chance to gain industry-recognised qualifications
and valuable work experience, and the numbers of Skillseekers now in
training with employment status has been steadily increasing since the
initiative began. ''Skillseekers is a very solid form of applied
training associated with solid jobs,'' says Downes.
However, the qualifications are usually at a basic level, with few
opportunities for management training. Modern Apprenticeships will allow
young people to train for jobs at craft, technician and trainee
management level by offering vocational qualifications at Level 3 or
above.
Industry Training Organisations are currently developing Modern
Apprenticeships for 60 sectors of industry and commerce. They offer
employers a flexible training system, developed by their own industries,
which can be adapted to meet specific company requirements.
''We're hoping to have introduced about 1000 Modern Apprenticeships by
the end of 1996,'' says Downes. ''They have been customised to meet
Scotland's requirements.''
The qualifications participants work towards -- usually Scottish
Vocational Qualifications -- have been also, for the most part,
customised to meet Scotland's requirements.
They are developed to the same standard as National VQs -- the
difference is simply that SCOTVEC has adapted the qualification through
consultation with employers and employees, to suit the Scottish
situation.
''Controlling qualifications in Scotland allows the Scottish community
to have a stake in quality areas so we get a stake at the UK level,''
says Tom McCool, chief executive of SCOTVEC. ''If there were only NVQs
available we couldn't bring that Scottish influence to bear on the UK
system.''
In industry-based training such as Skillseekers and Modern
Apprenticeships developing the link between industry and training is
fairly simple. Employers are on the spot to pick up any inappropriate
standards or unnecessary procedures.
But tackling the shortage of skills addresses only half the problem.
The lack of demand for skills from Scottish employers has also to be
remedied before Scotland can compete in a global marketplace.
Downes hopes that he can create new demand by ensuring that training
being given outwith industry matches up to industry standards. ''We must
make sure demands are articulated to colleges,'' he says. ''These are an
undervalued part of our assets for improving training.
''At degree level and above they function excellently and can hold up
to international standards; but below that it falls down. We want to
pull further education colleges into a closer relationship with
industries so industries will buy the outcome.''
Many colleges are now undergoing Investors In People evaluation to
identify the areas in which they need to improve. Scottish Enterprise
wants to bring all the college representative organisations under one
banner to create a more cohesive attitude to training.
Colleges will be asked to re-examine course design and delivery and to
introduce a greater variety of flexible learning techniques.
''The understanding between industry and education is only real and
effective when courses and training programmes are designed and
delivered to meet the training needs which are central to business
performance,'' says Downes.
''Course designers need to be fully engaged in the reality of the
business agenda today, while at the same time industry needs fully to
respect the contribution that education and training providers can make
in defining the industry's needs for new and flexible kinds of skills,
and delivering them in cost-effective ways.''
To help colleges keep up with industry standards, SE has set up the
College Equipment Fund. This will enable colleges to purchase the more
expensive pieces of equipment they could otherwise not afford.
These measures are designed to bring colleges closer to industry
needs. If a set of standards can be developed to suit those needs,
colleges will be able to provide a more substantial career path from
education to industry.
Downes also hopes that Investors In People will have a large part to
play in stimulating demand for upgraded skills. ''Investors In People is
a large part of this process,'' he says. ''Companies have to go through
a self-assessment and examine how they deal with the people running
their business.
''The process is supervised by an adviser from the local enterprise
company and makes all people at all levels more competent.''
By identifying where faults lie, IIP shows organisations exactly what
skills they need and in what areas they need them. ''The successful
public-private co-operation, which we see as necessary and which we
shall endeavour to help bring about, will be based on focused
interaction,'' says Downes.

CELTIC brought European football back to Parkhead last night and they
did it with some style.
This was a return to the stadium which has housed so many memorable
nights in European competition and it was a triumphant comeback. The
Scottish Cup holders scored four times against Dinamo Batumi from
Georgia to run out with an aggregate victory of 7-2 as they crashed
through to the second round of the European Cup-winners' Cup
competition.
Today, they will learn their next opponents, and they will recognise
already that the opposition will be more formidable than the team from
the fledgling Republic of Georgia who presented little challenge last
night.
Celtic were able to go into the game without the midfield skills of
John Collins, who was not even on the bench after last weekend's
problems between the player and manager Tommy Burns.
Before the game, Collins went into the stand along with the injured
Phil O'Donnell, and was joined there by his agent.
Afterwards Burns commented simply: ''John Collins was in the squad for
the game, but we did not use him. As far as Saturday's game against
Rangers is concerned, he will again be involved, and we do have Peter
Grant injured, remember.
''But we will pick the team for the game just as we did tonight. This
result was important for us and I was delighted to get it, even though
there were times in the second half when we were sloppy.
''But when we were, Gordon Marshall was in good enough form to stop
them getting even one goal.''
Marshall was in action several times in the second half, but, by then,
the same double act which had beateh Batumi in their own stadium on the
shores of the Black Sea, had struck again.
German star Andreas Thom, Burns' major summer signing, scored two
goals -- both headers -- in a three-minute spell in the first half, and
then young Simon Donnelly grabbed a spectacular third goal just after
half time as the bemused Georgians -- who had played down Celtic's away
victory beforehand -- tried to get to grips with the game.
When they did make inroads in the second half, the game was over.
Andy Walker, a second half substitute, was even allowed the luxury of
failing to score from a penalty -- a miss as sloppy as anything Burns
watched from the bench -- and then make amends with a goal in the dying
minutes.
By then, of course, everything had been settled. The twin headers from
Thom and the strike from Donnelly had killed off any faint hopes the
Georgians might have had of pulling off a shock result.
Now Celtic look sure to face one of the major teams in the next round
as UEFA have decided that today's draw will be seeded, and the Scots
will not be among the favoured sides.
But Burns said last night: ''I'd be happy to get one of the major
teams and have another big night here.''
And, while Celtic are attempting to restore a reputation in Europe the
aggregate score line from this first round tie will help them do that
and may cause a few flutters of concern among the more fancied clubs.
Especially if they see just how professionally the Parkhead side went
about their task last night.
Celtic took up the attacking stance their fans always demand on these
European nights and that tactic paid off.
There were early indications that the Georgian defence was as suspect
as it had been in on their home soil.
They were found to be struggling whenever Celtic moved forward and in
six minutes, Phutkaradze was shown the yellow card for a foul on Thom,
who had clearly been marked down as the danger man. Thirteen minutes
later the German gave his answer.
Tosh McKinlay sent in a free kick from the left and there was Thom,
unmarked, and able to guide a header into the net.
Three minutes later the German did it again. This time the cross came
from Brian McLaughlin and again the Georgian defenders allowed Thom an
opening and he guided a header beyond the 'keeper and into the net.
Not long afterwards he almost snatched a hat trick with a vicious
volley which went wide of the far post.
Then, before half-time, McLaughlin set up a chance for Van Hooydonk
and the Dutchman's shot was pushed away by the under pressure Batumi
keeper.
It took Celtic just two minutes of the second half to ncrease their
lead -- and, it was Simon Donnelly, who had also scored in Georgia, who
gave them that third goal.
The youngster scored with a stunning shot from 25 yards and the new
Parkhead celebrated this triumphant return to European football. Eight
minutes later, Donnelly went off, perhaps with a mind to Saturday and
the Old Firm game, and Chris Hay took his place.
In 62 minutes Andy Walker replaced Van Hooydonk as Celtic tried to
settle on their lead, and still keep an eye on Saturday's game.
There was a flurry of chances from the Georgians which might have been
dangerous if they had come earlier in the game.
Gordon Marshall had saves strung together over a seven-minute spell as
Batumi tied to rescue their reputation which lay in tatters.
The 31,969 fans simply sat back to enjoy the victory which could have
been even greater in the 77th minute when Tosh McKinlay was brought down
in the penalty box by Shanidze. The penalty kick was awarded but Andy
Walker blasted the ball against the keeper as the fans watched in
disbelief.
Fortunately, the miss did not matter.
CELTIC -- Marshall, Boyd, McKinlay, Vata, Hughes, Grant, Donnelly,
McStay, Van Hooydonk, Thom, McLaughlin. Substitutes -- Walker, Kerr,
Hay, Gray, MacKay.
DINAMO BATUMI -- Togonidze, Shanidze, Phutkaradze, Mujiri, Shekiladze,
Torgashuilin, M Makharadze, Kantidze, Tugushi, Ujmajuridze, Mindadze.
Substitutes -- Baladze, Sitshinave, D Makharadze, Malania, Glonti.
Referee -- G T Orrason (Iceland).

JIMMY Reid's thoughtful piece on the failure of politics (September
21) identifies some of the many areas in which our political system has
failed us; but nowhere does he devote a word to what we ought to do
about it.
Like him, I am fed up to the teeth with the dishonesty of politicians
of all parties and with their arrogant assumption that we are so stupid
as to believe what they say.
The present system is wide open for greedy politicians to come up with
self-serving ideas like proportional representation and devolution -- or
for think-tank academics to produce theoretical schemes that have no
relevance to the real world and that take us even further into the
electoral morass.
Why on earth do we swallow this dangerous nonsense? Why do we allow
the politicans to get away with ripping us off time and time again? Yet
the great mass of Scottish Labour voters would vote for an orang-utan if
it were nominated by the trade-unionist cabals who select the Labour
candidates.
And far too many Scottish Tory voters would vote for Genghis Khan if
he were selected by the tiny coterie of what used to be called the
landed gentry and the business community.
Why do we keep on accepting it? Yet, although the next General
Election is only months away, too many Scots would rather agonise over
who was the more vicious aggressor in 1296 than give a moment's though
to how we might make things better after the year 2000.
Granted that our Scottish education system is not a patch on what it
used to be, but surely we have not totally lost the capacity for
thought? Is it because we are too ignorant, or too stupid, or too busy
with our own affairs -- or all three?
We are obliged to delegate the job of running the country. But what do
we do to ensure that these delegates are competent to do the job? We do
absolutely nothing because our opinion is not invited.
All we are permitted to do is to select between candidates chosen by
small groups of activists who are, themselves, manoeuvring to get their
snouts in the trough.
We can let it be known that we will refuse to vote for candidates
whose qualities are unknown or unacceptable to us and who are foisted on
us by small anonymous groups of politically ambitious activists
exploiting fear, hatred, and distrust.
To claim that one is too busy to do anything about politics is
understandable but it is just a cop-out -- and an irresponsible one at
that. In less time than it takes to watch one of these perpetual
infantile shows on TV one can write a powerful letter to an MP, or the
Prime Minister, or the Press, or whoever.
Many decades of mismanagement have got to be corrected if the country
is to survive into the future. It won't be done by the politicians --
it's not in their selfish interests to do so. We will have to do it
ourselves and it could be done.

SCOTTISH Enterprise has admitted that all is not well with Training
for Work, the scheme for the long-term unemployed which was highlighted
in last week's Appointments section.
Bob Downes, director of industry and skills at Scottish Enterprise,
says: ''There are still problems with the performance of the scheme,
which we will be looking to improve over the year ahead.''
He explains how the initiative is vetted and monitored to avoid
problems: ''Training for Work is run in conjunction with local
enterprise companies, which are under contract to Scottish Enterprise.
''LECs have to check on all their training providers, and audit teams
are sent out to monitor and control the programme's performance.''
However, as audits are arranged in advance, organisers get the chance
to make sure participants are present. Therefore, there have to be other
precautionary procedures.
Anyone who approaches SE with an idea for a training programme is
vetted before the contract is awarded and after. ''There are standards
across the board for any training provider,'' says Downes. ''They must
supply a training plan for individuals on the course.
''We use a system called SQMS to monitor progress. It is used by a
range of other organisations and is so successful it has been requested
as far afield as Australia.''
Downes is confident that most problems can be solved. ''If there is a
problem usually we get some hint of it,'' he says, ''either through word
of mouth or from our auditors or training inspectors. They then
interview trainees to find out what's going on.''
But inspectors may find participants reluctant to provide them with
information which could jeopardise their programme. ''There's an extra
#10 a week on a giro for Training for Work,'' says one. ''You won't find
many people willing to risk that.''

By MARTIN ROSE, SECRETARY, SCOTTISH FEDERATION OF FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS'
CLUB.
MUCH has been written recently about the improvement in the
environment in which our national game is played following the
implementation of the Taylor Report.
While it is true to say that, particularly in the premier division,
our grounds are now not unreasonable places to spend two hours on any
day, there is one aspect of our game which requires to be addressed, and
while it does not need a learned judge to prepare recommendations, it
could have as great an impact in turning our game into a truly family
forum as any of the recommendations which Lord Justice Taylor laid down.
The issue is the continuing prevalence of foul and offensive language
which can be heard in all of our grounds. Although I am a spectator, and
the bulk of abusive language which I and fellow supporters often have to
put up with is from other spectators, the problem is not restricted to
the stands or the terraces, but can also be heard clearly from players
and from those occupying managerial positions in the dugouts.
If football is to attract a family audience, and in terms of
encouraging a wider customer base that must be the objective of all in
the game, then some steps must be taken to clean up the language.
Chairmen, who would not put up with bad language in their boardrooms,
should ensure that their employees modify their language to ensure that
it does not offend the customers who have paid good money to come and be
entertained. Similarly spectators should make use of stewards to ensure
that persistent offenders in the stands are warned about their
unacceptable behaviour.
It is a sad reflection on our game that Bob Fleeting in indicating
that he wished to relinquish control of Kilmarnock FC, indicated that
one of the reasons for so doing was because of verbal abuse which he had
to endure in the company of his son, notwithstanding the considerable
financial and emotional investment which he had to put into the club.
On a more optimistic note let me turn to one of the success stories of
Scottish Football -- the Coca-Cola Cup. On Saturday as I left Brockville
after a none too entertaining league match, I was buttonholed by a
fellow supporter obviously burdened by the woes of the world who advised
that the only way for Scottish Football to be improved was by abolishing
draws and forcing matches to be concluded by a win through playing extra
time followed, if necessary, by penalties.
I did not take much notice of the suggestion, but as I drove home, my
thoughts turned to it and also to the Coca-Cola Cup which on the
previous Wednesday had produced a number of pulsating and entertaining
matches.
Why had the fizzy Coke of midweek gone flat by the weekend? Could it
have been that as each cup match had to be played to a conclusion, there
was not the tendency for some teams to play for a draw? Why not
introduce this approach into league football.
''Ah but,'' I hear you say. OK, I will deal with some of the Ah buts.
''Teams would play defensively in the hope that they would win on
penalties.'' Maybe, but I think that in most cases teams would want to
win the match in regulation time.
''The Pools Promoters would object.'' Again maybe, but where a match
went into extra time, then, for the purposes of the pools, the drawn
result at the end of 90 minutes would be the one which would be used.
There are possibly other potential drawbacks with the proposal but it
could be that if implemented it would provide a boost to the game
through the encouragement of attacking play thereby attracting more fans
to matches.
Finally, a question which has puzzled me for a season or two and which
you can mull over as you watch your next match during which the
goalkeeper will wander around the penalty area clutching the ball --
''has the four step rule been abolished?''

I HAVE long held the view that it is sheer madness for Labour and the
Lib-Dems to oppose each other in constituencies where there is likely to
be a split vote, resulting in the Tory candidate winning.
I strongly advocate that in selected seats the two parties should
agree not to oppose each other on a quid pro quo basis where it is
highly likely that the Tory candidate can be defeated. Had such an
arrangement been in force in 1992 we would not have had a Tory success.
Of course, such an arrangement would be highly complicated,
particularly with so many changes in parliamentary boundaries, but it is
worth a try.
The situation in Scotland would be even more complex with the
existence of the SNP to be taken into account -- not that I advocate any
kind of pact with the SNP. That would be like supping with the devil.

SEVE Ballesteros, the most charismatic figure in European golf for the
last two decades, announced yesterday that he intends to take a
five-month break from tournament golf.
The three-times Open champion said from his home in Santander that he
was sure he was making a ''positive decision, which will enable me to
start a second phase of my career, during which I will be seeking
further major successes.''
Although he was a member of the victorious Ryder Cup team last week,
Ballesteros has had a fairly desperate season. He has been troubled by a
bad back, he has hardly been able to hit a fairway and, at 38, there are
those who thought his playing days must be nearing an end.
But Ballesteros insists: ''I would not want anyone to think this
decision has anything to do with early retirement. It is quite the
opposite''.
Indeed, the Spanish maestro declared defiantly that he intended to go
on playing until he was 54. ''Why 54? Because it will be a good age to
stop having been a professional for more than 35 years.
''My desire for success remains undiminished and I assure all my
supporters that I will be back.''
Ballesteros is everyone's favourite to captain the European Ryder Cup
team when they defend the trophy at Valderama in two years' time. That
role is traditionally a non-playing one and, unless his form improves
considerably, he may be forced onto the sidelines.
One side effect of his announcement is that a place now becomes
available in the Toyota World Matchplay championship at Wentworth next
month. That will surely now be filled by Scotland's Sam Torrance, the
current leader of the European Order of Merit.

PRINCE Naseem Hamed surprised everybody by replacing the razzamataz
with a show of respect in Cardiff yesterday.
But Hamed's praise of World Boxing Organisation featherweight champion
Steve Robinson was brief and to the point at the head-to-head two days
before the nine-stoners clash at the Cardiff Rugby Club.
Otherwise it was brash business as usual for the 21-year-old
challenger in the countdown to his first attempt to win a world title.
''I take my hat off to Steve Robinson and respect him as a world
champion,'' said Hamed. ''He's done the business and you can't take
anything away from him. He's a polite kind of guy and he's got a lot of
pride.
''But fights have to be built up. You can't have two fighters being
nice to each other. At the end of the day there's got to be a bit of a
grudge.''
The challenger's black T-shirt prematurely declared: ''Prince Naseem
Hamed World Champion,'' a slogan that just brought a grin from quiet man
Robinson.
Hamed said: ''Losing never enters my mind; only victory does. On
Saturday he (Robinson) will walk in the ring with his world title, but
leave without it. I'm planning to do the business in four rounds.''
Robinson replied: ''I'm looking forward to beating Naz. He is more or
less like a showman, but I'm the quiet type -- the people's champion.''

Frank Shennan sees jobs promise as Scots firms reach out to double
their foreign yield
SCOTTISH jobs are more reliant on international markets than those of
workers in England, Germany, Japan and the United States, and that
reliance is going to increase.
That is the true significance for employment of last week's launch of
a five-year strategy to boost Scottish exports. It means that few
recruits to Scottish firms, even the smallest, will be unaffected by the
trading conditions and demands of foreign markets.
''In 1993 Scotland's exports grew by over 19% to reach some #12bn
worth of manufactured goods -- that is #32,000 for every employee --
some one-third higher than the UK as a whole and higher than Japan,''
said Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch.
''And Scotland's exports, as a percentage of our Gross Domestic
Product, are higher than the UK, Germany, France, Japan and the USA.
Estimates are already showing that the figure for 1994 will reach over
#14bn, a further 20% increase.
''These are record-breaking figures, but we can and must do better.''
Doing better means broadening the export base into other sectors and
into smaller companies. ''More than half our current exports come from
whisky and electronics,'' said Kynoch.
''We should be proud of that. I've never heard the Germans moaning
that over 60% of their exports are from two or three sectors, including
engineering and cars. But I want all our industries to do just as
well.''
Development of the export strategy was led by the Scottish Exports
Forum and Scottish Trade International and is described in detail in a
document called The International Challenge. It sets a target of nearly
doubling Scottish exports to #23bn by the year 2000.
As part of its tactical objectives, it lists 12 ''key priority
markets'', ranging from French and German to Indian and the Russian
Federation. It also lists key sectors such as consumer goods, industrial
products, information industries and service sector industries,
including financial services, education and training.
The sectors highlighted in this tactical objective employ around
650,000 people between them, with three accounting for 100,000 or more
each -- the oil and gas industry (100,000) financial and business
services (212,000) and educational services (175,000).
Perhaps most significantly for employment and recruitment, however, is
the objective of ''company internationalisation''. A large part of the
focus will be on small and medium-sized companies (SMEs).
Not only has a target of a 10% increase been set for the number of
trainees undertaking validated export training and education by the year
2000, but a ''specific and ambitious'' target has been set for SMEs.
This is to increase the value of SME exports by 150% to #4bn in five
years.
''Exporting is not just for the big boys,'' said Kynoch. ''Many of our
small and medium-sized companies are already competing on the world
stage and there are more and more opportunities arising.
''But many of our companies don't know how to find out about
particular opportunities that may be available to them in an overseas
market. Nor do all firms, especially our smaller firms, know the various
requirements -- legal, financial, quality or labelling -- that exist
elsewhere. Because it sells here does not necessarily mean it will sell
there.''
Few, if any, companies have no export potential if the quality and the
price are right. Nor does the product have to be of obviously
international appeal.
As if to prove the point, in 10 days' time more than a dozen novice
exporters will be boarding Air UK flights from Aberdeen and Glasgow for
a Scottish Trade International mission to Belgium and Holland.
Though not among STI's 12 ''key priority markets'', they have been
marked out by the Department of Trade and Industry for its Begin In
Benelux campaign. They are regarded as a good starting point because of
the prevalence of English-speaking executives and their cultural and
geographical proximity to Britain.
The trade mission will include companies you might expect to find. For
example, Prime Meat of Inverurie in Aberdeenshire, which trades only in
beef, is looking to contact importers, retail chains and supermarkets.
Kelso-based Pettigrews, which manufacturers high-quality chutneys and
preserves as well as cakes and sauces, will be looking for distributors
and for orders from gourmet shops, delicatessens and gift stores.
Lochcarron of Galashiels produces knitwear that includes cashmere and
lamora while P &amp; J Haggart of Aberfeldy weaves tweeds which include
commissioned designs for the exclusive use of each of more than 100
estates.
However, you might not expect to find a sandwich-maker on the mission,
such as Green Meadow Foods (see story on right). Nor a company like
Netherplace Nets Limited, of Glasgow, a family-owned company making net
curtains.
It manufactures a unique range of Pastel Shaded Nets and has extended
its range of designs and fabrics. It is now looking for agents in
Holland as a step to gaining a foothold in a wider European market.
The lesson is that no company can afford to ignore its export
potential, and successful employees and job candidates will increasingly
be those who can contribute to that potential.

ERIC Cantona, who makes his comeback for Manchester United against
Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday after serving an eight-month ban for
aiming a Kung Fu-style kick at a Crystal Palace fan, is convinced he can
handle the abuse that is bound to come from rival -- and some rival
players.
''What I have to do now is to find a solution,'' says the 29-year-old
French international. ''That's what I think I have found now. Nobody
knows about it and I can't explain it. People will have to notice it
themselves.''
The thoughts of Cantona will be relayed at lunchtime tomorrow by Radio
5 Live, who have put together a compilation of interviews. The
controversial Frenchman admits: ''I play with passion and fire. I have
to accept this fire sometimes does harm.
''I harm myself. I'm aware of it. I'm aware of harming others. But I
cannot be what I am without those other sides of my character.
''I don't have to justify myself. I have no regrets. I have to correct
those faults but I have to remain true to myself.''
Cantona will have one brief from his manager Alex Ferguson on Sunday
-- don't tackle unless it is absolutely necessary.
''He is not a tackler,'' says Ferguson. ''I'm fed up telling him that.
He doesn't know how to do it, and usually ends up with a booking. Eric
doesn't like losing. If he feels there is a wrong, he has got to right
it.''
But Ferguson admits that his first thought after the bust-up with the
fan was to show Cantona the Old Trafford exit door. However, the United
board persuaded Ferguson that Cantona should stay and a multi-million
bid from Inter Milan was rejected.
Meanwhile, players yesterday put their weight behind a new campaign to
kick racism and intimidation out of football in the build-up to
Cantona's return to the game. Arsenal's Tony Adams, Liverpool's John
Barnes, and Chelsea's Dutch ace Ruud Gullit, have joined a campaign
backed by the Football Association and other authorities nationwide.
The joint themes are respect to all spectators and the elimination of
racism from football.
The FA are hoping to build on the success of a two-year campaign run
by the Commission for Racial Equality, the Professional Footballers
Association and the Football Trust.

THE eastward expansion of Nato is taken for granted, although when,
how, and, most importantly, where that expansion will take place is not
clear. It is a sensitive issue, made all the more tender by the anxiety
of countries like Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic who are
worried by Russian nationalism and keen to duck under the Nato umbrella
as quickly as possible. Frankly, they will have to wait. The whole
affair is burdened by problems which cannot be sorted out easily, as was
evident yesterday when Nato Secretary-General Willy Claes announced the
first part of a major study of the issues. As an initial attempt to sort
out some of the more problematic areas involved in enlargement, this was
not impressive. The document reasserts the doctrine of nuclear
deterrence as being at the heart of Nato's defence assumptions and
planning. Willy Claes was anxious to point out that the expansion of
Nato and the involvement of new members from formerly communist east
Europe would not be a threat to anyone. Enlargement, Nato believes,
would run roughly parallel to the enlargement of the European Union and
would play a vital role in binding the new eastern democracies into
Europe while enhancing the strength of their democratic institutions.
Nato, indeed, would remain a purely defensive military alliance.
All of this was aimed at Russia which views the entire process with
the deepest suspicion. This has been increased by that part of the Nato
document which makes clear that new members would have to assume the
responsibilities as well as the benefit of membership. In effect this
means that the eastern nations, once in membership, would potentially
have to allow Nato nuclear weapons and troops to be deployed on their
territory. They will have no problems with this but Russia, who will see
Nato weapons right up to her borders, is livid. Russia's mood has not
been improved by Nato's handling of the bombing campaign against the
Bosnian Serbs, through which the Kremlin feels it has been ignored and
humiliated. More deeply, it is fed by the growing realisation in Russia
of the relative weakness of her military, political, and economic
influence. Nato has tried to soften the blow to Russia by suggesting
that the stationing of troops and nuclear weapons in new member
countries would not happen automatically. This has not proved to be a
comfort for Moscow, but it is difficult to see what would. An alliance
either works cooperatively or it is not an alliance. Nato, in truth, has
no choice.
Where there is choice is in the timetable for enlargement, and on this
question the Nato planners are burdened by national politicians. The
decision on when and where to enlarge the alliance, in fact which
countries to choose and when, is not one that can be made by the
military. It is a political question and must be answered by the leaders
of Nato countries who have shown a reluctance to get involved and an
unfortunate enthusiasm for shifting the problem back on to Nato's
shoulders. The organisation is committed to following up this first,
vague study of the issue with a further one which is designed to
identify those nations which will be eligible for membership.
Unfortunately, the criteria for membership are hopelessly vague. How,
for instance, does a Nato planner decide when a democracy is stable or a
market economy flourishing? It is a heavy task and one which will
probably be derailed by elections in Russia and the United States. The
danger is that frustration and unease will increase the longer it takes.

CAWDER'S Alan Tait, the Scottish assistants' champion, yesterday
kicked himself out of the Edinburgh Crystal/Daily Express Scottish
matchplay championship at Glasgow Gailes.The incident may be without
precedent.
Tait, one down to Brian Marchbank, was walking towards his ball in a
fairway bunker at the seventeenth when he attempted to kick away a
stone, but it flew from the side of his shoe and struck the ball, 15
feet away, moving it two feet sideways within the hazard. Peter Lloyd,
the tournament director, penalised Tait a stroke under rule 18-2(i) and
the ball was replaced. No such incident could be found in the Royal and
Ancient Club's Decisions on the Rules of Golf.
In the first semi-final today Marchbank will meet Steven Thompson, who
beat Peter Smith with a No.9 iron shot to eight feet to birdie the
nineteenth. In the other semi-final Steve Martin will play Raymond
Russell. Once the afternoon's final has been decided so also will the
Ladbroke's 1995 Order of Merit.

BOWLS
SCOTLAND had another great day in the Saga International Open in
Preston yesterday. Hugh Duff reached the semi-finals with a
straight-sets win over holder Mark McMahon in last night's opening
quarter-final. In earlier second-round action, David Gourlay Jr and
Graham Robertson both won.
Duff needed just 16 ends to win 7-3, 7-0, 7-1. ''That's the best I've
played for quite some time,'' said the Cumbernauld man. ''I felt very
confident before the match -- it's probably the best I've ever played on
that rink.''
''I knew I would need to play well against Mark and I was happy with
my preparations throughout the day. I spent a big part of it in my hotel
room this afternoon just clearing my thoughts and psyching myself up for
the match.
''Mark didn't play badly, so I'm obviously delighted with the way I
played.''

Willie Anderson argues that the bargain book bonanza is likely to end
in tears for publishers, booksellers and readers.
SO IT is goodbye to all that stuff about the net book agreement --
about which most sane people, outside of the book trade, know or care
little. To the opponents of the NBA, mostly scribes of the Wapping
variety, it represented a grotesque cartel for overweight publishers
keen to ensure that all books were as expensive as possible. In truth,
it is virtually impossible to find a publisher who agrees with himself
let alone agreeing to set prices which are agreeable to a competitor.
The setting of minimum retail prices for books had been introduced in
the early 1900s by publishers to ensure that sufficient numbers of
booksellers survived long enough to sell their titles. Up until that
time there had existed a fearsome price war, which had resulted in many
bookshops disappearing faster than a collection of Tom Shields' Diary.
Since those early halcyon days of price stability, the book trade has
coped with an ever-expanding product range, at the same time as
increasing the number of outlets throughout the land to the benefit of a
good deal of the population. The NBA has survived the ravages of world
wars, the General Strike, numerous depressions and recessions, Ted
Heath's blitz on restrictive practices, two trials, a grand inquisition
by the House of Commons Heritage Committee, but it has succumbed,
perhaps finally, to the demands of short-term corporate greed.
Enormous pressure has been brought to bear on these corporate,
multi-national, all-embracing publishing concerns by their bigger, even
more corporate and multi-national institutional shareholders. These are
the same shareholders who agree to chief executives of the companies
they back having three-year rolling contracts because their own chief
executive has one.
Ian Bell's recent eloquent piece in this newspaper, which highlighted
so many of the losses the de-regulated book world is about to thrust
upon the public, was written too late. The book trade required that
support earlier, but people seldom realise what they are going to lose
until it has gone. By now many readers will have seen enticing offers
for reductions in book prices and for value-added deals. My
recommendation is to enjoy them while you can. This splurge of money-off
offers will not last forever.
In France, the French publishers undertook a similar liberating
exercise in the 1980s. Within the first year 20% of French book shops
had closed, with the casualty rate being as high as 50% in Paris. By the
end of the second year of freedom the government intervened to reinstate
a form of price maintenance before the book became a thing of rarity.
My great fear is for the literary culture and heritage of Scotland.
The publishing industry in this small country is not multi-national and
it has always had a symbiotic relationship with its retail counterpart.
Scottish booksellers have supported the growth and re-birth of this
important part of our national heritage and the public have responded.
Scottish publishers find it hard, if not well-nigh impossible, to sell
their titles outwith their homeland, and in the uncompromising world of
commercialism, will the supermarkets, which wish to bring cheap books to
more people, stock and support the local industry?
Of course they won't, because the Scottish publisher will not be able
to supply at the price they will demand. In this new world of the big
retailer catering for your literary tastes will the Scottish bookseller
survive? Scotland boasts two of the oldest independent bookselling
companies in the UK; my own is perhaps the oldest bookselling company in
the English-speaking world.
All indigenous companies face tremendous problems in attempting to
compete with the larger chains, as they will be unable to demand the
margins required to compete with the large national retailers. Does it
matter? No it doesn't if you have little regard for your own community,
but it will be extremely sad to see yet another valuable local service
being driven out of small-town life and condemning these towns to be
little more than executive dormitories.
Notwithstanding all that has been said above, new challenges are there
to be met and overcome. It is exhilarating and adrenaline inducing to
realise that things have moved on whether we like them or not. If we are
to survive, the trade cannot hanker for the past; the future has to be
viewed positively. It is, though, deeply regrettable that the future has
to be encountered in such a tarnished manner.
Once the euphoria has settled and the abolitionists start to count the
cost, it would not surprise me in the least if the anachronistic and
restrictive agreement were to be revived in some form or another to
ensure the continued well-being of these multi-national, and by that
time under-performing, companies. In the meantime, many will have left
the trade, many possible great writers may have been lost, and a few
corporate heads will be enjoying the severance fruits of their rolling
contracts.

WHEN the fixtures for the men's national league were initially
announced, Sunday's confrontation between defending champions Grange and
runners-up MIM looked to be a little special.
Both sides were expected to go into the game with maximum points.
Grange have certainly fulfilled that target whereas their city rivals
are languishing in the relegation zone without a point to their name,
having scored only one goal in their two outings for the loss of a
staggering 10.
Subsequently, the clash at McDiarmid Park, Perth, as part of the
league tournament will still be one of the day's top attractions -- but
for a completely different reason.
Chris Sutherland, the MIM coach, is as mystified as anyone at his
side's failure this season, but he is still confident his players can
beat Grange.
Meanwhile, pacesetters Touche Ross Gordonians have Insights Inverleith
as their opponents, but even although Jimmy Cox and Peter Fraser are
likely to miss the match through injury, they should still get the
verdict.
The women's league should see Western Klick Photopoint tighten their
grip on the first division when they travel to Menzieshill in what will
be the first meeting of the clubs.
Menzieshill only entered the league five years ago and have done
remarkably well in such a short space of time.
Alison Christie, their captain, while looking forward to the game,
sees it as one between the corner shop and the supermarket.

Having won at War-

though his followers could have been forgiven for thinking the
handicapper had caught up with him when he was second to Blaze Away
there last month.
However, Celeric proved he was still on a winning mark at York,
justifying support from 9-2 to 3-1 favourite, and can do so again today.

A FEW weeks before this year's local elections an SNP councillor in my
constituency sent out a press release which proudly described the 69 MPs
elected by the Scottish people who are not of his own Nationalist
persuasion as ''quislings who collaborate with their English masters''.
I thought of responding at the time, but why bother? Contrary to the
past week's indignant protests that this kind of talk is actively
discouraged by the Nationalist leadership, it is in fact their common
currency of political repartee as any regular perusal of the Scottish
local press will confirm.
When the elections came round, the councillor in question and his two
colleagues all lost their seats to Labour which struck me as the most
effective response on behalf of the ''quislings and collaborators''. I
suppose, incidentally, that Toom Tabard will be making a major comeback
in the lexicon of Nationalist abuse.
I am by no means averse to robust comment and the SNP are welcome to
call me whatever takes their fancy. I don't think it impresses many
people apart from themselves since normal citizens don't tend to think
that way. But Mr Salmond and his fractious cohorts are surely in danger
of protesting a little too much, instead of recognising that they have a
problem which it is in their -- and Scotland's -- interests to address.
In the past week's war of words there are essentially two positions.
Mr Salmond insists that the Scot Nats are a modern, democratic party
which has no truck with racism or extremism. George Robertson points to
''the darker side of nationalism'' and suggests that the language and
strategy of the SNP gives it succour.
The problem is that these two statements do not greatly overlap. It is
possible for them both to be 90% true. The SNP would not touch overt
racism, far less the loonier activities of the Nationalist fringe, with
a barge pole. But neither can it ever resist -- in the name of modern,
democratic politics -- pressing the same buttons which are favoured by
the darker forces.
Why on earth are they standing outside cinemas showing Braveheart in
order to hand out political leaflets? According to Mr Salmond's
conference speech it is due to the film's potential for ''inspiring''
Scots and teaching youngsters ''the truth'' about Scottish history.
There indeed speaks the forked tongue of nationalism.
As Mr Salmond well knows, Braveheart is a goodies and baddies parody
of one episode in Scottish history. His crude hope is that, by touching
the plaid of a reluctant Mel Gibson, he can exploit the anti-English
sentiments in the film. I think he will be disappointed. Cheering
Geronimo does not make one a Red Indian.
Do modern, democratic political parties really try to exploit
Hollywood bowdlerisations of 700-year-old history? I would have thought
that most parties answering to that description are more interested in
putting aside the ethnic conflicts of 50 years ago than in stirring up
those of the fourteenth century.
The kind of campaign which the SNP love to promote, but don't like to
be questioned about, was the ''southern Comfort'' effort with its clear
inference that ''southern'' -- ie English -- pensioners were basking in
centrally-heated luxury while the poor Scots froze. They knew it was
nonsense, so what was the modern, democratic thinking behind it?
Margaret Ewing, in her speech to the SNP conference, set out the
fundamentalist Nationalist case with some dignity. When the late John
Smith spoke just before his death, she said, of seeking only to serve
his country, he meant Britain. When she used that phrase, she meant
Scotland. Therein, she declared, lay the difference.
Well, fair enough -- though anybody who knew John Smith's fierce pride
in being Scottish and indeed Highland, would find it laughable that some
conflict should be driven between these loyalties and his desire to
serve the whole of Britain as a Labour Prime Minister.
But what the Nationalists must learn to recognise, if they are to earn
the mantle which they claim, is that while -- in their eyes -- serving
Britain is the inferior option to serving Scotland alone, it is not one
based on betrayal, servility or self-seeking perfidy.
Curiously, it took George Reid -- away from Scotland for 15 years --
to make that point, by distancing himself from the language of quislings
and Uncle Toms while Mr Salmond, who has been here all the time, could
not bring himself to say more than that Councillor Jim Mitchell had been
''speaking from the heart''. Nobody doubted it for a moment.
In a way, all of this was the sideshow to the real entertainment of
the Nationalist conference -- which was their belated discovery that if
things stay on their present course, the quislings and collaborators are
going to deliver a modern, democratic Parliament to Scotland despite the
SNP's best efforts, while they and the Tories fume from the sidelines.
Mr Salmond's attempts to clamber aboard, while the fundamentalists
continue to decry and denounce, represented political comedy of high
quality. Perhaps he is beginning to understand that January 30, 1989 --
the day he walked out of the Scottish Constitutional Convention -- is a
date more relevant to his party's prospects than 1314.
That was the blunder which helped ensure that they will still be
distributing leaflets outside the centenary remake of Brigadoon. As Jim
Sillars so succinctly put it in the Sun this week: ''Advantage
Robertson''.

KIERAN Fallon denounced Jockey Club justice yesterday after he lost
his appeal against an eight-day ban for irresponsible riding.
The jockey claimed officials were ''either not fair in their judgement
or don't know anything about racing'' after the disciplinary committee
dismissed his protest.
He was stood down from October 2-7 and 9-10 inclusive after he was
found to have bumped Witch of Fife as he squeezed through a gap on
Parrot Jungle in the Sale Fillies' Stakes at Haydock last Saturday.
Parrot Jungle went on to beat Witch of Fife by two and a half lengths,
but the placings were reversed. At yesterday's hearing the disciplinary
committee ruled that the gap ''was never big enough.'' Fallon claimed he
never came off a straight line and won on merit.

KELSO coach Eric Paxton declared yesterday that the club intended
appealing against a 16-week ban imposed on prop Darren Howlett following
a stamping incident during his club's first game of the premiership
season against Currie four weeks ago.
Howlett, 20, was sent off by referee Jim Johnstone of Gala, but Paxton
is adamant that the punishment does not fit the crime.
''This is a young boy trying to make his way in senior rugby,'' said
Paxton. ''He is not a dirty player and, at the time, nobody thought
anything much of the incident. The game was still flowing, nobody was
hurt, and Currie didn't complain at the time.
''We will be speaking to Currie and intend to appeal. It was a first
offence and seems very harsh to me.''
On the wider front, the issue raises again the unsatisfactory nature
of Murrayfield disciplinary procedures. The sending-off was reported by
the media at the time but no announcement on the outcome of the
disciplinary hearing was made by the SRU. Invariably, however, news of
the sentence leaks out via the clubs concerned.
Justice conducted behind closed doors, especially for misdeameanours
committed in such a public arena as a high-grade rugby match, is
unsatisfactory justice, and the rugby public deserves, at the very
least, official notification of disciplinary panel decisions.
* GREGOR Townsend, who made a convincing return to UK rugby with the
Barbarians on Tuesday after a summer spent with the Warringah club in
Sydney, is to be honoured by Edinburgh University.
Townsend, who had a try and a conversion in the Baa-Baa's showpiece
game against Stirling County, is leaving Scotland soon to throw in his
lot with Ian McGeechan's Northampton.
Yesterday, Edinburgh University announced that he is to be one of
three recipients of the Sir William Darling Memorial Prize, which is
awarded to students who ''shall by their conduct, their example, or
their pre-eminence in sport, have done in any year most to advance or
enhance the reputation of the university.''
Townsend graduated this summer from Edinburgh with an MA honours
degree in politics.
* BOROUGHMUIR have taken the bull by the horns. Change was needed at
half-back, and Bryan Easson, the North and Midlands stand-off, has been
recalled in his district role for 'Muir's first division match against
Watsonians tomorrow at Meggetland.
Easson, who displaces his district colleague Andy Knight, will partner
Graeme Beveridge for the first time in a league match. Beveridge, the
Scotland under-19 scrum half last season, resumes after injury, and Iwan
Tukalo, Boroughmuir's international wing, also comes back, as does Neil
Dickson, whose namesake, Gordon, the former Haddington flanker, makes
his Meggetland debut.

Stewart Fraser goes aboard a sturdy seafarer
WE should have known what to expect. Making an overnighter during a
holiday weekend, almost by definition, was asking for it. And we got it.
Leaving Helensburgh on the Saturday, the Voyager 35, a solid,
no-nonsense motor sailer with lines by Angus Primrose, was reefed right
down. The 379sq ft overlapping genoa was sighted to half-way between the
spreaders. We didn't even think of easing the main from its cosy furling
inside the mast.
We made a steady 4 knots on a heavy south-westerly. A steady heel past
the Tail of the Bank, on to Gourock, allowed a serious test of the
galley facilities.
The two-burner cooker provided hot soup, hot pizza, and coffee all
round. The hot and cold pressure taps dealt with washing up, in a fixed
basin, with draining board to boot.
Clyde Coastguard kept up a steady warning of ''Gales 8 to 9, Mallin
area'' and we turned on the big Volvo diesel, making gradual but
uncomfortable progress motor sailing to our destination of
Tighnabruaich.
The Voyager has inside steering, but we didn't use it. Real sailors
stay outside, and get cold and wet, and blown about. Everything is
worked from the cockpit. We didn't need to try the safe-tread decks or
the full-length jackstays, but it was good to know they were there.
Real sailers also know when to give way. One to two knots in a lumpy
sea is tedious. Lochgoil became the objective and it was interesting --
hectic might be a better word -- to have a 5.5-ton boat making 7.9 knots
under about half of normal sail area.
That was with winds gusting to 34 knots, a good Force 7.
At least we had the wind with us, no more bumping up and down in the
swell. There were two other sails in sight. Where they were going, we
couldn't guess. Lochgoilhead was made long before dark. Getting the
handbuoy from the visitor's mooring was a problem in the strong winds,
but finally overcome.
Not having to anchor was a blessing. The east side of the loch is very
steep and not noted for good holding. There was no point in even
thinking of untying the dinghy from the deck. Winds were up to gale
force by now. It was time to check out the bunks and make sure the
sleeping bags were still dry.
With three aboard, we could leave the table up. It can be dropped to
make a good double berth. Forward, there is again a double -- and
there's lots of room for one -- and the ''coffin berth'' beneath the
starboard bunk gives its own reassurance on a swinging night.
Oilies went in to a capacious wet locker, about 4ft deep. There was
standing headroom throughout, including the heads with its own wash-hand
basin. We ran lighting on one of the heavy duty batteries: better to
ensure a good start on the Sabbath, for getting back to base.
The wind had backed to north-westerly by the time breakfast was over,
with around 20 knots on the gauge. With any luck, we could run home
under sail. In fact, we came back in sunshine, with rainbows for company
-- part of the way.
The genoa was down below storm jib size, and 4 knots was an easy pace,
in an unsteady sea. Top reading this time was a 46-knot gust, well into
Gale 8, as the Coastguard had warned.
Again, picking up the mooring was a small problem. A danbuoy-style
pick-up would make things easier. Larger bow rollers would be a good
idea. For the rest, perhaps a coolbox would fit below the draining
board. The central heating system was not used: that could have got rid
of morning condensation. Details, really.
In all, a solid sail in a sturdy seafaring boat. Keeping the sail area
to a sensible level kept us on a fairly even keel, most of the time.
That's about all that real sailers expect, on a holiday weekend.

As Israel and the PLO sign a historic accord over the West Bank,
breaking the deadlock with Syria is the next crucial step, says John
Battersby.
YASSER ARAFAT calls it ''the peace of the brave''. Shimon Peres says
it is history in the real meaning of the word: a moral and historical
choice by the Jews. Islamic extremists brand it as a sell-out. And
right-wing Jews say Israel is capitulating to the Palestinians.
They can't all be right but the cynics would say it sounds like a
deal.
Yesterday's Israeli-PLO signing ceremony at the White House marks the
crucial phase in the implementation of a historic compromise sealed in
Washington two years ago; broader Arab acceptance of Israel in return
for a sizeable chunk of what many Jews regard as the biblical land of
Israel.
It consolidates the 16-year-old peace begween Egypt and Israel --
albeit a cold one -- and last year's pact between Jordan and Israel.
But the real test of its success will be whether it helps end the
deadlock in the three-year negotiations for a peace accord between
Israel and Syria.
American mediators are hopeful that it will. Israeli and Syrian
officials are more cautious and much arm-twisting lies ahead.
While Syria's President Hafez al-Assad has cited Israeli intransigence
on security arrangements following an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights as the obstacle, there is a deeper underlyng reluctance by Syria
to break ranks and deal with Israel until the Palestinians have a
reasonable deal.
A deal with Lebanon, largely at the mercy of Syria, would flow
automatically from an Israel-Syria accord and thus normalise Israel's
relations with its traditional adversaries.
This is how yesterday's accord could help in the search for a
comprehensive Middle East peace which would give Israel an inner circle
of Arab states prepared to deal with it and thus further isolate the
hardliners in Baghdad, Teheran, and Tripoli.
As Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has pointed out on many
occasions, a Palestinian takeover of the West Bank -- and even the
creation of a Palestinian state which is the logical conclusion of this
accord -- does not in itself pose a security threat to Israel.
The real threat is from a nuclear Iran in the long-term and, to a
lesser extent, from renegade states like Iraq and Libya in the
shorter-term.
Israel has accepted in the past year or so that resolving the
Palestinian question is an essential precursor to normalising its
relations with the rest of the Arab world.
The past two years have seen an escalation in violent clashes between
Arabs and Jews and the horror of suicide bombings by Islamic militants.
But the peace process has gained a momentum of its own.
If this momentum can be maintained, the peace process could prove
resilient enough to face the toughest issues which stll lie ahead; the
future status of Jerusalem -- which both Arabs and Jews want as their
capital -- the status of some three million Palestinian refugees in the
Arab world, and the future of Jewish settlers in an emerging Palestinian
state.
But the constant bickering, walkouts, and high drama that led to the
latest agreement -- and which will continue -- should not be allowed to
obscure a moment in history; a compromise agreement by the leaders of
two peoples to differ, to live apart.
''Sometimes in the real world moments of messianic importance can look
like trivial events,'' says political scientist and philosopher Shlomo
Aviner, of Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
The big-bang fantasy of a Palestinian state, for decades a distant
dream, is becoming a creeping reality.
The relief that comes with shedding the burden of occupation is
already evident in the eyes and smiles of young Israeli soldiers at
checkpoints on the West Bank.
In interviews granted to Israeli media around the signing of the
agreement in Taba, Egypt, last weekend, Mr Rabin launched a marketing
campaign to sell his vision to the Israeli public.
He said that the two main ideological tenets of nationalist and
religious Jews -- that the West Bank is an inalienable part of the
biblical land of Israel and that the 135,000 Jewish settlers there are
vital to Israel's security -- had all but evaporated.
''For me, the pioneers today are not the settlers,'' Rabin said. The
pioneers were Jews from the diaspora who migrated to Israel and
''advance our society and economy''.
''The ultimate targets for me are to maintain Israel as a Jewish, not
a bi-national, state; to agree to the existence of a Palestinian entity
living in peace alongside Israel . . . and to create a separation
between Israel and this entity.''
Rabin's marketing dilemma is that to sell the deal to Israelis, he has
to belittle Arafat's achievements.
''In one sense it is a major victory for Israel and a minimalist
settlement for Arafat,'' Averini said.
''But the fact is that Arafat is more in control of the situation than
he was a year ago. He has done a relatively good job given the
impossible circumstances under which he is working,'' he said.
Arafat, whose financial handouts from the Arab world had all but dried
up after the 1991 Gulf war, has consolidated an astonishing political
turnabout while at the same time moving closer to the prospect of an
independent Palestinian state.
Cautiously funded by Western donors, and increasingly beholden to
Western demands, Arafat has strengthened his foothold in Gaza and
Jericho and appears to have made headway in defusing the political
threat from Islamic militants with a skilful mix of carrot and stick.
Said Kaanan, chairman of the board of trustees of the Independent
Centre for Palestinian Research and Studies in Nablus, says the latest
agreement was predictable if one had followed the statements of Rabin
over the past two years.
''Since the Oslo accord was signed, Rabin has been true to his word.
He has implemented most of the things he promised,'' Kaanan says.
Rabin has succeeded in manoeuvering Arafat into a position where his
own political life depends on his ability to counter terrorism from
Islamic militants in his own midst.
''If Rabin loses the next election, he has his pension and his
retirement to look forward to,'' says Kaanan.
''If Arafat loses the Palestinian election, he is finished. His life
hangs on the thread of terrorism.''

An invitation to lunch with Rory Bremner is a sure sign that you are
about to be the next victim of his satirical mimicry. He tells Phil
Penfold how people make an impression on him
BORN in Edinburgh on April 6 in 1961, Rory Bremner shares a birthday
with both Paul Daniels and Ian Paisley. ''I hope,'' he says, ''that that
is all we have in common.''
The comedian-impressionist-satirist starts a new series of Rory
Bremner -- Who Else? on Saturday next week for Channel 4, and as usual,
is going to delay the recording of the show ''right until the last
minute''.
''We tape it the night before, and even then there might be
opportunities for last-second lines to be added. It all depends what
comes up,'' he says.
Talking to Bremner, you're never quite sure which one of ''no more
than 100, I suppose'' of his voices he'll slip into next. Not only
voices, but uncannily accurate tics of the eyes, little hand gestures,
movements that give a spot-on living caricature of the celebrity line-up
that is his stock-in-trade.
One minute he's Tony Benn, the next he's Douglas Hurd. And, reveals
Bremner, he's got a new way to study his ''victims'' at close quarters.
''The team and I have hit on this idea of having a couple of lunches
each week, where we invite famous people to come along and have a meal
while discussing contemporary events and political situations. I listen
to their views and opinions, and as well as being a useful back-up on
which subjects to tackle, it also gives me a closer look at our guests
and what makes them tick.''
Visitors to the Bremner dining table in recent weeks have included Dr
Jonathan Miller (an uncanny impression of the good doctor in full
intellectual spate follows), Alan Clark, George Walden, and John
Prescott.
''New voices?'' queries Bremner. ''well, they'll include Dale Winton,
Jeffrey Archer, Michael Barrymore, John Redwood . . .
''Paradoxically, it's getting harder to pick out targets that all the
public will know. Because there's just so much television these days.
When Mike Yarwood was doing his shows, there were fewer 'personalities'
around, so everyone knew who Malcolm Muggeridge or whoever, was . . .
today, with hundreds of TV channels, who knows who is presenting what? I
don't have a satellite dish myself, and that's a deliberate decision. In
fact, I'm not a great watcher of TV in the first place, and I far prefer
to listen to Radio 4.
''But there are some 'names' I just can't 'kill off', however much I
try. If I didn't do Ian McCaskill any more the nation would be up in
arms. I'm not allowed out of buildings unless I do another favourite,
Richie Benaud.''
It's a skill he puts to use in a new video to be released later in the
autumn, Rory Bremner -- Creased, in which the game of cricket comes
under his deadly and hilarious scrutiny.
He recalls the time he met one of his ''victims'' in unusual
circumstances. ''Yeah. I've met the Prime Minister twice, and once was
in the gents at Edgbaston. I was standing there, and John Major shambled
in in that way he does, and started doing what every bloke who visits
the urinal does. It was good to see him taking the p*** out of himself
for a change!''
A tireless worker for charities and good causes, Bremner also does
benefits for issues he believes in. Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace,
and Transport 2000 have all received the Bremner seal of approval, and
it appears that the guy never stops, with a succession of voice-overs,
training videos, private functions, and cabarets. ''No Masonics!
Although I did once do a show for a group of Chief Constables. You never
can tell, can you?
''Actually, one of the hardest jobs is going to those private dos, and
someone asking -- as they inevitably do, 'Will you do an impression of
the managing director? He'd really love it!' You have to patiently
explain that you just don't whizz off something like that in a matter of
seconds.''
In fact, it takes hours of watching videos (and sometimes catching the
person in ''live performance'') to perfect a Bremner parody. ''I love
this job,'' he says. ''It's a synthesis of the characters that makes me
laugh, and the politics that annoy me intensely.''
It's an interesting thought, I point out, that he does actually look
like a younger Paddy Ashdown. ''Yes,'' he reflects, ''it's been said
before. I'm Paddy Ashdown without the sexual charisma. If you find me in
Bosnia in a flak jacket in 10 years' time, I'll have taken over.
Actually, I admit that I am still quite uncomfortable when I meet my
targets at a party or a reception or whenever. I wonder if they've seen
the programme, and how much warmth there is in the handshake.
''There are a couple of accents that elude me -- one is a proper
Geordie, which is notoriously difficult -- and a couple of people. The
two that spring to mind are Frank Bough and Noel Edmonds. I think Noel
is actually dying to have someone take him off, and no-one ever does.
But you can't do everybody -- I'm not a machine.''
While he does acknowledge that there are some superb politicians out
there -- as far as the mimicry goes (''you have to go down on your knees
and thank God for Malcolm Rifkind''), he adds: ''There are also a lot of
totally faceless people who are well up in the Government. All the
character has been washed out of them. They're bland and uninformed.
''And that's rather worrying, because inevitably in my business, your
act does shrink with 'natural wastage'. Brian Jonston's gone now, so has
Kenneth Williams -- unique, both of 'em. Who's going to replace them?
''Nevertheless, we live in fascinating times, and the show has to
reflect that. Our first priority is, of course, to make people laugh,
but I look on Who Else? as a sugar-coated pill, because there's a
certain amount of seriousness underlying it all. I want the chuckle
first and then the realisation of the fact to sink in seconds later.
Sometimes I do regret being so hard on certain people, but then I think
that with others I should have gone even tougher. Michael Winner, for
instance.
''I know Bob Monkhouse wasn't happy at all after I'd done him on one
programme. But I'd given his quiz show persona, and he hates being seen
as just that.''
One of the major problems to overcome for the new series, says
Bremner, ''is that you cannot parody certain songs. We've had the
devil's own job to get permission to use the music for The Girl From
Ipanema and Don't Put Your Daughter on the Stage, Mrs Worthington. We
keep getting knocked back by the publishers, no matter how hard the
researchers try.
''Inevitably, when you're setting up a show like this, ideas fall by
the wayside because they can't be sustained. You can get comedy that has
been over-brainstormed. I'll tell you what. You have to serve an
apprenticeship in television light entertainment before you even know
what comedy is. You have to have form, and content. I almost take the
voices for granted now.
''What's my mission?
''To get underneath the skin of Britain.''

<HEADLINE>Footsie eases amid war for Norweb</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976142528</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE outbreak of a bidding war for Norweb triggered a fresh burst of
takeover speculation in the electricity sector which drove the FTSE-100
Index up 12 points at one stage, before it ended down 6.0 points at
3479.
''It is a very nervous market, certainly in some of the second liners
as well,'' one trader said.
Trading volume was higher at 718 million shares and losers led gainers
by six to one.
''I think you're going to have more choppy days,'' a second dealer
said. ''It's the corporate news that sets the market buzzing and we got
that today.''
The bond market drifted without clear direction following Wednesday's
sell-off after a poor gilts auction. There was some switching into
longer maturities. The December long-gilt future eased 1/32 to 105-9/32.
Early news that Norweb had recommended a #1700m joint offer from the
US power companies Houston Industries and Central South West got the
market off to a strong start.
But North West Water, which had earlier offered #1600m for Norweb,
struck back with a higher id of #1720m. This sent Norweb shares soaring
117[1/2]p to 1083p, while North West fell 21p to 584p.
The bidding war provoked speculative gains among electricity companies
seen as likely takeover targets. Southern shot up 24p to 836p and London
rose 16[1/2]p to 828[1/2]p.
Manweb, which is still talking to a potential white knight to save it
from a hostile bid by ScottishPower, rose 12p to 1014p. ScottishPower
was also up 3p at 346p.
Guinness dropped 8p to 508[1/2]p, despite a 6% increase in interim
pre-tax profits to #340 million, after warning that spirit drinkers were
going down market in their choice of brands.
Guinness denied market rumours that it was planning to bid for hotels
and restaurants group Grand Metropolitan, but GrandMet was hoisted 21p
to 443p anyway on separate talk that its Burger King chain might be up
for sale.
Forte, another hotels and restaurants group, lost 10p to 243p after
revealing a slow start to the second half of the year.
Eurotunnel fell by a further 5p to 84p after announcing plans to slash
its duty-free prices by a third. The market interpreted the price-cuts
as a desperate attempt to raise revenues to tackle its financial crisis.
Building materials giant Redland was lifted 6p to 370p after a solid
advance in interim profits to #165m. This prompted some investors to
switch out of fellow building industry supplier RMC which dropped 31p to
1069p.
United News &amp; Media, which publishes the Daily Express, lost 19p to
514p after warning that full-year profits would be adversely affected by
falling circulation revenue and higher newsprint costs.
Perth-based composite insurer General Accident was down 8p at 614p
after announcing a #134.9m share placing to finance its purchase of
Provident Mutual for #170m.
Publisher Cassell lost 12p to 131p on expectations that it would
suffer from the collapse of the Net Book Agreement.
TV production group Flextech added 14p to 445p after confirming that
it plans to sell its cable TV business.
Shipping and construction group Trafalgar House was cut 2p to 28[1/2]p
after adverse comments on its probable dividend payout by the Financial
Times.
Higgs &amp; Hill added its name to the growing list of builders under
pressure, and it shed 7p to 78p after saying public works contracts were
down.
Aerostructures Hamble has accepted a takeover bid worth #18m from
engineering firm EIS and Aerostructures dived 4p to 31p in reply to the
share offer.

Jaguar gets away elegantly with its long-wheelbase departure, reports
Ross Finlay
WHEN the latest range of Jaguar saloons was introduced, the two things
which needed improving -- apart from the cheap-looking single front
wiper still, alas, unimproved -- were the rear legroom and the amount of
luggage space.
The overall lines of the car, and the bulkiness of the spare wheel,
mean that very little can be done about the boot volume. But the long
wheelbase versions now available certainly take care of passenger room
in the rear.
Although my drive in a long-wheelbase car was on local roads, it was
on an earlier exercise in the south of France that I appreciated the
appeal of what has become the classic Jaguar line. In the Riviera
resorts, people are used to seeing the most expensive products of
Stuttgart, Munich and Modena cruising along. But a remarkable number of
them swivel round to watch a top-class Jaguar pass by.
One of the reasons for this is that Jaguar styling, because of
financial constraints, has recently been a matter of refining the
existing bodyshell rather than offering anything altogether new. So the
Jaguar XJ and Sovereign saloons, and the top-of-the-line Daimlers, are
not competing directly in appearance with luxury car rivals in mid-1990s
style. There is simply nothing like them.
A few years ago we were appalled by the efforts of the unspeakable
Leyland management to downgrade Jaguar. As a result, many journalists
were over-sympathetic to the company when it regained its independence,
to the extent that we really wanted to believe all its claims of
improved quality control.
The best thing that has happened to Jaguar in the last quarter-century
is its take-over by Ford. The #1.6 billion price seemed colossal at the
time, but it meant that the new American management would stand no
nonsense whatever about slaphappy work in the Coventry factory. The
Jaguars in the showrooms now are the best quality cars of the make that
most of us have ever seen.
When it came to stretching the standard-wheelbase saloon, Jaguar
designers had to perform a balancing act. They planned to add almost
five inches to the wheelbase and 4.5 inches of rear legroom. But they
were in danger of spoiling the original elegant proportions, and there
was always the possibility that the extra length would harm the
accomplished combination of handling qualities and ride, which places
the Coventry cars high up in the luxury car league.
They have got away with it, both statically and dynamically. The LWB
cars just manage to avoid looking as if they are bending in the middle.
And, while the driver is always conscious of having a very long car
under his control, especially when it comes to making left turns in
town, little of the agility has been lost, and the ride remains
remarkably supple.
The new rear doors open very wide, and there is at last no problem
about knee-room and foot-room. As in the front seats, there is good
thigh support in the rear, although one passenger felt the seat was a
little lumpy and, with the central armrest down, designed for somebody
broader in the beam. Despite the low roofline, headroom is quite
reasonable.
The long wheelbase style is an extra-cost option on the XJ6, Sovereign
and XJ12, at prices from #32,200 to #56,000. It is not available in the
Sport specification or on the XJR, which seems fair enough. On the other
hand, it is now normal on the Daimler Six at #52,950 and the V12-engined
Double Six which tops the price list at #65,950.
If you want a really high-performance Jaguar, of course, you go for
the XJR; but the heavier LWB saloons are no slouches in the luxury
class. The 3.2-litre engine will take a manual transmission version to
60mph in eight seconds and go on to a test track maximum just short of
140mph. At the top of the range, the six-litre V12, available only in
automatic form, reaches 60mph in under seven seconds and is capable of
an autobahn top speed of 155mph.
Fuel economy tends to be of the if-you-have-to-ask type. A 3.2 manual
will manage 35mpg at 56mph, 29 at 75 and 19mpg in town. A V12 automatic
will hardly better 26mpg at 56mph, 21 at 75 and an apologetic 13mpg in
city streets.
As far as performance is concerned, the cars seem effortless rather
than fire-breathing. It is also remarkable that such bulky saloons,
running on wide tyres and with powerful engines under their bonnets,
should be so quiet running.
Jaguar has few equals in the fight against noise, vibration and
harshness, and it is interesting that parent company Ford is now putting
so much emphasis on the same thing in its own smaller saloons, estates
and hatchbacks.
Then there's the Jaguar and Daimler way with interior specifications.
Discreet walnut trim, fine upholstery, ingenious switchgear, excellent
detailing -- these are all the company's hallmarks.  And yet these more
massive LWB cars remain a pleasure to drive. All we need now is double
the number of wipers.

<HEADLINE>American cattle breeders round up Aberdeen-Angus</HEADLINE>

COMMERCIAL cattle breeders in America are turning to Aberdeen-Angus to
improve the quality of their herds, ''TD'' Steele, president of the
American Angus Association, said yesterday.
''A lot of them have been experimenting with cross breeds but they're
coming back to the Angus for quality,'' he told an international
gathering at the breed's Heritage '95 event at Inverurie.
Part of the reason for the growing popularity of Aberdeen-Angus in the
USA was its ability to attract a premium price both from meat packers
and from feed lot operators, he said.
''These feed lots will have 30,000-50,000 head at a time. They have
Herefords, Simmentals and Charolais but they put the black cattle in
with them to help the sale. The packer's buyer will ask how many blacks
are in the pen and that will help the bids. That is why the breed is so
strong in America.''
He pointed out that cattle prices had fallen 20% in America over the
last 18 months and were not expected to begin to pick up again until
1996-97. The normal pattern in those circumstances was for breeders to
begin reducing herd sizes. Contrary to expectations this had not
happened to Aberdeen-Angus during the current price fall period.
''We have had a good increase in registrations -- up from 214,000 head
to 224,000 this year. We are still increasing and we are doing it at the
expense of other breeds.''
These figures make Aberdeen-Angus America's largest beef breed in
terms of annual registrations -- twice as large as Limousins, their
nearest competitor. ''Why the Limousins got popular I do not know,''
said Mr Steele. ''I have bred Limousins but as far as I am concerned
there is no comparison between them and the Angus.''
The success of the Certified Angus Beef Programme in America had been
phenomenal, he added. Sales were running at 225 million pounds in weight
a year, and Japan had become a top export market -- taking about 20
million pounds a year. A 50% premium tax brought the price in Japan up
to about $7.50 a lb and still it sold well.
Aberdeen-Angus were bred all the way from Canada down to Mexico and
had proved adaptable to a wide variety of climates, he said. In his own
operation Mr Steele had 350 cows. About 25% of the bull calves are
castrated and sold to feeders. The best of the bulls are sold into
pedigree herds and the rest to commercial herds.
''When I started in 1950 we were going for small cattle producing
'baby beef' that would sit on the plate,'' he recalled. ''In 1968 we
decided they were too small and bred them for size -- about 65 inches
tall at the head. Now we are back down to about 58 inches.''
On the domestic front Bob Crockatt, president of the Aberdeen-Angus
Cattle Society, reported that 130 new pedigree herds had been founded in
the UK and Ireland this year. For the first time in a decade more than
100 bulls have been catalogued for the breed's main autumn show and sale
at Perth next month. For the first time the catalogue will include
estimated breeding values based on the best linear unbiased predictor
analysis.
''The Aberdeen-Angus is the fastest-growing beef breed in the UK and
Ireland and is set to recapture its leading position as the pre-eminent
breed for the production of quality beef,'' said Mr Crockatt. The
renewed interest was being driven by demand from High Street butchers,
meat wholesalers and leading hotels and restaurants.''
The Heritage '95 gathering attracted 250 breeders from eight
countries.

THOUSANDS of species of wild animals may be facing major problems or
even extinction because of conflicts between the animal welfare and
conservation lobbies, it was claimed yesterday.
Until such time as communication between the two factions improved
vital resources would continue to be squandered, according to Suzanne
Boardman, a wild animals consultant.
Conservation of species was a numbers game, while animal welfare was
more subjective, she told delegates to the British Veterinary
Association congress on the opening day of its three-day run at
Winchester in Hampshire.
This gave rise to many conflicts. Welfarists argued for total freedom
of wild animals, while conservationists were prepared to confine animals
to preserve genetic lines.
Euthanasia or culling to limit populations and improve conditions for
others also split the different camps. ''There will always be
differences between those organisations whose aims are primarily either
welfare or conservation, especially with regard to priorities for
project funding,'' said Mrs Boardman.
But lack of detailed information and of communication resulted in many
grossly inaccurate assumptions being made leading to wildlife projects
or actions aggravating the problems they were intended to solve.
The animals themselves were then the sufferers.
This poor communication had been further exacerbated by the
polarisation of the welfare and conservation organisations themselves.
''Increased, albeit limited, communication is now occurring on a
personal level although there are still intractable factions in both
camps.
''However, despite their differences, the vast majority of respected
conservation and welfare organisations now recognise that although their
aims may be different there is a considerable overlap in their
objectives and project requirements.''
There remained a need for ready access to an independent database on
wildlife projects and research.

SIR Rocco Forte had a broader than usual smile yesterday after he was
able to demonstrate that the UK hotels operations were continuing to
improve with both the London and regional hotels able to raise their
profit contributions by 13%.
Rising numbers of tourists were a major factor as was better
conference business but UK domestic leisure was more depressed although
reduced numbers were still prepared to spend a little more.
The group's global pre-tax profits increased 39% to #75m, excluding
the benefits from the 25% stake in Gardner Merchant contract catering
operation which brought in an exceptional #65m surplus. That was offset
by a #35m charge for unwinding earlier year interest rate swaps and
which had already been forecast.
Sir Rocco said the Scottish hotels had performed well, particularly in
Edinburgh, St Andrews and North Berwick while that at Glasgow Airport
benefited from renovation.
The restaurant business presented a less happy picture with sales and
profits ahead by only 7% with Little Chef being forced by the competiton
to upgrade and become more ''experiential''.
Anecdotally, this chain and also Happy Eater seem to be suffering at
the hands of Granada in particular.
There is satisfaction that at long last, Forte has decided to face
reality and draw the line under Travelodge in the US. It has net assets
of about #100m and will achieve trading profits this year ofabout #7m.
It is now on an improving trend but has in the past absorbed far too
much management time -- at one time Sir Ian McGregor of British Steel,
and other fames, was in charge to put some semblance of order into the
business.
Paris has been disappointing thanks to the deadly combination of the
now artficially high franc exchange rate, economic uncertainty,
terrorist bombs and more recently the nuclear tests. The Meridien hotels
were poofitable although the original Forte owned units incurred a #2m
loss against breakeven last year. Sir Rocco dd not rule out sales in
that city.
However, the Meridien purchase has outperformed and will benefit from
the current reorganisation which will reduce costs in the 52 hotels by
#12m in a full year.
It has also given Forte valuable experience as an international
hotelier. One advantage is that it can now offer a much more complete
and compelling contract management service to hotel owners which it is
now beginning to exploit in the Far East including China.
Since the half year, Forte has sold the Harvester restaurant chain to
Bass for #165m and has put the Whte Hart group of third division hotels
in the shop window but without a sales tag. They have a net asset value
of #140m and are marginally profitable.
Debt currently is equivalent to gearing of 53%.
The City took one look at the Forte only maintained interim dividend
and knocked 10p off the shares at 243p.
However the underlying cash flow is so limited that Forte took the
right decision and seems set to only maintain the full year payout at
7.5p for a 3.9% yield on profits of perhaps #180m and earnings of 13.7p.

PRODUCT OF THE WEEK
IN starting up their own Personal Equity Plan (PEP), Edinburgh Unit
Trust Managers would not pretend that they were operating at the keen
end of the market in terms of charges.
As with so many schemes these days, there is no actual initial PEP
charge but the initial charges on the unit trusts vary from 5% to 5.75%
depending on the choice of fund, of which Edinburgh has a range of 13.
Eight of these are ''qualifying'' which means at least 50% of their
assets are invested in shares quoted either in the UK or on the stock
markets of the EU.
In addition to the unit trust charges, the annual charge is 1.25% to
1.5%. So investors looking for the lowest charges available will have to
go elsewhere.
What the fund management group aims to do its provide capital growth
where sought, a good income if this is the pre-requisite, or a
combination of both. Of course, there is the usual PEP no tax
attraction.
Edinburgh Unit Trust Managers' track record is good in parts, not so
good in other parts which is probably true of most fund management
groups. Among the best performing of the funds is the Edinburgh UK
Smaller Companies fund and the Edinburgh International Capital and
Income Fund.
At the other end of the scale is the not so good performing Edinburgh
Eurofund. Of course, this is not neccessarily a guide to the future but
one has to start somewhere and choosing a PEP has become increasingly
complicated.
So far as the basics are concerned, there is a minimum lump sum
investment of #1500 or regular savings from #100 to #500 per month.
Existing Edinburgh unit trust holders can switch into the Edinburgh PEP
subject to a charge of 1%.
Additional lump sum investments can be made subject to a minimum of
#500 and subject to the annual PEP limits, although this can be spread
across more than one trust.
Investors can invest up to the full #6000 annual PEP allowance in
eight of Edinburgh's unit trusts. The non-qualify PEPs investment is
limited to #1500 of the annual allowance. This covers unit trusts which
do not met the 50% rule covering the UK and EU but invest more widely in
Inland Revenue recognised stock exchanges outside these areas.
The managers have introduced a risk rating to help investors to select
the unit trust most appropriate for their needs thus, for example,
Edinburgh UK Smaller Companies is described as a medium/higher risk
while Edinburgh Preferred High Income Fund, where the aim is to achieve
a gross yield of 7.75%, is lower risk.
But Edinburgh Unit Trust Managers also sensibly advises that investors
should consult their independent investment advisers for further
information on risk.

BETTING and pubs group Brent Walker yesterday announced further
multi-million pound losses and said it had been overshadowed by the
success of the National Lottery.
The group lost #51.4m before tax in the six months to end of June. In
the corresponding period last year losses were #73.5m when the group
suffered even more heavily from interest bills on its #1500m debts.
In the William Hill betting chain the number of bets placed fell by
11.5% in the first half the year.
''We are encouraged by the results of Pubmaster but view the results
of William Hill with extreme concern,'' commented chief executive John
Leach.
''It is now apparent the National Lottery has succeeded far beyond the
Government's expectations,'' he added.
It had taken off to such an extent ''that unfair restrictions placed
on similar activities are no longer needed to protect the lottery''.
Brent Walker sent out a plea for the Government to act quickly to
redress the balance, but said any changes were unlikely to be introduced
in time to have any beneficial effect on the second half of the year.
There is again no dividend with the loss per share down to 13.67p from
20.83p.

BUILDING MATERIALS
REDLAND is cutting production of some of its building materials such
as bricks in order to keep up prices and margins. This has already
worked in aggregates where Redland has been able to push through price
rises of more than 10% in stone, sand and gravel, albeit at the expense
of market share.
The action is being taken because of a difficult start to the second
half and uncertainty over volumes in 1996.
There are signs that prices are also starting to soften in Germany,
where Redland is big in roof tiles. Although German sales are expected
to drop in the second half as the housing market slows down, prices are
expected to remain steady.
Redland started the year well but in line with others in the sector,
had a shaky second quarter. Trading conditions have shown no signs of
improving.
In the six months to 30 June, Redland's profitability almost matched
analysts' best expectations at #165m. However, as indicated in March the
interim dividend is down 33%.
The UK operating profit was #26.5m against #19.2m previously, due to
higher margins in aggregates and bricks, partially offset by lower
volumes. Outside the the UK, operating profit rose, benefiting from
recovery in France and further improvement in the performance of the
German operation mostly as a result of the growing strength of the
German mark. In contrast, there were lower profits from the US. Changes
in foreign exchange rates added #9.6m to pre-tax profit.
There was a cash outflow before tax, interest and dividends of #12.1m
compared with a cash inflow of #45.6m for the same period in 1994. The
change was due to #19m increase in capital expenditure to #75m, together
with a seasonal increase of #174m in working capital compared to #107m
in the furst half of last year.
The group's balance sheet remains strong with gearing of 42% against
45%. Interest, including dividends on preferred stock, was 8.6 times
covered by operating profit.
Commenting on the outlook, chief executive Robert Napier said that in
general, UK market conditions were expected to remain difficult,
reflecting the lower level of activity in the construction and housing
markets. ''Management action will continue to improve processes,
including capital expenditure, to reduce costs and protect margins,'' he
added.
Redland shares gained 6p to 370p.

FRENCH BUDGET
Paris, Thursday -- Prime Minister Alain Juppe disclosed a
bigger-than-expected tax revenue shortfall and warned today that France
faced a situation of ''national peril''.
''Thirty to 40 billion French francs have not come into state
coffers'' in 1995, he told a closed-door meeting of mayors, his office
said.
''Revenues are in a calamitous state.''
The shortfall was higher than the Fr25bn announced last week by
Finance Minister Jean Arthuis.
Mr Juppe emphasised, however, that France was determined to meet its
deficit reduction targets in time to join European monetary union.
''Reducing public deficits is a national need to which the Government
will hold fast,'' he said.
He appealed to the mayors to play their part in reducing the deficit
by holding down their borrowing from the state.
''We are in a state of national peril,'' he said. ''I have to achieve
savings.''
The shortfall stemmed from lower-than-expected receipts from
value-added sales tax and company taxes, Mr Juppe said.
While French exports have soared, without increasing tax revenue,
consumer spending has remained sluggish.
France has pledged to cut its public sector deficit, currently around
5% of gross domestic product, to 3% by 1997 to meet the criteria for
economic union.
But financial markets have been dubious that the government can
achieve this goal in light of slowing economic growth.
Meanwhile, French shares closed sharply lower because of a weaker
dollar and a renewed debate over the future of European monetary union.
Much of the trade was technical but a plunge in the price of
index-heavyweight Alcatel Alsthom helped pull the CAC-40 index down by
24.42 points, or 1.35%, at 1767.50.
Alcatel Alsthom fell Fr61.70 to Fr428, a drop of 12.6% in reaction to
unexpected first-half loss and swingeing provisions.
Car shares were boosted by Industry Minister Yves Galland saying he
was planning a new car buying incentive by offering cash to owners of
cars older than eight years when they scrap their vehicles and buy new
ones. There will also be a fiscal incentive for people buying new cars
from savings. -- Reuter

You need to press the right buttons
* IN the continuing fight against car theft, some manufacturers are
fitting keypad immobilisers, which have a display with buttons numbered
zero to nine, writes ROSS FINLAY.
The idea is that, as soon as you switch on, the immobiliser shows a
red light. The engine will not start unless you punch in the pre-set
four-digit number, which will cut out the immobiliser and show you a
green light for go.
Several journalists who recently tried a particular test car agreed
that the gadget seems to work. None of us knew the code number, and we
had to phone the manufacturer before we could make the car galvanise
into action.
The exception was somebody who took it over, with the engine running,
from a delivery driver, ran it for a short distance, parked, switched
off, and noticed the existence of the keypad only when people started
shouting at him to clear the deck of the car ferry on which he was
stuck.
Our approval of the keypad immobiliser faded a little when a more
comprehensive test showed that a professional car thief with the right
equipment could break into the same model of car within 45 seconds, and
take only the same time again to bypass the immobiliser.
However, it still seems likely to put off the casual thief.  That
being the case, I think that having the pad out in plain view in the
central console is a better idea than, as some manufacturers prefer,
hiding it in a pull-down flap.

ROADSHOW
Focusing on the latest Alfa Romeo 155 -- with its lowered and stiffer
suspension, wider track, low-profile tyres and 'very impressive' new
engine
SINCE it includes almost all the serious Italian makes of car
currently on sale, the Fiat Group has been working hard to differentiate
them so that they do not keep colliding in the showrooms. Alfa Romeo is
nominated as the sports-saloon flagship marque.
That being the case, the latest Alfa Romeo 155 comes to the UK only in
Sport specification, which provides lowered and stiffer suspension, a
wider track, low-profile tyres and one very impressive new engine type.
The ''softer'' L-series is for Continental markets only.
Run by the factory itself, last year's Alfa Romeo 155 team won the
British Touring Car Championship. Some modifications to the latest cars
are a throwback to that racing success. You can see the more muscular
look of the Sport versions in their lowered stance and flared wings,
which provide the extra room for the wider track measurements.
Derek Warwick and other drivers have been tackling the 1995 BTCC for
Alfa Romeo in latest-specification cars, although the private team
running the show this year has got nowhere near the factory's own
successes of last season. However, Alfa Romeo, involved in all the most
significant touring car championships, realises that a presence on the
circuits is important in marketing terms.
Pricing of the road cars is highly competitive, especially in
comparison with their obvious German rivals. The entry-level 1.8-litre
155 costs #14,140, the new 16-valve two-litre comes at #15,990, and the
top of the range 2.5-litre V6 is in the showrooms at #17,765.
Pick of the bunch, perhaps, in terms of performance and handling
compared with price, is the new 16-valve two-litre Twin Spark. Its
150bhp power output gives it a 0-60mph time of a whisker over nine
seconds, much stronger mid-range performance and a test track maximum
around 130mph.
Roomier for both passengers and luggage than most of its direct
rivals, in addition to having wider-opening doors, the two-litre runs at
unexpectedly low levels of both mechanical and road noise when settled
into its cruising pace. As a true Alfa Romeo, though, the engine begins
to sing a different tune when soaring towards the red line.
Driving one on some sweeping downland roads, I thought the whole feel
of the car, including its response to both steering and throttle, was
much more sporting, but there is an inevitable price to pay for that.
The ride is now considerably harder.  If that kind of thing upsets you,
of course, you were probably not a natural Alfa Romeo sports-saloon
driver in the first place.

MINI TOUR
BIGGAR is a place ''where museums are a way of life'' -- but it is
also the starting point of a delightful driving tour through the
delicious and much-too-underrated landscapes of upper Tweeddale.
In the pretty town itself, the Gladstone Court old-style street museum
and the Moat Park local heritage centre are open six days a week, plus
Sunday afternoons, till the end of October, while the Greenhill
Covenanters' House, re-erected beside the very attractive Burn Braes
park, is open every afternoon till mid-October. Biggar Gasworks Museum,
about to close for the season, is a nationally preserved industrial
monument.
Heading as for Edinburgh along the spacious High Street, turn right on
the B7016 for Broughton. The jocularly named Biggar Little Theatre is on
the edge of town. There are guided tours of this Victorian puppet
theatre six days a week.
Continue on the B7016, which looks east and south over the narrow
valley floor of the Biggar Water, to rise upon rise of rounded grassy
hills, into the village of Broughton. Turn left on the A7016, beside the
Beechgrove garden, which may be frosted by now, and shortly take the
side-road right for Broughton Gallery.
Housed in what looks like a restored Border tower but is actually a
Basil Spence design of the 1930s, the gallery exhibits paintings,
prints, glassware, ceramics, woodwork, toys and jewellery by modern
Scottish artists. It is open daily, except on Wednesdays, until October
17.
Return to the main road, left into Broughton, pass the B7016 junction
and immediately turn left into Dreva Road. Going over the shoulder of a
hill, this minor road provides more intimate views of the wooded Tweed
valley. Turn right at a give-way sign, then left into Dawyck Botanic
Garden.
Open daily till October 22, Dawyck is an out-station of the Royal
Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. More than 300 years of specialist
tree-planting by the Veitch, Naesmyth and Balfour families have given it
impressive stands of conifers and deciduous trees, birch, beech and
rowan collections, as well as displays of rhododendrons, azaleas and
other flowering shrubs.
There are beautiful woodland walks, and climbing paths following the
course of the Scrape Burn, much more pleasant than its name suggests.
Return to the public road and turn left. Turn right on the A701. On
the left, the John Buchan Centre, open every afternoon until
mid-October, is dedicated to the novelist, biographer and historian who,
as Lord Tweedsmuir, became Governor-General of Canada.
Continue on the A701 then turn left at a signpost for Coulter. Watch
the navigation carefully from now on.  Keep left at another junction as
for Coulter, follow the quiet valley of the Kilbucho Burn, climb to a
side-road right at a grass triangle, following the signposts here, and
at the next junction, for Biggar, which you reach after a total distance
of about 23 miles.

* WHEN invited as a journalist to a new-car launch test, you are
usually issued with a ''road book by the manufacturers, with turn
instructions at the appropriate mileages on the suggested route, writes
ROSS FINLAY. The trouble is, a discrepancy often builds up between the
distance quoted and the mileometer read-out.
One recent example, in which the car I was driving showed 21 miles
from the starting point instead of the official 20, made me realise that
for accurate navigation we rely maybe too much on speedometers and
mileometers. Any quirk in their readings can create big problems.
It is not that the speedometer makers are careless. Their own
specifications may be efficient enough, but adjustments may have to be
made on installation in different variants within any particular model
range, with the possibility of a small errors creeping in.
On the road, my impression is that most speedometers over-read. The
example quoted, of a car showing 21 miles when it has actually covered
only 20, is rather extreme, because it involves a five per cent error.
An over-reading speedometer is actually quite handy for somebody
flirting with the speed limit. Taking my five per cent as a possibility,
however extreme, it is no bad thing from the point of view of lurking
patrol cars to be cruising along a motorway thinking we are doing
73.5mph when we are really doing 70.
But what would a five per cent over-read do to the fuel consumption
calculations some drivers so carefully make? Put them out of kilter, of
course. If your car shows 400 miles from the last brimming of the tank,
and you need ten gallons to top it up again, you think it has been doing
40 mpg. It has actually been doing 38mpg, and your car's economy is not
what you thought.
And how about those manufacturers' finance deals in which your monthly
repayment costs are based on so many thousand miles of use per year?
Many customers pick the figure of 24,000 miles over two years, pay on
that assumption, and accept that there will be a reduced trade-in price
if they exceed that limit.
A friend of mine has just bought a car on that basis. If she exceeds
the limit of 24,000 miles in two years, she will have 8p per ''penalty''
mile taken off the trade-in value.Let's say her mileometer may over-read
by three per cent, or it may over-read by five. At three per cent, she
will actually have done 23,300 miles rather than 24,000, and at five per
cent she will have done only 22,857.
Does that matter? Well, in the worse case she will have done 1143
miles fewer than the reading suggests, which means that she will lose
#91.44 in penalty charges for mileage she never covered.

* READER ''X'' has come up with a puzzle, writes ROSS FINLAY. He
recently bought a new car, having concluded a trade-in deal, and settled
on a date to collect it. When that day arrived, he handed over his
cheque, signed the papers, and noticed only when he got home that the
figures were not the ones he expected.
In round figures, his new car cost #17,500 and there was an allowance
of #10,750 for his trade-in. Though the balance remained the same, both
prices had been reduced by #2000. When he enquired, the salesman told
him: ''It's common practice in the trade.''
Is it? And if so, why?
Mr X cannot figure out who gains by this arrangement, and who loses,
especially as the car he traded in is now in the dealer's forecourt at
#9995, which is less than he was allowed for it but more than the
invoice figure. Is it a VAT dodge, he wonders?
There are many different things to be taken into account here. For a
start, no customer has the faintest idea what the manufacturer really
charges the dealer for any particular car, what with special discounts,
incentive schemes and all the rest of it.
Then, the dealer pays VAT on the profit on a new car sale. If he
over-allows on the trade-in, there may be no profit, even if that seems
a highly original thought. But this is, on paper, an under-allowance.
An accountant who mulled over the situation came to the tentative
conclusion that either (a) it doesn't matter to dealer or customer, or
(b) it offers advantages to both of them. He suggested that, if Mr X is
a self-employed businessman, the lower the price he is offered for his
trade-in the better in tax terms.
Mr X knows that, because in a previous deal he got a higher price for
his car than the one at which it was standing in his books, and had to
pay tax on the swap. But he did not ask for any jiggery-pokery with the
invoice.
What about VAT? Well, Customs and Excise -- which has a specialist car
department -- does not answer theoretical enquiries, but it comes down
hard on anything considered ''tantamount to suppressing VAT''.
However, its attitude would be that, because there is no VAT levied on
the sale of a second-hand car by an individual, and because he is not
contributing in any way to any possible VAT fraud, Mr X need not expect
a midnight knock on the door.
Is there no snag for the private buyer, then? One, certainly. Mr X has
signed a document which reduces the value of his new car by #2000
compared with the manufacturer's list price. If he had happened to write
it off, the day after delivery, and tried to claim the full price as its
replacement value, an insurance company which insisted on seeing all the
relevant paperwork would surely have blown the whistle.
Thinking about all this makes me feel like the Bottle King in the Para
Handy story -- ''my heid's a' reel-rall''. Can anybody explain?

CLASSIC CAR
MANY enthusiasts develop a late affection for some particular car, but
Duncan Laing has a long-standing link with his 1952 Jowett Javelin.
After leaving Aberdeen University, he was the Bradford company's
first-ever graduate apprentice. His stint on the production line, in the
summer of that year, may have involved work on the very car he now owns.
Jowetts were generally regarded, through the years, as being
workmanlike but pretty stodgy. So it was a surprise when, in 1947, the
company produced a highly advanced fastback saloon.
Gerald Palmer, whose reputation attracted the young graduate engineer
to Jowetts in the first place, designed the Javelin with a compact
flat-four aluminium block engine, far more modern suspension than its
rivals, and a roomy body which owed something to the Lincoln Zephyr and
the Lancia Aprilia.
Part of Duncan Laing's work with Jowetts was test-driving at the newly
opened MIRA proving ground. Altogether, when he bought his present
Javelin in 1990, it was a model he knew plenty about.
He acquired a second Javelin as a source of replacement parts, and
rebuilt its engine, with high-compression pistons, to put into the
running example. The Javelin's under-bonnet area is an eye-opener for
accessibility, because the engine is ahead of the radiator, and the
grille lifts off.
Javelins handle well despite their body roll, reach 60mph in about 22
seconds, and cruise easily some way above that. But the transmission is
a problem, with a ''crash'' first gear and a steering column change.
Duncan Laing's car turns out for a dozen competitive events every
year, and was the winner of the Classic Challenge at Forres earlier this
month. Established more than 70 years ago, the Jowett Car Club is the
oldest one-make club in Britain.  Gerald Palmer, now in his eighties, is
a much-revered figure at its gatherings.  He had left Jowetts by the
time Duncan Laing arrived, but when they finally met up at a club rally,
Duncan was able to say: ''I've been trying to speak to you for
forty-something years.''

IT must have been galling indeed for Guinness that on a day when it
produced half-time results in line with most forecasts and saw its
shares ease, those of arch-competitors Grand Metropolitan and Allied
Domecq saw some of the biggest one-day rises for many a day.
GrandMet, 20[1/2]p to 447p, was set alight by rumours that an
international company was about to bid on a break-up basis -- vehemently
denied by Guinness' Tony Greener that he was interested. That would be
an easy process as the group is so compartmentalised with IDV a most
saleable property.
The other thought is that Burger King is up for sale and there has
been persistent talk that it has been sweetened up by the removal of
layers of middle management and not to say fattening profits by allowing
franchisees to pay employees effectively only piece work.
Allied, 15[1/2]p better at 536p, benefited from chatter that Goldman
Sachs has been appointed to sell off the Carlsberg Tetley subsidiary
which is demonstrably no longer a core activity.
So while there is excitement in those two stocks, Guinness stands on
the sidelines with future profitablity to be enhanced only through
improving the product mix and hoping that price increases can be pushed
through -- difficult in the mature Anglo-Saxon dominated markets which
are generally in a state of economic uncertainty with the feel good
factor absent in most.
One cloud is the 20% holding in the hands of LVMH which chairman
Bernard Arnoult may put on the market at any time without consulting
Guinness. There seems to be no good reason why he should maintain the
stake as the strategic reasons of mutual self-defence against predators
have now changed.
So it seems probable that Guinness will be the back marker in the
spirits sector unless there is evidence that October and November do see
a major upsurge in international sales.
Vision on
VISION group sees a future in which it will be a very large company
indeed. That will be achieved chiefly through the success of its video
conferencing camera where sales of desk-top videos which are currently
running at an annual rate of 200,000 a year are expected to rise to one
million in 1996 and 10 million the year after.
The Edinburgh based company, whose gestation was attributable in part
to Edinburgh University, has designed and developed a single silicon
chip which uniquely is able to both sense and process an image. It
should be able to announce in three or four months time that it will be
able to begin commercial production of a colour camera.
That is the open sesame to a possible fortune.
The pressure will be in the market place to produce a camera as
economically as possible with systems analysts in the US suggesting that
they could be as cheap as $50 by the end of the decade. That presents an
enormous opportunty to have one in most homes as well as for commercial
use.
And Vision, as far as it knows, is at least a generation ahead of
rivals whoh have no commercial products on the market even in monochrome
to compete in ether image quality or price.
Vision has already signed up a major US supermarket group for customer
counting records and will be producinga camera for under $10 for a toy
manufacturer.
Another string is a PC camera which will record images on the screen
for record purposes with production of 100 million PCs forecast by 2000.
The year to July saw sales rise 50% to #1.73m with the expected #1.5m
loss. Turnover will increase by a similar proportion in the current six
months and then take off to #6500m for a full year total.
Tellingly, Vision is happy with brokers Albert E Sharp's forecast of
an astounding #22m in 1997 which should bring the group into profit at
#3m. Thanks to the flotation at 97p in April and an earlier placing,
cash is no problem.
Free for all
THE free market in the distribution of electricity in the UK has
become a free for all. This has not escaped the attentions of the
American utilities who are keen not surprisingly to jump aboard the UK
gravy train. Increased competition and regulation in the US markets is
prompting these companies to look overseas.
While competition is expected to gradually increase in the electricity
distribution market in the years ahead, the regulatory environment is
and has been lagging behind. The blatant feathering of nests that has
gone on within the regional electricity companies has prompted concern
even among supporters of privatisation.
The latest gravy train that is about to pull out of the sidings is
National Grid which was originally sold to the 12 regional electricity
companies of England and Wales for #1000m in 1990, when they were
privatised.
Surprise, surprise it now appears that the National Grid was grossly
undervalued and is now worth closer to #5000m. Serious behind the scenes
arm twisting has led the National Grid to offer consumers a #50 rebate
on their electricity bills on flotation.
Meanwhile, the National Grid, chairman David Jefferies, stands to make
#190,000 when the flotation takes place with three of his fellow
directors sharing #125,000 between them.
Against this background there is some merit in the Labour Party's
arguments for more accountable regulators, if the voice of the consumer
is to be heard among the din of deal-making. However, it is debatable
whether the appointment of yet more advisory boards to assist the
regulators, is the way to go about it.
In a free market, companies of all kinds have to be able to make
profits and thereby help to generate wealth for the whole nation.
However, the privatised utilities, and for that matter British Rail,
have social obligations which should be honoured and enshrined within
their regulatory framework.

maintenance continued, and gas output was down on the same month of last
year because of the unusually hot summer.
However, Royal Bank of Scotland's energy economist, Mark Shea,
believes the underlying picture is healthy.
Oil production fell by 2.4% to 2.48 million barrels per day during
August but was 1.4% higher than a year earlier. And average daily oil
revenues from the North Sea were marginally up on July at #25.4m because
of a rise in Brent crude prices.
The pick-up in prices, combined with the strengthening of the dollar
against the pound, resulted in a 3.3% increase in the average sterling
Brent crude price during August.
A need in the US to replenish historically low stocks and the threat
of hurricane damage to Caribbean refineries combined to push Brent
through the $17 mark for the first time in nearly three months.
Last week, however, profit-taking by investment funds, and an
earlier-than-anticipated re-opening of the St Croix refinery in the
Virgin Islands after the hurricane danger passed, saw crude prices cut
by more than $1 in four days to $16.18. However, North Sea Brent crude
closed firmer last night at $16.38.
However, Mr Shea believes current prices, although not high by
historical standards, are strong enough to make North Sea investment
attractive.
He said: ''As far as the North Sea producers are concerned, most
companies still have very buoyant development plans.
''They are very keen on the North Sea, with a lot of projects coming
through.''
Oil production during the first eight months of this year was up about
3.5% on the same period of last year. This output growth is slightly
below expectations.
Gas production continued to fall, with lower demand for heating during
the warm weather.
It dropped 4.6% during August to yet another new low for this year of
3775 million cubic feet per day. Gas output was also down 3.5% on a year
earlier, with 16 of the North Sea's 68 gas-producing fields completely
idle.
Combined North Sea oil and gas output fell 2.9% during August to 3.14
million barrels of oil equivalent per day -- a drop of nearly 100,000
boepd.
Total output during August, the second poorest month so far this year,
was marginally higher than a year earlier.
Although more volatile in recent weeks, oil prices are better than
last year. The average Brent crude price so far this year has been
$17.10, 7.5% higher than the $15.90 average during the same period of
last year.
The Arab-dominated Opec cartel continues to cast a shadow over the oil
price.
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Abdul Mohsen Medej Al-Medej has said his country
will request a 200,000 bpd quota increase at November's Opec meeting, a
rise of 10%.

ELECTRONICS
SHARES in Prestwick Holdings yesterday slumped 7p to 44p, even though
the printed circuit board manufacturer announced a #2.8m turnaround
which took it back into the black in the year to end-July.
Prestwick's share price has, however, surged in recent weeks from
about 35p and outgoing executive chairman Archie Coulson's results
statement seems to have been aimed at dampening over-enthusiastic
projections which the company blames on ''overly-bullish articles in the
press''.
Referring to the Ayr-based company's #7m investment programme, which
will increase the workforce by 70 to about 650, Mr Coulson said the
installation of new plant and the induction and training of new people
had been disruptive and had contributed to a disappointing start to the
current financial year.
With the strength of its sector resulting in longer lead-times for the
production equipment Prestwick is looking to purchase, the company
believes the benefits of its investment programme may not feed through
until the second half of its accounting period.
However, finance director Morgan Hogarth, pointing out that the order
book extends beyond Christmas, said the market for Prestwick's products
was the strongest it had ever been.
The company supplies the automotive sector with printed circuit boards
controlling everything from audio equipment to airbags. Its products
also have applications in telecommunications and multi-media.
Prestwick made pre-tax profits of #1.53m during the 12 months to July,
after a #1.25m loss the previous year. Turnover from continuing
operations rose from #31.9m to #33.3m.
Stripping out the impact of exceptionals, profits rose from #112,000
to #1.61m.
As anticipated, Prestwick, which has operations at Ayr and Irvine,
will clear its entire preference dividend arrears of #535,000 on
November 17.
The company aims for a return to the Ordinary dividend list in its
current financial year.
Mr Coulson, appointed to Prestwick by London-based corporate recovery
group POSTERN last year, will hand over his executive responsibilities
to Patrick Moore, 51, managing director of TT Group subsidiary Welwyn
Components, on November 1.
He will continue as non-executive chairman until Prestwick's annual
meeting on December 1, when he will be succeeded by former Royal Bank of
Scotland finance director Kenneth Thompson.
Meanwhile, operations director Alan Matheson, who has been with the
company for four years, is leaving for General Electric early next year.

ECONOMY
THE Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of
England meet today for the first time since Eddie George dropped his
insistence on the need for a rise in interest rates to combat
inflationary pressures.
Rates are expected to be left unchanged after the monthly monetary
meeting, but a growing number of City analysts now believe that the next
change in interest rates will be downwards.
They are not yet in a majority, however, and earlier this week Mervyn
King, the Bank's chief economist, warned Kenneth Clarke not to give into
pressure to lower rates in response to the slowdown in economic
activity.
The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street believes that the economy is
merely pausing for breath and that activity will pick up again.
A Reuter poll of 34 City pundits found that two-thirds still thought
the next movement in rates would be upwards.
Of the 12 who took the contrary view half thought that rates would be
cut before the end of this year, with the rest predicting a drop early
next year.
Speculation that the Chancellor would like to engineer a cut in rates
to derail next week's Labour Party conference or cheer up the
Conservative conference the following week seems to ignore the growing
pressures on him to follow a responsible monetary policy.
Mr Clarke has the final say on rates, but the timing of any change is
decided by Mr George. Recent practice has been to implement rate
decisions immediately after the meeting at which they are decided.
Sterling has suffered from speculation that rates might be cut
prematurely, and the equity and gilts market were upset on Wednesday by
fears that the authorities faced increased financing difficulties
because of the shortfall in Exchequer revenues.
This has resulted in the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement being
higher than the Treasury forecast.

LOWER national newspaper revenue and sharply higher paper costs took
their toll on United News &amp; Media in the six months to June 30, the
company reported yesterday.
Pre-tax profits at the Daily and Sunday Express owner and local
newspaper group slipped to #65.1m from #69.9m in the corresponding
period last year.
''National newspapers were affected by lower circulation revenues in a
highly competitive market,'' said chairman Lord Stevens.
The cost of paper had increased by 10% in the period, adding #4m to
the raw materials bill, he added.
The group, which also includes the Daily Star and regional papers like
the Yorkshire Post, did not increase cover prices in the first half of
the year but has done so since.
Circulation revenue from the nationals was 8% down, reflecting the
impact of a price war in Scotland which cost #2m. Lord Stevens said the
rate of decline in circulation had now slowed.
Managing director Graham Wilson said the flagship Express paper had
suffered a 5% fall in sales compared with last year, but the situation
had now improved ''markedly''.
In local papers, circulations had been flat in a market that had been
steadily losing around 1% annually, although there were bright spots in
some parts of the country -- like Sheffield.
On the advertising side, regional papers had scored an 8% increase and
the nationals had been 3% better, said the company.
Yesterday's interim figures were dented by #2.9m exceptional losses,
principally from the disposal of consumer magazines and redundancies.
United has been beefing up its exhibitions and trade shows side and
expanded such operations with the acquisition of Walter Fletcher in the
US.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 7.75p on earnings per share down
to 17.2p from 19.1p.

LADIESWEAR group Jacques Vert expects a poorer performance in the
first half of the current financial year because of difficult market
conditions. The prolonged hot summer led to both extended discounting of
spring/summer merchandise by many retailers and a delay to the start of
the autumn/winter selling season. However, speaking at the annual
meeting, chairman Alan Green said that he expected Jacques Vert's
principal labels to make good progress as orders for the 1996
spring/summer season started coming in.

INCREASED numbers of tourists particularly during the Edinburgh
Festival was good news for the Waverley Shopping Centre.
Speciality Shops, the niche property company that runs the centre,
among others, expects its rental income from Waverley to rise given that
about 39% of the rent receivable from eight large units is under review.
New lettings in excess of #70 per square foot have been achieved
compared with a previous level of #64 per square foot. However, the
increased rents are still well below the #160 per square foot achieved
on Princes Street.
Speciality Shops remains on the lookout for management contracts from
institutional investors and sensibly priced shopping centre
acquisitions.

COFFEE consumption in the UK fell by an estimated 4% to 5% in the year
to August. The slump in consumption follows higher prices, after two
frosts and a drought destroyed much of the Brazilian coffee crop, and a
summer heatwave. Figures from the International Coffee Organisation
estimate that 2.46 million bags were drunk in the year to March 1995
against 2.66 million in the same period of 1994. Britons on average
drink three cups of coffee a day compared to four of tea.

Regional electricity company's shares soar on renewed bid frenzy.
THE battle for control of Norweb, the regional electricity company
covering North West England, including Manchester and the Lake District,
hotted up yesterday with American utility companies putting in their
long-awaited bid, recommended by Norweb, only to be met with an
increased offer from the original hostile bidder, North West Water.
City analysts believe that the Americans will themselves come back
with a higher offer in the near future. In the meantime Norweb's board
has advised its shareholders to take no action.
Under its revised offer, North West Water is offering 1834p cash and
two new North West Water shares for every three Norweb shares.
Shareholders will also be entitled to a 100p special dividend.
The revised offer values each Norweb share at about 1104p and the
issued share capital of the company at about #1720m. There is a full
revised cash alternative of 975p per Norweb share which, together with
the 100p Special Dividend values each Norweb share at 1075p.
North West Water's directors still believe that the Norweb acquisition
will be earnings enhancing and that the enlarged group's interest cover
and gearing will remain prudent. North West Water currently has a 10%
stake in Norweb.
Houston Industries Energy and Central &amp; South West International (CSW)
have teamed up together to made a recommended offer for Norweb via a
joint venture vehicle called Texas Energy Partners.
HI Energy is the international electricity arm of Houston, a Texan
electricity generator, transmitter and distributor.
CSW is a public utility company which owns four electric operating
subsidiaries in the US. CSW International is actively engaged in the
pursuit of electricity industry investments outside the US.
The offer from Texas Energy Partners values each Norweb share 1050p,
comprising 850p in cash and a special dividend of 200p net. The offer,
which values Norweb at about #1700m (inclusive of the special dividend),
allows certain shareholders to reclaim the tax credit relating to the
Special Dividend of 200p (net) per Norweb share, implying a total gross
value for such shareholders of 1100p per Norweb share, and values Norweb
at 11 times earnings for the year ended March 31, 1995, exclusive of the
tax credit relating to the special dividend.
Norweb said it had agreed to the bid, not only because it beat North
West Water's, but because it was sure that under US ownership its
business would be enhanced, with a focus on customer service and value.
In addition, it said Houston and CSW will be able to assist Norweb in
the development of related businesses, such as international power
generation and gas supply.
Norweb's shares responded to the renewed bid frenzy by soaring
117[1/2]p to 1083p and dragged other REC shares higher. Prior to the
agreed bid Norweb's shares had been lagging the original cash offer from
North West Water on fears that the government would call for a
Monopolies and Mergers inquiry.
Meanwhile, North West Water shares dropped 21p to 584p.
* POWERGEN has raised its stake in Midlands from 15% to 20% following
the purchase of just under 8.6 million shares at 990p each.
PowerGen has made an agreed offer for Midland priced at 800p cash with
a 200p special dividend per share.

MEDIA
SCOTTISH Television's new partner, Flextech, announced yesterday that
it is selling its interests in cable television, but failed to say what
it would do with the proceeds, which are likely to be around #60m,
writes ROBERT POWELL.
The money could be used to help Scottish mount a bid for the Welsh
television station HTV -- a possibility which has been much discussed in
recent weeks -- but City analysts said Flextech had given no hint of its
plans.
''I'm not quite sure what's on their agenda,'' said Andrew Walsh, a
media analyst with Natwest Markets in London.
The Flextech announcement came as Scottish Television shareholders
gave their blessing to a strategic alliance with the US-owned
programme-making company at an extraordinary general meeting in Glasgow.
Flextech will acquire a 20% stake in Scottish Television for #64m and
transfer its existing 20% stake the Welsh television station HTV to
Scottish.
In addition, Flextech and several of its associate cable and satellite
television companies will buy at least #8.3m of new programmes and
library material from Scottish over the next three years.
The strategic alliance will enable Scottish to make more money from
programme-making as revenues from advertising decline over the next few
years due to competition from cable and satellite broadcasters and a
planned fifth terrestrial channel.
''Scottish Television can now participate in the broadcasting
revolution which, driven by technological advance, is now under way, not
only here in Britain, but also throughout the world,'' company chairman
William Brown said.
Neither Mr Brown nor Scottish Television chief executive Gus MacDonald
would comment on Flextech's planned sale of interests in five cable
television companies which reach about 260,000 homes in the UK.
But City analysts said the move had been expected.
Tele-Communications International (TCI), the US media giant which owns
49% of Flextech, made clear several months ago that it wanted to turn
Flextech into a purely programme-making company.
The link-up with Scottish will enable Flextech to produce more
programmes for use on TCI satellite and cable channels in Europe and
North America.
TCI is meanwhile concentrating its UK cable television interests in
Telewest -- Britain's largest cable operator -- of which it owns 38%.
But an original plan to sell Flextech's cable assets to Telewest
appears to have fallen through and Flextech is talking to other
potential buyers.
Flextech said: ''the company confirms that it is in discussions which
may lead to the disposal of its cable television interests,'' but
officials were not available for further comment.
Telewest also appears set to expand. The company launched a $900m junk
bond in New York on Wednesday.

DRINKS
DRINKS giant Guinness has found it hard going in the UK spirits market
with Bell's seeing a slight fall in volume although holding overall
share at 18[1/2]% in the premium sector of the Scotch market as
consumers increasingly switch to supermarket own brands.
The UK experience is generally reflected world-wide with overall
volumes just 1% ahead as are prices. There are substantial variations in
prices in different parts of the world. Latin America and Asia have
raised volumes while the more mature markets are less encouraging.
That helped depress sentiment towards the shares yesterday and despite
pre-tax profits rising 6% to a much in line with expectations #340m, the
shares fell back 7[1/2]p to 508[1/2]p.
Profits from the UK eased 8% to #44m while those in North America were
down by 13% to #94m.
The group's United Distillers subsidiary is making a #25m
rationalisation charge against some of its international operations.
That came as something of a surprise for the second-half figures
although chairman Tony Greener said the reorganisation of United's
operations in Scotland is complete after the spending of more than #100m
on improving efficencies.
However, United has further increased ownership of international
distribution to further boost operating margins.
Distilling volumes were down, particularly grain spirits, due to the
closure of Port Dundas for a period for upgrading. However, he took
encouragement from the gradual improvement in the overall Scotch stocks
position.
Mr Greener said Gordon's Gin had fallen back in the UK market but
should benefit from a major promotional effort now taking place and
would display the product as a white spirit rather than as merely a
player in the gin market and so appeal more to the younger drinker.
Sales in the rest of Europe had been distorted by parallel imports
from Spain and Italy into the harder currency countries such as France
and Germany and so United has raised prices in those two Mediterranean
countries.
The US saw some growth for Dewars but further south, both Mexico and
Venezuela suffered from economic problems and a greater consumption of
locally produced sprits.
Japan continued to be a disappointment in volume terms, down about 5%
although the strengthening yen limited the damage.
However, about #12m of the #20m rise in pre-tax profits came from the
one-third owned Moet Hennessey champagne and cognac associate. That left
the overall Guinness directed operations pretty flat.
While there were good performances in some of the brewing divisions,
Cruzcampo in Spain continues to drag even if there had been a slight
rise in both volume and market share.
Guinness performed well in its British Isles markets thanks to greater
promotion. Asia is proving an excellent area with Hong Kong and
Indonesia outstanding while the Irish pub concept is becoming accepted
ever more widely internationally.
The overall promotional spend for Johnnie Walker continues to increase
as part of the strategic decision to concentrate on the major brands
with the brand in its various forms raising volume by 8%.
The interim dividend has been raised 8% to 4.2p but the City is still
waiting for news as to how Guinness will distribute surplus cash back to
shareholders with the business strongly cash positive.
While it would dearly love to increase its stake in Moet Hennessey,
majority shareholder LVMH would be very reluctant to sell one of the
jewels in the French export crown.
Brokers Panmure Gordon are looking for full-year profits up from #915m
to #970m before deducting the #25m United Distillers provision but
reckon the stock only a hold in a dull sector.
The dividend total seems likely to rise to at least 15p for a 3.7%
yield.

LIFE ASSURANCE
PERTH-based composite insurance group General Accident is to acquire
Provident Mutual Life Assurance which has about 500,000 policyholders in
a deal worth #170m thereby fulfilling its long-cherished wish to
build-up its pension interests.
It was revealed last week that talks were taking place with Provident
Mutual, about 80% of whose business is in pensions, mostly unit linked
which would make a good fit with General Accident's strengths in
with-profit products.
''With-profit'' policyholders with Provident Mutual will receive
special bonuses (#25m in total) to be declared over the next three
years. The deal, which involves General Accident taking a 10% interest
in the Provident Mutual sub-fund, could trigger off other such moves in
an industry where competitive pressures are extremely intense.
Provident Mutual admitted that while its financial position is stable,
it is unable to transact new business on profitable terms in current
market conditions. Moreover, the Provident Mutual Board does not expect
an improvement in the immediate future because of the intensification of
these competitive pressures and regulatory changes in the UK life
market.
General Accident is raising approximately #134.9m through an issue of
22.66m new shares, which are being placed with institutional investors
at a price of 600p. This compares with yesterday's price of 613p, down
9p.
The net proceeds of the placing will be used to finance part of the
#170m cash which is being transferred into the Provident Mutual
sub-fund. It consists of #145m for the embedded value and an additional
#25m which is intended to finance the special bonus for with-profits
policyholders. The balance will be provided from General Accident's own
resources.
Following the agreement -- which is subject to various approvals
including by Provident Mutual's voting members at an Extraordinary
General Meeting on November 15 and by the courts -- General Accident
will have a 10% interest in the future profits of Provident Mutual's
unit-linked and non-profit businesses.
The existing business and policies of Provident Mutual will be
transferred to General Accident Linked Life, a wholly owned subsidiary
of General Accident. Provident Mutual's long-term business fund will
become a separate sub-fund of General Accident Linked Life to be known
as the Provident Mutual Fund.
It will be closed to new clients except for incremental business from
existing policyholders. Over the next five years there will be no
increase in discretionary expense charges to policyholders in respect of
unit-linked policies, save for indexation where applicable.
Among other benfits, Provident Mutual policyholders will have enhanced
security as a result of the capital contribution and through being part
of a major international insurance group with extensive financial
resources.
General Accident should see enhanced earnings per share in 1996
excluding the one-off costs of the inevitable rationalisation. There
will be opportunities for ''significant'' cost savings as the benefits
of integration and scale are realised. There will also be the immediate
benefit of a sizeable pensions presence with proven selling expertise to
the Independent Financial Adviser market.
It is intended that General Accident will concentrate its own pensions
business around Provident Mutual's well-regarded pensions operations at
Stevenage.
Following completion of the deal, Provident Mutual's chief executive
Brian Richardson will become a director and deputy general manager of
General Accident Life Assurance and General Accident Linked Life. Lord
Farnham, chairman of Provident Mutual, will become a non-executive
director of General Accident Life and General Accident Linked Life.
* STANDARD Life group managing director Scott Bell, speaking yesterday
to the 1995 Chartered Insurance annual conference in Cardiff, said that
in the best companies, actions will be driven by actual customer
requirements ''and not by a self-defeating pursuit of increased market
share for its own sake. Real success will only be achieved through real
customer satisfaction.''

WHAT is it about some voices, some accents, some vocal presences which
irritate, and others soothe. Thirty years ago I recollect wee Cliff
Hanley getting stick from all of the British islands except the
archipelago on which he maintained himself, for his accent. It was felt
that his Scottish accent was unacceptable. The protest came,
incidentally, from Scotland in the main. The Scottish bourgeoisie were
more used to the rarefied tones of a collection of broadcasting
presenters who were either women from Scottish recusant backgrounds or
baldy men in Guards' ties who were wont to enter the parade grounds of a
night and of a public lavvy.
Cliff was that wee he would have to be helped up the front step of a
public toilet, and he never went to a girls' private school except in
his dreams. But 30 years ago he got rubbished something rotten for his
accent. It was said he was the very epitome of the Glasgow guttersnipe.
Cliff was that unusual phenomenon: a senior secondary guttersnipe.
Later the broadcasting world was attacked once more when a splendid
voice sped across the airwaves. It belonged to the best voice ever, a
lassie at that. Her name was, and remains, Susan Rae. She was informed
by the South-English that her accent was rough and coarse and could not
be understood by metropolitans who frequently found themselves unable to
pronounce a perfectly sensible ''R'' unless it was Lawr and Order, or
Drawring, or Idear.
I have an idear for these people. That is that Scottish accents have
done horribly well in the past decade or so, as have Irish, including
those from the Black North, and regional accents everywhere.
Wilfred Pickles was much congratulated, or at least the BBC was,
during the Second World War, for his regional accent when reading the
news. In fact, Pickles himself complained that he was frequently forced
to take some kind of absurd elocution lessons to blunt his Northern
vowels. But let me tell you about Susan Rae. She had and has the most
mellifluous and sincere accent which ever stemmed from an Ayrshire town
and it is plain and straight and I love her, just for the accent.
Today we have many a regional, and indeed Scottish, voice thrilling
you through the wireless grille. True, Tom Morton on Radio Scotland
sounds as if he has recently been sick in the pub toilet but has now
recovered and is embarking on his seventh pint regardless. On the other
hand he also sounds sensible and makes me laugh rather pointlessly.
Ruth Wishart, who follows him, has a voice I have described before as
emanating from somebody whose teeth appear to be situated somewhere in
the middle of her forehead. At least they have voices which are
distinctive.
But what is it that irritates you about an accent? English accents
from the South actually anger you, but not from Somerset, or Cornwall,
or Dorset. Most Irish accents are acceptable (though try a year working
in Dublin and the jakeens' perpetual whine would have you setting SAS
volunteers upon them).
North Welsh makes you want to have them speaking in their own tongue
instead of being orotund in English, and it is true that many a Scottish
area would be the better for silence. The accent I loathe the most is
that rather transatlantic Clarkston accent enjoyed by ex-school captains
of Hutchie Grammar. One of my colleagues, an extraordinarily pleasant
girl, has such an accent which I don't notice when I meet her, but when
I hear her on the radio I want to feed her Temazepam just so that she
can get a life, as I believe the phrase is. I've been listening to the
girl so long I now even come out with phrases such as ''As I believe the
phrase . . .''. You get that way with such a voice in your ear.
But was I not insulted in a Saturday newspaper the other day by a girl
with one of the nicest voices you ever heard? Kirsty Young, she of the
blonde hair and the unsuitable boyfriends, and star of telly, has the
duskiest voice since Lauren Bacall. I profiled her at the start of her
meteoric career and all because of her wonderful voice and an accent
which is Scottish and universal and makes you want to go out and buy
chocolate creams. In 1953 when were Kirsty, I mean young.
She has no business insulting me. For those who purchased the Saturday
Express and who saw the photograph of some aged lizard from Coronation
Street, all I can say is that I never went out with Betty Turpin or any
other rutabaga such as she. I usually step oot with lovely girls who
look like Kirsty. And my voice? My voice sounds as though I swallowed a
cheese grater. And a decent dictionary. Miss Young, take note.

FORGET Paris? I sometimes think I should. Life gets shorter and the
Earth, in my imagination, grows ever more like a geographical pudding
which I long to consume in greedy gulps. So many places to visit, so
many places to re-visit, on limited time. Should I really allow myself
the luxury of another trip to Paris -- the 23rd or thereabouts?
But show me a ticket to Orly and I'm anybody's. I'm Air UK's, who
supplied the flight, and I'm Le Baltimore's, the classy ''boutique''
hotel which gave me B&amp;B and a beanfeast at Bertie's, its best-of-British
restaurant. (Whatever next -- a degustation at the McDonald's on
boulevard St Michel?) All the same, I like to think I'm never more my
own woman than when I'm back in Paris.
Eighteen years younger and still freewheeling, still toying with the
open ends of life's possibilities. It was this time of year, September,
when I first parked my Mini on the pavement of rue Lechapelais and
hauled my luggage up the wooden stairs to two tiny rooms on the third
floor. There I stayed for almost a year, and every year since. When the
chestnut leaves begin to crisp and the light deepens, some retroactive
internal mechanism gives a little click and makes me ache quietly for
Paris.
Much has happened since then to the French capital, and much has
stayed the same. I won't rehearse its imperishable platitudes -- even if
you've never been there you know what they are -- but every time I go
back the triumphant advance of the city's self-belief takes my breath
away.
Whatever the vicissitudes of France -- nuclear gaffes, world
opprobrium, terrorist bombs, high unemployment -- Paris refuses to take
its eye off the target in its civic sights. This is the burg which aims
to become -- and I quote -- ''the first city of Europe''. Privately it
got there long ago, or believes it did; publicly the evidence and
execution of its ambition becomes more and more awesome.
I've never seen it look more magnificent and, to the superficial eye,
less diminished by adversity. Its monumental buildings are scoured and
gleaming, its gardens are spruce, its streets are patrolled by vigilant
mobile scaffies. Even the dog pooh is under control, and an imaginative
engineer has installed public telephones in some of the old cylindrical
advertising stands.
The cars have been swept from the pavements of the Champs Elysees and
buried in underground parks; the riverside walk from pont d'Alma to pont
d'Iena has been handsomely re-landscaped; the Louvre, in its
philosophical state of perpetual revolution and material condition of
perpetual restoration, proceeds confidently towards its declared goal,
which is merely to be the best museum in the world.
''Am I right?'' I ask Martine Roux, Paris-based Anglophile, sister of
the masterchefs Roux and the woman who persuaded Albert Roux to
introduce the 16th to bubble and squeak and bread-and-butter pudding.
''Is this a well-run city, or is it all mere window dressing by the best
in the business?''
It is, she agreed, a well-run city; in terms of modern problems of
urban infrastructure only the hard nut of traffic congestion and
pollution remains to be cracked -- and they're working on it, with talk
of free public transport. She adds wrly, ''But well-run cities are
expensive cities. It costs us a lot in local taxes to keep Paris
beautiful.''
There are, of course, two cities -- Paris-Ville and Paris-Banlieue --
and there are few metropolises whose suburbs are so precisely kept at
bay by their road system. There are many respectable, indeed many plush,
districts outside the boulevard peripherique but increasingly the city's
ring road feels like a cordon sanitaire, a bumper-to-bumper buffer zone
between the city of light and the outer darkness.
Inside is the Paris of civilised values, good living, intellectual
refinement, and cultural enthusiasm (the locals queued for months to see
the Louvre's Richelieu pavilion when it opened last year). Outside are
the great northern housing estates of the North African ghettoes,
breeding grounds of disaffection and alienation. In the high-rises of
these neglected purlieus young French Muslims turn their satellite
dishes towards Algeria and re-think their loyalties.
The protective properties of the cordon sanitaire are illusory.
Paris-Ville may look magnificent and seem serene but it's rattled. The
summer spate of bombings killed seven people and injured over 130 in
Paris and Lyons, and the high visibility of police and paramilitaries is
as much a reminder as a reassurance. ''People say they use the Metro
just the same, but it's not true,'' says Bertie's eloquent maitre d'.
''They're using their cars. It takes 20 minutes longer to get to work in
the morning.''
The hotels are busy because it's trade-fair season, but the museums
and galleries are curiously quiet. No school children. The Mayor of
Paris, Jean Tiberi -- energetically pro-active like his predecessor the
President -- has slung his own cordon sanitaire round the city's
schools. Police patrol their boundaries, teachers must wear ID badges,
all ''pedagogic excursions'' have been cancelled, and special buses are
provided for groups travelling to sports centres. This time last year
the young athletes took the Metro.
For all that, it's hard to believe that Parisians haven't adjusted to
their new level of anxiety. A milky sun is shining and the statutory
student lovers are sitting on benches in the Luxembourg gardens. Are
they placed there, for a fee, by the city tourist authorities? Near the
Trocadero I watch teenagers charge, laughing, from a lycee and head for
the great forecourt of the Palais de Chaillot to perform acrobatics on
roller-skates.
There's nothing else for it. To find out how Paris really sees its
future I must go underground. Literally: into the sewers beneath the
quai d'Orsay, beside the rushing waters of the loos and drains of rue
Cognacq-Jay for the olfactory experience of the splendid Musee des
Egouts de Paris.
Here, on the job as it were, I explore the history of Parisian
sanitation and receive a visionary prediction for the 21st century. ''In
Paris, the first city of Europe, all water entering the Seine will be
treated. Salmon and trout will abound. Nature will come back into her
own.''
Tell that to the islanders of French Polynesia.

THIRTY months from now you will be able to buy your domestic
electricity from whichever supplier you choose. The power will still
come into your home by the same mains cable. The current will remain as
mysteriously invisible as ever, detectable only when the lights come on,
the washing machine starts to swirl, or, painfully, when you touch that
wire and discover you hadn't switched off at the control box after all.
But you will, from April 1998, be able to shop around for the supplier
who offers you those elusive kilowatt-hours at the keenest available
price. The electricity companies will have to compete for your custom.
If you choose to buy from AnonoRec -- or some such unbeguiling
anagrammatic entity -- at the other end of Britain, it will buy the
power from AnonoGen and pay others, including your spurned local
supplier, to pump the juice along the wires and through your meter.
AnonoRec will then bill you and still hope to show a profit from the
deal. Hallelujah! There will be a mass market in one of modern life's
most fundamental necessities.
That, at least, was the theory when the Government privatised the UK
electricity sector at the end of the 1980s. It was to be the crowning
achievement of the Thatcher drive to make government small and market
mechanisms the only credible arbiter of supply and demand.
For monopoly read market. For cosy, complacent public utilities read
competitive commercial enterprises. From the ashes of stuffy old state
boards would spring a vibrant new private power industry.
The taxpayer -- or rather the Treasury -- would be happy, having
raised billions from the sale. The new army of shareholders would be
happy because -- although shares can go down as well as up -- these
ones, like every other privatisation issue, would be priced on the
''give us a pound and we'll give you back two'' principle.
Customers would be happy too. In the longer term they could shop
around for supplies. But the Government would also ensure that, thanks
to a bearded-professor-turned-regulator, future price increases would be
firmly pegged below the rate of inflation.
Five years on, before domestic customers anywhere can phone up
AnonoRec for a competitive quote, that cheery, everybody-wins picture
has been shaken to bits by a daily kaleidoscope of corporate bids and
deals which suggest that, when the domestic electricity market is
finally deregulated in 1998, there will be a lot fewer competitive
choices around than was intended at the outset.
Hanson has bought Eastern. Southern (of the US) has bought South
Western. ScottishPower wants to buy Manweb. Midland wants to be bought
by PowerGen. Norweb prefers the embrace of two more American utilities
to being bought by North West Water.
The list will, doubtless, lengthen. And, while only two of this first
clutch of bids will actually reduce competitive choice for customers,
every analyst in the sector is predicting further radical
rationalisation and significantly fewer players by the end of the
century, unless Board of Trade President Ian Lang decides enough is
enough and starts blocking deals.
But, having waved through ScottishPower's bid for Manweb, can he
credibly refer PowerGen's agreed offer for Midland to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission on the grounds that it erodes the market division
(south of the Border) between those who generate electricity and those
who distribute it?
That principle has already suffered erosion, both from the
participation of a number of regional supply companies in new gas-fired
power station projects and from the regulator's determination to force
both the English generators, PowerGen and National Power, to flog off a
significant slice of their existing capacity, probably to the local
RECs.
If it is to be open season, the most striking feature of the current
list of deals is that none of the English RECs is doing any of the
buying. All are on the receiving end of bids. If privatisation was meant
to galvanise the sector and turn the 12 RECs into commercial tigers,
it's been a flop.
Only Northern, which fought off Trafalgar, and Manweb, which is trying
to rebuff ScottishPower, have put up any real fight. And even then it's
haggling over price. And, in Manweb's case, such distaste for the
latter-day border raiders that any old transatlantic white knight seems
preferable.
Like the English water companies, the RECs have, in the main, found
credible and profitable diversification beyond them. They know about
selling electricity. But that's about it. Many have pulled out of
retailing because they couldn't make any money out of that.
How then, you might wonder, have they managed to make bigger and
bigger profits in the years since privatisation when total demand for
electricity is showing only sluggish growth? Easy. They have hacked away
at their cost base, ensuring that, for thousands of former employees,
the ''everyone wins'' scenario has been a sick joke.
Now, awash with cash and devoid of fresh ideas -- other than share
buy-backs or special dividends for shareholders -- the RECs are rolling
over, one by one, and surrendering their independence if the price is
right. For cosy complacent public utilities read supine,
executive-share-option-lined, enterprise-free zones.
Little wonder then that Labour's plan for a windfall tax has been
endorsed from within the heart of the Tory back-bench establishment. Do
not be surprised if Ken Clarke pinches the whole idea, as his only
remaining way of funding tax cuts in November's Budget.
Voters in the south will love that. If they are shareholders they have
already enjoyed fat returns. As customers, they are to get a #50 bonus
when the National Grid is eventually floated on the market.
Voters in Scotland, reinforcing the stereotype, will feel cheated. If
they are shareholders in ScottishPower or Hydro-Electric they already
know their returns are a fraction of what REC investors have enjoyed,
thanks to the most tightly-priced of all the electricity issues. As
customers, there's no #50 bonus for them. Still, come 1998, they can
always shop around for power -- if they can find a rival supplier, that
is.

EVERYWHERE you look there are festivals to suit all tastes. Take, as a
for instance, Glasgay -- ''Europe's Largest and Most Daring Lesbian and
Gay Arts Festival''.
By its very nature, Glasgay is sexually orientated. And you can't help
feeling the boys and girls running the fest are being a bit naughty with
the titles of some of their events. Like the women's party Appetites
Two: No Holes Barred, a show at the Citizens' Theatre called Talking
Bollocks, and the final hooley Queerbash which we hope the city's
homophobes will not take literally.
Bound to stimulate interest is the EEK! Games organised by the Sair
Feet Theatre Company. It is described as an ''essentially active guide
to safer sex'' and takes the form of an assault course in a spot of
secluded woodland not far from Glasgow city centre.
''EEK! will transport you to the lush countryside of Eekland (the real
destination is a hot secret),'' it says. ''Here you can be physically,
mentally, or sexually challenged by the likes of the Tomgirls, Calamity
Lang, Crystal Fairies, and the Pretty Police.
''Test your safer sex skills by negotiating your way through the Gang
Hut, over the Crystal Hump, and up the Love Tree.''
Glasgay organiser Cordelia Diton explained that the event is a bit
like those paint-ball adventure games which were popular a few years
ago. Without going into too much detail, one of the highlights is to
race around the woods and avoid being splattered with noxious liquids by
''the Undertoads'' -- actors dressed as evil creatures.
To avoid the worst effects of the Undertoads' attack, participants are
issued with upper-body condoms, or black bin bags as they are better
known. Ms Ditton says it is great fun, and she should know since she has
been on what she infelicitously described as ''a dry run''.
Those of a less adventurous nature might wish to attend the gay and
lesbian metalwork event or get into the film Thelma &amp; Louise half-price
by wearing a headscarf, lipstick, and shades. Dominic D'Angelo of
Glasgay has a few words for those who may be a bit concerned about going
along to the festival: ''It is also for people who are perfectly happy
being straight. We're not going to try to educate them out of it.''
Flies-past
THEN we have Fotofeis, the Scottish International Festival of
Photography which offers as part of a vast programme an exhibition
called Dead Flies in Museums. The snaps by Anders Kjaergaard, which can
be seen at the Danish Cultural Institute in Edinburgh, are,
unsurprisingly, of dead flies in museums.
But not just any old photies of dead flies. Enlarged to the same size
as a small child, these dead flies take on ''a monumental, almost
industrial presence''. The pictures are ''sensual, sympathetic images''.
They also mean something. ''The artist suggests that these flies have
been overcome by art, indeed that they themselves have become art. They
are tiny martyrs and their saintly remains are therefore also displayed
. . .''
In other words: ''Waiter, there's a symbolic representation of
cultural idolisation in my soup!''
Spoonful of culture
COMPARED with the above, the programme for the third annual Celtic
Connections festival at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall is comfortingly
familiar. In the line-up for the bigger and better than ever celebration
of all things celtic are Capercaille, Aly Bain, Liz Lochhead, Wolfstone,
Carol Laula, Barbara Dickson, and the entertainingly named Shooglenifty.
But we are particularly looking forward to the learn yourself
spoon-playing sessions and that most celtic of musical pursuits, the
didgeridoo workshop.
Reliable source
BUT enough about art and on to football. Well, the art of sports
writing to be exact. We quote from the German newspaper Bild a section
of their preview of the Rangers-Dortmund European Chamionship game.
The reporter Joachim Schuth offers a Scottish opinion on how the match
might go. ''Das wird fur Dortmund die Holle,'' claims his interviewee, a
grim statement that it's going to be hell for Dortmund. And ''Gazza
wird's schon richten'', meaning that Gazza is going to give the Huns
(the German Huns that is) a right seeing to.
And the purveyor of this expert opinion? It is ''prophezeit mir ein
zahnloser Alter in der Horseshoe Bar'' -- which translates roughly as
''a toothless old prophet in the Horseshoe Bar''. See Glasgow? See the
Horseshoe bar? See toothless old prophets?
Lost cause
THERE are those who fondly believe that Mel Gibson's movie Braveheart
might serve to educate the rest of the world about Scotland's struggle
against the English oppressor and put out the message that there are
four nations (at least) contained in these isles. Well, they should read
the listing for the film in the magazine Flicks: ''Maverick Scots
warrior William Wallace (Mel Gibson) rallies his countrymen against the
tyrannical British . . .''
World's your
oyster pie
OVERHEARD in a small eating house in Garscube Road, Glasgow, where the
lady chef is preparing that well-known local delicacy, a fried-egg roll:
''Haw, Jean, dae ye want yer egg burst ur dae ye want it left runny?''
* STILL on the subject of cuisine, the Ubiquitous Chip in Glasgow is
hosting a rather special dinner and wine-tasting spectacular on Monday
in the Victorian magnificence of the Hutchesons Hall in Ingram Street.
Three masters of wine will take the guests through a card of
champagne, three burgundies, and eight wines from the New World, the
last category including a pudding wine from Rutherglen (no, not the
Rutherglen just past Shawfield, the one down under).
The event is not exactly cheap at #65 a skull but offers the chance to
savour, in addition to the wines, a five-course dinner including Glasgow
mutton and oyster pie and howtowdie chicken with quails' egg. The latter
is served ''in an intense chicken sauce''. We asked Ronnie Clydesdale of
the Chip just how intense the chicken would be but he said it would
depend on how the fowl felt on the night.

WILLIAM RUSSELL meets actor, writer and director Billy Crystal.
IT WAS a day for crystal gazing. Television's best-known gay man was
in London to promote his new film, Forget Paris. Not that Billy Crystal
likes to dwell too much these days on his time in the spoof soap opera,
SOAP, in which he played the first openly gay character on American
television. He would far rather be remembered as the Harry who met
Sally.
In any case, Billy is as straight as a die, having been married to
Janice for 25 years -- she has a great walk, he boasts -- and they have
two grown-up daughters, Jennifer and Lindsay. Billy is a man of parts,
stand-up comedian, television star, film star, script writer and
director.
He hosted the Oscars for four years running, and he has collected five
Emmy awards, six American Comedy Awards and seven Cable Awards. He
treasures the last most because they were all in different catagories.
His latest film, a tripartite affair -- he wrote, directed and stars
in it -- was inspired by a desire to find out what happened after the
couple set off to live happily every after. Did they really do so, or,
as most people suspect of one of the most successful romantic comedies
of recent years, Sleepless in Seattle, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan broke up
before their lift got as far as the ground floor of the Empire State
building.
''Happily-ever-after is a lot of hard work, and I wanted to make a
film that showed how great marriage can be, how difficult it can be, and
what people go through to stay together if they really love each
other,'' Crystal says. ''But it is worth it.'' After 25 years he should
know.
The urge to return to live performing had recently re-awakened, he
adds. Four years ago he decided he was doing too much, was away on tour
too long, and getting less out of it, so he stopped touring. He now
plans, however, to spend the next year developing a live show which he
will stage in New York and maybe bring to London, where he has never
appeared.
He finds people's reactions to When Harry Met Sally interesting. It is
six years since the film was released, yet he is still identified with
it. Sally, Meg Ryan, has a new romantic comedy out later this year,
French Kiss, in which she co-stars with Kevin Kline.
It opened in the US at the same time as Forget Paris in which his
co-star is Debra Winger. ''People's reactions were odd,'' Crystal says.
''They seemed to feel Meg and I were cheating on each other, there is
such a reverence for that movie.''
As to why he chose to write, direct and star in the picture, he says
he felt he had some ideas to express and he knew how he wanted that to
be done. Somebody else might have done a better job, but he wanted to do
this particular one and, in any case, film-making was a co-operation.
He had his fellow script writers Lowell Ganz and Babloo Mandel, on the
set with him throughout, and had he asked everyone's opinion as he went
along, including the prop man, ''Was it working for them?'' But in the
end the decision lay with him.

ROB ADAMS previews next year's Celtic Connections.
IT BEGAN as an event to fill an empty space in January, now Glasgow
Royal Concert Hall's Celtic Connections festival is big business. This
year's event attracted 50,000 paying customers and lest anyone doubt the
hall's commitment to the series, director Cameron McNicol yesterday
expressed his ambition to double that figure by the end of the
millenium.
McNicol was speaking at the programme launch for Celtic Connections
1996, which will run from January 5 to 21. In addition to concerts in
the main auditorium and the Strathclyde Suite, the festival will feature
a new late-night club at the Central Hotel, concerts at the Tramway and
Strathclyde University's Barony Hall and more emphasis on reaching out
to the community to introduce people to Celtic music.
Twenty thousand complimentary tickets will be made available to
schools for morning concerts by bands including Rock Salt &amp; Nails,
Shooglenifty and the Iron Horse, and workshops will invite complete
beginners, as well as more accomplished players, to get involved in
music making.
The concert programme has still to be completed but among those
artists announced are such Celtic Connections favourites as
Capercaillie, New York's Cherish the Ladies, Nova Scotia's Rankin
Family, the Battlefield Band and Wolfstone.
Among the ''first-timers'' who catch the eye for various reasons are
Irish folk godfather Donal Lunny, the brilliant Californian-based Scots
fiddler Alasdair Fraser, a pairing of De Dannan fiddler Frankie Gavin
and jazz maestro Stephane Grappelli, and Barbara Dickson. Full details
will be issued towards the end of November.

David Belcher meets a singer who draws inspiration often from life's
vicissitudes
HAVING had 25 years' practice at being wry and self-deprecating as a
means of earning a crust, Loudon Wainwright III has grown exceedingly
good at it.
For instance, Loudon's hand-out for lazy journalists declares ''My
parents had sex, and nine months later I was born, albeit almost
backwards'', and is embellished with other illustrative lyrics from his
15 albums. There are also handy hints on composing his obituary.
Would-be tombstone-inscribers are appraised of Loudon's Californian
school days with Liza Minnelli, upon whom he had a crush; his teenage
years and a five-day stretch in an Oklahoma jail for possession of
marijuana and his lauding as one of the many new Bob Dylans.
Approaching 50, Loudon feels that every newspaper obits-editor would
wish to remind readers of his mercurial appearances in MASH as Captain
Spaulding, the singing surgeon; of his two 1980s Grammy nominations; of
his one 1973 hit single, Dead Skunk, ''Which is about a dead skunk,
lying in the road, stinking up to high heaven, although some people felt
it was about Richard Nixon, which is fine by me.''
But why should Loudon's downbeat self-perceptions matter to the rest
of us? Because they are the motivation for Loudon's splendid new album,
Grown Man, issued on Monday on the Virgin label. And why is Grown Man
splendid?
Because while Grown Man features all Loudon's trademarks -- guilt,
humour, painful personal insight, self-chastisement, moral ambivalence
-- it also proves that ''grown'' need not be synonymous with
''decayed''. Oh -- and it's got good tunes, too.
''Like I say on Grown Man's title track, most days I go from feeling
seven to feeling two months. When did I grow up? When my father died in
1988 . . . that's when you get the grown-ups' wake-up call.
''Freud said that the death of a parent was the single most important
event in adult life, and it was certainly mind-blowing for me. I was
left wrestling with the idea of feeling like a child . . . who's looking
forward to death and decay.''
At which point Loudon laughs heartily. I note this.
''Hey, what else can you do? The world's a terrible place . . . and in
fact that's the title of a new song that's not on this current album . .
. The World Is A Terrible Place -- but heck, I play it on the banjo so
it at least has a happy sound.''
Loudon's domestic life hasn't been so rinky-dink. Previous albums have
been vehicles for angst about his two divorces, his children and how
Loudon often felt he'd accorded them less than they deserved. Indeed,
one of Loudon's daughters, 19-year-old Martha, is enlisted on Grown Man
to quiz her father in song about his failures as a parent.
''I got into an argument with her about me and my numerous songs about
her and her brother. So we ended up yelling at each other in a
restaurant, in tears . . . and of course I wrote a song about it.
''In Father Daughter Dialogue, Martha sings the strongest argument,
pinning me to the wall about having been uptight or simply not around
when she was growing up. And typically I grant myself the song's last
word on the subject. But all I'm doing is presenting the argument, not
resolving it. I admit I'm still confounded by it.''
In contrast, Loudon appears wholly unconfounded by the existence of
Sapphic desire. Loudon's I Wish I Was A Lesbian is a breakneck punk-folk
epic. All together now! I wish I was a lesbian and not a hetero/ I
wouldn't have to mess with men and all their come and go/ And all that
awful facial hair and yucky machismo.
''Like Dead Skunk, it's just another ridiculous novelty song. But it
does have anthemic possibilities . . . it should really be sung by a
straight woman, of course, but I hope word will get out to k.d.''
Everyone with an ear for the craft of the singer should know about
another of Grown Man's creations, Human Cannonball, whereupon Loudon
brings an old cliche to life. Ever remarked that such-and-such could
sing the telephone book and you'd be spellbound?
Well, Loudon does almost literally that, creating undying art from a
New York Times obituary of Emanuel Zacchini, a retired circus performer.
''I was struck by the title on the notice -- Emanuel Zacchini Sr,
Human Cannonball, 84 -- and I just editorialised a little at the end
about the human condition. It's not about me, for once. But it is. And
about everybody else.''
That's the singular Loudon Wainwright III for you, a long way from
dead and some way short of a skunk.
* Loudon Wainwright next visits Scotland to play at the Festival
Theatre, Edinburgh, on November 12 and Aberdeen's Playhouse (November
13).

Ann Shaw refuses to buy packaging's big illusion
WE BUY dreams in the hope of improving our health. But am I alone in
being irritated by the amount of unnecessary packaging you get these
days? Chemists and health shops seem to be the worst culprits.
All too often we open a container and discover it's less than
two-thirds full.
There appears to be an insidious tendency these days for
pharmaceutical companies, the purveyors of health in a bottle, to
neglect filling their containers up, thus giving the impression that you
are getting more than you really are. This practice is
particularlycommon among health food supplements.
Yet the pharmaceutical companies are doing nothing illegal. The number
of pills or capsules, or weight in powder, is clearly stated.
Slick packaging not only makes for a better display but if the
contents were put in the containers suitably sized for their contents,
consumers would think twice before dipping into their pockets.
One of the worst examples of misleading packaging I found was a bottle
of selenium. Would you pay #7 for a small bottle of pills?
Successful prosecutions have been brought. In the past, Pears were
sued for selling jars of cold cream with false bottoms.
In these ecologically aware times, is it right to spend all this money
on wasteful packaging? One can't help thinking that a hidden agenda
exists to persuade people that they are getting more for their money
than they really are.
This, of course, is something that the companies hotly deny. They
argue that it's more economical to use standardised bottles and yes,
some products may not fill the allocated container.
Another argument is that extra room is needed for settlement. Fine if
we are talking about powder, but do we really need all that extra room
for pills and capsules?
This is not an argument that convinces the consumer watchdogs. Surely
it can't be good practice to use a third more packaging than needed?
Packaging is a very ''live issue'' in the industry, which is
particularly sensitive at present in view of imminent Government
legislation following an EC directive.
The EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste is said to be one of
the most contentious pieces of European legislation ever devised,
according to a spokesman for Incpen, the UK's Industry Council for
Packaging and the Environment.
The controversy stems from the wide implications of the rules, which
cut across every aspect of packaging. Whether this extends to the
specialised areas like wasted space in containers remains to be seen.
Certainly Anne Foster, director of the Scottish Consumer Council
thinks it should: ''We are concerned that there is no setting of targets
for minimising waste. We believe it is possible to reduce the packaging
on goods.''
This is something that Incpen agrees with. ''We believe that packaging
should be as flexible as possible.''
''Anything that is misleading, or potentially misleading, is bad
packaging. We believe it is bad environmentally and not in the best
interest of consumers.''
OK, the argument goes, it's necessary to standardise packaging in
order to give the consumer best value for money.
I remain unconvinced. It's strange that this only seems to occur in
products at the luxury end of the market.
Other manufacturers seem to be able to fill up their containers quite
nicely.
What the companies say:
BOOTS
* ''ALL Boots packaging clearly declares the contents by weight or
volume as appropriate. In the case of tablets or capsules the limited
range of standard container sizes available means that, as the
individual item sizes vary and the numbers of items must be a round
figure, it is not always possible to fill the standard sized
container.''
Products examined:
Boots Multifibre, 150 tablets, #4.99.
Boots Garlic, Fish Oil and Lecithin-30 capsules, #2.79.
Boots Evening Primrose Oil, 80 capsules, #5.89p.
Boots Antioxidants, 60 multivitamins #5.49.
JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON
* ''OUR powder is made under very strict weighing procedures therefore
to underfill a container is not a usual occurrence. In every container
there will be a space at the top -- this allows for settlement. If the
container has been standing unused for a long period either at home or
on the shop shelf , the product will settle further down than a
container that is used more frequently.''
Product examined:
Johnson's Baby Powder, 500 grams (#1.89).
QUEST
* ''YOU happen to have picked on our smallest product. If you examined
others in the range you would find the bottles quite full.
''We optimise our resources and improve our buying power by using just
three bottle sizes. However, a small minority, such as Selenium, only
occupy a quarter of the bottle. To accommodate it in a smaller bottle
would be impractial and expensive and would result in an increase in the
product cost to our customers.''
Product examined:
Selenium, 90 tablets, #6.99p.
GERARD HOUSE
* ''FOR the sake of conformity of the display stand and production, we
use the same size pot for our range of products. As some tablets are
smaller than others there is more space left in the pot.''
Product examined:
Passiflora Natural Sleep, 100 tablets #3.85p.
GERARD HOUSE
* ''USING standardised packaging offers the best value to customers.
Occasionally there is more ullage, space between product and container,
in some containers than others.''
Products examined:
Pulse Pure Fish Oil, 60 capsules.
Pure Cod Liver Oil and Multivitamins, 30 capsules #3.09.
Pure Cod Liver Oil, 30 capsules #2.45.
LUSTYS NATURAL PRODUCTS
* ''WE aim to standardise our packaging as far as possible. That way
we keep the price down for the customer. It would increase the price if
we had to use a different container for every item in our range.''
Product examined:
Garlic perles, 500 capsules, #3.35.

BRIAN JOSEPH meets a piemaker whose upper-crust wares are going down a
treat
WITH too many entrepreneurs biting the dust within their first year of
trading, talk of franchising your business after just a fortnight takes
some crust.
Fortunately, Johan Venter extrudes the stuff -- along with confidence
to match -- at his newly launched Piemaker shop in Old Town Edinburgh.
Even by fast-food standards, the bold challenge to the traditional
Scots pie-eating palate has been meteoric for a South African expat to
whom dough was a financial commodity until a few months ago.
The measure of his achievement is sales of 5000 pies in the first two
weeks, with the prospect of more than doubling that as Piemaker's
reputation spreads by word of mouth.
''On the face of it, coming from Jo'burg to sell pies to the Scots
could smack of taking coals to Newcastle,'' admits 47-year-old Venter.
What he identified after meticulous research (''did you know there are
352 bakers in Edinburgh?'') was a gap -- or pastry case -- to be filled
with instant and endless variety dictated by the customer.
So, alongside the pepper steak, chicken, steak and kidney, beef and
onion and chilli mince, there's vegetarian and plenty more to take away
for 79p.
''In fact, you're welcome to bring in your own filling (''corned beef
and mash, madam? My pleasure!'') and we'll convert it to a piping-hot
pie within minutes,'' boasts Venter, as his five-strong team responds to
the challenge of bestowing hand-baked individuality at a pace that
wouldn't disgrace McDonalds.
Talking of whom reminds Venter of his ambitions to see a Piemaker in
high streets the length and breadth of Scotland, and beyond.
''Of course, anyone can copycat the idea -- but to ensure success you
need a business strategy that's not half-baked and the secret of the
light, puffy pastry which is the hallmark of our pies,'' he says with a
hint of Coca-Cola mystique.
The vital ingredients combined to perfection when the erstwhile
development consultant teamed up with master baker Kobus Vanniekerk in
the Namibian capital Windhoek to produce a winning formula.
As the waft of fresh, all-day baking beckoned the first customers to
38 South Bridge, EH1, Namibians were flocking to the opening of a
Windhoek's pioneering Macpie. ''I resisted that one,'' says Venter with
a smile.
Not that he can't rise to the occasion: a poster boldly announces
''Pies so fresh they'll pinch your bum and call you darlin' ''
The feedback, he says, is gratifying. ''Customers obviously appreciate
the novelty of a made-to-order takeaway straight from the oven, and
demand for bumper-sized packs is taking off. Businessmen, students,
housewives -- we're satisfying every taste.''
* Piemaker is open Monday to Saturday from 10am to 6pm. Phone 0131-556
8566.

* AMID conflicting views this week about the impact of the Citizen's
Charter, ScottishPower customers may feel John Major's consumer
initiative has electrified standards of service.
In a leaflet going out with current bills, SP claims it is now
achieving more than 99% of what it promised to deliver.
And they're putting their money where their mouth is by guaranteeing
compensation when they fail: domestic customers who lose their supply
through a fault in the system can claim #40 if they are not reconnected
within 24 hours, and #20 for each extra 12 hours without power.
If home appointments are broken, up to #40 will be paid -- #100 for
business users.
ScottishPower also plans to cut the number of bills sent out by a
third -- from next January down to four a year. But meter readers will
be calling more often to ensure greater accuracy.
* DIY home builders can come in from the cold with a new club that
aims to make them part of a friendly self-help operation.
Building-materials supplier Marley has launched the club to provide
free advice and support for the increasing number of families putting a
roof over their own heads.
Tempted by big savings, enthusiasts built 16,000 last year, carrying
out the work themselves or acting as project managers and hiring skilled
professionals.
Marley's Self Build Club provides free technical advice and updates
members on new legislation, products, and special offers, as well as
linking them to builders' merchants.
Membership costs #5, but as a special introductory offer it's free
until next year. To register write to Marley Building Materials, Station
Road, Coleshill, West Midlands, B46 1HP (telephone 01675 468400).
* WITH mounting concern about the back-up carers can expect as health
resources are squeezed, Boots have set up a helpline, 0115 959 2282, to
explain benefits they are entitled to.
Two years ago, a new system of support was introduced for frail,
disabled, and sick people and the family and friends who look after
them. But many carers seem unaware of Community Care services like
meals-on-wheels, home-helps, aids for everyday tasks like bathing and
occupational therapy.
Boots have teamed up with the Carers National Association to produce a
guide -- A Fair Deal for Carers. For a free copy write to Boots Carers,
PO Box 94, Nottingham NG2 3AA.
* A GUIDE to healthy eating for third-agers, Making Sense of Food, and
other nutritional information for the elderly is available from the
National Dairy Council, 5/7 John Princes Street, London W1M OAP.
* AS cash-strapped students return for the new term, TV Licensing is
reminding them they need a licence for televisions operated away from
home. The rule applies whether they watch in halls of residence or
private accommodation.
The single exception is a battery-operated TV, which is covered by the
parents' licence. Small screen sets can be bought for less than the
#86.50 cost of a colour licence; they also have the advantage of being a
disincentive to spend long hours viewing, to the negect of studies!
Students opting to pay the full fee (#28.50 for black and white) can
choose special monthly or quarterly budget plans, or use TV savings
stamps. For details write to TV Licensing, Bristol BS98 1TL.
* NEW all-purpose descaler Oust claims to banish limescale from
kettles, steam irons, coffee machines and showerheads. Three-sachet
cartons are #1.49 at supermarkets, chemists and hardware stores. . . .
Keep kids amused on winter nights with colourful Play-Doh that allows
them to model fantastic shapes. A 6oz tub costs #4.49, with a kit at
#9.99 that contains safety scissors, knives, roller and moulds . . .
Billed as the most exciting new product this decade for helping mums
with young babies, Nappytape promises to end the nightmare of finding
the disposable nappy tape ''unsticky''. It's in the shops next week . .

Countless victims of the carnage in Bosnia lie buried in mass graves,
the proof about war crimes buried with them, says Carole Hughes
THE discovery of a mass grave in the middle of Europe in the 1990s is
a shock at the best of times, but the unearthing last week of an
extensive grave site near the town of Kljuc in north-west Bosnia will
come as little surprise to those familiar with the United Nations War
Crimes Report, commissioned by the UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros
Ghali, and published last year.
According to the commission there was evidence of 187 grave sites in
former Yugoslavia, at least 99 of which are believed to contain victims
of mass killings, the majority alleged to have been of Muslim origin
killed by Serbs. If this proves to be the case, then the discovery at
Kljuc may be just the tip of the iceberg.
The final report of the commission (the full version of which is more
than 3000 pages of investigations and personal testimonies), makes
alarming reading.
In a study of the embattled district of Prijedor, it was found that a
total of 52,800 non-Serbs had been either killed or deported in ''ethnic
cleansing'' programmes in 1992, events that the commission considered
would be likely to be confirmed in court as constituting genocide.
Bearing in mind that the War Crimes Commission (and now the War Crimes
Tribunal at the Hague, which acts on the findings) had from its
inception been starved of funds and was able to carry out extensive
research only in limited areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is likely that
in the final reckoning an even more startling picture may emerge of
crimes committed in former Yugoslavia during that period.
Bosnian evacuees in Scotland, a number of whom are from the region of
Kljuc, view the recent news with mixed feelings. While rejoicing at the
liberation of their home towns by Bosnian and Croat forces, they are at
the same time brought face to face with the horrendous events of three
years ago when Serb paramilitaries entered towns and villages in
northern and eastern Bosnia and terrorised the civilian population.
When considering the facts that are coming to light, it has to be
questioned whether the intended division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which
49% is awarded to General Radovan Karadzic and his people, a minority
representing no more than 20% of the total population, is either viable
in practical terms or a precursor to peace.
Concern was expressed by the chairman of the War Crimes Commission,
Professor Cherif Bassiouni, an expert in international law, that the
findings of the report should be acted on with urgency. Yet there is
little evidence of this. The difficulties and unease of a number of
human rights groups is perhaps best expressed by Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
until recently UN special rapporteur on human rights in former
Yugoslavia.
In his letter of resignation after the fall of Srebrenica and Zepa
last July, Mazowiecki wrote: ''Crimes have been committed with swiftness
and brutality and, by contrast, the response of the international
community has been slow and ineffectual.''
The problems are not confined to Bosnia, as there have also been 44
mass grave sites identified in Croatia. One at Ovcara, believed to
contain the bodies of about 200 people who were in Vukover Hospital in
1991 when the city fell to the Serbs, has been closed to international
access since that time, despite concerted efforts by the War Crimes
Commission and other human rights groups to gain admittance to carry out
forensic tests.
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic has reserved the right of his
government forces to liberate the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This
statement has been greeted with varying degrees of trepidation by the
international peace negotiators striving to minimise the warfare.
Yet what is the alternative? If all the territory of Bosnia and
Herzegovina is not liberated and communications everywhere opened, then
many of the victims of horrendous crimes will remain buried undiscovered
in mass graves throughout the country, the proof of what happened
alongside them. It is doubtful that this would provide the basis for the
re-establishment of international law and order in the Europe of the
1990s.

LLOYDS has become the first bank in the UK to issue cheque books
designed for left-handed people.
The books have the bound end on the right, with the cheques laid out
on the left. They open left to right.
A spokesman for Lloyds, which estimates 900,000 of its six million
customers are left-handed, said right-handers have had it all their own
way long enough.
''We think it will work,'' said a spokeswoman. ''We have had a lot of
complaints from left-handed customers which we have decided to respond
to.''
However, Ms Diane Paul, who has written two books about
left-handedness and runs an information centre for left-handers in
Manchester, said the innovation was probably doomed to fail.
''It's a very good idea and I wish all banks did it,'' she said. ''But
I think they'll soon find that it's not financially worth their while
because there will be so little demand.''

THE Army is to offer front-line soldiers a #1400 cash bounty to stay
on for an extra year of service, the Ministry of Defence confirmed
yesterday.
The money will benefit soldiers approaching their third year with the
infantry, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Armoured Corps, and the
Household Cavalry.
A spokesman for the MoD said: ''We are launching the re-engagement
bounty with some regiments because of the shortages they are facing in
the number of soldiers in their early years of service.''
The move follows a 20% cut in Army numbers brought about by the end of

It is understood that fighting troops have been targeted rather than
soldiers in units such as the Royal Engineers, who are more likely to
stay on because they are learning skills useful in civilian life.

A MAN claimed yesterday that he was sacked from his job at a pork
factory because of his complaints about blood and maggots to the
management and health and safety authorities.
Former offshore health and safety officer Mr Alan Bruce, 49, told an
industrial tribunal in Inverness how he was only in his #150-a-week job
as a yardsman at the Grampian Country Pork factory in Buckie for a few
weeks.
Mr Bruce, of Heldon Place, New Elgin, Moray, said that only general
rubbish and cardboard should have been put in a crusher in the factory
yard. But some of the 270 employees were dumping the remains of pigs and
bags of blood in it.
Said Mr Bruce: ''Flies were entering the mouth of the crusher and were
feeding on the blood and raw meat there, with the result maggots started
breeding in the crusher.''
Mr Bruce claimed he was also asked by factory manager Mr Harold Brown
to dump five 45-gallon drums of a water, blood, and diesel oil mixture
on the verge of a road at the back of the factory.
But he refused because he knew it was against environmental health
rules.
Mr Grant Cruikshank, personnel manager, claimed he had never heard of
the drums incident and accused Mr Bruce of never raising health and
safety issues.
Mr Bruce, a former civilian and RAF fireman, agreed his dismissal
letter claimed he had a poor work output and general attitude.
The tribunal was adjourned until later.

Margaret Vaughan investigates after a car-leasing company's survey put
the skids under voluntary workers and journalists
MARTIN BELL maybe, John Pilger, yes, and possibly Esther Rantzen. But
the deputy assorted hand-crafts and pigeon-racing correspondent of the
Chipping Sodbury Bugle? And those valiant souls who tootle along
delivering meals-on-wheels?
Granted, it's no surprise that journalists live up to their droll
cliches, reflected in the results of the latest survey to show that they
are the most accident-prone of drivers. But charity workers?
According to research conducted by a company car leasing operator,
Cowie Interleasing, the stereotypical journalist -- you know, the
slouching figure in the dirty mac lurking under a palace fourposter --
is only marginally more accident prone on the mean streets than those
road ragers disguised in beige twinsets as collectors for good causes.
The survey was based on information held by the group which processes
about 1000 former company cars a month. Cowie claim the accidents,
ranging from bumps to serious collisions, confirm figures charged by
insurance companies for different categories of drivers. And
journalists, commonly treated as the highest risks, fare poorly in the
survey along with those employed in printing and advertising and, oddly,
charity workers.
Which came as something of a surprise to three insurance companies, a
leading firm of insurance brokers, and my friend Digger. A reporter of
many years standing, and many, many more sitting on buses, he was
scathing of the findings: ''Laughable. I mean it's the usual absurd
stereotyping,'' he slurred, flicking dandruff off his upturned collar at
the bar before being rudely interrupted by an elderly lady with a
collecting tin.
''What's more,'' he continued, between swallows, ''I've been knocked
down twice in my life, once by an accountant and the second time by a
banker, both of whom are said in the so-called survey to be among the
least accident-prone.''
''Let me tell you that I've been doing charitable work with fallen
journalists for years and I've a spotless driving-licence,'' insisted
the lady with the empty collecting tin, leading the way to the kerb.
''And I've yet to be involved in a crash,'' she added, adjusting her
mirror and proving her point by sharply avoiding a collision with an
oncoming Corporation bus.
It's hard for ordinary people, and police officers, to understand how
much pressure journalists are under to meet deadlines which may be how
they gained such a reckless reputation.
But, says James Duffell of Norwich Union, it's wrong to view them all
as gin-sodden wrecks: ''They're not like that much any more,'' he said,
kindly. ''The only journalists we think of as high risk are television
types who might give famous entertainers lifts in their car.''
If, for example, Jonathan Ross were to give a member of Blur a lift
home and the car was to crash, rendering one or both unable for work,
while this might not cause some people much grief, it would cost the
insurance companies a lot of money in lost earnings and personal injury
claims.
''No, I think you can fairly say that most journalists would not be
high risk. And charity workers?  They don't feature on our high-risk
list at all. I can't imagine why they should.''
He went on to elucidate the type of jobs that are viewed as bad risks
for the purposes of driving insurance: ''Circuses, fairground workers,
models, professional sports personalities, film producers, those sort of
people. We used to regard oil workers as a bad risk because they went
crazy after a dry fortnight on the rigs, but they don't seem to do that
any more.'' A bit like journalists, really.
''The high premiums are more linked to the number of miles covered
than the type of job,'' he explained. Such as? ''Well reps, and sales
managers, and pizza deliverers.'' (Meals-on-wheels organisers may want
to note the latter point when devising menus.)
A spokesman for Direct Line insurance, while confirming that neither
elderly ladies attempting to save the whale nor sulking journalists were
in their bad books, had a different hit-list of risky types:
''Croupiers, they're always a bad risk. Not because they crash a lot but
their cars do tend to attract the attentions of people from casinos
who've lost a lot.''  The vehicles of bouncers, too, have a tendency to
attract vandals, he pointed out.
Paul Lock from Eagle Star was shocked by the findings of the survey:
''Heavens, are you sure? I do a lot of charity work and I'm a former
journalist involved in publicity and advertising. But no, it's mainly
entertainers we think are risky. I can't imagine where they get such
ideas.''
It seemed unkind to remind him of the errant freelance journalist
turned charity worker whose hire car was found wrecked on what remained
of a double yellow line in a side-street off Sarajevo in June. So I
didn't.

<TEXT>
THE war between Eurotunnel and the ferry companies intensified
yesterday as the Channel Tunnel operator slashed duty-free prices for Le
Shuttle passengers by one third.
Eurotunnel made no secret of its aim to attract cross-Channel business
from its competitors, who reacted with withering criticism.
The company, which said reductions of 33% were effective from today,
has sought in court to put an end to duty-free sales, saying ferry
companies' right to sell on-board gives them an unfair advantage.
Eurotunnel is restricted to selling duty-free goods to Le Shuttle
passengers at shops at each end of the tunnel.
Chief executive Georges-Christian Chazot said: ''By returning real
duty-free savings to our customers, we expect to divert traffic from our
competitors and create business based on a long-term value proposition
second to none.''
It said yesterday's reduction was entirely consistent with its
corporate position on duty-free -- ''which is to level the playing field
by ending the huge subsidies afforded by the two Governments to
Eurotunnel's competitors''.
A spokesman for P&amp;O European Ferries said: ''This smacks of
desperation from the tunnel. Perhaps they haven't been offering the
value for money that we do.
''We already offer tremendous value for money to our passengers and
this will have no effect on us whatever.
''When it comes to duty-free, Eurotunnel is a very small player
indeed. It's been suggested they may be doing this to shift the backlog
they have in their shops.
''We offer a vast range of shopping on board. If people want to shop
on the shuttle, they have to delay their journey.''
Stena Sealink was equally unimpressed. Spokesman Brian Rees said:
''This is fiddling while Rome burns. Tinkering with duty-free prices
isn't going to get Eurotunnel off the hook with its banks.
''Eurotunnel has continually failed to attract the volumes of
passengers it needs to cover its massive debts.
''Considering the scale of its problems, it is difficult to see how
reducing duty-free prices is going to win over passengers to a product
that few people actually want.
''Eurotunnel should make up its mind about duty-frees. On one hand it
has tried -- and failed -- through the courts to deny all passengers
this perk, while on the other hand it attempts to be competitive by
discounting its duty-free prices.''
A Eurotunnel spokesman said last night: ''They would say that,
wouldn't they? Let's wait and see who's desperate.''

Michael Tumelty reveals how an amateur orchestra is getting the
professional treatment
THREE of Scotland's leading composers have been signed up, in an
unusual joint commissioning project, to provide a series of new
compositions for an amateur orchestra.
Glasgow Caledonian University has teamed up with the amateur Glasgow
Chamber Orchestra in a #10,000 venture, supported by the Scottish Arts
Council, to commission three new works from composers Edward McGuire,
John Maxwell Geddes, and Sally Beamish. The works will be produced and
performed over the next two years, and taken into the orchestra's
repertoire.
The relationship between the Glasgow Chamber Orchestra and the
university extends back to a time when the orchestra, faced with
financial difficulties, approached the university for assistance.
Glasgow Caledonian effectively took on the sponsorship of the 45-strong
orchestra by providing free rehearsal space within its premises, and
some publicity.
Hugh Levey, chairman of the orchestra, said yesterday that the GCO had
always been keen on commissioning new works, and had done so in the
past. The problem, especially for an amateur orchestra, is finance. As
it is, the orchestra's funding from the National Federation of Music
Societies is required to pay for the hire of music and the rental of any
halls in which the orchestra gives concerts.
The alliance with Glasgow Caledonian University thus gives a fairly
unique opportunity for an amateur orchestra to flex its muscles in new
music. The three composers were invited, said Mr Levey, after
representatives of the orchestra had listened to a range of their music,
and also on the basis of their reputations. ''They carry a lot of
credibility and are associated with the generation of quality works,''
he said.
Professor John Phillips, vice-chancellor of the university, expressed
his delight in the new partnership, and said that Glasgow Caledonian's
contribution towards the cost of the project will come from the
University Court Fund -- monies provided by private earnings and
consultancies, and used for purposes ranging from hardship funds to
sporting events.
Edward McGuire's Caledonian Muse will be the first composition to be
played, at a concert in the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in
Glasgow in June next year. The new works by Geddes and Beamish will
follow within a year.
The three commissions, said Professor Phillips, will provide a focal
point for the 40th anniversary of the Glasgow Chamber Orchestra, which
falls in 1996.

WHY stage Henry V in the mid-1990s? Shakespeare wrote it in 1599 when
the English army was in Ireland. The play is thus a celebration of
military valour and the soldier-king, epitomising English patriotism.
The propaganda value of Nelson's favourite play is well known. In 1939
Laurence Olivier delivered the ringing speeches on radio and at
patriotic rallies at the Albert Hall. His celebrated film version made
in 1944 was dedicated to the Commandos.
In 1995 there are fewer enemies on the horizon, and patriotism --
Shakespeare's English patriotism at least -- is at a low ebb. Any modern
director must therefore search hard to find contemporary relevance for
the play. Matthew Warchus, winner of the 1993 Shakespeare Globe Classic
Award for Most Promising Newcomer, emphasises the vicious aspects of the
victory and the brutality of the king in this production for the RSC
showing in London.
Henry's horrific threats to the citizens of Harfleur are a reminder of
the Bosnian conflict and the symbolic use of the poppies points to the
human cost of war.
But there isn't enough in the play to permit a reading which
supersedes patriotism altogether. Henry V's harshness makes him
uncharismatic in the crucial battle scenes, leaving a vacuum at the core
of the interpretation. Sadly other elements of the production do little
to distract an audience from this conceptual dilemma. Sets and costumes
seem to come from the RSC's storeroom; the lighting is often clumsy; and
the acting, with the exception of Iain Glen as King Harry, is
uninspired. One leaves with an unanswered question: why stage Henry V in
1995?

THE major problem with Strathclyde Theatre Group's production of
Orton's sick farce is that it just isn't very funny. Raising an
occasional subdued titter is not really a great achievement with a
script that can reduce an audience to tearful hysteria; the kind of
hysteria which covers the creeping possibility that Orton's black
picture of a thoroughly corrupt British society may not be so far from
the truth.
The production suffers from serious mis-casting in key roles, with Hal
and Dennis, Orton's camp, sussed, and laddish central characters coming
across as gormless cor-blimey cockneys. OK, so Strathclyde Theatre Group
can't stretch to the services of Adam Ant, or Chris (Mick's wee brother)
Jagger, both of whom have captured the essential sleazily sexy,
homo-erotic note of Orton's anti-heroes in past years, but Orton without
beautiful boys is a bit like Shakespeare without verse.
The playwright's confident handling of the genre of farce, his
portrayal of a relentless chain of ridiculous incidents escalating
towards a ludicrous, if inevitable, denouement, calls for sharp timing
and snappy direction. His thoroughly British, thoroughly black, and
thoroughly camp brand of theatre works best when performed at speed,
with an air of reckless style, and a feeling for the tacky glamour of
the ballroom or bingo hall.
Sadly, director Peter Lamb fails to capture any of these qualities.
The production stumbles along, with a total disregard for comic pacing,
and no sense of the intended feverish pitch of events at its conclusion.
A rich opportunity to bring to life a kitsch, but hard-biting, classic
squandered in this dreary, plodding piece of theatre.

IF you want a case against the stage adaptation of novels -- which
isn't a case I normally care to make -- you need look no further than
this treatment of Georg Buchner's Lenz.
For all that Boilerhouse's production has been devised by the company,
freshly scripted for the stage by novelist Alan Warner (of Morvern
Caller fame), and presented as a new work not adapted from, but inspired
by, Buchner's original, it hangs heavy with all the things that make
good novels good and bad theatre bad.
It's not so much that Warner's script makes explicit its literary
roots -- the dialogue being an intriguing mixture of the reported and
the direct: ''I asked him to dance with me,'' says one character; ''No I
can't,'' comes the reply -- it's more that it refuses to shake off the
reflective tone of the novel and to take on the active form of the
stage.
The result is that the barrage of theatrical tricks that director Paul
Pinson drums up -- the high-speed projected cloudscape, the flailing
arcs of Andy Howitt's choreography, and the unrelenting soundtrack that
features everything from ambient doodlings to multi-layered voices --
seems to be there not to enhance but to compensate for the lack of drama
in the story.
If the characters had engaged in real conversation with each other, if
there had been some interaction to explain the fearsome emotions on
display, perhaps I might not have been left with the nagging doubt that
I'd missed a first act that no-one had told me about.
As it stands, the material gives the actors only two emotions to go
for -- angst-ridden or vague -- and though a sincere and adventurous
attempt at theatre-making, it communicates little.
After Edinburgh, No New Miracles tours to Glasgow, Dundee, and
Aberdeen.

Dance
JUST about every shade of humour -- from the fuchsia of arch camp to
the black and ultra-violent kind -- makes a significant appearance in
this triple bill. In Mark Baldwin's Banter Banter -- a set of merry,
casual encounters gorgeously in step with his choice of Stravinski piano
solos -- the fun lies in the occasional, colloquial gesture that winks
at us from amid the easy, elegant dance.
Swansong, choreographed by Christopher Bruce, uses humorous elements
of vaudeville, particularly tap dance, to make a poignant, sinister
comedy of political oppression and interrogation. And, to remind us that
tyranny and suffering know no bounds -- including those of gender -- the
piece can be performed by either an all-male or an all-female trio.
Last night the prisoner and two guards were women: Didy Veldman, Kate
Coyne, and Sarah Warsop. Previously I'd seen it danced by men -- and
yes, there is a difference. This time the brutality had more of an
insidious, cat-and-mouse feel to it.
In Rooster -- also by Bruce -- the joke is, very affectionately, on
the dudes and attitudes of the generation who strutted their stuff to
the sound of the Rolling Stones. Cracking music and some hilariously
funny touches in choreography that picks up on the fast and furious mood
of the times, as well as the dandy element in guys like Steven Brett,
whose sloping, studied swagger made him very much the cock of the walk.
Rambert at its most appealing, a triple bill that shows off the
versatility of the dancers while also proving that good dance can
encompass everything, including works of conscience.

THE Official Monster Raving Loony Party conference has a thirst for
daft ideas -- and yesterday the party's conference came up with a
cracker for future droughts.
Raving Loony chairman Alan Hope told the conference in Ashburton,
Devon: ''We say every holidaymaker who comes down here should bring two
gallons of water -- one to use and the other to throw in the
reservoir.''
Mr Hope, who is landlord of the Golden Lion Hotel, where the
conference is being held, insisted there was a serious message behind
everything the Loonies did.
Clad in a white suit and Stetson hat, he said they would be discussing
why dancing was not allowed in pubs on Sundays.
''We think that is really loony -- as you can shop, play football, and
go horseracing on a Sunday,'' said Mr Hope.
The party claims more than 13,000 UK members and another 12,000 among
expatriates.
One supporter from Florida, Mrs Marlene Shaw, said yesterday the party
was ''wonderful'', adding: ''If there was another like this in the
States I'm not aware of it.''
She and her British husband Steve are thinking of starting a Florida
branch.
Pop star Captain Sensible, at his first conference, said: ''The
country has been run by loonies for as long as I can remember. It is
time to give the real people a chance.''

<HEADLINE>MP condemns #8.6m costs of catering project. MoD under fire over cooks' training bill</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>17</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976142589</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Ministry of Defence is spending #8.6m a year of taxpayers' money
to train cooks, a Labour MP said yesterday -- the equivalent of #38,400
a year for each trainee chef.
In the case of the Army, the cost of over #900 a week to train a cook
was more than #540 higher than the price of a one-week advanced course
at the celebrated Leith School of Food and Wine, whose co-principal is
Treasury Chief Secretary William Waldegrave's wife, Caroline.
Publishing official figures supplied to him by Armed Forces Minister
Nicholas Soames, Labour MP Stephen Byers accused the MoD of wasting cash
at a time of defence cutbacks. The MoD is currently training 224 cooks.
''We all know that an army is said to march on its stomach, but to
spend #48,000 a year -- more than #900 a week -- to train a cook for the
Army is simply unacceptable,'' said Mr Byers, MP for Wallsend.
He called on Defence Secretary Michael Portillo to explain why the
forces needed to spend so much money to train cooks, and why each
service had to have its own separate school to do the training.
Each service has its own catering manual. In the case of the Royal
Navy, it runs to 73 chapters and includes advice on different types of
cigars.
It also suggests putting candles in a refrigerator for two to three
hours before use to ''ensure an even burning''.
Mr Byers demanded: ''Does Mr Portillo regard the training of an extra
224 cooks at a cost of #8.6m as really putting the front-line first?''
The MP said details given to him in a parliamentary answer by Mr
Soames showed:
* The Army School of Catering at St Omer Barracks, Aldershot, had 157
cooks undergoing training at an annual cost of #7.536m -- #48,000 per
trainee.
* The Royal Navy School at HMS Raleigh in Cornwall had 49 cooks in
training at an annual cost of #850,000 -- #17,347 per trainee.
* The RAF school at RAF Halton, near Aylesbury, was training 18 cooks
at a cost of #215,000 -- #11,944 per trainee.
An MoD spokesman said the figures, though correct, did not take into
account a number of different factors.
The reason for high Army costs was because the cookery school stood
alone on a site and had to pay all the overheads, while the RAF and Navy
cookery schools in Cornwall and Halton shared premises with other groups
and therefore benefited from shared bulk costs.
He said Mr Byers had also ignored the fact that Army and Navy chefs
were trained as soldiers and sailors as well as cooks, and were offered
additional advanced courses such as catering and nutrition.
The spokesman said: ''That is why the costs may look to be extreme,
especially in the case of the Army, but we are training soldiers and
sailors as well.''

A FARMER who was in contact with cows suffering from BSE -- the
so-called mad cow disease -- has died from what is regarded as the human
form of the disease.
The farmer, who died in Bristol, is the third in the UK to died of
Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease after being in contact with cows suffering from
BSE.
Mad cow disease has been associated with cattle feed containing
sheeps' brain but the link between that and CJD -- a spongy degeneration
of the brain -- remains unproven.
Reporting the death in the Lancet today, Dr P E M Smith, from the
national CJD surveillance unit at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh,
and doctors who treated the farmer in Bristol, said the occurrence was
clearly a matter of concern.
The probability of discovering three or more farmers with CJD in
England and Wales since 1990 ranged from about one in 10 to one in 5000,
depending on the type of farm and type of work done on it.
However, they added: ''A case-control study has not shown an increased
risk of CJD in relation to any occupation, including farming.''
The farmer, aged 54, was admitted with a history of forgetfulness,
altered behaviour, slurring of speech, and other symptoms. There was
''relentless'' progression of the disease until he died of pneumonia six
weeks later.
Somerset dairy farmer Duncan Templeman, 65, died from CJD in 1993 and
Lancashire farmer Peter Warhurst, 61, died the previous year.

A PLAN for a discount shopping complex at a 60-acre site in West
Calder has been lodged with West Lothian District Council by local firm
Watson Stonecraft.
Backed by Humberside firm Freeport, the scheme would provide dozens of
cut-price shops for high street stores to sell discount and end-of-range
stock, complemented by leisure facilities.

KNOYDART Estate is expected to be sold on Friday, October 20.
Interested parties have been asked to prepare offers, over #1.5m, for
the 17,200-acre property by noon on that date to the selling agents,
Strutt and Parker.
Mr Andrew Rettie, in charge of the agents' Edinburgh Office, said
yesterday that 380 sets of particulars -- details of the property -- had
been sent out to potential buyers.
Inquiries have come from as far afield as Hong Kong and the United
Arab Emirates but, added Mr Rettie, most came from the UK.
The property is being sold by Knoydart Peninsula Ltd, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the troubled jute company Titaghur. The company's chairman
Reg Brealey had bought Knoydart from Surrey Property dealer Philip
Rhodes for #1.7m in March 1993.
Mr Brealey had wanted it to start an adventure training school for
disadvantaged youths but in March 1994, KPL was refused planning
permission and told to scale down the project.
In July last year, The Herald revealed that Mr Brealey -- also
chairman of Sheffield United and the first Briton to be charged with
insider dealing, only to be acquitted when the case against him
collapsed in 1991 -- had not paid for Knoydart in full.
Mr Rhodes claimed the equivalent of #240,000 was still owed and
litigation ensued. The estate was put back on the market five weeks ago.

SCOTTISH Opera yesterday dismissed as ''rumour and speculation''
reports that the company was about to lose its orchestra and go
part-time.
However, Mr Matthew Rooke, music director of the Scottish Arts
Council, declined to state categorically that the rumours were untrue.
''The proceedings are drawing to a close and it would be premature for
anyone to make any comment,'' he said.
Mr Rooke said a working party report was in the final stages of
preparation and described the rumours of its conclusions as ''a lot of
speculation and uninformed comment''.
He said there was clearly a lot of interest in the results of the
report: ''That information must be given unambiguously, straight, and
truthfully, and until the process is concluded, none of us is in a
position to do that.''
The working group has been meeting at a crucial time for Scottish
Opera, which has been facing, and attempting to address, a projected
deficit of #750,000.
While it is considered to be extremely unlikely that anything to the
material advantage of Scottish Opera will emerge from the report, The
Herald understands that there may be late developments next week before
publication, which might affect favourably the outcome for the opera
company.
It is understood that Mr Richard Jarman, general director of Scottish
Opera, will meet the general secretaries of the three trades unions,
whose members work for the opera company, at the Labour Party conference
in Brighton.
Earlier, Ms Roberta Doyle, Scottish Opera's head of marketing and
press, said the reports were no more than ''tittle tattle'', while Mr
Jarman described them as ''pure speculation, based on rumour and half
knowledge, dressed up as authority''.
Mr Jarman, through a spokesman, also reiterated that he was
''continuing to argue for the retention of a full-time, in-house, opera
orchestra''.
The rumours, which swept through the Scottish music scene yesterday
following the publication of a report in a theatre magazine, anticipate
the results of the working party report, due to be published next week.
That report, it has been claimed, will claim there is not enough money
to support three full-time independent orchestras in Scotland -- the
Royal Scottish National, Scottish Chamber, and Scottish Opera
orchestras, and that the opera orchestra can expect to be axed, with the
entire company being put on to a part-time basis.
Since May, a working group comprised of the three heads of the main
arts-council funded musical bodies -- Scottish Opera, the Royal Scottish
National Orchestra, and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra -- has held a
series of meetings, with the involvement of the Scottish Arts Council
and under the chairmanship of Sir Lewis Robertson.
The meetings have been conducted in secrecy. Their purpose was to
investigate possible avenues of collaboration between the three
organisations, given that they have been informed by the Scottish Arts
Council to expect no increase in revenue funding in the next two years.
The group's report is expected to be made public next Friday.
It has not seriously been considered that anything of benefit to the
two symphony orchestras, the RSNO and SCO, might emerge from the working
group meetings.
The two orchestras operate independently and already have several
collaborative ventures established.
Chief executives of all three musical organisations in the working
party yesterday confirmed that they have not yet seen, nor possess, a
final version of the report.

WIFE killer Susan Christie is expected to be freed from prison today.
The ex-UDR Greenfinch who cut the throat of her Army officer lover's
wife, will walk from Maghaberry prison near Lisburn, after serving
four-and-a-half years for manslaughter.
Christie, 27, attacked Mrs Penny McAllister as they walked through a
forest in County Down after her lover, Captain Duncan McAllister, told
her he wanted to end their secret nine-month affair.
The case became known as the Fatal Attraction killing.
Christie was jailed for five years when she admitted the manslaughter
on the grounds of diminished responsibility. However, there was such a
public outcry in Britain that the sentence was increased to nine years
after an appeal by the Attorney-General.
Yesterday, a spokesman for the prison service in Belfast said he was
not prepared to comment on Christie's release date.
He added: ''I understand it is soon but we do not discuss the cases of
individual prisoners.''

BRITISH rebel Eurocrat Bernard Connolly, who denounced the proposed
single currency as a confidence trick which could cause war, will be
suspended, the European Commission confirmed last night.
Until next week, he remains on unpaid leave but, on his return to his
job in Brussels, he will formally be suspended while an internal
investigation into his conduct is carried out.
Whether he will continue to lift his #80,000-a-year salary was not
made known, a commission spokesman said: ''This is an internal matter
and we have no information on that point. But we can confirm he will be
suspended.''
Mr Connolly, whose punishment was widely expected, heads a unit of the
commission responsible for economic and monetary affairs.
Last month, he published an outspoken book, The Rotten Heart of
Europe: the Dirty War for Europe's Money, in which he made a series of
startling claims, including his belief that the concept of a European
single currency was a plot by Germany and France to destabilise Europe,
in a power struggle which could ultimately end in war.
His defiant apostasy delighted Eurosceptics in Britain, who hailed his
work as the action of a hero. To most of his colleagues in the
Commission, his behaviour was that of an eccentric who was angling for a
golden handshake at a time when the Brussels bureaucracy is shedding
jobs -- on generous terms -- to make way for Eurocrats from Austria,
Sweden, and Finland, the newest member states.
* In Paris yesterday, Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European economics
commissioner, said the Commission was determined to stick to the
timetable for the single currency.

BRITISH Rail, under fire for timetable mistakes, has now incurred the
wrath of Highland Gaelic speakers for spelling errors on platform
signboards welcoming visitors to the Royal National Mod in East
Sutherland next month.
''I thought the board for Golspie looked more like Spanish than
Gaelic,'' said local organising secretary Kenny Maclean, ''because the
word ended in 'a' rather than 'idh'.'' For Ghoillspida, read
Ghoillspidh.
''They also apparently got Lairg wrong,'' said college janitor, Mr
Garry Miller, who was questioned by an official of then rail
organisation looking for a Gaelic teacher to put him right. For Lairig,
read Luirg.
Nor are the people of Helmsdale too happy because their ''Bunillidh''
starts off as ''Bun Illidh.''
''There is a great problem with these place names,'' said Mr Maclean,
''because sometimes even the local people spell them differently. But
British Rail could hardly go wrong with Rogart, locally called ''the
high parish'' in our Gaelic, because they have it close to the English,
just like Brora.''
In the end, the British Rail official consulted Gaelic adviser Mairi
Rhind, who told him the Golspie board was the only one that really
deviated from the approved version.
''I think somebody got it wrong over the phone -- and it's the only
one that really needs correcting,'' she said.

Metrically challenged? Can't tell a pound from a kilo? With the
changeover only two days away, Elizabeth Buie wends her way through the
miles -- or kilometres -- of legislation that will eventually affect
many aspects of our daily lives.
Trading standards officers have warned shoppers to be wary of sneaky
price rises.
SOME consumers' champions are warning that, from Sunday, if you give
anyone an inch they will take 1.6093km -- and charge a bit more for good
measure. October 1 is metrication day, when imperial measurements will
have to fade away from a huge range of goods.
The changes have been imposed by the European Commission, under
directive 89/617, in an attempt to bring the United Kingdom into line
with its continental neighbours. But instead of a complete overnight
change, the Government is carrying out a phased switch, with more
changes planned for the end of the century.
The essential differences from the beginning of next week are:
* All pre-packed food must be marked with metric measurements -- but
not loose food. A shopper will be able to buy a pound of sausages from a
butcher, but will have to pick up a 0.45kg pack of sausages from a
supermarket.
* Items such as carpets, lengths of curtain material, and doors will
also have to be labelled with metric measures. However, measures classed
as ''descriptive'' -- such as the quarter-pounder beefburger or the
nine-inch pizza -- can remain imperial.
* Shirt collars, shoe sizes, and dress, trouser, and jacket sizes can
also stay the same because they, too, are ''descriptive'' -- although
the Department of Trade and Industry is advising makers to put imperial
and metric measures on labels.
* The EU has agreed to let the UK keep the mile. But only beer and
lager will be able to be sold by the pint from Sunday. Pints of shandy
will be illegal because they are classed as soft drinks. So brewers are
advising pubs to keep the pint and half-pint glasses, but label them
large and small.
* The traditional pint of maggots sold to fishermen in angling shops
will have to go, and seaside stalls will no longer be able to sell pints
of whelks.
Supermarkets and large stores have been switching gradually to metric
food labels for months so the change does not come as a shock to
consumers. Many shoppers are also being offered in-store conversion
charts and metrication quides.
However, trading standards officers have warned shoppers to be wary of
sneaky price rises. Gordon Robb, metrology and safety officer at
Highland Regional Council, was one of the first trading standards
officers to uncover an apparent abuse of the switch.
A number of members of the public complained that they were being
charged the same for a 500ml carton of milk as they had been for a pint.
Investigations centred on three dairies and found that the price
reductions implemented on the changeover had ranged from zero to 10% for
a 12% reduction in quantity.
''There is nothing criminal here -- they can charge what they want.
But we are trying to highlight to the public that they should keep an
eye out,'' said Robb, adding that not since the 1970s have we had a
maximum retail price for any commodity.
It will be harder, however, to ascertain that prices of other produce
-- meat, fish, fruit, and vegetables -- are not being hiked up under the
mantle of metrication, as their prices tend to vary according to
weather, availability, and other conditions.
In Strathclyde, the regional council's metrology officer, Jim Craig,
is concentrating on publicising the changes, both to the public and to
the trade, particularly as until recently there has been very little
information available from the DTI. His department's other tasks include
ensuring that weighing machines have been converted to metric accurately
and that packaging is labelled correctly.
In reality, although fines of up to #5000 are available for
infringements of the regulations, traders will be helped through the
legislation, as far as possible, by trading standards officers. The
sanctions are likely to be used only where it is clear there has, for
instance, been flagrant, deliberate use of inaccurate weights.
''Nobody is going to be dragged off to court in the first instance. A
lot of help will be given before it gets to that,'' said Craig.
While concern for consumers' ability to make the transition has
centred on elderly shoppers, Craig insisted that his 80-year-old mother
would have no trouble whatsoever. ''Some elderly people may find they
have a problem and others will have no difficulty.
''Think about shopping attitudes and techniques, and take petrol for
instance. Although it is sold in litres, and has been for a number of
years, I do not know anyone who goes in and buys 10 or 20 litres. They
go and buy #5 or #10 worth.
''It is the same with butcher meat. A lot of people go and judge the
size of a bit of steak. People have got used to using their eyes. And
over 75% of foods are pre-packed already in metric,'' he added.
However, Deirdre Hutton, chairwoman of the Scottish Consumers'
Council, is less confident. ''Experience of changing the money system
showed there was real hay to be made by traders and businesses
generally. We need to make sure that it does not happen with
metrication. There has to be careful scrutiny.
''In general terms, however, it is really time we got on with it. We
have been talking about it for how many years? It would have been a
great deal better to have done it in a oner,'' she said.
Hutton's particular concerns over the transition is that people will
fail to calculate correctly the cooking time per weight for foodstuffs.
''We have had considerable problems with salmonella because of
under-cooking. This is precisely the kind of thing that can cause
food-poisoning outbreaks,'' she said.
Concerns are not confined to the food retail industry. Trading
standards officers in Lancashire have warned that the new metrication
rules could help unscrupulous filling station owners to operate a
''legal fiddle'' on unsuspecting motorists.
Under the new rules, stations will no longer be forced to display
charts at the pumps converting litres to gallons, a move that trading
standards officers say could leave motorists vulnerable to price rises.
Some filling stations have attracted motorists with a roadside sign
advertising a cheap price by the gallon on a ''loss leader'' fuel,
usually four-star petrol. Once inside, motorists see only the litre
price on display on the other fuels, including the popular unleaded.
Already, there are reports of motorists being charged #3.63 a gallon
(79.9p a litre) for unleaded.
A spokesman for the trading standards department said: ''Providing
they stay within the letter of the law, there is nothing we can do. The
motorist really has to start thinking of what he should be looking for
in terms of price per litre, and check it on the pump before he fills
up.
''A driver who doesn't, and usually puts a certain value -- say #20
worth -- in the tank, could be down the road before he discovers his
tank is only two-thirds full. Only a small minority of stations are
doing this, but when garages first started charging by the litre we were
finding some systematically misleading the public. I am fearful it might
happen again.''
COUNTING THE COST OF CHANGE
THE cost of the changes to industry has been conservatively estimated
at #35m. Earlier this week the Federation of Small Businesses warned
that up to 500 rural garages and hundreds of shops could be forced out
of business.
It claimed that a typical small shop would have to spend an extra
#3000 changing tills, price lists, and weighing machines, which could be
enough to make them go bust. Supermarkets will survive relatively
unscathed, probably by converting to metric right across the board.
However, small shops such as fruit and vegetable retailers may feel
constrained to operate the metric and imperial systems side by side --
metric for pre-packed bags of potatoes, for instance, and imperial for
weighing loose produce -- and may therefore have to duplicate weighing
materials.
The FSB wants the Government to remove the sanction of fines for
non-compliance, arguing that no other European Union country does so. It
also fears it may lose trade because of discontented customers who do
not understand or trust the new measures.
EU officials argue, however, that imperial measurements can be
displayed on packaging, as long as the metric measure is more prominent.

AN Edinburgh-based surveyor and valuer embarked on a campaign against
compulsory metrication a year ago when attempts were made to force his
profession to adopt metric measurements whether members liked it or not.
Vivian Linacre says he had a ''Eureka-like experience in the bath at
2am'' and decided to found the Imperial Measurement Preservation
Society. IMPS, he says, has ''subliminal connotations'' because it
sounds ''impish'' and because the society itself is imperial.
However, its aims are very serious. So serious, in fact, that IMPS
plans to take the Government to the European Court of Human Rights on
the basis of discrimination.
Today, Linacre plans to launch a campaign of ''massive, passive public
resistance'' to the Government's metrication legislation. He deplores,
in the strongest terms, the ''totally unjustified, iniquitous,
compulsory metrication and criminalisation of imperial measures'',
arguing that everyone should be free to choose which form of measurement
they want.
Linacre plans to ignore the metrication regulations and instead to
exercise choice. In the past month he has received sackfuls of letters,
100% supportive of his stance.
''I have not found anyone yet in favour of compulsory metrication. It
happens to have struck a national chord. I have certainly provided a
rallying point,'' he said.
Linacre adopts a somewhat superior stance to the campaign being run by
the Federation of Small Businesses, who are asking simply for more time.
But his main fire is reserved for the Government.
''What does it care about small business? This is the Government
committed to consumer choice, deregulation, and competition, yet it
wants to criminalise imperial measurements.''
He blames ''those supine politicians'' who are complying with EC
directives. ''Strasbourg and Brussels can't stand us having our far
superior system of weights and measures. Not just the United States, but
also other tiger economies such as Singapore, Dubai, and Kuwait are
still imperial.''
Linacre's fear is that other countries will step in and pick up
Britain's export market in imperially-measured goods. '''Remember the
poll tax? That was civil disobedience, and I am not advocating that.
''But its opponents compelled the Government to repeal the tax, while
I am predicting that this legislation will have to be repealed as a
result of massive public resistance. They can't lock us all up.''
LINACRE also believes that trading standards officers will be loath to
enforce the regulations and fine traders, for instance, for not
displaying metric measurements. ''This is supposed to be the party of
law and order, but it is deliberately enacting legislation that it has
no intention of enforcing,'' he said.
Given that Metrication Day is the result of EU legislation, it comes
as no surprise that arch Euro-sceptic Sir Teddy Taylor is another
opponent of the legislation. He can see no benefit to anyone from the
regulations, but what upsets him most ''as a democrat'' is that the
issue was not considered in the Commons by MPs.
''Three draft orders were considered by a standing committee for 21
minutes only,'' he said. Sir Teddy claims the committee was told that
because the orders were the result of a Euro-directive passed some years
ago, there was nothing the committee could do.
The legislation should have been enacted by January 1, but Britain was
allowed to delay implementation. The end result is that the Commons has
no remit to debate the issue.

A LOCAL enterprise company yesterday claimed that a BT development in
Thurso had produced almost three times the number of jobs originally
budgeted for, in response to an attack by a confirmed critic that its
job creation forecasts could be ''misleading''.
Mr Bob Ballantine, chief executive of Caithness and Sutherland
Enterprise (Case), reported at Golspie that in 1994-95 it had assisted
166 projects, forecast to create or retain 530 jobs at an average cost
to itself of #3500.
However, Councillor John Young, chairman of Caithness District Council
is highly sceptical of its claim to have created more than 1500 jobs
since 1991. Mr Young regularly has claimed that the company has never
properly explained how it spent a #9m Government financial offset to the
run-down of jobs at Dounreay.
At the opening of Case's new offices in Golspie, where four staff are
now employed, Mr Ballantine said: ''The job figures refer to a total
projection over a period of something like three to five years,
depending on the nature of the businesses. Obviously, these jobs would
normally be taken on the basis of how the company developed.''
He said that sometimes the number of jobs created were higher than
earlier projected, while others were lower. They had to rely on, then
monitor, the company's projection when it applied for financial
assistance.
Mr Ballantine confirmed that at BT's research centre in Thurso, there
were now more than 90 jobs, when the initial projection was around 35.
Mr Jack Watson, the enterprise company's chairman, added: ''At British
Telecom, we had far more jobs created than we had the right to expect
when its project began.''
Offering a ''last word on the subject'' statement, on the additional
#9m made available to help counter the Dounreay run-down, Mr Watson
said: ''We would reiterate that no project has been turned down due to
lack of funding.
''It serves no useful purpose, therefore, to consider Case as having
two budgets, one of #9m and the other of the normal formula share --
rather one enhanced budget, from which every project the Lec assists
could be said to benefit.''

CAT food manufacturers hoping to make the Downing Street pet Humphrey
an advertising star were yesterday given a ''hands off'' warning.
The firms had been keen to feature Humphrey in advertising campaigns
following his return home in a blaze of publicity. They have been told
that Civil Service rules prevent such a role.
A spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office insisted: ''Humphrey is a civil
servant. He is employed by the Cabinet Office as our official mouser.
''As a civil servant, it would be against the terms of his contract to
take part in any advertising campaigns. The rule applies to all
Government employees, including Ministers.''
Humphrey had been wooed by Pedigree, the makers of Katkins, Kitekat,
and Whiskas, following his return to No 10 after disappearing almost
three months earlier.
Other agencies and firms had been looking at ways of marketing
Humphrey.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, President Clinton's cat
Socks, who has inspired stuffed toys and his own line of clothing, sent
Humphrey a welcome home message.
Faxed by White House staff, the message read: ''I wish to congratulate
Humphrey on his safe return to 10 Downing Street.
''While fears of his catnapping troubled me deeply, I never lost faith
that he would eventually return home. I know that all of the pets in the
United States join me in extending our best wishes to Humphrey and to
the Major family on this happy day.''

CAITHNESS and Sutherland MP Robert Maclennan will flag off the first
Far North Line train for 15 years from Inverness to Wick this afternoon.
The train will be carrying 230 tonnes of coal and 100 tonnes of steel.
The coal is for British Fuel for distribution in Caithness and the steel
is for use in the manufacture of ''white goods'' at Norfrost's factory
at Castleton on the north coast.
Both cargoes would have been transported by road previously but were
attracted to rail by Transrail, the UK's biggest rail freight operator.
Transrail, which is still a British Railways subsidiary but is due to
be privatised some time in 1995/96, currently transports around 30
million tonnes of freight a year throughout the UK. In Scotland, the
company transports four million tonnes.
It now hopes to establish a regular service in the north and will
offer to carry consignments as small as 25 tonnes to and from the
North-west of England, the Midlands, the South-east, and Wales.
The company's business manager, Mr John Holwell, said yesterday: ''We
have been working hard for several months to secure business on the Far
North Line.
''Working with Railtrack, we have achieved this by offering our
customers a viable transport alternative to road.''

A SCOTTISH Office Minister was accused last night of presiding over a
public relations fiasco after launching an initiative designed to free
teachers from administrative activities.
The initiative commended by Mr Raymond Robertson, the Education
Minister, was entitled Towards Effective Planning. However, the EIS said
the Minister, himself a former teacher, had a lot to learn about
planning public announcements and the provision of effective education.
Mr Robertson had eschewed Edinburgh and chosen the rather unusual
setting of Ladeside Primary School in Larbert to launch a staff
development pack which responds to teachers' workload concerns by giving
guidance on how to free more time which is currently tied up with
administrative activities.
He had also failed to do the EIS the courtesy of giving them an
advance copy so that they could plan their response.
Mr Fred Forrester, EIS depute general secretary, said: ''This is a
very unsatisfactory way to go about business. The whole thing is a pure
Raymond Robertson profile-building exercise and a PR fiasco.
''This is the first time in my experience that a document has been
launched in this way. It is unprecedented for it to be launched by a
Minister in a small town. It is most discourteous. I would recommend
that Mr Robertson does not repeat this.
''Advance copies of documents give us a chance to comment on them.''
Speaking at Larbert yesterday, Mr Robertson said: ''Planning is an
essential part of effective teaching. Yet it can all too easily become a
burden, supplanting the very classroom teaching it is meant to support.
''The pack provides valuable guidance of a practical nature, offering
examples which teachers can use as models for adoption or adaptation. I
commend it to teachers, in the confidence that it will provide stimulus
and support, helping them put manageable and realistic planning formats
into operation.
''The pack should also enable teachers to enhance their status by
ensuring that their professional skills are used to best effect and are
not having to be directed at administrative tasks.''
''We want all schools to make the most of the opportunities for higher
standards that are the strength of 5-14. I hope that the outcome of
today's launch will be less worry about the workload that planning might
entail and more confidence that teaching will be enhanced by planning
that stays firmly within the teachers' control.''
However, Mr Forrester was distinctly unimpressed. He said: ''I'm very
suspicious about the general proposition being put forward.
''The Government is getting curricular development on the cheap. It is
not giving us extra teachers or money or resources but a document which
is supposed to help us reorganise our week. Teachers will find this
patronising and insulting.''
* Towards Effective Planning has been produced by the Scottish Office
education department in collaboration with the Scottish Consultative
Council on the Curriculum and with the co-operation of Borders,
Highland, Lothian, Orkney, Strathclyde, and Tayside education
authorities.
The pack supplements the general advice on aspects of long and
short-term planning which featured in the 5-14: A Practical Guide and
provides additional guidance for teachers on personal planning.

MILITANT leader Tommy Sheridan yesterday ignored warnings and publicly
named the Labour councillor at the centre of a fraud squad probe.
During a stormy debate at Glasgow District Council's full monthly
meeting, he dared the city's ruling Labour group to take legal action
over his claims and his disclosures.
Again he accused the Labour ranks of ''being involved in deliberate
delays as part of an attempted cover up''.
Last year, militant Councillor Chic Stevenson first raised questions
about the financial running of Cranhill Community Council. His pressure
eventually led the city council in January to order an investigation.
Yesterday, Councillor Sheridan stressed that it was only after seven
months -- and significantly after the spring elections -- that the
results from the audit team were made public.
About #20,000 of public money, said Councillor Sheridan, seemed to be
involved from the little information made available to councillors. He
accused Labour of deliberate delay and said he would not be silenced by
threats of legal restrictions.
''A member of the newly elected unitary authority is at the centre of
the allegations which are now the subject of the police investigation,''
he said.
Ignoring gasps and murmurs from the council benches, Councillor
Sheridan proceeded to name the councillor. He reminded the meeting that,
despite the allegations, the person had been appointed, with the support
of Labour colleagues, to be a member of the new council's finance
committee.
Councillor Sheridan urged Labour to support his motion to fully
participate in the proposed Scottish Office corruption task force and
''to investigate any legitimate allegations against councillors,
officers, and employees''.
Councillor Gordon Macdiarmid, the Labour depute leader, reacted
angrily to the attack -- and warned Councillor Sheridan that he had
already made a number of statements during the debate which the Labour
administration ''would be quite willing to pursue in law''.
Labour used its majority to push through an amendment which simply
stated: ''This council abhors corruption.''

PRIVATE detectives employed by Edinburgh District Council could soon
be giving evidence in court against anti-social tenants.
The council's housing committee is expected to approve a pilot scheme
next week to use professional witnesses to help combat cases of extreme
anti-social behaviour.
Special investigators or housing officers employed by the council
would gather evidence by observation and corroboration.
Using professionals in this way means that tenants who fear reprisals
from anti-social neighbours would not have to appear as witnesses in
court.
The council stressed yesterday that the special investigators would be
used only in extreme cases.
Only two other councils, Motherwell and Sunderland, already use
private investigators as professional witnesses against anti-social
tenants.
Labour housing convener Mary Mulligan said: ''The best and most
convincing witness will always be the tenant who is involved and has
suffered the threats and harassment. But the use of professional
witnesses would allow the housing department to nip extreme behaviour in
the bud and will signal that we are determined to stamp out anti-social
behaviour.''

SENIOR management of Scotland's first, and most controversial NHS
Trust, yesterday refused to discuss the circumstances surrounding their
financial difficulties and the resignation of the financial director.
However, Dr Kim Walker, chief officer of watchdog organisation
Grampian Local Health Council, expressed serious concern at the
revelation that the trust faces a deficit of #1.75m this year although
just two months ago they insisted they had no financial crisis.
''I would hope they were not purposely deceiving us, and I genuinely
don't think they were,'' she said, ''in which case it is possibly even
worse because they didn't realise how serious it was.''
She said she was also confused at the circumstances surrounding the
resignation of the financial director and what his role in the current
financial situation was. She will contact the trust to try to clarify
this.
Aberdeen MP Bob Hughes yesterday wrote to Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth demanding a full investigation. He said it was not acceptable
for the trust to retreat behind a wall of silence on the grounds of
confidentiality.
''It is essential that the public know what has happened, how the
situation is to be retrieved, that public assurances are given that the
situation will not recur and that patient care will be safeguarded,'' he
said.
He also asked for information on why the director of finance's role
had been restricted which, according to a statement issued by the trust,
was why he had resigned six days prior to the revelation of the
financial mess.
The crisis has prompted the NHS chief executive in Scotland, Mr Geoff
Scaife, to tell the trust's board to have an externally validated rescue
plan in his hands by tomorrow.
The letter, which the trust refuses to comment on, was posted on
August 3 with another letter from Mr Paul Wilson, the director of the
NHS Trusts in Scotland.
In it, Mr Scaife questions the future of finance director Douglas
Lindsay by writing: ''I expect the trust board will be considering
whether the director of finance has their confidence and if not, what
action is intended to be taken.''
Yesterday a spokeswoman said that Mr Lindsay, whose resignation will
not take effect for six months, was not available for comment.
Chief executive Alex Cumming and other senior officials were
unavailable for comment.
The Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust was embroiled in controversy even
before it was established.
There was an unprecedented public outcry when it was announced the
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, the People's Hospital built with public
subscriptions, was applying to opt out to NHS Trust status.
The Scottish Secretary Ian Lang announced approval in 1991 and it
achieved trust status in 1992. That did not end the controversy.
In January this year, Mr Hughes demanded an inquiry when it was
revealed that the Trust was heading for a deficit of around #1m for the
year ending in March 1995.
In August, stories arose again of a cash crisis and it emerged that
the trust was three months late in signing agreements with its two major
purchasers, Grampian Health Board and the GP fundholders, but a trust
spokesman said there was no cash crisis.
The agreements, although apparently now virtually complete, have still
not been signed.
Earlier this month, at the trust's annual meeting, it was revealed
that it was only after it received emergency funding that it managed to
meet its financial targets for 1994/95 and at that point Mr Cumming
conceded there were problems.
A spokesman for the NHS in Scotland said: ''We must keep the Aberdeen
problems in perspective. Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust has an income of
some #120m a year and the current anticipated deficit is less than 1.5%
of its income. The trust is currently examining what measures it can
take to balance its books and the NHS management executive is in close
touch with the trust in monitoring the situation and offering advice.
''The management executive is confident that despite the trust's
present financial difficulties the standard and volume of patient care
will not be affected.''

SCOTTISH Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton yesterday
promised a review of large pay rises for NHS executives.
Lord James said Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth had made his
displeasure patently clear in the wake of the 33% increase for Mr Jeremy
Taylor, chief executive of Grampian Healthcare, which takes his salary
to #101,000 a year.
''We shall be looking closely at the rules relating to pay and
performance and will be expecting sensitivity and restraint allied with
a ready measure against improvements in patient care,'' the Minister
said.
Lord James also poured scorn on critics of the NHS in the wake of
financial crises at two trusts, Highland Communities and Aberdeen Royal
Hospitals.
He said these difficulties related to about 1% to 3% of their total
income and they would be resolved, although he made no promise of
central funding. A Scottish Office spokesman said the management
executive was assisting the trusts but was awaiting their financial
recovery packages.
''So why are the 'Jeremiahs' persisting with the doom and gloom
perception of the NHS? For political reasons, I am afraid to say,'' Lord
James claimed.
He said Grampian Healthcare had spent #7m last year providing a
variety of services, including new psychiatric facilities, more wards at
Woodend hospital, and a #300,000 hydro-therapy pool for children with
special needs. However, all the media attention was on the chief
executive's pay.
''The NHS reforms have set out to delegate to local level the
decision-making about what the local population required. This has
enabled us to achieve a 5% increase in patients treated in each of the
last few years and into the foreseeable future,'' he said.
''So let us get the view of the NHS into some perspective. Let us just
consider the achievements delivered by the staff of the NHS under the
reforms. Let us stop giving the message to the NHS that it is in 'chaos'
or 'crisis'. The NHS deserves roses for its effective and better
delivery of services, not the raspberries its detractors would want us
to give,'' Lord James added.
However, the Minister's statement found little favour among health
unions and Opposition politicians. Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson said the remarks would prove to be no more than a public
relations exercise unless they were backed up by concrete proposals.
Mr Robertson said:''The problem is that the trusts are simply out of
control. Ministers seem to be almost impotent to make the creature they
have created behave in a responsible way. The Secretary of State is now
coming face to face with the consequences of his own ideology.
''It is all very well expressing irritation and anger but are they
willing to take tough action? They are embarrassed and this is a panic
response.''
Mr Robertson said the NHS in Scotland was facing a crisis. He added
that a Labour Government would exercise more control over trusts by
bringing them back into the NHS.
Ms June Andrews, Scottish secretary of the Royal College of Nursing,
said: ''What is a nurse earning #15,000 a year and working unpaid
overtime to make of a manager earning an increase of #25,000?
''The purpose of the NHS is not to make a profit, nor to provide
interesting and challenging jobs for managers. What everyone wants for
the NHS is sustained morale and output. In refusing our demand for a 3%
rise without strings, they have not even agreed to support that.''
Mrs Patricia Dawson, director of the Scottish Association of Health
Councils (the public's watchdogs), said she was astonished that one
trust in Aberdeen was facing such a deep crisis and another was able to
give its chief executive a 33% rise.
''We are very disturbed by this. This increase would fund two health
councils for a year,'' she said.
* Nurses and care workers have begun moves to try to oust their
managers because of a financial crisis at the Highland Communities NHS
Trust.
The 2500 staff are to be balloted in a ''no confidence'' vote in the
trust, it was revealed yesterday.
This follows the announcement on Tuesday of the closure of a geriatric
ward at Inverness's Royal Northern Infirmary.

NURSES and care workers have begun moves to try to oust members of a
cash-strapped NHS Trust.
More than 2000 staff at the Highland Communities NHS Trust are to be
balloted in a ''no confidence'' vote in the body, it was revealed
yesterday.
This follows the announcement on Tuesday of the closure of a geriatric
ward at Inverness's Royal Northern Infirmary. Up to 45 nurses and care
workers at the hospital will lose their jobs before the end of the year.
The trust announced earlier this month that it was to save #260,000 by
closing another elderly-care ward at the County Hospital in Invergordon,
Easter Ross.
The cuts are part of a cost-saving drive after the trust failed to
claim #1m from the Highland Health Board. An investigation has also
revealed that #800,000 is needed to balance the books.
Alison Craig, the secretary of the Joint Staff Consultative Committee
which represents all the trust's unions and professional organisations,
said: ''The board must be accountable for this terrible mess. They
should not be forcing staff to take the brunt of the consequences of
their actions. Patient care is quite evidently going to be adversely
affected by these cuts and they have to be stopped.''

Has Government meddling dealt a fatal blow to the NHS. . .
THE SCOTTISH Office insists it is a minor localised ailment, but
others suggest the NHS is suffering a chronic and potentially terminal
illness caused by Goverment meddling.
The first series of annual reports from NHS trusts have produced a
mixed bag, big deficits in Aberdeen and Inverness and others balancing
the books or making a surplus.
Dr Brian Potter, Scottish Secretary of the British Medical
Association, said: ''Unfortunately this is what we predicted. It is what
happens if you introduce the market philosophy into the NHS.
''We do not have a bottom line. If you apply the sort of standard
measures that you would use in Marks and Spencer for selling cakes and
ladies knickers, to human unhappiness and human disease, you are bound
to make a mess of it.
''The trusts who have been goody goody in terms of their accounts and
have instituted all their savings are still being penalised.''
There is at least agreement on one matter between Health Minister Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton and the critics he labels as prophets of gloom:
you can not judge the health of the NHS by balance sheet.
Dundee Teaching Hospitals reported a #990,000 surplus for the last
financial year, but earlier this week the trust's medical director, Dr
Derek Maclean, revealed a scarcity of resources had led to the deaths of
up to 30 Tayside heart patients over a number of years, placed
intolerable pressure on intensive care beds, and hampered the delivery
of care to seriously ill cancer and kidney patients.
A trust spokesman said: ''These are not new problems. They were
ongoing problems which existed long before the trust.''
Law Hospital Trust, which earlier this year warned patients to stay
away from its casualty knit because of a staffing crisis, yesterday
announced a health profit of #2.2m.
The trust said the staffing problem had been due to a national
shortage of junior doctors and it was requirement on all trusts to
achieve a surplus of 6% over a three-year period. The money would be
used to develop services.
The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh which launched its report at its
first annual general meeting yesterday, recorded a #2.8mn retained
surplus.
Chief executive Joe Owens said it was the aim of all Scottish trusts
to break even: ''It is a sign of good management when the NHS is able to
work within the guidelines. The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, as with
all the other trusts, face exactly the same challenges and cost saving
targets. We are all trying to deliver the best value for money and be as
cost effective as we can with public sector money.''
He said he could not forsee the situation where services would be cut
within the trust.
''If you do that, you cut back on your funding and you lose income
from the health board. That is cutting your nose off to spite your face
and is not a positive way of managing the situation.''
The Scottish Office is now caught in a cleft stick of its own design.
It set up the first trusts in 1993 and gave but power to sink as well as
swim, as the Aberdeen flagship has shown.
Lord James said the problems at Aberdeen and at Highland Communities
NHS trust would be resolved, but he did not say how.
The Scottish NHS management executive is working with both on
financial recovery programmes. It would not say yesterday if this would
mean baling out by the centre, which in itself would amount to an
admission of defeat of the whole trust philosophy.
It is precisely this confusion over who actually pulls the strings of
the new NHS that has dogged the pay dispute with nurses and other health
workers. The management executive says it is up to trusts to decide, the
trusts ask for clear guidance which is not forthcoming and Ministers
stand at a distance shrugging their shoulders and saying the money is
there.
This also applies to levels of pay for managers and hefty increases
including the #25,000 rise for Jeremy Taylor at Grampian HealthCare. The
management executive says it is up to trusts to determine managers' pay,
but the whole enhanced pay and performance tables enabling some to to
earn over #100,000, were devised by the executive with a clear steer
that trusts should follow them, or else.
Problems over funding the NHS in Scotland are not new. For two decades
there was clear priorities from the centre for health boards to shift
resources to Cinderella services like mental health. It certainly never
worked as intended.
Five years ago Lothian Health Board was baled out of a financial
disaster by the newly-created management exectutive.
What the internal market and the trusts have done is make the whole
financial process more explicit.
June Andrews, Scottish secretary of the Royal College of Nursing and
herself a former NHS manager, is not alone in arguing that those who
turned on the fan cannot moan when the solids start flying.
''What every single citizen in Scotland knows is that their local
health care is a lottery. It is a lottery dependent of the honesty and
financial acumen of largely unregulated people who are prepared to pay
themselves fortunes, when everyone else suffers,'' she said.
Part of the increased patient throughput in NHS is due to day case
keyhole surgery, pioneered in Dundee by Professor Alfred Cuschieri, who
yesterday made a plea for more resources to end the crisis at his own
hospital, Ninewells.
Lord James may have a reasonable case in arguing that the achievements
of the NHS go largely unreported. However, in marshalling statistics and
facts in support of this, he also needs to be sure he is accurate in his
selections.
''In 1991 Scotland had no magnetic resonance image scanners which have
proved to be life saving the early detection of cancer,'' he said,
recalling the purchase of MRI machines by his predecessor Michael
Forsyth.
Nothing could be further removed from the truth. Not only did Scotland
have at least three MRI machines, although hardly state of the art at
that time, but the world's first MRI service was actually launched here
in 1980.
Ironically, it was in the very hospital at the centre of the latest
furore -- Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.

Moscow,
HOME of the Kremlin. The Big Potato. Now Moscow can claim a new title,
according to a top government official, ''most flashing capital of the
world''.
That's not the dirty mac brigade, but flashing as in blue lights atop
thousands of cars.
Russian deputy Interior Minister Alexander Kulikov told a government
meeting today that, in addition to those on police cars and ambulances,
some 2500 cars in the capital have blue lights on top.
And that does not include the illegal ones that anyone can purchase at
a corner kiosk for about #40 and plug into their car cigarette lighter,
to beat traffic lights or overtake.
''The analysis of the situation shows that Moscow has become the most
flashing capital of the world,'' Kulikov said.
About 800 of the lights, he added, belong to businesses. One private
bank has nearly 100 armoured vans equipped with the lights, but the
Defence Ministry has only 57.
Blue lights are supposed to be doled out by government permit, and
private businessmen are not supposed to use the lights at all. But fines
for getting caught are small, and the Russian system is infamous for
running on bribes.
First deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets responded to the report by
ordering that the issuing of blue-light permits be restricted.-- AP.

Paris
FORMER Algerian interior minister Aboubaker Belkaid, a leading foe of
Muslim militants, was shot dead today in Algiers, the Algerian news
agency said.
Belkaid, who was interior minister in the year after youth unrest
erupted in October 1988, was shot dead in Port Said square in central
Algiers, APS said, quoting a security official.
Belkaid, 61, was the third top ranking former or serving official to
be killed in Algeria's nearly four years of violence which has pitted
government forces against Muslim guerrillas.
Although he last served in the government in 1992, he was viewed as a
leading behind-the-scenes political power opposing the militants.
There was no immediate claim or responsibility, but Muslim militants
trying to establish an Islamic state in Algeria have routinely targetted
past and present government officials.
His killing climaxed a fresh campaign of violence by militants since
last July when government talks with top jailed fundamentalist leaders
failed.
The fighting has killed around 40,000 people since the civil strife
erupted after the government annulled elections which Muslim militants
were poised to win.
Belkaid served as Minister of Culture and Communications in 1992 in
the cabinet of former president Mohamed Boudiaf, who was assassinated in
June 1992 by an officer of the Algerian security forces.
Kasdi Merbah, who was prime minister in 1988-1989 when Belkaid was
interior minister, was killed along with his brother, driver and
bodyguard, in August 1993 near Algiers.
Meanwhile, five people were killed and 11 wounded when a bomb exploded
yesterday under a locomotive sent to recover previously sabotaged
carriages near Algiers, an Algerian newspaper said today.--Reuter.

Brussels
RUSSIA remains opposed to Nato's plans to extend its security umbrella
up to the country's western borders, according to its ambassador to
Brussels, Mr Vitaly Churkin.
''What we have seen so far is not enough for us to change our minds
about the prospects of Nato enlargement. Feelings are very strong about
this in Russia,'' Mr Churkin said today as he left a meeting between
Nato and more than 20 members of the alliance's Partnership for Peace
programme.
Nato presented its enlargement plan, which extends the nuclear
umbrella eastwards and reserves the right to position troops and weapons
in the region if necessary, to the partners.
Mr Churkin told reporters that Russia was firmly against the move.
''The matter has not been thought through in the context of overall
European security,'' he added.
Earlier, alliance Secretary General Willy Claes tried to smooth
ruffled Russian feathers by saying Nato would remain a defensive
military alliance, and threaten no one when it takes in new members from
former communist east Europe.
Mr Claes said Nato enlargement would be a parallel process and would
complement the planned enlargement of the European Union. He repeated
Nato's assertion that alliance expansion would underpin the new
democracies of eastern and central Europe.
Countries interested in joining the alliance, led by Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, and the Baltic states, will follow up the meeting
with more detailed discussions with Nato officials in their respective
capitals.
In an apparent concession to Moscow, the enlargement plan stresses
that extension of the nuclear umbrella will not happen automatically,
but re-affirms the nuclear doctrine as the ''supreme
guarantee''.--Reuter.

Lyons
HUNDREDS of French police, backed by dogs and a helicopter, surrounded
a wooded area near this central French city in a hunt for a fugitive
they believe is linked to a series of bombings.
Police said the fugitive had been identified as Khaled Kelkal, an
Algerian-born petty criminal whose fingerprints were found last month on
a bomb which failed to explode beside a rail line north of Lyon.
Nearly 800 police and paratrooper sealed off a 150 sq mile area around
Vaugneray, where the man had escaped yesterday after a gunbattle with
police.
Police identified their suspect, France's most wanted man, from
fingerprints at the scene and from comments made by men who were
arrested in the woods yesterday.
All three of the arrested men, like Kelkal, lived a poor Lyons suburb,
and one of them was believed to be related to the 24-year-old Algerian.
Investigators suspect Moslem fundamentalists are responsible for six
bombs planted in Paris and around Lyons since July that have killed
seven people and wounded more than 130.
Investigators are confident that their operation to catch Kelkal will
succeed. ''Even though the terrain is very wooded the fugitive would
appear to have little chance of slipping through the net,'' one said.
The drama began yesterday when police approached two men who had been
seen sleeping in the woods.
Asked to produce identity papers, one of the men pulled out a sawn-off
shotgun and started shooting. The gendarmes returned fire, seriously
wounding him.
A search turned up an alarm clock which could have been used as a

Vienna,
SAMMAN Rassoul is terrified to return to herding his father's cows in
northern Iraq.
The 12-year-old Kurdish boy was operated on in February to extract
metal from his stomach and to reset a broken leg after suffering
life-threatening injuries when a cow he was tending stepped on a hidden
land mine.
''I can remember everything . . . If my father asked me to go back
there with the animals, I would refuse. It would make me remember what
happened to me,'' the boy told relief workers.
The case was highlighted today by the International Save the Children
Alliance (ISCA) at a Vienna conference aimed at limiting the
indiscrimate destruction caused by mines.
''Children are killed and maimed by the thousands each year by this
repulsive weapon,'' ISCA representative Carl von Essen told delegates.
Children make up most of the 20,000 civilians who are blown up or
injured in land mine explosions every year in regions where conflicts
have long come to an end.
The fourth day of the conference was reserved for relief groups, human
rights activists, and charities, who made a impassioned plea for a total
ban on ''hidden killers'' to delegates of 49 nations reviewing a 1980
convention on indiscriminate weapons.
The United States and other Western countries have argued that a total
ban is unrealistic at the present time and want the conference to agree
on tougher limits on mine use.
Relief workers deal daily with the carnage created by mine blasts and
have also become victims.
On the conference floor, Nicoletta Dentico of the Italian Campaign to
Ban Land Mines demanded a new requirement in the convention to force
mine producers to pay for mine clearance.
''It is obscene that firms responsible for the dissemination of mines
are contracted by the United Nations to carry out clearing . . .
ensuring them double profits,'' she said.
Speakers representing organisations for the blind also urged the
conference to back a total ban on laser weapons.
''Eye doctors call it a perversion of thought when the fantastic
opportunity to heal people by using modern laser techniques is reversed
to purposely destroy sight,'' said Herbert Hassold of the German-based
Christoffel-Blindenmission. -- Reuter.

Moroni, Comoros
AN AGEING French mercenary driven from power six years ago staged a
coup and took the president hostage today in the Comoros Islands.
The mercenaries launched a fierce attack on the main police station
after taking the airport and recapturing the country's radio station, a
witness said.
Sultan Chouzour, a former ambassador to France, said the police were
resisting but that the mercenaries led by soldier of fortune Bob Denard
appeared to have the upper hand and were aiming to take over the Indian
Ocean islands.
''There is resistance, but we are told the group is better armed than
our forces,'' he said.
He appealed for France, the former colonial power, to intervene.
Tonight France condemned the coup and placed its armed forces in the
Indian Ocean on alert.
Chouzour said the garrison at the airport had been overrun and there
were heavy casualties on both sides. Several civilians were also
reported killed.
In Paris, visiting Comorian Interior Minister Ali Mohammed Allaoui
said the mercenaries had taken many arms, particularly rocket launchers
and mortars, from the main army compound.
Chouzour said President Said Mohamed Djohar, held hostage by Denard,
was alive and negotiating with the mercenaries. Chouzour speculated that
they maybe trying to make him hand over power.
Denard, 66, is a former head of the Comoros presidential guard who at
one point virtually ran the island state. He is also a veteran freelance
soldier in wars across Africa.
No-one knows the strength of the mercenary force, which is believed to
have arrived in Comoros a few days ago.
The Prime Minister and ministers loyal to the president had taken
refuge at the French Embassy. Television, radio, and air communications
were cut.
This is the fourth time Denard and his ''dogs of war'' have caused
trouble in the islands. In 1975, after Comoros became independent from
France, he helped overthrow the country's leader, then three years later
restored him in a mercenary invasion.
Six years ago the same leader was killed in mysterious circumstances
and French troops forced Denard to flee to South Africa after he seized
control of the main island of Gran Comoro.
In Cairo the Arab League said it backed the Comoros Government and
called for international action to restore order.
The Comoros, volcanic islands between the east African coast and
north-west Madagascar, declared independence from France in 1975 and is
a federal Islamic republic.--Reuter/AP.

reporters that he had no information linking Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez to the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups (GAL), which killed 27

A BRIGHTON football fan will be making a 1226 mile round trip to
Inverness to cheer on Caledonian Thistle tomorrow.
Mr Roy Wright, 49, a postman, makes the journey for every big match
and is looking forward to the local derby atmosphere when Caley Thistle
take on rivals Ross County.
Mr Aitken began supporting the former Highland League club Caledonian
in 1980 -- long before the merger with Inverness Thistle took them into
the Scottish League spotlight.
He said: ''My love affair with the club came about totally by
accident. I went to a travel agents to book a holiday and they suggested
a coach tour of the Highlands.
''I was being driven through Inverness when I saw Caley playing at
Telford Street Park. I thought: 'That's interesting. They look like a
big club.' I always knew they were a sleeping giant and they are
starting to prove me right.
''My mates think I'm crazy, but I think, secretly, they keep an eye
out for the club as well!''
Mr Aitken, who lives in Portslade, six miles from Brighton, buys a
Caley Thistle season ticket even though he cannot make all the games.
He added: ''I get the local papers sent down from Inverness to keep
track of what is happening. But I much prefer to be up there to catch
the action.
''It might sound strange, given that I was brought up down south, but
Caley Thistle is in my blood now.
''They had a great win last weekend and the Ross County match is a big
one I couldn't miss.''

Kuala Lumpur
A MALAYSIAN policeman armed with two rifles and a revolver killed a
child and an elderly man, and wounded at least nine others today before
being shot dead, police said.
The gunman, carrying two M-16 rifles and a pistol, began his shooting
spree in the northern town of Slim River, where he wounded two
policemen.
He then drove to the state capital Ipoh and shot dead a 58-year-old
man, a seven-year-old boy, and wounded at least seven others in a
10-hour wave of terror, police said.
The 39-year-old father of four was finally shot dead by police after
he opened fire on the house of an MP.
Police said tonight they were retracing the gunman's path of carnage
and that the casualty toll could rise.
A spokesman said the policeman had collected an M-16 rifle and a
revolver on Tuesday to escort eight drug addicts to Kuala Lumpur, along
with three other policemen.
Before dawn today, he called the Slim River police station to say his
car had broken down. When two policemen went to his aid he opened fire.

<TEXT>
PARENTS of pupils at a Highland school met last night to discuss the
suspension of five girls for allegedly taking drugs in a classroom.
The chairman of Plockton High School board, Mr Bob Anderson, believed
parents would rally in support of the action taken by headmaster Mr
Duncan Ferguson.
The fifth-form girls, all aged 16, were suspended this week from the
310-pupil school following allegations of drug taking in the classroom.
They have not been named.
Mr Anderson said: ''I have nothing but backing for the headmaster's
approach to this problem. It has been tackled in the appropriate manner
and I believe all parents will supports his actions.''
The school board met last night. He said it was unlikely the incident
would lead to parents withdrawing their children from the school.
''There are other schools in the area that have a similar problem.''
This sentiment was backed by Highland Regional Council's education
chairwoman Val MacIver. She was not shocked at the revelations in
Plockton and claimed it was a widespread problem in all Highland
schools.
''Pupils at Plockton are no different from those in any other school
in the Highlands, or indeed in any other school in Scotland,'' she said.
''They face the same pressures of growing up and, despite the best
advice from parents, teachers, and the police, children will be children
and will wish to experiment.''
She said Plockton was an excellent school and commended the headmaster
for bringing this incident to the attention of the local community.
''I hope we can derive some good from it by increasing the awareness
of pupils and parents of the dangers of experimenting with drugs,'' she
said.
Mr Ferguson said Plockton was such a close-knit community it would be
impossible to keep the incident secret.
''Although it is potentially embarrassing, we felt it was the right
thing to publicly confirm it and to notify other parents.''
The incident was discovered when one girl took ill in class. Another
is understood to have confessed to giving her cannabis.
Mr Ferguson said: ''These students will not be re-admitted to the
school until we are convinced that they will not engage in such
activities again.''
Police have confirmed they are investigating the allegations of drugs
misuse at the school.

SCOTTISH electricity consumers will not receive rebates of up to #50
being promised to about 21 million consumers south of the Border
following the privatisation of the National Grid.
Industry bosses in Scotland claim Scots will not lose out because they
have already benefited through lower bills compared to customers south
of the Border.
The National Grid owns the vast network of pylons and underground
cables which carry power from generating stations to the regional
electricity companies in England and Wales.
It was set up in 1990 when the electricity industry was privatised but
the Government rejected the option of floating it separately. Since
then, its value has soared from an estimated #1000m to more than #3000m.
In Scotland, the grid is owned by ScottishPower and Scottish
Hydro-Electric. There are no plans to privatise it.
A Scottish Office spokesman said yesterday that the taxpayer had
obtained ''full value'' from the Scottish transmission assets when the
Scottish industry was privatised in 1990.
A spokeswoman for Hydro-Electric, which has about 800,000 domestic
customers, said: ''The two Scottish electricity companies have always
offered very good value for money to their customers. We have managed to
keep our prices amongst the lowest in the UK. That is down to our
companies being much leaner than those south of the Border.''
A spokesman for ScottishPower, which has 2.3 million domestic
customers, said: ''It is purely a matter for customers in England and
Wales because of the complex differences in the privatisation process.''
Professor Tom Carbery, chairman of the Southern Scotland electricity
consumers' committee, said he was ''alert to the situation'' and would
be raising the matter with the committee at the earliest possible date.
Energy Secretary Tim Eggar said the flotation of the National Grid was
expected in early December. He said the #50 bonus to customers, which
was expected to cost more than #1000m, was in line with what the
National Consumers Council had requested.
National Grid chairman David Jefferies, who earns #359,000 a year,
came under the spotlight during the ''fat cats'' controversy earlier
this year, when Labour valued his share option package at #1.8m.

UNIONS representing 24,000 blue-collar Ford workers yesterday lodged
firm demands for an inflation-busting 10% pay rise plus a two-hour
reduction in the working week.
A broadly similar claim has already been presented to Vauxhall on
behalf of its 9000 manual workers.
The unions maintain they are serious, especially concerning a shorter
working week. Ford and Vauxhall workers have not insisted on it in the
past, with the result they now work longer hours than Ford's European
workers, many other UK car workers, and the bulk of the British car
components sector.
Stressing the company's ''dramatic turnround'' last year that produced
a #114m operating profit, Transport and General Workers' Union national
secretary Tony Woodley told Ford management it was due in no small
measure to the workforce.
Productivity had improved by more than 22% during the life of the last
two-year agreement. As a result, the company was now clearly back in
profit and genuinely able to afford to meet the claim.

IMPROVEMENTS are needed in the training of people working in the
Scottish tourism industry, it was claimed yesterday.
The call came from Mr James Provan, chairman of the European
Parliament's tourism group, who also urged that Europe give tourism the
respect it merited as one of the community's biggest industries.
The Conservative Euro-MP was speaking as members of the European Union
of Tourist Officers (EUTO) met in Glasgow for their annual convention,
which is being held in Scotland for the first time. He told reporters
that tourism in Scotland was too often regarded as a casual occupation.
''If we are serious about marketing Scotland in a proper way, we have
to spend much more time on proper training and making people respect
tourism as a profession.''
Improved training was needed for jobs ranging from waiting to hotel
management, in fact anyone who dealt with tourists, he said. ''In
France, for example, you get people who make a profession out of being a
waiter. They do it all their lives and do it properly and
professionally. Here, it is regarded as a part-time and casual job.''
Mr Provan, who used to hold the North East Scotland constituency but
now represents the English seat of South Downs West, also spoke of the
need for the recognition of tourism in the European Union's treaty and
for the co-ordination of European policies to help the industry.
''Between eight and 10 million people across the European community
are involved in tourism and probably double that in related and
dependent industries, which makes it a huge sector which could have a
great impact on solving some of Europe's employment problems -- if it
was addressed properly as an industry,'' he said.
Earlier, Mr Provan told delegates: ''The future of the tourist
industry in Europe will depend on generating more new jobs by
reinforcing the three Rs -- better recognition of the industry; better,
and therefore less, regulation of the industry; and better results from
the industry by improving the quality through training.''
Mr Arild Kristiansen, president of EUTO, urged the EU to develop a
tourism policy by including it within the Treaty on the European Union.

THE Irish Government has given its official backing to an ambitious
and pioneering initiative between Dublin's Trinity College and Aberdeen
and Strathclyde universities to give greater international prominence to
Celtic studies.
Mr Ruari Quinn, Irish Finance Minister and deputy Labour Party leader,
hailed the new links as a significant joint academic venture which will
help to replace inherited national prejudices with international
co-operative understanding.
Speaking last night at a civic reception in Iveagh House, headquarters
of the Irish Foreign Ministry, Mr Quinn described the flagship
development as a major advance on the cultural front which will
reinforce the diplomatic efforts of the British and Irish Governments to
consolidate peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.
Irish-Scottish Academic Initiative will make available shared study
programmes emphasising common interests in language, literature, and
history, inclusive of the English and Gaelic traditions.
Students and staff will collaborate in teaching, learning, and joint
research projects.
At the launch of the initiative, Mr Thomas Mitchell, provost of
Trinity College, said that ''this collaboration is another way of
tackling the dangers of parochialism. You cannot know what is
distinctive about the society you are primarily interested in unless you
compare it with others.''
Dr Maxwell Irvine, principal of Aberdeen University, described the
initiative as building stronger links and better understanding between
the peoples of the British Isles. He commended Irish Deputy Prime
Minister Dick Spring for his personal interest in the programme.
Dr John Arbuthnott, principal of Strathclyde University, said the
programme would provide a wider scope for academic and cultural
activity. He hoped it would generate greater public awareness of the
common history and culture of Scotland and Ireland.
One of the immediate projects of the initial five-year programme will
be research into the Irish famine of 1845. Details will be worked out by
a steering committee involving senior academics from the three
universities.
Last night, it was announced that Dr George Watson, a Reader in
English Studies, has been promoted to the new professorship of Irish
Literature in English, the first of its kind in Scotland.
Born in Portadown, County Armagh, and educated at Queens University,
Belfast, and Wadham College, Oxford, Professor Watson is a founding
member of the British-Irish Association for Irish Studies. He is also
the author of Irish Identity and the Literary Revival, concentrating
particularly on the works of W B Yeats, Ireland's greatest poet this
century.

<TEXT>
AN Islay councillor accused Scottish Natural Heritage of being
''interfering zealots'' as a plan for a wind farm on the island was
approved yesterday.
But Councillor Robin Currie was himself taken to task by the chairman
of Argyll and Bute District Council's planning committee when the
application for a wind farm near Duich Moss -- scene of conservation
battles in the past -- was discussed.
Planning officials had recommended refusal of the application from
Bristol-based firm Windcluster for five 61.5 metre turbines on the
grounds of opposition from SNH.
SNH had said the firm had failed to ''demonstrate conclusively'' that
the wind farm would pose no risk to flocks of Greenland white-fronted
geese.
But Mr Currie said the firm had drawn on research elsewhere in Britain
and in Europe which showed the birds did not fly into wind turbines.
He added: ''Everything else is favourable but once again the only body
objecting is SNH. I find this real arrogance of those interfering
zealots quite unacceptable when something is of benefit to the island.''
But committee chairman Mr Allan Macaskill told him: ''I think you were
a bit harsh in your comments on SNH, who have a job to do.''
The committee supported Mr Currie's move to approve the plan after
officials said they had no objections to the visual appearance of the
turbines. The application will now be referred to the Scottish Office.
An SNH spokesman said: ''We are very much in favour of the alternative
renewable energy approach. It's just particularly unfortunate that the
location of this application happens to be so close to one of the main
roosts of Greenland white-fronted geese, an internationally protected
bird.''

THE case against a Glasgow surgeon accused of serious professional
misconduct involving the treatment of a dying teenage girl collapsed
yesterday.
After hearing evidence against senior consultant Mr Robert Dalling,
52, the General Medical Council's professional conduct committee ruled
there was insufficient evidence to support such a finding.
It upheld a submission by Mr Dalling's counsel, Mr John Grace, that
there was not enough evidence upon which the committee could find that
he had fallen below the standards expected of a consultant in his
position.
Mr Grace used evidence from prosecution witness Mr Simon
Patterson-Brown to back-up his argument.
He said: ''What is plain is that all along the line Mr Patterson-Brown
accepts that although he and others may not have done what Mr Dalling
did there would be responsible surgeons who would have done what he did.
''In that case, there can be no question of negligence as far as Mr
Dalling is concerned.''
Announcing the decision, chairman Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter expressed the
committee's deepest sympathy to the parents of 14-year-old Lorraine
McGalliard, of Waverley Crescent, Kirkintilloch, near Glasgow.
Lorraine died from multi-organ failure on September 13, 1993, at
Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow. She was overcome by a massive pelvic
infection after a huge cyst on an ovary ruptured.
Mr Dalling was accused of postponing an ultra-sound scan on Lorraine
but in evidence insisted it would have made no difference to his
decisions on her treatment, which involved using antibiotics.
Lorraine's parents, May and John McGalliard, said they were not
surprised that the charge against her surgeon had been dropped.
Mrs McGalliard said: ''We were expecting this to happen. He is the
scapegoat. Stobhill has learned a hell of a lesson because of what
happened to Lorraine and they have changed their policies.
''Hopefully Lorraine dying has saved a hell of lot of lives.''
Mrs McGalliard added: ''To get the correct picture of what happened,
you would have had to have five doctors before the GMC. Mr Dalling was
at the bottom of our queue.
''We know three others who have been seriously reprimanded but that's
all that will be done.''
Mr and Mrs McGalliard said they still intended to press ahead with
their medical negligence claim against Stobhill Hospital Trust.
Mr Dalling left the hearing surrounded by his lawyers without making
any comment.
In an unusual move, Dr Lee-Potter issued a statement following the
decision, saying that, although the case had been limited to Mr
Dalling's role in Lorraine's treatment, much wider issues had been
canvassed.
He said: The case has highlighted the need for better management and
communication in hospitals. The case was concerned with the wider issues
of management of patient care.
''The evidence has underlined the vital importance in patient care of
good planning and communication, both oral and written, between hospital
departments, particularly where emergency medicine is concerned.
''The committee urges doctors and others working in hospitals to
consider these matters for the benefit of patients in the future.''
An informed GMC source said the case against Mr Dalling should never
have been brought and certainly not in the way it was.
The impression, shared even by the distraught parents, that he had
been a ''fall guy'' for the alleged collective errors of a whole team of
doctors at Stobhill, must have been a major factor in the decision, the
source added.
Despite the valiant efforts of the council's barrister to claim that
Mr Dalling, as senior consultant, could be considered separately, the
hearing inevitably became a de facto ''trial'' of the practices of staff
at Stobhill.
As such, said the source, it would have been impossible for
allegations of unfair treatment of Mr Dalling to be refuted.
''An appeal against any finding of serious professional misconduct
against him, would have been odds on to be upheld.''
As Mr Grace pointed out, the committee was not concerned with an ideal
world but with the harsh realities of a hospital where a consultant was
faced with making decisions on a ward round involving 100 or more
patients.
The council will now have to consider carefully whether to bring
further cases alleging negligence against a single doctor when an entire
hospital's practices will inevitably come under the microscope.

THE Archdiocese of Glasgow, which was almost #10m in the red in 1992,
has reduced its debts to #3.3m, according to its latest financial
report.
The disposal of assets, including the sale of unused land in Bearsden
and the former Pastoral Centre in Newlands, Glasgow, is understood to
have accounted for most of this year's reduction, beating the forecast
of a drop to #4m by the end of this year.
The purchase by the Blairs Trust of Scotus College, the national
seminary in Scotland, which had been jointly owned by the dioceses of
Glasgow, Paisley, and Motherwell, was also a factor in reducing the
debt, which peaked at #9.7m in 1992.
Cardinal Thomas Winning, speaking in the current edition of Flourish,
the official newspaper of the Glasgow archdiocese, paid tribute to the
generosity of church attenders who, he said, had been critical in the
continuing debt recovery programme.
A total of #2.6m has been donated through church collections since he
launched the Archdiocesan Debt Reduction Appeal in February, 1993 --
#650,000 of this amount has been contributed this year.

A FORMER church elder, who bound a naked young girl with ropes before
filming her with a video camera, was jailed for two years at the High
Court in Kilmarnock yesterday.
The court was told that Andrew Wallace, 41, of Whatriggs Road,
Kilmarnock, bound the girl on numerous occasions when she was aged
between 13 and 15.
He admitted conducting himself in a shamelessly indecent manner
towards the girl at various addresses in Ayrshire, by causing her to
stand naked, covering her eyes and mouth with masking tape, placing a
mask over her face, and placing an object covered with tape in her
mouth.
Wallace also pleaded guilty to causing the girl to place leather
bracelets around her neck, wrists, and ankles, and tying her body with
ropes in acts of bondage, tying her hands together, and making video
recordings.
Mr Andrew Lamb, advocate depute, told the court that Wallace, a father
of one son and stepfather of two sons and a daughter, had been divorced
and that his second wife had died suddenly.
He said that the offences had come to light when a video was found in
a camcorder showing the girl in the condition described in the charge.
''She was complaining and was clearly distressed,'' he added.
Mr Lamb said that the offences had taken place on numerous occasions
between January 1993 and December 1994, and that after the discovery of
the video police had been called in.
Defence advocate Mr Ian Duguid said that Wallace wished to express his
deep regret and remorse to everyone involved, and that he had never had
any intention other than to admit his guilt of the offences.
Mr Duguid said that the behaviour had taken place eight or nine times
over a two-year period, but was not a regular occurrence.
Mr Duguid submitted letters of support for Wallace from his young
victim, and the Rev Robert Martin, of St Andrews Glencairn Church,
Kilmarnock, where the accused had been an elder.
''It may come as something of a surprise that the young girl has given
her support, but the letter is there,'' he said.
Lord McCluskey told Wallace: ''What makes this behaviour abhorrent in
the eyes of the law, as it has been for centuries, is that you behaved
in this way towards a girl who was 13, 14, and 15, who it was clear was
not a willing participant.''
In jailing Wallace for two years, he said he had taken into account
the letters submitted and the accused's previously good character.

EUROPEAN Commission officials confirmed last night they will make a
second attempt to impose costly hygiene checks on fishermen's catches,
this time in defiance of the European Parliament.
A cross-party group of angry British and Irish Euro-MPs earlier this
year condemned the idea and believed they had killed it off.
If the charges are imposed, they could cost the already troubled
Scottish fishing fleet about #4m a year, according to fishermen's
leaders.
The commission argues the proposed charges are ''reasonable''. Two
Scottish Euro-MPs are now planning a second attack on the commission's
decision to resurrect the plan, as disclosed in yesterday's Herald.
A row now looms between the European Parliament and the Commission,
with farm Commissioner Franz Fischler being accused of trying to by-pass
the assembly by going directly to the powerful Council of Ministers.
The Commission plans to impose a charge of 1 Ecu (80p) on each tonne
of fish landed or sold, a further 80p per tonne for inspections of
establishments (mainly processing plants), and #1.60 per tonne of fish
imports at frontiers.
If the Commission has its way, the money will be paid directly by
skippers or others in the trade. At present, hygiene checks are paid in
Britain by the Government.
1  The suggested charges enraged Scottish fishermen earlier this year
when it was disclosed that fish would in future be treated in the same
way as poultry and meat, on which there are veterinary charges payable
by European farmers.

SCOTTISH colleges have urged the Secretary of State to change the way
#50m in further education bursaries is allocated.
The Association of Scottish Colleges has concluded that local
government changes, next year, will mean the status quo -- where local
authorities have responsibility for bursaries in their discretionary
power -- is not a feasible option.
The association has proposed that Mr Michael Forsyth transfer
responsibility for the bursaries to the Students Awards Branch for
Scotland, or to the colleges themselves.
Mr John Sellars, ASC secretary, said yesterday: ''In recent years,
Cosla has worked hard to ensure local authorities have adopted a
national and equitable approach to their discretionary powers for
supporting further education students to attend college.
''Nevertheless, there is every likelihood that such support and the
associated bursary expenditure will haemorrhage away after April 1 next
year, as the new single-tier authorities determine their own
discretionary priorities.''
He added: ''The priority for the further education colleges is to
ensure the current level of expenditure is retained. In the current
situation, the Secretary of State is responsible for the adequacy of
further education provision but local authorities still have control of
further education bursary policy. This is unsatisfactory.''
Mr Ray Baker, ASC chairman, said: ''At a recent meeting, Mr Forsyth
gave a clear indication that he would wish colleges to give priority to
helping the Government achieve its targets at technician levels and
would be receptive to receiving proposals that would help to achieve
this objective.
''The continued allocation of #50m for further education bursaries is
a vital component of this objective.''

TWO men who carried out a brutal attack which was captured on security
cameras outside a Glasgow nightclub had their sentences increased from
four years to seven yesterday.
After watching a video film of the attack in which Jason O'Donnell and
Hugh Friel repeatedly jumped and stamped on their victim's head, the
Court of Criminal appeal decided that the sentences of four years were
''quite inappropriate''.
It is understood to be the first time in Scotland that the Lord
Advocate has successfully appealed against a lenient sentence imposed in
the High Court and the first time a video has been used to support such
a claim.
O'Donnell, 21, and Friel, 25, both of Inglefield Street, Govanhill,
Glasgow, appeared at the High Court in Glasgow in June this year and
admitted assaulting William McGeoch to his severe injury and the danger
of his life.
Mr McGeoch, was attacked after he left Bennet's nightclub in Glassford
Street, Glasgow, on March 1 this year. His head was smashed against a
window and as he lay unconscious on the pavement the two accused
continued their ferocious assault.
Mr McGeoch, from Baillieston, Glasgow, was drowning in his own blood
when he arrived in hospital. Doctors had to clear an obstruction in his
airway. He made a remarkable recovery and suffered no serious injuries.
After watching the video film, Lord Clyde told O'Donnell and Friel
that their victim had been fortunate to survive such a vicious, cruel,
and sustained attack and jailed both for four years.
Yesterday, the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger, QC, argued before Lord
Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, sitting with Lords Weir and Wylie, that
the four-year sentence was unduly lenient.
He said the original judge had been in the unusual position of being
able to see what actually happened rather than have to rely solely on a
verbal account. This was something which might become more common.
In his report to the appeal court, Lord Clyde had described the attack
as brutal and merciless but added that he had been conscious of the need
not to over-react to the ''vivid presentation'' of the assault on the
video.
Lord Rodger went on: ''If the judge has the opportunity to see what
actually happened it is appropriate not to rein back his reactions to it
but simply to have regard to what he sees. There is no reason to
discount the fact that he sees what actually happened.''
The court was then shown the video film of the assault on Mr McGeoch,
which drew gasps of horror from the public benches.
Lord Rodger said the scenes shown on the video justified Lord Clyde's
description of the assault as brutal and merciless and argued that a
four-year sentence did not reflect the brutality of what had happened.
He also pointed out that both men had previous convictions for crimes
of violence. Friel had been jailed for three years for assault and
robbery and O'Donnell has received an 18-month sentence for assault to
severe injury.
Mr Allan Nicol, counsel for O'Donnell, and Mr Gerry Brown,
solicitor-advocate, for Friel, both argued that Lord Clyde had imposed
the appropriate sentence.
Giving the court's decision after a brief adjournment, Lord Ross
outlined the circumstances in which a sentence might have to be
increased by the appeal court.
It might be necessary for the protection of the public, or because of
the serious nature of the offence. There might also be circumstances
where an exemplary sentence was necessary to deter others.
''It may be a situation where the public sense of outrage at an
offence is such that a more severe sentence is necessary to mark that.''
Lord Clyde had described the attack in this case as brutal and
merciless and the appeal court regarded that as an appropriate
description. He had gone on to say that he was conscious of the need not
to over-react to what he had seen.
Lord Ross said: ''We do not feel that the sentencing judge can be
criticised for indicating that it was important not to over-react,
providing that it is clearly understood that it was necessary for him to
have regard to what he saw on the video film, bearing in mind that he
was in the position of seeing what actually happened.''
Being able to watch a film of this kind put the court in a stronger
position than having to rely purely on a verbal description of what took
place.
Lord Ross said that while it was important for a judge not to
over-react, it was also important for him to react carefully and
responsibly to what he had seen on the video.
The sentencing judge had described the danger to life in this case as
the short-lived obstruction to the victim's airways as he lay on a
hospital trolley.
It appeared to the appeal court, however, that having viewed the film,
the whole attack amounted to an assault to the danger of life, and Lord
Clyde had taken too narrow a view.
''We have come to the clear conclusion that the sentences imposed in
this case were unduly lenient. When regard is had to the brutal and
merciless nature of this assault and the record of previous convictions
we are quite satisfied that sentences of four years were quite
inappropriate.''
They imposed sentences of seven years.

<HEADLINE>Sting funds Aids 'cure'. Court told of ventures</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976142652</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SUCCESSFUL cure for Aids was claimed in court yesterday, by an
entrepreneur who is said to have lost #1.5m of rock superstar Sting's
money in a series of speculative ventures.
Mr Safdar Samarkandi said he was now involved in the development of
technology which, in a six-month scientific trial, had resulted in the
lives of 17 patients with the disease being ''saved''.
He told Southwark Crown Court a further trial was to be carried out
jointly by Oxford and Cambridge universities on ''the only technology in
the world that can cure Aids''.
The surprise claim came as Mr Samarkandi, former owner of an Indian
restaurant chain, gave evidence at the trial of Sting's former
accountant, Mr Keith Moore, 51, who is accused of stealing #6m from the
performer.
The entrepreneur gave details of various projects for which he said
the star's money had been used, including setting up an international
restaurant chain and backing a plan by former Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev to move into the commercial aviation field.
Mr Nicholas Purnell, QC, defending Mr Moore on 15 sample charges of
theft, then asked the businessman: ''What are you developing now?''
Mr Samarkandi replied: ''Medical technology developed over the past
three years and based on an electro-magnetic pulse.''
After further exchanges on a separate topic, the barrister then asked:
''Are you engaged in something viable or some fantasy?''
The businessman replied: ''I am engaged in a technology and an
industry in the UK. It is being done under the supervision of Cambridge
and Oxford universities, who are to run the trials.
''It is the only technology in the world that can cure Aids.''
He added: ''It was tested on 23 trial patients over a six-month
period. Seventeen were saved.''
Earlier, Mr Samarkandi told the court that his half-sister first
introduced him to Mr Moore 12 years ago.
The Crown has claimed the financial adviser used millions of pounds of
Sting's cash, without the star's knowledge or permission, to back a
series of ill-fated ventures.
Mr Samarkandi said one involved a project for a ''super jumbo -- a
sort of steamship of the skies'', capable of carrying 700 passengers and
based on the Russian Antonov military transport plane.
He said he presented his idea to Mr Gorbachev, who was keen to move
into the world of civil aviation.
Mr Samarkandi said Mr Moore agreed to help fund the aircraft venture
with up to #200,000 to pay legal expenses associated with the scheme,
which involved development costs totalling two billion dollars.
He said the project flopped with the disintegration of the Soviet
Union and the antagonism of new Russian leader Boris Yeltsin to any
projects associated with Mr Gorbachev.
Mr Samarkandi told the court that Mr Moore provided funding of almost
#1m to open four Indian restaurants in Australia, in a move that
capitalised on the ''enormous success'' of Mr Samarkandi's restaurant,
The Bombay Bicycle Club, in Wandsworth, south-west London.
Everything went well until the Australian economy nosedived, the
entrepreneur said.
Mr Samarkandi told the court that, as financial pressures grew and the
bills flooded in, he wrote a series of letters to Mr Moore demanding he
provide cash he had promised.
He said Mr Moore, of Stevenage Road, Fulham, south-west London, also
provided #25,000 to back a six-speed ''environmentally friendly''
gearbox, that was to have been slotted into the new MG sports car to be
sold in America.
Mr Samarkandi told the court that he never knew that some of the money
Mr Moore was using was Sting's.
He added that he failed to make the connection when two of the cheques
sent to him -- one for #100,000, another for #60,000 -- included, as
part of the account title the name GM Sumner -- a reference to Gordon
Matthew Sumner, Sting's real name.
The trial was adjourned until today.

Washington
PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
signed their detailed peace agreement in the White House today,
promising to continue down the road towards a durable peace, and to
fight together against extremism and terrorism.
Mr Arafat said: ''Let's nurture this peace of the brave for the sake
of our grandchildren, for the people of Palestine and Israel, and the
whole region.''
Both leaders denounced terrorism. Mr Rabin said: ''Do not let the land
flowing with milk and honey become a land flowing with blood and tears.
If all the partners to peace-making do not unite against the evil angels
of death by terrorism, all that will remain of this ceremony will be
colour snap-shots, empty mementoes.''
Mr Arafat was equally emphatic. He spoke of the inevitability of
peace, and asserted that the agreement meant that Palestinians would
achieve equality and self-determination ''without wars and terrorism''.
''We are betting everything on the future,'' he said, ''so we must
condemn violence totally. From this day on, we do not want to see any
threat to any innocent Palestinian or Israeli life. Enough killing of
innocent people!''
He was warmly applauded at this point.
President Clinton said: ''I welcome you to the White House for this
milestone on the path to reconciliation. Today, we make a great stride
towards the fulfilment of a vision of the day when two people divided by
generations of conflict are bound together by peace.
''Finally, the time is approaching when there will be safety in
Israel's house, when the Palestinian people will write their own
destiny, when the clash of arms will be banished from God's holy land.''
He praised the ''profound courage'' of both statesmen. Earlier,
receiving the two in his office together with the president of Egypt and
the king of Jordan, he noted that there remained two empty seats, for
Syria and Lebanon. Mr Rabin urged patience: ''They will come in the
end,'' he said.
Mr Arafat mentioned the difficult problems that have yet to be
resolved: the final borders of the two entities, the question of Jewish
settlers, the Palestinian refugees, and, above all, Jerusalem.
''Our people consider it to be the heart and soul of their entity and
the centre of their cultural, spiritual and economic life. It should be
the capital of peace between the Arab and Jewish people, a beacon of
peace.''
He referred several times to ''an independent Palestinian political
entity''. At least, this was the phrase used by his translator. Perhaps,
in Arabic, the word means ''state''. He had made no secret, in
unscripted remarks earlier, that he considered today's agreement a big
step towards a Palestinian state.
The two men signed in the presence of President Clinton and the
American political establishment. Mr Clinton, President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt, and King Hussein of Jordan signed as witnesses.
Other witnesses were Felipe Gonzalez, Prime Minister of Spain,
representing the EU, and the Russian, Japanese, and Norwegian foreign
ministers, each bringing a significant message to the occasion. The
Saudi foreign minister was there, for the first time, to give his
country's tacit blessing to the occasion.
The ceremony was in the East Room, where Lincoln once lay in state and
where the first Arab-Israeli agreement was signed in 1978, between Anwar
Sadat and Menachem Begin, after their meeting at Camp David.
A year after that first step towards reconciliation, an
Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty was signed on the lawn in front of the
White House. It took another 14 years before the follow-up agreement,
between Israel and the PLO, was signed, this time behind the White
House, by Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat. That, in turn, on the same spot, was
followed by the Israel-Jordan peace treaty.
On their first joint appearance here, Mr Rabin shook Mr Arafat's hand
with conspicuous reluctance. They have met many times since then, and
relations are clearly much warmer now.
Today's is the second peace agreement negotiated by the Americans this
week: the first, two days ago in New York, concerned Bosnia. They have
in common that crucial details remain unsettled and that they could yet
collapse altogether.

A STUDENT jailed for 30 months for cheating five members of a football
pools syndicate of #2.3m was granted bail by a High Court judge in
Edinburgh yesterday.
Cameron Baxter, 27, of Wallace Street, Stirling, did not appear at the
brief private hearing in chambers.
Lord Weir granted interim liberation to Baxter pending his appeal.
Baxter will appear before three appeal judges on a date still to be
fixed. He was jailed after admitting he embezzled #5 stake money he
collected from five Scottish Power workers, depriving them of #2.3m
winnings.
Baxter, a student at Stirling University, was sentenced at the High
Court in Glasgow. The court had heard that during the summer holidays
last year he was in financial difficulties and kept the pools money
which he collected from the syndicate.
He had worked as a self-employed agent for Littlewoods.

<TEXT>
AN Argyll holiday complex is being reported to the procurator-fiscal
over alleged misrepresentation in its advertising brochure.
The new Holy Loch Holiday Park, owned by Argyll businessman Douglas
Campbell, a former tourist board chairman, has been under investigation
by consumer and trading standards officers.
The complex, which was opened only last year, could now face legal
proceedings and possible prosecution over alleged false claims made in
advertising the multi-million pound facility.
Mr Campbell last year fell foul of Argyll and Bute District Council
when he illegally cut down woodland. He faced court proceedings which
resulted in him being fined #5000.
The investigation by Strathclyde Regional Council consumer and trading
standards officers is into the wording of a publicity brochure produced
to advertise the holiday park.
The brochure describes facilities which have not, as yet, been built
and features land and buildings that are not part of the park, which
overlooks the former US naval base in the Holy Loch.
Mr Campbell, a former -- and highly controversial -- chairman of Bute
and Cowal Tourist Board and a former director of Argyll and the Islands
Enterprise, said he knew nothing about the investigation.
''Nobody has contacted me about the brochure. As far as I am
concerned, there is nothing wrong with it,'' he said.
In the last year since the park opened, Mr Campbell says he has sold
93 holiday caravans worth #1.5m.
''The Holy Loch Holiday Park is doing very well and this is only the
start. I have major plans for this area which will see folk flocking to
Dunoon,'' he added.
Strathclyde Regional Council confirmed yesterday that the holiday park
was under investigation.
A council spokesman said: ''A report is now being prepared for the
procurator-fiscal following an investigation by consumer and trading
standards officers into a complaint about advertising at the Holy Loch
Holiday Park.''
In the holiday park brochure, Mr Campbell claims that he has certain
facilities such as a swimming pool on the site.
Recently, when a guest asked to use the pool, they found it located on
neighbouring land owned by another holiday company, Hafton House, which
charged visitors for a swim.

Los Angeles
THE leading defence counsel in the O J Simpson murder trial escalated
his attack on police investigators, calling them ''devils of deception''
and urging jurors to ''do the right thing'' and acquit the former
football star.
Lawyer Johnnie Cochran detailed what he said was a vast conspiracy led
by a racist rogue pliceman to frame Simpson for the murders of his
ex-wife and her friend.
Outside the courtroom, Fred Goldman, the father of murder victim Ron
Goldman, exploded with anger over Cochran's closing argument.
''He suggests racism is at the heart of our justice system and only
the jury can see that. This man is sick,'' Goldman said, literally
shaking with rage. ''He's a whore walking around among decent people.
On the second day of his impassioned final summation, Cochran accused
police of falsely implicating Simpson in ''a rush to judgment, an
obsession to win at any cost.'' At the centre of the alleged plot was
former detective Mark Fuhrman, who Cochran described as a ''lying,
perjuring, genocidal racist'' with a long-time vendetta against the
black celebrity.
Cochran reminded the mostly black jury that Fuhrman lied under oath
when he said he not uttered the word ''nigger'' in the past 10 years,
only to be contradicted by excerpts of taped interviews with an aspiring
screenwriter.
But Cochran went a step further, directly accusing Fuhrman of planting
the bloody glove he testified to finding at Simpson's estate. And he
claimed the conspiracy and ''cover up'' also encompassed other
detectives, crime-scene experts and the West Los Angeles police
commander.
Contending that Furhman was driven by racial hatred, Cochran reminded
jurors of testimony from one witness that the detective once said ''the
only good nigger is a dead nigger.''
''You've probably heard that sometime in your life,'' Cochran told a
jury made up of nine blacks, two whites and one Hispanic.
Cochran urged jurors to throw out all of the crucial prosecution
evidence he says was tainted by conspiracy, which would effectively gut
the state's case. Simpson pleaded innocent to the June 1994 murders of
his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Goldman, an aspiring
male model.
''You have the courage and the integrity to do the right thing,''
Cochran said before turning the lectern over to fellow defence lawyer
Barry Scheck. ''We believe that you will do the right thing and find
this man not guilty.''
Prosecutors have ridiculed defence conspiracy theories as
''far-fetched'' and Simpson's lawyers have yet to produce any hard
evidence to back the claims.
Prosecutor Chris Darden on Wednesday described the former football
star as a man with a ''short fuse'' that burned every day until he
exploded in a murderous rage, killing his former wife ''to settle a
personal score,'' and then Goldman ''because he got in the way.'' --

THE Net Book Agreement -- which has fixed book prices in Britain for
the past 40 years -- was effectively laid to rest yesterday when the
Publishers Association decided it could no longer administer and enforce
the system.
The announcement followed a three-hour meeting of 16 leading
publishers at the association's headquarters in Bloomsbury, central
London.
In a statement, the association said it could no longer call upon
signatories to enforce the terms of the agreement and would therefore
not defend the NBA before the Restrictive Practices Court.
It added: ''Individual publishers remain free to decide for themselves
whether they wish to impose net prices on their titles but without a
system of administration and enforcement.''
Booksellers had already accepted that the NBA was beyond revival and
many are gearing up for a fierce price war. The NBA had been subject to
legal proceedings both before UK courts and the European Commission
after accusations that it was effectively a price-fixing cartel.
Since publishers Hodder, Headline, and Reed first pulled out of the
system, readers have enjoyed up to 50% off the price of books at Asda.
W H Smith and Waterstones are expected to cut the prices of nearly 100
titles from Sunday.
Mr Clive Bradley, chief executive of the Publishers Association,
warned that the industry was becoming more concerned with sales than
diversity of book titles.
The Library Association said the virtual collapse of the NBA could hit
libraries hard because the cost of less popular, specialist publications
was likely to rise, with suppliers concentrating on discounting mass
market books.

LOTHIAN Regional Council's transportation committee is expected to
agree on Monday to contribute #15,000 towards the #50,000 cost of
appointing consultants to prepare plans for a transport museum in
Edinburgh.
Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd (Leel), Edinburgh District
Council, and Forth Ports are expected to contribute the remainder of the
money. The museum project is estimated to cost #8m and is expected to be
based in Leith.
A Lothian region spokeswoman said that, once the development study was
complete, it was hoped the museum would attract significant funding from
the public and private sector and from the National Heritage Memorial
Fund.
A preliminary study had shown there was a market for a transport
museum in the city, with 350,000 visitors a year likely to be attracted.
The study proposed an innovative approach, using real-life experiences
of transportation, music, and story-telling as well as multi-media
displays.
Councillor David Begg, chairman of the transportation committee, said
the region and Lothian Bus Club had collections of vintage public
transport throughout Scotland and it had been planned for some time to
house them all in a Lothian base.

LABOUR yesterday launched a campaign accusing the Conservatives of
telling ''porky pies'' and breaking election promises.
In the first verbal onslaught of what promises to be several months of
fierce debate, Shadow Environment Secretary Frank Dobson claimed the
Prime Minister would ''make any promise and tell any lie to cling to the
power he loves''.
At a Westminster news conference, Mr Dobson tried to illustrate the
point by handing out pork pies, claiming each one represented a
Conservative lie on crime, tax, homes, and a range of other policies.
The campaign was also launched on television last night with a party
political broadcast.
Deputy Labour leader John Prescott claimed the party's summer campaign
had been a ''resounding success''.
''In eight weeks of campaigning, we have won the arguments with the
Tories on water privatisation and investment, rail privatisation and
public safety, on the future of the health service with our details of
88 planned hospital closures, and on unemployment.
''A new phrase has entered the political vocabulary -- the chicken run
-- and a series of important Conservative selections have been thrown
into confusion as a result.''
Mr Dobson said that to win the last General Election, the Tories had
told a lot of lies and made a lot of promises they had since broken.
Nowhere was this more spectacular than over home ownership.
''On March 31, 1992, John Major promised, 'We're going to make life
easier for people buying their own home'.
''Since he said that, his Government have cut mortgage tax relief
twice, cut mortgage help for unemployed homeowners in six different ways
on four separate occasions, and cut mandatory home renovation grants
which they now intend to abandon altogether,'' said Mr Dobson.
Conservative Central Office declined to comment on the latest
accusations.

THE Scottish Office yesterday, in an unprecedented appeal, offered a
#1000 reward to help trace a hit-and-run driver who caused #75,000
damage to a motorway flyover.
A concrete beam in the bridge on the A80 at Condorrat near
Cumbernauld, was cracked 12 days ago, when it was hit by what police
believe to have been a vehicle carrying an abnormally high load.
Motherwell police motorway group was alerted by a passing motorist at
2pm on Sunday, September 17, who reported seeing lumps of concrete
crumbling from the bridge on to the motorway.
The Glasgow-bound carriageway of the A80 was closed for three days
while work to clear the road and erect temporary metal bridge supports
took place.
Last night, the Scottish Office appealed for information to help
establish the identity of the driver, who they will be demanding foots
the #75,000 cost of replacing the beam.
A spokesman said: ''As far as we know, it is unprecedented for us to
offer such a reward. We have no other avenue left to pursue and no other
means of finding the driver.
''We feel somebody must have seen something, for the vehicle itself
must have received visible damage.''
Inspector Drew Lindsey, of Motherwell motorway group police, who is
leading the investigation into the incident, said: ''We are treating
this as a driver failing to report an accident. The A80 is a very busy
road and it is quite likely that someone witnessed the incident.
''I would ask anyone with information to contact the motorway group at
Motherwell.''
Traffic Sergeant John Copland said he believed the collision was
caused by a ''glancing blow'' from a JCB with a high jib or raised load.
''Usually vehicles of unusual height, over 16ft, would notify the
police and receive an escort. This load may not have been fixed right
and ended up unexpectedly being of abnormal height for that route,'' he
said.
Following the incident, the AA renewed its call for vehicle heights to
be clearly displayed inside vehicle cabs for drivers to see.
''Unfortunately this is not an unusual case,'' a spokeswoman said.
Anyone with information about the incident can contact Motherwell
Police on 01698 266144.

New York
SUPERMAN actor Christopher Reeve briefly considered suicide after he
was paralysed in a terrible fall from a horse.
Reeve, 42, who broke his neck in the May accident and has no movement
from his shoulders down, told American TV interviewer Barbara Walters
that ''for about 10 minutes'' he thought living was not worth
''everybody's trouble''.
However the actor said his thoughts of suicide ended when he saw his
children.
''I could see how much they needed me and wanted me, and how lucky we
all are and that my brain is on straight,'' he said in his first
interview since the tragedy.
''The thought vanished and has never come back again.''
The interview, to be shown tomorrow on American television, was
conducted at the Kessler Institute in New Jersey, where Reeve is
undergoing rehabilitation.
He still needs a ventilator to breathe and is learning to use an
electric wheelchair.
For eight weeks after the accident, he said, ''the demons would get me
in the middle of the night''.
''In my dreams I'd be whole,'' he said, ''riding my horse, playing
with my family. We'd be making love, we'd be doing everything.
''And then suddenly I'd wake up and it's two in the morning and I'm
lying in bed and I can't move and I'm on a ventilator. Those are the
worst times.''
He said he suggested to his wife, Dana Morosini: ''Maybe I should just
check out.''
''And then Dana said to me: 'You're still you and I love you','' Reeve
told Walters.
Things were better now, he said, because of ''the love and support and
friendship of family and friends and people around the world''.
''I am so lucky,'' he added.
The accident happened during a weekend riding competition in Virginia.
Reeve said he struggled to understand how he ended up paralysed in a
fall that ''should have been like tripping over your shoelaces''.
Then someone told him that his hand had got stuck in the horse's
bridle.
''So it's like going over with your hands tied and that's why I landed
straight on my head, he said. ''Two hundred pounds going straight down
like a nail.''--AP.

WHEN career woman Julia Smith married England rugby skipper Will
Carling, she knew she would have to face media interest -- but she has
rarely been out of the news during their 14-month marriage.
Luckily, 30-year-old Julia Carling knows how to handle the press --
she runs her own PR company, Hands On PR.
She also works as a presenter for MTV and, more recently, as a model
for high street clothes chain Wallis.
Throughout the couple's marriage, she has always appeared calm, polite
and friendly, even when a barrage of cameras greeted her as she left
their terraced home in Putney, south west London in the early hours of
the morning.
The level-headed vegetarian, who cooks chicken for her husband, has
always said she wanted to make a happy home for Will, whom she met at a
dinner party in 1989, when she ''didn't think an awful lot of him''.
Julia had just split up with veteran guitarist and millionaire Jeff
Beck after six years of co-habiting, and was feeling very depressed.
Former girlfriend of another rock guitar legend, Eric Clapton, she and
Will became friends and they would phone each other when they needed to
talk to someone.
However, it took them four years to get together.
As a child, Julia lived in a Northamptonshire village surrounded by
ponies, and was doted on by her father and two elder brothers.
She is a self-confessed man's woman, preferring to socialise with men
than women.
After studying hard at Oakham boarding school in Leicestershire, she
dropped out of a history degree to live with Jeff.
Recently, Julia's career hit the big-time when she was picked to
replace Anneka Rice on Carlton's daytime show Capital Woman.

<HEADLINE>EU farm policy 'boosting food bills'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976142663</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S farm policy was condemned yesterday as an inefficient,
unhealthy, and expensive cash-guzzler which costs the average British
family nearly #20 a week.
Despite repeated efforts to reform the system which props up the EU's
farmers, a family of four is still contributing more than #10 every week
towards the Common Agricultural Policy through food bills and the rest
in extra taxes, according to a National Consumer Council report.
The latest attack on the #40,000m a year policy follows a warning last
week from Mr John Major that unless the regime is streamlined it will
soon cost an additional #12bn a year.
The report, Agricultural Policy in the European Union, says consumers
and taxpayers are continuing to ''pay through the nose'' for an
inefficient farm subsidy system which is failing farmers, harming the
environment, and damaging the economies of developing countries.
The NCC is demanding fresh reforms and an end to a mollycoddling price
policy which sends farm produce cost soaring.
Farmers should receive instead direct payments on social, regional or
environmental grounds. Such payments should be the responsibility of
national governments, leaving price policy to be set at EU level without
artificial increases to cover the cost of subsidising the farmers.
It also wants cuts in the support prices which Brussels offers to
farmers and an end to limits on food production to help bring down
consumer food bills and make farmers more competitive.
The report claims consumers are paying a premium for the CAP through
higher prices, poorer-quality produce, and less choice.
NCC chairwoman Lady Wilcox said today: ''The average family of four is
still contributing more than #10 each week towards the CAP through food
bills. This money is a hidden tax which creates particular problems for
families on low incomes who pay proportionally more for their food.
''And, as taxpayers, we are still footing the bill for storing
surpluses, dumping them on world markets, and destroying perfectly good
fruit and vegetables.
''We are paying twice over -- once as taxpayers to support farmers
through the CAP regime and then again as consumers through higher food
prices in the shops.''
The Brussels Commission dismissed claims about the cost of the CAP as
''totally theoretical'' -- and then pitched the price as the cost of a
cup of coffee per person per day.
''If we did not have the CAP, food prices would not go down, they
would rocket, because of our situation compared to the world market,''
said a Commission spokesman.
''We are the second biggest food exporter on the world market and one
of the biggest producers. If the CAP were dismantled tomorrow, many EU
farmers would simply go out of business and production would collapse.''

<HEADLINE>New statistics fuel pay wrangle. Labour's national minimum wage calculation is pushed up to #4.26 by Government survey.</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT statistics released yesterday will serve to stoke Labour's
internal problems over its commitment to introduce a statutory national
minimum wage.
With just days to go before Labour's annual conference and even as
party ''fixers'' were trying to emulate their TUC counterparts who three
weeks ago successfully eliminated all mention of a controversial #4.15
target figure from the congress agenda, the disputed target figure of
#4.15 an hour moved up to #4.26.
The party, the TUC, and many trade union affiliates have current
policy decisions endorsing a formula of half median male earnings to be
improved to two thirds over time.
Labour leader Tony Blair, however, wants to ditch all figures and
formulae and set up a Low Pay Commission to decide on the level once
Labour is in power and after consultation with employers and unions.
Until yesterday, this formula had produced figures ranging between
#3.33, Labour's interpretation, and the #4.15 top union figure.
Publication yesterday of the New Earnings Survey figures for the year
to this April pushed the highest interpretation up to #4.26 as verified
by Mr Chris Trinder, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of
Public Finance and Accountancy, who estimated that a minimum wage set at
#4.26 an hour would help more than five million low-paid workers.
Yesterday's figures showed Britain's gap between rich and poor,
already one of the widest in industrialised countries, had increased
further in the last year, with gross weekly earnings of the bottom 10%
of full-time workers increasing by only 1.1% compared with a 3.4% rise
for those in the top 10%.
The weekly wage for those in the bottom 10% was #160 or less and #543
or more for those in the top 10%, where treasurers and company financial
managers (average of #798 a week), displaced doctors and surgeons who
were second (#764).
At the bottom were petrol pump attendants (#152) and kitchen porters
(#153), the same as last year.
Overall, average gross weekly earnings for all adults, full and
part-time employees combined, totalled #286.50p, up 3.6% on last year.
Women's pay rose faster than men's, increasing by 4.0% against 3.3%,
although men still earned more than women, #359.20p versus #204.30p.
Average gross weekly earnings for all full-time employees rose by 3.1%
to #336, compared with a 2.8% increase in the previous year, but pay
levels for manual workers, whose average earnings were #272, lagged well
behind non-manual workers (#372).
Full-time employees worked on average 40 hours per week in April 1995,
slightly higher than in April 1994.
Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's employment spokeswoman, said the survey
showed a Britain divided between those at the top and everyone else and
claimed it had totally under-estimated the scandalous extent of low pay
in this country.
It did not count anybody who earned less than #58 per week and
therefore excluded 2.3 million people, she said, adding: ''It excludes
the lowest paid 20% of full-time employees and it excludes the lowest
30% of part-time employees.
''The true extent of low pay in Britain is that there are over one

A DOSSIER on ''jobs for the boys'' allegations against the new North
Lanarkshire council has been referred to the Secretary of State for
Scotland, Michael Forsyth, for investigation.
The dossier, compiled by the Local Government Staff Commission,
appears to have taken Scottish Office officials by surprise, both in
terms of its size and content.
There is growing speculation that the Scottish Secretary may have to
consider a Monklands-type investigation to allay public fears.
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night: ''I can confirm that the
Secretary of State has received a letter and papers from the staff
commission regarding North Lanarkshire which obviously the Scottish
Office will examine.''
It is understood that the staff commission has been irked by carping
criticism that it was doing little to stop alleged abuses and has
decided to play the ball firmly into Mr Forsyth's court.
The staff commission has powers to issue guidelines to authorities but
has no powers of compulsion.
Despite protestations of being absolutely above board in its
recruitment procedures, North Lanarkshire Council, which next April
takes over from Motherwell, Monklands, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, and
parts of Strathkelvin, has been the constant target of suspicion and
criticism over its appointment of officials.
Its most controversial appointment has been that of 64-year-old David
McKendrick as director of social work at a salary of #71,000. Mr
McKendrick will have barely six months in post after next April before
he is due to retire.
That appointment led to the staff commission issuing new guidelines
following a complaint from one unsuccessful applicant, Mr Ian Gilmour,
then depute director of social work in Strathclyde Region, that three
junior members of his staff were on the selection panel.
Wearying of the allegations and innuendo directed against his council,
North Lanarkshire Labour leader Harry McGuigan used a council meeting
yesterday to put forward a motion expressing confidence in his council's
recruitment procedures.
Some of his Labour colleagues were surprised at his action, arguing
that it was unnecessary for him to place such a controversial item on
the agenda.
However, the SNP took advantage, with Councillor Gordon Murray
demanding that the staff commission be asked to investigate the affair.
He saw no reason to fear such an investigation if the council had
nothing to hide.
However, he said there was grave public disquiet at the large
proportion of former Motherwell district officials appointed to jobs on
the new authority when so few from other areas had been successful.
He cited the case of a senior Cumbernauld and Kilsyth official,
recently appointed to a senior post in the new Renfrewshire council, who
had not been given an interview by North Lanarkshire.
But Councillor McGuigan said he had a responsibility to defend the
integrity of the council and the people it had appointed. SNP members,
he pointed out, had been involved at every stage of the recruitment
procedure and had not raised a murmur.
Later, Councillor McGuigan said the council was willing to co-operate
with any inquiry.

THE head of the world's second oldest Christian religion, Pope
Shenouda III made a rare visit to Scotland yesterday to consecrate a
church feature unique in Britain.
Pope Shenouda III, the Pope of Alexandria and leader of the Coptic
Orthodox Church, stressed the importance of bringing up children
properly to avoid problems later.
He said in Edinburgh that, if the church was successful in the work of
its Sunday schools, the child would regard the church like its mother
and a second home.
''Here in the United Kingdom, there are many serious problems with
youth,'' he said. ''Drugs, homosexuality, immorality, and many abuses of
freedom, not only freedom in behaviour but freedom in thinking.''
Pope Shenouda said the Coptic Church was very active in its Sunday
schools and youth classes. It was a conservative church which kept the
traditions of the founding fathers of the church in the early centuries
of Christianity.
''The first apostolic church was a church of one heart, one mind, one
dogma, and one faith. If we can return to this way of life, the Church
will remain as our Lord God wanted it to be,'' he said.
The patriarch later consecrated church icons and an iconostasis at St
Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church Centre in Kirkcaldy. The only Coptic
Orthodox church in Scotland and serving the whole country, it was
consecrated by the Pope when he first visited Scotland in 1992.
Its membership of 45 families, many in the medical profession, travel
from as far away as Aberdeen, Ayr, Lanark, and Wick to attend services.
The 10,000-piece iconostasis, a vast screen dominating the interior of
the building, is the only one outside the Coptic Church's home in Egypt.
Gifted by the Pope, it was brought to Scotland in sections and assembled
by craftsmen who travelled specially to complete the work.

EARLIER this year Monklands councillors who are also members of the
new North Lanarkshire Council were urged to resign from the new
authority if they had been guilty of abusing power.
The plea emanated from Labour leader of North Lanarkshire, Councillor
Harry McGuigan, following the Labour Party's decision to suspend all
Monklands District Labour councillors in the light of the Black Report.
That report claimed to have uncovered a web of nepotism and spending
bias in the controversial Monklands District Council.
Mr McGuigan, who represents a Motherwell seat, applied further
pressure to his Monklands colleagues by asserting: ''Those individuals
who have been associated with the nepotism, the sectarianism, the abuse
of power within Monklands, and the abuse of their responsibilities --
they know who they are -- should do the decent thing.
''They should recognise they can no longer continue in office. They
know where wrong has been carried out.''
Ironically, Mr McGuigan's own authority has now come under intense
pressure over the ''jobs for the boys'' issue which has forced the Local
Government Staff Commission to report North Lanarkshire's recruitment
practices to the Scottish Secretary.
Opposition councillors have been astonished at the apparent jobs
''carve-up'' given the number of Motherwell District Council officials
who have landed top posts.
They find it hard to believe there is such a wealth of talent in
Motherwell district and such a lack of it in the remainder of the new
council area -- Monklands, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, and part of
Strathkelvin.
Of the initial 10 top appointments, five went to officials of
Motherwell District Council.
The decision that astounded Scottish local government was the
appointment of 64-year-old Mr David McKendrick, a #40,000-a-year
district manager in Strathclyde region's social work department, as the
new authority's #71,000-a-year director of social work.
The fact that Mr McKendrick is due to retire six months after the new
council assumes power next April was only one element of the
controversy.
His main challenger for the job, Mr Ian Gilmour, depute director of
social work at Strathclyde region, won the backing of the public sector
union, Unison, for a complaint to the Staff Commission.
This was based on the revelation that three junior members of Mr
Gilmour's staff were members of the appointments sub-committee.
That itself prompted the Staff Commission to issue revised guidelines
advising that any member of a selection panel who is a current employee
of the same authority as one of the candidates selected for interview
should declare this connection before the interview and should not take
part in the interview of the candidate concerned.
Mr Gilmour has since been appointed depute social work director for
the new City of Glasgow Council but his complaint is still being
pursued.
However, on top of all that the Staff Commission has become
increasingly alarmed about the situation in North Lanarkshire and, not
having the powers to intervene, has put the ball firmly in the court of
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Yesterday, Mr McGuigan took a considerable political risk in opening
up the matter for public debate at the full council meeting in an
attempt to cleanse his council's image.
He and his administration insisted that the best candidates for the
job had been appointed on each occasion and expressed confidence in the
fairness, integrity, and objectivity of the council's recruitment
procedures.
These are not good times for New Labour.
Mr Andrew Cowe, chief executive, is former managing director of
Renfrew District Council and will receive a salary of #89,000 in his new
post.
Mr John O'Hagan, director of administration, will receive #71,046 a
year in his post. He was director of administration at Renfrew District
Council from 1990-5.
Mr Graham Forsyth, director of construction services who will receive
a salary of #71,046, was director of technical and leisure at Monklands
District Council.
Mr Michael O'Neill, salary #71,046, is the new director of education.
he was previously a history teacher in Glasgow and assistant headmaster.
Mr David McKendrick, director of social work, was district manager of
social work for north-east Glasgow before his appointment. He will
receive #71,046 in his new role.
Mr John Milne, director of finance, will be paid #71,046 a year. He is
former director of finance and deputy chief executive at Motherwell
District Council.
Mr Stanley Cook, director of planning, salary: #71,046. He was the
previous director of planning with Motherwell District Council.
Mr McKenzie Hutton, director of environmental services, will receive
#66,462 in his post after being promoted from environmental services
deputy with Motherwell District Council.
Mr Norman Turner, salary #66,462, becomes director of leisure
services. He was a longtime leisure director at Motherwell District
Council.
Mr Gavin Whitefield, director of housing, will receive a salary of
#66,462 and was formerly with Motherwell District Council.

FOR the second time in 24 hours, the Government was condemned
yesterday by a court for the unlawful treatment of IRA terrorists.
A High Court judge in London declared that Home Secretary Michael
Howard was acting unreasonably in his approach to parole rules by
detaining five IRA terrorists in prison six months longer than their
allotted 20-year sentence.
The five are among the longest serving IRA prisoners in United Kingdom
jails.
Yesterday's condemnation by the courts followed hard on the heels of
the European Court on Human Rights ruling which condemned the SAS
shooting of three IRA terrorists on Gibralter seven years ago.
That ruling was discussed at a Cabinet meeting yesterday as
Conservative MPs demanded that Britain reject the European court's
findings.
Coming on top of the European decision, yesterday's ruling by an
English High Court judge in London was more than embarrassing for the
Government, especially as in his judgement he quoted from the European
law on human rights.
The Home Office immediately announced an appeal was being considered.
The five terrorists were jailed in 1976. Taking into account periods
spent in custody before trial, they should have come up for parole in
July and, unless it was considered they were a continuing danger to the
public, they might reasonably have expected to have been freed.
In view of the current ceasefire in Northern Ireland, they were surely
confident of release.
However, under rules being operated in the prison service in England
and Wales, parole applications are not processed until the minimum
tariff has expired.
As this process takes six months, Mr Justice Dyson ruled yesterday
that the five were being detained longer than the courts might
originally have intended.
Their parole hearings will not be heard until December.
This, the judge said, was mainfestly unjust and unlawful. It flouted
the principles of the common law and the European Convention on Human
Rights.
The ruling was last night beeing seen as yet another damning
indictment of the Government over its attitude towards IRA terrorism and
the peace process in Northern Ireland.
However, it was a ruling that could also affect the sentences of the
vast majority of discretionary life prisoners. According to this
judgment, all but a handful could well be being detained in prison for
six months longer than the courts had intended.
Up to 500 murderers and sex offenders in England and Wales could be
affected by yesterday's ruling.
Mr Paul Cavadino, chairman of the Penal Affairs Consortium, said the
judgment meant the Home Office would now have to devise a system whereby
the Parole Board would consider cases before the end of the so-called
minimum tariff period had elapsed.
''If the board judged that the prisoner was safe to release, he or she
should be set free immediately,'' he said.
Ms Gareth Peirce, solicitor for the five convicted terrorists, said
yesterday: ''My clients are effectively serving six months beyond the
point at which they were probably entitled to be released.''
Lawyers for the five -- Brendan Dowd, 47, once named as top terrorist
organiser in Britain, Paul Norney, 37, the longest-serving Irish
republican prisoner of all, Sean Kinsella, 48, Stephen Nordone, 39, and
Noel Gibson, 42 -- argued there was overwhelming evidence, in the light
of the Northern Ireland ceasefire and peace process, that the men no
longer posed a threat.
The judge said the cases of the five should have been referred to the
Parole Board in time to ensure that their applications to be set free
were heard immediately or shortly after their tariff expired, he
declared.
But he rejected the men's bid to overturn a Parole Board refusal to
speed up their hearings once their cases were referred. He ruled that it
was ''impossible to say'' that the five men had stronger cases than
prisoners whose cases had already been listed for hearing up to
December.
The five men were sentenced at Manchester Crown Court in 1976 after
they were found guilty of charges including conspiracy to murder and
cause explosions, attempted murder, and possessing arms and explosives.
The trial judge, Mr Justice Cantley, had described them as ''dedicated
and utterly callous terrorists''.

A HOSPITAL to serve the needs of the people in East Ayrshire is to be
built at Cumnock.
Following a long and often bitter campaign between two NHS Trusts
offering different proposals, the health board has chosen the Cumnock
option.
The Ayrshire and Arran Community Health Care Trust will build the
#8.6m hospital on a site near the centre of Cumnock.
The unanimous decision was made at yesterday's meeting of Ayrshire and
Arran Health Board following presentations and consideration of the
public consultation process.
The alternative plan came from South Ayrshire Hospitals Trust and was
based on retaining part of Ballochmyle Hospital, near Mauchline, in
connection with a ''village'' of housing and retail developments.
The news was called a ''disaster for Ballochmyle and its staff'' by
trust chairman Douglas Brown and local MP George Foulkes expressed his
disappointment.
However, Mrs Aileen Bates, who chairs the community trust, said:
''This is a victory for common sense. We now look forward to welcoming
the first patient in to the new hospital and to working with all the
other NHS professionals who have a role to play in providing care for
the people of the area.''
For many years, there has been a need for a community hospital for the
east of the county to avoid lengthy journeys to Crosshouse or Ayr
hospitals for consultation or treatment.
The health board asked for tenders after publishing detailed
guidelines, holding public meetings, and consulting patients and health
professionals.
The debate became polarised with Cumnock and Mauchline as the options.
Mr Jim Donaldson, chairman of the health board, said: ''I would pay
tribute to all NHS staff, GPs, local authorities, and the health council
who have earnestly and honourably contributed to improving services for
the people of East Ayrshire.
''I would make it clear that in any tender process there must be a
loser but both trusts remain preferred suppliers of services for the
people of Ayrshire and Arran.
''We were impressed by the innovative approach of the community trust
bid and the costs within which the service will be delivered.''
Tenders for building the hospital will now be published and Mrs Bates
pledged yesterday that the first patient will be treated by November of
next year -- well within board guidelines.
The new hospital will have 74 beds providing in-patient and day care
and will be the first in Scotland to introduce the results of research
into the care and treatment of dementia.
The introduction of a 24-bed medium acute unit for general
practitioner use will be another innovation.
Community trust chief executive Hugh Sutherland said: ''This is great
news for the hard-working team which has strived to present the best
case.
''More importantly it is great news for the people of East Ayrshire
who will have a world-class hospital on their doorstep.''
One of the first jobs of the trust will be to persuade GPs who had
favoured Ballochmyle to co-operate and talks are to begin within weeks.
Mrs Bates also said that the ''door is open to everyone'', making it
clear that staff from Ballochmyle should look to Cumnock as a possible
new employer.
South Ayrshire Trust chief executive Donald McNeill said: ''Naturally
I am disappointed as we had a plan which was just as innovative and cost
effective and was on a site which has been associated with health care
for generations.
''I am pleased that local people will at long last have the modern
facilities they deserve.''

''WHAT Brian did was wrong but Brian is neither crazy or unbalanced.''
The sentence, spoken with vehemence, was uttered last night by Mrs May
MacKinnon, breaking her silence for the first time since her son's
double life came to light nearly a fortnight ago.
For the 70-year-old former psychiatric nurse it has been a long 12
days. Her small, four-room Bearsden home has been under virtual siege by
the media, the curtains pinned together against camera lenses.
She says she has had no more than an hour's sleep a night and there
have been many, many tears as her son has related his extraordinary
story to The Herald.
As details of Brian's deception and the motives behind it have
emerged, Mrs MacKinnon is absolutely adamant she never knew her son was
pretending to be a 17-year-old during his year at Beardsen Academy.
The first Mrs MacKinnon says she knew of her son's double life was
when a package addressed to Brandon Lee was delivered to neighbours
after her son had begun his studies at Dundee University. With the
deception revealed, she says she and her son discusssed what had been
happening and that she was very angry.
''We knew what was what but what mother is going to tell on their son.
I told him there was never any deceit in our house. I was angry but it
was up to Brian to sort it out.''
Mrs MacKinnon says that her interest in her son's career was motivated
only by a desire to see Brian happy: ''Brian told me when he was 15 that
he wanted to be a doctor. I never told my children what to do. He was
the kind of child that never caused me any heartache.
''The first heartache I remember came in 1980 when Brian became ill
and I knew it was ME.''
Then Brian fell sick and failed his Glasgow University exams. With any
shred of hope of Brian continuing his studies at Dundee now over, Mrs
MacKinnon is left to consider her and her son's future.
''What I want for Brian now is whatever will bring him happiness.
That's all I've wanted.''

THE Scottish Football Association has become embroiled in a row over
the rights to broadcast live radio commentary from Scotland's friendly
against Sweden in Gothenburg next month.
In most cases, under a reciprocal arrangement between international
broadcasting companies, the home country retains the broadcasting
rights, effectively meaning that no charge is made to visiting
broadcasters for coverage of the match.
However, The Herald has learned that the SFA, which has an annual
turnover of several million pounds, has secured the TV and radio rights
for coverage of Scotland's full international match in Sweden on
Wednesday, October 11.
It is understood that the football chiefs initially demanded that BBC
Radio Scotland and Radio Clyde pay #10,000 each for the privilege of
providing a live commentary. This was later reduced to #7500 after flat
refusals by the radio stations.
Although negotiations between the parties are still continuing, The
Herald understands that BBC Radio Scotland sport is, under some duress,
likely to table an offer of #750, ''because they feel they owe it to
supporters to cover the match''.
The game has taken on extra significance, given that it is likely to
be one of Scotland's last before next year's European Championship
finals in England, for which the Scots will qualify if they beat San
Marino at Hampden next month.
SFA commercial director, Mr Bill Wilson, confirmed last night that the
SFA had requested radio and television rights into Scotland in return
for agreeing to play the game in Sweden.
He said: ''If we play anywhere in the world or if some team comes here
to play we often reach agreement to pay hotel bills or some of the air
tickets.''
The practice of requesting radio and TV rights was ''not uncommon'' in
friendly matches, he claimed, although UEFA stipulated that the home
team held the rights in competitive matches.
Mr Wilson refused to comment on what any deal would cost, although did
confirm that the SFA had agreed a package with BBC Scotland to show
television highlights of the game on the night of October 11.
Mr Wilson said he had spoken to BBC Radio Scotland about the match but
he did not appear confident about reaching any agreement.
Mr Douglas Wernham, head of BBC Radio Scotland sport, said any
negotiations between the BBC and the SFA were confidential.
He would say only: ''It is unusual in radio terms for us to be dealing
with the SFA for a match that is being played outside the UK.
''There is normally a reciprocal arrangement between the participating
countries. That has been the way it has operated in the past.''
No-one from Radio Clyde was available for comment last night.

DOUNREAY is to reprocess 52 rods of spent nuclear fuel from a German
research reactor between January and March and is looking for other
foreign contracts, it was confirmed last night.
The fuel rods from the Hann Meitner Institute, in Berlin, which will
be contained in two large flasks, represent a tiny fraction of the spent
nuclear fuel in research reactors, in Europe and around the world, which
has been waiting for shipment back to its country of origin -- the US --
for storage.
It is believed that there are 15,000 such rods stockpiled, leaving
many of the reactors with acute storage problems.
Until 1988, the US Department of Energy was happy to accept the
cargoes but, following opposition, there was a change of policy and
environmental impact assessments had to be completed before any would be
allowed in.
In 1993, the DoE successfully persuaded Congress to waive this
requirement because of the pressing need of six European reactors to
find a host for their waste.
This summer, the DoE embarked on an extensive public consultation
programme but the Hann Meitner Institute could not wait any longer.
The SNP's environment spokesperson Roseanna Cunningham MP said last
night: ''If this waste comes to Scotland, it will be because nobody else
wants it. It is a disgrace that while countries such as the US are
prepared to listen to their people, there is no question of consultation
here.
''As a powerless nation, Scotland is being turned into the nuclear
dustbin of the world.''
A spokesman for the Atomic Energy Authority at Dounreay said last
night: ''We have been doing this work for 30 years. It is part of our
normal activity.
''We had a campaign planned for the MTR reprocessing plant between
January and March anyway, so the 52 rods will fit in with that. There is
no question of storing nuclear waste.''

ISRAELI Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO leader Yasser Arafat
yesterday signed a West Bank accord hailed as a big step toward closing
''the circle of peace'' in the Middle East.
Mr Arafat, who fought in his first war against Israel as a teenager in
1948, and Rabin, an Israeli brigade commander in that war, signed a
400-page agreement giving Palestinians self-rule in most of the West
Bank at the White House.
Standing alongside a beaming President Bill Clinton, who stands to
gain considerable domestic political lustre from US mediation of this
accord, the two then duplicated the famous ice-breaking handshake they
exchanged two years ago in signing a declaration of peace principles at
the White House.
''This historic interim step . . . demonstrates the irreversibility of
the peace process,'' said Mr Arafat.
Mr Rabin said: ''Just two years ago only poets dreamed of (this
day),'' adding that Israel had decided to ''yield'' territory seized by
its forces in the 1967 war so it could live with Palestinians as
neighbours and despite bitter opposition from Israeli settlers.
A row over redeploying Israeli troops around the West Bank city of
Hebron had briefly delayed the signing of the accord.
US special Middle East envoy Mr Dennis Ross interrupted the Oval
Office meeting to tell Mr Clinton of the dispute. The president took Mr
Rabin and Mr Arafat into an anteroom where he successfully urged them to
settle it.--Reuter.

THE prospect of a golden age of breakthroughs in cancer treatment over
the next 25 years was held out by a research charity yesterday.
No sooner had the National Lottery finally turned to medical charities
and announced: ''It could be you'' but the Imperial Cancer Research Fund
was setting out its stall.
About 70,000 lives each year could be saved over the next 25 years if
many of the innovations currently in the pipeline come to fruition, said
the fund.
Their report, Our Vision for Cancer 1995-2020, is not explicitly a
plea for cash but a spokesman for the fund acknowledged: ''Obviously,
the more money we get the more we will be able to do.''
Cancer kills more than 166,000 people in the UK every year and, as
people live increasingly longer, this is expected to rise to 222,000 by
the year 2020 if left unchecked.
However, their report sets out how innovations, health promotion, and
reorganisation of treatment can reduce this by one third.

* The bridge was used last night to allow an ambulance to return to
the island after having taken a patient to Inverness. An ambulance
service spokesman said: ''The ferry had gone off and it was vital that
the ambulance returned to its post, so we asked if it could go over the
bridge.''

NEARLY three-quarters of a million children under 14 are left at home
alone after school or during holidays, a charity said yesterday.
Researchers, commissioned by The Suzy Lamplugh Trust, also found that
nearly 60% of parents were happy to leave 12 to 14-year-olds alone for
up to an hour.
The findings, which reveal a new generation of latchkey kids, also
show that 12% think it reasonable to leave eight to 11-year-olds alone
for an hour.
Most of the adults, in 1000 homes, questioned by NOP thought wrongly
that there was a law stating a minimum age for children to be home
alone.
The results of the survey were released to coincide with the launch of
a safety campaign, by the trust, aimed at children on their own.
The campaign's central message is featured in a video for eight to
11-year-olds, which the charity says is the first to tackle children's
personal safety.
The 20-minute video, Home Safe, shows two children talking about how
they tackle the journey home from school and arrive to an empty flat.
Charity director Mrs Diana Lamplugh said the campaign would help
youngsters to learn about safety and ease parents' fears about their
children when they are out on their own.
''We can't frighten children into being safe. A different approach is
needed. However many 'don'ts' we throw at children, this alone will not
keep them safe. They must be involved in a learning process and practise
making decisions for themselves.''
Mrs Lamplugh added: ''I think parents should be reassured, however.
It's not really as bad as headlines make out.
''It is very rare that children are attacked by a stranger. It is more
often someone they know or think they know.''
Chief Inspector Bill Croft, from the Home Office Crime Prevention
Centre, said: ''The object is to replace fear with confidence. It's that
confidence that makes a big difference in the quality of life.''
The video, which comes with a guidance booklet for parents, costs
#8.50 and is available from SLT Home Safe, PO Box 420, Wetherby,
Yorkshire LS23 7LP.
According to the charity Barnados, parents worry as much about danger
from strangers as about busy roads.
The latest figures from the Policy Studies Institute appear to back
this up: in 1971, 80% of seven and eight-year-olds went to school
without an adult. In 1990, this figure dropped to just 9%.

EXCLUSIVE
BRIAN MacKinnon's dreams of pursuing a medical career finally were
shattered last night when Dundee University informed him he would not be
readmitted to its medical school.
In a terse letter, Professor Denis McDivitt, dean of the Medical
Faculty, said he had considered carefully Mr MacKinnon's case and
informally consulted colleagues, before reaching his decision.
Making a clear criticism of Mr MacKinnon's actions in creating the
fake persona Brandon Lee and pretending to be a 17-year-old pupil to sit
his Highers, the professor said integrity was a key factor in
determining suitability for the medical profession.
''It is clear that your place in the medical school at Dundee was
obtained, by your own admission, using false information,'' he states.
The dean was also critical of Mr MacKinnon's letter of explanation to
Dundee University, which said he had been forced to drop out of medical
school originally because of illness and the uncaring attitude of
Glasgow University.
Professor McDivitt said: ''. . . your letter to medical school and
your account in The Herald omitted important facts which might have been
thought to be to your disadvantage -- to the extent that the University
of Glasgow found it necessary to hold a press conference to correct the
public record.''
The professor went on to say that the public expect the medical
profession to exhibit both knowledge and integrity and that the
university medical school was obliged to take those standards into
account when selecting candidates for training.
''Taking all these circumstances into account,'' he added, ''I have to
inform you that I am not willing to readmit you to the medical course in
October, 1995.''
Mr MacKinnon had dropped out of first year at Dundee University
medical school last December after he had run out of funds. However, he
had successfully reapplied for admission and was expected to restart his
course next Monday.
Last night, Mr MacKinnon said the university's decision caused him
''neither surprise nor bitterness''.
''On the possibility of readmission, the dean and his colleagues would
appear to have collectively found their position untenable; just as I
have found mine over a period of 14 years.''
He denied that his letter to the university or his account in The
Herald had omitted important facts.
He also said claims that he was an obsessive who bombarded Glasgow
University Senate with letters begging readmission were inaccurate:
''The reality was that I wrote one letter, ran duplicates on the
photocopier, and distributed it to all members of the Senate -- about
180 as I recall.''
On the issue of whether someone who had lied about his identity could
ever be trusted to become a doctor, Mr MacKinnon said: ''Conrad wrote of
honour as being 'unassailable and indefinable'. Integrity seems to me to
be a similar concept.''
Mr MacKinnon said the desire to study medicine would always be with
him but ''realistically it now seems that I never will''.
Professor McDivitt was also critical of Mr MacKinnon's decision to
communicate with the university through The Herald, which he described
as ''entirely inappropriate''. The Herald delivered Mr MacKinnon's
letter of explanation to the university on Tuesday. Its text was
published in full that day.
Mr MacKinnon and his mother, May, left their Bearsden home earlier
this week to escape media pressure. Because their home remained under
siege, and it was considered impossible for them to return, a
representative of the newspaper collected the university's response and
delivered it, unopened, to Mr MacKinnon.
''That I chose to communicate with the university through The Herald
was a matter of necessity,'' Mr McKinnon said. ''It was impossible for
me to reply to the university from within my house after days of
constant pressure and I had no means of communication. I therefore chose
the only way I could to deal with the situation.''

THE director of the National Lottery Charities Board in Scotland, Mr
John Rafferty, last night made it clear that it would not just be
''those who shout loudest'' who would get most from lottery funds.
In a wide-ranging speech to more than 300 charity workers in
Edinburgh, Mr Rafferty spoke up for the ''voices who were not heard'' in
the fight to get lottery cash.
His comments came as he revealed that medical charities, many of whom
had complained loud and long that the board had forgotten them, would be
allowed to apply from next spring.
Mr Rafferty, addressing members at a major conference arranged by the
Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations, in New Parliament House,
Edinburgh, said #17m had been set aside for the first-phase
poverty-linked lottery grants, with the successful bids being made
public on October 23.
He added that 1200 applications had been received at a value of #217m,
which showed that demand had far exceeded supply.
Mr Rafferty went on to say that, unlike England, where charity lottery
board chiefs are currently concerned that some applications are
fraudulent, there was no reason to believe that any of the applications
in Scotland had been in any way irregular.
Mr Rafferty, making his first major public speech since he was
appointed director earlier this year, went on to spell out his thoughts
on future charity funding and his views on the amount of money from
lottery tickets which goes to charity.
He said: ''Let me say that the board has made, and will continue to
make, every effort to ensure that it is even-handed in dealing with the
voluntary sector.
''As you would expect, we will ensure that it is not just those who
shout loudest who get most. We are aware that for every one of the siren
voices, which understandably seeks to promote its own particular part of
the sector, there are many others whose voices are not heard. All of
their applications will be assessed and judged with justice and
equity.''
On the controversial subject of the amount of cash from lottery
tickets which go to charity, Mr Rafferty said: ''There is one clear
message we all need to articulate about the public's support of
charities.
''That is, if people want to give money to charity then they should
give money to charity. If, however, they are going to buy lottery
tickets, then they should do so in the knowledge that from every ticket
5.6 pence will come to us and will be disbursed fairly to high-quality
projects in the voluntary sector.''
He went on to announce the future plans for the next five grant rounds
over the coming 18 months in Scotland.
Mr Rafferty said the lottery charities board would monitor
continuously and analyse the effectiveness of the grants system.
Throughout Britain, charity lottery boards have more than #200m to
dole out and have already received 15,000 applications for grants
totalling more than #2400m.
Last night, there was a positive reaction to the decision to allow
medical charities and other groups to apply for lottery grants.
The general secretary of the Association of Medical Research
Charities, Ms Diana Garnham, said she was delighted that the board had
now given organisations a cash timetable.
Ms Eleanor Logan, of the Lothian branch of Epilepsy Scotland, said it
would be applying for a grant to refurbish its new offices.

THE tolls set for small commercial vehicles crossing the Skye Bridge
will mean 300% increases for local tradesmen, small businesses, and
crofters, Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise will tell the Scottish Office
today.
In response to the criticism, the bridge company chairman suggested
they should buy estate cars to avoid the extra charge on the bridge
which opens in just over two weeks' time.
Sir Iain Noble recently said he did not think the problem was too
serious. He declared: ''They can always swop the van for an estate
vehicle, if it makes that much difference. I don't think this is a major
hiccup.
''I guess it must have been overlooked at the time of the public
inquiry and when the Act of Parliament (for the privately financed toll
bridge) was drawn up.''
Anti-bridge campaigners are calling on MPs and other public figures to
boycott the opening ceremony which is to be performed by Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald said last night that he would be
happy to oblige, while local MP Charles Kennedy declared that he hadn't
been invited.
Two weeks ago, Skye Bridge Ltd announced the tolls, highlighting that
there were significant savings for cars compared to current ferry fares
of #5.40.
A car would cross the bridge for #5.20 in the summer, #4.30 in the
winter, and for #2.44 if the discount book of 10 tickets was bought. The
main loser is to be the driver of a light goods vehicle with an unladen
weight of between 1.5 and 3.5 tons.
They will now have to pay #9.80, winter and summer, and even when
purchasing a book of ten tickets, the discount still leaves them paying
#9.51. At present, such vehicles travelling on the Skye ferry are
classed as cars whose drivers can buy a book of 10 tickets for #31, or
#3.10p a crossing.
Earlier this week, the Lec met and considered many complaints from
local people about such charges. One told the Lec that the bridge
charges would be the equivalent of 25% of the costs of a worker they
could usefully employ. Other small firms expect to lose thousands of
pounds.
Lec chairman Dr Jim Hunter said yesterday that chief executive Lorne
Macleod would be having a meeting with Scottish Office officials on the
issue today.
Dr Hunter said: ''In making these representations we are responding to
the undoubted concerns that have been raised by the business community
in Skye and Lochalsh.
''Our remit is to promote business in Skye and Lochalsh. This
represents a very damaging imposition on that business community. We
will be making that clear to the Scottish Office.''
The Skye Bridge Appeal Group met yesterday and called for a boycott of
the official bridge opening on October 16, which they see as a high-cost
monopoly being imposed on the people of Skye.
Mr Kennedy said last night: ''I would love to say that I am refusing
my invitation but, unfortunately, I can't because I have not been
invited. In the apparently unlikely event of me being invited, I will be
otherwise engaged.''
Mr Macdonald, meanwhile, was in Stornoway yesterday and told The
Herald:. ''You can rest assured that I will be boycotting the opening. I
will refuse any invitation to attend and I will be urging any
representatives from the Western Isles who have been invited to do
likewise.
''Before then, Charles Kennedy and myself hope to meet the European
Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock, perhaps next week, when we will be
able to discuss these issues.''
Labour's front-bench transport spokesman Brian Wilson said that if he
turned up it would only be to demonstrate.
* The bridge was opened last night to allow an ambulance to return to
the island after having taken a patient to Inverness. An ambulance
service spokesman said: ''The ferry had gone off and it was vital that
the ambulance returned to its post, so we asked if it could go over the
bridge.''

SCOTS actor Eric Cullen, Wee Burney of Rab C Nesbitt, walked free from
court yesterday after three High Court judges gave him the chance to
rebuild his life.
The Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a nine-month jail term imposed
for indecency offences involving children, and substituted a sentence of
three years probation.
The judges made their decision after hearing of Cullen's own tragic
life as a victim of sexual abuse and blackmail.
They were told he had not worked for two years following intense
publicity about his case and had lost up to #250,000 in earnings.
After the hearing, Cullen, who spent 15 days in Barlinnie before being
released on bail pending yesterday's appeal, commented: ''All I can say
is that my faith in justice has been restored.
''Now, hopefully, everyone will get to know the truth -- that I was
more a victim than anything. I have been sexually abused since the age
of 13. Today that is finished.''
His solicitor, Mr George More said: ''Eric Cullen is very relieved
that the case is over now. He is also grateful for the considerate way
that the judges dealt with his case.''
Broadcaster Bill McFarlan, a close friend of the actor, commented:
''Eric's got a lot of rebuilding to do. The first thing he has got to
rebuild is his health, which has been destroyed by this. Once he has
rebuilt his health he can rebuild his self respect and once he has done
that he can think about acting again.''
Mr Cullen was jailed at Hamilton Sheriff Court earlier this year after
he admitted four charges -- being in possession of indecent photographs
and videos of children, taking indecent photographs of two children,
exposing himself to one of them, and taking indecent video pictures of
children undressing.
Yesterday, Mr Brian McConnachie, defence counsel, told the court that
his client was 30 and suffered from a condition that stunted his growth
to the height of an eight or nine-year old.
From the age of 13, he became the victim of systematic and serious
sexual abuse at the hands of his uncle and another man, paedophile
Francis Currens, who is serving a 14-year sentence.
The abuse continued until Cullen was 19 or 20.
Very much against the odds, he broke into acting and became a
celebrity but his new- found fame was to prove his undoing. His uncle
and Currens were able to find him again and started to blackmail him.
Because of his fame, Cullen felt he had to comply.
That was why he agreed to store the indecent videos involved in one of
the charges, which belonged to Currens.
A police search of Cullen's home effectively ruined him completely.
Somehow, the media became aware of the details and the actor was wrongly
branded as a child molester.
Since the day of the police raid in August 1993, he had not worked at
all and, the following October, suffered a severe mental breakdown for
which he is still receiving treatment.
Mr McConnachie said that, according to medical reports, Cullen was not
a danger to children.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, who heard the appeal with Lords
Weir and Wylie, said Mr McConnachie had presented the court with a very
persuasive argument.
There was no getting away from the fact that it was deplorable and
unacceptable for anyone to behave in the way that Cullen had done. It
was disgraceful for anyone to take indecent photographs of children.
However, it was significant that there had been nothing in the nature
of physical contact with the children and, as far as the court could
see, they had not suffered permanent damage.
Lord Ross added: ''Any sentence must fit the offence but it must also
fit the offender. Having regard to what we have already said about Mr
Cullen's life, we have come to the conclusion that it was not in this
case either necessary or appropriate to impose a custodial sentence.''
The court was prepared to place Cullen on probation for three years on
condition that he continue to receive medical treatment.
Cullen said later: ''I am grateful that the probation order carries
with it the condition of psychiatric treatment. I do not know how long
it will take to regain my health after the sexual abuse I have
suffered.''
Cullen believes that with proper help he can perhaps reach some
understanding about the abuse, to ''leave it in the past and not have it
dragged up all the time''.
He added: ''The message I would give through my story to every
youngster is that if you are being sexually abused scream about it --
shout it from the rooftops. Everyone should be more compassionate about
victims of sexual abuse.''
Mr McFarlan, Cullen's closest supporter, said that after the case, an
approach had been made to the Lord Advocate, who had expressed interest
in learning more detail about a briefing given by the police to
journalists on January 16, 1995.
The Lord Advocate was also being asked questions by Eric Cullen's
defence team about whether the information passed to the police by
Cullen alleging abuse had been acted upon or was being acted upon.

Carlings say they need 'space and peace'
ENGLAND rugby captain Will Carling and his wife of 14 months, Julia,
are separating on a temporary basis, it was disclosed last night.
The 29-year-old sports star and his wife issued a statement through
Colin Herridge, the Rugby Union's media liaison officer, which said:
''Will Carling announced with regret tonight that he and his wife Julia
have agreed to spend some time apart.
''They both believe that they need space and some peace for the time
being.
''They want to emphasise that nobody else is involved and they hope
that by allowing themselves time apart to reflect, they will be able to
get back together as soon as possible.''
Carling married Julia shortly after returning from England's tour of
South Africa last year.
He had already become the most well-known face in European rugby
through his sporting exploits, but in recent weeks he has hit the front
pages through his friendship with the Princess of Wales.
That began when they both attended the same gym in west London.
Last night's announcement comes after constant media reports that he
had enjoyed secret meetings with the princess.
After the initial revelations of a ''close friendship'', Carling
announced he would not be seeing the princess again -- and his TV
presenter wife warned she would have a fight on her hands.
But last Sunday, further reports indicated that Carling and the
princess may have met again at an exclusive London gym, although this
was strongly denied.
The England captain stressed he had not seen the princess and their
presence at the gym at the same had been purely conincidental. Other
reports alleged they had accidentally met on the stairs.
Carling has captained England in two World Cups and led his country a
total 53 times -- a world record -- with 40 victories along the way.
Although he has had a successful start to the season with Harlequins,
there has been controversy over the delay in reappointing him captain.
On Wednesday an England squad was named without the familiar word
captain alongside Carling's name and manager Jack Rowell has
deliberately delayed naming a leader for the Test against South Africa
at Twickenham in November.
The relationship between Carling and a member of the royal family has
sparked enormous press coverage -- which on Wednesday produced a
memorably witty limerick from the princess.
At a London literary lunch, she showed her poetic talents -- joking
that she had made time ''between therapy sessions and secret trysts'' to
compose her verse and answer her critics.
The princess told guests at the Literary Review lunch, hosted by
writer Auberon (Bron) Waugh, how she felt very privileged to be allowed
to join ''a highly exclusive gathering of intellects''.
''Apparently, some people are wondering what Diana, that notorious
illiterate, is doing at a distinguished scholarly occasion such as
this,'' she said.
''So I've made time between therapy sessions and secret trysts to
attempt to reply.''
Then, to applause and laughter, the Princess read her poem:
The Princess was heard to declare,
Let gossips poke fun if they dare.
My real inspiration
is Bron's invitation,
Stick that in your tabloids, so there.
Guests at the Cafe Royal lunch included Lord Rothermere, Sir Tim Rice,
William Rushton, Harry Enfield, Dominic Lawson, Alexander Chancellor,
Lynn Barber, Lord Gowrie and the Duke of Devonshire.
The Carlings have spent the past few weeks dodging the press camped
outside their home.
Yesterday both the princess and Mrs Carling appeared in public at
separate engagements, just hours before the announcement.
The princess was attending an air display at RAF Wittering in
Cambridgeshire in her role as honorary Air Commodore.
Mrs Carling, meanwhile, brushed aside the problems in her private life
to face dozens of journalists at the launch of a beauty product at the
Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
She made a brief reference to worry lines and even the princess in a
45-minute presentation, but refused to be drawn on her marriage.
Will Carling was seen leaving his home at about 5.30pm with several
bags of luggage.

A MAN who bit off a police officer's ear after he was arrested was
ordered to pay his victim #7500 in compensation yesterday.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Clyde also sentenced Thomas
Bennett, 25, to two years' probation and ordered him to carry out 200
hours' unpaid work in the community.
Surgeons operated 10 times on Sergeant Iain Bell, 38, to try to
reconstruct his left ear using silicone compounds.
Bennett of Western Road, Carronshore, Falkirk, Stirlingshire, admitted
assaulting Mr Bell -- since promoted to inspector -- in Marshall Place,
Perth, on January 2 last year to his severe injury and permanent
disfigurement.
He also admitted assaulting another police officer, Constable David
Rankine, by biting him on the hand and assaulting a taxi driver, Mr
Colin Stewart, by punching him and knocking him to the ground.
Bennett, a builder, admitted the offences earlier when he appeared at
the High Court in Forfar but the case was continued until yesterday for
reports.
The court had been told that the trouble began when Bennett called a
taxi to a Perth pub and started arguing with the driver, who called on
Mr Stewart for assistance.
Bennett ran off but was caught by three police officers. In the police
car, he suddenly pounced on Mr Bell and mauled his ear, biting Mr
Rankine as he tried to pull him off.
Mr Bell was taken to Perth Royal Infirmary, where it was discovered
that a large part of his left ear was missing. His colleagues found the
missing piece and Mr Bell was taken to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee,
where he underwent an operation to sew it back on.
Bennett's defence solicitor-advocate, Mr Joe Beltrami said: ''My
client is a Christian, God-fearing man and simply cannot account for his
actions.''
It was claimed that Bennett's drink had been spiked with the drug
Temazepam.
Mr Beltrami said Bennett has spent 17 weeks in custody -- the
equivalent of an eight-month sentence -- and had sold his car and other
items to raise the #7500 which he offered to pay as compensation to his
victim.
Mr Beltrami said: ''He is most regretful and contrite about this whole
matter.''
The judge said that, in the cicrcumstances, he was prepared to place
Bennett on probation for two years. He gave Bennett 14 days to hand over
the #7500 compensation to Mr Bell.
