AGRICULTURE Minister William Waldegrave will today try to bring other
European Union countries round to Britain's point of view about banning
the crating of live calves.
He is due to meet other Farm Ministers in Brussels this afternoon when
he will call formally on the European Commission to speed up a review of
the practice, which is already banned in the United Kingdom.
Mr Waldegrave will also ask Ministers to re-examine journey times for
the 500,000 live calves transported from Britain to the Continent each
year. Many of them are destined for veal crates.
''I shall call on my colleagues to think again how we can ban this
harsh and much-disliked form of production,'' he told the incoming
European Farm Commissioner, Mr Franz Fischler of Austria, who begins his
duties today when the commission of Mr Jacques Delors formally hands
over to the enlarged commission of Mr Jacques Santer for the next five
years.
The crisis over animal welfare protests and demonstrations in the UK
will dominate today's meeting, with British officials promising a
''stirring'' statement from the troubled Mr Waldegrave.
He is determined that the trouble and growing number of arrests at
southern English ports should not halt legal British trade with the
Continent, but he has recognised that protests involve legitimate public
concern.
He wants the trade to continue uninterrupted, but for more animals to
be exported as meat instead of on the hoof.
Live animals which continue to be exported should go to destinations
where they will be treated humanely, he will argue.
The issue of journey times from British farms to Continental
slaughterhouses is a matter for the council. Britain wants the rules
tightened, and officials in Brussels are reporting growing support for
the UK line.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the new Transport Commissioner, is likely to be asked
by the council for his views on journey times. He has said he favours
applying the length of drivers' rest breaks to their animals. This would
mean more feeding and watering breaks for animals in transit.
* The carcase of a calf with its throat cut has been dumped at the
home of a leading animal welfare campaigner.
The victim, a woman who has asked not to be named, found the calf this
morning at her home near Llandyssul, Dyfed.
She believes she was picked out for action after being seen giving a
television interview during a recent demonstration at Swansea Airport to
prevent the export of calves. Police are investigating.

Confusion over rail privatisation has created anger and uncertainty
among councils engaged in improving rail services, as John MacCalman
discovers
THE spectre of rail privatisation is haunting Scottish local
authorities concerned about promoting better services.
Many senior councillors and officials are outraged at the thought of
using public money to enhance assets that are likely to be stripped by
the on-rushing privateers of Railtrack and the new rolling stock
companies (ROSCOS).
On the other hand, would-be rail franchise operators are desperately
seeking Government guarantees of future subsidies for privatised
services free from social responsibility. Without subsidies
privatisation doesn't seem to stack up in terms of profitability.
The confusion generated by the Government's railway privatisation Act
has been considerable.
There appears to be two schools of thought regarding the 1993 Railways
Act. On the one hand there is a view that it is the most Machiavellian
piece of legislation yet, designed to destroy the British railway
system, and reflecting the Conservative Party's well-known antipathy to
public railways -- or was that just Mrs Thatcher's position?
On the other hand some believe that the Act is the biggest legislative
cock-up in British political history, and that the Government is still
working through the implications and making the necessary adjustments as
it goes along.
''I tend towards the latter view,'' says Councillor Charles Gordon,
chairman of Strathclyde's roads and transportation committee.
Councillor Gordon remains puzzled as to why ScotRail and all the other
bits of British Rail are now being split into so many separate companies
-- variously operating services, owning track and/or stock, overseeing
signals and running stations as well as designing trains -- particularly
since senior Government sources have acknowledged the success of
Strathclyde's integrated suburban railway, the biggest outside London.
With all of the new parts charging full commercial rates, the new
train-operating companies are likely to be squeezed ''until the pips
squeak''.
Strathclyde region subsidises suburban rail services, under Section 20
of the 1968 Transport Act, to the tune of #33m per year.
With the passage of the Railways Act on April 1, 1994, British Rail
was split up and that subsidy, for the same level of service, went up
from #33m to #112m. This is because Railtrack owns the track and it
applies access charges to ScotRail for running trains, and for using
stations.
The difference between the #33m last year and the #112m this year is
being funded by the Government through a special grant called the
Metropolitan Rail Grant. The Government has also confirmed that grant
will also be available in the next financial year. However, there are no
guarantees that Metropolitan Rail Grant will continue beyond that.
In terms of capital investment, the regional council over the past 18
years has invested #400m (at today's prices) in stations, track, rolling
stock, and electrification.
On April 1 last year all of these assets were transferred to the
ownership of Railtrack or to the rolling stock companies.
However, a specially drafted Deed of Assumption will turn those
historic assets into loans. This means Railtrack and the ROSCOS will pay
back to Strathclyde region the outstanding loan debt, currently running
at #150m.
''What the Government is doing is creating a monopoly with Railtrack.
And there's a related issue there. Railtrack's costs for capital
projects are becoming hugely inflated,'' an angry Councillor Gordon
says.
''They have told us, for example, that the civil engineering works for
our CrossRail project -- which will link north and south electrics --
will now be #38m and not #25m as previously stated.
''This is because Railtrack is behaving like a commercial organisation
and they are taking the view that because they are responsible for
safety on the railway, we must use them for design, we must use them for
project management, we must use them for contracting works -- and they
will take their overhead.
''Any time you phone them to make a minor change, the phone call will
get logged and fancy commercial prices applied.''
Where before PTE executives sat down with ScotRail engineers and
discussed what was to be done within reasonable cost parameters, the
same sort of consultation has been transformed into a very hard-headed
business relationship.
Urgent investigation is now under way to find out how Railtrack
arrives at certain costings, reflecting some disquiet over its position
as the monopoly supplier of project management and design.
''Why can't we have design put out to competitive tender?'' Councillor
Gordon asks.
His concern is that in future cash-starved councils could decide they
could not contemplate certain projects because they couldn't hope to
meet the new scale of charges.
Predictably the Government's attitude is that British Rail must have
been undercharging in the past -- a view rejected by the Strathclyde
region and the regional Passenger Transport Executive who do not accept
that British Rail's charges were cheap.
Since the council's capital budget is subject to external constraints,
there is an urgent requirement to ''get to grips with Railtrack'' and
work out a formula for arriving at realistic cost estimates and keeping
budgets under control.
This is also going to be a priority with the train operators who could
find themselves under extreme financial pressure because of the charges
being levied by Railtrack and the rolling stock companies.
Councillor Gordon suspects the Government may be beating a retreat on
the franchises and seeking a quick bonanza from flotation of Railtrack
and the ROSCOS to fund pre-election ''bribes''.
He claims: ''The train operating companies are not going to sign up
for franchises without certain guarantees being in place, and the
Government aren't going to give them these guarantees.
''My guess would be that we'll be left, not with franchises, but a
weakened and Balkanised, residual British Rail which will be screwed on
a daily basis by a privatised Railtrack and the privatised ROSCOS.
''The revenue stream derived by Railtrack and the ROSCOS will
comprise, in the main, subsidies supplied by the taxpayer to British
Rail to provide a service; so these are not true profits, these are
bloody subsidies.''
Councillor Gordon can also foresee a great deal of ducking and weaving
over timetables as operators strive desperately to make a profit in the
face of ''horrendous'' costs imposed by Railtrack and the ROSCOS.
For example, Councillor Gordon explains, an operator might be working
a short route using three sets of trains. By ''mucking about'' with the
timetable to its commercial advantage, but not to the passengers'
advantage, it could attempt to save money by using only two sets of
trains.
Councillor Gordon maintains: ''It means that unless they (the
privatised train operators) see enough flexibility in the timetable and
the fares to make profits, and unless Government subsidies are
guaranteed throughout the length of the franchise, no-one in their right
mind is going to sign up for a franchise.
''The various train operating companies have come to the same
conclusion as ourselves. The Government might have an April timescale
for franchising, but we just don't see it. It doesn't stack up unless
the Government makes some guarantees.''
There must now be serious doubts, says Councillor Gordon, that a
successful franchisee would use profitable routes to subsidise less
profitable rural or socially necessary routes. What is commercially
convenient to the operator would not necessarily be convenient to the
travelling public.
Councillor Gordon concludes: ''This is not a true privatisation. It's
the transfer of public subsidy from the public sector to a series of
privateers who are going to be guaranteed a diet of public subsidy, who
will have the freedom to take commercial decisions to the detriment of
the customer. We'll get the worst of both worlds.
''This is all about the Government's hatred of the public sector and
its love of privatisation for privatisation's sake.''
Public money on the line
IN comparison with Strathclyde, the railway investment of other
regional authorities in Scotland has been relatively modest.
Nevertheless there is a general concern among the authorities that any
future investment might be ill-advised against the backdrop of muddled
rail privatisation legislation.
* In LOTHIAN, over the past nine years, the regional council has
invested #3.2m in a number of projects, including electrification of the
Edinburgh-North Berwick line and the construction of nine new railway
stations, the latest of which is Wallyford.
For the future, the council is considering involvement in a #25m
project to reopen the Edinburgh suburban line to passengers. It
currently carries freight. This would constitute a major step in
alleviating Edinburgh's chronic traffic problems, but the advent of
privatisation and the attendant access charges are having a big impact
on the thinking over the new line.
A council source said: ''Privatisation puts a very difficult slant on
some of these projects, particularly in the absence of any Eastern
Transport Executive. It would be a major inhibitor. Track access charges
would be a significant factor.''
Other proposals with Lothian involvement include the provision of new
stations at Park, within the Gyle industrial development area, and
Gogar.
These are important because they are both in the west of Edinburgh
where there is a significant traffic problem. The new stations
constitute a major part of the integrated transport strategy aimed at
encouraging people to leave their cars at home for city trips.
There are also new stations proposed at Bathgate East, Winchburgh and
Broxburn.
* In TAYSIDE the regional council has agreed it would give support to
services if ScotRail were to increase the number of train stops at
Carnoustie.
A council spokesman said: ''We'd consider underwriting an improved
Carnoustie-Dundee commuter rail service, but no figure has been attached
to this at present.''
* In CENTRAL, over the past 10 to 15 years, the regional council has
spent just over #2m on rail-related projects. This includes the new
#950,000 Camelon rail station, just outside Falkirk, which was opened in
October and wholly funded by the region. Trains on the Glasgow to
Falkirk (Grahamston) and the Edinburgh to Dunblane lines make regular
stops at Camelon. Closed circuit TV has also been installed for
security.
In 1985 Central paid half the cost of the reopening of Bridge of Allan
station and also contributed to the improvement of all nine stations in
the region. Improvements included new buildings, car parks, landscaping,
stone-cleaning, and a new footbridge at Dunblane station.
While the region does not subsidise actual services, it spends
#180,000 a year on concessionary travel for the elderly and disabled.
People in these categories get half-price rail travel to stations within
Central region, as well as Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, Oban, and Fort
William.
* In FIFE the regional council has plans to invest #9m in rolling
stock, and construct three new railway stations in the west of Fife.
The necessary borrowing consent has been received from the Scottish
Office but the council has expressed fears about privatisation.
* In DUMFRIES and GALLOWAY there is no revenue support for services
but the regional council has made capital contributions towards station
improvements, and more recently has been involved in the funding of two
new stations.
Gretna Green, costing #195,000, was funded almost entirely by the
council. It also contributed #75,000 towards the #300,000 cost of
reopening Sanquhar station and has been involved in providing better bus
links to existing train services.
* In GRAMPIAN the regional council does not give any revenue support
to rail services but is talking with ScotRail and Railtrack on the
potential for local rail services, which could require subsidy
arrangements.
On the capital side, the council has, over the past decade,
contributed about #400,000 to the upgrading of rail stations and
associated facilities.
Two of the projects involved the reopening of stations at Portlethen
and Dyce -- around Aberdeen.
* In HIGHLAND the regional council no longer gives any support for
rail transport. It used to contribute to station improvement schemes but
because of Government cutbacks, the council decided to opt out in the
current year.
In the last financial year the council contributed #63,700 towards
station improvements.
* There are no railheads in Borders region.

THE head of the Scottish Avalanche Information Service yesterday
admitted he did not have enough money to provide reports on a high-risk
area of the West Highlands where a climber was killed at the weekend
after being swept 1200ft.
The dead man's companion had, according to rescuers, a ''miraculous''
escape, suffering only broken ribs and a broken wrist.
The co-ordinator of the avalanche service which is funded by the
Scottish Office, Mr Blyth Wright, expressed concern that he was unable
to cover the avalanche-prone Torridon, Wester Ross -- an area popular
with climbers and walkers.
He also revealed that a weekend avalanche report for Lochnagar --
another popular climbing and walking area -- had been dropped because of
funding restrictions.
Trainee mountain guide Michael Clark, 27, of Anglesey, north Wales,
died on Saturday in an avalanche on the 3456ft Liathach in Torridon. Two
of the last three fatalities on the mountain have been as a result of
avalanches.
Mr Graham Frost, 24, unemployed, of Caernarfon, Gwynedd, escaped with
only broken ribs and a broken wrist.
Mr Clark was the third person to die on Scottish mountains this year.
He and Mr Frost had completed an ice climb on the Poacher's Fall route
and were making their way to the summit when a snow cornice above them
broke away, sweeping them 1200ft down the mountain.
The four others in the party, all experienced climbers, had been on a
parallel route and were abseiling down when they heard a shout for help
and found Mr Frost half-buried in snow. They dug him free and recovered
Mr Clark's body.
Two of the climbers stayed with Mr Frost while the others set off to
raise the alarm. Six hours later, Torridon and RAF Kinloss mountain
rescue teams reached them around midnight after climbing through driving
sleet, rain, and high winds. Their return journey lasted seven hours. A
RAF rescue helicopter was unable to get through because of weather
conditions.
The other party members were Mr Steven Long, 35, an outdoor
instructor, Ms Louise Squire, 22, unemployed, Mr Noel Craine, 30, a
research scientist, all of Caernarfon, and Mr Nicholas Dickson, 31, an
outdoor instructor, of Penmachro, Gwynedd.
Mr Seamus McNally, head of the Torridon mountain rescue team, said:
''The party was quite experienced and had travelled a long way. They
decided to just go for it. They were just unfortunate that the snow was
unstable when they got to the ridge.''
The Scottish Avalanche Information Service was introduced as a pilot
scheme in 1988-89 and fully established two years later. Mr Hamish
MacInnes, an international adviser on mountain rescue who was
instrumental in securing funding from the Scottish Office, said he was
convinced there had been a reduction in accidents since its
introduction.
Based at Glenmore Lodge, near Aviemore, it receives #65,000-a-year
from the Scottish Office through the Scottish Sports Council. It
provides daily reports and forecasts of avalanche conditions through the
media and at mountain resorts from mid-December to mid-April in the
Glencoe, Lochaber, and northern Cairngorms areas.
Mr Wright said: ''We seem to have made an impression on the avalanche
accident rate where we have provided a service. However, it is clearly a
source of concern to me that we are now getting an area emerging that
would appear to have a major avalanche problem but our budget does not
allow us to have a presence there.''
He said Torridon and North-west Scotland had become much more popular
with climbers in recent years, probably because of the easier access
provided by the Kessock Bridge and a new guide book published last year.
Mr Wright added: ''Unfortunately, we were unable to issue any warnings
in this area at the weekend. I have since done so after learning from
rescue team members that the avalanche conditions in the area were the
worst for many years.''

SCOTLAND rugby coach Dougie Morgan isn't the man for high-fives,
fists-in-the-air or ya-beauty exclamations in celebration of victory.
''Just very nice to get a win,'' was his powerfully understated
reaction to the observation that his side's victory over Canada must
have come as a blessed relief after those nine games in the doldrums.
But you just knew that deep inside that sweet win rated a whole lot
better than just ''nice''.
Until Saturday, the Scottish rugby triumvirate of Morgan, skipper
Gavin Hastings, and manager Duncan Paterson had fulfilled their
post-match obligations to the Fourth Estate with haggard expression and
downcast demeanour. Is it almost a year ago since a devastated Hastings
broke down on nationwide TV as he reprised the Jon Callard penalty goal
which handed England a final second, single point Calcutta Cup victory?
On Saturday, the gloom was conspicuous by its absence. Hastings
declared: ''That's a good way to start 1995. I'm delighted for all the
new boys coming in. We've put together a competent team performance and
that's us on the first rung of the ladder.''
The selectors choose the side on Tuesday to play Ireland but, in the
immediate afterglow of Saturday's success, Hastings said he would be
happy to lead the same band of happy brothers against the Irish.
''I'm always happy to lead a winning side. I said to the guys before
the game that it was up to them to make the selectors' jobs easy. By and
large they've produced that performance today,'' he said.
Morgan said that Scottish success had been based upon that old rugby
truism of making the right decisions in the right places. The positive
result had been achieved amid appalling conditions. The now totally
enclosed Murrayfield playing surface is denied the benefit of a drying
breeze and, in the wet, the park was as hazardous as he had ever seen
it.
The post-match gloom on Saturday was reserved for the Canadian camp.
Skipper Gareth Rees adopted an expression of puzzlement as he considered
the ''outrageous'' penalty tally logged against the Canucks by Welsh
referee Clayton Thomas and bemoaned his side's lack of quality
possession.
Coach Ian Birtwell, meanwhile, was pulling no punches as he labelled
his side's display ''pathetic''.
''People have made a lot of the advanced age of our players. Age isn't
a factor. Performance is the factor that counts and I thought we were
quite pathetic. I was extremely disappointed in our second-phase
possession. Gareth has been quite polite. Maybe I can deal with it more
objectively . . . we lost the ball in contact, an area where we are
characteristically strong, and that, frankly, was disastrous,'' he
declared.
For the Scots, though, and never mind the Canadians were not quite the
full international shilling, the sour statistic of nine games without a
win has been laid low. Nice. Very nice indeed.

WILSON Docherty from Condorrat aims to add to the family honours
tonight when he takes on Paisley's Michael Deveney for the vacant
British featherweight boxing title at the Forte Crest Hotel in Glasgow.
The St Andrews Sporting Club always tries to stage something special
on what is its traditional Burns Night and this should be no exception,
with Docherty out to emulate older brother Drew, who is already British
bantamweight champion and outright holder of a Lonsdale Belt, and who
fights for the WBO world championship in Cumbernauld next month.
Said the younger Docherty, who has been beaten only once -- in South
Africa -- in nine paid contests: ''Since Drew won that belt, I've been
thinking about one of my own. It would be nice for our family if we
could boast two British champions at the same time.''
That is a feat only the Feeney brothers, George and John, have
achieved in British boxing, and the form points to a win for Docherty.
Unlike the Naseem Hamed circus-like build-up to the weekend's
promotion, there has been no hype surrounding this one. Docherty and
Deveney have been friends since their days in the amateur ranks and,
although they will appear as arch-enemies during tonight's scheduled
12-rounder, it is unlikely the friendship will be affected.
Said Docherty: ''I feel good and confident. I also feel a wee bit
nervous, although that is a good sign. With all due respect to Michael,
I know I have fought and beaten better boxers, so it should all be down
to how I perform. But I'm in great shape, just ask Drew.''
I did. ''Wilson is perfect for this one -- he almost broke my nose in
sparring last week, and it's still a bit sore,'' said Drew.
Deveney said: ''I have been finding it hard to sleep properly for the
last couple of weeks, just thinking about this. It's the biggest fight
of my career and I'm as fit as I'll ever be.''
It is not an easy one to call, but I will go for a Docherty.

JAMES TRAYNOR
at Old Trafford
Manchester United 1, Blackburn Rovers 0
IT COULD have been predicted that a pulsating afternoon at Old
Trafford would end with Alex Ferguson and Kenny Dalglish in
disagreement. Adversaries of old, they generally don't require much of
an excuse to spar verbally, but yesterday's match, which was weighted
with significance for both, produced a contentious point of debate.
United were edging towards a narrow triumph when, a couple of minutes
from the end, Blackburn captain Tim Sherwood headed into Peter
Schmeichel's net only to turn and see the referee disallowing what
should have been an equaliser.
Dalglish said it was a goal and, naturally, Ferguson said the
opposite. It seemed to me Sherwood's effort was legitimate, but who I am
to get between terriers who have fierce reputations to protect south of
the Border.
Better to step aside and let them get on with it. Safer, too.
''The goal should have been allowed because there was no foul play,''
said Dalglish, ''and that's twice this season and once last season that
refereeing decisions have made the vital differences between us and
United.
''The positive thing for us, however, is that we can compete evenly
with United in terms of playing football.''
The United manager entered the post-match press conference determined
to ask the first question. ''I suppose Kenny is complaining about
something,'' he said before giving his verdict on the incident which
marred what was really a deserved victory for United.
''I've watched the replays and if Blackburn's goal had been allowed to
stand I would have been complaining about it,'' Ferguson added.
The incident which had the managers at odds occurred when Alan
Shearer, who had been largely subdued, was adjudged to have pushed his
marker, Roy Keane, inside United's box before heading the ball across
the face of goal to Sherwood, who then headed into the net.
''Before this match, Kenny Dalglish had been saying that he wanted to
see a strong referee on the pitch and so far as I am concerned he got
his wish. The referee made the right decision, but I suppose it depends
on which of us you believe,'' said Ferguson. ''I don't tell lies, do
I?''
Ferguson was certainly not distorting the truth when he said that Ryan
Giggs looked as though he is coming back to his best form. The young
Welsh internationalist had an outstanding first half and he was able to
manufacture the only goal of the game deemed legal.
Eric Cantona collected the ball just inside Blackburn's half 10
minutes from time and pushed the ball wide on the left to Giggs.
Henning Berg dispossessed the United player, but Giggs executed a
perfect sliding tackle which won him back possession, and also allowed
him to sprint towards the line before hitting a deep cross to the far
post.
Cantona had continued his run and found space between Colin Hendry and
Graeme Le Saux. The Frenchman seemed to stretch an extra half-inch out
of his neck, and Rovers Tim Flowers was beaten.
Ferguson was not speaking with a forked tongue either when he
suggested that an injustice would have been perpetrated had United been
denied the three points which closed the gap between themselves and
Blackburn, who are leading the division, to two points. United always
looked the side with the greater desire to win and they really ought to
have been ahead by half-time, but resolute defending by Colin Hendry in
particular kept them at bay.
United's #6m striker Andy Cole made his debut, but he was kept fairly
quiet, mainly because of Hendry's presence, although it might have been
different had the striker managed to take advantage of an opening
created for him after only two minutes. Brian McClair's long ball was
misjudged by Paul Warhurst, and Cole was clear with only the keeper to
beat, but the former Newcastle player swiped at the ball which flew
yards wide of the target.
He didn't get many more opportunities thereafter, but Ferguson said he
saw enough to strengthen his belief that he has purchased a player who
will score goals for United.
''Perhaps, though, we will have to change our style slightly to suit
Cole who is a different kind of front line player than Mark Hughes.''
Hopefully United won't change too much because they remain a thrilling
and inspiring sight when in full flight, as they were several times
yesterday.
Almost 44,000 customers experienced it yesterday and it is something
which must be protected and produced as often as possible. It is what
football is all about.
MANCHESTER UNITED -- Schmeichel, Keane, Irwin, Bruce, Sharpe,
Pallister, Cantona, Ince, McClair, Cole, Giggs. Substitutes -- May,
Kanchelskis, Walsh.
BLACKBURN ROVERS -- Flowers, Berg, Wright, Sherwood, Hendry, Le Saux,

VAN Cortlandt Park, in the notorious New York burgh of the Bronx, is
renowned throughout the city for its outdoor sporting facilities. Among
them is the Van Cortlandt Park golf course, now 100 years of age, making
it the oldest public course in the USA.
Ordinarily, the course is of only moderate difficulty, but it has
become more so recently thanks to a supposed error on the part of some
local building contractors. Golfers playing the par-3, 203-yard
seventeenth hole now also have to deal with a huge stretch of debris
which has been dumped there illegally over the past year. Things have
become so bad that the soil chemistry in the area has been altered, with
the result that 96 trees have died.
The American Golf Corporation, which manages the course, explained
that the dumping was ''an error on the part of one of our middle
managers'' and stated that measures would be taken to rectify the
damage.
It should be noted, though, that the American Golf Corporation also
manages another course in nearby Pelham, where detectives from New
York's auto crimes unit recently found a 1988 Honda that had been buried
near the fourteenth hole.
THE University of Nabraska had cause for considerable celebration at
the end of the collegiate football season, having claimed the national
title in a thrilling final. With that momentous event out of the way, a
handful of Nebraska players began to make headlines for other reasons.
Receiver Reggie Baul announced that he would plead guilty to,
appropriately, receiving stolen property last November; running back
Lawrence Phillips entered a plea of not guilty in connection with an
assault charge from last March; defensive lineman John Smith pleaded no
contest to a sexual assault charge from last spring, and defensive back
Tyrone Williams is awaiting trial on felony charges for allegedly
shooting a gun at an occupied car.
It has been noted in Nebraska sporting circles that none of these
players was tried or sentenced until after the football season was
completed. Of course, if the team had lost in the final they would all
be doing hard time this very minute.
THE ice hockey season began last week after being delayed because of
contract talks between the players' union and the owners. Nick Kypreos,
of the New York Rangers, duly returned to the USA to join his team and
was asked by airport customs officials if he had anything to declare.
''No,'' he replied. ''The owners took it all.''
A 'high five' for lonely viewers
AMERICANS are enthusiastic about sports, especially those they can
enjoy sitting in front of the television. However, a lone TV sports fan
misses the exuberant celebrations and camaraderie that often follow a
dramatic play.
Now an ingenius man in Troy, New York, has devised a way to bring an
element of that sideline excitement into the USA's living rooms. He has
just received a patent for a mechanical arm that attaches to a wall or
table and which will, on demand, give the viewer a 'high five' after an
exciting play.
Presumably, it will also hold your beer when you have to get up to
change the channel.
THE most sacred item in American football is the playbook. That is the
volume that contains all of each team's rehearsed manoeuvres that it
will employ for every conceivable circumstance during the game. Every
team develops their own plays, and they are all closely guarded secrets.
One assumes, therefore, that the New Orleans Saints are currently in
the process of rewriting their playbook.
John Pease, now a defensive line coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars,
was formerly in the same position with the Saints. The latter team fired
him at the end of 1994, leaving Pease disgruntled to say the least. Just
how disgruntled is illustrated by the message on his answerphone, which
offers callers copies of the Saints' playbook he took with him when he
left.

WORLD No.1 Pete Sampras staged one of the best comebacks of his career
to subdue giant Swede Magnus Larsson and keep alive his hopes of
retaining the Australian Open tennis title.
Sampras was two points away from a straight-sets defeat before hauling
himself back from the brink against the same opponent who robbed him of
the #1m first prize at the Grand Slam Cup in Munich last month.
The American's place in the last eight was finally secured 4-6, 6-7,
7-5, 6-4, 6-4 after three hours and eight minutes on centre court, only
the second time in his Grand Slam career that he has fought back from
two sets down to win.
Ninth seed Jim Courier booked a quarter-final date with Sampras by
sweeping aside the Czech Republic's Karel Novacek 6-2, 6-3, 6-2.
The American lost to Sampras in last year's semi-final, but has yet to
drop a set in the tournament and was detained for just 85 minutes as he
dominated a contest he had dubbed the ''macho match.''
Fifth seed Michael Chang, too, had little trouble against No.49-ranked
Frenchman Olivier Delaitre, disposing of France's last hope in the men's
singles 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.
If unseeded David Wheaton had removed thirteenth seed Andrei Medvedev,
of the Ukraine, it would have guaranteed an American in next Sunday's
men's final and kept alive the possibility of an all-American last eight
for the first time at a Grand Slam.
Medvedev, however, had other ideas, keeping his nerve in an agonising
fifth set to secure a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-7 (10-8) victory in three hours
27 minutes and a quarter-final meeting with Chang.
There were also some significant fourth-round matches in the women's
singles, with Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez, French contender
Mary Pierce, and the eighth-seeded Natalia Zvereva, of Belarus, all
progressing to the last eight.
Pierce beat No.10-seed Anke Huber in straight sets, but Martinez and
Zvereva were both taken to three sets by Romania's Irina Spirlea and
Japan's Kyoko Nagatsuka respectively.

IT seems that untrotterish behaviour can be habit-forming, writes Doug
Gillon. At the end of a week in which one of their number gained the
club's first full senior UK vest, Ian Harkness, of Hunters Bog Trotters,
claimed individual men's victory in the final meeting of the East of
Scotland cross-country league.
But Harkness, a chemistry research assistant at Edinburgh University,
who joined the Trotters last October after having completed his PhD at
Cambridge, had better lose the formula for success. His anti-elitist
club frowns on the pursuit of excellence, entertaining the strange
notion that sport should be fun. For them winning isn't the only thing.
Indeed, it's the only thing that doesn't matter.
Edinburgh man Harkness, a former British Universities' 5000m champion
and a 3min 48sec 1500 metres runner, was only forty-first in the second
of the three matches, but showed dramatic improvement on Saturday,
winning by 13 seconds from Frank Boyne.
There was only a minor tarnishing of the Trotters' eccentric image at
Livingston however. For this was a team contest, the climax to the East
season, and the senior honours went to Leslie Deans Racing Club, led
home by Scott Cohen in seventh place.
With only the minimum six runners on the start-line, all had to
finish, and anxious eyes peered into the blizzard, counting their men
in.
If Hearts fail to make any impact this season, at least the football
club's vice-chairman, Deans, whose law firm supports the athletics club,
will have some silverware to show.
But Aberdeen were the most significant winners, taking the overall
league title for the fifth time in eight seasons. As in football league
competition, individual wins in themselves are unimportant. Consistency
is the key.
The performances of all five age-group teams over each of the three
meetings are aggregated to determine the outright champions. George
Heriot's made history when they took the youth team shield. They are the
first school to win any league age-group outright, although in 1959 the
school shared the senior boys' title with Edinburgh Southern. Details:

IT was a disappointing week for tabloid headline writers and European
correspondents in the superior press.
The beastie boys from the tabs lost their favourite bogeyman when Mr
Jacques Delors walked off the European stage to applause and a chorus of
calls for federalism.
Bad taste landmarks like the Sun's ''Up Yours, Delors'' will not come
so easily from now on without the European Commission president and
Europhobes' pre-eminent demon.
I am told the Sun was so proud of that headline that it dispatched a
reporter to Heathrow on the morning of its publication, when Mr Delors
was visiting London.
Her job was to wave the front page in Mr Delors's face and ask him
triumphantly: ''So what do you think of this, then?'' Which she duly
did. Mr Delors looked puzzled and took her for a crank.
Funny, but Mr Delors always had a sneaking liking for the British
press. At least we paid attention.
The sketch writer's dream did not come true with the Kinnocks. Pencils
at the ready, they turned up in droves for the European Parliament's
grilling of prospective commissioners. The British, of course, were
desperate to hear Mr Neil Kinnock's response to an interrogation by
Euro-MPs including, they prayed, his own wife Glenys.
They were hoping for such armour-piercing questions from Glenys as:
''In your new capacity, commissioner-designate, at what time do you
think you'll be home for your tea?'' Of course, it never happened. Mrs
Kinnock wisely steered clear.
Now the commission gets down to work with 20 members in the new,
enlarged European Union, and the Euro-MP with the biggest diplomatic
problem arising from last week's events is Mr Ken Collins from
Strathclyde East. Mr Collins is chairman of the parliament's environment
committee and president of the committee of committee chairmen (which is
why he is known in these parts as the king of kings).
He abstained in the confirmation vote for Mr Jacques Santer's new team
because of the attitude of the incoming environment commissioner, Mrs
Ritt Bjerregaard, who is Danish. She is the commissioner who famously
described the European Parliament as ''not a real parliament''.
If there is one thing calculated to upset touchy Euro-MPs it is the
suggestion that they are second class politicians or (pace Mr Jeremy
Paxman) nonentities.
Mrs Bjerregaard went further and said she thought it was for Mr
Collins's committee to follow her lead and not the other way round. In
the new mood of assertiveness in Strasbourg, this is Apache talk.
Inevitably, she did the politician's usual thing and claimed she had
been misquoted, mistranslated into English, and taken out of context
(talk about belt and braces). She then compounded her difficulties by
issuing a formal note of clarification -- probably because she was
ordered to -- in which she failed explicitly to deny what she had
allegedly said. This made matters worse.
Mr Collins refused to vote for her investiture and abstained, but
parliament gave her and her colleagues its backing. Mr Collins and Mrs
Bjerregaard must now learn to work together. His first olive branch was
an invitation to her to join him for lunch. This potentially fractious
event will not, presumably, take place at the Paris Ritz.
Mrs Bjerregaard was famously sacked in public some years ago (at
Copenhagen airport, apparently) after running up an embarrassingly big
bill at the Ritz. Obviously she was a pioneer of gracious living long
before British Government Ministers discovered the knack, but she
suffered for her sins more than some.
It was her clumsy dealing with Euro-MPs which, more than anything, led
to some strange voting when the time came for the decision to endorse
the new commission. Mr Alex Smith (South of Scotland), the Labour Whip,
voted for the commission when most of his fellow Scots voted against or
abstained. Mr James Provan, the Tory Whip, voted No when most of his
party voted Yes, as they were supposed to. (This must be a British
variation on the idea of European political consensuality).
What the new batch of 59 Euro-MPs from Austria, Sweden, and Finland
thought of it all is anyone's guess.
Special electronic folding seats had to be installed in the Strasbourg
hemicycle to cope with the new arrivals. But because the new seats must
be used by different people at different times, this meant that some of
our Euro-MPs had to go through the indignity of fighting for somewhere
to sit, a novel concept for the poor souls. After all, the European
Parliament is not the Commons -- no lounging, no mace swinging, not much
standing about (you can't wander and receive simultaneous translation),
no mice, lots of women.
Some of our British Labour contingent thought they would demonstrate
their sophisticated sense of humour to the Germans. They turned up early
for debate and put towels on their chairs.
Finally, the disappointing week was capped by the Euro-MPs' decision
to play the Grand Old Duke of York, again. Having huffed and puffed
about their new powers under Maastricht and their determination to show
who's boss in their dealing with the unelected commission and council of
ministers in the changing Europe, they finally marched to the top of the
hill.
At that point they had to decide whether to vote down Mr Santer and
his team. The rules insist that to reject one commissioner -- and Mrs
Bjerregaard, the commissioner with attitude, was asking for it -- they
had to reject the lot. Predictably, they marched downhill.
The British Tories, or most of them, could not bring themselves to
give Sir Leon Brittan the elbow. Ditto most of the British Labour group
with Mr Kinnock.
National interests also overrode European solidarity with other
national groupings and the parliament duly endorsed Mr Santer's new
team, Mrs Bjerregaard and all, by a commanding majority. Reporters
sulked off, robbed again of ''Europe paralysed'' stories, as they were
when Mr Santer himself was similarly endorsed.
Mr Santer has never smiled so much in his life, and he is known as
Smiling Jacques. He is also known as Jacques Sancerre for his reported
fondness for fine wine, good company, and his habit of carousing with
journalists. Which is why the Celtic fringe of the press corps already
has him on the dinner invitation list.
Things can only get better.

SLEAZE is everywhere, what with the Nolan Committee starting its work,
the Prince of Wales's valet disclosing the secrets of the royal
household -- including the high cost of having a man to stay for the
weekend who opens windows by smashing the glass -- and the row generated
by the bowdlerisation of Edith Wharton's The Buccaneers.
We should not blame our legislators too much for failing to live up to
the high standards the Mother of Parliament aspires to -- they are only
men and women, no better than the rest of us, if slightly more
privileged, and how they behave is how we behave.
Prince Charles as an employer sounds like someone to avoid like the
plague -- let him put on his own pyjamas, pack his own bags and run his
own bathwater like the rest of us. Who does he think he is?
As for the row about The Buccaneers, it is surely one more sign of the
times. Mrs Wharton (1862-1937) was a very grand lady indeed who wrote a
series of splendid novels about the lives of the well-to-do east coast
Americans. John Collins Bossidy summed up the people she wrote about
memorably:
And this is good old Boston,
The home of the bean and the cod,
Where the Lowells talk to the Cabots,
And the Cabots talk only to God.
Several of her books have been filmed. The most recent being The Age
of Innocence, directed by Martin Scorsese. The screenplay by Scorsese
and Jay Cocks was remarkably faithful to the writer's creation, while
subtly moulding events into dramatic form.
There is sex in The Age of Innocence, but it is all off the page, and
the most erotic moment on screen was the hero taking off a woman's
glove, a moment faithful to Wharton. Maggie Wadey, the screen writer
responsible for the television version of The Buccaneers, which is being
serialised by the BBC, has apparently inserted a marital rape scene and
outed one of the characters as homosexual.
She justifies the changes by saying these things were present in ''the
currents of the book itself'', the ''impulses that were already there''
and in the notes left by Mrs Wharton.
But novelists know what they are doing, and the notes they leave are
not necessarily evidence of intention, but of ideas discarded. Had Mrs
Wharton, a very sophisticated woman, wished to spell things out, she
would have done so.
The book is about four American girls trying to make their way in
English society of the 1870s, a time when Yankee heiresses were the
saviour of many a mouldering ducal pile, one of whom, Nan, raped by her
cold husband, later finds him in bed with a man -- or so Ms Wadey would
have us believe. Mrs Wharton did not write these incidents, and if they
are not in the book, there is no reason for them being on screen.
The actress playing Nan, Carla Gugino, said that they had to play up
the implied homosexuality and rape to make the book ''relevant'', the
age-old excuse given by an actress for taking all her clothes off. Just
why pubic hair makes something relevant is anybody's guess, but
actresses like to have reasons for doing what they do. Saying it is to
pay the rent is too like the prostitute's reason for her trade for
comfort.
Carla Gugino also added: ''Edith Wharton would not have needed to
spell out what she meant, but you do today. We are living in different
times.'' We certainly live in different times, but the need to spell
things out is, if anything, less than it was when Mrs Wharton was
writing her novels.
There is more literary vandalism in prospect. In the new TV version of
Pride and Prejudice, we are promised a full frontal of Mr Darcy stepping
out of the bath and, horror of horrors, kissing scenes. Jane Austen
would never have written either.
The reason for such inventions is simple. Ratings are what count, and
if the viewer's attention can be secured by on-screen bonking, by an
artifically created shock horror scandal, then have the former and
create the latter. The fiddling with Dickens's Martin Chuzzlewit was
also open to question since the adaptation omitted the American scenes
-- bad for transatlantic sales --and amended the ending.
Gugino said that audiences nowadays saw much more graphic images and
their senses were jaded. Maybe so, but I have just seen Luis Bunuel's
Viridiana, made in 1961, which is being re-released as part of the
Bunuel Collection.
Bitingly vicious, surreal and sacriligious, it is about a novice nun
who, before taking her vows, is invited by her rich uncle to stay at his
house. He dies, leaving her and his bastard son his money and his
mansion. The son runs the family estate; the girl, Viridiana, embarks on
good works, filling the outhouses with beggars she is intent on rescuing
from poverty for God.
The beggars, knowing a good thing when they see one, take their
benefactress for all she is worth. When Viridiana and her cousin, a male
predator if ever there was, go off for the day, the beggars invade the
house and throw a drunken party. At the climax, one of them announces
she is going to take a photograph with her ''little camera''.
We soon find out what she means. The others gather round the table,
the camera looks at her and she lifts her skirts. Bunuel makes clear she
is wearing no knickers, but her ''little camera'' remains unseen -- his
camera stays firmly above the waist. Not today it wouldn't.
Then we are shown what she is photographing -- the beggars have
grouped themselves into an imitation of Da Vinci's The Last Supper.
Viridiana and her cousin return, and most of the beggars flee. Two of
them remain, attack the man, tie him up, and one, a lecherous leper,
watches while the other rapes Viridiana. Again Bunuel achieves his
shocks by his reticence.
The watching beggar salivates and says that maybe when the other man
is finished, he will let him have a turn. The cousin bribes him to kill
the rapist, which he does with a fire shovel. One does not see the rape,
nor the rapist's head being smashed in. There is no blood, no nudity.
But there is horror. The scene registers every bit as powerfully as it
did 34 years ago.
This is not an appeal for hypocrisy or evasion of the truth about
violence. Bunuel was a film maker who challenged all sorts of accepted
truths -- Viridiana is about the corruption of innocence and the
hypocrisy of a church which created that innocence. He went as far, not
as he could go, but as far as he needed to go, which is the whole point.
Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers is a moral enough tale about the
way media hype turns people into killers high on the publicity they are
given, but whether one needs to see all that he shows of what they do is
quite another matter.
Making a work of art relevant is a laudable enough object, although it
does question what the artist was up to in the first place, since all
art should be relevant to its own and future generations. That can pose
problems when social attitudes have changed radically. Shylock is not
acceptable today. But there are ways of dealing with the problem.
One can play down elements in a character as written, stress other
parts of the play, cut scenes which no longer work, speed the action up
or slow it down. But bowdlerising to achieve whatever is considered
relevant is another matter, and when it involves altering the original
so that it becomes something other than the creator intended, things
have gone too far.

ELLIOT Bunney, Scotland's Olympic, European, and Commonwealth sprint
medallist may have retired, but his spikes have not. His fiancee, Mel
Neef, borrowed them yesterday, and found the magic lingers on, for they
powered her to six Scottish records at the Scottish Athletic Federation
national indoor championships.
The ink on the Scottish marks set a week earlier by Neef and Aileen
McGillivray was barely dry when the catalogue was rewritten.
In one of the most remarkable days of sprinting seen in Glasgow's
Kelvin Hall, Neef captured the 60 metres and 200m titles, improving the
national and native records in each, and establishing one of six new
championship best performances.
Since she already owns the national and native indoor marks at 400m,
set last year, the City of Glasgow woman now has a monopoly on the
national and native all-time performances from 60m to 400m.
But the spikes which she wore to do it have travelled faster. Checking
her gear the night before, Neef found the screw-in needle spikes were
worn, and the only source of new ones were those no longer needed by her
fiance, the former European junior 100m champion who has turned to
rugby.
''So I transfered them to my shoes,'' said Mel. They helped her take
the short sprint with a time of 7.35sec, turning the tables on
McGillivray who had beaten her a week earlier, and wiping out her
records.
Then she took the 200m in 23.73, again setting Scottish national and
native bests. But because of a ludicrous piece of seeding, Neef had
already been forced to lower the national and native marks in the 200m
qualifying rounds, where she clocked 24.04.
Neef was drawn in the opening round of the 200m against Sinead
Dudgeon, second fastest in the field. They were the only runners in
their heat, despite another heat going with just three on the five-lane
track.
''With three heats, and only the winners and a fastest loser to
qualify, we were forced to race down to the wire,'' explained Neef. ''If
I'd eased off, Sinead would have beaten me, so it had to be fast to
ensure we both made it.''
Dudgeon ran a personal best of 24.39, ensuring the fastest loser's
berth, but with the final brought forward to semi-final time, the women
had just 35 minutes to recover. ''Otherwise, there is every chance we'd
have gone even quicker in the final,'' said Neef. ''I've been seeded in
the same race as Sinead six times in a fortnight. It's crazy.''
Neef's 200m time lowered her own record (24.16), claimed from Linsey
Macdonald the previous weekend in the East district championships. She
also broke Kathleen Merry's championship record yesterday, carrying her
to fifth on the British indoor all-time list.
It is worth recording the four women ahead of her: Merry, Joan
Baptiste, Kathy Cook, and Jenny Stoute. All of them were concentrating
on the 200m, whereas Neef is a 400m runner simply trying to develop pace
for the longer distance.
McGillivray, who clocked a national and native best for 60m a week
earlier at 7.39, was not as sharp out of the blocks this time, yet
clocked 7.37 as Neef missed Merry's championship best by a mere .01.
Four times out of six jumps, Fiona Watt improved on her own triple
jump native best, set last weekend at 11.52m. She had a remarkable
series: 11.96m, 11.96, 11.73, 12.03, 12.14, and 12.15.
There were encouraging wins from Tom McKean (800m), Brian Whittle
(400m), a championship best by Commonwealth shot putter Alison Grey, and
an exceptional hurdles run by 17-year-old Ross Baillie. For the second
time in three races, and in only his second attempt at 3ft 6ins
barriers, Baillie lowered the Scottish under-20 best to 8.04, then took
third in the final behind men who have run in the Olympic and
Commonwealth Games.

TOM BRADY, who has just taken over as chief executive at the Ingliston
headquarters of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, is resigned to
the fact that he will never please everyone. He sees criticism as
something that comes with the job -- and while he takes it seriously, he
doesn't let it worry him unduly. ''If you are a fragile petal in the
NFU, you won't last very long,'' he says.
Such flak as comes his way, he takes as part of the rough and tumble
of life in what he insists is a very open and democratic organisation.
It is some 12 years since he arrived at the NFUS as an assistant
secretary -- fresh from Heriot Watt University where, as a mature
student, he had gained a degree in economics. To this day, he remains
the union's in-house economist.
Tom, 47, had a more itinerant existence than most as a boy. His father
was involved in the construction industry, with a career which took him
from Kirkcaldy to what was then Southern Rhodesia, Canada, and South
Africa. Young Tom tagged along too, sometimes living with his parents,
sometimes with cousins, but always enjoying himself.
On his return to this country as a young man, he went into industry,
and latterly was involved in production control in a factory
manufacturing TV tubes.
''That was boring, and I decided I had to be better educated,'' he
recalls. So it was off to night school to get the requisite number of
highers, and then on to Heriot Watt University to study economics.
It sounds easy on paper, but must have been a daunting prospect at the
time. The ideal preparation, perhaps, for the rigours that lay ahead at
the NFU. Tom has arrived in the chief executive's chair just in time to
be passed the hot potato of putting the farmers' side in the
controversey surrounding live animal exports, and the Continental veal
trade in particular.
Some of his members have been expressing the view that the farmers'
case has not been especially well presented. One letter which arrived on
our desk this week described the NFUS position as ''head stuck in the
sand, hoping that the problem will go away somehow.''
Not so, says Tom. ''It is an enormously difficult problem when you see
an issue like this developing, as it has, in front of your eyes. There
are these pictures of protestors on television, and no matter how many
TV appearances you make to explain the farmers' point of view, you are
lucky if you get two or three seconds.''
Unfortunately, the union was left looking as if it had been
wrong-footed at the end of last year, when it declined to attend a press
conference organised by Prestwick Airport -- because the NFU did not
want to be seen sharing a platform with people whose tactics had been
described by the Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave as akin to
terrorism.
Maybe it did seem then, in those pre-Shoreham days, that the problem
would go away if it was ignored.
Today, Tom concedes that there is a major PR job to be done, but the
battleground, he says, should be in Brussels, not south coast seaports
in England. ''It is difficult to see how some of the more extreme
welfarists could ever be satisfied,'' he sighs. ''Living in the real
world, as we do, the best that can be hoped for is improvements to the
transport laws -- on a European basis -- and urgent re-consideration of
the veal production system.
''People may accuse us of not going far enough, but what they have
never done is gone over to the Continent and met the looks of utter
bewilderment on some faces when you even start to talk about animal
welfare.''
People should not underestimate the part the union played in getting
the welfare issue on the agenda for today's meeting of European Farm
Ministers, he argues. ''It was not easily achieved.''
In the longer term, he says, Scottish farmers would like to see more
meat processed in Scotland, and the NFUS has played a major part in the
launch of quality assurance and marketing schemes based on achieving
added value by processing meat here.
While the animal welfare issue hits the headlines, there are others
which still claim an important place on the union's agenda. Their own
structures and organisation have been under review, and a new business
plan is about to be produced. From views that have already been
expressed, Tom is sure that there is no massive demand for radical
change -- but is cautious enough to issue a warning that there is a
danger of ''talking ourselves into thinking our organisation is in
crisis.''
By the same token, he suggests that the UK is likely to make the
prospect of CAP reform a bigger bogeyman than it really is. While he
foresees a gradual lowering of intervention prices towards world levels,
he detects no need to attack the basic principles of the CAP. The
implementation of the GATT agreement will pose problems, he admits. They
may be serious, but not terminal.
We point out that his pragmatic view is close to the line adopted by
William Waldegrave in his address to the Oxford Farming Conference. ''In
that case, he is coming round to our point of view,'' Tom suggests
modestly. ''He wasn't saying that before.''

GOLF has such a devious way of teasing its adherents, alternately
flaunting its charms on even the most gauche of its suitors and
withdrawing its favours from its most skilled pursuers. Bewitched,
bothered and bewildered, neither knows which way to turn, or to whom,
for consolation.
After a bad day on the course an old Walker Cup player used to sigh
and console himself: ''Ah well, there's aye the drink.'' The healthier
approach is to the club professional or the full-time coach, depending
on the level of the victim and the urgency of his (or her) need for the
healing hand of the swing doctor.
Detecting the faults and prescribing the cure may not be every
person's idea of living life in the fast lane, any more than the
day-to-day activity of a family doctor. But where would the golfer be
without the curiosity and experience of someone like John Jacobs.
In his 70s now, Jacobs has been a successful tournament professional,
a Ryder Cup player, course designer, and the establishing figure of the
PGA European Tour -- and yet he still coaches with enthusiasm. He has
now further diversified his talents by collaborating with the golf
writer, Peter Dobereiner, on an instructional book.
Entitled Golf In A Nutshell and to be published later this year, it
will, in Jacobs' own words, be ''anecdotal rather than technical.'' That
suggests it will be on the lines adopted so successfully by the
American, Harvey Penick, in his Little Red and Little Green Books.
The young Nick Faldo would certainly have been the wiser had he read
such works before he turned up at the Welwyn Garden City club, a
14-year-old enthusiastic to learn an unknown game which only attracted
him when he saw Jack Nicklaus playing it on television. He could hardly
have become better, it is true.
That introduction is a well documented fact of Faldo's career. Less
well known is the identity of the assistant who gave him his first
lessons -- a course of six at 10 shillings each. He is Chris Arnold, no
longer a professional but a sales executive with Apollo, the club shaft
manufacturer.
Afterwards Ian Connelly, the Scots-born head professional, took Faldo
under his wing, but Arnold still recalls his first encounter with Faldo.
He says: ''He was always keen to understand the swing and for the first
two lessons I didn't let him try a shot, so that he learned to hit
through the ball, not at it.''
From there Faldo famously redesigned his swing in mid-career, and his
obsession with ''tweaking and fine-tuning'' the mechanics with his
coach, David Leadbetter, has been held to account for the drought his
recent fortunes have suffered, at least when it comes to winning more of
the major championships.
Such an intense preoccupation is not to the taste of the world's
first-ranked player, Nick Price, also a disciple of Leadbetter. ''I'll
work with him for two or three hours,'' Price said recently, ''but after
that I don't want to see him for six weeks -- otherwise I'd probably
wrap a club round his neck.''
Such consolations as fate allows the average golfer -- say, to make
par at the hole rated the most difficult on the course or to do the same
at a pair of awkward short holes or, most exhilarating of all, to chip
in from long range for a birdie 3 -- are matter of fact achievements to
the professionals.
Their satisfactions are aimed at far higher levels of achievement --
and there must be as many of them in the experience of the game's
teachers, as they see one of their charges develop a successful career,
paid or not, as in that of the tournament professional who exalts in his
victories and calculates their rewards.

FRED Couples, considerably embarrassed last year when he missed the
36-hole cut by two strokes, comprehensively restored his pride yesterday
when he won the Dubai Desert Classic and the #75,000 first prize by an
emphatic three strokes -- the engaging 35-year-old American's first
victory in a PGA European Tour event.
The 1992 US Masters champion, who shared the lead after the third
round with Colin Montgomerie, outscored the Scot, his partner on all
four days, by three strokes with a concluding round of 66 for a total of
268, 20 under par and equal to the record set 12 months ago at the
Emirates Club by Ernie Els.
Montgomerie, again burdened with sole responsibility for offering
sustained European resistance to the invading hordes, holed a 12-foot
birdie putt at the last to be runner-up on his own. That stroke earned
him #50,000, some #20,000 more than if he had shared second place with
Michael Campbell and Wayne Riley.
Nick Price and Greg Norman, rated No.1 and No.2 in the world
respectively, were joint fifth on 273, a stroke ahead of Els, and so
only Bernhard Langer of the six players in the field who are among the
leading eight in the global rankings was not involved in the climax.
It gradually became clear on an afternoon of hot sunshine ruffled by a
light breeze that the other big guns would remain comparatively silent.
Price, Norman and Els among them made 12 birdies, but they also had
seven bogeys and, therefore, any sort of prolonged challenge could not
emerge.
Montgomerie, who led by three strokes after two rounds and began the
third round with three successive birdies, found the supply gradually
drying up. In the remaining 33 holes of the tournament he could make
only five more gains, and although the Scot dropped only one stroke in
the final round, Couples lost none and had six birdies.
Couples, readily identifiable by his casual gait, his gloveless left
hand, and his reverse grip on the putter, struck three key shots. At the
first, he chipped to 10 feet and saved par; he birdied the ninth,
striking a No.6-iron shot 160 yards into the wind over water to five
feet; and he conquered the equally exacting uphill twelfth with a No.3
iron from 193 yards to four feet.
These were class shots from a player in control of the slow rhythm of
his swing. In contrast, approaching the turn, Montgomerie's iron play
faltered in the fresh, left-hand wind, which exaggerated the cut on his
shots to the seventh, eighth, and ninth greens. The first two mistakes
were saved by 15-foot putts, but not the third.
''The ninth, where I had my only bogey, and the twelfth (where his
chip dead again saved par) made the final difference of the three shots
between us,'' Montgomerie later reflected. ''But I knew I had to hole
that last putt for sole second place, and this start will stand me in
good stead for the rest of the season.''
Indeed, Montgomerie's finish achieved two other benefits -- he at once
went to the top of the order of merit table in his attempt to become
only the third player to win it three years in succession, and he moved
from sixth to third place on the Ryder Cup points table.
The Antipodean threat developed through Riley's five birdies in six
holes from the turn, and the Australian's inward half of 32 and score of
67 was matched when Campbell, his partner and a hugely talented New
Zealander of Maori extraction, made the only eagle 3 of the day at the
long eighteenth. Of the first 10, incidentally, only Montgomerie and
Northern Ireland's Raymond Burns were Europeans.
Elsewhere, Wayne Westner the 1993 winner who began the tournament by
taking almost #20,000 for a hole-in-one, finished it with a 64, the
day's lowest score. The other surviving Scot, Stephen McAllister,
rescued a moderate score and raised morale with four birdies in the last
six holes for a 70, one of 39 scores under par by the 69 qualifiers.

WHAT a huge country Scotland is. Little Ardo is 230 miles from the
north coast. And yet, after driving 285 miles south, I was still 240
miles from the Border.
That was last week, when I went down to Campbeltown to address the
annual meeting of the Kintyre branch of the National Farmers' Union of
Scotland.
I had been there before, though on much sadder business.
It was about 1975 that I sold a fine looking Simmental bull to Mr
William McKerral of the Bleachfields at Campbeltown. He made about
1900gns, which was no mean trade at that time. And he was looking well.
One of those light coloured Simmentals who stood tall, was well fleshed,
and big boned. Had he not been a little bit straight of his back legs, I
would have fancied that bull for a champion, and so would Mr McKerral.
But it was not only his back legs that were less than perfect. After
three weeks, the cows he'd seen to, all came back. Another three weeks,
and he might have settled one. Tests were done. They showed that our
fine looking bull was firing not fewer than 93 blanks out of 100.
That was bad for me. I was setting myself up as a breeder of fine
bulls, and here they were -- all show and no go.
But if it was bad for me, it was a potential disaster for my client.
His calves were already late, and getting later by the day. I had two
young bulls and an old float, so the answer was obvious.
I loaded them up. I would start early, arrive at dinner-time, and then
drive back in the afternoon.
That was a fine plan, except that by closing time that night I had
only got as far as Inveraray.
In the old Albion float, it was a two-day journey to Campbeltown,
never mind back.
What a contrast last week. In the Jaggie it took five hours.
I must say, they've got their union well organised. The annual meeting
was held in a suite of two rooms -- a very small meeting room, and a
very large bar. Those proportions were ideal for those members who found
they had to remain in the bar until the formal business was over, and
the real business could begin.
And the real business was enhanced by the announcement from the chair
that it was, in fact, the old Hogmanay. It is some years since I enjoyed
that excuse for another seasonal refreshment, but we all stuck in with a
will.
It was a very jolly occasion, which emphasised to me once again that
farming folk are much the same wherever you meet them. There were many
fine stories of farming life on Kintyre but unfortunately, as usual, I
have forgotten them.
Bar one, and I can't remember who told me, so I can't embarrass him.
I was reminded of the time that the Red Rooster was shot at a shoot in
Aberdeenshire. At the end, when the game was laid out for the count, the
Rooster lay down between the pheasants and the hares, a little trickle
of blood running from a pellet wound below his eye.
My friend from Kintyre would cap that, with the story of the famous
shoot for which 400 pheasants had been put down. The bag had been
disappointing though, amounting to only 23 pheasants, seven rabbits, and
a greenhouse.
I have had many's the happy moment, thinking about what they could
have said to the greenhouse owner. I once kicked a football through the
side of one, and that was bad enough, but shooting a greenhouse is, as
they will say nowadays, something else.
I liked Kintyre. It reminded me of when I was a boy, and Aberdeenshire
was an agricultural community. Now the land here is for living in,
rather than working on. But driving around on Old New Year's Day, with
the local president Donald Taylor, was like the old days driving round
with my father. He would know nine-tenths of the people he met, whereas
I will be lucky if I know one in 10.
The dog population is changing though.
I used to think I was very clever to think of using Honda, my
four-wheeled dog, for herding cattle, but I find everyone in this stock
and dairy country has one. Typically, a farmer who once had three dogs
will now have two -- and a motor bike.
One dog on the front, one on the back, and a driver, make the perfect
modern team for herding. It is a breakthrough, though it can be
dangerous. I was told of one tragedy, where an eager collie jumped off
and was killed by a passing car. The farmer braked, sending the other
flying off, whereupon he ran it over himself.
And the four-wheelers can be dangerous for the men as well. The
trouble is that you get excited when the chase is on, and you forget
that all this speed is coming from a machine, and that there are limits
to the stability of a machine. I heard horrendous tales of shepherds
chasing along, trying to turn after a rogue on a steep slope, and the
bike going somersaulting down the hill.
Thank goodness I didn't get Honda when I was young. With the timidity
of age, I am in no danger.
And how good Honda is. My cattle know they cannot win. As often as
they break for the bottom of the field, so will I be there waiting for
them -- and not even out of breath. They know that now. They hate Honda
so much for it that, as soon as we start to circle them, they bolt for
the gate.

APPALLING weather which swept the highlands at the weekend and
Lochaber's win at Lovat boosted Newtonmores chances of qualifying from
north division one for next season's national shinty league.
Newtonmore's game with Fort William was postponed and Lovat slipped up
against the struggling Spean Bridge side in a five-goal thriller.
Lochaber took a 2-0 lead through an Angus Morrison double. Lovat
responded in the second half with the Reid brothers, Steven and Craig,
pulling them level, but Ricky Fraser had the final say.
In the south, Glasgow Mid Argyll beat Glenorchy to reach the
semi-finals of the Celtic Cup. They meet holders Oban Camanachd. Magnus
MacFarlane-Barrow put Glenorchy ahead, but Mid Argyll replied with an
Ernie Crawford double. Kevin Thain made it three. Scores:
North. Marine Harvest League. Division 1 -- Glenurquhart 5, Beauly 3;
Lovat 2, Lochaber 3. Division 2 -- Inverness 1, Kilmallie 2; Caberfeidh

HISTORICAL lessons can be sorely learnt. The intensification of
agriculture following World War 11 led to applauded increases in crop
and animal production. Only latterly have these achievements been
questioned, and the environmental cost assessed.
The spectre of European over-production during the 1980's forced
policy makers to re-assess agricultural objectives, and led to the
advent of the first schemes to encourage farmers to adopt more
environmentally sensitive practices.
This trend has continued, with the introduction most recently of the
Habitats Scheme (Council Regulation (EEC) 2078/92) and the Habitats
(Scotland) Regulations 1994.
The aim of the new scheme is to provide financial assistance to
encourage farmers and crofters to ''establish or improve certain types
of habitat which are considered to be of significant conservation
value,'' many of which have largely disappeared from the agricultural
landscape with increasing intensification of farming.
Five different grassland, upland, coastal, and waterside habitats are
identified and, depending on habitat, the scheme requires that the land
is either taken out of agricultural production completely for a period
of 20 years, or that agricultural use is restricted to ''limited
grazing, managed in the interests of conservation, for a period of 10
years.''
Payments vary according to habitat type, and management options. Full
details can be found in the Scottish Office Agriculture and Food
Department explanatory leaflet (HS-1994).
SAC and farmers alike have viewed this reversal in policy with
interest. Accepting that retreat from intensive agricultural production
is prudent, important questions arise. Namely, can these lost habitats
of conservation value be re-created, how can they be re-created, and how
should they be managed.?
The experience of set-aside has shown that for the majority of arable
fields, leaving the land to regenerate naturally will not result in
vegetation of conservation value within a reasonable time-scale.
Set-aside fields follow a characteristic succession from annual arable
weeds, through thistles and docks, to perennial grasses which perpetuate
under the prescribed annual cutting management. Only in areas with
remnants of semi-natural vegetation is this pattern significantly
different.
For the majority of fields, the seeds of those plants characteristic
of habitats of conservation value are simply not present, either in the
soil, or within the nearby locality. For these fields, habitat creation
will require intervention, either by introducing seeds, or established
plants typical of the appropriate habitat.
SAC has been studying this interventionist option, identifying
appropriate habitats for given localities, determining appropriate
species for given habitats, and experimenting with different methods of
vegetation establishment and long-term management.
This has involved studying historical farming practices, and examining
areas of vegetation untouched by modern farming methods.
However, the legacy of intensive farming, namely high soil fertility
and a soil dominated by aggressive annual weed seeds, has created a very
different situation to that in which those methods and vegetation types
evolved. The extent to which this may cause problems for farmers
embarking on the new scheme is currently largely unknown, although
stringent weed control pre-planting-sowing is known to be an important
factor.
Clearly, while it is important to learn from farming traditions, it is
not enough simply to assume that those methods are appropriate for the
establishment and management of newly-created habitats.
These will never equate to the original, but our research hope is to
reproduce these habitats of conservation value, and to help farmers
resurrect our natural history.
The author of this article is Anna Christal, of the Crop Systems
Department, SAC, Edinburgh.

PHIL Mickelson, who as an amateur startled the golfing world by
winning the 1991 Northern Telecom Open, yesterday recovered from an
inconsistent front nine to land this year's event in Arizona when he
beat Ryder Cup player Jim Gallagher and former US Open champion Scott
Simpson by one stroke to claim the $225,000 first prize.
The tournament looked sure to go into a play-off with Mickelson and
Gallagher level on the last tee. But Mickelson's par was enough for
victory.
Nick Faldo returned a 68. He struck the ball with authority and putted
well and should go to the Phoenix Open, which starts in Scottsdale on
Thursday, in an optimistic mood, while Brett Ogle was the first
non-American, the Australian finishing fourth on 271. Leading scores:
269 -- P Mickelson 65, 66, 70, 68.

INADEQUATE financial incentives, and the absence of tax relief, are
the greatest barriers to further woodland plantings in the United
Kingdom, a survey by the Royal Agricultural Society of England has
revealed.
The latest opinion poll of members, designed to assess confidence and
attitudes, suggests that there is a high level of interest among farmers
towards woodland planting and management, but financial incentives are
currently insufficient to encourage further expansion in the on-farm
forestry sector.
More than half the members surveyed had some forestry and woodland on
their farms, 75% of it consisting of hardwood plantations.
Conservation was cited as the major use of woodland, indicating that
leisure, including public access and nature trails, was becoming more
important.
Eleven per cent of woodland planted before 1980, and 14% planted after
that date, was used primarily for leisure.

Bruce Sandison visits the
smallest of the Ionian Islands
PAXOS is an island for lovers. A dream-like, sweet-scented Ionian isle
where you may wander day-long, hand-in-hand, without meeting another
soul; an island of secluded, secret, azure bays, shaded by ancient olive
groves; of white scarred cliffs pinnacled by tall green pines, indented
with deep, dark blue sea-caves. Peace ''comes dropping slow'' on Paxos
and is a tangible, living thing, an all-pervading presence.
Our villa perched on a maquis-covered headland looking east across the
Ionian Sea to the old town of Parga on mainland Greece; where the
descendants of Charon still row visitors up the River Styx, one of the
five rivers of Hades, in search of the three-headed dog, Cerberus. At
night, Parga's lights sparkled in the distance, a remembrance of Greek
mythology and times past.
Paxos is the smallest of the Ionian Islands, reached after a
three-hour ferry trip south from Corfu, or from Parga in one hour. The
island has a resident population of approximately 2600, no airport, few
hotels, rutted roads, five taxis, and very little in the way of
''tourist facilities'' in the accepted, modern sense of that
much-maligned phrase.
Those who choose Paxos as a holiday destination tend to have interests
which do not include night-long, ghetto-blasting beachside rave-ups or
high-society, fashion conscious cafe-creeping. Find that in Corfu. Go to
Paxos for absolute contentment, solitude and silence amid friendly,
courteous people who have retained much of their traditional way of
life.
Paxos has been variously ruled; by Rome, Byzantium, Venice, France,
Russia, Britain, and, finally, Greece. William Gladstone, British Lord
High Commissioner, went to Gaios, the capital of Paxos, in 1858 to
discuss union with Greece and with the Bishop of Paxos. Both men,
tall-hatted, bowed to each other at the same time; causing an immediate,
although somewhat embarrassing meeting of minds. Paxos became part of
Greece.
The legacy of British rule lingers, epitomised by the imposing bulk of
the former British Resident's house overlooking Gaios Harbour and the
many waterworks built by the British during the Georgian period. Gaios
is an ideal centre for exploring the island, and for boat-jumping
round-the-island expeditions and visiting Antipaxos to the south.
If Paxos ever gets ''busy'', then the centre of activity is midsummer
in Gaios Square. There are excellent little tavernas and the harbour
hosts visiting yachts, the crews of which descend upon the village with
great gusto. Hardly vibrant night-life, but splendid fun to sit sipping
an ouzo under the oleanders watching the world go by.
Gaios is the centre for the most important Paxos religious festival
which takes place on August 15, the Festival of the Madonna; when local
people visit the nunnery on the small island of Panagia in Gaios Bay to
offer their respect to a sacred icon. The sea between Gaios and the
island is spread with flowers and the celebrations do not end promptly.
Gaios Bay also contains St Nicholas Isle. This is private but
permission to land can be obtained. There is a wonderful walk up to the
high point (184ft) which gives marvellous, panoramic views. The ruins of
a fifteenth century fortress dominate the hill and the island is rich in
flora and fauna, including wild turkeys, white rabbits, native Aleppo
pine and huge century plants.
The best way to explore Paxos is on foot. The island is only seven
miles north/south by up to three miles wide and there are many tracks
and paths through the olive groves. Growing olives is the principal
island industry and there are more than 300,000 olive trees throughout
Paxos.
But for me, the real joy of Paxos is less energetic; exploring tiny
villages, Ipapanti, Vasilatika, St Apostoli; trekking back to the villa
after returning our boat to Loggos harbour; the full-moon night, with
sea phosphorescence silver against blue and the scent of olive groves
hanging in still air; unbearably lovely -- far too wonderful for mere
mortals to comprehend.
The ''market leader'' in providing villa and apartment holidays to
Paxos is The Greek Island Club, 66 High Street, Walton-on-Thames,
Surrey, KT12 1BU. Tel 0932 220477, fax 0932 229346.

THE first time I met HM The Queen, back in the seventies, she came to
open a new museum in the Royal Mile. Quite charming she was too. When
her car drew up, this very brisk and commanding figure, clad in a black
coat and striped trousers, leapt from the interior almost before the
vehicle had come to a halt, holding open the door in ramrod fashion.
A few years later, he resigned in disgrace, having been discovered
lingering rather too long in public lavatories. Even in these days, it
was damn difficult to get decent servants and the problem seems to have
become worse.
I mean, what is one to make of Mr Ken Stronach, under-a-cloud valet to
the heir to the throne. After years of outstanding service -- ''God he
was so loyal,'' his ex-wife informs us -- he suddenly spews all to the
news of the screws, including some incredible tales involving
grass-stained pyjamas.
Whatever your view of the monarchy, or indeed of the Prince of Wales
himself, this surely cannot be taken to be acceptable behaviour in a
civilised society. Yet I suspect, like many clever clipe before him, Mr
Stronach will eventually be perfectly free to spend his ill-gotten
gains.
The whole concept of service, of people living-in who do-for-others,
is a dim memory for my generation, and will probably have to be
explained to the next. ''What was a butler, Grandad,'' I shall
anticipate being asked. Hard to believe then that, between the wars,
''in service'' was what the largest working section of British women
would have filled in as their occupation.
I encountered the genre a couple of times. In my early days canvassing
in the Pentlands constituency, a grande dame came to the door to inform
me: ''We vote in Sussex, where we have our family home. Mary, however,
will be voting Conservative and can be collected and taken to the
polling booth during her lunch break.'' Mary, an elderly soul in a black
pinny, appeared, grinned maliciously and gave a kind of bob. That maid,
I insisted to the Old Doc, has been putting her cross at anything other
than a Tory name for years, and who can blame her?
Some time later, in an Edinburgh hospital, my bed was placed next to
that of an old chap with a clipped moustache. ''Can't get about, sir?''
he declared, having spotted my leg in a stookey. ''No problem there.''
In a flash, all my possessions were neatly stashed in the locker, a cup
of tea was procured, and he was off organising how I would manage to
shave without ever emerging from the covers.
''Valet to Colonel Robinson of the Welsh Guards during the
hostilities, sir. We'll see you through this little bother.''
I don't think my old chap (God rest his soul, for he died as neatly as
he lived) nor the old maid would have revealed one's secrets to the
world, but times have changed.
Okay, we can all snigger and insist the rich get everything they
deserve, but I believe everyone is entitled to a little privacy, even if
they have a bob or two. Here's something which puzzles me -- why does
no-one get prosecuted for receiving stolen goods anymore?
Unless there is a satisfactory explanation of how these photographs
came to be in the hands of one newspaper or another, then why should the
receivers be permitted to make money from them? In the public interest?
Don't make me laugh.
The public interest argument is a cart blanche for snakes and
scoundrels. It is used by civil servants who slipped secret documents to
Opposition MPs while pretending all the while to serve loyally their
elected political masters.

YOU hear it from policemen when they wish to justify a tip-off that
they're about to launch a dawn raid on the house of some famous
ne'er-do-well. No point in doing good work by stealth, guv. Is that
angle of me putting my boot through the door all right for the cameras?
And of course, we hear it from certain newspaper editors. We just had
to know the name of the man who won the lottery jackpot . . . for his
own good, naturally. Everybody in his home town knew who he was -- let's
tell the world, and to hell with the consequences on his life. It was
his own fault for buying a ticket in the first place. In truth, we are
becoming an ever more prurient society, needing to know every intimate
detail of other people's business. Think of it -- who requires to be
informed, outside the taxman and the beneficiaries, of how much anyone
has left in their will?
Is the final sting that you're open to criticism of what you did with
your money even beyond the grave? You bet it is. And you can have
another wager; if you happen to have been any kind of public figure, a
book will come out not long after the funeral detailing all your little
dalliances and deviations. For dead men can't sue.
I mourn not the demise of the days of the head cook and bottle washer,
only the era when trust was not a commodity to be purchased like a can
of beans.

<HEADLINE>City expects Glaxoto bid for Wellcome</HEADLINE>

THE City is expecting Glaxo to make an approach in the near future to
Wellcome which could result in the formation of the world's third
largest largest drugs and pharmaceuticals company with a market worth of
#26.2bn.
That combination would trail Merck of the US at #45bn and the #32bn of
Roche of Switzerland, whose generally traded shares are standing at
#3200 each.
However, the bid has to be agreed as the charitable Wellcome
Foundation, which has a 40% holding in the company, is opposed to a
hostile bid for the Zovirax herpes and the Retrovir Aids drugs
manufacturer.
There was a heavy 5.2 million share turnover on Friday although that
was largely due to moves made by the US securities house Goldman Sachs.
The shares closed 4p firmer at 688p.
It is believed that Zeneca, the former pharmaceuticals division of
ICI, had talks with Wellcome chairman and chief executive John Robb some
months ago although these apparently got nowhere.
Wellcome has had one or two recent reverses such as the US Food and
Drug Adminstration reluctant to approve the over-the-counter sales of
Zovirax -- there is, apparently, an astonishing figure that more than
20% of American men have genital herpes.
In September, it abandoned further work on the Campath 1-H cancer drug
as offering no significant benefit.
However, Mr Robb has said that he is keen to use at least some of the
#800m cash honey-pot to make aquisitions in his own right. Wellcome is
currently No.20 in the global league of pharmaceutical companies.
Glaxo, whose chief executive is Sir Richard Sykes, has around #2400m
cash, and in contrast to Wellcome's fortunes, has recently had its core
money spinning Zantac anti-ulcer drug approved for the US
over-the-counter market.
A merger would bring several benefits. They include a huge saving on
research and development facilities in both Britain and the US, as well
as widening the portfolio with Wellcome's acknowleged global lead in
anti-virals complementing the anti-ulcerants and asthma portfolio at
Glaxo.

THERE are some places you feel you know before you're ever anywhere
near them. And Bakewell, in the Derbyshire Dales, is for me, one such.
But it wasn't a question of deja vu: I suspect it was all down to
puddings. Bakewell pudding, to be more precise, an egg custard, sweet
affair which, when served in the Original Bakewell Pudding Shop, comes
either coated in yet more custard or cream.
The Bakewell Pudding was something of a happy accident by all
accounts. Mrs Greaves, the story goes, who was mistress of the Rutland
Arms, was visited by noblemen one night. They demanded strawberry tarts.
But her cook got confused amd poured the egg custard on top of the
pastry rather than mixing it in. And so the famous pudding was born. It
was turned into a commercial venture by a tallow chandler (candle maker)
called Mrs Wilson who bought the recipe.
Not five minutes walk from the pudding shop, in a wholefood restaurant
called Green Apple there was no mention of the dish. Banoffi Tart, Mrs
Thatcher's favourite, explained Cathy Hessett, had taken its place.
Cathy and her husband John Lincoln, moved to Manchester from Glasgow
eight years ago. But they escaped from the city to the sprawling hills
to feast their minds and their legs on a slim volume of walks in the
Dales.
''We aim to get away every week but in practice it works out a lot
less,'' said Cathy. ''But we always come to the Green Apple. It's named
after the owner, a man called Roger Green.'' Roger didn't seem to be
around when we were there but the food would have done him proud. The
restaurant caters for omnivores -- a healthy diet of veggie dishes
(Cathy and John are vegetarians) and a smattering of meaty meals and
dimmed corners to eat them in should you feel guilty.
But the Dales is walkers' territory. The path led out of Bakewell and
along the river was like Christmas shopping on Sauchiehall Street;
literally packed, with sensible shoes and boots, cagouls and compasses.
It's only after you have dodged through the sheep droppings and got on
to the edges of the hills that it started to thin out. Even then,
though, there were plenty of fresh boot prints further along the path
that led through a narrow corridor of frost-bitten nettles on to fields
from which you could see Bakewell and a splendid panorama.
Of course, you don't have to walk the Dales. As an area it has a lot
going for it. There is a cable car at Matlock Bath just 15 miles away.
And plenty of shops to wander round in any of the main towns -- Buxton,
Matlock, Ashbourne -- with considerably more choice than you might
expect in the pretty small towns, pretty far from anywhere. (Bakewell,
interestingly, has a tiny delicatessen that does a roaring trade in
hand-made pasta, fresh pesto sauce and any cheese you could think of --
we spent about #20 in as many minutes and most of it could have been
fitted into two packed lunches).
What the Dales towns have retained is a sense of their own past.
They've clung on to the old-looking frontages of individual dress shops.
And although there are a number of big stores there isn't the
homogeneity that pervades many of the cities in England. Neither is
their a sense of history tacky and touristy. It's as though the Dales
people are at peace with themselves and don't need to prove how modern
or new-fangled they are.
Go to the National Tramway Museum in Crich and you'll see that in full
bloom. The museum is run by volunteers and has more than 50 tramcars
which trundle up and down its tracks. It was established in 1959 on the
site of a former mineral railway which had been built by the famous
engineer George Stevenson. Museum policy is to show the trams in the
settings they would once have operated. And visitors can ride in an out
of such scenes all day.
The conductors are a breezy bunch. Many seem quite happy to malign you
for holding up the queue if you're sauntering up the spiral staircases.
And it is that muck-in-and-enjoy-it attitude that gives the museum its
sense of place. It's the ideal location for train spotter types but you
don't see that many anoraks and notebooks. What you do see are lots of
faces sporting the kinds of grins you'd expect to see on the Blackpool
promenade on a rare summer's day; self-satisfied, unmistakably part of
the British Empire and never mind the knotted handkerchief.
In a country pre-occupied by progress it's comforting to know that
places such as Derbyshire seem quite happy to be left behind.

AS homeowners come to terms with the latest interest rate rises,
another 200,000 people have entered the negative equity trap, leading
financial researchers said today.
In the last three months, the number of people whose mortgage debt is
greater than the actual value of their property has reached 1.3 million,
according to researchers at broker UBS.
With most of the country's leading building societies raising their
mortgage rates, the housing market is likely to suffer a new setback nad
falling prices will only serve to escalate the negative equity problem.
Even before this week's round of mortgage payment rises, average house
prices fell by 1.7% in the last quarter of 1994.
A new magazine launched this week, entitled Inside Money, has come up
with 10 suggestions to help those who fall foul of the negative equity
trap.
It states the obvious first, that homeowners could tackle the problem
by paying off or reducing the debt. But it admits this option is beyond
most people.
So a second approach, of making more cash available, is suggested.
This could be achieved by reducing outgoings. For instance, selling a
life insurance policy, suspending pension premiums or renting out a room
in your house.
Perhaps the most drastic option is to sell your home, despite the debt
overhang, and consider renting for a period until you can afford to pay
off the debt. This will be particularly attractive if rents are low in
your area.
The one thing you must never do, says the magazine, is be tempted to
borrow from loan sharks at very high interest rates.
* The number of businesses in the UK has grown for the first time
since 1989, according to a survey by Barclays Bank.
During 1994, the number of new businesses starting up reached 446,000.

Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
has had a little rethink about his own position as the chief
harassment officer of the Tory Euro-sceptics. He sensed a bandwagon
rolling. He has jumped aboard.
He has even flung himself at Sir Teddy Taylor to try to contrive a
symbolic embrace between the extremes of Europhobe and Europhile. Come
on, Teddy, we've been MPs together for 25 years; we may have hard words
but there's still room for both of us in the same party. It is the new
Clarke line and he has had to swallow the old one to adopt it.
This fancy political footwork (a Clarke-Taylor embrace should be rated
for adults-only viewing) indicates a change in Tory morale and the
attitude towards the Tory rebels, both sponsored by the Prime Minister
himself.
Mr Clarke, like others, has had to consider his position in the new
scenario. Rather as an afterthought now he states, almost
apologetically, that he would still like a single European currency kept
as an option for the end of the century. All of a sudden, though, he
finds it necessary to say on BBC TV yesterday: ''I think John Major's
views on Europe are indistinguishable from mine. We work very closely.''
It is getting about that his arch Euro-sceptic rival in the Cabinet,
Mr Michael Portillo (one who wouldn't mind a single currency dumped
now), has reached an understanding with the Prime Minister in a
one-to-one meeting a few weeks ago. So if Mr Portillo is prepared to
temper his remarks, Mr Clarke has to do the same.
Bear in mind that it was the Chancellor who helped push Mr Major into
the Cabinet ''suicide pact'' involving the exile of the nine Tory MPs
who are now off the Whip, also the threat of a General Election.
Yesterday, Mr Clarke joined the ranks of those urging reconciliation
with the nine.
It is a measure of the change in the Prime Minister's personal
standing over the past seven days. Mr Major himself despatched the dove
of peace to the rebels on the January 15. He released another one at his
Downing Street news conference the following day.
A third was hovering around on Wednesday night when there were no
harsh words after seven rebels voted against the Government on fishing.
A fourth was offered on Thursday when he failed to get het up about the
rebels' cocky manifesto of Euro-policy demands.
Hence the ovation accorded him by the Tories at Question Time in the
Commons last week. They sense that they are about to reunite and that
their fortunes are on the turn. Mr Major is beginning to score some
telling points against Mr Blair and the Labour Party. The general view
is that he is handling himself pretty well, and is gutsy with it.
The effect is felt not only on the Tory benches. The Ulster Unionists
are watching and waiting, exerting their influence where they can and
emphasising that their nine votes are just as important to Mr Major.
They sense that London and Dublin are about to strike a deal on another
joint statement, so they are issuing warnings that any proposals about
joint, cross-border authority will severely upset them.
But they contrived with the Whips last Wednesday to ensure that there
was just enough Ulster support to ensure that the Government was not
defeated on Labour's fishing motion. Mr Major would be no better off if
he got his rebels back, only to lose Jim Molyneaux's men. Or perhaps he
wants his rebels back before he loses the Ulsters.
And what of Paddy Ashdown and his Liberal Democrats. They too are
watching the Major-Blair struggle from the sidelines. Mr Ashdown badly
needs to grab a bit of public attention and if there is a bit of an
anti-Labour bandwagon he wants to be on it too. He doesn't like a
continuing prospect of disaffected Tory voters handing by-elections to
Labour instead of the normal haven for protest that he provides.
So, here we have his Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce laying a tax
scare on Mr Blair. Yesterday he trumpeted what he called his
''costings'' of Labour commitments so far. He says he has identified 50
spending commitments totalling #13.7 billion, with only #1400m of extra
revenue. This means another 5p on the standard rate of tax, or vast
state spending cuts.
Thus the Liberal Democrats unashamedly adopt the General Election
tactics that were used by Mr Major so successfully in 1992. Mr Ashdown
is clearly hurt by the lack of Labour inclination to join forces for the
final big push to get the Tories out.
The late John Smith made it clear to Mr Ashdown that he could expect
nothing from him; in fact he regarded the Liberal Democrats as no more
than a damned nuisance. Mr Ashdown expected better things from Mr Blair
and his new-look Labour Party, but all he has received is abuse. Any
swing against Labour now will help to get him back in the action.
Mr Blair for his part is determined to see this rough patch through
without backing off from his desire to change his party's constitution.
He rounds on his critics; the change is absolutely vital, he insists, if
Labour wants to avoid becoming a mere pressure group in permanent
opposition.
The April conference on Clause 4 will provide a watershed in his
leadership which is now coming into closer focus. Tory revival, if such
it proves to be, comes a lot too soon for Mr Blair. He could have wished
for another nine months at least of sleaze and blunders and general Tory
disarray while he amalgamated defined alternative policies for
government.
Since Christmas there have been a series of Labour ''accidents'' that
have raised questions about his party's cohesion and ability to maintain
discipline. Mr Blair has spent more time in the bunker recently than Mr
Major, whose jokes seem funnier all of a sudden.
This is often the first sign of a genuine bandwagon beginning to roll.

<HEADLINE>UBS sees single currency in EU core states by 1999</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980222100</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Zurich, Sunday -- A ''core'' of European Union states including
Germany and France are likely to implement ambitious plans for a single
currency by 1999 despite scepticism and strict guidelines, the Union
Bank of Switzerland said.
A UBS study concluded that the political will and financial conditions
in at least six of the 15 EU member countries were strong enough for
them to launch a European Monetary Union plan laid out by the Maastricht
Treaty.
''A monetary union comprised of France, Germany, the Benelux countries
(Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg), and Austria appears the
likeliest constellation for a core EMU in 1999,'' said the latest UBS
International Finance newsletter.
The report by UBS economists said the core group would then be likely
to attract other EU members to meet strict Maastricht limits on public
debt, deficits, and inflation rates in order to join the common currency
club.
''The goal of one money will underpin continued monetary policy
convergence in most EU countries and keep European exchange rates more
stable than the existing 15% EMS (European Monetary System) band width
implies,'' it added.

Clare Henry looks at the work of artists who use the concept of
transformation in an individual way
A GLASS and jelly mural of fruit-flavoured condoms; a wall of water in
a dentist's waiting-room, plus a video nasty of pig slaughtering -- all
at the invitation and expense of Glasgow District Council's finance
department? Put this way, Stephen Skrynka's exhibition at Intermedia
Gallery reads like a shock horror tabloid headliner followed by words
like ''outrage'' and ''disgraceful''. Not at all. Skrynka is an
intelligent artist, a talent to watch. His show is in no way offensive,
but playful, beautiful, and thoughtful. A rare combination.
At London's prestigious Lisson Gallery an even more high-flying and
thirtysomething Glasgow-trained artist, Douglas Gordon, shows a video
called Trigger Finger together with slow-motion film of a falling
figure; a high-tension wire installation, Tightrope with Niagara Falls,
plus his optimistic Kissing 1994 slide piece. Although this is Gordon's
first London solo show, he is already internationally established with
exhibitions at the Pompidou Centre in Paris, Stuttgart, Munich,
Copenhagen, Rotterdam, and a forthcoming solo show in New York. Sadly he
is unrepresented in any Scottish museum, but already features in major
continental museums including Eindhoven's Van Abbe and London's
Contemporary Art Society.
Both videos were made in Italy by Italians but at different periods
and with very different aims. Both artists use the concept of
transformation but in an individual way.
Skrynka's amateur video diary came direct from his uncle, Carlo, who
records the continuum of life in his mother's hill-top village of
Castiglione where generations of peasants toil on the land, coo over new
babies, but, no rural idyll this, gather together since time immemorial
at the Festa del Maiale to kill their pigs, the natural mainstay of food
for the community.
With its artificial lemony tangerine taste, the innocent jelly of
children's parties is not instantly recognisable as a product of pigs'
bones, but Skrynka, the emigre artist, uses gelatine as his link between
the Castiglione Pork Festival of Southern Italy and his Glasgow
sculptures.
Recycled found objects used to be his forte (you climb through a
cast-iron bath door to get from one part of the show to the other) but
his readiness to experiment with concepts and with industrial processors
in a serious, practical hands-on way has expanded his horizon. Now his
vocabulary includes playful orange, red, and Ribena-coloured jelly
discs, some caught like Smarties in loops of bubblewrap; others cleverly
locked in a glass brick, part of the permanent gallery window.
Still more gelatine takes on the appearance of exotic fruit and
vegetables: pears, melons, or avacados set in lime and greengage jelly;
a veritable Italianate sunset wall 16 feet long and six feet high
composed of amniotic condoms in the guise of pickled fruit.
Nearby, a low table displays elegant red and green circles of glass
inset with coloured enamel. Enamel? Rubbery to touch, it turns out to be
a coating of the ubiquitous jelly.
Other materials include etched glass and cast resin plus a dramatic
giant necklace of glass cones and discs (in fact off-the-peg electrical
insulators) draped over a metal beam, both aesthetic adornment and
attention-grabbing window dressing.
More dramatic still is a 12-foot octagonal walk-in water bubble tank
installation in The Dental Practice at No. 58 across Virginia Street, a
huge relaxing and mesmeric sculpture permanently sited in the
waiting-room. ''The dentist, Lloyd Jerome, is keen on art and wanted
something to overcome people's dental phobia. He specialises in that and
has a virtual-reality headset to distract patients, the only one in the
UK. He saw my work and originally requested a small kaleidoscope. I said
'think big'. It was a real lurch of trust -- but he did!'' said Skrynka.
The commission is a triumph; a veritable, visual adventure playground.
While continuous bubbles rise up plastic walls, inside three monitors
provide ever-changing pictures: sometimes a film, sometimes electronic
images of the bubbles themselves, and occasionally the viewer. ''It's
all hitched up to a surveillance camera. A spheroscope fragments images
into a globe while two TV screens add various angles.''
Several kaleidoscopes, one voice activated (say boo and you see
wonderful purple, blue, and pink stars), form part of the metal
structure. ''I've worked in London, Australia, and Edinburgh but I
reckon Glasgow was the best place for me. It's open to fresh ideas and
more lively,'' Jerome told me. He also has art exhibitions, so anyone
can pop in.
Intermedia at 65 Virginia Street is to close when Skrynka's show ends
on February 3. This is tragic as the space is perfect, the programme
exceptional and the facility valuable, even vital. Glasgow District
Council, which is to be congratulated as one of Britain's few
far-sighted art enablers, tell me it is ''actively seeking a new space.
We will let you know as soon as our new gallery space is confirmed.''
Gordon's works are not about material transformation but about
perception, so take place in your head. Memory and the ability of the
mind to play tricks with itself and with the viewer is intrinsic to his
creations. His slow-motion Psycho at Glasgow's Tramway made us focus on
detail, both visual and psychological. Now he manipulates grim medical
archive film of Italian First World War trauma victims. A man forced to
shoot his brother finds his hand locked into the trigger finger position
and cannot shake it free. Another, physically healthy, cannot stand,
however hard he tries. Real mental torment is hard to witness; harder to
bear. Gordon's investigations heighten our awareness -- but only
vicariously, mediated via video. Could he cope with the real thing I
wonder?
There's a danger that Gordon becomes too coldly objective so I found
his piece Kissing With Sodium Pentothal, reassuring. As one of the
participants in this harmless, but endearing impromptu performance, I
was intrigued to see how the embracing figures, snapped on 38 black and
white slides, but projected in large screen format as ghostly presences
printed in negative, are transformed. Young, beautiful, smooth-skinned,
tanned, unwrinkled, relaxed, these imtimate frozen images have an
engaging spiritual quality quite unrelated to real life.
''I believe in miracles,'' states Gordon's London wall text. So while
Glasgow Museums ignore him, perhaps enterprising folk like The Dental
Practice, Aberdeen Art Gallery, East Kilbride, or Stirling's Smith
Gallery, with its exciting new acquisitions policy, could wave a magic
wand and commission work from Gordon, one of Scotland's best young
artists.

<HEADLINE>Northern attacks Trafalgar Broadside is fired against hostile bid</HEADLINE>

NORTHERN ELECTRIC this morning will fire off some hostile criticism
about Trafalgar House being a ''fit and proper'' company to run a major
utility. The tough language is contained in Northern's first defence
document against the #1200m hostile bid.
Northern has an easy target because Trafalgar House has failed
shareholders in recent years with savage asset write-downs and three
rights issues totalling #920m since June 1991 compared with the current
market capitalisation of #1160m and shareholder funds of just #700m.
Trafalgar also faced embarrassment over the Cunard QE2 public
relations disaster when the luxury liner failed to live up to its
reputation last month. Trafalgar owns the shipping company.
There is litle doubt that Trafalgar will eventually offer explanations
about its revolution in mangement style since Simon Keswick and the
Jardine group gained executive control as well as its existing exposure
to North-east England where it is already a significant employer.
Northern chairman David Morris is hoping that the bid will be referred
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which could put it on ice for
up to six months, depending upon the urgency which President of the
Board of Trade Michael Heseltine believes the matter merits.
However, Mr Heseltine to consider the effect that a prolonged
investigation would have on the #4000m flotation of the National Grid in
England and Wales, possibly in June and so could demand a much more
speedy process.
Northern has been a little slow in calling the extraordinary meeting
demanded by Trafalgar speaking by proxy for more than 10% of Northern
shareholders. The meeting is needed to change the articles of
association to allow any single shareholder to control more than 15% of
the utility's shares. The Government's Golden Share automatically lapses
at the end of March.
Mr Morris on Friday conceded that the change will be nodded through
and added that the electricity industry regulator Professor Stephen
Littlechild supports capital markets working freely and efficiently and
therefore is in principle in favour of mergers.
One argument for a reference to the MMC is emotive in that the
regional character of Northern could be diluted if Trafalgar, or another
bidder, were to succeed. However, there is nothing in legislation which
mentions regionality as a factor to be considered in a takeover.
More important in the case of any takeover of a major utility where
service to the public is laid out in legislation and through the daily
supervision of the regulator are the current and future levels of
prices, maintenance of supply, and long term capital investment.
Although it is still probably too early for some utilities to
establish a long-term record for debt rating, if a bidder has a credit
rating below that of the utility and therefore has to pay more for
funds, that will inevitably affect the cost of capital. That cost has to
be paid by the consumer.
As in most takeovers, it is easy to generate cash flow by holding back
on capital expenditure and there are obvious worries that Trafalgar may
settle for this course.
Trafalgar may have an Achilles heel, perhaps more apparent than real,
in that about a quarter of its equity is held by the Hong Kong-backed
and Bermuda-registered Jardine group. In Hong Kong, there are
uncertainties over the future of property values and these could result
in Jardine's long-term financial commitment to Trafalgar coming under
some strain.
If as rumoured ScottishPower were to bid for Northern, there would
almost certainly be an automatic reference to the MMC because the
Scottish company is a fully integrated firm. Its activities range from
power generation through distribution to retailing consumer electrical
equipment in the High Street.
In contrast, Northern and the other regional electricity companies in
England are limited largely to distribution although they may be allowed
to generate up to 15% of their own requirements -- something which would
undoubtedly attract both ScottishPower and Hydro-Electric as a home for
their surplus capacity.
There would then be a conflict between the Scottish and English
systems which would require a solution by the MMC.
As the Trafalgar offer is the first for a major utility, it does raise
the question as to which should take priority, free markets or certainty
that the public interest is being protected.
If the bid is kept away from the MMC, then it will open the flood
gates of opportunity for predators, some foreign, seeking reliable cash
flow generators but whose long-term commitment may be questionable.

Stephen McGinty examines an artist's use of football in his search for
a city's 'look'
FOOTBALL is more than just a game. It's a spherical question mark
passed from subject to subject. From politics to class on to culture and
back to identity. Now it's at the feet of artist Roderick Buchanan who
is running with it from the five-a-side pits of Paisley and Glasgow's
Townhead to the Italian city of Milan, hoping to score an answer to
ethnic identity.
On the walls of the Tramway's project room hang photographs of
Glaswegian footballers in their Italian strip of choice, some wear Inter
Milan's blue and black stripes others are in the red and black of AC
Milan. All are fixed in the uniform posture of the ''football card'',
arms behind back, eyes front. It's dull till you focus on the faces.
Instead of the expected gleam of young Mediterranean tans you're
confronted with sweaty red faces, sunburn and receding hairlines, casual
smiles and deep sneers. There are skins aged by wrinkles, covered with
beards, and occasionally a scar. One man has even perfected the
professional pride-packed stare of an internationalist, staring past the
camera and out on to the fantasy fans along the touchline. Only two look
remotely Italian.
''I wanted to explore whether there is a look to a city. Football is
really secondary to the whole idea,'' said Roddy, taking a break in his
boiler suit from hanging his subjects. ''We are right on the edge of
Europe and I don't think you could have attempted it in London or some
place like New York.''
Every night for three weeks in September 1993 and then again late last
year the artist plunged into the testosterone pits of five-a-side footie
looking for men in Milan tops. Only a few rejected his advances to pin
them against a wall and take their portrait. ''You'd get the usual wolf
whistles and homophobic crap, but most said sure and only one person
asked how they should look.''
There he met a sub-culture of blue-collar workers mixing with the band
Gun and a small group of freelance footballers. ''These guys would hang
around and when a team were a player short they would play for free.
They were also really good players.''
As a graduate of Glasgow School of Art and the University of Ulster,
Roddy has fashioned football into art on several occasions. He
previously exhibited an eight-yard length of metal two inches wide under
the heading Full Scale Premier League Goalmouth.
A video work exhibited in New York would have worked as a show-reel
for the Scotland squad. Dressed in basketball gear Buchanan played
headers with another artist for 90 minutes and entitled it Chasing 1000.
In Germany he created a psychological map using the sponsors of
premier league teams from Scotland, England, France, and his host
nation. But back at the Tramway he remains worried that audiences will
only see it on the level of the football field.
''It is a concern that people will come in and walk out because they
believe it's only about football but I hope they persevere and look past
the strips and and see that some are too young, many are too old, and
ask questions.''
One question which remains unanswered is Glaswegian men's fascination
with a northern Italian city. Buchanan believes it's nothing to do with
football but instead the focus is on the ''Latin lover''.
''I remember meeting a guy from Napoli once on holiday and talking to
him about the weird fantasy that all men want to be Italian. He snapped
back: 'Everybody wants to be Italian but it's not that easy!' '' A bit
like being a world-class footballer, in fact.

I was amused by the media reaction of public outrage at the news that
a hospital theatre sister had removed an appendix.
This operation is an uncomplicated case and is probably the simplest
of all intra-abdominal procedures, requiring only a basic knowledge of
the relevant anatomy and a moderate degree of manual dexterity.
It has long been the custom in surgical receiving units for such cases
to be delegated to a junior member of staff as a means of introducing
him/her to ''major'' surgery under the supervision of a more senior
colleague.
A fully-trained hospital theatre sister would be more than capable of
conducting the operation under supervision, with her experience of
handling instruments and of assisting at a wide variety of other
abdominal procedures.
I would more readily entrust to her the removal of my own appendix
than find myself at the mercy of an embryo surgeon whose only claim to
priority rests on the possession of a medical qualification.
It should also be noted that practising midwives are empowered to
repair, unsupervised, the surgical damage which may occur during
childbirth -- sometimes a more complicated and difficult procedure than
a simple appendicectomy.
After more than 40 years as a practising surgeon I make some claim to
know what I am talking about, which is more than can be said for the
legion of hospital administrative staff and politicians who frequently
pass judgment and pontificate in public on medical matters about which
they are less than well informed.
This was a one-off situation which is most unlikely to recur and I
suggest that all concerned (including the patient who, predictably, has
made an excellent recovery) return to work without further
recrimination.

PURCELL's Dioclesian may not be quite so richly stocked with great and
memorable melodies as some of his other glorious semi-operatic farragos,
but the masque that forms the last of its five acts makes the whole work
seem worthwhile. It certainly brought out the best in the Festival
Theatre's new chorus-in-residence, which had earlier sounded somewhat
tentative, as small choruses so often do when their members step to the
front of the platform to undertake solo roles.
It was a performance that did not always make its intentions
sufficiently plain. Juliet Cadzow's hearty spoken narration of the
Jacobean tragi-comedy about the soldier born to be emperor was
representative of one sort of approach to the piece, but the musical
side of the evening represented another. The use of small-scale forces,
complete with counter tenors, suggested that authenticity was a
priority, but it did not always work out that way. The affection that
the conductor, Eric Ibler, bestowed on the music was undermined by a
certain lack of focus. Purcellian passion emerged sounding a little
under nourished.
Presented thus in concert version, the music inevitably seemed more
like a string of excerpts than a coherent whole, though the performance
contained some lovely themes. The inter-weaving of snappy choruses and
gentle dances, or of gentle choruses and snappy dances, was deftly
achieved, and Jeni Bern sang the soprano air, What shall I do?, purely
and prettily. Too many of the solos, however, were voiced with eyes
glued to the printed page. Before the Schola Cantorum makes its next
appearance, there is work to be done.

<HEADLINE>Cadbury likely to pay #650m for Dr Pepper</HEADLINE>

THERE is intense speculation that Cadbury Schweppes will confirm this
morning that it has made an agreed $1000m (#650m) bid for the
outstanding 74.1% of the US-based Dr Pepper soft drinks company. That
may be accompanied by a rights issue which will ask shareholders to put
up perhaps #400m.
A spokeswoman for the confectionery and soft drinks giant refused to
confirm or deny the takeover of the group which also owns the Seven-Up
brand.
Cadbury eased 3p on Friday to 401p on unremarkable volume of 722,000
shares traded to capitalise the company at #3350m.
Chairman Dominic Cadbury has been stalking Dr Pepper for a
considerable time. In 1992, he increased the holding from 5.7% to 5.9%
at a cost of #156m which was financed by a #408m rights issue at 400p.
The rights isssue was also used to finance the #218m acquisition of
the A &amp; W Brands which makes root beer. That gave Cadbury a 2% share of
the US soft drinks business but it will rise to about 15% if the Dr
Pepper/Seven-Up deal is completed.
That would put Cadbury in third place behind Coca-Cola and Pepsi
although Diet-Coke on its own is a bigger seller than the Dr Pepper
brands.
Colas have suffered in America from the success of the Cott
Corporation of Canada which has penetrated the own-label markets.
Analysts, however, have questioned whether own-label colas have been as
profitable for retailers as they had hoped.
In the UK, Cadbury owns 51% of Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages which is
facing increasing pressure on profitability. It has competition from
Cott, which is supplying Richard Branson's Virgin Cola, sold through
Tesco, and also from Sainsbury's Classic Cola.
In September, Cadbury said prices had fallen by 6% because of the
competition which was helped by the above average summer weather with
volumes up 2%.
The Dr Pepper move comes as little surprise. In October, Cadbury filed
an amended Form 13D with the American SEC authorities which covers the
holdings of large stakes in American companies.
That indicated that something could be afoot and that Mr Cadbury had
at long last had some success in persuading Dr Pepper chairman John
Albers, who had stoutly resisted earlier approaches for a merger, that
it was time for a change.

ALAN Ayckbourn plays a clever game. The cosily familiar world he
portrays of comfy suburban sitting-rooms and happily married couples
should by rights be the stuff of deadly theatre. But his dazzling
ability to play around with the unities of time and place -- not to
mention his ear for a killer punchline -- ensures that his work always
has a liberating sense of the theatrical.
There is one extended scene in How the Other Half Loves, that takes
place at two different dinner tables, in two different places, on two
different nights, with two of the characters simultaneous in both
locations. Any other playwright would call this experimental; Alan
Ayckbourn takes it into the mainstream.
Alternating between the living-rooms of the Fosters and the Phillips,
the one financially well off, the other upwardly mobile, the play
follows a familiar farce pattern of deceit, cover-up, and
misunderstanding. Adultery has taken place but not between the people
everyone thinks, certainly not involving the hapless Featherstones who
are brought in as unwitting stooges.
True enough this is still that oddly unfamiliar world where Guardian
readers wear dungarees and duffel coats and Englishmen talk in plumy
baritone  voices, but in Joan Knight's perfectly timed production every
laugh falls into place all the same. There are smashing performances all
round, notably from Joanne Bett, one violet that has positively shrunk,
James Telfer, hilariously physical, and Becky Baxter, at once bubbly and
pugnacious. But it's the team work that cracks it and, with well-rounded
performances from Anne Kidd, Martyn James and Brian Cowan, this company
has developed a warm and happy rapport.

THE over-capacity in the do-it-yourself industry is set to be
partially reduced when the Sainsbury supermarket group announces later
this week that it has bought up to 200 Texas stores from Ladbroke,
writes ANDREW WILSON.
Although under chairman John Jackson, Ladbroke has installed new
management at Texas, he has made it clear that the group's focus is on
betting, casinos and hotels.
Mr Jackson indicated in September that ''no reasonable offer would be
refused for Texas'' which is expected to take at least three years to
come right.
It achieved pre-tax profits of just #2.1m on turnover of #340m and
assets of #350m in the latest six months.
In contrast, Sainbury's Homebase is the most profitable operator in
the sector albeit reflecting its move increasingly away from the stark
and not particularly customer friendly ambience of most of its ''sheds''
to something approaching a High Street retailer such as Woolworths.
When Sainsbury ties up the Texas takeover, it is thought likely to
weed-out dozens of the stores which overlap in areas where its Homebase
stores have already got a strong presence.

I have had the pleasure of experiencing one of Scotland's treasures,
travelling on the West Highland Line from Queen Street to Mallaig, more
than five hours of exquisite scenery. The views just take your breath
away.
Unfortunately the train was under-used. One reason may have been the
poor weather, but I think the real reason is the cost. A Super Saver
costs #32, and since there were eight to 10 people on board this would
net about #320.
I spoke to a member of staff who said that in the weeks leading up to
Christmas ScotRail ran a special #5 return on the route, resulting in
something like an Indian railway scene, except that there were no people
on the roof or the running boards. That would net around #650 each
journey.
I accept that #5 is not a realistic price but a trial period at a fare
of around #12.50 to #15 might get ''bottoms on seats'' if well
advertised.
It might bring in much needed revenue and secure the long-term future
of the line.
One other point: some of the magnificent views between Garelochhead
and Ardlui are now somewhat obscured by mature trees.
With community service now playing a large part of the penal system,
it could be used to lop off the tops of the trees. A further good point
would be to distribute the wood to pensioners to help them through the
cold winters.

You reported that the NHS eye examination is now only available to 40%
of the population following government changes in 1989 (December 28).
Using data collected by the profession and the Department of Health
which show that approximately 50% of eye examinations are carried out
privately and 50% through the NHS it is possible to use the figures
which John McCallion, MP, has highlighted to show that the total number
of eye examinations in Scotland in 1992 was only 1.07 million.
This compares with 1.17 million examinations in 1988. In other words,
five years after the changes it is still true to say that fewer people
are having their eyes examined. Indeed, during the period since the
changes there has been a catastrophic drop in the total numbers and we
are only seeing a very slow recovery.
Mr McCallion's points about the long-term cost to the NHS because of
missed diagnosis are also sadly true. The economic effects of this
privatisation will far outweigh any financial savings.

Penny Lewis refuses to accept the idea that the Japanese would have
continued the war indefinitely if the atomic bombs had not been dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. She deludes herself (January 14).
Until the very end the Japanese were never willing to surrender
unconditionally as required by the Allies and as reinforced by the
Potsdam Declaration following the end of the European war.
From mid-1942 onwards the Japanese were willing to stop the war on the
basis of hanging on to whatever empire they had established. That
remained the Japanese position right up until 1945.
American intelligence and diplomatic services were aware that there
was some degree of peace movement in Japan but the militarist faction
controlled the Supreme War Council.
During the development of the atomic weapons the Americans considered
arranging through neutral channels for a demonstraiton explosion which
Japanese representatives could attend and see for themselves. It was
decided (no doubt correctly) that the Japanese would not accept or be
impressed by any such demonstration.
The loss of life in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was clearly hideous but
there can be no doubt that a great many more lives -- both military and
civilian -- would have been lost if the two bombs had not forced the
Japanese to surrender.
The sacrifice of these Japanese civilians was not, however, in vain.
Much more powerful weapons of destruction have been tested since 1945
but not one of them has produced the emotional impact which people still
feel when they consider the Hiroshima and Nagasaki experiences.
It is my own view that what happened in August, 1945, was a primary
factor in preventing the United States and the Soviet Union from
embarking on any kind of military adventures against each other during
the subsequent years.

THERE'S a description somewhere in the middle of Stuart Thomas's
Second World War memory play of the aftermath of a bombing of a Glasgow
pet shop. Told from the perspective of a child, it is an image full of
dramatic potential, highlighting the brutality, indifference and
senselessness of war.
I'd like to say that this description -- based on a real incident --
had a central place in I'll Be Seeing You but disappointingly, it's just
one of a sequence of events, given no more emotional weight than the
trip to the air raid shelter, the bad news telegram, or the badly cooked
fish pie.
In fact, for all Thomas's research -- he based the play on
conversations with elderly people in Dalmarnock -- and for all the
period songs, sung elegantly, if a little mechanically, by Alyson Orr,
I'll Be Seeing You isn't really about the war at all. Rather it is about
the relationships between four women keeping the home fires burning, the
pubescent Susan (Pauline Lockhart), her liberated sister-in-law Kathleen
(Morag Stark), her mother (Muriel Romanes), and her mother's snooty best
friend, Mrs Ross (Mary Riggans).
Nothing wrong with that and you can see why such a strikingly good
cast has come together for the show. Thomas's language is sharp, funny
and well observed, and you don't get such chunky parts for women every
day. It's also perfectly pitched at its target audience. This is all
fine, but it would have been nice to see a play that didn't trade on
nostalgia alone, that told you something about the war you didn't
already know, and it put greater demands on the audience and on a
clearly talented writer.

The Coastwatch results published recently show Strathclyde as having
high counts of sanitary items in the beach litter. A recent survey
carried out by the West of Scotland Glasgow Group of the Marine
Conservation Society bears this out. We counted 183 plastic sanitary
towel/panty liner backing strips in 16 square metres of shore at the
head of Loch Long.
It is almost impossible for water and sewage authorities to extract
these thin pieces of plastic as they pass through the sewage system and
the only quick and final solution to this unsightly problem is for women
to bin it and not flush it.

THE question of why Britain denied entry to 1000 Jewish orphans who
then went to the death camps in 1942 will be recalled at a meeting next
weekend to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the liberation of
Auschwitz.
The case will be said to typify the alleged failure of Winston
Churchill's government to attempt anything which might have diminished
the savagery of the Nazis' anti-semitic terror.
Fred Barschak, a member of the Holocaust memorial committee of the
Board of Deputies of British Jews, will ask why Hitler's mass-murder
machine went unchallenged for two years after the War Cabinet told the
House of Commons of its existence.
Mr Barschak claimed: ''Lives could have been saved -- not millions,
but hundreds of thousands. Again and again, measures could have been
taken.
''The British government had the knowledge and the means to act, but
did nothing.''
Home Secretary Herbert Morrison, the Labour statesman, presided over
Whitehall meetings which resisted an offer made by the government of
collaborationist Vichy France to give 1000 children exit visas in
September 1942.
The youngsters, aged four to 14, were the sons and daughters of Jews
Marshal Petain's regime had deported to death camps in Poland.
Minutes of the meetings show that Mr Morrison, whose wife was Jewish,
believed the children's arrival might ''stir up an unpleasant degree of
anti-semitism, of which there is a fair amount just below the surface,
and that would be bad for the country and the Jewish community''.
The children are believed to have followed their parents to Auschwitz
after the Germans occupied Vichy France.
General Vasily Petrenko, commander of the Russian infantry division
which liberated the extermination camp south of Krakow on January 27,
1945, will tell Sunday's commemorative meeting what he saw.
The 1.1 million victims included 960,000 Jews, 75,000 Poles, 23,000
gipsies, and 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war.
Russian troops found stores of human hair -- intended for stuffing
mattresses -- which weighed two tonnes.
Recently released papers from Churchill's intelligence archives show
that Britain knew of the death toll at Auschwitz by the summer of 1942.
Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden told the Commons on December 17, 1942,
that Germany was ''now carrying into effect Hitler's oft-repeated
intention to exterminate the Jewish people in Europe''.
Members stood for a minute's silence.
Mr Barschak said Churchill ordered the bombing of railway lines
leading to Auschwitz in July 1944.
But civil servants at the Foreign Office secretly blocked the order,
believing that deportations of Jews to Auschwitz had stopped.
The gas chambers continued to operate until the end of October -- but
the murder of camp inmates continued until the eve of liberation by the
Russian forces.

EXCLUSIVE
THE Government is set to run into fresh trouble over the amount of
money being spent on general practitioner fund holders in Scotland.
New figures from the Scottish Office show the total spent on
management allowances for GP fund holders is to increase from #3,114,000
in 1993-94 to an estimated #4,198,000 in 1994-95.
Scottish Office Ministers have made it clear they are determined to
see an increase in the number of patients in Scotland treated by
fund-holding practices, but Labour is becoming increasingly concerned
that a two-tier health service is being created.
The new figures demonstrate that management allowances for GP fund
holders will rise this year in every health board area in Scotland. In
Grampian, spending will go up from #1,006,000 to #1,190,000. In Greater
Glasgow, the rise will be from #275,000 to #509,000, and in Lothian the
increase will be from #428,000 to #717,000.
In a series of Commons written replies issued late last week, Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton said the estimated expenditure for 1994-95 was
based on health board forecasts. GP practices could be approved for
entry to the fund-holding scheme at any time during the year and
therefore ''the estimate of expenditure for 1994-95 may underestimate
actual expenditure''.
The Government faced charges last week that it was blatantly seeking
to encourage GP fund holders against those operating outside the scheme.
In the House of Lords, Labour peer Lord Bruce of Donington highlighted
the fact that Lord James's colleague, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, had held
a reception for GP fund holders at Edinburgh Castle which cost the
taxpayer almost #1100.
Lord Fraser said at the time there were 107 GP fund holders in
Scotland, covering 20% of the population, and it was anticipated
something like 30% would be covered during 1995-96.
That target has been confirmed by Lord James, who has disclosed that
all health boards, other than Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles,
have agreed with the management executive an objective of achieving at
least 30% coverage of the population in the year ahead.
He said the Scottish Office had provided funding for an independent
evaluation of the impact of GP fund holding on patient care, but at the
same time the Government was pressing ahead with canvassing interest
among ''experienced'' GP fund-holding practices in Scotland to
participate in up to six new pilot projects.
These will aim to evaluate the possible benefits of fund-holding
practices having the option of purchasing all hospital and community
health services on behalf of their patients.
Lord James said: ''These new arrangements are intended to facilitate
the process whereby GP practices enter the fund-holding scheme in a more
flexible way. The resultant participation by increased numbers of
practices will assist health boards to ensure that their purchasing of
health services for patients is led by primary care priorities.''
The Cunninghame South Labour MP, Mr Brian Donohoe, who has taken a
special interest in health matters and who tabled the Commons questions
to Lord James, said yesterday: ''It is perfectly clear that the
Government is actively encouraging GP fund holders at vast expense to
the taxpayer. Driven by dogma, Ministers are in grave danger of driving
a wedge between GP fund holders and non-fund holders and of damaging the
long-term interests of the people who really matter -- the patients.''

CONDITIONAL jockey Mark Roberts picked up a two-day 'whip ban' at
Catterick on Saturday after being found guilty of improper riding on the
Chris Thornton-trained newcomer Gordon, narrow winner of the division
two of the Bonusprint National Hunt Flat Race.
The local stewards decided that Roberts had struck his mount with
unreasonable frequency in the closing stages of the two-mile event. The
suspension takes effect on January 30 and 31.

ITALIAN Alberto Tomba won his ninth successive World Cup slalom
yesterday, destroying his rivals yet again to thrill the crowds in
Wengen, Switzerland.
Leading after the first leg, he produced a scintillating second run to
make it seven slaloms out of seven.
His winning time of 1min 33.89sec put him well clear of Swiss Michael
von Gruenigen (1-35.21) with Jure Kosir (Slovenia) third in 1-35.28.
Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli finished tenth to clinch his second
combination event win after success in Kitzbuehel last week.

RESEARCH to find a cure for epilepsy could be threatened by the
Government's health reforms, a leading neurologist claimed yesterday.
Dr Simon Shorvon, medical director for the National Society for
Epilepsy, will warn Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley of the threat to
patients' chances of being referred to specialist facilities when she
visits the society's headquarters at Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire,
today.
He said: ''Our fear is that the internal market will inhibit referrals
to us because of cost.
''If patients are seen locally, they cannot hope to benefit from the
kind of skills and experiences of our epilepsy specialists, our
diagnostic facilities, and treatment based on clinical research.
''This concentration of excellence cannot hope to be achieved
regionally. It must be retained for the benefit of patients with
epilepsy.
''In recent years, we have had many outstanding successes with
patients whose lives have been transformed by accurate diagnosis and
treatment.''
Hospitals across the country refer thousands to the society for
specialist medical treatment every year.
The society works closely with the National Hospital for Neurology and
Neurosurgery in London and jointly runs an NHS assessment unit at the
society's headquarters.
Dr Shorvon, who with his team of consultants carries out extensive
research into the disease at London's Institute of Neurology, said:
''This unique relationship between charity, hospital, and a university
department may well be threatened by reorganisation of the Special
Health Authorities in London, of which the National Hospital is one.
''Our clinical research programme has a reputation world-wide and was
alpha-rated in the recent review of research. This must be protected. If
there is to be a major breakthrough, a cure for this devastating
conditon, our research activity must not only continue but increase.
''The cost of supporting research does not compare with the cost of
supporting the many thousands of people with severe epilepsy throughout
their lives.''
More than 350,000 people in Britain, including 100,000 children, have
epilepsy, the most common of all serious neurological disorders.
There are 30,000 new cases each year but only three neurologoists per
5000 patients. Nationally, there are 200 neurolgists -- of whom only 20
specialise in epilepsy.
During her visit to the society's headquarters, Mrs Bottomley will see
the final building stages of the world's first brain-scanning unit
dedicated to epilepsy diagnosis and research, scheduled to open later
this year.
A public appeal led by Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers,
in collaboration with industry and charity, has raised more than #2m to
pay for the unit.
* Setting up NHS trust hospitals has cost more than #120m -- which
could instead have paid for 6000 qualified nurses or 3000 extra
consultants, Labour claimed yesterday.
The figures for the cost of red tape, drawn from Commons replies,
showed for the first time how much the trust experiment had cost the
taxpayer, said Darlington MP Alan Milburn, a member of the Commons
Public Accounts Committee.
Of the total, #103.5m was spent in England, #8.6m in Scotland, #5.4m
in Wales, and #2.6m in Northern Ireland.
Each hospital preparing to be a trust had received up to #300,000 in
start-up grants from the public purse.
Mr Milburn will question NHS chief executive Alan Langlands about the
figures during a Public Accounts Committee hearing later today.

IN the third title fight on the SECC bill, Scottish bantamweight
champion James Murray, from Newmains, give one of the best performances
of his career when he stopped Anglo-Scot Louis Veitch in the third
round.
Murray finished the job with a swinging right to the head which had
Veitch down for eight and then a left hook to the body which again
produced an eight count. Referee John King stepped in.
The biggest upset of the night was caused by Glasgow welterweight
Gordon Blair, who outpointed Dublin's Michael Carruth over six rounds.
Other results:
Super-bantam -- Brian Carr (Moodiesburn) outpointed Shaun Anderson
(Maybole) six rounds; Light -- Dave Anderson (Glasgow) outpointed Carlos
Lopez (Spain) eight rounds; Super-middle -- Sean Heron (Edinburgh)
outpointed Simon McDougall (Blackpool) four rounds; Light-heavy -- John
Wilson (Edinburgh) beat Tim Robinson (Grimsby) referee stopped contest

WOULD you believe it? ''Prince'' Naseem Hamed actually underestimated
himself for the defence of his World Boxing Council International
super-bantamweight title at the SECC in Glasgow on Saturday night.
The unbeaten 20-year-old from Sheffield, who makes Gary Glitter look
like an introvert, claimed that he would stop Mexican challenger Armando
Castro in the fifth round. Instead, he produced such a devastating
performance of class and aggression that referee Mickey Vann stepped in
to call a halt after one minute 52 seconds of the fourth.
Castro was a sad, sorry sight as Hamed chased him round the ring,
spearing him with precise jabs and hitting him with every punch in the
book. The 31-year-old Mexican, who had taken part in 62 contests,
including three world title fights, had only ever been stopped by cuts
in the past. This time he was totally outclassed and outgunned. The fact
that Castro had obviously seen his best days as a fighter should take
nothing away from Hamed.
The sell-out crowd loved every minute of it, from the moment the arc
lights picked out the little Englishman on his way towards the ring.
They roared their approval as he did a back flip over the ropes and
applauded every move after that, including his victory somersault.
The Scottish boxing fan does not normally take to a showboater, unless
he can back it up with genuine class. Hamed certainly showed he could
quite possibly live up to his boast that he will become the greatest
fighter ever prouced by Britain. Of course there is a long way to go
before he can ask us to pin that accolade on him, but I already believe
another of his claims -- that he will win a world title before the year
is out.
Before that, however, if he wants to step down a weight, he has to
make a defence of the European bantamweight title he also holds -- and,
to repay the tremendous backing from the Scottish fans on Saturay night,
promoter Frank Warren would stage that fight, against Denmark's Johnny
Bredhal, in Glasgow on March 4.
Said Hamed: ''I have thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Glasgow, everyone
has been so kind and supportive. I love all my Scottish fans and I am
delighted I will be back.''
Castro didn't have a chance from the opening bell. It was one-way
traffic with the champion landing telling punches while not even looking
at the challenger. Castro waved his arms and beckoned Hamed forward. The
man from Sheffield obliged.
Castro took a count of eight in the fourth when Hamed threw a
thundering overarm right to his head. The end was in sight and with
Castro trapped on the ropes, the referee stopped it to signal the
champion's sixteenth straight win.
Another hero with the fans was the amazing Dennis Andries, from
London, who claims to be 48 years old. He won the vacant British
cruiserweight title, almost 15 years after his first British
championship challenge, by stopping Denzil Browne, from Leeds, in the
eleventh round.
Andries was played into the ring to the Beatles classic ''When I'm
64'', but it was the 26-year-old Browne who couldn't last the pace.

JUST more than a year ago Damian Cronin's international career
appeared to be in tatters. He had played -- not well -- in the
disastrous 51-15 defeat by New Zealand and was promptly dropped.
He had serious injuries to an ankle and pelvis, was overweight, and
was over 30. ''Nobody had actually said 'goodbye' but I could see the
exit signs flashing, and it was the worst time of my career,'' he
admitted. ''I was absolutely determined that it was not going to end
like that.''
So 'Del Boy', the man who had played 29 times for his country, the
British Lions' lock, decided that drastic action was needed. He quit
London Scottish to head for French second division side Bourges, wife
and baby, Callum, in tow, and worked harder on his fitness than ever
before.
''I kept telling myself that I could make it to the World Cup, that I
could do a job for Scotland. I missed like hell being out of the
squad.''
His comeback began in the Scotland A victory over South Africa at
Melrose, the most heartening win of the past few years. Cronin was
outstanding at the lineout and continued to press his claims during the
district championship.
At one stage he turned out for the Exiles on a Saturday and flew back
to Bourges for a Sunday match. When the Exiles took the district title
for the first time, Damian's knock on the selectors' door could not go
unanswered.
He was a star performer against Canada, climaxing his return with the
game's only try. ''Chick (Chalmers) made the half-break and gave me the
ball -- was it about the halfway line? -- and I just scorched in from
there.'' It was a run of about 15 metres, in fact, but the most
important try he may ever score.
Cronin was born in West Germany of a soldier father and Musselburgh
mother -- ''believe it or not, I still have trouble renewing my British
passport'' -- but there has never been any doubt where his allegiance
lay. He told me on Saturday night that his second child, expected in
May, is going to be called Fraser, ''whether it is a boy or a girl.''
Gavin Hastings singled him out for a special mention -- ''It is good
to have you back'' -- and hooker Kenny Milne spoke of how the big man's
scrummaging had improved noticeably this season. I think we can pencil
his name in for the visit to Springbok country.
Hastings was, by the way, quite unmoved by those in the crowd who
booed his decisions to take kicks at goal. ''We were attempting to win a
very important international -- I was going to take every chance we were
offered.''
Conditions at Murrayfield were a good deal more severe than many
spectators realised. Cronin was still shivering 10 minutes after he had
come out of a hot bath.
Rob Wainwright, an Army doctor, told me that the last half-hour was as
physically demanding as any he had experienced. ''I thought our defence
was tested and proved to be sound when the Canadians tried to run at
us.''
Ian Jardine had thoroughly enjoyed his day. The big Stirling centre
had been more involved than in any of his previous internationals and
had constantly crossed the gain line with the ball in his hands. ''I
think we can build on that performance,'' he said.
New cap Eric Peters admitted that he had found it a stamina-sapping
experience in the closing stages but had relished every moment of the
match. ''To start with a victory is a great feeling.''
''It is my first in 11 games,'' chipped in the irrepressible Kenny
Logan, who was denied a try when he was just forced into touch at a
corner.
The man with least to smile about was Welsh touch judge Dave Davies.
He pulled a hamstring and was then smashed on the face, breaking his
nose, when a television cameraman collided with him. And Wales were
beaten as well!

IT was the Sean Rafferty prog on Radio Ulster last Monday when I was
across the water, and I was appearing on it when I realised that
snobbery is endemic to sport in the British Islands.
Walter Mitchell, the veteran Irish oarsman, was alongside me and was
talking of the history of Irish rowing and especially of the club about
which he had just written a book, a kind of anthology of the
achievements of the Belfast Rowing Club.
There was Ken, a stalwart of Irish rowing, who also spoke. And
although I had done my sports spot, concerning my last book The Sporting
Urban Voltaire, before the pair of them, I was dragged in simply because
I had gone to Allan Glen's, a school noted for rowing.
My school was damn-near two miles from the river but for more than
half a century, we were still one of the top rowing schools, and our FP
club was prominent in all that time too.
But the question of access -- snobbery really -- came up. Allan Glen's
was odd in that respect. It was a school for bright working-class boys
which, inexplicably, was into rowing. For rowing was -- is -- an
upper-class pastime.
And so said my Belfast colleagues. For originally rowing was for the
professional watermen, the canal workers, and indeed the fisherfolk. It
is hardly surprising that working folk would produce a sport for their
odd few hours of leisure. But bit by bit, rowing came eventually to
exclude the working stiffs, the watermen, and came to mean Henley in
stripey blazers, and the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race with girls in hats
and frocks and even some of the men at that.
The explosion of sport in nineteenth century Britain meant that what
had previously been rude rubes knocking hell out of each other on a
village green would turn into something entirely more genteel.
The workies couldn't get much time to themselves and the toffs could.
The result was that sport became important to upper-class life. The
lower orders had to find a way in.
First was boxing. The bruisers taught the Regency bucks, and then got
so good that wagers were made. And then the aristos started making money
out of it. With the new muscular Christianity of the public schools,
sport became more important, and so did the professional aspect of it.
Working men helped out the scions of the peerage, taught them how to
box, play cricket and footy, even rugby. Lots of other sports.
Don't forget that the most aristocratic of any sport -- fencing -- was
taught in France and Austria and, oddly, Switzerland, by mercenaries,
many of them Scots.
Sport became especially important first as a public school ethos and
later as a means of diverting the ragged, trousered philanthropists of
an industrial age from revolution, so prevalent in Europe throughout the
last century.
But the class divides were yet important to maintain. Wars won on the
playing fields of Eton? Drivel. They were won by wee shilpit peasants
and industrial workers, but a proletariat and peasantry which required
organisation.
Gentlemen versus Players sounds ridiculous now but it was a reality
when I was a child, youth, and even young man. Soccer became
professional in the days of its infancy yet I can still recollect that R
S McColl was considered an amateur, even if he did run sweet shops.
We are talking of class-consciousness here. The sort which found me
last year at the opening of the really classy salmon beat at Kenmore in
Perthshire on the River Tay.
There was a demonstration from the lower orders then, right in the
Square of Kenmore. I agreed and didn't at the same time with both sides.
See next week for my conclusion on snobbery. But bear this in mind, it
is endemic in sport. Next week will prove it.

IRELAND'S Roman Catholic leader, Cardinal Cahal Daly, yesterday called
on the English to forgive ''the wrongs and hurts inflicted by Irish
people''.
In a sermon at Canterbury Cathedral, preaching on the theme Living
With Peace, Dr Daly called for reciprocal healing and forgiveness
between Christians on all sides of the conflict.
It was the first time an Irish Catholic bishop had preached at
Canterbury since the Reformation.
Dr Daly said: ''I wish to ask forgiveness from the people of this land
for the wrongs and hurts inflicted by Irish people upon the people of
this country on many occasions during that shared history, and
particularly in the past 25 years.''
However, Dr Daly, who is expected to retire this year, warned that a
slide back to conflict remained a ''stark possibility''.
Another sermon was given by his Protestant opposite number, Church of
Ireland Primate Archbishop Robin Eames.
He said Northern Ireland's two communities needed to know that, while
great demands would be made from both as the cost of lasting peace,
''neither will be sacrificed''.

WESTERN Klick Photopoint put together their most influential
performance of the indoor hockey season to beat Menzieshill 8-2 at Perth
on Saturday to move ahead of championship favourites Edinburgh Ladies at
the top of the table on goal difference.
This advantage may only be temporary, for the capital girls have a
match in hand, but the fact that Western's touch is returning will make
for an interesting cup campaign.
Bonagrass kindled thoughts of grandeur by beating Hyndland 5-2.
The form of the leading contenders in Pool B of the league was rather
erratic, with the three main contenders for the title, Clydesdale, Royal
High Gymnasts, and Melrose, all suffering defeats.
Clydesdale, with internationals Jackie Lothian, Gail Crawford, and
Hailey Welsh, in their side suffered the biggest upset of all, losing
7-4 to Boroughmuir.
The implementation of promotion and relegation in the men's indoor
league ensures that the top eight teams in the country will again
contest the first-division next season. Insights Inverleith and Touche
Ross, who became detached from their rivals at the end of the first
phase, are now back in the fold after booking their places in the final
round of matches yesterday in Pool B.
Terry Spinks of Rosyth Fishheads gave the best individual performance
of the weekend, scoring 16 goals in the course of Saturday.

A win, Hallelujah! On Thursday afternoon, Richie Dixon, the forwards'
coach, was playing double bluff. ''As far as the public's concerned,
we're rucking, and we're only rucking,'' he said. ''OK JB? Understand?''
I nodded, and understood.
We saw one of Scottish rugby's biggest changes in playing style on
Saturday, as backs and forwards abandoned, or at least attempted to
abandon, going to ground to present the ball late.
Instead, forwards passed before contact, and backs tried to off-load
the ball before the hit.
It was a pleasing sight to see the likes of Cronin and Morrison
running in space, and then looking for the pass. It was good, it was
novel, and on a dry day we'd have blown the Canadians off the pitch.
Passing out of the tackle, or before it, can be a dangerous way to play,
but the New Zealand schoolboys demonstrated ably in the warm-up game how
effective it can be to give a pop pass to a straight runner.
Jim Telfer said on Radio Scotland at half-time that there were too
many passes for the conditions, and the game plan was changed by Dougie
Morgan at the break, but it was there for all to see in the first half.
But, and call me a mincing old poofter if you will, it is worth
harking back to Jim Telfer's edict at the start of the season, which was
hastily altered for public consumption, that some fancy footwork would
be allowed to activate the ball.
Let's assume that the Canadians were on the ball on the ground
aplenty. It seemed that way to me.
Well, if the Canadians had been playing the All Blacks, I cannot help
but think that, within 15 minutes of the start, they would have been
persuaded to jump out the road in every ruck.
Bits of steel New Zealand stud would have been tangling with torn
Canuck testicle, and mangling bits of severed finger, and several of
their players would have had to change jerseys because of stud rips in
their backs.
But we did not do that, we were too nice. Cronin did a bit of damage,
as did Peter Wright and the big rawboned new cap, Stuart Campbell, but I
swear I saw some of our players stepping over bodies. Over bodies? Good
God, 'tis one of life's pleasures, afforded only through rugby these
days, sadly, to be allowed to stand on helpless opponents from another
land who are trying to prevent you from getting at the ball and winning
for your country.
The punters thought it was a dreadful game, and as a spectacle it was
not helped by an over-eager referee, but to moan too much would be
churlish. As Big Jill from Haddington says: ''Sometimes you've got to
pretend it was good . . . even if it was a little disappointing.''

A KEY figure in the Lockerbie bombing inquiry has been freed by
Germany in what is thought to be part of a secret deal with Iran. This
effectively blocks the opportunity for Scottish detectives to question
him, it emerged yesterday.
It led to strong condemnation from West Lothian MP Tam Dalyell, who
was behind the move to screen the film, The Maltese Double Cross, in the
House of Commons after it was withdrawn from a London film festival amid
fears that it might attract legal action.
Today he intends to present a letter to the Prime Minister expressing
further doubts about complicity between the German Government and Iran.
Details were made known at the weekend about the release of
Syrian-born Palestinian Abdel Ghadanfar, one of two terrorists jailed in
Germany after being arrested in Frankfurt in October 1988, two months
before PanAm flight 103 was blown up. Ghadanfar was released in
November.
He was jailed for 12 years and his accomplice, Hafez Dalkamoni, was
given a 15-year sentence. At the time, the German anti-terrorist agency,
Verfassungschutz, recovered bomb-making equipment similar to that used
to blow up the jet.
Scottish detectives have never been able to question the two men.
Yesterday, Mr Dalyell said that he had repeatedly asked questions about
the position taken by the German authorities.
He added: ''Discussions should have taken place and I assert, on my
own responsibility, that the Scottish police found the German agencies
extraordinarily unco-operative.''
The Germans, he said, were not incompetent people and he felt there
were two substantial reasons for their lack of help in the inquiry.
''The first is their commercial interest with Iran and, secondly, they
do not want to accept responsibility for what happened at the airport in
Frankfurt.''
That is where the bomb which caused the explosion and the death of 270
passengers on board, besides townspeople, is thought to have been
loaded. The freed terrorist is now thought to be in Syria following his
deportation.
Dr Jim Swire, spokesman for relatives of the Lockerbie victims, later
endorsed the MP's views. He is currently starting a petition for
presentation to the European Parliament in March, asking it to make a
statement on Lockerbie.
He said: ''It now seems certain that Ghadanfar will never be
questioned officially.''

Scotland 22, Canada 6
HOLD the bunting, keep the champagne on ice, but savour the win. At
long last the unpalatable sequence of nine games without a taste of
victory is at an end. The win was the thing but, as skipper Gavin
Hastings realistically conceded, it gives the Scots no more than a
foothold on the first rung of the ladder back to the higher reaches of
rugby respectability.
But let us not be churlish. This was a game of pressure-laden
intensity for the new-look Scotland side. It was a test of character,
too, for Hastings, for the coaches and for the management. With the Five
Nations' campaign set to get under way against the Irish at Murrayfield
on February 4, they had to establish a morale-boosting platform and rid
themselves of the losers' tag. Mission accomplished.
Canada, though, were woefully short of the tactical and technical nous
required from a top-rate international side, and the Scots know only too
well that stiffer challenges lie ahead.
Scotland controlled the game up front, where the scrummage was solid
and the lineout worked like a dream. True, Canada suffered from the
injury-induced replacement of the 6ft 6ins lock Kevin Whitley but, for
Scotland, the spring-heeled debutant Stewart Campbell and a remarkably
rejuvenated Damian Cronin -- who crowned his return with a try -- ruled
supreme on the touchlines.
The importance of what adherents of the Association code are wont to
refer to as ''getting a result'' was reflected in the manner of
Scotland's victory. Just the single try plus five penalties and a
conversion from Hastings seemed scant reward for such a monopoly of
possession and the Murrayfield crowd became restive as the skipper --
with a strike rate of six successes from 10 attempts -- opted for the
boot rather than a more expansive approach.
Of the three new caps in the side, Campbell was outstanding at the
lineout, Bath's Dave Hilton was a more than adequate replacement for the
injured Alan Sharp, and Eric Peters -- who struggles for inclusion in
the embarrassment of riches which is the Bath back-row -- performed the
chores of an international No.8 as if to the manner born.
But behind the scrum there are, perhaps, more difficult questions for
the selectors to answer as they sit down on Tuesday to choose the team
to meet Ireland.
The Melrose combination of Bryan Redpath and Craig Chalmers, as is
only to be expected, gelled well. Redpath, who must still be under
threat from the bench-sitting Derrick Patterson, did all that was
required of him and Chalmers represented a commanding presence at
fly-half.
The conditions at Murrayfield on Saturday were atrocious. A bitter
chill was accompanied by constant drizzle and, for a while, snow. In the
Sport of Kings the going would have been described as ''heavy.'' In
short, this was not the climatic setting for champagne, running rugby.
Horses for courses, then, and in Ian Jardine at inside centre, the
Scots had the odds-on favourite. He invariably breached the gain-line,
giving his forwards something to work on. But, and it is a big but,
whether he is the man on a dry pitch to feed those outside him is
another matter entirely. His partner in the centre, Gregor Townsend --
who had an unconvincing game maybe as a result -- would, perhaps, agree.
Out on the wings, where the greatest danger was posed not by the
opposition but by hypothermia, Kenny Logan hustled and bustled and had a
''try'' disallowed near the end. His appetite for the game and his
youthful confidence was a restorative tonic on such a marrow-chilling
day.
Craig Joiner, his counterpart on the right flank, with two caps from
the Argentinian tour, did not have a joyful Murrayfield debut. He is
young and probably deserves the chance to atone for his sins but he was
vulnerable under the high ball, a frailty which the Irish -- those
inventors of the garryowen -- will have noted with devilish glee.
And then we have Big Gav himself. It was a delight to see the Scotland
captain back in sorts. Rock steady under the steepling high ball, and
authoritative with his intrusions into the threequarter line, Scotland's
favourite rugby son will no doubt rue those missed penalty shots. But he
has suffered with dignity the slings and arrows of outrageous misfortune
since that last win against Wales in 1993 and his confidence will be on
a new-found high when the Irish arrive on Saturday week.
Scotland led 12-6 at the interval by virtue of Hastings's penalty
goals which countered two from Canada's Gareth Rees. The try arrived on
the hour mark and it came from man-of-the-match Cronin. Peters drove,
Chalmers broke blind, and Del Boy was at his shoulder to take the
scoring pass. Hastings converted and -- to the displeasure of the crowd
-- kicked a further penalty to complete the scoring.

A few months after I was appointed Glasgow's official propagandist in
1975 I said to Sir Alexander Gibson, ''What do you think of the idea of
the city commissioning a piece of music to be named after it, like
Glasgow Symphony or Concerto. After all, other cities have musical works
name after them: The London Symphony, Paris Suite, Warsaw Concerto,
Symphony of San Francisco, Leningrad Symphony.''
Alex thought it was a great idea and promised to support my proposal
to the council. He told me there was even an Edinburgh Symphony, written
by the Edinburgh-born composer and conductor Guy Warrack, and first
performed at the Royal College of Music in London in 1932.
We even talked about what a grand occasion we could make the premiere,
but my political masters thought it was a rotten idea. ''It would cost
us a helluva lot of money and then we might not like it,'' they said.
I tried to argue that it would be a magnificent public relations
exercise for the city and that there was hardly a piece of music of any
kind that some people didn't like, but all to no avail. Not that most of
them would have known the difference between barber shop music and
Zoltan Kodaly's Dances of Marosszek.
It took more than a decade and the appointment of Robert Palmer as
festival director before the city commissioned about 40 musical works
for ''culture year'', but even with Palmer's heroic efforts there still
isn't a Glasgow Concerto. But it's not too late, Pat. Maybe you could
even write it.

Los Angeles, Sunday
BRITAIN'S Hugh Grant, who played the elusive bachelor of Four Weddings
and a Funeral, won a major American award at the weekend for best comedy
performance of 1994 as Hollywood kicked off its film award season with
the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Golden Globes presentation.
''It's tragic how much I'm enjoying getting this. Virtually uncool,''
Grant said in his acceptance speech. ''You're supposed to think awards
are invidious, but this is heaven.''
British actress Miranda Richardson took the Golden Globe for best
supporting actress in a television series or made-for-TV movie for
Fatherland, released on the HBO network, while Edward James Olmos took
similar honours for supporting actor in The Burning Season, about the
destruction of the South American rain forests.
Martin Landau won best supporting actor in a motion picture for his
role as veteran horror film star Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood, while Jamie Lee
Curtis took best supporting actress in a musical or comedy motion
picture for True Lies.
Quentin Tarantino, the director of the much-heralded psychodrama set
in Los Angeles, Pulp Fiction, won for best screenplay for a motion
picture.
The Golden Globes are considereed a good barometer of who will receive
Hollywood's most coveted awards, the Oscars, presented in March, and
Tarantino was also nominated for a Globe as best director.
Landau said he had no butterflies in his stomach thinking that his
Golden Globe might lead to an Oscar nomination, and ultimately an
Academy Award.
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association differs from the Academy
Awards in that it honours television as well as films, and nominates
films in both drama and musical or comedy categories.
Claire Danes won for best actress in a television drama series for her
role in My So-Called Life, while Dennis Franz won for best actor in the
same category for his portrayal as the cynical detective in NYPD Blue.
The best television series drama award went to The X- Files, seen on
the Fox television network.
Jamie Lee Curtis came to the stage of the International Ballroom at
the Beverly Hilton Hotel and thanked director James Cameron ''for
letting me hang from a helicopter on my 35th birthday.''
Forrest Gump was voted the best film and its star, Tom Hanks, who
played the simpleton who comes in contact with history, was voted best
actor.
Hanks won a Globe last year as an Aids-afflicted lawyer in
Philadelphia and went on to win an Oscar.
Jessica Lange was named best actress for her role as the military wife
in the film Blue Sky.--AP/Reuter.

STOP the nonsense now. Just tell Rangers they can keep the premier
division championship trophy.
But let's hold the ball for a minute. Someone has to take stock of
what exactly is going on in our game. Frankly, it has become so
one-sided it is embarrassing.
Nothing, absolutely nothing, any other team can come up with will
prevent Rangers from winning their seventh successive title, so perhaps
it is time to call a halt and take stock. There has to be an analysis of
what is going on before we find there is no way back towards a truly
competitive league.
It is all very well to talk about cycles, peaks and troughs, or that
the good times will come around for others, they always do. Heard it all
before.
The fact is, we are living in an altogether different time in which
the strong get more powerful and the rich grow wealthier. Rangers are
proving that even when they are at their weakest they remain too potent
for their rivals, as Hearts will testify.
The Tynecastle side walked into a match at Ibrox having taken 11
points from their previous four games, and even though Rangers scored a
minute after the kick-off, when Brian Laudrup's artistry again created a
chance, this time taken in some style by Charlie Miller, it quickly
became obvious Walter Smith's team were badly off form.
They had no recognised strikers because of injury, they couldn't pass,
especially out of an erratic defence, and quite a few of the players
were unable to make tackles.
In fact, here was a team which was doing just about everything wrong.
So what happens? Do Hearts recover their composure and take advantage
of Rangers' inadequacies? No. Instead, they lose and Rangers, despite
themselves, edge closer to the title.
Occasionally a team will be able to win even when playing badly, but
the really scary aspect of what is happening in the premier division is
that Rangers have not had to perform at their best consistently to amass
points. Neither have they been made to suffer because of the horrendous
injury list which has prevented Smith from fielding the same team more
than twice in succession.
The rigours of life in the top division also have taken a toll on
others, but they have not had to do without as many of their key players
as Rangers. Yet the Ibrox side are 14 points in front and going away.
Yes, it seems to me all of us, including Smith, should be concerned.
How can he expect to shape a team capable of making an impact in the
Champions' League if his players can get away with so many sub-standard
performances? How can our game in general have any credibility when only
one team appears capable of winning the title?
People say it will end when the great imaginary pendulum, which is
supposed to regulate such matters, swings in favour of some other club
at some pre-ordained point in time.
Call me a cynic -- and why not. If Hearts chairman Chris Robinson, who
didn't much care for my suggestion before Saturday's match that he was
just a tad naive, can call me a cynic, then you can, too -- but I've
never been willing to sit in the school which teaches about natural
cycles in our sporting environments. Me? I think it usually comes down
to skill and tactics.
If you have more skilled players with greater determination than the
rest, chances are you will win the title, and that's why Rangers are
dominating. Even those players who are considered surplus to Ibrox
requirements can get a game with Rangers' rivals.
Now, the really worrying part is that if Rangers continue to spend
large amounts -- Walter Smith could have as much as #7m to spend on
players this summer -- they will retain their place at the front. The
only way Celtic can overtake them is if Tommy Burns is allowed to shop
in the same market as Smith, but even then Celtic will have to hope
their manager is a more astute buyer.
Celtic have a duty to themselves and the game in general to challenge
Rangers' supremacy, because other clubs who regard themselves as
big-time in our own small world simply do not have the resources to
mount an assault.
Fortunately, Rangers are not so strong at the moment that they will
never be overtaken, but if they are not reined in soon the day could
come when they will be untouchable within their own domain.
Tommy McLean said the second half of Saturday's match was a bore, but
a greater monotony might still be building up. Rangers' supporters might
enjoy winning the title all the time, but no-one else will, and the game
will suffer.

THE sight of Aberdeen manager Willie Miller with his head in his hands
is not new, indeed every sports photographer will have a print of that
portrait in his portfolio.
In the first half of the season, the source of the pose was the
inability of his team to win consistently, resulting in several
forecasts that the dole queue was beckoning.
On Saturday, all the old exasperation was there during the 4-2 defeat
by Hibernian at Easter Road which enabled the Edinburgh team to pull
clear of the pack into second place behind Rangers.
But the reasons for Miller's frustration were different. In earlier
months he would be able to accept that the standard of Aberdeen's
performances invariably did not deserve anything by way of reward. At
Easter Road he watched his players produce the flair, pace and physical
qualities that we have always associated with Aberdeen, yet they still
suffered defeat.
Early carelessness saw Pat McGinlay and Darren Jackson drive Hibs into
a two-goal lead inside 11 minutes. But unlike previous days, when
Aberdeen's resilience was brittle, Billy Dodds pulled them back into the
match from the penalty spot before a similar award offered Jackson his
second goal.
Even at 3-1 down the Dons did not look out of it until, after 63
minutes, Theo Snelders allowed a Keith Wright shot to squirm from his
grasp and through his legs.
Dodds scored again with 12 minutes left, but like the late finisher
who gives the pacemaker too much of a lead, there was too much ground to
make up.
However, Miller will have the consolation of knowing if his players
continue to reach this level of performance, a place in the top half of
the table awaits.
Michael O'Neill, along with Hibs skipper Gordon Hunter, was out
through injury, and such has been the Irishman's presence this season,
two-goal Jackson believes it was crucial to deliver the goods without
him.
''We had to show that we're not a one-man team. Michael has had a
magnificent season and in my view he has proved to be the bargain of the
decade,'' said Jackson, who also thinks Dons are back on track.
''If Willie Miller's team continue to reach that level of performance,
then there is no doubt they will climb the table very swiftly.''
Miller was a bewildered man after the match. ''How do you sum up a
game like that?'' he said. However, he did manage to do so very
concisely. ''I thought we played some great stuff, but lost
concentration at vital moments.''

Kobe, Monday
THE death toll from Japan's worst earthquake in more than 70 years
climbed towards 5000 early today as rescuers braved aftershocks and
freezing temperatures to haul more bodies from heaps of rubble and ash.
Rescue teams using heat-sensitive cameras and sniffer dogs searched
desperately for more than 160 people still missing. The city was hit by
freezing temperatures and rain that threatened to topple damaged
buildings and trigger landslides.
Rescuers pulled two elderly survivors from the rubble 128 hours after
the earthquake tore the city to pieces on Tuesday.
Authorities fear the weather could help trigger off an influenza
epidemic.
Six days after the disaster, the casualty toll was 4984 dead and
25,964 injured.
Kobe has been hit by some 1000 aftershocks since last Tuesday's quake.
A fresh shock measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale hit the area early
today, but there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.
The government's Earthquake Prediction Council has said a big
aftershock on the scale of a six on the Richter scale could soon hit the
devastated area.
Most of the 300,000 people made homeless by the disaster scrambled to
gather more blankets, fresh clothing and food on today. Stores slowly
started to reopen and relief supplies continued to arrive.
Water and food arrived in hundreds of truck convoys and authorities
said electricity had been restored to one million residents.--Reuter.

Tunis, Sunday
ISLAMIC fundamentalists shot dead a French trader in Algiers today,
taking their conflict back to the city centre in the first killing of a
foreigner since Algerian authorities rejected a conditional peace offer.
The official Algerian news agency APS identified the dead man as
Joseph Belaiche, 55, and said an unidentified young woman was seriously
wounded in the attack.
The gunmen struck in the early afternoon, opening fire on their target
in the normally-crowded Port Said Square, a tree-lined rendezvous
popular with the unemployed and illegal migrants, just off the
Mediterranean seafront.
At Tidjelabine, 23 miles away, three customs employees were killed by
Muslim guerrillas as they set out to work at the coastal city of
Boumerdes, APS also reported.
Belaiche, whose killing brought a renewed plea from France for its
nationals to leave the North African country, joined a toll of about 80
foreigners slain since September 1993.
He was the first foreigner to be shot dead since a letter, written in
German and sent to Western embassies in Bern, urging them to close their
embassies in Algeria and cut links with the country or their nationals
would face killing in ''cold blood''.
Embassies in Algiers had ignored the ultimatum and Algerian
authorities pledged once again to protect foreigners.
The Algerian government condemned Belaiche's killing as a ''cowardly
assassination'' and vowed ''to hunt down without respite the masterminds
and those who carry out crimes perpetrated against foreigners, citizens
and state institutions''.
Many of the killings of foreigners have been claimed by the Armed
Islamic Group (GIA), the most ruthless of those fighting to install a
purist Islamist state.
Today, its chief Abou Abderrahmane Amine was quoted in the Algerian
newspaper al-Khabar as saying in a clandestine instruction: ''The GIA
forbids France to enter the frontiers of Islamic Algeria.
''The GIA bans French planes, boats and all other means of transport
from entering Algerian territory.''--Reuter.

HE walked through Rugby Park's inner sanctum slowly, appearing to
choose his steps carefully, like a man with problems. Yes, these are
indeed troubled times for Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies.
In recent weeks the big fellow's team has clattered down the premier
ladder quite alarmingly and, following Kilmarnock's 2-1 success on
Saturday, Falkirk now find themselves uncomfortably close to the drop
zone.
Jefferies chatted to his employees for 45 minutes after the ball had
come to rest -- the kind of conversation, perhaps, where the wallpaper
in the dressing curls at the edges from the heat generated therein --
but the man later appeared calm, convinced that he was aware of his
side's ailments but that he had a prescription.
For the sake of all who pledge allegiance to Brockville, the number
one item should read striker. Because since Richard Cadette threw his
boots over a shoulder and headed back down to the big smoke, Falkirk
have struggled, but this is not lost on Jefferies.
''The difference in this league is that when you get chances you have
to stick them away,'' said Jefferies. ''That is why we have been working
non-stop trying to rectify the problem, not just with a striker but in
other areas of the team.''
On the weekend showing, what Falkirk have up front is not of
sufficient quality to aid them in their plight, and with his club far
from awash with the folding stuff, Jefferies must choose wisely. There
may be no second chance.
Talks will soon continue with Aberdeen's David Winnie, the player's
demands differing from what Falkirk had in mind, but it is the striking
position that appears the most depressing.
But enough of doom and gloom, for Kilmarnock look to have unearthed a
gem in 17-year-old defender Jim Lauchlan who, in his first outing with
the big boys, handled what Falkirk could muster like an old hand.
And his tackling of playerspeak was just as impressive. ''Over the
moon to be in the first team. Happy to take one game at a time.'' Yes,
this lad should do well.
With Saturday's cup-tie against Morton to be discussed and after his
men had earned six league points inside a week, Kilmarnock manager Alex
Totten has decided to pack his lot off for a few days' winter break. Not
the sun of Spain, but the delights of Durham. Sounds more like a
punishment exercise, but Alex knows best.
He was full of praise for his men and rightly brought Colin McKee in
for special mention. ''A goal worthy of winning any match,'' said the
manager.
Indeed it was, as the young man appeared to measure the angle in his
mind before chipping the ball past Tony Parks to add to a Tom Black
special, Falkirk having taken the lead from the penalty spot through
John Clark.
The Scottish Cup now takes centre stage and Motherwell, newly stuffed
by Dundee United and with pride in tatters, will no doubt come out
battling against Falkirk at Brockville, just what the club needs right
now. It never rains but it pours Jim, does it?

Many tributes will be paid to the late Sir Alexander Gibson by
colleagues and friends, musicians, and critics. We are none of those,
just simple music lovers who were stunned to hear of his death.
We are old enough to remember the meagre fare of Scottish music lovers
before his arrival at the SNO compared with the riches available to us
today, and if any one man deserved thanks for this it was Alex Gibson.
His untimely death comes like a personal loss to us who were never
nearer to him than in the SNO or Scottish Opera audience.
Of him it can truly be said: ''We will not see his like again in our

MAYBE if they had nailed him to a post, Celtic might have found a way
of getting the ball past Nicky Walker in the Partick Thistle goal, but
it would not have been odds-on. The much travelled goalie has never had
a better game than his inspirational show in the no-scoring draw at
Firhill but, as he pointed out, he has paid his dues.
''After 15 years in the premier division, I was due a daft day. Every
keeper gets one.'' His was magnificently daft. There was nothing much
more Celtic could have done to score. They had a whole array of shots
and headers on target, but were defied by the feet or hands of Walker.
His opposite number, Pat Bonner, nodded his head in that fashion which
indicates that only keepers really understand these things. ''That is
the way it happens sometimes and the next week you can go out and lose a
soft one,'' he said with the wisdom of 16 years in the game.
Of course there were Celtic fans arguing that the team blew it, that
no side should miss so many golden opportunities. And, to some extent
that has a validity, but there are occasions when a goalkeeper in
brilliant form is admired and supported by the guardian angel of all
goalies. Luck was handed out along with the plaudits in large dollops.
But Bonner could well be right when he says that Celtic, in this form,
will give some side a hard time of it one day. Unquestionably, the
Parkhead lot were as good as they have been any time since Tommy Burns
took over. They conquered difficult conditions with some fine passing
movements and, despite Thistle's courageous and willing defensive stand,
looked certain to win by a few goals. That would not have been an unfair
reflection.
Even Thistle's assistant manager, Gerry Collins, had to describe his
team's show thus: ''We stole a point.'' Stuart Gray and Brian O'Neil
were outstanding players for Celtic, but Peter Grant, Phil O'Donnell and
Willie Falconer were not far behind. Yet all their smart play did not
persuade the Jags to throw in the towel.
They are stubborn at Firhill and, even while they were losing the
battle, they never hinted the war was over.
Steve Welsh rallied his men time and again as Celtic threatened to run
them into Maryhill Road, and they had the audacity to come close to
snatching a goal themselves in a couple of breakaway thrusts. But,
overall, they will still wonder how they emerged unscathed with another
point added to their total.
It would be pointless listing every wonderful save or stop made by
Walker, but some were extra special, like one from O'Donnell in the
early part of the game, another before half time from Falconer, a fine
stop from O'Donnell again after the break, and the piece de resistance
near the end, when he halted a Hooydonk header at the far post.
Burns was philosophical afterwards, acknowledging that the keeper was
simply unbeatable. He was genuinely pleased, however, with the display
of his team and, compared with many efforts this season, he had every
justification.
He was a bit miffed by loud criticism of his side by two female Celtic
fans who gave him a hard time from the enclosure. The manager has
offered to buy them lunch and continue the debate with them, should they
make themselves known to him.
It is perhaps not an innovation he should pursue long. On all known
recent form, there are queues of Parkhead critics ready to offer their
views. If he is not careful Tommy might need to use a large slice of his
transfer bankroll to feed the multitude.

JIGS and reels by the dozen; a hornpipe; one waltz. There was little
doubt about the toe-tapping prime function of Sharon Shannon's accordion
on Friday night: dance. It called for responses inappropriate to its
all-seater location, ie dizzy whirlings and shrieks of ''Heee-yuuccch''.
A Barrowland booking for the Shannon quartet next time, please.
What would be the most fitting venue for Luka Bloom? A cathedral. A
city street. A seashore. A mountain top. Your bedroom. Any place one can
undergo a spot of revelatory religious ecstasy, in fact. Yup, Luka Bloom
is a wholly holy experience, a floppy-fringed charismatic who
effortlessly filled the concert hall's vastness with his voice and
guitar.
I must admit that Luka Bloom established his credentials with me at
the start by breathlessly recalling a Blue Nile show he'd seen in his
native Dublin. Thankfully, everything he did thereafter matched the
affirmatory, heart-breaking gorgeousness of our own Messrs Bell,
Buchanan and Moore.
Additionally, he did an astonishingly simple version of R.E.M's
Everybody Hurts that out-hurted Michael Stipe's for emotional
sensitivity, and uncovered the hitherto-hidden balladic worth of LL Cool
J's macho rap strutter, I Need Love. And his own songs were tautly
poetic, completely gripping, and simultaneously mournful and
celebratory.
Just as crucially, in between these songs Luka Bloom blarneyed
self-deprecatingly, made daft jokes, and was the starriest cutie that a
Glasgow audience has fallen in love with for years. On Friday night we
clapped; we roared; we sobbed empathic sobs. We went out the next day
and tried to buy Luka's current album, Turf, and found everyone else had
beaten us to it. Luka Bloom said he's coming back to us in summer. It
won't be a second too soon.

<RECORDNO>980222141</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE battle over Clause 4 of the Labour Party's constitution is hotting
up. Mr Blair is maintaining a tough stance, and insists on getting his
way. The clause has historically committed the Labour Party to public
ownership on a huge scale. It was never fully implemented: the first two
Labour Governments, in 1924 and 1929, had no parliamentary majority to
do so; the Attlee Government of 1945 ran out of time after nationalising
coal, the railways, and a string of utilities. Its only conventional
industry was steel, though many more targets were specified in the 1951
manifesto. The Wilson administrations of the 1960s and seventies were
not keen on nationalisation, except steel, which had become a totem, the
Tories having denationalised it. Between 1951 and 1964, therefore, the
Labour leadership had come to suspect that public ownership was an
electoral liability. That was certainly true of Hugh Gaitskell, who
tried to ditch it but was forced to keep it in being, with an additional
gloss, now forgotten. Mr Gaitskell's successors, even the late John
Smith, thought it better to let sleeping dogs lie. Mr Blair has taken up
where Mr Gaitskell left off, and now has a fight on his hands.
It hardly matters now if Mr Blair was right, for he has to get an
outcome which does not reduce his authority both within his party and
with the voters; but there is a strong case for him. The history of the
nationalised industries was not such as to enthuse anyone to argue for
the extension of the principle. The economic performance of the same
businesses when privatised has been superior, if blurred by the
disgraceful behaviour of many of their top people in awarding themselves
unjustified salaries. Labour does have to remain ready to regulate
businesses -- and especially utilities -- in the public interest but it
is now abundantly clear that it does not require ownership to achieve
that, only a majority in Parliament. If this last is not available, the
rest of the discussion is academic.
There are two related questions. Is Clause 4 an electoral liability,
and does it contain the essence of Labour's philosophy? Most Labour MPs,
the people who actually have to win the vote, feel it is a handicap. Mr
Blair believes that it certainly leads to Labour's more general
philosophy being distorted, so that the only beneficiaries of its
survival unreformed are the party's opponents. That alone ought to
trigger reconsideration in a political party, but the general
prescription has anyhow been too narrowly identified with the large
public corporation, often monopolistic and seldom responsive to the
wishes of its users. A flexible stance -- keeping the railways in public
ownership because their essential public service will be reduced
otherwise -- is what is needed. Clause 4 needs reconstruction. It is
more than 70 years old, and its romantic rhetoric hardly seems relevant
to the needs of the millennium. It evokes powerful emotions all the
same; but its role and significance now have to been redefined.

THE Rankin Family have come a long way in a short time, from playing
to the invited few at their first Glasgow performance just over three
years ago to Saturday's standing room only sell-out. Their appeal
couldn't be less trendy. This is old fashioned family entertainment --
given by a family for families, some of them apparently there in their
entirety.
Their show is essentially what you might find in a Cape Breton village
hall on a Saturday night. There's Gaelic songs of unrequited love and
carefree street songs as well as nods to the Chieftains and Christy
Moore from the three sisters; the countryish 40 Days (and, less
typically, a bluesy Tailor's Daughter) from brother Jimmy; and some
great fiddle tunes from elder brother John Morris and Howard MacDonald.
They're homely and fun, and although too much of the sisters' goody
two shoes sweetness might well rot your teeth, they're introducing a lot
of (very) young people to traditional music, so more power to their
elbows.
Rock Salt &amp; Nails's Shetland rockabilly is passionate, energetic and
raw, yet there's skill in the frontline fiddle partnership of Magnus
Johnston and Jenny Gardner. In addition to some nifty flat picking on
acoustic guitar, Paul Johnston presides over events as a sort of cheery
aggressor, exhorting the audience not to indulge in any ''posh concert
shite''.
However, it took the reappearance of Appalachia's fabulous Footworks
troupe, dancing a traditional Shetland ice-breaker, to really get the
party going -- and from there onwards all resistance to the rhythms of
Papa Stour, you might say, bit the dust.

AMONG the entertaining classes, the hostesses with the widest smirks
are said to be those whose dinner parties come shortly after the latest
book from Delia Smith. Not only do her recipes always work, but among a
close circle of friends even the dishiest of new recipes does not merit
a second helping. Just as Scottish doctors could once predict an
epidemic of any ailment mentioned by the Sunday Post's family doctor,
supermarket managers now have to stock up on the ingredients mentioned
in Mrs Smith's television programmes. She once called for liquid glucose
in a truffle torte recipe, and in two weeks it cleared out the country's
entire supplies.
Elizabeth David is deservedly given the credit for encouraging
post-war Britain to eat Mediterranean food, but it is Delia Smith who
can take the credit for treating British food with foreign zest. It is
she who is responsible for the current outbreak of limes, for instance,
and the ubiquitous use of coriander leaves. According to the writer Joe
Saumarez Smith, our food tastes are not only changed by such influential
television chefs, but the dictates of fashion. On the way out, he
predicts, are 1994's tapenades, polenta, and risotto, while this year is
expected to favour cooking with cardoons, banana leaves, and okra. Such
exotic ingredients are no longer rare, of course. One food expert has
complained that it now easier to buy lemon grass and yams than it is to
find fresh chicken livers.
If fashion ultimately turns full circle, British dishes could once
more be enjoyed in their traditional form, served not with sauces but
old-fashioned gravy. The virtues of native food have always been there,
as has our inherited liking for it. It is a strange traveller who does
not come back yearning for a proper pot of tea followed by a simple
plate of mince and potatoes. The trend could already have started. Every
1995 trend-setter, says Mr Smith, will be putting pearl barley into
their soups and stews. In the old days, as we recall, there used to be
something like that called Scotch broth.

MORTEN Wieghorst wants Dundee to gain promotion for more than just the
usual reasons. The 23-year-old Dane's international career is taking
off, and premier division football next season would give him a much
better chance of being in the spotlight to enhance the three caps he has
already won.
On and off the field, Wieghorst seems to be entirely laid back. But
there is a spark of ambition there that even he cannot hide. For
example, last week he was soaking up the sun in Saudi Arabia with the
European champions. The opposition was Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and then
Argentina in the final of the Tournament of Champions -- which the Danes
won, with Wieghorst playing for 75 minutes having come on as substitute.
He also had come on as a sub against the Saudis, and scored his second
goal for his country.
Picture Saturday at Clydebank. The bread and butter being earned in
wind and sleet, a sodden pitch that made good football almost
impossible, and even gloves being worn for the second half because of
the bitter cold. From sun and thousands of square miles of sand to a
postage-stamp corner of wintry Scotland within a week.
With a wry smile, Wieghorst said afterwards: ''I had to prepare myself
mentally for the change all week. It's quite a drop -- no disrespect to
Clydebank -- and really there is no comparison, and let's face it, the
weather here does not tempt you to play nice football.'' Amen to that.
It doesn't tempt you to report nice things about it either.
Suffice to say that leaders Dundee were back at their belligerent best
after last week's reverse against Airdrie. One of the finest own goals
you are ever likely to see -- a diving header from Steve Jack after only
90 seconds -- set up the Dens men, and strikes by Neil Duffy and Jim
Hamilton to make it 3-0 was a fair reflection of the difference between
the sides.
Another foreigner made the headlines at East End Park when Dunfermline
fielded #120,000 signing Guido van de Kamp, the Dutch keeper who had
been in conflict with Dundee United for all of this season.
But manager Bert Paton, who picked him up at Glasgow Airport on
Saturday morning to seal the deal, said yesterday: ''He has kept himself
in good shape, and played well on his debut.''
Hamilton were the opposition, and they went down 2-1 in a match the
Fifers deserved to win, with goals from Andy Tod and Stewart Petrie.
Conditions were so bad Tod and Jackie McNamara required treatment at
half-time for the effects of hypothermia.
St Johnstone continue to threaten, and their 5-1 thrashing of St
Mirren should serve as a warning that the Perth side have not given up
hopes of premier division football. At the other end of the table,
though, St Mirren now continue to be in deep trouble in the relegation
zone along with Stranraer, Ayr United, and Clydebank.
Bankies' coach Brian Wright summed up that situation: ''It will all
come down to the last quarter of the season when the bottom teams play
each other.''
Two own goals by Jim Dick and Norrie McWhirter certainly added to
Saints' misery, with manager Jimmy Bone again coming under pressure from
the Paisley fans during the game.

Washington, Sunday
THE US Navy has reassigned the first woman to qualify as a combat
pilot on an aircraft carrier because of her difficulties in landing on
the ship, Navy officials said today.
Lieutenant Shannon Workman, 28, of Cumberland, Maryland, has returned
to the United States after having been ordered off the USS Eisenhower in
the Mediterranean for performance problems, a spokesman for the Atlantic
Fleet's Naval Air Forces said.
For the same reason, the Navy also ordered off the Eisenhower
Lieutenant Commander Gerald DiLeonardo, a male pilot in Workman's EA-6B
squadron. The EA-6B is a twin-engine jet packed with electronic warfare
gear.
The Navy said its standards were the same for its male and female
flyers. Every landing on a carrier is graded because of the high level
of expertise that is required, officials said.
Ten female aviators remain on the Eisenhower, six of them pilots,
performing well, the spokesman, Cammander Kevin Wensing, said from the
Norfolk, Virginia, Atlantic Fleet headquarters.--Reuter.

Warsaw, Sunday
MEMBERS of Poland's fringe Bald People's Party launched a hunger
strike at the weekend to demand representation in the country's top
echelons of power, PAP news agency said.
''The protesters want the new constitution to guarantee bald people
top state posts,'' the agency quoted Witold Slusarski, a spokesman for
the tongue-in-cheek protest, as saying.
''This includes naming people who once had hair to head the key
foreign, defence and interior ministries.''
The right to make appointments to the three posts is currently being
disputed by President Lech Walesa and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak,
both of whom have their hair.
The hunger strike in the southern city of Krakow would continue daily
from 7am to 3pm with a lunch break in between, Slusarski added.--Reuter.

IT used to be sufficient for an International Monetary Fund executive
to be an economist of proven expertise. Additional qualities required
now are an ability to tiptoe through political minefields and a mental
subtlety worthy of a Machiavelli. Whether the IMF team in Moscow at the
moment has these attributes is of particular significance. Within the
next few days it must decide whether to disburse $6250m for the Russian
economic stabilisation programme. Disbursing the money would be of the
utmost importance for the Russian economy but its symbolic importance
could be even greater. The IMF has had a lengthy and difficult series of
negotiations with the Russians which have been overshadowed by confusion
and upheaval in Russian politics. The political and economic elements
are tightly interwoven and, in a way they have not encountered before,
IMF officials have found themselves assessing political implications as
much as economic criteria.
Events are complicated by the fact that this will be the first
large-scale package of aid assembled by the IMF for Russia. The IMF view
on the Russian situation has come a long way from its initial
assessment, which was to view the country as a lost cause economically.
For much of last year the IMF viewpoint shifted slowly towards
acceptance of Russian protestations on reform, though these were not
always validated by what was happening on the ground. Responding to a
variety of pressures President Yeltsin has lost all but one recognised
reformer from his Government, but one of his silliest appointments was
that of the unknown geologist, Vladimir Polevanov, as head of the State
Property Committee. This made Mr Polevanov responsible for the
privatisation programme which is generally accepted as one of the few
reasonably successful elements in Russia's drive for reform. The snag
was that Mr Polevanov is clearly not in favour of privatisation. Indeed,
he caused a serious row last month by suggesting that those parts of the
oil and aluminium sectors which had already been privatised could be
moved back into state hands.
Mr Polevanov has to go; indeed hints emerging from Moscow over the
weekend suggest that he might already have been removed. If this is true
it will make the work of the IMF delegation a little easier, but it must
still grapple with the decision of parliamentary deputies on Friday to
withhold approval of Russia's 1995 budget. In some ways this is more of
a nuisance than a crisis. Amendments to the budget have been proposed by
the deputies but they mean that the proposed budget deficit will
probably end up at a more realistic figure than that claimed by the
Government originally. Two things are essential in the next few days.
Confusion over the budget must be removed and the IMF must resolve to
disburse the agreed money. It will be more of a political decision than
an economic one, and Chechnya has not helped, but in the present
circumstances it is only the political approach which can save the cause
of reform in Russia.

Grozny, Sunday
SPORADIC gunfire and the occasional boom of shells echoed through
white fog over Grozny today as a lull in Russia's onslaught on the city
allowed watchful Chechens to venture out in search of food and water.
''It's quiet today. But yesterday they bombed just up the road and two
people were killed,'' a taut-faced elderly woman said as she hunted for
food at a street stall at Chernorechiye, a suburb on the city's
southwestern edge.
Families trudging along the roadside with buckets of water from a
nearby dam paused and turned expressionless faces towards the city
centre with every explosion, then carried on walking towards their
battered homes.
''We've got no bread, no salt, nothing,'' wept one woman searching for
scraps of food. Some people collected snow to boil for water.
Witnesses said some shells hit central areas in the early afternoon
while others slammed into the eastern Khankala suburb, sending clouds of
black smoke billowing into the sky.
Defiant fighters in white overalls insisted they still held key sites,
or positions near key sites, just south of the city centre.
The Chechen capital had been relatively quiet for the two days as
Russian gunners concentrated their fire on the suburbs.
Russia sent troops into Chechnya on December 11 to crush the Caucasus
region's three-year independence bid. Hundreds, if not thousands, of
soldiers and civilians have been killed in six weeks of war between
Russian troops and Chechen separatists.
But Moscow has been unable to seize control of the largely Muslim
region and there has been strong opposition at home and abroad to
President Boris Yeltsin's use of force.
Hundreds of anti-war demonstrators gathered in Moscow today near the
headquarters of the former Soviet KGB security police to mourn the
victims of the war in Chechnya.
Leading liberal politicial Yegor Gaidar and human rights commissioner
Sergei Kovalyov both called for an end to the war. ''I ask you to
remember the dead,'' Kovalyov said.
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel issued a similar appeal after
meeting Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev in Berne. ''The
bloodshed in Chechnya must stop immediately,'' he told reporters.
German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe showed Bonn's disquiet by telling
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev he did not expect him to take up
an invitation to a defence conference in Munich.
German government sources said this was a polite way of telling
Grachev he was not welcome.
A Russian parliamentary official sought to defuse anger in the Muslim
world, saying the conflict with Chechen rebels was a fight against
common criminals, not Islam.
''There is no relation between (Chechen leader) Dzhokhar Dudayev's
gang and Islam,'' the Federation Council's deputy chairman, Ramazan
Abdulatipov, told a news conference in Cairo.
The sound of shelling in the southwest indicated that Russian forces
were pressing south from central strongholds and gradually pushing back
their opponents.
Correspondents said Russia's aim was apparently to cut off the roads
out of Grozny and crush resistance by stopping Chechen fighter groups,
who have no radio links, communicating with each other.--Reuter.

NOT even the goodwill of 14 other clubs was enough to help Fraserburgh
open up the Highland League championship on Saturday. The Buchan club
have a reasonable recent record against Huntly, but those hoping they
would upset the defending champions were to be sadly disappointed.
Instead the league leaders eased through the potentially hazardous
fixture to collect a 3-0 win and three more points. Still their lead at
the top is merely three points, but of the top half dozen only Huntly
have the look of champions.
Two early strikes by Martin Stewart, and a third direct from a corner
from rejuvenated former Aberdeen winger Steve Gray, completed another
good afternoon.
Second-placed Peterhead maintained their position with a 5-0 canter
against Nairn County, though the visitors had to play 70 minutes with
defender Scott Stevenson in goal after keeper Billy Neilson suffered a
suspected broken finger in a collision with the crossbar.
Wick Academy are waiting to hear from Aberdeen after their striker,
Alan Murray, impressed during a trial for the Dons reserves against Hibs
at Pittodrie.
Murray is due back at work in Caithness today but without him Wick
crashed 4-0 at home to Clach.
Cove Rangers' title push suffered a setback with a 1-1 home draw
against ten-man Buckie. Gordon Robertson put Buckie ahead before skipper
Ian Mathieson was red-carded. Scott Buchan equalised for Cove with 13
minutes left.
Deveronvale hit the surprise result of the day in a 4-2 win at
Lossiemouth with player-manager Kevin Bremner hitting two.
In the one North Cup first round tie that survived the weather, Fort
William thumped Ross County reserves 4-0 with Ian Polworth scoring
twice.

<HEADLINE>'No sensible reason' why they should not return to the fold, says conciliatory Chancellor Clarke offers olive branch to Euro-rebels</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, yesterday offered an olive branch
to the Tory Euro-rebels, saying there was ''no sensible reason'' why
they should not be returned to the party fold.
Mr Clarke said they had all been elected as Conservatives and the
party should hold together by reflecting the varying shades of opinion
on Europe.
He sought to reassure the nine rebels without the party Whip about his
own views, insisting that they were ''indistinguishable'' from those of
the Prime Minister.
His conciliatory comments, in an interview on BBC1's Breakfast with
Frost programme, are particularly significant coming from a man seen as
one of the strongest pro-European members of the Cabinet.
''I think what has become clear in recent weeks is when you look at
European policy and other policies as well, there is no sensible reason
for our being apart,'' he said.
He accepted that once the rebels were restored to the Whip there would
still be some room for dissent, although generally they should support
the Government in the division lobbies.
''I obviously want these colleagues of mine to come back on board. But
when you come back on board in a political party -- you can have the
occasional rebellion, no man is a completely mechanical supporter of his
party right and wrong on every occasion -- but by and large you are a
member of the Conservative Parliamentary Party in order to support the
Conservative Prime Minister and the Government.''
Mr Clarke stressed that the party had always accommodated a range of
views on Europe.
He dismissed any suggestion that he was at odds with the Prime
Minister, who in recent weeks has adopted a more Euro-sceptic tone in
his public pronouncements.
''I think John's views on Europe are indistinguishable from mine. We
work very closely. I have always felt we have an exactly similar
approach to Europe,'' said Mr Clarke.
His own attitude towards Europe was pragmatic. ''I am not a
Euro-sceptic. I am, I think, a Euro-realist.''
Mr Clarke felt that Britain had to play an assertive role to secure
the kind of community it wanted. He emphasised his own record in
fighting EU legislation which, he said, would have been deterimental to
Britain's interests.
However, unlike many of the rebels, he was distinctly lukewarm over a
referendum on monetary union and a single currency.
He appeared to suggest that, if and when the time came to consider it,
he would prefer the decision to be taken by Parliament.
''A single currency may or may not be an issue by the end of the
century. All I want to see is it kept open. If it looks a good idea to
the British Parliament, fine. If it doesn't look a good idea, we say
no,'' he said.
''I think it is absolutley foolish to decide it one way or the other
now.''
Mr Clarke's overtures to the rebels were echoed from the opposite wing
of the Cabinet by Employment Secretary Michael Portillo.
''These people remain Conservatives, very serious and dedicated
Conservatives, and I think the most natural thing in the world would be
for them to take the Whip again and I hope that will happen before too
long,'' he told Radio 4's The World This Weekend.
He said, by pledging to block any moves towards political union by the
Inter-Governmental Conference in 1996 and ruling out monetary union in
1996 or 1997, Mr Major had laid the groundwork for reconciliation.
The Ministers' comments were coolly received by the Euro-rebels.
Sir Teddy Taylor said that although he was ''heartened'' by the
Government's response, Ministers needed to go further.
He called on the Prime Minister to make a commitment that the
Government would start claiming back some powers from Brussels.
''We feel that what would be a help would be a simple statement of
intent that the Government would seek to repatriate some policies,'' he
said.
''We feel this would be a major step forward for democracy and would
at last give the people of Britain a choice.''
Earlier, on GMTV's Sunday programme, Mr Tony Marlow said there had to
be a ''fundamental change'' in Britain's relationship with Europe.
''What we are seeking to do is set up an agenda for debate, for
discussion, for movement, for direction and with a bit of willpower and
determination, I think the British Government can achieve a lot of what
we are seeking to do,'' he said.
''There is hard, strong, stern work to be done. I believe John Major
can do it but if he doesn't do it, then both he and the Conservative
Party are going to have great problems in the next election.''

Lyon, Sunday
IN Exhibit Hall Two, teams of chefs from 16 nations compete in the
World Pastry Cup while, just a few aisles away, manufacturers hawk
frozen raw bread, instant eclairs and prefabricated croissants.
The French love their bread and swear by old-fashioned methods but,
with the wares on display in the ''industrial baking'' section of Lyon's
seventh annual Food, Hotel and Wine Fair, just about anyone could become
a baker overnight.
Simply pop the pre-formed frozen loaves into the oven furnished by
your supplier, who also provided your bakery and national advertising.
France is a country where food is an obsession, some pastry chefs are
as famous as rock stars, and the central city of Lyon is France's
gastronomic capital.
Yet the organisers of this food extravaganza apparently saw no irony
in staging the pastry competition -- which kicked off before dawn today
and ends on tomorrow -- a short stroll away from the industrial baking
displays.
The fair's official theme is ''Progress within a tradition''.
Bernard Moine, president of the Lyon region's Association of
Traditional Bakers, sees a mainstay of the French style of life in
danger of slipping into the past.
''One cannot simply cast aside the work begun by our fathers and
grandfathers,'' Moine said. ''We have to maintain the profession -- help
it evolve while preserving it,'' he said.
Rising labour costs, the relentless advance of industrialisation,
increasing global competition and changes in taste and shopping habits
have all put pressure on the old-fashioned ways of making and marketing
bread and pastry.
According to industry figures, 17% of the bread now eaten in France is
made in an industrial setting, and that number is increasing steadily
every year.
Even much of the bread still made in the omnipresent neighbourhood
bakery is today anything but old-fashioned.
Banette, for example, a firm that supplies flour to about 10% of
France's approximately 30,000 bakeries, has expanded into a sort of
national bakery network.
A third of its clients rely on it for their bread recipes, their ovens
and counters, their national marketing and advertising campaigns, and
even their bakeries.--Reuter.

IF there is one thing about Dundee United in their crisis-torn season,
it's that Ivan Golac's side cannot be accused of having done things by
half.
The silverware and the glory attached to last year's Scottish Cup
triumph have long since dulled in a series of major disappointments both
on and off the field.
While manager Golac's role in charge of team matters was being placed
in question by the supporters, the board, and above all the media, the
players were forced to stand up and be counted.
Such was the case after league defeat number nine of the season at
Tynecastle nine days ago. Golac gave up on finding excuses for his
players.
Their day off a week was cancelled, and all of them were dispatched
home with the instruction: ''Have a good look at yourselves.''
The answers were forthcoming during 90 minutes on Saturday when
professionalism was restored as a major part of the ranks.
The outcome was a 6-1 thrashing of one-time title challengers
Motherwell, United's biggest premier success since Paul Sturrock's
five-goal haul helped them to a 7-0 victory over Morton in November,
1984.
However, Saturday's win did nothing other than to point the Taysiders
in the right direction, a fact not lost on Golac, who promptly ordered
his troops in for a spell of overtime yesterday in preparation for
tomorrow night's trip to face Partick Thistle at Firhill.
Remarkably, it was unsettled pair Jim McInally and Billy McKinlay who
led the others by example in performances which belied their
determination to depart the Tannadice scene. As far as McInally was
concerned, one could almost sense Alex McLeish's disappointment at
having failed to land him in an early season bid.
And in Scotland man McKinlay, the home men had the perfect combination
of creator and finisher with a first-half double.
Earlier, ex-United man Tommy Coyne had scored, but after McKinlay's
contributions, United never looked back. Craig Brewster ended a personal
goal famine stretching back to November, and Christian Dailly nodded in
his fourth of the season.
But in between came one of the afternoon's highlights, a substitute's
appearance of outstanding entertainment value from United's West Indian
Jerren Nixon. He netted twice in as many minutes and generally had the
fans on their feet every time he was on the ball.
In fact the home support had risen to their feet, not so much to
welcome Nixon after 62 minutes, but to applaud new Brazilian capture,
Sergio, as he made his way to the dressing room after having been
replaced.

Washington, Sunday
SENATOR Bob Dole confirmed today what everyone has known for years: he
will run for the Republican nomination for the presidency.
A day earlier, Dan Quayle, former vice-president, announced that he
too expected to run.
These were formalities, but important ones. None of the candidates has
yet mounted the elaborate ceremony of a public announcement: Dole will
do so in late March or April. Last time he ran, in 1988, he made the
announcement in his home town, Russell, Kansas.
Quayle will do the same, possibly in Indianapolis, and Senator Phil
Gramm of Texas and Lamar Alexander, former governor of Tennessee, have
both also said that they are running but will not make the official
declaration until later.
Dole was appearing on one of the weekend talk shows. He was asked when
he would declare, and instead of coy evasion, he replied forthrightly:
''In April, or perhaps late March.''
''That means you're running?'' he was asked. ''Sure, last time I
looked,'' he replied.
This rather takes the suspense out of the event, just as some young
couples decide in advance that they will get engaged on a particular,
future, date.
But in politics today announcements are occasions to raise money. The
first batch of presidential primaries next year all come close together,
and each candidate will need about $20m to make a showing in all of
them.
The four Republicans already declared, though not announced, have all
already raised considerable sums.
Anyone starting from scratch now would have to raise $50,000 or more a
day, which is a prospect that has already deterred several potential
candidates.
One or two more are still hovering in the wings, including former
secretary of state James Baker.
Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, President Clinton appears unworried
about the danger of someone challenging him for the nomination.
He is spending his time trying to rally the troops after the lost
battle last November. He made a speech to the party faithful here on
Friday, exhorting them to steadiness under fire.
It was not very inspiring. On Tuesday, he will make his annual State
of the Union speech to Congress, a body now controlled by the
Republicans.

IT was The Day That The Rain Came Down and it seemed to catch English
football on the hop. Downpours all over the country on Saturday morning
brought a rush of pitch inspections and some embarrassingly late
call-offs, leaving angry supporters stranded as only 16 of 43 scheduled
matches took place.
Now the authorities are being urged to introduce an 11am deadline for
final decisions to be made.
That may prove to be impractical, for at many venues it was renewed
rain within the last couple of hours before kick-off that led to
postponements. In other cases, pitches that looked unplayable at 1pm
improved dramatically once a drying wind replaced the rain, and men with
forks got to work.
Such was the case at Coventry, where the sunshine which suddenly
appeared at 2pm, together with a subsequent 1-0 victory, brought a shaft
of light into a somewhat overcast spell for Arsenal and George Graham.
The midweek FA Cup defeat at home to Millwall was deemed reason enough
for serious discussion of whether or not Graham should hold on to his
job.
As his transfer record has been questioned too, there was considerable
satisfaction for him in seeing John Hartson -- his latest signing from
Luton Town -- score the only goal of an rather undistinguished game.
The win pushed Arsenal back into the top half of the table and, by
beating Southampton at home tomorrow, they could rise as high as
seventh, with reasonable prospects of a UEFA Cup place.
More worrying for Graham will have been to pick up yesterday's papers
and see further revelations concerning the transfer of full back Pal
Lyderson to the club three years ago.
One report alleged that, as in the case of John Jensen's signing, a
six-figure sum was paid to a third party. Lyderson has played only a
handful of matches for the club. Jensen, who recently scored his first
goal in two and a half years, was dropped on Saturday.
Coventry, having somehow survived at the top level for 28 seasons, are
in serious trouble once again. Defeat dropped them into the bottom four,
bringing chants from the crowd for the head of manager Phil Neal.
Luck was against him, not only in the manner of Hartson's delected
goal, but in wins for Everton and Aston Villa, both of whom -- as
Coventry supporters and directors will have noted -- ruthlessly sacked
their manager earlier in the season and have subsequently improved their
position.
Duncan Ferguson scored two of Everton's goals in the 3-1 home win over
Crystal Palace -- and further confirmed his status as a cult hero at
Goodison.
Villa moved to fourteenth, their highest position since early October,
winning 2-1 at Nottingham Forest, with Dean Saunders and John Fashanu
outshooting Stan Collymore.
Ipswich Town, reviving -- though probably too late -- under George
Burley, were denied a third-successive win when his nephew Craig from
Ayrshire scored a late equaliser. At Hillsborough, ex-Ranger Chris Woods
kept Newcastle out in his first game for Sheffield Wednesday in 15
months.

AN EMERGENCY meeting will be held today after a storm caused serious
damage to a harbour improvement scheme.
Residents of Port William, on the Galloway coast, say they are not
surprised at the damage to their waterfront and are angry that
officials, planners, and designers would not listen to local knowledge.
A night of gales and a high tide caused havoc last week as the final
touches were being put to the development by Dumfries and Galloway
Enterprise.
It was the first storm of the winter and caused thousands of pounds
worth of damage to the scheme, part of an overall plan costing more than
#1.5m to regenerate the village.
Now an emergency meeting will be held in the village, involving the
enterprise company, which is carrying out the improvements, and regional
councillors.
Mr Gordon Kevan, a retired builder who has lived in the fishing
village all his life, said yesterday: ''It's like something from a
cartoon and we are waiting to see what they will do next.
''The storm was not the worst we get here and we get bigger tides in
the spring. This was from the south and when we get a south westerly it
will be even worse.''
Villagers were amazed when the contractors laid out the harbour with
paving stones bedded into sand; removed a natural stone banking; and
built a low wall, pavements, and kerbs with drains which are underwater
at high tide.
Now around 3000 paving stones have been been washed out, the harbour
front flooded, and the drains blocked with silt.
Around 30 tons of boulders were washed up on the front at the height
of the storm and water which had formerly drained away naturally from
the front had been trapped.
The enterprise company has taken over the harbour from the former
harbour association and it is now administered by Dumfries and Galloway
Regional Council.
''The locals knew the effects of the tides and backwashes and
expressed their concerns,'' said Mrs Anne Highman, of Port William, who
was secretary of the former association.
A statement from the enterprise company said it was assessing the
extent of the damage and clearing-up work had been going on. Executives
were now trying to establish the remedial work which would be required.

<TEXT>
MIKE Gatting's Ashes tour has been saved by just one delivery.
A lifting ball from Victoria fast bowler Simon Cook sent Alec Stewart
to hospital for the third time this tour -- and put Gatting back in
contention for Thursday's fourth Test.
Stewart's right index finger, broken twice in three months, has
apparently escaped further bone damage. But it is so painful he cannot
possibly face Australia at Adelaide Oval, and the chances of him being
fit for the final Test in Perth, which follows almost immediately, are
only marginally better.
England have ruled out summoning yet another replacement and, with
Neil Fairbrother still struggling to recover from a shoulder injury,
Gatting may be an automatic selection.
The 37-year-old former captain has played in all three Tests so far.
He was a controversial selection ahead of John Crawley in Brisbane, held
his place at Melbourne on the strength of a double-century against
Queensland, and then played in Sydney only because Stewart had broken
his finger for a second time.
But, with five Test innings having produced just 57 runs, Gatting's
run seemed over.
While he watched from the pavilion, Stewart -- playing his first
serious innings for nearly a month -- reached 37. Already that would
have been enough to confirm the vice-captain's form and fitness for
Adelaide, and it did England no favours when Stewart survived a dropped
catch.
If only David Emerson had held a straightforward catch at gulley when
Cook the edge of Stewart's bat. But the chance went down and Cook's next
delivery bounced a little higher, hit Stewart's bottom hand, and put
another entry on England's casualty list. ''It was a costly dropped
catch,'' mused the Surrey batsman.
Stewart could become the fifth member of the squad to have his tour
ended by injury. Martin McCague (shin), White (side), Darren Gough
(foot), and Shaun Udal (side) have all had their Ashes dreams ruined.
England, having built a first-innings lead of 83 despite Stewart's
retirement, were 145 runs behind by the close as their hosts reached 228
for five second time around.
Gatting, not selected for this game, acted as Stewart's fielding
substitute for much of the day. Scoreboard:

NIGEL Walker refuses to concede that holders Wales are out of the
running for the Five Nations' Championship -- despite the 21-9 defeat
against France in Paris. ''I still think we can be a force,'' said
Walker.
Wales must now beat England in Cardiff in a month's time to standany
chance of retaining the title they won last year.
''We will be giving it everything we've got against England,'' added
Walker, who did not have a single opportunity to add to his two
successive tries against the French. ''We have lost one game and you
could say we are up against it, but nobody should write off our chances.
''The difference from last year is that then we had the two easy games
first. This time we have got the two hardest ones first.''
The former Olympic hurdler used his searing pace only in a defensive
capacity. Otherwise, he could only watch in appreciation as tries from
Ntamack and Philippe Saint-Andre sent the French on the way to a tenth
successive home victory over Wales, who had dominated the first 20
minutes.
Wales will have to look for a new prop after Ricky Evans became their
latest casualty of an injury-jinxed year. He suffered a broken ankle
that will almost certainly keep him out of the World Cup.
Cardiff's experienced Mike Griffiths will be expected to replace
Llanelli fireman Evans against the old enemy in four weeks' time.
The boot of Neil Jenkins was Wales' only weapon against the French and
although the outside-half kicked three penalties to take his record
points tally to 329, it was clearly not enough against their stylish
opponents.
France took control with the two tries in the space of eight minutes.
Centre Thierry Lacroix converted the second before landing three
penalties.
French coach Pierre Berbizier has thrown down the Five Nations
gauntlet to England, and promises that France will not abandon their
traditions at Twickenham a week on Saturday for what is expected to be
the championship decider.

LEGENDARY German defender Franz Beckenbauer believes Bayern Munich are
equipped to win the European Champions' Cup -- but lack the ability to
fulfil his notion of how the game should be played.
Surprisingly, the man now taking an increasingly-higher profile at the
club he served as a player with such distinction, cites the example of
the much-maligned Scottish premier division as one his players should
copy to give more excitement and entertainment.
He revealed: ''It is not the beautiful game in Scotland, but the
approach is usually positive and attacking -- whereas I am bored by 90%
of the games I see in the Olympic Stadium.
''Currently, we are playing no-risk football. There are too many
back-passes which take us nowhere. We have a very good team which could
win in Europe again, but this does not mean the supporters enjoy our
style of play.
''On a recent visit to Scotland, I saw there was a willingness to go
forward from both teams. There were enough incidents around goal to
satisfy most fans. My views have been made known to the players in the
strongest-possible manner. My intention is to do everything I can to
make Bayern Munich one of the top clubs in the world again. But we must
win with flair.''
Bayern Munich have acquired the Bulgarian striker Emil Kostadinov on
loan from Deportivo la Coruna of Spain as cover for Jean-Pierre Papin,
suspended for their next three European games.
Former Dundee United defender, Freddie van der Hoorn, now an
influential figure in the emergence of Eendracht Aalst in Belgium, is
another supporter of the Scottish game.
''I wish I had played there earlier and worked under Jim McLean,'' he
revealed. ''I learned more in those few years than in my entire career.
McLean and the coach here, Jan Ceulemans, are the best I have known.''
* AJAX are on a collision course with FIFA. The Dutch champions have
so far refused to release 10 of their players to compete in the Under-19
World Championship which starts in Nigeria on March 11.
Among those required for international duty are their emerging stars
Patrick Kluiverts and Clarence Seedorf.
Coach Louis Van Gaal complained: ''It seems as if we are being
punished for having a youth scheme which is an example to the rest of
the world.
''Have they forgotten that we are involved in the Champions' League at
the same time, or do they just not care?'' Serious doubts about Nigeria
as a suitable venue have already surfaced -- and FIFA has seen it
necessary to issue a warning that stadiums and facilities must meet the
necessary standards not to jeopardise the event.
* ALLEGATIONS that not just disgraced Diego Maradona, but the majority
of Napoli players in the Argentinian's time with the club took cocaine,
have been made by former team member Rosario Viglione to a judicial
inquiry.
On being investigated for fraud, Viglione claimed that drugs parties
were regularly held aboard a luxury yacht. Among those still playing, he
named Massimo Crippa (Parma), Fernando de Napoli (Reggiana), Ciro
Ferrara (Juventus) and Antonio Careca, now in the J League in Japan.
He also alleged that Maradona's personal manager Guilermo Coppola, now
facing a murder charge in Argentina, organised the parties.
* BARCELONA manager Johan Cruyff has extended his contract until 1997
and begun re-building the team by drafting in midfielder Jose Mari
Garcia from Osasuna for #1m.
Cruyff's son-in-law, Jesus-Maria Angoy has also been called up from
their B side and there is speculation that Internazionale's unsettled
striker Dennis Bergkamp has now signed a pre-contract arrangement which
will take him to Spain next season.

MORE than 100 members of the Faculty of Advocates -- almost a third of
the membership -- turned out on Saturday to take part in an open debate
which placed the future of their profession under the microscope.
Before the Edinburgh-based meeting, held in strict privacy, a
spokesman said that the event should not be viewed as a precursor to any
legislation.
Yesterday, he said no statement was available and stressed the
normality of the occasion. He confirmed that in excess of 100 attended
the debate, which is understood to have been ''good natured''.
Lord Justice-General Lord Hope and the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger,
attended and the meeting was billed to all practising members of faculty
as the chance to consider issues, including increasing concern among
advocates about decisions of the Criminal Appeal Court.
Also on the agenda for discussion were alleged individual miscarriages
of justice, development and interpretation of legal principle such as
corroboration and the admissibility of confessions, and rules relating
to admission of additional evidence at the stage of an appeal.
The invitation to members described the debate as representative of an
''important discussion'' when proposals relating to the possible need
for reform of the Criminal Appeal Court would also be debated.

Brussels
THE Cabinet Office should discipline three Scottish Office Ministers
over their handling of planning law affecting the controversial Pilmuir
quarry in Newton Mearns, a Euro-MP has suggested to the Prime Minister.
Mr Hugh McMahon, who represents Strathclyde West, has campaigned
against using the quarry as a waste dump for three years. He claims that
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and Eastwood MP Allan Stewart, who is also a
Scottish Office Minister, ignored his repeated warnings that they were
breaking European Union law at Pilmuir.
He also wants disciplinary action against Lord Fraser, whose
responsibilities include the EU.
Last week, the European Commission announced that the Scottish Office
appeared to be in breach of four EU directives covering environmental
impact assessment, ground water, and toxic and dangerous waste.
Mr McMahon was supported by Mr Ken Collins, chairman of the European
Parliament's influential environment committee, who called for an
immediate halt to work on creating the waste dump.
Mr McMahon said: ''I hope all work on the development of the quarry as
a waste disposal site now ceases while the Government explains itself.''
The commission is expected to begin formal infringement proceedings
against the Scottish Office, which upheld the granting of permission for
the Pilmuir development on appeal. The Brussels body has sent formal
notice of its views to the Government.
Its findings are provisional and open to challenge by Scottish Office
Ministers. Mr Stewart, despite his Government role, opposed the choice
of Pilmuir for the project.
Most of the commission's findings stem from its view that European law
has not been properly transposed into domestic laws governing waste
disposal. In particular, it challenges the extent to which impact
assessments were conducted at Pilmuir.
The commission also claims that there was not a full investigation
into the discharge of certain toxic substances and of waste.
In a letter to the Prime Minister, Mr McMahon said he had raised the
legal base for Scottish Office policy at Pilmuir with Ministers on
several occasions.
''It appears I was too modest in thinking that there was only a
possible breach of one directive -- it appears there was infringement of
three others.''
He told Mr Major: ''As your Ministers chose to ignore my plea and
advice and as the UK Government may end up in the European Court of
Justice for failure to heed my advice, I would like you to carry out an
investigation into the handling of this affair by the Scottish Office
and take the appropriate remedial and disciplinary action.''

Sarajevo, Sunday
AN American envoy said today he hoped Big Power negotiations with
Bosnia's rival factions could clear the way for fresh talks on an end to
the war as a ceasefire slowed fighting across the country.
Charles Thomas, a member of a five-nation ''contact group'' set up
last year to draw up a political settlement in Bosnia, returned to the
region amid signs a three-week-old ceasefire in Bosnia was holding firm.
But the prime minister of Bosnia's Muslim-led government said that new
negotiations were unlikely unless the Serbs reversed their refusal to
accept the contact group peace plan requiring them to cede territory.
A United Nations spokesman in Sarajevo said Bosnia had been quiet
during the past 24 hours apart from a handful of minor truce violations.
Thomas, who held talks with the Muslim-led government yesterday, met
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and other Serb officials in their
headquarters in Pale, near Sarajevo.
''We've just completed a very constructive conversation with Dr
Karadzic and his colleagues,'' Thomas told reporters.
''We are going to continue this dialogue in an intensive way and we
are hopeful that it would lead to resumed negotiations.''
Thomas also confirmed that he will be joined by other envoys of the
group, comprising the United States, Russia, Britain, France and
Germany, in Sarajevo tomorrow.
''We have some hope this may lead to the resumption of the talks,''
Karadzic said after the meeting.
''The essence is to maintain the cessation of hostilities and
therefore we are not going to retaliate or to respond to provocations
(from the Bosnian army),'' he added.
But Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said he doubted that the
Serbs, a well-armed minority which holds 70% of Bosnia, would ever
accept rolling back to the 49% share proposed by the plan.
''The Serbs still think they can get a better deal, and they are
right, because they know very well that behind the contact group
diplomacy there is maybe only goodwill,'' Silajdzic told Reuters.
''The Serbs will back down only from a credible threat of force,'' he
said.
Major powers hope to capitalise on a four-month ceasefire which came
into effect on January 1 following a peace mission by former US
president Jimmy Carter.

Allan Laing considers the hidden role of women screenwriters, a
talented group whose names deserve greater credit
THERE is the classic image of a Hollywood scriptwriter. He is a man,
obviously. He sits at a desk in a seedy downtown apartment, slaving over
a red-hot Underwood, with an unfiltered Camel smouldering between his
lips. Once upon a time he had the burning ambition to write The Play,
but seduced by the bright lights he sold his soul to the studios.
Then again maybe not. Try this Trivial Pursuit: Who wrote the scripts
for The Big Sleep and Rio Bravo, for Foreign Correspondent and
Suspicion, for The Shining, for Play Misty For Me, for Indecent Proposal
and The Getaway, for Prizzi's Honour, and for 9[1/2] Weeks? The answer
should not surprise you but it probably will. All these films were
written by women.
Ever since the first pioneers started making movies in the Hollywood
Hills, there have been women tapping out words for the pictures. But,
traditionally, they've been the unsung heroines of the silver screen.
No-one makes a big deal about scriptwriters -- and they make even less
if the author is female.
Still, for those determined young women who have been keen to play a
role beyond stardom in the industry, screenwriting has always been an
area which was open to them.
In a new and highly readable book, published by the British Film
Institute, journalist Lizzie Francke charts the success (and failure) of
Hollywood's lady writers. Script Girls -- Women Screenwriters in
Hollywood traces their history from the 1911 version of Ben Hur to
Callie Khouri's Thelma and Louise and beyond.
In 1940, according to Ms Francke's research, 15% of all scripts being
written for the Hollywood studios were written by women. In 1987 (the
last time the American Writers' Guild conducted a survey) that figure
had soared to . . . 15.5%. Some things, it seems, never change. So does
this mean that female writers have been discriminated against over the
years?
''It is more implicit than explicit. Throughout the history of the
industry there have been women screenwriters who wanted to become
directors -- but nothing ever came of it. They were written out of the
picture. Between 1930 and 1960 there were only two women -- Dorothy
Arzner and Ida Lupino -- who got the chance to direct in Hollywood,''
explained Francke.
''There is a story about the director Howard Hawks who, having read
and admired the crime novels of Leigh Brackett, decided to hire her. She
was summoned to his office and, when they were introduced, he was
completely surprised to discover that it was a woman -- the name was
ambiguous, of course,'' she added. Brackett went on to make five films
with Hawks and became one of the most successful women writers in
Hollywood, ending her career with The Empire Strikes Back.
Female screenwriters were, to a degree, pigeon-holed into writing what
were perceived to be ''women's pictures.'' However, in truth they
contributed to every genre. Oddly enough, they were particularly strong
in Westerns. Lizzie Francke suggested that this was in part because the
studios' conveyor belt churned out hundreds of cowboy B-movies which
(male) writers despised because they were badly paid and not considered
to be ''real films.''
''Katherine Turney, one of the few women who worked with Warner
Brothers in the 40s, said that she had suffered at the hands of her male
colleagues who continually made disparaging remarks -- like suggesting
that she'd only got a job because she was sleeping with the producer --
and only through her own perseverance did she manage to change that
attitude,'' said Francke.
In the 1980s the notoriously fickle Hollywood studios turned to male
action movies as the Next Big Thing. With only a couple of exceptions,
it was an exclusive boys' club when it came to writing for Arnie and
Sly, for Kevin and Harrison.
''The trouble is that there are many women who would like to write
that kind of film but they are never considered. Take Thelma and Louise,
for instance. Callie Khouri (who wrote the screenplay) tried to sell the
script around Hollywood with no success. It was only when she got it to
Ridley Scott that anything happened. He liked it and it was only because
he was a powerful enough name that it was made,'' added Francke.
Thelma and Louise, when it was released in America in 1991, served to
break the mould. Khouri, who had previously tried and failed to make it
as a screen actress, did not consider it to be a feminist movie. It did,
however, involve interesting female characters who went well beyond the
Hollywood stereotypes of girlfriend/gangster's moll/prostitute/rape
victim.
The glass ceiling in the movie industry is about as low as it gets
but, in the 1990s, there would appear to be at least a glimmer of hope
that women may yet make a major breakthrough in the screenwriting trade.
There is, of course, the shining example of writer-director Norah
Ephron, though her movies (Heartburn, When Harry Met Sally, and
Sleepless In Seattle) clearly fall into that old ''women's picture''
category.
No. According to Francke, the women writers' killing field is the
burgeoning independent market in America.
''The most interesting work is being done outside Hollywood, outside
the studio system. Maggie Greenwald's The Ballad of Little Jo, a
feminist Western, was produced for $4m and made by the independent
company Fine Line. Hollywood remains a very difficult place for women,''
she added.
Another woman who came through the independent system was
writer-director Kathryn Bigelow who took a similarly radical approach to
the Western with Near Dark (1987), a film which mixed the genres of
cowboy and horror in a modern setting. She went on to break through into
the studio system in 1990 with Blue Steel, a gender-reversal thriller
with Jamie Lee Curtis as a rookie cop hunting a killer.
* Lizzie Francke will deliver a lecture on women writers in the screen
trade at the Edinburgh Filmhouse today, and at the GFT tomorrow. Her
book, Script Girls -- Women Screenwriters in Hollywood, is published by
the British Film Institute, price $11.95p.

Ireland 8, England 20,
ENGLAND captain Will Carling blazed the trail towards a comfortable
victory over Ireland in windswept Dublin.
Carling is back where he thrives -- in Five Nations action -- and he
showed his relish with a try after only eight minutes to set England on
the path towards total control by half-time.
England led 12-3 by then and an Irish side weakened by withdrawals and
injury on the day were never going to overtake that.
The second-half try count was one each, but Ireland's score was an
irrelevant kick-and-rush effort late on when England were 20-3 in front.
Carling said: ''I enjoyed that. We moved the ball whenever we could
and Rob Andrew created space for me. We are very pleased to win,
especially when we woke up and saw that Dublin was gale-swept.''
One blot on England's efficient performance was the first yellow card
for a white shirt -- brandished at try-scoring flanker Ben Clarke by
French referee Patrick Thomas, who had a testing game in applying the
laws. Clarke was done for stamping on Simon Geoghegan, his Bath
team-mate.
There was an appalling moment for Clarke when Thomas produced both the
red and yellow cards, so the England player was ultimately relieved that
it was only a warning and not a sending-off.
Clarke claimed: ''I'm not a malicious player. I was trying to step
over Simon. I was genuinely going for the ball.''
He was backed up by Geoghegan, who said: ''I don't know what all the
fuss is about. If Ben stood on me I did not feel a thing.''
But another Bath player, Victor Ubogu, spearheaded English criticism
of Irish prop Nick Popplewell, who later apologised for trying to pull
Ubogu's leg away from a solid scrummaging platform.
It is an old trick, most memorably used by David Sole, then Scotland
captain, against England's Jeff Probyn four years ago.
''It is illegal and very dangerous,'' said Ubogu, while England
captain Will Carling claimed: ''We kept telling the referee about it but
he did nothing until late on.''
The result puts England firmly on the path for a Grand Slam challenge
to add to their European supremacy in 1991 and 1992. They face France
next month in what will again be billed as ''le crunch''.
Rowell, sending England out for the first time in a Five Nations
match, made sure that his influence was felt by exploiting the new
International Board rule that allows coaches on the pitch at half-time
-- despite the Rugby Union saying that the new practice was disapproved
by them.
Meanwhile two locks face a spell on the sidelines. Neil Francis will
not contribute to Ireland's Five Nations campaign for up to six weeks
after having sprung a rib cartilage, while England's Martin Johnson
suffered a recurrence of his hamstring problem.
Francis, who retired injured just before half-time, obviously will
miss Ireland's next Five Nations championship match, against Scotland on
February 4.
The Irish team for Murrayfield is not likely to be announced until the
end of this week, coach Gerry Murphy said yesterday. ''Apart from the
injury to Neil, we also need to have a look at the progress being made
by Jonathan Bell,'' he said.
Bell dropped out of the team on Friday evening because of a bruised
thigh muscle. His place on the left wing went to Niall Woods, who had a
fine game and looks likely to be retained.
The versatile Bell might displace Philip Danaher in the centre or be
preferred at full back to Conor O'Shea.
Ireland -- C O'Shea (Lansdowne); S Geoghegan (Bath), B Mullin
(Blackrock College), captain, P Danaher (Garryowen), N Woods (Blackrock
College); P Burke (Cork Constitution), N Hogan (Terenure College); N

Corkery (Cork Constitution), P Johns (Dungannon). Replacements -- M
Field (Malone), E Elwood (Lansdowne), A Rolland (Blackrock College), G
Fulcher (Cork Constitution), G Halpin (London Irish), T Kingston
(Dolphin).
England -- M J Catt (Bath); T Underwood (Leicester), W D C Carling
(Harlequins), captain, J C Guscott (Bath), R Underwood (Leicester); C R
Andrew (Wasps), K P P Bracken (Bristol); J Leonard, B C Moore (both

BRITISH fishermen plan a ''sustained campaign'' to win back waters
lost to Spanish trawlers under the common fisheries policy.
The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations called the policy
''a disaster'' and said an action committee would be set up to urge the
Government to withdraw from it.
The plans were announced after a four-hour meeting in Derby yesterday
attended by around 50 members of the federation, which represents around
6000 crews and their vessels.

A GROUP of Scottish students trapped by the aftermath of the
earthquake in Japan finally arrived home last night after an ordeal none
of them will forget. It included a four-hour walk through some of the
worst affected parts of Kobe to the nearby city of Osaka which was less
badly hit by the disaster.
The students, from the Scottish Centre for Japanese Studies at
Stirling University, arrived at Glasgow Airport at 8.50 last night after
a 12-hour flight from Osaka to Copenhagen and a two-hour connecting
flight. They received an emotional welcomed from relatives, friends and
the director of the centre, Professor Joseph Moran.
All said they were experiencing mixed feelings on their return to
Scotland -- relief that they were safe and with their families again but
also concern for those they had left behind in the devastation of Kobe.
The group comprised: Irene McVey, 29, of Liberton, Edinburgh; Catriona
Mcpherson, 22, of Beardsen, Glasgow; Wai Ling Chan, 25, also from
Glasgow; Anne Kelly, 25, of East Kilbride; Audrey Morrison, 37, of
Falkirk; Sara Furley, 25, from Aberlady, and Torsten Rex, 29, whose home
is in Germany.
Also with them was Professor Moran's wife Chihoko, who was leading the
group on a one-month visit to the Kobe Institute as part of their
post-graduate studies when the earthquake struck one week after they
arrived.
The group had been forced to go ahead with their plans to escape from
Kobe on foot to Osaka -- about 13 miles away -- after attempts to get
them out by helicopter, car and motor cycle all came to nothing. They
had been without water and sanitation and had to ration food after the
earthquake.
They ended up walking most of the way to Osaka, some carrying heavy
luggage, and then taking a train into the city itself, and later managed
to find accommodation at a hotel and finally have a wash and a meal
before getting their tickets exchanged to fly home.
Two of the group, a Dane and a Taiwanese, are understood to have
elected to stay in Japan for a little longer.
Speaking at the international arrivals area of Glasgow Airport, Anne
Kelly, from Loch Striven in East Kilbride, described how she was
sleeping in their three-storey accommodation in Kobe when the earthquake
struck.
''I remember waking up and I thought it was just another tremor so I
really wasn't too bothered about it.
''Then they went on and on and on so I knew that it was an earthquake
after about three seconds.
''There were shelves over my head and things started falling on my
head from the shelves so I thought the ceiling was coming down.''
The building the students were staying in, situated on a hill above
Kobe, was relatively unscathed but about six hours after the first
tremor, most of them went into Kobe ''out of curiosity'' to see what had
happened.
Sara Furley added: ''It was incredible. We didn't think anything had
happened that badly. We went down and some of the areas had just
collapsed. All the wooden houses had just gone. There were no emergency
services and people were just wandering around in a state of shock
obviously trying to locate their families.''
Catriona Macpherson, asked how it felt to be home said, close to
tears: ''I'm glad to be home but you still feel for the people out
there. We are lucky to be back but they have nothing at all. It's
strange.''

Rape and forced marriage in the name of Islam is a threat hanging over
millions of women.Simon Hollington describes the effects of sexual
terrorism in Egypt
IRENE speaks of what happened to her in a hushed voice -- she says she
has forgiven the men who kidnapped and raped her in the name of Islam.
Rape and forced marriage as a means of conversion to Islam is a threat
that now hangs over three and a half to five million non-Muslim women in
Egypt.
For Egyptian women, whether Christian or Muslim, virginity is
sacrosanct until the marriage vow is exchanged. At 17, Irene is now
deemed as ''damaged goods'', shamed beyond salvation. Her dream of a
career in medicine shelved, Irene is now considering a life within a
convent.
In a case similar to Irene's, a father killed his daughter after she
had been raped by extremists, rather than face the shame of her
desecration. Another non-Muslim girl committed suicide after she was
forced to marry a member of an Islamic group.
Case studies of individual rape have been carried out by the Jubilee
Campaign, a British-based human rights organisation.
An organisation to counter fundamentalist attacks on Christians, the
Servants of the Cross claims that 7000 to 10,000 forced conversions have
taken place over three years of increasing tension.
The actual number of so-called ''rape-conversions'' is unknown, and
often unreported through shame or fear. However, the church I visited
which had a congregation of 5000 had two rape-conversion victims.
The Egyptian Coptic community is one of the oldest Christian
communities in the world, founded in the year 41AD by St Mark, a
millennium before Islam arrived in Egypt.
The Copts -- who are close to Roman Catholics in their theology, but
have their own Pope -- represent 16% of the 60 million Egyptian
population, and are dispersed among the villages and fertile plains of
the River Nile and the crowded suburbs of Cairo.
Coptic women, as young as 13, are being targeted for sexual terrorism
by the dreaded Al-Gama Al-Islamyia and other Islamic extremists, one of
many fundamentalist groups springing up across North Africa and Southern
Asia.
Irene, a pale-faced dark-eyed girl worships twice a day in the small
concrete church slotted in between the workshops and merchants in a
dusty alleyway in Imbaba, a poor Cairo suburb with a population of
around 200,000. It is also the home of the Egyptian Fundamentalist
Movement and was declared an ''Islamic State'' in 1992. Tourists are not
welcomed to its thronging streets.
Outside of the small church in an alley packed with life -- donkeys,
camels, horses, chickens, and children -- are two nervous police guards,
rifles at the ready. However, there have been fewer murders of
Christians, or church burnings, sword wavings, and less verbal abuse,
since 1992 when the government sent 14,000 troops to Imbaba and rounded
up 600 extremists.
While denying that there was a problem between the Copts and the
Muslim community, other than a historical local difficulty, Nabil Osman,
chairman of the state information service, said: ''Life is very normal
in Egypt, these Islamic groups have no structure, they are little
scattered cells. We have now arrested the ringleaders, and the country
has been made safe.''
The tension, beyond the tourist confines, however, remains palpable to
the outside observer, and the co-existence that characterised the two
great faiths for centuries has been severely damaged through sectarian
violence.
This year's most violent attacks took place in March in the southern
province of Asyut when five Copts were killed. In the same month, at
Muhrraq Monastery, gunmen opened fire, killing a priest, a monk, and
three Coptic visitors. According to police sources, Copts represent the
single largest group of murder victims. In 1993 the murder toll amounted
to 200, with 700 casualties.
Irene is a statistic that doesn't have a home on official paper or in
a government computer. She smiles when asked about her feelings towards
the men who kidnapped her and says: ''We must forgive those who trespass
against us.''
During her holidays Irene used to work in her aunt's clothes shop,
where dresses are strung colourfully across the street. ''One day last
year I was walking home, along the same street I had walked every day of
my life.
''Like a dark shadow, I felt an icy sensation in my stomach, when I
turned my head and saw a car slowing -- it was full of the bearded men
we all fear (fundamentalists). I don't know if they planned this or not.
What happened after that is a dark horror. I was taken to a house and
used by a man, that is all I can say. Then some men held me down and
poured acid onto my hand to burn off the cross that all Copts have
tattooed proudly there. They made me wear a veil and read the Koran all
day.''
Irene's captors tried to force her to marry a man twice her age, but
she quoted the Koran back at them, saying that their actions of hate
were against God's will. ''They were taken aback. It was perhaps the
only time I smiled in the five months of my captivity.''
Then the group, which consisted of about four men and eight women,
took Irene to Al-Azhar University, where they tried to force her to
convert to Islam, but she refused to sign the papers.
Irene's parents claim that the police were reluctant to investigate
the matter, seeing it as a domestic problem, however, in January this
year police raided the house because the group were suspected of having
attacked government property, and Irene was released.
''Many of my friends are Muslims, they are my brothers and sisters,
even despite what happened to me -- that will never change,'' Irene told
me after her third hour of prayer in the packed church.
''She is a little sad,'' one of the two priests who look after the
5000-strong congregation told me. Many of the women touched the girl and
bowed involuntarily as they left the church.
The Jubilee Campaign, led by David Alton MP, undertook a study of all
aspects of Coptic persecution travelling through Egypt in 1993. It
interviewed girls as young as 13 who had been raped. ''The Copts are the
largest representation of different culture in the Arab world,'' a
spokesman explained, ''the fundamentalists want to drive out all
vestiges of non-Islamic culture. We are not sure that rape is being used
systematically, but it is just one other of many tools being used to
force Christians to convert.''
A prominent Islamic leader allegedly told a Cairo civil court that
while the state considers murder a crime, it is not a crime to kill an
apostate from Islam. The media is filled with a diet of anti-Coptic
incitement, and school textbooks show girls wearing the veil and talk of
the loose morals of Western women -- Coptic women who do not wear the
veil are made to feel more vulnerable and are often subject to abuse.
Over the generations there have been occasional violent clashes
between the two religions -- but attacks against young women is a more
recent development and is particularly prevalent in Upper Egypt, and on
the Nile delta, where poverty has fuelled the growth of Islamic
fundamentalism -- and with a population adding a million to its numbers
every eight months, the future of the minority Copts looks precarious.
Many have already started to emigrate.
Reporting sectarian killings from Upper Egypt this month, an
international news agency stated; ''Coptic girls were under constant
pressure to convert to Islam, and that many had claimed to have been
kidnapped and raped.''

BRUSSELS: Thousands of Belgians packed cathedrals across the country
yesterday to show solidarity with a French bishop sacked by the Vatican
for his liberal views. An estimated 2000 people filled Brussels
cathedral, expressing their support for Jacques Gaillot with prayers and
calls for the church to be more tolerant.
In France itself, at least 8000 people also protested against the
sacking. Gaillot, dubbed the ''Red Cleric,'' was dismissed as Bishop of
Evreux after defying Vatican doctrine by urging the use of condoms
against Aids, speaking in favour of allowing priests to marry and
calling for greater tolerance of homosexuality.

Scottish Schools 7, New Zealand Schools 19
EVERYONE associated with this squad of Scottish schoolboys should be
holding their heads high this morning.
They faced a big, fit bunch of All Blacks who have been touring the UK
and handing out thumpings. To lead for over an hour, and keep the losing
margin to just 12 points is laudable and was due to a fine mixture of
individual skills and teamwork.
The few hundred people who came to Murrayfield early were rewarded
with an entertaining game which proved that rugby can still be fun.
These boys play it hard, but they still seem to be enjoying it -- a
state of affairs which does not always exist into the senior game.
The rise through the ranks of the latest in the Bulloch and Craig
dynasties, Alan and James respectively, continues and young Alan will
have done himself no harm with a fine all-round performance which had
its pinnacle in a try-scoring finish to a break by James and good
linking work. Daniel Mallinson converted.
Scotland were winning loads of lineout ball through Jason White and
Andrew Barnes. The 6ft 6ins ''Barney'' has what it takes to follow dad
Ian to the very top.
The Scotland play was inventive and exciting and much of what was good
centred on Heriot's Gordon Ross.
A Matthew Carrington penalty goal was all New Zealand had to show for
their first-half performance.
Then the full back from King's College, Auckland, decided with the
help of a colleague or two, to turn the second half into the Matthew
Carrington show. He slotted his second penalty then finished off Rimi
Ropati's powerful break with a try, to which he added goal points.
Two further penalty goals from Carrington, as the New Zealanders
showed slightly superior fitness in the later stages, completed the
scoring.
Scottish Schools -- J S D Moffat (Edinburgh Academy); J M Craig (St
Aloysius' College), A J Bulloch (Hutchesons' Grammar School), M J M
Mayer (Merchiston Catle), D R Mallinson (George Watson's College); G
Ross (George Heriot's) S J Hannah (Merchiston Castle), captain; P J

Outlaw (George Heriot's). Replacements -- C H Black (Merchston Castle)
for Bulloch (temporary), G E Hoyle (Stewart's Melville College) for
Walker, M J Harvey (Peebles High) for Gladstone (67 minutes).
New Zealand Schools -- M Carrington; D Howlett, R Ropati, B Miller, P
Petelo; Q Sanft, B Willis; E Morgan, B Morris, S Johnstone, P Jenkins, K
Tukino, A Tiatia, B McLeod, P Wilson. Replacement -- S Codd for

FOOTBALL is full of little ironies. Clyde had scored two goals in
every meeting with Queen of the South this season until Saturday. They
found the net three times -- but suffered their first defeat by the
Dumfries team, who won the second division match at Broadwood by 4-3.
The key was the absence of suspended centre-half Jim Thomson in the
home defence. His colleagues persisted in backing off and allowing the
visiting forwards plenty of room -- a policy which led to Queens'
decisive burst of three goals in the space of nine minutes.
The lively John Dickson had put Clyde ahead with less than a minute
played, but Andy McFarlane exploited the whimsical gusts of wind to send
in the visitors' opener from an improbable angle in 15 minutes. A diving
header by former Clyde player Steve Mallan from 15 yards was followed by
Duncan Campbell's run and shot.
The home fans were roused midway in the second half when Dickson also
harnessed the wind, curling the ball in direct from a corner for his
fifth goal in three matches. It seemed to be all over eight minutes from
time when Queens broke and Dave Kennedy finished off a tidy three-man
move -- but Gordon Parks reduced the deficit to maintain the excitement.
There were other triumphs for teams in the relegation zone. Meadowbank
beat Morton through Stuart Sorbie's strike just after half-time, and
even bottom-dogs Brechin won, with a solo effort by Ralph Brand
punishing Berwick for their missed chances.
The beneficiaries of those results were the leaders, Stenhousemuir,
who went five points clear. Adrian Sprott's low drive and a Miller
Mathieson header had them 2-0 up after 35 minutes at East Fife, by which
time the home side's former Warrior, Dave Beaton, had been sent off for
two cautions.
Martin Mooney and Hugh Ward gave Dumbarton a good half-time lead, but
they squandered other chances and had to settle for a point after Tommy
Tait and Stirling Albion player-manager Kevin Drinkell struck back.
Ross County maintained their momentum in the third division when
Gordon Connelly and Robbie Williamson punished errors for a 2-0 away win
over rusty East Stirlingshire. Cowdenbeath were hit by suspensions, but
still won 3-0 at Arbroath through Willie Callaghan's chip, and shots by
Ian Black and Stuart Wardell.
Queen's Park picked up where they left off against Morton in the cup
by racing to a 2-0 lead at home to Caley Thistle through Ian Maxwell and
Gary Orr. Caley's trialist, ex-Ranger John MacDonald, briefly gave them
hope but Brian McPhee and Jamie Rodden rounded off a 4-1 win.

THE man cleared of murdering a woman in front of her son on Wimbledon
Common, Mr Colin Stagg, and his girlfriend were last night charged with
affray, assault, and possessing offensive weapons. The charges followed
an incident yesterday on the London common where a father and his
11-year-old son were allegedly threatened with an axe.
Mr Stagg was released from the Old Bailey last September after a Judge
criticised the police for using psychological profiling. He was on trial
for the murder of 23-year-old Ms Rachel Nickell. Mr Stagg, 31, of
Roehampton, south-west London, was yesterday charged with possessing an
axe and his girlfriend, Ms Diane Beddoes, 26, of the same address, with
possessing a cosh. She was released on bail but Mr Stagg was remanded.

THE #8.6m Eurocentral rail freight terminal at Mossend -- built at
public expense -- will probably be privatised within four years,
according to manager Ken Duffy.
But he pledged that its owners, RfD -- BR's Railfreight Distribution
-- would invest in expansion as and when demand called for it.
RfD, currently developing traffic through the Channel Tunnel, is to be
privatised only when business at its five UK terminals is better
established, according to the Government. It is already being separated
from BR's container handling business, Freightliner, scheduled for
privatisation later this year.
Mr Duffy, who also manages Freightliner's Coatbridge centre, where 125
people are employed, said: ''I would expect RfD will not be ready for
privatisation for three to four years. But we are driven by customer
demand, and we can and will resource Mossend as that increases.''
He admitted, however, that business had been slower than expected
since Mossend opened last July. Customer resistance to security and
safety issues in sending freight through the tunnel was blamed, along
with a need to instil more confidence in the ''revolutionary concept''
of delivering goods to the Continent by rail only.
Mossend sends two trains a day, excluding Sundays, to Paris, with one
also serving Lyons, Avignon, and Perpignon. A third goes to Luxembourg.
A Milan service begins this week, and a Spanish service next month.
The trains usually haul 40, 13-metre containers a day, carrying
whisky, foodstuffs, and electronics. New business includes transporting
paper from Corpach, Fort William, and a deal with IBM to export
Greenock-built electronics products is expected soon.
Up to three trains arrive daily at Mossend from Europe, carrying wine,
brandy, and white goods. A compound, holding 800 imported cars at any
one time, will open later this year.
Mr Duffy said: ''The tunnel is a new product, and we have no divine
right to say people must use it. But confidence is growing as freight
customers become satisfied that the trains can deliver. We have gone
from nothing to a terminal at Mossend of infinite potential.''
He added that developments at the adjacent freight village and
enterprise zone were the key to future growth: ''There is no doubt the
terminal would stagnate without such progress. It's a chicken and egg
situation. They cannot attract business without the railhead, and if it
is developed, the business will come in.''
RfD forecasts cross-Channel business will soon triple to more than six
million tonnes a year. More than 80 trains a week now operate between
the UK and mainland Europe via terminals at Mossend, Manchester,
Liverpool, Birmingham, and London.

Grozny, Sunday
REBEL Chechen fighters today spat defiance as more Russian shells hit
the regional capital of Grozny but a period of relative calm allowed
people to venture cautiously out of their cellars in search of food and
water.
As the conflict entered its seventh week, hundreds of demonstrators in
Moscow mourned the victims and called for an end to the fighting. Pope
John Paul added his voice to the appeal and Germany made its views clear
in no uncertain terms.
''The bloodshed in Chechnya must stop immediately,'' German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel told a news conference in Berne after talks with
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev.
In Grozny, Russian shells slammed into both the city centre and the
suburbs, sending clouds of black smoke over the devastated city. But the
past few days have seen something of a lull in the bombardment.
The Russian government's press service, quoted by Itar-Tass news
agency, said this afternoon that Russian troops had not engaged in
active combat over the past 24 hours.
''They maintained control over districts and villages, repelled
attacks by militants from illegal armed groups and regrouped forces,''
it said.
If Grozny falls, separatist Chechen fighters say they will form
partisan groups, move into the Caucasus mountains and battle the
Russians from there.
''I'm sure the Russians will not take Grozny, but if they do, we have
another place in the mountains,'' said Khasan Dolgayev, a fighter in the
southern suburb of Chernorechiye. ''The war will be until death, until
the last drop of blood is spilled.''
''We will fight with all means at our disposal as we have no way
back,'' said one tall, bearded fighter in the city centre. ''The
mountains are our second defence,'' a comrade added.
Russia sent troops into Chechnya on December 11 to disarm local
separatists and assert Moscow's authority over a region it regards as a
nest of criminals.
Hundreds, if not thousands, of soldiers and civilians have been
killed. But Moscow, despite its superior firepower, has been unable to
subdue the fiercely independent Muslim region.
Chechen fighters in Grozny said Russian soldiers were beaten back when
they tried to take a chemical plant in the west of the city.
Groups of rebels dressed in white overalls dodged snipers in the city
centre. People desperate for food did the same.
''We've got no bread, no salt, nothing,'' wept one woman as she
searched through ruined shops for scraps of food.
President Boris Yeltsin's use of force in Chechnya was denounced at an
anti-war meeting near the Moscow headquarters of the former Soviet KGB
security police.
''I ask you to remember the dead,'' said human rights commissioner
Sergei Kovalyov. ''I ask you to remember the people who are living in
Grozny now, in cellars, in the cold, in fear.''
A senior Russian parliamentary official sought to defuse anger in the
Muslim world, saying the conflict was a fight against common criminals,
not Islam.
''There is no relation between (Chechen leader) Dzhokhar Dudayev's
gang and Islam,'' the Federation Council's deputy chairman, Ramazan
Abdulatipov, told a news conference in Cairo.

DETECTIVES are investigating the suspicious death of a young woman
whose body was found at an Ayrshire railway station at the weekend.
The discovery was made by British Transport Police officers carrying
out a routine patrol of property at West Kilbride station on Saturday
night.
The dead woman, believed to be in her 20s, was found in a bothy used
as a store by railway workmen, at the end of the platform.
Last night, Strathclyde Police had still not positively identified the
woman. But it is understood that they were checking a possible link with
a recent missing person report.
Forensic experts yesterday carried out a thorough examination of the
scene. Detectives conducted door-to-door inquiries in the town and a
police incident caravan was set up at the station.
About 40 officers from Strathclyde Police and British Transport Police
were involved in the operation.
Speaking at the scene, Detective Chief Inspector Bob Lauder, in charge
of the inquiry, could give no information as to the cause of death. That
would be determined by a post-mortem examination, he said.
Asked about a missing person report received by police recently, he
declined to give any further information except to say that no
connections could be made between the missing person and the dead woman
at this stage.
Mr Lauder appealed for information from any train passengers or anyone
else who had used the station in recent days. He is hoping someone may
have seen some unusual activity which did not strike them as suspicious
at the time.
British Transport Police are checking with drivers and guards on
trains which have passed through the station since last Wednesday
evening, the last time the bothy was checked before Saturday night's
discovery.
A phone line has been installed at the incident caravan for members of
the public to contact police. The number is 0294 822251.

FAUSTINO Asprilla was sent off in the dying seconds after having set

The Colombian, whose third-minute goal had given Parma the lead, went
off for reacting to a late tackle.
Asprilla's goal followed a breathtaking display of first-time passing,
and Gianfranco Zola made it 2-0 just after the break from a penalty.
Parma have 35 points from 17 games, having played a game more than the
leaders, who suffered a shock 3-0 defeat at Cagliari after a virtuoso
display by Roberto Muzzi.
In the seventh minute he was brought down for a penalty converted by
Belgian Luis Oliveira.Just after half-time, Muzzi's fine run and cross
set up Panamanian Julio Dely Valdez before Muzzi himself scored with a
penalty in 65 minutes.
Lazio lie third behind Juventus and Parma with 31 points after Alen
Boksic's fourth goal in two matches sealed a 1-0 win at Brescia.
Champions AC Milan moved into joint-fourth spot alongside Roma, with
late goals from Frenchman Marcel Desailly and Paolo Di Canio providing a
2-0 win over Fiorentina, whose central defender Daniele Carnasciali was
sent off in the first half.

<HEADLINE>Leader stakes his future on bringing Labour round to the need for Clause 4 changes. Blair gives ultimatum if power is to be won</HEADLINE>

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday gave his party the blunt message
that, if it was not prepared to fight for power his way, it might not
achieve power at all.
He staked his future on winning the struggle to rid the party of its
absolute commitment to nationalisation and told union barons and left
wingers that the centre-piece of the new Clause 4 in the constitution
would be social justice -- not public ownership.
His message stopped short of ''back me or sack me'', but he made clear
that he had a vision of the stance Labour needed to take if it was to
win the next election. Failure to change would mean Labour becoming
little more than a pressure group in perpetual opposition.
An indication of the problems Mr Blair still has to confront in
modernising his party came from left-wing MPs Ken Livingstone and Jeremy
Corbyn, and from a comment by the Transport and General Workers Union
leader, Mr Bill Morris.
Mr Morris said at the weekend that his union would not back any new
clause unless it contained a commitment to public ownership, while the
left-wing MPs said Mr Blair faced a grassroots rebellion over Clause 4.
Mr Livingstone said Mr Blair was receiving ''duff'' advice from people
who understood neither the British public nor the Labour Party.
Mr Blair acknowledged the risks he was running in forcing a rethink of
the most fundamental principle enshrined in the Labour constitution. He
said in a BBC television interview: ''You don't embark on a change as
serious as this unless you are really aware of the consequences.'' He
added, however, that it was ''absolutely vital'' for the party to
redefine its identity if it was to win power at the next General
Election.
''It is a choice of destiny for this party. We either become that
vibrant left-of-centre party, looking forward and addressing the real
needs of this country, or we will remain where we have been for 15 years
-- essentially a pressure group exerting influence on a Conservative
government, but not governing ourselves.''
Labour could not present itself as a party that wished to change the
country if it did not have the courage to change itself.
''If you look at the basic principles of the Labour Party, it is to do
with its values,'' he said. ''Of course we should state what we actually
believe about public ownership, but let's state that and not have the
words in the clause at present which can be misrepresented about public
ownership.
''The centre-piece of the new Clause 4 should be our basic belief in
the values that underpin Labour, which are not values about public
ownership, but to do with the nature of society.''
He added: ''What people want to see in the new Clause 4 is what we
actually believe about the economy and ownership and, much more
important than that, they want to see a commitment to basic principles
of social justice and solidarity and so forth, which is what the Labour
Party believes in.
''It is not Clause 4 that attracts people to us. Nobody I know joins
the Labour Party because they believe in the control of the means of
production, distribution, and exchange.''
Mr Blair said he was utterly opposed to the privatisation of water,
electricity, and the railways, but the party had to be realistic about
what it could do to reverse them.
He shrugged off pressure from some union leaders to offer limited
renationalisation in some sectors of industry in return for support for
changes to Clause 4.
Labour would oppose the sell-off of the railways and look at how best
to bring them back into public ownership and public accountability, but
full renationalisation might not be possible.
''We are not in the business of spraying around guarantees and

Mr Blair said.
* Labour yesterday shrugged off a claim by the Liberal Democrats that
a Labour government would have to raise income tax by 5p in the pound or
increase borrowing by #12bn to fund its programmes. A Labour spokesman
said the Lib Dems had ''plucked fantasy figures out of the air in a
desperate bid to get some publicity''.

<HEADLINE>850 jobs in pipeline for Mossend freight village</HEADLINE>

FIVE separate deals bringing 850 jobs to the freight village and
enterprise zone beside the Euro rail terminal at Mossend in Lanarkshire
are expected to be secured within the next three months.
Four deals will be genuine new job creations, with the private sector
pumping millions of pounds into bricks and mortar at the sites. The
fifth will be a displacement of work, and 200 jobs, from elsewhere in
central Scotland.
The deals are being hailed by the Lanarkshire Development Agency as a
tangible sign that the Channel tunnel freight terminal will be, as
predicted, the catalyst for industrial development in a county still
affected by the closure of Ravenscraig steelworks, as well as by last
week's loss of 600 highly skilled jobs at Rolls-Royce's aerospace
division in East Kilbride.
The #8.6m terminal, run by BR's Railfreight Distribution (RfD), was
financed by the LDA and the European Regional Development Fund, and
opened in July last year with trains to and from France and Luxembourg.
RfD confirmed at the weekend that a Mossend to Milan service would
begin on Thursday, and a service to Spain would be launched next month.
Manager Ken Duffy said industrial development around the terminal was
''absolutely vital'' to its future success, and revealed that a 20-acre
compound for imported cars delivered by rail from the Continent would be
up and running later this year via a #2.6m investment by a private firm
which will employ 50 people.
The LDA is in ''final negotiations'' with two distribution companies,
one in white goods and the other in food and drink, to create 300 jobs
at its 127-acre freight village where it is spending #6m on ground
consolidations works, due to be completed in August.
If the deal is completed the white goods firm will build an #8m,
250,000sq ft warehouse and services centre, and the food firm will spend
#5m on a similar 150,000sq ft complex.
The white goods' firm, based in England, would be setting up north of
the Border for the first time, while the food firm, already in Scotland,
wants to expand its distribution network.
Three sites are ''under offer'' at the adjacent 100-acre industrial
and distribution park, a joint venture between the LDA and Amec
Developments, where #7m is being spent on ground and servicing works.
The interest comes from a distribution company, plus DIY and white
goods retailers who want central points from which to send out goods to
their Scottish stores as they arrive from England or the Continent.
The trio, who would employ 550 people, want units totalling 450,000sq
ft, costing #16m to build. Two are prepared to fund their own centres,
with the third leasing from Amec.
The distribution company already has a facility employing 200 in
Scotland, which will close if the relocation to Mossend is approved. The
others currently supply Scottish interests from the south, and would be
expansions.
LDA chief executive Archie Bethel said formal confirmation of the five
deals was expected before the end of April, with the centres operational
early next year.
In addition, two American electronics companies are in talks over the
95-acre strategic investment site owned by Scottish Enterprise at
Mossend. The land has been set aside for an inward investment with a
minimum jobs potential of 2000.
Their interest is especially welcomed after the Japanese electronics
giant Samsung, at the eleventh-hour, chose the North-east of England
instead of the Lanarkshire site for a project last year involving 3000
jobs.
Mr Bethel thinks that at least 8000 jobs will be created and
investment of #218m generated in the next 10-15 years at Mossend, given
the level of inquiries so far from firms interested in locating near the
terminal.
He added: ''We are already about nine months ahead of schedule. We did
not think we would get offers until the infrastructure stage was
completed.''
Demand is expected to soar when the A8 upgrading to motorway status
between Baillieston and Newhouse begins next year, providing enhanced
access to Mossend for hauliers.
However, Mr Bethel warned that the impending transfer of Rolls-Royce's
research, design, and development unit at East Kilbride to Derby showed
the fragility of Lanarkshire's economic regeneration. He likened it to a
game of snakes and ladders, and added: ''We have to redouble efforts,
and create jobs faster than losing them.''

<HEADLINE>EIS claims reform will cause redundancy discrimination Teachers 'could lose thousands'</HEADLINE>

TEACHERS could lose thousands of pounds in redundancy payments if they
were to lose their jobs because of local government reform, the
Educational Institute of Scotland claimed today.
Staff under the age of 50 who are covered by the local government
superannuation scheme and made redundant by the move to single tier
authorities next year will, under the Scottish Office's compensation
proposals, be entitled to payments amounting to a maximum of 66 weeks'
pay, depending on age and length of service.
Teachers, however, are covered by their own superannuation scheme and,
according to the EIS, any teacher made redundant will be limited to the
statutory maximum compensation of 30 weeks.
For a classroom teacher, the effect of what the union calls ''this
discrimination'' could mean a personal loss of nearly #15,000.
It is highly unlikely, however, that teachers will lose jobs because
of local government reform. The Scottish Office expects teachers to
transfer automatically to the new councils.
In its response to a Scottish Office consultation paper on
compensation arrangements, the EIS says the Local Government Minister,
Mr Allan Stewart, ''may argue that schools and teachers will be largely
unaffected by the reorganisation. But unless he can give a guarantee
that no teacher or other staff member in this group will be made
redundant, the arrangements remain blatantly discriminatory''.
Mr Ian McKay, EIS assistant secretary, said yesterday that the union,
which represents eight out of 10 classroom teachers, was particularly
concerned about staff on teachers' conditions who carry out other
functions.
He said the Local Government Staff Commission, which is responsible
for placing existing staff into equivalent posts in the new councils,
highlighted the position of advisers, psychologists, and other education
staff in the present authorities who carry out central support duties
such as special needs and learning support.
He said: ''These staff are identified as in the 'most difficult to
place' category. Despite this clear indication of a group of staff at
risk, the Scottish Office has specifically excluded them from receiving
their proper compensation.
''For a senior adviser this discrimination could cost an individual
employee more than #25,000.''
Mr McKay said that, in services such as educational psychology, two
psychologists with the same service could have a difference of more than
#21,000 in compensation payments simply because they were covered by the
different superannuation schemes.
He added: ''The present situation is unfair, discriminatory, and
unacceptable to teachers. We shall be raising the matter directly with
the staff commission and our colleagues in the STUC and other unions.
''We demand that Mr Stewart takes immediate action to correct this
discrimination against some local authority staff.''

IT WAS said of Sir Alexander Gibson, throughout his career in
Scotland, that his influence touched not only the large organisations
that he helped to shape or found, such as the SNO and Scottish Opera,
but almost every aspect of Scottish musical life.
That assessment has been reiterated in countless tributes from across
the spectrum of Scottish society in the week following Sir Alexander's
death from a heart attack in London last weekend.
Tangible evidence of that influence, and the regard in which Sir
Alexander, as man and musician, was held, could be seen on Saturday
morning at a funeral service for the conductor where mourners, from the
profession and the public, packed Glasgow Cathedral to capacity.
They came from everywhere in a remarkable testament to the man who was
widely agreed to be the most important Scottish musician of the century.
Present and former members of all four Scottish orchestras -- the Royal
Scottish National, Scottish Opera, the BBC Scottish Symphony, and the
Scottish Chamber orchestras -- turned out in large numbers.
Singers and conductors, including Bill McCue and James Loughran, along
with composers and chorusmasters from across the generations, were also
present. Administrators and former colleagues of Sir Alex travelled from
great distances -- from Los Angeles, Kentucky, and Hong Kong. Sir Alex's
long-time associate and co-founder of the Edinburgh Festival Chorus,
Arthur Oldham, travelled from Paris.
Representatives of the Scottish Arts Council and the country's leading
academic institutions, such as the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama and St Mary's Music School in Edinburgh, also attended.
Civic dignitaries and leading members of Glasgow's business community
were represented: Bailie Tom Dingwall, acting Lord Provost of Glasgow,
former Lord Provost Sir William Gray; Forbes MacPherson, chairman of the
Glasgow Development Agency, and Geoffrey Duncan, Lord Dean of Guild; all
were present at what one luminary described as ''an astonishing and
wholly appropriate turnout''.
Sir Alex's widow, Lady Veronica, and his four children and their
families, displayed what was regarded as enormous emotional courage by
greeting members of the congregation who formed a huge queue, the length
of the cathedral, to pay their respects to the family at the end of the
service. The family was the last to leave the cathedral.
The service itself, conducted by the Rev William J Morris, was
straightforward, unpretentious, and moving, marred only for those near
the back of the cathedral by an inadequate tannoy system.
Peter Hemmings, general director of Los Angeles Opera and the first
administrator of Scottish Opera, which Sir Alex, ''the right man at the
right time'', founded in 1962, gave the tribute. He recalled Sir Alex's
early days with the company, observed the vast number of people in
Scotland who owed their careers to the conductor, alluded to his sense
of humour, and quoted Sir Alex's own words, describing his utter
devotion to music, how it was his life, work, and solace, and how his
wife and family had always understood this and supported him.
At the emotional core of the service there was, of course, music: two
intensely moving performances from the companies with which Sir Alex's
name will remain indelibly associated. The chorus and orchestra of
Scottish Opera sang Mozart's Ave Verum Corpus, directed by another of
Sir Alex's long-time associates, conductor John Currie. Then the strings
of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, with orchestra leader Edwin
Paling, played the heartbreaking slow movement from Elgar's Serenade.
A private cremation will take place today. Meanwhile, there is already
a growing view in the community that the city of Glasgow should find
some manner of permanently commemorating the name and reputation of the
man who was responsible for stimulating the renaissance this century of
musical life in this country.
It is understood that the principal music organisations with which Sir
Alex was associated, including Scottish Opera and the Royal SNO, are
already beginning discussions towards an appropriate, collaborative
musical tribute.

THE SNP has won a victory over a 1200-year-old Scots defeat after
launching a Euro-protest on St Andrew's Day.
A statue representing Britain and commissioned to celebrate European
unity has now had words offensive to Scots struck from its accompanying
text.
The battle of Brunanbur, where the Scots were massacred near the
Humber in 837 by the Saxons, formed the inspiration for the statue
produced by artist Cristobel Gabarron.
The offending work is on show, one of Twelve European Muses, at the
Espace Leopold building of the European Parliament.
Previously, it was accompanied by a note which read: ''One of the most
decisive battles in Scottish history involving the defeat of Constantine
(King of Scotland) and his allies''.
It continued: ''It is easy enough to appreciate why Brunanbur should
hold a central place in the history of Wessex for Saxon chroniclers
boasted that 'no slaughter has ever been greater in this island'. ''
This was too much for Dr Allan Macartney, SNP Euro-MP for North-east
Scotland, who deemed the statue offensive and demanded it be replaced
with one representing only England.
Instead, the SNP deputy leader received word this weekend from the
European Parliament's governing body, the College of Quaestors, that the
words had been struck off.
Dr Macartney described the move as a ''wise decision'' and said:
''Quite obviously, the 'Great Britain' sculpture which celebrated, in
the words of the accompanying text, a victory of the Anglo-Saxons over
the Scots and totally inappropriate to the avowed theme of building
European unity.
''I am delighted that the words which offended the Scots have been
removed by the Parliament.''

ON the Paris catwalk Gianni Versace's supermodels were striking poses
like vintage fashion photographs, writes Francesca Fearon.
In the first couture show of the spring collection, on Saturday night,
models were conjuring up comparisons with top models of the fifties like
Wenda Parkinson and Barbara Goalen, wearing Balenciaga or Dior.
Versace's exquisitely tailored suits drew on the retro revival that
swept the spring ready-to-wear collection, with jackets that were shaped
close to the body and below-the-knee pencil skirts.
As shown in the picture above, threequarter length sleeves with
turn-up cuffs revealed satin-gloved hands clasping matching clutch bags,
while pencil skirts that elongated the legs alternated with satin
jersey, suedes, and drapes to look flirtatious. In his ready-to-wear
collection, Versace spoke of going back to the classics.
The pendulum has swung away from throwaway fashion and back to clothes
that endure the vicissitudes of fashion. The impeccable cut and rigorous
line of his spring atelier collection prove that fashion's new look has
planted its roots in couture.

A VISIT to Northern Ireland will be made tomorrow by Labour leader
Tony Blair and the party's Northern Ireland spokesman, Mo Mowlam.
They will discuss initiatives aimed at regenerating the area's
economy. They have called on the Government to have an economic
development strategy concentrating on encouragement for small
businesses, skills training, and steps to help the long-term unemployed.
The visit is a deliberate attempt by Labour to cosset support at a
time of renewed tensions between the Ulster Unionists, the British
Government, and Dublin.
A Labour spokesman said: ''This is the first of many consultation
meetings Labour will be holding this year. In the coming months
representatives from local councils, businesses, voluntary and community
groups will be able to voice their concerns to the Shadow Northern
Ireland team.''
Unionist alarm has heightened over some proposed arrangements which
would apparently give the Republic a key role in the province's affairs.
The Ulster Unionist leader, Mr James Molyneaux, is likely to have a
meeting with the Prime Minister to confirm Unionist threats to withdraw
support for the Government if cross-border bodies with executive powers
are up for negotiation, but both Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who
rejected Mr Molyneaux's fears as ''fantasy'', and the Northern Ireland
Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, have tried to calm the waters.
Mr Spring said: ''We are trying to find a situation where North and
South can work better together and we want to have co-operative
arrangements envisaged in the framework document and, obviously, there
will be a major role for both communities in Northern Ireland and a new
role for both Governments.
''I am surprised that a politician as serious as Mr Molyneaux is now
raising the question of joint sovereignty. We have been working over a
long period of time and we are very conscious of the fears on both sides
of the community in Northern Ireland and we want to ensure we get the
most widespread possible support for the package.''
Mr Spring is to have talks with Sir Patrick on Thursday and the
completion of the framework document is expected within the next month.
However, one of Mr Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist colleagues, Upper Bann
MP David Trimble, yesterday accused Mr Spring of being ''disingenuous in
the extreme''. He told BBC Radio: ''We have reason to believe officials
in the Northern Ireland Office have virtually conceded the Irish
Government's demands.''

GENEROUS Shetlanders have rallied round to help a crew of Bulgarian
seamen stranded in Lerwick.
Donations of food were taken to the klondiker Rotalia over the
weekend, where the 31 members of crew were spinning out the last of
their meagre supplies. On Thursday, they were down to little more than a
few carrots and onions and three cabbages.
The men are on strike over a pay dispute with the Bulgarian state
company which owns the Rotalia and Aktinia, also in Lerwick.
In a move which appears to be designed to starve the striking men into
submission, the company has refused to provide food supplies for the
Rotalia.
However, the crew is determined to remain in Shetland until wages,
some dating back more than three years, have been paid. The seamen fear
that if they return to Bulgaria they will have no chance to claim what
is owed to them.
After hearing that the men were running out of food, the Shetland Aid
Trust organised donations of vegetables and medical supplies.
Crates of oranges and apples, plus boxes of bread, pies, cakes, and
other assorted groceries, were taken to the vessel.
The Lerwick Fishermen's Mission has also provided toiletries and
vitamins, as well as collecting other food parcels and gifts.
A benevolent fund has also been set up by Shetland Trades Council.

MAJOR players in securing the restoration of the Maid of the Loch on
Loch Lomond, including Dunbartonshire Enterprise, could be about to
leave the steamer up the creek without a paddle.
A report by consultants L&amp;R Leisure, of Edinburgh, has recommended
that the ship, the last paddle steamer to be built in Britain, should be
saved as a ''flagship'' attraction on Loch Lomond at a cost of more than
#2m.
Dumbarton District Council, which bought the Maid in 1992 for #55,000,
agreed earlier this month on a vote of 11-5 to set up a trust fund to
take over ownership of the Maid from the council and seek funding for
her restoration.
However, there were signs yesterday that major players in the Save the
Maid campaign are moving towards the financial lifeboats. Mr Donald
MacInnes, chief executive of Dunbartonshire Enterprise, said that
although they were looking for a ''flagship project'' for tourism on the
Bonnie Banks, the renovation of the Loch Lomond paddler may not be it.
He said: ''I remain to be convinced that it would be right for us to
subsidise the Maid. Our board will be discussing what happens next.''
The LEC's doubts appear to have arisen following a report commissioned
by existing passenger cruise boat operators on the loch. They claim the
Maid will cost #2m -- twice the original estimate -- to repair and that
if she sails again she will put them out of business.
In fact, the consultants' report, which has been in the possession of
The Herald for some time, has always put the overall cost of
restoration, including re-boilering and shore works, at more than #2.2m.
Most of the money, it is thought, would come from the European
Regional Development Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund though Dumbarton
District Council would be expected to part with #250,000, Dunbartonshire
Enterprise #100,000, and other tourist bodies #150,000. A public appeal
and sponsorship would have a target of #250,000.
Strathclyde Regional Council has joined Dunbartonshire Enterprise in
expressing reservations about rescuing the 42-year-old former CalMac
steamer, which has been tied up at Balloch Pier since 1981.
Loch Lomond, Stirling and Trossachs Tourist Board also appears to be
having reservations. Its chairman, Councillor Billy Petrie, said he
approved of setting up a trust which will pick up the Maid's
#50,000-a-year security bill but added: ''I think we need to have
another look at this.'' The Scottish Tourist Board and Scottish
Enterprise, who both contributed to the cost of the consultants' study
into the Maid's future, have still to commit themselves financially.
Even Dumbarton District Council has so for not committed any specific
sum of money.
However, Dumbarton Provost Patrick O'Neill, who leads the Save the
Maid campaign, said: ''We must take a bold step forward and make a
decision to ensure a valuable part of our heritage.''
The council's Tory leader, Councillor Bill Morrison, has urged
organisations contemplating putting public into the Maid to bale out
now. He said: ''The Maid's past her sell-by date. It's time to look for
something new to attract visitors to Loch Lomond.''

The O J Simpson trial
starts today, with
prosecuting attorney
Marcia Clark seeking a
conviction for double
murder. But already her
methods have angered
many women lawyers, as
Ros Davidson reports
TESTIMONY in America's trial of the century starts today, but already
controversy surrounds the lead prosecuting attorney Marcia Clark. Clark,
the once hard-edged assistant district attorney in charge of trying
former football star O J Simpson for alleged double murder, is said to
have softened her appearance to appeal to potential jurors and the
media.
Her hair has been shorn, and she now favours demure instead of
figure-flattering suits, pastel shades, and more jewellery.
Gone are the former dancer's high heels, mini-skirts, lower necklines,
and Lycra. Instead she is buttoned up to the neck, at times smiling,
giggling, and talking more gently than before in the Los Angeles
courtroom.
She also held an impromptu press conference about the impact of her
celebrity on her children. And at another point Clark, described by a
colleague as ''eating nails for breakfast'', asked a potential juror if
she preferred trendy or practical shoes.
Her ''feminised'' image angers many women lawyers, although they say
it is understandable and necessary to win in a courtroom. For although
one-quarter of America's lawyers are now female, women lawyers say the
courts and juries remain sexist.
Clark's transformation over the past few months, has been seen as
especially ironic because of the gender and discrimination issues
involved in the case.
Simpson is accused of stabbing to death his ex-wife Nicole Brown and
her friend Ron Goldman this June in Los Angeles. Simpson denies the
charges, but faces life in prison if convicted.
The former athlete and TV star is known to have a history of
physically abusing Nicole, the mother of two of his children.
Prosecutors will argue he murdered her in a jealous rage, as she had
divorced him and was dating other men, and that he had encountered
Goldman unexpectedly.
''Clark is in the business of prosecuting murderers and the notion
that she has to do it wearing pink is a stunning indictment of how far
we've come in terms of equal rights,'' says Susan Estrich, a University
of Southern California law professor who worked in the Jimmy Carter
administration. ''Maybe they're right and it's a wise strategy. I can
even understand why she did it. But I find it really offensive.''
Some female lawyers, however, contend that Clark's new demeanour will
not work.
''It's a mistake for a trial attorney,'' says Karen Snell, who
successfully defended IRA fugitive Jimmy Smyth against deportation to
Britain. ''Jurors are excellent detectors of truth and falsity,'' she
says. ''The most important thing a female lawyer can do, or any lawyer
for that matter, is to find her own voice.''
Pre-trial hearings -- currently on whether to admit evidence of
Simpson's alleged batterings of Nicole -- are expected to continue for
some weeks. Opening arguments have yet to start, but jurors were
sequestered in a secret location earlier this week.
Clark, 41, was chosen as lead prosecutor for her tough-talking
reputation and successful conviction of actress Rebecca Schaefer's
murderer. Her court style is brash and sometimes aloof.
But as media attention in the Simpson trial crescendoed, trial
consultants advised Clark to undergo an image change. Too many people
questioned, both men and women, thought she was hard and unsympathetic.
In the US, extensive media coverage of trials can influence potential
and actual jurors, while special consultants may be hired to gauge
likely success during trial.
Consultants' so-called ''focus groups'' are chosen to be similar to
likely real jurors -- and in the Simpson case, they disliked the old
Marcia Clark. She was seen as cold and too smart and determined. In TV
terms, she was Joyce Hill Street Blues Davenport, not Anne LA Law
Kelsey.
''I think the public is comfortable with women lawyers being tough,
but not with them appearing tough,'' says Gloria Allred, a prominent
feminist attorney in Los Angeles.
''She's not going to a tea party after all. She's going to a double
murder trial. But she also has to do what she thinks is best to win a
conviction,'' says Allred.
There is a double standard, say many women lawyers. Clark's appearance
is scrutinised while that of her male contenders is not; a woman is
aggressive, while a man is assertive. When defence lawyer Robert Shapiro
was pictured bare-chested in People Magazine, no-one suggested it would
hurt his client's case.
''The last thing Marcia Clark wants to do is blaze a trail at the
people's expense,'' notes Blair Bernholz, a female Los Angeles defence
attorney. ''Of course the bigger message is that it's not acceptable to
have a rigid, hard-charging, sometimes overly aggressive female
prosecutor, whereas it is perfectly acceptable in a man,'' she says.
''An aggressive woman lawyer is potentially seen as a monster, some
sort of devouring creature,'' adds Nanci Clarance, a defence lawyer
since 1987. Indeed, Clarance was criticised during a high-publicity
trial as too rough during cross-examination.
Even so, she is one of a number who do not believe Clark's changes
will be effective. ''My sense of Marcia is that she eats nails for
breakfast,'' she says. ''If the make-over smells insincere, it'll be a
disaster.''
Yet in media-minded Los Angeles, image does matter.
Janett Shaw, head of Women Prosecutors of California, concedes Clark
had to do something given the criticism. But she insists the system is
still one of justice. ''The bottom line is, this woman is preparing for
the most famous case in the country.
And it's not going to be won or lost on the basis of her appearance.''
The only non-petite thing about the Marcia Clark of old was her legal
mind. It's now being said of the new Marcia Clark that she's the little
lawyer in soft focus who can send O J Simpson to prison for life.
My sense of Marcia is that she eats nails for breakfast. If the
make-over smells insincere, it'll be a disaster

LEADERS from a Scottish parliament could head British delegations to
the European Council of Ministers on appropriate subjects, with an
autonomous status similar to federal German states, Labour claimed
yesterday.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, said that under
Labour's plans Scots would have the ability to forge their own
relationship with Europe without going through Westminster.
He also gave warning that, in the event of deliberate time-wasting
being used as a tactic to block future Bills creating a Scottish
parliament and Welsh assembly, a Labour government would not hesitate to
use the guillotine to ensure it kept its promise of legislating within a
year.
Speaking on BBC2's Scottish Lobby yesterday, Mr Robertson said
Scotland's relationship with Europe was not always going to be through
Westminster, and he cited the German lander.
He said: ''If the state parliaments in Germany have a matter being
discussed in Brussels that relates to them, they have the right to be
not only in the Council of Ministers but now to be represented in the
Committee of Permanent Representatives, where a lot of the decisions are
taken.
''We see our Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly being in
precisely that relationship that exists now with Germany, and that is
increasingly going to be with Spain and elsewhere.''
He added: ''We see a strong Scottish representation office in
Brussels, the development of access to the Council of Ministers with the
British delegations -- or, in some instances, perhaps leading the
British delegations where our affairs are being considered -- as the way
in which this would develop.''
Mr Robertson insisted that Labour was determined that Home Rule Bills
for Scotland and Wales would go through in the first year of a Labour
government.
He also described the imposition of Conservative rule against the wish
of Scottish people as a far greater anomaly than the West Lothian
Question, which he dismissed as a red herring. Although any long-term
constitutional settlement might look at issues such as the number of
Scots MPs at Westminster, this was not a question for the medium term.

AN inquest is expected to open today into the deaths of three men in a
collision between a car and a horse-box driven by former international
showjumper Harvey Smith.
Mr Smith was detained and questioned by police for more than four
hours after the accident on the slip road at the junction of the A1 and
the A59 York to Harrogate road on Saturday afternoon.
He was later released on police bail for a month, pending further
inquiries.
A six-year-old boy who was a passenger in the Ford Escort car was
seriously injured, but a teenager, also in the car, escaped with minor
cuts and bruises.
The North Yorkshire Coroner, Dr Sidney Jacobs, is expected to open the
hearing in the Magistrates Courthouse, Harrogate, to hear evidence
identifying the dead before adjourning the case for further inquiries.
Assistant Divisional Fire Officer Peter Turner, who attended the
accident, said it was as bad as he had seen for a long time.
''There was no wreckage strewn across the road, but the car itself was
extremely badly damaged,'' he added.
Police named the dead as Mr Andrew Gowland, 30, the car driver, of
Swarcliffe Towers, Leeds, Mr Gary Hayton, 31, of Garforth, Leeds, and Mr
Ernest Larvin, 37, of Knaresborough, Yorkshire.
Mr Larvin's son Daniel, six, suffered serious head injuries and was
said to be in a ''critical'' condition in Leeds General Infirmary, where
his mother Christina was by his bedside last night.
College student Andrew Fulcher, 17, of Knaresborough, was discharged
from hospital after treatment for minor injuries.
Speaking later about the crash which killed three of his friends, but
left him with only a cut finger, he said: ''I must be the luckiest man
alive.''
He had been sitting in the back seat alongside Daniel. ''I dived on to
the lad to try and save him. Looking after Danny was all I could think
of.
''Suddenly there was a terrific smash and I seemed to wake up with all
the wreckage and bodies around me.
''I was all right, just helpless and dazed.
Somehow I managed to open the rear door and jump out of the car.''
''I rolled down an embankment and wandered around not knowing where I
was.
''The horse-box filled the whole road and there was nowhere for the
driver to go,'' he said.
Mr Smith was driving home from a day at Catterick Races, North
Yorkshire, where his wife Sue had entered one of her horses, Harry's
Harvest, in the Bonusprint National Hunt Flat Race at 3.40.
Mr Smith, three assistants, and the two horses in their vehicle were
uninjured.
The dead men had all been to a football match at the North Yorkshire
village of Kirk Hammerton, and were returning after the game was
cancelled.
Mr Andrew Gowland, a printer who had been on the books of Halifax Town
when they were in league football, joined Hammerton United as a
midfielder this season. He had celebrated his 30th birthday hours before
the crash.
His brother Paul, 23, said yesterday he had been looking forward to a
birthday drink and game of snooker with Andrew when police arrived with
news of the tragedy.
The players had left the clubhouse 10 minutes before the crash. The
game against Bridge FC, of Selby, had been abandoned at half-time
because of a water-logged pitch.

A BUS with football supporters on board was driven under escort to a
police station at the weekend after a disturbance in the Perthshire town
of Auchterarder.
The fans were ''shepherded on to a bus'' and driven 14 miles to be
charged before being released from custody. They are expected to face
mobbing and rioting charges at Perth Sheriff Court on Wednesday.
Police reinforcements had earlier been called in to assist the
two-strong police force in Auchterarder, after the disturbance was
reported between travelling football supporters in the town's High
Street.
A spokesman for Tayside Police in Perth confirmed yesterday that a bus
with fans on board had been escorted from Auchterarder to Perth on
Saturday evening, where police inquiries continued.
He said 41 members of the bus party had been charged. All of those
arrested are understood to have been supporting Lochee United, a junior
football club from Dundee.
A report is being submitted to the procurator-fiscal in Perth.
The fans were on their way home from a Scottish Junior Cup tie in
Glasgow when the disturbance was reported. The game against Yoker was
drawn 1-1.
The Lochee fans are reported to have spilled out of a public house
shortly after a bus of Motherwell supporters entered the town. The
Motherwell fans were on their way home from their team's Premier League
match against Dundee United.
Police reinforcements, including a traffic patrol and officers from
Crieff, are understood to have been brought in to assist the local
police force of two officers.
The disturbance is thought to have been contained in a car park and to
have been over within 30 minutes. One local man said the windows of a
minibus, hired by Motherwell fans, and two cars had been smashed.
Police reported some minor injuries although no-one needed hospital
treatment.
Strathclyde Police also confirmed yesterday that two youths from
Dundee had been charged with breach of the peace after a
missile-throwing incident at the Lochee United game.
The easy access from the A9 has made Auchterarder a popular
stopping-off place for football supporters in recent years. It is
understood that police have in the past tried to discourage groups of
travelling supporters visiting the town.
However, it is believed many of the traders are reluctant to try and
enforce a blanket ban on the supporters.

LAWYERS are expected to take action after another royal servant's
claims about the private lives of the Prince and Princess of Wales
appeared in a newspaper yesterday.
Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the relevations by Wendy
Berry, the Prince's housekeeper at his Highgrove home for nine years,
but it is thought an injunction banning further relevations, either by
newspapers or in a planned book, will be sought in the High Court as
soon as possible.
The Prince's solicitor on Friday obtained an injunction against his
valet, Ken Stronach, after the senior aide's claims about Prince Charles
and Camilla Parker Bowles appeared last weekend.
Ms Berry, who left Highgrove in 1993 when the Prince reduced staff
numbers on the Gloucestershire estate, is trying to sell a book based on
her years of royal service.
The News of the World says Ms Berry kept diaries detailing the comings
and goings at the house, planning eventually to tell all for money.
It says she claims the Princess slept at Highgrove with James Hewitt
while the Prince was away.
Charles and Mrs Parker Bowles were also watched by Ms Berry, whose
diaries describe a meeting between the two in the garden at Highgrove.

<HEADLINE>Blast fails to derail peace talks 19 die as bombers target Israeli soldiers</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE Israeli Cabinet decided last night to continue peace talks with
the PLO despite a call by President Ezer Weizman for their suspension
after an Islamic suicide bombing killed 19 people.
''The political negotiations (with the PLO) will continue. That was
accepted by everyone,'' Tourism Minister Uzi Baram told reporters after
a late-night Cabinet session.
Bloodied survivors of the attack in central Israel, and right-wing
opposition parties, demanded that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin end talks
with PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
The militant Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for the
attack, which killed 19 and wounded more than 60, mostly Israeli
soldiers.
Police used water cannon to disperse hundreds of anti-Rabin
demonstrators in Jerusalem after television pictures showed workers and
army chaplains at the scene of the blast near Tel Aviv picking body
parts off roads and trees for burial.
Rabin, in a now familiar reaction to guerrilla attacks, sealed
Israel's borders with the occupied West Bank and PLO-ruled Gaza until
further notice and vowed that ''terrorists'' would not hold peace
hostage.
Arafat, who like Rabin has staked his political future on the accord
giving Palestinians self-rule, condemned the bombing.
US President Bill Clinton said: ''Once again, the enemies of peace
have struck down innocent people in an evil effort to destroy the hopes
of peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Arabs.''
Islamic Jihad, in a statement faxed to international news agencies,
said two of its suicide bombers -- both from the Gaza Strip -- carried
out the attack at a busy junction near the Mediterranean resort of
Netanya.
The claim that the guerrillas came from Gaza put more pressure on
Rabin to rethink the already fragile peace process with Arafat, who is
responsible for security in Gaza.
President Ezer Weizman, whose post is largely ceremonial, told Israel
Television: ''I believe we should now suspend the talks -- not stop
them, but suspend them -- and tell him (Arafat): 'Make a bigger effort'
(to stop guerrilla attacks).''
Police said at least 19 people were killed by two explosions several
minutes apart at a snack bar near a bus station where dozens of soldiers
waited for buses or to hitch rides to their West Bank bases after the
Jewish Sabbath.
''The snack bar was blown apart by the first explosion. Soldiers at
the hitch-hiking station then ran towards it to help the wounded.
Shortly after that there was another explosion,'' said a witness, Kobi
Marciano.
''The Islamic Jihad forces announce their responsibility for the two
suicide attacks at the Beit Lid intersection,'' the group said in its
statement.
It named the bombers as Anwar Sukkar, 25, from Gaza City, and Salah
Shakir, 25, from the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah.
Police chief Assaf Hefetz said the body of one guerrilla had been
recovered. Israel Army Radio reported investigators were checking
whether a second bomber was involved.
It was the bloodiest attack in Israel since a suicide bomber from
Hamas, another militant Islamic group opposed to the Israel-PLO deal,
blew up 22 people in Tel Aviv last October. That bomber was from the
still-occupied West Bank, and showed how difficult it is for Israel to
counter the new Islamic militant tactic of suicide bombings.
At least 110 Israelis and 195 Palestinians have been killed since the
September 1993 Israel-PLO deal.
The Cabinet, meeting in emergency session, sealed off the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, a move which Palestinians who depend on work in Israel
view as collective punishment.
But Rabin, whose opinion poll ratings have dipped below those of
opposition Likud party leader Benjamin Netanyahu, needs to show Israelis
he can ensure security while striving for peace.
Rabin broke off a crucial Cabinet meeting discussing the growth in
Jewish settlement building around disputed Jerusalem to go by helicopter
to Netanya. There, protesters chanting ''Rabin the traitor'' and ''Death
to Arabs'' demonstrated against his handling of security.

THE man cleared of murdering a woman in front of her son on Wimbledon
Common, Mr Colin Stagg, and his girlfriend were last night charged with
affray, assault, and possessing offensive weapons.
The charges followed an incident yesterday on the London common where
a father and his 11-year-old son were allegedly threatened with an axe.
Mr Stagg was released from the Old Bailey last September after a Judge
criticised the police for using psychological profiling. He was on trial
for the murder of 23-year-old Ms Rachel Nickell.
Mr Stagg, 31, of Roehampton, south-west London, was charged with
possessing an axe and his girlfriend, Ms Diane Beddoes, 26, of the same
address, with possessing a cosh. She was released on bail but Mr Stagg
was remanded.

ROSE Kennedy, matriarch of America's most famous political family,
died yesterday at her home in Hyannisport, Massachusetts, at the age of
104, a spokeswoman for the family said.
The cause of death was complications from pneumonia.
Mrs Kennedy's only surviving son Edward, the Democratic senator from
Massachusetts, and several other family members were at her side when
she died, a source close to the family said.
Four of Mrs Kennedy's nine children died violently. Her eldest son,
Joseph, was killed in the Seond World War; daughter Kathleen died in a
1948 plane crash; President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas
in 1963, and in 1968 Senator Robert F. Kennedy was murdered in Los
Angeles.

BLACK pudding will go supersonic for the first time when British
Airways serves it on Concorde this week.
The puddings are being supplied by butchers Grants, of Dornoch, in the
Highlands.
The order has come at an opportune time. The family firm had just gone
into receivership when its secret recipe was tasted by a BA chef on
holiday in the area. He immediately ordered 700lbs of puddings to feed
passengers at twice the speed of sound.
A BA spokesman said: ''Our passengers pay #5000 to fly across the
Atlantic so they deserve the very best -- and this pudding is it.''
Sales of Scotland's other national drink will also reach new heights
after BA responded to customers' demands.
Passengers using domestic flights had been disappointed to find the
in-flight drinks trolley did not stock Irn Bru.
Now BA has prompted the drink's makers, Barr's, to produce the smaller
cans which are served in-flight.
The drink has proved so popular that BA has also brought it on to its
new transatlantic Glasgow to New York and Boston route, raising hopes
that Irn Bru will take off in the US.
A spokeswoman for Barr's said: ''We are very pleased to be able to
achieve this order. America is a very difficult market to break into and
hopefully this can help our export drive.''
Even without the introduction of black pudding and Irn Bru, BA's
ticket sales have soared by 40% since New Year after cutting prices in a
''January sale''.
While the price war among travel agents has not taken off -- bookings
are down by up to 35% -- the airline's World Offers have soared.
The promotion saw fares on up to 200 routes, including domestic,
Europe, and worldwide, cut by up to #450.
BA first tried the scheme last March and has introduced it during
quieter booking periods since then with over half a million sales.
However, the rush in the first two weeks of the year has been the
biggest and represents an increase of 40% of similar routes last year.
The offer has been so successful that the airline is extending it on
80 routes, including Paris, Tampa, Barcelona, and Bermuda.
A spokeswoman said: ''Considering the latest wave of World Offers had
to be booked between December 30 and January 18 the response has been
amazing. It shows the rise of the independent holidaymaker -- those
willing to tailor-make their own vacations.''
The extended fares are on sale until February 8. Most flights have to
be taken before the end of March.

A COMPREHENSIVE inquiry into the possible abuse of EU aid to Scotland
in the privatisation of Clydeport and four new towns was launched
yesterday by Mr Bruce Millan, former Labour Scottish Secretary, on his
last day as European Commissioner for regional policy.
At the same time, he ordered inquiries into how EU structural funding
was used in sell-offs involving Belfast Port and Belfast Airport.
Under Commission rules, it is forbidden to use structural funding
simply for fattening up state-owned assets ahead of privatisation. In
the event of a resale of assets, repayment of all or part of an EU grant
can be required.
The four new towns under investigation and whose property is to be
privatised are East Kilbride -- the first new town in Scotland and the
most successful -- Cumbernauld, Livingston, and Glenrothes.
In a statement from Mr Millan's office, the Commission said it was
seeking from all member states information on all cases of privatisation
of assets supported by the EU's structural funds. The statement made it
clear the investigation would cover a period going back several years.
A succession of Labour MPs and Euro-MPs have queried the Government's
treatment of European aid in recent times. Mr Alex Smith, South of
Scotland Euro-MP, was assured formally by Mr Millan two years ago that
the Government could not dispose of new town assets without reference to
the issue of repayment of European aid.
Mr Smith had protested at the possibility of proceeds from state
sell-offs in the Scottish new towns going to the Treasury when they had
been assisted by European structural funding.
Mr Millan said then that the Scottish Office had been told that
details of proposed disposals ''should be notified to the Commission at
an early stage so that the question of repayment can be considered''. He
made it clear that the Scottish Office was being watched by Brussels in
this respect.
Mr Ken Collins, Euro-MP for Strathclyde East, whose constituency
includes East Kilbride and Cumbernauld, and Mr Hugh McMahon, Strathclyde
West, also have demanded inquiries about EU structural fund spending in
new towns.
They were supported by Mr Tony Worthington, Labour MP for Clydebank
and Milngavie, who is a long-time critic of recently-privatised
Clydeport and who said it would be wrong for anyone to make a killing
with the help of Brussels aid.
Four directors of Clydeport reportedly stand to become millionaires
through privatisation, a fact which prompted Mr McMahon to call last
year for an investigation. He claimed the EU had awarded Clydeport
#3.14m in grants.
The Scottish Office wants the new towns' assets sold off by the end of
next year.

CLASSMATES could hold vital clues about the killer of schoolgirl
Claire Hood, police said last night.
Detectives in Cardiff are interviewing 15-year-old Claire's friends at
Rumney High School, Cardiff, in a bid to discover how she spent the last
24 hours before she was murdered as she walked to school.
Police patrols were stepped up on the large St Mellons housing estate
close to the wood where the teenager's half-naked body was discovered on
Thursday morning.
Her school uniform was strewn around after what police believe was a
sexually motivated attack.
A Home Office pathologist has yet to establish the exact cause of
death but police said injuries to Claire's head, jaw, and neck suggested
a violent struggle in which the fair-haired girl may have fought her
attacker.
Detective Superintendent Colin Jones, who is leading the hunt, said he
had not ruled out a link with an assault on a 13-year-old girl from the
same school at about 4pm on Wednesday.
The girl, whose parents requested she should not be named, last night
described how she was confronted by a strange man near Newport Road,
about half a mile from where Claire was found.
She said: ''He didn't say anything but I saw a piece of wood swinging
through the air towards my head. He gave me quite a whack and I felt
sick and dizzy.
''His hand came around the side of my head as if to put it over my
mouth to stop me screaming. But I must have struggled.
''All I could do then was scream and scream. I remember shouting for
help as the man ran off.''
The girl is helping police build a picture of the man, whom she said
was watching her at a bus stop a day before the attack.
