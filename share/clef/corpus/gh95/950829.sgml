OVER the summer The Herald has been highlighting questionable
practices in appointing senior staff to the new single-tier councils.
What is your opinion -- or do you always have to say The Herald is
right?
No, I don't always have to say that but on this issue I certainly
agree with The Herald's line.
The most publicised case is that of the appointment without interview
of Mrs Liz Reid, Lothian's director of education, to the post of
director with the new Edinburgh council. By repute she has done a
first-class job and would have been a clear favourite for the Edinburgh
post, but to appoint her without interview was inexcusable.
This was not a case of a simple transfer. Though Mrs Reid is moving
from a larger to a smaller authority, she was applying for a
newly-created post with its own contract, salary and conditions of
service. Such a method of appointment has no place in the open arena of
local government.
It also shows a distinct lack of consideration for the other
candidates, who applied in good faith and who in some cases would have
gained valuable benefit from the experience of a high-level interview
and from being able to use their success in reaching the short leet in
future CVs.
The Staff Commission, which has been overseeing the process
nationally, had not issued strict enough guidelines to prevent what
happened in Edinburgh but that is no justification. Senior councillors
know full well the sensitivities of appointment procedures and the need
to be seen to do what is right. The councillors concerned may not have
been held to account this time but you can be sure they will not do the
same again.
It was equally unacceptable that there were cases where councillors
who had agreed to act as referees for candidates then served on the
interviewing panels. They may argue that they had not yet been nominated
to the panels at they time when they were asked to stand as referees but
that argument holds little water. They may genuinely feel that they
could still take a dispassionate view but, in the eyes of other
applicants and outside observers, they had placed themselves in a
compromised position and should not have allowed this to happen.
I HAD hoped that my daughter would be able to take the new Higher
Still courses when she enters fifth year in August 1997. Is the year's
delay which Michael Forsyth has announced bad news for her?
It may not be. The rationale behind Higher Still is that it is
intended to create ''opportunities for all''. For example, by offering
Higher courses in modular form, it can ensure that pupils gain formal
credit for each unit they achieve. Likewise, the new Advanced Highers --
which will replace the Certificate of Sixth Year Studies -- are seen as
having the potential to attain wider uptake and credibility and to serve
as a more natural bridge between school and higher education.
The delay could therefore be unfortunate in particular for those
pupils of your daughter's age who may struggle to achieve full Highers.
On the other hand, it is now clear that the process of introducing the
new courses in 1997 was going to involve a precipitate rush and that
would not have been good news for your daughter's ''guinea-pig'' year
group.
The Higher Still reforms have been described as urgent. If they are
urgent now, they were urgent many years ago. I tend to the view that the
present Highers system, whatever its deficiencies, largely enjoys the
confidence of parents, employers and the higher education sector and
should only be discarded when a demonstrably better arrangement is fully
ready to be put in place.
WHY are the teacher unions making such a fuss over class sizes? To
parents like me there seem better ways of spending educational money.
The main argument, it seems to me, is that the class-size agreement
was drawn up over 20 years ago and since then classroom teaching has
undergone a revolution. The days of ''chalk-and-talk'' are largely gone
and in their place is an emphasis on group and individual teaching.
''Differentiation'' -- the process by which the particular needs of each
child are catered for -- is not only the in-term but the in-practice and
rightly so.
However, the downside of these highly desirable developments -- whose
sole purpose is to benefit the pupil -- is that they add considerably to
the burdens of the teacher. Large classes are manageable when you are
lecturing to a whole class and then overseeing them as they all carry
out the same tasks. The more complex the class organisation becomes, the
less attention can be devoted to the needs of each child.
I can't really say whether class sizes should be the number one
priority for spending at the moment. Teachers themselves will hold
differing opinions on this, though I have no doubt that the unions are
accurately reflecting a view widely held within the profession. They are
probably also reacting to ominous signs south of the Border.
In England and Wales, where unlike Scotland, there is no national
agreement on maximum class sizes pupil numbers will rise by 150,000 this
session, yet it looks as if schools will employ 4500 fewer teachers.
This situation arises from the Government's refusal to fund this year's
2.7% salary rise for teachers. According to a study commissioned by the
National Governors' Council, the result will be that more than 40% of
primary pupils will be in classes of more than 30 within a year if extra
money is not found.
Extra money for smaller classes is a proposition unlikely to attract
the sympathy of the Government at the moment, which helps to explain why
the Educational Institute of Scotland has decided that its class-size
campaign will be an extended one, without recourse to industrial action,
in the run-up to the next General Election.

<TEXT>
HIGHLAND Grain, the specialist malting barley co-operative, has become
the first business in Scotland to offer maltsters dried bulk supplies
drawn exclusively from farms registered under the Scottish Quality
Cereals assurance scheme.
Alan Whiteford, chairman of Highland Grain, said his board had made a
commitment to the scheme at a very early stage and had sought to assure
its members that, as professional malting barley growers, they had much
to gain from it.
The co-operative has 62 farmer-members based in Ross-shire,
Inverness-shire, Morayshire, Caithness and Sutherland. It has a dryer
and store at Tore on the Black Isle, where it processes up to 17,000
tonnes of malting barley a year.
A Scottish Agricultural College study on the financial outcomes from
Scottish cereals during the 1993 crop year shows that winter barley
proved to be the most profitable at #361 a hectare net margin. This was
followed by winter wheat at #297, with spring barley bringing up the
rear at #239.

Blackburn 1, Man Utd 2
BLACKBURN Rovers knew it would not be easy defending their Premiership
title, but were not expecting this. Last night's home defeat by the team
they snatched the championship from in May was their third in succession
and confirmed that they are not functioning in any department as
effectively as last season.
As ever, when these sides meet, there was an edge to the game, and
United's Roy Keane was sent off after receiving two of the eight yellow
cards issued by referee David Elleray -- his second for diving over
Colin Hendry's leg in the penalty area.
United deserved Lee Sharpe's opening goal just after half-time and
Alan Shearer's equaliser on the hour was Blackburn's first shot on
target. It was one of the four youngsters in the visiting team, David
Beckham, who curled in the winner seven minutes later.
Concentrating in the early stages on taking some of the ferocious pace
out of the game, United required almost 20 minutes before registering a
threat, but should have scored from it. Cole wriggled round goalkeeper
Flowers, only for Hendry to recover and slide the ball off the line.
Blackburn could not complain at falling behind only 30 seconds into
the second half. Flowers beat the ball away three times in a scramble
before Sharpe finally knocked it back past him.
Shearer drove in a half-volley following a corner, but Beckham's
sweeping shot as he turned was a worthy winning goal. United held on to
extend a run in contrast to that of the champions -- three successive
wins.

THE match of the day at Flushing Meadow yesterday ended with a scream
and Japan's Shuzo Matsuoka crumpled on the hard court, overcome by
severe cramps in both legs.
He and Czech Petr Korda were locked in a titanic struggle that had
gone three tie-breaks in the first three sets and was headed for a
fourth when the Japanese player collapsed with screams of pain.
The 27-year-old Matsuoka, who led 6-7, 7-6, 7-6, 5-6 after three hours
and 26 minutes of full-speed action, lay in a heap screaming for several
minutes -- unable to be helped, according to the rules, and physically
unable to call for help.
Finally, first aid arrived. Matsuoka left under his own power and
Korda, the 1992 French Open finalist, advanced to the second round.
''Many times when I had to bend low, I started feeling it and it was
scary, but this is the US Open. I had to keep going,'' said Matsuoka,
who took Pete Sampras to four sets in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon.
Players are not allowed to be helped when they cramp, as the injury is
seen as a by-product of conditioning. Matsuoka wanted assistance but
could not speak through his pain, and courtside officials would not help
him at first for fear of causing his disqualification.
Korda watched helplessly. ''If you are cramping, no-one can help you.
Otherwise, I would get some penalty points because I cannot cross the
net,'' he said. ''No-one could help him at that point unless he could
help himself, which I feel is very crazy, a crazy rule.''
Former champion Stefan Edberg celebrated his fiftieth consecutive
grand-slam tournament by crushing Czech Martin Damm. The 29-year-old
Edberg is unseeded in New York for the first time in 11 years, but the
Swede charged into the second round 6-0, 6-3, 7-6 in just under two
hours.
Britain's top-ranked player Greg Rusedski lost 7-6, 6-3, 6-7, 6-1 to
Joost Winnink, of Holland, and refused to blame his defeat on a mild
dose of food poisoning. Jeremy Bates went down 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 to Emilio
Sanchez, of Spain. With Mark Petchey also beaten, Tim Henman, who beat
Juan Albert Viloca (Spain) 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 is Britain's sole survivor
in the singles.
Other singles results included (* denotes seed):
Men: 4* Boris Becker (Germany) beat Alex Lopez Moron (Spain) 6-1, 6-0,
6-3; Jerome Golmard (France) beat 10* Wayne Ferreira (S Africa) 7-5, 7-6
(7-5), 6-1; Marcos Ondruska (S Africa) beat Mark Petchey (Britain) 7-6

Women: Martina Hingis (Switzerland) beat Nancy Feber (Belgium) 6-2,

THE driving of Michael Schumacher will be under intense scrutiny for
the remainder of the Formula One season following the one-race suspended
ban he was handed aftre winning the Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday.
The ban will not come into effect unless the world champion commits
further driving offences at any of the next four races.
Schumacher had been harshly criticised by the Williams team and Damon
Hill for his irregular, defensive driving. The Williams team lodged a
protest which was upheld by the race stewards.
Benetton immediately lodged an appeal, setting up another Paris
hearing of the International Motoring Federation, the sport's governing
body, to decide Schumacher's fate.
He now faces a challenge to clear his name before the Italian Grand
Prix at Monza on September 10 when he is certain to receive a warm
reception because he is joining Ferrari next year.
It has also been suggested that David Coulthard, now with Williams, is
favourite for a seat with McLaren alongside Mika Hakkinen. It could be,
if hints from McLaren's boss Ron Dennis are accurate, that he is
considering signing Coulthard to be part of a three-car team next year,
with Alain Prost possibly making a return.
Meanwhile, Hill has only six races left to wipe out Schumacher's 15
point lead. But Schumacher is unlikely to be fazed by the threat of a
one-race ban. Having come close to losing the title last year after
sitting out two races through disqualification, the 26-year-old will not
risk wrecking his championship hopes again.
Schumacher knows he has gained the upper hand and that victory at the
Italian Grand Prix a week on Sunday could virtually seal the title,
especially if Hill fails to add to his points tally there.

AS A conclusion to a series which remained vibrant to the final day
and in which the performances of both sides excelled at different
stages, a draw was, perhaps, the fairest outcome.
The stalemate reached at the end of the sixth Test at The Oval
yesterday was not entirely unexpected and, once again, as in previous
Tests of this remarkable series, there were achievements of the highest
order.
Appropriately, it was the England captain Mike Atherton who played the
most important role on the last day to force a draw.
His innings, just five short of a sixth Test century, must merit a
place among the best in terms of sheer resolve and pluck. His batting
effort in the entire series brought him England's player-of-the-series
award adjudicated by the West Indies manager, Wesley Hall.
His statement paid high tribute to the England captain: ''Mike
Atherton provided the defining difference to the result of the series
both by his highly accomplished batting and his astute captaincy.
''In his batting he led his team from the front, breaking the fire of
the West Indian pace bowlers unflinchingly. For me, the real test for
any player -- or captain -- comes when he is under pressure. Atherton's
perennial unflappability, his seemingly good humour, and his quiet
dignity were key ingredients not only in holding his team together, but
also in fostering a spirit of conviviality which prevailed between the
teams.''
Atherton modestly said: ''I am pleased with our performance, but
disappointed we couldn't get the upper hand in the last two Tests.''
Brian Lara's extraordinary innings of 179 from 206 balls in this Test
had transformed the match and put the West Indies in a commanding
position, bringing him the match award and the West Indies's
Man-of-the-Series award, but from England's point of view Atherton's
display yesterday was of vital importance.
It was exemplary in terms of single-mindedness for his team. He knew
he had to occupy the crease and that he did for nearly six hours, during
which he faced 269 balls in scoring 95. He was finally dismissed,
glancing Bishop and being snapped up by a diving wicketkeeper.
For the Windies, it was imperative to get an early breakthrough when
play began yesterday with England's score 39 without loss. They needed
199 more to make the tourists bat again and certainly the pressure was
on them with six hours of play ahead.
Atherton and Jason Gallian faced 12 overs, scoring 21, before Curtly
Ambrose found a way in by having Gallian edge the ball to Williams at
third slip. There wasn't any significant ball movement, but Gallian
failed to get behind the line and got a thick edge.
Ambrose, who has bowled with renewed vigour in this match after
resting from the previous Test, struck again four overs later. This time
he removed John Crawley through a catch behind the stumps. Again it was
a poor shot, Crawley played from the crease and simply dropped his bat
to the ball.
England were 64 for two after an hour's play and with 75 overs
remaining for the day at that stage, it had begun to look a little grim
for them. It also had given great encouragement to the West Indian
bowlers and made the task for the remaining England batsmen more
difficult.
Graham Thorpe, whose 74 was a substantial contribution in England's
first innings, joined Atherton and the two proceeded to repair the early
dent created by the pace of Ambrose.
When the left-handed Thorpe departed after a 68-run partnership with
his skipper, he had become the only England batsman to score more than
500 runs in a series between the countries in a rivalry which began as
far back as 1928.
Atherton was unperturbed and soon settled into another lengthy
partnership, with Graeme Hick. They added 80 for the fourth wicket.
After the England captain's departure, Hick went on to a patient,
unbeaten 51 in just under three hours, his second half-century of the
Test following the brilliant 96 from the first innings.

SCOTLAND'S two boats competing in the 220-mile four-stage Teacher's
Round Britain Challenge maintained their unbeaten record on the start
line of each leg to date.
Glendronach, skippered by Jon Fitzgerald, and Lord Inverforth,
skippered by Paul Jeffes with sailmaker Chris Owen steering for the
departure from Rothesay, lead the 10-boat, five nations-fleet away on
the 740-mile third leg to Hartlepool.
Jeffes was quickly engaged in a tussle with Irish race leader David
Harte in Dream of Erin, but both Scottish flagged boats had the Welsh
team -- who lead them, and the overall standings by two points --
comfortably behind.
* RACING on the second day of the Brut British Olympic Trials at
Weymouth was postponed until mid-afternoon. To simulate wind strengths
most likely next year in Savannah, selectors have set a ceiling of 15
knots at the start of each race. It was a better day for the Scots.

ABOUT 10% of people forced to sleep on the streets of London are
Scots, a charity claimed yesterday.
Borderline, set up in 1990 by the Church of Scotland London Advisory
Service in response to the growing number of Scots sleeping rough in the
capital, also claimed in its annual report that it was dealing with
three times more people now than in 1991.
Labour and the charity Shelter Scotland expressed ''great concern'' at
the figures while calling for action to reverse the trend.
The Scottish Office, meanwhile, claimed that most of the 300 or so
people sleeping rough on the streets of central London in any one night
were locals, although it recognised the good work done by Borderline,
which received #36,000 of Government funding in the past year.
The charity said it helped more than 700 homeless Scots in the past
year -- most of those in the 21-40 age group. Teenagers were now the
smallest group assisted, accounting for 2.8%, while 17.8% were older
than 40.
Of the 700, 29.8% received help with accommodation, 29.2% returned
home, and 26.5% were given other forms of assistance.
The largest group of homeless Scots -- 54% -- were from Strathclyde,
while 10.7% were from Lothian.
Mr Gareth Davies, the charity's director, said the organisation
remained ''deeply concerned'' about the future of direct hostel
provision, especially for those aged over 25.
Mr Tommy Sheppard, assistant general secretary of the Scottish Labour
Party, said the charity's survey underlined the shocking results of the
Government's housing and economic policies.
Mrs Tricia Benzie of Shelter Scotland said: ''Up until now, the most
anecdotal reasons for the influx of Scots to London has been the
attraction of the bright lights and the lack of opportunities north of
the Border.
''We have asked young people in London the reasons why they go there.
Once we have had a chance to analyse our research, we may be able to
address the problem in a more practical fashion.''

BERNARD Gallacher yesterday stepped gingerly out of the awkward corner
into which administrative ineptness had painted him when he confirmed
Nick Faldo and nominated Jose Maria Olazabal to complete the European
Ryder Cup team to meet the United States from September 22 to 24 at Oak
Hill, Rochester, New York. But the captain's footprints will surely lead
towards changing, yet again, the method of selection.
Despite Faldo's impoverished form, especially in the four majors since
he won at Doral in March, the presence of the world No.3 was never in
doubt. Who, anyway, would have had the nerve to omit him? But in
deciding to make the Spaniard twelfth man, given the obvious discomfort
his injured right foot continues to give him, Gallacher has made himself
a hostage to fortune.
Gallacher justified his decision thus: ''I picked Jose on his form of
the last three weeks. I know he probably won't be able to play twice a
day (in the foursomes and fourball games), but in three weeks' time the
injury may be better and certainly his partnership with Seve (only two
defeats in 15 outings) had a bearing on my choice.
''Jose is having this week off before he plays in the Lancome
tournament,'' Gallacher continued, ''and if his condition deterioriates
then we will discuss the possibility of replacing him.''
Gallacher's gamble may or may not backfire, but in opting for a
manifestly unfit player, who has now qualified automatically only once
in five attempts, he has overlooked the experience of Ian Woosnam,
frayed as his form is, and the promise of Jesper Parnevik, the other
most-favoured candidate.
But Gallacher must accept his share of the responsibilty (along with
the Ryder Cup committee) for having reduced the wild-card option from
three to two. When, after three terms of office, Gallacher passes the
baton on, presumably to Ballesteros, those responsible will clearly have
to re-think the system.
Woosnam -- who, ironically, was last night guest of honour at a
Variety Club of Great Britain dinner -- was, however, already resigned
to his fate. ''I think there will be someone blasting down Bernard's
ear,'' he said, an unspoken reference to Seve Ballesteros. But Gallacher
responded: ''When Ian won the British Masters last season and went to
the top of the points table I didn't think there were any circumstances
in which he wouldn't make the team. Things have just not worked out.''
Two other players who were then in the first 10, Angel-Miguel Jimenez
and Pierre Fulke, also have been eliminated. On the other hand,
Ballesteros's performances late last year were so conclusive that his
subsequent falls from grace cost him only four places, from first to
fifth.
But Olazabal, unlike Woosnam, made the cut in the recent US PGA
Championship and finished sixth and ninth in the last two US Tour
events. Woosnam's putting last week was in such disarray that one day he
put two putters in his bag, one of them long-handled. But Faldo, despite
his self-inflicted tortures by technique, will equal Christy O'Connor
Sr's record of 10 appearances.
Thus Woosnam, after six successive appearances, becomes one of the
four changes from the 1993 side, beaten by two points at The Belfry. He
loses his place along with Barry Lane, Peter Baker, and Joakim Haeggman.
Philip Walton and Per-Ulrik Johansson are the new caps, and Howard
Clark, after a six-year absence, and David Gilford, after four, return
for their sixth and second matches respectively.
Experience is certainly in Europe's favour -- 49 appearances in the
match and 13 major titles compared with the United States's 15 and six.
And to Europe's modest refreshing of the ranks the American have five
newcomers in Phil Mickelson, Tom Lehman, Loren Roberts, Jeff Maggert,
and Brad Faxon. Nevertheless, the respective odds are 2-5 the hosts, 9-4
the guests.

THE Scottish Rugby Union will not be made bankrupt or held to ransom
by its international stars in the brave new world of professional rugby.
The warning was issued yesterday by SRU president Ian Todd and
International Board representative Freddie McLeod as the union responded
to the weekend announcement by the IB in Paris that the amateurism laws
are to be rescinded and that from next month the game will become open.
Todd and McLeod were irritated by reported comments by a couple of
players in the wake of the weekend announcement to the effect that it
was now up to the international squad to force the hand of the SRU to
get what they were worth.
McLeod, who, along with fellow Scottish IB representative Allan Hosie,
was a member of the IB council which reached the momentous decision to
consign amateurism to the dustbin after three days of talks in the
French capital, also underlined yesterday that international players
would not be able to capitalise on the thistle which adorns the Scotland
jersey.
''A major aspect of our work in the aftermath of the weekend's
decisions will be the retention of our intellectual property. By this I
mean that the players will not be able to exploit the logo which is the
property of the union,'' he declared.
Todd said: ''With the advent of the World Cup and the high profile of
our game in the media and TV and of large sponsorship deals it was
evident that things would have to change. With the high demands on our
players, recompense, we all agree, was inevitable. However, the radical
decisions in Paris have taken many of us by surprise.
''But let me make this absolutely clear. Those of us in Scotland will
do as we think best for the game in this country. We will not see the
union bankrupt and, more importantly, we will safeguard the clubs at all
levels from financial stress. There is no use in looking back. We have
to look forward and we should remember, too, that for the vast majority
of players this is still a recreational sport,'' he added.
The comments by McLeod and Todd surely represent the first salvoes in
what has the potential to be a period of furiously hard pounding for
both the union and the players as both bodies try to come to terms with
events of the last few days.
McLeod, who said that there would be a special meeting of the SRU soon
in light of the new regulations and that there would be a meeting, too,
with the clubs, added: ''I find it sad that certain individuals are
saying that the issue will have to be forced and that they have to find
their worth. We do not seek confrontation.
''Whatever agreement we come to will be based upon our ability to pay.
The financial situation of the union will not be placed in jeopardy and
it is essential that we continue the development of the game at all
levels.''
''There is Press comment this morning that certain players are looking
for confrontation and at this stage I find that regrettable. It was
suggested that we would be held to ransom and I find that sad. We will
be talking soon to the players and their agent to find a sensible
settlement.''
The international players' agent, former Scotland prop Ian McLauchlan,
met a number of the players prior to yesterday's Murrayfield press
conference at which he was an interested onlooker.
He declared: ''I don't think that the union can be held to ransom.
There is absolutely no point in bankrupting your employer. The players
realise that the new era isn't going to happen overnight and any that do
are in for a shock. This whole thing has to be done by mutual consent
but there is no doubt that the players have a very good grasp of what is
now available to them and that they will be able to capitalise on their
new found freedom.''
Neither the union or McLauchlan have set a target figure which the
internationals squad might expect to earn but it is likely that cotracts
will be in place before the first international match of the new season,
against Western Samoa, in November.
McLeod also indicated yesterday, although stressing that this was a
personal opinion as the union had not yet made a policy decision, that
the IB sanctioned policy of paying win bonuses might not find favour in
Scotland.
He said that even at international level this did not necessarily mean
that Scotland's players would be placed at a disadvantage and --
disregarding the fact that Scotland lost 34-10 -- he went on to suggest
that, when Scotland played the Springboks at Murrayfield last November,
the South Africans might have been on a contract which was in breach of
amateurism regulations then in place.
Scotland's 1990 Grand Slam captain David Sole, who figured in some
bruising confrontations with the SRU as the game drifted towards
professionalism, said yesterday: ''The board's decision does have a
knee-jerk quality about it, coming as it does so soon after the World
Cup and everything that has been happening with Murdoch and Packer and
so on, but it is the right decision and the main thing is that the
hypocrisy of shamateurism can now be brought to an end.
''This talk about the players holding the union to ransom is all very
negative. The players will have to work with the union to manage the new
situation as well as they can,'' he said.
'We will not see the union bankrupt, and we will safeguard clubs at
all levels from financial stress'

REACTION to the International Board's weekend decision to scrap the
amateurism laws continued to flow in from around the oval globe
yesterday writes Derek Douglas. It ranged from the euphoria of Springbok
captain Francois Pienaar to the despair of former Irish RFU president
Ken Reid.
''It's fantastic. It's what everyone wanted. It is going to enhance
rugby in that the guys can now concentrate on what they are doing
without having to divert their energies elsewhere,'' said Pienaar.
Ex-Scottish rugby union international Alan Tait, who switched codes
with Widnes from Kelso in April 1988, has not ruled out a return to his
former sport if the opportunity arises. But he said his return north
would probably be in a coaching capacity and not as a player.
''Rugby union is a lot easier game to play and now they are getting
paid, I can't see many rugby union players switching codes. Now that
players will be going full-time and will be able to train more, I can
see rugby union becoming a better game than it has been,'' he said.
John Allen, secretary of English champions Leicester, who have the
biggest gate-takings in the country with a 16,000 capacity ground, said:
''All clubs will have problems initially in paying any money.''
Richard Mawditt, chairman of cup-holders Bath, said: ''Let's not kid
ourselves that the money is there. I don't believe that our club is in
the position to pay large sums of money in players' fees.
Former IRFU president Ken Reid said: ''We expected and recognised
changes had to come, but the nature and extent of the changes are going
to cause major difficulties. In my view it will be detrimental to many
of the aspects of the game in Ireland. I am stunned the IB has gone so
far.''
Irish centre Brendan Mullin welcomed the news. He said: ''The fact is
that the game has been professional for some time now in other
countries. When we took on the All Blacks in the World Cup we were
playing a professional side.''
In New Zealand, NZRFU chairman Richie Guy said: ''All we have done is
regulate the under-the-table payments, which will now be done on top of
the table. But from a practical sense, I don't think it will make a
great deal of difference.''
In France, newly-appointed French manager Andre Herrero is ready to
resign over the decision to end amateurism. ''I suppose that I am now a
professional and if it is so, I don't want to do this job for free,'' he
said.
''It's a step forward. We shall keep our rugby union culture, but
money will be on the table, not under it'', said French captain Philippe
Saint-Andre.

Wendy Jack looks at factors that prevail in the Scottish jobs market
THOSE involved in the recruitment marketplace this summer, report a
pleasingly buoyant picture across the board.
In Glasgow, Stuart Macintyre, a director of Thomson Partners, says
that his company completed its busiest year ever, at the end of May.
''Since then,'' he continues, ''we've seen an intake of work over the
summer months at even a slightly higher level than the equivalent period
in 1994. Recently, we were working simultaneously on search assignments
to find the chief executives for each of three very well known quoted
Scottish companies.''
In terms of employing organisations' current thinking, Macintyre
responds: ''From the microcosm of our own viewpoint, I think they are
imposing even tighter parameters on the type of experience and past
achievement that they consider to be relevant and acceptable for a
particular post.
''This is not a new phenomenon, but one which continues unabated. From
the perception therefore of candidates, who are involuntarily in the
position of seeking a new job, or indeed someone who is eager to find a
fresh career challenge, I think there is a need to be increasingly aware
of the necessity to concentrate on the particular experience that you
have. It means that individuals actively wishing to do something else,
will have to reconcile themselves almost, to 'sticking to the knitting'
to some extent.''
For consultants involved in search these days, the response from those
they approach is now much more receptive to propositions which they
consider to be interesting -- which at least makes their lives a shade
easier and allows some movement to take place. Companies, says Stuart
Macintyre, continue to run very lean and will, he believes, go on doing
so. ''The continuing impact of technology, particularly in some of the
larger employers in Scotland, will I think, increase.''
Within companies these days, he sees the mood as cautious, but with an
underlying quiet confidence. On salary levels, he notes: ''Clearly they
are still moving up, but I think it's a very rare appointment now that
doesn't have a proportion of potential earnings available through
performance bonus. Previously, there would have been 10% available
through bonus, now it might be 20% or 30%.''
On the question of extra training and qualifications, Macintyre admits
to being uncertain these days that the once-magic key of an MBA now
makes a big difference to a candidate's chances. ''There's been a huge
proliferation of MBAs. It is valuable from a personal development point
of view, and for people's confidence levels about the input they're
making, but as a measurable aid to career development, I'm just not sure
it makes a big difference today. It was a feature of the seventies and
early eighties but I believe people have to be careful now about the
assumptions they make, before embarking on an MBA as a particular
business qualification.''
Search Consultancy, Scotland's largest independent recruitment agency,
with offices in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dunfermline, also reports a very
buoyant market. Managing director Andrew Pert said: ''The electronics
market, both the OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) side and the
contract side are busy. The other area which has taken a major leap is
the call centre environment -- both inbound and outbound calls -- which
can be involved in customer service, telesales, helpline desks,
telemarketing operations, and so on. It is a massive marketplace.''
Another area of changing business is called ''Back Office
Processing''. One of the major projects, again in the West of Scotland,
has been the Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage centre based in Greenock.
''It has been relatively unique,'' explained Pert. ''Because we did
all the recruitment, both temporary and permanent labour bases, from
mailroom clerks through mortgage specialists to the management team.
Eventually there will be 300 jobs spread across the two phases; by
October the first phase of about 150 will be complete.''
A particularly interesting phenomenon highlighted by Andrew Pert, is
what is called generic training. ''There's a lot of it being
undertaken,'' he explains. ''Take for example, a call centre: there are
basic skills that people should have, before they can be assessed for
suitablity for the company. The LECs are setting up generic training
courses with the training providers, as a prerequisite before the
screening process is undertaken.
''It means that unemployed people can go on to these courses, then
people like ourselves will go in and assess them through our vetting
process, to see if they are suitable to go on to a job. It prepares
people for the job market. Clients have been very pleased with the
results of that.''
Another, more contentious area of growth is in flexible resourcing.
''It's contentious because a lot of people who are on these contracts,
although it's big business, have virtually no employment rights,'' Pert
explained.
''From a positive viewpoint, it's the state of the economy which
dictates generally what happens with a flexible resource market. In a
buoyant economy, such a market doesn't really exist because people want
the staff and offer permanent jobs. However, in a recession, it at least
provides training and jobs for those who would otherwise have nothing.
When things pick up, they have a track record and will hopefully be
considered for permanent employment.''
Overall Pert notes, companies appear ''to be in expansion mode, few
are still contracting in any major way. There's still caution, but we
are definitely seeing a lot more optimism.''

EXECUTIVE recruitment has continued its rise throughout the first half
of 1995, according to the MSL Index, which has tracked the senior jobs
market quarterly since 1959, and is generally regarded as a respected
indicator of economic growth.
The Index currently stands at 102 (1959 base=100) which means it has
crossed the 100 threshold for two consecutive quarters. While down 10
points on the first quarter of 1995, it represents a rise of 16 points
on the same period last year.
Particularly encouraging is that the Moving Annual Total -- a 12-month
running total which irons out seasonal variances -- has not dropped for
10 successive quarters. The April-June quarter is the highest since the
first quarter of 1991, showing an increase of 4 points on the previous
three months, and a rise of 18 points on the equivalent period of 1994.
Within individual job categories, sales and marketing performed best
of all, with an increase of 57% over the year, although down 6% on the
quarter. Production did well also, increasing by 50% over the year, but
down 10% on the quarter, while research and development/design showed an
increase of 36% over the year, having fallen by 15% on the previous
quarter.
General management rose by 34% over the year, decreasing by 20% over
the quarter, with information technology rising by 12% over the year,
but falling by 23% over the previous quarter.
Accounting and finance fell by 8% over the year, and by 15% over the
previous quarter, while personnel similarly suffered a drop, this time
of 7% over the year, decreasing 32% over the quarter.
Most industry categories showed good increases over the year,
retailing being the most notable, up 26%. Food and drink wasn't far
behind with a rise of 24%, with energy up by 3% on the equivalent period
last year.
Ian Lloyd, managing director of the MSL Group, said: ''The latest
figures from the Index confirm our confidence in an upturn in the
executive jobs market. Although there has been a technical fall in
comparison with the first quarter of 1995, the MAT figures give us a
much more accurate and comprehensive view of the overall picture.''

Pupils are discovering the World Wide Web is a level playing field
they can get stuck into, reports Stuart Millar.
IT all started with a vulture. A culture vulture that is. As part of a
project for Glasgow's Year of Culture, Richmond Park Special School in
Glasgow sent a story about a vulture around British schools by e-mail,
and invited pupils to add to the story. Five years on, Richmond Park is
just one of the many Scottish schools benefiting from the electronic
communications revolution that is now sweeping through education.
It is impossible to open a newspaper these days without running across
yet another tale of how the Internet is set to change our lives. But,
beyond the hype, the communications boom is having a radical impact in
schools. From electronic mail to Cyberspace and the World Wide Web, new
technology is breaking down geographical barriers, promoting
collaboration between schools and aiding staff development. The result
is that the education world is indeed becoming a smaller place.
And it is special schools like Richmond Park, which teaches around 100
primary age children with a wide range of physical and intellectual
disabilities, that are reaping the most benefits. ''For children with
special needs, it's a way of accessing the normal primary classroom,''
explains Maggie Pollard, the headteacher. ''In so many other areas,
access is a problem for these children, but with things like electronic
mail, they can communicate on their own terms.''
She tells the story of a primary seven pupil who developed a
friendship through e-mail. It was not until several months later when
the friends finally met face to face that they discovered the penpal was
not another pupil, but the assistant head of a Glasgow primary school.
And this, says Ms Pollard, is the beauty of the communication
technology. ''These children have physical disabilities, but with e-mail
nobody knows that. When they type in their names they are the same as
anybody else.''
Another special needs teacher, Ivan Mykitin, from Holybrook School in
the southside of Glasgow, is also a fanatic. ''I think for the kids this
will revolutionise their education. The children's information gathering
skils have developed. They now see their whole world as information they
can develop,'' he says.
The benefits to special needs children are indeed impressive. Ms
Pollard estimates that this sort of work improves their learning
potential by as much as 50%. And it is this sort of impact that has won
over initially sceptical staff.
''It's fascinating,'' she says. ''An awful lot of the teachers are
older and were a bit apprehensive. But when they saw what it means for
our children, what it does for their writing, their improvement and
their self-esteem, that was instant feedback.''
''It's not just the pupils who benefit,'' says Anne Bruce of the
Scottish Council for Edcuational Technology, which launches its own
initiative, Contact, next month. ''Schemes such as Contact allow
teachers, who are often isolated with small classes, to network with
other special needs teachers. For example, they can pool experience of
coping with specific sorts of problems that only arise once in a
while.''
Contact is a bulletin board service which combines electronic mail and
discussion forums with access to Internet conferences on education
topics. The pilot stage which began in February was so successful that
around 200 schools are already using the scheme.
Most of the new communications initiatives are based on First Class
software, making them, as one education adviser put it, ''simplicity
itself'' to use, another major attraction for teachers. ''Anyone who can
point and click a mouse can use a system such as Contact,'' says Ms
Bruce. ''Yet we are providing a very useful and sophisticated
application. We are giving people a reason for learning about using
technology. Instead of just being technology for its own sake, it helps
you access the world.''
Rural schools too are discovering the enormous potential of electronic
communcations. In Argyll and Bute, around 80% of the schools have fewer
than two full-time teachers, and some have a roll numbering just two or
three pupils. In remote areas like this the travelling time between some
schools can be measured in days rather than hours. Now the local
education division has established its own bulletin board service,
Argyll Online, to tackle the huge problems caused by the lack of peer
contact, for both staff and pupils.
Martin Mulholland, who is responsible for information technology in
the division's schools, explains: ''In some of the schools, there is
just one pupil in primary seven, then the next level down is primary
four. But sometimes the pupil will be doing a maths project that
requires them to work with a partner or in a group. Now they can do
that.
''Similarly, if you work in a large school and something like Five to
Fourteen comes in, the burden can be shared out among the staff. In a
rural school, you'd have to do it all yourself.''
The scheme has been such a success that Argyll and Bute is already
looking beyond the basic communications technology. Thirteen schools are
now using video conferencing, allowing pupils and staff to work face to
face.
According to Mr Mulholland, the impact has been ''quite stunning,''
especially in helping the social development of pupils. ''In parts of
Argyll and Bute, the quality of life can be fantastic. But children are
often denied the opportunity to meet, interact and play with their
peers. Video conferencing and e-mail are bridging that gap,'' he says.
One area that has greatly benefited is Gaelic language teaching. Just
four teachers are responsible for teaching more than 1500 primary school
pupils in Argyll and Bute who are learning Gaelic as a second language.
The establishment of video conferencing has drastically cut their
travelling time, allowing the resource to be used more effectively.
''A lot of people want their children to learn Gaelic,'' says Mr
Mulholland. ''But if they live in places like East Kilbride, it can be
difficult for them to hear a range of voices or accents. But whack
technology on top and the isolated learners in East Kilbride can talk to
Gaelic speakers in Tiree.''
However, installing the new technology is not cheap. Leasing a
dedicated phone line from British Telecom can cost as much as #12,000 in
the first year. And even a seemingly minor consideration like the lack
of access to telephone sockets is ''a major limiting factor,'' says Bill
Connolly, adviser in educational computing for Dunbarton division.
''The brave new world of the information superhighway is arriving at
the doors of the schools. The technology is already there. But the
problem is finding finance to put in the infrastructure so schools can
use it.'' The uncertainty caused by local government reorganisation is
only adding to the confusion.
For now, Maggie Pollard remains determined that nothing will disrupt
the progress being made at Richmond Park. ''The philosophy of this
school is that the technology belongs to the children. The rule is that
every child has to use the computers everyday, no matter what.'' At the
moment, she is less worried about financial considerations than the
school's impending foray onto the World Wide Web. ''It's very
exciting,'' she enthuses.

Vouchers for pre-schooling are on the way in scotland. Alexander
McKenzie examines how the initiative compares with nursery provision
elsewhere.
'SIX is too late for the start of schooling'' reads a large notice at
the entrance of the Nishiki Early Learning Centre in Tokyo. ''Give your
children extra years of education'', the notice also goes on to state,
''and watch them flourish''.
The Nishiki is one of 100 or so early learning centres in the Japanese
capital which offer to provide children as young as one, two or three
with a head start in Japan's highly-competitive education race.
Japan is very keen on preschooling. Over 90% of the children entering
the nation's elementary schools have spent at least one year at
kindergarten or nursery school. Many have received two or three years'
preschooling and a growing number have received tuition at a
pre-kindergarten.
Japanese parents are happy to pay for a service which they say their
children enjoy and which, it is widely accepted, provides an excellent
preparation for elementary school. The #16 billion which is spent on
preschooling each year in Japan is reckoned to be the country's
shrewdest investment.
Many parents in the US are also convinced of the benefits of early
learning. Several American studies have shown that children who have
attended kindergarten often go on to settle, learn and behave better at
elementary school.
One much-publicised study concluded that pupils from disadvantaged
families who receive good preschooling fare better in employment than
children from similar backgrounds with no preschooling.
Yet it is left to parents to decide whether they want to invest in
kindergarten lessons. Although some government funds are available to
pay the kindergarten fees for children ''at risk'' most parents have to
pay full fees.
''Parents now realise what little minds are capable of,'' one American
newspaper editorial recently declared. ''Good preschooling means
learning rather than playing.''
In Australian kindergartens, however, the emphasis is still very much
on playing. Early learning, it is argued by many Australian
educationists, puts too much pressure on children and makes them nervous
about failing and risk-taking.
At the same time the increasing cost of kindergarten education is
forcing the Australian government to pass on more of the costs of
preschooling to parents. The increase in attendance fees in some
kindergartens has resulted in a sharp drop in the number of enrolments.
Many European countries, meanwhile, are taking steps to improve both
the quantity and quality of their preschool provision. In France, where
99% of three, four and five-year-olds attend nursery school, the focus
is on improving the quality of the country's early education.
Nursery schools in France, as well as those in Belgium, the
Netherlands and a number of other mainland European countries, are
increasingly being required to offer more structured courses at the
expense of playgroup-type activities.
A good model is provided by the Italian system of preschooling which
offers detailed guidelines about the sort of experiences kindergartens
should be offering their pupils.
Italy's new Orientamenti -- official guidelines -- emphasise six areas
of experience: ''body and movement, speech and words'', ''space, order
and measurement'', ''time and nature'', ''messages, forms and media''
and ''self and others''.
The intention is to provide the best possible preparation for the more
formal learning programmes which begin in the primary school. The
popularity of preschooling in Italy means that over 90% of the
six-year-olds starting primary school there will have attended nursery
school for at least one year.
In Denmark, where 76% of three-year-olds and 81% of four-year-olds
attend nursery school, improvements are being made to the training
courses for nursery school teachers. Students now have to complete a
three-and-a-half year specialised nursery school teaching programme,
covering all aspects of child development, before taking up a career in
nursery education.
The German government is seeking to expand kindergarten education by
promising, from next year, a legal guarantee of kindergarten places for
all children between the ages of three and six.
New kindergartens are being opened to meet the expected demand for
places, particularly in the western part of the country, where the
number of children attending kindergarten has traditionally been lower
than in the former Communist states of Eastern Germany.
Local education authorities, which are struggling to meet the targets
set by the German government, say the quality of preschool places is as
important as the quantity, and that there is a danger that the urgency
of the government's reforms will force class-sizes upwards and the
quality of preschool education will suffer.
In Britain, where more three and four-year-olds are enrolled in
playgroups than in nursery schools, the Government is also looking at
ways of improving pre-school provision. In Scotland, the latest plan
involves providing the parents of some three but mainly four year-olds
with vouchers worth #1100 which can be exchanged for pre-school
services.
Local authorities, playgroups in the voluntary sector, and private
nursery schools all have reservations about the Scottish Office's
proposals, which are out for consultation. But in the independent
nursery sector there is a belief that the scheme will lead to more
nursery school places and more choice for parents.

Geraldine Abrahams learns of a programme designed to help small and
medium-sized companies utilise technology in business.
DEPENDING on your age and your recent experience with the latest
technological innovations, the mention of the words Internet,
Information Technology (IT), or marketing, will either thrill and
motivate you or make you feel like you have fallen asleep and wakened up
in a different time zone.
There are few people in the workplace today who do not recognise the
need to understand and make use of the tools which have revolutionised
the way businesses operate but unfortunately, the opportunities to learn
have not always been readily available, especially for those working in
a small business environment.
The Scottish Co-operatives Development Company (SCDC) will shortly
launch a new 10-week programme which is designed to take the two
separate concepts of marketing and information technology and integrate
them into a training programme called Dynamic Marketing.
Alan McGregor, one of the champions of the programme, worked for SCDC
for almost nine years before leaving in March this year, and this is one
of several training programmes that he project-manages for SCDC through
his own company: Impact Communications.
Before he had moved into the training and development side of SCDC,
Alan had worked mainly with small businesses, small cooperatives and
employee-owned businesses. He discovered that many of them had
significant skill deficits in the areas of marketing and IT.
He proposed the integrated training programme a year ago, basing it on
research findings which suggested that many small and medium-sized
businesses (SMEs) have not yet grasped the concepts of even the most
basic computing technology, despite the fact that the reducing cost of
technology now means that it is within the grasp of most companies.
The proposal was accepted and the programme will run from September 6
to November 9, with a week's placement in a SME. It will be free of
charge to the trainees as SCDC's training is funded by the European
Social Fund, Strathclyde Business Development and Glasgow City Council.
Judging by the applications already received, there are indications
that at least half are from people over 40, and Alan can easily
empathise with this group.
''As someone approaching 40, I have just managed to catch on to the
edge of the new technology,'' he admitted. ''I would say that unless
people of 40+ have made a concerted effort and have been fortunate to be
in the right place at the right time, technology may well have passed
them by. Although marketing is not new, it too is poorly understood by
people from that generation.''
Millie Burnett of SCDC is responsible for marketing the programme and
has found this to be true. ''I have had telephone calls from people
saying that they have been in sales for the past 20 or 30 years, and
that they are out of work at the moment because they don't have the
necessary skills for today,'' she said.
The Dynamic Marketing programme will run for two days a week over nine
weeks plus a week's placement. It is aimed more at people who are
unemployed, and attendance at the course will not affect benefit.
Those people in employment who apply for the course would be accepted
only if their current position is under threat of redundancy or closure.
''Many of the exercises, case studies and assignments will have an SME
focus to them,'' explained Alan McGregor. ''This will better equip
people when they move on and look for employment within smaller
businesses, which are the way ahead according to most recent data. For
instance, that data includes the Scottish Enterprise Business Birth Rate
Report, which clearly identifies the fact that the number of large-site,
multi-employers is dwindling, and the proportion of people employed by
smaller business is constantly rising.''
The programme has four major components. The first is designed to
provide everyone with a good foundation level of training in computing
technology. To this end, the first few weeks of the programme will
involve two SCOTVEC modules, one in word processing and the other in
database.
This will be followed by a detailed look at the application of
marketing techniques, particularly for small businesses. A good
appreciation of the current and future business applications of the
Internet is also vital.
The final and very important component is the work placement, and over
the past few weeks, suitable placements for the trainees have been
selected from SCDC's own clients.
The placement experience has been carefully constructed, with the
trainees carrying out a live project. This will address a real marketing
need within the company, so that it too will have something tangeable to
show for it.
One firm which will be involved is Glendale Knitwear, a new start
company launched at the beginning of 1995 and which has already built up
a strong order base. While business is thriving, one of Glendale's main
challenges lies in the fact that, with the bulk of their business coming
from two or three major suppliers, that they have little time to explore
other possibilities. The trainee, under supervision, will work in this
area.
Job prospects at the end of the course are expected to be very good.
Basing his expectations on the past experience of SCDC programmes where
around two thirds of the trainees have gone into related employment
after six months, Alan McGregor expects at least three quarters of the
programme participants to find work in the related areas within six
months.
He said, ''I believe that the skills these people emerge with will
make them sought after and more employable in the labour market.''
There are 12 places on this pilot programme which will be run at the
University of Strathclyde Incubator at St James Road in Glasgow. So far,
SCDC has had over 80 enquiries, 20 of which have already translated into
firm applications.

Chairman of Partick Thistle, Jim Oliver, vents his frustration over
the elusive consortium which is said to be interested in buying his club
but seems to be negotiating through the media, writes Ken Smith.
WHEN they were handing out tact, Jim Oliver was clearly at the end of
the queue and not paying attention.
The property developer, who has been chairman of Partick Thistle for
over five years, has had little in the way of a public profile -- which
is not surprising in a city where the sporting attention gazes
constantly at David Murray of Rangers and Fergus McCann of Celtic.
Now it is Oliver who is making the headlines as the media feeding
frenzy gnaws on MP George Galloway's announcement that a group of Asian
businessmen want to buy the Firhill club.
Oliver, increasingly exasperated at the lack of contact from any
businessman, speaks his mind, and says the board is not going to walk
away from Firhill simply to satisfy the wishes of ''some Indian with a
curry shop''.
As Charan Gill, the restaurateur mentioned as a possible bidder, has a
turnover many times that of Thistle itself, the remark was indeed crass.
To others it was simply racist. And coming from a club which has avoided
the sectarianism of Rangers and Celtic it was inept.
Yet like many ambitious people, Jim Oliver speaks his mind, seeing no
need to ponder over the nuances of every word. Almost all chairmen of
companies are the same; the difference being that most of them keep an
army of public relations personnel to ensure their thoughts are kept
safely away from the public.
Nor is Oliver apologetic. He says: ''As I understand it he is Indian,
and he owns a curry shop. If he is not an Indian with a curry shop then
I'll apologise.'' He sees nothing racist in that. He explains further,
although to some people he is simply digging a bigger hole: ''I don't
care whether they are Asian or one-eyed black lesbian saxophone players,
if they have the money we will talk to them. But the club is not for
sale.
''To my mind, the whole thing is a spoof. We can't take it
seriously.''
What exasperates Oliver more than anything is that George Galloway has
given press conferences and interviews about the possible bid, yet no
money, no offer, nothing concrete has been produced. Now the alleged
racist remarks of the chairman may become the smokescreen which allows
some of those involved to slip away, having caused unrest at the club,
without ever putting forward a tangible offer.
Looking at it from a business point of view, Oliver's anger is
understandable. Businessmen do not do business through the media, no
matter how much we would like them to. No-one has talked money to the
club, yet the impression was given that a deal was imminent. At a time
when the directors should be concentrating on the season just started,
their attention is diverted.
Even Charan Gill agrees that is not the way to do business and has
withdrawn from the consortium, casting doubts on when a bid, if ever,
will be made.
The Thistle bid, whether it is fact or fantasy, began with a telephone
call to Jim Oliver from Sunday newspaper columnist, and now Thistle fan,
Ron McKay.
Says Oliver: ''He was the guy who before the end of last season
predicted we would be relegation favourites for this season. I'd never
met him, and saw no reason to take his calls. But he insisted it was an
investment proposition. He said he had someone who wanted to invest in
Partick Thistle.
''OK, so I arranged to meet him and George Galloway at eleven o'clock
last Wednesday morning at my golf club, provided the meeting was treated
in confidence.
''Galloway said a group of Asian businessmen -- he couldn't tell me
who they were -- was interested in taking over the club. Incidentally,
it was Galloway who raised the race issue by referring to them
constantly as Asian businessmen.
''I told him it was not for sale. We are six years into a 10-year
programme. We took it from a decrepit club lying eighth in the first
division to a Premier League club run efficiently and profitably.
''So I said 'Fine. You do what you have to do, but as far as I'm
concerned this meeting did not take place.' I left at 11.45 and at 12.30
I was having lunch with my daughter when Ron McKay sits down and
whispers that the media had been on to George and he was trying to
discover how they found out.
''McKay said someone had talked and that he thought it must have been
one of the Asian businessmen. There then followed a series of press
releases.''
Mr Oliver is clearly a bitter man at the turn of events. From his
office he looks across to the new #2.5m stand. A further #1.5m was spent
refurbishing the existing stand, and another #1m has gone on new
floodlights and other improvements.
The club has remained in the Premier League when others like Dundee
United have not. There is a new manager in Murdo McLeod. It should be a
time to look ahead, not fend off media hype.
One point causing confusion is that Oliver says the club is not for
sale. He also says that, like any business, it is for sale if the price
is right. Confusing? Well, it's simple business practice. There is not a
business in the land, from the largest multinational to the corner shop,
which is not for sale if someone comes along with an irresistible offer.
That, though, is not the same as saying it's for sale.
In other words, there is no bargain basement at Firhill. Galloway says
Oliver would have accepted a cheque for #2.5m for control of the club.
No doubt Oliver was simply testing to see if there was any actual money
floating around to give the so-called takeover bid some credence.
As it is, Oliver and his four fellow directors have put in #2.5m into
the club in shares and loans since they took over in 1990. Any buyer
would have to recompense them, and convince the board that there was,
say, a further #2m to be made available to the manager to buy players.
Deputy chairman Brown McMaster is also scathing of the way the
approach has been made. ''It's like a stranger coming to your front door
and saying they are acting for someone who wants to buy your house, even
though it's not for sale, and then demanding that they see round it. You
wouldn't operate like that, so why should we?'' he says.
As Oliver emphasises: ''No businessman has telephoned me, faxed me,
written to me, or contacted me about any offer. Anybody who wanted to
take over this club would have to demonstrate that they could run it
properly, and by their dealings so far, I'd be sceptical about that.
''The danger is that with all this hot air the fans will think there
is all this money out there and we are turning it down. Remember, no
director takes a penny piece out of this club. It is altruism of the
highest order -- stupidity if you like. But we are not going to walk
away simply to satisfy the whim of George Galloway or others. There is
as much chance of that as of me flying out of that window.''
Jim Oliver seemed to have his feet firmly on the ground when he said
it.

DUNDEE United manager Billy Kirkwood heads into the Coca-Cola Cup
clash with Motherwell tonight with his team -- favourites for promotion
-- sitting second-bottom of the first division.
Kirkwood yesterday admitted: ''I knew it was going to be difficult for
us but I did not realise just how difficult.
''The good thing, however, about this game coming so quickly after the
defeat at Dunfermline is that it will allow the players the opportunity
to make up for their display at East End Park.
''I am trying to put together a new team here and this allows us to
see how we might fare in the premier division if we can make it back
there in the one season.''
Former Scotland midfielder Dave Bowman, red-carded at the weekend, is
out and will be dealt with by the Tannadice club. Kirkwood said: ''We
lose him straight away for this match, and then he could be out for five
more games if he gets just a couple of yellow cards. We cannot afford
players landing themselves in trouble on the field.''
Kirkwood will still be without David Hannah, while Maurice Malpas is a
doubt. But club skipper Christian Dailly, who began the season under
suspension, will return. Close-season signing Sandy Robertson is likely
to replace Bowman in the middle of the park.
Motherwell, too, have worries, with Chris McCart nursing a knock he
collected at Tynecastle and striker Tommy Coyne still unavailable.
Manager Alex McLeish warns: ''Dundee United are probably the toughest of
the unseeded teams. We must be aware of that when we travel to Tannadice
tomorrow.''
Going to Broadwood, Hibernian face a similarly dangerous journey. It
was just a year ago that they crashed 2-0 to Airdrie in the same
tournament.
Last night club skipper Gordon Hunter, who will return to action
tonight after suspension, recalled: ''We had won our first seven games
last season when we came to play Airdrie and we lost. To my mind they
are the most difficult cup opponents anyone can get from the first
division.
''The lads looked really good at Firhill on Saturday and we were
unlucky not to win the game. Basically, though, we were making chances
and that was something we never seemed able to do last year.''
Two more suspension victims, David Farrell and Willie Miller, are
still mising and Keith Wright's troublesome back injury could keep him
sidelined.

MASTER trainer Reg Akehurst executed a long-range plan to deliver a
memorable first triumph in the ''Amateurs' Derby'' for Tim McCarthy at
Epsom yesterday.
He repaid the leading point-to-point rider for his preparation of many
of the Akehurst stars at the McCarthy livery yard with the winning mount
on Proton in the Moet &amp; Chandon Silver Magnum.
The champagne was put on ice while they sweated out a stewards'
inquiry into a clash between the three protagonists 50 yards out.
But the corks were popping after Proton was confirmed the half-length
winner over Casual Water, whose Italian jockey Filipo Grasso-Caprioli
received a two-day ban (September 6 and 7) for careless riding, his
mount having pushed third-placed Flight Lieutenant on to Proton.
''Tim won on Proton for me last year and I have had this race in mind
for some time,'' admitted Akehurst. ''The horse will probably go for the
November Handicap now.''
McCarthy has won the Kim Muir on Fighting Words, and the Horse And
Hound Cup on Federal Trooper among his 130 successes in Arab racing,
point-to-points, and under rules.

<HEADLINE>Why Brown must stay with Leighton as first choice. Goram needs more time to re-stake that claim</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KEN GALLACHER CHIEF FOOTBALL WRITER</BYLINE>

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown will name his squad of players today to
face Finland at Hampden in a game where victory will send the nation
into the European Championship Finals.
That game is next week and while Brown was still agonising over the
position of Rangers' goalkeeper Andy Goram last night I believe that the
Ibrox man should be left on the international sidelines.
Not for good -- but certainly until he finds himself free of the
strains that fighting back from injury and being asked to play in
Europe's top club tournament have brought him.
Brown named him last time around in good faith. Since then all of us
have gone through the soccer soap opera which surrounded Goram and his
decision to withdraw because he was not ''mentally attuned''.
Brown and the SFA accepted that explanation and now they must further
accept that Goram still may not be able to focus properly on a match
where, in any case, he would be second choice at best.
Brown has a No 1 at the moment in Jim Leighton and for the next two
competitive games the Hibs' veteran should be allowed to play and
cotninue a challenge for top spot next summer which can only benefit the
national side.
We do not have enough quality players available to allow Brown to slam
the door shut on the Rangers' star. Instead the team manager may have to
do some subtle horse-trading much in the manner of his most illustrious
predecessor, the late Jock Stein.
Stein would always allow some latitude for players he needed and often
left men out if their clubs had important games, knowing that when
Scotland needed the key men he would get them.
Something of that order may be necessary in the current situation. If
the goalkeeper still feels he would have problems then he should be left
alone until these problems have cleared. But he should not be dismissed
from the Scotland stage because some day Brown will need his talents.
Perhaps even next summer -- if we have qualified.
I don't think that the preparations for next week's crucial Hampden
match should be disrupted by any off-the-field bickerings and the best
way to do that would be to leave Goram out.
That would allow Brown and his chosen men to focus on the real issue
-- victory over the Finns. And Brown believes that given his usual core
of players that can be achieved.
He knows too that despite injuries still affecting some players he
would want -- notably Paul McStay and Duncan Ferguson -- others are
coming good at the right time.
Aberdeen striker Scott Booth who has made a stunning start to the
season will be named for the first time in almost a year. He will be
joined by John Spencer of Chelsea who was injured before the victory
over Greece.
The remainder of the squad will be on the usual lines. There won't be
shocks because there is little room for manoeuvre at this stage of the
qualifying process.
Brown insisted yesterday:''It will be a bigger than usual squad
because this is a bigger than usual game and I want to be covered in
case of injuries this week. But I'm confident that if we have our key
personnel available then we can get the required result.''
With or without his troubled goalkeeper he might have added...

BONUS payments for the Qualifying and Scottish cups will be dependent
on good behaviour, it was decided yesterday.
The winner of both the north and south sections of the Qualifying Cup
will collect #5000. In the Scottish Cup itself the winner will pick up
#37,500 and the beaten finalist #18,750. The eight clubs who are knocked
out in the first round will get #1250 each.
But a caution will cost 10% and an ordering off 20% from the match fee
up to and including the semi-finals. In the final, a caution will cost
#1875 and an ordering off #3750.
Fines will help fund the SFA's Fair Play campaign.
* CHALLENGE Cup. Second-round draw:
Albion Rovers v Brechin; Alloa v Stirling Albion; Dunfermline v
Forfar; Dundee United v Hamilton; Stenhousemuir v Montrose; Livingston v
St Mirren; Dundee v Cowdenbeath; Clydebank v St Johnstone.
Ties to be played on September 12 or 13.

<TEXT>
TELEVISION watchdogs today called on the Government to let them
regulate subscriber and pay-as-you-view systems, which they fear could
become a monopoly for Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International after the
digital broadcasting revolution.
The Independent Television Commission argued that it, not Oftel,
should be the regulatory body for conditional access systems, in the
expectation of 18 or more new channels before the end of the century.
Otherwise, the complexity of subscriber technology, which involves
encryption and a set-top black box, could lead to a race and eventual
monopoly for Mr Murdoch's companies, the ITC said.
News International owns News Datacom Ltd, providers of Britain's
existing conditional access system for satellite services, as well as
most of BSkyB, the company that provides programming for many of those
services.
The ITC said one company was likely to become dominant and so the
interests of broadcasters and viewers had to be safeguarded, although
investors should also reap the rewards of developing the system.
''The ITC would urge Government to reconsider its proposal to licence
conditional access for digital terrestrial services via Oftel under the
Telecommunications Act.
''Both the encryption and subscriber management aspects of conditional
access are issues which affect the availability, content, and diversity
of the subscription-funded programme services which are delivered to
viewers by broadcasters, and the terms upon which those services are
delivered,'' it said.
However, the ITC ''broadly welcomed'' the Government's May White Paper
liberalising media ownership for newspapers and television companies.
The proposals will allow newspaper proprietors with less than 20% of
the total circulation to own up to two ITV television channels, paving
the way for new cross-media ownership, although clipping the wings of
News International, owner of five national titles.

PERPLEXING pleas from air passengers, including one traveller who
asked for a seat away from the window because she was frightened of
bats, were disclosed by a holiday airline.
The year produced a bewildering number of bizarre queries, said the
customer services department at Air 2000.
These included:
* The elderly lady who wanted to take her canary aboard a jet to test
oxygen levels so that ''if he drops dead you will know to let us have
the masks''.
* A male passenger who asked to be seated away from his wife and,
preferably, next to a young, single woman passenger.
* The young couple who asked for separate seats because they would
need space to spread out since they were newly married.
* The woman who asked not to be given a window seat for her night
flight home as she was terrified of bats.
* An anti-smoker who wanted a special seat at the airport to which she
was flying so she could avoid any smokers in the arrival hall.
''We get hundreds of requests, some very routine, but occasionally we
receive more amusing ones,'' said Air 2000 marketing and commercial
director Bill Kirkwood.
''The heat always seems to make our customers more frisky than normal,
as well as more demanding.''

Beijing
AN eight-day train journey from Warsaw ended tonight with music and
flowers for the 250 women who arrived for an international women's
meeting.
Children waited to greet the train with their gifts. The arriving
women, primarily from Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics, had
used their days aboard to make final preparations for the meeting -- and
have a little fun.
''It was more than I expected. It was really nice. We were dancing
every night until three in the morning,'' said Desma Kos, of Croatia,
while waiting to board a bus to her hotel.
The meeting brings together non-governmental groups that will try to
influence the UN World Conference on Women, which opens next week. The
buses took the women to Huairou, 30 miles north of Beijing, where the
meeting begins tomorrow.
While travelling the Trans-Siberian railway, the women received
training in how to take part in the NGO Forum, said Stacey Gilbert of
San Francisco, who works for the United Nations Development Programme
that organised the trip.
''I think they have a lot more confidence to face the issues and
really get what they want out of the conference,'' she said.
As she spoke, one of the Chinese men escorting the women to their
buses stepped up without a word, roughly grabbed her by the arm and
pulled  her away. She took it calmly, shouting back with a smile: ''Got
to go.''
Sakiko Fukuraka, one of the UN organisers on the trip, said the group
produced a declaration about women's role in conflict resolution en
route to Beijing.
''All these negotiating teams are made up of men -- no women,'' she
added. ''Women should be involved in peace negotiations.''
Vanessa Vadim, daughter of American actress Jane Fonda, described the
trip as ''incredible''.
''Everyone wanted to stay on,'' she said. ''We haven't finished our
work.'' -- AP.

LABOUR Party leaders are using Scotland as the launchpad for a major
effort to build a new partnership with the voluntary sector, starting at
a meeting in Edinburgh today.
The initiative, which will bring together representatives of charities
and local government and politics in Scotland, has the support of party
leader Tony Blair and Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson.
Heading the one-day conference will be Shadow Minister for Scottish
Affairs John McFall. He said it was fitting that the first steps in this
exercise in partnership should be taken in Scotland, which had a
tradition of community activity which went back generations.
Mr Alun Michael, who is Shadow Minister for the Voluntary Sector, said
the party would be setting out Labour's fresh vision of a partnership
between the voluntary sector and government, but he also promised to
spend most of the time listening.
''This is not a one-off meeting. We will take away the concerns and
suggestions that we hear, we will continue the dialogue at a more local
level and with specialist groups throughout the United Kingdom,'' he
said.
There also would be more detailed and structured discussions during
the coming year.

SCOTLAND'S Gary Jacobs, who gave WBC welterweight champion Pernell
Whitaker such a tough battle before losing on points in Atlantic City at
the weekend, blasted out yesterday: ''If Frank Bruno is good enough to
get four shots at a world title then surely I deserve another chance.''
Now on a family holiday in America, Jacobs vows he will be back to
chase his dream, and he is more than happy to leave his future in the
hands of Mickey Duff.
''I've got the best management team in the business, and you can take
it as certain I will be back,'' said Jacobs, who added: ''I just want to
enjoy my holiday and forget boxing for a couple of weeks. Mickey will be
working on another fight for me, and I'll let him worry about that.
Hopefully, it will be another world title shot.
''I deserve it. I won and successfully defended the European title
away from home to climb into the official No.1 challenger spot for the
world title -- nobody handed me anything on a plate. I've just taken the
world's best all the way and that must surely mean I can fight a bit,
too.''
Asked whether his best option now would be a meeting with Ireland's
WBO champion Eamonn Loughran, who retained his title at the weekend,
Jacobs, who has tended to dismiss WBO titles in the past, thought for a
moment.
''The Americans are beginning to recognise WBO championships more
these days, although they don't carry the same prestige as the others,''
he said. ''It could be Loughran, but whether he would want to fight me
is a different matter.''
* VINNIE Vecchione, who stepped into the ring to save his fighter
Peter McNeeley from Mike Tyson 89 seconds into their bout nine days ago,
will get his #119,000 share of the purse after all. The Nevada State
Athletic Commission found no proof that the manager acted illegally.

Age 32. Born Glasgow. Majors: 0. Caps: 2 (1991-93).
Record: P8 W4 H2 L2.
Says he lost sleep over his play-off defeat to Steve Elkington in the
US PGA, but it did not stop him retaining German Open this weekend.
First win since same event last August. Europe's leading money-winner
for the past two seasons, Montgomerie is the world's highest-ranked
player without a major. Also beaten in a play-off for the US Open last
year. Partnered Nick Faldo last time and they lost only once in four
games.
38. Majors: 2 (1985-93 Masters). Caps: 7 (1981-83-85-87-89-91-93).
Record: P29 W13 H5 L11.
Has lifted at least one title every season since 1979 and has not
missed a half-way cut in Europe for over four years. Langer won his
third Volvo PGA Championship in May, but missed this month's US PGA with
back injury. Key figure in 1985 and 1987 wins, but missed the six-foot
putt in 1991 which gave America victory. Showed character with
tournament victory a week later.
42. Majors: 0. Caps: 7 (1981-83-85-87-89-91-93).
Record: P23 W4 H6 L13.
Forever to be remembered as the man who sank the putt in 1985 which
ended America's 28-year grip on the trophy. Overall cup record is poor,
but has been playing some of the best golf of his career this season,
winning Italian and Irish Opens. Goal is to top Order of Merit for first
time, but now second to Montgomerie after being pipped for German Open.
Had septic toe at last match, played only one game and had to withdraw
from singles.
38. Majors: 0. Caps: 1 (1993).
Record: P2 L2.
Lost Open championship play-off to John Daly last month after dramatic
finish. Duffed chip, then made 65-foot putt to tie. Former factory
worker and caddie w ho became first Italian to play in the match in
1993, but his debut ended in tears. Was one up with two to play against
Davis Love, but lost both holes and Love's point clinched American win.
Four runner-up finishes this season, but no win for over two years.
38. Majors: 5 (1979-84-88 Open, 1980-83 Masters). Caps: 7
(1979-83-85-87-89-91-93).
Record: P34 W19 H5 L10.
With Jose Maria Olazabal has formed most successful pairing in cup
history -- just two defeats in 15 games. Earned eighth cap with
brilliant end to 1994, but since 71st career win in Spanish Open in May
has suffered alarming slump, missing halfway cut in five of past six
tournaments. Hindered by bad back, too, he wants no repeat of 1993
match, where he asked to be left out of second-day fourballs.
29.
Majors: 0.
Caps: 1 (1991).
Record: P2 L2.
Quiet man of European golf. Made unhappiest of debuts four years ago.
Heavily beaten in foursomes, first partnered by Colin Montgomerie and
then by Nick Faldo, Gilford was the European left out of the singles
after injury to American Steve Pate. Earns second cap now following
superlative five-shot win in 1994 European Open. In spare time, looks
after herd of cattle on farm which he and his father own.
41. Majors: 0. Caps: 6 (1977-79-81-89-91-93).
Record: P22 W7 H1 L14.
Switched to broomhandle putter at Moroccan Open in March -- and
immediately won. He nearly abandoned it at Open, but perseverance paid
off with eighth-place finish. Fined for his behaviour at the 1979 match,
he is now chairman of the European tour's tournament committee. Declined
invitation to the US PGA championship two weeks ago, but clinched
seventh cap at the German Open. Did not win a point last time.
41. Majors: 0. Caps: 5 (1977-81-85-87-89).
Record: P13 W6 H1 L6.
Has not won an event since 1988 English Open, but second five times in
last two seasons. His runner-up finish in Czech Open, the last-but-one
qualifying event, earned him a recall.
''I still have to learn how to win again,'' he said at end of last
year. ''It's all a question of nerve, of controlling yourself when you
get into a winning position.'' Last game in cup was record 8 and 7
defeat at hands of Tom Kite.
28. Majors: 0. Caps: debut.
Becomes the second Swede to play in Ryder Cup, following Joakim
Haeggman last time.
Went to Arizona State University and played on same team as Phil
Mickelson, who now makes his cup debut, too.
Turned pro in 1990 and, in first full season, was part of winning
Swedish teams in Dunhill and World Cups.
Almost made Ryder Cup, too, but this time he did manage to hang on to
a place despite missing cut in final two qualifying events.
33. Majors: 0. Caps: debut.
Relieved to make Ryder Cup at last. Buckled in 1989 when on verge of
making team and pressure showed again at German Open when he played
final nine holes in 42, but stayed tenth in table. Changed to
broomhandle putter last year and this season grabbed first win since
1990 at Catalan Open, then added English Open after play-off with Colin
Montgomerie. Said in May he had no interest in the cup because the
pressure was destroying players.
38. Majors: 5 (1987-90-92 Open, 1989-90 Masters). Caps: 9
(1977-79-82-83-85-87-89-91-93).
Record: P36 W19 H4 L13.
Rejoined American tour this year, but after early success has had
disappointing season. Finished outside top 20 in all four majors and so
needed wild card invitation, as he did in 1985 and 1991. Mainly blames
putting problems for results and at US PGA this month abandoned
cross-handed method he had used for a year. If he hits form he will
stillbe player the Americans least want to face.
29. Majors: 1 (1994 Masters). Caps: 4 (1987-89-91-93).
Record: P20 W12 H2 L6.
Handed wild card for fourth time -- 1989 was only time he qualified.
Instant hit with Ballesteros when they paired on his debut. Underwent
toe surgery in January, but problem with his right foot returned with
growth of small tumour. Has limped all year and there are doubts whether
he can play two rounds a day at Oak Hill, but better recent form -- and
the parternship with Ballesteros -- saw him preferred to Ian Woosnam.

WITH the fag end of the month to be completed following the bank
holiday weekend when the markets are closed, it will be Friday before
there are any official economic statistics.
Retail sales perked up in July, and so City analysts are looking for a
strong set of credit figures. James Capel expects net credit to pick up
from June's #591m to around #600m.
With European trade data being compiled from VAT returns, global trade
figures continue to lag behind other statistics. Friday's figures are
for June, when, it is thought, the visible trade gap will have widened
by around #300m to about #1200m.

<HEADLINE>Encouraging results from Synergy rape trials</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>25</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976650397</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH trials of the composite hybrid rape Synergy have done
''encouragingly well'' for the second year running, according to Kerr
Walker, Aberdeen-based rape specialist with the Scottish Agricultural
College. He reported a yield advantage of more than 20% over other
varieties used as controls.
His advice is that farmers who are drilling several fields should
consider using Synergy for about 20% of the area. ''If you've just got
one field, then stick with a conventional variety,'' he added.
In Scottish Agronomy trials, Synergy yielded 25% higher than controls
-- Apex, Bristol, Envol, Express and Falcon. It was 0.85 tonnes a
hectare ahead of Commanche, the highest yielding commercially available
rape.
Felix Patton of supplier CPB Twyford said that in appropriate
circumstances Synergy should give at least a #50 a hectare gross margin
bonus after deducting extra seed and growing costs.
The top yielding Scottish Synergy crop this year has been eight
hectares grown by Mary Singleton at Scotston of Kirkside, St Cyrus, near
Montrose. The return was 4.7 tonnes a hectare, beating last year's Envol
by 1.2 tonnes a hectare. The autumn drilling this year will be just over
six hectares and the only management change being considered is an
increase in the amount of sulphur.

THE bank holiday means this is a shorter week and most of the the
major companies reporting are concentrated on Thursday.
Tomorrow, though, does see the half-year figures from motor component
manufacturer T&amp;N and the market will be looking for a measure of
respectability after last year's late exceptional charge of #140m for
past asbestos business which virtually wiped out annual pre-tax profits.
T&amp;N's share price has started to emerge from the doldrums in recent
weeks and could strengthen further on the back of a solid performance.
Projections range from #66m to #75m for a consensus of #71.9m which
would compare with #61m for the first half of 1994.
Improved sales and margins across many of the company's 10 divisions
should underpin the results. T&amp;N is expected to stick to its restrictive
dividend policy for 1995. The group has forecast an interim of 3p and a
total of 6p is in prospect for the year against 10.85p last time.
On Thursday, aero-engine and industrial turbines manufacturer
Rolls-Royce is thought likely to announce an increase of possibly around
50% in first-half profits, boosted by heavy cost cutting over the past
two years. Market projections are for taxable profits to jump to between
#50m and #65m against #40m last time.
The interim dividend is expected to be held at 2p. The company has
warned of a dip in engine deliveries this year but investors are looking
to when the core new aircraft and engine spares market comes out of
recession.
Also on Thursday, hotels and betting group Ladbroke will be announcing
its interim figures with the market forecasting a range from #52m to
#60m for a consensus of #56.7m compared with #57.3m for the same period
of 1994. Strong interest will centre on the group's betting shops.
Last month, Ladbroke Racing blamed the National Lottery, and in
particular Instant scratch cards, for its decision to cut 200 jobs out
of a total of 650 at its London head office and other locations --
including nine at Grangemouth. No change is envisaged in the 2.4p
interim dividend.
Reckitt &amp; Colman (Thursday) will be providing details of its
first-half progress. The figures will be the first since the group sold
its mustard business to Unilever in May as part of its decision to
concentrate on household prducts.
A half-year figure ranging from #149m to #162m for a consensus of
#158.3m could be in prospect and an increase in the interim dividend
from 6.95p to up to 7.5p.
A good performance is expected from the Macfarlane Group of packaging
companies when it reveals half-time progress, again on Thursday.
At the annual general meeting in Glasgow in May the chairman, Lord
Macfarlane of Bearsden, said 1995 had started strongly with sales and
profits well ahead of the same period last year despite pressure on
margins.
He said he would be disappointed if the group failed to make a taxable
profit of #20m this year. Last year profits rose 28% to #16.3m.

<HEADLINE>Two US banks in $10bn merger</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>24</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976650399</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
New York, Monday -- Banking giants Chase Manhattan Corporation and
Chemical Banking Corporation said today they would join in a $10bn
merger that will create the largest bank in the United States and one of
the biggest in the world.
The combination of Chemical, America's fourth-largest bank, and Chase
Manhattan, the sixth-largest, is the biggest ever in the banking
industry, which is undergoing a spate of mergers as companies look to
cut costs or expand into other business lines or new territories.
''This is a strategic merger, not the sale of a company,'' Chase
chairman and chief executive Thomas Labrecque said at a joint news
conference with Walter Shipley, Chemical's chairman and chief executive
officer.
Mr Shipley, 59, will become chairman and chief executive of the new
institution. Mr Labrecque, 56, will be president and chief operating
officer of the new company, which will retain the Chase name.
''We decided this was the best route for our shareholders, our
customers and our employees,'' Mr Labrecque added.
The two executives said that the combined company expects to see
double-digit earnings growth and achieve a return on equity of at least
18%.
The new company will have $297bn in assets and $20bn in shareholders'
equity, overtaking Citicorp as the biggest bank in the United States and
becoming the fourth largest in the world.
The new Chase, which will have operations in 39 states domestically
and 51 countries around the world, is expected to cut about 12,000 jobs
from a combined staff of about 75,000.
''We propose to utilise the natural turnover that takes place (in
personnel) to take care of layoffs,'' Mr Shipley said, noting that each
bank experiences about a 20% annual turnover in staff, especially among
lower paid workers.
The deal is expected to save the new institution about $1500m
annually, starting within three years, the banks said.
''It is accretive from Day One,'' Mr Labrecque said.
The boards of directors of the rival banks approved the merger
yesterday, and the deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter
of next year. Shareholder and regulatory approval is still needed.
The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
which would have to approve the merger, said they would have no comment
until a merger application is filed. A Securities and Exchange
Commission spokesman also would not comment on the merger.
Mr Shipley and Mr Labrecque said the financial services industry has
become so broad and so diverse that they did not expect any objections
to the deal on anti-trust grounds.
''We do not anticipate any significant anti-trust problems,'' Mr
Shipley said. -- Reuter

AFTER bucking the recession in the UK building industry for the past
five years, Edinburgh-based Morrison Construction Group is coming to the
stock market, through a placing of shares with institutions.
The new capital raised will allow Morrison, controlled from Scotland
since a management buy-out in 1989, to accelerate a growth rate which is
already the envy of many rivals. Since the buy-out, shareholder' funds
have grown from #1m to #18.6m, on turnover now well above #200m and
pre-tax profits of #7.6m in the year to March.
Morrison is active in four sectors -- building and property
development, civil engineering, utility and energy, and housebuilding.
The group is moving progressively away from traditional competitive
tender work, adopting a creative approach to winning new business which,
in the past week, triggered a row over who will be asked to build the
new Inverness headquarters of the North of Scotland Water Authority.
A flotation prospectus is expected within two weeks. Impact day is set
for September 27. The sponsor is Noble Grossart; the broker, Natwest
Securities.
Morrison was founded in Tain in 1948 by Alexander Morrison, father of
the two current dominant shareholders, Fraser and Gordon Morrison. In
1974, a controlling 80% stake was sold to Consolidated African Selection
Trust.
The Morrison family stayed with the business as it passed through
various hands -- including BP for a year -- and ended up as part of the
Charter Consolidated empire. In 1989, Fraser Morrison, now chairman of
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and his younger brother Gordon bought
back control and returned the group headquarters to Edinburgh.
The results achieved since have bucked the recessionary trend in the
rest of the industry. Even in 1993, when most construction groups were
deeply in the red, Morrison managed to turn in reduced pre-tax profits
of #3.3m.
The Morrison name is familiar on road, motorway and bridge contracts
across Scotland. The group is currently on its third M74 contract,
resolving, under sub-contract, a problem-ridden section let to two
Italian groups.
The dominant division, in both turnover and operating profit terms is
building and property development, where it is developing Strathclyde
Business Park in Lanarkshire and is about to start work, in
collaboration with Cala, on Exchange Plaza, the last link in Edinburgh's
new conference complex. Exchange Plaza has already been sold on to a
financial institution, before a stone has been laid.
In England, Morrison owned Chester City Football Club for a time, as
part of a complex deal to relocate the football and build a retail park
on Chester's old ground.
Morrison has a reputation for technical innovation. On one recent
contract -- a joint venture with a German partner -- an entire underpass
was prefabricated and jacked under a railway line in South Wales without
having to halt the trains.
In the energy and utilities sector Morrison is working in partnership
with British Gas and the English water companies. The division deploys
about 200 two-person teams on around 75,000 separate jobs each year,
right across England.
Housebuilding, on the other hand, is restricted to Scotland, and is
increasingly focused on low-cost, social housing. It sold 344 units last
year and has been consistently profitable. Morrison also operates nine
quarries across Scotland.
The group has a small but growing overseas presence. It was working in
Kuwait five days after the war ended and is still working there.
Morrison also has exposure in Azerbaijan, Berlin and St Petersburg.
It is also bidding for work under the Government's private finance
initiative. But it is Morrison's creative approach to winning new work,
through its network of 27 business development teams across the country,
which differentiates it most from many of its rivals.
Around 50% of all its work comes from this approach, which eschews the
traditional ''here's the tender document give us the lowest price''
method.

<TEXT>
Paris, Monday -- French carmaker Renault today reported that its
profits excluding exceptional items more than doubled in the first half
of 1995 on a surge in operating income fuelled by a rise in French car
sales.
Renault's six-month net attributable profit of Fr1755m barely exceeded
its 1994 first-half profit of Fr1753m but the 1994 figure included more
than Fr1000m of onet-time gains. They included proceeds from the sale
last year of a building and of shares in Volvo AB following the collapse
of Renault's proposed link-up with the Swedish group.
Renault's operating income surged to Fr1515m in the first six months
of the year from Fr688m as its car and commercial vehicle businesses
swung back into the black.
The results will be welcomed both by the Government, which plans to
complete the privatisation of Renault begun last year, and by investors
who have seen shares they bought at Fr165 slide steadily to close at
Fr147 today, down 6.5 on the day.
The Government recently said it would sell control of Renault, in
which it retains 53%.
The improved half-year results reflect a 7.7% rise in French car sales
in the first half of the year, propelled by a state rebate programme
that expired on June 30. Renault's sales rose 7.1% to Fr96.21bn in the
first half.

school-leavers and graduates, according to a new survey today.
A shortage of good workers was quoted as the biggest barrier to future
business success in the poll of 200 medium-sized companies in Britain.
The Mori survey also found that firms are failing to invest in

ALFRED BRENDEL -- like, in Edinburgh, the late Hans Gal -- has been
known to deplore performances of Schubert's great B-flat major piano
sonata that enormously enlarge the first movement by including the
composer's designated exposition repeat.
Andras Schiff thus enlarged it -- or, to put it another way, performed
it complete -- in the last of his late-night Schubert recitals on
Sunday, and the music could only be said to benefit. As in all fine
performances of Schubert's largest works, you were made to feel you had
travelled an immense distance in the 15 or so minutes the movement took
to perform. But you also recognised that the pianist trusted Schubert
enough to let him set his own pace and to fill the amount of space he
needed.
The unhurried unrolling of the opening theme, and the mysterious trill
in the bass that serves as its pendant, had in any case made plain that
this was to be the most spacious of performances. And as a result, by
the time the first movement finally reached its destination, the
landscape opened out even more broadly on a slow movement offering new
worlds of experience.
The speed was not so slow as to be trudging, but it was not so fast as
to sound impatient. Moreover, it led to a scherzo that was suitably
capricious and mercurial -- proof that Schiff plays Schubert fast when
the occasion demands -- and a finale whose swift changes of mood were
keenly controlled without blurring on the Bosendorfer piano which,

Inspiration, it seems, is in the eye of the beholder. Choreographer
Pina Bausch once caught sight of a field of flowers, closely guarded by
Alsatian dogs. The sudden contrast between the breathtaking beauty and
calm of the flowers, the stark ferocity of the dogs, lodged in her
imagination. And out of that recollected image she subsequently
developed Nelken, a powerful piece of dance-theatre that sets the
dreams, desires and hopes of youth against an abrasive reality fraught
with manifestations of our deepest fears. Highly acclaimed wherever it
has been performed, Nelken (it means carnations) opens at the Playhouse
in Edinburgh on Thursday night.

* FIRST there were spells with the Fringe and Assembly Theatre, then
working on the first Book Festival with Jenny Brown in 1983 and again
from 1986 to 1991 before taking over as director herself. All in all,
says Shona Munro, terrifying both of us with the thought, she's been
involved in the Festival in some guise for around 20 years.
Which is the principal reason she's announced that this will be her
last bookfest before she moves on to pastures new and not quite yet
determined.
She takes with her some cracking memories of the biennial Charlotte
Square extravaganzas, she says. And often the real high spots were gigs
that looked too esoteric on paper to capture the popular imagination.
''I remember worrying about scheduling a session with three female
poets in the Spiegeltent, for instance. But the mix of Wendy Cope, Liz
Lochhead, and Eintou Pearl Springer was just a joy. So too was the event
with Christabel Bielenberg and Jung Chang two years ago. People
sometimes talk about the Book Festival not being literary, but that's a
dangerous word. We're not, and never have been, about high art or high
fiction or high anything. We're about reminding people that books are
part of everyday life and books are fun.''
That benign propaganda begins in the children's tent with the
deliberate juxtaposition of books and silly balloons, making all the
right connections with fledgling readers.
''And for that matter with writers. I always like to think that some
of the kids who come in here go on to become authors as well.''
Working on seven out of the eight Book Festivals hasn't dimmed her
evangelical zeal: ''I still get a great kick out of seeing people
queueing up every day till we open at 10. And about the fact that we get
five or six thousand people through the door every day. I think we offer
unique opportunities for people to meet favourite authors and find out
that they're actually real people. Of course a lot of people in the
business arrive here with their own agenda, but our bottom line is that
we make books accessible.''
Now that this year's two-week bookathon is over, and the Speigeltent,
alas, is folded away, the hunt goes on in earnest for Shona's successor.
Anyone who thinks the job a glamorous swan with the stars of the
publishing firmament need not apply. As Shona points out, it's a
happening which has no safety net. Every penny has to be raised and one
bad year could kill it off. So what does the outgoing director consider
the prime qualities for the right candidate?
''You could call it a skills mix. The ability to deal with big authors
and TV crews and a working knowledge of how to unblock the toilets!''
* FOR many years the Festival organisers and the local politicians
were wont to wrangle over how relevant the annual event was to the
natives. The collective angst often resulted in an unhappy piece of
tokenism which hit the budget without delivering anything resembling
real involvement. Now a much more fruitful partnership is being built,
not least in the field of dance.
Two separate events this last fortnight convinced me that the policy
has now hit the right set of tracks. The first was the use of
schoolchildren by the Miami City Ballet company in their version of
Nutcracker. The auditions for this event were oversubscribed, but
Lothian region reports that over the run some 90 children got the
opportunity to dance with one of the world's premier dance companies
with over 50 schools involved. And watching this particularly
child-centred Balanchine production you knew all these kids had been
given an experience with which they would almost certainly bore their
grandchildren.
A week later subtropical temperatures did nothing to dampen the
enthusiasm of another group of youngsters strutting their stuff in a
Show and Share in the gym of Broughton High School. For the second year
running ScottishPower funded four projects with the Mark Morris Dance
Group involving activities as varied as summer schools for secondary
pupils and workshops, with the company involving special needs groups
and senior citizens. The huge bonus of being able to use the Morris
dancers (sic) is that company's infectious enthusiasm which had quite
clearly infected their latest part-timers.
Add in a Festival masterclass with Scottish Ballet and former New York
City Ballet star Violette Verdy, pilot music workshops in schools, and a
similar outreach programme with TAG theatre company and you get the kind
of cross-fertilisation which leads to a much healthier relationship
between the citizenry and the annual arts extravaganza which has grown,
Topsy style, in its midst.
And, as the Festival has no doubt figured out for itself, it doesn't
hurt to start growing your own audiences.
* SO how to provide rehearsal space for Ruckblick featuring an
ensemble with several pianos and a harpsichord about their person. Think
laterally. And fix them up, as associate Festival director James Waters
did, with a gig in a piano shop.

angrier, and more serious, while remaining every bit as hilarious.
During his two-night stand Sean demonstrated his complete mastery of the

Chiefly, he took his audience to places they weren't sure they wanted
to go, exploring drug-induced paranoia and self-delusion; male
self-deception; our wilful abandonment of familial obligation. In

SIX friends. A single mum, a bulimic, a TV soap star who's miserable
-- this is Generation ''?'', where some have jobs, others don't and
there's a sense of being Generation Lost, Generation Betrayed,
Generation Unnecessary. There's only one place where it feels right, one
place where they can be happy -- the Klub.
Ignore the beginning which casts a shadow of moody posey-ness over
this production by Frantic Theatre. Once the piece is up and running --
there's a lot of fast, clever movement in Klub -- it takes on an
engaging humanity, full of humour yet tinged with the real despair of
feeling the world doesn't want to know about you, your hopes or your
problems. I went to this because it fitted a time slot on my schedule. I
came away vastly impressed and smiling.

NEWSPAPER as a raw material was carried to its apogee by David Mach in
his 1999 Tramway Paper Parthenon installation where he piled, placed,
and folded several tons of newsprint into massive but immaculate
pillars. After that, it's downhill all the way.
Thus Kiuston Halle, a dancer turned photographer, can't really compete
with her yellowing newspaper cartwheels and big cross bisecting the
French Institute's elegant first-floor gallery. Her curved wall pieces
with their thin film of faint photographs of lobster pots, broken
sculptures or hands stuck across the sheets like large open books or
folio volumes are better, but this show in one of Edinburgh's most
beautiful spaces is really not up to its previous high standards. Till
September 20.

''A TRIBUTE to the guitar greats -- and Bert Weedon,'' promises John
James. And so it proves. Django Rheinhardt, Chet Atkins, Scotty Moore,
Merle Travis, and Doc Watson all appear in spirit. Bert Weedon, too (''I
like that string''). The Rev Gary Davis, who unlike James the Guitar
wasn't Welsh but was --     exaggeratedly casual shrug -- ''OK'', has
his style slowly dissected and explained to make it look effortless.
Then speeded up to sound impossible.
On top of this, James is, in the nicest possible way, nuts. Sandwiched
between Atkins and Rheinhardt, comes a potted history of inventions and
political correctness rolled into one, wherein his between-line drawn
breaths at least give you a fighting chance of working out one pun
before he hits you with the next.

THE Royal Fine Art Commission advises government on the visual impact
and design quality of buildings and roads. As arbiters of quality it
often sees fit to reject projects as not up to the mark. Fair enough.
But this appalling exhibition, which totally lacks direction and basic
information as well as being visually illiterate, makes one reassess
their role. If this is the best the Fine Art Commission can do, God help
us.
Architects will find many reasons for complaint -- but the public will
despair at this jumble of badly displayed photos of Cumbernauld, East
Kilbride, Glenrothes, Irvine, and Livingston which lack labels and
dates, never mind explanation as to the then real vision involved.
Poor Miss Elizabeth Mitchell, who hammered in the first peg in 1948 or

If they could see this dog's breakfast of a show, they would weep.

UNDER-EIGHTS are dancing in the aisles throughout this trans-Scotland
hunt for stolen haggises.
The Happy Gang, alias Beth, Spatz and Mr P, have found a formula that
works and only, for adult eyes, lacks a little polish. They are bright,
cheerful, and far from patronising, giving plenty of chances for the
audience to help them round up the missing animals with the haggis call.
And for the (unfortunate) chaperones, there are plenty of sidelong
nudges and some excellent singing, as well as the knowledge that the
infant beside them is utterly absorbed.

ULSTER Unionist Party leader James Molyneaux is a far tougher and more
passionate advocate of his cause than his deceptively mild-mannered
nature would suggest.
Like all politicians in Ulster he has lived in constant fear of the
assassin's bullet -- in October 1982 he survived two attempts on his
life in one day by the Irish National Liberation Army when he was
elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly.
Molyneaux, a courageous and persistent debater, has never been afraid
to criticise even those on his own side of the ''Irish argument'' if he
feels they are falling short of the Unionist principles which he has
promoted with such conviction, commitment, and fervour.
He has been criticised by some sections of his party for his handling
of the Unionist cause both before and after the announcement of the IRA
ceasefire a year ago. In March he faced a stalking-horse challenge for
the UUP leadership.
He was returned as party leader but the challenger, university student
Lee Reynolds, shook him by snatching one-fifth of the vote -- a clear
sign of unease within the party.
The party's failure in June to win the North Down by-election, which
was caused by the death of Sir James Kilfedder, added to the question
marks around Molyneaux. Independent Unionist Robert McCartney won easily
on a platform criticising weak Unionist leadership in the post-ceasefire
period.
Ulster Unionists were said to have a ''special relationship'' with the
Government and Molyneaux the ear of the Prime Minister. But despite
saving the Government in a number of crucial votes he was unable to halt
the march of the Government's Northern Ireland policy, which Unionists
claim is far too ''green'' for their liking.
He saw his role as that of a general with an army ''that is not making
anything much in terms of territorial gains but has the satisfaction of
repulsing all attacks on the citadel''.
He was vigorously opposed to the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, remaining
a believer in the idea of devolving power to Ulster, believing that this
could provide the basis for reconciliation and goodwill between the
nationalist and Unionist communities.
Molyneaux was ''appalled'' by the 1972 decision to abolish Stormont
and impose direct rule. A few years later he proposed the step-by-step
restoration of Stormont's powers, starting with self-administration.
In 1977 the links with Ian Paisley began to be cut, first over
Paisley's alleged connections with the paramilitaries. Molyneaux also
opposed the extreme Loyalists' strike of that year.
Soon after this he began to show his irritation with the British
Government. He refused Thatcher's invitation to a conference on Northern
Ireland local government in 1979 and boycotted a constitutional
conference the following year.
Then he attacked as a ''monstrosity'' the Thatcher-Garret FitzGerald
intergovernmental council of 1981. Molyneaux's party leadership came
under threat at this time, because of the successes of Paisley's
Democratic Unionists. But Molyneaux clung on.
As far back as 1983 Molyneaux was criticising SDLP leader John Hume
for ''grubbing around the back streets of Belfast'' to meet Sinn Fein
president Gerry Adams. He also denounced the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement
as a ''sell-out''.
As a telling and risky protest against the agreement, he and 14 other
Unionists resigned from the Commons and fought by-elections. He and all
but one other recaptured their seats. And in a further protest against
the agreement he led an illegal march through Belfast and was ''hopping
mad'' when a well-wisher paid his fine to stop him going to jail.
Under his leadership the Ulster Unionists broke their traditional
links with the Conservatives and during the Thatcher and Major regimes
Molyneaux and his colleagues sat on the Opposition benches.
He was highly sceptical of the Downing Street declaration, of
December, 1993, describing it as a ''tortuously-worded statement with
many contradictions''.
Two months later, after numerous demands by Sinn Fein for
''clarification'' of the declaration, Molyneaux claimed it was a
failure, a message he was prepared to deliver ''loud and clear'' despite
protestations to the contrary from Dublin and Whitehall.
But he was not dismissive about the IRA ceasefire of September, 1994,
although he remained cool about the possibility of all-party talks
which, he said, ''accentuate differences instead of reconciling them''.

SCOTTISH Office agriculture Minister the Earl of Lindsay recalled
yesterday how his early training as a landscape architect cut little ice
with his bank manager. Fresh from studying in America he found it
difficult to raise the finance to support his first tentative forays
into his chosen profession.
A lot had happened since then, he said, and caring for the environment
was a tremendous area for young people to be trained in, confident that
there were many circumstances in which their skills could be brought to
bear.
Lord Lindsay was speaking at the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, at
the launch of a new career leaflet for the horticulture industry
produced by ATB Landbase and the Scottish Joint Horticultural Committee.
The Minister pointed out that local authorities were now deeply
interested in the horticultural aspects of almost any planning
application. ''They want to know what trees you are going to plant and
how you are going to plant them,'' he said. The whole question of
management of the environment had become an intensely important subject.
''It has to be looked after very carefully.''
Man's re-arrangement of the environment went far beyond domestic
gardening or public parks, he added. Recent visits had taken him to
Aberfeldy and to the Black Isle where the striking landscapes were
almost entirely ''man-finished''. Farming practice and woodland
management had helped create those landscapes which people were now most
anxious to preserve.
At a different level, he said, landscaping and horticultural skills
had been used to great effect on parts of the M74 and the A9 to make it
look as if these features ''belonged'' where they were. The Meggat
reservoir, in the Borders, was another example of outstanding
landscaping effort.
Dougal Philip, chairman of the joint horticultural committee, spoke of
the need for the horticulture industry to attract young people of
quality. The temporary loss of the traditional apprecticeship had been
followed by an influx of unwilling entrants on YTS schemes, he said.
''We must try to separate horticulture as a career from gardening as a
hobby. Career horticulturists provide a service to society, supplying
plants or advice to the general public or enhancing and maintaining the
environment around us. We need the right calibre of men and women to
choose a career in horticulture.''
Besides the obvious horticulture skills, candidates who were keen to
progress in the industry had to be able to develop their management and
team building, financial awareness and marketing abilities, he said.
The horticulture industry is estimated to have an output worth #70m a
year in terms of plants produced in Scotland and sold in nurseries and
garden centres. It has more than 10,000 employees but is experiencing a
shortage of young recruits. Courses are provided at five centres
throughout Scotland a levels ranging from certificate to HND or BSc.

RUSSIAN soprano Galina Gorchakova not only turned up yesterday, she
proceeded to tear apart her Queen's Hall audience. By the time she
reached her second encore -- when she unleashed her incredible laser
beam of a soprano voice on Puccini's Vissi d'Arte -- there were a lot of
tears trickling down faces (including this one).
Clearly, criticism of Gorchakova's performance yesterday would be a
criminal offence. The raven-haired beauty from Siberia was taken ill at
her earlier Festival appearances with the Kirov Opera, and had to
withdraw. She had bronchitis, and, until the weekend, it was touch and
go whether she would be fit for her celebrity recital yesterday.
The bronchitis is not quite out of the way -- when she stopped to
cough periodically during the concert yesterday, it was quite evident
that she still has a thick throat. But, she reportedly said to the
Festival directors: ''Nothing is going to stop me singing for this
audience.''
And nothing did, in a programme of little-known but mostly gorgeous
Romantic Russian songs, where she was accompanied by the formidable
Larissa Gergieva. Gorchakova was, it's probably fair to say, nursing her
voice a tad, singing at a bit less than full throttle in music by, among
others, Glazunov, Gretchaninov and Rubinstein -- the songs by the last
were superb -- and her intonation was not always dead centre or up to
par.
But there was enough cream in the Gorchakova voice to caress the
lyrics and the tone (especially in a wonderful set of songs by Arensky
which ranged from wistful to ardent). And when she did hit the upper
level of her range, especially those unbelievable top notes, she never
held back and the sound just pinned you to your seat. The intensity in
the near-capacity house was almost tangible. Bronchitis or whatever,
Gorchakova's is one of the truly great voices, and the lady herself is a
star.

SCOTLAND'S travelling families made a crucial contribution to the folk
song revival by passing on their wealth of songs to collectors, and on
Sunday representatives of three of those families made an absorbing and
thoroughly entertaining contribution to this concert series.
Stanley Robertson and Elizabeth Stewart, from Aberdeenshire, and
Sheila Stewart of the famous Blairgowrie Stewarts contrast as much in
character as singing styles. Compared to Robertson's harmlessly
garrulous, windmill-armed delivery (including a lengthy but brilliantly
constructed Laird O' Drum), Elizabeth Stewart was almost mouse-like, her
husky voice and lovely crisp diction all the more effective for
employing simplicity on the potentially melodramatic In London Town.
Sheila Stewart's fearless, free-flowing singing and devil-may-care
presence ensured that I Wonder What's the Matter Wi' A' The Men, for all
its Perthshire patois, crossed all language barriers before our host,
Andy Hunter, in fine voice himself, led a rollicking Beefcan Close in
tribute to the great travelling song source Jeannie Robertson, whose
prefab latterly was, he said, Aberdeen's other university.

SCHUBERT and Dvorak are the Festival's big themes this year, but the
smaller ones, as so often, have been proving no less interesting. A
discreet emphasis on modern European instrumental music, for instance
has yielded nothing but good things including on Saturday a complete
concert of Kurtag.
Seventy next year, Gyorgi Kurtag has only recently begun to be
mentioned in the same breath as Bartok and Ligeti as a Hungarian
composer to reckon with. Yet wherever his music has been heard it has
held audiences enthralled, as the performance of Ruckblick clearly did
at St Bernard's Church (which, incidentally is establishing itself as a
welcoming, comfortable venue, with admirably warm acoustics).
Subtitled Homage to Stockhausen, and featuring two of Stockhausen's
offspring as performers, Ruckblick (or ''Backward Glance'') is a collage
of what Kurtag likes to call musical ''games'' assembled around his
memories of his own music and that of Stockhausen, the premiere of whose
Gruppen he attended in 1958. Much of Kurtag's music being vocal, it
reappears here in instrumental guise, its original lyricism intact, but
presented in fascinating new colours.
Yet, though consisting of some 50 short movements, Ruckblick is not at
all patchy in effect. These are in no sense sound bites, but a
mesmerising extended interweaving of piano pieces, memorials, fragments,
scherzos, and so forth into a sort of private sketch-book.
Thanks to the virtuosity of the playing, however, the effect was not
at all private but very definitely public. Markus Stockhausen proved a
dazzling trumpeter, Majella Stockhausen a gifted pianist. In company
with Peter Riegelbauer a dramatic double bassist, and Marcus Creed,
another fine pianist, they contrived to bring the prism-like timbres of
the music to vibrant life.

Alexander Linklater with chapter and verse on how the Book Festival
confounded the trade's prophets of doom as its popularity soared.
SPEAKING at the Book Festival a week ago two major publishers, Liz
Calder and Robert Gottlieb, agreed that in both Britain and America the
past 10 years have been disastrous for the book trade. The publishing
world, we are told, is in crisis. In Britain a breakdown of the Net Book
Agreement is threatening small presses. The spectre of VAT still looms.
It is hopeless trying to compete with the cultural mass markets of
cinema and pop music. There is a fiction slump.
But if these are the anxieties which lie behind the scenes, there is
almost no reflection of them on the front-line. The Book Festival this
year has been a phenomenal success. Compared to 1993, ticket sales have
risen by 27%, and book sales by 13%. An average of four to five thousand
people have attended daily with an estimated total of 78,000 filling up
some 400 events, of which 113 sold out.
Shona Munro, the festival's director, describes herself as ''tired but
happy''. It is her final year in charge and the legacy she leaves is
further evidence that books are, and must remain, a major feature in
Edinburgh during the Festival. To her sponsors she has proved the
commercial validity of their support, and to commentators the importance
of maintaining an essential catholicity of taste.
For it has undoubtedly been the variety of events at the Book Festival
which has given it vitality. Munro speaks of the necessity of finding
''something for everyone,'' and of bringing books to people who don't
normally read much. So there has been a range of music and comedy and
different ways of confronting writers with their audiences.
Among the normal readings and lectures certain themes have given
structure to the abundance of activity. At first the ''Six of the Best''
series -- in which authors spoke about a handful of books which have
influenced them -- seemed like it might become a forum for trite
generalisation. But this apparently glib formula turned out to be
surprisingly creative. Not only did it elicit some of the most unguarded
expressions of passion from the speakers, but it proved to be an
extremely efficient form of character analysis.
Roy Hattersley, for example, turned out to have utterly conservative
tastes. He revaled a Eurosceptic attitude to literature, having read few
non-English language authors and you could have taken his selection of
classics off a Higher exam paper. Astonishingly erudite, on the other
hand, was fantasy writer Terry Pratchett, who had clearly worked his way
through second-hand book shops at incredible speed and without any
respect for established attitudes.
Presiding in judgment over literature as a whole were the speakers at
a selection of regular lectures. Among others David Daiches, Rose
Tremain, Janice Galloway, and Marina Warner formed a cornerstone of
debate as to the kind of issues which make reading a serious business.
They balanced out the populist side of the festival which has
successfully targeted families and schools.
Children, readers of the future, more than just blended into the
literary scene at Charlotte Square. You didn't have to be a fan of
Kiddie-Lit to recognise the energy and sense of community that their
presence introduced to the general atmosphere. If there is any doubt
that they belong alongside the highbrow events of a book festival then
it is worth noting the words of Yehuda Amichai, perhaps the greatest
writer to read his work in Edinburgh this year:
When I reach the peak of my
visions,
I find myself with everyday
people
Who have children and
work, family cares,
Household chores. These are
my visions.
Amichai's reading represented the peak of the festival's aspirations.
His wise, affirmative commentaries on the political and spiritual
prerogatives for human survival were drawn out of a poetry that tunnels
deep into an experience of exile and war. Backed up by Amichai, Gitta
Sereny's gruelling revelations of Nazi darkness in her discussion of
Albert Speer, and Eric Lomax's struggle to comprehend his wartime
experience of torture at the hands of the Japanese, the festival
continued a tradition of tackling the difficult subjects.
There has also been a healthy dose of controversy. In the first week
Michael Dobbs attacked the BBC for twisting around the adaptation of his
book, Final Cut, to suit their own political ends. Then a few days later
David Sylvester let iconoclasm overcome him and skewered several sacred
cows of the art world, including Lucian Freud and Frank Auerbach.
But this was quickly matched by the inimitable Steven Berkoff who
lashed out at critics, theatrical establishments, and directors with
equal ferocity. Richard Eyre had to appear in front of an audience half
of whom had just heard Berkoff reduce him to the status of an artistic
John Major.
Poetry this year was stronger than it has ever been. Promoters Apples
and Snakes brought the first evidence of a growing performance scene.
Fast and energetic and physical, people like Lemn Sissay and Bertram
Besigye do not rely on the written word to make their impact. But those
who do came across even more clearly in the heightened atmosphere.
Brendan Kennelly, Paul Durcan, W N Herbert, Simon Armitage, James Berry,
and Sheena Blackhall demonstrated how popular serious poetry can become.
However, where the festival fell down heavily was in a lack of
widespread international participation. Four years ago the Neil Gunn
Centenary Conference brought together writers from all around the globe
to discuss vital issues of cultural cross-reference. For three days it
was possible to come into contact with the concerns which drive writers
everywhere. The debates covered nationalism, censorship, immigration,
imagination, and political unrest from Northern Ireland to Yugoslavia.
They lay at the centre of the 1991 festival and gave it shape.
This year the absence of such a forum meant that despite the variety
and energy of events there was little chance of the Book Festival
increasing its reputation abroad.
The advantages of having this kind of international hard core would
extend beyond just its immediate intellectual interest. More writers
would want to travel to Edinburgh merely to attend. The Book Festival
would become more prominent next to the film, music and theatre
festivals. And there would be much less chance of a repetition of this
year's disaster, when Germaine Greer dropped out just because Harold
Bloom couldn't come.
Shona Munro's biggest disappointment was that she couldn't come by the
kind of financial support that would make it possible to create a
regular conference of the 1991 kind. It would require enormous backing.
But what she has proved is that the Book Festival has a base of popular
support which would justify further expansion.
People often talk about the Edinburgh Book Festival as the biggest in
the world. You have to quibble over the difference between a trade fair
and a festival, and whether ''biggest'' means ''most important'' or not.
But there is little doubt that, given the extra support which would make
a serious accumulation of world writers possible, it could become the
most prestigious anywhere. It is something to be fervently hoped for.
It has undoubtedly been the variety of events at the Book Festival
which has given it vitality

CRACK French troops from the Ministry of Culture, with their president
-- the supreme musical tactician of the 20th century -- invaded the
Edinburgh Festival last night and caused a storm. Pierre Boulez and his
outstanding virtuoso performance group, the Ensemble Intercontemporain,
flew in for a single festival date yesterday and laid down the musical
law.
Others do it, some do it well, but nobody -- nobody -- can clarify the
music of the Second Viennese School of composers -- Schoenberg, Berg,
and Webern -- like Boulez, the master of lucidity, and this superb group
of musicians. Boulez, simply, lifts the veil, aerates the music, and
lets it speak its message.
We really shouldn't be surprised: after all, some of this music is
more than 80 years old. But when you think of the sheer mince that many
performers and groups have made of it over the decades (and still do),
then what Pierre Boulez achieves is still vital, still seminal. Yes, his
is an intellectual approach; but that never stands in the way of the
dynamism of the music.
To Webern's Concerto for Nine Instruments he brought not only a
heightened expressivity, but dramatic propulsion. Comprehensively, in
the slow movement, he charted the gradual wind down towards silence. And
never, in the finale, has the snappiness and the wit of the music been
so apparent. Wit in Webern? Mais oui.
The clouds and mysteries dissolved before this outfit, intensely
atmospheric in Webern's Five Pieces, heartbreakingly melancholic in
Berg's Four Pieces for Clarinet and Piano. And they also brought with
them a powerhouse of a mezzo soprano, Nadine Denize, who gave gleaming
and operatically-scaled performances of Mahler's Lieder eines Fahrenden
Gesellen (in Schoenberg's stunning arrangement for chamber ensemble) and
The Song of the Wood Dove from Gurrelieder.
But, in an evening of blistering music-making, the French wizards
saved the best till last, in a sensational, ferociously exciting and
rivetingly articulate account of Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No 1 that
confirmed the work as a masterpiece and the ensemble as a contemporary
group sans pareil. Brilliant.

PROLIFIC playwright John Cargill Thompson wants to set the record
straight about the Biblical figure of Jezebel. I'm sure he's got a point
when he says that the woman whose name has become synonymous with
harlotry was not the degenerate that male-written history has us
believe. But, several millennia after the event, it's hard to work up
much outrage over the injustice.
The monologue is performed by an elegant Porlyn Rhoden who, despite
her crisp delivery and lively energy, does not place enough trust in
Cargill Thompson's script to make the most of the humour of the early
scenes. That coupled with the density of historical fact, make it more
an educative experience than a dramatic one.

IN seeking to establish why gay men fail to learn how to date in their
teens, thus restricting the range and nature of their relationships
later in life, Perrier-nominated charmer Scott Capurro deploys his full
armoury of acid put-downs and explicit coyness. He is impishly funny.
Scott also emphasises many truths. For instance, that gay men understand
straight women better than straight men. That we all, gay or straight,
most fear being left alone -- especially with Lena Horne or a
pre-operative trans-sexual. Whether you're homo or hetero, for
revelatory laffo make a date with Scott at the earliest opportunity.

THIS latest musical by Edinburgh's First Base Theatre really can't
decide what it is up to.
Ostensibly a play about a 70s revival band -- and therefore an excuse
to jam through a load of Gary Glitter, Suzi Quatro and David Bowie
numbers -- it has been lumbered with a poorly constructed and not
especially relevant tale of marital strife between a teacher (bass and
Quatro vocals) and her policeman husband (drums).
You could make allowances for this, the leaden acting and the flagging
pace, if the music was up to much, but as a band, the four performers
demonstrate little feeling for the wild hedonism for their chosen genre.
And not celebrating it, neither are they ironic nor funny about it,
leaving the whole thing in an odd no-man's land that makes you wonder
what made them do it in the first place.

''ONCE upon a time there was a cold, grey land. And into it crept the
faery folk to bring the song of life to its hills.'' That is just what
Kaleidoscope Theatre does. Yarnspinners, an original fairy-tale, tells
of the quest by the factory for the secret of the faery thread which
will not perish.
Exquisite movement combines with music and excellent lighting to weave
a web of magic over audiences, keeping them in their seats motionless
throughout the performance. It is only a programme note which reveals
that half the company suffers from Down's syndrome.
This production needs no sympathy vote however. It should simply be
applauded as quite entrancing theatre, and one of the Fringe's unique
experiences.

REMARKABLY unremarkable, John Shuttleworth is south Yorkshire's master
of middle-aged mundanity. John's life is his art, and his life is his
Y-reg Austin Ambassador; occasional weekend trips to carveries in rural
Derbyshire; his wife, Mary, and his teenage son, Darren, an employee of
Victoria Wine. John also enjoys keeping an eye on reservoir-levels,
checking out holdall prices in shopping arcades, and scaring gangs of
ominous youths away from his carport at night.
One of John's perky songs asks a question: How To Be Happy In A Sad,
Sad World? The answer? Accept that age does not automatically bring
wisdom and be wary of telling every stranger about your new porcelain
bathroom-splashback. Aye, the Shuttleworthian path of enlightenment is
seriously, strangely funny.

A STUMPY, formidable presence on British stages for over a century,
Dame Sybille Thorndyke has lived a life of much drama. Her spitefulness,
her prodigious alcohol-intake and, above all, her stout leatherette
handbag have served her well in battles against such adversaries as
Bertolt Brecht, Sir John Gieldgud, Adolf Hitler, Judy Garland, and
Margaret Thatcher.
Her energetically-shouted memoirs detail all these incidents, plus
many lesser-known ones involving midgets, bared bottoms, and bodily
fluids. NB: It is rumoured that Dame Sybille is related to the roguish
Sean Cullen, of Canadian pranksters Corky and the Juice Pigs, but
frankly I can't believe it.

UNLIKE this year's Perrier judges, the panel of experts at Sunday
night's final of the annual So You Think You're Funny competition for
stand-up newcomers arrived at a verdict with which no-one could quibble.
Motor-mouthed Lancastrian absurdist Lee Mack deservedly joined a
distinguished roster of past SYTYF winners, alongside Phil Kay, Rhona
Cameron and Dylan Moran. Another Scottish contender emerged, too, in the
gangling form of runner-up Joe Heenan. My sole cavil was with third
place for dizzy blonde Geordie beautician Avril Robson; Lucy Porter was
far sharper.
Earlier rounds of the competition had been marred by widespread theft.
One contestant saw nothing wrong in impersonating recent Perrier winner
Lee Evans, using lots of his material, too, while in another heat five
out of the eight contenders appropriated bits of tried-and-trusted
material crafted by other, established comics.
Sunday night's finalists all succeeded by their own efforts. Indeed,
it won't be long before Lee Mack is up there with Sunday's host, Eddie
Izzard. Hopefully, the Gilded Balloon's current nightly Best of SYTYF
show will showcase the young Mr Mack alongside his illustrious
forebears.

THE packed houses are testament to the zealous efforts of the Royal
Stuarts Scottish Performers Guild in drumming up audiences, proving that
their PR stunt of strutting around town in period dress has paid off.
The costumes, lavish recreations of sixteenth-century Scottish attire,
somewhat steal the show and are a real tourist pleaser.
Not so pleasing to the native ear is the group's insistence at
performing in their own tongue. Mary, Queen of Scots, undoubtedly had a
pretty strange accent, with French inflections, but it's somewhat
startling to hear her pant about Lord Darnley in a Californian drawl. It
seems bizarre that a group so committed to historical re-enactment
should overlook such an obvious aspect.
However the play, scripted by Chip Clark, is carefully and
convincingly rooted in authentic detail and commendably manages to offer
a fresh perspective on a well-documented life by having three women
playing Mary simultaneously.

OF all the ebullient hosts of light entertainment -- and there are
some emetic ones about -- there is perhaps none so likeable, or so
highly regarded, as Michael Barrymore. Host of such shows as Strike it
Lucky, Barrymore's love for people, and delight in the company of the
most obscure, is manifest.
Barrymore never patronises his guests. He exudes regard and affection
for them, even as they are the butts of his comedy. He is ordinary,
jovial, unpretentious, supremely natural. In his recent battle with the
bottle, accordingly, Barrymore has had vast reserves of sympathy behind
him.
Over the past 10 days, however, Michael Barrymore has needed it. On a
Friday night in a London pub -- dramatically removing his wedding ring
-- the entertainer reportedly declared to a crowd of delighted
homosexuals that he was, himself, gay. Meanwhile a former aide of
Barrymore's, John Davis, had boasted of past sexual encounters. The
cheaper press, throughout the summer, had relayed tittle-tattle of the
comedian boozing in assorted homosexual haunts.
The weekend was scarcely done when it was confirmed that the Barrymore
marriage was over. Michael and Cheryl would be leading ''their own
personal lives''; his wife of 19 years, however, would remain his
business manager. And, just as the papers now dug delightedly through
the remains -- Barrymore's visits to a sanitorium, various
well-publicised drinking episodes, his workaholic lifestyle, his
estranged mother -- the star decided, finally and publicly, to end all
doubt.
He appeared in the small hours, on a London radio show -- a gay show;
a gay host -- and confirmed all rumours. ''I am gay,'' said Michael
Barrymore, and declared it was ''the best thing I've ever done'' to come
out. He had concealed his homosexuality for the sake of his career, said
the comedian, but -- despite various protestations of regard for his
wife -- he insisted, ''I wanted to take control of my life and think
about me for five minutes.''
So beloved is the star, and so assured is his success in TV ratings,
that this episode is unlikely to do any damage at all to Barrymore's
popular reputation. But it raises certain disturbing questions that are
worth addressing.
In the first place, what does Barrymore mean by love? He says he has
loved his wife from the day they first met; that they love each other
still; that he will love her till the end. But he has left her and,
worse, humiliated her, in the most grotesque and distressing fashion.
Cheryl Barrymore is manifestly heartbroken; so too, is Barrymore's poor
and elderly mother, who has not heard from nor seen her son for five
years.
Does Barrymore declare his undying affection for her too? Well, words
are free, and words are cheap. This is the modern disease: a reduction
of love to attitude, emotion, and so much sentiment. Real love is
ethical and real love treats people in a loving way. Real love is always
outwardly expressed, even when our hearts are far from it.
Further, Barrymore's spectacular declaration forces our attention, yet
again, to homosexuality. The gay lobby can scarcely believe their luck.
A new star has joined their ranks and not a stereotypical flounce, like
Larry Grayson; not a barbed lounge-lizard, like Noel Coward; not such a
glorious pansy as Julian Clary; not even such a manifest lump of evil as
the late Derek Jarman, but a popular, straight-acting, wholesome family
entertainer. And the gay lobby will make the most of it.
The natural spin of course, is that Barrymore has ''discovered
himself,'' decided to stop living a lie and so on, ad nauseum. How valid
is this? Wrong, and wrong on every central point, for it is a view
founded in fallacy.
First: homosexuality is a lifestyle, not a condition into which we are
born as we are born black or white or Jewish. The concept of an
exclusively homosexual ''orientation'' is, in fact, most modern, and
examples in pre-twentieth century history are hard to find. The reality
is that Barrymore is not a homosexual, but is a man at present troubled
with homosexual feelings, and now driven to resolve them by assuming
homosexual identity.
Second: the homosexual life is unnatural, dangerous, and evil. It is a
lifestyle remarkable in its practice -- as has been borne out by study
upon study -- for promiscuity, instability, neurosis, substance-abuse,
and suicide, untold depths of degradation and misery and self-loathing.
It is a way in which men, physically and psychologically, are simply not
equipped to live. It may seem a very easy way at present to Michael
Barrymore -- easier, perhaps than addressing the ills of his marriage,
or the wider roots of his alcoholism, or his need for fame and adulation
-- but it will end, in the next world if not in this, in his utter
destruction.
Third: why in our age, do we so prize honesty over truth? In our art,
in our culture, in our cinema -- courtesy of Kelman, Bacon, Lynch, and
all their kind, we esteem meticulous realism, even if it be obscene,
horrific, demonic, depraved, profoundly and permanently pessimistic.
Michael Barrymore, and I, and you, all have a disease. That disease is
called sin. It is an innate warping of our nature, a blinding of our
faculties, a built-in bias that pulls us all to the egotistical, the
violent, the proud, and the wrong.
Families, society, civilisation itself are human institutions evolved
to address this problem, to engender emotional restraint and self
discipline, enforced by sore sanctions. But in our personal lives we
need all to be aware of our capacity for wickedness and for
self-destruction. Are Barrymore's eyes really open to what he has done?
And is he really aware of the consequences of the step he has taken?
Honesty has its place. We all have problems, conflicts, terrible
fears, and temptations; we all have sexual drives. We are not to ignore
these, to pretend they do not exist. But we have to control them and, if
necessary, deny them.
Those who struggle with forbidden desires, those forced to address,
indeed, homosexual urges, and who are persuaded that expression of these
is absolutely and in all circumstances wrong -- folk have little place
for them today. I know of such. The sophisticated world would laugh at
them. Few friends they have to trust. The very church itself, decadent
and un-Christianlike as it has become, would recoil from them. But
theirs, in the end, is lasting fame and glory. Theirs is the Kingdom of
Heaven.

IN what might be his gravest miscalculation yet Gary Hart, man of
gaffes and self-destructing Democrat, is contemplating one more bid for
the American Senate. He is the former politician whose two attempts to
win the Presidency were felled by that oldest of man's follies,
woman-trouble. But today Hart judges that the electorate is not only
more broad-minded than 12 and eight years ago, it is also suffering from
scandal-fatigue.
Where, one wonders, has he been hiding? Even exiled to the dull vistas
of an industrial lawyer's office, he must be aware of America's
accelerating lurch to the right. The country may be scandal-tired but
that is not at all the same as being scandal-tolerant, and already the
Republicans are rattling and rolling out the skeletons in his closet.
In 1984 Hart had turned a dazzling smile towards that desk in the Oval
Office only to have it severely blemished by his wife's disclosure that
their marriage had twice reached breaking point, and anyway she detested
politics and the prospect of incumbency in the White House. Four years
later, again out in front as the Democratic candidate in the
presidential race, Hart curiously instigated his own downfall by
taunting the press into a cat-and-mouse chase which ended with their
discovery of him in the arms of a ditzy blondette called Donna Rice.
Other than the angst and lust of middle life (Rice was almost 20 years
Hart's junior), what compelled him to behave so disastrously? Contempt
for prying journalism and the moral rectitude demanded of public figures
was part of it. But was Hart also inveterately unreliable? After all,
this was a man who had earlier been devious about his age, and shifty,
too, about the fact that he was born not Hart but Hartpence.
Still, reinvention has always been the stuff of American ambition and
today here he is, aged 58, telling the Denver Post that he wants to win
back his old Colorado seat (now occupied by a Republican), by waging a
campaign about issues, not sleaze. Such high-mindedness may count for
nothing, however, because during his years in obscurity Colorado has
changed greatly from the days when Hart knew it as a liberal state. Last
March one of its senators, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, turned his back on
the Democrats to become a Republican, realising that Colorado is now so
conservative in outlook and demands any Democrat was going to have a
tough time winning in next year's election race.
It seems certain, then, that many voters would be reluctant to root
for a candidate once accused of adultery. Even now Colorado's Republican
Party chairman is reminding people of that photograph of Donna Rice
perched erotically on Gary Hart's lap. ''It will be on every billboard
in this state,'' the chairman threatens. ''We will see to that.''
So, well in advance of the 1996 presidential campaign, dirty tricks
are on the boil, raising the temperature of scrutiny on all candidates,
not least of whom is the President himself. Last time round Bill Clinton
may have defied those who were out to ruin him for his past marital
infidelity. Against the odds he managed to regain the women's vote
because of his commitment to abortion, equality, and social harmony.
But his hampered progress and personal indecision on domestic matters
have left many with feelings of betrayal. As a result those politicians
who exploit others' sins of the flesh, no matter how ancient, may
effectively control the electorate's mood.
''A politician,'' mused the wife of a former American President,
''should be born a foundling and remain a bachelor.'' Beneath her
patient and adoring gaze Lady Bird Johnson managed to disguise any
scorching resentment about LBJ's recurring peccadilloes. But an
unmarried President would be unthinkable in the States. More than ever,
America is fragmenting into a society where family stability seems
irreparably damaged by serial divorce and, at national level, this is
contributing to a profound sense of failure.
In this situation the country's First Citizen must have a First
Partner, a surrogate royal to initiate good deeds and show the world,
via visiting heads of state, that for all its loud-mouthed aggression
and disintegrating standards America still aspires to wholesome values
and sophisticated chitchat over presidential dinners.
But extreme demands for virtue in high places may cause politicians to
end up with no private life at all. Meanwhile should Gary Hart indeed
run for the Senate we can be sure that dubious investigators will spend
next year dragging out those old, incriminating snapshots which allow
the rest of us a moralistic flourish as we leer down Donna Rice's
cleavage.

THE Scottish business community was a prime source of recruits to the
No camp last time Scotland got into an inconclusive lather over home
rule. Now a significant segment of that same business community appears
to have a devolution crisis all of its own making.
Lex Gold is quitting his post as director of CBI Scotland after just
18 months, the third director to depart in quick succession since the
organisation was robbed, through his premature death, of John Davidson's
high-profile presence and tireless appetite for lobbying.
Sure-footed and articulate, Gold, together with outgoing CBI Scotland
chairman John Ward, has done much to rehabilitate the employers'
organisation's waning influence north of the Border, after a lacklustre
interregnum. But his swift departure, coinciding as it does with the end
of Ward's fixed term, threatens to plunge the organisation back into a
period on the far margins of influence.
Part of the problem is that the CBI is a UK organisation, run from the
infamous Centrepoint tower block on London's Tottenham Court Road, with
centralist assumptions to match those which would not be misplaced in
the most myopically metropolitan mandarin. Although its departing
director-general Howard Davies was much too shrewd and quick-witted to
give the game away in public -- some of us still relish his storming
toast to Caledonia which quite put Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown's
Immortal Memory in the shade at this year's Strathclyde region Burns
Supper -- Davies has not managed to resolve the implications of the fact
that, in the Confederation (sic!) of British Industry, too, Scotland is
different.
Gold was, in effect, expected by the wider Scottish community to play
the Howard Davies role within Scotland. That he did, with the same
tireless enthusiasm of a John Davidson. But, in the eyes of the
Centrepoint bureaucracy, Gold was on little more than #30,000.
He could probably afford to do the job as a loss leader, thanks to a
healthy severance package after a long career in the Civil Service and,
latterly, with Scottish Enterprise. But, as CBI Scotland starts the
search for a successor, you know what they say about peanuts and
monkeys.
There is, however, a deeper point to all of this than grubby salary
differentials. If business organisations cannot resolve the issue of
Scotland's distinctiveness in the way they manage their own affairs, it
is not surprising that they bolt below the parapet every time anyone
tries to engage them in dialogue over the wider constitutional debate.
That failure of the Scottish business community to participate in a
sustained way in debating the home rule issue is symptomatic of a wider
malaise.
At its extremes, there is a latent and debilitating schizophrenia.
Scottish business leaders eagerly promote their Scottishness as a
marketing edge on the one hand -- and stand on the Murrayfield terraces
at each home international belting out Flower o' Scotland with the best
of them -- but, depressingly, some go on to threaten wholesale
relocation of their operations south of the Border, if as much as a
toothless equivalent of a toon cooncil is proposed to sit on Calton
Hill.
Some otherwise highly intelligent men -- Scottish business is probably
even more male dominated at the very top than its English equivalent --
betray a stunning ignorance of even the bare fundamentals of the
constitutional debate. Indeed, as a rule of thumb, there seems more
informed awareness the further down the tree you go, into the small
business community.
Last week there was just a hint that the malaise may be crumbling at
the edges. Scotland's Chambers of Commerce issued a challenge to the
political parties to improve the level of representation business
currently enjoys with Government north of the Border. There was a
particular challenge to Labour, coinciding with plans for a new survey
of members' attitudes to devolution, to give business its rightful place
in the process.
Of course the Chambers of Commerce are jockeying for influence in a
crowded market-place, where more and more representative bodies, from
the Institute of Directors to the Forum of Private Business, seek to
grow their membership lists representing this or that section of the
Scottish business community.
Inevitably organisational self advancement is every bit as much at
play here as any desire to get a surer hand on the levers of power. But
the Scottish Chambers' willingness to embark on meaningful political
debate is at least a start.
If Scottish business wants to be treated seriously in this process it
cannot come to the table with any preconceived partisan prejudices. If
it wants representation as the money making voice of the Tory Party the
adventure will assuredly fail.
It is time that Scottish business made its constructive voice more
clearly heard on devolution and a host of other issues. For too long,
there has been an assumption that these concerns can be dealt with
through the informal networking process -- in black tie, across endless
dinner tables -- which so dominates the winter evenings of so many in
the business community.
I have long thought that a country's economic success is probably in
inverse proportion to the number of formal dinners its business elite
attends. The same is possibly true of its ability to influence the
political process.
If business wants a clearer representative voice in the way this
country is heading we need, from it, a more mature consideration of the
issues and an open-minded willingness to become involved, without prior
prejudice, in shaping outcomes. The CBI could help by recognising that,
within its own structure, Scotland is not just another regional office.

THE battle for self-determination is hotting up. First, the Diary is
in receipt of the programme for the SNP's sixty-first annual national
conference -- at Perth, just for a change -- complete with traditional
tri-lingual greeting from national convener Eck Salmond (''Ower the lest
echtein munth, the SNP haes focht five sindrie election campaigns . .
.'') and a full menu of radical proposals designed to bring independence
that little bit nearer.
Even among Nationalists, however, the paths of glory are not ever
smooth. Campbeltown branch lobs in the motion, ''Recognising that many
party members cannot attend an annual conference from Wednesday to
Saturday and to ensure that future conferences are more representative
of the total membership, it is agreed that future annual conferences be
held on a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.''
Up pops Lochaber branch, plainly staunch Sabbatarians to a patriot:
''Amendment a) Delete 'Friday, Saturday and Sunday' and insert
'Thursday, Friday and Saturday'.
What a difference a day makes. Or as the old Billy Connolly song had
it, ''And will ye start the revolution on a Saturday, for ah huv to work
through the week . . .''
Bowled over
ITEM two, designed to launch the fight-back against neo-colonialist
curs everywhere and perhaps even launch a fringe event of its very own,
arrives as a small gift from our old friends at the Scottish Republican
Socialist Party. A T-shirt, no less, complete with eloquent motto and
wee saltire. ''I Failed the English Cricket Test'', it asserts. This is
very true, and ideal for bewildering tourists from around the world.
Given that the Diary has also passed the Pepsi Challenge, the Guinness
Test, the Mutton Pie Quiz, and the Polyunsaturated Fats Poser, we are
pleased to report the thing appears to fit. What we have failed thus far
to find is the little label on the shirt that says ''Made in Scotland''.
Must be there somewhere.
Twice the fun
WHAT larks. An item in the Scotsman, a newspaper, has lots of fun with
the fact that its very own film writer Brian Pendreigh, in covering a
Steve Martin press conference, predicted someone, somewhere, would
deploy the line ''Hollywood came to Edinburgh yesterday''.
Sure enough, we did, to the evident amusement of an Edinburgh nom de
plume named ''Boswell''. ''Step backward,'' he says, ''the Herald, still
proving that 'quality' is easier said than done.''
It is not, of course, for us to point out that the Scotsman enjoyed
its fabulously funny tale so much it printed two versions of it on the
very same day, once in the broadsheet section of the paper and again in
its unmissable Festival supplement.
Never mind the quality, boys and girls, feel the width -- or is that
''gulf''?
Big ideas
SPEAKING of width, we were terrifically pleased to note from a recent
advertisement that Cellulitex Ltd of Edinburgh are doing well. It seems
the company, dealing in the latest techniques for removing ugly
cellulite ''instantly, painlessly, and non-invasively'', have
opportunities in all areas for ''consultants''.
Is there any real point in adding that the demon flab-fighters are a
''rapidly expanding'' company?
Barking mad
THE Isle of Lewis, CalMac's splendid new ferry, is recommended to us
as the only way to travel -- if you're a dog. Harassed parents report
that there is more space for canines on board the all-new (save for the
menus) boat than there is for bairns. Accommodation for dugs is
described as spacious, nay luxurious, but that for the little darlings
somewhat less so. This either tells us something very important about
Lewis, about CalMac, or about the sort of weans who cross the watter
under maximum security.
Meanwhile, we hear that the boat itself, though very pretty to look
at, has encountered a little difficulty keeping to its schedule. This,
it is alleged, has more than a little to do with berthing arrangements,
described by one survivor as ''trying to fit a very big backside into a
very wee chair''.
Look back in anger
JANET Street-Porter's MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh
International Television Festival was as combative as one might have
expected, with the doyenne of ''yoof'' television lambasting this, that,
and the next thing beginning with ''M'' (middle-class, middle-brow,
middle-aged, male, and so forth) that came to mind. We are grateful,
then, to the trade paper Broadcast for recalling one of Street-Porter's
previous festival interventions. ''People who work in television,'' she
said, ''are all too old''.
That was in 1982, of course, when we were all a lot younger, Dame
Janet, still busy as ever, certainly not least. Who said middle-aged?
The last blast
WITH anniversaries of utterly insignificant sixties events all around
us -- a comment, we cannot help but feel, on just how fascinating and
creative the nineties have been -- we are glad to report that Dr Timothy
Leary continues to prove that all those funny drugs never did anyone any
harm ever.
The man who instructed us all to ''turn on, tune in, and drop out''
has just announced he is ''thrilled'' to be dying. Like, wow.
Afflicted with an entirely unfunny prostate cancer, the one-time
counter-culture guru and full-time career fruit-cake asserts that he has
''entered into the real challenge of how to live an empowered life . .
.'' by, er, dying.
This, we can't help but feel, may be to miss the point more than
somewhat, but it was ever thus with the Doc. For your information, he
adds that there is a ''real possibility'' he will take LSD again before
he dies but hasn't yet done so.
One logical explanation for his ravings is therefore ruled out.

THE Labour Party pursue quangos with all the zeal of the toffs
pursuing the luckless grouse and if the quangos that survive happen to
be the ones with Labour majorities that is proof of the rightness of
things.
They have their sights trained, once again, on the House of Lords --
the quango of all quangos. Only the fact that they would blow away
Labour peers and close forever the magic trail of honours lists,
knighthoods, and preferential treatment makes them hold their fire.
After all, where would ageing Socialists go?
All this smokescreen enables them to obscure the fact that they daily
live to defend the most undemocratic decision taken by the most
perfidious quango of them all, the signatories of the Treaty of Union.
The people had no say in the matter; indeed women had no say in
anything until over 200 years later.
The Campaign for a Scottish Assembly, at the moment deciding the shape
of the puppet parliament for Scotland, is itself a quango, unelected,
but speaking in the name of the people. Conceived in the minds of a
lordly quango 258 years ago, Scotland's entrapment is about to be
ratified by a non-elected quango of the proletariat.

JOHN Macleod writes a disturbing melange of well-argued historical
analysis and xenophobic prejudice (August 26). If the Reformation's most
striking effect was to release people from their chains, then John
Macleod has done a good job of shackling himself anew.
The Renaissance and the Reformation indeed challenged the religious
view that life weas a mystery best left unquestioned, and the results
were a freeing of philosophy, politics, science, and medicine. But to
ponder over the collapse of the ''sons of light'' (Presbyterians) in the
face of the ''sons of darkness'' (Roman Catholicism, Europe, the
National Lottery) is to undervalue the wisdom of God.
The point about the reformed Church is that it should be always
reforming, always setting the world free. So let's spend less time being
mesmerised by the horror stories of the past, and recognise instead our
own failures in the present. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today,
and for ever -- but nothing else is.
Ecumenism, I suspect, is close to synonymous in John Macleod's mind
with the ''new paganism''. But a true endeavour for understanding among
the Churches, recognising clearly what still divides us, and repenting
sincerely for all the dark periods in our histories, can only increase
the impact of the gospel on our largely unchurched society.
In those terms, why should not Reformed Scots be happy to applaud the
joy of Roman Catholic brothers and sisters over Thomas Winning's red
hat?

MANY of John Macleod's observations are accurate and informing (August
24). Traditional Presbyterianism has lost its hold on Scottish society
and we are indeed heading backwards as well as forwards into Europe-wide
corruption. greed, and superstition.
But he provides no answers, preferring to bemoan long irrelevant
schisms and failings in our supposed national church. What are we all
meant to do? Go to Presbyterian churches which have lost their function
as places of genuine worship?
Most of them are utterly dead: we know that. The historical failure of
Presbyterianism for generations stems from a lack of relevance as well
as from a lack of love and power, qualities of God which cannot be
recaptured easily by any church.
We have seen very recently from the cultic antics of the Church of
England in Sheffield, no doubt copied elsewhere, that it's not enough to
try desperately to be relevant.
The answer lies in Christian churches and individuals, Protestant,
Catholic, Non-conformist, who welcome the Holy Spirit and with Him. His
power and love which can meet the needs of everyone in our despairing
country.
Are we not all floating about unanchored, looking for Something? True
Christianity and its Triune God is hard to find but found by those
churches and individuals who take the time and trouble required.

JOHN Macleod displays a depressingly high level of historical
illiteracy in his claim that ''it was largely the Reformation that made
Scotland a nation state''. Whether he likes to admit it or not, it is
undoubted fact that the medieval Scottish Catholic Church was a key
element in the ultimately successful struggle for Scottish independence
in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries under Wallace and
Bruce.

THE Herald is noted for its unbiased view so it can surely be no great
shock to James Faulds that there are things in the paper's content with
which he disagrees (August 26). I for one was not offended by the
inclusion of a leaflet on Transcendental Meditation.
As far as I know, Christianity and TM are not mutually exclusive
but even if I am wrong I am sure the vast majority of readers are
sufficiently broad-minded and intelligent neither to take exception to,
nor be unduly swayed by, the little brochure.

IT was with both interest and a sense of disbelief that I read your
report covering the Scottish Chambers of Commerce assertion that
business in Scotland was not adequately represented in either local or
national government (August 21), and that as the ''premier
representatives of the business community'' they should be co-opted on
to local authority sub-committees and LEC boards.
I would challenge the notion that Scottish business is not presently
consulted. The Federation of Small Businesses has, for instance,
recently met with the new Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, at his
request, I might add. This follows a good working relationship with Ian
Lang.
We have also met in recent months George Kynoch, Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, George Robertson, Helen Liddell, Jim Wallace, Henry
McLeish, and Alex Salmond.
These people cover a cross-section of political opinion in Scotland
and we value all opinions no matter the political flavour as I am
assured they value ours. We also work closely with the Scottish Tourist
Board, STUC, Cosla, Scottish Enterprise, and local authorities. In most
cases we are invited into the consultation exercise. All of this gives
the lie to the Chambers' claim that business is not represented.
The Chambers once again raise the hoary old chestnut of compulsory
business registration, with the Chambers being the organisation to run
it. Compulsory business registration, or Statutory Chambers as it is
often known, is a barrier to free enterprise and must never be allowed
to come into force.
In reality it actually means that if you wish to run a business you
would have to register with a local registry which, if it was the
Chamber, would be in a position to pick and choose what business could
be registered, a very clear case of vested interest.
If the Scottish Chambers are so keen to influence political opinion
perhaps they would do well to support some of the current issues. Rail
privatisation, for example, as even the local Lochaber Chamber could not
elicit help from the Scottish Chamber. They might also tackle
differences in business rates valuations between Scotland and England.

IT is ironic that Sandy Lindsay should choose to use as evidence of
Scotland's colonial status the game of cricket, which is one area where
Scotland can now claim to be genuinely independent (August 24).
Cricket is played in Scotland (and elsewhere) by thousands of
Scotsmen, and there are countless other Scots who take an interest as
spectators, readers, listeners, or viewers.
Mr Lindsay would be a brave and arguably a foolish man if he were to
attempt to impose his prejudices on the inhabitants of, for example,
Freuchie.

THE sudden resignation of Mr James Molyneaux from the leadership of
the Ulster Unionist Party was fully in the character of that stubborn
and secretive man. The party must now find a replacement who will
reconcile its persistent internal differences, or at least reduce them
to manageable proportions in the difficult times ahead. It is clear that
the UUP will have difficulty finding another man like James Molyneaux:
what is not clear is whether it wants another man like him. That is not
to disparage the retiring leader. He has done many remarkable things in
his long years in office, not least the support he gave to the
eventually doomed Government of Mr James Callaghan.
Nevertheless, Mr Molyneaux's style has irritated some of his
supporters. His conditional support for Mr Major's efforts on Northern
Ireland, and indeed Mr Major's Government, was tactical and designed to
maintain influence on Government thinking, but his critics point to what
is seen as the British Government's excessively ''green'' tinge on these
matters. The loss of the North Down by-election did not help.  If the
UUP believe that Mr Molyneaux's policies have failed they would be
foolish to elect to the leadership a man who would give them more of the
same. Yet of the probable candidates for the post the one believed to be
annointed by Mr Molyneaux is the colourless William Ross, who is on the
most sceptical wing of the party on the subject of the Downing Street
Declaration. Mr Ross neatly illustrates another dilemma for the UUP,
which is that the most popular leaders with the general public are not
best regarded within the party.
A recent poll showed Ken Maginnis to be by far the most popular UUP
MP. He was followed by David Trimble who, absurdly but actually by
deepest calculation, believes that he is too young at 50 to stand, and
then by the Rev Martin Smyth whose position as Grand Master of the
Orange Lodge may, or may not, be an advantage. The UUP is split
basically between those who wish to progress cautiously with the current
exploration of peace and those who insist that it is fruitless. Of the
former Mr Maginnis and Mr Taylor are the most acceptable but there are
other nuances here. Mr Molyneaux hints mischievously that the Tory
Government may not last its term; Mr Major's worries may be about to
multiply.

IT is one thing for your TV reviewer, Ian Bell (August 19) and Sandy
Lindsay (Letters, August 23) to tell us of their dislike of cricket, a
view evidently not shared by their many compatriots who play or follow
the game, but quite another for them to express their racism.
Astonishingly, Mr Lindsay claims that Ian Bell's ignorant xenophobia
showed ''deep insight into the mentality of the English''. What on earth
is that mentality? Who indeed are the ''English''? Substitute for
''English'' any of ''Scots'', ''Jews'', ''blacks'', ''Irish'',
''Serbians'', or countless other adjecives and you see something of the
danger of this sort of crude stereotyping.
I must admit that I like cricket. But I loathe racism, wherever it
comes from and however much it dresses itself up with cant about ''our
colonial status'', even more.

IT is not the tedium of cricket which annoys me but the
ever-repetitive tedious criticism of the game. Cricket is a game of two
codes, the traditional three (now four) day and Test Match (five day)
contest. That arena is for the purists -- not to be confused with the
bustling limited-over contest. Certainly no tedium or boredom arises in
these contests -- only a definite result.
Cricket as played in Scotland generally relates to limited overs.
While admittedly not a show-stopper, it is probably the most
participant-involved summer team game played.
It can also boast a broad spread of multi-racial players, surely an
opportunity not to be discounted in promoting goodwill and harmony among
all our citizens.
Long may the ebb and flow of summer's pleasant game continue. As with
our Scottish summer, the season is all too short.

JUST, fair, speedy, understandable, certain, and responsive to the
needs of the people who use it. These are the qualities of an ideal
civil justice system identified by Lord Woolf in his green paper Access
to Justice. He has highlighted a number of faults in the English system,
but you do not have to search very hard to find the same flaws here.
According to Lord Woolf, civil justice is too slow, too complicated, too
expensive, and the outcome of cases too uncertain. Cases are run by the
competing sides and court rules are either ignored or not enforced.
Assuming that you can afford to venture inside the door of the court at
all, litigation is all too often a contest between unequal foes -- rich
and powerful vested interests ranged against someone struggling to meet
the cost of a legal aid contribution.
The diagnosis of Lord Woolf, and the remedies he proposes for the
sickly patient, would have found great favour with Lord Morton of Shuna.
Before his untimely death, and along with Lord Gill, Lord Morton did
much to focus attention on the flaws of the Scottish system and what
could be done to give it a sharp kick into the next century. Some
improvements have already been made. Lord Penrose is dispatching
complicated cases at an impressive rate in the commercial court; lessons
for ordinary cases can certainly be learned from that. There is also
little doubt that Lord Cullen, who is conducting a Woolf-type exercise
in the Court of Session, albeit on a smaller scale and tighter
timetable, will benefit from the exercise south of the Border. He will
have to address himself to many of the issues tackled by Lord Woolf, the
crucial one being whether we should give the court much greater control
over the way cases are conducted. This would mean a radical change from
the present arrangement where judges are passive spectators largely
unable to influence events and circumvent delay. His guiding principle
should be that the court system must be run for the benefit and
convenience of the public who use it rather than for lawyers. Scotland
needs a speedy, economical, reliable, and just system of civil justice
and the current debate as to how we achieve it is welcome, if overdue.

YOUR report about the Government plan to send young offenders to the
Military Corrective Training Centre at Colchester was shallow (August
25). Had your reporter spent 10 minutes doing some research he would
have found there is much to commend in the work of the MCTC.
Soldiers who return to their units from Colchester do so fitter,
smarter, better trained, and often with the problems which caused them
to offend in the first place successfully dealt with. Above all, the
system helps them to regain their self-respect.
Many of those sent to Colchester are discharged into civilian life.
The training they receive is appropriate to a future as a civilian. Such
treatment is entirely relevant to the problems of dealing with young
offenders.
By dismissing the idea in such a trivial way and calling in aid Labour
politicians, the Prison Officers' Association, the Council for Civil
Liberties, and the rest of the politically correct for their instant
reaction, your reporter does nothing for your claim to be a serious and
reputable paper.
Finally the report contains the usual ration of cliches. The term
''glasshouse'' would not be recognised by many of today's young
soldiers. It refers to military prisons, the last of which was closed
more than 30 years ago.
Equally the use of the term ''boot camp'' is just as irrelevant. Boot
Camp is an American term, synonymous with bullying, brutality, and the
sadistic treatment of young people, none of which should or does form
part of the Government's plans for the treatment of young offenders.
If you are to be a newspaper dedicated to criticism of the Government,
at least you should do it on the basis of facts.

Over the next few days the heads of our secondary schools will receive
three copies of a weighty, 4in-thick volume which sets out the draft
frameworks for the courses their fifth and sixth-year pupils will follow
from 1998 onwards. That will wipe the smile from their faces, should
they drift into a fleeting daydream of recent happy times in the Algarve
or Florida. It would be wrong, however, to over-react to this latest
publication, daunting though it may appear at first sight. This is not a
time for jerking the knee or bellyaching about more bumph from the
Scottish Office. This tome represents a commendable attempt to solve the
many problems in the upper secondary school arising from the fact that
the present Highers are unsuitable for many of the increasing numbers of
youngsters staying on beyond 16. It sets out the framework for the way
short units of learning and courses -- both academic and vocational --
should be organised as we head to the millennium. It is intended for
heads and the principal teachers of departments. It is a consultation
document, a critically important point which is underscored by the fact
that seminars will shortly be organised throughout the country to
encourage feedback from department heads and their counterparts in
further education colleges.
The Scottish Office has already shown that it will listen, first in
its response to the criticisms of the original Howie report, most
recently in agreeing to a one-year delay in the implementation of Higher
Still to take account of the work involved in writing new courses. Now,
even the names for the awards themselves and the levels at which they
will be made are up for grabs, in consultative terms.
The documentation released yesterday proposes the release of more time
for the teaching of courses, shorter final examinations, and greater
emphasis on pupil assessments made by teachers. Higher Still is about
giving all pupils the opportunity to achieve as much as they can across
a broad range of subjects. It does not have all the answers, especially
in relation to sixth year, but it is a genuine attempt at offering fair,
attainable, and meaningful targets for the increasingly disparate group
of fifth and sixth-year pupils. The profession should respond,
positively and responsibly.

I AM at a loss to understand why we need military prisons (August 25).
Surely if one is guilty of a criminal offence meriting a prison
sentence, he/she can be dismissed from the Services and prosecuted in
civil life in a civil court?
We do not have prisons dedicated to convicted teachers, lawyers,
doctors, midwives, nurses, shop assistants, unemployed people, business
people, or politicans. Why for soldiers?

TONY ARMSTRONG meets a man who enjoys life in the slow lane
THE young man has dark curly hair, earrings, and a weather-beaten
face. As his horse crops the grass of a lay-by he carries out some minor
maintenance on the immaculate canvas-covered caravan while the kettle
bubbles, suspended from a tripod over the open wood fire.
Glen Wilson may look every inch a Romany but he is, in fact, the son
of Joe Wilson, Labour Euro-MP for North Wales. While his father tramps
the corridors of power in Brussels, 31-year-old Glen has chosen another
route, currently plodding along the lanes of Scotland looking at the
world between the ears of his horse Kes.
It is a world moulded to the pace and needs of a quietly creative
individual who left school as a dyslexic 16-year-old, worked in a
garage, ran his own furniture-stripping business and finally decided to
head off in the gypsy caravan he had built when his marriage ended two
years ago.
For the past 18 months he has been based near the Berwickshire village
of Gordon, living winter and summer in the caravan and working in a tree
nursery where his ordered mind and rapid mastery of Latin variety names
quickly impressed his boss. He was heading south towards Shropshire to
see his son who is eight, and then probably into Wales.
His progress started with a gentle four or five miles a day while Kes,
sleek and a little tubby on pasture grass, got used to daily life
between the shafts and builtup his muscle power. When he was ''run in''
there were good days of up to 20 miles. But the key factor in deciding
when to call a halt to the day's trek is finding good grazing and water.
Mostly Glen is camping on some grassy verge but sometimes he is
invited into a field. ''There are times when you are treated like
royalty by farmers or landowners who are really interested and
welcoming. Other times people don't want to know. Mostly it is assumed
that I am a true Romany and I don't say otherwise.''
The seeds of Glen's present lifestyle were planted when he made
friends with gypsies as a child during conventional family caravan
holidays at Portmadoc in Caernarvonshire. ''They've left the place where
they used to camp,'' says Glen. ''Most of them are in council houses now
but I learnt a lot from them and I still go to visit.''
Glen acquired his first gypsy caravan in his twenties after graduating
from a traditional two-wheel horsedrawn cart and tent, and then set to
work on his present vehicle, completely rebuilding it around the
salvaged metalwork and wheels of an old one. The result is an authentic
gypsy caravan, immaculately painted in maroon and cream and topped with
a hooped green canvas cover.
Glen's home has a floor space 9ft by 5ft with cupboards, iron
wood-burning stove, seats and a single bed that pulls out to make a
double. Lighting is by paraffin lamp and candles and ''kitchen''
equipment includes a shining metal kettle, bucket, two bowls and two
pans and a few plates and cups.
There is, of course, no double glazing or insulation to combat the
Borders winter. But Glen says: ''It is roasting hot even in January.
People regularly ask me over to their houses thinking I am having a hard
time, but I often find their homes cold.''
Glen cooks inside in winter and on a fire outside in the summer. In
this simple and compact environment traditional gypsy couples raise
large families. ''People don't realise how little time was actually
spent in the caravan,'' says Glen. ''The kids slept in a tent or
underneath the caravan. Most of the time the outside world was their
living room.''
On the road Glen is surrounded by an animal menagerie. In addition to
Kes -- who was trained by an old gypsy friend in Telford -- a cage
beside the driver's seat contains a yellow canary. At the back in
another cage are two white ferrets called Little Sally and Sexy Susie.
In a coop beneath the caravan is a cockerel called Lionel and two hens
which will produce eggs along the way. The collection is rounded off by
a Lurcher bitch called Daisy.
Of the months that stretch ahead Glen says: ''It takes a few days to
get settled into a pattern and after that your priorities become finding
good water and grazing for the horse, and firewood for cooking. I take
some tinned food with me and Daisy does some hunting for both of us. For
money, I'm using a bit that I saved up during the winter and top it up
by doing casual work along the way. I don't rely on the DSS.''
The image may be one of plodding peacefully along but Glen says the
driving can be stressful. ''Main roads are actually OK because there is
plenty of room and visibility and Kes is 100% safe in traffic, but small
country lanes can be a nightmare. You have to think three steps ahead
because you can't see round the corners. Oncoming cars or others coming
up fast behind don't expect to meet something moving so slowly and I've
had a few near misses. It may seem idyllic but a horse isn't like a car.
It has its own reactions and you can't reach out and switch off the
ignition.''
Glen's resourcefulness and manual dexterity probably have their roots
in the dyslexia that saw him leave school with a reading age of seven.
His mother June explains: ''Although he reads pretty well now, he
realised early that he would have to get by without some areas of
conventional learning.
''His school was very good and helped him develop in his own way. If
he had been forced to conform it could have destroyed him. As it is he
has developed as his own person and is at peace with himself and very
skilled and determined. His father and I are happy that he is content
with his life.''

THE Scottish National Party will today outline the agenda for next
month's national conference which it hopes will prepare the party for
the challenge of the next General Election.
The policy vice-convener, Mr Alex Neil, said the debates would firm up
policies on the SNP's distinctive economic and social aims, adding that
he was confident the challenge to his own post by Perth and Kinross MP
Roseanna Cunningham would not cloud the issues.
''We plan to give the lie to the Unionist argument that Scotland isn't
paying its way, to show how our industrial policy will bring new jobs,
and to outline how our dynamic budget and repatriation of oil revenues
will reduce unemployement,'' he said.
Among the ideas outlined in the agenda motions will be a plan to make
Scotland the ''Science and Innovation Capital of Europe'', and a paper
written by Mr Neil and MEP Winnie Ewing on a strategic vision for the
future of Europe and Scotland's place in it.
''We aim to prove that the kailyard Scots are in the Unionist parties
now,'' he said. ''We are the internationalists now.''
The party is going through a stiffening of central control and
narrowing of its agenda in readiness for the detail being scrutinised
during election hustings, as it was at the by-election.
This may sound rather like an outbreak of Blair-type moderation in the
party, but as one source put it: ''If we come across as crass, or
nonsensical, or threatening, we can't capitalise on the by-election
success.''

Voluntary community service encourages young people's independence,
helps others, and can boost career prospects, reports Sue Tranter.
YOUNG people who want to live away from home for a while, but need
some financial backing, can help the community, themselves, and their
careers by becoming part of a volunteer scheme.
Community Service Volunteers has been running for 30 years and has 60
offices across Britain, six of them in Scotland. On average, around 300
young Scots take advantage of the service annually, taking part for a
minimum of four months in projects dealing with the disadvantaged,
either in a group situation or on a one-to-one basis.
Volunteers are all given projects in another part of the country, free
accommodation, and a small living allowance which helps finance their
immediate needs.
With three students chasing every two university places, it's more
likely than ever that an increasing number will choose to take a year
out from their studies while they have a break, or decide on which
course they wish to commit.
Some will take fill-in jobs or even go abroad. But a spell as a
Community Service Volunteer is particularly attractive to those with a
career in education or some kind of social work in mind.
Helen McLachlan recently returned from a six-month stay in a small
English village near Basingstoke where she lived with a housebound
victim of multiple sclerosis.
''It was a lovely place surrounded by countryside and obviously
somewhere I would never have visited without CVS.'' she says.
Helen, from Dumbarton, finished her sixth year at Our Lady and St
Patrick's last year and chose to take a year off before going to
university.
''I found out about it at a careers fair and went along to the Glasgow
office. At first I wanted to work with special needs children, but I
wasn't particularly bothered when it was suggested I would be better at
working with someone one-to-one.''
''The lady I helped couldn't manage to get out on her own, and before
I got there the only assistance she had was someone who came in first
thing and in the evening. If she wanted to go anywhere she had to be put
in her car at 7am.''
Volunteers like Helen get an allowance of #50 a week for food and
spending money as well as free accommodation. No qualifications are
needed to join. According to Anne MacEwan, external relations officer
for Scotland, ''Whether it is a desire to work with the homeless, with
children who have learning difficulties, to help people with
disabilities to live independently or just to move away from home with
some financial security, CSV provides more opportunities for more
gap-year students than any other organisation.''
''We have between 8000 to 9000 projects needing helpers,'' she adds.
''Our doors are always open and we can always find work for more.
Placement depends on the person's skills, ambitions and abilities.
Students who have already done a degree also find CVS valuable as a way
to get experience, while others find it gives them the experience they
need to get onto a social work course.''
Despite the perception that volunteers are more likely to be female,
Anne adds that this is not the case, and the spread between boys and
girls is much more even.
There is an age cut-off at 35 while the maximum term for a volunteer
is 12 months. However, the first month is considered a trial period when
it is possible for a change of mind, and if a job came up demanding
immediate acceptance then obviously that would be accommodated.
While leaving Scotland might be an attraction to some volunteers, Anne
is quick to reassure others that they won't feel isolated.
''Local get-togethers are organised for volunteers and they meet one
another during their work,'' she says.
Vivienne Saber is 17 and currently working at a disability resource
centre in Paisley. She came to Scotland from her home in Westminster,
London, five months ago and will be spending another month here before
going to college in York.
''I decided to become a volunteer because I thought it would be an
ideal way to leave home and get more independence without being totally
on my own,'' she says. ''I also thought it would be a way to meet people
and give myself more confidence.'' Fortunately her expectations seem to
have been fulfilled, and she has enjoyed her time here.
''I had never been to Glasgow before and though I was offered a
specific placing in London if I had wanted it, I decided it was better
to go for something quickly so I said I really didn't mind where I was
sent.''
Clearly a flexible attitude and an enthusiasm to try out something new
rather then kicking your heels for a few months make the ideal attitude
for any volunteer.

Bruce McKain, Law Correspondent, examines the case for reforming
Scotland's antiquated system of civil justice
AT long last the system of civil justice in Scotland, so long
overshadowed by crime, is getting the attention it deserves.
For understandable reasons, crime has hogged the headlines and grabbed
the imagination of the public and politicians. That is no doubt why we
have had more than a dozen pieces of legislation affecting criminal
justice in Scotland since the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, in
itself a major reform.
Civil justice -- dealing with divorce, road accidents, medical
negligence, and challenging the decisions of central and local
government -- has far more direct effect than crime on most of our
lives. While it has not exactly been ignored, it has been the poor
relation, with patchwork reforms dictated by recurring crises.
Contrast the situation in England, where the Lord Chancellor's review
body on civil justice reported in 1988 and Lord Woolf has recommended a
major overhaul of the system to tackle the problems of cost and delay.
The two-day conference currently being held in Aberdeen by Citizen's
Advice Scotland is the latest welcome sign that the attention gap
between civil and criminal law is now being addressed.
While the views of bodies such as CAB and the Scottish Consumer
Council are welcome, and indeed crucial to the debate, perhaps the most
encouraging sign is the clarion cry for change emanating from within the
top ranks of the legal profession itself.
The consensus seems to be that the current system is too slow, too
expensive, and too mystifying to the public who use it.
It is certainly possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit in
on a Court of Session hearing for a considerable amount of time with
only a glimmering of comprehension.
Frequently, delay is not the fault of those who administer the system
but rather of lawyers whose clients' interests are not necessarily
served by a speedy resolution of the dispute.
In November last year the late Lord Morton of Shuna issued a blast in
a speech in the House of Lords: ''I am proud to have been appointed a
Senator of the College of Justice, but I regret that the court's
procedures have become wholly out of date. It is no pleasure to me to
have to suggest that on this issue England and Wales are so far ahead of
Scotland.''
He conceded that there had been radical reform of sheriff court
procedures to enable sheriffs to have much more control over cases and
the speed at which they proceeded through the court.
Lord Morton called for the same hands-on approach by Judges in the
Court of Session, our supreme civil court which sets out to be the jewel
in the crown of the system.
In his view the public quite rightly saw as a complete nonsense a
system where no matter how ineptly, slowly, and expensively a case was
being conducted, a judge remained a passive prisoner of the procedure,
there only as a referee to see that the fight was conducted cleanly
according to the rules.
He also demanded a ''cards-on-the table'' approach to get rid of what
he called justice by ambush by ensuring the fullest possible disclosure
of evidence by both sides at the earliest possible stage.
A few months later the cudgels were taken up by Lord Gill, at that
time the newest judge on the Scottish Bench. He condemned the
complacency which had allowed the basic structure of civil litigation in
Scotland to remain the same since 1825, faithfully applying the
tradition of nearly 200 years.
Lord Gill conceded that the Scottish system of complicated written
pleadings, taking many months to draft, might be intellectually
satisfying, but it was also time-consuming, expensive, and long past its
sell-by date.
He contrasted proceedings at the Copyright Tribunal, where it is
apparently normal to proceed straight to a hearing on cases involving
millions of pounds without complex procedural rigmarole.
Then, in May this year, Lord Hope, the Lord President, set up the
Cullen Committee to conduct a review to see how procedure in the Court
of Session could be speeded up and simplified and a greater degree of
Lord Morton-style judicial control exercised over cases.
The points raised by Lords Morton and Gill will be addressed by the
Cullen Committee, but according to research conducted for The Herald's
law page by Scottish lawyer Mike Dailly, the solutions are by no means
straightforward.
Following up Lord Morton's suggestion of the superiority of the
English system, Dailly discovered that in England it took 176 weeks
between issuing a writ and commencing or disposal of a case in the
Queen's Bench Division.
In other words, someone suing in a civil action must wait, on average,
three years for justice. This compared with a nine-month period in the
Court of Session for a case to go to proof.
In England in a personal injuries action in the High Court or County
Court, the two sides must exchange witness statements within 10 weeks of
pleadings being finalised -- in other words a cards-on-the-table
approach.
But when Mike Dailly asked the Law Society in England what effect this
had on the speed and cost of justice, the reply was that there was no
evidence it resulted in cases being settled earlier.
Concern was also expressed that it added to the costs of a case at the
early stage since that was when all the statements had to be prepared.
This detracted from the savings that could be made later from a case
being settled out of court.
So, while no-one denies the imperfections of the Scottish system, or
the attractions of the Morton/Gill ideas for reform, it is obvious that
there is no quick fix if we are to have a system of civil justice fit
for the next century.
The report of the Cullen Committee will help, but the case for a
complete civil justice review seems overwhelming, particularly if there
is to be a radical departure from our present adversarial system.
As Lord Gill put it: ''My retirement date will be 2017. If I am still
around by then I will be greatly disappointed if the system of civil
justice remotely resembles the present model.''

WILLIAM is a sturdy name. According to one keen derivation, it means a
helmet of resolution. Stout stuff is William. In print it looks shapely.
But like some other monikers, it is often not allowed to say what it
wants to say. As Mark Twain pointed out, names are not always what they
seem.'' For an example, he added: ''The common Welsh name Bzjxxllwcp is
pronounced Jackson.''
The trouble with William is worse. Seldom is it allowed to be a name
at all. Diminutive versions are preferred. One way or another about
seven changes can be rung. William is not so much a handle to a jug as
an adjustable spanner. Also, it gets slanged. And some people use it to
talk dirty. Sometimes it is just a joke.
Yet rhymers have been moved to poesy by the word's poetic qualities.
Even its bitty variety has prompted their muse:
Father calls me William,
Sister calls me Will,
Mother calls me Willie,
But the fellers call me Bill.
Less lightsome treatment has fallen upon the name. The chairman, name
of Wakeham, of the Press Complaints Commission wants to keep it out of
the newspapers. Without asking the other Wm's in the world, this Wakeham
recommends a decent obscurity for the name when it comes attached to a
princeling of the royal household.
He quoth: ''Prince William is not an institution, nor a soap star, nor
a football hero.''
Right enough, a schoolboy who is not every night on television and
doesn't kick a ball has not much obvious news value in him, especially
as a seven-letter name is a brute to fit into a headline.
To be fair (not easy), royals of assorted flavours have done much to
make William sweet. They have made a rich assortment. Kingly Williams
have been variously the Bastard, the Red, the Wise, the Silent, and the
Lion, not to forget battling Billy.
Emperor among these crowned ones was William IX, of Aquitaine, who put
the name to his output of filthy songs.
Dirtying the word has been a part of the abuse it has taken. Willy
began as a piece of schoolboy slang -- probably including Eton where
prince what'shisname is going -- but has since declined to a code work
guaranteed to put any grown-up audience in kinks.
Into knots it has sent even the most scholarly dictionaries as they
seek to illustrate the usage. For a context one tome quotes: ''The
gallant soldier boys are afflicted with syph, darling (their willies rot
away).''
Genteel willies mean a fit of nerves, while william-nilliam has been
used humorously (it says in this book) as a ponderous form of
willy-nilly. American slang employed william to describe a dollar bill.
Slang in English has taken weird forms of which the weirdest was
Willie, Willie -- wicked, wicked. At the start of this century it seems
to have been a street shout to jeer at a middle-aged woman talking to a
young man or toy boy. Somehow the voice of Alma Cogan seems to drift
over that quaint outburst.
Despite Oor Wullie and Wee Willie who ran about in his nichtgown,
William got made heavy with years. It became an old man's name. The
poets did that. Robert Southey, a rhymer of the royal court, heaped age
on the name and Lewis Carroll topped it off:
''You are old, Father William,'' the young man said.
''And your hair has become very white;
''And yet you incessantly stand on your head --
''Do you think at your age, it is right?''
''In my youth,'' Father William replied to his son,
''I feared it might injure the brain,
''But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
''Why, I do it again and again.''
Weary Williamness, however, springs mainly from the creation of an
unwashed, untidy, unbiddable magazine character called William Brown.
''I just don't WANT to behave like a civilised yuman bein'. I'd rather
be a savage any day,'' he was wont to utter.
This William preferred worms to girls whom he believed were the
scrubbed guardian angels of boring adult civilisation. ''They're soppy
an' batty and stuck-up an' stupid,'' he said. Even what passed for his
jokes were anti-social. Here's one.
''Which of our grand national buildings have you seen?'' said Mr
Cranthorpe-Cranborough.
''I've never been to the races,'' said William sadly. If he had a
redeeming weakness it was liking cowboy pictures.
But it wasn't William Brown's fault that he became enduringly
destructive. At first he was known only to readers of a weekly paper
called (yes!) Happy Mag. His invention was at the hands of a
schoolteacher named Richmal Crompton who hoped to make money from him so
she could concentrate on writing serious novels.
When the magazine's proprietors made a book of her first William Brown
stories, they called the collection Just William. That was in l922. It
was the first of hundreds of books about him; well, nearly 40 of them.
They were enough to see off William as a serious name. It has been just
so-so ever since.
This Wakeham chap may be right after all. The princeling at school
needs all the protection he can get from the papers. Enough for him to
take is what he's called. The parents are to blame, of course.

TOP cartoonists paid tribute yesterday to Carl Giles, the creator of
some of the most celebrated cartoons of the century, who has died at his
home in Suffolk.
The brolly-wielding grandmother and the cadaverous teacher Chalky
became nationwide favourites.
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were fans and often requested
originals of his cartoons.
Giles worked for the Daily and Sunday Express. He began drawing for
Lord Beaverbrook's papers in 1943 and provided a look at life in Britain
for 50 years.
Stanley McMurtry, Mac of the Daily Mail, said: ''Giles was a great
influence on me although the humour is different now, more political.
''What Giles showed was gentle warmth and tremendous detail in his
drawings. I rang him up a few weeks ago to get him to come to the pub
but he wouldn't. He said he would make a comeback but I think it was
wishful thinking. He was a great character.''
Matt of the Daily Telegraph admired Giles's eye for background with
great technique.
He said: ''He was up there with the giants. In politics you have Bell,
Garland, and Vicky, and for large, humourous cartoons he and Jak of the
Standard and Mac of the Mail are the best.
''I'm a lot younger but as a kid I was given Giles annuals and they
were marvellous.''
Sir Nicholas Lloyd, editor of the Daily Express, said: ''Giles was
unique. The draughtsmanship of his cartoons and his wonderful sense of
fun were legendary.
''He was a cartoonist of the people and much loved by everyone, not
only Express readers.''
The wheelchair-bound artist, whose humorous portrayals of the Second
World War in the Daily Express made him into a national institution,
died on Sunday after several months of ill health.
He had never fully recovered from the death of his wife, Joan, last
Christmas.

I COULDN'T agree more with Jack McLean (for once) with his mention of
hodden grey suits and old schoolwear.
I'll never forget when my mother took me to the Social Security.
My father died of pneumonia due to the muddy water in the trenches in
the First World War. She was given a coarse, hodden-grey worsted dress
big enough to fit a 14-year-old (I was only five) and big boots.
When I wore them to the primary school, the children laughed at me and
I came home crying.
Today's children are richly dressed.

Eric Kennedy meets a microbiologist and put his career under the
microscope
BLOOD donors, it turns out, are not the only people who help humanity:
for there are laboratories up and down the country which constantly use
blood and serum in the cultivation of micro-organisms for diagnostic
purposes.
The blood, says Dr John Cameron of E &amp; O Laboratories Ltd, comes from
horses and sheep and goes to diagnostic microbiology labs throughout
Britain and Europe.
Before you ask, the horses and sheep don't get a cup of tea and a
biscuit but they are allowed a little extra grass and hay.
John Cameron, himself a microbiologist, feels the job is worthwhile.
''Cultivation and identification of harmful micro-organisms is often
the first stage in treatment of infectious diseases,'' he says. ''Our
laboratories provide blood, media and sera which are essential in this
process. It's a job whose benefits can clearly be seen.''
Being particularly interested in science, he entered Glasgow
University Faculty of Science in 1986, having left the city's Holyrood
Secondary with passes in Higher Chemistry, Biology, Physics and English,
and a Sixth Year Studies Certificate in Biology.
He became extremely interested, however, in microbiology and
concentrated on topics such as genetic approaches to bacterial
virulence, virology, medical microbiology, and vaccine development. None
of these presented him with any particular academic problems: perhaps
because by this time he was caught up in his studies.
He also spent a summer vacation working in the Central Veterinary
Laboratory, run by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, in
Weybridge, Surrey.
That sort of activity does one's CV no harm.
He graduated B.Sc. (Hons) in microbiology in 1990, then went to
Edinburgh University to do a Ph.D. He graduated in July this year,
having spent a year and a half working as a molecular biologist while
writing his thesis.
He immediately started work with E and O in Bonnybridge, which, due to
company expansion, was offering its first full-time research and
development post. He also takes care of technical services, dealing with
inquiries from labs when, for example, they are having trouble growing
certain organisms, or have problems working with serum.
Is it an enjoyable job? ''Yes,'' he says firmly, ''There is always
something different to be done and we are kept very busy.
''And while we deal with a lot of telephone inquiries every day, I
also attend conferences and exhibitions at which I get across to people
what the company does.
''As I have said, it is a worthwhile job due to its involvement in
public health, and I feel I have chosen a particularly rewarding
career.''

WE write with great concern regarding Dr Elizabeth Scott's article
(August 24) and her comments on sulphasalazine.
First, the headline with reference to the subsequent article is
incorrect since sulphasalazine is not a ''cure'' for rheumatoid
arthritis.
Secondly, rheumatoid arthritis cannot be dismisse as ''a bit of
pain''. It is a major disease causing severe joint pain, stiffness, and
swelling and an inability to carry out normal activities of daily living
such as writing, dressing, feeding, walking, toileting, and bathing.
Untreated rheumatoid arthritis causes irreversible joint destruction.
Thirdly, while sulphasalazine may cause a fall in the white cell count
this is rare and reversible. Changes in the blood count can be detected
by monitoring. This is always explained to the patient and to the
general practitioner prior to starting therapy.
The only point with which we are in agreement with Dr Scott is that
ultimately it is the informed patient who makes the decision to take the
treatment. It is undoubtedly the duty of the prescribing doctor to
explain the risks and benefits of treatment but also to recognise the
disability associated with untreated progress of the disease. We would
all like to have entirely risk-free treatments but these are not yet
available.
We would wish patients to understand that stopping treatment with
drugs such as sulphasalazine in controlled rheumatoid arthritis will
result in a deterioration in their disease over a period of weeks to
months.
We suggest that an alternative explanation for the fact that patients
chose to take drugs such as sulphasalazine is that they have weighed up
the risks, benefits, and the impact of the disease after receiving
adequate explanation on all three counts from informed practitioners.
It is unfortunate that Dr Scott appears to have focused on only one
part of the risk/benefit equation.

HUNDREDS of bargain-hunters are expected to take part this week in
Scotland's first timeshare holiday auction.
Interest in the sale has been so intense that the catalogue has been
reprinted twice and a second auction is to be held early next year.
About 200 weeks at 13 of the 17 Scottish timeshare resorts will come
under the hammer at the Royal Scot Hotel in Edinburgh on Thursday.
Although most of the catalogue requests have come from Scots, many of
those interested are English and some inquiries have come from the
Continent.
Skiing weeks at Aviemore, Open Golf dates at Kilconquhar, close to St
Andrews, and Christmas weeks at several centres are among the lots on
sale. Most of the deals entitle people to stays at timeshare resorts
abroad.
A school holiday fortnight at Kenmore, Perthshire, where the
attractions include salmon fishing, golf, sailing, and water sports, is
expected to raise more than #20,000. However, the list also includes
attractive weeks which could be available for around #2000, and there
are 35 with either no lowest price set or reserves of less than #1000.
Mr Alasdair Seale, managing director of Trinity Factors, Edinburgh,
the auction's organisers, said yesterday: ''We were getting dozens of
calls a day with catalogue requests and we ended up having 800 copies
done. There is certainly potential for some bargains.''
He added: ''We already have registrations for our next timeshare
auction, next March.''

IT was the briefest of resignation notes. Just two paragraphs
signalling the end of James Molyneaux's 16-year leadership of the Ulster
Unionist Party.
Suddenly, as Northern Ireland recalls the first anniversary of the IRA
ceasefire, his departure places a new uncertainty over the province's
political future.
The resignation of Molyneaux, who was 75 on Sunday, has been the
subject of intense speculation since the British and Irish Governments
published their agreed proposals for the future of Ulster last spring.
Many Unionists were angry that the trust placed by Molyneaux in his
personal friendship with John Major was not reflected, as they saw it,
in the Government's ''joint framework documents'' with Dublin.
These proposals promised a political settlement which would give the
Irish Government a greater input into Northern Ireland's future than
that agreed in 1985 by Margaret Thatcher. In that year Molyneaux had
come under attack for pinning too much faith in Thatcher. Assurances he
had given to Unionists appeared to backfire when she agreed to give
Dublin a strong consultative say in Ulster.
His resignation took Belfast by surprise, especially since he had
conveyed the impression recently that he would continue until next year.
Instead he chose to step down on his birthday, confiding in only a
handful of his closest party colleagues and issuing a terse statement
saying he had taken his decision to enable a successor to be chosen in
time to prepare for the next General Election, which ''could come
earlier than would have appeared six months ago''.
He added: ''Might I make it absolutely clear that I have no intention
of making any further comment on my decision.'' The succinctness was
typical of a man of few words and the lowest of political profiles.
Unlike other leaders in the cauldron of Irish politics, he was a master
of understatement, preferring to avoid the television studios and to
shun the headlines.
''Where Northern Ireland is concerned, I do not believe in high-wire
politics,'' he once said, and that was his guiding principle in recent
years even though Unionist supporters sometimes despaired at his
unwillingness to play a more prominent role, in contrast to the loud and
verbose tactics of the rival Democratic Unionist Party leader, Ian
Paisley.
Molyneaux believed in working behind the scenes at Westminster,
quietly trying to persuade successive governments to maintain Northern
Ireland's constitutional position within the UK and to reject the
advances of the Irish Government and Ulster nationalists. In the end,
even his closest party colleagues lost faith in his strategy. As they
sought a more strident approach to defending the Union, so their message
to Molyneaux was that it was time for him to go.
Throughout his career as leader, Molyneaux was constantly looking over
his shoulder at Paisley. Somehow, until recently, he had managed to
subdue the thunder of the Free Presbyterian leader who had emerged in
the early 1970s with his new Democratic Unionist Party. One by one,
Ulster Unionist leaders had fallen in the face of Paisley's fiery
Protestant rhetoric, each of them condemned for allegedly selling-out
the Unionist cause.
Molyneaux, with his impeccable Orange Order connections, built a trust
among grassroots Protestants that even Paisley could not dent. When
asked privately how he had managed to keep the right-wing politics of
Paisley in check, he replied wryly: ''Simple, I out-right him.'' By that
he meant that he could appear just as fundamentally Protestant as
Paisley, by marching proudly at the head of Protestant parades,
unveiling Orange banners, and generally conveying a conservative
Unionist message to the faithful.
In the end that was not enough as Paisley raged last year that he was
a ''Judas Iscariot'', a reference to his apparent closeness to John
Major, and the Unionist party grew weary and wary of his assurances
about the Government's intentions towards Ulster.
Molyneaux's resignation adds confusion to the quest for a lasting
political settlement. Friday marks the first anniversary of the IRA
ceasefire but there remains no sign of inter-party talks involving Sinn
Fein. Neither of the two main Unionist parties is prepared to
countenance such dialogue, although Molyneaux's party might if the IRA
were to agree to decommission its terrorist arsenal.
Molyneaux's departure puts Unionist strategy in limbo for a few more
weeks at least. A new leader is expected to be chosen by mid-September
but who that will be and what if any new approach he may propose is
unclear. Despite a year of peace, Unionists are in no mood for the kind
of political settlement involving Dublin which their nationalist
opponents have in mind. This summer brought bitter street clashes over
the re-routing of Protestant marches away from Catholic areas and
grassroots Unionist opinion is deeply suspicious of what it sees as
unwarranted concessions to Sinn Fein over the peace process and the rise
in political confidence of the Irish nationalists.
Four of Molyneaux's colleagues at Westminster have emerged as
front-runners for the leadership. They are the party's high-profile
security spokesman, Ken Maginnis, 57, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone;
the Chief Whip, William Ross, 59, East Londonderry MP; Orange Order
leader, the Rev Martin Smyth, 64, who is MP for South Belfast; and John
Taylor, 57, MP for Strangford.
A weekend opinion poll conducted by an Irish Sunday newspaper put
Maginnis as the most popular and Ross as a virtual also-ran even before
the race begins. Significantly, the second most popular Unionist figure
was David Trimble, the sternly articulate MP for Armagh, who says he is
not a candidate for the leadership. Trimble, a university law lecturer,
has gained support for his forthright defence of Unionist principles in
television debates and for his tough stand this summer in support of
Protestant parades.
Taylor, a former minister in the old Stormont government, and
Maginnis, are particularly disliked by hardline Paisleyites. Both men
have accused Paisley of damaging Unionist interests with his firebrand
international image. Ross and Smyth have followed a more conventional
political road, rarely, if ever, making statements that might disturb
the party faithful.
But now the battle for the future of Ulster Unionism is joined, all
the contenders know their best chance is not to rock the party boat. An
uncompromising message in defence of the Union and a determination to
withstand the mounting pressures of Irish nationalism -- when the Ulster
Unionist Party's 900 delegates meet to select the new leader next month,
that is what they will want to hear, no matter how strongly London or
Dublin, John Hume or Gerry Adams may wish it to be otherwise.

As the mortar shells land once more in Sarajevo, ripping the city and
its people apart, Tom Gallagher relates how one Croatian city is trying
to patch up the scars of war
A SENSE of euphoria still hangs over the coast city of Zadar, capital
of Old Dalmatia, almost a month after the Croatian army managed to
retake high ground to the east as it occupied the Krajina region.
On the evening I arrived in town, cars with the Croatian flag
extending from rear windows were a common sight as they rattled across
town. Soldiers in fatigues were being feted in cafes. But at least no
guns were being fired in the air: that would only have been to emphasise
similarities with the despised Serbian foe.
However, in 1990 militants from Franjo Tudjman's party had smashed up
Serb businesses in the town in response to the sabre-rattling of Krajina
Serbs intent on pulling out of Croatia. Unlike the other towns on the
Dalmatian coast, Zadar warmed to Tudjman's brand of intransigent
nationalism and voted solidly for his HDZ party in 1990 and thereafter.
Memories still festered of occupation by Italy between the two wars
which culminated in savage Allied bombing raids in 1942-43.
In 1991 Zadar was bombed from the sea and land and sporadically
shelled. Ana, a student at the local university, recalled days on end
without water or electricity in which many of the 130,000 population
crammed into underground cellars. She was still bitter that Serb gunners
had aimed their most withering fire at the city's churches, the oldest
one, St Donat's, being associated with the Irish saint who had
re-implanted Christianity along this stretch of the eastern Adriatic.
Zadar connects north Dalmatia and Zagreb, the Croatian capital, with
the rest of the Croatian coast as far south as Dubrovnik. If Croatia is
seen as two sides of a triangle, reaching eastwards into central Europe
and southwards down the Adriatic coast, the town is placed at a most
vulnerable point. If it had fallen to Serb forces, Croatia would have
been effectively partitioned and Belgrade would have achieved the
coveted access to the sea which land-locked Serbia lacks.
Croatia's difficult geography almost meant that its rebirth as a state
was stillborn. But the local defenders of Zadar held their ground and
showed that the Yugoslav army and Serb militia were not as mighty as
London, Paris, and Washington have always assumed.
Sand-bagged churches and public buildings still bear the scars of war
but inland the devastation is far more systematic. For almost 15 miles
up to the destroyed Maslenica bridge few houses have escaped shell
damage and hundreds have been pounded to rubble. Those that have been
dynamited from within are likely to have belonged to Serbs, the subject
of revenge attacks by embittered Croats.
Cars and lorries crawl across the 825ft pontoon bridge erected in
July, 1993, after Croatia had retaken the hinterland behind Zadar. Many
had predicted that the fragile ceasefire which had come into being in
1992 would collapse as a result of Croat efforts to restore what is
still the only road link between south and north Croatia. However, a few
days later the Croat President met with Serbia's President Milosevic
which rekindled rumours that both might do a deal by partitioning Bosnia
between them.
Today these rumours are once again on many lips.
Whatever the endgame for Bosnia proves to be, plans are already afoot
to blast a motorway through the mountains above Zadar to halve the
journey time from Zagreb to the Croatian coast, thereby reviving the
touristic fortunes of the area. Already there is a glimmer of hope: on
the offshore islands of Pasman and Ugjian the foreign yachting
fraternity have started to return. These islands are only a short ferry
trip from Zadar but they might be another world away, the war having
failed to shatter their calm.
Zadar's inhabitants are patching up their historic quarter in the hope
that the Corinthian columns and Romanesque churches visible from the
islands will tempt visitors across. Today the only big-spending
foreigners belong to the UN protection force.

Stewart Lamont believes 'clergy codes' could be the first step by
churches to fend off compensation claims from those abused by errant
ministers.
THERE I was drinking tea, sitting next to an attractive young divorcee
on her white leather couch . . . a couple of days later, on Sunday, I
was standing in a local pub in my dog collar less than an hour after
stepping out of the pulpit. All this in the same week as I returned
after 11pm from visiting a member of my flock.
Is this the confession you have all been waiting for? Will the
Presbytery of Glasgow soon be defrocking the errant minister of Kinning
Park? The charge: breaking three of the ''commandments'' which were
issued by the Bishop of Oxford's working party to keep Anglican clergy
on the straight and narrow.
Well, not quite. I have a defence, Moderator. On the first occasion
there was no other seat in the living room, apart from the one occupied
by another lady who is going to be matron of honour at the forthcoming
wedding. So by having a chaperone present, I hopefully escape censure.
The second occasion was a family baptism in which the godmother (and
aunt of the baby) was using the pub of which she is manager for a
private christening party and many of those present were, like her,
members of my congregation. OK, Moderator?
Oh, and the third occasion I had arranged to visit this family after
an evening meeting and it went on rather long. Is that me off the hook?
The reason I have cited these three examples is that it is all too
easy to see how doing a normal week's work as a clergyman can create
situations in which the ''clergy code'' is breached. All three examples
mentioned are true and they all occurred as recently as last week. All
three situations are specific instances to which the Oxford group allude
in its clergy code.
Sitting on settees with single ladies is out. Visiting same after 9pm
or being seen taking alcoholic drink while on duty are all warned
against. Rightly so. But whether the guidelines -- and that is all they
are -- are necessary will surely be questioned.
Most clergymen would be expected to use common sense in doing their
duty. In today's world, with stories of sex abuse and harassment
abounding, it is surely doubly necessary to be as innocent as doves and
as wise as serpents. The latter bit consists of not just being innocent
but being seen to be innocent (or rather not giving anyone the
opportunity to imagine you are guilty).
It is all too obvious that the situations in which impropriety arises,
or is alleged to have occurred, are no longer as rare as they once were.
The recent and much-publicised case of the Dean of Lincoln (cleared of
wrongdoing after a late-evening visit to a lady verger became a cause of
scandalous accusations) was swiftly followed by the can of serpents
opened when the ''rave'' vicar in Sheffield, the Rev Chris Brain, was
exposed as a sexual abuser and suspended.
There have been a number of stories in the past year linking Roman
Catholic priests with sexual abuse, and a Kirk minister is currently
serving a prison sentence for the same crime.
In one sense they are part of a wider picture in which moral weakness
seems more common in society and in the professions than it once was.
The professional bodies are, therefore, being forced to spell out
professional standards which were once taken for granted.
The Kirk's Board of Ministry presented a code of professional conduct
to the last General Assembly within its report. Less specific than the
Oxford group's guidelines, it dealt, among other things, with the need
to observe confidentiality and sexual propriety in pastoral
relationships; being circumspect in handling money; and not making false
claims to qualifications.
Rather neatly, it fell into 10 sections -- allowing it to be described
as ''commandments'', but it has yet to have the force of law in the
Kirk.
It is in the same position as the Bishop of Oxford's report -- it is a
guide. Churches like the Roman Catholic church have a much more specific
system of moral code for clergy in canon law which covers matters such
as whether a priest may sport a moustache. But when it comes to the kind
of thing which got the Dean of Lincoln into trouble it relies on common
sense.
Father Tom Connelly, the media spokesman for the Roman Catholic church
in Scotland, sums up the advice given to trainee priests as being ''use
caution, common sense, and discretion. That covers things like calling
at houses in the late evening or visiting one house rather too often.''
He applies the same advice to the more open form of face-to-face
confession which is available in some Catholic churches but which does
not seem to have caught on in Scotland.
However, no matter how commonsensical the guidelines of Anglican,
Catholic, and Presbyterian churches may be, the signs are that these
churches will be forced into turning them into commandments and making
them mandatory.
There are two reasons for this. The first reflects modern concern for
''rights'' in the area of employment. This is strengthened on the one
hand by the need to protect against unfair dismissal and on the other to
be able to have legislation by which the bad apple can be plucked from
the barrel.
The second -- and much more significant -- reason was revealed by the
Archdeacon of Sheffield, the Venerable Stephen Lowe, the man who
suspended the rave vicar. The Oxford guidelines were not relevant to the
case of Mr Brain who, the Archdeacon said, would not have acknowledged
that he was misbehaving. However, he added: ''Maybe we need to look at
the idea here a lot more carefully. It's been around in America a lot
longer because they have the risk of being sued.''
The possibility of such lawsuits becoming more commonplace in Britain
is an increasing one. For instance, a woman abused by a clergyman could
sue his employer, his diocese or Presbytery.
That could be a very costly and difficult situation. Dioceses and
presbyteries would need to be insured against such an eventuality.
However, if they could show that they had guidelines which disallowed
certain forms of conduct, when a clergyman breached these he would
become personally liable for his conduct and they would not be held to
be liable as his employer.
In other words, the issuing of guidelines could be the first step for
churches to protect themselves against those who want compensation for
the failure of the churches to protect them from abuse.
It's a crazy situation in which common sense goes out the window while
insurance men and lawyers come in the front door.
Sitting on the white leather couch, will I be insured for damages if I
spill my tea and leave a stain -- or will the stain turn out to be on my
character?

PRELIM examinations for fifth and sixth-year pupils are likely to
disappear under the Government's blueprint for reforming upper secondary
schooling.
Most secondaries currently set prelims in December and January to
check the progress pupils have made before their Higher exams, and to
use as ammunition if a school wishes to appeal on behalf of those who
fail to achieve their expected grades.
But in a consultation document issued yesterday which describes how
subjects are to be organised and assessed under the Higher Still
programme, prelims are described as ''time-consuming''.
Under the reform, courses which will last 160 hours will be externally
assessed by the new qualifications body to be formed by the merger of
the Scottish Examination Board and Scotvec, which is responsible for
vocational education.
Courses will be divided into units, normally of 40 hours' duration,
which will be internally assessed by teachers in school.
Chief inspector of schools Mr Ron Tuck, a leading light in the Higher
Still development, said yesterday there were many benefits in internal
assessment.
In an effort to placate teachers who are expressing concern about the
amount of assessment in the five-14 programme and in Standard Grade, he
said: ''It will not dominate the lives of students, or dominate
teaching.''
Both he and the senior chief inspector of schools, Mr Nisbet
Gallacher, hoped the assessment of units could be simplified when
teachers were gauging whether pupils had met the targets they were set.
They hoped the teacher assessments thoughout courses would ''reduce or
eliminate'' the need for prelim exams.
The disappearance of prelims would also free more time for teaching,
particularly in the fifth year where the present Higher has come under
attack as a ''two-term dash'' to the exam period.
Yesterday's document makes it clear that external exams could be
shortened because of the enhanced role of internal assessment. The SEB
has already proposed shortening the exam diet to allow more time for the
longer Higher Still courses.
The key part of the document says good performance throughout a
course, verified by unit assessments, may overturn a poor performance in
the externally-assessed final exam.
This will happen if a school's overall estimates for the pupils
presented are generally consistent with actual results. The level of
award given to a pupil who has done less well than expected in the final
exam ''will be automatically improved, prior to the issue of results''.
In a further acknowledgement of the need to safeguard the best
interests of pupils, a ''safety net'' is to be provided for the new
Advanced Higher, which will replace the Certificate of Sixth-Year
Studies. The Advanced Higher will be a two-year course lasting 320 hours
in each subject intended to prepare pupils for higher education.
However, there had been criticism of the proposals because they
encouraged able pupils to by-pass the Higher exam at the end of fifth
year in the expectation that they would pass the final exam after the
two-year programme.
Now pupils who fail the Advanced Higher may be awarded a compensatory
Higher on appeal if they have passed the assessment of the fifth-year
units at Higher level.
The Advanced Higher will be introduced in 1999, one year after the
implementation of Higher Still.
The reform is being introduced because the present system of Highers
is beyond the reach of a large percentage of the growing number of young
people staying on after 16.
Higher Still aims to put vocational education on an equal footing with
academic subjects and, with that in mind, Scotvec's National
Certificates, which build up to group awards, are being given a central
place in the framework.

MANAGEMENT at the National Blood Authority, recently affected by a
scandal over leaking blood bags, were accused yesterday of trying to gag
their staff over serious safety concerns.
Draft guidelines obtained by the Labour Party say staff who want to
raise cases of exceptional concern must exhaust all internal procedures
before contacting their MP or the media.
The guidelines, drawn up by the authority which is responsible for
managing the blood tranfusion service in England and Wales, warn that
failure to comply with instructions could result in disciplinary action.
The guidelines do not apply to the Scottish National Blood Transfusion
Service, which requires only that staff make clear they are speaking on
their own behalf rather than for the service.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish service said: ''We believe in openness,
subject to the normal constraints of patient or donor confidentiality
which apply throughout the health service. We have many staff,
particularly doctors, who have to speak publicly on professional
matters.''
Labour health spokeswoman Ms Tessa Jowell said it was ''outrageous''
for the NBA to try to prevent staff from raising matters of concern with
their elected representatives.
''The audacity of the NBA beggars belief. People have a basic right to
approach their MP with any concern at any time. It is not for the NBA to
decide when they can or can't do this,'' she said.
She said the NBA's stance was a matter of particular concern following
the incident earlier this year when Australian-made Tuta blood bags had
to be withdrawn after they were found to have faulty seals, exposing
them to the risk of infection.
An NBA spokeswoman said the guidelines were still being discussed with
National Blood Service unions. However, she claimed they were based on
practices and procedures used throughout the National Health Service.

AN Acas course on employers' duties will cost two lawyers #10,956 --
after they unfairly sacked a typist.
An industrial tribunal has labelled the lawyers' actions
''unreasonable, arbitrary, and unilateral''.
Mr Cornelius McAfee and Mr Richard Ackland, who trade as McAfee
Criminal Defence Lawyers, were ordered to pay compensation to Mrs Mary
Mullen, of Braehead Avenue, Kirkshaws, Coatbridge.
Mrs Mullen had been employed by the lawyers at their Coatbridge office
from August 1983 until she was forced to retire, aged 61, in February of
this year.
Problems started for the lawyers after Mr Ackland attended the Acas
course last autumn and discovered that employers should issue statements
of terms and conditions of employment to staff.
After discussions with Mr McAfee, who thought the retirement age for
women was 60, the lawyers inserted 60 in the employment contracts but,
when they learned Mrs Mullen was already that age, the contracts were
altered to 61.
The tribunal noted: ''Everything was fine until Mr Ackland went to the
Acas course. On his return, it was like the blind leading the blind.''
In declaring Mrs Mullen was unfairly dismissed, the tribunal said:
''The respondents unilaterally sought to insert a term into the
applicant's contract of employment that would have required her to
retire within three months of their notification of it.
''They took no proper steps to ascertain that she consented to such a
change. There was no prior consultation.''
The respondents had acted in an unreasonable, arbitrary, and
unilateral manner which fell foul of any standards of fairness towards
an employee.
''The imposition of a retiral age of 61 was not a sufficient reason
for dismissing the applicant.''

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson yesterday called for a full
debate on the sale of the Scotsman newspaper group and its implications
for Scotland.
Departing from a prepared speech to the Scottish Arts Lobby (Salvo) in
Edinburgh, he said: ''I do not believe anybody in Scotland, whether they
are fans or otherwise of the Scotsman, can be anything other than
concerned at the fact that this newspaper group is up for auction in the
marketplace.
''There is a collective responsibility on all of us that it remains
editorially independent and does not become the plaything of a mogul in
the international media field.
''I would also hope that the diversity of the Scottish press which we
have become used to -- and some of us suffer from -- is maintained and
protected.''

NEW roads to relieve congested small towns must wait until core
network improvements are complete, Scottish Transport Minister Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton said yesterday in a move to divert criticism over
by-pass delays.
In a letter to the British Roads Federation, the Minister admitted
that funding was a ''major issue'' behind the postponement of many new
routes. However, he said a recent survey by the pressure group was wrong
to suggest that the concerns of communities over traffic volume had been
disregarded.
BRF reported last week that nearly two thirds of Scotland's by-pass
schemes now are delayed, predicting that at current completion rates, it
will take 35 years to finish the current tranche of new roads.
However, the Minister said: ''Although the financial constraints that
we are under mean that many construction schemes are being deferred,
significant improvements are being made in many other areas.''
These involved Route Action Plans and ''traffic calming'' measures,
which used one-way systems, efficient traffic lighting, and roundabouts
as quicker and cheaper alternatives to by-passes.
He added that his department's priority was ''to concentrate the
majority of funds on the strategic network to ensure a core of
first-class routes for the strategic commercial traffic of vital
importance to the country's economy.''
However, while welcoming the Minister's interest in his group's
report, BRF campaign co-ordinator Andrew Pharaoh said the letter offered
little comfort to areas waiting by-passes.

Suspicions of child sexual abuse can lead to misery and injustice: Dr
Elizabeth Westcott discusses the anguish of a parent unable to prove his
innocence
CHILD sexual abuse is our greatest social taboo. For far too long, our
society has found the practice so deeply repulsive, that we have
unwittingly protected the perpetrators by our inability to acknowledge
and expose what they do.
Now we are developing methods of seeking them out and punishing them,
but progress down this path is proving extremely difficult. Child sexual
abuse cannot be approached objectively. The word ''abuse'' itself is a
moral category.
There is some evidence to suggest that social workers, in the Ayrshire
case and other instances, are struggling with this lack of objectivity.
Their role demands they make moral judgments on the character of
guardians, during the thousands of investigations into family situations
undertaken each year.
The principal officer of childcare at Strathclyde Regional Council,
Greg Gallagher, believes the difficulty lies in the deep layers of
secrecy shrouding the issue, and the fact that child sexual abuse has
only been a recognised category in Scotland since 1989: ''Because it's
such a new area we can't always get it right, but there's a dilemma: we
have adult survivors telling us they tried to speak out and no-one heard
them,'' he says.
According to Sue Amphlett, spokesperson for the support group PAIN
(Parents Against Injustice) families under investigation find the
experience intensely traumatic. Not knowing how the system works, or how
to get access to the relevant information, these families are
disempowered by the bureaucratic machine. Changes must be made, she
says, to recognise and help the victims of what she calls ''system
abuse''.
Dr David Thorpe, author of Evaluating Child Protection goes even
further in his appraisal of the British child protection system. He
believes intervention is currently based on an inadequate subjective
framework and calls for a ''radical reconceptualisation of the
apparatus''.
One victim of ''system abuse'' is Stuart White, who shares a house in
Glasgow with his de facto partner June Kenny, her two children from a
previous marriage and their daughter Laura. Two years ago he was accused
of sexually molesting his daughter, and despite the complete absence of
evidence he remains under investigation. The process, he says, has
destroyed his life.
On one Friday evening in November 1993, June went to collect Laura
from her nursery. To her surprise, she was summoned to the principal's
office where she was confronted by the principal, a social worker and a
policewoman. She was told an allegation of abuse had been made against
Stuart, and that all three children might be removed from her care if
she did not co-operate in accompanying the officer to the police
station. Although the alleged disclosure occurred in the morning and an
interview had taken place, neither parent was informed till almost five
hours later.
June was told by the social worker that a medical examination would
settle the matter, so everyone trooped off to Yorkhill Hospital, where a
doctor took vaginal swabs from Laura. He said there were no signs of
sexual abuse and he wouldn't need to see her again.
Later, June phoned Stuart from her mother's, to let him know what had
happened. The police had visited already, looking for him. The police
told June, in front of her mother: ''We know Mr White did it, because it
happens in the nicest of families.''
Not long after June's phone call, the police arrived on Stuart's
doorstep, wanting to interview him: ''They pushed their way into the
house and told me Laura had made a verbal statement of abuse, but they
wouldn't tell me what. Who do I sue? I asked. They left, saying they
would be seeing me,'' said Stuart.
The medical examination did not settle the matter; in fact it was only
the beginning of a two-year struggle to get information from the
relevant authorities -- including what Laura allegedly said. Unknown to
Stuart and June, the case went to the Children's Reporter, whose
considerable powers include bringing a case to court on the balance of
probability.
It was discussed at three case conferences, only two of which they
were informed about and even then were not permitted to attend, but had
to wait outside (''like naughty children,'' says June). Nor were they
given summaries of the case conferences, which is a legal requirement.
''Social workers would not give me any information whatsoever, not
even guidelines to procedures,'' says Stuart.
''The medical examination would have been the end of the matter if it
had been in their favour; social workers need two pieces of binding
information, the medical and the original allegation, before it can be
taken to court.''
Stuart and June guessed that the recurring inflammation, similar to
nappy rash, which Laura suffered from, probably triggered the original
allegation. They took her to a specialist, who told them it was ''sore
bottom syndrome'' caused by anal bacteria. When Stuart was finally
notified by letter from a social worker as to what words Laura actually
used, this is what the letter said: ''That my bottom is sore, that Daddy
made it sore, made it sore inside too and her daddy kissed it better.''
According to Stuart, at the time the allegation was made Laura could
hardly put together a three-word sentence. This was later verified by a
speech therapist who said that while she could not make a statement as
to how the child spoke a year ago, she found it highly unlikely that a
child with Laura's speech difficulties should have made such a full
disclosure. So what did Laura say? Did she nod in response to suggestive
questioning? Could she have said something easily misinterpreted by an
employee who was eager to read between the lines?
''What upsets me,'' says Stuart, ''is the complete refusal by the
authorities to even consider that the case was possibly unfounded.''
After Stuart and June became aware of the involvement of the
Children's Reporter, they had to wait for four months before being sent
a brief letter stating: ''I have decided to take no futher action.''
Once again, they hoped this would end the investigation.
However, they discovered that the third case conference had placed
Laura on the Child Protection register, which effectively means that if
any harm befalls Laura which can't be accounted for, she may be taken
and placed in care. They were also denied access to the social worker's
file on the case, for which Stuart had applied, because the case remains
under police investigation.
Stuart feels that from the outset the authorities have treated him as
guilty. The fact he has not been proven innocent not only keeps him
awake at night, it drives him to continue writing letters (well over 300
by now) and filing complaints against both social workers and the
police.
''Nothing can be done to get the police to cross-examine the person
who made the allegation. There's no professional body of social workers
to complain to -- they can say what they like,'' says Stuart.
''The police have said that nothing is proved against me and the
Children's Reporter dropped the case -- why? There wasn't even a
hearing. And yet my daughter is on the at-risk register. At every turn
of the key what I had to say has been ignored.''
Spokesperson for PAIN Sue Amphlett says that Stuart's frustration and
anger is typical of what families under investigation have to endure.
''People become physically and mentally ill or suicidal, their lives
are permanently altered by the investigative process without any
recognition of the trauma -- and then the majority of cases are thrown
back into the sea.
''Meanwhile, very well-meaning social workers are forced to live with
the fact that while they are identifying some kids as victims of abuse,
they are inadvertently harming others.''
PAIN's figures show that 80% of families under investigation don't
have access to relevant information. While social workers do not have
too much power, the balance of power is unequal.
''Advocacy needs to be provided for families, either funded by the
Government or local authorities,'' says Amphlett. ''There should be an
independent body for arbitration and complaints, under the auspices of a
family ombudsman.
''Children have rights, but it's dangerous to build up the rights of
the child without building up the rights of the family. We have got
ourselves into an investigative trap.''
Social workers have the unenviable task of wading through this
minefield, often attacked by both sides, in order to fulfil their
child-protection brief. Greg Gallagher says that while it is
understandable that parents feel aggrieved at being the subject of
investigation, there are few instances where social workers are
completely mistaken.
''Children speak obliquely but there's not always nothing going on.
Manipulation is the name of the game in relation to child sexual abuse.
''The evidence coming in from convicted abusers about the manipulation
they used in an effort to keep their crime undetected makes your hair
stand on end and I don't say that lightly,'' he says.
''My own feeling is that social workers try extremely hard not to go
half-baked into an investigation, and current procedures do demand that
we look closely. There's a lot of debate about who should be
investigating, psychiatrists or perhaps a special team, but at the
moment the social workers have the body of knowledge needed. To retrain
a special group would be a backward step.
''We are meant to be guardians of morality but as soon as we begin to
do that, restrictions are placed on us because folk find it
unpalatable.''
Stuart White now believes that because he and June are not married,
and he has maintained a separate address in England, he is being
discriminated against: a suspicion which Dr Thorpe's research into child
protection appears to confirm.
Dr Thorpe's British and Australian case studies demonstrate that
alternative families, with only one parent or a de facto arrangement,
are far more likely to be under investigation by child protection
authorities. The subjective norm of the ideal home and family, fed by
constant images, is deeply ingrained in all of us, social workers
included. When a family situation deviates from the norm, says Dr
Thorpe, it triggers a forensic gaze for evidence of abuse.
''It's impossible to regulate the power of social workers -- it goes
much, much deeper than that,'' he says. ''There needs to be a radical
reconceptualisation of the whole apparatus of intervention. Child
protection ideologies have to be rethought and workers need to be
retrained.''
There are two aspects to Dr Thorpe's review of child protection.
First, the word ''abuse'' must go. Currently it is used to mean
everything from the death of a child through to minor caregiver
shortcomings.
Secondly, there needs to be a specially trained team to deal with the
families where children are being deliberately and identifiably harmed,
as opposed to other kinds of social work which deals with children in
less than ideal conditions.
Lifting the lid on child sexual abuse is like opening Pandora's box:
inside is crammed with the complex, horrifying ghouls of our deepest
social malaise. As Stuart White ironically points out, while vindication
or any sense of proving his own innocence is dwindling into a forlorn
hope, somewhere a child is being sexually abused and nothing is being
done to stop it.

<HEADLINE>Lanark blue cheese sample in the clear, claims owner</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976650466</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PIECE of Lanark blue cheese alleged to contain 5000 times the
permitted level of listeria monocytogenes was clear of the organisms
when re-tested, a court heard yesterday.
Many other allegedly heavily contaminated samples showed either no
sign of the organism or contained low levels which were not dangerous,
cheesemaker Humphrey Errington claimed.
Giving evidence on Day 11 of the case at Lanark Sheriff Court in which
Clydesdale District Council seeks an order to destroy #27,000 of Lanark
blue, Mr Errington produced certificates from three accredited
laboratories showing test results on cheese samples before they were
deep frozen on his farm at Walston Braehead, near Dunsyre, Lanarkshire.
These samples had been tested by Western General Hospital in Edinburgh
and Monklands Hospital in Airdrie and revealed what environmental health
officers described as ''unacceptable levels of listeria''.
However, Mr Errington said he doubted the accuracy of the hospital
tests and said that, on re-testing, listeria was not discovered.
A harmless strain of listeria was found in the composite sample --
cheese pieces taken from the inside of a number of cheeses and blended
together.
Mr Errington told the court that he could not believe the high levels
of listeria found by the Scottish Agricultural College in February.
The suspect cheese had by then been deep frozen on his farm. He took
many samples from the deep frozen batches and sent them for further
testing at different laboratories.
Mr Errington went on to produce more certificates from different test
centres, in Bellshill, Halifax, and Gloucestershire, all showing
significantly lower levels of listeria than those found by the SAC.
The court had previously heard that listeria could be reduced by as
much as 60% in cheese when it was deep frozen.
Mr Errington said that, in January, he took soundings from the trade
on the listeria problem in blue and other cheese.
He said the managing director of a wholesale company in London told
him he regularly checked for listeria.
That firm provides cheese to Heathrow Airport airlines, Harrods, and
leading hotels in London, such as the Ritz.
Mr Errington said: ''The MD told me he would inform the authorities
only if listeria levels were discovered to be in excess of 100,000 per
gramme -- and even then he would not necessarily withdraw it and notify
the manufacturer.''
Mr Errington said his whole dairy had been examined from top to bottom
for a source of listeria but nothing had been found.
The case continues.

A HOSPITAL trust has confirmed it is to take legal action to allow a
woman who has lain in a coma for more than three years to die. It will
be Scotland's first right to die case.
Yesterday, after doctors met relatives of the woman, Mrs Janet
Johnston, 50, from Allanton, near Shotts, Law Hospital in Carluke said
it was taking up the case on humanitarian grounds.
The hospital's medical director, Dr John Browning, said the woman was
in a persistent vegetative state, was being kept alive with a feeding
tube, and had no hope of recovering.
Mrs Johnston, an asthma sufferer, slipped into a coma three and a half
years ago after reportedly taking an overdose. Her husband, retired
butcher Peter Johnston, 53, and his daughter, Ms Linda Bryce, 30, said
Mrs Johnston was effectively dead and should be allowed to die in peace
and with dignity.
Speaking at the hospital, the trust's chief executive, Mr Ken Thomson,
said the decision to go to the Court of Session in Edinburgh in October
came after months of discussion with medical staff and the relatives.
Independent neurologists had also been consulted and they shared the
view of doctors at Law Hospital.
He said the hospital's legal team, provided by the Central Legal
Office, had followed guidelines from the House of Lords set down after
the Tony Bland case in England.
Mr Bland, who had suffered injuries in the Hillsborough football
disaster, had been in a persistent vegetative state. On appealto the
House of Lords, his parents won permission for his artificial feed to be
withdrawn.
At present, there are no specific guidelines in Scotland, although
doctors in a previous case in Glasgow were advised by the Scottish
Office that a decision to terminate feeding would be in their hands if
an agreement was reached with relatives.
However, Mr Thomson said the hospital believed the proper forum to
discuss Mrs Johnston's future was the Court of Session. He said the
trust had decided to go down the legal route in order to protect its
medical staff. He said that until the court advised on publicity the
hospital did not want to give any further details on the case.
Mrs Johnston's family asked the hospital to read out a brief statement
on their behalf. In it, they said the decision to proceed with the court
case had been the most difficult and painful decision they had ever had
to make.
''The family has discussed their relative's condition with medical
staff and are all in full agreement that this is the correct way
forward.''
The legal position for doctors and relatives in Scotland wishing to
end the life of a patient in a persistent vegetative state has remained
in limbo since a statement by the Solicitor-General two years ago,
writes ALAN MacDERMID, Medical Correspondent.
It appeared to repudiate guidance given by the Scottish Home and
Health Department a few years earlier that artificial feeding could be
withdrawn without fear of prosecution provided certain conditions were
met -- that two consultants agreed on the matter, and had consulted
relatives.
The guidance -- which was issued to doctors treating a patient in PVS
at Glasgow Royal Infirmary -- was subject to the proviso that the
procurator-fiscal would be obliged to investigate if a complaint were
made to him or the police, making it important to have the agreement of
the patient's family.
As a result, the Glasgow patient was allowed to die without any
fanfare of publicity and the case -- and the advice given -- became
known at the time of the Tony Bland case in 1992. The implication was
that a court application would not necessarily be needed each time
doctors wanted to disconnect a dependent patient.
A few months later, however, the Solicitor-General, Mr Thomas Dawson,
QC, denied that any prior assurance could be given about immunity from
prosecution and said he could not speculate on whether a Scottish court
would take the same view as the English court took in the Bland case.
A Crown Office spokesman said yesterday: ''There appeared to have been
a misunderstanding about the position.''
However, the British Medical Association said: ''We believe this
should be a clinical decision, although it should not be taken until the
patient has been in a persistent vegetatuve state for at least a year.''

STIRLING -- dubbed the dirtiest town in Scotland by snooker supremo
Ian Doyle -- is to get a special clean-up before the visit of Hollywood
star Mel Gibson for this Sunday's European premiere of the film
Braveheart.
Stirling District Council's cleansing division said yesterday it had
organised its own Operation Braveheart to make sure the town was as
clean as possible.
A special squad of 14 street cleaners will be on the beat from 9am on
Sunday until 1am Monday morning.
They will concentrate on the town centre and the route to be taken by
the stars from the MacRobert Arts Centre, where the film premiere will
take place, to Stirling Castle, where 700 guests will attend a lavish
post-premiere party.
Every piece of litter will be removed and all bins emptied.
Earlier this month, millionaire Doyle -- who lives near the arts
centre -- said parts of the town were an absolute disgrace and bosses at
Stirling District Council should be ''for the chop''.
Mr Doyle, manager of superstar Stephen Hendry, said some American
visitors had told him Stirling was the dirtiest town they had seen in
the whole of Scotland.
However, a council spokesman said yesterday: ''This spruce-up would
have happened regardless of what Mr Doyle said. We want the town to look
its best for its special day.''

OWNERS of Glasgow's historic Lion Chambers are being given six months
to come up with the #1.7m required to save the grade ''A'' listed
building.
The eight-storey reinforced concrete structure in Hope Street is now
covered in protective scaffolding following an incident in March when
pieces of the structure fell on to the pavement in Hope Street.
Consequently, a dangerous- building notice was served on the various
owners but, so far, it has not been complied with.
Instead, the owners sought permission to demolish the building because
of the prohibitive costs of reinstating its structural integrity.
A council sub-committee on development control refused permission in
view of the building's architectural and historic importance.
Indeed, Historic Scotland has stated that Lion Chambers -- designed by
Salmon and Gillespie and built between 1904 and 1907 -- is of European
significance and that it would be ''unthinkable'' to demolish it except
in the most dire emergency.
While the owners do not feel able to meet the financial burdens
involved in complying with the repair notice, they are willing to
negotiate its sale to a responsible third party.
Since discussions are taking place with the Glasgow Building
Preservation Trust with a view to the trust undertaking the required
works, the council's sub-committee on building control has extended the
repairs notice for six months.
Local councillor Bailie Alex Mosson said: ''We decided on a six-month
stay of execution for the repairs notice. That will allow the planning
department, in conjunction with the Glasgow Preservation Society, to
bring forward a financial package which will be used to repair the
property and deal with the outstanding defects, which are running at
more than #1m.
''It's one of the most prestigious buildings in the city. It's unique
in Scotland and nobody would like to see it demolished.''

Beijing
THE UN raised its flag here today for the world women's conference,
amid fears that international delegates could be denied entry to China
if not in possession of the right visa.
As the pale blue UN flag fluttered above the Beijing International
Convention Centre, site of the September 4-15 World Conference on Women,
thousands of delegates began to arrive at the Capital Airport.
''Today, we are at an important stage in our long road to the
realisation of the place of the women's conference in history,''
conference Secretary General Gertrude Mongella said after the
flag-raising ceremony.
''This will be the biggest and I dare say most important UN conference
in history, because it is not about one group or the other,'' she
claimed: ''This conference affects every human being on earth.''
Delegations from 185 nations are to attend the conference and 30,000
people are to take part in the Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Forum
on women that will discuss issues from abortion to male violence and
female circumcision.
Among the early arrivals was Mr Pierre Sane, head of human-rights
group Amnesty International.
''We are seeking guarantees that human rights are a women's right,''
Amnesty International said. The group would focus on women's issues
rather than on human rights in China, it said.
Pink-shirted volunteers from universities said they expected 18,000
participants at Beijing's only airport today.
''Almost all of them will be foreigners from all over the world,'' a
German-language student from Beijing University said. ''I think most
Chinese delegates are coming by train.''
The most immediate problem was a shortage of baggage carts and a
lengthy wait in a huge queue as just one bank teller changed money at
the airport office of the Bank of China.
Some arrived without visas, taking a chance after confusion
surrounding their issue at Chinese embassies, diplomats said.
Chinese officials said such arrivals would be dealt with appropriately
and might not be expelled. NGO organisers said officials had given a
visa to a woman from Cyprus arriving on a UN Development Programme
(UNDP) train from Warsaw.
Danielle Stevens, a professor from Portland State University in Oregon
in the United States, said she and her daughter got their visas two
hours before departure and a frustrating lack of information from
Chinese diplomats defeated some women who wanted to participate.
Fifty Chinese primary-school children waving flowers and a band
welcomed the UNDP train carrying 199 women.
Dozens of police cordoned off the Beijing railway station and one
entire platform to allow buses to pick up passengers.
''It was a great trip . . . There was a resolving of conflicts between
women from different conflict-ridden areas. There was a lot of
excitement,'' one delegate said.
Hundreds of police lined streets in suburban Huairou where the NGO
forum is being held and officials sifted through baggage of delegates as
part of a tight security net.
China is nervous some delegates may try to stage protests.
''Everything seems to be going peacefully and I hope that the people
who come to the conference will maintain this tempo,'' Ms Mongella said.
''It feels very good to be here,'' said Loretta Ross from the Centre
for Democratic Renewal based in Atlanta, Georgia.
''We were told the government of China was going to do everything to
keep us radical women out. Turns out the power of women is stronger even
than the government of China.''
The organising committee found one unusual way to raise funds,
auctioning a 200lb mooncake, traditionally eaten at the mid-autumn
festival, to raise 4800 yuan. (#370)
''My original budget was 10,000 yuan (#770) but competitors were too
few,'' said successful bidder, businessman Qi Zhongquan.
He donated the cake, filled with almonds, walnuts, sesame and melon
seeds, to the conference.-- Reuter.

Hong Kong
HONG KONG remembered its war dead today and gave thanks for its
liberation from Japanese military occupation in the most elaborate
ceremony for 50 years.
Under the watchful eyes of 400 veterans and former prisoners of war,
Governor Chris Patten laid a wreath of poppies in memory of the fallen
at the colony's Cenotaph.
The veterans, many of them visiting Hong Kong for the first, and
probably last, time since the liberation half a century ago, marched
proudly past the review stand to the sound of drums and bagpipes.
Crew of the nuclear submarine HMS Trenchant, diverted to Hong Kong for
the ceremony, provided a ceremonial guard while RAF helicopters flew
past in formation.
A detachment from the Royal Hong Kong Regiment (The Volunteers), which
will be disbanded on Saturday ahead of the colony's return to Chinese
rule in 1997, paraded along with members of the Brigade of Gurkhas and
soldiers from the local garrison.
Afterwards, former prisoner of war Jack Edwards staged a protest,
lambasting Prime Minister John Major and his Cabinet for refusing to
grant British passports to non-British widows of Hong Kong veterans and
prisoners of war.
''I feel quite ashamed that I still have to be pleading with John
Major to do it,'' he said.--Reuter.

BEAUFORT Castle, ancestral home of the Frasers of Lovat, was sold
yesterday to Mrs Ann Gloag, co-owner of the Stagecoach bus company, for
what was understood to have been the asking price of #1.3m.
Mrs Gloag has also bought the adjoining Home Farm which had been
valued at #500,000.
Most of the rest of the 19,500-acre estate, the Frasers' heartland for
more than 500 years, has been sold in a number of lots, with purchasers
coming from the immediate locality and from further afield, including
Belgium, Holland, and Sweden.
Only a few cottages and woodland plots remain unsold but according to
the joint selling agents, Finlayson Hughes of Inverness and Knight,
Frank, and Rutley of Edinburgh, it is anticipated that these lots will
find buyers soon.
Mrs Gloag, whose mother was a Fraser, intends to keep the 23-bedroom
Beaufort Castle as a private house. She could not be contacted yesterday
for comment but issued a statement through a spokesman saying she was
delighted because of the Fraser connection.
She was also pleased to have been able to help keep Beaufort in
Scottish hands. This had been one of the motivating forces behind her
move for the property.
Mrs Gloag, who grew up in a council house in Perth, is reputed to
share a personal fortune of #174m with her brother, Mr Brian Souter, who
with her founded Stagecoach 14 years ago.
Meanwhile, the past few years have seen unremitting difficulty and
tragedy visited on the Lovat Frasers. In 1990, financial difficulties
had forced them to sell the fishing on the Beauly River, a river which
had been associated with their forbears since the fourteenth century,
and the 33,000-acre Brauien Estate for a reported #15m.
In March last year, Lord Lovat's son, Andrew Fraser, was killed by a
buffalo while on safari in Tanzania and, within a week, his eldest son
and heir Simon, Master of Lovat, died from a heart attack, leaving #7m
debts.
The 12,000-acre North Morar Estate, which had been bought at the end
of the eighteenth century by General Simon Fraser, was sold last autumn
to West End impresario Cameron Mackintosh.
In March of this year, the wartime commando hero Lord Lovat died
knowing that debts would force his family to sell Beaufort. His
grandson, Simon, 18,succeeded him. The new Lord Lovat has just finished
his A- levels and is planning an adventure holiday to Chile.
The Lovat family will retain about 7000 acres and 60 houses but,
yesterday, Mr Giles Foster, factor of the Lovat Estate and a cousin of
the last Lord Lovat, said: ''Sadly there were no bids from the family
and it is very sad to see the castle go out of the family after such a
long history.''
It had been rumoured that the late Lord Lovat's daughter, Mrs Tessa
Keswick, would make a late bid.
Mr John Bound, of Finlayson Hughes, said yesterday: ''While the family
and all those associated with the Beaufort Castle Estate have been
greatly saddened by events of the last two years, culminating in the
sale of the estate, they are nonetheless relieved that the estate has
been sold satisfactorily.

Amsterdam
THE Dutch arm of the aid group Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors
Without Borders) said today it would pull workers out of two camps for
Rwandan refugees because it believes they are being used as shelters by
the perpetrators of genocide.
Mr Jacques de Milliano, director of the Dutch section of MSF said nine
members would be withdrawn from Katale camp near Goma in Zaire while 13
would be pulled out from Ngara in Tanzania.
A total of 1500 local MSF workers would also cease operations.
''In refugee camps there are killers walking around making plans for
new attacks. We don't want to be part of that system,'' said de
Milliano.
A million Rwandans, mainly from the Hutu majority, fled to Zaire after
the July 1994 victory of Tutsi-led rebels. Tanzania has more than
700,000 refugees, mainly Hutus.
Many of them fear reprisals for last year's genocide in which
1,000,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.
De Milliano added that eight expatriate members of the Belgian MSF
would also move out of a camp in Goma.
He stressed it would take some time, possibly months, for a controlled
withdrawal and handover of responsibility to UN refugee authorities.
But he conceded that the MSF had had misgivings about events in the
camps for some time.
Calling for prosecution of those responsible for genocide in Rwandan
camps, de Milliano said: ''The population (in the camps) has become a
kind of prisoner of its own leaders and humanitarian aid is fuelling
these systems of impunity.'' -- Reuter.

Srinagar
THE Indian Government spoke directly today to one of the four
Westerners being held by guerrillas in Kashmir, the first such contact
in the eight-week hostage ordeal.
A spokesman for the government of Jammu and Kashmir state said the
radio conversation convinced authorities that Britons Keith Mangan and
Paul Wells, American Donald Hutchings, and German Dirk Hasert were all
unharmed.
''There was contact today,'' a senior police officer said. ''One of
the hostages has spoken to the government.''
An official said it was Hutchings who spoke on the radio but the
information could not be immediately confirmed.
It was hoped the direct contact marked an important step towards
solving the crisis.
Indian officials had demanded that Al-Faran militants holding the
hostages provide firm proof that all four were in good health before
reaching any final agreement.
A fifth hostage, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, was found beheaded
in an isolated region of Kashmir on August 13, beside a note from
Al-Faran threatening to kill the others.
Last week Al-Faran provided photographs and a tape recording
indicating the men were well, but they were apparently dated from August
18.
That was two days before Indian officials and diplomats learned of
another apparent threat to the captives' lives.
The threat was believed to have been quickly dropped, and authorities
said they have since had verbal assurances of the hostages' well-being,
but wanted firmer proof before reaching a final agreement, a senior
official said.
Authorities have been negotiating with Al-Faran through unidentified
intermediaries and have sketched the outlines of a possible agreement in
which the hostages and a number of jailed separatists would be released.
Al-Faran, which was unknown before the abductions, has demanded that
15 militants including at least three members of Pakistan-based
Harkat-ul-Ansar be freed in exchange.
India has ruled out releasing hardcore militants it says would rejoin
a five-year-old separatist revolt in which police and hospitals say at
least 20,000 people have died.
Harkat-ul-Ansar, which along with most Kashmiri separatist groups has
condemned the abductions, denies any ties to Al-Faran.
India has said it will not agree to an open exchange of jailed
militants for the hostages, but has indicated that a certain number of
separatists could be released as part of the government's regular review
of the status of prisoners.
Officials said one of the sticking points that emerged in the talks at
the weekend was the militants' insistence that the jailed
Harkat-ul-Ansar members be released.--Reuter

ANDREW POPPLE offers a cautionary tale for would-be globe trotters
THEY have all but forgotten it now, thank goodness, but one of the
most terrifying moments for our children -- and us, if truth be known --
happened at an airport check-in desk. We were travelling from New
Zealand to Australia, on a Friday afternoon. Not any old Friday, this
was New Year's Day. After a few days in Fremantle, on the West Coast, we
would be heading back home to Scotland, after a Christmas holiday Down
Under.
We got to the airport nice and early. All went swimmingly until the
clerk wanted our passports, to check we had entry visas. We knew the
Australian authorities were strict: no travel without the necessary
documents. The children have New Zealand passports, so they have
automatic right of entry. I had a ''valid duration of passport'' visa
and, therefore, so did my wife -- we had got them at the same time.
Wrong. My visa had been renewed for work reasons; hers had not. It had
timed out.
We were on as-cheap-as-you-can-get, no-changes fare, and the options
as presented to us were: stick together as a family and pay a fortune
for single fares back to the UK, or starting unpacking the bags there
and then to find my wife's things, so she could stay behind until she
could get a visa.
The next day that the consulate would be open was Tuesday --
''probably, but it might be Wednesday, it's a public holiday y'know''.
So there we were, discussing in front of a six and a four-year-old the
prospect of at least four days without Mum, who would have to sit around
for three of those days before she could start to sort it all out.
By now the queue behind us was forming, and we had to make decisions.
An appeal got us to an airline supervisor. Howls of: ''We won't go
without mummy'' helped. To cut a long story short, a series of
trans-Tasman phone calls and telexes got us ''exceptional permission''
to travel and argue the toss with the Australian authorities. With
minutes to spare, we were bundled onto the plane and away we went.
As the plane levelled out we looked at the copy telex we were
carrying: the permission was to go to Sydney; we were on our way to
Perth! Our only course of action was to front up and see what happened.
My wife was by now ready to burst, and my 'little joke' that the worst
they could do is put her in jail did not go down at all well.
Unfortunately our six-year-old heard me and shouted, horrified, for all
the plane to hear: ''Mummy's not going to prison, is she?'' It's a great
conversation stopper.
In the arrivals hall I knew we had been found out. The Tannoy was
calling rather insistently for me to go to information. I was handed an
official-looking envelope. In it was a note: re your hire car, its the
third on the left in the car park, the keys are under the mat.
Farce seemed to turn to tragedy as we hit immigration. The desk clerk
called across the immigration supervisor. This person had obviously had
no fun at all this New Year's Day and now saw her opportunity. My wife
was escorted, by armed heavies, to an interrogation room and we, the
rest of the family, were ushered away to wait in the main lobby. It was
late, and everything was closed. Even the toilets were being cleaned.
The children were tired, hungry, and worried and so was I.
Over an hour later, all had been resolved, and we were all allowed to
stay. Not without some hard negotiating, I gather. Rules are rules and
the fault was ours -- mine. But my wife's passport shows her title as
Doctor, and we had onward flights, credit cards and screaming kids. Not
the stuff of illegal immigrants, surely. However, her passport is now
stamped on every page with words to the effect ''tried it once, never
try it again''.
Aussie hospitality and weather soon banished those events to
pre-history. The children no longer cling to Mum as we front up at
airports, but I won't book so much as a fairground ride without checking
with her first.
So remember, everyone -- including the little one who wasn't with you
last year -- needs all the right travel documents, and if you make
assumptions, like me, you risk some uneasy moments and plenty of grey
hair. But the keys really were under the mat.

Nairobi
THE UN refugee agency today
admitted defeat after failing to get Rwandan refugees in Zaire to go
home voluntarily, raising the possibility that Zaire could resume
forcing them over the border.
Meanwhile, Rwandan Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu announced his
resignation as a senior Government official said he had been sacked.
Twagiramungu is a moderate Hutu politician who has been privately
critical of what he called Tutsi hardliners in the army and Government.
He was appointed in July 1994 after Rwanda's bloody civil war.
''The Prime Minister has been sacked,'' said Emmanuel Gasana, an aide
to President Pasteur Bizimungu.
Whatever the circumstances of his departure it is likely to strengthen
the determination of the million Hutu refugees in Zaire to stay put.
Zaire began forcibly expelling Rwandans from their huge camps nine
days ago, but stopped late last week after the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees agreed to restart a voluntary repatriation programme.
But only a few hundred of the vast Hutu refugee population have gone
home.
''It's a flop for very well known reasons,'' said UNHCR spokesman Joel
Boutroue.
''Extremists are still here in the camps and until that problem has
been addressed there will be very little voluntary repatriation.''
The failure of the UN effort presents a problem since Zaire has been
expected to demand ever faster repatriations before promising a
permanent halt to its own expulsions.
Zairian troops forced some 15,000 to return home. Another 173,000 fled
into the countryside, although 70,000 have since returned to the camps.
Zairian officials have become exasperated over the size of the 50-odd
camps, some of which house as many as 200,000 people. They are also
angry at the length of time the refugee crisis has gone on.
A land mine thought to have been planted by Hutu militants trying to
disrupt the departures exploded today, injuring two Zairian workers in a
UNHCR truck.
The land mine exploded as the refugee agency was preparing to take 117
people home. The driver and a passenger were injured as the truck was
leaving the Care Canada base in Goma.--Reuter/AP.

WORKERS at Kvaerner Govan are likely to learn today whether or not the
yard on the Upper Clyde has secured a #65m contract to build a rocket
transporter for the world's first commercial sea-based satellite
launcher.
The Govan yard has been locked in battle with its sister yard in
Germany for the contract to build the transporter for the Sea Launch
programme.
The launch platform will be based in the Pacific Ocean and is expected
to be operational from the beginning of 1998.
Fears had been expressed by union officials at the Upper Clyde yard
that its German counterpart may have an unfair advantage because of a
perceived Government failure to provide adequate financial support.
However, Kvaerner yard convener, Mr David Cooper, said yesterday he
believed the Government's support had been positive, adding: ''We are
optimistic.''
The transporter will carry the rockets from Russia to the platform and
will in itself cost around #66m, although Kvaerner has remained silent
about the overall investment in the programme in which it has a 20%
stake. Other participants include Boeing, Energia of Russia (which makes
the world's biggest rockets), and a Ukrainian space company.
Earlier this month, management of the Norwegian shipbuilding and
engineering giant, which owns the Govan yard, revealed that the yard --
which employs 1300 -- had made a small loss in the past 12 months but
believed that it should break even by the end of this year.
Finance director Jan Magne Heggelund said that while there had been
increasing productivity, the levels were ''not yet acceptable''.
However, he softened the blow by adding that, in a European context,
Govan's productivity was acceptable, although this was not enough to
appease the Kvaerner group.

A GROOM was suffering from amnesia last night, unable to remember his
wedding day, after being battered with a baseball bat at the reception.
His bride and the guests had been terrorised by a gang. Her #1000
wedding gown was splattered with Mr Dean Knight's blood as he collapsed
by her side.
Three other guests were injured when the gang of 15 invaded the
reception at the Grove Restaurant at Warsop in Sherwood Forest,
Nottinghamshire, at the weekend.
They were armed with baseball bats, pool cues, and a pistol that fired
ball-bearings. They demanded drinks and went berserk when refused.
The bride, 24-year-old Gillian Knight, was too upset to talk about the
attack. Brother-in-law Darren Knight, 19, said: ''Dean is very ill. He
has completely lost his memory and can't even remember getting married.
I saw them kicking him in the head when he lay on the floor.''
He added: ''One held his pistol at my neck and then put it to my head.
I thought he was going to shoot me dead.''
The bride's brother, Mr Anthony Radford, was also battered with a bat
and needed 27 stitches in a head wound.
Last night, police, who recovered a gun and other weapons, were
interviewing three men.

A MAN who stabbed his brother through the heart was jailed for eight
years yesterday.
John Boyd, 22, plunged the knife four times into his older brother
Stephen, 24, during an argument.
Yesterday, as he was convicted of culpable homicide, it was revealed
that the crime had left him with deep psychological scars. His lawyer,
solicitor advocate Maurice Smyth, told the High Court in Glasgow that
acute post-traumatic stress disorder had been diagnosed by a
psychologist.
Boyd described to the doctor how he suffered nightmares and frequent
flashbacks of the night he killed his brother.
Mr Smyth said: ''The loss of his brother is irreversible,
unforgettable and, indeed, unforgiveable. He has been left with a
scalding, indelible memory of what happened that night.
''There is no respite from the pain or guilt of what he did.
''His position is crystallised in his own words to the police: 'I
didn't mean to do it'.''
Boyd, who was living in a Glasgow hostel at the time of the killing,
was originally charged with murdering Mr Stephen Boyd, of Prospecthill
Circus, Toryglen, Glasgow, in Elmbank Street, also Glasgow, on April 1.
Yesterday, however, the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger, who was
prosecuting the case, reduced the charge to culpable homicide and Boyd
pleaded guilty.
The judge, Lord Marnoch, was asked to accept that Boyd had been
provoked.
The court heard how the tragedy was witnessed by Boyd's sister Paula
and his brother's girlfriend, Pamela Duke.
The brothers and Ms Duke had been in Glasgow for the night and were en
route to a fast-food restaurant where Paula Boyd worked when they
started to argue.
John Boyd, who had just come out of prison, wanted to go to a disco,
while his brothertold him for his own good not to go and to keep out of
trouble.
He resented being lectured and, when his brother started pointing his
finger and prodding him in the chest, a scuffle broke out and Boyd was
knocked unconscious by a blow to the temple.
When he came to, lying on the pavement with blood streaming from a
head wound, he was shocked to find himself abandoned by his brother.
Mr Smyth then told how Boyd went to the carry-out restaurant where his
sister was a chef, grabbed a knife, and stabbed his brother.
He then ran away in a panic and telephoned his mother in tears to tell
her what he had done. At the time, he didn't know he had killed his
brother.
Sentencing him to eight years, Lord Marnoch accepted he was filled
with remorse and bore in mind the provocation.

<TEXT>
AN Algerian thought to have planned the Christmas hijacking of a
French airliner in Algiers has been identified as a suspect in last
month's bloody bombing of a Paris commuter train, a French newspaper
said today.
The report in Le Monde follows the discovery of a 55lb unexploded bomb
alongside the high-speed TGV railway line near Lyon.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe held a crisis meeting with the Interior and
Justice Ministers over security measures as a judicial probe was opened
into the failed attack.
Investigators said the gas canister bomb packed with nails bore
similarities with bombs used in two recent Paris attacks which killed
seven people and wounded 103.
Le Monde said a second suspect in the July 25 attack on a Paris
commuter train was identified by a witness from a large mole on his face
as an Algerian using the assumed name of Yahia Rihane, also known as
Krounfil -- Algerian slang for a mole.
Algerian secret services had told French police Krounfil organised the
Christmas hijacking and wanted to avenge the killing of the four Islamic
Armed Group (GIA) hijackers by French commandos who stormed the plane in
Marseilles, it said.
A first Algerian suspect for the bombing, Abdelkrim Deneche, is being
held in Sweden. A request for his extradition is pending.
Deneche has denied the charges saying he was in Stockholm at the time.
Sweden's public prosecutor Jan Danielsson said Deneche was still a
suspect in the Paris bombing but denied a report he also was accused of
the Paris killing of a Muslim cleric on July 11.
0 Justice sources said an Algerian Muslim fundamentalist named as
Boualem Guerroudj was sent to prison and was being probed by a
magistrate for forging documents. But there was no indication the arrest
was linked to the bombings.

Bogota
A BRITISH diplomat kidnapped in Colombia was bird-watching in a remote
area of the country despite a warning from his embassy of the dangers of
abduction and terrorist attack, officials said today.
Timothy Cowley, a staff sergeant and aide to the British embassy's
military attache, was kidnapped two weeks ago by suspected left-wing
rebels manning a makeshift barricade across a rural road in the Tolima
area southwest of the capital.
Police and military officials have said the 32-year-old diplomat was
on a bird-watching expedition.
British Ambassador Leycester Coltman told journalists today that in
recent weeks ''there was a small change in advice given to travellers''
because of an upsurge in violent activity.
The embassy's latest travel advisory for British citizens in Colombia,
issued about the same time Cowley set out on his trip, stresses that
''travel by air is preferable'' throughout Colombia and that ''road
travel should be by major routes only''.
''Violence and kidnapping have recently increased in Colombia,'' said
the warning. ''In all rural areas in particular there is a serious risk
of being caught up in terrorist attacks and opportunistic kidnapping.''
The advisory, which notes that a British resident had recently been
kidnapped and killed in Colombia, warns that foreigners are ''a tempting
target'' for criminals in Colombia -- including assailants who
specialise in using a voodoo-like powder known as Burundanga to subdue
their intended victims.--Reuter.

FORMER Miss Lebanon Ghada Turk will not face court martial for posing
in a photograph next to Miss Israel at the 1993 Miss World gala, a
military investigator said today.
The dark-haired beauty was charged last year with breaking laws that
bar contact with Israelis -- an offence punishable under military law by
three to 15 years jail since the two countries are still formally at
war.
However, investigating judge Riad Talee ruled that 22-year-old Miss
Turk will not be tried since she only became aware she was posing next
to Miss Israel Tamara Bourat at the 1993 Johannesburg pageant after the
photograph was taken.
''It did not become evident that the suspect went too far in her
relationship with Miss Israel or had done any deal with her that could
harm Lebanon's security or jeopardise its interests,'' Talee said.
Beirut newspapers last year front-paged the photograph of the two
beauty queens rubbing shoulders and smiling, and indignant captions
demanded an explanation.--Reuter.

Salem
ROYAL Marines moved to the area of a rumbling volcano on this island
today to place remote sensing equipment, officials reported.
Scientists monitoring the volcano detected five small earthquakes
under the mountain overnight and five episodes of gas and ash venting.
This tiny British colony was in its sixth day of massive disruption,
with half its population displaced and few signs the situation would
change soon.
''We're in the worst possible scenario now, really,'' said Governor
Frank Savage. ''We've got everyone stuffed in the north end of the
island. We've got to watch sanitary conditions carefully.''
Several days of decreased seismic activity would be needed before the
evacuation order could be lifted, according to the scientific team. But
there were no signs of a let-up in volcanic activity.
Authorities ordered the evacuation of the southern half of the island
last Wednesday when scientists warned that the volatile volcano on
Chances Peak could erupt and said they could not assure six hours'
notice.
The population from the south have now moved to the less populated
north, where they remain crammed in public shelters and the homes of
family and friends. About 3000 people are believed to have left the
island.
The capital, Plymouth, remained closed but people were allowed to
return to their homes on a limited basis to tend animals or retrieve
supplies.
Islanders were relieved by the passage of Tropical Storm Iris, which
brought brisk winds and sporadic heavy rain but caused no damage to this
lush Caribbean island.
''It spared us, thank goodness,'' said Brigitte Lewis, a volunteer at
Radio Montserrat, the government radio station operating from a remote
location in the north of the island.
The island's small airport reopened today after being closed for a day
because of the storm.--Reuter.

A BRITISH travel agent accused of promoting child prostitution in the
Philippines denied the charge today, saying all he was interested in was
a ''safe family holiday''.
Michael Clarke, 48, from Eastbourne, Sussex, pleaded not guilty at a
preliminary hearing at a court in the town of Olongapo, north of Manila.
He is charged with trying to ''promote, facilitate child prostitution
by advertising sex tours'', according to court documents.
The law under which he was charged carries a maximum penalty of 40
years in prison.
Clarke, who appeared in the ramshackle court in a pinstripe suit with
a bow tie and red pocket handkerchief, told Judge Leopoldo Calderon he
could not afford either a lawyer or to put up bail.
The judge said he would appoint a lawyer for Clarke and would study an
application for his 40,000 peso (#987) bail to be halved.
Clarke, who has been in detention since June, was escorted into court
by two Immigration Bureau officials.
Asked by reporters before the hearing if he was guilty, Clarke
replied: ''Not guilty, sir, 100 percent. It was a complete set-up. Hook,
line, and sinker, it was a set-up.''
Clarke said he was a businessman and had only been interested in ''a
safe family holiday here''.
''Do I look like a pervert?'' he asked.
Clarke, whose case has been featured in a British current affairs
television programme, earlier claimed he had been set up by a Christian
cult.
Philippine President Fidel Ramos has ordered a crackdown on foreign
paedophile syndicates exploiting Filipino children.
Prostitution is widespread in this south-east Asian nation.
Clarke, who is next due to in court on September 27, told reporters he
had run out of money and was raising funds to buy cigarettes in
detention by cutting hair for 15 pesos (37p) per head.--Reuter.

THE release of Salman Rushdie's new novel has been put off in Bombay
amid fears that it could enrage the city's powerful Hindu fundamentalist
group.
One of the characters in The Moor's Last Sigh, set in Bombay, is
apparently said to be a caricature of Bal Thackeray, leader of the Shiv
Sena party that is known for using strong-armed tactics in dealing with
its critics.
Rushdie was born in the city.
''The situation in Bombay is volatile. Keeping in mind the controversy
regarding Rushdie's previous book, The Satanic Verses, we've decided to
play safe,'' said a spokesman for the book's Indian distributors.
It was published by Jonathan Cape in Britain and was released in other
Indian cities, including New Delhi, two weeks ago.
Rushdie has been living in hiding since 1989 when Iran's Ayatollah
Khomeni declared The Satanic Verses blasphemous and ordered his
death.--AP

<HEADLINE>Overhaul urged for civil justice. Citizens Advice says current set-up is failing to provide modern, reliable court system.</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S system of civil justice is in need of a radical overhaul so
that it can deal with the real problems faced by ordinary people, it was
claimed yesterday.
Citizens Advice Scotland says the present set-up is failing to provide
what the country needs -- a modern, reliable, simple court system.
The shortcomings of civil justice in Scotland will be addressed at the
annual conference of Citizens Advice Scotland, the Scottish association
of Citizens Advice Bureaux, which opens in Aberdeen today.
Among the speakers will be Court of Session Judge, Lord Gill, who
earlier this year called for a comprehensive review of civil justice in
Scotland in which the public must have a proper voice.
The two-day conference -- Citizens and Access to the Law: Truth,
Fairness, and Cost -- also comes against the background of a major
review of civil justice in the Court of Session, Scotland's supreme
civil court, announced by Lord Hope, the Lord President.
That would not affect how civil business is conducted in the sheriff
court.
Citizens Advice Bureaux deal with nearly three quarters of a million
inquiries from the public every year, and CABx say that, increasingly,
their experience is that the civil justice system is unable to cope with
the problems of ordinary people.
The main complaints against the system are its high cost, uncertainty
of the outcome of cases, an over-emphasis on legal argument rather than
realistic solutions, the old-fashioned, intimidating atmosphere of
courts, and long and unreasonable delays.
Mr Martyn Evans, chief executive officer of Citizens Advice Scotland,
said yesterday: ''The CAB services across Scotland see thousands of
people every day -- talking through, addressing, and tackling their
various and often complicated problems.
''We need a modern, reliable, simple court system. I regret to say
that, at the moment, we do not have one.
''I hope our conference can make a contribution to changing our system
for the better by establishing a dialogue between interested parties. We
hope to put the general public's interests and concerns first and
foremost in the civil justice system in Scotland.''
The concerns of Citizens Advice Scotland echo those expressed in a
powerful speech delivered by Lord Gill earlier this year when he
described our system of civil procedure as a ''contemporary relic of a
vanished age which is ill-serving the ligitant''.
Lord Gill argued that the usual piecemeal approach to reform must be
replaced by a comprehensive review of civil justice in which the public
should have a proper voice.
He added: ''The public are entitled to an efficient and well-funded
system of civil justice. Our civil system is to be admired only to the
extent that it serves their needs. The present system is failing the
litigant.
''The priority is the institution of a comprehensive civil justice
review in which every aspect of the status quo is open to question.''
Lord Gill urged the judiciary and legal profession to promote reform
before public dissatisfaction and resentment forced the issue.
Following Lord Gill's speech and similar criticisms by the late Lord
Morton of Shuna, Lord Hope announced a major ''nuts and bolts'' review
of civil procedure in the Court of Session.
He appointed a committee headed by Lord Cullen which will consider
what can be done to simplify procedure and speed up the disposal of
cases.
Lord Hope said: ''I accept that we have real problems in meeting the
demands of civil litigation and the points raised by Lords Morton and
Gill will come into the remit (of Lord Cullen's review).''
It is hoped Lord Cullen's report will be available by the end of the
year.

<HEADLINE>Fisherman phones wife for help after winch severs his leg</HEADLINE>

A FISHERMAN called his wife on his mobile telephone from his boat
yesterday and told her: ''Get help. I think I've lost part of my leg.''
Mr Tom Willacy was shrimping alone near his home town of Annan,
Dumfriesshire, when he got caught in a winch cable.
It severed his right leg below the knee but Mr Willacy, 55, of Solway
Crescent, managed to free himself and reach his mobile telephone on
board his boat, the Patricia Willacy, named after his wife.
She kept the phone connected and ran to a neighbour's house, where she
called the rescue services.
Last night, Mr Willacy was transferred to Glasgow Royal Infirmary for
specialist treatment to his leg.
Efforts to save it failed despite it being taken to hospital in
Dumfries packed in ice from a nearby fish factory.
Coastguard sector officer Tony Wood of Kirkcudbright, who co-ordinated
the rescue, said: ''This is one of the bravest men I have met.
''He managed to cut his clothing free after be became entangled and
his leg was severed. Then he phoned his wife to tell her.
''I have nothing but praise for this incredibly brave man.''
The incident began just before midday when Mr Willacy was fishing
close to shore off Newbie, on his 38ft shrimper. His boat had grounded
as he worked to reverse the winch wire (which lifts the net from the
sea) and, when he stepped back, the winch wire caught round his leg.
Mr Wood explained: ''As he went to see what happened, he was caught by
the wire.
''Whether he passed out or not is unclear but within minutes he had
cut himself free and alerted his wife.''
Silloth lifeboat crossed the Solway from Cumbria and a Sea King
helicopter from Prestwick also attended. A doctor and paramedics were
taken out to the boat and after stabilising Mr Willacy the lifeboat took
him ashore, from where he was flown to Dumfries Infirmary.
A spokesman for Liverpool coastguards, who received the emergency
call, said: ''We were chatting with Mr Willacy. It was amazing how he
kept calm. He was fully aware of everything and directed us to himself.
He told us he thought he had lost part of his leg. I don't know how he
kept going.''
Last night, police were investigating the incident and the Health and
Safety Executive had been informed.
Mr Willacy comes from a fishing family in the Solway port.
A Dumfries Infirmary spokesman said: ''Mr Willacy was assessed when he
arrived but unfortunately we could not save his leg. He was taken to
Glasgow for specialist treatment.'' Mr Willacy was said to be in a
serious but stable condition.

EIGHT ships carrying US weapons have arrived in the Gulf and more are
heading to the waterway as part of an American military build-up in the
region following fresh tension over Iraq, a US navy official said today.
American tanks and armoured vehicles on manoeuvres in Kuwait will hold
their first live fire exercise in the desert on Wednesday, US army
officers said.
''We currently have eight of the ships in the Gulf,'' said Commander T
McCreary, spokesman of the US Fifth fleet, adding that they were all in
international waters. ''Some more are coming.'' The United States has
also brought forward joint exercises with Kuwait as a precaution after
observing what it called unusual Iraqi military activity in Baghdad and
southern Iraq.
US military activity in the region has also increased since Jordan
gave asylum to two senior Iraqi defectors, one of whom called for the
overthrow of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein.
The ships carry tanks, artillery, food, fuel, water, vehicles and
other equipment required to sustain 16,500 marines in combat for 30
days, a US military spoksman has said.
In addition, they carry enough gear to sustain 5000 to 7000 US Army
troops, said McCreary.
Saddam said today that the United States had no justification in
rushing troops to the Gulf region.
''There is no credibility behind the US massing military vessels in
the Gulf and the Mediterranean . . . under the false pretext that Iraq
plans to invade Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,'' Saddam said, quoted
by the Iraqi News Agency.
Jordan's King Hussein and US officials said after the defection to
Amman of two senior Iraqis -- both sons-in-law of Saddam -- that the
Iraqi leader had been planning to invade Kuwait and Saudi Arabia this
month.--Reuter.

AS Osprey, the world's first offshore wave-power station, was breaking
up beneath the waters of the Pentland Firth yesterday, its developer
talked with confidence about the future of the project, even welcoming
the delay that Sunday's sinking now affords his company.
Mr Allan Thomson, managing director of the Inverness-based Applied
Research and Technology, which built the Osprey, said it had been
insured in Lloyd's Marine Market and his company would begin building
Osprey Two as soon as possible. He thought the ballast tanks on the #4m
Osprey may have been damaged during its launch at UIE's Clydebank yard
at the beginning of the month.
''Obviously, this is a disappointment for us but it certainly isn't
the end of the project. Identifying and solving problems is, after all,
the function of development engineers. It is at times like this you
realise that your insurance premiums were well spent,'' he said.
Osprey One had taken six months to build and Osprey Two could be in
the water by next spring. This would mean a delay of only a few months
to the originally intended National Grid connection, provisionally set
for late autumn. It would again be sited off Dounreay.
He said that, even after only a couple of weeks in the water, ART had
been encouraged by early indications that Osprey would out perform even
their most optimistic predictions.
Mr Thomson also said there had been world-wide inquiries about Osprey
both as an electricity generator and as a desalination plant, her
alternative use. He said that, ironically, the delay of a few months
would allow ART time to deal with these new contacts.
Meanwhile, the UIE yard at Clydebank was yesterday diverting all
inquiries on the Osprey to ART.

KURT SCHORK reports on the terrible scenes that followed the bombing
of Trznica covered market in Sarajevo
BOSNIA'S besieged capital was once again a scene of carnage today
after at least two shells slammed into the city centre, leaving dozens
dead and injured and severed limbs, brains, and shattered glass strewn
in pools of blood.
By day's end 37 people had died from their injuries and at least 85
lay wounded in Sarajevo's hospitals, many of them in grave condition.
One shell landed at the entrance to a busy covered market on main
street and the other near the National Theatre a few blocks away. Only
about 10 of the casualties were from the second shell, doctors said.
Later in the day another shell hit Sarajevo's Kosevo main hospital,
wounding two patients.
''Killers, bastards, they all deserve to be slaughtered,'' screamed a
woman covered in blood outside the market a few minutes after the blast.
Bosnian state radio blamed separatist Serb gunners who have laid siege
to the city since April 1992 for the attacks. The Serbs accused the
government of targeting its own people.
UN officials said most of the firing positions in the area where the
most deadly mortar bomb came from were Serb.
Dead and dying lay sprawled outside the covered Trznica market, where
the more lethal shell struck. Today's massacre occurred less than 100yd
from the open market where a shell killed 68 people and wounded 200
others in February last year.
Bodies were draped where they fell over steel railings separating
pedestrians from vehicles on Titova street.
Passers-by helped the wounded into private vehicles and drove them to
hospital with horns blaring and lights flashing to clear the way.
''Mummy, I've lost my hand, I've lost my hand,'' said a little girl
cradled in her mother's arms in the back of a reporter's car pressed
into service as an ambulance.
The girl clutched a blood-soaked blanket as her mother, missing an eye
from the blast, moaned: ''Where's my husband, I've lost my husband . . .
''
The surge of casualties swamped Kosevo Hospital, where doctors and
nurses treated wounded in the driveway once the trauma clinic had filled
to capacity.
A single smear of blood ran the length of the Trznica market from
front to rear where a wounded person had been dragged from the shell's
point of impact to safety. Yolks from eggs shattered by the blast oozed
across market counter-tops.
Outside, a human hand lay on the sidewalk among blood-spattered
packets of cigarettes vendors had been hawking. Shoes, bags of fruit,
ripped clothing, and bits of flesh were scattered everywhere.
A motorcycle lay in the centre of the street where its rider had been
struck down and blood flowed in rivulets along the asphalt channels of
the steel trolley rails.
Friends and relatives wailed in grief and some fainted when the list
of the dead was posted outside the Kosevo morgue and hospital in the
early afternoon.
As night fell on the city a single body remained unidentified and
morgue attendants escorted a few reluctant survivors into the building
to try to put a name to the victim.
Today's attack occurred just hours before Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic was due to meet US Assistant Secretary of State Richard
Holbrooke in Paris to talk peace.
''Every time there are peace talks Sarajevo pays the price and our
people are slaughtered,'' said a Bosnian Army soldier.
''The moment the shell landed was chaos and you couldn't recognise
anybody -- even a brother couldn't recognise his brother because people
were ripped apart,'' said Rasim, a policeman who normally stands outside
the Trznica market.
''I would have been dead but a colleague had just called me away when
the shell landed.''
Government-held Sarajevo has been surrounded by separatist Serbs
throughout the 40-month Bosnian war in which more than 10,500 city
residents have been killed and 50,000 wounded.
Serb officials have often charged that some massacres in Sarajevo have
been the result of government forces firing on their own population to
evoke international sympathy, but no such charge has ever been proved.
ZAGREB: Television footage recently filmed by the United Nations in
southern Croatia shows a Serb village in flames and two Serb civilians
slain in their homes.
Three weeks after the Croatian government army crushed the Serb
insurgence in Krajina, deserted Serb houses are still burning near Knin,
once the rebel stronghold in southern Croatia.
Depicting what officials called a fierce attack on a hamlet and its
civilians, the UN film showed one of the male victims shot from close
range through the head besides his bed and the other with his throat
slashed.
The Croatian army, which admits carrying out ''mopping-up operations''
in the village, is accused by the UN of systematically torching
homes.--Reuter/AP.

GOVERNMENT Ministers were accused yesterday of a ''dangerous rush
towards nuclear privatisation'' after a senior member of the industry's
leading safety watchdog body admitted that the timescale allowed for the
exercise ''seems short''.
The attack, by Labour's trade and industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson,
was made in response to an article in next month's issue of Nuclear
Engineering International by Mr Mike Weightman, HM superintending
inspector of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, who also warned
that the proposed changes ''could fundamentally affect the necessary
basis for operating nuclear power stations safely''.
Mr Weightman's comments came as the Government's privatisation plans
for the industry next year, involving a proposed merger of sorts between
Scottish Nuclear and the English-based Nuclear Electric, gathered pace.
In his article, Mr Weightman warned of many safety-related
implications both at a corporate and site level and added that the
decision to split the ownership of some nuclear sites would lead to
particular complications.
''To a lesser or greater degree, all such sites share some
safety-related services and facilities,'' he wrote.
''Hence the licensee will have to make submissions to NII to justify
that any changes proposed, and the way in which they are to be made, do
not compromise the current high standards of safety.''
Mr Weightman also pointed out that there may be a need for changes in
safety or management arrangements which would include the provision of
emergency responses because all sites currently owned by Scottish
Nuclear and Nuclear Electric would require to be relicensed under new
ownership.
He argued that where central resources such as expert technical
back-up were being split between the publicly-owned Magnox and the new
privatised company, the change would have to be demonstrated to be in
the best interests of safety. He added that the NII would inspect and
assess the measures to confirm that safety was not impeded.
Referring specifically to Hunterston nuclear power station in Ayrshire
-- a shut-down Magnox station which is to be transferred to the new
Magnox company -- he said a change would necessitate a revision of
management arrangements and require additional training of personnel.
Mr Weightman added that safety-related implications about the way the
new companies would be set up also existed -- such as the relationship
of the subsidiary companies, who will be the licensees, to the holding
company.
A statutory three-month period of public consultation would be
appropriate for all sites.
He concluded: ''Only after all this work has been completed
satisfactorily will NII inspectors be able to advise the chief inspector
that new licences can be signed. Around a year to 15 months seems a
short time.''
Mr Wilson said it was ''scandalous'' that the NII was up against a
''politically-driven timetable'' when dealing with such ''life-and-death
issues''.
''What happens if, in six or 12 months' time, they conclude that they
cannot complete the task in time?'' the Labour MP for Cunninghame North
asked.
''Mr Weightman says that any changes will require to be proven to be
in the best interests of safety. How can splitting ownership and
responsibility of a nuclear site meet that test? How can introducing the
motive of private profit make a nuclear site safer?
''Will Ministers, whose sole interest is in rushing this privatisation
through in order to fund tax cuts, even allow them that option?''
Mr Wilson said he had written to Mr Ian Lang, the President of the
Board of Trade, asking him to make clear, in light of Mr Weightman's
comments, that the NII could follow its own timetable without political
pressure.
Mr Richard Killick, Scottish Nuclear's director of safety and quality,
said Mr Weightman's article illustrated the ''right and proper'' degree
of detail and care which is taken by the NII in licensing nuclear sites
and said the public could rest assured by this.
He said Scottish Nuclear would maintain its high safety standards and
would co-operate fully with the NII during the preparations for
privatisation of the UK nuclear industry, to ensure that the appropriate
licensing of its sites was carried out to the standards required under
the health and safety legislation.
Mr Killick added: ''It has already been announced that the Government
intends to privatise much of the nuclear industry next year and Scottish
Nuclear and its sister company in England and Wales will be working
towards that target.''
Scottish Nuclear also confirmed that the overall re-licensing
operation was on schedule.

FOR the first time in its 49-year history, Edinburgh Festival Fringe
has sold more than #1m worth of tickets through its box office.
With the figures -- a 10% rise over last year -- taking no account of
takings at the venues, Fringe staff calculators are working overtime --
and there are still some days to go.
The sales represent only around 30% of all tickets sold.
Meanwhile, the Book Festival, which ended yesterday, was also setting
records. Around 13,000 more people attended it compared with the
previous event in 1993.
A 27% rise in ticket sales was reported, 13% more books were sold,
and, of the 210 ticketed events, 113 were a sell-out.
Fringe director Hilary Strong said they were all delighted with the
news that the #1m mark -- more than 163,000 tickets sold -- had been
surpassed.
''Our mission this year was to make the Fringe more accessible,'' she
said.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson yesterday promised a major
review of arts policy and funding in Scotland if Labour wins the next
election.
He said a Scottish Parliament would assume responsibility for the
arts, marking the end of decisions taken behind closed doors in
Whitehall or St Andrew's House.
''We see a clear need for greater openness in all our Scottish arts
and cultural quangos and for a much more visible accountability of their
members.
''Clearly a review of how the Scottish arts are financed will be
essential. The new powers of the Scottish Office in relation to the Arts
Council, the funding of the four 'national' companies, and the pivotal
role of local government expenditure has to be examined to see if the
system is working,'' he told the annual meeting of the Scottish Arts
Lobby (Salvo).
Mr Robertson praised the work of Labour councils in keeping the arts
alive. This contrasted with Tory mismanagement, he said.
Labour would reform the distribution of National Lottery funds and
ensure that small schemes were not ignored at the expense of large,
prestigious projects.
Mr Robertson said there was also a need to examine broadcasting's role
in Scotland's cultural identity and London domination of BBC
programming. The successful legal challenge to the Panorama programme on
the eve of the April local elections had proved a watershed in changing
the attitude of the BBC hierarchy to Scotland.

THE earth moved for the people in the Spey Valley yesterday when the
popular tourist area experienced its first earthquake.
The event measured 2.7 on the Richter Scale and happened just before
11am, lasting three seconds.
The sophisticated monitoring equipment of the British Geological
Survey in Edinburgh pinpointed the tremor at Avielochan, three
kilometres from Aviemore.
The depth of the quake was about 9km and it was strong enough only to
cause some vibration in buildings and shake glasses in the local bars.
However, it also shook the local population, with police at Aviemore
inundated with calls. A spokesman said: ''I can't recall an earthquake
in Aviemore before. One of our constables was one of the first to report
it, as he was out on the beat and felt the earth tremble.
''Another report was from a golfer on the Boat of Garten course. He
thought a lorry had hit the clubhouse.''
Geological survey spokeswoman Ms Jan Richards said: ''We are checking
our records to determine when the last quake occurred in this area, or
indeed if this is the first. It is certainly not a location associated
with earthquakes.
''It is difficult to determine the cause and if there will be another.
But it has nothing to do with the Montserrat volcano eruption. It is too
far away.
''Sometimes there is a build-up of pressure on the earth's crust and
it has to be let out somewhere. In Britain, it is difficult to exactly
locate geological faults but we are not aware of one in the Aviemore
area.
''It is some distance south from the Highland fault, which stretches
the length of the Great Glen from west coast to east.
''This tremor could be a new fault being created. It is unlikely there
will be any after-shocks of any strength, although a weak tremor can be
followed by a strong one, although this is extremely rare.''
The strongest earthquake in the Highlands was in 1816, measuring 5.1
on the Richter Scale. It caused considerable damage in the Inverness
area.

<HEADLINE>Skye bridge inquiry claim. Storm over wind speed 'cover-up'</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish Office withheld information which was unhelpful to its
case at the Skye bridge public inquiry, it was claimed yesterday.
The Skye Bridge Appeal Group says this mirrors its behaviour over the
M8 extension, which the Parliamentary Ombudsman found last week was
''significant maladministration''.
The information related to how strong winds might affect traffic on
the bridge. Ross, Cromarty, and Skye MP Charles Kennedy said last night
he would raise the matter with the Parliamentary Ombudsman as a matter
of urgency in light of the parallels with the M8 inquiry.
The appeal group, which is the umbrella organisation for opposition to
the bridge, claims that at the public inquiry in Kyle of Lochalsh in
January and February, 1992, Scottish Office officials gave repeated
assurances that the bridge would never be closed due to bad weather.
These assurances had been based on a report on winds at Kyle of
Lochalsh between April and December 1990.
A more up-to-date report, dated August 1991 and based on a 12-month
wind analysis from April 10, 1990, to April 14, 1991, was available,
however. It had been prepared for the Meteorological Office in Edinburgh
for the Glasgow-based JMP Consultants, which was advising bridge
builders Miller/Dywidag.
Mrs Pam Noble, secretary of the appeal group, said yesterday: ''We
have now got a copy of this report and it shows quite clearly that
bridge traffic flow could be impeded by strong winds gusting up to 129
mph. This could affect traffic for about 15% of the month of January,
down to 1.2% in July.
''The Scottish Office must now tell us why this information was not
made available to the public inquiry, given that they and JMP
Consultants had access to it.''
Mrs Kathleen MacRae, appeal group treasurer, said: ''All the report
does is to confirm what islanders have been saying until they are blue
in the face, that at times they may have to close the bridge because of
the dangers from wind gusts.
''But obviously we noticed the Ombudsman's comments on the M8
extension last week and the Scottish Office's role there, so we will be
taking this further.''
Mr Kennedy said last night that it appeared to him that there is a
striking similarity between the withholding of up-to-date, unhelpful
information to the M8 inquiry and the holding back of similar material
to the Skye Bridge inquiry.
''If last week's ruling has established a precedent, then surely it is
one that would have to be applied in this case as well,'' he said.
A Scottish Office spokesman last night accepted that the updated
report had been available at the time and added: ''But there was
absolutely no intention of withholding this from the public inquiry. If
we had been asked about it, it would have been produced.''
He said it had been commissioned principally to establish the
applicability of a nationally-used technical memorandum on wind loading
and whether the bridge design accorded with it. It also allowed an
assessment to be made of the bridge operator's proposals for dealing
with high-sided vehicles in stormy weather.

RESTORING mortgage tax relief will not allay the problems of home
owners whose mortgage debts are greater than the value of their houses,
a Joseph Rowntree Foundation report warned yesterday.
It says that a U-turn by the Government over recent cuts in tax relief
(Miras) as a way of helping owners, especially in the South of England,
faced with negative equity would have an inflationary effect on house
prices and create heavy pressure for interest rates to rise. It would
also cost the Exchequer #2000m to implement.
The Tory grassroots have called for the restoration of Miras to its
former level of 25% as a way of winning back disillusioned middle-class
support.
But the report by Mr Steve Wilcox of the University of Wales in
Cardiff urges the Government instead to consider a package of targeted
help for the housing market.
This would include the introduction of a mortgage benefit for home
owners on low incomes and the suspension of plans to restrict Income
Support payments to unemployed mortgage holders from October.
Mr Wilcox said negative equity remained a genuine problem for a small
but significant minority of home owners. An estimated one million were
affected but they represented just 7% of all home buyers.
Far from restoring mortgage tax relief, the fundamental case for its
complete abolition remains, the report argues.

THE BBC is to pay for a pilgrimage to K2 by the husband and children
of British climber Alison Hargreaves, who died on the mountain earlier
this month, and will make a documentary of the journey.
A television crew will accompany author and mountain photographer Jim
Ballard, 48, and their children Tom, six, and Kate, four, on a
10,000-mile round trip to the 28,250ft high peak in Pakistan's Karakorum
range in mid-September.
It was also announced yesterday that two trust funds are to be set up
in the climber's memory.
Ms Hargreaves, 33, was one of seven climbers swept to their deaths in
a ferocious storm on August 13 as she descended from the summit.
In May, she had scaled Mount Everest solo without oxygen.
The financial future of her children will be secured by the Tom and
Kate Ballard Trust, in response to interest and offers from around the
world.
Mr Ballard and accountants and lawyers representing the Nevis Range
ski centre -- where he works and where Ms Hargreaves trained for her
climbing -- are looking at the best way to set up the trust.
The Alison Jane Hargreaves Foundation also will be set up to provide
funds to help women's projects.
Mr Ballard is also to complete a series of books while Ms Hargreaves's
diary, continued on an almost daily basis until her death on K2, will be
published.
He will write an account of Ms Hargreaves's last trip called One and
Two Halves to K2 to accompany the TV programme, and a biography of his
wife, entitled Alison.
Last night Sue Affleck, of the BBC's Documentaries Department in
London, said: ''It is true that we have agreed to produce a documentary
of the Ballard family's memorial trek to K2.''
She confirmed that this would involve Mr Ballard and the children
visiting the mountain.

THE Glasgow ice cream war murderer, Thomas ''TC'' Campbell, yesterday
was moved out of Shotts Prison for a second time after concern by
medical staff about his poor physical condition. Campbell has undergone
a lengthy period of partial hunger strike, protesting innocence.
Campbell's wife and sister said yesterday they had been told the news
by Campbell but had confirmed it from prison authorities and that
Campbell himself had told them he expected to be in Law Hospital,
Carluke, for two days.
Campbell, convicted in 1984 of the murder of six members of the Doyle
family whose home was set on fire in Ruchazie, Glasgow, during the
battle over control of ice cream van rounds, has been taking liquid
sustenance in the jail.
He has always maintained that his conviction depended on perjured
evidence by witness William Love, who has since repeatedly recanted,
saying that he was coerced into giving the vital statement incriminating
Campbell.

SINN Fein and the Irish Government last night repeated calls for
all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland in the face of
continued British demands for prior moves towards the decommissioning of
IRA arms.
After a longer-than-expected review of the Ulster peace process in
Dublin, a joint statement from Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and Irish
Prime Minister John Bruton said inclusive talks should go ahead in which
all parties negotiated and made the compromises necessary to achieve an
agreed political settlement.
Neither the statement nor Irish Government spokesmen afterwards made
any reference to the continuing wrangling over the future of the IRA
arsenal.
However, a less reticent Mr Adams declared the arms issue position
adopted by Britain, ''calling on the IRA in effect to actually surrender
its weapons, is a non-runner''.
He added: ''We need to move the entire process forward, to bring about
change, to encourage those with weapons to build their confidence so
that all of the guns can be taken out of Irish politics.
''Making that a pre-condition, making that an obstacle to progress, is
a formula for disaster. We want to avoid that disaster.''
Mr Adams, who headed a Sinn Fein delegation of three, said the meeting
with Mr Bruton and fellow Ministers Dick Spring and Proinsias De Rossa,
the other party leaders in Dublin's coalition Government, had been
positive.
It came after a weekend of intensifying rowing over the arms issue,
and ''differences'' between London and Dublin that seem likely to lead
to a postponement of a summit early next month between Mr John Major and
Mr Bruton.
That meeting now looks certain to be delayed until later in September,
allowing time for the remaining UK-Irish differences to be ironed out
ahead of the prime ministerial get-together.

THE daughter of Ringo Starr was recovering from brain surgery last
night after being taken to hospital with an unidentified infection.
According to reports, Miss Lee Starkey, 24, who uses the former
Beatle's real surname, is in the #700-a-night London Clinic after
spending 36 hours recovering from the operation during which fluid was
drained from her brain.
The 55-year-old drummer cancelled an American tour to be at his
daughter's side. He was told she was well enough to leave the intensive
care unit and return to a ward.
She entered the clinic last Friday and was operated on almost at once.
She is expected to leave hospital later this week.
Miss Starkey, whose mother Maureen died earlier this year from
leukemia, ran a boutique in Los Angeles. Earlier, she worked in a record
shop and also attended drama school.
Starr spent hours at his daughter's bedside with his second wife, the
actress and former Bond girl Barbara Bach. His son Zak was also there.
Starr said: ''Lee is now on the ward and she is up and about. She is
not running about and she should be out by Saturday.
''She had been feeling unwell and the next thing we knew she was in
here. I came as soon as I heard. Lee had the operation on Friday and is
now up and about.
''We still don't know why it happened but we know it's not meningitis.
She's really brilliant today and will be coming out soon.''
The millionaire drummer lost #50,000 by cancelling his tour but said:
''Family is more important, isn't it? We are going to stay here until
she is better.''

TOURISTS from all over the world have been coming to Scotland in
greater numbers this year, after a depressing period over the last few
years.
Speaking on the eve of a tourist industry conference in Pitlochry,
hosted by the Scottish Tourist Board, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
said the early-season results were the best for five years and had given
tourism a considerable boost.
The number of tourists from January to May had shown a 16% increase in
bed nights, an 18% increase in trips, and a 14% increase in visitor
spending compared with the same period last year.
Mr Forsyth added that the rise in overseas visitors appeared to be
continuing. There was an overall increase of 11% of tourists to Britain
between January and April, with Scotland thought to have benefited
significantly.
The figures are in sharp contrast to an official report on the tourist
industry in Scotland last year, when consultants reported that tourism
figures had fallen by 15% over the previous five years.
It recommended a review of strategy, pointing out that many visitors
were reluctant to venture into the country's more remote areas, such as
the Highlands and islands.
Recently, however, events like the Tall Ships' Race from Leith and the
Edinburgh Festival and Tattoo -- along with major films made in Scotland
-- are thought to have helped reverse the trend.
Other factors include the promotion of Scotland's cuisine and produce,
and the Autumn Gold initiative, designed to extend the tourist season.
Next year, one of the major events will the Burns bicentenary.
Mr Forsyth last night: ''Clearly, there is some way to go before we
can draw firm conclusions about the 1995 season but this is a step in
the right direction.''
Mr Ian Grant, chairman of the Scottish Tourist Board, said he was
encouraged by the figures but would prefer to study them over a
nine-month period before being able to declare whether 1995 had been a
bumper year.
He added: ''We have been helped by the good summer but there have been
pockets which have not been so good. Exhibitions such as Deep Sea World
at North Queensferry, for example, have not been helped by the good
weather conditions which may have kept the number of visitors away.''
Nevertheless, he felt the figures would be followed by more good news.
''We would like to think that visitors to Scotland this year
encountered good hospitality, good food, and will continue to return in
the future,'' he said.

A SENIOR church leader said yesterday that Christianity throughout the
world was growing more rapidly than at any time in its 2000-year history
-- but declining in Europe.
The assertion was made by Bishop Lesslie Newbigin of the United
Reformed Church, a former bishop of the Church of South India.
He was making one of the keynote speeches at the European Area Council
of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches in Edinburgh.
Delegates including the president of the alliance, Professor Jane
Dempsey Douglass, a theologian at Princeton University in the US, were
welcomed at the first of a number of workshops by Scottish Office
Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
The bishop said that, in statistical terms, Christianity is now
primarily an African religion, claiming that in Europe, so long its
heartland, it is in decline.
His theory was that the type of consumer society developed in affluent
parts of the world in the last 50 years were being replicated in areas
previously untouched by it.
He said: ''While Europe still plays a significant part in the global
economy, it is now clear that, within a few decades, Europe will be a
very minor player, and the rules will be set by the newly emerging giant
economies of East Asia -- especially China.''
He emphasised that the gap between rich and poor would grow wider,
with the moral guidance traditionally provided by religion,
progressively lost.

LABOUR MP George Galloway's attempt to lead a consortium to take over
Partick Thistle Football Club was in disarray last night after leading
Asian businessmen told the MP they were pulling out of the deal because
of the way it had been handled.
Mr Galloway and newspaper columnist Ron McKay, who had been the public
voices of a supposed consortium of Asian business leaders willing to buy
the club, held a news conference yesterday to announce they themselves
were leaving the consortium.
What they did not explain however, as The Herald has since learned, is
that millionaire businessman Charan Gill already had told Mr Galloway
that he wanted nothing else to do with the consortium. The same message
was conveyed by Mr Maq Rasul, managing director of Global Video, who
also wanted to dissociate himself from any bid.
Mr Gill, owner of a string of restaurants, public houses, and a food
factory in the West of Scotland, disclosed that his involvement was
based only on a short phone call with Mr Galloway when he was told that
Partick Thistle was up for sale, and asked whether he was interested.
Mr Gill said yesterday that he pulled out when he realised that this
was not the case and that the board of Thistle did not want to sell. He
also expressed his disappointment at the public way business was being
done and said it was not the way that business is properly conducted.
''The whole situation has been handled in an improper manner,'' he
said yesterday. ''The whole thing has been blown out of all
proportion.''
Global Video stated that its board decided on Sunday not to continue
its interest in buying shares in Partick Thistle as it wanted to
concentrate its energies on expanding its core business into England.
Mr Galloway insisted yesterday that there was still a consortium of
Asian businessmen interested and he hoped that a bid would be made soon.
He refused to say, however, who was in the consortium or how much they
would offer for Partick Thistle.
He said he and Mr McKay were pulling out of the consortium as it was
clear that Mr Jim Oliver, chairman and major shareholder of Thistle,
would not do business with them.
He concentrated instead on his ''deep resentment'' of comments made by
Thistle chairman Jim Oliver, on the club's telephone newsline, when Mr
Oliver stated: ''If anyone out there thinks we are going to give away
the company for which we have worked very hard over the past few years
and incurred huge personal losses, just to satisfy the wishes of some
Indian with a curry shop, they better think again.''
It was Mr Oliver's remarks, he claimed, which were making some of the
consortium have second thoughts about becoming involved in Scottish
football.
Mr Gill said: ''I am very surprised at a man of Mr Oliver's position
making a comment like that.''
Mr Oliver, in an exclusive interview with The Herald, is adamant that
the club is not for sale. As yet, no-one has put a penny on the table to
buy it.

Belfast
FOUR MPs are emerging as the major contenders to take over the
leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party from Mr James Molyneaux, who
resigned yesterday.
As tributes were paid to Mr Molyneaux, 75, in London, Dublin, and
Belfast, it appeared that his successor will be chosen in the next few
weeks.
The resignation of the Unionist leader came as a surprise to Northern
Ireland, even though he had come under pressure to step down in the past
year.
The Prime Minister, who consulted Mr Molyneaux during the course of
the peace process but did not always take his advice, said: ''Jim
Molyneaux has been a forthright and brave leader of opinion in Northern
Ireland for very many years.''
Mr John Major added: ''Few people have made such a great
contribution.''
However, Democratic Unionist leader Mr Ian Paisley said the
resignation was ''inevitable'' and described Mr Molyneaux's trust in Mr
Major as ''catastrophic'', although he added that his relationship with
Mr Molyneaux had been ''very good, frank, and honest''.
About 900 delegates of the Ulster Unionist Party, including 100
representing the Orange Order, will be invited to choose the next
leader, who is almost certain to be one of the party's Westminster MPs
The main contenders are security spokesman Mr Ken Maginnis, 57, the
party's Chief Whip Mr William Ross, 59, Orange Order leader the Rev
Martin Smyth, 64, and former Stormont Government Minister Mr John
Taylor, 57.
Mr Ross, a traditional Unionist from the same mould as the outgoing
leader, has long been regarded as the favourite. He is the MP for East
Londonderry and a confidant of Mr Molyneaux's. However, recently, his
low profile appears to have lost him ground.
Mr Maginnis called yesterday for a swift leadership decision to enable
the political process to continue in the wake of the terrorist
ceasefires last year. Mr Maginnis is noted for his trenchant criticism
of the IRA and Sinn Fein but also as one of the few Unionist spokesmen
who has been involved in tentative talks with Irish leaders in Dublin.
Mr Smyth's strength will centre on his position as Grand Master of the
Orange Order while Mr Taylor is one of the party's most articulate
spokesmen with an involvement in Unionism dating back to his student
days.
No clear favourite has emerged so far and one outsider may still be
the Armagh MP David Trimble, who has impressed Unionists in recent
months with his television performances.
The resignation of Mr Molyneaux is certain to cause an intense
internal battle in the Unionist Party.
Not only does the party leader have a crucial role in the current
peace process but, with the Government's narrow majority at Westminster,
he could command much wider influence as Mr Molyneaux has attempted to
do with Mr Major in recent years.
Labour leader Mr Tony Blair was among those who paid tribute to Mr
Molyneaux yesterday, saying: ''James Molyneaux is a distinguished
parliamentarian who has built up a considerable reputation as leader of
his party.''
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said he had led his
party with ''great shrewdness and courage over many years''.
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said Mr Molyneaux had displayed
courageous judgment during critical moments in Northern Ireland.
Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams, who wished Mr Molyneaux well in
his retirement, said Mr Molyneaux's successor would have the ''difficult
but not impossible task of providing the Unionist people with the
effective pragmatic leadership which has so far been lacking''.

EXCLUSIVE
RAILWAY privatisation was thrown into further disarray last night when
it emerged that future Government funding for train operating companies
will favour those that are sold off.
Financial support will be ''assured'' for train operators in the
private sector -- but merely be ''discretionary'' for those in state
ownership, according to a document in the possession of The Herald.
Such contrasting fortunes are of particular significance to Scotland,
because it is possible that north of the Border only InterCity East
Coast main line will be in private hands this side of a General
Election.
Any cuts in financial support would raise serious questions over the
extent and quality of service that InterCity West Coast main line -- and
ScotRail, the largest commuter network outside London -- would be able
to provide.
However, the implications go further. The report warns potential
investors that reduced funding could have ''adverse implications'' for
train operators that are privatised throughout the UK network.
Labour transport spokesman Henry McLeish last night claimed that the
report was a blatant sign that the Government was moving to a ''two-tier
level of funding the railways.''
He likened it to offers of preferential funding to English schools to
opt out of state control, and added: ''It is a blueprint for chaos.''
Concerns over future funding follows a report by the Office of
Passenger Rail Franchising, responsible for the sale of 25 train
operating companies under the break-up British Rail.
The report, an overview of the industry, underlines that once
franchise agreements are in full force, train operators will be
contractually entitled to receive financial support from Opraf.
However, it says the level of support for train operating companies
which are not franchised will remain at the Government's discretion, and
adds: ''No assurance can be given as to the future levels of financial
support for such non-franchised train operating companies (Tocs).
''Potential investors should be aware that any reduction in the level
of financial support paid to non-franchised Tocs could affect the extent
and quality of service supplied by them. This could have adverse
implications for the businesses of the franchised Tocs.''
Industry experts predict that about 60% of the UK network still will
be in the public sector by the next election, due in 1997 at the latest.
Privatisation of the West Coast main line has already been shelved,
while ScotRail has been dropped from the second tranche of operators to
be invited next month to tender to run services after privatisation.
Mr McLeish said of the Opraf report, which suggests finance will be
guaranteed over the seven-year private franchises while operators in the
public sector face cuts: ''It is not a level playing field.
''It looks as if the Government -- facing a chaotic franchising
timetable -- is now intent on frightening the train operators to move
more quickly into the private sector by building financial uncertainty
in the public sector.''
He will now call on Transport Secretary Sir George Young to ensure
that subsidies are maintained, regardless of the status of operating
companies.
Meanwhile, it is suspected that British Rail will be excluded again
from bidding for passenger franchises.
Although the Government has conceded an amendment which allows BR to
compete, it was not allowed to bid for the first three networks -- Great
Western, South West Trains, and London, Tilbury, and Southend.
Next in line under the privatisation programme are Midland Mainline,
Network South East, Gatwick Express, and InterCity East Coast.
It is understood BR will be denied the opportunity to bid when
invitations go out next month -- despite an all-party Commons committee
recommending it should always be given the opportunity to do so.
Labour is expected to demand that BR should be given the same right to
compete as anyone else, including foreign companies.

<HEADLINE>UN on alert after mortar attack in Sarajevo marketplace kills 37. Bosnians demand revenge air raids</HEADLINE>

THE mortar which slammed into a Sarajevo market yesterday, killing at
least 37 people and injuring 85, could have bombed Bosnia back to
all-out civil war. Calls for revenge were swift.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic threatened retaliation. ''As far
as the killers are concerned, my message to them is: we shall strike
back evenly and very soon too,'' he said.
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic proposed suspending the US peace effort
and demanded that Nato prove its resolve by bombing Serb gun positions.
He called for ''air raids, air raids immediately'' by Nato forces.
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali last night ordered military
commanders to take unspecified action against those responsible.
Last month, the West warned Bosnian Serbs after the special London
summit that even the threat of an attack on Gorazde, a safe haven, would
bring Nato air strikes. However, it was later understood that attacks on
Sarajevo would also be punished.
The West's response could be determined today in Paris, where there is
a full meeting of the Contact Group on former Yugoslavia, with Britain,
France, Germany, Russia, and the United States, being joined by
officials from Canada, Italy, and Spain.
The 120-mm mortar exploded at the entrance to an indoor market packed
with morning shoppers.
Hours later, wounded patients were injured again when fresh shells
slammed into a hospital full of victims of the morning's attack and
previous bombardments of the besieged Bosnian capital.
The Muslim-led government and the rebel Serbs quickly accused each
other but UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko noted that the first shell was
fired from the south of the city where ''most of the positions are
Bosnian Serb positions''.
The blast left bodies, some without arms or legs, lying in pools of
blood. Some corpses fell apart as rescuers tried to load them into cars.
Many of the dead were children, women, or old people. Sporadic fighting
broke out around Sarajevo following the attack.
The mortar attack, the worst in more than one year in Sarajevo, was
staged hours before Mr Izetbegovic was to meet American envoy Richard
Holbrooke in Paris to discuss the new US peace plan.
''This will not stop the peace process. It will only make us redouble
our efforts,'' Mr Holbrooke said.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said:
''Military pressure will not push us off the negotiating track.'' He
said it ''remains to be seen'' whether the attack was enough to trigger
retaliatory air strikes.
Mr Burns made clear Washington believed the Bosnian Serbs were behind
the shelling, although this was denied by Bosnian Serb officials. ''We
believe this attack is another crime against humanity. The obvious
target of Bosnian Serb shelling is once again the civilians of
Sarajevo,'' Mr Burns said.
In a statement, Mr Boutros-Ghali condemned the shelling
''unreservedly'' and said he had instructed military commanders ''to
investigate this attack immediately and to take appropriate action
without delay''.
His spokesman Joe Sills said any response to the attack would be
determined by French General Bernard Janvier, the overall commander of
UN forces in the Balkans, and Britain's UN commander in Bosnia,
Lieutenant General Rupert Smith.
''That's as far as I can go. I cannot speculate on what action will be
taken or what the timing will be,'' he said. ''But I want to underline
that no options will be ruled out.''
There were fears last night that British soldiers were being blocked
by Serbs from leaving the eastern enclave of Gorazde, a move to prevent
air strikes by using them as hostages. However, UN officials said the
peacekeepers were en route to the border and had not encountered any
problems.
Bosnia's Minister for UN relations, Mr Hasan Muratovic, said: ''At
this moment, Serbs are holding the last column of British soldiers that
is leaving Gorazde. I warned General Smith five days ago and told him
that the last column would be stopped. No strikes are being discussed
for this very reason.''
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence in London said last night it
had no knowledge of British soldiers being blocked. ''It is always
difficult to say exactly what is going on but we don't think it is
true,'' he added.
Foreign Office Minister Baroness Chalker called the attack ''senseless
and depraved'' and said Britain was ready to respond to any requests for
humanitarian help.
''There can never be any justification for these attacks on civilians
and we condemn those responsible,'' she said.
''There can be no military solution to this conflict.''
It was the worst incident since 68 people were killed and some 200
wounded at a nearby outdoor market in February 1994.
The Bosnian Serbs accused the Sarajevo government of targeting its own
people.
Bosnian Serb army commander, General Ratko Mladic, said the attack was
''constructed to stop the peace process and trigger Nato strikes''.
The call for air strikes was not slow in coming. Prime Minister
Silajdzic said: ''If the United Nations wants to stop innocent people
being killed and for us to stop seeing children's arms and legs all over
our streets, they have to understand that those people (Serbs)
understand only force and nothing else.''
Asked what Nato should do, he said: ''I want air raids, air raids
immediately to punch those who are killing innocent people. Air raids
and we will have peace.''
Western governments condemned the attack. Germany demanded that those
found to be responsible be punished. The United States denounced it as a
crime against humanity, Italy said it was deplorable, and Russia said it
was barbaric.
President Izetbegovic is due to lunch with French President Jacques
Chirac today.
Mr Izetbegovic said he heard of the massacre in the town of Mostar and
considered calling off his trip.
He accused the international community of allowing the Bosnian Serbs
to attack the capital with impunity while refusing to lift a UN arms
embargo which has favoured the better-armed Serbs. ''I am going to
France to ask them how long will this situation last and how long will
this violence be tolerated,'' he said.
